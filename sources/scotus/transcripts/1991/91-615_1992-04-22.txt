ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER HELLERSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The essential question now before this Court is

12

whether there must exist some connection beyond the mere

13

jurisdictional presence of the corporation in a State in

14

order for a State to tax an apportioned share of all of

15

that corporation's income.

16

have some connection with the activities of produced

17

income in order to tax an apportioned share of it?

18

In other words, must a State

We believe the answer to this question is yes

19

for three reasons that I'd like to state briefly and then

20

return to in more detail.

21

nondomiciliary taxpayer depends on the benefits and

22

protections that the State provides to the taxpayer's

23

activities in the State.

beyond mere ownership between the in-State activities of

2

the corporation and its out-of-State activities before the

3

State can take account of those out-of-State activities in

4

determining the in-State tax liability.

QUESTION:

Mr. --

QUESTION:

What about a -- excuse me.

7

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

8

QUESTION:

What about a domestic corporation

9
10

incorporated in the taxing State?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Justice White, in terms of

11

State tax jurisdiction there clearly are two theories on

12

which jurisdiction can be based, one with regard to

13

nondomiciliary taxpayers is source.

14

is a well-established theory in the tax jurisdiction, is

15

residency, and there is no question that a State of

16

residence or domicile does have power to tax all of a

17

corporation - -

18

QUESTION:

Another theory, which

Even though the income that it

19

includes within the gross income is produced by activities

20

that have absolutely no connection with the State.

21

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

No, that -- Your Honor, the

22

reason underlying the residence principle does not have to

23

do with the particular - -

24
25

QUESTION:

Oh, you mean residence just gives a

connection no matter where the income comes from.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

1

Your Honor, that is a

2

well-established principle --

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, it may hie, but the kind of an

argument you're making would seem to challenge that.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

5

No, Your Honor, because our

6

essential position in this case is that when you have a

7

nondomiciliary that has no connection with the State other

8

than the activities that is engaged in there, the State

9

must provide benefits and protections to those activities.

10

With regard to a resident taxpayer, whether it's an

11

individual or corporation, while in principle the State

12

has power to tax all of the income, that power does in

13

fact yield when there are activities in other States that

14

are taxable by other States.

15

QUESTION:

Well, what about a nondomiciliary

16

corporation that is doing business in the State and it's

17

a -- and there's no question that the State can tax its

18

share of the income of that corporation because it's doing

19

business there.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

20
21

22

That's correct, Justice

White - QUESTION:

Now, you would say that that

23

nondomiciliary's corporation income from activities that

24

have absolutely no connection with the State, like

25

investment income - 5

5

That's correct, Your Honor,

because - QUESTION:

Would have -- the State could not

include it in gross income.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

That is right, because there

6

has to be an organic connection between the activities of

7

a nondomiciliary taxpayer and its activities outside the

8

State in order for the State to look outside.

9

QUESTION:

So there's a difference between a

10

domiciliary corporation and a corporation that is not

11

domiciliary but it's doing business in the State and is

12

taxable there on its activities.

13

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes, Justice White, there is a

14

fundamental difference that underlies, for example, the

15

basic scheme in which the United States taxes --

16

QUESTION:

You mean -- what you mean is that

17

there's a theory, there's an accepted theory that you can

18

tax a domiciliary corporation on all of its income.

19

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Justice White, there is more

20

than a theory, there is a practice going back 100 years,

21

the very basis, for example, that the United States taxes

22

all domestic corporations on income it earns in France or

23

Germany, or wherever, is based on the notion that a

24

domestic --a domiciliary corporation may be taxed on all

25

of its income.

What is it that gives the State the power, for

1

2

example, to tax an individual on all of his income

3

wherever its earned?

4

principle, which is as well-established as the

5

source-based principle.

It's the same residence-based

However, when we have States seeking to tax the

6

7

same income, it's quite clear when there's an intersection

8

between those two principles, then it is the source State

9

that generally may prevail over the residence State,

10

because to allow both States to‘tax would violate the

11

commerce clause.
QUESTION:

12

Well, Mr. Hellerstein, I think that

13

probably ASARCO put forward the view that for the

14

nondomiciliary entity to be -- for their dividends or

15

income to be taxed in the taxing State that the dividend

16

payor has to be unitary with the payee.

17

required under ASARCO than just a flow of value into the

18

taxing State from that nondomestic entity.

19

think that's a valid requirement?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

20

Something more is

Now, do you

Justice O'Connor, we have

21

never taken issue with the proposition that there may be

22

apportionable income, other than income that is related by

23

a unitary relationship between the underlying payor and

24

payee.

25

For example -QUESTION:

But there certainly is language in

1

ASARCO that would say just that, isn't there?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

2

Yes, Justice O'Connor, there

3

is language, you know, in ASARCO which if read literally

4

and applied to facts that were not at issue in ASARCO •

5

might well exclude, for example, income of a foreign

6

products nature or working capital.

7

We have certainly not taken issue with the

8

notion that investments that are integrally related to the

9

taxpayer's operations in the State, organically

10

related -- capital that flows in and out of the business,

11

that certainly wouldn't be apportionable, but there is no

12

reason, as New Jersey suggests here, because of this

13

doctrinal foot fault, if that's what it was in ASARCO --

14
15

QUESTION:

into the State, anyway.

16
17
18

So there has to be some flow of value

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

We fully agree with that, and

indeed - QUESTION:

Well, all right.

Now, if you agree

19

with that, can you say there is no such value that flowed

20

in here in the circumstances of this case where the

21

purpose of the investment was to acquire enough capital to

22

go ahead and acquire more of the underlying business in

23

the domestic State?

24
25

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, because

the only connection here is the very type of connection

1

that this Court has described as attenuated,•not organic,

2

that connects every business that's under a single,

3

corporate shell.

4

For example, if --

QUESTION:

But isn't it something more than

5

that?

6

capital, but it's capital for a longer term expansion, in

7

effect.

8

9

Maybe it isn't the hard-core definition of working

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

In

that situation, for example, suppose that Bendix had

10

earned income from aerospace operations in New Jersey.

11

Now, Bendix takes that income which is taxed by New

12

Jersey, and now it invests in some other asset having

13

nothing to do with New Jersey - - a yak farm in Outer

14

Mongolia -- and then it sells the yak farm and it buys a

15

hula hoop factory in South Korea.

16

New Jersey, I suppose, still has some attenuated

17

connection to the original dollar that might have been

18

earned in New Jersey, and sometime in the 21st Century

19

might well be reinvested in New Jersey, but until that

20

income has that connection with New Jersey, even if it had

21

some historical connection with New Jersey or may be

22

poised to be reinvested in New Jersey, to use the

23

phraseology of some of the amicus briefs here, New Jersey

24

does not have that organic connection with that income to

25

tax it, unless you want to fully abandon the notion which

has underlay this Court's decision for over 100 years --

2

QUESTION:

Well, suppose that in New Jersey the

3

Bendix board of directors meets and they say we have a

4

very high-tech speculative research project we want to

5

conduct in New Jersey.

6

to undertake that is because we know we have a very safe,

7

secure investment in ASARCO.

8

back and forth, but isn't there a value there that the

9

company relies on?

Now, the only reason we're willing

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

10

There's no checks flowing

Justice Kennedy, that's

11

precisely the kind of value that the Court said was so

12

attenuated that it could not be included in the

13

apportionable tax base in cases like Fargo v. Hart.

14

QUESTION:

But is it attenuated in the real

15

sense?

16

very real business kind of a decision and a business kind

17

of judgment, and isn't this the way a business is properly

valued?

Isn't the example I've given you, the example of a

If you were a banker, you'd certainly want to see

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Well, that's -- Justice

23

Kennedy, it's certainly correct that in that attenuated

24

sense, you have a connection.

tft.

1

recognize that in Fargo v.. Hart, for example, there were

2

bonds worth 15.5 million that the Court recognized in some

3

sense added to the creditworthiness of American Express in

4

Indiana, but Justice Holmes said that was not sufficient.

5

In other words, the mere fact that there was

6

wealth in the corporation, there was money that adds to

7

the riches of the corporation, does not give the State the

8

concrete connection that it needs where it is not a

9

domiciliary State to tax the income of an out-of-State

10
11

corporation.
QUESTION:

Well, you say that's attenuated, but

12

I think that's the issue in the case.

13

there's a manufacturing analogy that you're relying on

-

14

here that is not wholly in accord with the way many modern

W

15

business corporations are formulated and with the way they

16

evaluate their own assets.

17

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

It seems to me

Well, the consequences -- the

18

consequences of abandoning the notion that there must, in

19

fact, be a concrete, organic connection between what goes

20

on within the State and what goes on without the State,

21

because under this analysis everything, of course, becomes

22

apportionable, you then have the consequence of throwing

23

everything into the tax base regardless of whether it

24

might have been unitary or not under prior law, and having

25

significant misattributions of income.

For example, suppose we have -- to go back to

1
2

the example we had in the original argument of this case,

3

you have a series of beauty parlors in New Jersey, wholly

4

unrelated parking lots in California.

5

general sense the parking lots are adding to the wealth of

6

the business.

7

Now, in some

There's a connection there.

QUESTION:

Suppose the beauty parlors are not

8

doing well and they borrow money, does it make a

9

difference to taxation whether or not the banker looks at

10

the balance sheet to see that the parking lots are in the

11

balance sheet?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

12

If the corporation goes to a

13

third-party banking institution and borrows based on its

14

overall wealth, it might well make a difference to the

15

bank as to whether or not it was willing to make the loan,

16

but that is precisely the kind of overall attenuated

17

notion that has never been the basis for allowing States

18

to tax income.
We're talking now about income from activity

19
20

such as the parking lot, or the investment, which itself

21

is not generated by any activities in the taxing State.

22

In other words, to go into this parking lot example, what

23

protections or benefits has New Jersey provided to the

24

parking lots in California that would allow it to tax that

25

income?

The Court has always said there must be some

1

2

connection.
Now, you've suggested a loan.

Clearly, if there

3

were interconnections between the parking lot and the

4

beauty parlors that might well justify looking to the

5

entire unitary business, but once you say that any time

6

anything is under a single corporate entity and in some

7

general sense may add to the wealth of the corporation,

8

this is simply abandoning the underlying notions that

9

justify a portion of it in the first place.

10

Why do we -- one thing, why is it the States

11

have been allowed to look outside the State?

12

with a notion that States are confined territorially in

13

their tax power.

14

to the earlier cases, there must be some organic

15

connection because as a limited exception to the principle

16

that States may only tax within the State when in fact

17

there's a connection between what goes on within the State

18

and what goes on outside the State, then the limited

19

purpose of determining the value of what's in the State,

20

it may be appropriate to look outside the State.

21

We start

Now, the original notion was, going back

Then the Court said of course, in cases like

22

Wallace v. Hines and Fargo v. Hart, and in ASARCO and

23

Woolworth, when you're looking outside the State you may

24

not sweep into that tax base these unrelated assets.

reason New Jersey could look outside in the first place

was because of this organic connection.

says, let's abandon any notion of organic connection.

Let's just sweep it all in when it's too difficult.

Now New Jersey

Now, wholly apart from the theoretical flaws in

10
11

New Jersey's approach, the practical consequences of

12

adopting New Jersey's scheme, they're absolutely

13

astounding when you think about the existing structure

14

that's grown up around this Court's understanding of the

15

limits on State taxation.

16

the very distinction that underlies the unitary business

17

principle, namely identifying income that's organically

18

connected and is therefore apportionable because of its

19

link, and income which is nonbusiness, which is not

20

included.

21

Over 30 State laws are based on

All of these - - if this Court were to adopt the

22

notion that New Jersey has advanced here that everything

23

gets swept in simply because it's within the corporation

24

and has some attenuated connection, you have in effect

25

invalidated the laws of 30 States.

Why?

Because this

1

Court has made it clear that taxation by

incommensurate.

Why?

It would lead to inevitable

If New Jersey, for example, can tax the gain

from raw land that this hypothetical corporation has in

Florida, or from investment in an unrelated metal mines

10

corporation, New Jersey gets an apportioned share of that.

11

At the same time, under the existing States' regimes,

Florida would tax 100 percent of it.

QUESTION:

Well, Florida can surely tax the real

estate located in Florida.

That's correct, Chief Justice

Rehnquist, and as a result of that combined with New

2

QUESTION:

A what?

3

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

I was assuming that you had

4

land in Florida and that the land was sold at a gain.

5

Now, Florida would clearly tax 100 percent of that gain

6

because this was land unrelated to any business of the

7

corporation and therefore would be regarded by Florida as

8

nonbusiness income taxable in full in Florida.

9

At the same time, New Jersey, simply because

10

this land was held by the same corporation under a single

11

corporation that owned beauty parlors in New Jersey, they

12

would say this is part of the business, we can tax an

apportioned share of that income.

but there's no terribly fire-strict prohibition against

that sort of multiple taxation, is there?

3

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

this Court has made it clear in cases such as Standard

of a regime of allocation, let us say 100 percent of the

well, because there's some connection between what's going

the tax base by $211 million, and how do we -- what do we

do about that?

That was the pie we started with.

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice.

More than half the States have

22

adopted something called the Uniform Division of Income

intangibles if the acquisition, management, and

3

disposition of the property constitute integral parts of

4

the taxpayer's regular trade or business operation.

5

7
8

Now, do you think that is valid, a valid
concept?
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Justice O'Connor, we are quite

satisfied with that definition, which we believe actually
reflects the longstanding dichotomy that this Court has

10
11

drawn between apportionable and allocable income.
QUESTION:

Do you think that the Constitution

12

allows that but not one step further in terms of defining

13

taxable income?

14

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Justice O'Connor, certainly,

15

as the Constitution has been understood up to today, the

16

understanding is very clear that merely because -- and

17

this is the New Jersey position here -- merely because an

18

asset or income is earned by a single corporation that

1

happens to be doing business in the State, it's absolutely

20

clear that that does not constitute a sufficient

21

connection.

22

Now you're asking the question whether or not

23

the UDITPA definition is one, if stretched a bit, would be

24

satisfactory.

1

the point of oblivion, where you simply look at the

2

corporate purpose, is unsatisfactory.

3

We concede, and we are -- let's say we're

4

sympathetic to certain aspects of your dissent in the

5

ASARCO opinion, with regard to the facts of that case.

6

could well have been that the flows of value between

7

ASARCO and Southern Peru should have justified a different

8

holding on the facts, but not the basic principle which

9

you yourself acknowledge in that decision, namely that

10

there's got to be a unitary business, the linchpin of

11

apportionability.
QUESTION:

It

All right, and do you think UDITPA is

as far as the Constitution will allow, not a step further?

14

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

We believe that UDITPA

15

reflects the constitutional rule.

16

further, there are -- there may be some -- there are some

17

constructions of the business income definition that have

18

gone too far, may have gone too far -- this Court has

19

struck them down -- but certainly not only the

20

definitions, but if you look at the way that the

QUESTION:

What happens under UDITPA?

The

domiciliary State can tax all the intangible income, and

yet if it fits under UDITPA's formula in another State,

6

that other State can have some apportion.

7
8

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

No, Justice O'Connor.

Under

UDITPA the line is drawn, regardless of whether the income
is tangible or intangible, as to whether it is

10

apportionable.

So, for example, if it were working

11

capital, we would concede that under the uniform act it

12

quite clearly would be apportionable.

QUESTION:

But it's not -- if the State -- if

regime, that there will be double taxation in all of the

18

other 49 States, or in some of the other 49 States?

19

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Well, I think the answer to

that, Justice Kennedy, would depend on which State would

have to yield, I would assume, looking, for example, at

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY R. HAMILL

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21

22

23

MS. HAMILL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We are pleased to be asked back to address the

24

Court's questions.

25

there was no need to overrule ASARCO and Woolworth,

As you know, we argued initially that

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

provided that the Court would clarify the statements in

2

ASARCO and Woolworth, that there has to be an operating

3

relationship between the payor and payee of dividend

4

income in order to apportion that income.

5

But if the Court wishes to clear up the

6

confusion and dispel the misconceptions that those

7

opinions have generated, it seems to us that it should

8

overrule the two opinions, and once you get to that

9

point -- and it should do so retroactively.

But once you

10

get to that point, then the question is, where do you draw

11

the line and how do you apportion, and we see no bright

12

line, no clear line until you go all the way to the

13

corporate entity.

14

And so we say that what is received as income by

15

the corporation, by a nondomiciliary corporation that is

16

doing business in the taxing State, should be apportioned

17

by that State, and the reason we believe that is correct

18

is that when there is a common corporate management, there

19

are inevitably going to be flows of value.

20

inevitably going to be mutual interdependence, no matter

21

how disparate these activities seem, the parking lot, the

2

made in beauty parlors in New Jersey and he can generate

4

The permutations of that are infinite, and to

5

ask the lower courts and the taxing authorities to pull

6

apart these very fine, intricate distinctions is really

7

asking too much, and it is getting into the very area that

the Court addressed with the exception to the corn

products -- the corn products exception to the statutory

10

definition of capital assets where we were talking about

12

to further the business, it wasn't a capital asset, and

therefore, it generated an ordinary loss on sale, the

Court saw that problem and got rid of it in Arkansas Best

Let me just turn just a minute to the

2

theoretical basis on which Allied grounds its argument

3

which is that -- the source argument, in that a

4

nondomiciliary State can tax only on a source basis, and

5

that there must be a relationship, a direct relationship

6

between the activities generating the income from

7

out-of-State and what's going on in the taxing State.

8

I don't think you find that in the Court's
cases, except possibly in ASARCO and Woolworth.

I don't

10

think the Court has ever been so explicit, and I don't

11

think that there is any reason why single corporate

12

management couldn't provide that unifying factor that

13

would make it sensible to say that all of the income of a

14

single corporation is unitary income.

15

The property tax cases on which Allied

16

relies -- Fargo v. Hart, Adams Express, Pullman's Palace

17

Car -- are property tax cases and the difference is that

18

they are valuing tangible property in the State, and you

can look at that property.

there is a benchmark, it gets stuck in your craw when you

didn't quite get to, but I know he has 5 minutes, and so I

8

guess I had better -- and I don't have any more time, so

after I sit down -- is the question I think of the chaos.

10

And I think he probably would start with the lack of fair

11

apportionment, that by putting all the income in the base

and then going to the apportionment formula you are going

13

to have terrible, terrible misattributions of income.

14

We don't think that is necessarily true.

We

think that if you make the decision that the intangible is
