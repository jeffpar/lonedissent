ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The main issue in this case is is it

12

constitutional for a State to forcibly medicate a

13

defendant on the claim that he would become incompetent,

14

when there is scarcely any evidence to show that he would

15

become incompetent without the medication, and when his

16

best defense is, in fact his only defense, was that he was

17

insane at the time of the crime.

18

This case also raises the related issue whether

19

it is constitutional for a State to forcibly medicate a

20

capital defendant in the sentencing phase when the two

21

mitigating factors that he was going to present were the

22

fact that (1) he suffers from a mental disease or defect,

23

and (2) whether he shows any remorse.

24

constitutional to forcibly medicate this defendant, did

25

the State use the least restrictive alternative available?

And if it is

Riggins because he was having trouble sleeping and he was

hearing voices.

until it got to be 800 milligrams, which some

psychiatrists say is an almost toxic dose.

Dr. Quass gradually increased the dosage

Did he increase it or did Riggins
I thought that there was something

in the statement here that suggested that Riggins himself

decided he wanted to take more.
MR. YAMPOLSKY:

Mr. Riggins initially asked for

12

Mellaril, and then the dosage was gradually increased by

13

Dr. Quass until it reached the 800-milligram level.

QUESTION:

However, when Mr. Riggins wanted to

Does that answer your question?

Now, do we assume on this record that

the use of the Mellaril was medically appropriate?

I don't believe there was ever

any finding that the use was medically appropriate.

In

Well, did Riggins ever challenge that

below or make an issue of that?
MR. YAMPOLSKY:

11

The only time it was challenged

12

was at the hearing of the motion to terminate medication.

13

At that time, according to Dr. Quass' testimony, Mr.

14

Riggins asked for the Mellaril, and he had the same

15

problems, so Dr. Quass continued the dosage without ever

16

having a finding of what was medically appropriate.

17

QUESTION:

Well, I thought that the petitioner

18

wanted it stopped in order that he could appear before the

19

jury in his natural state, whatever that was.

20

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Not on the basis that the giving of

22

the medication was medically inappropriate for his

23

symptoms.

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

Well, at the hearing for the

termination of administration of medication, there was

testimony from Dr. Quass, who initially prescribed the

2

medication, Drs. O'Gorman, Dr. Masters for the State; and

3

Dr. Jurasky's report was taken into account.

4

never any finding by any judge or any doctor that it was

5

medically appropriate.

6

it seems like Mr. Riggin is groggy -- I believe I'm

7

paraphrasing, but he was closing his eyes, which could

8

suggest that perhaps the dosage he was receiving was not

9

medically appropriate.

10

QUESTION:

There was

In fact, Dr. Master testified that

Well, we have to decide this case on

11

the basis of the record below us -- below.

12

that we would have to consider that whatever was given was

13

at least medically appropriate.

14

ultimate legal question here of whether, nevertheless, the

15

petitioner could have a right to have it stopped.

16

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

And I assumed

That doesn't answer the

Well, according to this Court's

17

decision in Washington v. Harper, there must be a finding

18

for forcible medication that, one, it was medically

19

appropriate, and two, that there was a finding of

20

dangerousness.

21

there was a procedural set of circumstances that was set

22

up where one psychiatrist would prescribe the medication,

23

and then there would be a peer review.

24

procedural safeguards in this case.

In addition, in Washington v. Harper,

petitioner in the Nevada District Court challenge the

giving of this dosage as being medically inappropriate?

Yes or no?

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

QUESTION:

The answer would be no.

Mr. Yampolsky -- I'm sorry, I didn't

mean to interrupt you.

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

That's okay, Justice Souter.

I was going to say maybe I missed the

point, but I'm not sure of your answer to Justice

QUESTION:

So prior to his going into court,

there was no act of the State forcing it upon him.
MR. YAMPOLSKY:

That's correct.

However, after

19

the court's decision, there was a judicial decision that

20

forced the medication upon him at the dosage of 800

21

milligrams, which in the brief of the American Psychiatric

22

Association, says is an extremely high dose, and

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

QUESTION:

I'm unclear, Your Honor.

Does every prisoner in the State of

10

Nevada have to go to the court before he can tell his

11

doctor not to give him medicine?

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

13

QUESTION:

14

competent to tell the doctor?

Is the inference here that he was not

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

15

I don't believe --

No, Your Honor, as a matter of

16

fact, he was found competent.

However, in this case, Mr.

17

Riggins' only defense was insanity, and it appeared that

18

the high level of the Mellaril would be counterproductive,

19

in view of the fact - - as a trial lawyer I was trying to

20

show him in the natural demeanor as he was at the time of

21

the crime -- the fact that he was suffering from a mental

22

disease or defect, in our opinion, which was enough that

23

he didn't understand the difference between good and evil

24

and he didn't understand the nature and quality of his

25

act.

However, he was precluded from presenting this

defense by virtue of the forced medication.
QUESTION:

2

But did the court ever go further

3

than saying I will not order the State to stop

4

administering the medication?

5

did the court order go further and say you must take so

much Mellaril a day?

variety?

8

and enjoin the administration of this medication?

9

Did, to put it another way,

Wasn't the court order of the former

It simply said I - - in effect, I won't intervene

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

Yes, the court order said the

10

motion to terminate administration of medication is

11

denied.
QUESTION:

12

So if he had then said, well, I'm not

13

going to take it, he wouldn't be in violation of the court

order?

order.

Would not have been in violation of the court

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

QUESTION:

Apparently not.

Well, certainly the State knew and

the doctors knew that he wanted the - - when he made the

19

motion, they knew perfectly well that he wanted the

20

medication stopped.

Correct.

And they nevertheless continued to

give it to him.

justified in doing it if he was a danger to himself or

that is the precise issue.

prison system.

QUESTION:

There was never ever any

Mr. Yampolsky, as I understand it,

8

just as you did not argue below, and certainly did not

9

argue in your petition, that the administration was

10

medically inappropriate, so also Nevada did not argue

11

below that -- or in its response to the petition that he

12

could have simply declined to take it on his own.

13

never made that argument, did they?

14

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

15

QUESTION:

They

That's correct.

I certainly don't recall.

I assume

16

that the case is here on the assumption that the drugs

17

were medically -- appropriately medically prescribed -- on

18

the assumption, whether it's true or not, that they were

19

medically prescribed and that the prescription was

20

appropriate, and that he had no choice but to take them.

21

I assumed that that was what we were going to talk about

this morning.

Well, they were prescribed by a

doctor, psychiatrist, Dr. Quass.

of elevating the dosage, but it certainly was elevated.

before.

12

you made in your petition.

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

That's not the point.

You just -- that's not the point

Well, what do you want to introduce

it now for?

17

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

18

QUESTION:

Well, according --

It's not a very interesting question.

19

Of course you can't force somebody to take inappropriate

20

drugs, whether he's a prisoner or not.

a hard legal question at all.
MR. YAMPOLSKY:

I read your question presented again.

I thought your whole point was it was

He wanted to appear insane.

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

QUESTION:

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

I thought that

That is the question --

Well, let's talk about it.
Well, to talk about that,

Justice Scalia, it appears that we need to decide, one, is

we were attempting to stop it.

2

If it was medically inappropriate that would be a separate

issue.

4

maybe it is medically appropriate, maybe it's not.

However, we don't know from the record below us.

And that's what we're attempting to show that

QUESTION:

6

You have half an hour to argue your

7

case, and surely the main thrust of it is the point that

8

the medication was forcibly administered against his
wishes, so why don't you get on with that.
MR. YAMPOLSKY:

10

Your Honor, Mr. Riggins had been

11

suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.

12

to terminate the medication.

13

On that basis he was medicated against his will, and

14

that's why we're here.

15

He moved the court

The court denied his motion.

Mr. Riggins' demeanor was an important part of

16

his testimony.

17

is typically difficult to win.

18

defense that was viable in this case.

after discussing it with Mr. Riggins, was that it would be

in his best legal interest to appear in his natural

demeanor.

QUESTION:

Well, let me put it this way, if it

were medically appropriate, would you be here at all?

It's still ordered, the motion was denied, but it's

medically appropriate.

arguing a constitutional violation?

6

Would you be here nevertheless

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

If it was medically appropriate

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

-- and Mr. Riggins had the right

10

to deny the medically appropriate medication, and by

11

virtue of his --

12

QUESTION:

Well, that's the issue.

13

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

14

QUESTION:

Correct.

Would you still be here arguing that

15

he had the right to deny, even if it were medically

16

appropriate that he be given it?

17

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

Yes, I would be arguing that.

18

Many defendants can waive many constitutional rights:

19

go to trial, the right against self incrimination.

20

what's analogous here, the Faretta decision, where it may

21

not be the wisest choice to act as one's own lawyer, but

he chooses --

Constitution?
MR. YAMPOLSKY:

2

I have two responses to that.

3

One, if this Court recognizes the right to waive one's

4

competence, then yes.

QUESTION:

If this Court -Well, I'm asking you what your

position is as to the law.

7

MR. YAMPOLSKY:

Is it a waivable right?
I believe it is a waivable right

8

in the following Faretta line of cases, that as long as

9

the competent defendant is given a full and fair hearing

10

in which the pitfalls, the problems which could occur are

11

set forth.

12

to waive his right to be tried while competent, I believe

13

he can.

14

And at that time, if he is competent and chose

However, if the court decides that the defendant

15

does not have the ability to waive his right to be tried

16

while competent, then the inquiry must shift gears to show

17

well, what is the level -- the lowest level which is

18

appropriate -- the lowest level of Mellaril that Mr.

Riggins had to ingest to be tried while competent.

Because it's not 800 milligrams because the competency

22

by the court was made when he had 450 milligrams.

milligrams, where he would be competent.

the court of appeals' opinion, or the State, the Supreme

was that you didn't have a constitutional --a special

was just a matter of eventually going to trial.

Harper, but simply to present this trial defense of an

Whether he

on seeing how he'll feel without it, he wants to disagree

He wanted to find

10

They had the hearing and based on the evidence

adduced, the court concluded that the safest course, and

3

MR. TUFTELAND:

I'm not sure what he intended by

that statement.

5

The thrust of his motion was that he had a constitutional

right under the due process clause to appear before the

7

jury in an unmedicated condition.

I just noted that it was in the record.

8

QUESTION:

He at least -- I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

Mr. Tufteland, given the existing

state of the record at the time this motion was filed,

supposing that Mr. Riggins had simply stopped taking the

drug on his own and walked into trial on the trial date

13

without having taken it.

of any court order?

15

MR. TUFTELAND:

Would he have been in violation

No.

There was no court order

16

ever requiring him to be medicated.

17

order entered in this regard was the motion to terminate

18

medication, which was simply denying a defense counsel's

19

motion.

20

authorities brought it to the court's attention or

21

somebody's attention that he was refusing medication, then

something might have occurred.

I think they addressed the

question pretty much as it was presented in the briefs as

to whether or not there was this constitutional right to

for the sake of their decision that the medication was

13

MR. TUFTELAND:

Didn't they basically

Dr. 0'Gorman was not sure.

He

basically would not volunteer an opinion one way or the

So - - then you're saying that we have

Some of them said he most likely would be competent.

MR. TUFTELAND:

QUESTION:

10

Our position would be - -

And why isn't that one?

MR. TUFTELAND:

I think because in this kind of

11

a case, this situation where in Nevada where competency is

jurisdictional and this Court in a number of cases has

indicated that due process requires a person to be

competent when they go to trial.

17

QUESTION:

I don't think we've ever decided,

have we, whether it's waivable?
MR. TUFTELAND:

No, you have not.

But I think

18

that the State's interest in trying people who are

19

competent is so compelling that it should be deemed a

20

right that is not waivable.

21

Basically, when a person goes to trial, we are

22

trying to adjudicate people in a fair proceeding so that

we get verdicts that are reliable and verdicts in which

10
11

The issue itself never came before
So in a sense it's an academic

inquiry.
Mr. Yampolsky had stipulated that it was not

judge to make.

Mr. Tufteland, did the defendant

appear in the trial at any stage of the trial?

MR. TUFTELAND:

He testified at the guilt phase.

What did he say at the guilt phase?
He testified about his

background, explaining when he began hearing voices at the

20

age of 4, and about an abused childhood, about his

21

delusional episodes over the course of his life.
