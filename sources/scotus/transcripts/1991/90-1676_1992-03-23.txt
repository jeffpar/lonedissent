CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. SIMON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIMON:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

The growing awareness of the dangers posed by

11

work on hazardous waste sites to the general public and

12

the environment prompted the Illinois legislature to enact

13

the Illinois Hazardous Waste Crane Operators Licensing Act

14

and the Illinois Hazardous Waste Laborers Licensing Act.

15

These Illinois licensing acts ensure that only

16

qualified competent people engage in these hazardous waste

17

sites in Illinois by demonstrating through training,

18

testing, and experience their competency.

19

Circuit Court of Appeals held the Illinois licensing acts

20

preempted under the OSH Act, the Occupational Safety &

21

Health Act because, in addition to protecting the

22

environment and the public safety, they also protect

23

worker safety -- workers regulated by OSHA.

the Seventh Circuit because Congress did not intend

through the OSH Act to deprive States of their historical

2

power to regulate entry into occupations for the

3

protection of the public.

4

to find that the OSH Act does not preempt any supplemental

5

State regulation, I would like first to draw this Court's

6

attention to the fact that the OSH Act does not preempt

7

dual purpose legislation where the State has a purpose in

8

addition to the worker safety for protecting the public

9

and for protecting the environment.

10

While we also urge this Court

Every other court of appeals and the

11

Occupational Safety and Health Administration itself

12

have - - they have considered the question of whether the

13

OSH Act preempts State licensing acts, have limited the

14

preemptive effect of OSHA, and have found OSHA only

15

preempts purely workers' health and safety matters.

16

does not extend to preempt matters which have as a purpose

17

or effect the promotion of public health and safety and

18

the protection of the environment.

Mr. Simon, I suppose Illinois could

Illinois does not wish to

Illinois is only concerned with

Well, under your view it sounds like

10

section 18(a) is just superfluous because Illinois can

11

adopt these regulations in any event.
MR. SIMON:

12

I believe the section -- the purpose

13

of section 18 is to provide a mechanism whereby States may

14

displace Federal standards and Federal enforcement and a

15

mechanism by which the Secretary and the Federal

16

Government can grant money to the States --

It would appear that that's just

superfluous under your reading.

2

conflict with OSHA's regulations.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

What's the implication if OSHA has

adopted regulations that are in conflict?
MR. SIMON:

Your regulations may conflict.

We

6

have to examine your regulations next to the OSHA

7

regulations and if they do conflict, then your regulations

8

are preempted, and that's exactly how we think that the

9

Illinois licensing acts should be judged.

10
11

If they

conflict with an OSHA standard, they are preempted.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't Illinois require 4,000

12

hours of experience for a license holder in some area of

13

this hazardous waste business, whereas the OSHA

14

requirement would be 40?

15

MR. SIMON:

That's correct.

OSHA actually does

16

not require any experience hours.

17

training hours.

18

operators, hazardous waste crane operators, does contain a

19

4,000-hour requirement.

20

OSHA only requires

The Illinois licensing act for crane

The 4,000-hour requirement serves the legitimate

21

public purpose of ensuring that crane operators don't

The OSHA

conflict under this Court's preemption jurisprudence.

2

The --

3

QUESTION:

Well, certainly there is a very

4

arguable negative implication, Mr. Simon, from subsection

5

(a) that where there is an OSHA standard in effect there

6

is preemption.

•

7

-

MR. SIMON:

And that's a negative implication.

8

This Court has found, however, in its jurisprudence that

9

if you're going to have express preemption it has to be

10

expressed, and if you're going to have implied preemption

11

the structure and the language -of the act and the purpose

12

of the act have to support that - - that inference - - and

13

in this case the structure, language and purpose do not

14

support that.

15

The purpose of the OSHA act is to provide for

16

every working man and woman in the Nation a safe and

17

healthful conditions of work.

18

eliminate duplicative regulation or to remove from

19

jurisdiction areas of State concern.

20
21

QUESTION:

The purpose is not to

So you say we should analyze this

case as one of implied preemption, not express preemption.

22

MR. SIMON:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.

You still are saying, though -- I

still -- I don't entirely understand your response to

25

Justice O'Connor as to subsection (a).

1

nqthing in the chapter prevents any State agency from

2

asserting jurisdiction under State law over any

3

occupational safety or health issue with respect to which

4

a standard is in effect.

There is jurisdiction even when

5

a standard is in effect.

The only thing you cannot do is

6

contradict it, right -- is conflict with it?

7
8

9

MR. SIMON:
with a standard.

That's right.

You cannot conflict

That's all that section says.

QUESTION:

Well that -- it doesn't say that.

I

10

mean, the section says nothing shall prevent any State

11

from asserting jurisdiction with respect -- over any issue

12

with respect to which no standard is in effect.

13

they say that?

14

MR. SIMON:

Why would

I think that section 18 of the act

15

is explaining to States how they can -- that they

16

should -- it's encouraging States to come in and take a

17

role in the occupational area, and it's saying where

18

there's no Federal standard in place you're not precluded

19

by any -- I would make an analogy to a dormant commerce

20

clause type thing.

21

There's no - - because OSHA has not worked here

22

we're not saying that therefore it's precluded to States.

23

Go ahead and do it.

24

there's nothing there, and where there is something there

25

then we'll look to whether there's a conflict.

You're not in conflict because

I think

1

that that's a fair reading of this section 18(a).

2

that section 18(a) does not expressly say or expressly

3

preempt supplemental State laws.

4

QUESTION:

I think

I think that the --

Why would a State proceed under (b)

5

if it -- why would a State want to proceed under (b), that

6

is, assume its own responsibility for development and

7

enforcement of health standards with respect to which a

8

Federal standard already exists?

9

MR. SIMON:

Two good reasons.

One of them is

10

that they then displace the Federal regulations and the

11

Federal enforcement, and they do that themselves.

12

second -- and States who were sensitive to being told what

13

to do by the Federal Government would enjoy this control

14

over their own occupational safety and health concerns.

15

QUESTION:

The

But you're telling us that the

16

Federal Government doesn't control it anyway.

17

saying even without going into subsection (b) a State can

18

supplement the Federal regulation any way that it wants.

MR. SIMON:

You're

But it may not conflict with the

Government.

Any Federal regulation as its written, as its

QUESTION:

Well, you don't think that OSHA's

going to let any plan that they approve conflict with

Federal regulation either, do you?

3

matter they're not going to get anything approved under
(b)

that conflicts with the Federal regulations.
MR. SIMON:

The OSHA regulations then do not

4

apply in a State with a State plan.

5

apply in a State --

6

QUESTION:

The State regulations

I understand that, but I think it

7

most unlikely that OSHA is going to approve any State plan

8

that conflicts with a Federal regulation.

9

approve some that supplement it, but I can't imagine that

10
11

They may

they're going to approve any that conflict with it.
MR. SIMON:

When you say conflict with it, I

12

believe you mean anything that provides less safety

13

protection for the employees --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SIMON:

16
17

Right.

Right.

And that's correct, but you may

provide more protection in a different way.
QUESTION:

But you don't have to go in under (b)

18

to do that.

19

You can let them spend their enforcement money, and if you

20

want anything in addition, you just issue supplemental

21

reg -- there's no reason to use (b).

22

You can let the Feds issue their regulations.

MR. SIMON:

The second reason is the grant to

23

the States, which is a very important reason, I submit,

24

that the State that submits a State plan gets 90 percent

25

of the cost of developing a State plan from the Federal

1

Government and it gets 50 percent of the cost of operating

2

a State plan from the Federal Government, which is a very-

3

powerful motivation, and that was the motivation that

4

Congress offered here to encourage the States to submit

5

the State plans, was the Federal money.
QUESTION:

6

May I ask on that point, if there's

7

no Federal -- excuse me.

8

in effect in, say -- in an area, and the State wanted to

9

develop its own plan under (a), could it get Federal money

10

doing that?
MR. SIMON:

11
12

Not under the -- not as I read the

grants to the States.

13
14

If there's no Federal standard

QUESTION:

Only if they're replacing a Federal

standard.

15

MR. SIMON:

If they're submitting a State plan,

16

and they only submit a State plan if they want to regulate

17

a matter regulated by OSHA.

MR. SIMON:
QUESTION:

Yes.
You have really an identical problem

in explaining the provisions of 667(h), do you not?

I

don't understand what the necessity for 667(h), the first
clause, is under your view.
MR. SIMON:

667(h) gives the Secretary authority

to allow a State to enforce less restrictive State
standards even after Federal standards are in place while
the State is attempting to come into compliance and get
its State plan approved by the Secretary.

So we're not

trying to enforce less restrictive State requirements.

We

want OSHA to continue to enforce the OSH requirements in
Illinois.
QUESTION:

But it doesn't say less restrictive,

and if it's less restrictive -- is it your view that a
less restrictive legislation would displace an OSHA
regulation?
' MR. SIMON:

If it conflicts with it, certainly

it would -- no, a less restrictive regulation on the
subject, if OSHA says that workers have to wear helmets
and States say they have to wear goggles, workers can't do
both, certainly the OSHA requirement supersedes the State
requirement, but under (h) the Secretary could agree that
that State could just require goggles.
Section (h)

-- it says that the Secretary may

enter into an agreement with the State under which the

2

State will be permitted to continue to enforce one or more

3

occupational health and safety standards in effect in such

4

State until final action is taken.

5

went back and looked at the legislative history and found

6

that an earlier draft had said that the Secretary could

agree that they could enforce more restrictive argument.

The Seventh Circuit

When they took out the more restrictive, now (h)

12

sense because they don't want -- if the State's going to

13

have a State plan, it's going to have State standards,

14

there's no sense making them adjust to the Federal for

15

2 years until their plan goes back and then they can go

16

back to their own plan.

17
18

The Secretary can agree to that.

QUESTION:

MR. SIMON:

20

approval is pending.

22

It is not -- and it makes

So under your view, the Secretary can

agree to suspend OSHA regulations under (h).

have any more continuing effect.
QUESTION:

Well, did it expire in '72, or was

3

that the minimum period of its application.

4

applied whenever a State government proposed a supplanting

5

plan of its own.

6

MR. SIMON:

I thought it

I think the terms of it state

7

specifically what the answer to that question is, and I

8

thought it was set --

9

QUESTION:

It's at the bottom of page 12 of your

10

appendix, of your blue brief.

11

QUESTION:

At page 12 and 13 of the appendix it

12

says that the period covered would be until final action

13

is taken by the Secretary with respect to a plan submitted'

14

by a State under subsection (b), or 2 years from

15

December 29, 197 -- ah, whichever is earlier.

16

MR. SIMON:

Okay.

The Illinois licensing acts which

17

promote public safety and environmental protection in

18

addition to occupational safety should not be preempted by

19

the OSH Act.

20

some cases, the Court nevertheless should not preempt a

21

dual purpose statute like licensing acts.

22

rather consider whether it has a legitimate purpose and

23

whether it has selected a means which is plausibly related

24

to that legitimate purpose.

25

approach of the other circuit courts that have addressed

The -- if this Court does find preemption in

It should

This squares with the

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

this issue and it also squares with this Court's precedent

2

and jurisprudence in preemption cases.

3

The case that I'm thinking of where I drew this

4

test from is the Northwest Pipeline case, where this Court

5

recognized the permissible purpose of regulating

6

production of natura‘1 gas and this Court recognized an

7

impermissible purpose of regulating the sale and

8

transmission of natural gas in interstate commerce.

9

The Kansas statute in that case this Court found

10

had a permissible purpose of regulating production and a

11

means which plausibly was related to that purpose, and it

12

affirmed the validity of that Kansas regulation

13

notwithstanding the fact that it impacted on the sale and

14

transmission of natural gas in interstate commerce, the

15

area prohibited.

16

The Illinois licensing acts similarly have a

17

permissible purpose.

18

rights to regulate its environment in public safety.

19
20

QUESTION:

MR. SIMON:

22

QUESTION:

24
25

But the reason you regulate entry

into this occupation is partly for safety, is it not?

21

23

Clearly OSHA did not preempt States

That's correct.
But you say it's a different kind of

safety than OSHA is supposed to provide.
MR. SIMON:

The occupational -- OSHA regulates

occupational safety exclusively.

The Secretary of Labor

1

has in fact disclaimed any responsibility or any authority

2

to regulate public health and safety or the environment,

3

yet public health and safety and environmental concerns

4

are clearly present on hazardous waste sites and Illinois

5

is attempting to address these concerns which also further

6

OSHA's purpose of worker safety with these licensing acts

7

by requiring competency in the individuals that engage in

8

these professions.

9

•

QUESTION:

So what is Illinois getting in

10

addition to what OSHA gets by these regulations, say at a

11

hazardous waste site?
MR. SIMON:

12

Illinois gets -- one, that it gets a

13

superior form of enforcement, because it's very easy to

14

enforce.

15

Licensing acts are a superior means -QUESTION:

Yes, but you could say that about an

16

Illinois regulation governing the work place, that you

17

require 4,000 hours and we require more than OSHA does,

18

but I think that would be very arguably preemptive.

19

MR. SIMON:

I think that the -- Illinois, when

20

it's regulating its environment, is not limited to accept

21

what OSHA does to regulate workers, and Illinois here

22

wants a licensing scheme because that's the way in which

23

Illinois historically regulates public safety for

24

professionals.

25

QUESTION:

But who benefits from the Illinois

1

regulation that wouldn't benefit from the OSHA

2

regulations?

3

MR. SIMON:

The Illinois regulation -- I believe

4

the public benefits more from the Illinois regulation, and

5

I believe the environment benefits more from the Illinois

6

regulation.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SIMON:

MR. BLISS:

Absolutely, and a path is set for

3

the State to do that precisely by submitting a plan for

approval by the Secretary of Labor.
That will ensure the Secretary of Labor will

have to review it and ensure that it is at least as

7

effective as the Federal standard, and in the face of

8

products in interstate commerce the Secretary will have to

9

make the judgment whether it's necessary to meet local

10

compelling conditions and does

not pose an undue burden

11

on interstate commerce under section 18(c).
All of that would be rendered meaningless if the

standard relating to an issue addressed by a Federal

standard they must do it through the planned process.

3

OSHA leaves the States three options.

They can

4

regulate in areas where there is no Federal standard.

5

They can regulate the environment and public safety

6

directly and not by the means of regulating corporate

7

health and safety, or they can submit a State plan.

8

have three alternatives.

9

They

In this case, Illinois has rejected all three

10

alternatives and done the one thing that section 18 would

11

deny it, namely to regulate piecemeal in an area without a

12

State plan where there is a Federal standard already in

13

place, and indeed in this case the second question that

•

14

the Seventh Circuit would ask is does the State standard

15

regulating worker occupational safety relate to an issue,

16

and OSHA can define that issue with an effort to

17

accommodate federalism.

18

•As you know, under Federal executive order OSHA

19

seeks to try to accommodate the State's interest to the

20

greatest extent possible and can define the standard in a

21

narrow way so as not to intrude on general purpose or

22

obligation State laws, and here, however, the issue is the

23

regulation of hazardous waste workers at hazardous waste

24

sites, which is precisely the issue that Illinois

25

addresses.

Indeed, Illinois statute is more narrow than

1

the OSHA standard, because it doesn't apply to all the

2

hazardous waste sites that would be subject to the Federal

3

standard.

4

Finally, the Seventh Circuit through its

5

severability analysis would seek to preserve those

6

elements of the State law which regulate the environment

7

or other issues that are not directly and substantially

8

impacting the operation of the Federal law.

9

On the dual purpose regulation issue, what we

10

have in this case is all the public benefit that Illinois

11

ascribes to its State laws derived from workers' safety.

12

It's only when you hire a crane operator who has 4,000

13

hours of experience, and that crane operator presumably

14

then operates safely and has fewer accidents, that there

15

may be a public benefit that flows from that, so that the

16

public benefits attributed to the Illinois statute are

17

exclusively derived from the workers' safety practices

18

which are precisely what is regulated by OSHA, and that's

19

why this law must be preempted.

20

In conclusion, the Illinois acts constitute

21

worker health and safety standards that address the very

22

same topics -- training, experience, competency and

23

certification -- that are addressed comprehensively by the

24

OSHA standard.

1

Therefore, under section 18, Illinois may not duplicate or

2

supplement the OSHA standard without filing a State plan.

3

Illinois claims an exemption from this process

4

merely because it has asserted an additional public

5

purpose for what is plainly worker-oriented, narrow

6

legislation, but as*I've mentioned, the public benefits

7

from the Illinois training and experience provisions are

derived solely from safe conduct in the work place, which

is precisely the issue addressed by OSHA.

MR. KELLEY:

implicit, and what you might call occupation of the field,

where the text does not give you any particular indication

of preemption except in the sense that it demonstrates

such a total regulation of the area that you are willing

14

to leap to the conclusion of preemption.

15

MR. KELLEY:

Your Honor, we would not object to

16

that.

17

on the States theory, a State would be entitled to

18

entirely duplicate the Federal scheme and enforce it

19

alongside the Federal scheme, and it seems to us that that

20

is inconsistent with what Congress enacted in the act.

21

seems plain that the act envisions one enforcement

22

authority, and only one, once OSHA has acted, and the

State has the option to reassert its authority if it

wishes under the State plan process.

MR. SIMON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

when he.was saying he's asking the Court to create a new

10

category of preemption, and I really think that the

State -- that this Court's jurisprudence on preemption has

12

been clear that you're not to preempt -- that Congress

13

does not preempt State law unless there was the clear --

14

its clear manifest purpose, and it say so expressly, or if

it is evident under the categories of implied peremption

consistently followed.

18

I think that to create a new category of

19

inferred express preemption would not only create

20

confusion in the jurisprudence of the Court, but it would

21

certainly expand the preemptive effect of Federal

regulations, and we would have lower courts preempting

The Illinois licensing acts are a historic

exercise -- or, an exercise of the State's historic police

3

power to protect the public and the environment, and this

4

means of requiring competency for those engaged in these

5

hazardous occupations is a longstanding mechanism to

6

accomplish its public safety purpose, and it was not the

7

intent of Congress in enacting the OSHA act to preclude

8

States from pursuing this means to protect the public

9

safety.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Simon, you haven't -- one of the

11

things that troubles me about the State's position here is

12

I don't understand why 667(c) (2) would be so concerned

13

about making sure that any plan that the Secretary

14

approves will not unnecessarily disrupt interstate

15

commerce.

16

MR. SIMON:

17

QUESTION:

66 -667(c)(2), which are the conditions

18

for approval of the plan, and it says the Secretary has to

19

make sure that the plan won't needlessly -- when

20

applicable to products which are distributed and used and

21

they are required by compelling local conditions and they

22

do not unduly burden interstate commerce.

That is one of

That seems very strange, to put that next to a
system which says, however, if you don't want to have a

State plan, you can burden State commerce all you like,

2

regardless of local conditions, up to the point where the

3

commerce clause is violated.

4

MR. SIMON:

The section that you just read

5

starts out with when -- it talks about products in

6

interstate commerce, so we talk about -- we're dealing

7

with products there.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SIMON:

Right.
The Illinois hazardous wastes

10

licensing acts do not deal with products whatsoever.

11

don't think that (c)(2)

12

QUESTION:

--

Oh, I'm not saying it applies to your

13

act, but it does go to whether the whole act should be

14

interpreted as preemptive or not.

15

MR. SIMON:

I

I believe that a product --a

16

requirement on a product to be manufactured differently

17

than the product is required in all of the other States, I

18

believe that that would be a conflict, and I believe that

19

what they're saying there is that under a State plan where

20

the States are entitled to enact conflicting legislation

21

if the Secretary agrees that it provides at least as much

22

worker safety, they're saying except with regard to

23

products in interstate commerce.

25

Those products, the Secretary cannot approve
them if they're going to create a conflict because those
