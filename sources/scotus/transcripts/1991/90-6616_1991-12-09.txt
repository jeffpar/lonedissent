ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH J. ROSE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROSE:

s

We'll hear argument

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
James Stringer was convicted and sentenced to

11

die in Hinds County, Mississippi for a killing during the

12

commission of an attempted robbery.

13

statutory aggravating circumstances, one of which was the

14

especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating

15

circumstance.

16

aggravating circumstances were not outweighed by

17

mitigating circumstances.

18

affirmed Mr. Stringer's conviction and sentence after a

19

review of the aggravating circumstances.

20

The jury found three

The jury then found that statutory

The Mississippi supreme court

The court below, the United States Court of

21

Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, again affirmed Mr.

22

Stringer's sentence, relying on what it perceived to be

23

Mississippi's rule of automatic affirmance.

24

where there's at least one valid aggravating circumstance,

25

despite the fact that the jury may have also relied on an

That is,

1

invalid or unconstitutional aggravating circumstance, the

2

Mississippi supreme court would automatically affirm the

3

sentence of death without individualized review.

4

This Court vacated Mr. Stringer's sentence and

5

remanded the case for further consideration in light of

6

Clemons v. Mississippi.

7

the sentence, this time relying upon the nonretroactivity

8

of Clemons v. Mississippi and Maynard v. Cartwright.

9

Clemons and Maynard represent no new law.

The Fifth Circuit again affirmed

We rely on two

10

fundamental principals central to this Court's Eighth

11

Amendment jurisprudence.

12

QUESTION:

Counsel, just at the outset, and you

13

can just do it in the course of your oral argument, but it

14

seems to me the briefs don't meet very well.

15

is arguing that even if Clemons was dictated by Godfrey as

16

to the content of the aggravating factor, Mississippi

17

wasn't the kind of State that Georgia was or that Florida

18

was or that Oklahoma was.

19

in your brief.

20

argument you'll make that clear what your position is.

Mississippi

y

21

And that I didn't see addressed

So I hope during the course of your

MR. ROSE:

Your Honor, I could go ahead and

22

address that now.

23

it is a State like Florida, that is, it requires a finding

24

of at least one statutory aggravating circumstance, and

25

then the jury is required to weigh statutory aggravating

Mississippi has always contended that

1

circumstances against all mitigating circumstances, and

2

the jury is required to make a unanimous finding that

3

statutory aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by

4

mitigating circumstances.

5

to Florida and has relied upon Florida law in several

6

cases; Coleman v. State, Evans v. State, Gilliard v.

7

State.
The State contends that Mississippi is not like

8

9

Mississippi has compared itself

Florida, because it says that there is a narrowing done in

10

Mississippi at the definition of capital murder.

Our

11

contention is even if that is true, even if Mississippi

12

has defined capital murder in a way similar to Texas where

13

it makes a subclass of persons that may have committed

14

murders eligible for the sentencing phase, that is

15

not -- that does not solve the constitutional problem,

16

because Mississippi then allows vague statutory

17

aggravating circumstances to be relied upon by the

18

sentencer, and puts emphasis on those circumstances.

19

In order to be eligible for the death penalty in

20

Mississippi, you have -- the jury must make that unanimous

21

finding that aggravating circumstances are not outweighed

22

by mitigating circumstances.

23

has allowed a vague aggravating circumstance to be

24

considered and relied upon by the jury is a constitutional

25

violation.

So the fact that Mississippi

QUESTION:

But of course, the further question

2

is whether or not that's a new rule under Teague.

3

seems to me that Mississippi makes an important point that

4

it has to be - - that you have to counter when it says that

5

this simply was not anticipated as of the time of Clemons

6

because of the differences in the States,

7

States' sentencing schemes.

8
9

MR. ROSE:

And it

in the two

Your Honor, Florida has narrowing.

And I think that's a -- that may be a misconception that

10

Mississippi has narrowing, Florida does not.

11

there's balancing in Mississippi and in Florida.

12

has narrowing by the initial finding of an aggravating

13

circumstance.

14

definition of capital murder or by the initial finding of

15

a statutory aggravating circumstance.

16

require a weighing.

17

that both have some initial narrowing.

18

require aggravating circumstances -- statutory aggravating

19

circumstances to play a central role.

20

And then
Florida

Mississippi has narrowing either by the

But then they both

So they're similar in the respect
But then they both

And if - - this Court has always held that if a

21

statutory aggravating circumstance is vague, even if it's

22

at that point where it's determining eligibility for the

23

death sentence, where aggravating circumstances are

24

weighed with mitigating circumstances, then there's

25

constitutional error.

This Court held in Zant where there was an

1
2

initial narrowing by an aggravating circumstance, a valid

3

aggravating circumstance, that there still needed to be an

4

individualized determination of the effect of an

5

unconstitutional aggravating circumstance.

6

accepted Georgia's representation that the effect was

7

inconsequential in Georgia because statutory aggravating

8

circumstances played no special role under the

9

Georgia - - played no role under the Georgia scheme beyond

10

And this Court

the initial narrowing.
So the problem in Mississippi and the problem in

11
12

Georgia that the Court discussed in Zant that was a cause

13

of constitutional error in Zant was not that there was no

14

narrowing at all; the problem was that there a

15

consideration by the jury of a vague statutory aggravating

16

circumstance that introduced an arbitrary and capricious

17

factor.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Rose, I understand Mississippi

19

says it relied on Zant.

Clemons has been decided.

We

20

know that Mississippi is a different situation from

21

Georgia in that respect.

22

Teague, I think you have to show that Mississippi was not

23

entitled to rely on Zant, that, if you would, come as a

24

surprise or whatever Teague said.

25

the two systems are somewhat different I don't think

But so far as a new rule under

And to simply show that

suffices.
MR. ROSE:

2

Your Honor, I would agree.

I

3

think -- I think that first of all, Godfrey said that you

4

cannot consider vague aggravating circumstances.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's your Maynard point,

6

that's not your Clemons point, to go back to the Fifth

7

Circuit's analysis.

8

MR. ROSE:

9

Your Honor, our Clemons point is that

there must be some individualized cure once the sentencer

10

has considered a vague statutory aggravating circumstance.

11

And that has always been the case. That was the case even

12

in Georgia, where the statutory aggravating circumstance,

13

the vague statutory aggravating circumstance played no

14

role.

15

individualized review and this Court approved Georgia's

16

application of its statute in part because it did require

17

some individualized review.

18

So our position is that Georgia required

QUESTION:

You know, that probably shows your

19

case is different from Zant, but I think you have to go

20

further in Teague and show that Clemons was not a new

21

rule.

22

MR. ROSE:

Yes, Your Honor, we do have to show

23

Clemons is not a new rule.

And I think we can.

24

if you look at California v. Ramos as just an example,

25

this Court said that there had to be some

I think

the factors that the sentencer can consider in determining

3

whether death is the appropriate punishment.

4

what those substantive limitations are.

5

limitations are consideration of eight factors.

apart from any consideration of the narrowing rule, the

initial narrowing rule that every statute must provide.

And it says

It says those

In other words, there's a procedural requirement

there are some substantive limitations on

that every death penalty statute must be, and that is it

penalty.

12

a myriad of factors in determining punishment.

14

known it since California v. Ramos, one factor it may not

allow juries to consider are vague aggravating

circumstances.

introduces an arbitrary and capricious factor into the

pretty soon, I guess.

MR. ROSE:

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- I'll go on

to Clemons.

5
6

But you're going to get to Clemons

QUESTION:

That's all right.

I just thought you

were about to talk about Clemons.

7

MR. ROSE:

Clemons had stated that there is some

8

requirement of individualized review.

And in particular,

9

it said a weighing State may allow the State appellate

10

court to either reweigh or apply a harmless error analysis

11

as long as there is some individualized review of the

12

facts and circumstances of the case.

13

That has been in the rules since Eddings, Zant, and

14

Barclay.

That is not new law.

In Barclay, for example, this Court reviewed an

15
16

invalid aggravating circumstance that was not

17

constitutionally invalid, but was invalid as a matter of

18

State law.

19

question was whether the invalid aggravating circumstance

20

so infected the balance in process created by the Florida

21

statute that it was constitutionally impermissible to

22

allow the sentence to stand.

23

individualized review, because it looks at the statute,

24

the Florida statute, the balancing process that has been

25

established, and it requires the State appellate court to

This Court said in Barclay that the critical

Now that requires

1

do some individualized consideration of the factors that

2

were presented in the court below.

3

QUESTION:

Do you deduce all of that just from

4

that one sentence in Barclay?

5

MR. ROSE:

Your Honor, no, sir.

There was more

6

language in Barclay.

They talked about Barclay applying a

7

harmless error test.

They considered the fact that there

8

were no mitigating circumstances introduced in Barclay,

9

and said that the court, the Florida court did do

10

individualized review and said that was what was

11

important.

12

our position that said what is required is some

13

individualized review -- some individualized consideration

14

of the facts and circumstances of the case.

15

The specific language in Barclay that supports

The vast majority of State and Federal courts

16

since Zant and Barclay have understood the required

17

analysis. They've understood first you had to determine

18

whether or not there were vague aggravating circumstances

19

employed in the sentencing determination.

20

then the court had to do some determination,

21

individualized determination of the effect of those

22

aggravating circumstances.

23

consideration had to also include a consideration of the

24

mitigating factors that were introduced in the court

25

below.

If there were,

That individualized

Mississippi has done none of that.

(800) FOR DEPO

And it stands

1

alone in doing none of that until Clemons.
This Court's decisions on retroactivity during

2

3

the last 3 or 4 years had one unifying theme, and that is

4

similarly situated persons must be treated alike.

5

that reason it's particularly important that the two basic

6

principles that James Stringer asked to be applied in his

7

case have already been applied in a postconviction

8

context.

9

And for

In Parker v. Dugger, this Court applied in a

10

postconviction context the principle that there must be

11

some individualized review of error.

12

of whether there was error.

13

yes, there is error under State law, and apparently did

14

not apply an individualized review, either a harmless

15

error test or a reweighing.

16

minimum some individualized review is required applying

17

the principles in Clemons.

18

that James Stringer seeks to have applied in his case.

19

has already been applied in a postconviction context.

20

There was a question

The State of Florida said

And this Court said that at a

That is the same principle
It

Secondly, in Lewis v. Jeffers, this Court

21

applied the basic principal that James Stringer seeks to

22

have applied in this case -- in his case, and that is you

23

cannot use a vague statutory aggravating circumstance in

24

determining sentence.

25

Jeffers was on the periphery.

Now, the question again in Lewis v.
Well, had Arizona developed

1

a case law that has narrowed the construction of its

2

equivalent of the especially heinous, atrocious or cruel

3

aggravating circumstance in such a manner that it was not

4

applied in a vague way.

5

question yes.

6

vague statutory aggravating circumstances was accepted and

7

there was no debate that that principle should be applied

8

in Lewis v. Jeffers.

9

And the Court answered that

But the basic principle that you cannot use

In conclusion, this Court was right to apply on

10

habeas review the long-established principles that were

11

the premise for Cartwright and Clemons, including that the

12

sentencer cannot rely upon vague statutory aggravating

13

circumstances.

14

circumstances, there must be some type of individualized

15

review by the State appellate court to cure the error.

16

That was a law - - that is the law now and that was clearly

17

the law in 1985 when James Stringer's conviction became

18

final.

And if the sentencer does rely on such

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. WHITE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In Gregg and in Zant both, this Court stated

1

that each distinct scheme for imposing the sentence of

2

death on a defendant must be examined on an individual

3

basis, and that's what we're asking you to do with the

4

Mississippi scheme here.

5

that is before the Court today, that is whether Clemons or

6

Maynard are to be retroactively applied, we must examine

7

how the Mississippi statutory scheme works and operates in

8

the imposition of a death sentence.

9

scheme found in Mississippi is almost unique.

In order to answer the question

This is because the
There's

10

only one other State that has a statute like that, and

11

that is Louisiana.

Louisiana?

MR. WHITE:

15

QUESTION:

16

And was Lowenfield v. Phelps from

Yes, ma'am -- yes, Your Honor.
And did we say there that only one

narrowing procedure is constitutionally required?

17

MR. WHITE:

You said that, there in Lowenfield,

18

that - - and I interpreted as saying yes - - that in

19

Lowenfield that the Constitution -- the last sentence of

20

the opinion says that the narrowing, constitutional

21

narrowing is done by the finding of guilt of one of the

22

narrowly defined crimes, and the Constitution requires no

23

more.

25

QUESTION:

So then, the State is permitted to

use vague aggravating circumstances thereafter if it wants

to, is that the theory you offer?
MR. WHITE:

The -- that is not the theory.

That

3

the -- it does not infringe on the Constitution to have

4

those aggravating circumstances if they're even vaguely

5

defined in comparison with Godfrey even, or Zant, I should

6

say, is that --

7

QUESTION:

Well, your position is that they can

8

be vague, and under a standard that you would apply to a

9

constitutional inquiry, but still stand up.

10

MR. WHITE:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

That's correct.
That's your -- so that Maynard

doesn't apply at all.
MR. WHITE:

That's correct.

And because as in

14

Johnson v. Thigpen, as the Fifth Circuit found, and as we

15

have argued contrary to counsel opposite, that we have

16

always said we were like Florida, we have not.

17

decision in Johnson v. Thigpen would not be there had we

18

argued otherwise.

19
20

QUESTION:

Well, in this case it was still

necessary to find an aggravating circumstance.

21

MR. WHITE:

22

QUESTION:

23

The

That's correct, under State law.
Yes, and so the jury had to find an

aggravating circumstance.

MR. WHITE:

That's correct.
In addition to the narrowing.

MR. WHITE:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And you say the jury could

3

be - - could satisfy that requirement by finding an

4

aggravating circumstance that's just plain outright vague.

5
6

MR. WHITE:

That's correct, because it's not

constitutionally required.

7

QUESTION:

Well, your brother, I think --

8

QUESTION:

But the State law requires it.

9

MR. WHITE:

10

QUESTION:

That's correct.
I think your brother is arguing that

11

you've got a two-step narrowing procedure, and he is

12

saying, at least I think he's saying implicitly, that if

13

you do employ a two-step narrowing procedure, the

14

standards applicable to, we'll say the second step, should

15

be the same applicable to the first and there's nothing

16

new about applying a given standard.

17

different about your situation is that you have a two-step

18

process rather than a one-step process.

19

MR. WHITE:

The only thing

Well, if in Lowenfield -- and the

20

Mississippi statute operates as does the Louisiana

21

statute -- if the narrowing -- that all the Constitution

22

requires is that narrowing to limit the class of people

23

for who the death penalty may be imposed is

24

constitutionally completed or established by the finding

25

of guilt of one of the narrowly defined crimes -- and

also have to meet the same test as the narrowing factors

QUESTION:

Of course you didn't argue that in

Clemons and we didn't address it in Clemons.
MR. WHITE:

You didn't address it in Clemons.

It is argued not as forcefully as it is here, but it was

10

argued that the aggravating circumstances in Mississippi

11

do not have the same constitutional significance as they

12

do in Georgia, Florida, and Oklahoma.

13

argument is made there in Clemons, and it was made before

that in Johnson v. Mississippi.

QUESTION:

That as I say, the

It would seem that if it were a

16

matter of a new rule of the significance you say, that we

17

would have addressed it in Clemons.

18

MR. WHITE:

Probably so, but we weren't

19

discussing, I don't think, new rules at that point, of

20

whether this was a new ruling.

21

started off its opinion by saying, that we are now

22

addressing the question that we left open in Zant.

23

I think that is almost a total answer of the question

24

whether it's a new rule or not there, because if the Court

25

has never spoken to this issue and they speak to it, and

Clemons, as the Court

1

that's what the Court said, the opinion says in Clemons,

we now address that question we left open in Zant.

our court had been relying on Zant all this time in doing

so.

5

do it another way, that you have to do a reweighing or a

6

harmless error analysis now instead of just what you have

7

been doing under Zant --or relying on Zant in doing that.

And now Clemons comes down and says that you have to

8
9

So the -- of course as we said, the aggravating
factors under the Mississippi statute act as actually a

10

second filter that's not constitutionally required, and of

11

course, reading Lowenfield, I think it is consistent with

12

the way the Mississippi statute operates is that these

13

aggravating factors take on a different significance under

14

the Mississippi statute -- under the Louisiana statute

15

than they do in Georgia, Florida, and Oklahoma.

factor -- photographs, the argument, everything in

support.

Even had it not been denoted an aggravating

11

Mississippi does allow for the consideration of

nonstatutory aggravating factors, they have to find the

others, but the jury can certainly consider those.

They have said in Jordan v. State, and just most

can't rest the death penalty solely on that as a finding

Furman.

QUESTION:

5

that point because?

6

MR. ROSE:

And Lowenfield is not controlling on

Your Honor, Lowenfield is not at all

7

controlling, and that has no relevance to the question,

8

because Lowenfield just defines the point where there has

9

to be -- what is constitutionally permitted for a State to

10

do.

Louisiana was permitted to use the equivalent of

11

aggravating circumstances at the definitional stage of

12

first-degree murder.

13

Lowenfield does not address what has happened in

14

Mississippi, and that is - - and in this case -- and that

15

is after the initial narrowing stage is met, there is then

16

injected a vague statutory aggravating circumstance which

17

the jury is told to put emphasis on and rely upon in

18

determining further eligibility for a sentence.

19

Lowenfield has nothing to do with that.

Mississippi was not permitted, and

Johnson v. Thigpen, in answer to Justice White's

QUESTION:

Well, yes, yes.

10

MR. ROSE:

Because Zant said that it was

11

constitutional error for the sentencer to consider vague

12

statutory aggravating circumstances.

13

Rehnquist, in his opinion in Barclay, called what this

14

Court did in Zant a constitutional harmless error test.

15

In other words, there was constitutional error, and what

the Court did in Zant was determine whether it had an

Maynard argument.
MR. ROSE:

9

The counsel opposite has argued that

10

Mississippi does not limit consideration, the weighing

11

stage, to just statutory aggravating facts supporting the

12

statutory aggravating circumstance.

13

In Mississippi has interpreted its laws very narrowly

14

constraining what the jury may consider at the weighing

15

stage.

16

can only -- the jury can only consider facts relevant to

17

the statutory aggravated circumstance.

18

And that's incorrect.

It said -- it has said in Coleman v. State that it

And that's significant.

Because in Zant the

19

question asked was what is the function - - the

20

constitutional question is controlled by the function of

21

aggravating circumstances under the State law.

22

Mississippi said, we have a prominent function under our

23

law, and yet we're still going to ignore the effect of the

24

vague statutory aggravating circumstance without any

individualized review.

limitations on factors that a sentencer may consider.

Mr. Rose, you've mentioned California

v. Ramos a couple of times in your oral argument.

Apparently you don't cite it in your brief?

You don't?

MR. ROSE:

I do not cite it in my brief.

the State cites it in their brief, and that's why I'm

And

The State has -- the State has raised a point

15

that we do not address, as Justice Kennedy stated before,

we do not address because we considered it fundamental.

17

The fundamental principle - - and this Court considered it

fundamental principal that if a vague aggravating

circumstance is injected into the jury's consideration,

there is constitutional error.
