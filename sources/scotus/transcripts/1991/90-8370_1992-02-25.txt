CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Pescetta, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL PESCETTA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. PESCETTA:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
As I think the exodus from the courtroom shows,

11

the issue in this case affects a lot fewer people than

12

does the taxing system of California.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. PESCETTA:

In fact --

(Inaudible).
The question before the Court is

15

whether in a situation after a trial court has found a

16

bona fide doubt as to the defendant's capacity to proceed

17

in a criminal matter, as to the defendant's capacity to

18

cooperate rationally with counsel to understand the nature

19

of the proceedings and the charges, whether, after that

20

doubt has been declared,

21

due process, put the burden on that individual whose

22

competence is

in question to prove incompetence

23

preponderance

and in that proceeding impose an evidentiary

24

presumption of competence which is contained in

25

instruction.

the State can,

consistent with

by a

And I would like to start, I think, by

â– *
pr

2

emphasizing what we are not arguing in this case, which I

3

think is confused to some degree by the briefing of amici

4

curiae on behalf of respondent.

5
6

competence as an initial matter, insofar as it imposes

7

upon the defendant or counsel or any other party asserting

8

the defendant's incompetence an initial burden of

9

production to come forward and raise that bona fide doubt

10

in the mind of the trial court that the defendant is not

11

competent to proceed with the criminal proceeding

12

i

We are not contending that the presumption of

So we are not -- as amicus Criminal Justice

13

Legal Foundation contends, we are not arguing that the

14

quote, presumption of sanity imposed by the common law is

15

constitutionally impermissible.

16

is after that initial doubt has arisen in the mind of the

17

trial court, whether at that juncture, focusing on that

18

stage of. the proceedings, the presumption of competency

19

and the burden of proof is constitutional.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

What we are talking about

Would the burden of proof be

satisfied if the Government proved by a preponderance?
MR. PESCETTA:

Our contention -- is yes, Your

23

Honor, that if the Government proved by a preponderance

24

that the defendant is competent to stand trial, that --

25

maybe I'm misunderstanding Your Honor's question.

QUESTION:

Well, you would not insist on a

higher standard of proof than a preponderance.
MR. PESCETTA:

I submit that we do not need to

go any farther than that in this case.
QUESTION:

I didn't ask you -- do you think that

a preponderance standard is constitutional if the
Government undertook that?
MR. PESCETTA:

I would have to say yes, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

I'm glad.

MR. PESCETTA:

The difficulty with the

resolution of those issues in this kind of case I think is
dependent largely on psychiatric testimony, and I will try
to discuss that in the context of the Mathews test in a
moment, but as this Court has recognized in a number of
cases that are cited in the briefs, those kinds of
decisions are fraught with risk of error, and therefore
although the preponderance standard is a low standard in
which the burden - - in which the risk of error is roughly
evenly shared by the parties, we submit that that standard
is the least that is constitutionally mandated.

That

is
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pescetta, you're asking us

to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of California
and presumably then the California courts would have to

conduct a rehearing, a retrial, at least on this aspect of

2

the case.

3

Now, I think we are entitled to get from you

4

exactly what your view is as to the preponderance in order

5

that we may decide this case.

6

Supreme Court of California and say well, you know, the

7

preponderance is standard in favor - - let the State prove

8

it, is the very least that the constitution requires.

9

That is not going to help the California courts retry this

10
11

To send it back to the

case.
MR. PESCETTA:

Maybe I expressed myself ineptly.

12

What I am saying, Your Honor, is that a State can,

13

consistent with the Constitution, adopt a higher standard

14

of proof, but in - - but what we are arguing is that the

15

preponderance of the evidence standard to show competence

16

to stand trial is the minimum that the Constitution

17

tolerates under the due process clause.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. PESCETTA:

20
21

22

23

It's also the maximum.
I submit that a State may impose

a higher burden, but we are saying -QUESTION:

But if we're talking about the United

States Constitution -MR. PESCETTA:

Yes.

I will concede that yes,

24

the preponderance standard is the highest that the Federal

25

Constitution mandates.

1

QUESTION:

Why do you make that concession?

It

2

just seems like a good idea?

I don't know how you go

3

about deciding your principles here.

4

whole thing while we are at it?

5

the rest of your principles to any case law or any long

6

tradition of practice as far as I know of, so what is the

7

basis for stopping short of beyond a reasonable doubt,

8

except the suspicion that we might not accept it?

Why not go for the

I mean, you are not tying

(Laughter.)

9

MR. PESCETTA:

10

I think that suspicion might be

11

rational, Your Honor.

12

Honor, is that there is a line of cases, this Court's

13

cases dealing with Government intrusion on fundamental

14

'

But what I am contending, Your

rights and other criminal contexts, for instance -- Leo v.

15

Twomey, United States v. Matlock -- where a preponderance

16

burden is placed on the Government to get the defendant

17

out from under a constitutional protection which he has

18

brought himself within.

19

that same kind of analysis is apt here.

20

I submit that that is -- that

I submit that there are certainly cases applying

21

the Mathews analysis, like Addington v. Texas where a

22

higher standard of proof has been imposed by this Court.

23

We are arguing here only that a preponderance standard to

24

show competence to stand trial is constitutionally

25

mandated, because in this very difficult area the risk of

1

error can be shared no more by the defendant than by the

2

State, and that that analysis leads to the result that

3

showing competence by a preponderance will satisfy the

4

Constitution.

5

If the Court would like to go further, I would

6

not object to that, but I think that disposes of this

7

case, certainly, because in this case the evidence is

8

very, very closely balanced and a finding that the Federal
Constitution requires a showing at least by a

10

preponderance, I submit, will result in a reversal of this

11

matter.

12

To go back to the analytical structure for a

13

moment, I think that we can think of the constitutional

14

structure that is imposed by the Lego-Matlock line of

15

cases in the following way.

16

Once the defendant has brought him or herself

17

within the ambit of a constitutional protection, in a case

18

like Nix v. Williams, for instance, has shown that there

1

was a search, that there was no warrant, that something

20

was actually seized that's going to be admitted into

21

evidence, that once the defendant is underneath that

22

constitutional umbrella that the burden then

23

constitutionally, appropriately, shifts to the State to

24

boot the defendant back out into the rain by showing, as

25

in Nix v. Williams, that there is an inevitable discovery

of that same evidence.
QUESTION:

3

now you're talking about?
MR. PESCETTA:

4
5

This is what, the Fourth Amendment

I'm simply talking about any

constitutional protection.
QUESTION:

6

Well, are you sure that you're -- you

7

mentioned Nix v. Williams, which I think is Fourth

8

Amendment, Lego against Twomey, isn't that also Fourth

9

Amendment ?

10

MR. PESCETTA:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

That's Fifth Amendment.

Yes, you've got two different

constitutional provisions there.
MR. PESCETTA:

I agree, Your Honor, that those

14

are different constitutional provisions.

15

is that once the defendant has brought him or herself

16

within the ambit of a fundamental constitutional

17

protection, there is nothing strange about placing the

18

burden on the - -

19

QUESTION:

What I'm saying

Well, I wonder if you are justified.

20

I mean, there aren't just two constitutional provisions,

21

as you and I both know.

22

You know, not infinite, but 15, 20, something like that,

23

in the first 10 amendments to the Constitution.

24

now citing the treatment in two cases and saying that this

25

justifies a generalization.

There are any number of them.

You are

I'm not sure you're correct.

MR. PESCETTA:

1

Well, I may not be correct in

2

every instance, Your Honor.

What I am trying to do is to

3

harmonize the cases in which -- attempt to harmonize in

4

a - - in something of a coherent scheme some of the

5

approaches that this Court has taken in which the burden

6

has been placed on the State to make a showing by a

7

preponderance to get a defendant out from some

8

constitutional protection.

9

What respondent has argued is that except for

10

the elements of criminal offense the State never has to

11

bear any burdens, and that is just plain wrong, Your

12

Honor.

13

QUESTION:

But doesn't the history have a good

14

deal to do with it of how that burden has been allocated

15

historically?

16

MR. PESCETTA:

Yes, Your Honor.

I submit in

17

this case the historical evidence, though not terribly

18

clear, favors petitioner's position as much as

19

respondent's certainly.

20

the Constitution I think we have to recognize that

21

detailed analysis of the differences between burdens of

22

persuasion and burdens of production are a relatively new

23

development in legal analysis.

QUESTION:

25

At the time of the adoption of

Doesn't that suggest that perhaps the

Constitution doesn't speak much to those questions?

MR. PESCETTA:

I don't agree, Your Honor.

I

2

think that a strong historical showing that one side or

3

the other is - - that one side or the other has a position

4

that has been unequivocally accepted, as in the case of

5

Leland v. Oregon and other affirmative defense cases, that

6

the burden of proof can be placed on the defendant, that

7

that's one situation.

8

9

I submit that when the historical evidence is
more murky, that there is at least no presumption that

10

what the defendant is asking for as an additional

11

procedural protection is completely out of the ballpark.

12

What I'm suggesting is that application of the Mathews v.

13

Eldridge analysis provides a structure for determining

14

whether or not - -

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Have we ever applied Mathews in the

criminal constitutional law field?
MR. PESCETTA:

In United States v. Raddatz and

18

in Ake v. Oklahoma the Court did so.

19

of the other decisions by the Court could be harmonized

20

through the Mathews v. Eldridge test, although it's not --

21

it's certainly not cited in those cases.

22

I submit that some

I think what we are arguing is that the

23

situations in which the defendant has brought him or

24

herself within a constitutional protection and contrasted

25

with the cases in which -- the affirmative defense kind of

1

cases, running from Leland v. Oregon to Justice White's

2

opinion in Patterson v. New York, that there is a

3

different analysis when the State has brought the

4

defendant by proving the commission of the crime beyond a

5

reasonable doubt within a constitutionally acceptable

6

umbrella of culpability, that then the burden can

7

appropriately and constitutionally be placed on the

8

defendant to get him or herself back out from under that

9

level of -- that umbrella of culpability.

10

But the inquiry in this kind of case is sui

11

generis in the sense that it is the only situation in

12

which the defendant's own ability to cooperate in the

13

current proceeding, in the proceedings on competence as

14

well as ultimately in the criminal proceedings, has an

15

effect on the ability to litigate.

16

think that that is really the intuitive bottom line here,

17

that once that initial burden of production has been met,

18

once that State trial court has looked down on the

19

defendant and said I doubt whether you can cooperate with

20

your counsel in litigating this case, I doubt whether you

21

can cooperate rationally in this proceeding, whether it

22

makes sense -- whether it makes rational constitutional

23

sense then to turn to that same defendant and say, and

24

you're the one who has to prove that, because the mental

25

condition that gives rise to that doubt in the initial

much more difficult for that party to meet the burden of

I suppose the only way the State

The State has --

Do you think they could put his

lawyer on the stand, the State?
MR. PESCETTA:

11

That has been done.

That -- I

12

think if you look at a case that Justice Kennedy sat on in

13

the Ninth Circuit - -

14

QUESTION:

Well, certainly you don't suggest

15

that the State has access to more sources to prove

16

competence than the defendant would have.

17
18

MR. PESCETTA:

The State has the same access to

evidence that the defense has, yes, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

So the defense has an equal ability

20

to get it.

As a matter of fact, I would think the

21

defendant would have sources that the State couldn't

22

really command.

MR. PESCETTA:

I would suggest, Your Honor, that

equal access implies that the defendant, him or herself,

does have control over the evidence of his or her mental

state, and I submit that the problem in this case is

2

counsel certainly has the opportunity to evaluate and

3

assess the condition of the defendant, and the defendant's

retain experts in order to make the showing that's needed.
MR. PESCETTA:

The defendant's

Yes, Your Honor, but so does the

I submit in this case, has superior access to the

defendant when he's incarcerated, has as much resources as

And the State in similar instances, and certainly

the defense -- if you look at the record in this case,

16

Well, but the critical issue I take

it -- correct me if I'm wrong -- is the ability of the

defendant to cooperate with counsel in the presentation of

ability to establish or persuade or communicate his actual

3

inability to communicate rationally may, and in this case

4

I believe was, compromised by the very mental disorder in

question.

6

The difficulty is that that defendant's

I submit that this Court's decision in McNeil v.

7

Director of the Patuxent Institution is on point here,

8

because the analysis here is, I submit from the State's

9

point of view, assumes the question in issue.

It assumes

10

that the defendant has access to the evidence of his or

11

her mental state, in some sense because it assumes that

12

the defendant is competently regulating the access of both

13

his own counsel and the experts and the State to what is

14

ultimately a question of what is inside his or her head.

15

QUESTION:

But it seems to me we have to look at

16

the totality of the cases to which this rule you're urging

17

upon us applies.

18

You argue as though it only applies to those

19

cases in which in fact the defendant is incompetent, but

20

it will apply to all cases, whether he's incompetent or

21

not, and it seems to me that, regardless of whether the

22

access to facts is the same on behalf of the prosecution

23

and the defense, which I doubt, certainly the possibility

24

of a malingering defendant who really is not mentally

25

incompetent, his possibility to produce a mere draw by

pretending incompetence is I think considerable, and

that's the result.

that you really can't tell whether he's competent or

incompetent, and in that event he can't be tried.

All he has to do is produce a draw

MR. PESCETTA:

5

Well, Your Honor, the initial

6

stage at which those cases are weeded out is the stage at

7

which no bona fide doubt as to competence arises in the

8

first instance.

9

of cases -- I think this Court's decision in Maggio v.

And if you will look at the vast majority

10

Fulford is a good example -- most of the cases deal with

11

instances in which trial courts say I don't have a bona

12

fide doubt as to this defendant's competence.

13

determinations are routinely, overwhelmingly upheld on

14

appeal and on collateral attack.

And those

Now, I think we have to recognize that in the

15
16

vast majority of criminal cases this issue never arises at

17

all.

18

those cases in which it does arise, there is no dispute

5

And just to put

Do you mean by that that at the end

6

of the 40-some-odd days the person is found to be

7

competent?

8

MR. PESCETTA:

My understanding of that

statistic is that 43 days is the average duration of the
10

commitment, so that in an average of 43 days the defendant

11

is returned to the Court as competent, and that's an

12

average of cases in which the defendant is received at the

13

facility and immediately turned around and returned to the

14

Court as competent, and it includes cases in which there

15

is a longer commitment when the State would suffer no harm

16

to its interest because the defendant is in fact

17

incompetent and it has taken whatever the amount of days

18

it is to restore his competence.

QUESTION:

Is it clear both in this case and in

20

the classic cases that we're considering that, if there is

21

an erroneous determination of incompetence, that the

22

defendant is held in custody until there is a second

QUESTION:

And what about this particular case?

4

MR. PESCETTA:

In this particular case,

5

Mr. Medina was incarcerated in the county jail prior to

trial and he would have been incarcerated I am sure in

7

Atascadero or Patton State Hospital, which are the normal

8

places for commitment as incompetents.

9

In either event, he would have been committed to

10

a mental health facility, where, I think the studies show

11

unanimously, the chances of a more accurate determination

12

of whether Mr. Medina is or is not, in fact incompetent,

13

can or cannot voluntarily cooperate with counsel, can be

14

made.

15

the decision which is afforded by that commitment to a

16

mental health facility is also a factor pushing in favor

17

of saying that the consequences of an erroneous finding of

18

incompetence are less serious than the consequences of an

19

erroneous finding of competence.

your point that we need a battery of experts to do this,

14
15
16

MR. PESCETTA:

Well, that's what the statute in

California contemplates, is appointment of experts.
My position, Your Honor, is that the defense

counsel's access to evidence is superior at the point

18

where the initial burden of production is placed on the

And the defense counsel, I

It's probably hard for you to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOLLY D. WILKENS

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12

13
14

MS. WILKENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
California's allocation of the burden of proof

15

to the moving party in a competency determination offends

16

no principle of justice which is so rooted in our

17

traditions and conscience to be ranked as fundamental.

18

Additionally, the California procedure is in

19

accord with the Federal Government, which provides

20

similarly in a statute which was amended in 1984.

21

Additionally, of the 14 legislatures of States which have

22

specifically addressed the allocation of a burden of

23

proof, 11 of the 14 comport with California law.

24
25

Moreover, the competency determination is unique
in that it can be raised by the defense, by the

prosecution, or sua sponte by the Court.

2

it is important to recall that there may be defendants who

are not resisting a competency determination but

nevertheless are subject to the litigation which may

ultimately lead to their confinement without any

There may be defendants with

Additionally, petitioner --

11

QUESTION:

12

13

So accordingly

You're suggesting that a defendant

may not always welcome a determination of incompetency.
MS. WILKENS:

Indeed, and that has been the case

14

in some instances.

15

to United States v. Hemsi out of the Second Circuit, a

16

1990 case at 901 Fed 2d 293, which illustrates this point.

17

In that particular prosecution it was the Government who

18

initiated the incompetency proceeding.

19

counsel took the stand and testified in favor of a

20

competency finding, and ultimately it was appealed to the

21

Second Circuit, the incompetency determination.

22

cannot assume that each and every defendant is seeking the

23

incompetency determination.

on the defendant when the State is seeking it, and vice

MS. WILKENS:

Well, Your Honor, admittedly that

5

is a conceivably solution, but I can only emphasize

6

that - -

7

QUESTION:

Why not?

8

MS. WILKENS:

It's not incumbent upon California

to adopt such a procedure.

The petitioner has ignored

10

California's right to bring a defendant to trial.

11

Court has recognized, the right to bring a criminal

12

defendant to trial is fundamental to a scheme of ordered

13

liberty and to social justice and peace, and --

14

QUESTION:

As this

Of course, their argument as I

15

understand it is you don't really lose the right; you

16

merely delay its assertion for whatever time it takes to

17

have a more accurate competency determination after he's

18

in the institution for a while.

1

MS. WILKENS:

Yes.

The only thing petitioner

20

will concede is that there would be some delay.

21

like to discuss the delay, because in reading petitioner's

22

brief there are references to the majority being returned

23

immediately and the rest being returned quickly, and there

24

are studies referencing averages of 43 days.

25

this morning has indicated that the California Penal Code

2

days, and I don't think that's appropriate.

3

So he's talking

The Penal Code section counsel refers to section

4

1370, subsection (a)(2).

That provides for a report in 15

5

days to the trial court as to whether defendant will go to

6

an outpatient program or be committed to a mental

institution.

8

15 days.

It's not a determination as to competency at

The California law provides for a 90-day period

9

for the initial diagnostic evaluation.

11

provision, which is the same, provides for a 4-month

days.

QUESTION:

The Federal

So what you're saying is that his 43-

day figure really should be 90 days or 120 days.

figure, I have some problems with that as well.

20

to Atascadero, which is but one of California's mental

months in the event that someone is still committed and

2

has not yet been certified mentally competent.

3

legislature selected 18 months for a reason, and in the

4

Pacific Law Journal, Volume 6, at page 492, at footnote

5

67, they cite California Department of Health records

6

relating to all commitments pursuant to Penal Code section

7

1370, and those records indicate that the majority of

8

defendants are returned within 2 years, and this is a

9

significant difference.
QUESTION:

10

Well, let me ask you this.

And the

Supposing

11

in the institution the people in the institution think

12

this fellow is malingering and he's really perfectly

13

competent.

14

that fact to the attention of the court?

15

wait the 2 years, in other words?

16

Is there any procedure by which they can bring

MS. WILKENS:

Absolutely not.

Do they have to

If at any time at

17

the mental health facility the experts arrive at an

18

opinion that the individual is indeed competent, he is

19

returned to court at that time.

20

to note that the California procedures provide for expert

21

evaluations prior to the hearing on this matter.

22

individual is particularly adept at fooling the experts in

23

that context, there's no reason to suggest that he will be

24

returned immediately, based on the evaluations in the

25

hospital setting.

But again it's important

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

So if an

1

QUESTION:

No, but isn't there this different.

2

Maybe I don't understand the procedure, but isn't it

3

different that if he's been committed to an institution

4

where he's under 24-hour-a-day custody and supervision by

5

experts in mental health, they have one body of facts to

6

work with, whereas if he has not had a hearing at all,

7

isn't he in a normal jail, or he's not necessarily in a

8

mental institution when the issue arises.

So you don't --

the State has had a different amount of access to the
10

relevant facts at the second hearing than it would have at

11

the first hearing.

12

13
14

MS. WILKENS:

That's correct.

He may not even

be in custody prior to the hearing on mental competency.
So with respect to delay, there is a significant

15

difference, however, and the State does have a concern

16

with respect to malingering, because as the expert

17

testimony below from petitioner's own expert indicates,

18

avoiding the death penalty is a motivation for

1

malingering.

20

little litigation on the issue of mental competency, but I

21

would suggest that it will come in the cases that

22

California has the greatest interest.

23

And counsel has indicated that there will be

That is, the more serious the offense the

24

greater the motivation to malinger, and this is something

25

that has been recognized historically since 1847 when Hale
28

1

observed that it would be appropriate to empanel a jury to

2

see if a claim of madness is real or fraudulent.

3

So with respect to the State's interest, it is

4

enhanced in the sense that the delay is putting these

5

people back into the system at the initial point.

6

in all probability the most serious of offenders and those

7

of the greatest concern to the State.

It is

8

Additionally, as this case serves to illustrate,

9

California has a strong interest in not having individuals

10

in a hospital setting, other than those who are truly

11

deserving of the evaluation, because as the experts again

12

agreed in their testimony, there are individuals, career

13

criminals, very serious, dangerous individuals, who will

14

seek out a hospital setting because it is less secure and

15

they are more likely to perfect an escape.

16

attendant risk to the State both in delay to the strength

17

of the prosecution's case and with respect to facilitating

18

the incarceration of serious offenders in a hospital

19

setting.

Your comment about less secure, does

it apply to Federal prisons in your estimation?

11

would not be unprecedented, and the law as it stands today

QUESTION:

That

Observations and impressions of the

mental condition are not within the privilege?
MS. WILKENS:

Yes, and for example, petitioner

suggested that the defense investigator testified, and he

20

indicated that in his conversations with the defendant he

21

wanted to talk of irrelevant subjects, and he was able to

22

discuss what those irrelevant subjects were.

difficulty is that perhaps embodied in those discussions

Well, you would think that if the

you would think that attorneys would play a major role in

MS. WILKENS:

MS. WILKENS:

I don't know that that has been

5

precisely litigated, but I would suggest that there has

6

been a distinction drawn between challenging the

7

competency of your counsel and challenging the mental

8

competency of the defendant.

And California law provides

that it is only when the defendant challenges the
10

competency of the attorney that we can go into that area.

11

So really, if petitioner is to prevail today, it would

12

appear the prosecution should be entitled to some very

13

intrusive discovery, but we can't be sure of that.

MS. WILKENS:

No, there has never been that

clear that it is waived when the defense attorney's

competency is challenged, not when the defendant

This Court has been reluctant to disturb --

QUESTION:

Where did that reaffirmation occur?

MS. WILKENS:

Your Honor, I rely heavily on

Patterson v. New York, and particularly the language in

Patterson, which reiterates the opportunities that this

that it is more probable than not that he is incompetent

Now, with respect to counsel's remarks about

focusing on the trial court's declaration of doubt, it's

important to focus on that particular determination by the

trial court.

whether there will be an inquiry at all, and counsel has

no problem with California's allocation of both a burden

That is the determination which decides

However, he suggests that once the trial court

11

has declared a doubt and asked for a competency hearing,

12

that somehow California should change its presumption and

13

its allocations, and there's nothing to support that.

14

it's interesting to note that it's only when the

15

defendant's incompetency claim is going to be subject to

an adversarial setting, where the prosecution will have

the ability to produce evidence and to cross-examine and

look into the defendant's allocations, that suddenly

But it's our position that if a

he's incompetent than competent, indeed he should stand

Mr. Medina had a full and fair opportunity to

present evidence to 12 jurors, and he could not convince

MS. WILKENS:

If we have a
