ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRYSON:

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case comes to the Court on writ of

11

certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the

12

Tenth Circuit.

13

and not that unusual.

14

The facts of the case are fairly simple
I'll review them briefly.

The case involves a methamphetamine

15

manufacturing operation that extended over a 4-month

16

period over the summer of 1987.

17

essentially two stages.

18

of the operation in which the respondent and his co­

19

conspirators sought to and ultimately succeeded in

20

building a laboratory to manufacture methamphetamine in

21

Beggs, Oklahoma, a small town south of Tulsa.

22

They manufactured a large amount of

23

methamphetamine at that lab, using chemicals which they

24

had procured from a chemist in Tulsa.

25

them, the chemist in Tulsa was working as an informant for

The operation had

The first stage was the portion

1

the DEA, and his tipping off the DEA resulted in a raid on

2

the lab and the arrest of several of the co-conspirators

3

and nearly resulted in the arrest of respondent Felix.

4

That raid occurred July 13, 1987, and it terminated that

5

enterprise for manufacturing methamphetamine at that time.

6

Now, undeterred by this turn of events,

7

respondent went back to the same chemist, not realizing

8

that he was working with the DEA and attempted to procure

9

some more chemicals to start a new lab, and in fact

10

ordered in late August of 1987 a whole set of the

11

chemicals that would be necessary and asked that they be

12

delivered in Missouri.

13

delivery, the chemist having once again tipped off the

14

DEA, Mr. Felix was arrested in Missouri.

15

They were, and at the time of the

Now, he was prosecuted very quickly in Missouri

16

for the crime of attempt to manufacture methamphetamine.

17

In the course of that trial, the Missouri trial, the

18

prosecution introduced evidence of the prior operation in

19

Beggs, Oklahoma, in which respondent had in fact

20

manufactured methamphetamine and had set up the lab along

21

with his co-conspirators and introduced that evidence for

22

the purpose of showing that the defendant had the intent

23

to in fact manufacture methamphetamine with these

24

chemicals that he had assembled and ordered and in fact

25

had the capacity to do so.

But what's important for our purposes is it was

that evidence of the Beggs, Oklahoma, operation was

introduced only for purposes of showing his intent.

wasn't introduced as part of a separate prosecution for

the Beggs conduct.

prosecuted in the Missouri case for and only for his

7

activities in late August of 1987, the activities that

8

involved the attempt to manufacture methamphetamine.

In other words, he was being

QUESTION:

MR. BRYSON:

12

QUESTION:

14

But intent was an essential element

of that offense for which he was being prosecuted --

11

13

That's correct.

That's correct.

And this was shown to prove the

intent.
MR. BRYSON:

This was one of the pieces of

15

evidence that was introduced to prove the intent.

16

exactly right.

17

It

That's

Now, subsequently he was prosecuted -- the

18

respondent was prosecuted with several of his co­

19

conspirators in Oklahoma for activities surrounding the

20

Beggs, Oklahoma, operation.

21

and this was one prosecution which involved a number of

22

counts, but some of the counts, the substantive counts,

23

involved the actual Beggs lab, and those counts ran up to

24

and included July 13th, 1987, but extended no farther.

25

First, he was prosecuted --

He was also charged with a conspiracy which

extended from May 1, 1987, through the Beggs period and

2

into the period of his activities in Missouri through

3

August 31st.

4

objection that this constituted double jeopardy because he

5

had previously been prosecuted for attempt in Missouri,

6

the district court said no, you're being prosecuted for

7

different crimes, separate offenses, and therefore there's

8

no double jeopardy problem.

9

The district court held that -- over his

The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit

10

reversed, holding, in reliance on this Court's decision in

11

Grady against Corbin, that in fact the prior prosecution

12

for attempt, based on the late August activities in

13

Missouri, barred a prosecution for both substantive

14

offenses relating to the Beggs operation and also for the

15

conspiracy throughout the entire summer.

16

The court's rationale was that this was

17

successive prosecution for the same conduct.

18

phrase that the court used again and again.

19

focused on the fact that in the Missouri case the evidence

20

of the Beggs operation had been introduced to prove

21

intent, and in the Oklahoma case evidence of the Missouri

22

transaction had been introduced as part of the proof of

23

the conspiracy, but because the evidence overlapped, the

24

court regarded that as sufficient to constitute successive

25

prosecution for the same conduct.

This was a
The court

QUESTION:

1

Under a strict application of Grady

2

would the case have been - - would the prosecution have

3

been invalid if in the indictment, in the charging papers

4

for the Missouri attempt, they had alleged the Beggs

5

operation?

6

MR. BRYSON:

No.

No, Your Honor.

An allegation

7

of simply factual assertions in the indictment that could

8

have been thrown in would have been surplusage, as long as

9

he was not in jeopardy for the Beggs operation.

In other

10

words, if they had said in the Missouri indictment, if

11

they had had a charge which related to the Beggs

12

operation, yes, he would have been in jeopardy.

13

have been separately convicted for that.

14

treated the Beggs operation as part, let's say, of an

15

overall conspiracy.

16

QUESTION:

He could

Or, if they had

Well, suppose in the attempted

17

prosecution they had treated the Beggs operation as the

18

exclusive evidence of the intent -- it's a little bit hard

19

to work with the hypothetical for a point.

20

MR. BRYSON:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

I understand.
Would that have made a difference?

Because intent is an element of the attempt crime.
MR. BRYSON:

It is an element, but even if the

24

Beggs evidence had been the only evidence that had been

25

available to the prosecution to prove the intent in the

1

Missouri case -- it's a little hard to imagine that,

2

because the intent could be inferred from the activities

3

themselves, almost certainly.

4

that that were the only evidence, still what you're

5

talking about is the use of evidence of conduct to prove

6

another offense.

7

-- for which you are being prosecuted.

8

we think, to the double jeopardy --

9

But in any event, supposing

You're not talking about an offense that

QUESTION:

10

MR. BRYSON:

11

QUESTION:

That is the key,

Well, but you're proving intent.
You are.
And the way Grady reads, as I

12

understand it, it takes elements of the crime in a not a

13

very academic or formalistic way, and intent is really

14

more of an element than - - I really think than what we are

15

dealing with in Grady.

16

MR. BRYSON:

Well, you are definitely proving

17

intent, but what's important is you are not -- you're not

18

in effect reprosecuting him for something for which he has

19

been prosecuted before.

20

-- when the Oklahoma case came up you weren't

21

reprosecuting him for an offense for which he was in

22

jeopardy in Missouri.

In other words, when the Missouri

MR. BRYSON:

QUESTION:

3

The two crimes involved in Grady

against Corbin were not of that nature, were they?

4

MR. BRYSON:

5

QUESTION:

6

That's right.

No.
So that Grady against Corbin's

holding does not apply to this situation.

MR. BRYSON:

No, we think the holding does not

apply.

MR. BRYSON:

13

The problem, of course, is in the language that

It's not the holding.

That's

correct.
QUESTION:

Well, the Court thought it was the

holding, Mr. Bryson, didn't it?
QUESTION:

17

Circuit, did you not?

18

MR. BRYSON:

You had a dissent in the Tenth

There was a dissent by Judge

19

Anderson, and we believe that Judge Anderson's analysis of

20

Grady against Corbin is very insightful and we think that

21

his analysis is the correct approach to the application of

22

Grady in this case.

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, here's what Grady thought

24

it was holding, anyway.

25

have such a clear, concise expression of its holding:

There are very few cases that

We

1

hold --we hold -- that the double jeopardy clause bars a

2

subsequent prosecution if to establish an essential

3

element of an offense charged in that prosecution -- the

4

subsequent prosecution - - the Government will prove

5

conduct that constitutes an offense for which the

6

defendant has already been prosecuted.

8

That squarely fits this case.

It couldn't

possibly be more clear.
MR. BRYSON:

9

I don't think, Your Honor, that it

10

does squarely fit this case.

11

read that language broadly enough - - I think it would be

12

an extremely broad reading of the language.

13

read it broadly enough to cover this case, but I think if

14

you do so then you would construe Grady against Corbin as

15

having overruled a hundred years of double jeopardy law,

16

and I don't think that Grady against Corbin -QUESTION:

That's what the dissent in the case

said, and the majority did not deny that it was doing it.

did - -

QUESTION:

22

MR. BRYSON:

They had no response to that.

extent, Your Honor.

1

Harris against Oklahoma, which are essentially talking

2

about a kind of lesser included offense law.

3

What Grady does - - and I think this language is

4

consistent with it.

5

what we urge upon this Court as the proper construction of

6

Grady, if the Court approaches Grady with the intent to

7

not have Grady overrule all of the prior cases involving

8

conspiracy and substantive offenses with respect to

9

successive prosecutions - - what we urge this Court to

10

construe Grady to mean is that this language, conduct

11

constituting an offense that is used to establish an

12

element of a later offense, is simply a way of talking

13

about a lesser included offense.

14

What Grady does, in our view, and

In other words, the lesser offense, the first

15

offense prosecuted in the case of Grady, has to be proved

16

-- reproved entirely, and it will have to establish -- it

17

will have to constitute the entire element of a later

18

offense.

19

Now -QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, do you think a Court can

20

convert dicta into a holding by simply saying in front of

21

the dicta, we hold?

22

MR. BRYSON:

Well, I think not, Your Honor.

I

23

think that we hold may not be an accurate description of

24

what the actual holding is, although obviously the more

25

clearly the Court states what its rule is I think the more

1

it imposes on the lower court certainly the obligation to

2

attempt to accommodate that rule to their decisions.

3

that has been, I think, one source of confusion among the

4

lower courts, and I have to concede that there's been a

5

lot of confusion about exactly what that formulation

6

means.

7

And

And this case is an example of it.
I think, to finish my point in response to

8

Justice Scalia, the -- what's important, I think, about

9

the way the Court -- the majority viewed Grady is that

10

while in the dissenting opinion the point was made that

11

Grady could be read much more broadly, I think even the

12

dissenting opinion said that that wasn't a necessary

13

reading, although the dissent anticipated that an argument

14

would be made, and here we are, that the argument would be

15

made that Grady should apply virtually to constitute a

16

same transaction test.

17

But the majority did not say that.

The majority

18

said, in effect, we are simply applying the principles of

19

Illinois against Vitale and Oklahoma -- Harris against

20

Oklahoma, which again in our view is a way of signaling

21

that what the majority was trying to do is to say this is

22

really lesser included offense law.

23

In any event, we would - -

QUESTION:

25

Mr. Bryson, maybe we can limit it

that way, but I don't believe that's what the majority was

saying.

I don't know how you can read that description -QUESTION:

2

Well, as a member of the majority I'd

3

just like to suggest that we often do not take the

4

dissent's interpretation of a majority opinion.

5

dissent will often overstate majority rule to make the

6

dissent more persuasive.

7
8

The

It happens all the time.

May I just ask you, do you agree with Judge
Newman's interpretation of Grady in the Second Circuit?

9

MR. BRYSON:

No, Your Honor.

Judge Newman

10

explicitly construes the second element, if you will, of

11

the Grady test in a way that's different from the language

12

of Grady.

13

but he construes conduct constituting an offense not to

14

mean conduct constituting the whole offense, this concept

15

of lesser-included offense for which we're contending.

16

He says he feels that it's necessary to do so,

He says you have to read that to mean conduct

17

constituting an element of an offense.

18

us, is where Judge Newman has expanded Grady and in a way

19

that is inconsistent with the language, and we would say

20

with what Grady is really trying to get at.

21

Again, if I can --

22

QUESTION:

That, it seems to

I take it you say that the language

23

Justice Scalia read to you as the holding is beyond what

24

Vitale suggested.

25

MR. BRYSON:

We think so, Your Honor.

1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

We think

1

that the language can be squared with Vitale, because --

2

but it isn't obvious that from reading the language that

3

it incorporates only what Vitale says.

4

The problem is, the language is not as clear, I

5

think, as the language that appears in cases like Harris

6

and Vitale, on which Grady relied and which we think Grady

7

was attempting, in a sense, to codify, but the language

8

can be read more broadly.

9

QUESTION:

In this case, the evidence that was

10

used in the second prosecution was used in the first

11

prosecution but that evidence was about conduct for which

12

he was not convicted.

13

MR. BRYSON:

14

Exactly, and that states in one

sentence our submission in this case.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BRYSON:

17

QUESTION:

Well, that was -- that's Vitale.
Well -I mean, it's -- Vitale says that if

18

the evidence in the second prosecution related to conduct

19

for which he had been convicted in the first

20

prosecution -MR. BRYSON:

21
22

23

That's right.

Well -- that's

right.
Now, in this case, this case, we submit, before

24

Grady would be an easy case, because the principles

governing this case, the substantive and conspiracy

prosecutions in this case were very well established and

2

they were simply this:

substantive offenses are always different.

5

purposes of the double jeopardy clause.

They are

And this case is a perfect example

separate times.
The substantive offenses related to Beggs

11
12

occurred in Oklahoma on July 13th and previously; the

13

substantive offense related to Missouri occurred in

14

Missouri in late August.
QUESTION:

15

Well, I think that's a pretty easy

16

argument in regard to the substantive offenses, and the

17

more difficult one relates to the conspiracy charge, of

18

course, as affected by the proof in the attempt trial in

19

Missouri.

20

MR. BRYSON:

I think it is more difficult, but

21

still, I think the point that I'd like to emphasize is

22

that there is a hundred years of law from this Court and

23

from the lower courts in which the Court has emphasized

24

that conspiracy and the related object substantive

25

offenses are separate offenses for double jeopardy

1

purposes, and we don't think that Grady against Corbin

2

intended to change that.

3

dealing with the language of Grady is more complicated

4

with respect to the conspiracy offense, we don't think

5

that the legal point is more -- is closer.

6

So that although the analysis in

It's more difficult, because it is harder to

7

deal with the language we think, but the legal point is

8

still quite clear that a conspiracy and its related

9

substantive offense are separate offenses for double

10

11

jeopardy purposes.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, do you agree in every

12

detail with the dissent below?

13

MR. BRYSON:

I think there are a couple of minor

14

respects in which we would disagree, but I think they fall

15

into the category of quibbles.

16

you an example -- and this is - - I don't want to go into

17

the quibbles in great detail, but the dissent at one point

18

states that there is no evidence with respect to the

19

Missouri transaction that suggests any continuing

20

conspiratorial activity.

21

The dissent, just to give

In fact, there is a little bit of evidence --

not a lot, but a little bit of evidence that does suggest

that the conspiracy was ongoing.

If we adopted the rationale as you

4

propose it here I take it that would not disturb the

5

holding of Calderone.

6

MR. BRYSON:

Well, I think that it would

7

certainly require the Court to reanalyze in Calderone, and

8

jeopardy for the subsequent conspiracy at the time they

13

the district court said in that case.

14

It's a little bit of an unusual case because of

15

the way the district court disposed of the first case in

not letting the case go to the jury because it didn't

17

involve the same conspiracy.

what we had been told was not at issue in the first case

Harris and the Felix case as well, and to see what is

2

really going on in this area, what I think the Court was

3

really trying to do in Grady was to simply extend the

4

concept of lesser-included offenses to cases where your

greater offense isn't just -- is not just -- where it's

6

not just possible that hypothetically the prosecution

could prove the greater offense without proving the

where the greater offense would necessarily result in the

proof of the lesser.
Harris.

11

And let me give concrete examples.

That was a case in which the felony

12

murder that was proved first was felony murder based on a

13

robbery.

14

the felony murder -- that robbery is not a lesser-included

15

offense of felony murder, because of course the felony

16

murder could have been premised on a rape or an arson, but

17

in that particular case the felony murder was clearly

18

premised on a robbery, and for all practical purposes --

19

not theoretically, but for all practical purposes, then --

20

the felony murder was a greater offense and the robbery

21

was a lesser-included offense.

It is neither enough, nor is it

In other words, attempt would not establish any

it doesn't establish that any overt act was in furtherance

of an agreement, so it won't do it.

back -- can you hear me, by the way?

8

MR. BRYSON:

9

QUESTION:

Sure.
I'm not sure this is working.

Going back to Grady, the proof of the DWI was

10
11

sufficient to prove an element in the later prosecution in

12

Grady.

Is that correct?

13

MR. BRYSON:

14

QUESTION:

That's right.
The reason it was sufficient was that

15

the commission of DWI constituted negligent behavior and

16

therefore that satisfied the negligent element of the

17

homicide.

1

MR. BRYSON:

Well, I think that the way the

2

Court viewed it, and one could quarrel with this way of

3

viewing the application of New York law, but I think the

4

way the Court viewed it was, look at what is the actus

5

reis on which the prosecution is premised, and that actus

6

reis is drunk while driving, and that either that act is

7

per se negligence or that we will prove -- in addition to

8

proving that act we will prove that it was done in a

9

negligent fashion.

10

So it was one element as the Court construed it,

11

and this was consistent, I think, with the way the --

12

State court had viewed it.

13

QUESTION:

Well, aren't you saying, then, that

14

if the State selects one evidentiary fact as the means to

15

prove an element, that is the equivalent of making that

fact the element for purposes of double jeopardy?

17

MR. BRYSON:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I

18

think the State has to actually say that those are

19

elements of the offense and the fact that the evidence --

20

if I understand your question, that the evidence may be

established in a particular way doesn't make something an

MR. ANDERSON:

Why -- what -What I meant to say by that, Your

in Illinois v. Vitale -- and we're talking about cases

I would, Your Honor, except that

15

would like to point out that in 1868 Thomas Cooley, Mr.

Constitutional Limitations.

time of 1791 when the Bill of Rights was enacted,

23

page 328:

is, the jeopardy bar -- the Government cannot avoid it by

25

varying the form of the charge in a new accusation.

If

1

the first indictment or information were such that the

accused might have been convicted under it on proof of the

facts by which the second is sought to be sustained, then

MR. ANDERSON:

No, it doesn't --

No.

This is proof by evidence of conduct, which

Grady forbids to be used in two trials to prove a material

element.

Reliance on the term evidence is too elusive for

because evidence in my experience can - - or facts or the
10

conduct can be proved by different forms of evidence.

11

It's too slippery a doctrine.

12

QUESTION:

Well, if you've charged a second

13

attempt that occurred in August in Missouri, how can you

14

ever say double jeopardy prevents proof of something that

15

-- evidence of something that had occurred at an earlier

16

date in a different State?

17

MR. ANDERSON:

If such an opinion is adopted by

18

this Court it would constitute the authority for the

1

United States Government to decide to try the small

20

offenses first.

21

What does this do?

What does this deprive the

22

defendant of?

In the first trial, this was alleged to be

23

404(b) evidence.

24

undoubtedly 801(d)(2)(e) evidence from Roach, from Paul

25

Dean Roach, the unindicted co-conspirator.

That's correct.

you don't really know whether the sole ground for

MR. ANDERSON:

9

My point to the Court which I

tried to make at the beginning was that if you have

different results when you try them in reverse order then

11

it is not a standard which can be applied in implementing

12

the protections of the double jeopardy clause.

13

If this were tried in reverse, I don't believe

14

that we'd be standing before this Court.

15

in Oklahoma was tried in Missouri, and having been alleged

16

as an overt act and ordered by the judge in his charge

17

that the jury must -- that they must prove those overt

acts, I don't believe that we'd be standing here before

QUESTION:

But let me just challenge that a

reasonable doubt, or would later be proved beyond a

1

reasonable doubt in the other trial, but the evidence of

2

the Oklahoma transactions would not have been needed to be

3

proved beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain the Missouri

4

conviction.

5

There is evidence of intent - - inferences of

6

intent were drawn from the Oklahoma conduct, but I don't

7

think the jury had to be instructed that you must believe

8

beyond a reasonable doubt that the transactions in

9

Oklahoma occurred as the Government indicated.

I think

10

what the judge must have told the jury was that that

11

evidence, together with the contemporaneous evidence, must

12

convince you beyond a reasonable doubt that in August the

13

requisite intent was present.

14

MR. ANDERSON:

I believe the charge of the court

15

in that matter is cited in the Government's brief on the

16

merits in this case, and I can't find the citation at this

17

time, but I think the exact charge from the Missouri court

18

is cited, and it's in the opinion of Felix from the

19

Missouri case and addressed by the Eighth Circuit, which

20

said it was virtually the only evidence in that case of

21

intent, and that no other evidence existed for intent.

22

Now, the Government argued that at the Eighth

Circuit, and now the Government wants to argue something

different before this Court in a different case.

To show you how much they relied on it, in the

Missouri trial in the final arguments, page 465, at line

3

16, the Government's final argument is:

4

you that what he did he did knowingly and intentionally.

5

We showed that through the Beggs Oklahoma Lab, and by his

6

conduct in Joplin, by his statements to George -- that's

7

George Dwinnells, the confidential informant -- and by

George's evidence dovetailing with Roach's, the later
