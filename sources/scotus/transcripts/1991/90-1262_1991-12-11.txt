CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Environmental Protection Agency v. Oklahoma.

Mr. Wallace:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER EPA

11

MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves judicial review of the

12

validity of an action taken by a Federal agency pursuant

13

to a Federal statute, namely the issuance of a permit by

14

EPA for a new sewage treatment plant in Fayetteville,

15

Arkansas, .issuance of a permit under the Clean Water Act.

16

And under that Federal statute, the permitting authority

17

is to assure compliance with applicable water quality

18

requirements, and this includes compliance with the EPA-

19

approved water quality standards of a downstream State.

20

The key to this case in our view lies in

21

appreciating the fundamental importance under the Federal

22

statute of a rather elusive distinction, but one that is

23

not formalistic, for reasons I will try to explain.

24

that is the distinction between the law of the downstream

25

State, and the federally approved water quality standards

And

1

adopted by that State, but that apply in the permitting

2

process as a matter of Federal law under the Clean Water

3

Act.
The foundation on which we are building this

4
5

distinction really is reflected in two of the holdings of

6

this Court the last time it considered this general

7

subject in International Paper Company against Oullette.

8

One of those holdings was that the downstream State's law

9

is not preempted by the Clean Water Act insofar as it

10

applies to sources in that State.

11

preempted as it applies within the State to sources in

12

that State.

13

needed.

No State law is

No Federal approval of such State law is

It takes effect if it's enacted by the State.

14

.The other foundation holding in International

15

Paper against Oullette is that the Clean Water Act does

16

preempt application of a State's law to discharges in

17

another State.

18

affected State, the downstream State's standards are

19

approved by EPA, that they are to be applied in the

20

permitting process in the source State.

21

So it's only if the out of State, the

And what is significant in the Federal act, and

22

not emphasized in our brief as much as I think its

23

significance would warrant, is that the Federal act in its

24

implementing regulation require that certain processes be

25

followed in the adoption or review of State standards if

1

they are to qualify for EPA approval.

2

relevant process that's required is requirements for

3

public hearings and public participation, at which

4

affected persons and States would have an opportunity to

5

be heard about the impact of water quality standards on

6

their operations.

7

And the most

And EPA itself is a very active participant in

8

the development of these water quality standards.

It

9

provides technical guidance through participation in these

10

hearings, consultation, model regulations, et cetera, and

11

moreover, a renewed opportunity to be heard.

12

statute requires hearings every - - to be conducted every 3

13

years to get public participation about needed revisions.

QUESTION:

In fact, the

Mr. Wallace, may I interrupt you and

15

ask a question or two?

the permit?

17

MR. WALLACE:

18

QUESTION:

Here the EPA itself was issuing

That is correct.

And so you claim that under the

19

statutory scheme that the Federal Government can have

20

deference on its interpretation of the source State's

21

requirements?

22

MR. WALLACE:

As well as the affected State's.

23

Deference with respect to all applicable water quality

24

standards that the Clean Water Act requires EPA to apply

in issuing the permit.

QUESTION:

You don't -- do you take the position

2

that the source State's requirements, in this case,

3

Oklahoma, become Federal law, in effect?

MR. WALLACE:

the affected State.

QUESTION:

7

MR. WALLACE:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WALLACE:

The applicable law -- Oklahoma is

Yes.
The source is in Arkansas.

Okay.

The source State, excuse me.

Well, what's at issue is whether

10

Oklahoma's water quality standards are violated the

11

affected State.

12

QUESTION:

The State where the source of the

13

pollution enters the water, you say that State's laws

14

become Federal laws?

15

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the statute does require EPA

16

to defer in administering its program to the source States

17

where the discharge is occurring - - here Arkansas - - to

18

the source State's interpretation of its own standards,

19

because those standards are applicable as a matter of

20

State law to anyone making a discharge in Arkansas anyway.

21

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't Oklahoma take the

22

position that its no degradation policy means something

23

different than the EPA says it means?

24
25

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

But you see this

1

Oullette that Oklahoma cannot apply its law to a discharge

2

in Arkansas, that a State's law cannot apply to an

3

out-of-State discharge, that the Clean Water Act preempts

4

that.
What can apply, what does apply, are water

5
6

quality standards that happen to be adopted in that State

7

law that EPA approved after the Federal statutory

8

processes were followed.
QUESTION:

9

Well, and as to that, Oklahoma has a

10

different view than the EPA as to what those standards

11

require.

12

MR. WALLACE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

So whose law do we apply?
Well, that is precisely the point

15

I'm trying to make, that it is EPA that is in -- that is

16

both the expert agency and the fulcrum agency to

17

understand what informed participants in the processes

18

that the Federal act requires would have thought those

19

standards meant.

MR. WALLACE:

1

MR. WALLACE:

That is our point.

It's only

2

Federal law that can apply because State law is preempted

3

from applying out of State.

4

QUESTION:

At what point could a court review,

5

if at all, the adequacy and the correctness of EPA's

6

interpretation of what the State standard meant?

7

first approved the implementation of the standard, or at

8

the permit stage, such as we have here, or both?

MR. WALLACE:

When you

MR. WALLACE:

Is that subject to

No, because the Oklahoma statute

22

cannot apply to a discharge in Arkansas.

EPA is not

applying an Oklahoma statute.

Well, they're still Oklahoma law.

mean, they appear in an Oklahoma statute.

3

MR. WALLACE:

They appear in an Oklahoma

4

statute, and Oklahoma can apply that statute within

5

Oklahoma.

6

That's the fundamental error that the court of appeals

7

made here.

10

But what EPA is applying is not Oklahoma law.

The court of appeals said -QUESTION:

8

9

Well, but under the permit procedure

you were required to, I take it, evaluate the
recommendations made by Oklahoma.

11

MR. WALLACE:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

I

Exactly.

And they were based on Oklahoma's

law.
MR. WALLACE:

They were based on what Oklahoma

15

said was a misapplication of applicable water quality

16

standards that the Clean Water Act required the permitting

17

authority to apply.

18

QUESTION:

But the Oklahoma law must be referred

19

to in order to understand the meaning of those water

20

quality standards.

21

22

23
24
25

MR. WALLACE:

Those water quality standards

appear in the Oklahoma law.
QUESTION:

That is correct.

They also could be enforced by

Oklahoma in Oklahoma.
MR. WALLACE:

That's correct.

But when they're

1

being enforced in the permitting process, under the Clean

2

Water Act, they are not being enforced as Oklahoma law

3

because the Court has already held that Oklahoma cannot

4

apply.
QUESTION:

5
6

And from a legal standpoint, your

interpretation of that law is never subject to review?

7

MR. WALLACE:

It is subject to review, as to

8

whether it was a reasonable interpretation of standards

9

that the EPA was required to apply.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WALLACE:

12

Chevron deference applies?
Absolutely, just as with any other

standard that EPA had to apply in the permitting process.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Wallace, that makes a lot sense

14

when EPA happens to be the permitter, as is the case here.

15

But how does your very logical scheme work when, as is

16

often the case, it is the upstream State that is the

17

permitter?

18

MR. WALLACE:

Because under the statute, if the

19

downstream State is unhappy with the upstream State's

20

issuance of the permit, its right is to complain to EPA,

21

and EPA has the authority to veto that permit if EPA

22

concludes that applicable water quality standards would be

23

violated.

MR.'WALLACE:

1

No, EPA has to make a

2

determination.

EPA ultimately is the one who decides in

3

these interstate disputes, whether the applicable water

4

quality standards will be met.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, is the reason that

6

the -- statutory basis for requiring application of the

7

Oklahoma statute section 401?
MR. WALLACE:

8

9

Let me check that.

It would

be - QUESTION:

10

I've got section 401 in the white

11

appendix, starting on page 164a.

12

MR. WALLACE:

13

QUESTION:

14

is really the tail end of it.

15

provides that the permitting agency, based on the

16

recommendations of such State, the administrator, et

17

cetera, shall condition such license or permit in such

18

manner as may be necessary as to ensure compliance with

19

applicable water quality requirements.

Yes.

Right.

Exactly.

Okay.
That's exactly where the

requirement comes in.

1

permitting agency is to assure that all applicable water

2

quality requirements are to be applied.
QUESTION:

3

Now, is that consistent with what you

4

described a moment ago as the holding in Oullette, which

5

seems to suggest that indeed the only thing the downstream

6

State really can do is to recommend within the meaning of

7

section 402, and if the recommendation isn't taken, too

8

bad.

9

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we think that Oullette can

10

be read consistently with this, if we understand what this

11

recommendation means.

12

what is the applicable water quality standard, what is the

13

meaning of that standard that the permitting agency is

14

required to apply.

15

QUESTION:

It really is a submission about

But -Wouldn't it be a more natural

16

reading, though, to say that the recommendation which is

17

referred to in 402 is simply a recommendation for what the

18

permit ought to include in order to meet the standard, but

19

that under section 401(b) there is no question that the

20

standard is enforceable.

21

may not be accepted under the leeway given on 402 is the

22

recommendation on how to do it, how to meet it.

23
24
25

MR. WALLACE:

And the only thing that may or

Well, I think that is our reading,

that the water standard is enforceable.
QUESTION:

Well, then is that reading consistent

1

with Oullette, which seems to leave the EPA with a much

2

greater leeway?

3

MR. WALLACE:

If Oullette is read that way, we

4

think that's the wrong reading of Oullette.

5

that the downstream State plays a subsidiary role in the

6

process to the source State and the EPA.

7

QUESTION:

Oullette says

True, but section 401, if I

8

understand it, provides that that role will not be

9

subsidiary to the point of ignoring that State's

10

requirement once it is -- water quality plan, once it's

11

been approved by EPA.

You can't --

12

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

14

MR. WALLACE:

15
16

That is our position.

Okay.
That is the difference between

Arkansas and ourselves (inaudible) this Court.
QUESTION:

All right.

Now, if that's the case

17

and the Oklahoma water quality plan has got to be applied,

18

then is the --is the relevant section of the Oklahoma

19

plan what is set out on page 46 and 47 of the joint

20

appendix, section 5, the beneficial use limitations?

21

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it's the anti-degradation

22

provision that was specifically at issue, and that was

23

interpreted by EPA by the Chief Judicial Officer as being

24

satisfied if none of the specific parameters of water

25

quality set forth elsewhere in the water quality standards

1

would be affected in any detectable way.
QUESTION:

2

Well, my particular problem, my

3

reason for raising section 5, is that if section 5 is

4

applicable -- it says all streams and bodies of water

5

designated as A, which I assume is applying here, are

6

protected by prohibition of any new point source

7

discharge.

8

new point source discharge, and that would be absolutely

9

prohibited if that section must be enforced in this case.

This is a new -- what is at issue here is a

MR. WALLACE:

10

Except under conditions described

11

in section 3 that -- this was interpreted by EPA which

12

approved this as the water quality standard, as not

13

meaning that any detectable discharge is prohibited, but

14

meaning that any detectable impact on any of the water

15

quality parameters set forth in describing the quality

16

standards for Oklahoma waters would be violated.

17

QUESTION:

What it boils down to then, is that

18

in order to sustain EPA, a court would have to say that

19

the prohibition of any new point source discharge can be

20

read to allow a new point source discharge if the effect

21

of it is not detectable at the relevant point downstream.

22

That's sort of the nub of the reasonable interpretation

23

issue, isn't it?

24
25

MR. WALLACE:
goes.

That is correct insofar as to

And so from the

Now, I just want to say very briefly before

10
11

reserving the balance of my time, that this is a very --a

case of very practical significance.

would say that, well, whether EPA's interpretation was

reasonable or not, it got this particular State's law

Now, a State can be as idiosyncratic or quixotic

2

as it wants to be within constitutional limitations in

apply its law within the State, but it would frustrate the

unpredictability.

reason.

Does EPA have that much authority in 303?
MR. BUTKIN:

Justice, I think Congress made the

tough call.

14

because I think the whole statutory scheme focuses or

contemplates on these federally approved water quality

standards being enforced to avoid a situation where State
