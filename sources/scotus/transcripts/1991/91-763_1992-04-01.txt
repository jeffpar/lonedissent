ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. DAVIS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. DAVIS:

12

Spectators are

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question we are addressing today involves

13
14

the availability of U.S. courts to dispute between two

15

Panamanian and one Swiss entity on the one hand, and the

16

Government of Argentina and its Central Bank on the other

17

hand.

18

be satisfied.

19

For this exception to apply two requirements must

First it must be demonstrated that when the

20

Central Bank financed its own obligations to provide

21

dollars under a foreign exchange rate assurance program

22

through the issuance of bonds instead of supplying the

23

promised foreign exchange, that the Central Bank committed

24

a commercial as opposed to a sovereign act.

25

Second, it must be demonstrated that there is a

these non-U.S. entities when no United States person

suffered any financial loss and the United States'

connection with the transaction is that under the bonds

New York became the place of payment after being selected

6

by these plaintiffs from four possible choices.

QUESTION:

Mr. Davis, what is a Bonod?

Is that

an acronym for something?

9

MR. DAVIS:

It is the actual name that was given

10

to the instrument, Bonod as opposed to bond.

11

purposes it is a bond, it is just the official name of the

12

bond.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

For our

They just made up a whole new word?

It doesn't stand for anything, Bonod?
MR. DAVIS:

It does not.

It does not.

It was

16

delivered by the Central Bank as one of two alternative

17

instruments.

18

1982 when the Central Bank's obligation had matured under

19

a program that it had implemented in 1981 to provide

20

foreign exchange at a fixed exchange rate.

21

They had a Bonod and a promissory note in

This was part of the Central Bank's primary

22

functions because when we talk about the Argentine Central

23

Bank we are talking about a classic central bank in the

24

sense that it's explicitly prohibited from participating

25

in commercial enterprises, and one of its primary

responsibilities is the issuance, regulating the foreign

2

exchange markets, determining how foreign exchange should

3

be allocated, establishing foreign exchange rates and

4

policies, and providing counsel in those areas to the

5

Republic.

6

In 1981 the government, the Central Bank created

7

a program where for new and renewed loans it fixed through

8

a, use of a specified formula the exchange rate that would

9

be used when these various debts matured.

It did this to

10

provide a cut off of credit to, foreign credit to

11

Argentina because of the rapid and unpredictable

12

devaluation of the Argentine currency.

13

When the Central Bank's obligation under this

14

1981 program matured and it was obligated to provide

15

dollars to, as the foreign exchange in connection with its

16

functioning as the government's responsible agent for

17

foreign exchange, it didn't have the necessary reserves

18

and thus what the Central Bank did is it issued two types

19

of instruments, the promissory note and the issue, the

20

instrument at issue in this case, the Bonod.

21

In considering the first issue, therefore,

22

whether the Central Bank's issuance of the Bonod was

23

commercial or sovereign, we have an instrument with the

24

following characteristics.

I said before, the Central Bank's own obligation under the

1981 foreign exchange rate program.

promissory note which I referred to as the other

5

instrument that was issued roughly contemporaneously with

6

the Bonod, it contained no language purporting to submit

7

to jurisdiction anyplace.

9

It in of itself raised no money.

QUESTION:

It financed, as

And unlike the

If we're going to look that far

behind the surface of the Bonod, don't -- that its

10

ultimate objective was to finance foreign commercial

11

exchange in trading relationships between Argentina and

12

other parts of the world?

13

MR. DAVIS:

But it was doing it not as -- you

14

know, sometimes some of the legislative history talks to

15

in terms of entering the commercial marketplace.

16

doing it by

QUESTION:

It was

It was doing it so somebody else

could stay in the commercial marketplace.
MR. DAVIS:

Yes, but it was doing it in

20

implementing a basic sovereign function, that is exchange

21

rate policy.

22

governments may do, undertake a variety of actions which

23

facilitate on a broad base their citizens to participate

24

in markets.

1

that broad base therefore non-commercial in your view?
MR. DAVIS:

2

Not, not anything, but I do think

3

that a kind of program that goes to where the courts have,

4

in looking at foreign exchange have recognized that the

5

regulation of foreign exchange markets are one of the core

6

official responsibilities that -- and if you look at this

7

transaction, what it was doing is it was obligated to, as

8

one of its responsibilities, to provide foreign exchange.

9

It came the time to provide the foreign exchange, it

10

lacked the necessary reserves, and what it did is it just

11

substituted the Bonod for the foreign exchange.
We would say if the government had issued the

12

13

foreign exchange that would be doing what the government

14

does, issuing the foreign exchange, provide the foreign

15

exchange.

16

think that the nature of that activity is still the same.

17

It couldn't do that.

QUESTION:

It issued the Bonod.

We

But it had issued the Bonod because

18

in effect it was trying to find a means, or it had

19

originally been trying to find a means of standing behind,

20

as it were, the private trading entities of the country,

21

and therefore it was, it had a rather more specific

22

purpose in a more specific temporal period of the market

23

than merely creating a foreign exchange structure in the

24

general sense.

than what a private party would do.

QUESTION:

It was in a sense

you're saying is that its purpose was a governmental

commercial or not, will not be determined by reference to

issued for.

18

You're describing the reason it was doing it and
But the statute explicitly says that the

It seems to me you have a commercial

MR. DAVIS:

Well, we think that the reason we

19

think we are looking at the nature is because what we're

20

saying is that when the statute, as you point out, says

21

you should look at the nature of the activity, it's not

22

saying that you should look at the nature of some abstract

23

activity.

This debt was issued in terms of without

goods, and it was issued for purpose of financing the own

6

obligation.

7

QUESTION:

It was issued, you know,

It was issued without financing

The question is whether it's a

8

commercial act, and you don't think it's a commercial act

9

to in effect guarantee to someone else the payment by

10

someone who is purchasing goods?

11

whatever motive, for the government and I want my

12

businesses to flourish, I come in and act as a guarantor

13

in a commercial transaction, that is not a commercial act?

14

MR. DAVIS:

If I come in for

I think it could be considered a

15

commercial act if it was guaranteeing.

16

it was not guaranteeing, because the normal credit

17

responsibility remained upon the private sector borrower.

18

What I mean by that is the private sector borrower was

19

still required to provide the pesos.

20

government did was assume the responsibility for what its

21

sovereign function was, which was to issue the foreign

22

exchange.

I consider it fulfilling the foreign

exchange responsibility.

QUESTION:

I also say --

You can call it that, but in fact

they are guaranteeing that these pesos are going to be

worth something in the international exchange.

Through doing what the Central Bank

does.

believe doesn't require or support looking at the nature

I also think that in addition to the fact that the

of an abstract activity.
I think there are two other things that are

12

relevant in the legislative history.

One is that there's

13

a lot of reference in the various briefs and some of the

14

cases is that the criteria is whether a private party

15

could do something.

16

in the other briefs, if it could do something it is

17

automatically considered commercial.

18

back to the legislative history that is cited, however, is

19

what it says is if a private party might do something,

20

then it could be considered commercial, not would

21

automatically.

22

history in the House report would say in that

23

circumstances it could be, not automatic.

And when you read some of the cases

If you actually go

I think the language in the legislative

The other reference that is often used in terms

25

of the legislative history is borrowing money would be an

1

example of a commercial activity, and what we would say is

2

that the commercial activity, excuse me, that here that's

3

why we look not to some broad based rule, because we

4

understand that in the overwhelming percentage of the

5

cases the issuance of debt is going to be a commercial

act.

7

to have a circumstance where parties can and do secure

8

waivers of sovereign immunity.

9

circumstances in reality.

We also understand that in a gray area you're going

That's going to be the

What we're saying, however, is where you have an

10
11

instrument in which the Central Bank through the issuance

12

of the Bonods raised no money, financed no goods, no

13

acquisition of goods, and at the same time was financing

14

its own obligation to provide foreign exchange, that the

15

nature of that is a sovereign act and not a commercial

16

act.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Davis, if we were to

18

disagree with you and conclude that jurisdiction was

19

appropriate here, do you suppose Argentina can still

20

assert on the merits an act of state defense in the

21

litigation?

22

MR. DAVIS:

There would be an issue, and I think

23

there is some learning in the Second Circuit which we do

24

not necessarily subscribe to which would make it difficult

25

in the Allied Bank case.

We do think that this was an

2

government of Argentina.

3

defenses raised, but it would be, we would, at least in

4

terms of the Second Circuit, be faced with the Allied Bank

5

decision which would foreclose that in terms of our

6

argument until we got to this Court.

That could be one of the

7

Before leaving the commercial activity aspect

8

and going to the second point, I just want to point out
sort of our analysis that I think is consistent with what

10

the courts have done when they have looked for example at

11

the contract cases, where they have said a contract of

12

employment, yes, that is something private parties do, but

13

if it's the employment of a diplomat in the United States,

14

that would be sovereign.

15

else to perform a commercial function, then that would be

16

commercial.

17

they look to see what the real nature is.

18

If it's employment of somebody

And they just don't look at the last act,

And we think that that's also the position the

1

Government took not in this case, the U.S. Government took

20

not in this case but took in the Izvestia case in the

21

Ninth Circuit in which it argued that you had to look

22

beyond the fact that Izvestia was a newspaper and look to

23

that its nature as the official organ.

dispute because in enacting the Foreign Sovereign

Immunities Act it is also clear that the Congress didn't

2

want to convert our courts into international courts of

3

claims and allow disputes to be heard here by people with

no, where the plaintiffs had no meaningful connection with

5

the United States.

effect nexus requirement which required some direct effect

7

in the United States from the sovereign's commercial act

8

even if it is determined to be commercial.

9

It did this by creating the direct

Now, the Government, the U.S. Government and the

10

respondents urge a test essentially which says that

11

anytime place of payment is in the United States and it's

12

a dollar transaction, that is sufficient.

13

essentially urge a test which would say that if an

14

Algerian state enterprise purchased machinery from a

15

private Tunisian company next door, that, and they

16

happened to have dollar payment, therefore it provided for

17

a promissory note to be paid in the United States, that

18

U.S. courts should hear that dispute.

19

They

We believe that you need go no further than the

20

language of the statute which requires that the direct

21

effect be in the United States in order to determine that

22

this proposition is erroneous and that the proper approach

23

would require that the place of payment be in the United

24

States and that the plaintiff be a U.S. person.

25

where there's a great weight attributed by the amicus and

Because

1

the respondents to this sole connection which is the place

2

of payment, and while they have built it, tried to build

3

it up in their briefs by talking in terms of that you

4

actually paid there, I think that is the attributes of a

5

place of payment is that you do pay there.
QUESTION:

6

Well, Mr. Davis, I take it you take

7

the position that a foreign corporation can never sue

under the direct effects provision in the U.S.
MR. DAVIS:

9
10

Well, I think that it would

require --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DAVIS:

Is that right?
I think it would require that the

13

transaction have many more connections with the United

14

States than mere place of payment, perhaps if --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, place of payment can be vitally

important, can it not?
MR. DAVIS:

I think the place of payment an be

18

vitally important, but place of payment really is a

19

characteristic of the transaction.

20

creates the effect.

21

consequence, and the tangible consequence that I think

22

exists is somebody lost money in this circumstance.

23

what was, the money was here lost by the two Panamanian

24

and the Swiss entities, and that that's just simply not a

25

direct effect in the United States.

We don't think it

The effect is really some tangible

And

1

We do think that perhaps if there had been some

2

additional activity, some negotiations in the United

3

States, that perhaps you might be in a closer case where

4

the direct effect could be satisfied, although obviously

5

if you reached a point where the loan agreement was

6

executed in the United States you probably would be

7

dealing with a different provision and not the direct

8

effect provision.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Davis, doesn't your argument sort

10

of make light of the fact that when there are transactions

11

between parties with governments whose currency is not

12

accepted as foreign exchange that the very fact of the

13

transactions taking place requires in effect an

14

enforceable term, such as the place of payment term, and a

15

means of enforcing that place of payment term where the

16

parties designate?

17

kind of incidental side issue in these transactions.

18

would suppose that it is central to the very possibility

19

of a great many of these transactions.

20

In other words this isn't merely a
I

And if you accept that as a premise, then do you

21

not find a much more substantial dimension to the effect,

22

i.e. the refusal of payment or the refusal of credit, in

23

the place designated?

24
25

MR. DAVIS:

Well, I think that, Justice Souter,

you refer to two aspects of the place of payment.

In one

1

you talked about the means of enforcing a right, and I

2

think those are two different things.

3

yes, place of payment is one provision and that is

4

considered important, and I think that that is done for

5

the convenience of the parties.

6

focus on the means of enforcement they focus on provisions

7

that are very common in international instruments, that is

8

actual submissions to jurisdiction.

That they're --

I think when parties

And indeed in this case you had two different

9
10

instruments that were issued.

11

which is not the instrument which is, which these parties

12

held.

13

have on the other hand the Bonod which contained no such

14

provision.

15

One is the promissory note

That contained a submission to jurisdiction.

You

So I think that when the parties in

16

international lending transactions do want to focus on how

17

to enforce their rights and enforce their remedies, they

18

focus on choice of law provisions, which is not present in

19

this instrument, they focus on submissions to

20

jurisdiction.

21

I think is more for commercial convenience.

22

They don't focus on - - the place of payment

QUESTION:

Well, I'll grant you that up to a

23

point, but you're not claiming that the terms of the Bonod

24

are governed somehow by the terms of the note, are you?

No, I'm just using that -16

Bonod is not, presumably, unless we were to come up with a

3

rule which you're not even asking for, the holders of the

4

Bonod would not look to the note in order to determine

5

what, what they may enforce and where they may enforce it.

6

And if the Bonod itself contains no submission to

7

jurisdiction, if it contains no term even governing the

8

point, isn't the most reasonable expectation commercially

9

that in fact it will be enforceable in the place

10
11

designated for payment?
MR. DAVIS:

I don't necessarily think that's

12

correct, because if you look at the Bonod, I mean, it

13

references, you know, Argentine decrees and Argentine law,

14

and while the promissory note does not, you don't use it

15

to interpret the language of the Bonod, the fact of the

16

matter is that the instruments were made available at the

17

same time and that therefore parties could know that there

18

was another instrument which contained explicit

19

submissions.

20

in international lending transactions for parties to

21

understand that the vehicles for protection when they're

MR. DAVIS:

One possibility is Argentina.

And

4

it may be, and I think this Court has frankly recognized

5

in the sovereign immunity context in the Argentine v. Hess

case, that there may be circumstances where they have no

7

remedy because they dealt with a sovereign and didn't

QUESTION:

Well you, in that case I take it you

10

would agree that there wouldn't be a very bustling market

11

in Bonods if everybody understood that you had to go to

12

Argentina to collect.

13

MR. DAVIS:

Well, I think that in terms of the

14

market in Bonods it was, you know, an instrument that at

15

the time it was issued it was issued as, to go back to the

16

first point, really in substitute for foreign exchange.

we are going to treat this essentially as a commercial

transaction.

22

there wouldn't be much of a market if one had to go to

23

Argentina for it, and therefore we ought to look to some

24

commercial expectation in determining whether in fact it

25

should be enforceable in the place designated for payment?

Wouldn't it then be true, as I said, that

MR. DAVIS:

1

Well, I think that whether there

would or would not be a commercial market in fact for an

instrument that doesn't contain submissions to

jurisdiction, I think doesn't determine the expectations

of the party.

it makes it a less attractive instrument and which it is

the reason why there was much, a smaller percentage of

people took the Bonods than took the promissory notes.

would satisfy the direct effect requirement which is still

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD W. CUTLER

MR. CUTLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our argument is the plain meaning of the Foreign

Sovereign Immunities Act.

The statute says that a

commercial activity is to be judged by its nature, not its

purpose.

That is their word, that is not

The context is really just a code word for purpose.

10

And one of the difficulties is that it wholly obliterates

11

the idea of restrictive sovereign immunity because every

sovereign is going to find some public purpose ultimately

13

to justify whatever acts it takes.

14

There is another possibility that is even more

15

disturbing, and that is once purpose becomes an issue the

And the suggestion that

10

somehow our people have to get a waiver before there is a

12

that goes beyond restrictive foreign sovereign immunity.

13

The idea of sovereign immunity is that a sovereign may be

14

brought to U.S. court against its will because of the

15

nature of the instrument it issues, because of its

16

conduct, and of course because of the direct effect in the

17

United States.

18

The direct effect, we have said right from the

19

beginning, Your Honor, right from the district court on up

20

to here, was that there was a expectation of payment in

21

the United States, in New York City.

They didn't do it, and the

effect was felt right here.

That effect in New York, I would make very clear

The effect was certainly foreseeable.

In this

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

We submit that Argentina is subject to suit

15

based on its failure to honor debt instruments that it

16

issued to private creditors and that are payable in the

17

United States.

18

Argentina has engaged in a commercial activity, and we

19

think there is little room to dispute that Argentina's

20

issuance of Bonods is just such an activity.

21

The initial question here is whether

As Argentina acknowledges, a Bonod is a debt

22

instrument issued to private creditors that entitles the

23

holder to repayment of principal with interest.

24

not differ in its essential terms from a bond or debt

25

instrument that a business corporation might issue.

It does

When Argentina issued its Bonods it borrowed

1

2

money in the international debt market and it thereby

3

engaged in a commercial activity.

4

especially compelling here where Argentina issued its

5

Bonods as substitutes for payment of preexisting private

6

commercial obligations.

7

That conclusion is

At bottom Argentina really does not challenge

8

the commercial character of the debt instruments.

Rather

9

it simply argues that it had a public purpose in issuing

10

them.

As the lower courts correctly pointed out, however,

11

the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act instructs that the

12

commercial character of an activity must be judged on the

13

basis of its nature rather than its purpose.
QUESTION:

14

Mr. Minear, do you agree with, accept

15

the answer that Justice Scalia got that, to his question,

16

that if a Bonod or any instrument had been issued for

17

purposes of foreign aid that that could be considered when

18

we decide whether the act applies or not?

19

MR. MINEAR:

We think that might well be a

20

commercial activity if it was, if the payment was made in

21

the form of a commercial debt instrument that obligated

22

the United States to pay money to a private creditor.

In other words you're saying that

you're saying that the way to solve this problem that

Justice Scalia and I both seem to have is to say at least

don't look beyond the instrument itself.

MR. MINEAR:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That's correct.

If it says this is a potato note,

6

that's one thing.

7

and this is a foreign aid note, that's another thing.

8

just stop at that point is what you're saying.

If it's payable to a foreign sovereign

MR. MINEAR:

With respect to debt instruments I

10

think that provides a very workable rule and it also

11

provides certainty in the marketplace.

We

Now once the Court has asserted that the

13

complaint here identifies a commercial activity the next

14

question is whether the commercial activity has a

15

sufficient nexus with the United States.

16

concluded that Argentina's unilateral rescheduling of its

17

debt payments caused a direct effect in the United States

18

because the rescheduling resulted in Argentina breaching

19

its obligation to repay a debt that was legally obligated

20

to pay in this country.

21

22

QUESTION:

The lower courts

Do you think nexus is the same as a

direct effect?

One, if it takes place in the United

2

States, two, if an act in connection with the activity

3

takes place in the United States, or three, if there is an

4

act outside the territory of the United States that has a

5

direct effect in the United States.
Now in this case the way that the respondents

6

7

have structured their complaint, and they are masters of

8

their complaint in this context, is that the commercial

9

activity is the issuance of the Bonods.

The act outside

10

the territory of the United States is the rescheduling of

11

the debt payments.

12

is the breach of the obligation to pay here.

13

The direct effect in the United States

Now, as the Justices alluded to earlier, this

14

could also conceivably fit into the second clause of the

15

provision, particularly if you're willing to look to the

16

legislative history and the House report that notes that

17

an omission can be treated as an act for purposes of the

18

second clause.

MR. MINEAR:

these three clauses do overlap to some extent, and that's

true.

and I think the reason for

1

first or second clause.

Now

2

this should be quite clear, that creditors lend money in

3

the expectation that they're going to be repaid, and the

4

choice of the place of payment is central to their

5

expectations.

6

performance of the debtor's contractual obligation.

7

Now, when a debtor breaches its repayment

And simply put it is the place of

8

obligation it has a direct effect at the designated place

9

of performance because that is where the breach of the

10

contract takes place.

11

Argentina's breach of its obligation or of the Bonods has

12

a direct effect here in the United States, which was

13

designated by Argentina as the place of performance.

14

Thus it is proper to conclude that

Now this is also consistent with conflict of law

15

principles if one were to look to the second restatement

16

or the first restatement of conflicts.

17

cases indicate that the applicable law would be determined

18

on the basis of the place of performance in the case of a

19

debt transaction.

restatement, and section 370 of the first restatement.

21

it's hardly odd to suggest that the place of performance

22

shouldn't also not be the significant legal effect for

23

purposes of the FSIA and for purposes of determining

24

jurisdiction.

An international debt has increased risk and

In that case of the example that Mr. Davis gave
of a transaction between a Tunisian and Algerian

10

businessmen, they might well decide that the place of

11

payment should be in New York rather than in Tunis,

12

Algiers, or perhaps Tripoli, because that is the one place

13

where they can be certain that the rule of law would

14

govern their transaction.

15

And that we think is central to the United

16

States' interest in this case, the fact that the rule of

17

law does apply to commercial transactions carried out in

18

the United States.

19

Now, when a foreign state makes its debt

rather than its strictly an interpretation of this

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, I think that in terms

of the point that I am making here, that the, that this is

the policy that underlies the direct effects test and

underlies its application in this case.

9

QUESTION:

Well, how do we know that?

MR. MINEAR:

10

I think that we have to rely at

11

some level on what Congress was trying to achieve here,

12

which was to make sure that when a foreign nation enters

13

the commercial market it's subject to the same rules as

14

other parties would be.

15

debts payable in New York would be subject to New York

16

law.

17

QUESTION:

Now, other parties that made

Do you agree with the court of

appeals' observation that one of the purposes of Congress

19

in enacting this act was to make sure that New York City

kept its importance in the financial world?

MR. MINEAR:

I would -- no, Your Honor.

I would

22

not phrase it that way.

But I would say that Congress

23

here was concerned that, in the fact that the rule of law

24

would apply to commercial transactions that have a

25

substantial connection with the United States.

It is a

5

Now Argentina's approach, which would require a

6

court to ascertain the effect of a foreign state's breach

7

by examining where the creditor suffers its economic loss,

8

would produce an unpredictable and we think unworkable

9

standard for resolving the jurisdictional issue.

That is

10

particularly true in the case of negotiable instruments.

11

Under Argentina's approach a foreign state would be unable

12

to assess its own immunity or its own amenability to suits

13

in this country at the time that it issued its debt

14

instrument and thereafter, after it is exchanged to other

15

persons hands.

16

In sum, we submit this case provides an

17

opportunity to state a clear rule applicable to a broad

18

category of cases, and the rule should be this.

19

state is not immune from suits in the courts of this

20

country if it breaches a contractual obligation to repay a

21

debt instrument that can be held by a private creditor and

22

is payable in the United States.

states in structuring their debt offerings and determining
