ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. STARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case brings before the Court an issue

11

12

concerning the obligations of a prosecutor before a

13

Federal grand jury.

14

prosecutor is obligated, on pain of dismissal of the

15

indictment, to put before the grand jury substantial

16

exculpatory evidence.

17

upheld the dismissal of the seven-count indictment in this

18

case.

19

respondent had made false statements to four federally

20

insured institutions.

21

The Tenth Circuit has held that a

As a result, the court of appeals

That indictment charged in effect that the

The Tenth Circuit's rule in our view has no

22

foundation in the history of the grand jury.

And if it is

23

adopted, the Tenth Circuit's approach will have very high

24

costs, with complicated preliminary trials on guilt or

25

innocence prior to the trial itself.

This represents a

1

change, and we believe it's a significant change, in the

2

concept of the grand jury's function.

3

The grand jury is a screening mechanism.

It is

4

there to determine whether probable cause exists.

5

not an adversary proceeding, and thus historically, has

6

not been charged with evaluating defenses.

7

traditional role of the grand jury is quite limited.

8

Justice O'Connor stated in her opinion in Mechanik, it is

9

a group of citizens who are operating with a broad

It is

Indeed, the
As

10

mandated and under a few clear rules.

Those rules are

11

embodied in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

12

structure, the interposition of the grand jury between the

13

prosecutor and the citizen is itself a protection of

14

individual liberty.

15

QUESTION:

That

Well, Mr. -- General Starr, do you

16

take the position that never would it be appropriate for a

17

Federal district court judge, as a matter of exercise of

18

supervisory power over the courts, to dismiss without

19

prejudice a case in which there is a glaring failure of

20

the Government to present some evidence to the grand jury

21

that would have a direct bearing on whether the suspect is

22

indeed appropriately charged?

23

MR. STARR:

Our position is no.

In terms of

24

failure to adduce evidence, as opposed to what courts

25

have, seen historically is quite problematic.

And that is

1

the use of perjurious testimony or other forms of flagrant

2

misconduct.

3

But at common law --

QUESTION:

Now, if the prosecutor offered known

4

false testimony to the grand jury, do you think the court

5

then can, in the exercise and supervisory power, dismiss?

6

MR. STARR:

I think it can.

I think it does

7

need to take the issue through a harmless error analysis

8

to determine whether in fact, under the rules of this

9

Court as articulated in Nova Scotia, that that was

10

harmless error.

There are other mechanisms.

In short, if there's been wrongdoing of that

11
12

kind, it may very well be difficult to establish that it

13

was harmless error, but the court is - -

14

QUESTION:

What is your authority, Mr. Starr,

15

for answering Justice O'Connor's question that the use of

16

perjurious would warrant the dismissal of the indictment?

17
18

MR. STARR:

that directly holds that.

19
20
21

There is no authority in this Court

QUESTION:

Then why does the Government concede

MR. STARR:

The Government has no quarrel, Mr.

that?

22

Chief Justice, with the holdings of a number of lower

23

Federal courts that have concluded that the integrity of

24

the grand jury would be compromised if the prosecutor

25

knowingly uses material - - I would insert the word

at that point lack confidence in exactly what the grand

3

jury was doing.

4

QUESTION:

That is to say, we then

And so that would be open to try --

5

that would be open to a contested hearing as to whether

6

the prosecutor did in fact use perjurious testimony?

MR. STARR:

It has been, and the system has not

8

suffered as a result of that.

9

being - - although this Court has not spoken directly to

10

That, we view it, as

it -- the law in any number of circuits.

11

The new rule that the Tenth Circuit has now

12

imposed would have enormous costs as well as view the

13

grand jury in a very different light.

14

QUESTION:

But just before we leave this point

15

where you admit or concede, I think, but there is some

16

room for court intervention if there is flagrant,

17

misconduct, use of perjurious testimony.

18

reason why the indictment should be dismissed?

19

the grand jury right has not been accorded to the

20

petitioner?

But what is the
Because

Or because we have the duty to supervise the

MR. STARR:

Certainly not the latter.

We do

23

believe, with all respect, that while action can be taken

24

with respect to a particular prosecutor for conduct before

25

the court in a particular case, we do have difficulty with

1

a broad use of the idea of supervisory power to tell the

2

prosecutor how do discharge his obligation.

3

If I may now return to what our reason would be

4

for saying, yes, there is a problem in that grand jury

5

testimony because essentially the nest has been befouled.

6

It has been befouled by the knowing use of testimony that

7

is perjurious, and the grand jury may very well have acted

8

on the basis of that.
In contrast, as Blackstone, as we note in

9
10

footnote 3, Blackstone noted at common law it was unheard

11

of to be adducing defenses before the grand jury.

12

not what grand juries are charged with doing.

14

innocence.

QUESTION:
hearing?

That's

A befouled nest is not a grand jury

I mean, is that the formula?
MR. STARR:

I use that to make the point that

20

courts have been concerned about the integrity of the

21

grand jury's function that is compromised in terms of the

22

independence of the grand jury's judgement, if that

23

judgment has been influenced materially by evidence that

24

is perjurious or manufactured.

25

integrity and independence of the grand jury.

It goes to the idea of the

QUESTION:

Have the lower courts that have got

3

into this, as you've suggested they have, do they rely on

4

the supervisory power?

5

MR. STARR:

They typically don't lay this out,

6

Justice White, carefully.

7

due process, that it would be a violation of due process.

8

And not atypically, the analysis is in one or two

9

sentences.

10
11

13

At times they speak in terms of

Other times they speak in terms of supervisory

powers.
QUESTION:

They don't say that it's connected

with the requirement of having a grand jury indict.
MR. STARR:

It has been suggested by authorities

14

like Learned Hand and Henry Friendly that in fact you are

15

getting at the core notion of what the founders had in

16

mind, which is a grand jury whose integrity and

17

independence is respected by the prosecutor, and the

18

prosecutor fails to accord it that respect if it's using

19

perjurious testimony.

20

away from that.

21

QUESTION:

Again, this issue is light years

Well, no -- no one in this -- does

22

anyone in this case suggest that there's a constitutional

23

basis for --

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

No.
-- this rule?

MR. STARR:

1

The Tenth Circuit did not.

In fact,

2

the Tenth Circuit, both in the Page case and in this case,

3

did not set forth a foundation or basis for the use or

4

exercise of this particular power.

5

would be quite extreme to incorporate fundamental fairness

6

due process notions into this, since as we know, under the

7

well-settled holdings of this Court, there is no due

8

process right to grand jury proceedings in many States, or

9

a number of States -- I shouldn't say many.

10

A number of

States don't have grand -QUESTION:

11
12

And I do think it

Haven't we had a grand jury case

here?

13

MR. STARR:

Yes, you've had grand jury cases

14

here, but you've never held that's required as a matter of

15

fundamental fairness, and this my point is this.
QUESTION:

16
17

case before us?
MR. STARR:

18
19

Well, how did we get a grand jury

Oh, I'm sorry, this is a Federal

case.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. STARR:

Yes, I know.
And the point I'm making is in

22

Hurtado v. California, there was a due process challenge

23

to the failure to use a grand jury proceeding.

24

Court rejected the notion that it's fundamentally unfair,

25

as we would say in modern due process analysis, to deprive

And this

1

a citizen of that.

And thus, in a number of the States, a

2

prosecutor can sit in his or her offices and simply file

3

the charging -- write the charging materials, and not be

4

taking into account any, quote, exculpatory evidence.

5

That's the limited due process point.
I do want to emphasize in terms of this

6

7

proceeding that not only has the Tenth Circuit failed to

8

adduce a constitutional basis, and clearly there's no

9

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure that speaks to this.

10

In her opinion, Justice O'Connor spoke about the few clear

11

rules.

13

provisions.

This is new.

It is a new invention.

It is part

16

of the reform effort to reform the grand jury.

17

persons and commentators who have viewed the grand jury as

18

standing in need of reform have not gone this far.

19

Frankel, in his book, says, yes, it's a good idea, but you

20

certainly don't want to turn the process into a

21

preliminary trial before --

10

All right.

The question is

So suppose the prosecutor

puts on testimony of eye witnesses who say they saw this

13

alibi, iron clad, and he does not present that to the

that Attorney General Levy established, the Office of

Professional Responsibility in the Justice Department,

which receives complaints of this nature.

Kennedy, in Nova Scotia, suggested if a prosecutor is

That's true if you have a professional prosecutor who's

My second question I'd like to - I'm sorry.
-- I'd like to ask you is, as I

14

understand it, you could win this case on one of two

theories:

part of the prosecutor, or alternatively, that he didn't

violate the duty in this case because the evidence isn't

all that important.

they complied with it?

MR. STARR:

We did say --we have preserved this

issue, as we indicated in our certiorari petition.

question was passed on by the lower court.

4

challenge Page directly in the lower court because that

5

was the law of the circuit, and the Government won in

Page, and certiorari was denied by this Court by Mr. Page.

QUESTION:

I understand.

The

We did not

But you did not raise

8

the same question you're raising here in the lower court

9

because you did not challenge Page.

10

MR. STARR:

We did say that there is absolutely

11

no obligation on our part to do what we have been required

12

to do under these circumstances.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

When we - -

Yes, but you didn't say there was no

obligation of the kind you're describing here.
MR. STARR:

What we are taking issue with is the

16

law of the Tenth Circuit that has now been applied to us

17

in a case that we have lost.

18

Justice Stevens, go into a court of appeals when the law

19

of the circuit is settled and say we don't like the law of

20

the circuit.

QUESTION:

And we ordinarily do not,

Even if you want review in this Court

22

of that very point that you say is hamstringing your

ability to bring cases and all the rest?

2

substantial evidence that was withheld.

3

and that was ruled again - - we were ruled against in that

4

particular issue.

5

If that has been,

And we have now brought before this Court a

6

question.

And that question fairly encompasses this rule.

7

The underlying duty that was articulated by the Tenth

8

Circuit in Page, to say you must always adduce substantial

9

exculpatory evidence.
Now our concern, Justice Stevens, picking up

10
11

with your point, with the way -- and I think it shows the

12

perniciousness of the Tenth Circuit's approach -- if the

13

Court will look at page 8a of the petition appendix, it

14

will see how loose and far reaching the substantial

15

exculpatory standard is, as articulated by the Tenth

16

Circuit.

17

It is very broad and sweeping, indeed.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it's quite different say the

18

rule is too broad and acknowledge, as you did in your

19

brief there, that you have certain responsibilities to

20

produce evidence, which you did acknowledge in your brief.

21

MR. STARR:

Well, under the law of the circuit

That is correct.

Mr. Lang, we'll hear now from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. LANG

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LANG:

10
11
12

Very well, General Starr.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think at the outset it's important to note the

13

departmental policy of requiring the submission by

14

prosecutors to the grand jury of substantial exculpatory

15

evidence, which has been in effect for approximately 13

16

years, if my computation is correct.

17

under that in this justice system, and the Government has

18

operated under that as an internal policy for that period

19

of time, without it wrecking havoc on the system.

20

have here a rather unique situation, whereby actually the

21

Government has followed, apparently, their policy of

22

submitting this evidence to the grand juries.

23

hasn't crumbled.

obligation by motions to dismiss?
MR. LANG:

2

No, Your Honor, but I'm addressing

3

again the argument or position that was made by counsel

4

relative to the difficulty that would be incurred in the

5

Government determining what was exculpatory and presenting

6

it to the grand jury.

7

QUESTION:

I think I understand that, but I

8

thought another part of counsel's argument, which there's

9

no need for you to address unless you want to, is that

10

this rule would generate a number of - - contested motions

11

to dismiss in the district court, which do not exist

12

simply with the departmental policy in place.

13

MR. LANG:

Yes.

In regard to that aspect of the

14

argument, the Government, under its Brady obligation at

15

the commencement of the proceedings after the indictment,

16

is going to have to marshal its exculpatory evidence in

17

any event.

18

exculpatory at that point in time, because they're going

19

to have, assuming an indictment is returned, a Brady

20

obligation.

21

the difficulty of submitting it and knowing what it is,

22

it's going to have to be placed in the hands of the

23

defendant at that point in time.

They're going to have to know what is

1

cited in the reply brief of the Government, over the past

2

10 years, there have been fewer than 10 cases that

3

ultimately a dismissal has resulted on some such basis.

4

So the impact, I submit, is not great.

5

QUESTION:

Do the statistics reflect how many

6

such contested hearings there were, as well as how many

7

resulted in dismissal?
MR. LANG:

8

I believe in a reply brief it refers

9

to over 200,000 indictments -- 204,000 indictments as

10

opposed to the 10 cases that ultimately ended in that

11

manner.
QUESTION:

12

Does it refer to the number of those

13

cases in which there were hearings on a motion to dismiss

14

which the Government - - in which the defendant did not

15

prevail?

16

MR. LANG:

No, Your Honor, because again that

17

would not be a statistic gathered by the Government.

18

I might point out, because there was some

19

question also earlier, in terms of the cumbersome nature

20

of the five volumes of the testimony that were obtained

21

from a parallel bankruptcy proceeding, sometimes, when

22

we're talking about situations involving financial

23

institutions and the element of intent, particularly when

24

it gets to a situation of whether a bank was misled under

25

18 U.S.C. 1014, the idea gets to be -- well, this is such

1

a vague situation, how's anyone going to know whether this

2

is actually exculpatory and goes to that issue.

3

In regard to this particular case, the trial

4

court was quite specific, referring not only to specific

5

items that were explained by the transcript of the

6

testimony that went to the exact issue, the same

7

transcript that was not given to the grand jury, the same

8

transcript that in great detail, in five volumes,

9

explained why the balance sheet and income statement was

10

correct and why the defendant believed it was correct, his

11

beliefs concerning the asset values that he placed on the

12

assets that were the subject of the financial statements,

13

and a very thorough discussion in this particular

14

situation of the venture capital investments that this

15

particular defendant had made and why he believed the

16

numbers that he placed on those venture capital

17

investments were accurate.

18

So we have here a situation where not only are

19

there documents that are explained, but we have a lengthy

20

explanation by the defendant as to why he felt and why he

21

believed that his financial statements were accurate.

22

So even though this be, again, a case involving

23

a bank violation, it is a case whereby the exculpatory

24

nature of it is clear.

in the situation where there are 50 boxes and you say we

would have to evaluate whether the Government did a good

job of examining those 50 boxes.

10

MR. LANG:

In order for it to be meaningful,

Your Honor, and for there to be a meaningful rule, it

would be our position that it would have to be a

meaningful submission.

Now, in this particular case, of

the 40 boxes, which fully explain the particular aspects

of the balance sheet.

Government could have, as a matter of interest, simply

3

However, rather than do this rather simple

thing, we've gone through this appellate procedure.

would create some massive problem in the criminal system,

which were accumulated in the course of the investigation,

it again would have the duty to go through the boxes, to

find the --or the present the evidence in a circumstance.

Now, of course we can take this further down the

road and determine how many boxes and how it got it, and

what the circumstances were as to how they came by it.

But by the same token in - - again, in this particular
case, the Government knew it had the evidence in its

Here

QUESTION:

Mr. --

14

MR. LANG:

Yes.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Lang, why should the rule with

16

respect to exculpatory evidence, which is involved in this

17

case, be any different than the rule with respect to

18

hearsay evidence, which the Court said in the Costello

1

case was not a ground for objecting to a grand jury

20

indictment, or to evidence improperly seized in violation

21

of the Fourth Amendment, which in Calandra, the Court said

22

was not a basis for objecting to a grand jury indictment?

23

It seems to me this rule just goes against the grain of

24

that line of cases from this Court.

that the grand jury should have before it all possible

MR. LANG:

Yes, Your Honor, and that is part of

the opinion of the district court.
So we actually have here, for the purpose of the

22

consideration, a finding by the district court that has

23

been found not to be clearly erroneous by the Tenth

24

Circuit, that there was substantial exculpatory evidence,

25

that it was in the possession of the prosecutor, and that

it impacted on the decision of the grand jury to indict,

2

following completely the logic and --of Nova Scotia,

3

ultimately resulting in the dismissal.

4

And as I said, the upshot of the whole thing was

5

the prosecutor had the option at that point simply to take

6

what was considered to be substantially exculpatory, and

7

take it back before another grand jury, and then to see if

8

another indictment might be obtained.
If one was not returned, if one were not

10

returned by another grand jury, then perhaps the basic

11

reason why we would have the rule would be proved.

12

well be that they would take the deposition, read through

13

it, find that the defendant in this case was a very

14

intelligent and articulate gentleman, find that he was

15

very educated, find that the tried to do what he thought

16

was right in preparing his financial statements, and not

MR. LANG:

Okay.

That issue was raised in the

brief in terms of can the court determine what is

substantial evidence, and there were cited in the briefs

11

QUESTION:

But

what is your definition?

12

MR. LANG:

In the trial court -- and my

13

definition would relate to whether ultimately there might

14

be, or whether it is sufficient evidence which

15

cumulatively or singularly would cause a jury to not be

16

able to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

what the trial court in this court did.

in the opinion that he didn't -- that was his view of

that.

what is - -

MR. LANG:

1

Yes, Your Honor, that would be the

2

definition that we would urge on the Court since that was

3

what was done in this case.

the judge looked at the evidence in this case and

could figure out what that is, as opposed to what a

Well, I think the logic behind the

21

rule has been that if there's not sufficient evidence

before the grand jury, or if the evidence is before the

23

grand jury and is substantially exculpatory, that might be

24

sufficient to cause them not to be able to find ultimately

mean, I suppose the prosecutor can throw in anything he

wants to, and the grand jury can call for anything it

wants to.

MR. LANG:

Correct.

But there seems to be two

different things we're speaking about here.

proof and regard to probable cause.

22

One is the

Which seems to be, again, two different,

So, I may have misunderstood the question, but
there seems to be two different analyses involved in that.
The -- in this particular case, and I want to

emphasize the difference in what the grand jury is today

what it was some years ago.

100 percent, in reality, on the prosecutor.

a good deal of knowledge of what was going on.

16

that's simply not the case, as certain -- certainly

17

experience would tell us.

18

Today, the grand jury relies
In times

Today,

Today, the grand jury is the recipient of

19

evidence subpoenaed, obtained, acquired by the prosecutor.

20

They have literally no independent source of the evidence.

21

The agencies collect the evidence by either investigation

22

or subpoena, and they're provided to the grand jury

23

through the offices of the prosecutor.

24

then looks at the evidence and makes a determination as

25

far as the indictment is concerned.

in order to make a decision, that the grand jury must be

the evidence that might not be admissible in court,

grand jury all possible evidence.

evidence relative to the particular case.

You say that the policy is that they have to be fully

Justice Kennedy earlier, you would not argue that an

indictment could be set aside if the prosecutor came in

with the exculpatory -- after producing considerable

incriminating evidence, overwhelming, he then comes in

20

with some exculpatory evidence, but the form that the
