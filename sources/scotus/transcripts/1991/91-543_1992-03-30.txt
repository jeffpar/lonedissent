ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER H. SCHIFF

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SCHIFF:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The petitioners in this case challenge the

13

constitutionality of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste

14

Policy Amendments Act of 1985 as being in violation of the

15

Federal system, and specifically we place our reliance on

16

the Tenth Amendment and the Guaranty Clause.

17

that Congress certainly has the power under the Commerce

18

Clause to deal with the subject of the disposal of low-

19

level radioactive waste, but it is our position that the

20

means that it has chosen here is constitutionally

21

defective.

We recognize

This act is directed solely at the states and

22

23

makes the states responsible for the disposal of low-

24

level radioactive waste that is generated within the

25

state.

It makes the states responsible for the

1

disposition of the waste of private generators, Federal

2

generators, as well as any that is generated by the state

3

itself.

4

requires the states to stay, to enter and to stay in the

5

field of low-level, disposal of low-level radioactive

6

waste.

This is a totally mandatory provision which

7

The mandate is made particularly effective by

8

the so-called take title provision which specifies that if

9

the state has not otherwise provided for the disposal of

10

low-level radioactive waste by January 1, 1996 that the

11

state must take title of any such waste, and if it doesn't

12

accept possession that it becomes liable for any, to the

13

other generators if there are any damages, direct or

14

indirect.

15

are simply ordered by Congress to enter this activity.

16

The statute is truly unique in the annals of

In other words, one way or the other the states

17

American jurisprudence.

18

where the states have simply been mandated to take part in

19

a particular activity.

20

We know of no other situation

In the past what Congress has done, it has

21

essentially recruited the states in one of two ways to do

22

the regulation that the Federal Government would like to

23

have done.

24

the land mine, surface act, it gives the states an option.

25

You regulate according to the standards set out by the

1

Federal Government, or otherwise we, the Federal

2

Government, will do the regulation itself.
The other means that they have chosen is the

3
4

Spending Clause, and to provide Federal money as an

5

inducement for the states to do regulation in accordance

6

with Federal standards.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Schiff, is that all this case is

8

about, that Congress is going to have to tie New York's

9

continuing receipt of highway funds to its assumption of

10

this responsibility?
MR. SCHIFF:

11

Well, if that is legal, but it

12

hasn't done that, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

It seems like a lot of trouble for

14

very little, very little point.

15

MR. SCHIFF:

Well, it's our position that the

16

means that the Congress uses is a very important

17

consideration in the constitutional structure of this, of

18

the Government.

19

Constitution contemplates two sets of sovereigns and that

20

the states are intended to have the choice as to which

21

activities they will participate in.

22

means that the Congress chooses is by no means a minor

23

one.

24

serious incursion on the constitutional structure.

25

It is our basic position that the

So we think that the

We think it is a vital one, and we think it's a

QUESTION:

Mr. Schiff, do you suppose Congress

1

could provide that a state without a site for radioactive

2

waste, that no shipments of radioactive waste could be

3

sent out of state?

4

MR. SCHIFF:

Yes, we think that's perfectly

5

acceptable.

6

never objected to that separately.

7

not a, what this case is all about either.
QUESTION:

10

We have no problem, and we have not, have

Let me ask you another question.

If

we were to agree with you on the take title provision, is
it severable?

11

MR. SCHIFF:

12

QUESTION:

13

But we think that's *

We think not.
Why not?

Don't you think Congress

would probably have enacted this law absent that clause?

14

MR. SCHIFF:

Well, as we point out in our brief,

15

we think the legislative history, all of which really

16

shows up in the congressional record I think on December

17

19 of 1985, the day that this law was passed, shows that

18

the, we don't think it would have been passed by simply

19

excising the take title provision.

20

law would have been passed, but it may have been something

21

very different.

22

clear, as we think it is, they wouldn't have passed the

23

legislation by simply excising the provision.

24

not severable, and there isn't any severability clause

25

here.

We think probably some

And as we read your cases that, if it is

Then it's

Well, I would have thought the

problems were so acute that they probably would have

passed it without that clause.

4

provision.

5

appeared rather at the last minute, didn't it?

We don't know exactly where it came from.

MR. SCHIFF:

6

We don't know -- that
It

Well, as we read the legislative

7

history, it came at the instance of the governors of the

8

so-called sited states, ones that had disposal sites, and

9

they made it plain that they did not think that the

10

legislation as it stood at that point was sufficiently, it

11

didn't have enough teeth.

12

the same thing that happened under the 1980 act would

13

happen with respect to the 1985 act, so they said we need

14

teeth.

15

And they were concerned that

However, the question of, this Court will have

16

to decide whether it is severable or not, and all I can do

17

is I think refer the Court, in addition to what I have

18

said here on severability, to our brief and commend that

19

you examine that legislative history.

20
21

22

I suppose the threshold question before the
Court in light of the Garcia decision which the -QUESTION:

What do we do if there's no

23

legislative history, or we don't think any of it is very

24

convincing?

25

might find that to be the case?

Do you have any advice for those of us who

1

MR. SCHIFF:

2

QUESTION:

Well, I think -How do we decide severability?

I

3

thought we decide it on the basis of simply whether the

4

statute works without the provision.

5

MR. SCHIFF:

Does it make sense.

Well, I think there are two

6

elements, Justice Scalia.

If it works is the second

7

element, but the first element is whether it's apparent

8

that it would not have been passed without it.

9

that it would be, if one doesn't look at the legislative

It may be

10

history in this case, you might reach the conclusion that

11

it is severable, because I'm’not sure you can tell for

12

sure that it would not have passed.

13

for those who do look at legislative history we think that

14

the law, that it is apparent that it would not have been

15

passed in that form by simply excising the take title

16

provision.

17
18

QUESTION:

MR. SCHIFF:

23

Yes.

As I recall it it originated

in the Senate.
QUESTION:

21
22

Well, did the title provision

originate in the Senate?

19
20

But for those of us,

And your senator was all for it, I

take it?
MR. SCHIFF:

Senator Moynihan supported the

24

legislation.

25

-- that is correct, but I will discuss that slightly

We don't think that -- well, if I may I will

He wasn't representing the State of

New York anyway, was he?

8

That's all right.

Not in a constitutional sense, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

He was representing the people of New

York, wasn't he?
MR. SCHIFF:

He was representing the people of

12

New York and he was acting as a senator, but he was not

13

representing the constituted government of the State of

14

New York which has to speak through the legislature and

15

the governor.

about, that the, that the constitutional system does

contemplate action through the state legislatures and

through the state governments.

And that is I think what this case is all

We think that is what the

that very little else would fit in any better than the

present case.

And we think that, contrary to the decisions

QUESTION:

In fact we suggest

How exactly does this act of Congress

violate the Tenth Amendment in your view?
MR. SCHIFF:

Because this act regulates not so

much commerce as it regulates the states.

It picks put

10

the states and simply directs the states, that you must do

11

a particular activity.

12

think the decision as to whether to act with respect to

13

engaging in a particular activity is one that is reserved

14

to the states under the Tenth Amendment.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

We think that is not a power --we

Well, how about where Congress

regulates a state-owned railroad?
MR. SCHIFF:

Well, this is - - the difference

18

between this case and those cases, Your Honor, is that

19

there what Congress is doing is to regulate an activity

20

that the state has already chosen to undertake.

21

withdraw from that activity if it chose.

22

the kind of case that was involved in the trilogy of Fair

23

Labor Standards Act cases, Wertz, National League of

24

Cities, and the Garcia case.

25

that was involved in South Carolina against Baker, where

It could

1

the Federal Government decided generally not to permit

2

unregistered bonds if people chose to issue bonds, and, as

3

to states, if they were tax free.

4

across the board generally.

5

QUESTION:

But it was applying

You say the Congress just included

6

states among the people it was regulating for carrying on

7

a certain activity and it didn't single out states?

8

9

MR. SCHIFF:

That's right.

This case is in many

. ways analogous to an earlier New York against United

10

States case, the one involving the taxing of the waters

11

from Saratoga Springs that were sold by the State of New

12

York, where the Court did say that you could tax New York

13

if you're taxing them like everyone else, but the Court,

14

admittedly by way of dicta, made it plain that the

15

situation would have been very different if you're simply

16

singling out the states and simply taxing them.

17

whole Court seemed to think that that, said that that

18

would be unconstitutional.

the problem here.

20

And the

And we think that's precisely

This is a problem in this case that was

essentially left open or avoided, if I might, in FERC

Mr. Schiff, are you asking that

No.

We think FERC is quite

distinguishable.

The majority of this Court ifi FERC made

it quite clear that the state had a choice.

13

do because it didn't have to regulate public utilities,

It didn't

Well, you know that it, you know

MR. SCHIFF:

Well, that's what some of the,

18

that's what the dissenters indicated, and I'm not -- but

19

the fact of the matter is that the decision as it was

20

written indicated quite plainly that that was critical to

21

that decision.

QUESTION:

What are the underlying values that

23

you're trying to further by the Tenth Amendment argument

that you urge upon us?

Is it, is this simply just a

1

2

or is there something more substantial?
MR. SCHIFF:

Well, we think, Justice Kennedy,

3

that, as Justice O'Connor's opinion recently in the

4

Ashcroft case indicated, that the Federal system is a very

5

significant element in the constitutional structure, so we

6

don't think it's a matter of etiquette.

7

is important for the states to be able to determine when

8

to undertake activities, where to place their resources --

9

QUESTION:

We think that it

Is that so that the states can be

10

held accountable to their own political constituencies for

11

the results they reach?

12

MR. SCHIFF:

13

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
Do you think that the state would be

14

any less clear in the responsibility it had to its

15

constituencies if the Federal Government had enacted the

16

statute such as Justice O'Connor proposed earlier, that no

17

nuclear, no nuclear waste could be shipped out of a state

18

unless all of these conditions are met?

19

what the state has done here, or what the Federal

20

Government has done here at least makes it clear who bears

21

the responsibility for this scheme of regulation.

22

MR. SCHIFF:

It seems to me

We think that, for one thing it is

23

the question of -- waste can be stored as opposed to

24

disposed of on a short-term basis, short-term basis

25

meaning quite a few years.

That's certainly what is being

1

done with respect to high-level radioactive waste.

2

it's not as if, this isn't a question of whether we have

3

to ship it out of state or not.

4

whether we have to do this according to the drum beat of

5

the Federal Government where they don't choose to do it.

6

Actually we're subject to Federal regulation, we're being

7

given a time table which we're not convinced is meaningful

8

or desirable for the people of the State of New York.

9

So

It's a question of

So in that context we think the Federal

10

Government should be doing the regulation rather than

11

imposing its will directly on us.

of shipping it out.

14

And it's not a matter

It's a matter of how we control our

I do want to say that, perhaps in conjunction

15

with your question, that it is argued by our opponents

16

that this is really, was an agreement among the states,

17

and that somehow that is the way the Federal system is

18

supposed to operate.

19

here.

20

compacts, which again involves the formal action of

21

various state legislatures and the executive, but you

22

don't do agreements by having lobbying activities, even

23

from the Governors' Association or other similar groups

24

and say that represents a state agreement.

25

Now we just don't understand that

The Constitution does provide for agreements though

1

seem to me that if the Federal Government just sat down

2

for a bit with a pencil and paper it could devise some

3

sort of constitutional scheme to accomplish precisely this

4

result.

5

that is being served by our accepting your argument.

So I wonder what the underlying value served,

MR. SCHIFF:

6

Well, Justice Kennedy, we think the

7

Government could also probably find an appropriate means

8

of doing it.

9

we think that this opens up a Pandora's box.

The problem is that they didn't do it, and

QUESTION:

10

Well, Mr. £chiff, I suppose there's a

11

difference between offering incentives to the states to

12

make their own choices and simply mandating that those

13

choices be made.

Isn't that right?

14

MR. SCHIFF:

15

QUESTION:

That's precisely our position.
Now, I suppose that finding a

16

location for radioactive waste is a little like trying to

17

find a location for a prison.

18

have these locations, but no one wants it in their state,

19

their community, their county, their city.

right?

Honor, no, it's not totally correct.

except that I know our experience in New York is that

2

there are some areas that want prisons because of the

income that it

4

QUESTION:

Well, those are pretty few and far

5

between, and I suppose it's not very attractive to

6

Congress to have to make that choice, and this is a rather

7

clever way of shifting responsibility for making the

8

choice to the states, which is politically very

MR. SCHIFF:

10

Well, we agree with that position,

There's no Tenth Amendment that

Would it have made any difference to

is just a budget problem for New York?
MR. SCHIFF:

20

No, I don't think so.

not.

And by the way, I should say that the Government

somehow thinks in its brief that the Spending Clause is

involved here because of the payments that go from the,

1

various elements of what makes up the argument that the

2

Federal system is vital to the constitutional structure.
QUESTION:

3

Do you think Congress can pass a law

4

that's generally applicable around the country that says

5

if you're going to operate a waste disposal facility you

have to do it in the way we prescribe?

MR. SCHIFF:

I think it can do that.

yeah.

basically it, the NRC controls the standards by which you

I mean, it has -- and it's doing that.

Of course,
I mean

regulate radioactive materials.
QUESTION:

11

May I just ask a small question about

12

your argument directed at the take title provision?

13

at the specific shall take title to the waste, and it also

says shall be obligated to take possession of the waste

Is it just the title part or do you make the same

MR. SCHIFF:

combination.
QUESTION:

So it wouldn't really matter to you

if you didn't have to take title?
MR. SCHIFF:

I think the worst part of it is

really being responsible, being liable for anything that

But isn't there a way you can avoid

that liability?

14

MR. SCHIFF:

Well, I suppose, sure, but, I mean,

15

but that's again telling us we have to do something, then

16

we would have to do the regulatory scheme that Justice

17

Scalia was asking about.

18

We have been conscripted, commandeered to do the Federal

19

Government's regulation here.

20

QUESTION:

So it's one way or the other.

Taking title you say is the sanction

21

for not regulating as the Government has told you to

regulate?

23

MR. SCHIFF:

That's right, but it's a form of

regulating because once we have it eventually we would

have to do something with it.

This is the second case this .term, Arkansas
against Oklahoma being the first, concerning Federal
legislation addressed to problems arising from the
transmission of pollutants across state lines.

In itself

the waste disposal problem Congress faced pitted states
against states in a manner only Congress could resolve.
The three states that had sites could not discriminate
against wastes originating out-of-state, the other states
lacked incentive to develop additional facilities, and the
three sited states were in the unfortunate position of
either having to accept waste from throughout the country
or shutting down their disposal facilities and depriving
the generators within their states of disposal facilities.
There was also a broader national concern
implicated, and that is that the problem of waste disposal
must be solved if the people of this Nation are to
continue to enjoy the important benefits of the
technologies' that generate those wastes.

There are

millions of residential, commercial, industrial, and
institutional customers who get their energy needs from
nuclear power plants licensed under Federal statute.
There are - QUESTION:

Couldn't it have allowed those

MR. WALLACE:

We believe Congress did solve the

problem under the Commerce Clause.

It could have taken

10

that route, but the studies done by the National

11

Governors' Association and others who were expert in the

12

field indicated that 50 separate disposal sites, one in

13

each of the states, would have been very detrimental.

14

would have lost economies of scale that were important to

the maintenance of these technologies.

QUESTION:

That had 47 votes going in, I'm sure.

Isn't it true, Mr. Wallace, or is it,

that this statute is a step further than the Congress has

ever gone in that it is telling a state that it must enact

21

a certain rule?

22

MR. WALLACE:

proposed that Congress solve this problem by retaining

QUESTION:

3

No, but it says the state shall take

title.

4

MR. WALLACE:

That is only if the state doesn't

5

exercise any of the other options available to it, some of

6

which involve minimal state undertaking, such as

7

contracting with an existing disposal site in one of the

8

compacts, or authorizing a private contractor to develop a

9

site within the state.
QUESTION:

10
11

But can we begin by saying that there

is no direct precedent for an enactment of this kind?
MR. WALLACE:

12

I think that is true.

This is a

13

novel approach to a problem where Congress, pursuant to a

14

unanimous request from a state organization representing

15

the governors of all 50 states, was dividing up the

16

responsibility for handling nuclear waste disposal, where

17

Congress, the Federal agencies would undertake the high-

18

level waste responsibilities and most of the

19

responsibility for low-level waste generated by Federal

20

generators, and the states would retain the policy-making

21

authority with respect to the locally sensitive issue of

selecting sites for disposal of the low-level nuclear

waste.

QUESTION:

Generically it's the same kind of

statute, isn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

The take title provision, which we

don't believe is even ripe for decision today in the

10

setting of this case, it may never apply to New York, it

11

can't take effect until 1996, is only one option down the

12

road if New York doesn't undertake any of the other

13

options that are available here.

14

face of things because all of the other disincentives

15

would fall on the generators, and there was some fear that

16

this might impair the availability of the technologies

17

that are so important to the country and that an

18

additional disincentive would be useful to insure that the

19

states would do something on behalf of the generators

And Congress was relying primarily upon the

state to undertake the responsibilities, and this was

11

added as a final possibility.

12

Exactly what kind of sanction or penalty it is

is really subject to much doubt, which is another reason

14

why ripeness principles should be followed here.

15

far from clear what, if any, actual enforceable

1

public controversy.

There's much that is speculative and

2

in our view premature about the complaint concerning the

3

take title provision that New York is asking this Court to

4

use as a vehicle for undoing this entire statutory scheme,

5

even though it has had the benefit of the extension of

6

time for disposing of its waste in the sited states and

7

the payments made under this scheme for a period of many

8

years now.

9

And I might point out that most of the amici who

10

are supporting New York with respect to this issue that is

11

prematurely presented agree with us on the severability

12

question.

13

severability, the answer to that seems quite clear to us

14

for two reasons.

15

in terms repeals the 1980 act which would again be

16

resurrected if the^ 1985 act were not severable.

17

And if I may just say a word about

One is that the 1985 act displaces and

And it is quite apparent that Congress wanted to

18

make improvements by adding incentives and disincentives

19

to the 1980 act and would prefer the remainder of the 1985

20

act to the 1980 act, and in fact the 1985 act passed

21

unanimously in the House initially without the take title

22

provision which was then added in the Senate.

23

never a dissenting vote recorded in any of the enactments

24

of the entire 1985 act.

25

basically the same approach, it was signed into law by a

There was

And like the 1980 act which took

1

president who was himself a former governor.
So the circumstances that gave rise to this

2

3

enactment make it singularly implausible to think of it as

4

an attempt to aggrandize Federal power at the expense of

5

the states.

6

the conferral of power on the states, acting through the

7

regional compacts, to discriminate against interstate

8

commerce which they would not be allowed to do otherwise.

Indeed the most basic provision of the act is

And other than the take title provision which is

9
10

not ripe for review in our view, we believe that the

11

provisions of which New York complains are squarely within

12

the principle of South Dakota against Dole.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Wallace, if we disagree with you

14

on whether the take title provision is valid and if we

15

disagree with you and think it is indeed ripe for

16

decision, do you think it's severable from the balance of

17

the act?

18

MR. WALLACE:

We do indeed, for the reasons I

19

stated a few moments ago, that otherwise the 1980 act,

20

which Congress and the National Governors' Association all

21

had found unsatisfactory, would be resurrected to replace

22

the improvements that were enacted in the '85 act.

23

the House itself had unanimously passed the '85 act

24

without the take title provision.

25

doubt about what the proper resolution of that is if

And

So there seems little

1

Congress of course could amend either, but there's no

2

reason to think it would prefer to start with the '80 act

3

rather than the remainder of the '85 act.

4

But we think that the constitutional power of

5

Congress was adequate to the task in the manner Congress

6

went about this, that the commerce power, as augmented by

7

the necessary and proper clause, allowed Congress here to

8

enact this measured series of incentives and disincentives

9

to redress the inequities that had occurred among the

10

states and to provide assurance not only that those

11

inequities would not reoccur as they had after the 1980

12

enactment, but that the serious threat that they posed to

13

important national concerns would not be threatened again

14

because of failure to provide sufficient incentives in

15

honoring the states' request that they be allowed to

16

exercise the regulatory authority here.

17

We think it would be singularly inappropriate to

18

adopt in judicial hindsight some kind of a least

19

restrictive alternative approach to adjudging Federal

20

legislation of this kind.

21

QUESTION:

I think what you're saying, Mr.

Wallace, is that we really don't know whether this deal
would have been put together without this provision, and

thing to do is to find the whole statute invalid.

seems to contradict an early point you made, though.

Mr. Collins, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE RESPONDENTS
MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to begin by framing this case from the
point of view of the three sovereign states I represent
and then, because there were several questions about the
implications of overruling Garcia, I'd like to address the
point that even if this Court, that this case does not
hinge on a broad interpretation of Garcia.
Like New York, the sovereign States of
Washington, South Carolina, and Nevada have a strong
interest in state sovereignty and in the Tenth Amendment,
but this case is unlike any of the other Tenth Amendment
cases that have come before this Court.

One of the

obvious differences is this does not pit Federal power

Washington intervened in this case to support this action.

And when you have looked at the amicus briefs you have

seen that --

QUESTION:

Isn't what you mean, Mr. Collins,

6

that as a matter of arguments before this Court the states

7

are not all on one side, not that the statute doesn't pit

8

Federal power against state power?

9

MR. COLLINS:

Well, indeed, Your Honor.

But my

10

point is that I think if you look at National League of

11

Cities, Garcia, Hodel, you would not find states here

12

advocating that the statute was valid.

13

opinion doesn't mean that it's valid, but it's an

14

indication that this is a different kind of case.

are arguing that the Federal Government has the right to

direct them to enact a law and direct them to take a

governmental action without conditioning it the way it's

often, the way it's usually done.

MR. COLLINS:

6

QUESTION!

7

MR. COLLINS:

Well, first, Justice --

I think that's very surprising.
Well, I don't think it's

8

surprising at all.

This case involves an inherent classic

9

kind of interstate conflict between the states.

Some

10

states, like New York, generate a lot of nuclear, low-

11

level nuclear waste.

12

York.

13

Nevada, have tried to deal with that problem.

14

sites in our states to take care of this waste.

15

result of the dormant Commerce Clause and this Court's

16

decision in Philadelphia v. New Jersey we have no option

17

but to take waste from all the other states that choose to

18

send it to us, or, or close down the site.

19

They don't want to store it in New

Other states, like Washington, South Carolina, and
We have
But as a

Now this conflict is exactly the thing that

20

separates this case from the other kinds of cases where,

21

as Justice Scalia said, all the states are losers.

22

this case states that try to be responsible in dealing

23

with their waste are losers and the other states can take

24

advantage of them.

any way to draw the line that you would have us draw on

behalf of those three states.

3

State of Washington or South Carolina or Nevada would be

in here arguing that Congress would have the right to

shift off part of the national debt or shift off all

medical costs by congressional feat to the states, or any

other of the potential schemes that this would open up.

can't believe you'd be here making that argument.

MR. COLLINS:

No.

I can't believe that the

Indeed we would not.

And

we're not -QUESTION:

12

Well then how do you justify it here,

13

because it's a principle we have to deal with, not some

14

individual scheme?
MR. COLLINS:

15

That's right.

And I think that

16

this law meets the kind of principles that, the narrow

17

kinds of exceptions where the Federal Government can make

18

a statement to the states and involve them in a Federal-

19

state cooperative program.

20

emphasize is that even, this case does not hinge on a

21

broad reading of your decision in Garcia.

22

even if we analyze this in light of the dissenting

23

opinions in Garcia that this particular enactment would be

24

valid.

25

And the point I want to

I think that

And let me do that.
There are basically two dissenting opinions in

Garcia.

One was authored by Justice Powell, and Justice

2

Powell focused on the fourth National League of Cities

3

test to look to see whether the Federal interest is

4

demonstrably greater and state compliance is essential.

5

Now I submit in this case the Federal interest is

6

demonstrably great, simply because nuclear, the nuclear

7

waste area is something that the Federal Government has

8

been involved in, and it's a problem that must be solved.

about whether handguns are a problem or whether they

should be regulated.

QUESTION:

13

But no one here is saying that we

Well, and I suppose everyone would

14

agree that we need to solve the problem of medical care of

15

the indigent and we need to solve crime and we need to

16

solve prison space, and so forth and so on.

17

MR. COLLINS:

But it's a unique concern of the

18

Federal Government, Justice O'Connor.

19

that I would say why there is a Federal interest is that

20

this case involves a central concern of the Commerce

21

Clause, and that was something that Justice Powell focused

22

on.

23

through the Commerce Clause power has the ability to have

24

a wide reach and deal with other kinds of things.

because of the dispute between the states.

acts to have a site, then other states are relieved of the

responsibility, and that inherent conflict, I think, means

that the, it is a central concern that the Federal

Government in those limited states can make a kind of

command to the states.

8

this waste.

When one state •

Also I think state compliance is

It needs to be dealt with.

QUESTION:

Isn't there a fundamental difference

10

between this case and Garcia in that when this statute

11

says each state shall be responsible for providing for the

12

disposal of waste, it doesn't limit it to waste generated

13

by the state itself.

14

therefore this statute cannot be complied with by the

15

state without the state using its sovereign powers.

16

Federal Government is directing the state how to exercise

17

its sovereign powers.

It means all waste in the state, and

18

MR. COLLINS:

19

responsibility, Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

The

It's directing the state to take

21

like, but it can't take responsibility for somebody else's

22

waste without exercising its sovereign powers.

MR. COLLINS:

That's what I'm saying.

QUESTION:

I'm saying it's worse than Garcia in

that respect, not better.
MR. COLLINS:

The states are not, are given

4

maximum amount of flexibility to decide how to do this.

5

There are nine compacts that have been formed.

6

have a wide option.

7

The states

The last point I'd like to make before I take my

8

seat is just to concur with counsel for the Government

9

that if the Court finds the so-called take title provision

10

invalid, that it is clearly severable from the remainder

11

of the act.

12

a presumption in favor of severability.

13

House unanimously, and in fact the act would operate just

14

fine without the so-called take title provision because

15

this act gives part of the power of, the Federal power to

16

the states so that the states actually have the ability

17

when acting within a compact to exclude waste that is

18

generated from outside the compact region.

19

There is no severability clause, but there is
It passed the

And that is why we would say that this does not,

In fact states

have a lot of autonomy.

must be responsible.

simply ignoring the problem.

The only thing that they are

So we would request that this Court affirm the

judgment below or, if the Court finds that the take title

provision is invalid, the Court should sever that

provision and sustain the remainder of the law which we

think is an excellent example of the partnership between

the Federal Government and the state government.
