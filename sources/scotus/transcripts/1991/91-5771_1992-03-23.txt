ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MATTHEW MARTIN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MARTIN:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Good morning.

12

The issue today before the Court

13

is whether the district judge has any authority to

14

consider a defendant's substantial assistance outside of

15

the Government's refusal to make a motion for downward

16

departure.

17

The court of appeals of the Fourth Circuit held

18

that because the statutory authority gives the prosecutor

19

sole discretion in deciding whether to file a motion for

20

downward departure for substantial assistance, that

21

neither the defendant nor the court may inquire into the

22

Government's reasons and motives, if the Government does

23

not make the motion.

24
25

The Government now concedes that there are
grounds for review by the court when a defendant makes a

threshold showing of un_-- unconstitutional activity on

2

the part of the prosecutor.

3

We urge the Court to reverse the decision of the
*

4

Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

5

issues before the Court today are what - - whether the

6

scope of judicial authority includes review of claims for

7

bad faith or arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor

8

in his decision-making process; and also, what

9

circumstance - - what the circumstances are surrounding the

10

The only uncontested

remand in this particular case.

11

In this case --

12

QUESTION:

Well, I think the Government agrees

13

that if a showing is made, it -- the judge can certainly

14

inquire into what the -- what the prosecution's reasons

15

were for not making a -- making a motion.

16

But I don't think the Government agrees that

17

showing was made here.

18

agrees there should be a remand', does it?

19

MR. MARTIN:

I don't think the Government

No, Your Honor, they don't.

What

20

happened in this case is the district court upheld that he

21

had no authority to entertain this inquiry, whatsoever.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, did you make any sort of a

proffer?
MR. MARTIN:

I did make a brief proffer at the

trial court - 4

QUESTION:

And would -- what did the proffer

consist of?
MR. MARTIN:

Basically, the proffer consisted of

a recitation of what Mr. Wade's assistance was up to that
point.
QUESTION:

Well, did it consist of any showings,

a prima facie showing that the Government was denying Mr.
Wade his constitutional rights?
MR. MARTIN:
Justice.

Not at that time, Mr. Chief

But the judge would not let me put on any

evidence - QUESTION:

Well, but putting on evidence is

different from a proffer.

I think a judge is entitled to

first say you make your proffer, and then I'll see whether
I'll let you put on evidence.
And if your proffer was insufficient, he was
entitled to say, I'm not going to hear you.
MR. MARTIN:

I believe that would be correct.

But what happened in this case was the reverse.

If you'd

look at the joint appendix, and you can see that what
Judge Tilley, the district court judge did, was deny my
request -- not once, actually, but twice -- before he
allowed me to make the proffer.
So actually, he had ruled on this before he said
you may state -- you may make a statement.

QUESTION:

1

Well,-but there can be good reasons

2

and bad reasons for denying a particular motion.

3

your proffer does not show that the reason must have been

4

bad, you're not in good shape; as opposed to whether your

5

proffer -- your proffer, if believed, would show that the

6

reason would have been bad.

7

MR. MARTIN:

And if

Well, the -- at the trial court,

8

the trial judge did not even

think he had the authority to

9

get to the point of making a

proffer where he could hear

10

any evidence.

He says:

QUESTION:

11

•

12

Well, I believe I'm going tp --

What page are you on?

MR. MARTIN:

On page 9 of the joint appendix,

13

the court says, and I quote:

Well, I believe I'm going to

14

let you make some law with that case.

15

believe - - I do not believe so.

16

have that authority.

17

feel that I am imposing this sentence contrary to law,

18

because I don't believe that I can depart upon your motion

19

for substantial assistance for a mandatory minimum.

Because I

And I hold that I do not

You may appeal that belief that I

He did not believe that he had any authority,

20
21

whatsoever, to entertain any kind of motion with regard to

22

this.

23

And, indeed, the Fourth Circuit affirmed him.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Martin, it is true that the

24

judge did allow you to state for the record, in the event

25

you desired to appeal, what the evidence would be.

You knew you were going to lose.

MR. MARTIN:

But you were given the

Well, it was a very strange

sentencing proceeding.

The parties in the case before us,

10

Your Honor, had raised a very similar type of request.

11

And the judge was very short.

12

going to sentence my man to the mandatory minimum, but I

13

didn't want to risk his ire.

I felt like the judge was

The - - I guess the point - -

15

QUESTION:

But you did risk his ire.

I mean,

16

you -- you -- you went on and stated for the record the

evidence.

18

single iota of that evidence has anything to do with a

19

constitutional violation.

And it's on the bottom of page 10.

MR. MARTIN:

QUESTION:

Well, I did -You just said this defendant provided

a lot of assistance from the Government, they should have

I did not, Your Honor.

Because --

Well, that's the end of the -- I mean

that's as far as we can go, isn't it?

QUESTION:

MR. MARTIN:

9

Well, did you try to proffer that?

Yeah.
Well, there -- there's

a -- you -- there's a point in here, where, on page

10 -- or I suppose on page 9 and 10 -- where I'm going

11

through this with the court.

12

it be appropriate for me to put on evidence?

anticipated being able to put the special agent on, so

14

that he could discuss the contact that the agent had with

15

the defendant and the inducements that were made to Mr.

16

Wade by the agents of the prosecutor, that is, the Drug

17

Enforcement Administration Agency.

And I asked the court, would

QUESTION:

I had

Well, are you saying that implicit in

20

your proffer is an attempt to show that the Government was

21

acting in bad faith?

22

MR. MARTIN:

Well, perhaps not in my proffer,

23

itself, Justice Kennedy, but in -- at the beginning of my

24

discussion with the judge, I say it is again a question of

25

that, as opposed to the prosecutorial function.

I was

trying to bring this up with him.
But he just simply refused to -- he actually

ruled very quickly and said - QUESTION:

4

Well, surely there are much more

5

direct ways of bringing it up with him than the language

6

you just quoted.

7
8

I would say that was oblique, at best.

MR. MARTIN:

I don't necessarily disagree with

that characterization, Mr. Chief Justice.

But -- I

suppose the only way I can say that is that this is a
10

court that I'm extremely familiar with; that I practice in

11

every month; prosecutors and I are, you know, very close.

12

And so in my mind, at the time, it was a touchy

13

subject.

I wanted -- and we still do - - want to have a

14

chance to make the showing that the Government now says we

15

can make.

actually not trying to get off of it.

20

What Mr. Wade would like is an opportunity to

make the showing that the Government now says he has to

22

make.

Please remember that --

MR. MARTIN:

QUESTION:

4
5

Well, the -I mean, I think you want to make a

different case for us.
MR. MARTIN:

Justice Souter, the Fourth Circuit

6

held that the district court has no authority to

7

entertain - -

8

QUESTION:

All right, and we're now at the point

where it is conceded that there is some authority.

And

10

the question before us is whether your proffer entitles

11

you to some kind of relief, either given the authority

12

that has been conceded, or given a broader authority if we

13

should hold that.

14

And isn't the sort of immediate question before

15

us, if you concede that the proper standard is that the

16

Court can look behind the refusal to move, if the refusal

17

amounts to a constitutional violation, then isn't the

18

question before us whether you have -- have proffered a

1

basis to look behind it?

20

and they haven't moved to reduce, isn't that the exact

21

question in front of us?

22

MR. MARTIN:

If all you say is, we cooperated

I don't believe so.

I believe the

23

question before the Court is did the district court have

24

any authority - - if the parties now agree that the

25

district court did have the authority, I think the

question then is, isn't it appropriate to send the case

2

back to the district court and say, district court

And so far as I know, the only thing that you

But you were made -- you were

proffered, in effect, was that your client had

11

plea agreement detailing what his consequences would be,

12

and the Government has simply refused to move for a

13

downward -- move for a reduction.

In point of fact, I don't think you have

suggested to us that you really have anything more to

A minute ago you said you weren't claiming bad

So isn't it the case -- given the fact that you

18
19

were allowed to make your proffer -- isn't it the case

20

that the only issue we can decide is whether a cooperation

21

and a refusal are sufficient to get you to an evidentiary

22

hearing?

23

MR. MARTIN:

I don't believe so.

Because

24

what -- what is before the Court is the decision of the

25

court of appeals, which really doesn't address this issue.

That you did have a plea

that?
MR. MARTIN:

Your Honor, the only thing I can do

3

to explain that to you is to tell you that I felt very

pressured by the judge to move on; he was giving me clear

5

signals that he - - what sentence he was going to impose,

6

that he was going to impose the minimum; we had already

been -- I don't really want to go too far out of the

record - - but we had - QUESTION:

Right, and we shouldn't.

I think I

understand your position.

11

Let me just ask a final question.

12

If we decide the case on the record before us,

13

isn't the only issue before us whether cooperation,

14

combined with no Government motion to reduce, gets you to

15

an evidentiary hearing?

16

MR. MARTIN:

17

QUESTION:

18

I do not -Isn't that the only issue we could

decide on this record?

1

MR. MARTIN:

I do not believe so.

20

I believe that the issue before the Court is

21

whether if -- if authority exists, whether the case should

22

be remanded for the defendant to make - - to have an

23

opportunity to make a threshold showing.

suggesting that the case, on remand, could proceed

25

directly to some discovery-laden adversarial proceeding.

1

QUESTION:

Well, let me rephrase, if I

2

may -- and perhaps Justice Souter won't regard it as a

3

rephrasing.

4

Isn't the question whether the proffer you made

5

is - - would have been sufficient if evidence to back it up

6

were produced to obtain relief?

7

MR. MARTIN:

I suppose that it could be looked

8

at that way.

But I think the flip side of the coin is, is

9

that at the time, this judge was aware of precedent in the

10

Fourth Circuit which was against me, frankly.

The -- with

11

that in mind, I believe that really the question is,

12

should the case be remanded?

13

QUESTION:

Well, you've answered -- you've said

14

remand, remand, remand.

15

questions, and all you -- you don't come up, it seems to

16

me, with any justification.

should be a remand.

admit to you that, and I concede that there are problems

with the proffer that I made on Mr. Wade's behalf at the

3

time.

4

7

However, and I stress to you again, this
occurred after the judge had already ruled; after he had
. already basically cut me off.
QUESTION:

I think we've probably spent enough

8

time on this particular aspect, but why don't you go on to

9

the rest of your argument, Mr. --

10

MR. MARTIN:

Another question that remains is

11

whether the scope of review in these circumstances would

12

include the concepts of bad faith or arbitrariness, those

13

motivations on the part of the prosecutor.

14

does not agree with us with regard to that.

15
16
17

The Government

I suggest to the Court that that is an
appropriate scope of review as well, in these cases.
QUESTION:

Do you take the position that

18

arbitrariness is claimed, if you simply allege that there

19

has been cooperation and a refusal on the part of the

20

Government to move for a downward reduction?

21

MR. MARTIN:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. MARTIN:

No, Your Honor, we do not.
Okay, what more do you have?
I think what you need is a

24

motivation on the part of the prosecutor that is not

25

related to a governmental interest.

QUESTION:

1

2

Okay.

Well, let's be practical for a

minute.
Are you claiming that you can raise the issue

3
4

simply by a naked allegation that the Government

5

was -- was, in fact, or the prosecutor was, in fact,

6

motivated by -- by some objective unrelated to a proper

7

governmental function?
MR. MARTIN:

8

9

No, Your Honor, I believe that

cross threshold showing that the Government agrees now

10

must be made, that there must be evidence which satisfies

11

the court that these conditions exist, by way of a

12

supposed proffer, or by way of affidavits.

13

I'm not suggesting that a defendant can walk

14

into the courtroom and call the prosecutor to the witness

15

stand, and then begin essentially cross-examining him.

16
17

QUESTION:

You say these conditions exist.

I'm

not sure what you mean by these conditions.

18

I mean, arbitrariness is -- is -- is -- a word

19

we use to describe any basis for reversing an agency.

20

the agency hasn't acted reasonably -- is that what you

21

mean?

22

to ask for a reduction is unreasonable, is that enough?

establish that the assistance that the defendant rendered

QUESTION:

5

Well, suppose the Government is just

There's been substantial cooperation but the

7

Government just is wrong because it characterizes it as

insubstantial.

So long as the Government's in good faith,

in your view there's still -- there's no hearing?
I thought your position was that you're always

No, our view of this section is that

No, we do not concede that, Justice

22

O'Connor.

We do not believe that either the statute,

there's some sort of discrepancy in the sentences that men

QUESTION:

2

What is the theory that permits the

court to inquire if there's a constitutional violation,

4

that the processes of the court cannot be used to reach an

5

unconstitutional result?
MR. LONG:

6

I think that's it.

We derived this

7

from this Court's prior decisions on prosecutorial

8

discretion cases, which have never found a violation, but

9

have always suggested that the court could inquire.
We think it is part of the inherent supervisory

10

MR. LONG:

Well, because it's established under

17

the Bank of Nova Scotia and other decisions that the court

18

cannot exercise its supervisory power to negate statutes.

19

And we think it's clear -- indeed, we think the petitioner

20

concedes -- that Congress intended, in 3553(e), and the

21

Sentencing Commission intended in 5K1.1, to commit to the

MR. LONG:

Well, I think the distinction, and we

draw it from this Court's decision in cases such as

16

Webster against Doe, is that if the Congress means to

preclude review of constitutional questions, unless they

say so extremely clearly -- there's a kind of a plain

statement requirement -- and, of course, we also draw it

from cases closer to this situation in prosecutorial

If defendants knew exactly how much cooperation
they had to supply in order to come within some standards,

10

they would probably do the minimum, and not give all the

11

cooperation that they could.

12

We think it's clear that defendants would seek

13

extensive discovery -- not just about their own case, but

14

about other cases -- because they'd want to make

15

comparisons; they would want the prosecutor to explain,

16

probably take the stand - - if they could get him to do

17

it -- and explain the basis for the decision.

18

And really, that's precisely what the petitioner

19

is asking for in this case.

we think is a basic difference between the substantial

It doesn't necessarily reflect their culpability.

it is a tool that's available to the prosecutor, like the

public interest, and to encourage cooperation, while still

Is it practicable for him to insist on a plea agreement at
