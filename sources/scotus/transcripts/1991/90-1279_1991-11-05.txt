CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 90-1279, Myra Jo Collins v. the City of Harker

5

Heights, Texas.
Mr. Rosen.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SANFORD JAY ROSEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROSEN:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on a pleading stance, as it

12

involves the affirmance by the Fifth Circuit of a Rule

13

12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.

14

Circuit is in direct conflict with one of the Eight

15

Circuit in the Ruge case.

16

That ruling of the Fifth

In the complaint, which must be taken -- the

17

allegations of which are taken as true, plaintiff alleges

18

that the defendant city employed her decedent,

19

caused his death in violation of due process by sending

20

him into the sewer where he succumbed, knowing that there

21

was a high risk of death as a result of a prior incident

22

that occurred several months before he went into the sewer

23

and indeed before he was employed and pursuant to a policy

24.

or custom of deliberate indifference to his safety needs

25

and the risks to his life, as evidenced by its failure to
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

that it

1

comply even with the mandates of the Texas Hazard

2

Communication Act and thereby, failed to train, warn,

3

properly equip or supervise him in relation to the risks.

4

The allegations are read as claiming a violation

5

directly of the due process clause of the Fourteenth

6

Amendment and also a violation of due process as a result

7

of violations of the substantive mandates of the Texas

8

Hazard Communication Act.

9

QUESTION:

And what is the violation of the

10

Constitution claim, Mr. Rosen?

11

MR. ROSEN:

12

13

The taking of his life in essence,

Your Honor, in disregard of his bodily security.
QUESTION:

14

of the Constitution?

15

MR. ROSEN:

That is protected by what provision

The due process clause of the

16

Fourteenth Amendment, which specifically states that life

17

shall not be taken without due process of law.

18

QUESTION:

If they had given him some sort of a

19

hearing before they sent him into this place, would that

20

have solved the due process problem?

21

MR. ROSEN:

The only hearing that would have

22

solved the due process problem would have been training,

23

warning, and supervision, not a hearing, shall you go down

24

in and succumb.

25

If one wanted to analyze the case on procedural

think not.

case.

5

QUESTION:

(Inaudible) case in this Court, in

your support?
MR. ROSEN:

6

7

This is basically a substantive due process

In terms of his life having been

lost?

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. ROSEN:

The closest -The closest, excuse me, would be

10

Harris and City of Canton, even though it involved not a

11

public employee, of course, but it did involve the

12

deliberate indifference of a municipality.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ROSEN:

And a failure to train?
And a failure to train.

Or, as I

15

believe Justice O'Connor described it as an inaction in

16

the fact of a known and patent - -

17
18

QUESTION:

That was where the woman was in the

custody of the policy and slumped down?

19

MR. ROSEN:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
But there she was in custody.

Here

21

it's a little hard to say that the employee is in the

22

custody of the city.

23

tells him where to go and what to do, but he's not in a

24

kind of involuntary custody that the petitioner was in

25

Harris.

To be sure, he has a supervisor who

MR. ROSEN:

1

That is why, Your Honor, in all of

2

the briefing we have taken the position that not only do

3

you have to prove your section 1 83 claim against the

4

municipality by meeting the standard of deliberate

5

indifference, but in order to establish the violation of

6

the due process right itself, you have to meet a standard

7

of deliberate indifference.

8

For example, Your Honor, in the Daniels,
Davidson, and Whitley cases, the Court specifically

10

reserved the question of the appropriate standard for

11

harms to individuals who were either pre-trial detainees

12

or people whose liberty was unconstrained with respect to

13

due process violations of the type that might have been

14

involved in those cases.

15
16

QUESTION: Is there a case in this Court dealing
with police using undue force in making an arrest?

17
18
1
20

MR. ROSEN:

There have been a number of such

cases.
QUESTION:

Yes.

But is there one that involves

liability because of lack of training?

21

MR. ROSEN:

22

QUESTION:

Not to my recollection.
I suppose you would say that the

23

deliberate indifference standard involving failure to

24

train would apply in a situation like that?

25

the - - what about in the Fourth Amendment case where they
6

What about in

1

-- where they've -- and the claim is that the municipality

2

failed to train officers about what the rules were about

3

entering a house?

4

MR. ROSEN:

That raises an interesting point

5

that goes in a way to the heart of the duality that's

6

here.

7

Fourth Amendment proposition under Graham and Brower

8

because any excessive force case is so analyzed.

9

not analyzed as a - -

As to the officer, the case would be analyzed as a

It is

10

QUESTION:

Training case --

11

MR. ROSEN:

12

As to the municipality, since -- or to the

--a due process proposition.

13

entity that employs the officer, you would still under

14

Canton and City of Harris -- excuse me, City of Canton and

15

Harris have to demonstrate that the municipality's pattern

16

-- customer policy was deliberately indifferent and caused

17

the officer to engage in the unreasonable act under the

18

Fourth Amendment.

19

QUESTION:

The deliberate indifference you are

20

talking about here basically comes from Monell's

21

requirement that it be a policy of the municipality rather

22

than an act of the individual, doesn't it?

23

MR. ROSEN:

That is correct, and that gets to - -

24

past the section 1983 initial pleading obligation, which

25

as this Court has repeatedly said, involves only two
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

elements:

that a Federal right has been invaded under the

2

color of State law.

3

Monell, in order to get that person as a defendant, you

4

have to also demonstrate deliberate indifference.

So far as the municipality under

5

The Ninth -- the Fifth Circuit's error in this

6

case was that it didn't recognize that so far as section

7

1983 was concerned we had pled all the elements, do you

8

have to get down right away to a determination of whether

9

there has been a Federal right that's been invaded.

10

And we submit that under the teachings of this

11

Court's decisions, where there is a claim of substantive

12

due process invasion of one's life interest or bodily

13

security interest, that deliberate indifference is the

14

standard that defines the constitutional right.

15

QUESTION:

Then you are really borrowing from

16

the Monell line of cases a concept that had nothing to do

17

with the Constitution and importing it into constitutional

18

law, aren't you?

19

MR. ROSEN:

I think not, Your Honor, because I

20

can borrow that from the Estelle line of cases under the

21

Eighth Amendment.

22

QUESTION:

23

Amendment violation.

24

MR. ROSEN:

25

But you are not claiming an Eighth

No, we are not.

Arguably we could

stand here and say that demonstrating that the
8

1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

municipality had caused this violation through deliberate

2

indifference is sufficient and all we need to do then is

3

demonstrate some level of recklessness or gross

4

negligence, as was left free, at least for argument, in

5

Daniels, Davidson, and Whitley.

6

QUESTION:

7

DeShaney v. Winnebago County?

8

MR. ROSEN:

9

How does your case differ from

The way that differs is we analyzed

DeShaney as essentially a State action causation case.

In

10

DeShaney, Mr. Chief Justice, your analysis was that there

11

essentially was an intervening private cause for which the

12

State was not responsible, and there was no State action.

13

In other words, the chain of causation had been

14

broken.

15

No such thing exists in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, the Fifth Circuit seemed to say

16

that there be - - there could have been liability if there

17

had been an abuse of governmental power.

18
19

MR. ROSEN:

as an element of a section 1983 claim.
QUESTION:

20
21

And I know not where they get that

Has it ever -- has that -- has that

concept been given some content in the Fifth Circuit?

22

MR. ROSEN:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, the content is -What would have been -- what would

24

have been an abuse of governmental power in a case like

25

this?

What could it have been?

MR. ROSEN:

1

As I read the Fifth Circuit law,

2

which involves four -- five cases in which they have used

.3

that phrase, I don't think it is possible to make that

4

assertion within the context of an employment relationship

5

for an injury that occurs on the job.
QUESTION:

6

7

Well, having employees is an exercise

of governmental power I suppose, isn't it?

8

MR. ROSEN:

9

QUESTION:

We believe so, Your Honor.
And -- did you argue to them that it

10

is an abuse of governmental power if you don't train your

11

employees properly?
MR. ROSEN:

12

We argued, by the time we got to the

13

Fifth Circuit, as its opinion reflects, that the analysis

14

presented by the Eighth Circuit in the Ruge decision is

15

the correct analysis, which tracks just what Your Honor

16

said, that it's not the employment and the injury in

17

employment, but by putting somebody

18

position of high risk known to the municipality and so far

19

as these pleadings are concerned, we may infer, not known

20

to decedent, that is the violation of constitutional

21

right.

22

untrained in a

We stand on the Eighth Circuit analysis.
QUESTION:

Counsel, do you know -- section 1983

23

aside, do you know of any case involving the due process

24

clause and involving substantive due process, deprivation

25

of life, liberty, or property, where the deprivation was
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

not intentional, where the State through negligence or

2

gross negligence or whatever you like has caused

3

somebody's death and it's been held to be a violation of

4

the due process clause?

5

MR. ROSEN:

I would think, if you are speaking

6

of the State as opposed to an individual flesh-and-blood

7

State actor, I know of no such case, so far as --

8

9
10
11

QUESTION:

You think the test for a

constitutional violation under 1983 is different from the
test under the due process clause, simpliciter, as we say?
MR. ROSEN:

No, Your Honor.

I think it is the

12

same, and that is why we have gone for the standard in

13

this context of deliberate indifference, which under

14

Wilson is an intense standard.

15

QUESTION:

Yes, but as the Chief Justice pointed

16

out, that's the standard for attributing -- for

17

attributing the violation to the municipality, but in all

18

of the cases I am aware of anyway, the violation, at least

19

when you are talking about a due process, substantive due

20

process violation, is an intentional violation on the part

21

of somebody, not that the person died or was deprived of

22

something accidentally or even with gross negligence.

23

least somebody did it intentionally.

24
25

Then if you want to attribute it to the city,
you have to have gross indifference, but you need some

At

1

intentional action, don't you, for a due process

2

violation?

3

MR. ROSEN:

What we - - our position is that the

4

city's failure to train is the intentional action, just as

5

in LaFleur the - -

6

QUESTION:

I don't mean any intentional action,

7

I mean, the deprivation has to be intentional.

8

to intentionally have deprived the person of life,

9

liberty, or property, not by mere accident.

10

MR. ROSEN:

You have

But intent has two components.

11

There's the standard that's articulated in Wilson, albeit

12

in an Eighth Amendment context, in which Your Honor

13

described it, and as I analyze it, as what is known as

14

objective intent.

15

in Whitley and Albers which one would analyze as

16

subjective intent.

17

And then there is a standard, I think

We suggest that you do not need to prove the

18

objective intent to make out the due process violation,

19

and we have adequately pled the objective intent standard.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ROSEN:

Well -We think that perhaps in LaFleur,

22

for example, the pregnancy leave case, surely someone

23

performed an intentional act of saying you must go on

24

leave, but there was no intent to violate a right as such.

25

QUESTION:

That is not a substantive due process

case.
MR. ROSEN:

2

Well, it was analyzed, as I recall,

3

an arbitrary and capriciousness standard basis as opposed

4

to equal protection bases.

5

Honor, that at those levels, the equal protection analysis

6

is really a subset of a fundamental substantive due

7

process - -

QUESTION:

And we would submit, Your

I suppose then when the Army is

grossly negligent or something or a general is grossly

10

negligent in the conduct of a battle and some troops are

11

killed -- or deliberately indifferent, that's a violation

12

of the due process clause.

13
14
15

MR. ROSEN:

No, I think not.

It is contextual,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it be a violation of the

16

due process clause, these people would have been deprived

17

of their lives, and there would have been, you know,

18

deliberate indifference.

19
20
21

22

23

MR. ROSEN:

First -- well, that's not gross

negligence.
QUESTION:
indifference.

All right.

Let's say deliberate

That is a violation of --

MR. ROSEN:

That's an intent -- that's an

24

intent, as I read the cases, albeit in the Eighth

25

Amendment context.

That equates to intent.

Now, fallback

1

QUESTION:

2

3

Do you have any due process case that

says that?

4

MR. ROSEN:

5

QUESTION:

That uses deliberate indifference?
Right, for purposes of deciding

6

whether there has been a violation of the due process

7

clause, not for purpose of attributing it to the city.
MR. ROSEN:

8

9

It has been reserved, Your Honor.

The closest is the Whitley and Albers case in which the

10

subjective intent standard was applied, and the issue was

11

reserved as to people who were either pre-trial detainees

12

or people whose liberty was not constrained.

13

We submit that it is contextual in the sense of

14

the government need, the interest of the individual, and

15

where the acts are taking place.

16

QUESTION:

Under your analysis, you really don't

17

need the Federal Tort Claims Act to sue a Veterans

18

Hospital or to sue anybody else that works for the

19

government.

20

can show the deliberate indifference on the part of a

21

government employee, a surgeon or a postman that ran over

22

you?

23

You have a Bivens action, I presume, if you

MR. ROSEN:

I think not, Your Honor, under the

24

- - as I understand the Federal Tort Claims Act, which is

25

not before us, it basically precludes Bivens actions for
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

actions that are taken properly within the scope of

2

employment.

3

So the issue never gets to the courts, except on

4

the basis of a proper certification of whether the action

5

was taken within the scope of employment.

6

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't you have a Bivens

7

claim against someone who, under your theory, denied --

8

took your life away by deliberate indifference to your

9

safety on the part of the government?

10

MR. ROSEN: If you are talking about the Federal

11

Government, I understand that the Federal Tort Claims Act

12

and this Court's decisions take care of that.

13

talking about the State - -

If you are

14

QUESTION:

Well, take the Federal Government.

15

MR. ROSEN:

I understand that if there is a

16

certification that the action occurred within the course

17

of - - within the course of employment - -

18

QUESTION:

Supposing there had never been a

19

Federal Tort Claims Act passed, and the government just

20

says we have sovereign immunity from all of this.

21

MR. ROSEN:

Well, then the government is out,

22

but the individual actor under a Bivens action sued in his

23

or her personal capacity presumably would have to stand in

24

answer if a claim of deliberate indifference is made.

25

Yes, Your Honor.

And that would be a constitutional

violation?

3

MR. ROSEN:

4

course, is extremely difficult.

5

QUESTION:

If proven, and proving it, of

So that if I can show that a postman

MR. ROSEN:

Yes.
That -- that's a one tough one, Your

Honor.

negligence cases, which is one of the reasons why you've

have identified that negligence can never be the standard

16

for making out a due process violation involving injury to

17

person, property or life.

18

I know those hypotheticals are used in the

And we do believe, Your Honor, that it is a

19

question of identifying the appropriate standard that is

20

the task of this Court.

21

QUESTION:

Well, even if we were to acknowledge

22

that, you know our problem, obviously, a reluctance to

23

have an undifferentiated, broad-based substantive due

24

process right under 1983.

25

Parratt line of cases to such claims, and to say that they

Why shouldn't we just apply the

1

apply in the substantive violation area as well, when the

2

claim is undifferentiated, not based on the First or

3

Fourth Amendments or a specific constitutional violation?

4

Because it seems to me that would strike very

5

close to the root of the real harm.

6

to recover from the State, it seems to me that that is an

7

aggravated factor that might be taken into account in

8

determining whether there's 1983 -- liability at all?
MR. ROSEN:

9

If there's no ability

Your Honor, that would involve a

10

modification of what appears to be the rule in Zinermon v.

11

Burch.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ROSEN:

Yes, it would.
But obviously the Court is free to

14

make that modification.

15

should be a differentiation between substantive due

16

process rights against arbitrary or capricious government

action and First Amendment rights or equal protection

18

rights or other - -

19
20

QUESTION:

MR. ROSEN:

QUESTION:

24

Because of the obvious problem of

your turning 1983 into a general tort statute.

21

23

I don't know however why there

I think not -Which was probably not the intent of

the Congress.
MR. ROSEN:

I agree.

That wasn't the intent of

Congress, but it was the intent of Congress to reenact the
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

Constitution in terms of its liberty components through

2

the enactment of section 1983, and it was the intent of

3

Congress that section 1983 should be a broad remedial

4

statute.

5

It is appropriate to differentiate with respect

6

to the standards within one bundle of rights, substantive

7

as opposed to procedural, as to what standard will be

8

applied --

9
10
11

QUESTION:

But if there is an adequate remedy,

then that necessity is gone.
MR. ROSEN:

Well, as I say, it would require a

12

12

MR. ROSEN:

As pled and presented below, that is

essentially correct except with respect, at some levels,

to the claim under the Texas Hazard Communication Act, but

15

it has not been briefed very fully to you.

There you are claiming that statute

gave you some kind of a liberty interest of which you

18

could not be deprived without a prior hearing, is that it?

19

MR. ROSEN:

That would be one thing.

If one had

20

to fall back under that statute, we believe that the

21

respondent has demonstrated the inadequacy of the remedy

22

available with respect to these claims, by demonstrating,

for example, that under the Texas Tort Claims Act, if a

MR. POWE:

2

Well, there are -- I think within

3

that there's still some ambiguity because at various times

4

this Court has held that substantive due process can give

5

meaning to an idea as if it were functionally equivalent

to a specific guarantee of the Constitution.

7

At one time, liberty of contract under Lochner

was such a right.

The right of privacy under Griswold

11

this Court would be faced with three 1983 cases today, one

14

The point of this is that it's not sewers.

I - - in petitioner's brief, as I

understood the brief, and I did not hear this in the oral

argument, petitioner was trying to state that the Texas

Hazard Communication Act created some form of
