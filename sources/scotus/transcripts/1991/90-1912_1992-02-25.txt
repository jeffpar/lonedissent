ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLYLE W. HALL, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HALL:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The principal question presented by this case is

12

whether California's welcome stranger method violates the

13

equal protection clause by taxing newly purchased property

14

at many times higher rates than property owned by long­

15

time owners, without any possibility of seasonably

16

attaining rough equality in tax treatment.

17

Just 3 years ago in the Allegheny decision, this

18

Court unanimously concluded that there was no rational

1

basis to justify welcome stranger assessment practices.

20

The fact that California's welcome stranger system is

21

formally embodied in the State law is not a valid

22

distinction.

23

respondents say it must make a different.

We say it can't make a difference; the

1

Allegheny case, did we not?
MR. HALL:

2

Yes, you did.

And for argument's

3

sake let's assume that there might be a difference, and

4

look to see whether there should be a difference, based on

5

whether there are any practical differences in operation

6

or in effects or in justifications.

7

In terms of the practical operations, the two

8

welcome stranger systems function in an identical fashion.

9

Basically, they both set up two groups of taxpayers.

10

There is a favored group of taxpayers who are going to pay

11

very low effective rates of tax, based on low assessed

12

values.

13

who are the new buyers, who are going to be coming in to

14

the system with base -- with assessments based on high

15

current market values, and therefore will be paying higher

16

taxes and higher effective tax rates.

17
18

Then there's the disfavored group of taxpayers

QUESTION:
groups, are they?

Of course, these are not static
I mean --

19

MR. HALL:

No, that's exactly.

20

QUESTION:

-- today you may be a continuing

21

resident, tomorrow decide to move.

22

citizens are identified permanently in one or the other

23

category.

24
25

MR. HALL:

So it's not as though

No, that is true, that citizens are

not identified permanently.

And indeed, in terms of their

1

being static groups, one of the interesting and curious

2

things about the welcome stranger phenomenon is that it

3

links these two groups together by having the change of

4

ownership provision give higher tax assessments to the new

5

groups and the new buyers, the new owners, and having the

6

flat cap of 2 percent on the assessments for the old

7

buyers.

8
9

So the two groups are intimately linked
together, and over time as the tax rates change, as the

10

assessments go up for the new buyers and as new money

11

comes into the system, the effective tax rates for the

12

long-time group is going to get lower and lower and lower.

13

So it's a dynamic system that over time inevitably results

14

in a skewing of the system so that the effective tax rates

15

of the low tax group get lower and lower and lower.

16

And the result of that is that you get these

17

enormous disparities that you found in the Allegheny case,

18

where you had 35 to 1 disparities that the Court

19

characterized as gross disparities.

20

court of appeal took judicial notice of the fact that our

21

common gross disparities are of that same magnitude.

22

indeed, the California Supreme Court just last month,

23

although it didn't take this case up for review, did

24

characterize those kinds of disparities and the way they

25

come about as a wild-card system.

And in California our

Well, Mr. Hall, in West Virginia, I

suppose the State law required that properties be put on

the rolls at current value.
MR. HALL:

No, Your Honor, that's -- the State

10

law was a current market value system.

12

coordinated with a welcome stranger system, and that this

Virginia said you will place properties on at market

MR. HALL:

No, Your Honor.

There is -- that is

12

the problem with the California tax system.

13

And you say that that doesn't meet

the rational basis test.
MR. HALL:

I say that's not a valid description

of the California welcome stranger system.

The California

10

welcome stranger system does not simply lower taxes for

11

long-time owners.

12

the long-time owners with the tax benefits -- I mean with

13

the tax burdens on the new buyers, so that there is this

14

correlation that is irrational.

15

QUESTION:

It intimately links the tax breaks to

And it's that --

But why is it irrational?

Why isn't

16

it perfectly rational for California to say that whenever

17

Proposition 13 was passed we had a lot of people who

18

bought homes at much below their present assessed value.

19

They'd anticipated a certain amount of real property tax,

20

now they are paying three or four times as much real

21

property tax.

22
23

MR. HALL:

Yes, it's irrational for the same

reason that the Court stated in Allegheny.

2

In Allegheny we had quite a different

situation, Mr. Hall.

rational justification for the West Virginia system was,

5

since what the county assessor was doing was squarely

contrary to State law.
MR. HALL:

It was almost impossible to say what

10

The West -- and the West Virginia court said it

with State law.
QUESTION:

11

Well, but I think if you'll read the

12

opinion from this Court, the thrust of it was that there

13

was no justification.
MR. HALL:

14

That's exactly right.

The Court

15

could not find a justification in the equality principles

that were established by the current market value system

that the assessor claimed to meet, and also -QUESTION:

either set of principles.

There was no rational relationship to either

And

group, condemns as the most patently inequitable tax

QUESTION:

Would it be rational for a State to

conclude, given the pattern of our economy in the last few

generations, that there is a constant inflation, and that

this means that the longer you've held your home, the more

No, that would be precisely --

Would that be rational?

You say it is irrational?

MR. HALL:

No, it is rational.

QUESTION:

It is rational.

6

MR. HALL:

Yes.

But the welcome stranger system

7

takes that premise, which is merely a description of the

8

fact - - I mean, it is true that the longer you own your
house in an inflationary economy, the lower your assessed

10

value will be as compared to the market value.

But that's

11

not the issue.

12

links the property taxes so that one group is down here

13

with low assessed values and low effective tax rates, and

14

another group in the same house, it could be next door, is

So - -

I suppose there's no chance of having

Proposition 13 repealed by the electorate, is there?
MR. HALL:

6

Unfortunately, the court of appeal in

our case commented on exactly the problem of the very,

very high vested interest that you get from all the people

who are benefitting from the system on the benefit side,

10

with these huge tax breaks that they're getting that are

11

directly pulled from the people who are being burdened.

MR. HALL:

It largely depends --

It largely depends on how you define

Isn't that some advantage to the people of California?
MR. HALL:

She knows that next year it's

She knows that, but she also knows

10

that in the meantime she is paying enormous subsidies to

people in an unfair way, because she is in a little modest

QUESTION:

-- in unrealized value, and isn't it

21

rational for the State to say that as a general premise of

the taxing scheme, people with a large percentage of

That's rational, isn't it?

live in Beverly Hills in the mansions in the pictures in

the brief are in the highest appreciation areas in Los

6

7

appreciation, they are paying the lowest effective tax

rates.
Now there is nothing you can say that indicates

that the people living in mansions in Beverly Hills who

11

have enormous wealth in those homes and presumably what it

took to get there and keeping pace with inflation, et

people are worse able to pay taxes than the people who are

in the Venice bungalow and stretched to pay a $300,000

I assume there is some kind of middle ground between the

Maybe we're trying to find a standard taxpayer here, at

1

Isn't it a pretty good bet that if I

isn't it a pretty good bet that I probably have a capacity

to raise more cash on an annual basis, and that I probably

have an income sufficient to support a higher cash

there's a correlation there?

MR. HALL:

I think it's rational to assume that

the State is wrong in assuming that the older home owner

No, no, because they also have the

benefit of inflation probably, which -- the welcome

stranger system doesn't take into account, et cetera.

20

Again, the irrationality of the system can be

seen, and here's another very good example of it in the

fact that two-thirds of the property value that's

Mr. Hall, in cases like Lehnhausen v.

MR. HALL:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

The fact you can poke holes and make

other arguments that the legislature could have done this

here, doesn't mean it's irrational under that sense, so

is serving.

13

I take it your answer to all these questions is

14

that no reasonable person could ever have concluded that

this was a sensible taxing scheme?

Absolutely.

The court's rational

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LEE:

9

The equal protection analysis of this

10

case is just as simple as it is compelling.

There is no

11

justified classification; there is no fundamental right.

12

So the question is not whether California could have done

13

it done it some other better way, or whether the way that

14

it chose is even good policy.

15

whether California's acquisition value assessment system

16

furthers some legitimate State purpose, and clearly it

17

does, for reasons that have already been identified by

18

Justice O'Connor and other members of the Court.

The only question is

This was a very serious problem with which

19
20

California was dealing.

21

in their balance sheet, but they didn't have the

22

corresponding money to pay the corresponding increases in

23

taxes.

24

25

problem, but none was really effective because none

1

attacked the problem at its core, which was a combination

2

of unusually escalating real estate prices in the State of

3

California, in the 1 60's and 1 70's, coupled with a

4

current value assessment property tax scheme.

5

California voters adopted a four-part response,

6

and the part that's at issue here is the one that simply

7

says, for the first time in history, so far as I know --

8

and California is the only State that's done it -- in
response to a correspondingly serious problem we are just

10

going to unhitch our properties tax assessment from

11

current value, and instead we are going to tie it,

12

basically, to an acquisition value basis.

13

Key to the analysis of this case is the fact

14

that the California courts -- Mr. Hall, to my

15

astonishment, purports to have found what the true basis

16

of this Proposition 13 really was, and he said that the

17

Jarvis and Gan groups have themselves identified, that

18

they have just found a way that they could tie this, that

1

they could shift their -- tax to someone else.

20

not the purpose.

the Gan Jarvis briefs to which he cites, and they don't

22

say that at all.

course, that basically got at the problem.

is provide for certainty in the amount of taxes that a

person was going to have to pay by tying the amount of the

taxes, basically, to the amount that that person was

willing to pay at the time that he or she bought the

8

property.

The first one is, to prevent the taxation of

with was that the property owners had no control.

That is correct.

But Justice Stevens,

if the new test is does it place a different burden on

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that's a correct

statement of the law?

MR. LEE:

Of course it is, but it has nothing to

11

from the premise as my opponents do, that any scheme that

doesn't matter whether that comes about by constitutional

If you start

What the case really comes down to - - what the
case really comes down to, is whether California is

in history that any taxing jurisdiction has unhitched

And how does Proposition 13 meet

that?
MR. LEE:

3

In this way.

That the seasonable

4

equality in the case of California is accomplished against

5

an entirely different background, that is the background

6

of the different policy that California has adopted than

7

was the case in West Virginia.

8

course, in Allegheny Pittsburgh was made in the context of

9

a value-based system.

And that statement, of

10

Let's assume, Justice O'Connor -- yes?

11

QUESTION:

Well,

(inaudible) you say that the

12

California treatment is a seasonable attainment of

13

equality?

14

MR. LEE:

Well, I really think that that word

15

seasonable means -- just recognizes that even with a

16

current value system, it's going to take some time to make

17

some adjustments.

18

say that we've got big problems in this country if it is

19

true that the only constitutionally acceptable scheme is

20

current value, because even in California and other

21

places, you never have a complete - - you never have a

complete one for one because of the cycles that are

QUESTION:

*

Mr. Lee, before you get off of

5

Allegheny Pittsburgh, suppose the West Virginia

6

legislature in Allegheny Pittsburgh had passed a statute

7

that said, yes, we know we have a current market value

8

system, but elderly people who shouldn't be assessed on

9

their current value, and we think this is a competing

10

State policy and, although we are using a current market

11

value system, the elderly should not be taxed on their

12

unrealized income.

13

effect.

14

And they passed a statute to that

Now, would we strike that statute down because

15

it does not have a rational basis, given the

16

constitutional prescription of the West Virginia

17

constitution?

18

MR. LEE:

19

QUESTION:

I would surely hope not, Justice.
Okay, now what if the tax assessor

makes the same conclusion and just doesn't move against

elderly people?

What if the tax assessor does what the tax

to modify it by some unappreciated income theory.

going to charge those people who haven't gotten the money

out of their land yet.
MR. LEE:

4

It feels most comfortable, most

5

logical to me, in light of what this Court has said about

6

rational basis and particularly in tax cases and the

7

difficulties that you've just mentioned, to draw that line

8

between those instances where the official policy makers

of the State, the legislature or the constitution makers,

10

have set forth the policy.

I'm not

I think the real - - the real - - one of the real

12

vices in the Webster County case was that you just had a

13

runaway assessor, who in the face of what the State had

14

done, that said, I'm just not going to follow.
QUESTION:

15

And the effect of the runaway

16

assessor was that, taking Justice Scalia's hypothesis,

that in West Virginia, as it were, some young taxpayers,

there's a violation of equal protection if the State

2

official does not enforce the State law as written?
MR. LEE:

3

Well, I would prefer to look at it,

4

Justice Kennedy, through a slightly different prism.

5

That's the approach that my opponent takes.

6

that what you ask is, has there been a legitimate policy

7

identified by the official policy makers of the State?

My view is

And then secondly, does the particular scheme at

issue pursue and is it reasonably contemplated to achieve
10

that objective.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. -- no, but the hypothetical put

12

to you by Justice Scalia and I think echoed by Justice

13

Souter and the one I'm interested in, is what happens if

14

the official refuses to enforce the State policy as

15

written?

16

Is that a violation of equal protection?
MR. LEE:

I think that falls closer to the

17

Allegheny Pittsburgh side of the line.

18

because you then don't --an individual can certainly

1

violate the equal protection clause and is not doing it

20

pursuant to an official State policy, so that you don't

21

have the vent between means and end.

QUESTION:

And the reason is

And what is the best authority you

have for that proposition, other than Allegheny?

far more vast expansion of equal protection jurisprudence

Isn't that an adequate explanation of

It may well be.

The people who really

the people whom I'm facing right now.

MR. LEE:

That's right.

That's right.

But I

will simply say this.

14

explanations for Allegheny Pittsburgh, you come back to

15

this basis proposition, that what California did here, and

16

that's what we're looking at, was to take hold of a very

17

serious problem, to deal with it in a responsible way, and

what they did squarely responds to the problem that they

were facing and under the rational basis test,

(Laughter.)

MR. LEE:

5

It's just another policy judgment that

6

has been made by the State of California.

7

fully with Justice Scalia, the last thing in the world

8

that you want to do is start taking a red pencil and mark

9

- - and start going through - QUESTION:

10

And I agree

Well, but Mr. Lee, you've argued that

11

this is an acquisition-based value tax.

And that does not

12

at all fit with able to give commercial property to your

13

children.

14

which is unlimited, and it seems to me that you have to

15

respond to that because the supposition here, the charge,

16

is that there's a favored group and you attacked that in

17

the very opening part of your submission to us.

It does not all fit with a downward adjustment

And it seems to me that the hodge-podge created

18
19

by these exemptions strongly undercuts the acquisition

20

value theory that you advance for this tax.

It is inconsistent.

There are two

They would certainly be severable.

But I submit

1

In the case of the family passing on of the

2

favorable basis, that's simply an assumption that is no

3

stranger to tax laws in other contexts, in an attempt to

4

treat the family the same and treat family properties the

5

same, and preserve it across generations.

6

in our inheritance taxes as well.

7

QUESTION:

It's reflected

But it hardly fits the acquisition

8

value theory, because at the time of the transfer within

9

the family --

10

MR. LEE:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

That is correct.
-- there should be some kind of

valuation capable of being placed on it.
MR. LEE:

Of course there could, just like there

14

could at the time that my grandfather died and my father

15

got a step up in basis in his income tax property.

16

But there is nothing in the equal protection

17

clause or the rational basis test that says that you can't

18

adopt a basic acquisition value test and then have -- and

19

then make it a modified acquisition value test.

20

Let's assume that what California had done was

21

to simply repeal its property tax -- it doesn't exist any

22

more -- and then enact in its place, if you will -- maybe

23

they call it an acquisition value tax, or an acquisition

24

price tax, or a sales tax on real property.

25

permit people to pay it off over a period of time.

And then,

1

I assume there would be no problem with that.

2

And yet, when they accomplish something that is very

3

similar to that, certainly that should not raise

4

constitutional questions.

5

With regard to - -

QUESTION:

It really isn't similar, because the

7

real estate property tax pays for a group of services that

8

the owner of the property gets -- police protection, fire

9

protection, schools, as so forth.

10

And you've got neighbors who get the same

11

benefits out of the State -- identical kinds of property,

12

and the same number of children going to school and the

13

like, and one of them pays a very large tax, and the other

14

pays a very small tax for the same State benefits.

this.

Sure.
Something counter-intuitive about

It's not a sales tax.
MR. LEE:

Well, I think what's really counter­

intuitive is just the assumption -- just the assumption

that that's the way we've done it over the years.

is similar in this respect.

In related contexts, it can be tied, for example, to

13

MR. HALL:

Thank you, Your Honor.

14

With respect to Justice Kennedy's question about

15

exceptions to the acquisition value premise of this

1975 base year, which is approximately 44 percent of the

18

property in the State, is not operating according to the

acquisition value premise.

20

increased up to 1975, irrespective of what the acquisition

21

date or acquisition value was.

22

It's all -- it's had its basis

And this is not the first

Indeed, there

And finally, I don't agree that -- with Mr.
Lee's characterization of what this case boils down to.

10

think really what it comes down to is whether this Court

11

really wants to get into the whole business of looking at

12

the way State administers -- administrators have

13

administered State law, and whether they've reconciled

14

State law policies with their own policies, and whether

15

they've strayed too far from official State policies in

16

their implementation of the law.

17

I

And that's the precise implication of what the

18

respondents' attempted distinguishing of the Allegheny

19

cases is, is that this Court would get into the business

20

of measuring the compliance of State law officials --

21

State executive and local officials -- with how far

22

they've strayed from some official State policy, as

23

they've tried to adopt their own policies on a local basis

or executive basis to temper those official policies.
