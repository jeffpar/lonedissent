ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. MAHONEY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held

11
12

that the respondent's fear that he would be kidnapped by

13

guerrillas to serve in their military in Guatemala

14

rendered him a refugee eligible for asylum in the United

15

States.

16

and to uphold the board's order of deportation for two

17

reasons that I'd like to briefly outline.

18

We request this Court to reverse that decision

First, the court of appeals did not apply the

19

correct legal definition of the term, persecution on

20

account of political opinion.

21

language of that term - - has been a part of the United

22

States immigration laws for decades, and more than 20

23

years ago it was interpreted by the board to require a

24

showing that the persecutor's motive would be to inflict

25

injury for the specific purpose of punishing him for

That term -- the precise

adherence to political views that are offensive, to single

2

him out - -

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. MAHONEY:

Was this argument made below?
Your Honor, yes, the argument was

5

made.

6

the proceeding before the immigration judge the counsel

7

for the Service specifically said that the respondent had

8

failed to satisfy his burden of showing that he had been

9

singled out based upon his political opinions.

10

The board -- in the closing argument of the -- in

Similarly, in the court of appeals there was a

11

reference to that argument, and I would submit that it

12

wasn't more fully briefed simply because between the time

13

of the decision of the board and the time of the court of

14

appeals there had been some intervening Ninth Circuit

15

decisions which made it pretty clear that they had

16

rejected the definition of persecution on account of

17

political opinion that the board had historically applied.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

You're arguing this almost by

implication, aren't you?
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, no, it was raised.

21

The board has very express language in its opinion that

22

there was no basis to infer.

23

could hardly be inferred that the guerrillas approached

24

the respondent because they found his political beliefs to

25

be offensive.

In fact, they say that it

rj

It very definitely -- and it referenced two

2

other decisions of the board, the matter of Vigil and also

3

matter of Maldonado-Cruz which had been reversed by the

4

Ninth Circuit thereafter, which relied precisely on these

5

grounds -- the definition of persecution on account of

6

political opinion -- and there --

7

QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, isn't it possible under

8

this statute, that the applicant can demonstrate that he

9

had a well-founded fear of persecution, even though the

10

actual motive of the persecutor may be something he can't

11

prove?

12

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, there is no question

13

that the standard of proof is a well-founded fear, and

14

yes, it is theoretically possible that a guerrilla could

15

in fact have a motive that did not constitute an intent to

16

persecute, but if the objective evidence would support a

17

reasonable inference that that was the motive, then

18

certainly an alien could prevail.

19

But what is important here is that I believe

20

that the issue of the standard of proof and the legal

21

definition have been collapsed, and that it's important to

22

establish first what is the legal definition to determine

23

whether or not the board's decision was correct under that

24

definition, since the board and not the Court of Appeals

25

for the Ninth Circuit has to draw the

1

inference

inferences from the facts.
In this case, Your Honor, I don't think it's

2

3

necessary to -- to really articulate precisely what the

4

standard of proof is, because there's really no reasonable

5

inference on this record that the purpose of the

6

guerrillas in seeking out the respondent was to punish him

7

for political beliefs.

8

of conduct are present on this record.

9

QUESTION:

None of the indicia of that kind

Is it just the initial -- is it just

10

the initial approach of the guerrillas that's controlling?

11

I had thought that the respondent's position was that he

12

would be in jeopardy because of his having rejected their

13

initial approach and what they might do to him in the

14

future - -

15

MS. MAHONEY:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And it seems to me that this is

17

the -- his situation.

18

once he's turned them down.

19

MS. MAHONEY:

It may change quite drastically

I'd like to clarify what this

20

record shows about that issue, Your Honor.

The Ninth

21

Circuit specifically found that the respondent had a

22

well-founded fear that he would be kidnapped and forced to

23

serve.

24

that his mere refusal for having served would result in

25

his ultimate execution.

They did not find that he had a well-founded fear

1

He testified at the hearing that he had a fear

2

that he would be forced to serve, and he also suggested he

3

had a fear he might be killed, but there was no objective

4

evidence of that whatsoever, and on appeal the Ninth

5

Circuit, I believe, found that he had a well-founded fear

6

that he might be kidnapped because there was some

7

objective evidence to support that.

w

8
9

indicated that forcible recruitment does occur in

10

Guatemala, but that same report that the Ninth Circuit

11

accepts in part found that that practice did not support a

12

claim that -- that he would be singled out on the basis of

13

his political opinion.

14
4

The State Department had submitted a report that

QUESTION:

In other words --

Well, if he had a well-founded fear

15

that he would be killed, I take it that would be

16

sufficient?

17

MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor, I would not say

18

that it would be sufficient.

19

to determine whether or not the purpose that the

20

guerrillas would have for killing him in response to the

21

refusal was to punish him for his political beliefs, or

22

whether it still was just yet another measure to try to

23

enlist more soldiers.

24
25

It would then be necessary

I would say, though, that that -- the question
of that inference becomes somewhat different than the one

1

that's presented on this record, where the only question

2

is what - - is it reasonable to infer that the purpose of

3

kidnapping him for refusal to serve is a - - an intent to

4

punish him for his political beliefs, or is it simply to

5

compel compliance with the request that they made for him

6

to join their military?

7

record, as the Ninth Circuit has found it, presents.

8

9

That's the situation that this

I'd like to turn again to the definition.
The - - there is a suggestion by the parties that there is

10

no requirement that motive be proven, or that it even is

11

an element of the definition, that instead it is simply

12

sufficient if the respondent had a political opinion that

13

caused him to engage in the activity which now subjects

14

him to harm, and that that is persecution on account of

15

political opinion.

16

As I referenced, that has never been the

17

definition -- the articulated definition of persecution on

18

account of political opinion throughout the history of our

19

immigration laws and, in particular, this Court, in

20

Cardoza-Fonseca and in Stevie, found that a controlling

21

principle of interpretation of the refugee definition and

22

the withholding of deportation was its conclusion that

23

Congress intended to incorporate the preexisting practice

24

prior to 1980 with respect to the terms that were used in

25

that definition.

1

One of those terms was persecution on account of

2

political opinion, and in 1973 the board, in a case called

3

Matter of Dunar, specifically used this articulation.

4

board said Congress sought generally to shield aliens from

5

the actions of their own home governments in singling them

6

out for punitive treatment, not because of their

7

individual misconduct or demerits, but solely because they

8

are members of dissident or unpopular minority groups.

9

The

Congress sought to establish a preference for a

10

very special category of people, not just anyone who might

11

be subject to injury in war-torn countries, but those who

12

were more in the nature of martyrs, those who had either

13

political beliefs or religious beliefs that were deeply

14

held and that were not tolerated by the societies that

15

they lived in.

16

QUESTION:

Would you clarify something for me?

17

The statute doesn't speak directly to it, but is there any

18

limitation on who the persecutor must be?

19

be an act of the sovereign or can a nongovernmental group

20

meet the definition?

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, the definition does

not say, but again, the pre --

upon when it used these terms was that it could be a group

2

that was not under the control of the government, in other

3

words, that was out of control, that the government

4

couldn't in any way sort of keep from inflicting severe

5

harms on its population.

6

QUESTION:

Could it be a Mafia group in Sicily?

7

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, Your Honor, it could be a

8

Mafia group in Sicily if the government is simply

9

incapable of keeping their conduct under control.

I think

10

there has to be a substantial showing, and usually, Your

11

Honor, I think it comes about in the circumstances where

12

there is some suggestion also that the government may not

even want to control - -

is interested in political beliefs.
MS. MAHONEY:

Well, I'm not sure what the Mafia

does, but what -- what I would reference there is that if,

for instance, they single out a different nationality for

adverse treatment that's -- that sort of thing, but -- but

yes, Your Honor, it absolutely has to be for one of the

purposes that Congress prohibited.

Congress did not say that persecution that is inflicted or

the current government?
MS. MAHONEY:

11

No -- well, Your Honor, the

12

immigration judge found that he had a fear that he would

13

be harmed if he went against the current government.

14

other words, there is a difference between a -QUESTION:

MS. MAHONEY:

It was not, Your Honor, because he

was very explicit in his testimony that the reason he did

not want to go against the government was not because he

believed in their policies or thought what they were doing

25

was right - 11

testimony is clear that he did not express sympathy with

the policies of his own government, he simply expressed

fear.

that go on, but that's the single thing that motivates

2

their choice.

3

How would that be different from this?

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

4

that is the type of political opinion that Congress was

5

referring to.

6

on account of political opinion, was directed at the

7

dissidents of totalitarian regimes who were silenced

8

through physical torture and imprisonment because they

9

dared to adhere to a different belief.
QUESTION:

11

The whole history of this term, persecution

Well, maybe they just wanted to avoid

the harm that was associated with that kind of activity.

12

MS. MAHONEY:

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. MAHONEY:

The political dissidents?

Yes.
Well, the political dissidents

15

generally did express their views, and that's what led to

16

their harm, and that's why Congress sought to protect

17

them.

18

case had a political opinion, it still does not support an

19

inference that that caused the guerrillas to single him

20

out for punishment.

21

what is the purpose - -

Even if we could say that the respondent in this

No, but you carry it one step

further.

intended to kill him for not joining up.

1

would make that argument, because the inference -- it

2

would depend on the facts of the record, and I think we'd

3

have to have the facts of record regarding the way in

4

which this was done.

5

But if, for instance, Your Honor, they killed

6

everyone who refused to join, even if the person made it

7

quite clear that they had been an active guerrilla - -

8

excuse me, an antiguerrilla person or a proguerrilla

9

person, in other words, with regard to what the person's

10

political viewpoints were, then the inference would still

11

be that they may well be simply trying to enforce a system

12

of deterrence in order to field soldiers and not to

13

specifically try to suppress that belief, and that's what

14

this section of the law --

15

QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, suppose we agree with

16

you that they applied the wrong standard, why shouldn't we

17

send the case back to have them apply the right standard?

18

Why should we try to decide it here?

19

MS. MAHONEY:

Well that -- that would certainly

20

be a possible outcome, Your Honor.

I would say that,

21

given the way that the Ninth Circuit in this and other

22

cases, though, has approached the question of forcible

23

recruitment, it is possible --a possible reading of the

24

opinion that even if it understood the correct standard,

25

that it would still nevertheless apply a legal presumption

that the guerrillas are motivated to punish for political

beliefs simply based upon their forcible recruitment, but

it certainly would be a possibility.

Yes, Your Honor, that

would be a proper disposition of the case.

Ms. Mahoney * let me make sure I

You're saying * with respect to the

10

subject matter, * that the, in this case that the

11

guerrillas have acted, that you believe that he takes the

12

position he did as a result of his political opinion, and

number two, he's got to prove that that was his political

14

opinion -- in other words, that they were correct about

15

that.

16

Am I right, * he's got two positions?
MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor.

There would

17

certainly be circumstances where a person who had no

18

political opinion at all or religious belief might well

19

have a well-founded fear that a persecutor would impute

20

that characteristic or belief to them.

Excuse me, and how is it the belief

in the mind of the persecutor that's determinative?

bases.

8

his state of mind has to be well-founded, but it could be

9

well-founded but erroneous, so that in fact the state of

10

Surely it's his state of mind that counts.

The

Now,

mind of the persecutor has nothing to do with it, does it?
MS. MAHONEY:

11

I'm sorry, Your Honor, he has to

have a well-founded fear about the persecutor's state of

mind.

In other words -QUESTION:

Yes, but the actual state of the

persecutor's mind is not determinative.

correct.

have a different state of mind, but if there is a

19

well-grounded, a reasonable fear that the persecutor's

state of mind is to punish for political opinion, that

21

would satisfy the act.

22

It's not -- in other words, the persecutor may

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, Your Honor, it could, if --

8

to the extent that there are people who the persecutor

9

might perceive to be within that group, they would be

10

protected, but I think in the ordinary case the objective

11

facts would usually just give rise to a well-founded fear

12

where the person is, in fact, within that group.

13

In fact, even the handbook that the U.N. High

14

Commissioner has done indicates that ordinarily, to

15

establish a claim for persecution on account of political

16

opinion, you'd have to show that you have that political

17

opinion and that political opinion has become -- has come

18

to the attention of the authorities, because usually it's

not going to be a well-founded fear that you're going to

have.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES ROBERTSON

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ROBERTSON:

12

13

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

14

5 years ago, in the Cardoza-Fonseca case, the

15

Immigration Service argued to this Court that it was

16

impossible to think about the well-founded fear standard

17

except in terms of more likely than not or more probable

18

than not.

19

held that the BIA had got it wrong in requiring asylum

20

applicants to prove a clear probability of persecution and

21

found that, indeed, the reasonable -- the well-founded

22

fear standard could be met by something less than

23

50 percent and perhaps even as little as 10 percent.

24
25

The Court didn't find it impossible.

MR. ROBERTSON:

11

Well, Your Honor, I think that
