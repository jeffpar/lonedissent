ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY B. DYK

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DYK:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involves an important question under

12

13

the bankruptcy code, namely whether liens that exceed the

14

value of property in bankruptcy are to be avoided under

15

section 506.

16

The present bankruptcy is a Chapter 7

17

bankruptcy, a liquidation bankruptcy in which the assets

18

of the debtor are generally sold to pay the claims of

19

creditors.

20

for the reorganization chapters, Chapters 11 and 13, which

21

deal with business and consumer reorganizations.

22

But the interpretation has significance also

Before the 1978 code, the status of secured

23

creditors in bankruptcy was somewhat unclear.

24

enough, Chapters 11 and 13 under the old code did not deal

25

with secured creditors and, even in a liquidation

bankruptcy, the effect of the bankruptcy on a lien was

2

unclear.

3

What Congress did was to enact section 506.

The

4

two sections of 506 that are relevant here today are

5

section 506(a) and section 506(d).

6

dispute between the parties as to the interpretation of

7

section 506(a).

8

that is, claims which are approved or otherwise come into

9

the bankruptcy proceeding and which are not disallowed by

11

There is really no

section 506(a) deals with allowed claims,

the bankruptcy court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dyk, did you say a moment ago

12

that under the act of 1898 and the Chandler Act, the

13

pre-code, that it was unclear what happened to liens?

17

case, which is cited in the briefs.

18

19

to ignore the bankruptcy proceedings entirely and the lien

20

would survive the bankruptcy.

21

It was unclear.

There were

Under Long v.

On the other hand, if the secured creditor went

22

into the bankruptcy proceeding and proved his claim to the

23

full amount, he would have waived his lien.

24

that was unclear was when under 57(h), for example, a

25

secured creditor went into bankruptcy and tried to prove

The situation

part of his claim; that is, the claim that exceeded the

2

value of the property.

3

none of the cases cited by the respondents or the United

4

States really deals with this situation -- unclear in that

5

situation what happened to the excess lien.

6

suggestion is that one of the purposes of section 506 was

7

to deal with that.

8

9

And I think it was unclear, and

Our

What 506(a) does is to divide this claim of a
secured creditor into two parts.

Part one is to the

10

extent that there is value in the property.

11

has an allowed secured claim in the bankruptcy proceeding

12

and that phrase is not only used in section 506 but in

13

various other sections of the code as well.

14

The creditor

Then section 506(a) also says to the extent that

15

the lien exceeds the value of the property, that the

16

creditor has an allowed unsecured claim.

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Dyk, does the secured

18

creditor still have the option of staying under the

19

bankruptcy?

20

MR. DYK:

Well, the answer is yes and no.

He

21

does have the option to stay out of the bankruptcy, but

22

there is a new provision in the '78 code, section 501(c),

23

which allows the trustee or the debtor to force the

24

secured creditor into bankruptcy and to - -

QUESTION:

So he doesn't have a choice.

Well, he has a choice, but it's not
If he stays out of the bankruptcy, the

trustee or the debtor can override that and bring him in.
QUESTION;

He doesn't have the same choice he

did under the pre-code bankruptcy?
MR. DYK:

No, and that was an important part of

the 1978 code, was to bring the secured creditors into the
bankruptcy to deal with their claims and to avoid these
wandering liens which might exist to the extent that the
lien exceeded the value of the property.
Now there is no question about this bifurcation
into the secured claim and the unsecured claim that's
accomplished by 506(a).

And I think there's no dispute

that 506(a) applies to property that will be abandoned or
has been abandoned just as it must apply to exempt
property.
QUESTION:

Could you tell us, Mr. Dyk, how does

Yes.

1

that then determines what the secured claim is

2

allowed -- the secured claim is and what the allowed

3

unsecured claim is.

4

QUESTION:

I suppose if the value has gone up

5

after the time of filing, then the trustee wouldn't

6

abandon it and we wouldn't have this problem.

7

MR. DYK:

Well, that's true, and there is a

8

contention here that allowing the debtor to keep any

9

increase in the case of abandoned property creates an

10

unfairness.

11

go up in value is that the debtor has continued to make

12

improvements on the property, planted crops in the case of

13

farmland, or something like that.

14

Now, one of the reasons that the property may

It is also possible, of course, that the market

15

has changed or that the bankruptcy court has misvalued the

16

property.

17

that kind of misvaluation doesn't happen very often.

18

But I think the opposing parties concede that

QUESTION:

If there is a misvaluation, supposing

19

the bankruptcy court says the property is worth $50,000,

20

it turns out it's later sold without any interim

21

improvements for $125,000.

22

MR. DYK:

Which value prevails?

Well, there is only a provision for

23

the setting of one value in the bankruptcy proceeding, and

24

the first value would prevail.

property which has no value to the estate, can move for

the lifting of the automatic stay.

3

the creditor to immediately foreclose on the property.

4
5

And that would allow

So there need not be any time difference between
the valuation and the actual sale.
There was another concern, and I think it's

6

7

reflected in the legislative history, and that is that if

8

the creditor could keep the lien to the excess value, he

9

could in essence coerce the debtor to give him more than

10

he might otherwise be entitled to.

11

property often has more value to the person who was using

12

it than to a third-party purchaser.
1 QUESTION:

13
14

MR. DYK:

Well, there's always a tension between

the debtor and the lienholder.

17
18

Well, that's always true, I take it,

in the relations between the debtor and the lienholder.

15
16

That is true because

QUESTION:

Of course, that's what the lienholder

bargained for.
MR. DYK:

19

The lienholder bargained for that, but

20

the idea of bankruptcy is to discharge some of these debts

21

as personal liabilities and to enable the parties to go

22

forward.

23

a junior lienholder, if the junior lien is worthless, this

24

provision allows the elimination of that junior lien so

25

that the debtor can negotiate with the senior creditor and

work out a plan for repayment over a period of time.

■N
2

If you allow the lien to wander around in

3

secured claims, you have all sorts of problems.

4

those problems is if the creditor in the bankruptcy has

5

secured a payment on this second half of the claim, the

6

allowed unsecured claim.

That means that under this

$100 and an unsecured claim for $50.
Well, what happens if the creditor in the

12

bankruptcy secures a distribution from the estate of an

13

additional $25 on the unsecured claim?

14

that the opposing parties make here, there isn't any

15

provision in the bankruptcy code to deal with that.

the creditor keep the $150 lien even though he's already

17

been paid part of his unsecured claim, or what happens?

QUESTION:

Is that true under the Attorney

General's interpretation?
MR. DYK:

Under the Attorney General's

interpretation, the only part of the lien -- the only time

that a lien would be avoided under 506(d) is if it were a

23

the respondents attempt to do is to divorce section 506(d)

2

from section 506(a).

3

even though 506(a) bifurcates the claims into secured

claims and unsecured claims, that the lien continues with

respect to the unsecured claim.

6

bankruptcy and can be enforced against any appreciation.

7

But that's not what 506(d) provided.

What they are saying essentially is

And it continues after

It said

8

that liens are void to the extent that they secure claims

9

which are not allowed secured claims, which includes two

10

categories.

11

it includes claims that are allowed unsecured claims.

12

It includes claims that are disallowed, and

It's almost inconceivable that Congress would

13

have wished to continue a lien with respect to a claim

14

that it had characterized as an allowed unsecured claim

15

and treat it in that respect throughout the bankruptcy

16

proceedings and in various other sections of the code.

17

Now the respondents' argument in this

18

case -- and the respondents and the United States

19

themselves do not approach this question the same way.

20

They want the same result but they cannot agree,

21

apparently, on the reasoning.

22

While the United States urges that section

23

506(d) is to be limited to a disallowance situation, the

24

respondents in this case try to reach the result that they

25

want by contending that the section 506(d) does not apply

Now the difficulty, of course, in this case is

What the respondents suggest is that the code

10

provision should be read to suggest that property that is

11

abandoned or will be abandoned or might be abandoned

12

somehow should not be covered by section 506(d).

13

problem with this interpretation is that they admit that

14

section 506(a) must apply to abandoned property.

15

can be no question about that because section 506(a), by

16

their own admission, is a critical predicate to the

17

redemption provision of section 722 of the code.

So if section 506(a) applies to abandoned

phrase in 506(a), property in which the estate has an

interest.

it into 506(d), and then say it has a different meaning in

2

The court of appeals said that 506(a)

didn't apply to abandoned property.

3

MR. DYK:

I understand the court of appeals said

4

that.

5

and for the reason that I suggested, it just can't be true

6

that 506(a) plays an important role in lien bifurcation

with respect to abandoned property.

parties admit that you have to do that in order for

Now there's various reliance by the respondents

12

and the United States on the legislative history.

13

seem to admit that our reading of this provision is the

14

simple meaning, by which I take it they mean the plain and

15

simple meaning.

16

But they say that the legislative history should

17

cause the court to read the provision differently.

20

believe that's a misreading of the pre-code history.

21

was unclear what happened to a lien in the circumstances

1

Then they try to read the legislative history of

2

section 506(d) separately from the legislative history of

3

section 506(a), just again to separate the two of them.

4

But the legislative history of section 506(a) makes clear

5

that Congress thought it was making a rather significant

6

change in this area.

7

of 506(a) mentions the concern about what happens to liens

8

in this bifurcation situation.

9

And indeed the legislative history

So what we suggest is that there is no clear

10

pre-code practice, point one; point two, that if you read

11

the legislative history in its entirety, that it is
1

12

clearly suggesting that there is a significant change

13

being wrought here.

14

I think if you look at the way 506(a) and (d)

15

are designed to work and the way they carry forward into

16

other sections of the bankruptcy code, you see that the

17

congressional design in this provision could not be

18

fulfilled if you were to adopt either of the readings of

19

the respondents or the United States in this case.

21

If there are no further questions, I would like
to reserve the remainder of my time.

MR. TARANTO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Everyone agrees that 506(d) reduces a lien to

4

the extent that the underlying claim has been disallowed

5

in the bankruptcy proceeding.

6

Our position is that that is all 506(d) does.

7

Petitioner says that the provision also serves a second,

8

completely different function; to deprive secured
creditors with wholly valid, still unpaid claims, of their

10

full State law rights in the property, and to transfer

11

some of the actual value of the property to the debtor,

12

allowing her to force a judicial valuation and redeem the

13

property at the court-determined price, and immediately

14

resell it for a profit, if the actual market value turns

15

out to be higher.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, would you state again

what everybody agrees 506(d) accomplishes?
MR. TARANTO:

That if the claim secured by the

1

lien has been partly or wholly disallowed, the lien is

20

reduced to reflect the disallowance of the claim.

21

22

23

QUESTION:

Well, that's the United States'

position, is that it?
MR. TARANTO:

It is also the Government's

position that -- that's right.

QUESTION:

Yes.
The fact that --

Under your other position, what does

506(d) do?

5

MR. TARANTO:

It reaches the identical result.

6

Our lead position in the brief is not so much an

7

affirmative theory of what 506(d) does apply to, as it is

8

a limiting theory of what it cannot sensibly apply to.

9

And as a matter of fact, the two theories amount to the

10

same thing.
Take the two types of cases - - Chapter 11 and 13

11
12

on the one hand, where the debtor is supposed to keep the

13

property for future income, and Chapter 7 on the other

14

hand. In Chapter 11 and 13, the only property that will

15

not be abandoned is property the debtor is to keep.

16

property is either going to be purchased under 722, the

2

redemption provision, in which case lien-stripping is

completely unnecessary, or will be sold as part of a

larger asset.
So as a consequence, once one has taken

abandoned property which plays no role in the

equation, the only thing left for 506(d) to do is to

MR. TARANTO:

Petitioner herself does not read

7

that language in isolation or literally.

Instead, she

8

says (d) must be interpreted by virtue of

(a).

9

that's wrong, essentially for three reasons.
One,

10

We think

(a) is not -- even if (a) was to be looked

11

to to interpret (d), the analysis can't stop there.

And

12

it seems to us clear that the other evidence of what

13

Congress intended, in terms of the substantive effect of

14

the statute, disproves that that's the right way to look

15

at it.
Second, there's no particular reason to think

16
17

that (d) must

1

bankruptcy, given the property between the debtor and the

2

secured creditor.

3

And there is also a practical reason why the

4

picture that petitioner relies on of (d) simply following

5

(a) can't be right.

6

really a two-part process; first bifurcate the claim, then

7

reduce the lien.

8

that picture is simply upside down.

9

Chapter 7 cases -- perhaps as many as 97 percent -- there

10

will be no bifurcation of claims under (a), because there

11

are no assets to distribute to unsecured creditors.

12

so there is no reason to go through a judicial valuation.

13

Yet, in all those cases where the collateral is

14

valued less than the lien, the debtor has an incentive to

15

come in, demand a judicial valuation with all the

16

litigation that entails, in the hope that by the time a

17

foreclosure takes place, that judicial valuation will turn

18

out to be wrong -- either because of appreciation of the

19

property, or because of judicial error.

20

Her theory says,

(a) and (d) are

But if she's right about what (d) does,
In virtually all

And

And so her picture of (d) simply being the

21

second part of a two-part process, which is, I think, the

22

linchpin of her effort to rely on 506(a) in interpreting

23

(d) , is, in fact, exactly wrong, if (d)

QUESTION:

25

MR. TARANTO:

--

What about the 3 percent?
Well, in the 3 percent, there will

either be -- there will be a bifurcation of the claim, and
(d) will then follow (a).

It's perfectly clear that you

can have both a bifurcation of the claim and then move on
to decide what is to be done with the lien.
Our position is that Congress quite clearly
continued the very clear pre-code rule that even if the
creditor comes in and under (a) or under the former
Bankruptcy Act, section 57(h) and splits its claim, the
lien clearly survives.
QUESTION:

That's Long against Bullard?

MR. TARANTO:

That's Long against Bullard, as

continued in the 1898 act by section 67(d), as explained
by this Court in Louisville State - - Joint State Bank
against Radford.

It is simply untrue that the law about

what happened to the in rem property rights of a creditor
was unclear in any of the circumstances that petitioner
has mentioned.
QUESTION:

Okay, the secured creditor comes in

and bifurcates the claim.

Part of it's secured and part

of it's unsecured.

No, but it has been fully allowed

MR. TARANTO:

It does in one sense.

think the phrase allowed secured claim means in (d) is the

claim that the secured creditor comes into court with.

20

After the creditor comes into court, if there is a

event under Chapter 7, then there -- that single allowed

1

to the claim as the creditor comes into court.

2

The reason, aside from the very clear evidence

3

that Congress meant to preserve pre-code law, which this

4

Court explained in three cases last term, is that if you

5

look at the effect on the debtor, this -- petitioner's

6

view gives the debtor exactly the same redemption right

that Congress gave only to certain debtors, for only

8

certain property in 722.

Petitioner doesn't

10

the lien is reduced to the value of the property, then

11

under every State's law, the debtor can exercise her State

12

law rights, pay-off that amount of the lien, and redeem

13

the property.

14

no need whatsoever, for 722.

15

that Congress placed on the redemptions that write in 722

16

would be simply overridden.

17

the petitioner claims to buy property at a judicially

18

determined value only to individual debtors, only for

19

consumer debts, and only for a narrow class of property

20

used for personal, household, or family use.

21

If 506(d) meant that, there would have been

506(d) would give that right to any

debtor - - corporate or individual, in any type of

24

commercial farmland.

25

Congress would give a very narrowly limited redemption

right to debtors in 722, only to have that completely

2

overridden in section 506(d).

3

QUESTION:

Is it a plausible hypothetical that a

4

creditor who is a lienholder would receive some

5

distribution as a - - from the general estate to the extent

6

that his claim is undersecured, and that that would happen

7

before there is a sale on the property and a foreclosure

8

of the lien?

9

MR. TARANTO:

Well we're -- first of all, we're

10

talking only about the 3 percent of cases out of half a

11

million bankruptcy cases.

12

13

QUESTION:

Well, within that 3 percent, is that

a plausible hypothetical?

14

MR. TARANTO:

15

QUESTION:

It is plausible.

And what would happen then?

He

16

receives $10,000 as a - - from the general estate, and he

17

has $100,000 left yet to be paid.

18

MR. TARANTO:

Under State law, the amount of the

19

lien follows the amount of the outstanding debt.

20

if he actually receives a payment through the bankruptcy

21

proceeding, the amount of the lien will be reduced

22

accordingly.

23

QUESTION:

And so

But this -- then this is still,

24

though, the same as Justice Stevens' question, to the

25

extent that the amount of the foreclosure brings in more

1

than the valuation of the property, he still takes that as

2

a secured creditor?

3

MR. TARANTO:

If he has already received a

4

payment through the bankruptcy proceeding, before the

5

foreclosure, then by the time of the foreclosure, the lien

6

will have been reduced by that amount - - not by the amount

7

of the unsecured claim, but by the perhaps 10 percent, 5

8

percent that he is being paid on that claim.
QUESTION:

9

But to the extent that he is still

10

undersecured, if the property does bring in more than

11

anticipated, he still picks up the balance?
MR. TARANTO:

12

Yes, because he is still, of

13

course, owed money, the collateral has, in fact, produced

14

money to repay his debt, what he bargained for was the

15

right to proceed against that collateral -- and it seems

16

to us, simply to be a windfall to the debtor to pay that

17

money to the debtor.

18

One illustration of that is that it's perfectly

19

clear that as to unsecured creditors and unencumbered

20

property, if the property were to appreciate during the

21

proceeding, the debtor is not given a preference over the

22

unsecured creditor.

23

First of all, there is no judicial valuation of

24

that property, so there's no opportunity for judicial

25

error.

And as far as appreciation is concerned, the

why we care.

2

proceedings not only avoid a debtor's personal liability

on its debts, but they also strip down the creditor's

been completed, you then have a marketplace determination

on it, I don't think that in all circumstances the secured

MR. MANN:

The statute is very unclear on this.

7

And the lower courts have not done well with this

8

particular point.

9

What the statute says is that the value shall be

10

determined in light of the purpose of the valuation, and

11

of the proposed disposition or use of such property, and

12

in conjunction with any ‘hearing on such disposition or

13

use, or on a plan affecting such creditor's interest.

14

It's clear that from that, and from the

15

legislative history, that in some circumstances there

16

should be multiple valuations.

MR. MANN:

it addressed the point in Radford -- which is the Court

2

generally surveyed bankruptcy law in the course of

3

invalidating a Federal statute that would accomplish the

4

result that petitioner seeks here.
It says, although each of our national

5
6

bankruptcy acts followed a major, or minor depression,

7

none had -- prior to the Frazier-Limkey

8

Amendment -- sought to compel the hold-over mortgage to

9

surrender to the bankrupt either the possession of the

10

mortgage property or the title, so long as any part of the

11

debt thereby secured, remained unpaid.
It says, but unless the mortgagee released his

12

13

security, in order to prove in bankruptcy for the full

14

amount of his debt -- which is one of the options --a

15

mortgage, even of exempt property, was not disturbed by

16

bankruptcy proceedings.

17

We think it's fairly clear from that, and from

18

the other cases, that nothing was going to happen in the

19

bankruptcy code that would alter the lien.

If petitioner is right, the Court in Radford
would have had to have made a mistake.

And considering

the weight that Congress placed on that analysis in

Radford in the legislative history, I think it would be a

11

relatively slender reed to suggest that the Radford Court

12

made a mistake and Congress relied on that mistake.

13

really don't think that you can have pre-code practice

much clearer than where the Supreme Court, itself, has

I just wanted to talk briefly about the
language.

As we see it, petitioner's argument hinges on

her assertion that the reference in section 506(d) to a

24

to refer to claims that are allowed but not secured.

2

petitioner is not willing to apply the provision literally

3

to all claims that are allowed but not secured, because

4

petitioner acknowledges that it would be - - implicitly in

The second problem with this reading, we think,

is that it leaves section 506(d) in an odd place in the
code.

point for just a minute.

It is not the

here is to resolve things, to deal with the secured

That is one purpose.

Because throughout the code, the effort

unsecured creditors, rather than to the secured creditor.
MR. DYK:

The suggestion of revaluation in the

course of the bankruptcy proceedings has been made by the

respondents.

We think the code doesn't provide for it.

is that what you need is certainty, to be able to figure

MR. DYK:

He can redeem it, often after the

MR. DYK:

Exactly.
No, but the Federal statute does not

control how long the debtor has to redeem.

7

QUESTION:

I know, but the price it will -- the

price he has to pay if he does redeem -- State law says

9

you can only redeem if you pay the full amount of the

indebtedness or the full amount of the original lien.
And if the lien is void as a matter of Federal

QUESTION:

It could

No, but if it does have one that says

7

you've got to pay the full amount of the lien, would that

State requirement survive under your theory, or not?

9

MR. DYK:

Well, I think it would survive, but

10

the full amount of the lien would be the lien that

11

remained after the bankruptcy proceeding, after this

12

process of bifurcation to secured and unsecured claims.

13

And that's what Congress intended to do.

And it

14

did it, I suggested earlier, in order to allow people to

15

go on with their lives and improve the property and do

16

things with it without having to worry about the recapture

17

of that accreted value, and without giving the creditor

18

the power at the foreclosure sale to say to the debtor, I

19

can bid $150 for this $100 piece of property.

20

the reason that power exists is that property is often
