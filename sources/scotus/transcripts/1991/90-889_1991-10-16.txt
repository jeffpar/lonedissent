ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY L. WAX

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. WAX:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and my it please

the Court:
This case concerns the application of the

11
12

Veteran's Reemployment Rights Act, which provides job

13

protection for members of the armed forces.

14

at issue which arise under Section 2024(d) of the act, is

15

whether the right to a leave of absence upon request to

16

perform active duty for training is conditioned on the

17

reasonableness of the request, or more specifically, on

18

the length of the leave requested.

The question

In 1987, petitioner, Mr. William King, who was

19
20

employed as head of security at respondent hospital,

21

requested a leave of absence to serve a 3-year tour of

22

full-time duty in the Alabama National Guard, as a member

23

of the Active Guard Reserve program, which provides

24

full-time support personnel for armed forces Reserve

25

units.

This request was denied by the hospital, which

filed this action for a declaratory judgment that they

2

were not required to grant the leave.

3

The courts below held that a request for leave

4

under Section 2024(d) is subject to a three-factor test of

5

reasonableness.

6

appeals focused on the length of a leave, and ruled that a

7

3-year leave was, per se, unreasonable.

8

they held, petitioner's request was unreasonable under the

9

circumstances, mainly because it was too long.

In applying that test, the court of

In any event,

The Government petitioned for certiorari to

10
11

resolve a circuit split on the issue of the interpretation

12

of Section 2024(d).

14

the statute.

request for leave be reasonable.

16

and no one contests in this case, that Section 2024(d)

17

covers petitioner's duty, and that if he enjoys any re­

18

employment rights at all, it is under this section.

National Guard duty.

25

Reemployment Rights provision states that full-time

1

National Guard duty under Section 502 is considered active

2

duty for training for purposes of 2024(d), the provision

3

at issue.

4

That provision states in pertinent part that an

5

employee shall, upon request, be granted a leave of

6

absence by such person's employer for the period required

7

to perform active duty for training.

8

that the employee shall be granted leave.

9

option for the employer to refuse.

The provision says
There is no

The only condition

10

placed on the grant of leave is that of a request, a

11

condition that was complied with here.
It's obvious, it's plain, that the word

12

13

"reasonable" no where appears in this section.

14

the factor of which the court made so much, that of the

15

duration of leave, the provision obviously places no fixed

16

limitation on how long an individual can be away from

their job.

19

be granted a leave for the period required to perform the

20

pertinent duty.

And as for

22

leave is just the period required to complete the training

program in which the reservist is enrolled.

requirement, it is assumed, will be fixed by statute or by

25

the military, whose job it is, after all, to determine

That

1

these sorts of requirements, and which is traditionally

2

accorded a great deal of deference in fixing training

3

requirements in the military.

4

Now in this case, Army regulations require 3

5

years of service in the AGR program.

6

petitioner retains his leave of absence status and his

7

right to return to his position for the full 3 years.

8
9

And it follows that

To summarize then, Section 2024(d) creates a
flexible, elastic protection that expands and contracts to

10

fit the requirements of a particular tour of training

11

duty.

of no cases in which someone has sought to return to his

job after re-enrolling in AGR four times.

PPT'

3
4

Your Honor, in the very rare cases in which people

5

re-enroll in AGR, is that the individuals choose to give

6

up their jobs and make a career of this program.

7

theoretical possibility, which we concede exists, because

8

it is possible to re-enroll in the AGR, although it's

9

totally at the discretion of the military --an individual

So the

10

can't do it on their own motion -- that theoretical

11

possibility hasn't really been a problem.

What generally happens as a practical matter,

QUESTION:

What if the employer has abolished

13

the position when the person wants to come back, he just

14

no longer has that?

15

MS. WAX:

Right.

The individual will not have

16

the right to come back to his job if the employer

17

abolishes the position.

And that flows from several

18

aspects of the statute.

Number one --

19

QUESTION:

I'd like you to tell me what that

20

flows from because I no more see that in the text of this

21

provision than I see any time limit, and I wonder why

' 22
23

you're willing to imply the one but not imply the other?
MS. WAX:

Well, it says that the employee shall

24

be permitted to return to such employee's position.

25

it is the Department of Labor's view that the condition

And

precedent to returning to your position is that the
position still exists.
Furthermore, this flows from -QUESTION:
MS. WAX:
of that language.

By implication.
Yes, we think it's a tenable reading
And the reason that it's more tenable

than perhaps the alternative, is because 2024(d), and also
other sections contain what this Court has called the
escalator clause, which says that he shall --an
individual shall return with such status and such
seniority as he would have had had he remained on the job.
Now, it's truism that if someone's position is
abolished, they would not have had such a job even if they
had stayed on the job.

And we think that this section

manifests Congress' intent not to make returning trainees
better off than they would have been if they'd stayed.

So

the combination of those two sections, we think, answers
that question.
QUESTION:

Ms. Wax, do you think we owe

deference to the most recent Veterans' Reemployment Rights
Handbook regulations in this area in light of the very
dramatic shifts by the Department of Labor in their view
of this statute and its requirements over the years?
MS. WAX:

Well, Your Honor, this Court has

stated in Monroe v. Standard Oil, that the Veterans'

Reemployment Handbook is an authoritative source of the

interpretation of the act.

3

owed, but I think what we would say is that deference

4

isn't needed here because this is not an issue in the

5

statute where there's any ambiguity.
There are other issues in this statute where

We do think that deference is

7

there is some question about how it is to be applied, and

8

this Court has dealt with them in a long line of cases,

cases that deal with the terms and conditions upon which

10

an individual returns to their job on which the statute

11

may not be crystal clear.

13

and there need be no recourse to the Veterans' Handbook on

14

that question.

But the issue of whether the

MS. WAX:

1

Yes, Your Honor, initial active-duty-

2

training, which by statute and regulation lasts 90 days or

3

less -- 30 to 90 days, that's covered by Section 2024(c),

rights for initial active-duty training.

something else entirely.

I don't understand that because that

Excuse me, right, 90 days -It has to be more than 90 -Excuse me, 3 to 6 months.

That's my

mistake.

all reservists are required to perform that runs from 3 to

6 months.

training that all ready reservists are required to

perform.

This is a new job.

It is not clear

to me why this wasn't an initial period of active duty.

It was an entirely new position for him.

And it was longer than 12 weeks, so

he's not covered by (c), so (d) clicks in.
MS. WAX:

Right.

individual is covered by 2024(d), Your Honor, is to be

found is 2024(f), which specifically addresses the

3

question of the reemployment rights of members of the

4

National Guard who serve on full-time duty under section

5

502 of 32 U.S.C.

That's how they get their orders.

Now, he received his orders under Section 502 of

32 U.S.C.

active-duty training, which is another term of art,

9

receive their orders under another section of Title X,

Individuals who are serving so-called initial

10

actually, I believe.

And that is the kind of training

11

that 2024(c) was meant to apply to.
You're right that this is an initial tour of

12

13

duty for him of AGR duty, but it was decided in the courts

14

below and all parties agree that 2024(d) is the provision

15

that applies, by virtue of the orders that he got -- the

16

orders that he got, which are under Section 502, which is

17

AGR duty.

18

The open-ended language of Section 2024(d) is to

19

be contrasted with the fixed temporal limits to be found

20

in other subsections of 2024, which apply to reservists

21

and others who perform active duty in the armed forces.

22

Section 2024(a), for example, which governs those who

23

enlist on active duty, provides at least 4 years of job

24

protection, and in some cases, 5.

25

subsection (b).

The same applies to

QUESTION:

Yes, but under that one, I guess it's

under (b)(2), he's got to reapply, doesn't he, for a job?
MS. WAX:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And here he just shows up and says I

want to go to work.
MS. WAX:

Correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And also, isn't there a difference in

their protection from discharge after they get back?
MS. WAX:

Correct.

QUESTION:

How does it make sense to say you're

protected from discharge under (a) and (b) and you get no
protection under (d), when you might be away even longer,
as you say?
MS. WAX:

Right.

Well, the answer is that the

reason for this disparity in features for active duty, for
training on the one hand and active duty on the other, can
be explained without reference at all to differences in
duration.

Individuals who are on active duty see combat,

they're in harms way.

They are subjected to - - they are

essentially members of the fighting force.
they are.

Very often

And therefore, Congress could have made the

judgment that those individuals need more protection in
the form of a period to readjust to civilian life.
QUESTION:

Yeah, but why should they have to

reapply instead of just showing up like these people do?

MS. WAX:

QUESTION:

3

Well
That cuts the other way on that part

of it.

4

MS. WAX:

On the other hand, probably in

5

exchange for these greater protections, a

6

post-discharge --a post-return discharge protection, a

7

longer period to reapply, the Government -- Congress

8

decided to give employers a sort of quid pro quo of leeway

9

to put the person in their old job or in another job, for

10

example.

11

letting the employer decide whether he's going to return

12

them to their old job or an equivalent job, which is what

13

employers are committed to do for individuals returning

14

from active duty.

15

And the reapplication process is a way of

And then there was an amendment later on

Your Honor, that's another answer to

21

the question.

that duration is not necessarily the explanation.

I think the answer has two parts.

durational training leaves?
MS. WAX:

Well, at the time it was drafted, the

3

only leaves were the short leaves which are listed in the

4

legislative history, Your Honor.

5

Congress drafted the statute in an open-ended way.

6

didn't put the fixed limits on the statute that it could

7

have put, and in fact, put in other sections like 2024(a),

8

(b), and (g).

That is correct.

But
It

So our position is that the fact that

certain short training duties -- tours were the only ones
10

that existed at the time this statute was enacted, doesn't

11

really prove anything because Congress did not do what it

12

could have done, which is simply to limit the reach of

13

2024(d) and make it an inflexible statute, and make it an

14

inflexible provision that put a ceiling on the leaves,

15

essentially.

16

QUESTION:

Were any of those short training

17

leaves at the time the statute was first enacted wholly

QUESTION:

That was kind of essential to the

10

status of being a reservist, whereas this particular

training assignment is not.

12

MS. WAX:

Isn't that fair to say?

Well, it's not required of you in

13

order to be in the Reserve, but Your Honor, we don't think

14

anything turns on that.

15

worth, no court of appeals that has looked at this, and

16

some of them have actually looked at this particular

The training that is now required is just a result of the

Now, the Eleventh Circuit's ruling is not just

an untenable reading of the statute's terms, but it also

has untenable consequences.

before this Court and asks it to disregard the plain

language of the statute, it suggests or its reason is that

departing from the plain language would better serve the

11

underlying purposes of this statute.

the very opposite is the case.

But of course here,

First of all', the Eleventh Circuit's test, with

14

its emphasis on duration and a per se rule, would in

15

effect deprive all 35,000 members of the National Guard

16

who serve in Active Guard Reserve status of any protection

MR. HOPKINS:
135-18.

It's cited as Army Regulation No.

It says, and I'm going to be brief, a program

that offers career development and upward mobility that
encourages retention.

And I recite that to the Court

because I'm expected to send my person on a mandatory
leave of absence under a program that encourages retention
by the new employer?
QUESTION:

Good point.

MR. HOPKINS:

I also point this out to you, that

AGR personnel will be ordered to active duty or full-time
duty for 3 year periods.

Now, that's what we've stated

the issue to be here, and I'm the one that drafted the
letter denying the 3 years.

But the program goes on to

say personnel may be extended at their current duty
station or reassigned at the conclusion of each 3-year
period, if ordered to a subsequent tour.

And they are

stabilized, which basically means they can't be moved
during the first period, but they can during the
subsequent periods.
I will move on quickly to say that it says that
there are provisions for retention up to 20 years, and it
specifies the program -- the pension program that would be
eligible.

of short duration.

they're talking about something that you say must be --

Because you never -- a leave of

MR. HOPKINS:

That's my opinion.

That's

correct.

the return provision -- the statute was written for some

person in a factory and in a law office, hanging up his

apron, going to summer camp or going to summer drill,

20

someone filling in temporarily, while this person was

21

gone, and coming back and taking his apron off of that

hook, putting it on and resuming work.

too long to let the apron hang there.

MR. HOPKINS:

Your Honor, in my opinion, to

answer that you would need to read the structure of

the idea was so that we could return employees to the work

to have an initial period of training, and then we would

ask that they participate in these short-term programs

And when that person,

ordinarily and usually a young person, finishes that
initial period, that person then comes back to the work
place and then begins the drills and the summer camps.

How long is that initial period

typically for the young person you're referring to?
MR. HOPKINS:

It's typically, based on my

The statute protects down to at least

12 weeks, but it's ordinarily from 12 weeks to 6 months in
duration.

And I think that ambiguity will be resolved

upon a study of the Universal Military Training Act,
because that's the scheme of things that put all of this
together.

And the scheme was let's send these people,

require them initially, to take this training.

And they wouldn't be covered if

they'd been on a weekly program, or one of the regular
programs of once a month weekend duty and two weeks, so

they would be excluded because of the word "initial."

Yes.

all those factors which give it power to persuade if

And I would say that one of the arguments in

QUESTION:

No, it's neither of those.

If you

choose to read the amendment in 1980 when it says for
those purposes full-time duty performed as a member
pursuant to these things shall be considered active duty
for training, a concept that concludes initial active duty
for training as well as subsequent to initial active duty.
It's a question of interpreting the language in the 1980
amendment which changes the meaning of the two earlier
statutes.
MS. WAX:

I take it that you think that in fact

2024(f) amended both (c) and (d) essentially.
QUESTION:

Well, it says so'.

For the purposes

of subsection (c) and (d) and to treat them equally.

It

talked about (d), and I didn't realize it until I looked
at it this morning, that it applies equally to both.
MS. WAX:

Your Honor, we think that's one

plausible interpretation.
QUESTION:

The whole statute fits together very

nicely if you do it that way, because then (d) refers to
training of periods less than that specified year, and (c)
refers to those longer.

And therefore, the longer ones,

the man has to reapply.

The shorter periods, he just

shows up for work and says give me my job back.
