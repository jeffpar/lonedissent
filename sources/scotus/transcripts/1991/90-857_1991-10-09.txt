CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 90-857, Marc Gilbert Doggett v. United States.
Mr. Sheppard?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. SHEPPARD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

9
10

MR. SHEPPARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the constitutional right to a

11

speedy trial in a situation where the defendant, the

12

petitioner herein, had absolutely no knowledge of the

13

existence of an indictment for a period of 8-1/2 years

14

prior to being arrested.

15

For the last 6 years of that 8-1/2 years, it was

16

clear that Mr. Doggett was available to the push of a

17

button, running a credit check, t o determine his

18

whereabouts.

19

the United States Marshals Service, in conducting an

20

operation entitled WANT II, which commenced on September 1

21

of 1988, pushed a button on a credit bureau computer in

22

the Savannah office of the Marshal's Office and within 5

23

minutes found that Marc Doggett resided in Reston,

24

Virginia, where he had been residing openly, freely, and

25

above-board for the last 6 years.

Eight-and-a-half years after his indictment

The Government's efforts immediately after the

2

indictment of Mr. Doggett demonstrates bad faith which

3

constitutes prejudice.

5

Jacksonville, Florida, DEA, went to his parents' home in

6

North Carolina.

7

Shortly after Mr. Doggett's

Mr. Doggett's mother is a Colombian national

8

who's been married to an American citizen for many years

9

and has three children.

These two State officials, at the

10

request of the Federal Government, dropped by her house

11

one time in 8-1/2 years to determine where Mr. Doggett

12

was.

13

that he had left for Colombia, and indeed gave him the

14

flight number of his airplane in Miami, Florida, and the

15

fact that he was updating his passport on his way.

Mrs. ·Doggett immediately notified these officers

16

QUESTION:

But never told him of their visit?

17

MR. SHEPPARD:

The record is absolutely clear,

18

and both the magistrate, the district court, the Eleventh

19

Circuit Court of Appeals, found that Mr. Doggett had no

20

knowledge of his indictment through his mother or anyone.

21

Indeed, the United States in the plea agreement entered

22

into with Mr. Doggett stated that Mr. Doggett had no

23

knowledge of the indictment and indeed the two co-

24

defendants, who were apprehended and tried in 1980, had

25

had no contact with Mr. Doggett.

So the record is without

QUESTION:

Which you can say is as much his

mother's fault as it was the Government's fault.
MR. SHEPPARD:

5

No.

I do not accept that.

The

6

reason I do not accept that is that probably a year-and-

7

a-half after Mr. Doggett was indicted he was arrested in

During that a-month period, the DEA knew that he

was there.

12

the State Department and the DEA didn ' t communicate with

13

each other, and ~o one, including the State Department

14

officials that visited him on numerous occasions, gave him

15

notice of the indictment.

The State Department visited Mr. Doggett on

Unfortunately,

Thereafter, he was released in 19a2 and returned

17

to this country after a couple of months visiting family

in Colombia.

19

the DEA agent in Jacksonville, based on information that

20

he had received in 19a1, fabricated three DEA 6 reports

21

stating that Marc Doggett was still incarcerated in the

22

country of Panama.

23

As long as 2 years - - 32 months, 3a months,

These fabricated reports caused the United

24

States to exert no further effort to obtain the

25

apprehension of Mr. Doggett, to his detriment.

9

Mr. Sheppard, cases from this Court

10

dealing with the speedy trial clause have identified two

11

concerns that are behind the provisions of the clause.

12

One is the anxiety factor of someone who is aware of the

13

indictment, and nothing has happened, and secondly the

14

loss of liberty pending trial if someone's incarcerated.

15

Now, we don't have either of those things at play here.
MR. SHEPPARD:

16

I would certainly concede that,

17

Justice O'Connor, but I would also state that the same

18

precedent from which those two concerns were articulated

19

also communicated a third concern, and that is impairment

20

of the defense of a person.

MR. SHEPPARD:

Indeed, the courts below did not

find actual prejudice.

an erroneous analysis of this record, and I'd like to

4

communicate why Mr. Doggett was prejudiced.

5

However, we submit that that was

1979, '80 time period when this case was investigated.

Mr. Doggett was involved in

transaction.

The Government in their brief, and I suspect

10

in their argument, will attempt to lead you to believe

11

that he was involved in a 40-kilogram cocaine transaction.

12

That would belie the record if one reviews the

13

record closely.

He pled ·· entered a conditional plea

14

involving 5.7 grams of cocaine, and the Eleventh Circuit

15

opinion affirming the conviction of the two co-defendants

16

in 1982 explicitly indicated that there was no involvement

17

by Mr. Doggett.

18

Now, the prejudice that Mr. Doggett suffered

19

was, number one, there were 17 tapes that were missing,

20

and 8·1/2 years later it's hard to say (1) were the tapes

Ivan Cifuentes at the time of the hearing on

communicated with by the DEA for a 1-1/2 year period, and

as DEA Agent Driver stated, he, along with the tapes, was,

The court -- the Eleventh Circuit found that

6

7

that witness was available.

If the Eleventh Circuit

8

reviewed the record closely, as was their obligation, they

9

would have not made that finding, because he was not

10

available.

He had entered the witness protection program,

11

had voluntarily withdrawn, and Agent Driver had not

12

communicated with him or had any i nformation of his

13

whereabouts for at least a year-and-a-half period.
QUESTION:

14

Am I correct, Mr. Sheppard, that he

hasn't been in any trouble in this latter period of his

life?

the Government was carrying out its due diligence

directly to him by plugging them into a computer to

MR. SHEPPARD:

He received a $1,000 fine, a

3

three-year probationary term, and most devastatingly, a

4

felony conviction which he will carry for the remainder of

5

his life due to the actions of the United States and its

failure to carry out its duty.

inherent equities of the case?

wouldn't you?

activity is the proper focus of the analysis.

this Court, and going back to Justice O'Connor's inquiry,

If

20

we were writing on a clean slate, could you argue that a

speedy trial is either speedy or not?

22

that he has anguish, it's irrelevant that he has

prejudice, and it's irrelevant that he's lost or not lost

liberty.

any of those factors exist.

1

MR. SHEPPARD:

Well, we are submitting a rule

2

that isn't quite as radical as looking at just the

3

duration of time.

4

We submit for this Court's consideration kind of

5

a fine-tuning of this Court's precedent, where, as in a

6

case like this, the time of the delay from indictment to

7

arrest exceeds the period of time contained in the statute

8

of limitations, which is 5 years, and that the defendant

9

does not know of the existence of the charges against him

10

and therefore is not a fugitive, that the defendant should

11

not be required to show prejudice.

12

Now, we're not asking for a per se rule.

We're

13

just submitting that it is impossible for Marc Doggett to

14

go back 8-1/2 years later and prove what he doesn't know,

10

him to Colombia, going to see his grandmother and his

11

elderly aunts throughout his youth, yes.

Congress, prior to its abolition of the Youth Corrections

13

Act and the Young Adult Offender Act felt that age 22 was

14

not too old for special consideration of individuals who

15

had made youthful mistakes in becoming involved in

criminal activity.

it takes them another 3 months to locate the malefactor,

suggesting by my bright line rule is that in an 8-1/2 year

14

delay, and especially if you look at the record, DEA Agent

coincidentally was transferred to Panama and learned 3-

1/2 years later that Mr. Doggett was in Panama, that he

could not recall what, if anything, he did as a result of

A young person,

1

incarcerated for 8 months in the Panamanian jail, when he

2

was still eligible for treatment under that act, if the

3

Government had put him on notice he could have triggered a

4

treaty, a prisoner-transfer treaty to this country, to

allow him to serve his time here and also to get on with

what he's going to have to get on with, and that is the

prosecution of this case.

Did you make that argument in the

court of appeals or in the district court?

MR. SHEPPARD:

QUESTION:

Yes.

With respect to the tapes and the

12

witness, is it correct that you have no idea whether they

13

would have been anything exculpatory either in the tapes

14

or in the testimony of the witness?
MR. SHEPPARD:

15

The only thing that I know about

16

the tapes, Justice Souter, are some DEA 6 reports that

17

were prepared, and I think -- and it didn't deal with

18

all -- there were 17 tapes.

the tapes.

20

,

It didn't deal with all of

Most of those tapes dealt with the later

21

transactions, and the only tapes that dealt with my client

22

dealt with 5.7 grams of cocaine, so that I think that

23

arguably those tapes could have shown his very peripheral

24

involvement in maybe a separate conspiracy.

sure that that was his voice on those tapes.

Mr. Sheppard, why should -- why

10

should the criterion for whether the Government is

found and arrested him in time?

13

Why -- it's a sad state of affairs only because

he does not know of the outstanding indictment.

it enough if the Government took reasonable action that

16

would, in the normal course, have advised him of the

17

existence of the indictment?

Why isn't

Why wouldn't that be enough?

If that is enough, why i sn't going to his last

19

20

indictment outstanding and that the Government would like

21

him to appear to stand trial, why isn't that enough?

But that assumes that they have an

obligation to find and arrest this man.

7

MR. SHEPPARD:

8

QUESTION:

They do, under Barker.

For the purpose of the interest that

9

you're concerned about in this case , it seems to me their

10

only obligation is to make sure that he gets notice of the

11

fact that there's an indictment so that he may come and

12

get the prompt trial to which he's entitled.

14

mother about it, doesn't fulfill that obligation.

15

And I don't

Thereafter, maybe they were negligent, as good

16

cops, in not arresting him sooner, and that's something

17

for which they're liable to the rest of the public for,

18

but I don't know why they're under any special liability

19

to him for that.

20

MR. SHEPPARD:

I think it's important to recall

21

the record that there was one trip to his mother, who I

22

indicated earlier is not an American.

in the record and some confusion in the record about what

Normally when you have an obligation

MR. SHEPPARD:

1

The people that were responsible

2

for arresting him, I would respectfully submit, impacted

3

on the other Government entities actions by fabricating

4

three reports 24 months after the fact, 32 months after

5

the fact, and 36 months after the fact.

6

fabricated reports contribute to a prejudiced analysis .

7

You cannot be free f rom prejudicial conduct to others if

8

you act in bad faith, and I think that the core of that

9

was candidly testified to by that DEA agent.

10

We asked

him .
QUESTION:

11

12

And these

You're back to the bad faith

argument.
MR . SHEPPARD:

13

I'm suggesting that bad faith

14

equals prejudice when you take the collective bad faith

15

actions in this case.

QUESTION:

And I think the easy way for this

To say bad faith equals prejudice

18

certainly is equating t wo words that ordinarily are not.

If bad faith refers to the state of mind with which an

actor goes about doing something, prejudice refers to the

effect of something on someone else.

So maybe my choice of wo rds is wrong, but if

3

that file were available -- and it wasn't Marc Doggett

that destroyed it; it was the Gove rnment that destroyed

MR. MUELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court traditionally has looked at the four-

4

pronged test of Barker v. Wingo in resolving issues

5

relating to the deprivation or alleged deprivation of a

6

Sixth Amendment speedy trial violation.

7

Those four factors identified in Barker are the

8

length of the delay, the cause of the delay, the

9

defendant's assertion of their right to a speedy trial,

10

and prejudice.

11

and the magistrate before entered into the appropriate

12

balancing test set out in Barker to determine that there

13

was no violation of Mr. Doggett's Sixth Amendment right to

14

a speedy trial in this case.

at this factor as a triggering mechanism, and indeed below

we indicated that the length of delay in this case is a

triggering mechanism.

11

case is somewhat unique, in as much as those core concer ns

12

of the Six th Amendment were not impl icated for the period
