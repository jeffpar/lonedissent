ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT P. JOY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JOY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case comes to the Court on writ of

11

12

certiorari from the First Circuit Court of Appeals.

The

13

question presented is whether an employer may legitimately

14

bar nonunion -- nonemployee union organizers from

15

trespassing on its private property to seek to organize

16

its employees when reasonable alternative means of

17

reaching them are available.
This Court, in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox, a

18
19

unanimous opinion in 1956, held that an employer may, in

20

those circumstances, preserve his private property rights

21

and exclude the union.

22

the First Circuit with a strong dissent endorsing a ruling

23

of the National Labor Relations Board held to the

24

contrary.

25

should be reversed, and in so doing this Court should

In this case, a divided panel of

2

reaffirm its holding in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox.
Petitioner submits these principal arguments

3

where Lechmere v. The National Labor Relations Board

4

should be reversed.

5

First, the First Circuit endorsed the board's

6

decisional model enunciated in Jean Country, which rests

7

upon an erroneous legal foundation.

8

threshold inquiry into whether reasonable alternative

9

means of reaching employees through the usual channels of

By taking the

communication exist before trespass will be authorized and

11

denoting that inquiry in the analysis to one of three

12

factors of seemingly equal standing, the analytical regime

13

fashioned by this Court in Babcock & Wilcox is dismantled

14

and the private property rights of the employer are

15

substantially diminished and oftentimes destroyed.

16

A second principal argument that we submit to

17

the Court why the First Circuit should be reversed is that

18

the First Circuit and the board, while paying lip service

19

to the holding of Babcock & Wilcox that so long as there

20

are reasonable alternative means available to the union to

21

reach the employees, no trespass should be authorized,

22

nonetheless allowed the union's effectiveness in

23

persuading employees as opposed to

24

become a factor in judging whether trespass is warranted.

25

Third, the First Circuit endorsed the board's

creation of an impermissibly low standard for establishing

2

that the use of alternative communications methods is not

reasonable.

4

Carpenters, this Court stated that the burden of proving

5

that trespass is necessary is a heavy one.

In Sears & Roebuck v. San Diego Council of

In Lechmere, the First Circuit and the board, we

submit, in addition to allowing unfounded inferences,

8

conjecture, and partial facts to satisfy this heavy

9

burden, has given strong indications that a new and

10

impermissibly easy standard for unreasonableness of a

11

communication method has emerged by describing

12

accessibility to the work force in terms of whether a

13

union can obtain the names and addresses of employees

14

through an employer-furnished list, or otherwise.

MR. JOY:

that it's an indication of just how strongly this employer

3

has asserted its private property interest.

On June 16, 1987, the United Food and Commercial

5

Workers began a campaign to organize the employees at

6

Lechmere by first putting a full-page ad in the Hartford

7

Courant newspaper, which is the largest newspaper in the

8

area of daily circulation.

The ad, by the way, was aimed

9

directly at the employees.

Two days later, on June 18th, the union began a

14

series of trespassory forays into the store and the

15

parking lot of Lechmere, stuffing union literature inside

16

merchandise and in the restrooms and handbilling in the

17

parking lot, including the employee section of the parking

lot, which was closest to a 46-foot-wide public grass

that section of the parking lot.

testimony of union organizer Lisa Meucci, who was asked

this question by counsel for the general counsel of the

The testimony in the record indicates that the

9:30, making sure that people who parked their cars were

employees.

18

There's no question but that the union was aware

19

that the majority of the employees parked in that section,

which was accessible within 4 feet by public land.

21

On June 20th, the organizers again made three

22

intrusions into the parking lot and handbilled.

parked there.

MR. JOY:

QUESTION:

4

Yes, Your Honor.
But they still couldn't reach them

there, right, unless — unless they went onto the land?
MR. JOY:

5

They — they could not walk up and

6

touch them, Your Honor, but they certainly, within 4 feet,

7

a distance greater than separates you and I, could beckon

8

them to come over, all the while saying, I have a piece of

9

literature here that you should be interested in.

10

Please

come over and talk with me further about it.
I suggest to you that that short 4 feet distance

11
12

should not rise to the level of making them inaccessible.

Indeed, Your Honor, there were other —

QUESTION:

15

MR. JOY:

Every car was 4 feet from this —
No, Your Honor, but the — the length

16

of property that bordered on Berlin Turnpike was several

17

hundred feet in length, and the employees, while they all

18

didn't, in one single line, up against that section of

19

public land, park, nonetheless, I think that the testimony

20

indicates that there may have been only two or three rows

21

of cars, but certainly that first row of cars was within

22

4 feet.

23

And by the way, Your Honor, that's not the only

24

method of reaching the employees that was available to the

25

employees in this case.

MR. JOY:

Yes, Your Honor, and I will do that

the organizational campaign began, gathered the names and

In addition, for a month straight, this union

parking lot, - picketed for a month straight, and then for

the next 6 months intermittently -- now, that picketing

switched its target from the organization of the employees

to an area standards kind of a picket, but nonetheless,

QUESTION:

MR. JOY:

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Joy —
Yes, Your Honor?
The — the board found, I gather,

23

that there were no feasible and effective alternatives to

24

going on the property.

MR. JOY:

That's correct, the board so found,

1

Your Honor, and I would submit to you that they applied an

2

erroneous legal standard in defining what reasonable

3

alternative means were.

4

We submit that what the board was saying

5

and -- and applying here was a standard under which

6

the — the union must be effective, must have reasonable

7

alternative means which are effective in persuading the

8

employees, as opposed to effective in merely reaching

9

them, and the Babcock command, the command that this Court

10

gave in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox in 1956 was that the

11

available methods need only be effective in reaching

12

employees, not persuading employees.

13

Indeed, Your Honor, the Court in Babcock denied

14

enforcement of a board order, and the underlying board

15

decision found that there were no reasonable alternative

16

means of communication because the methods of

17

communication in the board's Babcock case were not — were

18

in — were not as effective as placing the

19

employees -- the union organizers, I should say, on the

20

employer's property.

21

The Court, while stating that the trespass that

22

was authorized in Babcock was minimal and not

23

unreasonable, nonetheless rejected the board's

24

interpretation of that rule of law and said that more ‘

25

effective means isn't the issue.

The issue is whether or

1

not reasonable alternative means are available by the

2

usual methods of communication, and the Court cited as the

3

usual methods of communication telephone calls, home

4

visits, advertised meetings, and the like, and it appears

5

in footnote 1, I believe, of the Babcock Supreme Court

6

decision.
It — it also referred in Babcock not just to

7
8

the usual methods of communication but the usual ways of

9

imparting information.

10

First Circuit endorsing the board, I believe, has

11

misunderstood that rule of law that was enunciated

12

respecting reasonable alternative means.
It — indeed, in the board's own brief to this

13
»

In this case, the board and the

14

Court on page 11, it talks about the paraphrasing — or, I

15

should say it paraphrased Babcock & Wilcox by talking

16

about the effectively engaging in organizational activity.

17

That connotes to me that the definition, the

18

interpretation, is one where they are convinced that the

19

effectiveness means effectiveness in persuading and not

20

reaching.

one clean swoop the board and the First Circuit have

2

eliminated the very tools used by the entire advertising

3

and political industry to reach its targeted audience, and

4

without any evidence on the record in this case that the

5

employees were not reached by these mass media attempts,

6

the board summarily dismisses the very same method of

7

communication that the union began its campaign with,

8

and —

Did the board explain, Mr. Joy, why

10

it dismissed the mass media as a possible means of

11

communication?

QUESTION:

MR. JOY:

It said, Your Honor, that in most

13

cases it will be considered expensive or ineffective, and

14

I believe that's further indication that they misconstrue

15

the word effective to mean, effective in persuading as

16

opposed to effective in reaching.

17

18

case the union certainly did not apparently consider that

19

method of communication expensive.

20

utilized that method six times.

They also placed an

Your Honor, I would like to speak to the first

22

argument that I mentioned, and that is that by relying on

to follow the applicable law.

1

As I mentioned, this was a unanimous opinion by

2

eight Justices in 1956, and it construed the act and

3

fashioned the legal rule that governs nonemployees seeking

4

to trespass on an employer's property as distinguished

5

from employees, and that rule prohibited trespassing

6

except where the target employees were inaccessible and

7

beyond the reach of less intrusive nontrespassory means.

8

9

We — I submit to you, Your Honor, that the
Babcock Court placed a sentinel at the boundary of the

10

private property, and that sentinel was a threshold

11

inquiry — improve to me you have no reasonable available

12

other means before I must let you by onto my property.

13

reducing that inquiry to a relative contest among three of

14

coequal status, the board and the First Circuit endorsing

15

the board has taken that sentinel off his post guarding

16

the property.

17

By

I — perhaps, if I may mix my metaphors, a

18

little historical context of this most recent test

19

enunciated by the board is helpful.

20

Jean Country — and by the way, Jean Country was decided

21

in 1988 — 2 years before that, in Fairmont Hotels, the

22

board enunciated a test for access by nonemployees onto

23

employers' private property, and in that test in Fairmont

24

the board said, we're going to — going to balance the

25

property rights on the one hand against the section 7

right on the other hand, and only if they' are in equipoise
will we then look to reasonable alternative available
means.
Jean Country came along 2 years later, and the
board apparently recognized its error and resurrected the
threshold inquiry in Babcock from its obscurity and
brought it up to a factor to be considered equally with
the other two.

In essence, then, what the board did was

it took the horse from behind the cart and put it into the
cart, and that's what the First Circuit adopted by
endorsing the board's order in this case.
Now, the — the Supreme Court decisions since
Babcock have bolstered rather than diminished the vitality
of the rule of law enunciated in Babcock.
QUESTION:

And what rule of law do you say has

been violated by the board?
MR. JOY:

The — the board has taken

the — mandated the required threshold inquiry into
whether reasonable alternative means are available to
reach the intended audience before we have to consider
when and how much trespass is necessary.

The board has

removed that threshold inquiry, that protection against
unnecessary trespass, and that threshold inquiry, that
decisional regime, was dictated by this Court in Babcock &
Wilcox, I submit, Justice White.

QUESTION:

Would -- would you agree that because

2

the word reasonable is in there, it's perfectly

3

appropriate for them to consider the strength of the

4

property right and consider the particularity of the

5

section 7 right acquired?

6

it an undue prominence, and in effect promoting those two

7

inquiries to the level of a test as opposed merely to

8

being factors to be considered, is that true?

9

MR. JOY:

You just think they're giving

Our proposition, Justice Souter, is

10

that before any analysis of the strength of the property

11

right versus the strength of the section 7 right in

12

question is to be engaged in, the threshold inquiry must

13

first be asked and answered.

14

QUESTION:

Yeah, but the word reasonable is in

15

there, and what are they supposed to consider when

16

they — when they — when they inquire about

17

reasonableness?

18

that — that they're really — that you're reading the

19

word reasonable out of there, and it seems to me that

20

you're saying as long as there is any other means of

21

communication, any other means of reaching, that that's

22

the end of the inquiry, but you've got to do something

23

with the word reasonable.

MR. JOY:

I don't believe, Your Honor, that

Darlington involved the situation where nonemployees were

you to Sears & Roebuck, and the quotation appears on page

On page 18 of our brief, we cite the language in
Sears which states as follows, if I may.
While there are unquestionably examples of

trespassory union activity that might be protected under

section 7, experience under the act teaches that such

situations are rare, and that a trespass is far more
likely to be unprotected than protected.
Experience with trespassory organizational
solicitation by nonemployees is instructive in this
regard.

While Babcock indicates that an employer may not

always bar nonemployee union organizers from his property,
his right to do so remains the general rule.

To gain

access, the union has the burden of showing that no other
reasonable means of communicating its organizational
message to employees exists, or that the employer's access
rules discriminate.

The burden is a heavy one, and has

Country, which says that, most significantly, in

13

Now, someone who is using your hypothetical,

into that calculus.

Finally, let me say, Your Honors, that the board

and the First Circuit rely on language from Hudgens v. the

NLRB as its essential cornerstone in justifying the Jean

21

the locus of that accommodation between property rights

Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6
7

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the National

8

Labor Relations Board has reasonably accommodated

9

competing section 7 rights and property rights.

The board

10

found in this case that petitioner's denial of access to

11

its parking lot for organizational handbilling violated

12

section 8(a)(1) of the act, which makes it an unfair labor

13

practice for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or

14

coerce employees in fheir section 7 rights.

15

The board's interpretation of this general

16

language is a reasonable one, and it should be upheld.

17

The petitioner's argument here today makes clear that its

18

entire reliance is placed on the Babcock & Wilcox decision

19

and inferences that petitioner draws from that decision.

20

But the board's rule that's under review today,

21

however, is consistent with Babcock & Wilcox.

22

central principle of Babcock & Wilcox is that the board

23

must make an accommodation between private property rights

24

and section 7 rights when the two conflict, and that

25

accommodation must be obtained with as little destruction

First, the

of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other.

2

I would suggest that that formulation itself implies that

3

the board should consider weighing the impact on

4

respective rights before reaching the appropriate

accommodation.

6

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Dreeben, you're talking

7

about an abstract proposition, which of course you have to

8

talk about in a case like this, but there is a remarkable

9

similarity to the layout, it seems to me, of Babcock &

10

Wilcox and to the layout of this particular organization,

11

yet in Babcock & Wilcox this Court said the board could

12

not require nonemployee access, and in this case the board

13

says yes, we can require nonemployee access.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the

15

facts in Babcock were quite different than the facts in

16

activity.

This Court in Hudgins v. NLRB recognized

Well, do you think the board would be

making a mistake under Babcock if they said it doesn't

make any difference whether the media are available, or

18

whether the telephone is available, or anything like that?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

I think that the board does

20

not have the freedom to say what it said in Babcock, which

21

is that it doesn't matter whether nonemployees have

alternative means.

The board in Babcock had equated the right of

nonemployees to enter for purposes of engaging in

organizational communications with the right of employees

that the section 7 rights that are being protected are the

5

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, this Court has recognized

8

that it is a literal interference with the employees'

9

ability to get information if the employer prevents

10

someone from handing them a handbill.

11

I mean, Babcock & Wilcox itself recognizes that

12

there is a violation of section 8(a)(1) by the employer's

13

denial of access, so I don't think that there's any

14

question that the language of the act read literally

15

applies to an employer's attempt to keep the employees

16

from getting the information.

17

In this case, the employer's representatives

actually pulled a handbill out of the hands of the

employees, and I would suggest that is a literal

interference with the right to get information.

I think, Justice Scalia, that what your question

I — I think what it goes to is — I

I think, as you say, the -- the information must

3

be given to the employee, whether the employee wants to

hear it or not, and unless there's some opportunity for

5

that, you just simply don't think it's adequate access.

6

Is that — is that an unfair characterization?
MR. DREEBEN:

7

I think that — that whether there

8

is or isn't adequate access is something that depends on

9

particular facts, and — and it could well be that in a

10

particular case the board would find that access from

11

public property to the employees was certainly good

12

enough.

13

QUESTION:

Well, that isn't the point, whether

14

it's access from public property.

15

is enough access to give the employee the clear notice

16

that the information is available and let him say that he

methods such as telephone calls, visits on streets, home

QUESTION:

Communicating, I'd like to talk to you about the union,

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think the board has the

20

right to make the judgment that that's not going to be a

21

reasonably effective way for the employees to even

22

understand what the union wants to talk to them about, and

23

that is, after all, what the board's mission is in this

case, and when the Court spoke of the accommodation of

25

interests in the Hudgens case, it had in mind that the

2

property and the kind of section 7 right and question in

3

deciding whether there was adequate protection of the

4

section 7 right in question.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, do you think that

6

Babcock & Wilson stands for the proposition that it is a

7

two-tier inquiry, that you first have to determine whether

8

there are reasonable alternatives to the trespass in order

9

to contact the employees, and only if the answer to that
%

10

is no would you go on?

11

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think, Justice O'Connor,

12

that Babcock structures the inquiry so that the board is

13

precluded from doing what it does here, which is

14

considering the reasonableness of alternatives in

available, that's the end of the case, but the board does

2

not view that as a factor in isolation from other factors,

3

and I would suggest that's exactly what this Court

4

recognized that the board might do in Hudgens v. NLRB,

5

where it spoke of the accommodation as falling as -- on

6

points along a spectrum.

7

There's nothing to suggest in that case that the

8

Court's language should be read as — as saying that the

9

board can only look at the section 7 right and property

10

right after it looks at alternative means, and Babcock

11

should not be read so as to restrict the board's latitude

12

in interpreting the act in that fashion.
QUESTION:

13

Well, I — under Jean I would think

14

that it may be that alternatives would be reasonable,

15

considered reasonable in one case and unreasonable in

16

another, depending on the degree of intrusion on the

17

property?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

The — the

19

purpose of that inquiry is to fulfill what the board spoke

20

of in Babcock.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

So you are balancing the

reasonableness against the degree of intrusion.
MR. DREEBEN:

What the board is balancing is how

much section 7 rights will suffer against how much

property rights will suffer.

Because one — one would think that

saying that's an unreasonable rule, but it seems to me

that that's the necessary thrust of this decision.

MR. DREEBEN:

I think the thrust of this

decision is that the board is entitled to take into

account the fact that a parking lot is essentially open to

Court was doing in Sears was attempting to foreordain how

20

the board might apply the act in future cases.

21

Court was doing in Sears was summarizing certain language

22

from Babcock and stating what it had understood the

What the

1

Justice Blackmun pointed out in his concurrence

2

in that case, I believe, that the board's experience had

3

been comparatively limited in applying Babcock, because

4

for several years there had been First Amendment holdings

5

of this Court that recognized shopping centers as

6

essentially forums protected by the First Amendment, and

7

the board had not gained as much experience in developing

8

and applying the law, so what the Court did in Sears was

9

look to the existing state of the law and summarize it.

10

I don't believe that it purported to change it.

11

I certainly don't believe that it purported to overrule

12

the statement in Hudgens, which was an access case, where

13

the Court said that there are a spectrum of various

14

accommodations that depend upon the character and strength

15

of the property interest and the section 7 interest in any

16

given case.

17

That is what the board is attempting to

18

implement in this case.

the expense and the unlikeliness that the newspapers will

reason for rejecting mass media as an alternative in every

case.

10

I think the board's answer to that is a quite

Similarly, in this case the board looked

11

at -- at what the union had available for contacts with

12

the employees at their homes through tracing license

13

plates and concluded that that was not effective either.

14

The reason is that the union attempted to trace license

15

plates over several months, and it obtained less than a

fifth of the names of petitioner's employees.

17

That is not going to get the message about the

MR. DREEBEN:

That's precisely my point,

17

Justice Stevens.

18

there were newspapers that the employees might be exposed

not have a building open to the public, but that is not

section 7 rights suffered in a particular case by the
