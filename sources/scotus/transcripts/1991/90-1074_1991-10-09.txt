ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

11

MR. GILLETTE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is before the Court on a writ of

12

certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the

13

Ninth Circuit.

14

is a case about federalism.

Like Coleman v. Thompson last term, this

15

Specifically, it deals with the extent to which

16

a Federal court may review the admission of evidence in a

17

State criminal trial pursuant to the due process clause of

18

the Fourteenth Amendment.

19

Although this Court has long recognized that a

20

defendant may be denied due process if .his trial is not

21

fundamentally fair, and has also noted that the test for

22

evaluating fundamental fairness is less demanding than the

23

beyond-a-reasonable-doubt test of Chapman v. California,

24

it has not provided any specific guidance to assist the

25

lower Federal courts in evaluating such cases.

While we recognize, of course, that bright lines

are difficult to draw in an area as amorphous as due

3

process, we nevertheless believe that some more specific

4

guidance can be provided, and that this case illustrates

5

the need for precisely that type of guidance.
I want to touch very briefly upon a few of the

6

7

facts in the case which will highlight what the Ninth

8

Circuit did, and then turn to the two-part test which we

9

propose, and discuss the reasons why we urge its adoption

10

upon this Court.
Respondent in this case was convicted, in 1982,

11
12

by a jury in Oakland, California, of second degree murder.

13

The victim was his 6-month-old child, Tori.

14

brought to the hospital emergency room on July 7, 1981, by

15

respondent and his wife.

16

minutes later.

17

Tori was

Testimony from the coroner and the pediatrician

who examined her in the emergency room established that

19

she had sustained significant injury as a result of a

20

beating.

21

and there was massive damage to her internal organs.

There were contusions on her chest and abdomen,

Both of those witnesses were allowed to testify

22

23

as experts that Tori was the victim of battered child

24

syndrome.

also allowed to refer to trauma apart from the injuries

In support of that diagnosis, the experts were

The diagnosis of battered child syndrome, as
well as the admission of the priors as a part of the prior
injuries, as a part of that, was admitted pursuant to

10

long-standing and accepted California case law, permitting

11

the battered child syndrome.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Gillette, now that evidence, the

13

battered child syndrome evidence, is relevant for what

14

purpose?

MR. GILLETTE:

To establish, specifically, that

16

this child's death was not an accident; that she was

intentionally killed.

Was it used in this case for any

other purpose?

to make a reasonable inference that having committed one,

the defendant had committed the other.
QUESTION:

10

Well, the California courts have

11

acknowledged, haven't they, that this is an inevitable

12

inference, if the defendant is one of the few people with

13

custody of the child, and the child has a series of

14

injuries over a period of time, it's almost inevitable

that the jury will conclude that this defendant was either

or not the permitted purpose for which the evidence is

5

MR. GILLETTE:

6

In the long run, I think that it doesn't matter

Precisely, Your Honor.

7

so much whether the California court was right or wrong.

8

The question is, the evidence having come in, this

9

evidence not being shown to violate any specific

10

protection or guarantee of the Bill of Rights, can the

11

defendant, nevertheless, establish that its use in this

12

case denied him a fundamentally fair trial?

That is precisely right, Your

Honor.

QUESTION:

May I ask, though, does it make any

5

difference whether the evidence was admitted for the

purpose of proving the battered child syndrome, on the one

7

hand; or for the purpose of proving that the defendant

8

committed the earlier brutal acts, and therefore to give

9

rise to the inference that he may also have committed the

10

one for which he is being tried.
And that was the third part of the trial judge's

11
12

instruction.

MR. GILLETTE:

For constitutional purposes, I

think it makes no difference.

understand it, there's nothing in the record to connect

him with the prior acts, other than the possibility he had

custody of the child.

The extent to which the

Mr. Gillette, I take it that in a

7

trial in which the defendant is charged with

10

guilty.

And that would include the evidence of the

11

battered child syndrome, would it not?

12

MR. GILLETTE:

13

QUESTION:

Precisely.

To narrow the --as you

14

suggest -- narrow the possibility to someone who

15

intentionally did it to the child, rather than accident.

16

MR. GILLETTE:

That's correct.

And the battered

17

child syndrome does have added significance with respect

18

to who did it in this case.

19

that diagnosis, in addition to the observation of the

20

actual injuries which the child has sustained, is evidence

21

of an inconsistent or impossible explanation offered by a

22

care-giver -- and we use that term advisedly -- as to how

23

the child may have been injured.

had fallen off of the couch.

demonstrate, persuasively, that there was no possibility

4

that a fall by a 6-month-old child, whether it was sixteen

5

inches, as the distance was measured from the couch to the

6

carpeted floor in this case -- or even 16 feet -- could

7

have resulted in that type of massive internal and

8

external injuries.

Yet the medical evidence

In short, the battered child syndrome, in part,
10

was supported by the fact the defendant gave a completely

11

inconsistent and impossible explanation.

12

Now, that brings us back again to the question

13

that I want to primarily discuss with the Court, if I may,

14

for a few minutes - - and that is the issue of to what

15

extent, and what is the process by which a Federal court

16

should consider the issue of whether evidence came into

17

the case in violation of due process, when there has been

18

no showing of a specific violation of a guarantee of the

1

Bill of Rights.

20

And we think that there is a two-part analysis,

21

a very limited analysis that would be appropriate for the

22

Federal court to undertake in a case of that sort.

23

The first question the Federal court should ask

24

is was it relevant?

25

due process has been satisfied.

If it was relevant, we submit that

court to determine, the Federal court, is was it

inflammatory, we submit as appropriate the test which this

5

Court has used in other situations for evaluating due

reasonable probability that had this evidence been

excluded, there would have been a different result in this

case.

And to determine whether the evidence was

connection between the prior injuries and the injuries

every court which has considered the issue of battered

to show the pattern that this child's -- what happened to

mistreatment, and that her death could not have been

And she -- Mrs. McGuire asks him again, and he

repeats the same explanation, she fell off the couch.

in California, of a silent adoption of that accusation -consciousness of guilt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN HARDGROVE VORIS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. VORIS:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The Ninth Circuit said that the aggregate effect

13

of the admittance of irrelevant, highly prejudicial

14

evidence, compounded by the trial court's instruction to

15

use that evidence in the most prejudicial manner possible,

16

rendered the trial arbitrary and fundamentally unfair.

17

Mark McGuire was denied due process of law by

18

the use of the prior injury evidence, coupled with a jury

19

instruction which gave maximum prejudicial effect, rather

20

than a limiting effect.

21

The Attorney General has suggested a test which

22

requires that we first look at the relevance and then at

23

the prejudice.

24
25

The first point which I would like to make is
that the battered child syndrome evidence -- the battered

injuries, at all.

The battered child syndrome can be, and

Dr. Levine testified, that the battered child syndrome
could be proven with the acts which took place
which killed the child.
None the -- so, I'm not sure that even on the
threshold test of relevance, that this evidence passes the
threshold test.
QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Voris, suppose that the

trial court had told the jury that they could only
consider the evidence of battered child syndrome as
tending to show that the child did not die accidentally,
and the jury was so instructed, would you still be here
arguing that is unconstitutional?
MS. VORIS:

I do not believe so.

In fact,

Justice O'Connor, the defendants proposed a jury
instruction at the time, which stated that evidence of
prior injuries have -- has been introduced for the purpose
of showing that Tori -- Tori McGuire suffered from the
battered child syndrome.

Such evidence, if believed, was

not received, and may not be considered by you to prove
that defendant is a person of bad character, or that he
has a disposition to commit crimes.

MS. VORIS:

Justice Scalia, that hypothetical

tracks exactly United States v. Woods, wherein the Federal

court stated that it was proper to admit battered child

5

-- the evidence of her previous seven children.

6

Woods had all these children which died of sudden infant

MS. VORIS:

First, because the murder, itself,

There must be a foundational requirement.

You are classifying bad acts evidence

Do you think there is a prohibition

in the Federal Constitution against using that sort of

defendant having committed the crime?

18

MS. VORIS:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, my belief is

19

that every single State of the Union, and every -- and the

20

Federal system requires that there be an analysis of the

21

evidence prior to its admission.

22

the analysis was to be undertaken, the court was told and

23

believed that no analysis was necessary.

24

still being taken, that this prior -- that battered child

This position is

regarding the characters in terms of similars.
Now, what happened in this case, was then an

2

3

instruction was given, which took it from being battered

4

child syndrome evidence to rebut an accident defense, and

5

turned it into similars evidence, by means of a connection

6

made by the instruction -- not by the evidence.

7

And what happened also is that intent and

8

identity were provided not by evidence in this case, but

9

by this instruction.

And in so doing, the burden of proof

10

was shifted, and the presumption of innocence was taken

11

away.
When that happened, fundamental fairness was

12

13

taken away, and due process was denied.

There was no evidence as to who the rib injuries

Mrs. McGuire, who said that she did it herself.

However, I don't believe that that is the

constitutional question here.

The question here is, if

the evidence -- this evidence was introduced for a

11

particular purpose, and then the jury was instructed to

12

use it as character evidence, and to use it for the most

13

prejudicial purpose that it could --

The jury was instructed not to use it

QUESTION:

So it was relevant evidence,

was -- its probative value was negligible and its

MS. VORIS:

No, I do not concede that it was

It was irrelevant to this,

Well, at least the court.-- the

Eighth Court of Appeals seemed to think it had some

MS. VORIS:

But, if you were to weigh it under

QUESTION:

10

Pardon -- I think I can rephrase what

Justice White asked you.

11

Part of the Ninth Circuit's reasoning here, was

12

that the evidence need not have been admitted because the

13

defendant did not raise accident as a defense.

14

they thought maybe a defendant filed an answer to an

15

information or indictment in California.

16

Do you subscribe to that view?

California and Federal law --

MS. VORIS:

1

As to whether that, in its -- on its

2

own is a denial of due process, I don't believe that it's

3

necessary to look at that because when the jury

4

instruction was coupled with it, it completely took it out

of the realm of a fair trial.

QUESTION:

Ms. Voris, can I a question

that -- do you know if on the appeal in the State court,

there was an error asserted with regard to the

instruction?

10

I know the evidence question was preserved,

but was the instruction error preserved?
MS. VORIS:

11

The instruction error was preserved.

The court of appeal did not discuss it at all.

conviction of Mark McGuire was based on unlawful evidence

denied him due process..
