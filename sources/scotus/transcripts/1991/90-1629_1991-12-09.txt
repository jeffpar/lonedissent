5

Mr. Lah

The trustee for Nordic Village then brought this

action seeking to recover the $20,000 payment on the

7

grounds that it was an unauthorized postpetition transfer.

8

The bankruptcy court agreed, and held that the transfer

was voidable, and entered the $20,000 judgment against

10

IRS.

And the District Court for the Northern District of

Ohio affirmed.

MR. SEAMON:

4

So you in fact learned that there was

was aware the availability of the argument before then.

5

In Hoffman, the Court rejected the argument that

recovery of a voidable tax payment was authorized under

9

106(c) cannot be construed to authorize retroactive

In an opinion written by Mr. Justice

10

monetary relief against the States.

11

concurred in that conclusion on the ground that Congress

12

lacks authority under the bankruptcy clause to subject

13

unconsenting States to retroactive monetary relief.

In this case, the Sixth Circuit declined to

Do you think the requirements for a

clear statement are the same in waiving Federal sovereign

immunity as they are for finding abrogation of a State

I would

1

suggest that there is -- there may well be some difference

2

between the formulation in the Atascadero case of the

3

clear statement rule and the standard for Federal

4

sovereign immunity cited in a case like Ruckelshaus.

I don't think that -- in any event, I don't think that

Congress would have discerned a difference between the two

statements, especially at the time it was drafting the

code.

11

waiving the two forms of immunity.

QUESTION:

Of course, the incompatibility you

14

describe only exists if you assume that the judgment of

15

the court was based upon the rationale of the plurality

16

opinion.

17

judgment of the court is thought to have been based on the

18

rationale of the concurrence.

19

feasible that Congress may -- might want to waive its own

20

sovereign immunity, but does not have the power to waive

21

the sovereign immunity of the States.

strange about that.

There's no incompatibility at all if the

States and then against State entities to the extent

permitted by the Eleventh Amendment.

You can bring a citizen's suit against the United

7

The Congress didn't draw the distinction in this

8

case, even though it recognized that there were

9

limitations on its power with regard to the States.

And I

10

would suggest that the fact that it didn't draw a

11

distinction on the face of the statute, but recognized a

12

limit in terms of its power over the States suggests that

13

it wanted to waive Federal sovereign immunity to the same

14

extent it believed it could abrogate State sovereign

15

immunity.
QUESTION:

16

May I just be clear on what you just

17

said?

18

those other citizen suit provisions, Congress has adopted

19

different standards for the waiver of the Federal

20

sovereign immunity, of the waiver of the Eleventh

21

Amendment?

kinds of sovereigns, in certain cases it will embody in

the statute itself its recognition that maybe some suits

against the Federal Government would be permitted, even

though the same suit wouldn't permitted against the State.

enough.

may evolve in the process of construing such a statute.

What I meant to say was that it's an example of

Mr. Seamon, the lower courts found,

QUESTION:

2

MR. SEAMON:

On what did they base that finding?
They based that finding on a

And yet you don't mention that at all

MR. SEAMON:

We - - I don't believe we state that

We stated that in the petition.

QUESTION:

And --

Well, it seems to me it's critical of

11

the lower court's finding, and I'm a little surprised that

12

you haven't mentioned it in the brief.

13

MR. SEAMON:

Your Honor, we stated that in our

14

petition to make clear all of the issues that were

15

presented at the lower court.

16

petition that we do not at this level dispute the finding

17

below that the transfer was voidable.

18

lower court regarding the notations on the check were part

19

of its holding that the transfer was voidable.

20

is not before the Court, and that's why we didn't raise it

21

in our brief on the merits.

22

And we also stated in our

The findings by the

It is correct that the incompatibility in this

23

case only exists between the result in Hoffman and the

24

result reached by the Sixth Circuit below.

we believe that the plurality in Hoffman construed section

Nonetheless,

relief against Governmental units.

3

to begin by talking about the language of section 106, I

4

would refer the Court to the appendix to our petition at

5

page 57a where section 106 is reprinted.

6

It does not clearly authorize monetary
And because I'm going

Section 106(c), which is the provision at issue

7

here, was added late in the legislative process and in

8

some respects, it is not a model of drafting clarity.

9

Therefore, section 106(c) is best understood in the

10

context of section 106 as a whole.

11

(b) are the provisions that Congress clearly designed to

12

deal comprehensively with the problem of money claims

13

against governmental units.

14

106(a) and (b) use the word claim, which is defined in the

15

code to mean any right to payment.

16

and (b) considered together address all money claims that

17

a trustee may have against the Government, whether they

18

arise under a provision of the code or come from a source

19

outside of the code.

20

Sections 106(a) and

That is clear because section

Thus, section 106(a)

While 106(a) and (b) are quite comprehensive in

21

the sense that they address all money claims, they're

22

quite restrictive in setting forth conditions for

23

recovering the money.

24

only when the Government has filed a claim against the

25

estate, and the estate has a compulsory counterclaim.

106(a) allows affirmative recovery

1

That is a very narrow category of cases that would permit

2

affirmative monetary relief of the sort that was awarded

3

here.

4

106(b) is slightly broader in scope inasmuch as

5

it reaches permissive counterclaims.

6

it limits the kind of relief available.

7

106(b), the trustee can only get an offset of the estate's

8

claim with respect to the Government's claim against the

9

estate.

10

By the same token,
Under section

And as is clear, 106(a) and (b) both apply only

when the Government has filed a claim against the estate.

11

In contrast to 106(a) and (b), section 106(c)

12

contains nothing that is suggestive of monetary relief.

13

It consists of two subparts, both of which must be

14

satisfied for 106(c) to apply.

16

any of over 100 code provisions that contain one of three

17

trigger words that are specified in 106(c)(1).

plurality in Hoffman construed the language of 106(c) as

19

indicative of declaratory relief rather than monetary

20

relief.

21

of the statute, section 106(c) itself, but also when

22

106(c) is contrasted with (a) and (b), whereas (a) and (b)

refer broadly to claims, and clearly indicate that

24

Congress was thinking of monetary relief.

106(c) refers

1

much narrower language than the language of claim used in

2

106(a) and (b).
QUESTION:

3

Well now you make a distinction

4

between the power of the trustee to void a transfer and

5

the power to sue for recovery of money.
MR. SEAMON:

6

Yes.

Is that right?

Because the code itself

7

distinguishes those two concepts by treating -- voiding,

8

having a separate set of voidance provisions from the

9

recovery provision.

10

QUESTION:

11
12

13
14

And the transfer section is section

549?
MR. SEAMON:

Yes, regarding postpetition

transfers like this one.
QUESTION:

And do you think that a transfer

15

could be voided by the court against the Federal

16

Government if none of the trigger words appear in 549?

17

MR. SEAMON:

No, I don't think that's so.

18

think that in this case, the significant provision is

19

section 550, and the fact that section 550 contains a

20

trigger word allows suits to void transfers.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

I

And you think 550 applies even though

none of the trigger words are in 549?
MR. SEAMON:

That's correct.

550 embraces a

24

variety of provisions that regard a voidance of different

25

kinds of transfers.

Postpetition transfers like what

situation, essentially in Whiting Pools, where there was

exactly what 106(c) was designed to do.

MR. SEAMON:

Then I do not think that -They get the suitcase, but not the

MR. SEAMON:

the same kind of problem that arises in the Eleventh

You have Edelman v. Jordan on the one
And in individual

10

cases you need to look at the trustee's claim and say,

11

what is he or she really seeking?

12

retroactive monetary relief?

13

Is it in effect

In general, though, I would say that there will

14

be very few claims that would entail the handing over of

15

money that will be permitted under section 106(c).

16

clearest example would be some sort of specie remedy where

17

you have rare coins and those were seized in a Whiting

18

Pools kind of situation.

1

that indicates that 106(c) is in fact a waiver of

2

sovereign immunity, but doesn't answer the question of the

3

extent to which sovereign immunity has been waived.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. SEAMON:

It's just insufficiently specific.
That's correct.

It suspends the

6

defense of - - the defense of sovereign immunity with

7

respect to whatever relief is authorized under section

8

106(c), but you still need to look at the language

9

following that phrase to determine exactly what is

10
11

authorized.
And the other indication, besides contrasting

12

(c) with (a) and (b), that reinforces the narrow scope of

13

the relief authorized under section 106(c) is that (c)

14

does contain the provision subpart (c)(2).

15

it is improper as the Sixth Circuit suggested here, to

16

look at the provisions that have been triggered to

17

MR. SEAMON:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. SEAMON:

Yes.
-- why this was added?
Yes, to refer to the legislative

6

history, it indicates that 106(c) was added primarily to

7

resolve a conflict among the circuits, and that conflict

8

had to do with the availability of declaratory relief

9

rather than monetary relief.

The floor managers of the

10

legislation referred to a case called Gwilliam which was

11

out of the Ninth Circuit, and the Gwilliam case held that

12

a bankruptcy court could determine whether a tax debt was

13

dischargeable, whether or not the IRS had filed a claim

14

against the estate.

15

There was contrary precedent in the Fifth

16

Circuit, and so 106(c) essentially codifies the holding in

17

Gwilliam so that even when a governmental unit has not

18

filed a claim against the estate and brought itself within

19

(a) and (b), it is still subject to declarations by the

20

court, the bankruptcy court, that have to do with the

21

Government's rights in the property of the estate.

22

So to the extent that Gwilliam is codified,

23

Congress -- the legislative history suggests -- also

24

intended to allow binding determinations on matters in

25

addition to tax debts.

Thus, under the rationale of the

way that section 106(c) operates is that the Government is

chapters contain a trigger word.

QUESTION:

Mr. Seamon, do you have any idea how

it occurred to anybody to draft (c)(1) that way?

instead of just mentioning the sections, pick out a couple

like that?

10

Why would that occur to anybody to do something
It's almost like a game.
MR. SEAMON:

8

I mean,

It's part of -- it stems from the

fact that 106(c) was added after all of the rest of the
code had been drafted.
QUESTION:

11

No, but I mean why wouldn't you just

12

name the sections instead of, you know, saying a provision

13

that contains these, what you called trigger words.

14

MR. SEAMON:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

It may well be - I've never seen a provision like

that.
MR. SEAMON:

Nor have I.

And it may well be

18

that it is a product of haste or that in fact there are a

19

fairly lengthy list of provisions that include one of

20

these three trigger words.

21

22

are triggered, there doesn't seem to be any rigorous logic

23

between what was included and what was excluded.

24

again, I would suggest that there was -- to the extent

25

that it was logical, there was a broader kind of logic

I think there are something

When you look at what provisions

And

1

going on that Congress started with the Gwilliam case that

2

concerned declaratory relief in the tax area, and thought

3

it would be a good idea to generalize that holding so that

4

declaratory relief was available in other areas where the

5

Government had not filed a claim against the estate, and

6

thereby brought itself under (a) and (b).

7

You had this conflict in the circuits out there

8

that it wanted to resolve.

9

considered what sorts of kind of major actors in the code

10

would cover declaratory relief of the sort that it had in

11

mind.

12

And while it was at it, it

I think the only other thing that one can say

13

about what the choice of the trigger words was is that the

14

selection of governmental unit as a trigger word is

15

significant in as much as it suggests that where Congress

16

used the term governmental unit elsewhere in the code, it

17

wasn't thinking about waiving sovereign immunity.

18

to go back after the fact and add it as a trigger word.

19

That is important inasmuch as, you know, likewise in the

20

trigger provisions that address monetary recovery, there

21

too, Congress was not thinking about sovereign immunity.

22

And that is another reason why it is inappropriate to look

23

to the trigger provisions to determine what kind of relief

24

is authorized.

that Congress would rationally have wanted to subject the

think it is a situation where Congress chose entity with

the idea of having particular provisions apply.

In any event, it is hard to figure out the logic

of the way section 106(c) is drafted.

about it with confidence is that it does not clearly speak

to the issue of monetary recovery.

sovereign immunity and the question of waiver/nonwaiver.

2

The plurality and the dissent -- plurality and dissenting

opinions of this Court in the Hoffman case appear to agree

that 106(c) of the Bankruptcy Code was a waiver of

The answer lies partly in the fact that when you read

5

A governmental unit is deemed to have waived

11

Interesting, if we read 106(a) and don't

recognize that the word claim is being used in two

different senses, we come to the conclusion that maybe the

14

Government doesn't have to file a proof of claim for a

16

every case I've read -- which is why I focus on the dual

the structure of 106(b) is it deals with an allowed claim.

2

There shall be offset against an allowed claim or

3

interest.

4

106 is as significant and applicable in Chapters 9 and

5

Chapter 11 as it is in Chapter 7 -- if the creditor is

6

scheduled by the debtor for the correct amount and is not

7

scheduled as being disputed, unliquidated, then in that

8

event under bankruptcy rule 3003(b)(1), and section 502 of

9

the Bankruptcy Code, that creditor's claim is deemed

10
11

Under the provisions of Chapters 9 and 11, and

filed, and if not objected to, will be allowed.
If we now look at 106(b), if that creditor has a

12

deemed allowed, deemed filed claim in a Chapter 9 or 11,

13

and it would be more frequently an 11 than a 9 -- there

14

are very few 9's -- and if we did not have 106(b), and if

15

we look at 502(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, a creditor who

16

received a preference, or voidable transfer who does not

17

restore it, their claim shall be disallowed.

18

bankruptcy court determined that a governmental agency or

19

unit got a preference, the total claim could be

20

disallowed.

21

governmental unit's proof of claim were $50 million, the

22

failure to return the $5 would be a basis of disallowance

23

of the $50 million claim.

is the correct reading would be to recognize that 106(c)

is a waiver of sovereign immunity wherever the trigger

Taken collectively, it means (c) was the

intent - - which goes right back to where we were with the

Bankruptcy Commission -- of the broad waiver.

14

Additionally, since it is the Federal Government whom we

15

are claiming has waived sovereign immunity, and Congress

16

has passed the Bankruptcy Code, that waiver does not have

17

to meet the Atascadero standard.

18

It is here.

19

It is a simple waiver.

In substance, the waiver by Congress in 106(c)

20

is a sufficient waiver of the Federal Government's

sovereign immunity, if there is sovereign immunity under
