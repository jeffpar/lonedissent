ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD LYNN DUCOTE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. DUCOTE:

11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

12

the Court, I represent two young girls, ohe 9 and one 7,

13

who come before you through their mother as their next

14

friend.

15

awarded full custody, and during the court-ordered

16

visitation they were physically and sexually molested by

17

their father and his girlfriend.

Their parents were divorced and their mother was

18

Because of the abuse, the Jefferson Parish,

19

Louisiana Juvenile Court through its child protection

20

statutes permanently terminated all the parental rights of

21

the father and permanently enjoined him from having any

22

contact whatsoever with the children again.

23

under State law he is a legal stranger to them.

24

decision was never appealed and is final.

25

Therefore,
That

After that decision, the children filed suit

against their father and his girlfriend in t.ort, in

2

Federal court in Louisiana, under diversity of

3

citizenship, because they were no longer residing in the

4

same State.

5

The district court in the Fifth Circuit through

6

the case out saying what this really is is a domestic

7

relations case over which the Federal courts have no

8

jurisdiction.

9

I think it's first important to note what ‘this

10

case is not.

11

Federal cause of action.

12

the concerns expressed by the Chief Justi'ce and other

13

Members of this Court about creating new Federal causes of

14

action such as the actions now pending before Congress

15

concerning making all crimes against women perhaps civil

16

rights actions which could be brought in Federal courts,

17

or against making all crimes committed with handguns

18

Federal offenses.

19

This case is not about establishing a new
This case has nothing to do with

There's no question, and it's never been

20

contested in this case, that all of the elements of

21

diversity have been satisfied.

22

QUESTION:

Well, we could go further, could we

23

not, Mr. Ducote, in saying what the case is not about, in

24

saying that it is not about a decree of divorce, it is not

25

about child custody, it's not about probate -- something

1

like that?
MR. DUCOTE:

2

That's correct.

It's a simple

3

diversity tort action.

4

is a State and a local cause of action, just as this case

5

is.

6

father by an automobile they would have Federal relief.

7

Every tort action under diversity

If these children had been, say, run over by their

If they had been sexually molested, say, by

8

their minister or by their schoolteacher, they would have

9

a Federal forum.

Perhaps -- and it's not clear under the

10

Fifth Circuit's test where the line would be drawn, but

11

perhaps if it had been an uncle --an uncle or an aunt or

12

a first cousin who had molested them, they'd also be able

13

to sue in Federal court under diversity of jurisdiction.

14

Why is it, then, that the Federal courts can

15

abstain or simply refuse to hear a case because it's the

16

father who's involved, and I submit that they can't.

17

don't believe that the test of Federal jurisdiction is

18

whether or not we want to get involved, when the Federal

19

courts say I don't want to get involved because it sounds

20

too much like a family matter.

21

QUESTION:

I

The real question here --

Well, but you -- in your earlier

22

answers to the chief justice you seem to be saying that

23

well, if it were a family matter, that would be a

24

different question.

25

As I understand, your position is if it were

1

probate, if it were any traditional family matter, there

2

would still be no basis for the Federal court staying out,

3

right?

4

MR. DUCOTE:

Well, one of the questions the

5

court asked is whether or not there is a Federal - - a

6

domestic relations exception to Federal jurisdiction.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. DUCOTE:

That's right.
My position is that if the

9

diversity criteria are met and the amount in controversy

10

exceeds the $50,000 threshold, no matter what the source

11

of the money is, it should be within Federal jurisdiction

12

unless Congress determines‘otherwise.
QUESTION:

13
14
15

So you can sue in Federal court for

divorce.
MR. DUCOTE:

Well, I don't believe so, because

16

divorce itself has no $50,000 threshold, nor does child

17

custody, nor does child visitation.

18

is money, then yes, if the $50,000 threshold is met and

19

the diversity criteria are met, the Federal courts have

20

jurisdiction until Congress says otherwise.

21

QUESTION:

If what is sued for

Well, what if a husband sues for a

22

divorce and requests a property settlement agreement,

23

saying that the amount of controversy, our property,

24

amounts to several hundred thousand dollars.

25

meet the jurisdictional amount for diversity?

Would that

1

MR. DUCOTE:

Unfortunately, at this point, given

2

the fact that the Federal jurisdiction is defined by

3

Congress and Congress is not exempted, that sort of

4

question from the diversity of jurisdiction, I think to be

5

true to the Constitution, yes, the Federal courts would

6

have jurisdiction.

7

QUESTION:

We really don't have to decide that

8

question, do we, to rule in your favor?

9

domestic relations exception which embraced divorce, child

10

There could be a

custody, and still did not extend as far as your case.

11

MR. DUCOTE:

12

QUESTION:

That's absolutely correct.
What about a suit for the partition

13

of real estate in another State?

14

divorce, has been considered traditionally a nontransitory

15

cause of action, so you had to sue within the State where

16

the property was.

17

you couldn't get it, but your position is you can sue in

18

any Federal court for it.

19

I mean, that, like

If you sued in another State's courts

MR. DUCOTE:

My position is that if the

20

diversity criteria are met and the amount in controversy

21

exceeds $50,000 and the State law that's applicable in the

22

jurisdiction where the Federal court sits allows for that

23

cause of action, the Federal courts under Article 3 and

24

the congressional mandate under 28 U.S.C. section 1332

25

says that you have jurisdiction.

1

QUESTION:

Don't you think that that

2

congressional mandate took into account accepted notions

3

of transitory causes of action and nontransitory causes of

4

action so that it was entirely understood that to get a

5

divorce you could only sue in the court of the State where

6

the people are resident?

7

MR. DUCOTE:

I think first you have to look at

8

the State law, and whatever the State where the forum sits

9

says about what can be done with property that another

10
11

State would control.
Unfortunately, and as all of the Law Review

12

articles and Judge Weinstein in the Spind'el case point

13

out, most of what the courts have said about the domestic

14

relations exception have been on very weak grounding, that

15

these things about well, ecclesiastical courts used to do

16

this, and courts of equity didn't do this and all, just

17

don't apply, and I think with the position, unfortunately,

18

where we have to look at what the Constitution says about

19

who decides what Federal courts have jurisdiction over and

20

return the responsibility to Congress to sort through the

21

problems that you're suggesting, I think as a matter of

22

principle if the Federal courts can simply define their

23

own jurisdictional boundaries we just have all sorts of --

24
25

QUESTION:

They're not defining their own.

They're just assuming that the congressional grant of

1

jurisdiction, if not the constitutional grant of

2

jurisdiction, took into account ordinary notions of

3

nontransitory causes of action that could only be brought

4

in certain courts.

5

What about criminal jurisdiction?

Can Federal

6

courts try for State crimes?

7

that no sovereign enforces the criminal laws of another

8

sovereign.
MR. DUCOTE:

9

QUESTION:

10

11

The traditional notion is

I agree.
Can a State attorney bring in Federal

court a prosecution for a State crime?
MR. DUCOTE:

12

No, but in the diversity cases --

13

and that's the unique nature of diversity jurisdiction --

14

diversity jurisdiction specifically deals with local

15

causes of action, local concerns, and simply says that

16

because of this -- in the Bullone case it's expressed, the

17

concern about local prejudice, and then the -- sort of the

18

equal footing that nonState parties should have in that

19

court, that the Federal courts should have diversity of

20

jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

21

In some of our cases, Mr. Ducote,

22

we've said that when Congress enacts a jurisdictional

23

measure it takes it with knowledge of any judicial gloss

24

on it, so to speak, such as Canon v. University of

25

Chicago.

Now, this Court has been speaking about domestic

1
2

relations exceptions to diversity jurisdiction since the

3

turn of the century, and the Congress has revisited the

4

diversity statute several times and never made any

5

addition to it indicating that it disapproved of that

6

exception.

7

little bit two-dimensional when you simply say well, we

8

just look at the statute?

9

Doesn't that suggest that your analysis is a

MR. DUCOTE:

Well, the Court -- the last

10

pronouncement was in the 1930's on the domestic relations

11

exception, except for Thompson v. Thompson in 1988, when

12

in a footnote the Court talked about the tradition of the

13

domestic relations exception, and what I'm saying -- and

14

again, I don't think this is essential for us to prevail

15

in this cause of action, but I think what we have to do is

16

sort of pull that all back together and make some sense

17

out of it and get back to the issue that Congress needs to

18

set out what the parameters of Federal jurisdiction are

19

and what are the exceptions.

20

And I think Congress did an excellent job of

21

that in 1990 in the supplemental jurisdiction provision

22

under 28 U.S.C. 1367, where the Court said -- Congress

23

said the Federal courts can have supplemental jurisdiction

24

if this criteria is met, this criteria, and they may

25

choose to decline supplemental jurisdiction if State law
10

1

is uncertain or the issues are too complicated or for

2

other good reasons.

3

So in that case, Congress specifically-

4

authorized an abstention, if you would, from jurisdiction,

5

and I think that's really what we need to do so this

6

doesn't spread further and --

7

QUESTION:

8

Is there any suggestion that that was

done in the light of this Court's statement about the
domestic relations exception?
MR. DUCOTE:

10

I think it had to do with perhaps

11

some of the other abstention doctrines, Younger v.

12

Colorado Water District, but I think if we're going to

13

have exceptions to Federal jurisdiction, or we're going to

14

allow for abstention of Federal jurisdiction, then I think

15

it should be by congressional mandate and not by judicial

16

activism.

17

QUESTION:

Well, but these cases, speaking of

18

the domestic relations exception, have been on the

1

books -- our books for a long time.

20

should overrule them?

21

MR. DUCOTE:

22

23

Are you saying we

The specific issue in this case has

never been addressed by the Court.
QUESTION:

Absolutely right, and one could

24

easily say that those cases referred to things like

25

seeking a decree of divorce, child custody, other
11

1

nontransitory causes of action, and that therefore your

2

case is not governed by them, but when you get into the

3

more general area, it seems to me you're arguing for just

4

a rather sweeping clearing of the brush, so to speak,

5

which I'm not sure isn't inconsistent with all our cases.
MR. DUCOTE:

6

Well, I think the cases of Burrus

7

and Barber and Popovici and De La Rama v. De La Rama have

8

simply said in very broad brush strokes the relations

9

between husband and wife, parent and child, belong to the

10

States and we're not going to get involved in it, and

11

those cases have sort of set up judicial chaos for 100

12

years in all of the circuits that have led to this sort of

13

decision.

14

The fact that in 1991 a Federal district court

15

can look at sexual abuse, a sexual abuse tort action and

16

say that well, this is domestic relations under -- citing

17

Barber v. Barber in 19 -- I'm sorry, 1880, shows the

18

extent to which this issue is still uncertain.

19

So I think yes, it -- again, the principle is

20

important that either Congress sets up the parameters of

21

Federal jurisdiction or the courts do on an ad hoc basis,

22

and that's the concern, but I don't think that's the most

23

important issue here, because these kids should be able to

24

sue in tort no matter who the defendant is if there's a

25

cognizable State cause of action and the other criteria of
12

1

the diversity statute have been met.

2

The other issue is the Younger abstention issue.

3

QUESTION:

Counsel, before you get to that

4

point, suppose that in this case the mother was involved

5

in the proceedings in the Louisiana domestic court and the

6

court made findings of fact that the abuse had not

7

occurred?

8

issue preclusion in the suit that you're bringing now.

9

I take it that that would have operated as

MR. DUCOTE:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. DUCOTE:

12

Under Louisiana law it would not.
It would not.
Louisiana probably has the most

restrictive issue preclusion statutes in the country.

13

QUESTION:

*

I think that in other States it

14

would, although I'm not sure of that, and if that's so

15

then my next question would be if there would be issue

16

preclusion going back the other way, if the tort were

17

tried first, I assume it would not be a violation of due

18

process at least for a domestic court, say, that this has

19

already been litigated and it's going to accept those

20

findings.

21

MR. DUCOTE:

I don't think so.

You know, very

22

often in other contexts, for example in police brutality

23

cases, it's not unusual for there to be State court

24

proceedings and Federal court proceedings in the

25

prosecution as well as administratively in any number of
13

areas, so I think the law should not -- or the rules of
the game should not change simply because we're dealing
with children or because we're dealing with sexual abuse
and we're dealing with families.
I think one of the things that's happened in the
courts is this issue is something that people haven't
wanted to get involved in, and they've looked for a way to
sort of get rid of it, and I think in another context,
were it not a family context, those questions wouldn't
even be raised.
And that's sort of what the district court does
with the Younger issue and says well, you' know, the State
court permanently terminated this man's rights, therefore
the State's interest in this case is obviously even more
compelling than it would be in another case, and that's
even more cause for us to keep out of it.
And I look at it and I say because his rights
were terminated, if you apply the Younger rules the
State's already finished with the case.

The man is a

legal stranger, so it's even more compelling it should be
in Federal court.
So again I think the rules have to be
clarified -- family, no family, whatever.

If it meets the

criteria of the statute, unless Congress exempts it it
should be adjudicated.

As has this Court said in Deakins
14

v. Monaghan, the Federal courts have an unflagging duty to

2

adjudicate cases that are properly in their jurisdiction.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

Mr. Ducote, was there any equitable

relief sought in this case?
MR. DUCOTE:

Absolutely none.

It was

%

6

7

straightforward tort action for compensation.
QUESTION:

It might be a different case if there

8

were equitable relief.

I mean, would you have any problem

9

with the Federal court using its power to decline to

10

exercise equitable jurisdiction on the basis that family

11

law matters, even more broadly than divorce and status and

12

affiliation and so forth, shouldn't be addressed by

13

Federal courts?

14

MR. DUCOTE:

I have no problem with that, and as

15

Justice Kennedy discussed in the case of McIntyre v.

16

McIntyre in the Ninth Circuit, when issues of status are

17

not involved and the court - - the Federal court has not

18

asked to impinge on the State supervision of a minor and

19

it's just simply an issue of compensatory damages, it's

20

like every other case, and again we just can't simply say

21

well, this is family business and we don't like to be

22

involved in family business that --

23

QUESTION:

Counsel, I'm interested from a

24

practical point of view.

25

you of a Federal court in Louisiana?

What is the great attraction for

MR. DUCOTE:

1

Well, I think there are two points.

2

One is that the Federal .Rules of Evidence, because of not

3

only the rules themselves but because of Federal court

4

decisions in child sexual abuse cases, provide a better

5

opportunity for the evidence that is available in this

6

case to be presented to a jury.

7

The second question is the fact that one of the

8

respondents is an attorney in this case who practices in

9

the local State court where the case would have to be

10

brought.

11

are the underpinnings of diversity jurisdiction.

12

These are the traditional sort of concerns that

We think that these out-of-Stat'e plaintiffs

13

having to go into a State court where one of the

14

respondents is a practicing attorney might not receive as

15

fair a shake as they would in the Federal court.

16
17
18
19

And if there are no other questions I would
reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Ducote.

Mr.

Weidenfeld, we'll hear from you.

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. WEIDENFELD:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The first issue here is whether or not there is
a domestic relations abstention to Federal court

jurisdiction.

This Court since 1859 in Barber has stated

that there is one.
QUESTION:
abstention.

Mr. Weidenfeld, you just use the word

Did you mean exception?

MR. WEIDENFELD:

I did.

I did, Your Honor --

Mr. Chief Justice, excuse me.
Is there an exception to Federal jurisdiction
for domestic relations?

This Court has said since 1859

there is such an exception to jurisdiction.
1859 to 1930, 71 years passed.

There were three

intervening cases which reaffirmed that doctrine, and in
1930 Justice Holmes reaffirmed it yet again, allowing that
doctrine to defeat the original jurisdiction of the
Federal courts in matters involving consoles, and that was
of course Papovici v. Agler.
QUESTION:

Of course, that general proposition

doesn't give us the answer to this case, yet.
MR. WEIDENFELD:

No, it doesn't Your Honor, but

of course this Court has asked to address that issue, at
least in brief, and I think that as a matter -- it has to
be accepted that there is a domestic relations exception
to jurisdiction.

Either there is or there is not, and I

suggest that there is, that Congress has had 130-some-odd
years, 13 separate terms, to modify it, abolish it, do
something to it, and they've never taken the opportunity

QUESTION:

Mr. Weidenfeld, do you think the

3

exception which you would have us continue to recognize is

4

based on the Constitution, or is it something statutory?

5

Can Congress change it?

6

MR. WEIDENFELD:

I think that the exception goes

7

back to the concept of the Tenth Amendment in that it

8

actually was a matter not delegated to the Federal

9

Government.

I think that the common understanding, as

10

Justice Holmes said, was that domestic matters are matters

11

unique to the States and belong to the States.

12

QUESTION:

So you don't think Congress could

13

directly address this, and for instance in the parental

14

kidnapping case direct Federal courts to have jurisdiction

15

of certain family related matters?

16

MR. WEIDENFELD:

The common understanding at the

17

time was that matters domestic -- that is, matters

18

involving parent and child, husband and wife, were

19

excluded from the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in

20

that --

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

Would you answer, though, the

22

question I asked?

Do you think Congress can enact laws

23

such as the parental kidnapping case and give Federal

24

courts jurisdiction over matters that do relate, in a

25

sense, to family matters?

QUESTION:

14

we're really talking about abstention rather than

2

exception, so to speak, to diversity jurisdiction.

3

MR. WEIDENFELD:

Well, the -- the broader

4

concepts I think lead to the same place.

5

concepts are the interrelationship between the Federal

6

Government and the State governments, so that gets to the

7

same place, but this Court has spoken about domestic

8

relations as an exception itself to jurisdiction, so the

9

question is what makes it domestic?

10

The broader

If it is a matter reserved to the State, what

11

makes it domestic, and my answer is that you have to look

12

to the States and have the States created' -- and do the

13

States give us guidance, and they do.

14

QUESTION:

Well, isn't it dangerous to read into

15

the Constitution what isn't there, to wit, a domestic

16

relations exception to Federal jurisdiction, and aren't we

17

on sounder ground if we were talking about abstention, as

18

maybe the Court should have done over the years?

19

MR. WEIDENFELD:

20

read things into the Constitution.

21

Court has decided, or at least has held, that it is

22

jurisdictional, and Congress has never decided to take

23

that position on.

1

can do, but the object is that if it is abstention --

2

whether it's abstention or jurisdiction, although this

3

Court calls it jurisdictional, we have to get to how do we

4

define what a domestic matter is?

5

The States have defined what domestic matters

6

are.

The States have significant rules that abridge the

7

rights of individuals to sue within the family unit.

8

Fathers cannot sue their wives, cannot sue mothers.

9

Children cannot sue their parents.

It *was incorrect for

10

counsel to say that had John Richards run over his

11

daughter, she could have sued him in State or Federal --

12

in Federal court because he was her father, if it happened

13

while he was her father.

14

QUESTION:

But that really is a question of what

15

law is applicable, isn't it, rather than whether there's

16

jurisdiction?

17

presumably the same result will obtain on the merits no

18

matter whether it's in the State court or in the Federal

19

district court?

I mean, if that is the rule in Louisiana,

MR. WEIDENFELD:

20

That's correct, Your Honor, my

21

point being that the States have - - that each State has

22

its own set of rules involving parent -- the domestic

23

harmony, and the results that involve the

24

interrelationship between spouses and between parents and

25

children.

it doesn't make it jurisdictional, does it?
MR. WEIDENFELD:

Well, by this Court's phrasing

6

of the --by this Court's prior determinations that

7

domestic matters are jurisdictional, the question that

8

leads to is, is it a domestic matter, and how do we decide

9

if something involves the domestic relations.

That's how

10

it seems to come to me, and when you're deciding is

11

something a domestic matter or not, you have to see it's

12

going to be the same considerations as in< an argument that

involves comity, that involves Younger v. --

QUESTION:

So you think it's -- your criterion

of what is domestic looks to the State law of capacity, is

MR. WEIDENFELD:

I'm saying that's a factor.

between suits between spouses and suits between children.

In fact, the common law I think until this century did not

The State represents the children, and often

QUESTION:

In another sense that doesn't help

you, though, because if the Federal court enters a

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Well, couldn't -- are you agreeing

that you could not claim collateral estoppal, an offensive

MR. WEIDENFELD:

That there'd b'e no collateral

QUESTION:

No, the other way around.

effect running from the State proceeding binding on the

this matter, I'm going to hop over into the United States

friendlier -- I perceive myself to having a friendlier

forum there.

9

and so I get to redo the whole case, which you wouldn't be

A party loses in

I have more favorable laws, as is suggested,

able to do in the State court.
QUESTION:

11

But Mr. Weidenfeld, there are a lot

12

of tort actions that could have an effect' on a custody

13

decree.

14

I mean, a tort action by a total stranger

15

against the mother who has been given custody on the

16

ground that she was a drunken driver and injured -- or on

17

the ground that she was violent and whipped the

18

plaintiff's child, I mean, that would be an indication in

19

the State courts, wouldn't it, of the mother's incapacity

20

or unsuitability to have custody of the child?

21

Now, is that tort suit to be disallowed in

22

Federal courts as well because it might have a collateral

23

estoppal effect on the State custody proceeding?

24
25

MR. WEIDENFELD:

No.

My test is whether or not

it occurred during the existence of the marriage and it

2

Well, I know that's your test because

3

it fits your case, but I don't know why the one is any

4

more logical than the other.

6

MR. WEIDENFELD:

Well, the State has no interest

or no involvement in the other, per se.

7

I know that this Court has never extended

8

Younger to a diversity case and -- but I suggest that the

9

State interests are the same as in a diversity case, and

10

the Federal interests if anything have decreased.
QUESTION:

11

But for Younger, even in the criminal

12

context there has to be a pending proceeding, doesn't

13

there, a pending, proceeding in the State court?

14

MR. WEIDENFELD:

There does, and I think that

15

the pending proceeding is the -- and this is a stretch

16

which I admit, but the pending nature of the proceeding is

17

that custody is always pending, is always on-going,

18

because the State's interest never ends.

that the State -- that the Federal court in this instance

is not to be used by disgruntled litigants.

It's a three-edged sort of triangle -- mother,

that once it's -- once it is Jon Richards, if that -- if

I would only close by saying that there needs to

be some way to determine what is a matter that is

goes to the discretion of the court, of the trial court.

They're in the best position to make that determination,

and that Judge Arceneaux in this instance did not abuse

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD LYNN DUCOTE

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14
15

MR. DUCOTE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

16

I think there are a number of situations where a

17

State court action can result in a Federal -- or the facts

18

that result in a State court action can result in a

1

Federal action, and we don't have all of this fear.

20

example, you can have a criminal conviction in State court

21

and then a tort action among the same players, the

22

perpetrator and the victim, and if there's a decision in

23

the Federal court action based on diversity that is

24

contrary to the State court criminal proceeding it's no

25

basis to go back and reopen the criminal court proceeding.

QUESTION:

MR. DUCOTE:

That's it.

The case is

He could never get custody back.
He would have no right of action

under State law because he's a legal stranger to the

8

children.

9

The case is over and done with.
Now, people can go into domestic court on all

10

sorts of reasons and try to reopen cases.

The fact that

11

people can attempt to do things doesn't mean that the

jurisdiction should then tremble and say well, you know,

MR. DUCOTE:

1

Well, commencing about the 1970's

2

virtually every State has enacted termination of parental

3

rights statutes because of the child abuse problem.

4

denial of custody is different than what happened here.

This is a permanent termination of all parental rights,

meaning he doesn't even have the right as another parent

would to come in and seek custody.

Would you be here making the same

argument if instead custody had been awarded to the mother

12

but no termination of parental rights?

think that the Federal courts should entertain the tort

action?

MR. DUCOTE:

Certainly.

Would you still

any bearing.

review because his parental rights were terminated, but I

18

don't think that in and of itself has any bearing because,

19

as Justice Blackmun questioned, is this an exception, or

20

is it abstention, and if it's going to be abstention, then

21

it has to be one of the abstentions that the Court has

recognized -- Younger, but again doesn't apply because

there are no pending State actions.
