ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TRIBE:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Although the substance of this case focuses on

12

fair warning to consumers, at a structural level the case

13

is really about fair warning to the 50 States.

14

The premise of their ability to defend their

15

interests in the national legislative process is, of

16

course, that they be, clearly, warned of what they are

17

about to lose as Congress considers a new statute.

18

The Cigarette Labeling Act undoubtedly warned

1

the states that with respect to three specific areas --

20

cigarette package labels, cigarette advertisements, and

21

cigarette promotions -- the States were about to lose the

22

authority to tell the cigarette companies what health

23

messages they must include, once those companies had put

24

the Surgeon General's warning on their package labels.

25

But if the Third Circuit is upheld and

1

respondents prevail here, the States will end up having

2

lost considerably more than that, because affixing the

3

Surgeon General's warning to a cigarette companies'

4

packages would absolve that company, prospectively, of any

5

legally enforceable duty, regardless of how longstanding

6

or broadly applicable that duty might be, in the context

7

of that company's communications with the public about

8

smoking and health.

9

Now in that context, the placement of the

10

Surgeon General's warning on all of the company's

11

cigarette packages becomes an iron-clad guarantee that, as

12

far as the 50 States are concerned, the company can do no

13

wrong.

14

promises, no State can make that company compensate its

15

victims providing the deception involves smoking and

16

health.

17

That is if it should deliberately lie or break its

If the company should suddenly discover some new

18

health information that a similarly situated manufacturer

19

of another product would be duly bound under the

20

background law of the States in some way to communicate to

21

its buyers or to bystanders who are at risk, no State can

22

pressure this cigarette company to communicate that

23

information or to make it compensate those who are hurt

24

because it chooses not to.

25

Now it is, of course, possible but I think quite

remarkable for Congress to take quite that much authority

very important and quite effective, but this result, if

correct, treats them as though they were almost a rather

11

Now, let me say very clearly at the outset, the

12

fact that Congress probably -- I say probably because I'm

13

no mind reader - - was not thinking in terms of preempting

14

damage actions, as such, is not decisive and I do not

15

intend to rely on it.

16

court damage actions are simply beyond the reach of this

17

labeling act just because the act's invocation in the

18

context of a damage action might surprise some of those

19

who drafted it or voted on it. _

1

duties not to deceive and then turn to duties to warn.

2

With respect to deception -- broken promises, conspiracy

3

to mislead by neutralizing -- the active wrongs as opposed

4

to the omissions -- the issue arises, of course, in part

5

because cigarette companies have so many avenues of

6

communication besides just the package.

7

to deceive people on the package, although I suppose it

8

can be done.

9

It's rather hard

They have advertisements, which are subject to

10

the act's warning requirements, including, as of 1984,

11

Congress' own four rotating warnings.

12

promotions, which they have maintained are not subject to

13

the warning requirements.

14

that seems to be the current state of the law.

15

what they call advertorials, opinion pieces, where they

16

communicate to the public and do not place the warnings.

17

And they have

It's a little ambiguous, but
They have

One thing I should call to the Court's

18

attention, which I think escaped me the first few times I

19

read the statute, is that failure to comply with the

20

Federal warning requirements as to the advertisements is a

21

misdemeanor, a $10,000 fine, but it does not prevent the

22

preemption provision of section 5 from kicking in.

23

provision is triggered by compliance with the requirements

24

with respect to the package.

So the issue becomes could Congress have meant,

could it have said, does this language say, that once you

2

have stamped the proper warning on the package, you are

3

home free with regard to deliberate torts like lying about

4

smoking and health.

that's clear.

QUESTION:

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

Well, certainly not in 1965.

I think

Mr. Tribe?
Yes.
When you say lying about smoking and

health, you're not then referring just to the general sort

10

of misrepresentation, which I think doesn't ordinarily

11

require actual lying.

12

specific?

13

MR. TRIBE:

You're referring to something more

No, actually Mr. Chief Justice, I

14

would refer to anything positive that would otherwise

15

violate the background law of torts.

16

might be required or even none -- that is, if it a false

17

statement and meets the State's requirement with respect

18

to whatever the state of mind is, then, in 1965, the

19

question I think one would ask is, look at the

20

language - QUESTION:

21
22

25

Well, then, but your use of the word

lying, then, is somewhat hyperbolic.

MR. TRIBE:

I don't mean, Mr. Chief Justice, to

do that.

You don't mean lying.

Of course, as we know from the Fifth Amendment

There is no conflict between section 5 in any

20

sense that arises from the fact that all 50 States, and I

21

now continue to speak of it just as it was in 1965, that

22

all 50 States have concurrent authority to say, if you

So it is curious that the Third Circuit,

nonetheless, held and that the respondents, as I

understand it, in this Court agree, that effective January

9

including deliberately false statements, is preempted.

What I want to do is try to figure out how they got there.
QUESTION:

I suppose that depends to some

extent, doesn't it, upon whether the falsity consists of

an omission.

with that.

Now, I

That is, if the 1965 law, in its text, will not

Does it make it easier or harder?
I think it makes it a little easier.

If it always were the way it is in the new version?
MR. TRIBE:

Well, in the new version, with

QUESTION:

I mean, when one changes from a

that the change made a difference?
MR. TRIBE:

1

In theory, I'm prepared to assume

20

that it may have made a difference, but what I'm

21

interested in establishing is that whatever difference it

might have made does not establish that liability for

important, and this is the second step in their argument,

2

to say that they make really nothing significant of the

3

language based on smoking and health.

4

rewrite the text so that effectively it preempts not

5

requirements or prohibitions based on smoking and health,

6

but requirements or prohibitions having some impact on

7

smoking and health or triggered in the particular case by

8

a relation between smoking and health.

9

That is, they

Now, the prohibition against making

10

misstatements, it seems pretty plain to me, is grounded

11

in, rooted in, based on something rather broader and more

12

general than smoking and health.

universal:

14

starters.

15

Although there are questions of much scienter, as the

16

Chief Justice points out, might be required.

17

Its roots are far more

the Ten Commandments and the Koran, for
The law of virtually every jurisdiction.

But this prohibition is based on a society-wide

18

norm, the prohibition against making misstatements.

19

the reason I stress this as particularly significant in

20

the context of this act, is that making that shift in the

21

statute, apart from a general aversion that I have to

22

rewriting other people's work, I think has a problem.

23

problem is that it involves an attempt by the industry to

24

persuade the Federal judiciary to give it something that

25

the Congress was never asked to give it.

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, it seems to me that at the

2

most general level, it's not based on smoking and health,

3

it's based upon the Ten Commandments or the Koran:

5

on smoking or health, isn't it?

6

people

But at a more specific level, it's based

I mean, that is to say, in this area of smoking

7

and health, since in fact cigarettes are harmful to you,

8

it amounts to a misrepresentation because they - -

9

cigarettes are harmful to you, to show people having a

10

good time smoking without any thought of the harmfulness.

11

Now isn't that specific prohibition at a more specific

12

level, based on smoking and health?

13

MR. TRIBE:

The prohibition, I think, has a

14

different route or basis, but I fully agree that the

15

reason that it comes into play here is because of

16

empirical things in the world about smoking and health.

17

QUESTION:

So it depends upon at what -- how

18

general a level you want to consider the "based on"

19

language here.

20

MR. TRIBE:

Well, but it does modify the word

21

requirement or prohibition.

22

State should at least have the authority, if it is a

23

general prohibition and if it's not peculiar to this

24

industry, to have some say in the level of generality.

Coleman, who was then the industry's chief spokesman in

July 22d, page 80 cigarette advertising shouldn't be the

altogether differently.

argument, your emphasis on the "based on smoking and

of the case, or is that also applied to the omission?

MR. TRIBE:

Well, with respect to express

MR. TRIBE:

about deception, and then let me turn immediately to the

QUESTION:

Before you do that, before we get too

5

far away from the based on, if I am uncertain whether

6

based on smoking and health refers to the general Ten

7

Commandments level or the more specific level, why

8

wouldn't I look to the congressional declaration of policy

9

and purpose, section 1331, which doesn't use the "based

10

on" language, but speaks much more broadly, saying that it

11

is the policy of Congress to deal with cigarette labeling

12

and advertising with respect to any relationship between

13

smoking and health?

14

Now, to be faithful to that purpose, it seems to

15

me I ought to read the "based on" language at a more

16

specific level rather than a general level.

17

MR. TRIBE:

But if you were to continue, Justice

18

Scalia, with the rest of the preamble, it makes it clear

19

that the purpose is that there not be diverse, nonuniform,

20

and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising

regulations.

QUESTION:

Do you think that a suit on duty to

warn could have been successful, generally, in the various

states at the time this act was originally passed?

MR. TRIBE:

Only under some fairly stringent

that would trigger the duty.

Even now it's hard to bring these suits,

And indeed, the main point I want to make,
initially, about the duty to warn, is that though it's

grown new branches, even now it hasn't grown a branch that

In a suit unfair to warn, could the

MR. TRIBE:

I certainly think so, Justice

they could ask for an instruction to make sure that the

law is not violated, that the jury will not penalize them

for the fact that in the specific places designated in the

I think that

I do think, and that I think is a response in

principally because, as a realistic matter, very few

should do is put it in the middle of your advertising.

11

I think a very good example is what happened

when Johnson & Johnson discovered that there was some

That is, when

2

the way in which duty to warn cases usually arise.

3

usually arise, as the National Association of

4

Manufacturers' brief on the respondents' side of the case

pointed out, they usually arise in the context of a

complaint that a rather ample package didn't contain much

information.
Now, obviously, cigarette packages are rather

They

small; there's not that much you can say on them.

But the

10

principle point is under section 5(a), and with respect to

11

section 5(a), which talks about the package, we have no

12

doubt whatever that it would be impermissible to penalize

13

them for violating that provision.

14

17
18

QUESTION:

But when one --

Penalize them for obeying that

provision?
MR. TRIBE:

I'm sorry, penalize them for obeying

it and not going further.
But when this Court has a concern that perhaps a

19

jury, in some case, may go further, limiting instructions

20

would take care of the problem.

21

the court of appeals did was reread the statute as though

22

it said that, with respect not only to advertising and

23

promotion and packages, you may not be subject to any

24

further duty to let people know when something happens,

25

but with respect to all modes of communication.

It seems to me that what

MR. TRIBE:

1

No, it's not that they're a model.

2

But it's that the Cigarette Liability Act cannot be put on

3

a higher plane than the First Amendment, and that there is

4

no reason to eliminate, in the name of the Cigarette

5

Liability Act, a complete cause of action because of some

6

marginal thought that maybe a jury will impose the duty in

the wrong place.
This statute does not establish a -- sort of a

When you talk about failure to warn,

only to the tobacco companies?

21

MR. TRIBE:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTON FARR, III

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9
10
11

MR. FARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I believe that the basis for deciding this case

12

is to be found in three simple points, and I'd like

13

briefly to set them forth at the outset.

14

that the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act makes

15

clear that it does not contemplate the usual scheme of

16

Federal action supplemented by State action.

17

that Federal law could set the balance among competing

18

interests, Congress expressly barred the States from

19

imposing their own health-based requirements with respect

20

to labeling and advertising.

21

The first is

Instead, so

The second point is that under the usual

22

preemption principles followed by this Court in Garmon and

23

numerous other cases, including, of course, before the

24

Cigarette and Labeling and Advertising Act was passed,

25

preemption of State law typically includes State law in
23

1

any form, including tort, law because all State law has a

2

regulatory effect.

3

The exception is when there is a savings clause

4

in the act, indicating that Congress meant to separate

5

part of State law from the rest of State law.

6

is no savings clause in this act.

7

But there

The third point involves the specific tort

8

claims at issue here.

Each of them, in our view, is well

9

within the boundaries of the preempted area -- that is,

10

each specifically challenges something that the cigarette

11

companies either said or did not say with respect to

12

smoking and health.

13

The claims, to be specific, allege

14

misrepresentation about the effects of smoking on health,

15

conspiracy to misrepresent the effects of smoking on

16

health, failure to warn about the effects of smoking on

17

health, and express warranty about the effects of smoking

18

on health.

19

QUESTION:

May I ask right on your description

20

of failure to warn claim, do you read it as failure to

21

warn about information that the tobacco companies knew and

22

the public did not know?

23

MR. FARR:

I do not think it is limited to that.

24

I think it is intended to say that the tobacco companies

25

bore a duty of providing additional warning to consumers

1

than the warning that Congress provided, regardless of

2

whether that information is known only to cigarette

3

companies or not.

4

QUESTION:

Do you think at least analytically

5

one might break the two kinds of failure to warn claims

6

into two different parts for purposes of preemption

7

analysis?
MR. FARR:

8

9

so.

Your Honor, in the end I do not think

I think what Congress ultimately did here in the act

10

was to make a structural decision about whether Federal

11

law would ultimately be controlling or whether Federal law

12

would be supplemented by State law, and I think the

13

structural decision Congress made is that Federal law

14

would be controlling, and I think that applies in all

15

circumstances, so long as we are within the subject matter

16

of the act.

17

Now, I think it's important, in addressing the

18

argument made by petitioner, to see that Congress has done

19

here is somewhat unusual.

20

answered what is usually the most difficult question in a

21

preemption case, and that is whether Congress intended to

22

bar States from adding their own legal duties to those

23

that have been imposed by Federal law.

It has to a great degree

24

In this particular act, in section 1334, the

25

specific preemption provision, Congress has expressly,

1

explicitly, unmistakably barred the States from adding

2

their own requirements and prohibitions with respect to

3

labeling, advertising, and promotion.

4

And Congress did something additional.

It

5

explained why it had done so.

6

petitioner, there is not one mention of the statement of

7

policies and purposes in section 1331, which describes

8

Congress' intent to set a balance among competing

9

interests and not to have that balance disturbed.
QUESTION:

10
11

Where do we find section 1331 set out

in the briefs, Mr. Farr?
MR. FARR:

Thank you, Justice

That is where it's set out.
There -- what Congress did in 1965 and then

22

again reinforced in 1969 and again in 1984 is to address

23

the problem of a number of different proposals respecting

24

obligations that would be put on the cigarette companies,

25

proposals I might add that came at the Federal level and
26

at the State level.

2

was to find a solution that balanced all of the competing

3

interests.

4

What Congress ultimately tried'to do

The interest in having the companies themselves

5

warn consumers, the interest in having the warning be

6

uniform, and the interest in avoiding excessive harm to an

7

important part of the economy.

8

obligations on the companies to be set on a State-by-

9

State basis.

10

Congress did not want the

So what Congress did, essentially was that it

11

ordered the cigarette companies to put the warning on the

12

package, in a very unusual thing at the time, I might

13

point out, essentially cautioning consumers against use of

14

the very product that they were buying, but then left the

15

companies free to market on a national basis, so long as

16

they met Federal standards set and enforced by the Federal

17

Trade Commission.

18

The other thing that Congress did at this time

19

is that it made clear that it would continue to have the

20

ultimate control over this area because only it was in a

21

position to assure that all of these different interests

22

were taken into account.

23

States from acting in this area, but it actually put the

24

Federal Trade Commission on a short leash, in 1965,

25

expressly barring them from taking certain action with

Thus it not only barred the

1

respect to warnings and advertisements, and then in 1969

2

requiring the Commission to come back to Congress, before

3

it could impose a rule again affecting warnings in

4

advertisements.

5

So this is an unusually active role by Congress

6

in terms of supervising and seeing that this area is not

7

over-regulated.

8

9

Now, petitioner has tried to draw a line
throughout this case between different types of State law

10

saying that statutes and regulations are preempted but

11

that tort suits are not.

12

this sort of judicial line-drawing has been rejected by

13

this court time and time again.

14

QUESTION:

And I would just point out that

Mr. Farr, why is it not implicit in

15

subsection 2B of the Declaration of Policy, which

16

expressly states that it is the policy that commerce and

17

the national economy not be impeded by diverse, et cetera,

18

labeling and advertising regulations?

19

support there?

20

MR. FARR:

Why isn't that some

Your Honor, I think the reason is

21

that the cases from this court, including cases decided

22

relatively shortly before the Cigarette Labeling Act, made

23

clear that tort law had a regulatory effect, just as

24

statutory law or administrative law has.

25

QUESTION:

Well, it has a regulatory effect, but

1

we -- do we normally refer it to standards of tort law as

2

regulations?
MR. FARR:

3

I think that the natural meaning of

4

the terms, for example,

"under State law," which is used

5

in 1334, would include tort law.

6

talking about, in the Statement of Policies and Purposes,

7

regulations, I don't think that would be a limiting

8

construction of the language under State law in 1334.

And when Congress is

9

I think the -- one would then ask properly, does

10

State tort law have the same effects on uniformity, on the

11

national economy, as statutes or administrative

12

regulations do.

13

yes, and I believe it quite clearly is in this case, then

14

it seems.to me the term would naturally include tort law

15

as well.

16

And I think if the answer to that is,

QUESTION:

What is the case that is best for you

from this Court, in what you say disapproving the

1

right before the act, or 5 or 6 years before the act, so

2

that it would be perfectly natural for Congress to have an

3

understanding that when it was preempting State law

4

broadly and was concerned about the effects that this

5

Court would not attribute to tort law a different effect

6

on Federal law than it would other statutes.

7

Now the Court has adopted the same principle in

8

cases since then, International Paper v. Ouellette, for

9

example, the Court recognized that tort law would have a

10

direct regulatory effect, contrary to Federal law, and

11

indeed the Court did so just last term in Ingersoll-Rand,

12

so I think all of those cases stand for the proposition

13

generally.
Now as I've said, there is one exception to that

14
15

rule, which is that where Congress itself has put a

16

savings clause in the act, saying that it intends to make

17

a distinction among different kinds of State law, this

18

Court has, of course, honored that.
But what this Court has not done is itself

19
20

create a judicial savings clause that puts tort law on

21

different footing, even though it would have the same

22

effect on the purposes that Congress intends to achieve in

23

the act.

24
25

Now, one, I think, should notice that an effort
to try to distinguish tort law in a situation where

Congress has struck a balance seems particularly

difficult to defend.

Again, turning to the purposes and policies, one

sees discussion there of not just the interest in

providing information to consumers - - an interest by the

way that Congress intended to serve not just as a - - in

harm to the national economy.

matter of the preempted field.

We are not contending, as

2

we have said before, that every tort suit is necessarily

3

preempted.

4

But the claims here are very specific.

5

mentioned at the beginning, they seek to require

6

additional warnings about smoking and health, or they

7

allege misrepresentations about the effects of smoking on

8

health. If the State sought to impose exactly the same

9

requirements by statute, it seems to us clear that they

10

would be preempted.

Ultimately, I think, when that is

And, as I say, I think when Congress was

6

addressing this area, Congress was not looking at what is

7

obviously a troubling hypothetical in terms of conduct.

8

What I think Congress is looking at is saying, is this an

9

area that we believe should be governed exclusively by

10

Federal law, or is this an area in which we think there

11

ought to be essentially concurrent jurisdiction, with the

12

States free to take their own views about smoking and

13

health, whatever they may be, and impose them on the

14

cigarette companies by making the cigarette companies say

15

something on their packages, their advertising, or their

something.

to 1969, even without the broader language that Congress

9

ultimately adopted and put in place for the rest of the

misleading advertising, with no mention that anyone else,
including the States, could do so.

And what I think in

fact happened, is in 1969 Congress found itself forced to
resolve that dispute, because there were views on the
other side.
The court in Banzhaf, the D.C. Circuit, had
indicated that the act had to be read as if 1334(b)
essentially were the exclusive thing to look for for
preemption.

And when Congress did address the question,

Congress chose the broadened meaning, clearly put that
into the statute.
And I think that this Court has said in cases
like Red Lion and Seatrain, that the view about Congress
- - of Congress about the- meaning of a prior statute when
it clarifies that, is to be given significant weight.
QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, could a State legally pass

and enforce a law that says, generally, no person shall
import into this State any product that is dangerous, as
defined in this statute -- and the State lists certain
products in the statute and includes cigarettes - - and
anybody who does is subject to damages?

Now, I would like to turn for a moment to an

this morning, the use of the terms "based on" in section

First of all, to return to Garmon for a second,

18

the Court in Garmon, and in other cases which are cited in

19

our brief and in the amicus briefs, have consistently

20

rejected a distinction between general and specific law,

21

at least in terms of applying preemption principles as a

22

normal matter.

has looked to its effect on Federal law.

having said it was concerned about particular effects, was

perfectly happy to have those effects imposed on the

application with respect to cigarettes and smoking,

instead of simply passing a specific law that directly

10

attacks cigarettes and smoking itself.

11

leave all of that outside the area of preemption.

think that really doesn't follow from anything the

Congress has tried to do in the act.

That would simply
And I

The second point I would make about that is that
14

15

it doesn't even really make sense as a textual matter.

16

Quite apart from the language in section 1331, the words

"with respect to," it certainly suggests a broader scope.

In 1965, when I think everybody agrees that the preemption

19

provision, on its face, was now --or 1334(b); 1334(b)

to it is that if there is with respect to, not what they

"based on," is that this Court's decisions show that it

10

has made the point, importantly, that a law of general

applicability is less likely to be preempted when the

problem that Congress addresses is regulation targeted at

13

an industry.

on" language the way they read it is in, for example
