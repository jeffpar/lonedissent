ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME R. RICHTER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. RICHTER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
We are before the Court on a writ of certiorari

11

to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit following

12

its reversal of the entry of final judgment in favor of

13

our client, the petitioner, Barbara Hafer, by the District

14

Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

15

Although other claims were considered by the

16

courts below against the Auditor General and her co­

17

defendant, James West, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle

18

District of Pennsylvania, no aspect of those claims is

19

before this Court.

20

relates to the claims against the petitioner arising out

21

of Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which is

22

Title 42, United States Code, Section 1983.

23

The only issue before this Court

The principal question before the Court involves

24

the application of the Court's 1989 holding in Will v.

25

Michigan Department of State Police, wherein the Court

held neither the State nor its officials acting in an

2

official capacity are persons under Section 1983.

3

The petitioner, the Auditor General, is an

4

elected official of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

5

primary function of the petitioner is to ensure that all

6

the revenues due to the Commonwealth are collected and all

7

the funds so collected are legally and properly disbursed.

8

To fulfill that sensitive responsibility the Auditor

9

General supervises a staff of approximately 800 employees

Would the issue that you're going to argue be any

different if the 16 plaintiffs had been fired because they

23

were all females?

24
25

MR. RICHTER:

The issue would be no different.

It would affect, of course, perhaps the fact that there's

1

alternative relief available under Title VII, but it

2

wouldn't affect the argument.

3

The relevance, of course, Justice Stevens, to

4

our making reference to the facts relating to the job­

5

buying scheme in which eight of the respondents were the

6

beneficiaries has to do with the concern about the

7

interference by the courts into the internal operations of

8

State Government, particularly in a case of such a

9

sensitive and public nature as that involved in the job­

10
11

buying scheme.
But to go on, seven -- seven of the respondents

12

as union members pursued and secured arbitration awards.

13

They -- they were union members, and as such they were

14

entitled to a grievance procedure which permitted the

15

arbitration process, and each of the seven was awarded

16

reinstatement with back pay and interest on the back pay.

17

The reason for the arbitration awards, was given

18

by the arbitrators, was that they grounded their awards

19

solely on the basis that there was a total lack of -- lack

20

of adequate proof on the part of the Auditor General that

21

the seven respondents knew that their jobs were purchased.

22

All eight beneficiaries of the job-buying

23

scheme, including the seven with the awards for

24

reinstatement, are still pressing 1983 claims alleging

25

political discharge in violation of the First Amendment

2

against the Auditor General.
With respect to the claims for prospective

3

relief, we readily concede that the Will decision affirms

4

the doctrine of Ex parte Young, and that a State official

5

is a person for purposes of injunctive relief.

6

not challenge that aspect of the Circuit Court's ruling.

7

The Auditor General moved for summary judgment

And we do

8

before the district court and relied on the Will decision,

9

and set forth her function in summary judgment papers

10

reflecting that she was acting in her official capacity,

11

that she was the duly authorized State official who had

12

the ability and authority to hire and fire in that office,

13

and the district court concluded in entering judgment in

14

favor of the Auditor General, that she was in fact acting

15

in her official capacity.

16

under Section 1983, and dismissed the case.

17

court did not address the merits of the political

18

discharge claims.

19

She therefore was not a person
The district

The circuit court reversed, treated the summary

20

judgment as if it had been a judgment on the pleadings.

21

While not addressing the determination of the district

22

court that the Auditor General was acting in her official

23

capacity, the circuit court nevertheless held that

24

respondents could maintain the actions against the Auditor

25

General based simply on the fact that they had asserted

1

that they were suing her in her personal capacity.

2

that, the Circuit Court thus interpreted Will as standing

3

for the proposition that State officials, sued for damages

4

in their personal capacity, are persons under Section

5

1983 .

6

And by

We submit that that is not what this Court held

7

at all in the Will decision.

On the contrary, at the

8

outset of the Will decision, the Court stated that the

9

case presented the question of whether a State or State

10

official, while acting in his or her official capacity, is

11

a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, and

12

then proceeded to answer that question at the conclusion

13

in the negative, wherein the court stated,

14

and I quote -- "that neither a State nor its officials

15

acting in their official capacities are persons under

16

Section 1983 . "

"We hold" --

17

We submit that the Circuit Court holding was

18

inconsistent with this -- the important holding in the

19

Will decision, and if not reversed will eviscerate the

20

meaning of the Will case.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Richter, if you're not acting in

22

your official capacity, does 1983 apply at all?

23

1983 requires that the action be under color of law, under

24

color of State law, right?

25

MR. RICHTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

In our view, one can be acting in their official

capacity and be acting under color of State law.

They can

10

also be acting other than in their official capacity and

11

also be acting under color of State law.
QUESTION:

12

In a 1 83 case, is it useful to

13

analyze in what capacity a public official acts beyond the

14

question of under color of State law?

15

just talk about in what capacity they're sued, not in what

16

capacity they act, once we've decided that the requirement

17

of under color of State law is met?

MR. RICHTER:

Don't we usually

This Court has consistently been

1

dealing with the issues of capacity up until 1 8 , based

20

on its interpretation of the immunities and the Eleventh

21

Amendment issues that drove those decisions.

22

until 1 8

23

this Court had to address when somebody is or is not a

24

person under Section 1 83 -- or to put it more

25

specifically, when a State official is a person under 1 83

It was not

in Will, where the -- when for the first time

1

for purposes of money damage suits.

2

for the first time that it had to focus on the standard of

3

how one might be found to be a person or not under Section

4

1983 .

5

And it was only then

The need to identify capacity prior to that, and

6

unrelated to that, arose out of the 11 -- Eleventh

Amendment considerations.

8

separate and apart from the statutory definition of

"person" that was addressed in the Will decision.

10

Those considerations are

Well, Will said they were separate --

11

really, separate considerations.

MR. RICHTER:

Do you think Ex parte Young applies

Absolutely, sir, and --

MR. RICHTER:

Well, Ex parte Young was not a

MR. RICHTER:

20

MR. RICHTER:

And in our view we concede that if

21

the court didn't reach the merits, and if this Court

22

chooses not to reach the merits, then those six Gurley

23

claims for reinstatement under Ex parte Young ought to be

24

considered by the district court, and we don't contest

that.

QUESTION:

So they were -- the courts below were

wrong in that respect?

MR. RICHTER:

QUESTION:

5

MR. RICHTER:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. RICHTER:

If the court --

If.

All right.
That's only one aspect --

Yes.
--of the case.

Our principal

8

concern is with the money damage claims against the

9

Auditor General personally.

The reinstatement claims were

10

brought by six Gurley respondents against the Auditor

11

General in her official capacity, and as to those we

12

concede that unless that's decided on the merits or

13

considered decided on the merits, it has to go back.

14

QUESTION:

So on the damages, you say that the

15

firing was an act under the officials in the official's

16

official capacity?

17

MR. RICHTER:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct, sir.

And Ex parte Young should not apply

19

to -- in that situation, even though the allegation is

20

that the firing was unconstitutional?

21

MR. RICHTER:

The allegation -- the allegations

22

are that the firings were unconstitutional, but we submit,

23

Your Honor, that Ex parte Young is on a separate track on

24

reinstatement, and we suggest --

25

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but how about on the

1

damages issue?
MR. RICHTER:

2

On the damages issue, we suggest

3

that a claim of political discharge, wherein an effort is

4

made to pursue the State official, in this case in your

5

individual capacity, for money damages, is inappropriate

6

because the official in connection with hiring and firing

7

is acting in her official capacity in much the same way

8

that the director of State Police in Will was acting in

9

his official capacity, and as such ought not -- ought not

10

to have to answer personally, with their personal assets

11

at risk, under 1983 --

12

QUESTION:

Well --

13

MR. RICHTER:

And we submit that in the Will

14

decision, of course, that was a suit against the director

15

of State Police in his official capacity, whereas this

16

case -- I'm sorry, sir.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. RICHTER:

Well, go ahead.
Whereas in this case the case

19

comes before you on the respondent's assertion that

20

they're pressing the case against the Auditor General in

21

her individual capacity.
QUESTION:

22

But surely a State Auditor can't fire

23

any State employee other than in her official capacity,

24

can she?

25

MR. RICHTER:

That's exactly the point.

She can

and within her department alone, and she's authorized to

do that.

But in her -- acting in her official

Were she, of

other department or some related agency and either
10

directly or indirectly try to affect some employment

decision, she'd be acting outside of her authority, and in

12

our submission would not be acting in her official

13

capacity, as an example --

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but if her act is

15

unconstitutional under Ex parte Young, it is not to be

16

charged to the State.

MR. RICHTER:

QUESTION:

There --

You referred to it as a fiction.

1

State and the State is not answerable in money damages.

2

QUESTION:

Exactly.

3

MR. RICHTER:

They were only answerable under

4

Young for prospective relief, and that's because the Young

5

doctrine tells us that -- that for injunctive or

6

prospective relief the State will not be - - will be

7

considered a person.

8

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Richter, what I don't understand

about the -- the -- you know, the last hypothetical you

10

gave, you say when she fires somebody from another

11

department that she doesn't have control over, then she

12

would be acting in her personal capacity, right?

3

MR. RICHTER:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct, sir.

But she also -- but she wouldn't have

5

any authority to do it, so she wouldn't be acting under

6

color of State law.

7
8
9

I mean, it seems to me that whenever you say
personal capacity, you're just out from under
MR. RICHTER:

983 anyway?

Well, I beg to differ with that,

20

because I think she would be acting under color of State

21

law, although I think she would be - -

22

QUESTION:

She would in trying to fire somebody

23

from another department?

24

authority over that person in the other department?

25

you know, I find it hard to conceive of a case in which

It's clear that she has no

Now,

1

you could ever get damages under 1983, because as soon

2

as -- well --

3

MR. RICHTER:

In our view, sir, the Will case

4

told us to look to the function of the State official in

5

determining whether or not they're a person under the act.

6

In our submission, the determination of whether a State

7

official is going to be held personally responsible is

8

something that ought to be determined by the court and not

9

by the pleadings of the -- of the plaintiff alone.

10

QUESTION:

Before you leave that, could I ask

11

you two quick questions?

First, when Justice Scalia had

12

questioned you before about under color of State law, you

13

quoted something from a case, I think -- misuse of power

14

Our view is that the

The first is to describe an attribute of the conduct of a

State law.

Was that defendant acting in his official

For example, in West v. Atkins Mr. Justice

6

Blackmun stated,

"Generally a public employee acts under

color of State law while acting in his official capacity

9

or while exercising his responsibilities pursuant to State

If a person is acting in his official capacity, he

11

is certainly acting under State law.

proposition.
The expression "official capacity," then, can

3

have two meanings.

4

the defendant which occurred before the lawsuit took place

5

and which gives rise to it, or it can describe the legal

6

personage of the defendant once the litigation is under

way.

8

It can be describing the conduct of

The petitioner seeks to equate the conduct with
the legal personage, and to say that if the defendant was

10

acting in an official capacity, he or she can only be sued

11

in an official capacity.

12

basically to abolish personal capacity lawsuits where the

13

defendant is a State employee or a State official, because

14

in an official capacity lawsuit it is the State that is

15

the defendant, and we know that the State is not a person

16

under 1 83, and the State has Eleventh Amendment immunity

17

in Federal court.

18

And what that equation does was

So I do not believe that Will was ever intended

1

to abolish personal capacity lawsuits, and I believe that

20

Will spoke only in the context of what the Supreme Court

21

of Michigan recognized to be an official capacity lawsuit

22

and which this Court said in its opinion was an official

capacity lawsuit.

1

capacity suit, and how specific must the complaint be, do

2

you think?

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

In order to be an official

4

capacity suit under Kentucky v. Graham it is necessary to

5

allege that the governmental entity was the moving force

6

behind the deprivation of civil rights and that the

7

entity's policy and custom played a factor.

8

allegations, there can be no official capacity liability.

9

So I would say that one thing to look at in the lawsuit is

10

Without those

whether the official capacity allegations are there.

11

Secondly, according to Kentucky v. Graham, if

12

you're proceeding in an official capacity lawsuit, then

13

you would give notice to the governmental entity and you

14

would give them an opportunity to defend.

In this case,

15

the governmental entity was not notified.

Only Barbara

16

Hafer is notified, only she is requested for damages, and

17

only she was involved in the case.

18

In addition, there have been decisions of this

19

Court in Brandon v. Holt and I believe in the Bender case

20

where the Court said that we can look to the subsequent

21

conduct of proceedings if it is in doubt.

22

case we did file documents before the Court entered

23

summary judgment in which we specifically said that we are

24

proceeding only against Barbara Hafer in her personal

25

capacity.

And in this

1

And there is a verification in the records which

2

appears at page 197 where it just actually states that,

where it says,

All claims for

Service of the complaint

No service was attempted

No money has been sought, and no claim

10

has been made for monetary damages to be paid out of the

11

Commonwealth's Treasury."

12

I will admit that the initial pleadings are not

13

paragons in this case, but I think that we did get the

14

point across at a stage that was still reasonable and fair

15

to the defendant to know what the issues were in the case.

16

I would respectfully suggest to the Court that

17

since 1974, with Scheuer v. Rhoads, it has been the law

18

that if a State executive official personally commits a

19

deprivation of civil rights, then that official can be

20

held accountable and made in his person to respond to the

21

victim to remedy the right that has been wronged -- that

22

has been committed.

23

And in that matter the Court actually cited Ex

24

parte Young as authority for that position, and the

25

Court -- and Chief Justice Burger, speaking for a
23

1

unanimous Court, said,

"However, since Ex parte Young, it

2

has been settled that the Eleventh Amendment provides no

3

shield for a State official confronted by a claim that he

4

has deprived another of a Federal right under color of

5

State law," and further on, went really right down to the

6

capacity issue and personal liability.

7

It says that, Young teaches that when a State

8

officer acts under a State law in a manner violative of

9

the Federal Constitution, he comes into conflict with the

10

superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that

11

case stripped of his official or representative character

12

and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his

13

individual conduct.

14

All that we are asking in this case is that

15

Barbara Hafer be accountable for the consequences of her

16

individual conduct, and I would respectfully submit that

17

if petitioner were to prevail in this case it would be

18

necessary to overrule Scheuer v. Rhoads.

19

I would also call to the Court's attention what

20

I believe to have been a unanimous decision in Forrester

21

v. White.

22

official who fired a probation officer, and it was

23

determined that that firing was a violation of the

24

probation officer's constitutional rights.

A personal

1

was entered against the judge.
The judge said that I am entitled to absolute

2

3

immunity because I am a judicial officer, and this Court

4

said that hiring and firing is not the type of conduct

5

that will qualify for an absolute immunity.

6

firing is administrative, and we can tell -- or we think

7

we know that back in 1871 what immunities were fairly in

8

the minds of Congress and hiring and firing was not one of

9

them.

10

Hiring,

Well, what Hafer has done in this case is a

11

hiring and firing decision, and she is a State official.

12

She is really seeking an absolute immunity in this case.

13

She's saying, I can't be personally responsible for my

14

conduct, and if she were to receive an absolute immunity,

15

I would think that this Court would have to overrule

16

Forrester v. White.

17

I would also say that her position simply is not

18

supportable by the plain meaning of the statute.

Richter conceded that Hafer was acting under color of

20

State law at the time she fired these people.

an action at law is an action for damages.

4

plain meaning of the statute, if she is acting under color

of State law and she commits a violation of someone's

6

civil rights, at the very least she is liable for an

7

action for damages.
There has been some reference in Petitioner's

brief to a worry about vexatious lawsuits.

I would

10

respectfully submit that the concept, this doctrine of

11

qualified immunity, developed to the final point in Harlow

12

v; Fitzgerald, adequately handles that situation.

13

would respectfully say to the Court from the decision of

14

Mitchell v. Forsyth, where Justice White stated,

15

emphasize that the denial of absolute immunity will not

16

leave the Attorney General at the mercy of litigants with

17

frivolous and vexatious complaints.

18

qualified immunity in Harlow, the Attorney General will be

19

entitled to immunity so long as his actions do not violate

20

clearly established statutory or constitutional rights

21

which a reasonable person would have known."

22

Justice White concluded,

And I

We are not suggesting that Scheuer v. Rhoads or

we're suggesting that the Court in its decision in Will

as to be a person or not under Section 1983.

never addressed in any of those cases until the Will

QUESTION:

In your view, Mr. Richter, do the

plaintiffs in this case then have no chance of monetary

relief against the State Auditor?
MR. RICHTER:

9

In our position, they -- they have

no right - - they never had a right to seek monetary damage

11

against the Auditor General since she's acting in her

official capacity in the firings, is not a person, and

their relief that they seek ought to be limited to either

prospective relief or some other alternative relief.

factors that we had suggested in our briefing, that in

18

determining whether or not a State official was acting

19

within their official capacity such that they're not

20

persons, we would suggest that special police power cases,

21

cases involving the public at large, are such that those

22

parties are not acting in their official capacity.

24

internal operations of State Government.

We would suggest that there was an analogous

situation, albeit not in a statutory context, in Bush v.

wherein the Court declined to extend the opportunity to

it impacted adversely on the internal operation of the

the recitation and suggestion that t:he Eleventh Amendment
