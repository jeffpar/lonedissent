ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

This

contrary to the logic of, the interpretation of 1915 in

2

the line of cases this Court has announced beginning with

3

McDonald and Sindram, passing through the announcement of

4

Rule 38.9 and the recent case of Zatko.

5

The -- it is my contention initially there is no

6

justification for an exclusive judicial notice rule.

The

7

Ninth Circuit has fashioned this requirement out of thin

8

air.

It has no basis in law and is contrary to policy.

9

QUESTION:

Are you going to explain in a little

10

more detail what is the exclusive judicial notice rule

11

that you're referring to, Mr. Ching?
MR. CHING:

12

Yes, Your Honor.

The Ninth Circuit

13

required that before a case could be determined as

14

frivolous and in forma pauperis status rejected, reference

15

had to be made through judicial notice to some objective

16

negating fact which positively contramanded the

17

allegations of the pleading.

18

that in Neitzke, in which this Court required that,

19

contrary to a 12(b) motion for judgment on the pleadings,

20

a district court had to pierce the veil and eliminate,

21

pierce the veil of the pleadings in the complaint and

22

eliminate the fantastic and the delusional.

23

This approach is contrary to

Clearly the Ninth Circuit rule fails as to the

24

fantastic.

25

plaintiff is not Satan or Mohammed or a martian.

There is no judicial notice to be made that a

These

1

fantastic cases prove that the exclusive judicial notice

2

rule cannot be left in place.

3

The present case presents the other half of

4

Neitzke, the delusional cases.

5

these five complaints is ample proof of a diagnosed

6

delusional condition and of perceptions which not only

7

defy the principles of formal logic but also defy common

8

sense, and in fact are perfectly predictable from the

9

initial medical diagnosis in the record.

Within the corners of

This is an

10

individual who is incapable of reasoning in an appropriate

11

manner.

12

complaints must be ignored.

13

perceptual apparatus is seriously wanting.

14

We do not say that because he is ill his

QUESTION:

But because he is ill his

Well, Mr. Ching, do you take the view

15

that the trial judge is to determine the credibility of

16

the allegations made in a complaint, the factual

17

allegations made, or do you take the position that the

18

trial court should just determine what rational inferences

19

can be drawn from the facts that are alleged?

20

MR. CHING:

The use of the term credibility I

21

believe is an unfortunate one, my point being that there

22

is no evaluation of a witness' testimony made within the

23

four corners of the five complaints.

24

QUESTION:

I mean, it would seem to me that

1

be said that no rational inference of rapes could be made

2

from the facts that were alleged with the exception, of

3

course, of the affidavits submitted by Armando Esquer.

4

What do you do about that, where he says he witnessed

5

sexual assaults on the complaining party?

6

MR. CHING:

I agree with you as to the

7

evaluation that must be made of the unsupported

8

allegations.

9

tend to lend credibility to the allegations that are

11

The issue of the supporting affidavits does

referred to - QUESTION:

Well, as to that do you think in the

12

face of the affidavit of Armando Esquer, that as to that

13

complaint which is one of the five, that it can be

14

dismissed - -

15

MR. CHING:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. CHING:

Your Honor, I would say ---as frivolous?
-- on its face, read without the

18

context of the five complaints, it would survive a

19

frivolity determination, and indeed it might very well

20

survive a 12(b)(5), 12(b)(6) rather.

21

rationality within the complaints.

22

all would survive is a matter that I think is at first

23

instance entrusted to the discretion of the trial court.

24

However, the larger context and the context to which the

25

magistrate referred in dismissing these complaints is that

There is a range of

1

the seemingly rational is in fact tainted by the less

2

rational contained in the grouping.

3

QUESTION:

But, but when you look at the

4

affidavit of this third party, then it seems to me you're

5

saying that the trial judge should just make a credibility

6

determination as to that affidavit.

7

MR. CHING:

Well, insofar as what the trial

8

judge should be doing in evaluating a complaint, he should

9

be attempting to pierce the veil, whatever that means, in

10

Neitzke terms.

Neitzke states that a 12(b)(5), 12(b)(6)

11

cannot be based on a credibility determination.

12

there is an inference in Neitzke that the court is

13

entitled to go beyond the mere surface reading of it and

14

is entitled to take both judicial notice and to make

15

rational connections amongst the parts of the complaints

16

that appear before it.

17

The --

QUESTION:

19

Could I ask, was this dismissal here

with prejudice or without prejudice?

as to what our standard is going to be.

9

it's one thing, but if you think the dismissal means he

If all we're

10

can't rebring it, then maybe we ought to have a higher

11

standard.
MR. CHING:

12

The dismissal is one which simply

13

denies IFP.

14

Ninth Circuit has in fact taken the position by requiring

15

not only the objective judicial notice rule, but also the

16

de novo review on appeal, and also the reporting

17

requirements to the inmate, that is reporting to the

18

inmate how the complaint is deficient, that no

19

subjectivity should enter into this process.

20

is fundamentally contrary to the position set forth in the

21

cases that relate to 39.8, excuse me, 38.9 -- 39.8 -- in

22

any case, this Court's rule regarding frivolity.

23

I see no greater significance to it.

that a complaint is frivolous if it has a legally

2

sustainable basis?

3

MR. CHING:

Certainly not.

This Court has

always adhered to the rule that the frivolous case is one

that is inarguable in law or fact.

here.
MR. CHING:

Well, Your Honor -I don't know what precedential value
We haven't stated any

The standard set forth in 3 .8 is

16

the same that is set forth in 1 15(d), and is perfectly

17

consistent with any theory that this Court has inherent

18

power to order its own business.
QUESTION:

1

Yes, but the standard for frivolity

20

in a petition for certiorari to this Court may be quite

21

different when applied on facts from the standard of

frivolity applied to a complaint filed in the district

court.

9

MR. CHING:

I take it you

I believe that would be one

consequence of a discretionary interpretation of

10

frivolity, and yet I believe we have to entertain a

11

discretionary interpretation of frivolity because there is

12

no substantial means to assure a perfectly uniform result

13

in each application to the various district courts.

14

The suggestion has been made by the United

15

States that the terms used in Rule 11, not well grounded

in law, are interpretable or applicable to the frivolity

determination in 1915(d).

and in some cases perhaps clients,, and the fact that one

that sanctions of that sort are going to be used.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD W. NICHOLS

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22

25

MR. NICHOLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Section 1915 is a statute of general
applicability to poor persons.

It is a statute enacted in

11

support of a congressional goal that access to the courts

2

should be equally available to the poor as well as to the

3

rich.

4

or civil rights cases such as this case is, and, as the

5

Chief Justice has indicated, it is not a sanction

6

statement, statute.

7

It is not a statute which applies only to prisoner

In balancing the right of access under Section

8

1915 against caseload concerns that district courts

9

obviously have that moved Congress to authorize dismissals

10

for frivolousness under the statute, it is desirable that

11

district courts be afforded an objective standard -- this

12

is one of the substantial differences between the

13

petitioner and the respondent in this case --an objective

14

standard pursuant to which they can determine whether

15

particular factual allegations have an arguable basis and

16

therefore are not frivolous.

17

This Court has already partially determined an

18

objective standard in Neitzke, namely the standard that

19

the claim must have a, quote, arguable basis, unquote, in

20

law and fact.

21

succeeding according to the viewer.

22

of the respondent means whether any rational fact-finder

23

could conclude that the allegations are true.

1

law rather than facts.

2

MR. NICHOLS:

Certainly that is the sense in

3

which it is most frequently used, but the Court's

4

definition of the standard in Neitzke applied the same

5

definition, arguable basis, to both law and fact.

6

seems to the respondent that in trying to figure out what

7

an arguable basis is, Mr. Chief Justice, that a rational

8

fact-finder would be the one to determine whether a

9

particular factual argument is or is not arguable.
QUESTION:

10

And it

Are you inserting a whole layer of

11

some sort of determination different from a motion to

12

dismiss or a motion for summary judgment?

13

MR. NICHOLS:

It's essentially, essentially akin

14

to a motion for summary judgment procedure, although not

15

necessarily having to be brought by motion.

16

case clearly establishes that motions to dismiss and

17

frivolousness dismissals are different in kind.

18

The Neitzke

And if I may respond to Justice Scalia's earlier

19

question, it is the respondent's view, it is my view that

20

a frivolousness dismissal constitutes a factual

21

determination of frivolousness which would preclude the

22

bringing of a second action on the same claims if the

23

plaintiff could get together the money to pay the filing

24

fee.

25

QUESTION:

And yet Neitzke certainly allows the

district court or the magistrate, whoever is the initial

2

determiner, to probe beyond the surface allegations.

3

don't have to treat it the way you do a dismiss, where a

4

motion to dismiss or all properly pleaded facts are

5

treated as true.

6

MR. NICHOLS:

7

QUESTION:

You

Absolutely, and --

So what more can the district court

8

do, in your view, than it can do on a motion to dismiss,

9

which is virtually nothing so far as well pleaded facts?
MR. NICHOLS:

10

Well, the district court can

11

require a number of, impose a number of procedural

12

requirements to require the plaintiff to get away from

13

pleading conclusions and plead evidentiary material,

14

heightened facts, so that the district court can

15

determine, prior to the plaintiff coming in for an

16

evidentiary credibility determination, whether the

17

pleadings with those items of evidence would be sufficient

18

to enable a rational fact-finder to conclude that there

19

was something worth proceeding on to the credibility

20

point.

21

QUESTION:

The rule, the section as written

22

contemplates some dismissals without further leave to

23

amend or anything else, don't you think?

24
25

MR. NICHOLS:

It certainly contemplates

dismissals without leave to amend.

I suppose that there

1

are some types of allegations that are so outlandish on

2

their face that no rational fact-finder could ever

3

conclude, no matter how much opportunity to amend was

4

granted, that they would, that they could survive.

5

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Nichols, some of the

6

allegations here may fall in that category, I would

7

suggest.
MR. NICHOLS:

8

9

Well, some of them -- I will

certainly admit, Justice O'Connor, that quite a number of

10

them fail to survive a 12(b)(6) test at this point, and it

11

may be on amendment - QUESTION:

12

13

Well, they may fail to allow a

rational inference to be drawn as to some of them.

14

MR. NICHOLS:

20

Clearly an irrational allegation on its face.

21

you superimpose on that the possibility of a prisoner

alleging that there had been a prison show about Robin

23

Hood and some of the other inmates had kept some of the

24

clothing and the other inmates in that clothing had come

However, if

1

QUESTION:

What if you were --

2

MR. NICHOLS:

And the notice point, it seems to

3

me, is a kind of a due process thing that if you're going

4

to throw a plaintiff out with prejudice he ought to have

5

an opportunity to plead his best case.

6

talking about pro se plaintiffs we can almost presume that

7

they haven't pled their best case in the first instance.
QUESTION:

8

9

And when we're

Mr. Nichols, in your response to

Justice O'Connor you said that some of the allegations

10

here would not survive a 12(b)(6) motion, as if you were,

11

that were a more extreme test than 1915.

12

that just the opposite was true, that some allegations of

13

fact that would survive a 12(b)(6) test could be thrown

14

out on the grounds of fantasy or delusion in a way that we

15

have never said a 12(b)(6) motion would reach them.

MR. NICHOLS:

I had thought

Your Honor, what I had in mind in

response to Justice O'Connor was Mr. Hernandez has brought

personal responsibility on the part of those people.

But what the Ninth Circuit has done has been to

say a lot of these allegations probably don't survive a

10

Ching has referred to it, the notice rule, that before the

Ninth Circuit will dismiss a case under 12(b)(6) with

Was this a dismissal under 12(b)(6)?

No, it was not.

This was a

dismissal under 1915.

18

QUESTION:

Well, did you just misspeak yourself?

19

MR. NICHOLS:

No.

What I said, what I intended

20

to say, Justice White, was that the Ninth Circuit in

21

reversing the 1915 dismissal pointed out that many of

22

these allegations as they stood would not survive a

23

12(b)(6), but that the district court ought to give the

QUESTION:

Well, what about 1915?

What did they

7

and they could not do that.

QUESTION:

Well, the state is challenging that

standard for dismissing under 1915.
MR. NICHOLS:

The state, as I understand it, is

11

contending that the district court has absolute and

12

standardless discretion to dismiss under 1915.

QUESTION:

Well, anyway, they disagree with the

Ninth Circuit on 1915.

Certainly.

They do.

Are you going to get to that sometime?

MR. NICHOLS:

Yes, Justice White.

It is my view

19

that a 1915 dismissal cannot be justified unless the court

20

can make a determination that no rational fact-finder

21

could ultimately conclude that the allegations of the

complaint are worthy of belief.

there are some allegations that respectfully are not

irrational in my view under anybody's test.

4

QUESTION:

For example in this case

No one doubts the district court must

5

take a look at each of the allegations, but the question

6

is may the district court dismiss some allegations as

7

frivolous without any ifs, ands, or buts about it?

8

9

MR. NICHOLS:

I believe that the district court

may not do so unless and until a plaintiff has been given

10

a knowing opportunity to present his best evidentiary case

11

to the court.

12

then the district court can dismiss without having to have

13

process served.

14

And if he can't pass muster at that time

QUESTION:

What if he, what if the court does

15

all of that and after doing that 99 of the allegations are

a standard that is applied to each specific factual claim

they're all over the lot.

MR. NICHOLS:

Is that right?

I don't know that I would argue

with that.

All right.

Mr. Ching, do you have rebuttal?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES CHING

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. CHING:

Your Honor, I would suggest that the

Court was correct in stating that there has been an

accretion of miscellaneous procedures, all of them

1915(d) has a purpose.

Similarly there is

It is presumptively

This is not a decision that requires

May I ask you, Mr. Ching, what your

understanding of the Ninth Circuit rule is?

17

true that they think there's a category of cases called

fantastic or delusional that the district judge can just

dismiss out of hand?

20

MR. CHING:

Yes.

Is it not

But my interpretation of the

21

words, in reading both opinions, is that fantastic and

22

delusional must be established by judicial notice.

23

QUESTION:

Right.

If they, in other words if

they take judicial notice of the fact that even though

probability that there are men from Mars in this

particular prison is sufficiently remote that the judge

3

can take judicial notice of the improbability and

4

therefore go ahead and dismiss?

5

MR. CHING:

I believe I must disagree with that.

6

It is a rational attempt to make sense of what the Ninth

7

Circuit says.

8

We have a rule that states what judicial notice can be

9

taken of.

However, judicial notice is quite clear.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. CHING:

What is it?
Well, it states that there is

facts in a general group that are beyond question,

MR. CHING:

Yes.

And so by extension I find it

18

very difficult to think that a court could in good faith

19

take judicial notice that there are no martians.

20

Therefore we're left --

21

QUESTION:

What do you suppose we meant when we

22

referred -- that comes out of Neitzke, I think, the

23

fantastic or delusional scenarios.

you think we meant by that?

We didn't mean judicial notice

MR. CHING:

You certainly did not, Your Honor.

You meant exactly the opposite.

accretion of procedures.
QUESTION:

You meant a subjective

But what is it, maybe I miss it in

the Ninth Circuit, what is it in the Ninth Circuit opinion

that tells us that even in the kind, the martian type

understand the judicial notice argument in that particular

context.

MR. CHING:

I don't

Well, I must say I find it very

difficult to understand it as well.
QUESTION:

I thought what they said was that

17

there are allegations here that have some factual support,

18

and there is enough factual support that we'll send them

back and have the district judge take a look at them.
