ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. MINEAR:

8

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
13

This original action is before the Court on

11

cross motions for summary judgment.

12

presented is whether the Secretary of the Army acted

13

within his authority when he refused to issue a permit for

14

construction of the Nome Port Facility unless Alaska

15

agreed that the construction would be deemed not to alter

16

the location of the Federal/State boundary.

The question

understand this case.

decision, California I, that the Federal Government rather

20

than the individual States owns offshore submerged lands.

21

6 years later Congress enacted two statutes:

22

Continental Shelf Lands Act; and the Submerged Lands Act

23

which divided the offshore submerged lands between the

24

Federal and State governments.

A dispute then arose whether coastal

State itself had built, because the United States, through

11

its control over navigable waters, had the power to

12

protect its interests from encroachment and quote, the

effect of any future changes could thus be the subject of

agreement between the parties.

We

Congress has directed the Army to regulate the

4

placement of structures in navigable waters.

5

statute, section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act,

6

contains a complete prohibition on the creation of any

7

obstruction to navigation.

The relevant

It then gives the Secretary of the Army the

8

power to allow exceptions on a case-by-case basis where
10

structure work is recommended by the Corps of Engineers.

11

Thus, section 10 expresses a legislative policy against

12

the placement of structures in navigable waters except

13

where the Secretary affirmatively determines that the

14

structure should be allowed.

15

Section 10 does not identify specific factors

16

the Secretary should take into account in authorizing such

17

structures.

20

laws.

21

The Secretary accordingly takes into account

This public interest review process is certainly

22

reasonable.

Nothing in section 10 suggests the Army

23

should exercise its permitting authority without regard to

24

the policies that Congress has stated elsewhere.

QUESTION:

6

Government's position under section 10 and under this

7

waiver or for that matter, under all waivers, with respect

8

to a natural accretion that is caused by the construction

9

of the artificial structure?

10

%

MR. MINEAR:

That is a factor that would be

11

taken into account in building the structure, and I think

12

that is a very relevant point in this sense, the structure

13

might cause downstream erosion, shoreline accretion, which

14

•

could result in actually bringing the boundary landward

15

and would affect the State's grant of submerged lands.

16

That is a factor that the Army will take into account in

17

determining whether to issue a structure.

18

QUESTION:

I am not talking about whether the

19

Army will take it into account in determining whether to

20

issue the permit.

21

permit is issued subject to a waiver such as this; does

22

the waiver include the State's power over any extension of

23

the State's boundary caused by natural accretion which is

24

in turn attributable to the artificial structure?

QUESTION:

3

Under the specific terms of this

You have to go and figure out how

4

much natural accretion along the shoreline is caused by

5

the construction of a jetty that was subject to a waiver

6

like this?

It makes it awful complicated, doesn't it?
MR. MINEAR:

7

With all respect, Your Honor, this

8

is only going to arise in most cases with respect to the

9

leasing of mineral rights.

If the State or the Federal

10

Government decides to lease mineral rights, it will in

11

fact issue a notice and the parties will contact the

12

relevant agencies, any party interested in leasing

13

property, to locate the boundary.
QUESTION:

14

No, but it is the case that I just

15

can't look at the shoreline and say, well, except for

16

natural structures, I know that the 3-mile is measured

17

from the shoreline and you are telling me that if some of

18

that shoreline may be up-current or down-current, I don't

19

know how accretion works, has been altered by reason of

20

the artificial structure, I cannot count that part of the

21

shoreline for determining the 3-mile limit.

minimized by the fact that one aspect of this project is a

2

littoral drift monitoring program which was designed to

3

assure that there would be no accretion or erosion as a

4

result of the construction of this structure.

5

The party that has the permit here, the City of

6

Nome, is under an obligation to monitor any such changes,

7

and if they do occur, it is under an obligation to prevent

8

them from occurring.
So although this raises a theoretical difficulty

But you say that the Corps does not

generally exact waivers in connection with streams or

MR. MINEAR:

5

Well, frankly, I am just not

certain about that practice.

7

8

consequence, both physical or legal, that might result

from the addition of a structure in navigable waters.

But supposing that a State applies to

11

build a dam on a river and the river is on an interstate

boundary and the prospectus or study says there is a

13

chance that there will be some erosion on one side of the

14

river, accretion on the other and it might alter the

boundary of the State some, how would the Court take that

into consideration?

21

boundaries, particularly boundaries for submerged lands

22

that can be subject to accretion or erosion.

23

Corps' basic perspective on this is that we don't want the

24

structure to be altering settled expectations with respect

25

to property rights.

There is a need for stability with respect to

So the

QUESTION:

1

So the structure -- the point of my

2

earlier question, Mr. Minear, is that I am inclined to

3

agree with the Government that section 10 allows you to

4

take into account whether it will alter the ownership of

5

submerged lands, but to say that you can take it into

6

account is not to say that can condition the permission

7

upon this kind of waiver.

8

necessarily include the lesser.

The greater does not

And if indeed one of the consequences of having
10

these waivers is that the shoreline is always going to be

11

subject to debate as to whether some natural accretion has

12

occurred by reason of an artificial structure under such a

13

waiver, I am more inclined to think that your choice is

14

either to let it go forward in which case the coast is

15

altered as the structure causes, or else, not let it go

16

forward.

17
18
1

Why isn't that a conceivable version of section
10?

MR. MINEAR:

Well, with all respect, Your Honor,

20

the Corps, what the Corps is attempting to do here is to

21

stabilize and provide definiteness with respect to title.

22

That is what the disclaimer did in this particular case.

23

That is what the littoral drift monitoring program also

24

did with respect to this case.

25

disclaimer might be crafted and in fact, the Army allows

Much depends on how the

1

2

whether or not the disclaimer would appropriately protect

3

Federal interests.

4

But the ultimate interest that the Federal

5

Government is asserting here is in fact the stability of

6

title, the fact that we do want to have certainty.

7

QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Minear, I take it that if

8

there is accretion or erosion through natural causes, the

9

boundary is ambulatory?
MR. MINEAR:

10

That is generally true, although

11

this is a matter that is changing, as this Court issues

12

particular decrees with respect to - QUESTION:

13
14

But absent the decree, the Government

agrees that the land would be ambulatory in that case?

15

MR. MINEAR:

The land would be ambulatory except

16

that where disclaimers are in effect or where this Court

17

has entered a decree fixing a boundary.

19

Federal/State boundary.
QUESTION:

Now that is

Would you have authority, would the

21

Government have authority to tell Alaska that it's going

time?

11

inconsistent with the notion that was expressed in Nollan

12

that a permit condition should be closely related to the

reason why the Government could deny the permit.

At a broader sense, this seems

MR. MINEAR:

We think as a general matter that

3

is a policy that is also of interest to the Army, but what

4

the Army does here is that it looks to the consequences of

5

the building of the structure.

6

State has received exactly those lands that were granted

7

under the Submerged Lands Act.

8

9

As it stands now, the

The building of a structure would in fact reduce
the United States' grant of lands under the Outer

10

Continental Shelf Lands Act; that is a factor that the

11

Corps should be allowed to take into account.

12

If the structure actually went the in other

13

direction, if it actually diminished the lands that the

14

State presently owns with respect to the Submerged Lands

15

Act, then the Army would take that factor into account,

16

and the basis for that would be the policy that is set

17

forth in the Submerged Lands Act.

QUESTION:

The Government doesn't end up with

19

any net loss, right?

20

at one end and picks it up at the other end.

causeway.
Now the Secretary's consideration of the effect

3

of the proposed structure and the location of the causeway

4

is simply one part of its public interest review process.

5

As the Secretary's regulations recognize, the location of

6

the coastline has great significance because it can

7

determine the location of international and Federal/State

8

boundaries, and even where foreign relations concerns are
absent, a shift in the location of the coastline can, as

10

in this case, divest the United States of its interests in

11

the outer continental shelf.

12

Congress has stated that the outer continental

13

shelf is a vital national resource reserve, held by the

14

Federal Government for the public.

15

proper for the Secretary to consider, as one element of

16

the public interest review, the effect of a proposed

17

structure on the location of the coastline.

18

Thus, it is entirely

In the absence of such a review, portions of a

1

vital national resource reserve would be transferred

20

without any formal Government consideration from Federal

21

to State hands.

22

The Secretary's public interest review process,

23

including his consideration of the effects of the proposed

24

structure on the location of the coastline, reflects a

25

commitment to faithful execution of the law.

It ensures

1

the Secretary takes full account of all of Congress'

2

policies before he authorizes construction that can impact

3

on a wide variety of public concerns.

4

It is also consistent with this Court's decision

5

in California II, which recognized that the United States

6

has the ability to protect itself from artificial changes

7

in the coastline through its power over navigable waters.

8

Furthermore, it produces a sensible result.

In

9

this instance, the City of Nome applied for a permit to

10

construct port facilities projecting more than 1/2 mile

11

into Norton Sound.

12

with the Solicitor of the Interior Department that the

13

resulting change in the coastline would divest the United

14

States of potentially valuable mineral resources.

15

The Army learned through consultation

The Army therefore reasonably insisted that a

16

permit would not be issued unless Alaska entered into an

17

agreement preserving the existing Federal/State boundary.

18

The Army was entitled to deny the permit because of the

19

adverse affect that the construction would have on the

20

location for the boundary.

QUESTION:

As a matter of curiosity, Mr, Minear,

that a permit has been issued for gold prospecting as

MR. MINEAR:

They occur in several respects.

2

The clearest example is in the case of the Gulf side coast

3

of Florida and the coast of Texas.

4

those States, they received a grant of 3 marine leagues

5

rather than 3 miles of submerged lands.

6

In the case of both of

This Court determined in United States

7

v. Louisiana that the coastline for the purpose of that

8

grant would be determined on the basis of the coastline at

9

the time of admission and would not include any subsequent

10
11

artificial structures.
More recently, we stipulated to a coastline, a

12

baseline for the purposes of closing the Chandeleur Sound

13

off the coast of the State of Mississippi and that

14

baseline also was not necessarily the same as the baseline

15

that would be established for international purposes.

16

Alaska is also mistaken in arguing that

17

California II's discussion of the United States' control

18

over navigable waters was made in reference to Congress'

19

constitutional power over navigation rather than the

20

Army's permitting authority.

Thank

Very well, Mr. Minear.

MR. GISSBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

17

We believe that the Army Corps' disclaimer

18

practice is open-ended and mandatory and missing the

19

essence of the Submerged Lands Act and also some

20

fundamental principles of Government in this country.

21

This causes them to badly misjudge the public interest in

22

both law and in fact.

24

Shelf Lands Act or the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation

25

Act of 1899 causes any other result.

In essence, this is simply a case of statutory

1

2

construction, whether the Army has the statutory authority

3

to require a disclaimer that fixes a State's seaward

4

boundary at a line that is different from the 3 miles from

5

the coastline that was granted to the States by Congress

6

in the Submerged Lands Act.

I thought your position went farther

than that, that whether or not it extends the coastline or

extends a State line, the boundary, whether or not it does

QUESTION:

But the logic of your position, Mr.

13

Gissberg, is that assuming a particular project does not

powerless to prevent a State from artificially extending

16

its coastline for the very purpose of gaining title to

17

submerged lands in some valuable area.

9

Structures are built or parties apply to build

10

the physical and legal.

that once an artificial structure is built in a navigable

change the boundary if it is a consequence of the building

respect to Federal - QUESTION:

2

Mr. Minear, do I understand that the

3

policy of the Corps of Engineers now would be that even if

4

a private landowner wanted to repair or construct a dock

5

on the shoreline, that permission would be given only if

6

the State in which it is located executes some kind of

7

waiver?

8

MR. MINEAR:

9

QUESTION:

10

Not necessarily.
Is that the universal policy to be

followed now by the Corps?
MR. MINEAR:

11

This refers to harbor works.

A

12

dock that does not have a low water mark would not affect

13

a change in the coastline for purposes of the Submerged

14

La.nds Act.

That was decided in California III.

15

So we are talking about primarily very large

16

structures, causeways, other major buildings that will

17

have a significant effect, and in fact, our records

18

indicate there have been about 17 instances since 1970

19

where this problem has arisen.

20

Now with respect to Justice Stevens' observation

21

that the State could build a structure simply to obtain

22

offshore lands, imagine that consequence in the case of

known mineral resources that are located there. This could

seems illogical to say that we couldn't condition it, I
