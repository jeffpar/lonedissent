ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. HALL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

The issue presented on review in this case is

13

appeal to the courts of appeals from an order entered by

In addition, section 1292(b) had been applied to
bankruptcy cases prior to 1978.

subsection (b) since 1958, and prior to that, what is now
subsection (a) concerning injunctive orders had been
applied in the bankruptcy context previously.
To reach the conclusion -QUESTION:

How much weight do you think those

pre-bankruptcy code enactment provision -- cases have?
MS. HALL:

I believe they're important, Mr.

Chief Justice, because they demonstrate that there was an
existing scheme, which recognized jurisdiction in the
courts of appeals under section 1292 as well as other
sections which granted jurisdiction of bankruptcy cases.
QUESTION:

But the bankruptcy court was tied

much more closely to the district court before the
enactment of the Bankruptcy Code, wasn't it?
MS. HALL:

That is correct, although, the

bankruptcy court is still described in the '84 legislation
as a unit of the district court.

And because of Marathon,

it must rest on the Article 3 power of the district court.
Although the system has changed, it is not that great a
difference in that the House's view of creating Article 3
independent courts never prevailed in Congress.
These cases, pre-1978, teach us that there was
recognized jurisdiction and existing jurisdictional scheme
under 1292, as well as other sections, and that therefore,
to reach the result that the court of appeals below

reached would require you to conclude that Congress
intended to take away that jurisdictional grant, that
discretionary, interlocutory appellate power, and that it
intended to treat bankruptcy cases in a manner different
than it treats all other civil actions.
Now this is a dramatic result to be reached,
particularly in the face of no evidence to support such a
result or such a conclusion.

And it makes no sense to

conclude that Congress would intend to do that when there
was before Congress no particular problem faced by 1292
interlocutory appeals in the bankruptcy context, there was
not abuse alleged or pointed to, no problem identified
that would be a basis or a reason for making this change.
QUESTION:

Ms. Hall, why do you suppose Congress

enacted section 158(d) if the courts of appeal already had
jurisdiction?

Why did they need it?

And is it just

superfluous in your view?
MS. HALL:

In part it was needed because of

initially the House's desire to create the bankruptcy
appellate panels.

In section 1293, which is the origin of

158(d), the House wrote section 1293 in order to create
two additional bases in the courts of appeals that had not
previously existed.

That is, final decisional review of

appeals from bankruptcy panels, which of course were new
creations, and also to permit the consensual direct appeal

on final orders only directly from the bankruptcy court,
which had been a desire of the House.
When section 158(d) was written in 1984, it took
both 1293 as well as other sections -- 1482, concerning
bankruptcy panels, and 1334, which concerned the district
court -- appeals up from the bankruptcy court to the
district courts -- and put them together in 158.
To answer the second part of your question
directly, there is a redundancy.

Other than the grant of

jurisdiction to the bankruptcy panels, which appears in
(d),

(d) is repetitive in part of the grant of

jurisdiction to the courts of appeals under 1291.
However, a mere redundancy where there is no
conflict between the provisions, in other words, you can
apply both 158(d) to a core jurisdiction to the courts of
appeals, and you can apply 1291, and achieve this exact
same result.

There will be jurisdiction on final

decisions in the courts of appeals.
There is further no reason to conclude that
Congress would wish to treat bankruptcy appeal different
because the purpose served by 1292(b), in particular when
it was enacted, the purpose it sought to address is just
as pertinent in bankruptcy cases as it is in all other
civil cases.
The limited discretionary appeal that was

5

Congress settled upon, finally in 1984, that its desire to

court, necessarily results in that.

However, those two steps also find a

QUESTION:

Yeah, but Congress might have felt

10

that once is enough to have to go through all of that, and

11

that the usual reasons for allowing interlocutory appeal,

when there's only one, are out weighed by the fact that

you'd have to do it double if you do it in this area.

unlike, for example, the Expediting Act.

It does not say

these are the only appeals, it merely makes an affirmative
statement of appellate jurisdictional grant.
Therefore, you must find an implied appeal.

And

implied repeals are drastic and rare results, as taught by
the precedents in this Court.

And I would submit that in

this case, the requirements of meeting such a test of
implied repeal are woefully lacking.
First, there is no irreconcilability, as I
pointed out before.

with 1291, provides for exactly the same result.

So they

Second, the second alternative,

which requires that the later enacted statute be
comprehensive and be a substitute for the earlier alleged
to be repealed statutes, also does not pertain here.
Clearly, 158(d) is not a comprehensive substitute for 1291
and 1292.

Otherwise we are left with no general grant of

jurisdiction to the courts of appeals from decisions of
the district court.
Even if, however, we were to get by one of these
two requirements for implied repeals, we are still met
with the problem of where is the evidence of Congress1

Nor can it

be found in the legislative history.

This is a case where

we have in the legislative history two reports, both
written before this section was crafted.

Neither of those

reports support a conclusion of a clear and manifest
intent to stop the process of interlocutory appeals short
of the court of appeals and to strip them of this
discretionary power bo hear an interlocutory appeal.
Now the Second Circuit found an intent by
Congress in this same legislative history.

I would

suggest, however, that the second circuit took a course
which this Court has counselled against strongly and has
disfavored, and that is that the Second Circuit relied
upon new, unexplained intermediate steps going back and
forth between the House and the Congress, and also upon
silence, the absence of words in 158(d).

Neither of those

have been found in the past to support a finding or a
demonstration of clear and manifest intent.
The trustee here is faced with a difficult
problem.

If he urges on this Court that you must support

his position and find that the redundancy in 158(d)
requires the result that 1292 will no longer will apply in
bankruptcy cases, and at the bottom of that position is
the redundancy, then he must answer the question of what
is to be done with the language found in section 305 of
the Bankruptcy Code, as enacted by Congress in 1990.

As I've indicated, in conclusion, the plain

words of 1292(b) would provide discretionary jurisdiction

It is not a clear

10

statement by the Congress that it meant to change an

11

existing jurisdictional grant to the courts of appeals.

12-

The words of the statute do not support such a result, the

13

purpose of the Bankruptcy Code does not support such a

14

result, and the legislative history is silent.

15

Thus, this Court ought to interpret the plain

16

words of the statute, 1292, to find jurisdiction in the

Courts of appeals, and to conclude that 158(d) does not

plainly express a congressional intent to alter the pre­

MR. GERMAIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9

I believe, and it's the respondent's position,

10

that his whole case revolves around the fact that if the

11

petitioner's position is accepted, there was no reason for

12

Congress to enact section 158(d) insofar as it applied to

13

district court jurisdiction.

14

And the first thing I would like to do is

15

address myself to Justice O'Connor's question that was

16

directed to the attorney for the petitioner.

17

O'Connor asked what reason there would be for the passage

of this statute, opposing counsel indicated that 158(d)

19

did cover the situation for appeals of the bankruptcy

support of the statutory rule of interpretation, I think,

2

would limit the effect or limit the burden that the

3

respondent has in order to overcome that.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Germain, it seems to me another

5

response to the seeming anomaly of not being able to take

6

an interlocutory appeal from the bankruptcy panel,

7

although you can take it from the district court under the

8

petitioner's interpretation, is that you wouldn't be

9

before the bankruptcy panel, except voluntarily.

You have

10

to accede to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy panel, and

11

when you do, you know that one of the things that goes

12

along with it is that you can't get an interlocutory

13

appeal.

14

Why isn't that fair enough?
MR. GERMAIN:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

15

that still wouldn't resolve the situation where if this

16

issue was important enough - -

17

QUESTION:

No, right, you'd still be left with

18

the fact that you could not take an interlocutory appeal.

19

But still the fact that it's been voluntarily assumed is a

20

basis for distinguishing that from the appeal from the

21

district court.

22

MR. GERMAIN:

It may be, but it still doesn't

23

answer the question of why 158(d) includes district court

24

jurisdiction in addition to the jurisdiction for the

25

interlocutory panels.

Another reason that was relied upon a great deal

2

by the petitioner in this case was the fact that the clear

language of the statute itself would support its position,

4

that 1292 does provide for interlocutory appeal of

5

district court orders.

-- the language of 1292, when that is considered with the

QUESTION:

What the petitioner asks you to do is

And I think

How do you read it in relation to

305(c)?
10

MR. GERMAIN:

305 --

I think the argument

11

that's made by the petitioner in their case is that 305(c)

12

is inconsistent with the respondent's position.

13

think that's correct.

Another amended basis of the petitioner's

arguments in this case is the fact that it would be

unreasonable for Congress, or to expect Congress to have

wanted to accomplish this by the passage of 158(d) because

11

of the way or because of the result that they would result

in.

13

enough that you may want interlocutory review of

position is accepted.

17

The fact that there are matters that are important

I would suggest that when you look at the law

18

concerning what concerns or what involves a final decision

19

in the bankruptcy matter, and also the fact that court of

Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy,

6

don't think -- the fact that mandamus is available would

make it a substitute for the right of appeal that the

petitioner claims exists.
MR. GERMAIN:

9

You know, our cases say it's not

Absolutely not.

I mean, I

It would not be a

substitute.

11

in this case is that there is reasons, other reasons that

Congress may have wanted to limited the review by the

in an extraordinary situation where this would cause a

saying that there is a substitute for it would be

What this is is that

And

1

there are good reasons for doing that.
Even though it is recognized by the Court that

2

3

there are reasons for permitting appeals of interlocutory

4

orders, it was also recognized that there is a cost to

5

this.

6

have a bankruptcy estate, where there are important

7

policies for encouraging expeditious administration of it.
And in fact, by only permitting review or

8

9

This cost may be magnified in a situation where you

appellate review of final decisions rather than

10

interlocutory decisions, you have situations where because

11

of many reasons these reviews may not become necessary for

12

the bankruptcy estate, or a situation where if the

13

bankruptcy estate is forced to appeal this issue, at least

14

it can go up to the level and have all of the issues

15

resolved, rather than trying to do it on a piecemeal

16

basis.

17

In this case, if there is a final decision in

18

this and there is a subsequent appeal, the bankruptcy

estate would have been forced to go up through the

20

appellate process twice, instead of simply having all of

21

the issues presented at one time, with the saving of time

22

and expense to the bankruptcy estate.

policy reasons that are advanced by the petitioner.

2

Really, the basis of the argument is based upon the fact

3

that there was no reason for 158(d) to be passed if you

4

accept the petitioner's interpretation of.

5

These policy reasons that I'm presenting to the

6

Court are simply to counter the arguments presented by the

7

petitioner and suggested in other cases or in other court

8

of appeals that have considered this issue, that in fact

9

it may be unreasonable to find the interpretation advanced

10

by the respondent because there is no reason for it.

11

There are reasons for it, and therefore, I think that even

12

though the basis of it is the structure of 158(d) and the

13

fact that there's no reason to have passed it

14

without -- if the petitioner's argument is accepted, these

arguments do counter the petitioner's argument and the

court of appeal arguments that are presented, that there

Do you contend, Mr. Germain, that

4

The question is -- and all

The question is, is then once you get to the

5

district court, what happens after that?

6

by the petitioner is that 1291 and 1292 would cover that,

7

as well as 158(d), and there's -- if you just consider

8

that without -- if 158(d) had never been passed, there may

9

have been some merit to that argument.

Now the argument

You go from the

10

bankruptcy court to the district court under 158(a), then

11

1291 and 1292 take over and govern the further appeals of

12

that.

13

that would be the obvious system that you would adopt

14

under the language of the statute.

15

is, is that instead of just leaving that the way it was,

16

Congress in fact did pass 158(d).

17

And in fact if Congress has never passed 158(d),

QUESTION:

The problem with it

Do you think 158(d) wholly supersedes

orders from the district court and the court of appeals?
MR. GERMAIN:

20

Yes.

To the -- two reasons for

21

that.

It supersedes 1291, which really doesn't have great

22

effect, because basically all it does is repeat 1291.

can't obtain the same thing that's stated in 1291 because

you do appeals of final judgments and orders from the

the natural presumption of that is that 1292 also doesn't

I don't think it's necessary to

That's what I thought.

20

QUESTION:

Well, for purposes of 1292(b), if the

21

interlocutory appeal is heard by the bankruptcy panel, I

22

take it you do have some problem with 1292(b) because it

23

requires certification by a district judge.

Well, that's correct.

I mean, the

plain language of 1292(b) only applies to district court.

1

Now there was a position raised by this Court that the

2

fact that it's voluntary may be reason why we don't allow

3

appeals to the court of appeals, but the fact is, is that

4

1292(b) clearly by the plain language of it would not

5

provide for the interlocutory - - appeal of an

6

interlocutory order up to the circuit court of appeals.

7

Further support for the respondent's position is

8

also found in the legislative history of section 158's

9

predecessor, section 1293.

Even though 1293 never became

10

effective during the time that it was enacted, in fact, it

11

is clear from the courts that have considered it that 1293

12

was basically a predecessor of 158, and that the

13

legislative history, in cases interpreting that, can be

14

applied to 158.

15

The legislative history was specifically set out

16

in detail in the Second Circuit Court of opinion, which

17

noted that in fact the version of that statute immediately

18

prior to its passage did not have any provision as it was

19

contained in section 158(d), which provided for the appeal

20

to the circuit court of appeals of only final judgments,

21

orders, or decrees.

And in fact, that was added later on.

22

I would suggest to the Court that though this is

23

no where near as important as the original argument for my

24

interpretation, the fact that there was no reason to pass

25

158(d) if you provide for appellate coverage under 1292,

it adds further support to the respondent's position.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANET C. HALL

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MS..HALL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

First, in response to some questions about the

16

bankruptcy appellate panels.

In addition to them being

17

consensual courses of appeal for the litigants, there's

18

another important aspect of the bankruptcy appellate

19

panels, which the district court decision does not give

20

us.

21

constituted on a circuit-wide basis.

22

the circuit, and presumably their decisions have

23

precedential value on a circuit-wide basis, which is, as I

24

pointed out in my argument, a benefit of the 1292(b)

25

appeal.

And that is they are constituted or meant to be
They are created by

1

important question, the benefit to be achieved from

2

1292(b) is not only to advance the litigation that's

3

before the court of appeals, but also to attempt to settle

4

an unsettled question of law which will have precedential

5

value on a circuit-wide basis.
The bankruptcy panels do satisfy that purpose,

6

7

and thus the fact that the appeal stops with the

8

bankruptcy appellate panel at the interlocutory level is

9

at least understandable and distinct from the suggestion

10

that it should stop at the district court level, which not

11

only doesn't offer a panel or appellate review, but is of

12

little precedential value -- in fact none, I would

13

suggest -- beyond the case before the district court.

14

QUESTION: ‘The standard by which a court of

15

appeals decides to accept submission under 1292(b), it's

16

whether the issue would be dispositive in the particular

17

case, isn't it?

A controlling question of law?

MS. HALL:

18

That is the standard by which the

19

district court must first certify the appeal to even be

20

considered by the court of appeals.

21

Justice.

22

the statue, discretion to take the appeal, presumably if

23

it does not think it's a controlling issue of law which

24

will advance the litigation, it will not exercise that

25

discretion.

Yes, Mr. Chief

The court of appeals then has, in the words of

QUESTION:

1

But there's nothing indicating that a

2

court of appeals must look for something of general

3

importance in that question is there, beyond the

4

particular case?

5

MS. HALL:

Only in the words of the statute

6

which address the fact that it not only be controlling,

7

which presumably speaks in terms of that litigation, but

8

that it be a question as to which it is unsettled.

9

other words, the words, I believe are, that there are

10

substantial grounds for difference of opinion.
QUESTION:

case it should be something of general importance.

opponent in response to a question, Justice, about section

16

305.

17

which are district court orders, and therefore, it does

18

make sense that the amendment in 1990 to the abstention

19

section, which is 1334(c), would include 1291 and 1292.

20

Most courts have felt that 1291 and 2 are still in place

21

for district-court originated bankruptcy cases.

22

He - - his response concerned the abstention orders

However, that does not address the section 305,

23

which is the dismissal or suspension orders, which are

24

clearly orders that can be entered by a bankruptcy court.

And that would be under

14

QUESTION:

And 305 applies only to bankruptcy

courts, not to district courts.
MS. HALL:

I don't think that's exactly correct.

15

I believe that you could have a case in the district court

16

that had not been referred under 157(c).

17

QUESTION:

Well, then that would explain why you

18

had to refer to both 158(d) and 1295 and 1292, for those

19

cases that might arise -- might be coming up from the

20

district court.

Those first appeared in section 1293.

And although they were not explained when they appeared,

3

if you look at the structure of 1293 when enacted and when

4

drafted, which is set forth at page 24 and 25 of my brief,

you will see that the district court reference gets

the word district court was entered in (b), it could be
