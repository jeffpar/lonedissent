CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Dyk.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY B. DYK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DYK:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The question in this Chapter 7 bankruptcy case

10
11

is whether section 522(1) of the code, which provides for

12

the raising of challenges to exemptions, in combination

13

with Bankruptcy Rule 4003, which generally requires that

14

that objection be made within 30 days after the meeting of

15

creditors, is an absolute bar as, the Third Circuit held

16

in this case, to a challenge to the exemption raised at a

17

later time.
There is a conflict in the circuits on this

18
19

issue.

There are three different positions that the lower

20

Federal courts have taken.

21

Circuit in this case, which held that the 30-day period is

22

an absolute bar, a second line of cases that the court at

23

a later time can reexamine the exemption de novo, and a

24

third line of cases holding that after the 30-day period

25

the exemption may be challenged if it lacks a good faith

1

statutory basis.

2

We are urging in this case that the Court adopt

3

this third position, which is represented by decisions of

4

the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits.

5

In a bankruptcy case the first act is the filing

6

of the petition by the debtor, and at the same time that

7

the petition is filed the debtor will also file a schedule

8

of assets and a list of claimed exemptions, and in this

9

case when the petition was filed on October 24th, 1984,

10

the debtor made a claim of exemption for a lawsuit which

11

she had pending against TWA, and she characterized it in

12

the schedules as a claim for lost wages with the value

13

unknown.

14

the State system.

15

the commonwealth court to affirm a judgment in her favor,

16

and the case had been briefed and argued before the

17

Pennsylvania supreme court.

18

At that time, the case had wound its way through
She had been successful in convincing

Within the time allowed in the code, the trustee

19

appointed by the court, the petitioner in this case, held

20

a meeting of creditors as he was required to do and

21

examined the debtor about her assets, and in particular

22

about this claim, and noted at the time that this was a

23

possible asset case, meaning there were possible assets

24

here to satisfy the claims of creditors, that asset being

25

the claim against TWA, and shortly after the meeting of

1

creditors he wrote to counsel for the debtor and advised

2

them that he considered this claim to be an asset of the

3

estate, i.e., that he considered it to be nonexempt.

4

The claim continued and ultimately was resolved

5

by settlement in favor of the debtor, and she collected

6

approximately $110,000, and the question now is, the case

7

having remained open for this time for the express purpose

8

of pursuing this claim, whether the trustee in bankruptcy

9

can now go after these proceeds, which were allowed to him

10

in the amount of $23,000 here by the bankruptcy court --

11

can go after these proceeds to satisfy the claims of

12

creditors.

13

Now, the contention is by the respondents and

14

the holding of the Third Circuit is that that is not

15

permissible because section 522(1) of the Bankruptcy Code

16

says that if there's no objection filed within 30 days

17

after the creditors meeting that the property claimed as

18

exempt is exempt.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. DYK:

21

22

23

Is that in the code?
That is in the code, in 522(1) of the

code.
The time period -- 30-day time period is not
specified in the code but in - -

24

QUESTION: That's what I wanted to know.

25

MR. DYK:

Yes, that's in Bankruptcy Rule 4003.

1

It specifies the 30-day period.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Dyk, do you claim that all of the

3

recovery is open for the trustee to seek recovery?

4

thought you thought only a portion of it was recoverable.

5

MR. DYK:

I

We have only pursued a portion of it,

6

and the Bankruptcy Court only allowed a portion of it to

7

be reached, the $23,000, but I think that at the time that

8

the bankruptcy petition was filed that there was a strong

9

argument that all of that could be reached, even the part

10

covered by attorney's fees, because there was no equitable

11

lien with respect to the claim itself, but only an

12

equitable lien under State law that would have arisen

13

after the proceeds were received.

14

QUESTION:

But I guess as the case comes to us

15

we don't have to get into that.

16

portion of it.

17

MR. DYK:

We deal only with a

The judgment of this Court would only

18

determine a portion of it, and we're only claiming the

19

right to the $23,000.

20

case were only $11,000, so the $23,000 will be sufficient

21

to cover that and the administrative expenses.
QUESTION:

22

23

Did you argue the application of the

new sentence in section 105 in the court below?

25

The claims of the creditors in this

No, that was not argued in the court

1

argued in the court below here.
QUESTION:

2

3

So it's being urged for the first

time here.

4

MR. DYK:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor, and

5

we believe that's appropriate, because what the second

6

sentence of section 105(a) says is that no provision of

7

the code shall be construed to prevent a challenge based

8

on an abuse of process, and the question of whether 522(1)

9

was a bar to the trustee's claim here was something that

10

was heatedly contested in the lower court, and we're

11

merely saying in this Court that section 105(a) instructs

12

as to how to interpret section 522(1).

13
14

QUESTION:

If it were to apply, how do you think

abuse of process should be defined?

15

MR. DYK:

Well, I think it certainly doesn't

16

mean abuse of process in the common law sense, but if you

17

look at Prosser or the Restatement of Torts, abuse of

18

process in the common law sense would be, for example,

19

using a writ of sequestration to get property or the

20

improper issuance of criminal process, or the use of

21

process to commence an improper civil action.
QUESTION:

22

You think that the claiming of an

23

exemption which the statute doesn't allow is an abuse of

24

process?

25

MR. DYK:

I think it is an abuse of process not

1

in the common law sense but in the sense that this Court

2

has used the term abuse of process, for example, in the

3

Cooter & Gell case.

4

105(a) is not the conferring of a right of action on the

5

trustee or the party of interest.

6

common law right of action, it's simply saying that the

7

time limits of the code will not be enforced if there's an

8

abuse of process.

9

What is involved here in section

It's not conferring a

I think there are some interesting comparisons

10

that can be made between these provisions of the

11

bankruptcy rules that govern here and the Federal Rules of

12

Civil Procedure, and in some respects that's a rather

13

exact parallel.

14

Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, if a

15

complaint is filed and allegations in the complaint are

16

not controverted under Rule 8(d) of the Federal Rules of

17

Civil Procedure the allegations of the complaint are to be

18

taken as true, and I think one could look at 522(1) as

19

essentially saying the same thing, that if a claim is made

20

for an exemption and there's no timely objection to that,

21

that the exemption will be taken as established, but just

22

as under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that that is

23

not the end of the matter, so, too, we suggest that under

24

the Bankruptcy Code that's not the end of the matter,

25

either.

In other words, that merely because you file a

1

2

late answer doesn't mean that the court does not have the

3

power to come in and give relief from a default later on

4

in the course of the proceedings.
QUESTION:

5
6

What is the process that is abused

here, the filing by the debtor claiming the exemption?
MR. DYK:

7

Well, Chief Justice, we're not

8

suggesting that the term abuse of process was used here in

9

the common law sense.
QUESTION:

10

We suggest that it was meant -Well, no, but surely -- I mean, when

11

you say abuse of process, there's a verb and a preposition

12

and a noun, and the noun is process, and what is the

13

process?

14

MR. DYK:

The claim is that the abuse of process

15

was the act of filing the list of exemptions and making a

16

claim of exemption that did not have a good faith

17

statutory basis.

18

QUESTION:

19

form of process, in your view.

20

MR. DYK:

So the listing of exemptions is a

Not of the common law, but within the

21

scope of section 105(a).

There's no -- we suggest that if

22

you look at section 105(a) there's no question but that in

23

dispensing with these time limits where there's an abuse

24

of process that Congress was concerned with the situation

25

in which improper claims or claims without reasonable

1

2

basis
QUESTION:

But the first sentence, Mr. Dyk,

3

begins the court may issue any order, process, or

4

judgment, and that suggests that they're talking about

5

process in the sense of something of a writ, or something

6

that the court issues.

7

MR. DYK:

Well, I think that the language of the

8

second sentence, which refers to no provision of this

9

title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in

10

interest, shall be construed to preclude the court from

11

sua sponde taking any action or making any determination

12

necessary or appropriate to prevent an abuse of process.

13

The language of that sentence suggests to us

14

that what they were talking about was a concern with the

15

time limits in the code and the language fits rather

16

exactly with section 522(1), and what they are suggesting

17

is that the time limit would result in an abuse of process

18

in the sense of a bad faith claim, or something of that

19

sort, that the claim would have power to excuse.

20

We don't think that section 105(a) really made

21

any change with respect to the inherent powers of the

22

bankruptcy courts in this area, and in fact there is

23

authority that even before this provision in the code,

24

even under the old Bankruptcy Act, that the bankruptcy

25

courts did have equitable powers in this area to do the

1

sort of thing that we are urging should be done in this

2

case.
QUESTION:

3

Under your submission, Mr. Dyk, I

4

take it it becomes relevant whether there's a colorable

5

basis for the claim, or a reasonable basis for the claim,

6

and my concern is is that that propels us into something

7

of a collateral inquiry, and this case illustrates the

8

point.

9

it illustrates the point.

The issue isn't really presented in this case, but

MR. DYK:

10

Isn't front pay exempt?

Front pay, to the extent it's

11

necessary for the support of the debtor, would be exempt.

12

Back pay is not exempt.

13

QUESTION:

So it seems to me that in this case

14

if she thought there was a possibility of front pay that

15

that was the basis for claiming the exemption.

16

MR. DYK:

If that were the case, that would be

17

true, but I think that the record pretty clearly

18

establishes first of all that the claim at the time of the

19

bankruptcy filing was worth $110,000 and the later

20

calculations made at the time of the settlement show that

21

only approximately even as of that time only about

22

30 percent of that claim was for front pay as opposed to

23

back pay.

24

QUESTION:

25

would be exempt, would it not?

But then to that extent at least it

11

1

MR. DYK:

It would be exempt to the extent that

2

it was a claim for front pay, but after all at the time of

3

the filing of the bankruptcy petition the award of the

4

Pittsburgh Human Relations Commission that was being

5

defended had a provision in it that she would recover from

6

the time that she was discriminated against up until the

7

time that her class of supervisor was no longer employed

8

by TWA in Pittsburgh, and that was a date before the

9

filing of the bankruptcy petition.

10

So if you just looked at the Human Relations

11

Commission decision there wouldn't have been any award of

12

front pay but merely an award of back pay for the period

13

before the filing of the bankruptcy petition.

14

QUESTION:

But at a minimum does not this

15

illustrate the complexity and the difficulty of enforcing

16

the rule that you propose?

17

MR. DYK:

Well, I think that there can be

18

situations in which it is complex, but it is not such an

19

unusual thing, after all, under Rule 11, and there is an

20

equivalent of Rule 11 in the bankruptcy rules which is

21

section 9011 that the courts routinely make this kind of

22

determination and make a determination as to whether

23

claims have a reasonable basis.

24

standard that we are urging here that ought to be applied

25

under section 522 and section 105(a).

That is essentially the

QUESTION:

1

Do you have any idea, Mr. Dyk, what

2

percentage of people filing for bankruptcy are represented

3

by attorneys when they file as opposed to, say, people who

4

start civil law suits in the Federal courts?

5

MR. DYK:

I don't know the answer to that,

6

Mr. Chief Justice, but one of the problems here is that

7

the bankruptcy courts are inundated with this filings.

8

Last year there were 880,000 bankruptcy filings, 291

9

bankruptcy judges to deal with all of those filings, and a

10

real need on the part of the bankruptcy courts to rely on

11

the good faith of debtors in claiming exemptions,

12

otherwise the whole system would collapse.

13
14

QUESTION:

the filings involve a trustee?

MR. DYK:

He did not do what he should have done

19

debtor's counsel handling this TWA case for her and

20

advised them specifically of his position.

court, but everybody knew what the trustee's position was

at the time, and the bankruptcy court was made aware of

3

it, too, but these kinds of slip-ups are going to occur

4

when you have this many bankruptcy proceedings.

5

At the time that this case was going on, the

trustee here had approximately two or three hundred of

7

these cases a year, which I think is typical of bankruptcy

trustees all across the country.

QUESTION:

1

What if it had been closed, Mr. Dyk?

2

What if the whole bankruptcy proceeding had been closed?

3

You'd be making the same argument anyway, wouldn't you?

4

mean, I don't see that this provision -- does this

5

provision say as long as 105(a)

6

when the proceeding is still open?

7
8

MR. DYK:

I

-- does that apply only

Well, I would think it would only

apply while the proceeding was still open.

9

QUESTION:
MR. DYK:

10

Why is that?
Well, if you look at the bankruptcy

11

proceeding as being parallel to ordinary civil proceedings

12

in the Federal courts the filing of the petition is like a

13

complaint, the objection to the exemption is like the

14

answer, and then the closing of the case is like final

15

judgment in the case, so if after the closing of the case

16

there were a desire to reopen the judgment in a sense, one

17

would have to proceed under the bankruptcy rule.

18

It's equivalent to Rule 60(b) of the Federal

19

Rules of Civil Procedure, and that rule is bankruptcy rule

20

9024, but -- and there's another rule, 5010, which

21

provides for the reopening of closed cases, but in other

22

words you would have to take this additional step of

23

technical objection but he did write to the lawyers and he

did know there was a problem there and kept the case open

MR. DYK:

You say the case could be

Well, I wasn't suggesting that the

16

case could be opened without a very substantial showing.

I mean, it's like the reopening of a judgment under

2

Mere bad faith wouldn't be sufficient.

3

Now, it's true that under the bankruptcy rule

4

and the Bankruptcy Code they don't have the same strict

5

time limits of Rule 60(b), but we would agree, and I think

6

that the interpretation of the rules and cases would

support that, that this would have to be within a

8

reasonable time.

QUESTION:

Arguably, you would also have to make

provision of the Federal Rules, would be an appropriate

18

gloss on this, and if you look back to the equity practice

19

before the adoption of Rule 55, which would govern both

20

the bankruptcy courts and Federal courts, I think there

21

would need to be some showing of good cause necessary for

that kind of reopening.

1

to set aside a default before the entry of judgment, and

2

the good cause requirement under Rule 55 is interpreted as

3

being essentially a three-part test, that there be a

4

meritorious defense, no prejudice to the other party and

5

no bad faith by the party seeking to reopen the judgment,

6

and so we would suggest that that might be the way that

7

good cause would be defined, and if that were defined in

8

that way, we would think that the trustee in this case

9

would easily satisfy it.
QUESTION:

10

Do we really want to import that much

11

of the rather complicated Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

12

into bankruptcy proceedings?

13

MR. DYK:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think

14

that we're suggesting that we import the Federal Rules of

15

Civil Procedure into the bankruptcy proceedings.

16

what I'm suggesting is that there are two bases here for

17

reading 522(1) as not being an absolute bar.

18

I think

One is the specific language of section 105(a),

19

which allows the courts to dispense -- expressly allows

20

the courts to dispense with the time limits where there's

21

an abuse of process, and that in turn is based on the

22

historic equity powers of the bankruptcy courts to reopen

23

while the case is still pending based on a showing of good

24

cause.

carry over at least concepts from the Federal Rules of

Civil Procedure, and it seems to me if we carry over two

or three in this case the next case we're going to be

asked to carry over some more, and pretty soon we won't

know what concepts from the Federal Rules of Civil

Procedure apply in bankruptcy and which don't.

7

MR. DYK:

Well, it's not so - - the suggestion

8

that I'm making, Mr. Chief Justice, is not so foreign to

9

the Bankruptcy Code.

Section 9006 of the bankruptcy rules

10

is a very close parallel and was modeled after rule 6 of

11

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and it is rule 9006

12

of the Bankruptcy Code that the respondents are relying on

13

here to say that the court cannot extend the time for

14

filing the objections after the 30-day time period has

15

run, so there is an exact parallel here between --

16

QUESTION:

But there you have a bankruptcy rule

17

that very closely tracks a Federal Rule of Civil

18

Procedure, but it strikes me some of your argument, or

19

your rule based on 8(d) and 55 and 60(b), you're just

20

drawing analogies without any real reference point in the

21

Bankruptcy Code.

22

MR. DYK:

Well, the reference point in the

23

Bankruptcy Code, Mr. Chief Justice, would be the

24

provisions of section 105, which for a long time have

25

confirmed the continuing power of the bankruptcy courts to

I'm not suggesting that the specific provisions

of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure be imported in

here and applied to bankruptcy.

5

those Rules of Civil Procedure to some extent are modeled

retain these inherent equitable powers to reexamine

actions that were taken in the course of proceedings.

The language is not ambiguous, nor has petitioner argued

14

He did make known his objection.
MR. SIMON:

to say a creditor may object, he does not have to object,

QUESTION:

Although it was wholly consistent

with his letter 3-1/2 years before.
MR. SIMON:

To some extent.

letter that the net proceeds of the cause of action were

14

unlikely there would be a recovery and did not choose to

15

exempt, or object to the exemption, or he just failed to

16

take action for some other cause.

17

QUESTION:

That was before the exemption to
There was really no way to

Mr. Simon, your finality requirement

would simply be satisfied by the finality of the closing

of the case, wouldn't it?

MR. SIMON:

QUESTION:

22

MR. SIMON:

It could be, certainly.
Why wouldn't that be enough?
Well, simply stated, I guess,

23

because there's specific code and rule language that calls

24

for an earlier deadline, and --

1

that's your criteria, you're reading 105 pretty much out

2

of the statute, aren't you?

3

MR. SIMON:

I am reading 105 to be severely

4

limited, because it contains the language necessary or

5

appropriate to enforce orders, rules, or prevent abuse of

6

process.

7

There were no prior orders here, and -QUESTION:

No, but you're not depending on

8

orders, you're depending on process, and you have conceded

9

that process can be an abuse of the judicial process, not

10

process referring to some document issued, and the

11

judicial process is an on-going one which only concludes

12

with the closing of the case.

13
14
15

MR. SIMON:

Well, if I stated that or implied

that, it's broader than I intended.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought -- I guess we'd

16

better get clear on that, because I thought that Justice

17

Scalia specifically asked you that question to clarify

18

that point, so I think we do not understand what you mean

19

by abuse of process.

20

MR. SIMON:

21
22

When I say process, the code and the

rules, the statutory scheme is the process, or is -QUESTION:

Well, if the statutory scheme is the

23

process, then I suppose the process continues until the

24

case is closed.

2

understand the inquiry of the Court, but -QUESTION:

Well, the inquiry started with your

3

claim that in administering 105 there is an interest in

4

finality which must be served in construing it as to when

5

a 105 sua sponte objection may be raised, and I said,

6

isn't that interest served sufficiently by saying it's got

7

to be raised before the case is closed, and since you

8

concede that process means judicial process, i.e. the

9

whole statutory scheme, it would seem consistent with your

10

view of process to say that a 105 sua sponte objection

11

could be raised by the court or inquiry could be made by

12

the court at any time until the case is closed.

13

MR. SIMON:

Well, certainly the case closing

14

could be a deadline, but I guess I'm saying that there is

15

a specific deadline in this statutory scheme, and there is

16

no real reason for going outside of that scheme except in

17

very extreme and unusual cases where there are -- where --

18

and you don't have that concern not only specifically in

19

this case but the court did not really take any sua sponte

20

action except years into the future in this case after the

21

exemption period had run.

22

23

QUESTION:

Basically your defense here is that

this is not an extreme case, isn't that right?

24

MR. SIMON:

25

QUESTION:

I mean --

Certainly.
Why isn't it an extreme case?

Do you

1

say that there was a valid legal basis for exemption of

the entire claim?

3

MR. SIMON:

Absolutely, because under the

exemption scheme the debtor had three arguable bases for

exemptions under 522(d)(5), the so-called wild card

letter from an associate in the firm of Freeland & Kronz

2

that responded to the trustee's inquiry, and that letter

3

certainly did state that there was no way of ascertaining

4

the value of the claim to Ms. Davis other than calculating

5

back pay and interest, and he had calculated that at

6

$110,000.

7

That occurred after the petition date, and it

8

was based on the assumption that there was final liability

9

which turned out -- at that time, which turned out to be

10
11

incorrect, at least at that time.
But more importantly, at that time there had not

been damages testimony.

Commission had entered an order that said you're entitled

14

to wage loss for a period from 1976 until the time that

15

the defendant no longer employed a certain category of

employee in Pittsburgh, and if you make that calculation,

17

as we have done in our brief, that amounts to roughly

18

$9,000 or $10,000 in damages, so at that point in time,

19

the burden was on the debtor through her attorneys to in

20

effect reverse that commission order.

Now, they later went forward towards a trial on

damages and the matter was, of course, eventually settled,

the filing of the bankruptcy petition, liability was not

finally determined.

importantly the claim that it was worth $110,000 in my

client's word was --at that time was a flight of fancy.

There was a specific commission order in place, and those

damages were severely limited, and the testimony at trial

7

was similar, that the only evidence presented was the

claim was not as valuable at that time.

QUESTION:

Are you saying --

QUESTION:

Mr. Simon, did your opponent rely in

11

the court of appeals on bankruptcy -- on section 105(a)?
MR. SIMON:

No, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

Not raised at all.

15

MR. SIMON:

16

QUESTION:

12

13

That was not

raised.

No.
Mr. Simon, as I understand it, you're

17

saying, number 1, the amount of the claim was low at the

18

relevant period, i.e., maybe $9,000 or $10,000, and I

19

think you're also saying that the value of that claim as

20

an asset was not even the amount of the claim itself,

21

because it was subject to contingencies.

MR. SIMON:

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

court of appeals?
MR. DYK:

9

That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

The issue in the court of appeals, however, was whether

section 522 was a bar, and that's the same issue in this
