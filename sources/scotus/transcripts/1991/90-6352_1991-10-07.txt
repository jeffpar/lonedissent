CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 90-6352, Diane Griffin v. the United States.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL G. LOGAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LOGAN:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may please

the Court:
Diane Griffin was convicted in a single count in

10
11

23 counts of an indictment centering around a major drug

12

prosecution in Chicago.

13

charged, there were two objects of this conspiracy.

14

During the trial, and at the end of the Government's case,

15

it became clear, as a lawyer, that the evidence was

16

insufficient as presented by the Government and the DEA

17

obj ect.

18

In the count in which she was

At that time, Griffin made a motion for a

19

directed finding.

20

during that argument conceded that the evidence was

21

insufficient on that object.

22

motion for a severance for reasons that I set out in the

23

briefs.

24
25

The Government made argument, and

At that time, Griffin made a

At the end of the entire case, the evidence
really didn't change.

And prior to submission of the

instructions to the jury, Griffin asked for several

2

things.

3

insufficient object be removed from the jury's

4

consideration.

And she submitted a jury instruction that

5

did just that.

That instruction was denied.

One of the things that she asked for was that the

As an alternative, she submitted a set of

6

7

special interrogatories, wherein the jury would have told

8

the court which of the two objects the jury was using as a

9

basis for the finding of guilt if there was going to be a

10

finding of guilt.

Those instructions were also denied.

At the end of the jury's deliberation, there was

11
12

a finding of guilty.

13

submit to this Court, I submitted to the court at the*

14

time, I submitted it to the court of appeals, that to this

15

day we do not know upon which basis -- which of the

16

objects this jury decided guilt.

17

QUESTION:

It was a general verdict.

And I

Well, you know if you accept the

18

presumption that the jury follows its instructions, don't

19

you?

20

MR. LOGAN:

Well, Your Honor, I think that's

21

exactly the point.

Because we follow the presumption the

22

jury follows its instructions, because we believe that and

23

we follow that presumption, we do not know because in the

24

instructions there was error.

25

was allowed to use the basis that was insufficiently

The error was that the jury

proven as a basis for guilt.

2

there was evidence concerning knowledge of the drug

prosecution, of the drug dealing.

QUESTION:

And this is a case where

But doesn't the issue get settled by

the instruction on burden of proof and the quantum of

proof necessary?

instruction, it could not have convicted on that

particular possibility.
MR. LOGAN:

10

Well, I believe that approach makes

11

sense if you believe that the jury can recognize the legal

12

insufficiency of the evidence.

13

case, and I'm asking this Court to follow that view, that

14

juries do not always recognize legal insufficiency of the

15

evidence.

16

And it's our view in this

The trial lawyer in this case, and I tried this

17

case, recognized that legal insufficiency.

18

conceded the legal insufficiency.

1

both sides that it was legally insufficient.

20

this case, Your Honor, there was evidence concerning --

21

circumstantial evidence -- concerning connection between

22

Diane Griffin and the DEA object.

23

The Government

in Cramer. In Cramer v. United States, the defendant in

QUESTION:

MR. LOGAN:

17

QUESTION:

There was some evidence.
But insufficient.
Insufficient evidence.
Well, and the Government actually

opposed giving the instruction, didn't they?

19

MR. LOGAN:

20

QUESTION:

They actively opposed it.
And they wanted the jury to be told

that they could convict on either or both?

MR. LOGAN:

QUESTION:

a reasonable doubt.

And this in argument there was some

MR. LOGAN:

2

closing arguments to the jury -- the prosecutor, in

3

closing argument, told the jury that Diane Griffin was

4

charged with the conspiracy to defraud the DEA and the

5

IRS.
QUESTION:

6

In

Why do you think that if the

7

Government opposed the instruction, but nevertheless

8

conceded that there wasn't enough evidence to convict, it
may be that both you and the Government were wrong.

10

MR. LOGAN:

11

QUESTION:

In what way, Your Honor?
Well, there was evidence and your

12

problem is the jury -- you're suggesting that the jury

13

found your client guilty on a basis on which just the

14

Government thought there was insufficient evidence.

15

jury may have thought there was sufficient evidence.

MR. LOGAN:

The court also thought that there

was insufficient evidence.

It's the jury's job to say whether there

QUESTION:

23

MR. LOGAN:

Well, I would disagree.
Isn't that right?
No, Your Honor, I disagree with the

Court, if you please.

QUESTION:

3

MR.

He never granted your motion.

LOGAN:

That is true.

The court did not

4

grant my motion.

I don't know why the court didn't grant

5

me partial judgment of acquittal.

6

said the same thing in their opinion.

7

didn't know why the district court didn't grant partial

8

summary judgment in this case.

The Seventh Circuit
They said they

It was there.

The evidence concerning the association of

10

Griffin with the drugs is all evidence of association,

11

that's why I point out the Cramer case.

12

to Cramer.
QUESTION:

13

and

It's very similar

If you asked someone on the street

14

whether it was more likely that a jury would convict on a

15

count where there was sufficient evidence or on a count

16

where there wasn't sufficient evidence,

17

person's answer would be on the count where there was

18

sufficient evidence, don't you think?

19

MR.

LOGAN:

Yes,

I do.

I suppose the

However,

the term itself

20

is as misleading.

21

were a small amount of evidence or if there is no evidence

22

at all,

23

yes,

24

the case,

25

there was sufficient evidence for a conviction.

I think,

As I pointed out in my brief,

then,

at that point,

if there

the court could say,

they only decided on the evidence where there -- on
on the object -- where there was evidence, where

But in Griffin's case what we have is a major

drug prosecution.

3

Government attempted at the beginning of the case to

4

convict Griffin on the drug arm of this particular count.

The

What happened during the case was that at a

5

'

In essence, this is a drug case.

6

critical point when the witness, according to the proffer,

7

was going to say that Griffin was party to a drug

8

conversation -- the witness testified that the two men

9

went to the other end of the bar and had a private

10

conversation concerning the distribution of drugs, while

11

Griffin was left along.

12

Government insisted that they were going to maintain this

13

opportunity to have the jury consider the drug evidence

14

against Griffin.

15

QUESTION:

But despite that fact, the

Well, so did the -- apparently, so

16

did the judge think it ought to be submitted because he

17

refused your -- the judge may have thought, well, if I

18

were a juror, I wouldn't think this was enough evidence.

But he nevertheless sent it to the jury.

MR. LOGAN:

Didn't he?

Well, I'm puzzled by that myself.

don't understand why the court sent it to the jury.

22

QUESTION:

Well, he just said that it's my

23

opinion there's not enough evidence.

But he must have

thought there was enough evidence to go to the jury on

25

that.

MR. LOGAN:

1

Well, on that point, Your Honor, we

2

have the district court's written opinion where the

3

district court says that there was not sufficient

4

evidence.

QUESTION:

5
6

That may be what he thought.

Then

why did he let it go to the jury on that issue?
MR. LOGAN:

7
8

The court did not --

today, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

9

Well, I think that's why I'm here
That's the issue.
Is one possible reason that there

10

were other defendants as to whom the evidence was

11

sufficient.

12

could find Griffin guilty of either conspiracy?

13

don't think the United States argued that in its closing

14

argument, although you might correct me on that point if

15

I'm wrong.

16

The judge didn't instruct, did he, that they

MR. LOGAN:

And I

If I might, on the jury

17

instructions, the court directly instructed this jury

18

according to the statute, and the statutes reads if there

19

is a defrauding of the United States or either of its

20

agencies -- or any of its agencies -- you may find guilt.

21

So there was a jury instruction from the court that

22

allowed the jury --

trial judge didn't say specifically as to Griffin.

There should have been a distinction between those

11

13

So she should not have been lumped there.

QUESTION:

The judge

Did the Government argue in its

14

closing argument specifically that Griffin could be guilty

15

of the DEA or the IRS conspiracy?

16

MR. LOGAN:

Yes.

The prosecutor in closing

argument said that the -- all three defendants by name

were charged with the DEA object and with the IRS object.

In my closing argument, I said to this jury the

that says that Griffin is guilty on the DEA object of this

Mr. Logan, the question on which we

17

granted certiorari is whether a conviction for a multiple

insufficient to support one of the objects of the

All right.
Did the court of appeals judge this

case on the basis that there was not sufficient evidence

2

for the drug case?

3

MR. LOGAN:

The court of appeals used the Turner

4

approach to the case and said that Turner applies here.

5

Where there is insufficient evidence, and that's the

6

insufficiency, Turner applies.

7

of unconstitutionality -QUESTION:

8

10

So they judged it on the

basis that there was -- that it didn't make any difference
if there was insufficient evidence on this one thing.

MR. LOGAN:

QUESTION:

I got you.

If this case had been one

That is correct.
And that's the way the case comes to

us.

14

MR. LOGAN:

15

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And so your job is to convince us

16

that that's then a case where you can't tell what the jury

17

did.

18

MR. LOGAN:

19

QUESTION:

That is right.
Mr. Logan, in a conspiracy case,

20

typically it's also alleged by the prosecutor that there

21

have been overt acts committed in support of the

22

conspiracy -- in furtherance of the conspiracy.

23

that so?

24

MR. LOGAN:

QUESTION:

That is true.

Suppose that the Government charges several overt

that it would.

5

Cramer, where the requirement is that the defendant be

6

found guilty of committing one of the overt acts and be

7

witnessed by two people, where the statute specifically

8

says that, I think that it would apply.

9

speaking, I do not think it would apply because you're

I think that if you have a case like

10

talking about overt acts which support a particular

11

object, and the object is the end.

12

I don't believe that it would go to the overt acts unless

13

the statute was the focus - - the statute focused on the

14

overt acts.

15

QUESTION:

It's the purpose.

So

Well, normally a statute requires

16

that there be proof of some overt act and furtherance.

17

And I just wondered whether your theory wouldn't lead to

18

the same approach in the case of a deficiency of proof on

19

one of the alleged acts and furtherance.

20

MR. LOGAN:

I don't believe that it would

21

because what we're looking to is an essential element.

22

I believe Ingram v. United States points out, it's an

23

essential that there be evidence, sufficient evidence, of

24

an object, to be knowledge of an object.

25

overt acts may support that there are pieces of evidence

And this -- the

this argument goes to the question of overt acts.

In this case, in my case, the jury had to find

There wasn't any question of that.

They had to find the Internal Revenue Service object,

QUESTION:

Mr. Logan, what do you do about

Turner v. United States?
MR. LOGAN:

I think you have to look

Do you ask us to overrule that?

No, I don't. I think that Turner v.

15

United States is a case in which the Court did not address

16

the issue of where we do not know.

17

States, there were three acts.

18

considering those three acts is say that the only evidence

in the case, and this is an important point, the only

20

evidence in the case was evidence of possession.

In Turner v. United

What the Court did in

someone had to guess which of the two.

25

were distribution, I believe, and sale.

The other two acts

And they were

separate -- separate theories.

2

evidence in the case except the possession.

3

ruled as a matter of law that possession equated with

4

purchase, and therefore, knew where the jury was going by

5

reason of its analysis.
QUESTION:

6

But there wasn't any
The Court

I didn't read it that way.

I mean,

7

it seems to me the Court says in Turner is that the

8

general rule is that when a jury returns a guilty verdict

9

on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive,

10

as Turner's indictment did, the verdict stands if the

11

evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts

12

charged.

13

MR. LOGAN:

14

QUESTION:

15

That's correct.
You're at least asking us to go back

on that -- on that statement, no?
MR. LOGAN:

16

Well, I'm only asking the Court to

17

apply the rule that I'm seeking if we do not know.

18

Turner, the Court knew.

19

was -- there's no question in the case that the evidence

20

did not apply to distribution, the evidence did not apply

21

to sale.

what the Court said.

don't know what the jury decided in this case.

There was no question that there

That is correct.

Is that right?

MR. LOGAN:

Well, I believe -- yes, Your Honor,

9

QUESTION:

I don't know.

The point

If you said, well, the

10

jury had to find A and B, but it couldn't have found A

11

because as a matter of law there wasn't enough evidence to

support that finding.

13

MR. LOGAN:

Well, no, Your Honor, because if

14

they had found B in this case, that would have been

sufficient.

they found her guilty on the Internal Revenue Service

In other words, what the jury heard in this case

was through the presumption, and since that was a

MR. BRYSON:

Well, Your Honor, I think that it

would not for the following reason.

17

you have a conspiracy that may involve two closely related

objects, typically that is regarded as a single agreement

19

in which there is only one agreement, even though it may

have two objects, and which can't support -- indeed, it

QUESTION:

We don't agree with that rule, but

Do you feel that Turner and Yates can

stand together?
MR. BRYSON:

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

And the

reason is because Yates was a case that held that where

18

there is legal error, where the jury in effect is told

19

that something is a crime which isn't a crime, and the

20

jury may have based its conviction on that theory, then

you have to reverse.

And I think they

And in fact, I think Yates continues to

be applied, and properly so, in-cases in which there is a

legal flaw, in which -- in the theories -- one of the

theories that was presented to the jury in which there is

some basis on which the jury's instructed, for example,

that conduct that is not a crime is, in fact, a basis for

criminal liability.

QUESTION:

legal flaw where evidence is so insufficient that as a

MR. BRYSON:

Well, that -- you can say, of

QUESTION:

That was a piece of the case.

2

MR. BRYSON:

Well, it was, Your Honor.

But what

3

the Court was saying was, the case as it went to the jury,

4

and as it was decided by the court of appeals, was decided

5

on a legally erroneous ground.

6

appeals assumed that an overt act was legally sufficient

7

if it merely did something, as in a conspiracy context, to

8

promote the treason.

9

And that is, the court of

What this Court held was no.

Overt acts require

10

much more by way of proof.

11

Court was saying as a matter of law, constitutional law,

12

overt acts must actually show that aiding and comforting

13

the enemy is going on.

14

QUESTION:

That was a legal ground.

The

Well, I asked Mr. Logan earlier

15

whether he would extend his rule to overt acts, and he

said oh, no.

if one was insufficient --

MR. BRYSON:

proved.

And then the logic of this position would be to

2

say, all right, if there was one overt act that was not

3

sufficiently proved, the jury may have rested its verdict

4

on that overt act.

5

Therefore, we have to reverse.

In this case, for example, there were 10 overt

6

acts.

What if the evidence failed with respect to one of

7

them?

Wouldn't his argument compel reversal if you accept

8

it.

9

the distinction was, but I think when you get down to it,

10

there is really no reason not to extend that rationale to

11

the overt act setting.

12

reasons that we think would be extremely mischievous to

13

adopt the position that petitioner is arguing for.

He says no, I didn't understand what the rationale of

The same thing could be said, for example, the

identity of co-conspirators.

16

there were 10 co-conspirators named in the indictment.

The proof was sufficient as to nine, but insufficient as

18

to one, but that one co-conspirator may have been the

19

co-conspirator that the jury found the defendant to have

20

conspired with.

21

defendant did not conspire with any of the others.

Therefore, the verdict may have been premised on an

insufficiently proved basis and we, therefore, have to

reverse.

indictment with all kinds of alleged objects of a

3

conspiracy and overt acts, and just tossing everything in

4

but the kitchen sink?

5

MR. BRYSON:

Well, yes, Your Honor.

We -- there

6

are two things, I think.

First of all, we do have an

7

obligation, I think both an ethical obligation and a legal

8

obligation to ensure that everything that goes into an

9

indictment is established to probable cause -- at least to

10

the degree of confidence of probable cause, which is the

11

degree that the grand jury has to find.

12

The second ground is a practical matter.

If you

13

have a lot in the indictment that your proof is not going

14

to establish, you give defense counsel a lot to shoot at.

15

And in fact, to some extent, that's what

16

happened here because defense counsel made pretty good use

17

of the fact that our proof had failed on the DEA object in

In this case, I can't quarrel with

the court of appeals that it would have made things easier

to do it, except, and this is a big except, the problem is

8

that if you instruct with respect to somebody who is one
of three defendants in a count, as was the case here, then

10

the suggestion is -- and if you say, well, with respect to

11

this defendant, you can only find her guilty if you find

12

the IRS object, the suggestion is you're making some kind

13

of suggestion that the evidence insufficient with respect

to the others with respect to both DEA and IRS.

something which, if I were representing McNulty, for
