ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN GARDNER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. GARDNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress did not intend to strip the State of

12

Texas of its right to use its traditional police powers to

13

protect its citizens from deceptive airline advertising.

14

Congress never suggested that Texas is not free to sue

15

individual airlines in its state courts for specific

16

violations of its general state consumer protection act,

17

yet that is precisely the result of the decision of a

18

court below.

19

appeals sustained a sweeping injunction against Texas that

20

prohibited the State from any type of law enforcement

21

action that would regulate or restrict any aspect of the

22

individually named plaintiff airline's airfare advertising

23

or their other operations involving their rates, routes,

24

and services.

25

The district court entered and the court of

case into context for the Court.

2

State of Texas and several other state attorneys general

3

wrote to a few airlines in November of 1988 advising them

4

that their practices of segmenting out certain portions of

5

their airfares from the advertised fare and putting it

6

into the fine print of the footnotes of an advertisement,

7

thereby reducing an ad from, say, $321 to $298, were

8

violations of their state deceptive practices laws.

9

This case arose when the

in this litigation.

11

opportunity to resolve this matter without litigation.

12

Rather than taking us up on that offer the airlines

13

themselves brought suit in Federal district court against

14

first, the State of Texas, and later expanded that lawsuit

15

to include 33 other state attorneys general.

16

We offered those airlines an

From that lawsuit the district court entered a

17

preliminary injunction that was later converted to a

18

permanent injunction that was as I have already set forth.

19

What this case is about is the right of the State of Texas

20

to enforce its state consumer protection act to stop

21

illegal, deceptive segmenting out of surcharges.

about anything broader than that.

about the NAAG guidelines that the airlines make a bit

about in their brief.

never attempted to do so.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Gardner, we have to decide,

3

I guess, what it is that the language that Congress used

4

means, and it chose to use language that preempts,

5

federally preempts state laws relating to rates, routes,

6

or services.

7

That's the language it chose, relating to.

MR. GARDNER:

Yes, Your Honor.

At the same time

8

it passed it the conference report referred to that

9

language as preemption of anything regulating rates,

10

routes, or services.

11

Congress - -

12

QUESTION:

It is necessary to look at what

Well, it would have been easy enough

13

for Congress to have used the language of preempting state

14

law determining rates or setting rates or something of

15

that kind, but it didn't.

16

the ERISA context this Court has interpreted that

17

identical phrase in a fairly expansive manner, I guess.

18

MR. GARDNER:

It said relating to.

And in

Yes, Your Honor, we urge the Court

19

not to apply the same interpretation precepts to the

20

Federal Aviation Act as this Court has indeed applied in

21

the ERISA context, for the very simple reason that ERISA

22

was a very broadly preemptive law because its prime scope

23

was in essence for the Federal Government to occupy the

24

field of regulation of employee benefit plans.

25

not the case here.

That was

1 78 when this relating to language was adopted, what was

2

Congress setting about to change.

3

Prior to '78 the states and the Federal

4

Government, as this Court recognized in the Nader decision

5

in 1 76, had enjoyed a dual enforcement relationship with

respect to consumer protection type laws.

In 1 78 what was Congress

Was Congress trying to keep the states out

10

of the area of consumer protection?

11

affirm nothing of the kind.

12

Nothing prior

I think our answer is

What Congress was doing in 1 78 was deregulating

13

the Federal Government's control that had existed since

14

the thirties, I believe, of the rates, routes, and

15

services, the direct --

16

QUESTION:

Well, can you say that advertisement

17

of airline rates and fares does not relate to airline

18

rates and fares?

1

Can you really say that?

MR. GARDNER:

That's not really the question.

I

20

think the answer is no, I may not be able to say that, but

21

that's not what Congress was preempting.

22

preempting only state laws that relate to rates, routes,

23

and services, not state laws that relate to advertising

24

which then relate to rates, routes, and services.

State of Texas or some other state had passed a statute

2

containing all of the prohibitions and guidelines set

3

forth in the guidelines that you issued here.

4

MR. GARDNER:

5

Would that

As long as those guidelines did

6

not regulate the rates, routes, and services, and I would

7

say they would not, I would think that statute would be

8

valid.

If the Court -QUESTION:

9
10
11

Well, you have to take that position,

don't you?
MR. GARDNER:

It is convenient.

But if the

12

Court -- rather, if the Court applied the broad scope of

13

ERISA reading and brought all of the concepts that

14

underlie the broad ERISA preemption and use that in

15

interpreting what Congress intended, not when it said

16

relating to, but when it enacted the 1978 act, then under

17

that kind of interpretation perhaps you could say that

18

regulation such as the NAAG guidelines would relate to it.

19

QUESTION:

But I'm troubled about what, the same

20

thing Justice O'Connor asked you.

21

difficult to say, it seems to me, that the guidelines

22

issued here do not relate to airline rates.

23

MR. GARDNER:

It's really quite

But the guidelines, Your Honor, I

mean, it's essentially a false issue.

QUESTION:

3

Well, in order to test that

4

proposition I think we're entitled to inquire as to how

5

far your principle leads, and it seems to me that you

6

simply must take the position that a state could enact a

7

statute which incorporated all of the guidelines that the

8

Attorney Generals' Association issued here.
MR. GARDNER:

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

I'm not

It's a general applicable,
It prohibits any person selling

or leasing goods or services from engaging in false,
misleading, or deceptive acts or practices.
QUESTION:

So you abandon your argument that the

mere fact that it does not relate to rates is dispositive
of this case?
MR. GARDNER:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?

It seems to me if you're going to

take that position you must abandon the argument that the
mere fact that it relates to advertising demonstrates that
it does not relate to rates.
MR. GARDNER:
QUESTION:

Well, as I said earlier --

It can relate to advertising and

relate to rates by reason of the fact that it relates to
advertising.
MR. GARDNER:

It would require a two step

bootstrapping argument, and -QUESTION:

step bootstrapping argument is valid with respect to a law
that prohibits the advertising of airfares.

before this Court and support.

current law does not permit that sort of action, nor, in

my belief, would the First Amendment permit the Court to

take, the state to take that sort of action.

Aside from the First Amendment, what

11

is your position on a state law that says no airline rates

action.

3

before this Court, the injunction of the district court,

4

is broad enough that we cannot, in the State of Texas,

take any type of enforcement action because the way this

sought, we are broadly preempted from any form of

regulation of airlines.

We believe that the language that is

MR. GARDNER:

15

I believe so, Your Honor.

Thank

16

you.

Looking at what Congress set out to do in '78, it is

17

clear that Congress did not intend to take the states out

18

of the business, it did not intend to take the Federal

19

Government out of the business of regulating deceptive

20

practices.

21

existed for some time.

22

that aspect of Federal regulation, it in fact enjoined the

23

Civil Aeronautics Board, now the Department of

24

Transportation, even more broadly to prohibit

industry.
This indicates that Congress indeed intended and

3

in fact achieved a split type of deregulation.

4

did deregulate the utility-type rate making setting of the

5

airlines rates, routes, and services.

6

nor did it achieve, anything that took the Federal

Government out of the business of regulating and

8

prohibiting deceptive practices by airlines.

9

Congress

It did not intend,

We believe that this shows Congress' intent to

10

deregulate only that one area, the utility-like setting of

11

rates, routes, and services that the Federal agencies had

12

engaged in broadly and that in fact a number of states had

13

engaged in on a piecemeal basis in the past.

14
15

QUESTION:

Could states, after the act was

passed, regulate intrastate carriage by airlines?

16

MR. GARDNER:

17

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

But then the act goes beyond merely

18

undoing what the CAB had been doing, because when the CAB

19

was in effect the CAB regulated interstate fares and the

20

states were entitled to regulate intrastate fares, right?

21

MR. GARDNER:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Absolutely.

And the new act says no regulation of

intrastate fares.
MR. GARDNER:

regulation of fares, period, regardless of

QUESTION:

1

They want a competitive regime, which

2

is consonant with the notion that they wanted competitive

3

advertising too.

4

MR. GARDNER:

Competitive advertising can only

5

exist if the advertising is truthful and is not deceptive.

6

If a competitor loses business to another airline because

7

that other airline has advertised in a way that makes it

8

appear as though they are cheaper when in fact they are
not, they are going to lose business.

They are not a

10

better competitor, they are just more creative, and from

11

their standpoint, or from our standpoint, unfortunately

12

deceptive advertising.

13

QUESTION:

So true is, as the Government points

14

out, that if you're practically disempowered from

15

advertising because you are compelled to include within

16

your notice all of the exceptions that may exist on

17

various routes, you as a practical matter can't have any

18

advertising.

1

MR. GARDNER:

20

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

And state law could do that, I

21

suppose.

22

must put in any of your advertising all of the exceptions

23

to the fares that you announce, you can't say some

24

exceptions apply?

25

Is there any objection to state law saying you

There is no prohibition there,

1

Your Honor.

We do recognize that the states have rights

2

to regulate the advertising that is directed at their

3

citizens and that appears within their borders.

4

argue with the Department of Transportation as to whether

5

or not that's the best way of doing things, but the simple

6

fact is right now what we're before the Court to argue

7

about is not that.

8

under currently adopted Federal regulation.

We may

It is actions that are in fact illegal

9

Federal regulation as it now exists, not as the

10

Department has proposed to amend it but as it now exists,

11

prohibits the very actions that the State of Texas would

12

seek to prohibit.

13

these what are to the State fairly minor type cases, these

14

are just another run of false advertising cases.

15

the types of cases that we would bring against a myriad of

16

companies for false price advertising and have brought

17

against department stores or groceries stores or car

18

dealers or electronics retailers.

We're trying to have the right to take

They're

We merely want the right to take a fixed

20

question, not a speculation as to what the NAAG guidelines

21

might do, but rather a fixed question as to whether this

surcharges, whether that's deceptive under Texas law.

If it isn't deceptive, then we lose.

QUESTION:

That's up to the state.

Even if

If it's

4

state law, the state can determine what's deceptive.

5

the state wants to say you're always deceptive in an ad

6

unless you list all of the exceptions to the price that

7

you state, if the state wants to say that's deceptive it

can, I presume.

MR. GARDNER:
QUESTION:

If

Yes, Your Honor --

I'm just trying to see where your

11

principle leads.

12

instance it's a very reasonable thing you're saying, and

13

something that the Department of Transportation will agree

14

to, but doesn't it lead you all the way to the point where

15

you can, if you wish and if we accept your argument here,

16

you can say effectively there will be no airline

17

advertising, by simply saying you must list every

18

exception to any fare that you advertise?

19

It may well be that in the particular

MR. GARDNER:

Your Honor, all we are seeking

20

here today is a declaration that the Texas Deceptive Trade

21

Practices Act as written and as enforced, or attempted to

22

be enforced in this case, is not preempted because as

23

written and as enforced it does not regulate and therefore

24

does not relate to the rates, routes, and services.

will absolutely grant that if a state statute does

I

regulate, whether directly or indirectly, and has a direct

2

and substantial effect on the decisions as to setting

3

rates, routes, or services by the airline people who are

4

setting those rates, routes, and services, there is going

5

to be preemption under the law as written.
QUESTION:

6

That's a point that the airline could

7

raise in the state case that was brought against it, I

8

suppose?

9

MR. GARDNER:

Yes, Your Honor.

There is nothing

10

to stop the states, the airlines from litigating every

11

aspect of preemption in the state courts.

12

to say to, in response to Justice Scalia, if the airlines

13

lose to a jury and cannot convince a jury that they acted

14

non-deceptively, or if we actually bear our burden, as any

15

other litigant, of convincing the jury that they have in

16

fact acted deceptively, they can still convince the judge

17

that it doesn't matter if Texas law has been violated

18

because Texas law goes too far.

19

QUESTION:

As I was about

Well, you don't get to the jury until

20

you have a valid state enforcement proceeding, and it

21

seems to me that your position must be that California can

22

require one size of type on airline advertisings, that

23

Texas can require another size of type, and that Arizona

24

can require a third type of type with an added disclosure,

25

and that every one of those state statutes would be valid

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. JONES:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

5

I hope to develop three points.

First, to show

6

that this case involves state implementation of the

7

substantive requirements of the NAAG guidelines and not,

8

as the states argue, their enforcement of consumer

9

protection laws generally.

Second, to establish that

10

section 105 of the Deregulation Act should be given the

11

same broad, common sense meaning as the similarly worded

12

ERISA preemption statute.

13

the rules articulated by the NAAG guidelines fall well

14

within the preemptive scope of section 105 as so

15

construed.

16

QUESTION:

And third, to demonstrate that

Mr. Jones, do I gather from your

17

first point that you feel it's necessary to your case to

18

show that the State here was intending to implement the

19

NAAG guidelines and not just general fraud statutes or

20

deceptive advertising statutes?

21

MR. JONES:

I don't think that's integral to our

22

argument, but I think that it's important to inform the

23

Court what the case is really about, because the State

24

takes the position that it has been enjoined from

25

enforcing its consumer protection laws generally, and we

MR. JONES:

The states are concerned about the

breadth of the ordering paragraph in the injunction --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. JONES:

Yes.

Do you support that?

I don't think that the ordering

10

paragraph as such was correctly written, but I think that

11

if you read that paragraph, not in isolation but in the

12

context of what the district court said earlier in the

13

text of the same order and also read it in light of the

14

complaint which narrowly focuses on the NAAG guidelines,

15

you will agree with us that the proper construction of the

16

injunction is that it just bars the State --

Rule 65 is quite precise that the

complaint and say well, let's see if we can't get another

against the NAAG guidelines and not against consumer

6

MR. JONES:

mention the NAAG guidelines twice in its first paragraphs,

but what counsel for the State has focused your attention

on is the particular ordering language of the injunction.

11

NAAG guidelines and that is the context within which the

12

ordering paragraph should be read.

QUESTION:

Yes, but Mr. Jones, isn't it your

14

position that the consumer protection laws are generally

the Chief Justice that the guidelines argument is, is

What's wrong

Is there something -- if that isn't

MR. JONES:

We think the consumer protection

11

laws as they apply to airfare advertising are preempted,

12

but the analysis that we set forth is an attempt to show

13

why these guidelines in particular interfere with the pro-

14

competitive policy of the statute.

QUESTION:

What about consumer protection laws

as they apply to the sale of tickets, never mind

We're suggesting that the statute

has to be applied in the same way as the ERISA statute,

state law in relation to the objectives of the Federal

13

effect to the relational concept underlying the statute

and also effectuates the underlying statutory purposes

that can be constructed from not only the preemption

statute but the other provisions of the statute as well.

QUESTION:

Your opponent, Mr. Jones, suggests

18

that Congress, in enacting the ERISA statute, intended to,

19

quote, occupy the field, whereas here congressional intent

20

was not the same, and that therefore the phrases, though

21

identical language, should not be read the same in the two

22

acts.

23

What is your response to that?
MR. JONES:

Our response is that in this context

24

the difference between regulation and deregulation is, the

25

distinction is one without a difference.

In ERISA the

it wanted to keep the states out and it was an exclusively

No, I don't think so.

Mr. Jones, can I ask you a question

to be sure I understand your theory?

Justice Scalia asked

10

you about fraud in the sale of tickets, and I understood

11

your answer to be that's probably not preempted because it

12

doesn't have a sufficient direct impact on the rate making

process.

Maybe I misunderstood.
MR. JONES:

That's essentially correct, Mr.

Justice Stevens.

that, say regulation, state regulations prohibited obscene

it didn't have any significant burden?

MR. JONES:

Perhaps there isn't.

Let me go back

to the fraud hypothetical.

claim could rest upon a claim that there was a deceptive

preempted if the argument about deception was the same

kind of argument that the states make here with respect to

15

the guidelines, or that underlie the guidelines.

16

fraud claims, however, might have nothing to do with

deceptive advertising as such and they would fall well

outside the line that we're trying to draw.

their dealings with their car rental agencies or something

of that kind.
MR. JONES:

4

Well, Congress did specifically

5

provide that the states could continue to impose certain

6

kinds of taxes and it also provided that their proprietary

7

control over airports and their regulations issued in

8

connection with that were not preempted.

9

that the preemption statute might other wise sweep in

Congress foresaw

10

these provisions and for that reason it explicitly

11

exempted them from the preemption statute.
QUESTION:

12

13
14

now?

What exemption are you talking about

What statutory provision?
MR. JONES:

With respect to the proprietary

15

operations, that's in the preemption statute itself.

16

think it's subsection B.

17

cannot now remember the name, the number of the section,

18

but it was the subject of this Court's opinion in the

They represent precisely the kind of

2

controlled supervision over rate advertising in which

3

state public utility commissions commonly engage.

4

Thus if section 105 is to be given the reading

5

that the states themselves say they prefer, this case at

6

least is at an end.

7

for purposes of this case only if the Court were to decide

8

whatever other further preemptive scope section 105 may

have.

10

And I think it would be sufficient

At least it does preempt utility type regulation of

the kind involved in this case.

Do you support the affirmance of the

injunction as written and issued by the court below?
MR. NIGHTINGALE:

Your Honor, again, we agree

with the airline that it, that read as a whole it can be
read more narrowly than the ordering paragraph.

If the

ordering paragraph alone is the focus of the Court's
attention, we think that the only part of it which is
problematic is the part that follows fair advertising.
There is talk about other operations involving rates,
routes, or services.

We don't believe that that, that the

issue is so broad as the ordering paragraph indicates.
But certainly state laws that restrict the content and
form of airfare advertising are preempted, and we
understand the ordering paragraph to be entirely
consistent with that.

the Court has also recognized that every conceivable

Now,

In a footnote in the Shaw v. Delta Airlines case

9

the Court said that there may not be preemption when a law

affects benefit plans in a way that is, quote, too

tenuous, remote, or peripheral to justify preemption.

12

that the application of a state law that says the bad

faith denial of benefits is preempted, even though that is

14

just an application of a general state law that says bad

15

faith breeches of contract are actionable, it is preempted

16

when applied to an ERISA benefit plan.

Whereas the application of a garnishment statute

is not preempted because that is just too peripheral, too

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GARDNER:

To address Justice O'Connor's

request for a principle, I apologize for not laying it out
and I will observe that it seems to me strikingly similar
to the one the airlines announced.

We are asking the

Court to determine that the Federal Aviation Act does not
preempt a law of general applicability that does not have
a direct and substantial effect on the rates, routes, and
services of an airline.
But the unfortunate result there is that that
does require a remand because we have not had a record
developed here, as we have pointed out.

We do not believe

the airlines will succeed in developing such a record
because we do not believe that regulation of false
advertising does indeed have that direct and substantial
effect, nor, to use the ERISA test, does this state law
have any connection with rates, routes, or services, or
any reference to.

Even if you use the ERISA test our

enforcement of our state consumer protection law fails.
QUESTION:

What about just the guidelines?

If

we assume that only the guidelines are at issue do you say
that there's not enough record with respect to that as
well?
MR. GARDNER:

There is no record of any effect

of any of the, whether the guidelines or the actual
