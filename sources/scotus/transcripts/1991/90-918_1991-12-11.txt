ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL I. KLEIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KLEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1972 Congress enacted title IX to give all

11
12

individuals a right not to be discriminated against on the

13

ground of sex by educational institutions receiving

14

Federal funds.

15

title IX right is judicially enforceable at the behest of

16

an individual like petitioner whose right has been

17

violated.

In 1979 this Court held in Cannon that the

18

In the case presented today the question is

19

whether the means of redressing the violation of this

20

legally enforceable right include the normal remedy of

21

damages.

We believe damages are available here for two

22

reasons.

First, this Court's consistent rule has been to

23

permit all traditional judicial remedies, including

24

damages, whenever a statute contains an implied right of

25

action.

1

That's a perfectly sensible rule, I would

2

submit, because when the Court concludes, as it did in

3

Cannon, that there are sufficient indicia of congressional

4

intent to support an implied right of action, the natural

5

inference, and indeed the only plausible rule, is that the

6

courts can use their customary remedial powers.

7

Second, we believe that a direct examination of

8

congressional intent confirms the conclusion that damages
are available under title IX.

In 1 72, when Congress

10

expressly patterned title IX on title VI of the 1 64 Civil

11

Rights Act, title VI had been interpreted by the lower

12

courts to include an implied right of action, and this

13

Court's cases at that time made it absolutely clear that

14

an implied right of action carries with it a right to

15

pursue damages.

16

can properly be said to have relied on these subtle

17

principles when it enacted title IX, and that that intent

18

should be given effect here.

1

I think it is fair to say that Congress

Furthermore, after Cannon was decided it seems

20

that this view of congressional intent became much

21

clearer, as Congress has since then passed two statutes

22

relying on and endorsing its understanding that damages

23

are available.

24

why these long-settled and relied-on expectations should

25

now be disturbed.

There's been no reason given to suggest

1

I'd like to return, then, to the general rule

2

which authorizes damages under an implied right of action

3

unless there is good evidence to suggest that Congress

4

intends otherwise.

5

applied by this Court both before and after title IX was

6

passed, including well into the era when the Court

7

tightened up its criteria for implying a right of action

8

in the first place.

9

That rule has been consistently

In particular, in 1983 and 1984 the Court

10

applied this rule in the Guardians and Darrone cases to

11

hold that a back-pay remedy is available under both title

12

VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and section 504 of the

13

Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

14

. QUESTION:

15
16

Well, back pay, of course, is not the

equivalent of damages.
MR. KLEIN:

I agree with that, Mr. Chief

17

Justice, but I think the principle is that in Guardians

18

and Darrone the reason back pay was found to be available

19

is that once the Court finds an implied right of action it

20

infers the availability of traditional damages.

21

is no doubt a difference in remedy, but I think there is

22

not a difference in - -

23

QUESTION:

So there

I don't see how you draw upon a case

24

which allowed back pay as saying that therefore damages

25

are available, unless just by a rather distant

implication.
MR. KLEIN:

2

Well, I think it is by implication

3

in the sense that I think the reasoning that led the Court

4

to think - - to conclude rather - - that damages - - that

5

back pay is available, that same reasoning applies here.

6

There was, for example, no direct legislative intent that

the Court ruled on to say that title VI would include back

pay.

suggestion.

I mean, there was no specific or even indirect

What the Court really concluded is that once we

10
11

find sufficient indication of a right of action we

12

presume, it's just a natural presumption, that all the

remedies are available.

MR. KLEIN:

Darrone.

The Consolidated Rail v.

2

Darrone, which was the year after Guardians, where frankly

3

a unanimous Court basically came together, I think, on

4

these principles.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Klein, I think that our cases in

6

Touche Ross and maybe the Sierra Club indicate that the

7

Courts won't engraft a remedy on a statute that Congress

8

didn't intent to provide.

9

any applicability here?

10

MR. KLEIN:

Do you think that notion has

I don't in the following sense,

11

Justice O'Connor.

I think that Touche Ross and its

12

progeny stand for the proposition that the Court won't

13

imply a right of action unless it concludes that there is

14

congressional intent to. do so.

15

QUESTION:

16

scope of the remedy?

17

MR. KLEIN:

You think it has nothing to do with

I don't, for the following reason.

18

If we agree that once you imply a private right of action

19

that must mean two things.

20

allow a judicially enforceable right.

21

private right, I think, means.

22

One, Congress intended to
That's what a

It also must mean the fact that it's an implied

23

right is that Congress has left the issue to the courts,

24

because they haven't set it out in the statute or in the

25

legislative history.

Now, what I suggest, if you knew

1

that much, which is I think what you know in an implied

2

right of action case, the logical inference is that all

3

remedies are going to be available.

4

QUESTION:

Do you think that we have employed

5

that notion even in statutes enacted under the Spending

6

Clause?

7

MR. KLEIN:

I do, because I think that notion

8

explains the Guardians, Darrone cases, which is a Spending

9

Clause statute.
QUESTION:

10

Well, I thought under the Spending

11

Clause theory we were a little more careful about binding

12

a damages remedy if it might be beyond the scope of what

13

we assume the States have contracted with the Federal

14

Government to do.

15

MR. KLEIN:

I think you have, but I think that

16

distinction was drawn actually by Justice White in his

17

opinion in Guardians.

QUESTION:

The point he made, I think -I'm not sure that was joined by

anybody.

MR. KLEIN:

1

I think the point that Justice White

2

made, which it seems to me is a fair point, that if you're

3

talking about an imply - - a damages remedy in a context

4

where it's an unintentional violation, it's difficult, the

5

Pennhurst concern about contractual understandings is

6

appropriate.

7

have to prove an intentional violation.
The other point I'd like to make, Justice

8

9

Now, in fact we allege, and I understand we

O'Connor, is it at least seems strange to me the notion

10

that when Congress provides Federal funds to a program it

11

would want a less vigorous or less comprehensive scheme of

12

enforcement with respect to civil rights.

13

we ought to basically think that it would be opposite

14

where Federal monies may be misused.
QUESTION:

15

I think in fact

Well,, what would you do if you were

16

faced with an unintentional violation, so to speak?

17

there be an unintentional violation of title IX?
MR. KLEIN:

18

Of title IX?

Can

Well, I think that is

19

a question that certainly is left open after Darrone.

20

Darrone suggests there can be an unintentional violation.

21

Let me say I don't think, I think you do have an issue of

22

contract interpretation, and that seems like a reasonable

23

issue.

24

private institution had no reason to think what it was

25

doing was a violation, then you may have a question of

In other words, if the States had no reason or the

whether that's sufficient intent to enforce the Spending

Clause legislation against it.
But it seems a very different thing when we

allege and if we prove that this is intentional.

be that the State here, or the school district rather,

didn't know that this was a violation.

didn't have in place a mechanism for students to go and

complain or make known any concern about this kind of

sexual harassment.

It can't

They were in flat violation of the

regulation.

QUESTION:

12

So any notion that they, so to speak, weren't

Mr. Klein, could the petitioner have

pleaded a cause of action under section 1983?

14

MR. KLEIN:

I believe she could have, Justice

15

Blackmun.

1983 would apply here, of course, because this

16

was a school board.

17

its scope and applies to private institutions as well.

18

And I guess one other point I'd just like to

Title IX, however, is far broader in

19

note there, Justice Blackmun, is that I think she is

20

entitled to a claim under 1983, but I think she might run

21

into the argument that, a Sea Clammers' type of argument

22

that title IX has its own remedial scheme and so she might

23

be preempted.

24

think it might be raised.

25

I don't think that's a good argument, but I

Well, wouldn't she have to show too

that there was a policy on the part of the school board

2

before she could sue the school board, rather than

3

individuals who she claimed discriminated under Monell?

MR. KLEIN:

Well, she would have to certainly

meet the criteria under Monell, and I think we can meet

those criteria in the --

MR. KLEIN:

But it's a criteria you would not

have to meet it under title IX.

11

don't know that that issue is necessarily --

12

QUESTION:

I agree with that.

But I

So that if, if we upheld your

13

position here, people who had previously sued under 1983

14

and had to prove a policy under Monell would be relieved

15

of that obligation?

16

MR. KLEIN:

I think that's right, Mr. Chief

17

Justice, but I want to say I don't think that's surprising

18

in the following sense.

19

abrogated the Eleventh Amendment under title IX.

20

hasn't done that under 1983.

21

Congress intended broader protection under title IX is at

22

least consistent with the one action it took in that

23

regard.

Of course, Congress has expressly

MR. KLEIN:

States aren't sued under

Right.

Maybe I hadn't made myself

8

clear, I don't believe.

What I was trying to suggest is

9

that the notion that Congress might have intended broader

10

protections in general, not specifically with respect to

11

municipalities, under title IX than under 1983 is

12

consistent with the fact that under title IX they

13

eliminated a protection conventionally available for the

14

States.

cities.

16
17
18

I agree that has no bearing directly on the

QUESTION:

Mr. Klein, what's your position on

punitive damages?
MR. KLEIN:

My position is that punitive damages

19

would be allowed, but I will acknowledge, Justice Kennedy,

20

that that doesn't follow inexorably from the conclusion

21

that compensatory damages would be allowed.

22

under section 1983 in cases like Facts Concert, has

23

suggested that punitive damages are a different matter

24

historically and otherwise with respect to municipalities.

25

And it seems to me at least an argument could be made,

The Court,

1

it's not an argument I would make, but an argument could

2

be made to that effect in the subsequent case.

3

of course, only presents compensatory damages.

QUESTION:

MR. KLEIN:

7

QUESTION:

9

Mr. Klein, couldn't an argument be

made that this isn't covered by 1983?

6

8

This case,

Yes.

That's what I suggested to - -

Have we held -- have we held that sex

discrimination is covered?
MR. KLEIN:

Have you held that sex

10

discrimination is covered under 1983?

11

guess what I would say is what you have held is that 1983

12

applies to the Constitution and the laws, and title IX is

13

a law, and under title IX sex discrimination is barred.

14

So my argument would be yes, it applies under 1983.

QUESTION:

Well, I don't -- I

I see what you're saying.

title IX -MR. KLEIN:

independent rights.

QUESTION:

I don't

It's a remedial -Mr. Klein, to the extent that the

Eleventh Amendment waiver is at least a relevant

was to open the States wide open to damage remedies as

Jordan?
MR. KLEIN:

2

Yes.

I think there are several --

3

several reasons to come to that conclusion, Justice

4

Souter, and I think they are quite strong.

5

of course, Atascadero itself was a case involving

6

compensatory damages and injunctive relief.

7

all, if you're only talking about an injunctive remedy it

8

seems there'd be no reason to possibly abrogate the

9

Eleventh Amendment.

10

QUESTION:

First of all,

Second of

Well, there wouldn't to the extent

11

that it was merely injunction, but to the extent that

12

equity would be awarding any monetary relief there would

13

be a reason.
MR. KLEIN:

14

That is correct.

And then I think,

15

to address that question specifically, the legislative

16

history and particularly this is a statute that was

17

introduced on the floor, an amendment introduced on the

18

floor and Senator Cranston introduced it.

19

states that the purpose of this is to allow all the

20

remedies, including damages, which we have always

21

intended.

22

that.

23

And he flatly

And so I think the clear consistent view is

And let me suggest there's another at least

24

inferential reason, Justice Souter, and aside from the

25

direct evidence, which is frankly not quoted in my brief

1

but quoted in the brief by the civil rights groups.

2

But the other reason to infer that is in 1984

3

this Court hadn't simply upheld back pay under Darrone.

4

It also said in Smith v. Robinson that the lower courts

5

generally agree that damages are available under 504.

6

against the legal climate that Congress was arguing in, I

7

think there's every reason to think it assumed, as the

8

Court had indicated, that damages and back pay were

9

available, once directly, once indirectly.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. KLEIN:

So

Okay.
I'd like to move back just a moment,

12

if I could, because I think this issue of direct

13

congressional intent bears some elaboration.

14

to move back and talk first about 1972 and-then about,

15

post-Cannon congressional intent.

16

consistent, but I think there's one difference that

17

becomes important.

I would like

I think they're

18

Now, first of all, I think, without trying to

19

re-argue the Cannon case, I think one or two key points

20

bear emphasizing, and that is in 1972 when Congress

21

enacted title IX there is no dispute it mirrored it on

22

title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

23

an analog that substituted sex for race.

24

two things had happened, however, that were key between

25

'64 and '72.

It was essentially

Title VI had been consistently and

1

frequently interpreted by the lower courts to provide a

2

private right of action.

3

Now, no lower court suggested a limitation on

4

remedy.

5

Court's cases uniformly made clear that a private, an

6

implied right of action means a right to damages.

7

what the jurisprudence was.

8

the notion of an implied right of action from damages.

9

And in the case that must be most relevant, in Sullivan v.

None.

At the same time between '64 and '72, this

That's

The Court had never uncoupled

10

Little Hunting Park, the Court concluded that an 1866

11

Civil Rights Act included an implied remedy for damages.
So it seems to me under conventional principles

12

13

still applied by this Court that title IX basically has to

14

be read as incorporating that congressional understanding.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Klein, was the language of

16

section 1866 -- rather of the 1866 Civil Rights Act --

17

with respect to remedies the same as the language of title

18

IX?

19
20

MR. KLEIN:

No, no, it was not, Mr. Chief

Justice.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. KLEIN:

Then why does one bear on the other?
Because the Court's principle in

23

several cases -- it was not just Sullivan, the 1982 case.

24

What the Court had adopted in Borak, in Sullivan, in

25

several other cases in this era, was if a statute

So I think the law

Now I realize that today the law is different

14

with respect to when you might imply a right of action.

15

But I'm looking at Congress' intent in 1972, and I would

16

submit to the Court that the two principles, that title VI

17

had a private right and that a private right had never

18

been uncoupled from a damages remedy by this Court, were

19

clear at that point.

20

the Court in Cannon itself relied on those cases expressly

21

in reaching the conclusion that there was an implied right

of action.

was cleared up in 1979 when Cannon came down because the
Court then said yes, you do have a private right of
action.

And in 1979 there had never been a case in this

Court that had uncoupled a private right of action from a
damages remedy.
And I suggest that Congress has taken two
actions since then that supports their understanding that
damages are available and as well the view that they
endorse that understanding.

One is the discussion I had

with Justice Souter a few moments ago about the Atascadero
statute, the Remedies Equalization Act which I think is
fairly read, particularly in light of its legislative
history, to support damages.
And second, .only last year in the Americans with
Disabilities Act which Congress passed it extended section
504.

Now, 504, just like title IX, is based on title VI,

and this Court has held that the three statutes in terms
of their remedial schemes are read in parry material.

And

what the Court held, what Congress did under 504 is to say
-- under the Americans with Disabilities, pardon me, is to
say look, we are now applying a right to programs that
don't get Federal monies.

That is 504 said if you get

Federal monies and discriminate on handicap, you're not
allowed to discriminate on handicap.

Then Congress says

we're going to extend that to State and local programs

that do not receive Federal monies, and in extending it it

2

says we intend to extend the damages remedy that has been

3

recognized under section 504.

4

that that intent reflects a consistent understanding.

And I suggest to you again

QUESTION:

Where is that in your brief?

MR. KLEIN:

That, unfortunately, and I

Congress reflected its understanding that that included a

3

So it seems to me that we now have a 20-year

relationship, basically from '72 to the present, where the

Court and Congress have interacted in a way that indicates

at least now that damages are under - - available under

undo that understanding.

I would suggest that the contrary is actually

Cannon, Guardians, and Darrone, to a point where at the

2

most under title IX and similar conditional spending power

3

statutes the relief that would be judicially available

4

would be equitable in nature and nothing beyond that.

5

feel that this line between equitable and traditional

6

damages remedies is a rational stopping point in the

7

development of the law, and we would suggest that if --

8

within the context of this case, the Court hold that

9

nothing more than equitable relief be available in the

context of a judicial proceeding.
We think that the cases of this Court state the

11
12

criteria for determining implied cause of action, and we

13

argue also for remedy is governed by congressional intent.

14

And under that method of analysis our view is no reading,

15

of the statute, no reading of the cases of this Court up

16

until now, particularly under conditional spending power

17

legislation, would authorize anything more than equitable

18

relief.

QUESTION:

What in this particular case, what

kind of equitable relief could possibly justify even

12

filing the lawsuit?

13

MR. PEARSON:

Well, there are two steps to the

14

process, and I think it's important to emphasize both.

15

The first is that the agency responsible for enforcing

title IX, the Office of Civil Rights, was called into the

MR. PEARSON:

for equitable - MR. PEARSON:

2

Well, we're not disputing the

existence of cause of action, but the question is is the

remedy that we're talking about in the context of this

case somehow an inversion of traditional, established

6

legal priorities, and the answer is in the law, by virtue

7

of the longstanding existence of the law of immunities,

8

equitable relief was in fact the primary exclusive relief

against immune institutions, both State by virtue of the

10

Eleventh Amendment and governmental.
QUESTION:

If it's an immune institution you wouldn't have any

MR. PEARSON:

There is an argument here in

against the individual wrongdoer, and there is a special,
more particularized showing that has to be made in order
to impute liability up to the institution.

I think the

inversion comes in their interpretation of title IX and
the identity of the defendant, and then you look at who
the wrongdoer is directly.

And that would be, under their

allegations in the case, the individuals who were involved
with this student.
So I would disagree with you in the suggestion
that we're inverting classical law equity relationship.
Suits against governmental entities have always been
treated differently because remedies at law are inadequate
and therefore equitable relief has been necessary.

Ex

parte Young fiction was the origin of that in modern
litigation, and it is carried all the way forward into the
contemporary era, and in fact lots of statutes view this,
I would assume, as being such a strongly held principle
that they exempted local subdivisions from the scope of
their laws.

Title VII, for example, was -- did not cover

State and local political subdivisions until it was
modified in 1972.
So we feel like that if you look at the
contemporary context within which title IX was enacted and
at statutory antecedent, title VI, the basic law was no
damages remedies against governmental defendants.

MR. NIGHTINGALE:
our position.

It is, Your Honor.

That is

In Davis v. Passman the Court said as much.

12

We're -- the petitioner suggests that title IX

13

should be construed with respect to precedents preceding

14

its enactment in 1972.

15

respect to that.

16

Elections, which is a case predating 1972, the Court did

17

recognize a private right of action limited to declaratory

18

-- declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.

19

to be sure, no request for damages in that case, but it

20

cannot fairly be said, I think, that the Court has never

21

considered the possibility, even before 1972, that damages

22

necessarily accompanied any private right of action.

23

I have a couple of points with

First of all, in Allen v. State Board of

Secondly, last term in the Virginia Bankshares

16

The issue before the Court, in other

The 1986 congressional action on its face

17

doesn't tell us very much about what the 1972 Congress

18

itself meant, and therefore we believe that it should not

19

displace the Court's consideration and the materials that

20

were determinative as of 1972.

21

Beyond that, on its face the text of the 19 --

22

1986 act only says that remedies, including actions at

23

equity and at law, will be available from State entities

24

to the same extent as they would be applicable from

private parties.

The goal was to equalize remedies,

Our position is that the same remedies are

QUESTION:

When you talk about this statute are

19

you emphasizing the fact that it's a Spending Clause

statute?

21

MR. NIGHTINGALE:

We are emphasizing the fact

22

that the obligation is tied to receipt of Federal funds

23

and therefore we believe it is significant, as members of

24

the Court have suggested, that entities be aware of what

25

sorts of obligations they are accepting.

QUESTION:

1

Well, you're not -- I gather then

2

that you're not proposing that we adopt a general rule

3

that anytime we find an implied cause of action in any

4

statute damages are not authorized unless Congress has

5

said so expressly?
MR. NIGHTINGALE:

6

The -- what we suggest, Your

7

Honor, is that the Court should approach the materials

8

relating to each statute and determine what remedies

9

Congress has authorized.

We don't believe that Congress

10

approaches this matter from the standpoint of an all-or-

11

nothing analysis.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL I. KLEIN

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KLEIN:

18

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

19

first point I'd like to make is that respondent and the

20

Solicitor General are here today asking the Court to

21

legislate between back pay on the one hand and damages on

22

the other.

23

enforcement to allow for back pay and not for damages.

24
25

They think that it's a better means of

I submit to the Court there is nothing in what
we have talked about today, in the legislative history, in

1

the enactments, in this Court's decisions, that would make

2

that distinction tenable.

3

significantly did not tell the Court what in the

4

legislative history, what in the statute supports back pay

5

and not damages.

6

And the Solicitor General

The second point that I want to emphasize is

7

that respondent's argument about money not being available

8

against cities and States is flatly inconsistent with the

9

back-pay remedy.

10

All of these arguments about immunity

cannot be squared with back pay.

They apply equally.

11

Second of all in that regard, respondent tells

12

us there was no back pay, there was no monetary remedies

13

against States and cities during this era.

14

let's look at the cases from '64 to '72 under title VI.

15

And what does he say?

16

but he's just told us that 1983 doesn't provide damages or

17

back pay against the cities.

18

were the ones that provided for the monetary relief.

19

Then he says

He said they all had 1983 actions,

So these title IX claims

Finally, I would submit, we have seen a fair

20

amount of historical revisionism here.

I asserted in my

21

opening argument and I will stick by it, if you read the

22

Court's precedents between '64 and '72, which I suggest is

23

the critical period because that's when title VII, title

24

VI, and title IX were passed, the one mirrored on the

25

other, those cases say if you have an implied right of

There could not have been damages.

The

11

period 1964 to 1972 -- again, the crucible I think we want

12

to look at for '72 intent - - not only had Congress passed

13

the Fair Housing Act, which included expressly a damages

14

- - which included a damages remedy expressly under civil

15

rights enforcement, not only had this Court come down with

16

Little Hunting Park, Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park,

17

which included a damages remedy under another civil rights

18

statute, but in addition to those events the key point is

19

that the notion that this would be an effective statute,

20

Justice Stevens, without damages for students is an

21

untenable one.

22

And the reason I say that is, look, what does

23

respondent and the Solicitor General say?

24

statute that applies to schools, and they say you can get

25

back pay under it.

Here we have a

primary beneficiaries?

2

That's what Congress had in mind.

3

pay is useless.

4

They are obviously students.
And for students back

Now, to be sure, any remedy can be mooted out,

5

as respondent suggests, if you give people what they want.

6

And if they gave our client the damages she is entitled to

7

we wouldn't go to court either, but it is strange to think

8

that Congress would have implied a remedy for back pay and

9

not for damages under a statute where back pay is

10

meaningless for most people.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Klein -- unless they had teachers

12

13

against teachers rather than students.

I mean, that's one

14
MR. KLEIN:

15

That's a feasible hypothesis, but I

16

think it's belied by the following, Justice Scalia, and

that is of course the same year they passed 19 - - title IX

18

they extended title VII to public and private -- to public

QUESTION:

21

So they already had the

Can I ask you, Mr. Klein, whether any

22

of the subsequent statutes that you talk about, the ones

23

following title IX, you cite them to show Congress'

24

understanding of -- they imply an understanding of title

25

IX.

Is there any disposition that they provide for which

1

would be altered if we did not adopt your understanding of

2

title IX?

3

MR. KLEIN:

I want to be careful in answering

4

this question to you in particular because what I said

5

before which I think is right is the Americans with

6

Disabilities Act says that it incorporates the remedies

7

under 504.

8

whatever the remedies are, that's what they are.

9

suggest to you is that Congress in the legislative history

Now, I understand that on its face that means
What I

10

indicated that it understood and intended those remedies

11

to include damages.

12

QUESTION:

On the face of the statute, no.
So if we should change and provide a

13

lesser remedy for title IX we would also produce a lesser

14

remedy for later enacted legislation?

15
16
17

MR. KLEIN:

That is my -- I think that is a

clear inference of what I've just said.
And the final distinction, if I might before I

18

sit down, is let's look at the difference between a

19

statute like title VII on the one hand and the Fair

20

Housing Act and title IX on the other.

21

back pay is going to be a meaningful remedy.

22

be a complete remedy, but it's going to be a remedy that's

going to ensure enforcement of the statute because it's a

significant one.
