MR. CALDWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Florida's death penalty statute, as the Supreme
Court of Florida held in 1972 --

I apologize, Justice O'Connor.

MR. CALDWELL:

QUESTION:

MR. CALDWELL:

20

In 1972, in State v. Dixon, the Florida Supreme

Am I audible now?

Yes.
Okay, good.

Court held that Florida's death penalty statute is

22

reserved for the most aggravated and least mitigated of

23

the most serious crimes.

position ever since.

25

It has held steadfastly to that

The Florida death penalty statute attains this

circumstances.

is the jury.

sentencing since the very earliest days of Florida's

statehood.

last year held that there is a State constitutional double

7

jeopardy right to a reasonable jury verdict.

8

there has been a reasonably arrived at life verdict, then

9

the defendant may not be sentenced to death.

The primary actor in this weighing process
The jury has been the main actor in Florida

And accordingly, the Supreme Court of Florida

That is, if

10

Accordingly, it is our position that Florida is

11

more like a Oklahoma and Mississippi, that is, it is more

12

like a jury-sentencing State than it is like a

13

judge-sentencing State, such as Arizona.

14

is important - -

15

QUESTION:

This distinction

Well, this Court has said in several

16

opinions, I guess, that it's a State that -- in which the

17

judge sentences.

18

MR. CALDWELL:

Justice O'Connor, it has said

19

repeatedly that ultimately Florida is a judge-sentencing

20

court.

21

also recognized in Proffitt and in other cases the primacy

22

in Florida -- jury -- sentencing of the penalty verdict.

23

And in Hitchcock, the Court held that it's necessary that

24

the jury as well as the judge not be restrained in the

25

consideration of mitigation.

That is correct.

Nevertheless, this Court has

For instance, the Court has always recognized

1

2

that the Florida system is a tripartite system.

And it is

3

clear from Florida law, and from this Court's recognition

4

of the primacy of Tedder v. State, that under Florida law,

5

the jury considers -- conducts the weighing in the first

6

instance.

7

The Court recognized that in Proffitt when it

8

discussed Tedder and the importance of the jury role in

9

sentencing, and when it discussed the heinous in the

10

circumstance.

11

heinous in the circumstance was constitutional as

12

construed in that decision, and that that provided

13

adequate guidance, both for the jury and for the

14

sentencing judge.

15

In Proffitt, the Court held that the

Where -- again, where there's been a life

16

verdict which has been reasonable arrived at after the

17

weighing of the sentencing circumstances, that is

18

dispositive of the sentencing decision in Florida.

19

Accordingly, it's -- the role of the jury cannot

20

be sentence -- cannot be ignored.

The Florida Supreme

21

Court has recognized that where there is a constitutional

22

defect in the jury proceeding, then the entire sentencing

23

proceeding is unconstitutional.

24

here, there's been an error in the trial court jury

25

sentencing phase of the case that makes the entire

Accordingly where, as

1

sentencing proceeding unconstitutionally defective.

2

that happened in this case.

3

And

First with respect to the cold, calculated, and

4

premeditation circumstance, the Florida Supreme Court held

5

that the evidence did not support that circumstance, and

6

that the trial court had improperly entered it into its

7

weighing process.

8

constitutionally required correct weighing of the

9

aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

Accordingly, Mr. Sochor did not get a

No actor in the

10

State's system properly weighed the aggravating and

11

mitigating circumstances, so that under Parker v. Dugger,

12

an error occurred.

13

would have been through a reweighing of the sentencing

14

circumstances.

15

long held that it does not reweigh circumstances.

The only way of correcting that error

QUESTION:

Well, they don't reweigh any

mitigating circumstances, do you?

20

MR. CALDWELL:

Yes, sir, I believe that they do.

21

They reweigh the mitigating evidence sometimes.

22

they don't.

QUESTION:

Sometimes

say?

The judge said that there were no

The short answer to your question

has to be qualified, I'm afraid.

16

it found some mitigation because there was substantial

mitigation before the sentencing jury.

The sentencing judge

He did discuss
We don't
Presumably

Accordingly, the jury certainly, because it was

1

presented with an improper aggravating circumstance, and

20

had lots of mitigating circumstances before it - - the jury

21

did have mitigating circumstances to weigh against the

22

aggravation, and therefore, the jury part of the weighing

23

process was improper.

you off your argument, but don't you mean that the jury

3

MR. CALDWELL:

It didn't find any

Justice Souter, that is correct.

4

The jury does not make specific findings one way or the

5

other.
QUESTION:

6

Okay.

So what it was weighing is - -

7

against the aggravating circumstances what it was weighing

8

was evidence.

9

evidence, mitigating evidence.

Not specific findings, but it was weighing

MR. CALDWELL:

10

No specific findings, yes, sir.

11

However, there were mitigating circumstances presented to

12

the jury pertaining to Mr. Sochor's mental state at the

13

time of the event.

14

QUESTION:

But what you mean is that there was

15

evidence which had a mitigating tendency.

16

you mean?

17
18

MR. CALDWELL:

In part, yes, sir.

Isn't that what

Perhaps you

and I are talking about apples and oranges.

19

QUESTION:

Well, what I'm talking about -- when

20

I'm using the word circumstance, I'm talking about

21

specific findings which are provided for by statute -- the

22

finding, for example in this case, cold-blooded or what

23

not.

24

that had a mitigating tendency, it just gets confusing.

25

And I think what you mean, if I understand you correctly,

And when you use circumstance just to mean any fact

is that the jury had evidence of mitigating facts, but it

did not go through a purpose --a process of finding that

3

mitigating circumstances, as a term of art, existed.

MR. CALDWELL:

is extremely vague about what the jury does.

circumstances.

10

QUESTION:

Is

The Florida statute
The jury is

Yes, but the Florida statute, as I

11

understand it, does not say there are certain facts which

12

we will dignify by the term mitigating circumstances.

13

They are a, b, c, d, and e.

14

Florida law, is there?

15
16

MR. CALDWELL:

There is no such provision in

The statute has a list of

mitigating circumstances.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CALDWELL:

19

QUESTION:

It does?
Yes, sir.

And is the jury instructed to find

20

them in the same -- or fail to find them -- in the same

21

sense that it is instructed to find or fail to find

22

aggravating circumstances?

MR. CALDWELL:

QUESTION:

25

Yes, sir.

That's --

So that in this case the jury had

mitigating evidence, but it in fact made no findings that

mitigating circumstances had actually been proven.
MR. CALDWELL:

2

Well, sir, it makes -- yes,

3

because it makes no find -- specific findings of fact as

4

to aggravating circumstances or mitigating circumstances.

5

It's a general verdict.

6

QUESTION:

Okay.

Oh.

7

QUESTION:

The jury then is charged as to its

8

duty to deal with aggravating circumstances and with

9

mitigating evidence, but then it simply returns a verdict

10

of death or not death.

11

MR. CALDWELL:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CALDWELL:

Yes, sir, it's a general verdict.

And it's an advisory verdict.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, that is

14

correct.

15

qualified in this way:

16

a life verdict, the judge must find it.

17

findings as to aggravating and mitigating circumstances

18

are disregarded on appeal.

19
20

It is an advisory verdict.

QUESTION:

However, it is

that if it is reasonable and it's
And the judge's

Yes, but here it was not a life

verdict, was it?
MR. CALDWELL:

21

No, sir.

It was a verdict for

22

death.

However, again under Florida law, the judge is

23

ordinarily expected to follow the penalty verdict.

24

way of looking at what the judge does in the sentencing

25

order is the judge's order rationalizes the verdict.

1

We've had a couple of cases earlier

2

on, Spaziano and then per curiam several years later, kind

3

of explaining what we thought that process was.

4

MR. CALDWELL:

The Florida process is that the

5

jury in the first instance makes the determination as to

6

whether it should be a death sentence or a life sentence.

7

And it bases that on the weighing of aggravating and

8

mitigating circumstances.

is a death verdict, it's almost that close.

14

the judge does in the sentencing order is basically

And the judge is - - where there's a life verdict,

And when there

MR. CALDWELL:

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Souter.

In other words, he doesn't come in

with a general verdict, as it were.

death penalty, and that there are no mitigating

circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances?

5

Where do you find the ambiguity there?

6

MR. CALDWELL:

Well, he says that he is weighing

the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, so there is

some weighing going on there.

QUESTION:

But let me emphasize --

There is certainly -- you have to

read something else from an earlier part of the paragraph

12

The -- I think

The important point that I am trying to make and

13

that I started off with was that, nevertheless, the

14

Once there is a life verdict, then it's presumed that the

2

jury found all of the statutory and nonstatutory

3

mitigating circumstances.

4

error which could have affected the jury verdict, then

5

we're in an entirely different position.

6

So that when there has been an

And that's what our argument is:

that under

7

Florida, the jury's verdict is so important that it -- if

8

the error could have affected that, and that there could

9

reasonable have been a life verdict, then it is as though

10

all of those mitigating circumstances were found.

11

that's -- that is something that is as clear as anything

12

from Florida law.

13

well before Proffitt.

14

And

It's been part of Florida law since

The Court recognized that in Proffitt that under

15

the so-called Tedder doctrine, that the jury is the

16

primary decision maker, and that where there has been this

17

reasonably arrived at life verdict, these sorts of

18

findings made by the judge just don't count for anything.

19

And we set out in somewhat excruciating detail in our

20

brief all of the cases which say that again and again.

21

The primacy of the jury plays into both of the

22

issues before the Court.

I'd like to talk briefly about

23

the second issue as to the especially heinous, atrocious,

24

or cruel aggravating circumstance, which this Court has

25

dealt with many times since Proffitt.

Very well, Mr. Caldwell.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I think from the onset I would like to clarify a

point, if in fact any confusion exists, with regard to

something that was provided in the State's brief.

that is that the Tedder standard is not applied when a

in creating a mechanism under the statute that allows for

17

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

That recommendation is given

18

the same recommendation as a life recommendation.

19

that is that when the appellate court reviews it, because

20

-- one other point before I finish that -- is that in the

appropriate sentence based on the aggravating and

6

mitigating circumstances that are being presented to him

at the sentencing proceeding.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Well, if he doesn't give it any

weight at all, why does Florida go through the process of
having the jury make a recommendation?
MS. SNURKOWSKI:

11

Because the weight that's being

12

given the recommended sentence is an appellate weight.

13

It's for the Florida Supreme Court to ascertain whether in

14

fact the conscious of the community has spoken in such a

15

way.

And then we have a standard that articulates that we do

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

Death gets great weight also.

They both do.
Because in fact, the great

10

weight that is given the death recommendation equates to

11

no mercy.

12

with the idea that the conscience of the community has

13

expressed its view that when death has been recommended by

14

a jury, no mercy is to be given.

And the Florida Supreme Court is then faced

QUESTION:

15

Perhaps I'm under an misimpression.

16

I had thought, under the Florida system, that as the jury

17

returns the recommendation of life, that the trial judge

18

can upset that only if he finds that no reasonable jury

19

could have come to that conclusion.

20

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

That's an appellate review of

that.

He has to explain in his order, his written order, the

basis for that.

The trial court does not make that determination.

himself.

3

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

4

QUESTION:

That's --

If you're a trial judge in Florida,

5

and you receive a verdict from a jury which recommends

6

life, my understanding that the trial court's duty is to

7

sentence him to life unless he can find that no reasonable

8

jury could have come to that conclusion.

9

correct?
MS. SNURKOWSKI:

10

Isn't that

I think his obligation is to

11

sentence and make a determination if there is aggravating

12

factors that even qualify individual A for death: and

13

second of all, determine if the aggravating outweighs the

14

mitigation; and then third, he makes a statement with

15

regard to why he believes no rational juror would have --

16

would differ from this result.

Florida is so -- our State -- is so important, because the

3

Florida Supreme Court is the entity.

4

which we bring in, we build into the appellate process the

5

consideration of the jury, the conscience of the

6

community.

7

because they are not required, nor should they be

8

required, to give reasons.

9

give reasons is the trial judge.

10
11

This is the means by

There is no other way we can articulate that

The only person who has to
He has to make those

findings.
Now, true, as I have stated before, that in

12

fact, under the appellate function, the appellate court in

13

reviewing the appropriateness of that expression of mercy,

14

whether no mercy or not, must give deference to that

15

recommendation.

16

is not a standard used by the appellate court in

17

determining the appropriateness of the jury's

18

recommendation of death.

But as I started out my argument, Tedder

The State would ask this Court to affirm the
Florida Supreme Court.

Thank you.

asking about the difference between proportionality

analysis and a harmless error analysis.

4

our initial brief, we cite the case of Lucas v. State,

5

where the Supreme Court of Florida makes it clear they're

6

different analyses.

7

death penalty was proportionate and said we cannot say,

8

however, that the court properly found the death sentence

9

appropriate.

At footnote 14 of

In Lucas, the court held that the

And they reversed.

The only other matter I want to address was the

10
11

State has said that the -- in effect that the jury does

12

not weigh circumstances.

13

or not.

14

instruction on mercy.

15

to weigh circumstances.

16

about that.

17

It makes a decision as to mercy

The Florida Supreme Court does not allow a jury
It does -- the jury is instructed
