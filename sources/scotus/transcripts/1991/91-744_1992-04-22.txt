ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHRYN KOLBERT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. KOLBERT:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Whether our Constitution endows Government with

12

13

the power to force a woman to continue or to end a

14

pregnancy against her will is the central question in this

15

case.

16

generation of American women have come of age secure in

17

the knowledge that the Constitution provides the highest

18

level of protection for their child-bearing decisions.

19

Since this Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, a

This landmark decision, which necessarily and

20

logically flows from a century of this Court's

21

jurisprudence, not only protects rights of bodily

22

integrity and autonomy, but has enabled millions of women

23

to participate fully and equally in society.

24
25

The genius of Roe and the Constitution is that
it fully protects rights of fundamental importance.

Government may not chip away at fundamental rights, nor

2

make them selectively available only to the most

3

privileged women.
If the right to choose abortion remains

4
5

fundamental as established in Roe v. Wade, the strict

6

scrutiny standard is applicable, and as this Court found

7

in Akron and in Thornburgh, Pennsylvania's onerous

8

restrictions must fall.
Should this Court abandon strict scrutiny, as

9
10

urged by the Commonwealth and the Solicitor, not only

11

might Pennsylvania's egregious intrusions on privacy stand

12

and a century of this Court's privacy decisions may also

13

be dismantled.

14

remove fundamental protection for the abortion right,

15

women might again be forced to the back alleys for their

16

medical care with grave consequences for their lives and

17

health.

18

Equally disturbing, should this Court

The Commonwealth argues that this Court may

19

overrule Akron and Thornburgh and abandon strict scrutiny

20

and nevertheless preserve Roe's central meaning.

21

politically expedient, this view is certainly not based

22

upon this Court's privacy jurisprudence.

offered by Roe's heightened scrutiny lies at the core of

this important decision.

back a fundamental right that has been part of the settled

2

rights and expectations of literally millions of Americans

3

for nearly two decades.

4

States suddenly to impose burdensome regulations, or to

5

criminalize conduct, would be incompatible with any notion

of principled constitutional decision-making.

7

To regress now by permitting

Roe is both soundly based in the Constitution

8

and sets forth a fair and workable standard of

9

adjudication.

From as early as 1891, this Court has

10

recognized that the rights of autonomy, bodily integrity,

11

and equality are central to our notions of ordered

12

liberty.

13

Roe lies at the heart of those interests.
While pregnancy may be a blessed act when

14

planned or wanted, forced pregnancy, like any forced

15

bodily invasion, is anathema to American values and

16

traditions.

17

for Government to force a man or a woman to donate bone

18

marrow, or to compel the contribution of a kidney to

19

another, or to compel women to undergo abortion or forced

20

sterilization, our Constitution protects women against

21

forced pregnancy.

will jeopardize a woman's life or health, the

23

constitutional protections ought to be greater.

24
25

In the same way that it would be unacceptable

If anything, because forced pregnancy

The Solicitor tries to draw a distinction
between constitutional protection against forced abortion,

which he agrees is fundamental, and constitutional
protection against forced pregnancy, which he maligns, but
once this Court removes fundamental status from the
abortion right, there is no logical stopping point.
Fundamental status for all reproductive rights,
decisions about birth control, pregnancy, sterilization,
even high technology around reproduction, may also be
jeopardized.

Particularly where there is no bright line

between abortion and some methods of birth control, the
fundamental right both to prevent pregnancy and to end
pregnancy may be at stake.
Our Nation's history and tradition also respects
the autonomy of individuals to make life choices
consistent with their own moral and conscientious beliefs.
Our Constitution has long recognized an individual's right
to make private and intimate decisions about marriage and
family life, the upbringing of children, the ability to
use contraception.

The decision to terminate a pregnancy

or to carry it to term is no different in kind.
Both the Solicitor and some Commonwealth amici
argue that the Constitution only protects private
decision-making within families.

It is true that the

rights of privacy have been recognized in the familial
context.

For example, in Griswold the Court found

unconstitutional the Connecticut statute that prohibited

1

married persons from using birth control and in Loving

2

this Court found invalid a Virginia statute that

3

prohibited the marriage of interracial couples.

4

Nevertheless, this Court has never limited the

5

notions of privacy recognized in these Cases as only

6

arising or belonging to married couples.

7

Eisenstadt and in Carey this Court specifically rejected

8

this view.

9

Indeed, in

Nor can this Court alter its historic

10

recognition of privacy and deny women fundamental freedoms

11

because, as the Solicitor argues, the woman is not

12

isolated in her privacy.

13

require individuals to sacrifice their lives or health for

14

others or for other compelling purposes, it cannot require

15

women to sacrifice their lives and health to further the

16

State's interest in potential life.

QUESTION:

Surely if the Government cannot

Ms. Kolbert, you're arguing the case

18

as though all we have before us is whether to apply stare

19

decisis and preserve Roe v. Wade in all its aspects.

20

Nevertheless, we granted certiorari on some specific

21

questions in this case.

22

those in your argument?

23

MS. KOLBERT:

Do you plan to address any of

Your Honor, I do.

However, the

24

central question in the case is what is the standard that

25

this Court uses to evaluate the restrictions that are at

1

issue, and therefore one cannot -QUESTION:

2

Well, the standard may affect the

3

outcome or it may *not, but at bottom we still have to deal

4

with specific issues, and I wondered if you were going to

5

address them.
MS. KOLBERT:

6

Yes, I am, Your Honor, and I would

7

like in particular to address the husband notification

8

provisions, but the standard that this Court applies will

9

well establish the outcome in this case for a variety of

10
11

reasons.
This Court has already found that under the

12

principles of Roe v. Wade the bulk of the Pennsylvania

13

statute is unconstitutional.

14

this Court struck down as unconstitutional under strict

15

scrutiny the bias counseling provisions and the 24-hour

16

mandatory delay both in Thornburgh and in Akron, the case

17

in 1983, and therefore this Court must examine first the

18

question of what's the appropriate standard before

19

determining the constitutionality of those other

20

provisions.

21

There is no question that

The Court cannot alter its historic recognition

22

of privacy and deny women fundamental freedoms, as I was

23

speaking, because as the Solicitor argues, there is the

24

presence of the fetus.

25

Surely, if the Government cannot require

1

individuals to sacrifice their lives or health for human

2

beings who are born for other compelling purposes, they

3

cannot do so for purposes of protecting potential fetal

4

life.

5

And if this Court is to reduce the presence of a

6

constitutional right merely because of the presence of the

7

fetus, other childbearing decisions, whether they be the

8

right to carry the pregnancy to term or make other

9

childbearing decisions will be particularly affected.

10

Particularly here, as this Court noted in Roe

11

where there is widespread disagreement in both a

12

philosophical and a religious sense about when life

13

begins, this Court cannot sanction one view to the

14

detriment of women's lives and health; nor can the state

15

of the law in 1868 define or determine constitutional

16

rights for all future generations.

17

This Court must look generally to whether a

18

right is reflected in our Nation's history and traditions

19

rather than at whether the activity was illegal at the

20

time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.

21

exclusively on what 50 States have legislated in

22

determining the scope of liberty would imperil numerous

23

freedoms such as rights recognized by this Court in Brown,

24

Bolling, Griswold and Loving.

QUESTION:

Ms. Kolbert, on this last point, I am

2

not sure what you suggest we look to.

not look to what the practice was in 1868.

to what the practice was at the time of Roe or what the

practice is today?

left to their own devices?

You say we should
Should we look

That is, what the States would do,

MS. KOLBERT:

Your Honor, I believe that you

8

have to look very generally at whether the Nation's

9

history and tradition has respected interests of bodily

10

integrity and autonomy and whether there has been a

11

tradition of respect for equality of women.

12

central and core values - -

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. KOLBERT:

Those are the

But not to abortion in particular?
Well, this Court is -- if the

15

Court was only to look at whether abortion was illegal in

16

1868, that is at the time of the adoption of the

17

Fourteenth Amendment, it would be placed in a very

18

difficult situation because at the time of the founding of

19

the Nation, at the time that the Constitution was adopted,

20

abortion was legal.

21

QUESTION:

22

23

Pick 1968, I gather you wouldn't

accept 1968 either though.
MS. KOLBERT:

Well, we think that the Court

24

ought to look generally at the principles that this

25

decision protects.

That while it is important to look -12

1

and I would not urge you to ignore the state of the law at

2

different periods of our history, it is only one factor in

3

a variety of factors that this Court has to look to in

4

determining whether or not something is fundamental.
And fundamental status in this instance derives

5
6

from a history of this Court's acknowledgement and

7

acceptance that private, autonomous decisions made by

8

women in the privacy of their families ought to be

9

respected and accorded fundamental status.
Certainly, the anomalous posture of the fact

10
11

that abortion was legal at the time of the founding of the

12

Constitution and then illegal at the time of the adoption

13

of the Fourteenth Amendment would place this Court in a

14

very difficult position, that is, rights may be guaranteed

15

under the Fifth Amendment and not the Fourteenth, merely

16

because only the exact state of the law in 1868 is the

17

factor that the Court accepts.

18

QUESTION:

This is not an antiquarian argument

19

you are making.

20

1868.

21

States disfavor abortion is no justification for this

22

Court's saying that it is not therefore included within

23

it.

24
25

You would have made the same argument in

I think you would have said the mere fact that most

You would have made that same argument in 1868.
MS. KOLBERT:

I would, and that is the argument

that this Court has made in many instances in rejecting
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

exactly the state of the law prior to the granting of
fundamental status.
That is, this Court, if we were only to look at
whether State legislatures prohibited activity in
determining whether or not an activity is fundamental,
many of the most precious rights that we now have:
rights to travel, rights to vote, rights to be free from
racial segregation would not be accorded status because in
fact, State legislators have acted to inhibit those rights
at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Some of those are mentioned in the

Constitution like racial segregation.
MS. KOLBERT:

Your Honor, this Court has

recognized that the rights at issue here, that is, the
rights of privacy, the rights of autonomy flow from the
liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which is also
mentioned in the Constitution.
The debate centers on what is the meaning of
that term liberty, and we think that the precedence of
this Court that began at the end of the 19th Century and
have proceeded from this Court to the very present, would
logically and necessarily include fundamental rights to
decide whether to carry a pregnancy to term or to
terminate that pregnancy.
QUESTION:

I don't question the importance of
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260

your arguing that there is a fundamental right, as you
have done; however, there is a fundamental right to speech
and we hear any number of arguments in this case on time,
place and manner.

I don't think our decision on parental

notice in the Akron case is necessarily inconsistent with
a fundamental right.
But one way of our understanding this
fundamental rights and their parameters, their dimensions
is to decide on a case-by-case basis, and you have a
number of specific provisions here that I think you should
address.
MS. KOLBERT:

The critical factor is whether, as

a result of its fundamental status, this Court will accord
the standard of Roe, that is, strict scrutiny because
under that standard there is no dispute among the parties.
Under that standard, the bias counseling provisions, the
24 hour mandatory delay have been found unconstitutional,
and significantly, this Court has also gone so far as to
say that the husband consent requirements, very similar to
the husband notification requirements at issue in this
case, have also been found unconstitutional -QUESTION:

I am suggesting that our sustaining

these statutory provisions does not necessarily undercut
all of the holding of Roe v. Wade.
MS. KOLBERT:

It is our position, Your Honor,
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that if this Court were to change the standard of strict

2

scrutiny, which has been the central core of that holding,

3

that in fact, that will undercut the holdings of this

4

Court and effectively overrule Roe v. Wade.
To adopt a lesser standard, to abandon strict

5
6

scrutiny for a less protective standard such as the undue

7

burden test or the rational relationship test, which has

8

been discussed by this Court on many occasions, would be

9

the same as overruling Roe for it is the beauty of Roe,

10

the protections of Roe flow from the fact that this Court

11

gives, upon a proof that particular State regulations

12

interfere with the right.
Roe establishes and creates a burden on

13
14

Government to come forward with a compelling purpose.
QUESTION:

15

Well, if you are going to argue that

16

Roe can survive only in its most rigid formulation, that

17

is an election you can make as counsel.

18

to you that that is not the only logical possibility in

19

this case.

20

MS. KOLBERT:

I am suggesting

Our position is that Roe, in

21

establishing a trimester framework, in establishing strict

22

scrutiny, and in also establishing that the rights of

23

women and the health interests of women always take

24

precedent over the State's interest in potential life.

25

Those hallmarks of Roe are central to this case,

1

and are central to continuing recognition of the right as

2

fundamental.

QUESTION:

3
4

Should the Court abandon that - But did the Court hold that, even

after viability of the fetus in Roe?

5

MS. KOLBERT:

6

QUESTION:

What the Court - -

Do you think that was a correct

7

characterization of Roe's holding that you just gave, that

8

the woman's interest always takes precedence?

9

true under Roe, in the latter stages of pregnancy?
MS. KOLBERT:

10

Is that

Your Honor, under Roe, after the

11

point of viability, that is the point when the fetus is

12

capable of survival, the State is free to prohibit

13

abortion but only so long as it is necessary, only so long

14

as the woman's health interests and life interests are not

15

at stake.

16

That is, potential fetal life is a recognized

17

value, is a recognized State interest after the point of

18

viability; but when in conflict, when the woman's health

19

interest is in conflict with those State interests and

20

potential life, those women's interest, the women's

21

interest in health take precedent.

22

Now admittedly, the question of viability and

23

the viability line is not as present in this case as it

24

has been in many of the other cases that this Court has

25

seen before here.

That is, all of the restrictions that

1

are issue in Pennsylvania attach in pregnancy at the very

2

beginning of pregnancy, and therefore, the State's

3

interest in protection of fetal life really does not into

4

play.

5

The real issue is whether or not these health

6

interests, that is whether or not the State's interest in

7

protecting a compelling interest in health are present.

8

And frankly, this Court need only look to the record, that

9

is, need only look to the findings of the district court

10

to determine that this statute in no way furthers women's

11

health interests.

12

That in fact, what this statute does is cause a

13

detriment to women's health, submit her to increased

14

dangers as a result of delay, as a result of interference

15

with the doctor/patient relationship, as a result of

16

permitting third parties who would injure individuals who

17

the district court made 387 findings of fact and

performance of abortion to further no legitimate State

QUESTION:

Would you say that the State could

had intercourse that she planned to use some means of

you think?

MR. PREATE:

understand it, is that whether or not the regulation would

impose such an absolute obstacle, not whether it would

21

deter or inhibit some women from obtaining an abortion.

22

QUESTION:

23

provision for notification in this case under the statute

24

your standard.
MR. PREATE:

2

Well, if the State had posited its

3

interest as protecting the life of the unborn then

4

utilizing the rational basis standard, then I would submit

5

that it could legitimately require that kind of

6

notification to all people.

7

In this instance, however, we have a different

8

statute.

We have a statute that provides exceptions where

9

exceptions are appropriate, and there are five of them:

10

medical emergency, where the husband is not the father of

11

the child, where the husband cannot be found, where the

12

pregnancy is the result of a reported sexual assault, or

13

where the woman in her judgment believes it's likely that

14

she will be physically abused.

15

Now, petitioners have produced some testimony

16

and made some argument, essentially through one expert,

17

about battered wives, but the testimony was that some

18

unknown number were rendered so helpless by their

19

battering husbands that they were incapable of checking

20

off a line on the form, the spousal notice form.

burdened, but they're not burdened by the statute, and

analysis scenario, and you have to look and see if it

10

could be constitutionally applied and value-tied to

12

record reflects that right now, in Pennsylvania, 50,000

13

abortions, 20 percent of those women are married and

14

95 percent of those women notify their husbands.

Therefore, only 1 percent of the women are not,

alternatives to it.

MR. PREATE:

extraordinarily difficult question which this Court need

GENERAL STARR:

GENERAL STARR:

2

Well I think that that is the

3

necessary consequence of Roe v. Wade.

4

the key point is that a number of the Justices of this

that constitutional question, that the State does have a

7

compelling interest in the potential life, in fetal life,

8

and that that interest runs throughout pregnancy.
QUESTION:

But I think that

We did not say in Roe that a State

11

did we?

12

GENERAL STARR:

13

QUESTION:

Certainly the Court --

We said that the Constitution takes

14

no position on whether a fetus is a person, and/or that it

does take a position that a fetus is not protected by the

Constitution.

GENERAL STARR:

possibility of State regulation to protect the unborn at

QUESTION:

Including State regulation on the

basis of the people's determination within that State that
