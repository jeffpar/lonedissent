ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

11

GENERAL STARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the

12

Constitution provides that representatives shall be

13

apportioned among the several states according to their

14

respective numbers.

15

judgment of a three judge district court holding

16

unconstitutional the act of Congress that since 1941 has

17

governed the apportionment of representatives among the

18

several states.

19

judge district court in Massachusetts has very recently

20

come to the opposite conclusion, rebuffing a

21

constitutional challenge mounted by the Commonwealth of

22

Massachusetts.

23

This case brings before the Court the

fractional remainders in the apportionment of

2

representatives to the states.

3

problem arises because of two things.

4

Constitution by its terms requires that no matter how

5

sparsely populated the state, each state shall have at

6

least one representative in the House.

implicit Constitutional requirement, that no district

8

shall transgress or cross a state line.

The fractional remainder
First, the

And secondly, the

Strangely enough, we haven't been

consistent over the century, have we?
GENERAL STARR:

11

The Congress has not been

12

consistent in terns of the specific method that has been

13

employed, but what Congress has done, Justice Blackmun, is

14

to examine what it believes to be the most appropriate

15

method, including, as the Court is aware, at the founding

16

that Congress in 1792 in response to the debate in those

17

early years determined in the wake of President

18

Washington's veto to disregard fractional remainders

19

entirely.

20

the first 5 decades.

21

the method was changed, and indeed over the decades

22

Congress has used no fewer than four methods of

23

apportionment.

2

GENERAL STARR:

3

QUESTION:

4

That's exactly right.

And that is not in the Constitution,

is it?

5

GENERAL STARR:

That is not.

It has always been

6

thought, as has this question, to be a matter entrusted to

7

the judgment of the Congress of the United States.

8

fact in federalist '55 Madison said quite plainly that no

political problem admits of a less precise solution than

the size of the House of Representatives.

11

before the Court today flows quite naturally from that,

12

because until 1911 Congress always had the option, which

13

it exercised from time to time, of increasing the size of

14

the House of Representatives.

15

17

viewed as falling to Congress and not admitting the --

QUESTION:

Nonetheless it is one that

Well, this problem in Massachusetts

19

and Montana certainly could be cured by increasing the

20

size.

21

GENERAL STARR:

Yes, it could.

The problem of

22

fractional remainders would not, there would still have to

23

be a method for dealing with fractional remainders.

24

Montana could eventually get an additional representative

But

1

But Madison wisely advised at the founding that a

2

representative body should not be so numerous that it

3

becomes similar to an Athenian assembly, and yet it should

4

be large enough to be representative of the people as a

5

whole.
And since 1911 the Congress has fixed the size

6

7

of the House of Representatives at 435, and neither court

8

now to address this issue has suggested that it would be

9

appropriate for the judiciary to mandate to override

10

Congress' judgment as to the size of its own House.
QUESTION:

11

Has any calculation been done to show

12

how large the House would have to be in order to have

13

precise apportionment?

14

GENERAL STARR:

In order to have precise

15

apportionment, I am not sure that that calculation has

16

been done.

calculation.

At least I am certainly not aware of any

Mr. Starr, what is the status of the

GENERAL STARR:

The status is that a final

21

judgment has been rendered, and the United States is

22

presently considering precisely what to do.

23

several alternatives that we are presently actively

24

considering and we will come to closure on that within a

25

matter of a very few days.

Massachusetts court directs action to be taken by March

rejected the constitutional challenge but overturned the

apportionment on non constitutional grounds.

That again is a decision, as the Court is aware, that

QUESTION:

5

I'm not sure that you would ever

6

solve the fractional remainder problem by any reasonable

7

increase in the size of the House of Representatives.

8

you increased it to a point where Montana was clearly

9

entitled to two, you'd probably have a situation where

If

10

Washington was almost entitled to a couple more, but not

11

exactly.

12

the size of the House would ever solve the fractional

13

remainder problem.

I mean, I don't think reasonable increases in

14

GENERAL STARR:

15

It would not ultimately solve it.

16

Montana's concern about maintaining its two

17

representatives would be solved under the existing method

18

if the size of the House were increased by approximately

19

six or seven representatives, then under this

20

apportionment method it would eventually be entitled to

21

that additional representative.

22

I think the point is well taken.
I meant to suggest that

But I think the Chief Justice is making the

23

critical point here.

24

someone is going to be a loser, inevitably.

25

And in 1980,

1

pleased because it was comparatively over represented, and

2

the two representatives who are parties to this action

3

trumpeted the virtues of the equal proportions method.

4

Which again suggests that ultimately this is a debate that

5

should go on among the states as represented in the

6

Congress of the United States, and thus we do believe that

7

this is a matter that is entrusted to the discretion of

8

the Congress.
QUESTION:

9

Of course there's no express

10

delegation to the Congress in the Constitution to do this,

11

is there?
GENERAL STARR:

12

There is none, but it has been

13

viewed, as Justice Story stated in the 1830's in Prigg

14

against Pennsylvania, as flowing ineluctably from the very

15

nature of the plan of power.
QUESTION:

16

Did the present method of

17

apportionment, did that, that was an act of Congress, was

GENERAL STARR:

1

Oh, I am sorry, in terms of the

2

presentation.

Congress has done this by an act of

3

Congress, by statute, and presenting it, and no one has

4

questioned that that is a matter that is entrusted to the

5

political branches, that that is --

6

QUESTION:

Well, but not to the Congress.

7

GENERAL STARR:

Not to the Congress entirely,

8

but to the political branches, but Congress' discretion is

9

quite broad.

But to answer your question specifically,

10

Justice White, the statute was enacted in 1941 with the

11

expectation that this would bring stability and finality

12

to the process.

13

effected in the House of Representatives every two years,

14

a matter that cries out for a quick and speedy resolution,

15

and that's why Congress has imposed very precise and

16

demanding statutory duties in terms of the time table for

17

completing the census, for doing the calculations and then

18

making the report from the President to the Congress.

19

This is obviously, since elections are

QUESTION:

General Starr, what if Congress

20

decided to apportion it roughly, for the most part

21

according to population, but put an upper limit?

22

says, you know, California is getting awfully big, and we

23

think just as there's a minimum limit there ought to be a

24

maximum limit too.

25

that?

What if it did that?

meaning of the text, and it certainly is clear that what

21

Congress has been struggling to do over these many decades

is to come as close to quota as possible, and there's no

QUESTION:

3

Well, but suppose you were met with

4

that proposal.

Would you consider it consistent with your

5

constitutional duty to support that, if you supported that

6

proposal after you reviewed history, et cetera?
GENERAL STARR:

7

In terms of my own perception I

8

would be more guided by history, frankly, and I would view

9

it as difficult to depart from history.

I think history

10

illumines the meaning of the text.

Nonetheless, I do

11

think in terms as a matter of raw power that Congress

12

could see fit to engage in, and my colleagues therefore

13

who might not share my perspective as to the illumination

14

that history provides, might very well say we do have a

15

political problem in this country that we want to solve,

16

namely the largest states have become a little bit too

17

large and we need to in fact give a little bit of bias in

18

favor of the smaller states.
But there is still a rational relationship to

19
20

population.

21

would be not only anticonstitutional, it would be clearly

22

unconstitutional to simply ignore the numbers or ignore

23

the population of the respective states.

24
25

That's what can't be done, quite clearly.

QUESTION:

There has to be some rational

relation?

It

GENERAL STARR:

1

Correct.

And I do think that is

2

subject to judicial review.

3

the political question doctrine does not shield all

4

aspects of Congress' action, and certainly if there were a

5

violation of a specific textual requirement, then the

6

courts can in fact call Congress to account for that.

7

as long as there's a rational relationship to population,

8

then it seems to us that that is a matter that the

9

political process should in fact handle.
QUESTION:

10

That's why we have said that

But

Well, General Starr, you're using the

11

political question idea then not as meaning barring

12

adjudication, but as a very heightened form of deference.
GENERAL STARR:

13

Well, that's one way of

14

formulating it.

15

precise issue of which of competing apportionment methods

16

that are indisputably related to population, once we reach

17

that stage then it seems to us that that issue is shielded

18

from -- and why is that, because under, for a variety of

19

reasons, but under Baker v. Carr what Congress is making

20

in choosing one apportionment method over another is a

21

basic policy choice about equity and fairness among the

22

states.

23

I think what I am suggesting is that the

QUESTION:

Well, sir, I'm not sure if that

24

qualifies as the traditional political question which, you

25

know, at one time was said a thicket that courts should

just stay out of, or simply saying that given the

2

constitutional standard of according to their respective

3

numbers, it leaves all sorts of reasonable alternatives

4

open to Congress that would be reviewed only if the

5

alternative weren't reasonable.
GENERAL STARR:

6

I think the Court could come at

7

it from that method of analysis as well by virtue of the

8

broad powers that Congress enjoys under the necessary and
proper clause, and that was the method that the

10

Massachusetts three judge court engaged in or used in

11

rejecting the constitutional claim.
But our basic submission is this, that it is

12

13

quite wrong to believe, as the three judge court in

14

Montana did, the majority did, that this Court's

15

articulation of the one person, one vote standard, which

16

of course was articulated and applied in the in-state

17

setting that was at issue in Wesberry and in Karcher

18

against Daggett, is applicable in this setting when that

1

standard or ideal of absolute equality cannot in fact be

20

achieved.

21

I should hasten to add that these methods are

22

extremely similar in terms of their results.

23

24

varies from method to method, and there are certain

variations.

results.

Court was concerned about in Wesberry, the problem of

rotten boroughs, as it were, which was of concern at the

It seems to us, in short, that the basic error

of the three judge court was to transplant to alien soil a

standard that does not apply, and in the process grossly

intruded into the province of Congress which quite clearly

20

has carefully, elaborately considered which method is best

that Joseph Story in his commentaries in the 1830's

the irony that Senator Hugo Black urged the adoption of

equal proportions, the author of Wesberry against Sanders.

concerning fractional remainders, that will always be a

mathematical concepts that are involved in all five of
these various formulas.

The Court in our judgment need

only determine which of the methods, which all have a
different measure of equity, and which one of those
methods is designed to meet the constitutional goal that
has been articulated by this Court in the intrastate
setting concerning apportionment.
QUESTION:

General Racicot, would you indicate

whether you think that in your view Congress has ever
apportioned the fractions in a way that meets the
Constitution?

It has used four different methods.

I have

the impression from reading your brief that none of them
would have met your test.
MR. RACICOT:

Justice O'Connor, in view of the

decisions of this Court, that is precisely what we mean to
indicate.

Although there has never been a case -QUESTION:

I think that's sort of an extreme

position to take when we're trying to interpret what the
Constitution requires and when the practice has gone back
so far in the Nation's history of permitting Congress to
make this sort of a determination.
MR. RACICOT:

Justice O'Connor, I think a close

examination of the apportionment history of this country
would find that there has been more accommodation than
there has been any process sustained in principle.

And

1

that in fact if one takes a look at the cases that have

2

been put forth by this Court with the intrastate

3

reapportionment processes that occur, one will find a very

4

simple thread throughout all of them, and that is, number

5

one, you determine an ideal population district, the

6

district size, by taking the total amount of the

7

population and dividing the number of seats that are

8

available.

9

then all the deviations are measured from that ideal

10

That determines an ideal district size, and

district size.
The only formula that is agreed by all of the

11

parties that does that is the Dean method, which has never

13

been used.

certainly been accommodations throughout our history, the

15

Dean method has never been used, and as a consequence does

not come to the point where it meets this Court's demands

within the intrastate setting.

require of Congress the same expectations that we require

of states and other local government entities.

In fact it says nothing at all,

except republican form of government.
MR. RACICOT:

That's right.

There is much more

of a textural reference to this particular process than
there is the one that this Court has found -QUESTION:

We didn't discover that until 1964,

which is, I suppose, your answer for why for almost 200
years we have never had the right solution, because this
Court didn't give the answer until 1964.

Wesberry, I'm

talking about.
MR. RACICOT:

That's precisely correct.

It is

also agreed without any question between the parties,
between the experts, between those states who have
appeared as amicus, between all concerned, that the ideal
district size pursuant to the 1990 census is 572,466
people.

With the Hill method, with the method of equal

proportions as presently codified in statute, Montana is
by far the largest district in the Nation with a
population of 803,655.

It exceeds the ideal district size

by 231,000 people, or by 40.4 percent.

So it takes in

Montana 800 people to have the same voting strength as 500
have in Idaho or Rhode Island.

MR. RACICOT:

perspectives, and that there's no consistent way to

MR. RACICOT:

QUESTION:

7

MR. RACICOT:

Yes.

Okay.
Under the method presently used by

Congress there is a total range, from the largest district

9

of Montana, at 803,000 to the smallest district, Wyoming,

10

at 455,000 people.

11

people, which is a 61 percent deviation from the ideal.

12

Under the method proposed by Montana, the method of

13

harmonic means, the most populous district would be South

14

Dakota, with 699,000 people, and the smallest would be

15

Montana, with 401,000, which produces a range of 298,000

16

people, rounded off.

17

There is a range, then, of 347,000

18

you're talking about these big percentages?

Supposing we

took in a new state, like Guam, which is very much smaller

20

than all the other states.

So isn't there

MR. RACICOT:

1

Your Honor, because there is a

2

requirement that each state be provided at least one,

3

there is some built in inequity, but in our judgment that

4

doesn't justify allowing the process to become more

5

unequal by the application of a formula that simply

6

doesn't produce the most equitable results.

7

We have then with the method of harmonic means,

8

the method advocated by the State of Montana, a deviation

9

of 52 percent from the ideal.

So quite obviously there

10

will always be some opportunity for deviation.

11

the Hill method or the method of equal proportions, the

12

statutory method presently there, there's a 61 percent

13

deviation from the ideal, which is reduced to a 52 percent

14

deviation from the ideal under the method of harmonic

15

means.

16

So under

And under Karcher and in the context of the

intrastate reapportionment cases, this Court has held that

a deviation of less than 1 percent from the ideal was not

precisely what occurred, that there was in fact an ideal

district size determined, then the range was determined,

and the Court affirmed the district court's order striking

down that districting plan which had less than 1 percent

in total deviation.

Now lest anyone question whether or not in fact

this has remained the principle and the method employed by

this Court, I would refer the Court to the Board of

in that particular case the Court once again pointed out

11

that the guarantee of 1 person, one vote extended to local

12

government apportionment as well as to congressional and

13

state districting plans.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

GENERAL STARR:

QUESTION:

Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.

Well, you have a lot of time, maybe

7

you could explain the five, the five different

mathematical systems to us.

GENERAL STARR:

I would like to submit that

point on the briefs.

(Laughter.)

GENERAL STARR:

Sv

You have

But with respect to the

.14

suggestion that equal proportions rides roughshod over

15

concerns about absolute differences, I refer the Court to

16

Footnote 38 in our brief, which I think goes a long way to

17

suggesting that there is, with all respect to our

18

colleagues from Montana, a certain artificiality about

19

their argument, even accepting, as we urge the Court not

20

to do, their basic proposition that Congress is bound by

21

the Constitution to embrace a particular measure of

22

equality.

23

But once we move beyond that area where we can

24

achieve absolute equality in crossing state lines, we see

25

in these rivers of inequality that have been referred to

as it would be under its proposed method, the state that

And when we look to those absolute deviations in

Essentially what Montana wants, and it's

8

population, I shouldn't use the term deviation, but

9

absolute differences, what we see is that it is not at all

10

curious that an equal proportions method designed to

11

achieve goals of equity and fairness results in a state

12

that has been over represented for some time, now being

13

relatively under represented for a period of time.

14

that it is curious in the extreme that the Constitution of

15

the United States would require Washington, with a higher

16

fractional remainder than that of Montana, to lose that

17

representative and give it to Montana with its 1.404 in

18

comparison to Washington state's 8.538.

19

And

With respect to the articulation of the

20

standard, yes, it's quite true that the Constitution does

21

not speak in words of equality.

22

that, but it has inferred it from section 1, using the

23

term the people.

Clause 3 speaks in terms of the states, a
process in which Congress or the states are represented,
are given their apportionment.

It is a process that

speaks in terms of that which history tells us, that it
has been a process entrusted to the political branches,
but political branches that have been quite sensitive to
the needs for basic fairness and equity.

And it is beyond

dispute that the equal proportions method, among others,
achieves those goals.
I thank the Court.
