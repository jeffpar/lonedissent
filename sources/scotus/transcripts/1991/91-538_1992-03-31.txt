CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Georgia v. The Nationalist Movement.

Mr. Stubbs.

Is the name of the county pronounced Forsyth or

Forsyth?

Forsyth, very good.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. STUBBS III

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13
14
15

MR. STUBBS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Forsyth County, which is a political subdivision

16

of the State of Georgia, comes before you to ask you to

17

reverse a decision of the Eleventh Circuit Court of

18

Appeals which invalidated as unconstitutional on its face

19

our Ordinance 34, which is our parade ordinance.

20

That ordinance imposes a fee for the use of

21

county property for expressive purposes.

The court below

22

found that the cap that we have on this fee of $1,000

23

exceeded a nominal amount.

24

reading of a case of this Court from 1943 called Murdock

25

v. Pennsylvania.

They based that finding on a

1

That case, we feel, does not say what the

2

Eleventh Circuit says it says, and we believe that the

3

true precedent to rely upon in our case is Cox v. New

4

Hampshire, a 1941 case of this Court, wherein at the

5

beginning of the consideration of the fee in the New

6

Hampshire statute, this Court said that there remains the

7

question of license fees, which as the court said,

8

referring to the New Hampshire court, had a permissible

9

range from $300 to a nominal amount, a recognition we

10

believe that indicates there is a difference between $300

11

and a nominal amount in 1941.

12

We believe the base upon which this Court

13

utilized in Cox to reach its conclusion there, may begin

14

with a review of the Constitution, article 4, section 3 of

15

the second paragraph which grants Congress, and I quote:

16

the power to make all needful rules and regulations

17

respecting property belonging to it.

18

The Tenth Amendment reserves to the States those

19

powers not otherwise taken away from them by the

20

Constitution, and this Court then in Cox stated basically

21

that it was undoubted that there is authority in a local

22

government to control the use of its property.

23

We believe that if this were not a government,

24

and if it did not involve the First Amendment, that there

25

would be no question that charging a fee for the use of

1

one's own property would be accepted as an inherent right

2

of ownership.

3

What this case represents is a clash between

4

that inherent right of property ownership and the public's

5

First Amendment rights to use public property for First

6

Amendment purposes.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Stubbs, that goes a little far,

8

doesn't it?

I mean, can the county charge me for jumping

9

up on a soapbox and just all by myself giving a speech,

10

not causing any interference with traffic, not requiring

11

any policeman?
MR. STUBBS:

12

13

Our ordinance would not require

you - -

14

QUESTION:

I know your ordinance wouldn't, but

15

your principle would allow the county to charge me for

16

that, it's the county's property after all.

17

the Fifth Amendment would allow you to charge for that?

18

MR. STUBBS:

Do you think

I think the Fifth Amendment allows

19

you to, if you have to administer an ordinance, and if you

20

have to police demonstrations, to charge a fee to offset

21

the cost of doing that.. To charge you for the privilege

22

of free speech, that is not allowed and that is not what

23

we are doing.

24
25

QUESTION:
arguing.

But that is the principle you were

You were arguing property rights it seems to me,

1

that just on the basis that it owns the property, the

2

State, despite the First Amendment, can charge.

3

doesn't seem to me right.

4

MR. STUBBS:

That

I don't mean to say that there is a

5

rental for the use of the property.

6

to offset time for administration and the policing costs

7

which may be necessitated depending on the nature of the

8

demonstration.

9

QUESTION:

The fee is designed

Now are we dealing here with the

10

quintessential public forum, the streets and open spaces

11

in the county?
MR. STUBBS:

12

Justice O'Connor, We believe that

13

for purposes of this case, the courthouse grounds can be

14

considered as a quintessential public forum; however, we

15

would note that in an Eleventh Circuit case, which name

16

escapes me, they took the Richard Russell Federal Building

17

in Atlanta and basically differentiated the different

18

types of forum, depending on where you stood in the

19

plaza - -

20

QUESTION:

For purposes of our resolution of

21

this case, you agree that we should decide it on the

22

grounds that it is a public forum?

23
24
25

MR. STUBBS:

We have no problem with you

deciding it on that basis.
QUESTION:

Now do you think that the

1

Constitution requires the county to make any exception for

2

indigents and those who are unable to pay a fee?

3
4

MR. STUBBS:

Yes, ma'am, we believe that, and we

do - -

5

QUESTION:

Do you think that this ordinance does

6

that when it doesn't extend it to a group that has no

7

assets?
MR. STUBBS:

8

9

distinction.
QUESTION:

10
11

We believe we can make that

How would you justify that, do you

suppose?
MR. STUBBS:

12

We justify it because a group,

13

first of all, a group -- each of the individuals, if they

14

don't have any assets, that group can then get a waiver of

15

the fee.

16

QUESTION:

But not under the terms of the

17

ordinance, which would extend only to individuals, I

18

thought.

19

MR. STUBBS:

No, I think the ordinance indicates

20

that each individual in a group applies for a waiver, then

21

the fee can be waived.

22

QUESTION:

So that if the group organizing a

23

particular gathering on the public streets in Forsyth

24

County wanted to get a permit, you would want an affidavit

25

of indigency from every person participating, is that it?

MR. STUBBS:

1

If it was a group that was not a

2

formal association or a corporation, under the terms of

3

our ordinance, that is what we are stuck with until we can

4

get back and fix it.
And as the Eleventh Circuit and the district

5
6

judge recognized, we have got a cumbersome problem with

7

that particular feature of our ordinance.
QUESTION:

8

9

organized group?
MR. STUBBS:

10
11

We think each individual could come

in and sign an indigency waiver.
QUESTION:

12

13

And if it were an informally

Do you think that is' at all

burdensome on the right of speech?

14

MR. STUBBS:

Not on the right of speech.

It is

15

inefficient, it is cumbersome, and we would like to fix it

16

when we get a chance - -

17

QUESTION:

What is the principle upon which you

18

base your conclusion that there must be an indigent

19

waiver?

20

Why don't the rich have an equal right to speech?
MR. STUBBS:

Justice Kennedy, we have reviewed

21

or tried to review this Court's cases, and there are

22

numerous indications in the past that the constitutional

23

rights that we all have cannot be denied by lack of funds.

24
25

QUESTION:

I can think of the appellate

transcript case, Griffin and Illinois, and I stop about

there.

Can you give me some help?

MR. STUBBS:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. STUBBS:

5

The poll tax case.
Pardon me?
The poll tax cases, I believe, were

only - -

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. STUBBS:

The poll tax cases?
Or some of them.

Where we draw the

8

line, though, is in an organized group like The

9

Nationalist Movement which is a corporation, and we

10

feel -QUESTION:

11

Wait a minute.

In the poll tax cases

12

were you allowed to charge poll taxes to rich people but

13

not to poor people?

14
15

MR. STUBBS:

Is that how we defined those cases?
As we read them, they invalidated

the poll tax because there was a bad motivation there.
QUESTION:

16

That's right.

Why isn't the same

17

here, you are either entitled to charge or you are not

18

entitled to charge.

19

can charge rich and poor alike.

20

MR. STUBBS:

If you are entitled to charge, you

There is an alternative way to

21

spread your message than to use county property, and a

22

poll tax situation, if you didn't pay the tax you couldn't

23

vote.

There was no alternative way to vote.

24
25

QUESTION:

That's right, you are agreeing with

me, then.

2

MR. STUBBS:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.
You don't have to make this

3

exception, you have just chosen to make this exception

4

between the rich and the poor?

5

MR. STUBBS:

We have chosen to make the

6

exception, but we believe that it is required to the

7

extent that if a poor person or a group of poor people

8

want to engage in some kind of free speech, that they

9

should be entitled to do so if they can't afford to pay

10
11

the fee.
QUESTION:

We are not talking about free

12

speech --we are talking about only parades, right?

13

they have to do a parade?

14

street and deliver their message?

15

MR. STUBBS:

Do

Can't they stand out on the

Yes, but if it is our street, we

16

would assume that they come under our ordinance and would

17

have to apply for a permit and would ordinarily be charged

18

a fee, but we are providing an indigency waiver if they

19

cannot afford that if they are individuals, whether we

20

have to or not, we thought we did.

21

QUESTION:

That is what we are here to inquire,

22

I thought that was your submission to Justice O'Connor,

23

that a indigency waiver is required, but it seems to me

24

that is a very important part of this case.

25

MR. STUBBS:

Justice Kennedy, the Eleventh

1

Circuit didn't reach that issue and it wasn't briefed in

2

any great detail, and I would assume that whatever happens

3

to this case, the possibility exists that the Eleventh

4

Circuit may get to deal with the indigency provision

5

again.
As I have said, argument in the district court

6

7

and in the court of appeals and probably here today

8

indicates how cumbersome and burdensome our indigency

9

provision is.

10

really have not attempted to make it more workable.
QUESTION:

11
12

But until this litigation is ended, we

Is there some claim by the

respondents here that they were indigent?'

13

MR. STUBBS:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STUBBS:

Yes.
How did the lower courts treat that?
The Eleventh Circuit didn't reach

16

it.

17

indigency claim based on an analogy to Title 28, U.S. Code

18

1915, where the Federal courts don't allow corporations to

19

proceed in forma pauperis.

20
21

The district court ruled that they had no right to an

QUESTION:

necessary affidavit specified in the ordinance?

22

MR. STUBBS:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. STUBBS:

25

Did the respondent fill out the

Yes, sir.
Did they then get a permit or - They were issued a permit

contingent on payment of a $100 fee and they would not pay

1

so they did not march, and this is how the case got here.
QUESTION:

2

3

Mr. Stubbs, the county administrator

in this case just considered costs of administration of
»

4

the permit application?

5

MR. STUBBS:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, ma'am.
Why did the administrator not

7

consider the cost of police required for the march, do you

8

suppose?

9

MR. STUBBS:

Justice O'Connor, in 1985 the

10

Eleventh Circuit came down with a decision which basically

11

said that they read -- it didn't have anything to do with

12

Murdock, they just said that you could not charge a fee

13

for police activities.

14

We were faced with --

15

QUESTION:

16

police.

17

MR. STUBBS:

18

QUESTION:

19

Your ordinance refers to the cost of

That's correct.
But in deference to the Eleventh

Circuit's rulings in some other case --

20

MR. STUBBS:

We did not exercise that option.

21

QUESTION:

I see.

22

QUESTION:

But I take it the principle upon

23

which you rest here would not limit your right in the

24

manner in which the Eleventh Circuit did.

25

the principle that you espouse here would authorize you to

In other words,

1

charge for the cost of police, subject to an indigency-

2

exception.

3

MR. STUBBS:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So that in your view, you could have

5

had an ordinance that would have allowed you to charge

6

$700,000 for the civil rights demonstrations or parades in

7

the earlier instances?

8

MR. STUBBS:

9

QUESTION:

10

Our ordinance puts a cap -I know yours does, but your principle

would allow you to do that, is that correct?
MR. STUBBS:

11

Our principle would, Justice

12

Souter.

13

Hampshire in 1941, their ordinance had a cap and we felt

14

that therefore, we ought to have a cap --

15

What we were concerned about is' that in New

QUESTION:

Well, no, I realize that, but I just

16

want to understand what the rule is that you are

17

ultimately relying on, subject to the cap.

18

you have a problem if you, in effect, are allowed

19

literally or would be allowed literally to adjust the fee

20

in accordance with the difficulty of policing the

21

demonstration because you would thereby have a

22

relationship between the likely controversial nature of

23

the message or of the point being made by the parade or

24

demonstration which would in effect make it content-based

25

or viewpoint-based?

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

Do you think

MR. STUBBS:

1

That is one of the reasons why we

2

thought the cap in New Hampshire, and our cap, is probably

3

necessary.

4

QUESTION:

But can you get out of it that way,

5

because as I understand it, at least within your $1,000

6

limit, you would still be adjusting or you would still be

7

setting your fee within the $1,000 limit depending upon

8

the likely cost, and that would bear a relationship, I

9

suppose, to the controversial nature of what was being

10

demonstrated for.
MR. STUBBS:

11

Well, we have a balancing of

12

interests here, obviously.

13

which indicate that sometimes there is an incidental

14

effect upon First Amendment freedoms when fees are charged

15

or time, place or manner restrictions are put on

16

demonstrators.

17

QUESTION:

18

manner restriction --

19

MR. STUBBS:

20

21

There are cases of this Court

But this isn't a time, place or

We believe it is, Justice Souter,

because - QUESTION:

How is it a time, place or manner

22

restriction if it is varying depending on -- or varying in

23

relationship to the content of the message?

24

MR. STUBBS:

25

QUESTION:

Well, first of all -I mean, by definition, you know, what

1

is allowed under time, place ahd manner starts with the

2

assumption that you don't have that kind of a

3

content-based determination.

4

MR. STUBBS:

Well, it's not -- the content

5

doesn't affect how the ordinance is administered.

6

affects costs for policing, that is the only way the

7

content affects anything.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. STUBBS:
QUESTION:

10

It

What's the difference?
Well, I think
I mean, if you are going to -- if you

11

are say that your principle allows you to charge in

12

relation to the cost of policing, you are' saying the same

13

thing.

14

MR. STUBBS:

Well, Justice Souter, the only way

15

I can answer that question is to say that in Cox v. New

16

Hampshire we used the same language that they did there.

17

That was a time, place and manner case.

18

where you have a licensing or regulation scheme, that is

19

what time, place or manner is, you have a permit required

20

so that somebody knows that somebody is coming to

21

demonstrate and they can do what needs to be done to

22

adequately police and take care and prepare for whatever

23

the demonstration is.

24
25

We feel that

And that whole scheme takes money, and we
believe that is what was recognized in Cox -15

QUESTION:

1

But basically, you are resting on

2

Cox?

3

present First Amendment analysis, you do not, as I

4

understand it, have an argument that nonetheless, your

5

scheme should survive?
MR. STUBBS:

6

7

We have a problem if Cox is no

longer viable.
QUESTION:

8

9

I mean, if we think Cox is no longer consonant with

Mr. Stubbs, am I correct that you not

only did not charge for the police protection which you

10

were authorized to charge for, but you didn't even charge

11

the full amount of the administrative costs?

12

MR. STUBBS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. STUBBS:

That's correct, Your Honor.
You reduced what it might have been.
The administrator made a

15

determination that he wanted to charge what had been

16

charged the year before so that there would be no

17

QUESTION:

That is very generous of him.

I

18

mean, can he pick which organizations he decides to be

19

generous with?

20

this were a Communist Party demonstration or some other

21

group?

22

I mean, would he have been as generous if

What kind of an ordinance is that, anyway?
MR. STUBBS:

I think the generosity was an

23

attempt to avoid what has happened, to coming up here, and

24

not out of agreement with the message by any means.

25

QUESTION:

Well, how do we know that?

I should

1

think you have to charge all groups on some fixed basis

2

and not -- you make the point in your brief as though it

3

is a point in your favor that you didn't charge the full

4

amount that could have been charged.

point in your favor.

6

about with this ordinance, that it allows people to scale

the fees as they wish.

9

It is one of the things I worry

MR. STUBBS:

8

Mr. Stubbs, let's assume that you

generosity, or we won't call it generosity, the reduction

was subject to some principle, so that it wouldn't be a

22

danger of its varying depending on the sympathy or lack of

then encounter a different problem, that what you are

2

charging really doesn't bear any relationship at all

3

between, or to, rather, the expense that you are trying to

4

offset?

5

I mean, if you charged $100 or even your $1,000

6

in the case of the $700,000 parade, I mean, there just

7

wouldn't be any significant relationship between what you

8

were doing and the object which supposedly justifies what

9

you are doing, i.e., offsetting costs.

10

MR. STUBBS:

Justice Souter, we addressed that

11

in our brief by citing this Court's language in

12

Massachusetts v. United States where the 'Court recognized,

13

and I think that was a supremacy clause case, that the

14

costs the FAA was charging States and anybody else using

15

their facilities was negligible in relation to the entire

16

costs, but the Court indicated that they could

17

nevertheless be considered, because Congress considered it

18

that way, as an integral and essential part of the network

19

of user fees that the Congress had set up.

20
21

22

23
24
25

And we feel that the same thing is being
accomplished here.

It may be negligible --

QUESTION:

Is that going to pass First Amendment

muster today?
MR. STUBBS:

Well, Massachusetts v. United

States is not that old of a case, Your Honor.

I think

1

that is '78 or thereabouts, and I don't think we have

2

moved that far in the last 14 years, but, in other words,

3

what I am saying is any impact to offset our costs is a

4

laudable gesture, I think, on the part of local government

5

or any government.

6

And whether or not it bears an actual

7

relationship should not be fatal to what we are asking to

8

be allowed to do.

9

We would reemphasize the fact that, as local

10

government is wont to do, we have to try, the best we can,

11

to word these ordinances in view of the First Amendment

12

considerations, and that is why we utiliz'e the language

13

from Cox, figuring that if we could not utilize this

14

Court's language, there is not much way of doing what we

15

wanted to do legally.

16

We don't believe that the distinction we are

17

making between utilizing a user fee concept as opposed to

18

a general taxation is something that should cause any

19

problem either.

20

government has the ability to decide whether they want to

21

raise revenues by taxing their respective citizens or

22

assessing fees against those who come in and want to use

23

their facilities, especially when you have a situation

24

where most of the people who may be utilizing whatever

25

facilities are available are not tax-paying citizens.

2

veto which I am sure concerns the Court to some extent,

3

that we have been as content-neutral as possible.

The concern that the respondent, The Nationalist

11

Movement, raises concerning the impact of any kind of fee

12

on the ability of anyone to express themsfelves on

13

important issues in the public, we believe is misplaced.

14

There are many examples of burdens on resources of those

15

wishing to spread their message.

16

You don't have free access to radio.

The air is

17

free, but the frequencies are auctioned off and controlled

18

and people pay for those, and then when you want to buy

19

time, you have to do that, you have to buy time.

20

Taken to its logical extreme, if The Nationalist

21

Movement's founder wanted to travel from Mississippi to

22

Georgia for the one and only purpose of spreading his

23

message in Forsyth County, the sales taxes on his airplane

24

ticket or the gas taxes on his automobile would be an

25

impact on his ability to spread his message, but it is

It entails the same sort of expenses

MR. BARRETT:

Well, Your Honor, perhaps the

expense is the right of the poor to assemble in public,
and I submit that the expense is cutting off the right of
the poor; also under Terminello in 1949 which is the

would be if the demonstrator says - QUESTION:

Perhaps I can tell you how in

Forsyth County when demonstrators threatened, and also in
Atlanta which is cited somewhat in the appendix, when
demonstrators said they were going to come and throw rocks
and throw bricks, then the police had to respond to that
emergency and then under the county's argument, the
would-be assemblers or paraders as the case may be, are
then to be charged for the cost of defending against the
hecklers?
I submit Your Honor that that simply is a
heckler's veto.

QUESTION:

But all I am saying, if I understand

your argument correctly, you would make the same argument

even if there were no other fees at all?

MR. BARRETT:

Yes, we would, Your Honor.

And

Can I speak of

Can I

May I

1

speak of freedom?

They have spoken of convenience.

May I

speak of happiness?

3

Your Honor, write this epitaph, if you will, on my tomb:

4

The road not taken, but not the speech not given.

Someone asked if I would pay a fee.

5

I have been asked if it applies to the rich --

QUESTION:

MR. BARRETT:

9

Honor, faith comes from hearing.

10

How about the argument not made?

Perhaps.

As the Bible says, Your
And as Martin Luther

said, here I stand, I can do nothing else.
To the weight of the coin, if you will, of King

11

12

13

coffers -- the ones who, by the way, the record will show,

14

could march, perhaps could afford the fee, there must be

15

the fulcrum to that weight, and that is the First

16

Amendment.

3

music fan, but I am prepared to let Mick Jagger play so

5

traditional public forum, yes, Your Honor.
If I were speaking about law that is laid low in

6

7

a cold coffin, Your Honor, then I would speak of the past

8

and the glories of the law that were.

9

today, Your Honor, because I regard the law as youthful

But I came here

10

and zealous, and therefore, may I give you my simple

11

invocation to glories of the law yet to come, and it is
