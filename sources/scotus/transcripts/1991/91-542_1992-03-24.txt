CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

5

Mr. Curry, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD R. CURRY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CURRY:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
What this case is all about is whether this

10
11

Court meant what it said in Teague v. Lane and its progeny

12

about having confidence in the state courts to faithfully

13

follow the Constitution and about Federal habeas courts

14

deferring to reasonable good faith state court judgments.

15

West and his amici complain that we are trying to take the

16

Federal courts out of the formula by which habeas corpus

17

cases are decided.

18

truth.

19

Nothing could be farther from the

We are not asking for a rule of preclusion.

All

20

we are asking is that the Court make explicitly clear that

21

the state courts are an important part of that calculus

22

too, and that Federal habeas courts are not free to decide

23

the cases of state prisoners as if the state court

24

decision had never even occurred.

25

Congress has expressly required that a state prisoner

In a system where

1

first take his constitutional claims to state court before

2

bringing them to Federal court, it makes absolutely no

3

sense to then turn around on Federal habeas corpus and

4

completely disregard the state court decision.

5

The problem that exists is that Federal

6

collateral relief, with all of the systemic costs that

7

this Court has identified, is still being granted not

8

because the state court decision was indefensible, not

9

because it was objectively unreasonable under existing

10

precedent, but simply because a Federal habeas court

11

thinks in its opinion that its decision is right and that

12

the decisions of all the state courts that went before

13

were wrong.

14

QUESTION:

Then why don't you simply argue that

15

this is a misapplication or a failure to apply Teague by

16

in effect applying a new rule or a new and more specific

17

application of the, of, as it were, of Jackson, of any

18

rule attacking the unexplained possession theory, that it

19

arose after the date of conviction and therefore it

20

shouldn't be applied under Teague?

21

into a separate category of mixed law and fact?

22

MR. CURRY:

Why do we have to get

Of course, Justice Souter, that's

23

exactly what we are arguing, and that's exactly the

24

question that we raised in the court below.

25

QUESTION:

But you don't really need, then, a

1

separate, or a specific rule for mixed questions.

All you

2

need is a, in effect a clear statement, or a clearer

3

statement perhaps, of when Teague applies and when it

4

doesn't.

•

MR. CURRY:

5

Well, it's certainly true, Justice

6

Souter, that we should win under a correct application of

7

Teague.

8

juncture in view of the Court's question that it asked

9

when certiorari was granted is whether Teague in effect

But the point of this case as we see it at this

10

has taken the Jackson standard, which is a very

11

deferential standard, and in effect applied it across the

12

board and made it the standard of review.
QUESTION:

13

Well, suppose the court had not

14

instructed the jury with reference to the inference, and

15

it just submitted the case to the jury, and we later find

16

out from say closing argument of counsel or by examining

17

the jurors after the verdict that the jurors did indeed

18

rely on this inference as a common sense inference.

19

the petitioner then ask the Federal court for review based

20

on the theory that the evidence was insufficient?
MR. CURRY:

21

Certainly.

And I think it is, the

22

common law inference is just a recognition of what is

23

common sense.

24
25

QUESTION:
this case?

Could

1

would, in your view, have the right to exercise its

2

jurisdiction to determine sufficiency of the evidence?

3

MR. CURRY:

Justice Kennedy, we have never, we

4

have never contended that sufficiency of the evidence

5

claims are not reviewable in habeas corpus.

6

QUESTION:

So it's just the presence of the

7

inference in this case that makes Federal, the exercise of

8

Federal jurisdiction inappropriate?

9

MR.. CURRY:

No, we're not, we're not challenging

10

whether the Federal habeas court had jurisdiction.

11

contended below that we should win under a straight out

12

application of Jackson, and we should win under a straight

13

out application of Jackson.

14

QUESTION:

We

We are contending that --

Let's strike the word jurisdiction.

15

Whether or not it's appropriate for the Federal Court to

16

exercise its authority.

17

it is inappropriate?

18

MR. CURRY:

If Teague applies, then I take it

Well, it is appropriate under Teague

19

and Jackson to the extent that the Federal court looks at

20

whether the decision reached by the decision-maker is one

21

that a reasonable decision-maker could have made.

22

that is the inquiry under Jackson.

23

under Teague.

24
25

QUESTION:

And

It is also the inquiry

Well, isn't that a little bit of an

elision of some of the factors in Teague, that the only

1

question is was the state court decision reasonable.

If

2

it's simply an application of existing constitutional law

3

to the facts of a case, it isn't enough that the state

4

court decision be reasonable.

5

correct, doesn't it?

6

MR. CURRY:

It really has to be

I don't think that's what Teague

7

means.

And I think what the Court just said a few weeks

8

ago in Stringer makes that point.

9

Stringer that the Teague doctrine, the interest of

The Court said in

10

federalism underlying that doctrine, are equally

11

undermined when you apply a new rule, in other words apply

12

an after-decided case, and it is equally undermined when

13

you take settled law and apply it in a way that is not

14

dictated by precedent.

15

contending should have been the standard in this case.

16

QUESTION:

And that's exactly what we're

But every single fact situation isn't

17

an original inquiry under the law.

18

settled principles of law that apply to different fact

19

situations.

20

I mean, there are

You would agree with that, wouldn't you?

MR. CURRY:

Well, I agree that there are

21

situations where you take a settled principle and you

22

apply it to the facts of a case, but I don't think that

23

makes any difference for purposes of the Teague inquiry.

24

After all, in Butler v. McKellar he, the petitioner in

25

that case, the prisoner in that case first said that he

was relying on the Roberson decision which was an after-

2

decided case.

3

Teague, his answer to that was all I am asking the Court

4

to do is to take Edwards v. Arizona and apply it to the

5

facts of my case, and I should win.

And when clearly he could not do that under

QUESTION:

6

There are going to be gray areas

7

where there is argument as to whether this was fore­

8

ordained by prior decisions or whether it's an expansion

9

under Teague, but you can certainly have some issues or

10

some fact situations which, although not precisely covered

11

by a prior constitutional decision, nonetheless would not

12

be regarded as a new rule, can you not?

13

MR. CURRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think the

14

answer to that question, that question would be answered

15

by applying the Teague test.

16

situation is close enough, then the result was dictated by

17

precedent.

18

then it was not dictated by precedent.

QUESTION:

Okay.

Well now take the case where

the fact situation was close enough to be dictated by

prior precedent.

1

court, although perhaps the Federal habeas court's view of

2

the law might not correspond to that of some other court.

3

MR. CURRY:

4

differently, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

when you, if you say that the result was not dictated by

6

precedent, then by definition under the Teague standard

7

the result that the state court reached was not reasonable

8

under existing precedent.
QUESTION:

9

Well maybe, I see it a little bit
The way I see it is that

Do I take it that the conclusion of

10

your colloquy with the Chief Justice is that the Teague

11

issue here is analyzed substantially the same way whether

12

or not the jury was instructed with reference to the

13

inference?

14

MR. CURRY:

15

QUESTION:

That's right.

That's right.

And by the same, just to nail it

16

down, I think you are also saying that even if we conclude

17

that Jackson v. Virginia was correctly applied, you still

18

win under Teague?

19

MR. CURRY:

Well, we should win under Teague,

20

but I don't really see that there is a difference between

21

the Jackson standard and the Teague standard.

22

it's impossible that a Federal habeas court --

going to rest on that?

1

that.

I think if a Federal habeas court decided the case

2

under Jackson and found that no rational jury could have

3

reached this conclusion, it is simply impossible to say

4

that the same Federal court would look at it under Teague

5

and say well, even though the jury acted irrationally I

6

have to find that a reasonable state court could have

7

affirmed that irrational verdict.
Our point is that they are both very deferential

8

standards.

I think it is completely a mistake to look at

10

Jackson as a de novo standard.

11

made clear by the Court in Lewis v. Jeffers.
QUESTION:

12

13

I think that point was

Well, the court of appeals here

purported to be applying Jackson and asking the question

•

14

could a rational jury have decided it this way.

15

MR. CURRY:

That's right, but, that's part of

16

our point.

In view of Teague -- Jackson itself talks

17

about the state appellate court's decision.

18

than three places in Jackson it talks about the state

court appellate decision and says at one point of course

20

it's entitled to deference.

jury could have convicted.
MR. CURRY:

2

Well, Justice White, as I said

3

before, we have always contended that we should win under

4

Jackson.

5

certiorari on the Teague issue because we think the point

6

of Teague is that it basically takes a standard very much

7

like Jackson and applies it across the board.

8

Court asked the question that asked about it in terms of

9

the standard of review, and we think that Teague provides

10
11
12

13

We contend that today.

But we petitioned for

And the

that standard of review.
QUESTION:

If Teague had been -- excuse me,

Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

The fact that the Court asked a

14

question does not mean that your own questions, of course,

15

are superceded.

16

MR. CURRY:

17

QUESTION:

No.

Certainly not.

If Teague had been on the books would

18

Jackson, should Jackson have been analyzed differently and

19

decided differently?

20

MR. CURRY:

Yes, I think it would have to be

21

analyzed differently in terms of Teague, because Jackson,

22

although it talks about the state appellate court's

23

decision and it has to be given deference, it doesn't

24

articulate what that deference is, and it talks more in

25

terms of the Federal court looking directly at the jury's

QUESTION:

So you're asking us to cut back on

MR. CURRY:

Well, I think it's really more a

5

question of modifying the way that it has been applied.

6

It is commonly applied as if the state court decision had

7

never even occurred, when Jackson itself says that the

8

state court appellate decision is entitled to deference.

10

QUESTION:

I thought we were, in Teague, just

talking about questions of law.

QUESTION:

17
18

Well --

Yes or no?
Yes.
Well, and now you want to expand it

to cover application of law to facts.
MR. CURRY:

Well, that is certainly my answer to

19

the question, but I think --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CURRY:

Well, isn't it?
I think the Court itself has

22

expanded Teague, because when you say in Teague that a

23

prisoner cannot take advantage of a case that was decided

24

after his case became final, state prisoners immediately

25

come to the Federal court and say I don't want the benefit

1

of that case.

I want the benefit of this preexisting case

2

applied to the facts of iuy case.

3

that the Court has been confronted with from Butler v.

4

McKellar on.

That is the situation

And the Court has answered that question not by

5
6

saying well, since you*'re not asking for the benefit of an

7

after-decided case, fine, we'll just go ahead with de novo

8

review.

What the Court has said is let's look at the

preexisting case and see if it dictates the result that
10

you want.

11

is was the result one that a reasonable court could have

12

reached under existing precedent.

13

And the way you define whether it is dictated

The fundamental underlying premise of the view

14

that insists upon de novo review in Federal collateral

15

proceedings is basically a distrust of state courts.

16

other words these matters are just too important and we

17

cannot trust state court judges to faithfully follow the

18

Constitution and to apply constitutional principles to the

1

facts of a given case.

20

unequivocally reject.

21

that this Court has repeatedly and emphatically rejected.

22

In

That is a premise that we
More importantly, it is a premise

And while the Court knows, just like I know,

23

that state courts don't blindly follow every time a lower

24

Federal court finds or announces a Constitutional

25

principle, the Court also knows that the state courts do

1

pay close attention when this Court speaks, and that they

2

do their level best to faithfully follow the Constitution

3

and to apply constitutional principles as this Court

4

directs them to do.

5

And what this case all boils down to is how much

6

does this Court trust the state courts, and whether this

7

Court has meant it in the past when it has said that it

8

does have that confidence in the state courts.

At this point if there are no further questions

I would like to yield to the Solicitor General and save my

remaining time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

15

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

16

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

17

MS. MAHONEY:

18
19

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The United States takes the position that Teague

20

does not itself mandate an application of a deferential

21

standard of review to mixed questions of law and fact,

22

that instead it and its progeny seem to suggest that

23

settled questions of law can be applied to the facts, and

24

it has not yet changed the standard of review that would

25

govern those determinations by the state courts.

(800) FOR DEPO

1

What we afek this Court to do, however, is to

2

reevaluate whether that standard of review in fact

3

conforms to the purposes of the writ, because for the last

4

16 years in a series of decisions starting with Wainwright

5

v. Sykes, Francis v. Henderson, and all the way through

6

Coleman v. Thompson, what this Court has said is that when

7

looking at rules governing the scope of the writ we need

8

to weigh the costs in terms of finality and comity against

9

the benefits.

And those benefits are generally viewed in

10

terms of whether they are necessary, whether the rule is

11

necessary to advance the fundamental deterrent and

12

remedial purposes of the writ.

13

We submit that, for the same kinds of reasons

14

that led the Court in Teague and Butler to change the

15

standard of review in effect that is applicable to state

16

determinations of questions of law, this Court should also

17

now find that it is appropriate to use a deferential

18

standard of review for mixed questions of fact and law.

deferential, and the underlying --

QUESTION:

It certainly isn't de novo, is it?

4

MS. MAHONEY:

No, it is not.

standard of due process viewing the jury verdict we think

is absolutely right, whether any rational jury could find

guilt.
QUESTION:

11

standard?

Well, what's wrong with that

Why shouldn't a habeas court see, ask that

question that Jackson asks?
MS. MAHONEY:

I think instead the habeas court

12

should ask whether the state court's rejection of the

13

Jackson claim was reasonable, because as this Court found,

14

as the lower court found -- excuse me?

15

QUESTION:

If it rejects, it rejects -- what's

16

wrong with, what's the difference between the question

17

that Jackson wants asked and what you say is proper?

18

MS. MAHONEY:

There is not a great difference,

19

but the real difference is that for Jackson, Jackson says

20

that the Federal habeas court should look to what a

21

reasonable juror would have done.

22

Federal habeas court should look to whether the state

23

judge's determination of the question was reasonable or

24

unreasonable, and that that standard should be applied for

25

all determinations --

I think it has become clear from the argument

question as to whether the fundamental review standard for

2

the habeas court is independent of state court judgments,

3

I would submit that that is one area where the Court has

been careful not to disturb.
There are threshold questions of whether or not

you are allowed to bring the writ, whether you are

entitled to relief, whether you have defaulted the issue,

8

whether you have abused the writ, and things like that,
but as the questions became clear.the review that the

10

Federal habeas court conducts is independent review, and

11

the understanding is that that was required by Congress.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

standard which was Thompson v. Louisville --

must accept the state court determination because it's

QUESTION:

14

QUESTION:

Let me ask you what I might call a

15

retail rather than a wholesale question, Mr. Goldblatt,

16

about the opinion of the Fourth Circuit here.

17

said it was not holding the common law presumption of

18

guilt from recent possession unconstitutional, and yet

19

under the common law presumption it is, a jury is charged

20

that it may without any additional evidence find a

21

defendant guilty on the base of the presumption, yet the

22

court of appeals sets aside -- it seems to me there is an

23

inconsistency in what they're saying there.

24

sometime during your argument you will address yourself to

25

that.

That is, it

I hope

MR. GOLDBLATT:

1

Let me address it now, because I

2

think the answer to that is that, partially in the answer

3

that my opponent gave to Justice Kennedy's question, I

4

don't think the instruction is relevant here.

5

it's a red herring in many ways.

6

that if no instruction was given at all the sufficiency

7

issue would be there, that's the issue we have always

8

raised.

I think

And when they indicated

My understanding of this Court's decision in

9
10

United States v. Gainey, the Court recognized there that

11

even if you have an instruction that tells the jury that a

12

certain quantum evidence is legally sufficient, that

13

doesn't alter the power of the Court to rule on a motion

14

JNOV or even to reverse on appeal on the basis that the

15

evidence was not adequate to let the jury decide the case

16

that way.

17

I think there are two different questions.

I

18

think if no instruction had been given here at all and the

19

jury had returned a verdict of guilty, they would be

20

arguing that there is an inference to be drawn from the

21

fact that he was in possession of these goods and that

22

that was enough to convict this person beyond a reasonable

23

doubt, and we would be arguing the same things we have

been arguing all along.

1

And I think the answer to that partially, and

2

again to avoid the problem of announcing a new rule here,

3

my authority for that is Ulster County Court v. Allen,
*

4

which was decided I believe 2 weeks before Jackson v.

5

Virginia, that recognized that the instruction, an

6

instruction like this may be given under a more likely

7

than not standard.

8

9

QUESTION:

Yeah, but that was just an

instruction as to the finding of one fact in the case,

10

wasn't it, not an instruction as to the finding of guilt

11

or innocence?

12

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I believe that was a finding

13

that you could infer knowledge of possession of the gun

14

from anyone who was an occupant of the car.

15

the same type of permissive inference that was used here.

16

I don't think there is any real distinction to be drawn.

17

Or the same with the Gainey inference, which was anybody

18

who was in the, at a still was presumed or inferred under

the policy that is used now to be part of that operation

was guilty.

the understanding of our case because this is not a case

22

that challenges the inference directly.

23

I think it's

And I really think that that is critical to

there are two inferences that arise, they were both

that the person who has possession of those stolen goods

knew them to be stolen when they gained possession of

One is that the possessor

them.
The difference between the two is, in the

12

complaint that we have here is not only did Virginia ask

13

the jury to draw from his possession the fact that he came

14

by the goods unlawfully, but that he at least 2 weeks

15

earlier was at a certain place at a certain time and took

16

them in a certain way.

17

inference, since they could reasonably show that the theft

18

took place at the same time as the burglary, to convict of

19

burglary or robbery or what have you.

20

QUESTION:

In Virginia they would use this

Well, it does sound to me like you're

21

attacking the validity of the inference, and that issue is

22

procedurally barred.

23

MR. GOLDBLATT:

No, I would submit that where we

24

are attacking is the sufficiency of the evidence that

gives rise to whatever inferences may exist in this case,

whether they exist in common law or not.

We're saying

that whatever inference there is in this case that he is

the thief is not adequate to prove the elements of the

crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
And we would be making that argument if no

It is essentially the

11

12

again in Ulster County Court the Court had recognized the

inference and the giving of the instruction and the

I mean,

How are we

supposed to decide how general you have to get to be
before Teague applies?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Well, I think there are levels

of abstraction that you have to deal with.

There would be

the due process standard which would be the most abstract.
I think Jackson is one step removed from that.

It was a

refinement of the Thompson v. Louisville standard.

And I

think that even if you're dealing with the mixed question
of law and fact where you're dealing with an abstract
principle, there is still room for determination of
whether or not you're applying a new rule.
QUESTION:
this case?

Why isn't this a general rule, in

Why isn't this at the Teague level of

generality?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

I don't think it's at the Teague

level of generality because there is more specificity.

I

think, as the Fourth Circuit correctly held, if you were
to say that each time a court does a Jackson v. Virginia
analysis of.the new set of facts that a new rule emerges
from that, you have overruled Jackson v. Virginia.

There

could be no sufficiency analysis.
QUESTION:

Or, more precisely, we would have

said that Teague has already overruled Jackson v.
Virginia.

Or you could say that.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That seems to me a general

Justice Scalia, I can find no

such general rule in Federal jurisprudence.

14

find is Ulster County Court v. Allen, which recognizes the

existence of common law inferences, or, and statutory

QUESTION:

Don't you, as the Chief Justice asked

you a while ago, don't you think the court came, the court

of appeals came awfully close to saying that, at least in

this case, that the evidence, that the inference was not

support the verdict?

MR. GOLDBLATT:

In this case, based on the facts

of this case and fact intensive of when he was in

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Based on its reliance on the

would submit that although there is language in there,

this broad language regarding the strength of the

the case.

This case comes down to a question of whether

taken somewhere else in Virginia establishes guilt of the

QUESTION:

1

Well, what about the, a rule being in

held unconstitutional?

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I don't believe so in light of

the - QUESTION:

6

7

Isn't that a form of rule?

But then would you say that Miranda

was not a new decision when it came down in 1 66?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

8

It certainly was a new decision.

What I'm saying here is I don't think there is a rule here
10

that the common law inference is unconstitutional.

11

There's a ruling here that the evidence presented was not

12

sufficient to convict him of the crime charged.
QUESTION:

13

But that is contrary to the common

14

law inference which says that, in that charge to the jury,

15

you may infer just from the fact of recent possession.

16

when you say in some cases you cannot infer it, those are

17

two contrary propositions.

18

MR. GOLDBLATT:

So

What I am saying, Mr. 'Chief

Justice, is I'm drawing from Gainey, that there are two

20

separate questions.

21

you have this permissive inference, you may infer from the

22

possession of these goods that the person is the thief

1

Well, you never know what the jury

2

does.

They might say well, if it weren't for this

instruction we would acquit, but we have been told that

4

this one fact alone is enough to prove beyond a reasonable

5

doubt, so that's what we're going to rely on.

6

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That may well happen, Justice

7

White.

The point I'm raising is the safeguard in that

8

situation, especially since this Court has upheld as a

9

matter of due process the giving of this type of

10

instruction not on the basis that*it proves guilt beyond a

11

reasonable doubt, but on the basis that it is more likely

12

than not.

13

sufficiency review after the case is over to insure that

14

each element of the crime has been proven beyond a

15

reasonable doubt.

That the safeguard is straightforward

16

Otherwise the standard for giving the

17

instruction in the first place would have to be the beyond

18

a reasonable doubt standard, which the court rejected

19

because there is other evidence in the case that has to be

20

evaluated.

21

obviously not a habeas case but a Federal case, recognized

MR. GOLDBLATT:

No, it doesn't.

But the due

or not is whether it is more likely than not, with the

test of whether the convicti.on was proven beyond a

reasonable doubt based on a review of the entire record

12

including the evidence giving rise to the inference and

13

anything else that was presented.

14

QUESTION:

Gainey was a Federal case where the

15

court was able to interpret the statutory presumption in

16

the way it did, but'a Federal habeas court does not have

any room to interpret a common law presumption that is

18

applied in the first instance by the state court.

19

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, but here I don't think that the common law

that whatever the state law is on the constancy of the

That is what they say at the end of the opinion.

itself challenges the ability of this inference

2

particularly to distinguish how someone came into

here.

5

Ultimately I think the two issues that are

correctly before the Court are, one, is the decision by

7

the Fourth Circuit not reasonable but is it correct

8

application of law, and two, whether or not it announced a

9

new rule by application of Jackson, which of course if it

10

did it would be Teague-barred.

Those are the questions

11

that I think that are properly before the Court.

12

We submit that this isn't a novel application of

13

Jackson v. Virginia, and that no precedent was extended by

14

virtue of the decision, and any language in the Fourth

15

MR. CURRY:

That's right.

here, of course, was that, the Fourth Circuit admitted

say that they're not attacking the instruction or the

common law inference under those circumstances, because

3

obviously if you tell the jury that they can draw the

4

inference based on these facts and then you say well, if

5

you do your verdict will be overturned, in effect you are

6

challenging the inference.

7

The second point I'd like to make is that a

8

point was raised about Virginia's standard of review and

9

npt knowing what it is.

I think that's interesting since

10

they have never said in 12 years of litigation that

11

Virginia may have applied the wrong standard.

12

the matter is that Virginia applies a more stringent

13

standard than Jackson.

14

must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.

15

This Court recognized that in the Jackson decision itself.

Is that only where the case is based

on circumstantial evidence?
MR. CURRY:

That's right, when it's based solely

on circumstantial evidence, like this one was.
And to answer a point that Justice Scalia

21

raised, this is of course a general rule case, and I think

22

a basic juxtaposition here shows this.

23

the Fourth Circuit in this case was in fact a decision of

10

it cannot be said in view of the common law inference

11

which has existed for centuries, that the result in this

12

case was dictated by precedent at the time his conviction

13

became final.

14

Finally with regard to this business of

15

congressional intent, I think the best evidence that there

16

is no congressional mandate for de novo review is this

17

Court's cases.

18

this Court has afforded state prisoners something far less

19

than de novo review, and in many instances no review at

20

all in default cases.

21

each of those line of cases the Court reached that

22

conclusion over a dissent which made the congressional

intent argument, and of course the Court necessarily

rejected that view in order to hold the way that it did.
