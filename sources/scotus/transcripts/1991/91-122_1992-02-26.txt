ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS RICHICHI

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MR. RICHICHI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The matter before you involves the deprivation

15

of a landowner's right to pursue a use of his property, a

16

use which was approved more than 15 years ago by the

17

Planning Board of Puerto Rico and upheld on the merits by

18

the Puerto Rican courts.

19

August of 1988 when senior officials of the Puerto Rican

20

Permits Authority, that is the respondent ARPE, denied PFZ

21

a construction permit and dismissed its project.

22

The deprivation occurred in

PFZ alleges that the dismissal is actionable

23

under 42 USC section 1983 and that it deprived PFZ of a

24

protected interest under the due process clause of the

25

Fourteenth Amendment and that it was a result of behavior

1

by officials acting under color of state law which was not

2

rationally leaded to a legitimate state objective.

3

The conduct which gave rise to PFZ's claim was

4

the deliberate refusal by ARPE to review and process a set

5

of construction drawings which PFZ had submitted to the

6

agency in order to obtain a construction permit.

7

accompanied by the dismissal of ARPE's project based on

8

the deliberate review of another different set of drawings

9

which ARPE knew to be the wrong drawings.

QUESTION:

What is your position with respect to

I think the Court is free to consider the

pretrial order if it deems that it in fact has amended the

12

complaint in connection with the well settled law.

13

not think you need to go that far in order to rule in our

14

favor.

QUESTION:

We do

So you are now drawing your statement

16

of facts that you make to us, then, from the pretrial

17

order as well as from the complaint?

18

MR. RICHICHI:

Well, the pretrial order --we

19

would rely on the amended complaint, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

The pretrial order does reflect the state of the record

21

when the case was dismissed, and therefore in drawing

22

reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff we believe

23

that it is context and does provide guidance as to what

24

reasonable inferences were appropriate.

MR. RICHICHI:

QUESTION:

You're stating that

The Planning Board deliberately

That's correct.

Is all of that derived simply from

6

the amended complaint, or are you relying at least in part

7

on the pretrial order?
MR. RICHICHI:

8

9

Some of the facts that we have

relied upon are reflected in the pretrial order.

They are

10

also reflected in the admissions that have been made in

11

the papers before this Court and before the court of

12

appeals, but we believe the amended complaint is

13

sufficient to state a claim.

14

QUESTION:

Well, it may be sufficient to state a

15

claim, but when you give us these statement of facts are

16

you relying on anything that can only be divined from the

17

pretrial order?

18

Well, don't --

MR. RICHICHI:

No, I don't believe so.

I

19

believe these facts are reflected in the amended complaint

20

and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.
QUESTION:

21

May I just be sure of one thing?

22

amended complaint you're referring to is at page 131 of

23

the Appendix?

right?

I do not believe the pretrial

order was made part of the Appendix by the parties.

And where is the pretrial order?

QUESTION:

So we really don't want to rely on

that, then, if we can't have it before us.
MR. RICHICHI:

Right.

PFZ had timely filed the

required drawings in February of 1982 for ARPE's

8

processing and review.

9

until 6 years later, and then only after PFZ had sued the

agency.

11

officials concluded, 6 years after the fact, that PFZ had

12

not submitted any construction drawings in 1982 and having

13

missed the deadline for submission the entire project

14

would be dismissed.

15

action cannot be construed to be rationally related to a

legitimate state purpose.

cited was in our reply brief at Note 5, page 4, and it

approved a project there is a vested right that accrues,

point out that under the current regulations and current

law, as the respondents point out in their brief, these

No, that's Justice Kennedy.
I'm sorry.

I apologize to the

Justice Kennedy, I was thinking of my answer.

The

10

due process clause is distinct from the takings clause and

11

we would submit that in this particular instance there are

12

two different potential claims.

13

asserted is the due process claim, the difference being

14

that as the Court pointed out in the first English

15

opinion, takings involves otherwise proper conduct by the

16

government which interferes with property.

17

talking about misconduct, and in that sense we do not

18

believe that the complaint that we have alleged involves a

19

takings claim.

20

under these circumstances we are talking about misconduct

21

and that implicates the due process clause.

The one that has been

1

takings context, that sometimes regulation can go too far

2

if there is an improper exercise of the police power.

3

I think the Court has also made clear that there can be an

4

improper exercise of the police power with respect to a

5

substantive due process claim, and in this particular

6

instance we believe that there was an improper exercise of

7

the police power in an adjudicatory setting and that

8

implicates the due process clause.
QUESTION:

9

But

As I recall the court of appeals'

10

opinion in this case, they did not agree with you as to

11

your submission as to the law of Puerto Rico, that that

12

law was so flat out ministerial that it would, that you

13

had a substantive right to a permit once your development

14

project had gotten to the stage it did.

15

MR. RICHICHI:

I think the - - as I recall the

16

opinion, Mr. Chief Justice, what the court of appeals said

17

was they were assuming the existence of the property

18

right, and even assuming the existence of the property

19

right under Puerto Rican law that they did not feel that

20

there was a claim that had been stated.

21

court below was concerned, both the district court and the

22

court of appeals assumed the existence of a property

23

right.

QUESTION:

So as far as the

Justice O'Connor questioned you about, do you think?

MR. RICHICHI:

1

That is -- well, I don't think

2

the court was that specific, but I have to assume that

3

that's what they're referring to when they said we assume

4

the existence of a property right.

5

QUESTION:

Well, the court of appeals actually

6

said more than that.

7

whether there's a property right or not under Puerto Rican

8

law.

9
10

It said it isn't all that clear

MR. RICHICHI:
QUESTION:

I believe that's correct.

And do you suppose that, do you

11

suppose the -- is it open in this Court?

12

open in this Court as to whether there is a property right

13

under Puerto Rican law in the construction permit, or do

14

we have to -- is the only issue before us is if there is a

15

property right, was it taken?

16

MR. RICHICHI:

Is the question

I think the only issue is the

17

latter, if there was a property right, was it taken.

18

Court has said in the State of Washington v. Roberge that

19

the right to devote one's land to a legitimate use is

20

property within the protection of the Constitution.

21

Court has more recently said in the Nollan case that the

22

right to build on one's property is not even remotely

23

something along the lines of a government benefit, that

24

there is a right to build on one's property.

25

arose in the constitutional context.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Richichi, I'm having

15

trouble seeing where you draw the line between the

16

property right that you are now describing, I think you're

17

describing, and the property right which you described in

18

answer to Justice O'Connor's question, because I

19

understood your answer to her question to be that the

20

property right you claimed, the denial of which you claim

21

was the property in the permit, you had a right to get

22

that permit and that was denied.

23

And yet as I read your allegations, principally

24

those sort of 36 through 40 in the complaint, I read them

25

as referring to an underlying or antecedent right that I

think you are talking about now the right to use one's

2

land.

3

thought you were narrowing the inquiry and saying no, the

4

right here is just the right to get the permit, having

5

fulfilled certain conditions under Puerto Rico law.

And in answer to Justice O'Connor's question I

But now it seems to me that you're arguing what

6

7

I thought your complaint argued, an underlying right to

8

use one's property, permit system or no permit system.

9

Which is it?
MR. RICHICHI:

10

It is the right that you have

11

described, the underlying right to use one's property.

12

What I was pointing out in response to Justice O'Connor's

13

inquiry was that there is also a property right under

14

Puerto Rican law.

15

underlying right to use one's land --

But the right upon which -we rely is the

17

MR. RICHICHI:

Okay.

18

has indicated that is within the protection due process

clause.

QUESTION:

And you, would you -- I think you

21

agree but I want to be sure, that your complaint does not

22

set out allegations from which on its face, if we accept

23

them, one could say that you had claimed a substantive

24

entitlement to this particular permit.

25

is they just didn't process it right.

therefore they denied me the underlying right.

2

fair characterization?

3

MR. RICHICHI:

Is that a

I think it goes to more than

4

delay, because there was a denial of the permit after a

5

legitimate use had been recognized.
QUESTION:

6

But you don't, you don't claim in

7

express terms in your complaint that you had on the merits

8

met every condition necessary to get that permit.

9

not what you're relying on.
MR. RICHICHI:

10

That's

I believe we do indicate, if the

11

Court needs to go that far we did indicate that the

12

required drawings had been submitted such that a permit

13

could issue.

14
15

So to the extent --

Then I guess you're claiming both

kinds of rights.

MR. RICHICHI:

We believe we should prevail on

17

both rights, that's correct.

has identified, be believe they are both present in this

instance.

of the land that Puerto Rico can subject us to legitimate

22

restrictions under the police power, but that police power

23

is in and of itself subject to legitimate restrictions

and that in fact is where we believe the right has arisen,

QUESTION:

May I ask this question?

MR. RICHICHI:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

To the extent that you're relying on

5

your response to Justice O'Connor, the specific right to

6

have specific drawings of the project approved, why isn't

7

a state law remedy an adequate protection for that?

8

do you have to come into Federal court to get that right

9

protected?
MR. RICHICHI:

10

Why

Well, in response to that

11

question we believe that this Court has indicated under

12

Zinermon that the Federal remedy is supplementary so that

13

we are not required in the substantive due process context

14

to first make use of state remedies, and we would submit

15

that that is the appropriate rule.

didn't you?

And you were turned down.
We sought reconsideration before

drawings and affirm its opinion.

Rican law to Puerto Rico to set aside this area for some

kind of wildlife preserve or something of the sort?

MR. RICHICHI:

Puerto Rico certainly could have

21

enacted legislation to do that.

The governor is empowered

22

under certain circumstances to exercise his emergency

23

powers if he thinks there is a danger to the public.

24

in this particular instance the legislature neither acted

nor did the governor exercise his emergency powers.

his equal protection rights.

So I don't think there is

2

anything in the amended complaint that would lead us to

3

believe that he is arguing anything other than he has a

4

right to a construction permit.

5

he has not cited to any statute or any regulation or any

6

provision in Puerto Rico law to demonstrate, that is he

7

has not pressed the argument that because he did as the

statute provided he was anywhere near the moment where he

could get a permit.

QUESTION:

And our position is that

Well, Ms. Ramirez, I asked this

11

question and was referred, I believe, to Note 5 on page 4

12

of the reply brief and the citation to certain laws and

13

regulations in Puerto Rico that the petitioner says make

14

clear that ARPE, if that's what we're calling it, lacked

15

any discretion other than to determine whether the

16

construction drawings had been assembled and submitted,

17

and that they were required by Puerto Rican law to grant

18

the permit.

19

MS. RAMIREZ:

Well, it is not correct as a

20

matter of law, Your Honor.

The only -- I don't have it in

my memory what issue he was citing in the reply brief.

allegations from which we could derive the idea that the

MS. RAMIREZ:

The standard which the first

circuit was using is one that this is not enough.

Something more is needed than merely an allegation that

they have illegally departed from state law or state

18

procedures.

And I defend that standard.

QUESTION:

You defend that, but you also say

20

that you have another ground, namely that there wasn't any

21

property interest at all.

22

MS. RAMIREZ:

Oh, yes, but this is because they

assume the property interest.

Now, our view now is that as far as petitioner

is because he is trying to supply the deficiencies in the

Ms. Ramirez, this perhaps follows up

on Justice White's -- the sentence, the last sentence in

MS. RAMIREZ:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

that -- yes, we are defending the standard from the policy

of U.S. courts, but this is because they assumed the

It is correct.

May I just raise a question here?

They not only assumed the existence of a property

paragraph 38 of the amended complaint says, they assumed

15

that there were deliberate, totally unjustified delays in

Didn't they make that assumption too?

It was an arbitrary refusal to process.

it's a fair reading of the complaint to say (a) we had a
