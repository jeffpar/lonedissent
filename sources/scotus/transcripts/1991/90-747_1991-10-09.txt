ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case arises under the Freedom of

12

Information Act.

13

relates to private information and Government records,

14

this Court has twice concluded that it is unquestionably

15

appropriate to redact private names from Government

16

documents produced under the act, for private names reveal

17

nothing about how Government conducts its business.

18

Under exemption 6 of the act, which

In this case, however, the Eleventh Circuit has

19

concluded that private names in confidential State

20

Department interviews conducted in Haiti in the early

21

1980's should be disclosed.

22

The purpose of these interviews was to monitor

23

Haitian compliance with its then recent undertaking to not

24

harass or mistreat Haitians who are intercepted on the

25

ocean seas by U.S. vessels and return to Haitian ports.

After they were returned, certain interviewees

1

were randomly approached by representatives of the

3

Department of State in Haiti.

4

confidential discussions, and based upon those assurances,

5

frank disclosure of the personal treatment that each

6

interviewee received by the Haitian Government, as well as

7

intimate personal information and descriptions of domestic

8

conditions in Haiti, were obtained.

They were assured

Out of the hundreds of interviews that were

9
10

conducted, there was only one confirmed case where a

11

Haitian who had been returned by U.S. vessels had been

12

mistreated by its Government.
When respondents sought copies of these

13
14

documents under the Freedom of Information Act, the State

15

Department made them available.

16

the practice approved by this Court in Rose and Reporters

17

Committee, redacted the private names from the documents.

18

The names of the Government officers who conducted the

19

interviews are revealed on the documents and were not

20

redacted.

But in accordance with

The court of appeals applied a generalized

balancing test that compared the public interest in

disclosure with the private interest in privacy.

balancing test?
MR. JONES:

There are applications for the

3

balancing test that we still of course recognize.

4

think that there is nonetheless a workable rule that

5

Congress adopted under exemption 6 that doesn't require an

6

ad hoc balancing in each case.

7

though, the Senate and House reports under exemption 6

8

made clear that Congress didn't intend that the choice

9

would simply be between full disclosure and nondisclosure.

10

The Senate report specifically says that what was intended

11

was what was described as responsible disclosure.

12

report gives specific content to that term.

13

We

The legislative history,

5

It allows redaction to

7

individualized identifying information should not be

8

disclosed but underlying facts and compilations of

9

statistical information should be.

We submit this is the

10

workable rule that Congress intended under the statute.

11

Now, Your Honor, I - - in describing this as a

12

workable rule, it may be simply a quibble, but I do want

13

to suggest that I see a distinction in the Court's cases

14

between workable rules and what this Court has described

15

as categorical rules.

16

Court construes as being the intended result that Congress

17

had when it adopted the statute.

18

A workable rule is one that the

A categorical rule has been adopted by this

19

Court in situations where there is room for judgment left

20

in - - for the Court to make an empirical judgment about

21

whether cases will ordinarily or most frequently properly

22

be decided under the statute in one direction.

23
24
25

We think this is a workable rule that Congress
intended.

There is ample evidence of that intent.

2

as a categorical view - - rule is not a workable rule?
MR. JONES:

Well, I don't want to belabor the

3

point, but as I understand the Court's decision, for

4

example, in Reporters Committee, which of course wasn't a

5

redaction case, it was a disclosure case.

6

was whether the document should be produced.

7

wasn't this -- the workable rule that we proposed wouldn't

8

have worked.

9

The question
So there

But when the Court adopted a categorical rule in

10

Reporters Committee, it was making a prudential judgment

11

that the interests that Congress intended to protect were

12

sufficiently great in the most similar cases, so - - and

13

that the public interest in disclosure in that instance

14

was sufficiently low that as a categorical rule, all rap

15

sheets would be subject to nondisclosure.

Now that's a harder case than we have because

17

we're not talking about nondisclosure.

benefit of the country?
MR. JONES:

Yes, sir.

In fact, our

3

understanding of the workable rule that we think Congress

4

intended is also elaborated by the fact that in the House

5

report at page 6, there are only two examples given of

6

when names would be disclosed.

7

Government employees and their duty stations, and

8

Government officers voting on official orders.

9

situations, the names of the individuals directly show how

10

11

Those two examples are

In those

Government conducts its business.
By parallel reasoning, the name of a person who

12

is doing the Government's business would also show that.

13

A Government contractor, a person operating under a

14

Government grant - - these are people who are doing the

15

Government's business even though they are still private.

16

And we think that in those instances there would be a

17

public interest in disclosure of the names.

18

QUESTION:

Give me some assurance.

Do I detect

19

a shift in the Government's position between their first

20

brief and their reply brief?

21

MR. JONES:

I am not aware of what you might

22

have in mind.

Of course, in responding to specific

23

arguments, we may have highlighted different issues.

MR. JONES:

3

I'm not aware of an inconsistency,

Your Honor.

4

Respondents seem to acknowledge that there is

5

such a general rule.

They concede that Congress intended

6

that the redaction of private names would occur in what

7

they describe as the majority of cases, at page 27 of

8

their brief.
They suggest, however, that there is some

9
10

exception to the general rule of redaction that should

11

apply here.

12

normal rule, solely because they can use the names of

13

these individuals to track them down in Haiti, re-

14

interview them, and based upon those additional

15

interviews, determine or form a judgment about whether the

16

Government's initial interview reports are truthful and

17

accurate.

believe disclosure is required.

They claim that the case is outside the

Notwithstanding the

that theoretically one could go to to inquire -- to find

out if the Government's records are truthful or accurate.

13

This is a sweeping interference.

It is truly an

14

exception that would swallow the rule.

15

emphasize in that regard that the rule that we're -- that

16

we do think exists here would be swallowed by a contention

17

that in every case we can find out if it's truthful.

18

Because the purpose of the rule is not simply to reach a

19

result, but it's to reach a workable result in a manner

20

that Congress intended without ad hoc balancing in every

21

instance.

22

And I want to

This Court has noted the legislative history is

23

replete with references by Congress that they desired to

avoid ad hoc balancing and desired to conduct the FOIA

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, what is the invasion of

10

privacy here that is unwarranted, caused by the

11

disclosure?

12

that these people were interviewed by Government agents.

13

Isn't that right?

14

The disclosure would show nothing more than

MR. JONES:

No, sir, the disclosure --by

15

comparison the FOIA -- litigation generally, this is an

16

exceptionally unusual type of disclosure because it

17

involves, as you would look at the interview reports, it

18

involves details about their personal lives, their living

19

conditions, their poverty, their ambitious to leave their

20

country, their frustrations with their present living

situation.

1

This -- there -- I can't think of an analogous instance

2

that would come close to this in terms of the nature of

3

the privacy involved.

4

QUESTION:

What I was interested in finding out

5

is whether you were indeed deciding that it was a

6

substantial invasion of privacy upon the basis of

7

something that it will cause, such as a commercial

8

solicitation.

9

You're not relying on that though?

MR. JONES:

No, sir.

Well, I think that you can

10

look --as Congressman Fascell said, you look to the

11

character of the information.

12

information is inherently, demonstrably private.

13

also, and I think it's appropriate to note this, it's

14

quite politically charged.

QUESTION:

It's

What if they had asked for the names

16

of the people first?

17

they just asked, we would like the names of the people who

QUESTION:

FOIA requires disclosure of documents, not lists.

So

2

presumably they would have to ask us for documents that

3

contain such names.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. JONES:

Okay.
And our -- and I offer that as a

preface because in that context, the name then has a

QUESTION:

10

But it's up to you whether you choose

to redact the name or redact the contents, right?

I mean,

you could redact either one, I suppose.

11

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

Not at all.

No, sir, I don't --

documents and what we are interested in is the names of

result.

QUESTION:

He was interviewed

And you think that would be an

8

unwarranted invasion of privacy, to say that so-and-so was

9

interviewed by the Government?

10

MR. JONES:

Yes, particularly in this context.

11

I think it would be in most contexts if not all, but

12

particularly here where the nature of the interview was a

13

person was asked voluntarily to cooperate in confidence on

14

Haitian soil in providing information to U.S. agents about

15

Haitian governmental action, as well as domestic

16

conditions generally in Haiti.

17

Indeed, it's hard for -- it's hard to imagine a

18

person that could come before this Court with a greater

19

claim to privacy than a foreign national who cooperated

20

voluntarily and in confidence with our State Department

21

officers in providing sensitive political information as

22

well as private, personal information about the government

23

of the foreign country.

QUESTION:

Is

1

there any question in your mind about whether these are

2

similar files within the meaning of exemption 6?

3

nobody argues it, but are there any other cases in which

4

files that are not indexed or maintained by the agency, by

5

the identity of the person who is the subject of the file,

6

have been held to be similar files by this Court?

7
8

MR. JONES:

I think that passports as the -- I

mean, the similar files case was The Washington Post case.

10

I know

QUESTION:

Right, but that they asked for the

information about identified people there.
MR. JONES:

11

Okay.

Well, the general -- to

13

answer your question directly, I think Washington Post
,
i ,
makes it quite clear that these are similar files. They

14

do contain personal information that -- I've detailed it

15

at length - - that would qualify under the standard of

16

Washington Post.

17

neither the district court nor court of appeals addressed

18

it, and I don't believe it's --

12

19

It hasn't been addressed below.

QUESTION:

No - -

It isn't immediately apparent to me

20

that this fits within the definition of the statute, that

21

I just thought I should let you know that it's probably -

MR. JONES:

24

immediately apparent after reading the Washington Post

case.

QUESTION:

1

Which involved files that were

2

maintained under the names of the person named in the

3

request, which is not the case here.

4

MR. JONES:

That's correct, but the standard

5

that the Court drew on was from the House and Senate

6

reports which describe generally documents that contain

7

personal identifying information.

8

the legislative standard and certainly within the

9

Washington Post decision on that particular issue.

So we are well within

10

I do want to mention that there are two other

11

provisions of the statute that reinforce the conclusion

12

that this Court expressed in Reporters Committee that

13

private names need not be disclosed.

14

the act provides that names may be redacted from published

15

orders if the disclosure would constitute a clearly

16

unwarranted invasion of privacy.

17

redaction in that setting is identical to the standard

18

under exemption 6.

19

Section 552(a)(2) of

Thus, the standard for

The House report at page 8 explains that private

20

names are properly redacted in - - under 552(a) (2) where

21

they, quote,

23

effect on the general public, especially randomly selected

24

Haitians who were interviewed by the State Department have

25

no inherent bearing or effect on the public.

"have no bearing or effect on the general

Private names inherently have no bearing or

Section 552(a)(3) also emphasizes that the focus

1

2

of FOIA is on the interests of the general public because

3

it provides for disclosure to be made to any person.

4

the Court has interpreted that language to - - frequently

5

to conclude that the individual purposes of requesters are

6

not to be given weight in deciding whether disclosure is

7

warranted.
The original purpose of the act was to move away

8

9

Now

from the preexisting standard of APA Section 3, which had

10

provided for disclosure based upon the individual needs of

11

the requester.
QUESTION:

12

Although you do use the individual

13

needs for determining whether there's a public interest, I

14

presume.

15

MR. JONES:

I don't follow your question, but I

16
17

QUESTION:

I don't know how you can decide

18

whether the invasion of privacy is unwarranted in the

19

sense that there is no sufficient public interest in the

20

disclosure without inquiring into what use would be made

21

of the information.

inquiry requires you to advert to the usefulness of the

MR. JONES:

were correct, it wouldn't have implications for this case.

I don't believe that's correct because Congressman

2

Fascell, as we mentioned, says that under FOIA, what's

3

relevant is the character of the information.

4

Court under 552(a)(3) has often said that the particular

5

purposes, which is another way of saying the intended uses

6

of an individual requester, are not entitled to weight in

7

determining whether disclosure is warranted under the act.

QUESTION:

And this

But the character of the information

-- it's important information or unimportant information

10

on the basis of what -- you know, whether it can cause the

11

public to do something that it would not otherwise do.

12

It's information about, you know, misdoings within the

13

Government, which would lead to congressional

14

investigations or lead to correction of those misdoings.

15

I don't know how you run a public interest analysis of the

16

information without focusing on how useful is the

17

information, what can it be used for by the public.

18

MR. JONES:

Well, Justice Scalia, the stage of

19

the discussion that you're addressing isn't reached in

20

this case because this is a redaction case.

21

describing is the situation where the redaction doesn't

22

solve the problem; it doesn't provide a workable rule

23

because, as in Reporters Committee, redaction would not

24

protect privacy because they sought specific records.

25

in that situation, you do have little choice but to either

What you are

And

1

apply an ad hoc balancing or a categorical rule based upon

2

general likelihoods of the balancing of the interests.

3

We don't have that kind of disclosure problem

4

because we have a redaction case, just like Rose was, and

5

precisely of the type that Congress understood would exist

6

in which the intended result is you redact the private

7

information.

8

to do an ad hoc balancing.

You disclose everything else; you don't have

QUESTION:

9

I must say that I don't see the

10

distinction you're drawing between redaction and refusal

11

to disclose the document in its entirety.

12

there's a different test for whether you can refuse to

13

turn over the whole document than there is for refusing to

14

turn over portions of the document?

15

MR. JONES:

Yes, sir.

You are saying

As I mentioned at the

16

outset, Congress anticipated an accommodation under which

17

neither interest is abrogated or substantially

18

subordinated, that is implemented at the first stage by

19

protection of the private information, as the Court did in

20

Rose.

21

If privacy -- if there's not a possibility of a

22

mutual accommodation because of the nature of the request,

23

as when you ask for the personal - - when you ask for the

24

records about a named individual, then it's necessary to

25

go into the balancing problem that you've been describing.

information that is requested for public purposes, then

the public interest is heightened.

5

in this case which the Government uses that information,

these reports, are for -- what they have done already is

they have interdicted 22,000 Haitians on the high seas,

8

and they have used these reports specifically to send

those people back to their country.

And the specific uses

reports to create advisory opinions in every Haitian's

18

This information, he said, was old and outdated and of no

However, as

I believe here this information that we request

specifically are not promised any confidentiality

whatsoever in spite of about a 7-year effort by the United

11

Yet, in those cases, and they are both -- well,

12

one is on appeal now because the Government has asked for

a stay in the Eleventh Circuit and it was granted because

the Government argued that the issues are identical, even

own confidentiality.

only is designed to protect individual privacy, and not

5

And the Freedom of Information Act

I think it is important to point out also that

6

the only evidence in the record to show the privacy

7

interests at stake here are the declarations of three

8

State Department employees.

And the first one by a Mr.

Eaves specifically states that the release of the

requested information in this case would cause possible

embarrassment.
Would cause possible embarrassment does not meet

uses very gentle terms when referring to other regimes, do

2

they not?

3

terminology may be something that's really rather grave.

4

So possible embarrassment in State Department

MR. RAY:

Well, I think it's very important in

5

the context of the Freedom of Information Act, especially

6

because in the past, the Government has gone before

7

Congress and has unsuccessfully attempted to have Congress

8

write out the (b)(6) exemption requirement and to allow

9

the Government to only have to show that a privacy

10

interest could be infringed upon, rather than that it

11

would be or clearly would be.

12

And therefore, as this Court recognized in the Reporters

13

Committee, there is a very distinct difference between

14

Exemption 7(C) and (b)(6).

And they were unsuccessful.

15

So I think in this context you have to look

16

specifically at what the Government has proffered for

17

their argument as to why they have met the burden.

18

they haven't met it here.

19

And

It's just simply not met.

I believe the Government is trying to create a

20

new exemption that does not exist under the law.

The text

21

of the Freedom of Information Act is very clear at 552,

22

MR. RAY:

7

That there's a different

I don't believe so.

I think in each

8

case, you perform the balancing test after you determine

9

that there is a privacy interest involved.

You then look

10

to see if there's a public interest.

11

consider the two and decide which one outweighs the other,

12

no matter whether it's a hole document or part of a

document.

14

And you weigh and

However, I do know that if a part of a document

15

can be segregated -- it's nondisclosable -- then the

Government has the duty to do that and disclose the part

17

that is segregable.

18

And this Court has recognized also what the

statute says.

20

in prior decisions that unless Congress under the Freedom

this Court will not read one into the law, which the

that many, many people in those villages know who they are

5

Well, that is -- it is a prudential

consideration of the Department that to obtain cooperation

in foreign affairs, we need to be able to have reliable

assurances of confidentiality.

also is the fact that we can't protect these people, we
