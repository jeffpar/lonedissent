ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

8

9

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case involves a Bivens action that was

10
11

dismissed on the grounds that the Federal prisoner who

12

brought the action had not exhausted the Bureau of Prisons

13

grievance procedure.
Now, in seeking reversal of that ruling, we are

14
15

not contending that Bivens plaintiffs could never be

16

required to exhaust an appropriate administrative

17

procedure.

18

the existing grievance procedure that in our view make it

19

fundamentally ill-suited to being the first stage of

20

Bivens litigation by Federal prisoners.

Here, however, there are two key features of

21

First, that grievance process provides no remedy

22

whatever to a potential plaintiff seeking compensation for

23

a past constitutional injury.

24

contains a series of mandatory hurdles, beginning with a

25

15-day filing deadline, that create a very high risk of

Second, the procedure

1

inadvertent forfeiture of constitutional claims.
Now, these features of the grievance process are

2

3

not surprising in light of its origin.

4

is a process that was created to provide an informal

5

outlet for any and all inmate complaints.

6

limited to legal claims, it contains no standards that

7

have to be applied, and it creates no right to anything

8

other than a written response.

9

opportunity for a dialogue with prison administrators.
QUESTION:

10

What we have here

It's not

It's basically an

If there is an adequate

11

administrative remedy, then is there a Bivens option at

12

all?

13

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, I think there

14

could be a situation where you would have an

15

administrative remedy that would be adequate enough to

16

justify exhaustion, but not so comprehensive that you

17

would want to give it - -

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SMITH:

Have we had a situation like that?
You haven't.

But there's an

20

analogy, certainly, under the Civil Rights for

21

Institutionalized Persons Act, where Congress has mandated

22

under certain circumstances exhaustion by State prisoners

23

in 1983 actions, but still left in place the opportunity

24

to go to court thereafter.

25

process similar to what is mandated in CRIPA you could

And I think if you had a

1

have a process, for example, that offers $2,000 in damages

2

and doesn't have a lot of due process, but still has some

3

reason to exhaust it and still say people should be able

4

to go to court thereafter.

5

7

QUESTION:

Now this prisoner is no longer in

Federal prison, as I understand it.
MR. SMITH:

He was transferred to Federal prison

8

temporarily and then went back to State custody.

9

his term of imprisonment is now over.

10

anywhere at this moment, Your Honor.

11

custody last spring.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SMITH:

14

Mr. Chief Justice.

15

else in this case.

16

In fact,

He's not in prison
He left Federal

Is he seeking damages?
This case entirely involves damages,
There was never any claim for anything

Now, consider what happens when you take this

17

informal process that I described, this dialogue process,

18

and you import it into the Bivens litigation system and

19

say it has to be pursued in every case where somebody's

20

trying to get to court on a damages claim.

21

you do at that point is you say, this prisoner who is

22

trying to get compensation for his injury has to exhaust a

23

system that doesn't provide any compensation, and has

24

three tiers of review.

25

a little bit concrete about how this works in practice.

Basically what

And I think it's important to get

1

Imagine a prisoner like petitioner, who is

2

complaining about the medical care he received in prison.

3

That prisoner might convince the warden that - - the

4

initial level of the three levels of the process -- that

5

he hasn't in fact been getting very good medical care.

6

And the warden might say that in writing in response to

7

the grievance.

8

wouldn't do at that point, he wouldn't comment in any way

9

on the legal merits of any constitutional claim for

But the one - - the two things the warden

10

damages, and he certainly wouldn't provide any

11

compensation for any injury received by the prisoner.

12

So at that point you've got your grievance,

13

you've gotten some kind of a response, even a somewhat

14

favorable response, but what are you supposed to do when

15

you're still just trying to get to court on your

16

constitutional claim?

17

would have to continue exhausting because you haven't

18

received what you're seeking.

19

though you in a sense won at the initial level.

20

QUESTION:

At that point, apparently, you

You'd have to appeal even

The Government refers to the capacity

21

of the prison to give some money under the Federal Tort

22

Claims Act and says that presents the situation you have

23

described, that they do have the power to give some money.

24

Now, does the cause of action of this plaintiff

25

incorporate a Federal Tort Claims Act claim?

And is that

1

in fact available?
MR. SMITH:

2

The complaint that was filed in this

3

case, Your Honor, was limited to a Bivens action against

4

the individual medical personnel in the prison.

5

not include a Federal Tort Claims Act claim.

6

have.

7

could be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

8

would have had to exhaust the entirely separate Federal

9

Tort Claims Act administrative procedure before he could

12

13

It did

It could

The kind of claim he brought, medical malpractice,

have brought such a claim.
QUESTION:

He

And he didn't.

Did the Federal regulations

explicitly note that as an exception?
MR. SMITH:

The point I would make in response

14

to the Government's argument about how you should file a

15

grievance, because it might give you a settlement under

16

the Tort Claims Act, is you've got two different

17

procedures here; a grievance procedure that says it's not

18

for tort claims, and the procedure for tort claims, which

19

is an entirely different part of the CFR.

20

they're saying in kind of a Rube Goldberg thing, is you

21

should go over to this procedure because although it's not

22

for tort claims, we might nevertheless consider it as a

23

tort claim, and on our own initiative offer you a

24

settlement under this other authority over here that you

25

haven't pursued.

And what

And I think there are several problems with that

1

2

kind of a theory if you're going to make that the basis

3

for justifying exhaustion of the grievance procedure.

4

First of all, the petitioner had no way of knowing that he

5

had this golden opportunity to get a settlement offer for

6

damages by filing under the grievance process, which

7

expressly says it's not for tort claims and it doesn't

8

have any damages in it.

9

problem to begin with.

So there's kind of a notice

I also think basically the whole scenario is a

10
11

little bit implausible.

12

prison officials are sitting around taking these

13

grievances that come in and plucking out those that look

14

meritorious and making on their own initiative settlement

15

offers to people that haven't even made any indication

16

that they want to pursue a legal claim for damages, either

17

under the Tort Claims Act or in court, strikes me as

18

unlikely.

19

number of cases, then it certainly doesn't justify putting

20

everybody through this three-level process.

21

The idea that these Federal

And if it doesn't happen in any significant

QUESTION:

Why didn't you bring your action

under the Tort Claims Act?

win, I suppose.

MR. SMITH:

You didn't think you could

decision was certainly made by a pro se inmate at the

time, and I actually don't know the answer to that

question.

QUESTION:
Torts Claim Act?

6

MR. SMITH:

Well, there are differences between

the two in terms of the relief that's available and --

7
8

What would you think now about the

QUESTION:

Yes.

What's the standard -- what

would you have to prove to win under the Tort Claims Act?

9

MR. SMITH:

In this kind of case you would have

10

to -- in some sense the standard of proof would be less.

11

It would be more of a negligence case than the deliberate

12

indifference standard that you'd have to meet under

13

Estelle v. Gamble in a medical constitutional case under

14

Bivens.

15

QUESTION:

Well, what would the -- you think if

16

you just proved negligence in this case you could win on

17

your Tort Claims Act?

18

MR. SMITH:

If he had brought a Tort Claims

19

Act - - as I understand it, the Government has waived

20

sovereign immunity and therefore, if there was a

21

tort - - State law tort committed by these Federal

22

prison - -

23

QUESTION:

Well, why should -- if there's this

24

alternative route to go, why would we put up with a Bivens

25

action?

MR. SMITH:

1

Well that's the

that whole issue

2

was discussed at length in Carlson v. Green 11 years ago.

3

And the Court indicated in that case that there are

4

differences between the two causes of action, that Bivens

5

claims give you greater deterrence because you can sue the

6

individual wrongdoer, that they don't depend on the

7

vagaries of State law.

8

analog, and you have no claim at all under the Tort Claims

9

Act, or there are exceptions to the Tort Claims Act.

And sometimes there is no State

10

There's also no jury trial under the Tort Claims Act, and

11

there's no potential for punitive damages.

12

the four reasons - -

13

QUESTION:

So those are

That hasn't been regarded as

14

dispositive in other cases where we've had, held -- Bivens

15

claims have been preempted.

16

MR. SMITH:

More recently, Mr. Chief Justice --

17

QUESTION:

This is a suit against Federal prison

18

officials, isn't it?

MR. SMITH:

Leavenworth Prison in Kansas.

QUESTION:

Yes, they were medical officials at

So the Federal Tort Claims Act is

available?
MR. SMITH:

It's available, sure, but this is

not the route that was pursued.

1

overlapping with the Tort Claims Act, although I think

2

this one does.

3

have to do if you're going to eliminate Bivens cases is

4

make sure that you don't eliminate them in situations

5

where the Tort Claims Act - -

6

And so one of the things that one would

QUESTION:

You think the standard of deliberate

7

indifference would be close enough to intentional conduct

8

to be barred by the Tort Claims Act?

9

MR. SMITH:

Well, the - - as I read the Tort

10

Claims Act it doesn't say we bar all intentional torts, it

11

just bars specific intentional torts like assault and

12

battery and things like that.

13

there for some medical malpractice cases to meet the

14

deliberate indifference test and also still be State law

15

torts that would qualify for the Tort Claims Act.

16

probably is some overlap, bit it gets very messy trying to

17

figure out how to separate these two sets of claims and

18

make sure that they're covered by both.

19

There probably is room in

There

The other point I would make about this

20

opportunity that the petitioner allegedly had to get a

21

Tort Claims Act settlement is if that's what we're going

22

to justify exhaustion on the basis of, why don't we just

23

have exhaustion of a procedure that directly addresses the

24

issue of damages?

25

about this grievance procedure is because it's the thing

I mean, the only reason we're talking

1

that happens to by lying around in the CFR.

2

exhaustion is going to be justified on the basis that

3

somebody ought to have an opportunity to seek damages and

4

this opportunity exists, why not have a procedure that

5

says you can ask for damages administratively and get an

6

answer to your request for damages administratively rather

7

than going into this grievance process, where you don't

8

even know whether the issue of damages was considered or
not considered.

10

But if

It depends on the initiative of whatever

prison official was responding to a grievance.
QUESTION:

11

But there still may be some benefits

12

though, I suppose, by having a prompt administrative look

13

at the facts.

14

MR. SMITH:

15

QUESTION:

16

that kind of thing.
MR. SMITH:

17

I don't dispute that.
There may be some public benefit to

I don't dispute, Justice O'Connor,

18

the possibility that there are State interests served by

1

having exhaustion of an administrative remedy in this kind

20

of case.

21

no reason why we should serve those State interests

22

without at the same time having features in the procedure

23

that offer a remedy and at the same time don't interfere

24

with the legitimate interests of the prisoner.

25

The point I would make, though, is that there is

Why not -- there's no reason those couldn't be

1

served equally well in a more adequate administrative

2

process.

3

QUESTION:

Well, do we have to look on a

4

case-by-case basis at whether the remedy, the

5

administrative remedy is adequate, or do we take a more

6

global look at it?

7

MR. SMITH:

I don't think it would depend on the

8

individual case.

There is no dispute here that in the

9

grievance process there is no compensatory remedy.

So if

10

you're talking about a Bivens claim, then I think you can

11

decide that issue and say we're going to exhaust -- we're

12

going to require exhaustion in pure Bivens cases.

13

the issue is damages, there ought to be a compensatory

14

remedy of some magnitude available in the administrative

15

process.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Where

Swear a suit against State prison

officials.
MR. SMITH:

If this were a suit against State

19

prison officials, in most States there would be no

20

exhaustion, because in most States the standards of CRIPA

21

have not been met and the general rule that there's no

22

exhaustion in 1983 cases would apply.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, isn't there a Federal statute

about exhaustion?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, that's CRIPA, the Civil Rights
13

for Institutionalized Persons Act.

2

either the Attorney General or a court certify that the

3

State exhaustion - - the State grievance procedure meets

4

certain standards before they will require exhaustion.

5

And as I understand it, it's only about 10 States where

6

that has occurred in most cases.

7

QUESTION:

And it requires that

Well, what about one of those States?

8

You have to exhaust under that statute even though there

9

isn't a damages remedy.

10

MR. SMITH:

As I understand it, Your Honor,

11

that's not right.

The court, first of all, has discretion

12

about whether to require exhaustion under CRIPA.

13

Attorney General in putting out the regulations in 1980

14

indicated if it's a pure damages case and the State does

15

not provide compensation, the court shouldn't require

16

exhaustion.

And the

17

QUESTION:

At all?

18

MR. SMITH:

19

The other thing about CRIPA is you file your

At all.

20

case in court, and then it's held for 90 days.

21

don't have this other problem which I want to get to, this

22

potential forfeiture of claims by failure to file the

23

grievance very quickly before you get to court.

24

think that is in fact maybe even a more serious problem

25

with this argument for exhaustion in this case, is the

So you

And I

1

deadlines that you have to meet and the hurdles you have

2

to get over, and the risk of forfeiture of constitutional

3

claims that it creates.

4

I mean, you look at this procedure, you have to

5

file your grievance within 15 days of a constitutional

6

deprivation.

7

generous way of describing it.

8

actually say is you have to complete whatever informal

9

grievance resolution procedures the prison may have in

And in fact, I think that's an overly
What the regulations

10

place and then file your formal grievance -- all within

11

that 15-day period after the alleged constitutional

12

violation occurred.

13

At Leavenworth what that in means in practice is

14

you have to file two forms: file an informal form, get a

15

response, and then file your formal form all within 15

16

days.

17

you're seeking damages, since it doesn't provide damages,

18

you have to appeal to the regional level and you have to

19

appeal to the central office of the Bureau of Prisons.

20

The first one has a 20-day deadline, the second one has a

21

30-day deadline.

22

that could be better designed to make it likely that

23

people who aren't represented by counsel will make a foot

24

fault and forfeit their constitutional claims.

25

And then when you lose, which is inevitable if

I submit it's hard to imagine a system

15-day period, or was he given some sort of excuse or

2

extension?
MR. SMITH:

3

This petitioner went directly to

court thinking that he didn't have to exhaust because it

was a pure damages claim.

6

back and tried to exhaust.

to the second level, the regional level, and was a few

days late and was dismissed for being untimely at the

QUESTION:

We were talking about the first suit.
Yeah.

It was dismissed for failure

to exhaust.

because it's a damages case, exhaustion shouldn't be

required, as several circuits have held.

1

if injunctive relief were sought?
MR. SMITH:

2

I think that the consensus in the

3

lower courts is that in an injunctive case you do have to

4

exhaust because there's clearly a remedy.

5

doing whatever they're doing.

6

also a much less serious problem in the case involving

2

from the grievance process and kind of split his claim

that way.

4

to handle that, frankly, is to have a grievance process

5

that has some compensation in it and make everybody with

every kind of complaint exhaust it.

7

And it does get messy.

QUESTION:

What about a mixed -- I'm still not quite clear.

should a judge do with a mixed complaint in which damages

are sought and there's been no exhaustion?
MR. SMITH:

I guess my view, Justice Stevens,

12

would be that the court ought to hold on to the damages

element of the case and tell them to go exhaust on the

14

prospective relief and come back and then litigate the

15

case at that stage so that there's no waste of judicial

16

resources at the same time that the case is held at the

17

district court level.

18

Now, this kind of maze that you have to go

19

through, it seems to me, is the kind of thing that this

20

court would never tolerate in any other context.

21

would point out that one thing that it does is it creates

severe discrimination against Federal constitutional

MR. SMITH:

That may be.

The fact

I guess -- the Federal

Tort Claims Act can be viewed as a Federal remedy or as a

17

waiver of sovereign immunity on State claims.

18

in some sense it is a Federal remedy, certainly because it

creates a different defendant, the United States, rather

than the individual tort feasor.

MR. SMITH:

Well, what the statute says -Is that possible?
What the statute says is that you

have 2 years to file your administrative claim with the

agency that administers your -- that involves the torts.

7

So I think it would be difficult for this Court to require

8

some prior administrative filing under the Federal Tort

9

Claims Act because the statute is quite clear that you

10

have that 2-year period for your initial administrative

11

filing.
QUESTION:

12

Can you give us some examples of

13

Bivens claims that would not have a counterpart under the

Federal Tort Claims Act?
MR. SMITH:

15

Sure.

There are, for example,

that this maze of hurdles that you have to go through is

But I think if they

authority for such a properly drawn regulation?
MR. SMITH:

Certainly there would be no problem

11

with them creating a procedure that doesn't have a 15-day

12

deadline and three levels of review.

13

statutory authority to provide monetary compensation on

14

Bivens claims at the administrative level before they're

15

filed in court is an issue on which I -- perhaps they

16

could provide a better answer than I can, Your Honor.

17

think they probably could because they already have a

regulation that seems to provide settlements to, in cases

19

involving Federal employees, after they're in

21

there's any statutory authority for that either.

I think

If Congress decided to do something

like the legislation involving State prisons, it could do

9

MR. SMITH:

Absolutely.

Congress could do that.

10

The only thing that would limit what Congress could do

11

would be constitutional limitations.

12

might be some if Congress created a procedure that was so

13

unfair that -- you know, if they gave you 20 minutes to

to do that.

this remedy exists in the absence of Congress, or whether

it's a common law decision by this Court --

QUESTION:

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

And I suppose, though, although you

I thought Congress could abolish that monetary relief if

they wanted to.

MR. SMITH:

I thought you said it was

The only point I'm making now is

10

that if you're going to eliminate Bivens on the basis of

11

some remedy that exists, it ought to be a significant

12

remedy, or there at least ought to be some affirmative

13

indication from Congress that it doesn't think there

that we really do not want to lose sight of here is that

we are talking about a system that has been designed by

the Bureau of Prisons based upon its experience and

substantial benefits.

this Court suggests that it is entirely appropriate, even

if full relief cannot be given to the claimant, that

benefits and the policies of the agency that is adversely

MR. SMITH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

a few quick points.

or not there can be extensions of time of the 15-day

deadline, Ms. Mahoney referred to it as a mandatory

requirement that they get extensions.

for the extension.

First of all, on the issue of whether

Either it's going to be entirely up to the unguided

discretion of the Bureau of Prisons to decide when to give

an extension, or - - and Ms. Mahoney suggests this is what

process.
On the issue of whether people might be

3

satisfied by some relief other than compensation, and

4

therefore there might be some purpose served by

5

people -- making people go through the grievance process,

6

obviously that is a possibility, but it's not an interest

7

which can justify requiring everybody to exhaust.

8

respondent's brief says that you still have to exhaust

9

this process when you're out of prison altogether when the

The

10

only interest it could possibly -- the only interest that

11

you could possibly have is a compensatory interest, but

12

they still want you to exhaust that.

13

QUESTION:

But the argument for doing so isn't a

14

classic exhaustion argument, it's a kind of help the

15

Government argument, really.

16

way of making sure that the Government is informed that

17

there is a problem, if indeed there is one, and that

18

independent benefit ought to be sufficient to justify it.

19

MR. SMITH:

They're saying this is the

That is a different argument.

I

20

think the problem with that argument from the Government's

21

point of view is they are making contradictory points.

22

First they're saying everybody's rushing off to court to

23

bring these Bivens claims, and at the same time, they're

24

saying they're not getting adequate notice of what's going

25

on in the prison in time to fix it.

1

The third thing that Ms. Mahoney now says, in

2

the Federal Tort Claims Act situation this doesn't arise

3

because 95 percent of the Federal Tort Claims Act claims

4

do get brought to the grievance procedure within that

5

2-year period before they go to the Tort Claims Act

6

procedure -- so they're sort of telling us everybody's

7

going to file a grievance, everybody's rushing off to

8

court.

enough notice about which guard is beating up on people.
I submit to you that the arguments don't make
any sense if you put them right next to each other.
The final point about this idea that you're

14

going to get Federal Tort Claims Act monetary settlements,

15

first of all, it ignores entirely the issue of notice.

16

Nobody in any court that I'm aware of has ever suggested

17

until after cert was granted in this case that the reason

18

we were going to go through this grievance process in

19

Bivens cases is because of a monetary settlement you might

20

get under the Tort Claims Act.

22

assumed there's no damages available, that damages is not

23

something that justifies sending people through the

24

grievance process.
