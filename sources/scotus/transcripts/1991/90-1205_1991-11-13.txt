MR. CHAMBLISS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

I propose to address historical linkage --

majority population of State of Mississippi was black.

21

Thereafter, the State established four other white schools

with very broad scopes.

24

downgrade that college to a high school, and when it

reappeared again several years later, it, too, had a very

The State freely admits in 1954 that it was

3

spending less money for its black institutions, and in

4

fact was sending its graduates off for graduate school

5

education 16 years after this Court's decision in the

6

Canada case.

7

It is interesting to note that in the seventies

8

and the eighties, now, when the State claims to have acted

9

positively, the State action reduced black undergraduate

10

enrollment by 14 percent and caused the number of degrees

11

received by blacks to decrease by almost 400 from back --

You have black people still feeling hostility at

the University of Mississippi, and basically the system is

11

substantially intact from 1962 until now; 99 percent of

the white students go to white schools.

13

Now, the en banc court had an opportunity to deal

14

with the constitutional -- I mean, to not have this Court

15

deal with the constitutional question.

title VI claim to a footnote, but to us this claim came

17

first, it's independent, and I think it's dispositive on

Yes, Your Honor.

2

do you think?
MR. CHAMBLISS:

3

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

4

so.

I think that title VI at least is not any narrower.

5

I think that -- but on title VI, you have examples.

6

see, courts are very reluctant to get into areas they

7

don't know -- well, forgive me for that.

to get into areas that - - we must say higher education is

given this history?

MR. CHAMBLISS:

three aspects that I think that this Court could look at

2

that would help the Court.

3

U.S. Exhibit No. 1, for an example, the first

4

exhibit is a plan of compliance, promises versus

5

performance.

6

said it was going to do and what it actually did do.

7

You can measure what the State basically-

But aside from that, you have a lot of

8

interpretative regulation.

You have the revised criteria.

9

Now, it's not law, the regulations, which two co-equal

10

branches of Government expressed their views, but the

11

revised criteria -- on the executive branch, but the

12

revised criteria tells you -- for an example, it says,

13

when you go into higher education you want -- don't want

14

to put the burden of desegregation on the black colleges.

15

It talks in terms of how you could do various

16

recruiting mechanism and how you can put together programs

17

to overcome the prior effects of racial discrimination,

18

but yes, I think that regulation section 100-3(b)(6)(i),

19

Your Honor, is very instructive in this case.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Chambliss, I'm interested in

21

Justice O'Connor's question.

22

issues, title VI and the constitutional issue, are so

23

intertwined that they may be handled together?

24

MR. CHAMBLISS:

25

QUESTION:

Don't you think the two

I take it you don't?

MR. CHAMBLISS:

1

Well, Your Honor, let me just

2

say it like this.

3

is an independent claim, and even though you may say the

4

standards are the same, they're not coterminous in a sense

5

that under title VI the Government has a lot of regulation

6

that's specific and -- not on this regulation we don't

7

have to deal with intent.
But for an example, if you look at the Guardian

8

9

The way I look at it, the -- title VI

case you -- it was similar to the regulation, but it was

10

(b)(2), and of course, impact versus intent standing --

11

the Constitution, more or less, intent.
But we're not talking here, now, about impact or

12

13

intent.

14

looking at title VI in this area, for example, there are

15

some implications in terms of Governors and advisory

16

committees.

17

about that, but back in the earlier days, under

18

desegregation law they used to have advisory biracial

19

committees, but in higher education I'm not sure that

20

would work that way, but they do give examples of how you

21

can pull the community in.

22

I guess what I'm saying is that when you start

Now, again, back in the old days -- I'm sorry

So I guess to my mind it's a good possibility if

23

the Court decides the title VI you wouldn't bog the Court

24

down in a lot of stuff.

1

Louisiana case, which was different, but they went out and

2

got a master, and --

3

So I'm just saying I think that it would help

4

lower courts, and I think that if people look at the

5

constitutional standard the results under the Constitution

6

may --in the long run I think the results are the same,

7

and that is to eliminate the vestiges of State-imposed

8

segregation, but I think that the means may be a little

9

different.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Chambliss, I'm interested in

11

what specific remedies you propose, and my quandary in

12

particular is this:

13

effect of providing or leading to de facto integration, so

14

that the historically black universities won't be

15

overwhelmingly black and the historically white will not

16

be overwhelmingly white?

17

MR. CHAMBLISS:

18
19

do you want remedies that have the

Is that what you're looking for?
No, sir.

What we looking for,

and I hope I answer the way you can - QUESTION:

Because I mean, if you're looking for

20

that, you would adopt a quite different remedy than, for

21

example, strengthening the curriculums in the historically

22

black schools from the -- if the de facto segregation that

23

now exists is largely -- is largely the result of personal

24

preference --

No -- no sir.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

12

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONER
MR. STARR:

13
14
15

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
For many decades the State of Mississippi

16

created and then deliberately maintained a dual system of

17

higher education:

18

one for whites, one for blacks.

There are, to our mind, at least three clear

19

signs that that system has not been dismantled.

20

is the way students enter the system:

21

admissions test that channels black students to

22

traditionally black institutions.

MR. STARR:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.
You are talking about a

discriminatory impact?
MR. STARR:

4

I am talking about a discriminatory

5

effect in view of this test having first been imposed in

6

the wake of James Meredith's attempt to enter Old Miss.

7

That was the first time that it was imposed, and it is

8

clear and undisputed that it was imposed initially out of

9

discriminatory intent.
Now how does it operate today?

10

It operates

11

today by virtue of the different, minimum standards of the

12

traditionally white institutions versus the traditionally

13

black institutions, to channel black students to the

14

latter institutions, coupled with -- and this is what the

15

State of Mississippi will not be able adequately to

16

explain, and that is the use, Mr. Chief Justice, of that

17

test alone, in the face of advice to the contrary from the

18

ACT program itself, which says, do not use this test

19

alone.

QUESTION:

Were there any district court

MR. STARR:

Are you challenging that finding?

with what the district court did, Mr. Chief Justice.

I don't have to survive a rule 52 challenge

The

13

because what the district court said was, all the State

14

has to do is to say, we adopt race-neutral admissions and

15

other operational policies, and that is wrong.

Judge Higgenbotham got it right in his dissent

17

when he said, as this Court has said, that standard is

dismantlement.

QUESTION:

I was asking you about what I thought

20

was a factual finding of the district -- whether this

21

particular test discriminates or was intended to

22

discriminate at the present time.

23

And I would think that a district court factual

24

finding on that would exist independently of what standard

25

it applied to say what the universities had to do.

MR. STARR:

1

I think that the finding can stand,

2

but the finding, nonetheless, fails to take into account

3

the standard.

4

that may be dividing us.

I think this is a very important aspect

And that is, if the standard, the legal standard

5
6

the court is applying is, is there an intent to

7

discriminate and there is a finding that there is no

8

intention to discrimination, then I am not here to

challenge that particular finding.

But I am here to challenge the standard.

would somehow operate to have people going to college who

were to some degree ready for a college education.

MR. GOODMAN:

We have the same situation here,

there were all white and all black clubs, but then we had

QUESTION:

But isn't the difference that -- and

I'm

-- I may be wrong on this, but I thought the crucial

difference was that after the Bazemore policies had been

modified there wasn't a kind of administrative structure

in place which, by continuing to reflect the old policies

encouraged their continuation.

it doesn't have to be the only answer, because if we want

to read all of your precedents -- and we're concerned

about the fact that we do have a duty, and no question

about that, and we do have an obligation.
