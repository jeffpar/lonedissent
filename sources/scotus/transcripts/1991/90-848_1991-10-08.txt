(1:40 p.m.)

MR. BECKHAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents another opportunity for the

12

court to rule upon the question of the Eleventh Amendment

13

or the - - that is the presence or the absence of the real

14

Eleventh Amendment, or the presence or the absence of the

15

judicial gloss Eleventh Amendment.

16

We submit, first of all, that the case below is

17

clearly in conflict with the decisions of this court in

18

the Parden case, in the Petty case before that, and

19

indeed, in the Welch case, where five members of this

20

Court reaffirmed the validity of the existence and the

21

viability of the existence of the cause of action under

22

the FELA or the Jones Act against State-owned entities.

23

In addition to those specific authorities,

24

dealing with the FELA-Jones Act, we have cited three other

25

cases, the United States v. California, California v.

consistently holding that the pervasive effect of the

3

preemptive power of Congress in dealing with this Nation's

4

railroads, mandate that there is a uniform system that

5

applies to each and every railroad in America.

6

We still believe that this Court's decision

7

recently in the Port Authority case between -- dealing

8

with the entity between New York and New Jersey,

9

implicitly reaffirms the existence of this cause of

10

action.

11

was expressed statutory waiver of immunity from Federal

12

court jurisdiction, the classic Eleventh Amendment bar.

13

The Court held that that jurisdiction had been waived --

14

the bar had been waived.

15

entirely fruitless for this Court to have decided that

16

case if in any event the statute didn't apply to State-

17

owned railroads.

18

In the PATH case, the Court determined that there

And it would be, it seems to us,

The Court determined, though, that the waiver

19

was adequate and that jurisdiction did exist in the

20

Federal courts for a cause of action under the Jones

21

Act-FELA to be brought against the State-owned entity.

22

We contend that if there is any further doubt or

23

dispute that the railroad in this case, by a series of

24

methods has -- South Carolina has consented or surrendered

-- whatever phraseology that may be in current vogue -- to

This is not a waiver or a consent or a surrender to

anything expressly granted to the States in the

16

This is a consent, however, we contend, to the
reach of Congress under the commerce clause.
We feel that here are two or three types of

express consent, depending upon the cases that one looks

18

to from this Court.

20

convention certainly would authorize a finding that any

21

State that engages in interstate commerce does so with the

22

firm understanding that at the time the State came into

23

the Union, it surrendered its authority over interstate

24

commerce to the express clause of the commerce clause in

25

the Constitution.

We, in this case, however, have more.

We have

specific statutory acknowledgment by the South Carolina

legislature that recognizes its obedience and obeisance,

4

if you will, to Federal law.

that at the time the defendant entity was created, the

6

South Carolina legislature directed that they comply with

the provisions of the Railway Labor Act.

QUESTION:

MR. BECKHAM:

Your Honor, that's true.

Mr.

19

Justice, what happened, we filed this case in the Federal

20

court in Charleston.

very clearly the Welch case said there's no Federal court

if it's going to bind, the State ought to be pretty

MR. BECKHAM:

6

I think it's specific enough.

7

I say that even if it weren't specific enough, the

8

voluntary act of the State of South Carolina has

surrendered to that.

in America that railroad legislation by Congress applied

The whole purpose,

I have a hard time, Mr. Chief

Justice - -

QUESTION:

MR. BECKHAM:

-- understanding whether its a

10

waiver or a surrender.

The Court, frankly, in various

11

opinions kind of bounces back and forth.
QUESTION:

12

I know --

A waiver, we have talked about in

13

other cases, being a conscious surrender of a knowing

14

right or something.

15

thing, are you?

You're not talking about that sort of

MR. BECKHAM:

QUESTION:

MR. BECKHAM:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I am.

You are?
In the statutory enactments that I

referred to, the South Carolina court -- excuse

expressly acknowledges the existence of Federal regulatory

That's

QUESTION:

1

Well, does that show that they knew

2

of the right, that is that they knew that they weren't

3

subject to it unless they said they were?

4

MR. BECKHAM:

5

QUESTION:

6

I don't think so at all.

So that it's not a waiver in the

classic sense you're talking about.

7

MR. BECKHAM:

Regrettably, in this case, we were

8

pretermitted at the lower level before getting a lot of

9

discovery.

In the Parden case, they showed, I believe,

10

that the railroad employees were given rule books that

11

talked about FELA, et cetera, et cetera.

12

were cut off at the pass and we were not --we don't have

13

a record that would explain precisely what they - -

14

QUESTION:

This case, we

What theory did Parden proceed on?

15

Was it the every common carrier by railroad is specific

16

enough to include a State?

17

MR. BECKHAM:

Is that what the Court said?

Mr. Justice, first of all, the

18

Court did say that when the Congress said every, it meant

19

every.

You couldn't get any more all inclusive than that.
QUESTION:

20
21

And there's no question that there

was a common carrier involved.

22

MR. BECKHAM:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

No question.

The only question was that the State

owned it.
MR. BECKHAM:

That is exactly -9

QUESTION:

1

2

Is that the theory the Court

proceeded on?

3

MR. BECKHAM:

That's one.

It also -- the Court

4

also said that by engaging in interstate commerce by rail,

5

that they had either surrendered or consented - - the

6

Alabama Railroad had either surrendered or consented.

7

you read through the decision subsequently, you'll find

8

that sometimes Parden is referred to as an authorization

9

case, that is the Congress authorized it by virtue of

10

saying every.

11

case.

12

that's why I say we have some difficulty in knowing

13

exactly which hat to put on it.

14

As

Sometimes it's referred to as a waiver

Sometimes it's referred to as a surrender case.

But it did cover both theories.

So

It did say that

15

the statute was broad enough and there was no question, as

16

you said, that literally it did apply, and that Mr. Chief

17

Justice has written several opinions, Edelman and Quern, I

18

believe, specifically talking about the fact that there

1:9

was no question in Petty and in Parden that the State was

20

literally an entity that was within the description.

21

So that is

22

QUESTION:

So what happens to your argument as a

23

result of the treatment of Parden in our Welch decision --

24

or decisions?

Justice, five members of the Court said FELA survives.

2

The plurality opinion for the Court by Justice Powell

3

carried the day in saying Federal court jurisdiction, that

4

explicit constitutional language had not been overcome.

5

The Court expressly refrained in the plurality opinion

6

from addressing whether the FELA survived against State

entity.

8

10
11

QUESTION:

Well, just assume that the FELA

applied -- would apply to the States, I guess.

Because

otherwise there's no Eleventh Amendment problem.
MR. BECKHAM:

Well, there's no Eleventh

12

Amendment problem in State court until you get to the

13

gloss on the Eleventh Amendment.

14

State court presents no open and obvious Eleventh

15

Amendment problem.

most recently on the opinion in the Will case.

17

QUESTION:

A State being sued in a

And of course this was highlighted

But there is a certain irony, and

18

maybe it's self-engendered as a result of our opinions,

19

that Congress would pass a statute regulating a liability

20

of railroads to their employees.

21

to State railroads in Federal court, but it is applicable

22

to State railroads in State court.

MR. BECKHAM:

This irony only arises because of

MR. BECKHAM:

that every owner of a railroad engaged in interstate

MR. BECKHAM:

4

As we point out in the Urie decision, the Urie

It certainly seems so to us.

6

the same language goes for the - - this Court said it not

only in Parden, the Court said it in Petty.

8

said it Petty, that the broadest possible language that

9

was utilized left the Court no way out but to say that

The Court

States were included.
Here's what we say, however.

You know, just

12

like the Hans case, supposedly now has added, and we know

13

what the Eleventh Amendment means, not because of what it

14

says, but because of what this Court says it says.

15

once this Court has said what Title 45, Section 51 means,

then that's it.

17

that every includes States.

They had been told time and

time and time again by this Court.
And just as the Eleventh Amendment loss under

the decision in Hans and the succeeding opinions of this

Court give meaning to what the Eleventh Amendment says and

what it means certainly the decisions of this Court

7

stating, restating, and reaffirming what every railroad

means, has to mean what it says.
So we think that the necessity for the clear

in this case by authoritative and definitive judicial

interpretation.

Counsel argues that FELA permits his client to

sue the State of South Carolina in our own courts for

money damages for personal injuries as a result of alleged

negligence on the part of the State of South Carolina.

Are you questioning the power of

Congress to subject a State-owned railroad to the FELA if

it said so expressly?

So as the case comes to use we assume

that the State of North Carolina could decline to consent.

Beckham.

12

and then to go on and to hold that they had surrendered

13

that immunity, that I don't believe bears analytical

scrutiny.

has to be regarded as a consent case.

It was internally inconsistent in that when

And

that is that it's the very same interest at stake.

grant you that in the Eleventh Amendment context we're

The clear statement rule grew out of a need to

protect the State's sovereignty.

The sovereignty didn't

10

The limitation on Article III judicial power existed

11

because of the pre-existing existence of the sovereign

interests of the State, the very same interests that are

13

at stake at applying general language to abrogate a

Yes, sir.

If the Court doesn't

the merits.

the issue of whether FELA or the -- excuse me, the Jones

In Garcia, this Court backed off, if you will,

whether or not it's going to exercise its authority to

MR. SIMONS:

Yes.
Well, why is it jurisdictional when

it weighs the Eleventh Amendment but substantive when it

I'm not quite -- how do you know when it's

MR. SIMONS:

20

Because the decision to make the

that question.

You put language in the bill that puts everyone on notice

MR. SIMONS:
