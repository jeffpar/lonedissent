ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD S. RAUCHBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. RAUCHBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Petitioner, Simon & Schuster, is here today

11
12

challenging the constitutionality of section 632(a) of New

13

York's Executive Law, commonly known as "the Son of Sam"

14

law.

15

statute and to its application to Simon & Schuster on the

16

facts of this case.

17

The challenge is both to the facial validity of the

Section 632(a) was enacted in 1977 and applies

18

to works of expression and only to works of expression.

19

It applies to books, movies, magazine articles, and the

20

other expressive works that are specified in the statute.

21

Whenever a publisher --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Rauchberg, are there other laws

23

in New York that apply to other assets of someone who has

24

committed a crime; not this statute, but other statutes

25

that would make other assets subject to reach under a

scheme like this?
MR. RAUCHBERG:

There are two sets of statutes

3

that might be responsive to your question.

4

is the statutes that provide tort remedies for all victims

5

of tort, which of course apply to crime victims as well,

6

and second, it bears mentioning that New York has a law,

7

as I would guess, most jurisdictions do that have laws

8

like this, New York has a law providing for the forfeiture

9

of the proceeds of crime.

10

First, there

Of course, there has never been any contention

11

that the forfeiture provision would pertain to the

12

proceeds of a book or other expressive work or to

13

royalties for the authorship of a book.

14

But other than that, no.

Other than that there

15

is only this statute selecting speech-related assets for

16

special treatment.

17

QUESTION:

Of course, the forfeiture statute

18

does not turn over the forfeited proceeds to any

19

particular victim.

20

MR. RAUCHBERG:

That's correct.

The forfeiture

21

statute provides for forfeiture to the State, but the

22

point I wanted to make is that it never occurred to the

23

legislators in New York that the forfeiture statute would

24

pertain to the proceeds of a book contract, and therefore,

25

any suggestion that these are somehow crime proceeds I

think is simply not correct.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rauchberg, does the forfeiture

statute, is its reach limited to items that were used in
the commission of the crime?
MR. RAUCHBERG:

It applies to both

instrumentalities of the crime and the proceeds of the
crime.
QUESTION:

And proceeds too?

MR. RAUCHBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes, absolutely.

So that in the example given in one

of the briefs, under the forfeiture statute New York could
have proceeded against any profits derived by Mr. Milken
from his illegal trading?
MR. RAUCHBERG:

No, I don't think it could

because -- oh, I am sorry, I misunderstood the question.
Profits from illegal trading, assuming that they violated
State laws as well as Federal laws, would be presumably
within the forfeiture provisions of the New York statute,
yes.
The statute has an extremely broad definition of
the phrase criminal.

In fact, it uses the term person

accused or convicted of a crime, and in addition to
applying to persons who are accused of crime, it applies
to persons convicted, whether of State crimes or of
Federal crimes, but it goes beyond that to include in its

of insanity, and it also applies to persons who are never

3

charged with crime at all, but who are deemed by the Crime

4

Victims Board to have admitted crimes.

All of these various types of authors are
treated as persons - -

7

QUESTION:

Is it your understanding that under

8

this particular statute that an author who admitted in the

9

course of a book that 20 years before he had stolen a pack

10

of cigarettes, that that would bring him under this

11

statute?
MR. RAUCHBERG:

12

Absolutely.

It absolutely

would.

in New York to contain a special statute of limitations

15

provision that starts the limitations period running anew

16

for any crime victim who wishes to begin a proceeding,

17

collect a judgment, and obtain access to the proceeds of

18

the book, first of all, so the 20-year period would not be

19

a barrier.

20

The law has been interpreted by the State Courts

And second of all, the statute does apply not

21

only to those who are convicted, but to those who are

found to have admitted crimes in their book.

24

activities triggered the application by the Crime Board of

25

the statute to Simon & Schuster is somebody who was

witness protection program, and had been immunized rather

3

than being charged with the various activities described

4

in his book.

5

And he was found to be within the description of

6

a convicted person because his book was deemed to contain

7

admissions of crime.

8

9

QUESTION:

If there had been an earlier judgment

in favor of the victim that had been satisfied, a judgment

10

for damages caused by the crime, I take it, no new cause

11

of action would arise by reason of the publication?

12

MR. RAUCHBERG:

The State courts haven't treated

13

that question, and so I suppose there is possibly some

14

room for argument.

15

interpretation of the statute.

16

Appeals has interpreted the statute as not being

17

applicable to victimless crimes.

18

But I think that is a likely
The New York Court of

And so it would seem not a great step for the

19

statute to be interpreted as not applying to those crimes

20

with victims where the victims have been fully compensated

21

as well, but I really don't know.

22

QUESTION:

In your view, could a State court,

23

through the exercise of their common law jurisdiction,

24

make it an independent tort for a perpetrator of a crime

25

to recount the crime for profit?

1

MR. RAUCHBERG:

I think not.

I think that such

2

a statute, making a tort out of speech, would be so

3

inconsistent with the concepts of the First Amendment that

4

it would absolutely have to be

5

QUESTION:

Well, suppose in a rape case where

6

the victim is suing for damages there has been a book

7

recounting the lurid details of the crime.

8

9

has the victim suffered anguish, but there was a book

Could the jury

10

about this and you are entitled to take that into account

11

in giving your damages?

12

MR. RAUCHBERG:

I think not.

I think not.

I

13

think this Court has held that truthful speech,

14

nondefamatory speech may be outrageous, may be offensive,

15

and is nonetheless protected by the First Amendment.

16

For example, in the Hustler case.

17

QUESTION:

But in the Hustler case there was no

18

antecedent criminal act.

19

MR. RAUCHBERG:

I don't think the antecedent

20

criminal act is relevant to the question of whether the

21

speech ought to be protected or not.

22

QUESTION:

So in your view, a rapist could break

23

into the victim's apartment, rape the victim,â€™and then

write a lurid account of it.

3

MR. RAUCHBERG:

I say that

is correct.

4
5

I say that is right.

QUESTION:

Because that is a far cry from

Falwell, because here there is an antecedent crime.
MR. RAUCHBERG:

6

There is an antecedent crime,

7

but the crime is a separate act from the authorship of a

8

book.

9

encouraged, not an act to be suppressed.
QUESTION:

10

11

The authorship of a book is an act to be

Your position is that we should

encourage books of the kind I just described?
MR. RAUCHBERG:

12

My position is that the First

13

Amendment encourages the writing of all books, and it is-

14

not for this Court to distinguish between which books

15

should be encouraged and which books should not.

16

to the point, it is not for the State of New York to

17

decide that books on a specified subject, namely crime, by

18

a specified class of authors, namely criminals as defined,

19

are books to be discouraged as opposed to encouraged.
QUESTION:

20

And more

Well, the First Amendment doesn't

21

encourage the writing of libelous books, certainly, does

22

it?

23

MR. RAUCHBERG:

24

QUESTION:

25

It does not.

Well, why isn't this maybe another

category of books that the First Amendment doesn't

MR. RAUCHBERG:

2

There isn't any issue of false

3

statements raised here.

4

content-based discriminations that this law creates is

5

that it brings about exactly the kind of distortion in the

6

marketplace of ideas that content-based laws are capable

7

of doing, and for that reason are abhorrent.

QUESTION:

It can commission books from the

8

victims, Simon & Schuster just has to put the money in

9

escrow, doesn't it, and pay it ultimately not to the

10

criminal defendant, but to the victim.
MR. RAUCHBERG:

11

What we have in this case is a

12

garden-variety publishing contract.

13

activities of the press carried on in the way the press

14

has carried on its activities for decades, in which a

15

contract is made to provide for payment in order to get

got it because the statute was not complied with.

21

The record shows that most authors require

timely compensation.

23

you will get less authorship.

subject to escrow to pay victims of his crimes?
MR. RAUCHBERG:

2

I think the answer to that is

3

yes, because then we wouldn't have a content-based

4

selection of speech for special treatment that results in

5

a

6

distortion of the flow of ideas.
QUESTION:

This is kind of a curious case

7

because all the payment restriction cases that we have

8

had, I think, stand for the proposition that the State

9

can't limit payments by the speaker to a messenger.

10

And yet in this case, we have payments to the

11

speaker by the publisher.

12

situation, have we?

13

MR. RAUCHBERG:

So we have not had that

I think it is correct to think

14

of Henry Hill as a speaker.

15

think of Simon & Schuster as a speaker.

16

But it is also correct to

Simon & Schuster resolved to put out a book that

17

would have a particular kind of anti-crime message that

18

would be an antidote to romanticized versions of crime

19

like The Godfather.

20

that speech.

21

Simon & Schuster is a speaker.

22

Simon & Schuster resolved to utter

Simon & Schuster is a member of the press.

And in order for Simon & Schuster to have

QUESTION:

6

Suppose in Justice O'Connor's

7

situation where there is a statute that affects oral

8

income, it is shown that 90 percent of the recovery is

9

from people who author books after committing crimes, or

10

produce movies?
MR. RAUCHBERG:

11

I suppose it is possible that at

12

some point an apparently general statute could be shown to

13

be, in fact, aimed at speech.

14

what would happen here.

But I don't think that is

The instances of criminals

It is not the kind of thing that happens.
This law has been in effect since 1977.

And in

18

its 14 years, the State of New York has established

19

exactly six escrow accounts, one of which was returned to

20

the criminal because no victims came forward, four of

21

which are still there waiting to see, and only one of

22

which has produced any payments to a victim.

23

been the victims of precisely one criminal who have been

24

advantaged by the statute.

25

So there has

So a general statute, if there were a general

1

statute enacted that would help victims obtain

2

compensation through enhancing their ability to get at all

3

the assets of the criminals, we see there would be

4

precious few examples of books, but all of the assets that

5

criminals have, the millions of a Michael Milken or an

6

Ivan Boesky, and whatever assets criminals have, would all

7

be better reached by victims under such a statute.So I don't think we would find that 90 percent

figure suggested by Your Honor's hypothetical.
QUESTION:

10

But would not such a law also

11

discourage the writing of books, although it would do lots

12

of other things, too?

13

MR. RAUCHBERG:

Well, it wouldn't specifically

14

discourage the authorship of books, just as tax laws

15

generally applied don't discourage the authorship of

16

books.

17

engage in remunerative activities other than authorship.

18

They make the playing field equal.

The general tax laws don't encourage people to

Schuster that you cannot compensate those people for books

11

results in our not having those books.

QUESTION:

Counsel, can I ask you a question

question.

17

It is generated by Justice O'Connor's earlier

3

QUESTION:

Do you understand that provision to

4

require that the author admit that what he did was in fact

5

against the law or merely must admit facts which this

6

commission may determine violated the law?

7
8

MR. RAUCHBERG:

I would understand it to be the

latter.
QUESTION:

9

So if a businessman described a lot

10

of business activities that were arguably violations of

11

the antitrust laws, the commission would decide whether in

fact that was a violation of law or not, even though he

13

thought he was innocent?

MR. RAUCHBERG:

That is right.

I would

MR. RAUCHBERG:

That is-right.

C, and D, and thereby violated section so-and-so of the

1

his words was held to be the trigger that led to the

2

application of the statute.

3

Now, the interests that New York advances in an

4

effort to justify this content-based law that, in fact,

5

inhibits speech are, first, the interest in victim's

6

compensation.

7

can't save this statute.
If the existing remedies available to plaintiffs

8

9

But I think it is clear that that interest

in civil actions in New York are inadequate to meet the

10

needs of crime victims, it is incumbent upon New York to

11

enhance them generally so that crime victims generally can

12

do better in reaching the assets of criminals.

13

just enhance them for this one asset that is speech-

14

related.

15

I think the State recognizes that.

And not

And so it

16

goes on into what is a more sophisticated effort to

17

justify the statute.

18

They are instead the earnings of an author in the typical

This law says that those are all crime proceeds,

They're not crime proceeds, and the law that Your Honor is

MR. RAUCHBERG:

Well, the -- one does more than

embellish by artistry the account of a crime in a book

like the autobiography of Malcolm X.

of the book is to discuss the effect of prison on the

3

Why just publishing a book?

the story as a direct relationship to the victimization.

victims all over again, so to speak?

14

MR. ZWICKEL:

Well, we talk about injury on the

15

victims, but the injury this statute addresses -- and

16

there is obviously a temptation to say, the statute is

17

based upon the offensiveness of what the criminal is

18

saying.
But that's-not what this statute was talking

about.

the money.

2

MR. ZWICKEL:

3

QUESTION:

4

That's correct.

Well, the State of New York here

takes it in advance.

5

MR. ZWICKEL:

Well, it certainly does, but the

6

key factor here, you also have to recognize, is the plight

7

of victims, Your Honor.

8

are two critical components of this statute.

9

We have a situation where there

First of all, it preserves the asset at the time

10

that the money is paid.

In many of these cases, the money

11

is paid to the criminal years before the story is

12

produced.

13

This statute ensures that it is held in escrow.

That money might very likely be dissipated.

14

The second thing that is critical about this

15

statute is that this statute extends the statute of

16

limitations.

17

comes years after the criminal is released and after the

18

statute of limitations has expired.

19

So that we all know about the story that

The victims in that situation have no remedy.

20

Under this statute, they do have a remedy, but the remedy

21

is limited to the in rem proceeding against the proceeds.
The third critical component as to why this

22

23

statute serves New York's purpose so well is that it gives

24

victims' judgments a priority over the judgments of other

25

creditors.

QUESTION:

Do you agree that it is fair to say

that the object is not to preclude the criminal from

from profiting before the victims get paid?

MR. ZWICKEL:

QUESTION:

10

It is a

That is absolutely right.

So everything you said really about

directly profiting is essentially beside your point?
MR. ZWICKEL:

Well, it is a combined interest.

11

It is directly profiting before your victims, Your Honor.

12

If the victim's judgments are less than the money in the

13

account, the criminal gets what remains in the account,

14

which is another reason - -

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you with a slightly

different question.

that mostly today.

But in your brief you start out with the

21

principal argument that a wrongdoer should not profit from

his or her wrong.

crimes as well as those that have victims, should it not?

If that were a sufficient

it does not.
QUESTION:

2

3

Do you think it could?

it could constitutionally be applied to victimless crimes?

4

MR. ZWICKEL:

5

QUESTION:

6

Yes, I do.

I think that --

Why didn't the State do it, do you

suppose?

7
8

Do you think

MR. ZWICKEL:

Because I think the interest that

the State focused upon which is the critical interest here
is the unfairness of the criminal profiting before his

10
11
12

13

victims.
This is not a statute designed simply to tell
criminals, you can't profit at all.
QUESTION:

In fact --

If you think the interest in

14

preventing the criminal from profiting from his wrong

15

would be sufficient, which would mean, as I understand it,

16

that no matter how trivial the wrong, no matter how great

17

the reward from writing the book, you could still

18

appropriate the entire reward?

1

MR. ZWICKEL:

I do.

I think States and the

20

Federal Government have valid interests in stopping

21

criminals from profiting from crime, but this statute is a

22

more narrowly tailored statute in that respect.

23

This statute allows the criminal to obtain any

24

money that is left in the account.

does, as Justice Souter pointed out --

in some of these cases about substantial sums of money.

2

We hear reports of criminals making $500,000 or $1 million

3

or more, but what this statute addresses is that the money

4

is held in escrow and the criminal brings his civil tort

5

action for his injury and suffering.
It is very hard for us to see that the victims

6

7

who have been injured by the crime, who have suffered from

8

this crime, should not have the right to pursue a tort

9

remedy and know that there is an asset which flows

10

directly from their victimization, which the Board is

11

holding.

12

13
14

That is why this statute is such a meaningful
statute, and frankly -QUESTION:

Excuse me, you keep saying an

15

accent --an asset that flows directly from their

16

victimization.

17

MR. ZWICKEL:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.

But you acknowledged before that the

19

entire amount of that asset doesn't flow directly from

their victimization.

though there is only one minor incident addressed in the

book, isn't that right?

for production of the book, that would still be swept up

2

into the escrow, right?

3

MR. ZWICKEL:

4

QUESTION:

5

Well, yes --

So it is not just the direct product

of the crime that is covered at all.
MR. ZWICKEL:

Well, Your Honor, it is because

the crime is in the story.

8

does apply an objective neutral criterion.

The reason again for that, let me try to

11
12

emphasize, is that the statute simply attaches the asset.

13

If the victim sues and recovers a very limited judgment,

14

then there will be a substantial, sum of money available

15

for this person.
QUESTION:

16

But it seems to me that a better way

17

to describe it, instead of constantly referring to it as

18

the product of the crime, is to say that it is an asset

tainted by the crime.

20

accurate?

21

MR. ZWICKEL:

Well, I don't think New York looks

at this asset in terms of what taint might suggest.

1

Thank you.

I wanted to say a

crimes.

I suppose it was unsuccessful and there was no victim.

There wasn't a word about any

10

convictions, and if it addressed convictions it might well

11

hold them irrelevant.
QUESTION:

12

I take it that your argument would

13

be - - would be the same or almost the same even if in this

14

book only crimes that Hill committed were described?

15

MR. RAUCHBERG:

Yes, it would be about the same,

16

and if Hill -- if Hill had in fact been convicted of

17

crimes and that were the basis for the law being applied

18

here, then one of the interests that the Court of Appeals

19

of New York has identified, namely punishment, might be

triggered.
