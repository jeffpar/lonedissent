ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARC Z. EDELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EDELL:

Thank you Chief Justice Rehnquist,

and may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the Federal

10
11

Cigarette Labeling Act preempts State common law tort

12

claims against cigarette manufacturers for failure to

13

warn, fraud, deception, and misrepresentation.

14

In 1964, the Surgeon General's Advisory

15

Committee on Smoking and Health issued its landmark

16

report.

17

the major cause of preventable death in the United States.

18

In response to that report, States and municipalities

19

across the country began proposing legislation that would

20

require cigarette manufacturers to place warning labels on

21

their packs of cigarettes and in their advertising.

22

In that report, it indicted cigarette smoking as

At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission

23

began its rulemaking process which would likewise require

24

cigarette manufacturers to place a specific warning on

25

packs of cigarettes and in their advertising.

Congress intervened.

Congress intervened for two reasons.

basis in light of the Surgeon General's report and its

conclusions.

Congress, in enacting the 1965 Cigarette

of preemption.

It was not because the cigarette

2

manufacturers, now 15 years into the litigation, decided

3

that they needed some protection from these tort suits.

4

The reason was that the section 1334(b), that is the

preemption section applicable to warning labels in

advertising, was to expire on July 1, 1969.

1965 hearings did the industry ask for protection for

these cases.

3

1965 or '69 is there any suggestion that Congress, any one

4

Congressman - - Congressperson - - suggested that there

would be preemption of State common law tort claims.

At no time during either of the hearings in

All discussions regarding State common law tort

6

7

claims were based upon the assumption that these cases

8

were to continue.
QUESTION:

9

Well, the language Congress used

10

is - - certainly can be construed more broadly than you're

11

suggesting.

MR. EDELL:

12

13

Don't you agree with that?
I don't agree with that, Chief

Justice Rehnquist.

14

QUESTION:

You don't think that the provision of

15

section (b) could be read to preclude the sort of failure

16

to warn claims in State tort litigation?

17
18
19

MR. EDELL:

No, I don't, Chief Justice

Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Then you think the Third Circuit is

20

simply irrational, I suppose, if you don't think it can

21

even reasonably be read that way.

22

MR. EDELL:

I think that the natural read of

23

section 1334(b) does not suggest that these cases -- that

24

these cases are encompassed in that preemption.

25

fact, the Third Circuit did not read 1334(b) as

And in

specifically including these cases.

2

said that on the issue of expressed preemption, 1334(b)

3

did not state that these cases were preempted.

4

QUESTION:

The Third Circuit

Suppose in a suit such as the type

5

that was heard here the judge says, ladies and gentlemen

6

of the jury, you're instructed that the warnings currently

7

on cigarette packages are required by Federal law, and

8

that as a matter of Federal and State law they're

9

adequate.

And that you may impose no additional

10

prohibition or requirement on such advertisements.

that a proper instruction to the jury?

What do you think is the proper

Is the manufacturer

1

entitled to that instruction based on your reading of the

2

statute?

3

MR. EDELL:

No.

I think that the manufacturer

4

is entitled to the instruction that the jury, in

5

considering whether or not the manufacturer met its

6

standard of care that's required under common law, placed

7

a warning required by the Federal Government on its packs

8

of cigarettes and in its cigarette advertising.

9

the Third Circuit opinion, it has historically been in the

But until

10

area of tort law that if a manufacturer, or anyone else

11

for that matter, follows a regulation, that that

12

regulation sets the floor and not the ceiling for

13

manufacturers' behavior.

14

QUESTION:

So the manufacturer's not entitled to

15

an instruction that these labels as a matter of Federal

16

law are adequate and sufficient, and that the jury may not

17

impose as a matter of State law any more restrictive

18

requirement.

MR. EDELL:

QUESTION:

To answer the first part of your

I mean, isn't that just the words of

the statute?
MR. EDELL:

It is.

It is, but with respect to

tort law, juries don't decide what further language should

be placed on packages of cigarettes or in cigarette

It saw all of the

internal documents that we've developed during the course
of discovery, some of which are a part of our appendix.
And where the industry attempted to neutralize the effect
of the Federally mandated warning.
The only question that the jury would then
answer would be, question, did cigarette manufacturer X
adequately inform its consumers of the health hazards of
cigarette smoking?

Yes or no.

And if they answered no,

that doesn't mean that the warning itself is not adequate.
It could very well be that but for the intentional acts to
neutralize that warning that the warning by itself is
adequate.

And this is not an alien concept.

This is a

Would it be error for the district -- for the

trial court to instruct the jury that you may
require - - you may impose no requirement or prohibition
other than what is set forth in the Federal law?

I don't see how that fits in the

context of a tort action.

It's the law, isn't it?

MR. EDELL:

2

Well, it's -- with all Sue respect,

3

Justice Kennedy, I don't know whether or not it's relevant

4

on the issue of -- the issue that the jury is to decide.

5

The issue to be decided is whether or not they adequately

6

informed their consumers.

7

QUESTION:

May I ask a related question?

Part

8

of the basis for the liability, I think, was on fraudulent

9

misrepresentation in advertising.

10

MR. EDELL:

11

QUESTION:

Is that right?

That's correct.
And 1334(b) says no requirement or

12

prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed

13

under State law with respect to the advertising.

14

tort suit based on fraudulent misrepresentation in

15

advertising does appear to seek to impose a State law

16

prohibition within the meaning of that subsection.

17

option does the manufacturer have other than to cease

18

using the advertising?

19

in the literal language?

Now, a

And how is that not covered by (b)

I know that's not the basis on which CA-3

20
21

decided, but I just wonder, in the context of the

22

fraudulent misrepresentation, how it is not covered

23

by (b).

24
25

What

MR. EDELL:

Justices O'Connor, I think that is

probably one of the more difficult issues in this case.

Not necessarily only on fraudulent misrepresentation,

So a yes answer to that question does not

something, does not necessarily require them from no

know from the jury verdict whether or not it was the --a

there was fraudulent misrepresentation.

Because we don't

I think the harder issue, and I will admit it,

18

is the express warranty issue, where you have a particular

advertisement, and a jury says this particular

advertisement is a breach of warranty.

manufacturer has the choice of, one, paying the judgment,

as we say in our brief, and merrily proceeding to employ

Yes, he does.

QUESTION:

What about punitive damages?

Suppose

5

the jury not only finds the cigarette manufacturer

6

misrepresented contrary to common law and imposes

7

compensatory damages, but even imposes punitive damages.

8

Does that change your answer at all?
MR. EDELL:

It would give the manufacturer

10

greater incentive to exercise its discretion in a

11

reasonable fashion, yes, I believe so.

12

QUESTION:

But I mean, you'd say punitive

MR. EDELL:

1

If there was a tort action, if there

2

was a -- for example, a nuisance action, that would

3

require a manufacturer to specifically place a particular

warning in an advertisement, and if they failed to do

that, then an injunction would issue.

at some of the more recent jurisprudence from this Court.

4

If we look at Silkwood, if we look at English, if we look

at Goodyear, if think that we see the Court saying,

different than direct regulatory effect that Congress

intended to prohibit.

It's not an expressed

see what Congress intended, other than by the language

There the Congress said, this is the specific

2

warning that should be put on packs of smokeless tobacco.

3

And yet it provided at the very same time, in light of all

4

of the preemption decisions, a savings clause saying, it's

sue.

That's a specific example that I could give you.

7

Now, I guess, you know, in the end the burden is

8

not on us to show that Congress intended that these

9

matters were to continue.

It's the burden of the

10

respondents to show with crystal clarity, I would suggest,

11

that it was Congress' intent to do away with these tort

actions.

13

I think that with respect to the tension issue,

14

Congress was willing to accept the tension that these

15

lawsuits might produce.

16

these lawsuits, we talk about, is it realistic to assume

17

that it's going to change the behavior of this industry?

18

Is it realistic to assume a failure to warn claim will

require them to change their warning label --

20

QUESTION:

And again, when we talk about

Mr. Edell, certainly in some of the

21

debates over so-called tort reform, one of the arguments

22

used by people who are against capping damages and that

sort of thing, is that these kind of suits are the best

way to regulate an industry and to keep its products safe.

First, it was the judgment of Congress reflected in

That is that it, along with the Federal

preempted from setting their own standards of conduct, and

10

it naturally follows that unless Congress says otherwise

in the act, that Congress also means to preempt the States

from enforcing their standards of conduct, whether they

13

choose to do so by sanctions, like fines, or remedial

Second, Congress did not mean to preempt just

which Congress was legislating in this area.

As

petitioner has noted, after the Surgeon General's report

3

came out, there were a number of different proposals

4

regarding restrictions that could be put on the marketing

5

of cigarettes.

6

that had been drafted and proposed, and there were

7

proposals to require warnings on packages, to require

warnings in advertisements, to ban advertising altogether

There were a number of different warnings

as far as cigarettes were concerned, or less restrictive

bans on advertising.
And what Congress recognized, correctly, was

12

that this was a national problem and it needed a national

MR. FARR:

I certainly would defend the part of

4

differently, Justice White, is that I do not think that

the court of appeals, frankly, gave enough weight to the

6

plain language of section 1334(b).

7

QUESTION:

What I would say

In that regard, Mr. Farr, do you

think it looked at the plain language of the '65 statute

So you would be content to rest your

16

case on the language of the '65 statute?
MR. FARR:

I would be content to rest my case on

1

just that specific preemption provision, does not contain

2

as broad language as the '69 act.
Our position, however, is the act as a whole --

3

QUESTION:

So it only relates to statements in

5

advertising.

6

MR. FARR:

Pardon me?

7

QUESTION:

It only relates to statements in

9

advertising.
MR. FARR:

That's correct.

But our contention

10

is that the act as a whole, when you take into account the

11

purposes and policies of section 1331, was in fact

12

intended even for that 4-year period to also cover what

13

the 1969 act clearly covers.

14

and the legislative history supports this -- in 1969, what

15

was before Congress was essentially a debate about the

16

scope of the 1965 act.

17

position that the 1965 act essentially covered only what

18

your question would suggest, Justice Stevens, simply

19

requirements about statements in advertising.

20

was the position that the court of appeals had taken here

21

in D.C. in the Banzhaf case.

A number of Congressmen took the

However, a number of other Congressmen said that

So we believe that in fact the scope of both
acts is the same.
QUESTION:

As far as your field preemption field

6

argument is concerned, I take it that's what you're

7

talking about.

8

9

MR. FARR:

We believe that the field is

essentially the same.

I mean, to some extent any

10

preemptive provision preempts some field, and that's of

11

course what we're saying.

12

QUESTION:

But if there is a so-called field

13

preemption that you're arguing for and that you have to

14

get around to express conflict or frustration, doesn't the

15

'69 act help you in that regard?

16

MR. FARR:

Well, I think the entire act should

17

be read together.

This is why I think it is difficult to

18

say we are relying only on one theory of preemption.

Because we think you can get there by a number of

different routes.

disuniform regulations.

QUESTION:

10

Mr. Farr, do you think that your

11

theory means that Congress intended to set a ceiling on

12

the amount of information that consumers would receive

13

from the manufacturers?

14

MR. FARR:

I don't think Congress intended to

15

set a ceiling on the amount of information that consumers

16

would receive.

17

to set a regulatory structure, in other words, a structure

18

in which the Federal Government would set the requirements

for what the companies had to do.
QUESTION:

21

I think what Congress intended to do was

The lower limit of a requirement so

that additional warnings are appropriate perhaps?
MR. FARR:

22

Well, what Congress did in the area

of warnings, I believe, Justice O'Connor, is to say the

companies have to provide this particular warning on their

packaging.

QUESTION:

MR. FARR:

That is the both the minimum and the

maximum that they are required to put on their package.

In other words, as far as requirements go, it is a floor

and a ceiling.

Congress did not leave open --

QUESTION:

Are they prohibited from adding

additional warnings on their packages, in your view, by

8

that language?

10

MR. FARR:

Assuming they're not required to do

so by State law, but are simply acting on their own?

11

QUESTION:

Well, we can get to both.

12

MR. FARR:

Well, I ask the question because I

13

think there is a distinction.

14

QUESTION:

Without regard to State law, is the

15

manufacturer under the terms of the act free to add

16

additional warnings?

17

MR. FARR:

I do not read the act as specifically

18

prohibiting a manufacturer from putting additional

19

warnings on a package.

20

QUESTION:

However - -

All right, then do you think that

21

it's open to a State, through its tort law, to establish a

22

duty to provide additional warnings?

23

MR. FARR:

No, I do not.

That is the

24

distinction that I am drawing.

But there is a presumption, I guess,

that Congress didn't intend to disrupt State tort law.

4

MR. FARR:

Well, I think any case in which you

5

are examining preemption starts with that presumption.

6

But I think the next question is at what point is that

7

presumption properly overcome.

8

is that when Congress says in plain language in the act

9

that States may not impose any other requirements within a

The position we would take

10

particular field, whether it happens to be labeling or

11

whether it is advertising and promotion, and indeed where

12

the structure of the act makes clear that Congress itself

13

is the one that wants to set the policies and set the

14

requirements for good reason, that that itself overcomes

15

any presumption against preemption.

16

QUESTION:

Well, in the Smokeless Tobacco Act,

17

Congress was pretty clear in indicating that it thought

18

State tort suits could continue.

19

MR. FARR:

But I think that, in fact, points out

20

the very clear difference between this situation and the

21

situation that you have in the Smokeless Act, and in fact,

22

in Silkwood and Goodyear Atomic, which were mentioned

23

earlier.

24
25

Our position is that when Congress preempts the
ability of the States to set substantive standards, the

1

natural conclusion is that Congress has also preempted any

2

ability on the part of the States to enforce those

3

standards, as I said before, by fines, by criminal

4

penalties, by suits for damages, by injunctions.

5

exception is where Congress makes clear in the act that

6

despite its preemption of the standards, it is willing to

7

tolerate some particular form of enforcement.

8

words, that it is willing to have its policies frustrated.

9

QUESTION:

The

In other

I was going to say, isn't the sort of

10

the limit of the obvious effectiveness of your argument,

11

though, in the fact that when you speak of Congress

12

establishing substantive standards, and as you did

13

earlier, standards of conduct, that simply leaves open the

14

question whether Congress is establishing substantive

15

standards for advertising and promotion or substantive

16

standards governing ultimate liability.

establishing substantive standards for advertising and

promotion.

disagree with you there.

Nobody would disagree.

Clearly, they're

I assume nobody would

But it seems to me that the closest you've come

21

so far to an argument that those substantive standards go

22

beyond advertising and promotion to the questions of

selling cigarettes is in the remark that you made earlier

broad rather than a narrow reading.
Is your best argument for that reading of

4

Congress' clarification the language of the 1 6

amendments or can you point to some kind of an explicit

6

statement in legislative history in which somebody says,

we're taking the broad view by using this new language?
MR. FARR:

8

Souter.

Well, I think there is both, Justice

I think what Congress was dealing with, frankly

10

throughout, from 1 65 on, was the variety of different

11

means of regulation, a variety of different efforts at

12

both the State and the Federal level to impose

13

restrictions on cigarette companies.

14

Congress did was to say quite explicitly, certainly in

imposing requirements or prohibitions in this area.

that Congress does not want a State, for example, to

at the very minimum, is what Congress had in mind.

If a State can

altogether, or we'll ban advertising that doesn't carry a

2

warning, or we will say that any advertising even if it

does carry a warning, but shows attractive subjects,

pleasant settings, is misleading because it suggests that

5

smoking and health are compatible and we as a State have

6

made the judgment that they are not.

7

In all of those situations, it seems to me,

8

Congress is saying this is not something we want the

9

States to be free to do.

If such action is necessary, we

10

will take it.

11

to finish the answer -- in 1969, of course, Congress

12

stepped in and did ban some advertising, with respect to

broadcast advertising.

And of course, in 1969 -- excuse me, just

QUESTION:

Now your argument would also be

would be consistent with the text of the '69 amendment if

MR. FARR:

Well, it depends on what the aim of

the particular law is.

Again, we're not suggesting that

all tort suits are preempted.

that tort suits based, for example, on fairly common

respects.

They fight bronchial asthma germs or something
And there's no evidence for this, this is

MR. FARR:

If the question is could a State

regulate that or provide a tort suit based on that, our

10

answer is no, that that is something that is corrected at

11

the Federal level, and clearly would be corrected by the

12

FTC.

They would be down on the cigarette companies in a

QUESTION:

But if they didn't -- if the FTC

16

chose not to move, there could be no tort remedy under

17

general misrepresentation, fraud, or anything else.

18

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

19

QUESTION:

The entire field of fraud, deceit?

20

MR. FARR:

Well, let me explain why that is

21

true.

22

to decide where the lines begin and end.

23

that if Congress was confident that it could say we will

24

allow some State requirements, as long as those

25

requirements only go to the most egregious examples of

But that, I think, is simply an impractical way to look at
the system.

That once you say to the States we are going

to allow you to apply your standards in this field,
whether it's to intentional misrepresentation to whatever
an adequate warning would be, at that point, you
essentially cannot have national standards.

You can't

have both national standards and have 51 or more State
standards.
QUESTION:

about the limitation requirement or prohibition, what
constitutes a requirement of prohibition.

But it also

And maybe what Congress

that is that the prohibition has to be one that

is rather narrowly focused.

And a general fraud or deceit

prohibition is not a prohibition based on smoking and
health.

You're not allowed to lie.

We don't care whether

you do it about the benefits of - - the health benefits of
cigarette or anything else, you're just not allowed to
lie.
MR. FARR:

But if that were true, Justice

Scalia, then the State could have a general standard that
says you

have to give adequate warnings about products

that you

sell in this State, and say, we're not saying

that you -- we're not applying a specific standard to

2

cigarettes, we're just applying our general standard to

3

your warning.

QUESTION:

4
5

That's right.

That's exactly your

opponent's argument.
MR. FARR:

6

1

And it's not adequate.

Well, the problem is it doesn't make

7

any sense.

8

Congress was essentially playing a guessing game here.

9

What Congress said was if you are indiscreet enough to

That -- there is no reason to think that

10

pass a specific statute or apply, or to have a law that is

11

specific with regard to cigarettes, and that requires a

12

different warning, or that prohibits something in

13

advertising, that's perfectly all right with us, even

14

though it will have exactly the same effect on the

15

national policies and all of that, we're willing to

16

tolerate that.

17

willing to tolerate that.

18

But, if in fact -- excuse me, we're not

But if you have a general prohibition and then

19

apply it specifically to cigarettes to say this warning is

20

not good enough, this kind of advertising can't be allowed

21

in our State, that's perfectly acceptable to us.

22

effect of both of them is exactly the same.

23

Let me take an example.

The

If a State has a

24

statute that says we do not permit deceptive or misleading

25

advertising in this State, and we have an agency that is

(800) FOR DEPO

set up to administer this statute.

And it will review

your advertising to determine whether it is permitted or
not.

And that agency then determines that any advertising

by a cigarette company is inherently misleading unless it
just has the name of the cigarette.
There is no reason to think that so long as the
agency is acting that way and not -- or by a specific
adjudication, that it would make any difference.

And yet

one would be more general, one would be more specific, and
the overall statute could be quite general.
effect, ultimately, is the same.

But the

What the State is saying

is, in our State, you have to meet these standards of
conduct, and that is essentially the price that you have
to pay to market in our State.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Farr, suppose the State

just passes a law and says no one may bring into the State
any product that's determined by a commission to be
dangerous to the public health.

And it is decided that a

whole list of products including cigarettes are dangerous
to the public health.

And here a cigarette company brings

in some cigarettes in violation, and it is -- and they say
well, this is -- you're just wrong.

We're not, this

product isn't dangerous to public health.

Do you think that's preemptive?

Well, they lose

MR. FARR:
talking about.

Not under the analysis that I am

Now, but I want to be clear.

QUESTION:

I know.

So that would just be an

ordinary tort suit that says, look, you've brought in a
dangerous product and you've hurt somebody, and you're
going to have to pay.

We don't care what -- we're not

saying anything about advertising, warnings or anything
else.

Here is just a dangerous instrumentality.
MR. FARR:

But this is the point --

QUESTION:

Was that kind of a suit preempted?

MR. FARR:

If - - let me give the answer that

says it is not preempted under the analysis that I am
talking about.

There is an argument to be made under this

statute which is not part of the argument that we're
making with respect to these claims, that Congress
expected cigarettes could be sold lawfully in the State.
But that is a completely different analysis from the
analysis that I'm making, starting with the preemption
provisions in 1334(b).
What they relate to are labeling, advertising,
and promotion.

Now the example that you've given, Justice

White, simply does not fit within that field, so - QUESTION:

But you think the particular

litigation that's involved here is in the field of
information.

1

MR. FARR:

Absolutely.

2

QUESTION:

All of the causes of action.

3

MR. FARR:

This in fact goes back, I think, to

4

the question that Justice Scalia asked about what do the

5

words "based on" mean.

6

clearly is based on some relationship between smoking and

7

health.

8

You misrepresented the relationship between smoking and

9

health.

10

1

Every claim in this case quite

You did not warn enough about smoking and health.

QUESTION:

It's a good argument.

And it's based

11

on the essentially inane consequences that ensue if you

12

say the States can do through court decisions what they

13

couldn't do through regulations.

14

that's sort of an absurd way to read the statute.

What you're saying is

15

MR. FARR:

It is not --

16

QUESTION:

Except you have, you know, the

17

Smokeless Tobacco Act, which clearly produces exactly such

18

an absurd result, doesn't it?

QUESTION:

So maybe it's not such an absurd

result.

(Laughter.)

MR. FARR:

It is not -- what I think would be

more absurd, to borrow that word, would be to attribute

1

that to Congress where Congress has given no other

2

indication in the statute.

3

Silkwood, says explicitly in the act, there will be tort

4

suits -- I mean, that's the necessary implication of the

5

provision that was being construed in Silkwood, which set

6

a limit on the damages for tort suits.

7

Atomic, Congress says explicitly, workman's compensation

8

laws will apply exactly the same to Federal facilities

If Congress, as it did in

Or in Goodyear

within states as they do to any other facility.

The

10

Smokeless Tobacco Act, again, you have an explicit

11

provision.

12

So at that point it is entirely legitimate, it

13

seems to me, for the Court to say Congress is willing to

14

accept the tension between some regulation and the effort

15

to set uniform national standards or to protect Federal

16

facilities or whatever the Federal goal is but not --

17

QUESTION:

You still haven't quite got around to

18

explaining why Congress would want to occupy the field and

1

not ever have a remedy or provide a remedy for injury

20

caused by a dangerous product.

21

MR. FARR:

Justice White, let me - - you see, I

22

think there's a little bit of a misconception about the

23

relationship between the remedies and the standards.

24
25

QUESTION:

There's a remedy before the FTC to

correct misleading advertising and things like that.

But

1

you're not going to recover any money.
MR. FARR:

2

But there's more than that.

Let me

3

set out, if I can -- excuse me.

4

what I think is the landscape as far as remedies are

5

concerned.

6

remedies based on State requirements.

7

Congress, we say, has shut down.

8

within the field of labeling, advertising, and promotion,

9

what the companies can and cannot say.

10

Let me set out if I can

What Congress has clearly prohibited are
That is what

State requirements

However, that doesn't exhaust the field, to

11

begin with.

12

brought connected with smoking which are outside the field

13

entirely, as I've indicated before.

14

plaintiffs are saying there is not a remedy here, when

15

they are saying, for example, there is not a remedy for

16

failure to warn, what they're really saying is there is

17

not a failure for not -- there is not a remedy for not

18

giving a greater warning than the warning that Congress

19

required and said was the only warning that you could be

20

required to give.

21

There are other types of suits that can be

So when the

In the misrepresentation field, for example, to

22

the extent that the claims are based, as they typically

23

are, on standard product advertising, that again is

24

specifically an area in which the Congress did not want

25

the States to be able to set requirements.

So the fact

1

that one would say you have engaged, in our view, in

2

misleading advertising within our State because you have

3

shown, as I say, attractive people in an ad, or an

4

attractive setting, the fact that you cannot bring a claim

5

for that and get a remedy any more than an agency could

6

fine you for doing the same thing is because Congress did

7

not intend the States to be able to do that.
QUESTION:

8

9

I suppose the fact perhaps is that in

order to get a tort remedy such as this, you're going to

10

get in -- to impose liability, you're going to have to say

11

something about the failure to warn or the

12

misrepresentation, or something like that.

13

go into court and say this product is dangerous.

14

You just can't

MR. FARR:

Not -- one could do that, but the

MR. FARR:

QUESTION:

So there is a remedy for whatever

with the specific Federal requirement about the warning on

QUESTION:

Mr. Farr,

scheme for at least this - - the cigarette company

The

1

difficulty -- the point that I want to make here at the

end is that when you were talking about the extreme

hypothetical, the one, obviously, that causes anybody

I think it would -- I mean, I don't

know whether that would ultimately be a deceptive act or

19

not.
QUESTION:

20
21

But unless it's deceptive, the FTC

wouldn't be able to do anything about it?
MR. FARR:

22

Well, if it is the kind of deception

23

on which you could base a State tort claim, I am quite

24

confident that the FTC would have jurisdiction to handle

it.
