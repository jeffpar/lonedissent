ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN H. ANDREWS, III

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ANDREWS:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The issue in this case is whether, in a capital

11

case, a defendant's right to an impartial jury requires a

12

trial court to inquire of potential jurors whether, if the

13

defendant is convicted of murder, they would automatically

14

impose a sentence of death at a subsequent sentencing

15

hearing.

16

The issue in this case arose at Mr. Morgan's

17

trial.

18

jurors, would you impose -- if you convict Derrick Morgan

19

of murder, would you impose a sentence of death no matter

what the facts are.

substantially similar form at some earlier time, but he

had not.

25

death penalty upon Mr. Morgan.

The defendant asked the trial court to ask the

approximately 17 jurors were excused because they could

2

not sentence Mr. Morgan to death, or they said they could

3

not.

4

Mr. Morgan was convicted by the jury of murder,

5

and he was subsequently sentenced to death by that jury.

6

The Illinois supreme court affirmed both the conviction

7

and the death sentence.

8

there was no requirement to reverse Witherspoon in the

9

jury, in other words, to ask whether the jurors would

On this issue, it ruled that

15

It also held that because Mr. Morgan

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee a defendant

Is that question -- would that

24

to weigh mitigating and aggravating circumstances?

did not discuss weighing --

QUESTION:

It

So, in short, it does cover

that -- it does mean would you disobey your instructions.

5

MR. ANDREWS:

Actually, it definitely does mean

6

would you disobey the instructions.

7

defense was trying to find, was to discover whether jurors

8

were being seated who could not follow the law.

9

indeed, that is the only thing that they wanted.
QUESTION:

10

That is all that the

And

Well, let's assume they said, and

11

satisfied the court, yeah, we'll obey our instructions.

12

But then at the end of the weighing, there's all

13

these -- still an area of discretion, isn't there?

14

MR. ANDREWS:
discretion.

20

There's a tremendous amount of

QUESTION:

But the question wasn't just narrowed

to that.
MR. ANDREWS:

The question was not narrowed as

to whether they could weigh aggravation or mitigation.
QUESTION:

Or it wasn't narrowed to whether

21

where you have discretion, whether you would always vote

22

for the death penalty?

23

MR. ANDREWS:

No, it wasn't.

It was even

24

narrower than any of that.

25

always impose death, no matter what type of sentencing

It was whether you would

2

probably would have been allowed by decisions subsequent.
QUESTION:

3

It was not even as broad as

Well, I know, but if somebody, any

4

juror who said, I won't obey my instructions, is going to

5

be thrown off, isn't he?

that.

He's not going to answer yes to

No, he's not going to say that he

9

There's a tremendous

And for that reason, these general

10

questions about whether or not you would obey the law, or

11

whether you can be fair, are not adequate to reveal

12

whether somebody would automatically impose the death

13

penalty.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Andrews, why do you say it

15

amounts to violating your instructions?

16

the instructions are, you know, given your assessment of

17

what is mitigating, you should let him off.

18

juror says, hey, I am really - - I am a hard nose, and I

19

would not allow any mitigation for this kind of - - why is

20

that disobeying the instruction?

disobeying the instruction, is it?

outweighs aggravation.

2

mitigation will never outweigh the aggravation.

3

believe that death should automatically be imposed, so

4

therefore they will never find enough mitigation to

5

preclude the imposition of the death penalty.
QUESTION:

6

Well, to jurors such as these, the
They

And it's your position that there's

7

nothing in these instructions that the State can point to

8

to counter the effect that you fear.

9

MR. ANDREWS:

No, there is absolutely nothing in

10

the instructions, because that is precisely what they are

11

told, that they have that discretion, and it is pure

12

weighing.

13

has said that there is no burden of proof upon the State,

14

so they can do whatever they want, as long as they weigh

15

the mitigation.

16

And there is no -- the Illinois supreme court

And even if --

QUESTION:

Is a part of your submission,

17

Mr. Andrews, kind of sauce for the goose, sauce for the

18

gander, that since the State is entitled to ask

19

Witherspoon/Witt types of questions to jurors to see if

20

they would ever impose the death penalty, you should be

21

able to ask similar questions kind of pointing in the

22

other direction?

23

MR. ANDREWS:

That is part of our argument.

We

24

don't demand absolute equality, but in an issue of this

25

importance, where the State is allowed to exclude, as in

1

this case, perhaps 17 people, we do think that fundamental

2

fairness requires that we should be able to discover the

3

opposite type of jurors, those jurors who would always

4

impose death.

5
6

QUESTION:

Well, would your position be the same

if the Witherspoon question was not asked?

7

MR. ANDREWS:

I believe that even if the State

8

does not Witherspoon, the defendant's interest in

9

obtaining an impartial jury is so significant that he

10

should, at his request, be entitled to have the judge

11

inquire of these jurors whether they would automatically

12

impose death.

13

If for some reason the State decides that they

14

do not care whether there are anti-death penalty people on

15

the jury, their decision should in no way force a

16

defendant to perhaps be tried by a jury composed of people

17

who would automatically impose death upon him.

18

QUESTION:

Would you say you're entitled to have

19

a question asked of jurors, do you favor the death

20

penalty?

21

penalty in any case, or not?

22

Would you lean towards imposing the death

MR. ANDREWS:

No, Your Honor, we merely want a

23

question that would reveal whether they could, you know,

24

consider the mitigation and follow what the Constitution

25

requires, and not be automatic death penalty jurors.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Andrews, you mentioned

2

fundamental fairness.

That's sort of a due process

3

standard, but you're also relying on the Sixth Amendment,

4

aren't you?

5

MR. ANDREWS:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

How can you rely - - I thought we've

7

held, I know we've held, that the Sixth Amendment does not

8

apply to - - that there is no Sixth Amendment right to a

9

jury in the penalty phase of a trial.
MR. ANDREWS:

10

Well, when there is a jury in the

11

penalty phase in the trial, when the trier of fact in the

12

penalty phase has to be impartial, and -QUESTION:

13
14

Well, that's a due process claim,

though, not a Sixth Amendment claim.
MR. ANDREWS:

15

Even though there is no right to a

16

jury, it seems to me that when the State gives you the

17

right to a jury, that the jury has to be impartial, as

18

required.

19

QUESTION:

Well, again, that's, it seems to me,

20

a due process assertion.

21

Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury when there is

22

no Sixth Amendment right to a jury.

23

MR. ANDREWS:

I don't see how you can get to a

Well, this Court has specifically

24

held in Turner v. Murray that the Sixth Amendment applies.

Amendment application to the sentencing hearing.

Now, the risk -- there's a great risk that these

people will serve if this inquiry isn't made.

Now, the

13

cases of Ross v. Oklahoma and Mu'Min v. Virginia,

14

automatic death penalty jurors appeared in there.

15

are a large number of State cases where these people

appear.

MR. ANDREWS:

1

Well, the defendant has a right to

present mitigation.

Now, to effectuate that right, he has

3

to be able to present it to jurors who will pay attention

to it.

Otherwise, it's an absolutely meaningless right.

Why is that?

Were you trial counsel?
No, I was not.

Have you tried death cases?
No death murder cases, Your Honor.

How often would you predict that some

juror is going to answer yes to your question?
MR. ANDREWS:

I would have no way of predicting.

the question wasn't asked.

You speak about these people as

MR. ANDREWS:

I honestly couldn't tell you how

15

large a group of people there are.

16

perhaps as the death penalty becomes increasingly popular

17

that they would become more common.

18

defendant's right to preserve his life is pretty well

ruined when such an individual serves on the jury.

20

whether there are a lot or a few, the question is whether

21

can -- will some of them possibly be seated?

22

definitely will, and that is what all of these cases show.

So it's not necessarily a question of how many there are,

of the importance of this issue to the defendant's right

would require all State trial judges in capital cases to

2

One juror, Benjamin Dexter's, views were extreme, and he

QUESTION:

The trial judge's questions

May I ask, on that juror, I gather

6

he's the one that said he would automatically impose the

7

death penalty if there were a conviction of first degree

8

murder?

9

MR. GILLIS:

Well, he related, too, that a

10

friend's parents had been murdered, and he speaks somewhat

11

inaccurately, but I would say a fair reading of that is

12

that he would either put that person to death or perhaps

13

he was referring to the petitioner in this case.

14

QUESTION:

The question I wanted to ask you is

15

supposing the juror, it comes out during the colloquy,

16

that he believed in the eye for an eye and a tooth for a

tooth, and that if there were ever a conviction for first

degree murder, he thought that nothing less than the death

penalty should be imposed.

How then do you explain Ross?
In Ross v. Oklahoma, that juror did

not sit, but a peremptory challenge was used.
QUESTION:

Well, but I thought the Court made it

15

very clear that if that juror had been seated, that a

16

reversal would have been required under the Sixth and

17

Fourteenth Amendments.

18

MR. GILLIS:

Well, I think that in Ross the

19

question was the whole make-up of the jury, whether the

20

jury was impartial, a kind of a factual inquiry about the

21

impartiality of that juror.

22

Take -- Darrell Huling in that case did not sit,

23

but as I recall, a peremptory had to be used and the Court

held that that upset the fairness of the mechanism in so

far as the jury selection.

Why was it a proper challenge

dire, the introductory remarks, and the juror's oath that

he swears to follow the law and apply the lg.w to the

19

facts, and then the instructions, which, in this case,

20

narrowed the discretion, that still there is discretion,

21

but it's vastly narrowed from the situation.

22

QUESTION:

Well, can you point to anything

23

specific in the instructions that it would advise a juror

that it is his duty not to impose the death penalty

automatically?

is that this juror says, I don't think there are ever

they can find mitigation.

3

they just do not believe in this facts -- in this case

4

that there amounts to mitigation, then I think the juror's

you're right, that nothing in particular points

out -- nothing in voir dire points out these decisions

which will come later.

If a person is so made up that

Although the judge did a thorough

job of explaining that first there'd be a finding of

guilt, innocence, and then there'd be a finding of

11

eligibility, and then there would be a finding about

aggravation and mitigation.

of the juror's answers mirrored the fact that he

14

recognized that decisions would be made later on down the

15

line, of which they did not know the facts at that point.

So the jurors knew, and one

this, but I'm assuming a question whether the juror would

in all cases vote in favor of the death penalty in all

cases of first degree murder because that was his

conviction.

challenges have been exhausted, say the interrogation of

Amendment that that situation would cry out for relief.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN H. ANDREWS, III

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

3

MR. ANDREWS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

4

Very briefly, in response to the question about

5

whether the State has a right to inquire of these people

6

whether they could indeed impose a death penalty, in

7

Lockhart v. McCree, this Court said that if these jurors

8

could not make a guilt/innocence decision because of their

9

feelings on the death penalty, ipso facto the State is

10

entitled to inquire as to whether or not they are

11

automatically against the death penalty.

12

we're saying here.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

And that's all

Was that dicta, do you suppose, in

that case?
MR. ANDREWS:

It conceivably could have been,

16

but it is very persuasive, it makes sense.

17

to quibble with the State's right to exclude these jurors

18

who can't follow the law.

19

that indeed if they can't follow the law, they shouldn't

20

be on the jury.

21

22

23

We're not here

And it fits with our position

Now, the State also talked about the mechanisms
were in place - QUESTION:

The State's complaint in Witherspoon

24

was not that the juror would never impose the death

25

penalty at the penalty stage.

It was rather that a jury

1

who was that much opposed to the death penalty would not

2

convict, right?

3

Now, the defect that you claim in this case

4

would not produce a juror who would come out the wrong way

5

on the guilt phase, would it?

6

MR. ANDREWS:

7

QUESTION:

8

about that?

9

11

Well, tell me, is the State wrong

Why would a person who --

MR. ANDREWS:

10

Not according to the State, no.

No, this Court has said that --

Am I going to convict somebody just

so I can impose the death penalty on somebody?

MR. ANDREWS:

That is only part of the

they can't deliberate on any phase, you ipso facto get to

ask the question to reveal that.

you get to ask the question, not what phase it is.

But what is important is that when

In any event, it is that

to the State, look, I'd always impose a death penalty.
