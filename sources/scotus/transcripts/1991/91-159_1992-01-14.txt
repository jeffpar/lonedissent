ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. ARLAND

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ARLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We're here today on a petition for writ of

certiorari from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals for

12

Johnson v. Barnhill.

13

intent of Congress and to promulgate the policies -- the

14

public policies espoused by Congress in the bankruptcy

15

laws, to promote unity of the law, equal distribution

16

among creditors of equal priority of the property of the

17

estate of the debtor, and to in fact bring the preference

18

provisions of the Bankruptcy Code into conformity with

19

modern commercial practices and the Uniform Commercial

20

Code.

21

The purpose today is to uphold the

22

at this time is section 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

24

25

trustee may set aside transfers made by a debtor to its

creditors.

November 20, Justice Blackmun, is

the final date here, yes.

16

QUESTION:

Well, does your response to Justice

17

Blackmun -- is it based partly on 547(c) as well as

18

547(b)?

19

MR. ARLAND:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, it's not

20

based on 547(c) itself.

21

was merely centered upon the effect of giving a post-dated

22

check in a transaction, the difference being, I believe,

23

when a check is considered a credit transaction and when a

24

check is considered a cash transaction.

25

My response to Justice Blackmun

Inasmuch as the post-dating was only one date,

1

and that date, the November 19, was still outside the

2

preference window, the date of the check being outside the

3

preference window, it became a cash transaction on

4

November 19, and so it had no application with respect to

5

a credit transaction that would have fallen within the

6

preference period.

7

QUESTION:

Is your answer based in part on the

8

fact that the hypothesis of a 1-month post-dating would

9

have brought the date written on the check within the

10
11

preference period?
MR. ARLAND:

Yes, it would, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

That would be the position, and I believe in that instance

13

that in fact the transaction would have fallen

14

within -- if it was -- quite frankly, according to the

15

Uniform Commercial Code, had the post-dating exceeded 30

16

days, which I believe section 350-3 of the Uniform

17

Commercial Code provides that if a check is presented for

18

honor within 30 days of its date of delivery, then it is

19

essentially considered a reasonable period of time and

20

essentially is a cash transaction.

21

If it exceeds the reasonable time of 30 days,

22

then in fact the transaction date is the date the check is

23

honored, so that if the day that Justice Blackmun was

24

referring to were 31 days or greater -- the presentment

25

date was 31 days or greater than the date of the check,

1

then by all means it was a credit transaction and the

2

transaction would have fallen within the preference period

3

as long as the honoring was done 31 days after the date of

4

the check.

5

QUESTION:

Would the same be true if a check

6

were given as sort of a security deposit not to be cashed

7

until certain events occurred, or unless certain events

8

occurred?
MR. ARLAND:

9

In any -- if -- I believe, Justice

10

O'Connor, speaking specifically about 547(c), in which it

11

is as surety for it, I believe that it would be.

12

answer your question directly, yes, I think it would be.

It would be a credit transaction

delivery of it?

2

You say that the --

MR. ARLAND:

Justice Scalia, the two issues that

3

are raised are, one, the reasonable period of time from

4

presentment for honor from date of the check is 30 days.

5

The second part is that if the check is presented or

6

honored subsequent to the 30 days, is that the date of

7

honoring?
I am - - my interpretation and understanding of

8

9
10

the code is that the answer to the first question is
30 days is reasonable.
QUESTION:

11
12

30 days from the date -- the date on

the check.

13
14

I am not certain --

MR. ARLAND:

30 days from the date on the

check is reasonable.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ARLAND:

Right, that's what I understand.
Subsequent to the 30 days if it is

17

presented for honor that is not reasonable, and that is

18

considered the day of the transaction at that point in

19

time.
QUESTION:

20

Right, but it doesn't matter for that

21

purpose when the check is actually handed over.

22

you a check now that's dated 30 days from now, that

23

becomes a cash transaction 30 days from now, does it not?

24
25

MR. ARLAND:
does.

If I give

Yes, it does, Justice Scalia -- it

It becomes a cash transaction at the time that the

2

check can be honored and is presented at that time.
To that extent, if one presents a -- does not

3

present a check within that 30-day period, then the

4

Uniform Commercial Code I believe tells us that in fact

5

that is not substantially a cash transaction, because the

6

giving of a check is a conditional transfer as defined

7

under 101, section either 48 or 54 of the Bankruptcy Code.

The condition is, is that it will be presented
within a reasonable period of time, and that upon

10

presentment it will be honored.

11

12

QUESTION:

Then it relates back to

If you post-date the check there are

13

two conditions.

14

and the second is that it be presented, and it becomes a

15

cash transaction when the first condition is met, and then

still subject to the subsequent presentation.

One is that the later date come about,

I would agree with you, Justice

Scalia, only in the instance where the post-dating of the

QUESTION:

May I just ask a little different

4

question on post-dating?

5

bankruptcy a post-dated check was delivered dated 7 days

6

later, just not a -- forget the 30-day problem, just think

7

about a 7-day problem for a moment.

8

date of delivery or the date of the check is the critical

9

date?
MR. ARLAND:

10

Supposing that 93 days before

Would you say the

I would -- Justice Stevens, I think

11

that in that instance the date of the check is the

12

critical date.

13

QUESTION:

So the date of delivery rule for

14

which you're arguing is one -- the date of delivery or

15

date of the check, whichever is later.

16

MR. ARLAND:

Yes, Justice Stevens, whichever is

17

later.

18

commercial system is devised, until the date on the check

19

arrives one has no claim to the funds that underlie the

20

validity of that check, and therefore the date on the

21

check, if it is beyond the date of delivery, must

22

control - - must control.

23

I think as a practical matter, the way our

547(b) is -- as I say, it doesn't define a date

24

of delivery or a date of honor rule for us, and in fact to

25

the extent that we can look solely to 547(b) to tell us

1

whether date of delivery or date of honor rules should

2

apply, it doesn't do that.

3

However, we know that the Bankruptcy Code itself

4

is a great statutory scheme, and we can look within the

5

code when sections of the code do not provide us with a

6

clear-cut answer.

7

transfer is, and I think that is where we have to begin.

8

9

Section 101(48) and (54) defines what a

It in fact shows that a transfer is any mode of
transaction or a transaction of transfer whether it is

10

absolute, whether it is conditional -- it is a very broad

11

definition.

A check is certainly a conditional

12

conveyance.

It is a conditional transfer.

13

QUESTION:

What is conveyed?

The principal

14

point your opponent makes is it has to be transfer of

15

property of the debtor.

16

being transferred?

17

MR. ARLAND:

What property of the debtor is

I believe, Justice Scalia, that the

18

definition under 101(48) says the transfer of an interest

19

of a debtor in property, as opposed to the transfer of

20

interest to property.

21

The interest that's being transferred between

22

the debtor and the creditor - - and those terms only apply

23

if the payor on the check subsequently files for

24

bankruptcy -- is that the payor on the check is

25

representing by giving this check on the date on the check

1

that there are sufficient funds in his account to cover

2

that check.

3

There is an underlying principle of good faith

4

under the Uniform Commercial Code which is specifically

5

applicable to this case that I as payor of the check am

6

representing that those funds are in my bank.

7

QUESTION:

But a representation by the payor is

8

not a transfer of an interest, it's just a representation,

9

and in fact UCC says, as I understand it - - correct me if

10

I'm wrong -- that the check does not operate as an

11

assignment of the funds.

12

13
14

MR. ARLAND:

We are not talking about an

assignment of the funds, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

Well, the question is what interest

15

in property is transferred, and your answer to Justice

16

Scalia was that there is a representation made that funds

17

are in the bank, but that doesn't sound to me like a

18

transfer of any property.

QUESTION:

It becomes perfected when the

Justice Scalia, that is correct -And that's why the Bankruptcy Code

talks about perfection.
MR. ARLAND:

10

At 547(e), Justice Scalia, is where

11

the Bankruptcy Code directs its attention to perfection.

12

It has largely been held by most courts that that section

13

applies solely to real property interest in mortgages and

14

the relation-back doctrine is clearly stated in 547(a)

15

to (b) .

16

QUESTION:

Well, 547 also talks about a

17

substantially contemporaneous transfer, which I take it at

18

least can be interpreted as the attempt of the Bankruptcy

19

Code to accommodate this delay between the time the check

20

is given and the time that it is honored, and that

21

language has the effect of showing that even if you wait

22

till the time that it's honored it's substantially

23

contemporaneous.

MR. ARLAND:

Yes, 547(c) adopts that, Justice

Kennedy, that's correct, and for the purposes of (c)(1)

1

and (c)(2) this furthers --we want to have a

2

substantially contemporaneous exchange or a cash

3

transaction represented by a check because the purpose of

547(c), the exceptions to 547(b), is to promote vendors

into bankruptcy.

on having nobody do business with this individual.
QUESTION:

9

We don't want to have a chilling effect

But 547(c) deals with the normal

course of business, doesn't it?

10

MR. ARLAND:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, it does, Mr. Chief Justice.
So how you would treat a check under

12

the normal course of business section might not be

13

determined, I would think, for 547(b) purposes.

14

MR. ARLAND:

That is certainly the position of

15

the trustee in this case, and I would submit to the Court

16

that to serve the purpose of the uniformity of the law as

17

espoused in McKenzie v. Irving Trust, that in fact it

18

makes no sense and it is illogical to have two different

19

dates apply within the same section or subsection of the

20

Bankruptcy Code.

As a matter of fact --

QUESTION:

21

If you're talking about two different

course of business, but I don't see why it would be

2

illogical to say a somewhat different test might apply in

3

determining whether there's a transfer.

4

MR. ARLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, if in fact the

5

date of honor rule were to satisfy an equality of

6

distribution among creditors, which in fact 547(b) is

7

designed to do, then I could not quarrel with you.

8

However, I can show this Court by a hypothetical example

9

that a date of honor rule does not treat creditors

10

equally.
If we will assume for a moment that a check is

11
12

delivered to two creditors dated on the same day which is

13

outside the preference window, one of the creditors is an

14

in-State or even an in-town creditor, the other is

15

out-of-State.

16

The in-State creditor receives the check on a

17

given date outside the preference period, deposits it the

18

next day as in this case, and the check is honored on that

19

day.

20

outside the preference period.

21

The date of honoring in that instance is clearly

However, the out-of-State creditor, by virtue of

22

his location, is not quite as fortunate.

He must take

23

that check, deposit it in his bank, usually wait a 3- to

24

10-day clearing period on the check before it's then

25

presented to the in-State bank.

If during that period of

out-of-State check falls within the preferential transfer

period, we have not satisfied through the date of honor

I would think when you talk about

They are of equal

If we assume, and we must assume for the

15

purposes of the argument and the hypothetical, that they

16

are of the same class -- that is, they will be treated as

17

in the same class under 1129 for the purposes of a plan,

18

which is what we are attempting to resolve, it seems to me

19

that there is a clear distinction, Mr. Chief Justice, that

20

in fact they are between the treatment of two creditors of

equal priority, just because one happens to be located out

Ms. Cusack,

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:
As Mr. Arland has already indicated, this case

10
11

revolves around an attempt by a bankruptcy trustee to

12

recover money as a voidable preference under section

13

547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

14

The check which is at the center of this

15

controversy is a check which was post-dated.

16

and delivered prior to the 90-day preference period but in

17

fact was honored on the 90th day, prior to the bankruptcy

18

filing.

19

It was dated

It is in this context that the Court must decide

20

whether, for purposes of 547(b), it is the date of honor

21

or the date of delivery which controls, and in making that

22

decision whether or not the bankruptcy court acted

23

properly in dismissing our lawsuit, which had initially

been filed --

depleting the account and rendering that check absolutely

in this specific instance what we're doing is attempting

to recover the money, and with respect to money you cannot

I think our position in that

instance would be different if he could enforce it against
the bank, but in fact he cannot.

11

As I indicated previously, Congress has

12

constitutional authority to establish uniform laws and has

13

enacted that authority by enacting the Bankruptcy Code.

14

What is a transfer and when it is completed is necessarily

a Federal question because it does arise under the terms

of the Federal statute, which of course is intended --

QUESTION:

I thought a minute ago, Mrs. Cusack,

18

you told Justice White that that was a matter of State

MS. CUSACK:

The Federal question has not been

21

answered, and consequently in accordance with the McKenzie

22

case the Court has said that in the event that that

23

question is not answered pursuant to law, then it becomes

a matter of deference to the State.

QUESTION:

Ms. Cusack, do you take the position

8

that under New Mexico law when the check is delivered that

9

it does not at least conditionally transfer a chose in

10

action to the payee?

11

MS. CUSACK:

12

QUESTION:

No.
Would New Mexico recognize that it

13

conditionally transfers a chose in action to the payee

14

when the check is delivered?

15

MS. CUSACK:

What New Mexico recognizes is that

16

when a check is tendered there is a’conditional payment

17

and there is a doctrine of relation back that is in effect

18

in the State of New Mexico, and what New Mexico recognizes

19

is that that conditional payment is subject to the

20

condition of a transfer taking place.

QUESTION:

3

in the Bankruptcy Code 101 of what a transfer means, it

means every mode, absolute or conditional --or

conditional - - of disposing or parting with property or

6

with an interest in property.

7

delivery of a check does not meet that definition?

And when you look at the definition

MS. CUSACK:

Do you say that the

I think that the delivery of the

check comes within the definition of what a transfer is
under 101 --

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. CUSACK:

Under 101.
Because 101 is a very expansive

13

definition and it indicates, at least in my mind, that one

14

way that an individual can make a transfer of an interest

15

in property is indirectly through the delivery of the

16

check.

17

However, what's important for purposes of 547(b)

18

is making a determination in fact when the transfer takes

19

place so that the trustee knows and the other creditors

20

know what assets ultimately will be available for

21

distribution to those creditors and to the estate.

22

Under 547(b) the trustee is allowed to recover

as certain things have made - - so long as those transfers

have been made within 90 days and they have been payment

May I just question that, because

perhaps it's the same point Justice Scalia made, but I

want to be sure I understand your answer.

10

(e)(1)(b) contemplates -- it refers to transfers of

11

fixtures or property other than real property, and surely

12

contemplates that a transfer can occur before it has been

transfer will be perfected, and then in (e)(2) it says

15

it's perfected if it's within 10 days and another -- you

can't get another lien against the property.

Now, if the transfer date and the perfection

date are different, doesn't the date of honor establish

the perfection date and the date of delivery establish the

Why isn't that a correct analysis?

MS. CUSACK:

Okay, our contention is with

QUESTION:

No, but to the extent you say that

Yes, but that just means that it's

anything more than that the transfer is conditional.

QUESTION:

In fact,

Well, but for that proposition you

rely, as I understand it, on the position that the payee

10

MS. CUSACK:

That's right, the payee cannot

11

enforce it against the bank because again he has no right

to exercise any kind of dominion or control.

proposition that the payor may stop payment or may also

Absolutely, or that the funds may

90 days immediately preceding the bankruptcy.
If the trustee,

in doing that, and in doing his

3

preference screening, looks on the 90th day immediately

4

preceding the bankruptcy filing, looks to see what's in

5

the account, regardless of how many checks may be issued

6

and how many checks may be outstanding, the fact is that

7

as of that period in time it is the debtor who has control

8

over all of the funds which remain in the bank account.

9

Again, the issue of control and dominion over those funds

10
11

becomes material.
Mr. Arland has indicated that a date of delivery

12

rule will conform with modern commercial practice, and he

13

has indicated repeatedly that when a transaction is -- or

when a check is given the transaction stops.

2

obligation, but in fact only operates to suspend that

3

obligation and to suspend until it's determined whether or

4

not the check has paid the obligation which has to be

5

6

I think that under the terms of the date of

presented, because of the fact that the Bankruptcy Code

has consistently deferred certain matters to decisions

The fact that a determination of when a transfer

Mr. Arland, may I ask you one

question?

4

MR. ARLAND:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice.
Why isn't your position that there's

6

a conditional transfer here defeated by the fact that the

7

payee cannot enforce that transfer against the bank if

8

it's dishonored?

9

MR. ARLAND:

My position is that because the

10

nature of a check is that it is a conditional transfer,

11

and that it is recognized within the Uniform Commercial

12

Code and in the bankruptcy courts.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Then why can't it be enforced against

the bank?
MR. ARLAND:

Because the concept of how commerce

16

works and how banks honor checks does not permit it.

17

we have a dishonor of a check within the preference period

18

subsequent to delivery, you don't have a preference

19

action, there's no question of that, because there's

nothing - - nothing has changed hands.

4

There is a definite relation back doctrine that

QUESTION:

But isn't -- you say it's a relation

back, but doesn't the relation back occur only because the

check is an authorization to pay, and if the person

authorized accepts the authorization then the payment

subject to conditions you've mentioned relates back, but

it is not a chose in action in the sense that it can be
