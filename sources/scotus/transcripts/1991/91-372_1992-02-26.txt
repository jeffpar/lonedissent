ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRISON W. KOHLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KOHLER:

8

10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the

11

Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from

12

exercising his peremptory strikes in a racially

13

discriminatory manner.

14

facts of their case they have the right to use their

15

peremptory strikes to excuse black jurors under the

16

assumption that because these jurors are black they cannot

17

be impartial in this case.

18

agreed, and held that the Constitution did not prohibit

19

criminal defendants from racial discrimination in the

20

exercise of peremptory strikes.

21

Respondents assert that under the

The Georgia supreme court

The State of Georgia submits that the Georgia

22

supreme court is wrong.

This Court has stated clearly

23

that racial discrimination in the exercise of peremptory

24

strikes violates the equal protection rights of the

25

challenged jurors and harms the State's interest in

1

maintaining public confidence in the fairness of judicial

2

proceedings.

3

This Court has already held that prosecutors

4

cannot exercise their peremptory strikes in a racially

5

discriminatory manner.

6

plaintiffs nor defendants can do so.

7

should be similarly barred.

8

9

Civil litigants, neither
Criminal defendants

This Court has noted in a number of decisions
that peremptory strikes are not of constitutional origin.

10

They are creations of statute.

11

could summon jurors to the Court, conduct the voir dire to

12

determine which of those jurors were partial, exclude

13

those jurors, and require the State and the criminal

14

defendant to go to trial without any peremptory strikes.

15

I would submit that such a procedure would be

16

constitutional.

17

If Georgia so chose it

Instead, Georgia has chosen to delegate to the

18

criminal prosecutor and the criminal defendant significant

19

State power to determine the composition of the jury.

20

Under Georgia law in practically all felony trials 42

21

jurors are impaneled for jury service.

22

right to exclude 10 jurors with peremptory strikes.

23

Georgia has delegated to the criminal defendant power to

24

exclude 20 jurors -- almost 50 percent of the jury panel.

MR. KOHLER:

Your Honor, in all felonies where

3

the punishment is greater than 3 years, which includes

4

almost every felony in Georgia, it is 20 and 10.

5

Court has noted in Edmondson there is State action

6

throughout the jury selection process.

7

As this

In Georgia, county officials, jury commissioners

8

compose the jury list, the Clerk's Office of the Superior

9

Court sends out a summons directing the jurors to report

10

in the courtroom, bailiffs who are deputy sheriffs of the

11

Sheriff's Office escort the jurors to and from the

12

assembly room to the courtroom, in the courtroom jurors in

13

a criminal case are given up to three oaths - - these are

14

all by Georgia statute -- and the second oath that is

15

given to all 42 jurors on the panel is that they will

16

truthfully answer the questions propounded to them, and

17

then during the voir dire the judge requires that the jury

18

answer those questions that are propounded to them by the

19

attorneys in the case.

20

Once the voir dire has concluded, the peremptory

21

strikes are exercised.

After those strikes are exercised,

22

it is the judge that directs the 12 jurors remaining these

23

are the jurors you will serve in this case, you're

24

directed to enter the jury box, and the other jurors are

excused by the court generally to return to the jury

assembly room.
QUESTION:

So under Georgia law the attorneys

can each voir dire each one of the jurors.
MR. KOHLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

There is a

5

statutory right to individual voir dire of the jury.

6

the court does not have to sequester the other jurors

7

separately from that.

8

jurors in the box but there is a statutory right to

9

individual voir dire.

10

Now,

Generally the Court will empanel 12

Jury selection in Georgia does go fairly fast.

11

Not as quickly as the Federal courts, but in most cases a

12

jury will be empaneled in two or three hours, even -- with

13

the exception of a capital case.

14

Georgia's position that when a criminal defendant is

15

exercising this State delegated power to exclude jurors

16

from the jury, he is acting under color of State law.

17

This is a right created by statute, and although the State

18

may delegate this power to the defendant in the case, it

19

is the position of Georgia that the State may not license

20

the defendant to exercise these peremptory strikes in a

21

racially discriminatory manner.

22

of the State of Georgia that the attorney general has

23

standing to assert these equal protection rights on behalf

24

of the jurors.

holding in Polk County v. Dodson that public defenders do

2

not act under color of State law --

3

MR. KOHLER:

4

QUESTION:

5

Your Honor -When they're representing a criminal

defendant?
MR. KOHLER:

6

Justice O'Connor, my reading of

7

Polk County v. Dodson was that in the filing, or in that

8

case the not filing of the notice of appeal the public

9

defender was not acting under color of State law because

10

he was performing a private act on behalf of the

11

defendant.

12

It is our reading of Edmondson that when the

13

criminal defendant or counsel is exercising that

14

State-created power to exclude jurors, and the criminal

15

defense attorney excludes them on the basis of race alone,

16

that he is acting under color of State law.

17

asserting to the court that in every case defense counsel

18

is acting under color of State law, but only in the

19

exercise of the State-created power of peremptory strikes.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

We are not

Well, that results in a rather

peculiar distinction, don't you think?
MR. KOHLER:

Your Honor, I would -- no, because

23

I believe that what the State is asserting in this case is

24

consistent with what the majority opinion in Edmondson.

25

In that case, you had private litigants but this Court

5

QUESTION:

Well, of course, that wasn't my view,

but I recognize that's the holding of the Court.
MR. KOHLER:

Yes, ma'am, and we believe that the

6

majority opinion does support the State of Georgia's

7

position in this case.

8

9

QUESTION:

Do you think if counsel in a criminal

case excused a juror and the allegation was excusal was on

10

the basis of race that there'd be a 1983 suit that could

11

be brought against the counsel by the excluded jurors?

12

MR. KOHLER:

Justice Kennedy, in theory, yes.

13

As a practical matter, given the way jury selection works,

14

I think it would be highly unlikely, but in theory yes, I

15

believe the excluded juror would have the authority to

16

bring a 1983 action against the counsel.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Absent the creation of some sort of

privilege or immunity.
MR. KOHLER:

Correct, if there were within the

20

four corners of the courtroom that the defense counsel are

21

immune from any damages, of course, in that case, that

22

would prohibit it.

23

The attorney general is not representing a

24

private party in the criminal prosecution, but the State

has an interest in maintaining public confidence in

discrimination occurs in the exercise of peremptory-

QUESTION:

MR. KOHLER:

Well, that's certainly one of the

options that this Court - QUESTION:

I don't

17

know -- you think a 198 -- either way, it seems to me it

18

would be hard to bring a 1983 suit.

19

MR. KOHLER:

Well, Your Honor, I certainly

20

wasn't arguing for the practicality of it, and the

21

obstacles might be daunting.

22

out in Powers, the ability or the obstacles to a juror's

23

asserting his right is daunting, but yes, Your Honor, I

24

would believe that if there were a prima facie case of

25

racial discrimination, if the Court were to rule that the

1

Georgia supreme court was incorrect, that the Court could

2

require that defense counsel, just like he can the State,

3

give a neutral nonrace-based reason for the exclusion of

4

the black juror.

5

QUESTION:
has it?

7

MR. KOHLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

This trial here hasn't taken place,

No, Your Honor, it has not.
So that if you win the trial court

when it does try the case would, as Justice White suggests

10

I suppose, require that any challenge of a black juror by

11

a defendant just as by the State be supported by a reason

12

if the Batson test is met.
MR. KOHLER:

13

Yes, Your Honor, that is our

14

position exactly, that -- and again, the State has

15

operated under the principles of Batson since 1986, and it

16

has not prevented the State from empaneling impartial

17

juries.

18

I would submit that two things have resulted

19

from Batson from the prosecutorial point of view.

20

I think a practical fact, as a matter of fact more black

21

jurors serve on criminal juries.

22

One is

The second is - - I think a practical result is

23

that it has made prosecutors better at jury selection

24

because it has forced us to make an individualized

assessment of the jury as opposed to relying on some kind

of racial stereotype as to the ideal State's juror or the

2

ideal defendant's juror, so it's something that the

prosecutor is able to accept.

do the same, and it's the State of Georgia's position --

QUESTION:

Civil litigants now have to

Is there some feeling by prosecutors

that Batson has generally hurt the prosecution - -

7

MR. KOHLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KOHLER:

Your Honor, I -Or do you know?
I can't speak for myself.

I've

10

certainly talked with prosecutors about it.

11

think there are some of us that feel that it is not, that

12

as a matter of fact instead of making the assumption that

13

the ideal prosecution juror in my part of the country is a

14

white farmer who was in the Marine Corps, we would try to

15

look at the specific juror and try to make an

16

individualized assessment.

17

I certainly

And I think in hindsight I can look back on my

18

own jury selection in cases and I've tried a number of

19

them where I feel I probably did not do a good job, and

20

Batson has forced us to focus on what is significant in

21

the case, and that is try to make as best we can an

22

individualized assessment.

QUESTION:

Do you get any substantial number of

reversals on appeal because of claimed Batson violations?

No, Your Honor, I can think of one

case early.

2

would like to think that that's because we comply with

3

Batson.

4

law is, and we comply with it and therefore if we are in a

5

case and strike a black juror and the court says what's

6

your neutral reason then we give a neutral reason.

7
8

I don't recall that there are very many.

I

As a matter of fact, this is what you all say the

If not, there have been cases in Georgia, both
at least one in Federal court and one in State court, I
think, where the judge was not satisfied and put the juror

10

or jurors back on the jury.

11

but in those cases there was a conviction even though the

12

court at least as to some jurors did not accept the

13

neutral explanation.

14

QUESTION:

Now, that has happened, too,

Mr. Kohler, would you have any idea

15

of how frequently there are appeals on the basis of

16

disagreement with the reasons given and accepted by the

17

court for - - under the Batson inquiry?

18
1
20

MR. KOHLER:

There certainly -- it's not

unusual, and there certainly are appeals on that issue.
I would like to say my own experience -- and I'm

21

not up here saying to the Court that my experience is

22

statistically significant, but there are cases that you

23

try, interracial crimes, where there's no Batson

24

challenge, and simply because there is an interracial

25

crime does not necessarily mean that Batson will arise.

Your Honor, I would disagree with

not saying if a juror is in fact biased that he should

methods approved by the Court for determination of how to

QUESTION:

One is that the State is

I'm not talking about bias.

I'm just

10

talking about -- you give the defendant peremptories.

11

whole purpose of peremptories is that you don't have to

show bias.

You just think you'll get a fairer shake from a

jury if you just out of suspicion can strike a certain

number of people, and you're going to let the defendant

strike postmen, you're going to let him strike people

17

above a certain age, right -- all of those things not

18

because he knows that they're biased, but because he

19

thinks I think I'll get a better shake from an all-female

jury or an all-male jury, or a jury without postmen, or a

21

jury without ex-policemen, or whatever, right?

Except the one thing you can't do, even though

this is a - - you know, an allegedly racially motivated

24

crime, is use those peremptories with respect to people --

ability to assure a jury that he's satisfied what is fair.
MR. KOHLER:

2

Your Honor, I would simply

3

respectfully disagree, that the State of Georgia's

4

position that simply striking a juror under the assumption

5

that because a juror is of a particular race, whether

6

white or black, that that is not sufficient, that if

7

there's a prima facie case of racial discrimination,

8

neutral reasons should have to be given.
QUESTION:

9
10

Do you favor peremptories generally,

or - -

11

MR. KOHLER:

12

QUESTION:

Your Honor -I mean, I would think that that

13

position leads to the position that you shouldn't have

14

peremptories.

15

MR. KOHLER:

Your Honor, I believe a small

16

number of peremptories are desirable.

17

they are essential.

I do not believe

18

I think one of the problems in Georgia is there

19

are so many peremptories granted -- 10 and 20 -- that the

20

potential for abuse is great because you do not simply

21

eliminate that one or two jurors that you suspect in your

22

heart as not being --or will not be fair, but there is

23

the encouragement to eliminate entire groups of people.

substantial black population -- about 43 percent --

2

potentially, if the defendant is of a mind to and the

3

42 jurors mirror the population, he can remove the entire

group of people, not simply jurors that he might suspect

might not be fair.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the members of the Court:
To the defendant on trial in the State and

Federal courts of this country, the only things that stand

8

between that defendant and the power of the State to

9

imprison him are his attorney and the jury, and we would

submit to this Court that it is the ultimate private

11

choice of that defense attorney and his client to exercise

12

the peremptory challenge as the attorney and the defendant

13

see fit based on the facts of each case.

14

QUESTION:

Would you say that the only things

15

that stand between them are the attorney, the jury, and

16

the law?

MR. REVELL:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, I would agree

with that.
To that defendant, the ability to choose certain

20

jurors over other jurors through peremptory challenges is

21

in many cases one of the most significant and most

22

meaningful tools that that defendant has in exercising his

23

right to an impartial jury.

In that case, of course, the Court held that a

Federal public defender is not a State actor in performing

the traditional defense functions.

In that case, the

traditional defense function was a motion to withdraw from

11

the case on the basis that the appeal was frivolous.

would submit to the Court that there is nothing more

traditional in the trial of a case and the defense of a

client than helping that client select an impartial jury.

deciding what kind of a jury to pick?
MR. REVELL:

Your Honor, I think this Court has

implied that in its holding in Powers and also in a

concurring opinion in Hernandez v. New York, in which the

Court seems to indicate that there are -- there's a

12

continuum where on one end the peremptory challenge is

MR. REVELL:

2

It may very well be, Your Honor.

3

It seemed clear to me in Batson that the evil that was

4

sought to be prevented was the assumption that had been

5

carried forward from Strauda v. West Virginia to date that

6

black people as a race for various stereotypical reasons

7

could not decide a case properly, not that there were

8

factors involved in the case that would influence their

9

decision or cause empathy or sympathy toward the defendant

10

and concern him about whether he would be fairly tried,

11

but that the decision was that they could not decide a

12

case.

13

QUESTION:

Well, suppose that in a case such as

14

the one we have here on voir dire a black juror said to

15

you I have to tell you that I'm very affronted by an

16

assault against someone of my race and I don't think I

17

could put my race out of my mind in deciding this case.

18

That would be a very important factor for me in deciding

19

the case.

20

disqualifying the juror on the grounds of bias, do you?

21

You don't think we would prevent you from

MR. REVELL:

No, Your Honor.

I think in that

22

case the candor of the juror in responding to a voir dire

23

question that way would be applauded, and the judge may

24

very well excuse the juror because of that situation.

25

QUESTION:

So that I've just demonstrated to

you, and I think you agree, that race can be a factor in

2

excusal of the juror if it indicates that the juror is - -

3

is not impartial.

4

MR. REVELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

We are about to

5

embark -- I read that there's a -- cert was granted in a

6

court of appeals case in Texas in which two black jurors

7

were excused in a civil case and the issue on appeal is

8

whether the explanation which the trial judge approved was

9

satisfactory, and we as a result of Edmondson, and if the

10

court rules for the State of Georgia in this case, we will

11

see a new body of law on whether the explanation is

12

satisfactory or not.
QUESTION:

13

Even if we rule against you here,

14

you're going to be in better --a criminal defendant is

15

going to be in better shape than the prosecution insofar

16

as appealing adverse rulings.

17

over, if the jury brings in a verdict of acquittal there's

18

nothing the State can do to take up the question of

19

whether perhaps some of your strikes should have been

20

overruled because of Batson.
MR. REVELL:

21

I mean, after the trial is

Yes, Your Honor, the State is going

22

to have very little incentive in that situation to carry

23

the case on, and the juror is likely going to have very

24

little incentive in seeing a trial --a case retried or

25

reversed.

Yes, sir, I would agree with that.

In regard to the State action argument, it seems

1

2

critical that throughout all of the cases in which this

3

Court has examined private actors to determine whether

4

State action exists, while the cases vary widely in their

5

facts and circumstances, the common thread is that there

6

is always found a cooperation between the private actor

7

and the State in which the State -- in which they're

8

acting together in concert, not in conflict with one

9

another.

10

One thing that is troubling to the defense and

11

is troubling because it seems to be a central focus of

12

Edmondson is the proposition -- the holding -- that the

13

private litigants have been delegated the responsibility

14

of selecting a jury, and that that jury constitutes

15

officials or employees of the Government, and therefore in

16

selecting that jury it's tantamount to State action.

17

When we view the State as our bitter and staunch

18

adversary and, under the Sixth Amendment right to an

19

impartial trial, impartial jury, we view those very jurors

20

as being employees or officials of the State, that's a

21

proposition that is inconsistent and very troubling.

22

We would submit that while that may very well be

23

the case in the civil situation, in which the jury has

24

arguably been delegated the responsibility to arbitrate or

25

decide the civil actions, the jury in the criminal case

1

cannot be considered an employee or official of the

2

Government.

3

The jury is - - and the law and the defense

4

attorney is what stands between that defendant and

5

oppression, and the idea that the jury -QUESTION:

6

I really don't understand why the

7

jury is any different from the trial judge in that

8

respect.

9

making decisions that vitally affect your future.

They both are, in a sense, agents of the State,
They

10

may be for you or against you, but they're still -- aren't

11

they spokesman for the sovereign when they act and return

12

their verdict?

13

MR. REVELL:

14

more to a trustee of the people.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. REVELL:

Your Honor, I would liken the jury

So's the judge in the same sense.
But the jury have the bond of trust

17

to their peers, in which they have the ultimate

18

fact-finding say-so to determine guilt or innocence, and

19

for that reason -QUESTION:

20
21
22

They're surely not an agent of the

defendant.
MR. REVELL:

Absolutely not.

They're an

23

independent body, standing between the State on one hand

24

and the defendant on the other.

25

QUESTION:

Well, they're not wholly independent.

1

They have to follow the law, too.
MR. REVELL:

2

Absolutely.

Although this Court

3

has clearly held over and over again that the peremptory

4

challenge is not of constitutional dimension, we would

5

submit that between voir dire and the selection of the

6

jury there has got to be some means implemented to secure

7

the defendant's right to select an impartial jury.

8

dire is very limited in Federal cases.

Voir

The peremptory challenge was designed to operate

9
10

in conjunction with the voir dire.

11

practice the voir dire effectively determines who may be

12

biased, who may be prejudiced, who may have empathy, who

13

may have sympathy.

14

various studies, and one of the studies is that it is a

15

human tendency not to respond intentionally or

16

subconsciously that one is biased in answering voir dire

17

questions.

18

We don't think in

All of the briefs make reference to

On the one hand we've got a juror, as Justice

19

Kennedy said, who candidly admits his bias.

On the other

20

hand, we've got a juror who is totally impartial.

21

jurors fall somewhere in between, and because of the facts

22

and circumstances of each case, they have empathies,

23

sympathies, human experiences which affect their ability

24

to decide the case.

25

ferret out as best we can those human tendencies in order

Most

2

to secure the right to an impartial trial.
What we're really concerned about is that

3

ultimately if this Court were to extend State action to

4

private attorneys in exercise of peremptory challenges,

5

would be the natural consequence that it would have to

6

decide peremptory challenges based on gender, peremptory

7

challenges based on ethnic issues, peremptory challenges

8

based on all of the other stereotypes.

9

QUESTION:

We're going to have to do that for

10

the prosecution and for attorneys in private civil

11

litigations as the law stands now, are we not?

12

13
14

MR. REVELL:

Very probably so, Your Honor, but

hopefully we won't have to do it for the defendant.
One of the ironies, and this is brought out by

15

the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in their brief in support of

16

petitioner, is that the evil which was sought to be

17

prevented in Batson, the exclusion from the jury of the

18

members of the defendant's race, may have come full circle

19

so that a ruling prohibiting parties from any peremptory

20

challenge based on whatever reason, including race, would

21

have the effect of prohibiting the minority defendant, the

22

underrepresented defendant, from being able to use the

23

peremptory challenge to have members of his or her own

24

group on the jury.

25

The underrepresented minority defendant would

1

not be able to use his peremptory challenge to exclude

2

majority members to enhance the opportunity for members of

3

his own group to be on the jury, and they recognize this

4

as a problem, and that's why in their brief they, in a

5

simple manner of speaking, want to have it both ways.

6

They want us to be excluded solely on the issue of black

7

jurors, but they want the black juror to still have the

8

freedom to exercise peremptory challenges in any way they

9

see fit.

10

We believe that the exercise of the peremptory

11

challenge by the defendant in a criminal case is the

12

ultimate private choice and exercised by the defendant

13

while performing a traditional function of defense

14

counsel, and it should remain that way to preserve the

15

adversarial system as we know it.

16

of State action to encompass the defense attorney will

17

undermine the adversarial process.

the continued sanctity and right of a juror - - of a

19

defendant to be tried by an impartial jury.
