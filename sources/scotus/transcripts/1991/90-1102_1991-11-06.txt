ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND J. LaJEUNESSE, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner Robert Gibson is required to be a

10
11

member of the Florida Bar as a condition of his practice

12

of his law in Florida by rule of the Florida supreme

13

court.

14

constitutionality of the collection of compulsory bar dues

15

that are used for political and ideological purposes, and

16

on a first appeal the 11th Circuit held that the bar,

17

indeed, was violating his First Amendment rights by using

18

his compulsory dues for political and ideological purposes

19

unrelated to the bar's core regulatory functions, thus

20

anticipating this Court's decision in Keller v. California

21

State Bar.

22

He brought this lawsuit challenging the

The 11th Circuit remanded the case for the

23

district court to determine which of the past positions

24

taken by the bar were constitutionally permissible and

25

impermissible uses of Mr. Gibson's dues.

QUESTION:

1

The context of the case has very much

2

changed in - - well, I'll ask you, in light of the Florida

3

supreme court's order that the State bar not engage in

4

nonbar-related activities.

5

the significance and importance of this case, if not -- if

6

not technically mooted it?

7

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Hasn't that certainly changed

I -- I don't think so, Your

8

Honor.

The -- the Frankel decision, which is the decision

9

to which Justice Kennedy refers, merely held that the bar

10

may not use compulsory dues for lobbying purposes which do

11

not meet this Court's Keller test.
It did not go as far as Keller to hold that

12

13

compulsory bar dues may not be used for all ideological

14

activities not germane to the bar's core regulatory

15

functions, so we still have a problem with regard to

16

activities other than lobbying -- for example, public

17

relations, education programs, publications, matters which

18

were at issue in -- in Keller, in addition to lobbying.

Why would the -- why would -- is that

QUESTION:

1

2

-- to say, you have to be partially

constitutional.

3

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

The -- the problem arises

4

because the bar's procedure addresses only legislative

5

issues.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I can't imagine that that's

7

what -- that's what the Florida courts mean.

8

seems to me they're trying to say, you -- you can only

9

expend your money in a way that would be entirely

I mean, it

10

constitutional, so that we don't have to play these games

11

about segregating out the funds.

12

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Your Honor, I don't agree that

13

that's correct.

14

member has a right to object only to the use of his dues

15

when the bar takes a position on a legislative issue, and

16

in any event, even if the Florida supreme court's Frankel

17

decision were interpreted to be congruent with Keller in

18

all respects, we still have a situation where the State

19

has created a compelled association, the compulsory bar,

20

and given the bar authority to potentially infringe on

21

First Amendment rights by not only using the dues, but by

22

using the dues for political and ideological purposes.

On the face of the bar's procedure, a

3

it's living up to the law could predict in advance that

it's not going to.

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

6

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

Now, how could -- how could you

7

expect a bar to remit something in advance that it has no

8

intention of owing you?

9

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Because the bar -- as in any

10

circumstance where the State authorizes a situation which

11

makes it possible for First Amendment rights to be

12

infringed upon, the State also has an obligation to

13

provide procedures - -

QUESTION:

15

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

16

Well, all right --- that reduce the risk of that

infringement.

QUESTION:

But you -- but I would think

you -- you claim that there should be a reduction in

advance.
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

22

That's correct, Your Honor.

The bar - QUESTION:

But you -- but you can't -- even if

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

2

QUESTION:

3

How can

How can you ask them to then estimate

how much they're going to break the law in advance?

4

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

In the same manner that this

5

Court held that the unions could do it in the compulsory

6

dues cases, that is, based upon prior experience.

7

do not rely upon prior experience, past expenditures, in

8

calculating this year's dues amount, you end up with a

9

naked demand backed up by a bluff, the bluff of the bar

10

that everything we do is chargeable with no appropriate

11

justification, which is what this Court held was required

12

in Hudson.

13

QUESTION:

If we

There's a big difference in the union

14

cases, because there was no prohibition against engaging

15

in the activity.

16

the members support those activities, and here you've got

17

a prohibition against --

18

The only prohibition was against having

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

I don't think the case is that

19

different, Your Honor.

In Hudson, under the Illinois

20

statute and under the collective bargaining contract, the

21

bar -- excuse me, the union was permitted to charge all

22

nonmembers only a proportionate share of the cost of

23

collective bargaining, that is, a constitutionally

24

chargeable fair share fee -- all nonmembers -- so you had

25

a State limitation on the substance of what could be

collected.
And this Court said in Hudson that it -- it's

2

3

not only a substantive limitation that is necessary, but

4

that the State has an obligation to provide procedural

5

safeguards that make -- reduce the risk that the union, or

6

in this case the bar, will go outside those substantive

7

limitations, and those procedural safeguards are very

8

close to the procedural safeguards that are necessary for

9

any taking of property.
Due process safeguards of a prior notice,

10

in

11

this case a prior notice in which the bar would justify

12

the amount of the fee, the compulsory dues that it's

13

charging to a member who wishes to object, an opportunity

14

for a hearing - -

15

QUESTION:

Yes, but supposing they send a notice

16

out to the membership, we - - our legislative program for

all permissible under the Florida supreme court's

legislative position, and as the 11th Circuit recognized,

First Amendment right of the objector has already been

irreparably harmed, and we - - and the only remedy is the

4

rebate remedy, which this Court condemned with regard to

5

the unions in both Ellis and in Hudson.
QUESTION:

6

No, but I'm trying to figure out what

7

happens under the new -- new regime in Florida.

8

they -- if they publicize their legislative program, what

9

else are they supposed to do under your view of the law?

10

which they don't do now, Your Honor.

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

They just send that out, period.

What more should they do, Your

17

Honor?

18

their budget -- when I say budget, I mean prior year's

19

expenditures, which should be the basis for the

calculation of the dues amount, showing the major

21

categories of expenditures, and in each category breaking

it down between chargeable and nonchargeable expenditures,

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

What more need

They need to at that point also

attach some dollars so that when the member objects, that

7

portion which is in dispute can be escrowed.
QUESTION:

8

9

Yes, but your dispute would be - - you

would say, you pick out some items on the legislative

10

program and you say, well, this is not germane.

11

not one of those -- this is not obeying the law.

12

something outside of their permissible activities, and

13

then you want to - - and then you want a hearing on that,

14

and you -- and once you make that objection, I suppose you

want, then, an escrow?

it before they ever engage in the activity.

QUESTION:

But you -- you think that -- you

think the -- the bar association should escrow anything

you object to?
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

6

No, Your Honor, I don't.

I

7

think they should follow the same type of procedure that

8

this Court prescribed for the unions in Hudson, and that

is, when they calculate the chargeable amount of the dues

QUESTION:

15

that everything is chargeable.

QUESTION:

5

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

6

But in Hudson --- that escrow of less than

100 percent.

7

QUESTION:

But in Hudson, it was the premise of

8

the case that the union was going to expend chargeable and

9

nonchargeable amounts.

That is not the premise of this

10

case, based on the questions that we've been asking you so

11

far.
Assume, for the moment, that we read the Frankel

12

13

opinion as saying that the bar may not engage in any

14

activity which causes a nonchargeable expense.

15

says that.

16

what is the necessity for any sort of advance budget or

17

escrow provision?

Assume it

If that is the order of the Supreme Court,

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

QUESTION:

5

-- would be improper -There's a very --

-- because the State might violate

the First Amendment somehow during the course of the year.
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

No, Your Honor, there's a very

6

fundamental distinction between the State taking taxes for

7

the State's general purposes and the bar's taking

8

compulsory dues for the purpose of compelling association

9

with the bar.

10
11

That is, the very purpose of the collection

of dues is an infringement on First Amendment rights.
Now, this Court has held that to a limited

12

extent that infringement is justified by a compelling

13

governmental interest, but nonetheless there still must be

14

a carefully tailored procedure to ensure that that

15

infringement goes no further than necessary to meet the

16

compelling governmental interest, which is the support of

17

the bar's regulatory functions.

18

There's no reason -- and I must -- I must go

19

back in response to Justice Kennedy that we - - we also

20

have to consider the constitutionality of this procedure

21

for the 5 years that it operated before Frankel, in which

22

the bar was operating under the assumption that it could

23

engage in nonchargeable activities so long as it had a

24

procedure that met the requirements of Hudson.

25

question is not moot.

of the part that's reasonably in dispute does satisfy

given this notice that it's taken a position on an

issue -- and by requiring him to object to specific

if you make an objection to a specific legislative issue,

2

that sets in motion a process by which if the bar does not

objection, you go to arbitration within a time period on

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY SCOTT RICHARD

2

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

3

MR. RICHARD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
With the Court's permission, I would like to

6

begin by addressing questions that were raised by Justice

7

Kennedy and Justice White.

8

decision, counsel has suggested that the Frankel decision

9

was limited solely to legislative positions.

With regard to the Frankel

The reason

10

for that is because those were the only positions that

11

were challenged in the Frankel case by the petitioners,

12

just as they are the only petitions -- the only positions

13

that have been challenged in this case.

14

However, it is clear from this Court's decisions

15

that the Abood criteria, the requirements of Hudson, are

16

not limited to legislative lobbying positions, and as far

17

as the Florida bar is concerned, it reads its own Supreme

18

Court decision as being as expansive as are the decisions

19

of this Court in Keller.

20

It is our opinion that it would make no sense,

21

as Justice Kennedy suggested, for the Florida supreme

22

court to attempt to distinguish between the two and so, as

23

we understand that ruling, we are limited as to all

24

political and ideological purposes to the parameters of

25

Keller and Abood.

MR. RICHARD:

QUESTION:

7

MR. RICHARD:

8

That seems to me very perceptive.

Very perceptive.
I can read, Your Honor.

I'm sorry.
Second, Your Honor, with regard to

Justice Kennedy's suggestion that perhaps this case is
moot if not insignificant, while it may be that with

10

regard to Florida it is moot, the fact is a split

11

continues to exist in the various circuits, and because

12

this Court may want to address this issue, I will address

13

it regardless of whether or not the Florida supreme court

14

had taken the position that it did in the Frankel case,

15

and I will do that in just a moment.

16

First, however, I would like to also address the

17

question that was raised by Justice White regarding

18

whether or not injunction would be at -- whether or not

1

that Florida's interpretation -- that Florida's

20

interpretation of the Frankel case -- is consistent with

21

this Court's ruling in Keller.

22

is, indeed, consistent.

23

issue is not the terminology but the manner in which it

24

has been interpreted by the Court.

25

It is our position that it

As this Court said in Keller, the

The reason that this Court struck down the
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)28 -2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

California court's interpretation is because even though,

2

as this Court noted, its language appeared to be the same

3

as the language of this Court, it had so broadly-

4

interpreted it that it essentially allowed any lobbying.

5

Quite the contrary.

In its first test of the

6

criteria that it had earlier established in the Schwarz

7

case, the Florida supreme court gave an extremely narrow

8

interpretation which clearly falls within the scope of

9

Keller, and essentially what the Florida supreme court

10

said in interpreting those additional three criteria was

11

that it must be - - that when they say that it must be an

12

issue upon which attorneys have special expertise, that

13

means it must have to do with the administration of the

14

system of justice as opposed to the subject matter of the

15

legislation.

16

Now, the essential point here is that this Court

17

does not have before it now a case in which the

18

interpretation by the Florida supreme court by anybody's

19

measure is beyond Keller or Abood, and there will be no

20

issue until such time as a petitioner brings a case to

21

this Court or another Federal court in which the Florida

22

courts have interpreted it in an expansive manner that

23

violates those cases.

24
25

Now, what I would like to do is to address this
question, as I said, in an even broader sense.
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260

I think,

1

as comments from the Justices have already indicated, that

2

there is no question that given the current interpretation

3

by Florida's supreme court, that this case squarely meets

4

the requirements of Abood and of Keller with regard to

5

advance reduction, but I would suggest to this Court that

6

even before the Frankel decision, and even with respect to

7

those States that have not gone so far as Florida, advance

8

reduction which has never been mandated by this Court

9

simply makes no sense.

10

It rests upon the assumption that there is only

11

one interest here to be served, the interest of the

12

dissenters, and that that interest is to be served and

13

that the convenience of the dissenters is to be served

14

without regard for any other interest, and that flies in

15

the face of what this Court has said consistently when it

16

has cautioned district courts that they are to balance the

17

interests of the dissenters against the right and the

18

necessity for the organization to have the ability to fund

19

those activities which are germane, and there is no way, I

20

would respectfully suggest to this Court, that advance

21

reduction can accomplish that purpose, and I will

22

illustrate.

23

Let us assume that the dissenters have demanded

24

their escrow and that a determination has been made at

25

some point that it was 10 percent of the budget, and they

QUESTION:

Now, in what manner --

You're saying two different things.

3

4

10

Now, in what manner are you to reduce next year,

11

12

way, there are some circumstances in which reduction is

13

certainly practicable.

15

10 percent of its budget to campaign contributions, surely

16

that's a simple matter of reduction.

17

For instance, if you've got a

However, if you're dealing with a legislative

18

situation, then as Justice Souter mentioned in the Chapman

19

case in New Hampshire, it's an extremely complicated and

20

never a wholly satisfactory system to advance reduce,

21

because what do you reduce?

22

Florida's court is typical.

It budgets a lump

23

sum amount to lobbying.

24

percentage of lobbying is going to go to what issues in

nobody knows how many committees are going to take up a

The point here is that we are not dealing,

Here's what we're dealing with here.

8

The Florida bar says -- and by the way, the

9

rules which are in the record reflect that before the

10

Florida Bar Board of Governors votes to take a position

11

they must, by two-thirds vote, first agree that it is

12

germane to what the Florida supreme court has said is its

13

permissible area, so first they must make that decision so

14

that in every case the board has already determined -- has

15

already determined that it is germane.

16

Now, the petitioner comes along and says, we

17

don't want you to spend our money on any nongermane

18

purposes, and the answer a fortiori is, we're not.

With regard to the issue of

Now, we've had a statement from counsel here for
