We'll hear argument

Mr. Lewis.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. CAMDEN LEWIS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. LEWIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
10

We are here because Mr. Lucas' land has been

11

taken without just compensation being paid.

12

principle in a case like this seems to rest on a

13

determination when justice and fairness require that the

14

economic injuries caused by public action should be borne

15

by the many rather than the few, or, as Justice Holmes

16

said, when has a regulation gone too far?

17

Our position is simple.

The guiding

When Mr. Lucas was

18

denied all economically viable uses of his land, these

1

basic principles demand that Mr. Lucas be paid just

20

compensation for that taking.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Lewis, is it perfectly clear from

22

the opinion of the majority in the supreme court of South

23

Carolina that they accepted the hypothesis that he was

24

denied all economically viable use of his land?

25

MR. LEWIS:

Yes, sir.

MR. LEWIS:

QUESTION:

5

So you feel it was completely

Yes, sir.
Would you be willing to give it to

me?
MR. LEWIS:

6

I don't own it, but with the taxes

7

that are owed on it I would be willing to give it to you,

8

yes, sir.

9
10

(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

On the subject of concessions, do

11

you, or did you concede that discouraging construction --

12

and I'm referring, by the way, to the findings set out on

13

page 16 of the red brief - - that discouraging the

14

construction near the beach dune area is necessary to

15

prevent a great public harm?

16

MR. LEWIS:

No, sir, we did not concede that.

17

We conceded that the regulation was a regulation that

18

substantially advanced legitimate State interests.

19

all we did.

20

first prong of the Tiburon or Agins test, we just said

21

that we were not going to challenge that, that we were

22

going to say, and as we did prove, that all economically

23

viable uses of the land were gone.

24
25

That's

We did not challenge the regulation on the

view, the payment of compensation if all economically

viable use of the land is gone, or is that not applicable

2

if there's a nuisance?

3

5

MR. LEWIS:

I think it is always applicable, and

I don't think that -QUESTION:

So even if this were a nuisance,

6

compensation would be required if the restriction on the

7

land took away all of its economic viability.

8

9

MR. LEWIS:

Yes, sir.

My question would then

become is when you look at the uses that were available

10

before and after, if the only use was something was so

11

obnoxious and so bad as to be able to meet whatever

12

definition you want to as a Lucas it wouldn't be worth

13

very much money, so therefore when you apply the before

14

and after value, or the before and after use, I think that

15

takes care of that extreme case that I can't imagine that

16

you've just mentioned.

17

QUESTION:

Is land different from --

18

QUESTION:

I guess the reason we can't imagine

19

it and we haven't had a case on it is because the

20

definition of nuisance would be so expansive.

21

MR. LEWIS:

22

everybody, yes, sir.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Nuisance is different to

Is land different from other property

in that regard?
MR. LEWIS:

Yes, sir.

Tiburon case -- and I think it's very different.

In the

2

Tiburon case your -- denies an owner economically viable

3

use of the land.

You use the word land in that case.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. LEWIS:

6

(Laughter.)

7

QUESTION:

Well, it happened to be land.
Yes, sir.

I mean, if it had been a cow, we

8

would have said a cow, I assume.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. LEWIS:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
That doesn't seem to be very

12

remarkable.

That doesn't show that land is distinctive.

13

Suppose a State decides that it wants to prohibit the sale

14

of alcoholic beverages and it enacts a statute to that

15

effect and somebody has a factory that is useless for

16

anything else except for manufacturing beer?

17

MR. LEWIS:

QUESTION:

19

MR. LEWIS:

21

QUESTION:

23

It's totally useless.

Would there be

recovery?

20

22

Well, I think first of all --

No, sir.
Because that's a building and not

land.
MR. LEWIS:

That is -- the building and the land

24

go together as a unit.

that case I think you looked -- in that case they haven't

denied all economic uses of it, and to go back to your

2

question on real versus personal property, there is a

3

great distinction.

4

jurisprudence has been found to be unique.

specific performance for real property.

Real property throughout our
You can have a

dealing with real property and personal property between

8

what's entitlement and what's a fundamental right.

9

fundamental right to own property, to live on property.

10

How you go out and what you can sell and how you can do

11

that, that's an entitlement -QUESTION:

12

13

It's a

It's not a fundamental right to own

personal property.

14

MR. LEWIS:

Yes, sir, it's a fundamental right

15

to own it.

16

sell it if something's wrong with it or if it's diseased

17

or something like that.

18

no, sir.

19

It's not a fundamental right to go out and

QUESTION:

That's not a fundamental right,

What's your authority for the

20

proposition that the ownership of property is a

21

fundamental right?

22

MR. LEWIS:

I think if you go back to the fact

23

of the Fifth Amendment, when they say that you can't take

24

property without paying just compensation, that's a right

25

to own and use property.

QUESTION:

1

2

It's a right not to be deprived of

property without being paid compensation.

3

MR. LEWIS:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
But that's a much more careful

5

statement of the proposition than the statement that

6

ownership of property is a fundamental right.

7

any further authority for that?
MR. LEWIS:

8

9
10

I'm saying that the

right to use your property is the fundamental right.
Ownership, not everybody owns property.
QUESTION:

11
12

Oh, I'm sorry.

Do you have

Well, why do you say it's a

fundamental right?

13

MR. LEWIS:

I say it's a fundamental right

14

because if you have property and you go back and see that

15

the uses of property are what makes up property.

16

have property, you have the right to use it.

17

said that in Tiburon, that when you take all the uses,

18

it's gone.

19

the uses that are remaining afterwards, so property is

20

just made up of uses.

21

If you

You have

You have said in the cases that you look at

QUESTION:

Well, the fact that property is jus

22

made up of uses does not necessarily prove that the

23

ownership of it is a fundamental right.

24

you can do all you need for your case by simply adhering

25

to the language of the just compensation clause.

All you have to prove is

I agree, and that is what

QUESTION:

Mr. Lewis, could we change direction

QUESTION:

Did the petitioner ever apply for

such a permit?

QUESTION:

No, he did not.

QUESTION:

You have the lower court finding
You have a stipulation of

But did that finding determine the

effect of this new exemption permit?
MR. LEWIS:

What we have is, it's interesting in

10

the stipulations in the court below.

11

stipulation in the court below, number 11, which says that

12

the current law will not allow any structures to be on

13

this piece of property, and then we have a stipulation

14

number 16 which says that any permit would be denied.

15

that same period of time, this act that later came law was

16

in the process and in the legislature, so those two things

right there show that there was at least a contemplation

Well, slow down a minute.

At

At the

time the stipulation was filed the permit law had not yet

found that the case went forward to be right.

at that particular amendment --

QUESTION:

If you look

Well, that doesn't settle the

rightness for us.

MR. LEWIS:

8

I think that they looked at it

10

The Supreme Court was asked

QUESTION:

No, sir, it is just a consideration.

But do you still have a right to

apply for the exemption?
MR. LEWIS:

11

I do not think so.

I think with the

12

finding of the South Carolina supreme court that this --

13

the building of a house or a home on this property is

14

detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare, that they

15

are required under the amendment to turn my application

16

down.

17

would have a change of heart.

18

QUESTION:

There's nothing in this record to show that they

Well, you're asking us to decide

19

that, but we don't really know if you applied for an

20

exemption whether you'd get it or not.
MR. LEWIS:

21

I think that under the -- if you

look at the findings of the Supreme Court and you look at

opinion?

2

dissenting judges below?

3

Didn't they think you had a right to apply, the

MR. LEWIS:

No, sir.

I think the dissenting

4

judges said that -- if I remember correctly, they said

5

that either pay them the money or give them a permit.

6

QUESTION:

They said I would remand to the

7

Coastal Council its decision as to whether to issue the

8

permits in view of the recent 1990 amendments.

9
10

MR. LEWIS:
QUESTION:

Or to pay the money.
Yes, but certainly one of the options

11

was to consider it under the 1990 amendment.

12

the dissenting judge says in so many words.

13
14
15

MR. LEWIS:

That's what

I cannot say that one of the options

in this case, because there has been -QUESTION:

I know you don't say that.

What I'm

16

saying is the dissenting judges on the supreme court of

17

the State said that was an option.

18

MR. LEWIS:

They also said that it wasn't

19

detrimental to the health, welfare and safety, so once

20

they take -- there you have to look at their opinion,

21

dissenting opinion as a whole.

22

detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare, so you

23

take that particular stamp on Mr. Lucas' property away,

24

and he sure could apply, but the dissent didn't carry the

25

day on that particular finding of fact.

They say it wasn't

QUESTION:

1

Well, there's no doubt, is there,

2

Mr. Lewis, that there was a period from 1988 until 1990

3

when there was no permit for which you could have applied

4

for?

5

MR. LEWIS:

6

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
And you simply -- the situation

7

described by the supreme court of South Carolina did

8

obtain.

9

MR. LEWIS:

Absolutely.

There are 2 years where

10

there's absolutely nothing Mr. Lucas could do with this

11

property whatsoever.
QUESTION:

12

13

We're throwing around the term no

economic viability of this property.

14

MR. LEWIS:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.
Viable is a good medical term, it

16

isn't a legal term, but the lawyers have taken it over and

17

the judges too.

18

What do you mean by economic viability?

MR. LEWIS:

What I'm saying by that, that this

19

property is worth 0, $0.

20

the before and after value, before it was worth a

21

$1 million and it was a nice home site, two nice home

22

sites.

Afterwards it has no uses and no value.

QUESTION:

24

MR. LEWIS:

25

That before and after the uses,

of the keys in it.

So it's a matter of valuation.
Well, valuation is, of course, one
It also goes to uses.

QUESTION:

Counsel, suppose there's a

residential subdivision and a person owns lots that are

zoned for residential improvement, but they're vacant

lots.

6

expert opinion is that it is very very dangerous to build

and the county denies zoning permit for that reason.

assume also that all economic viability of the land is

gone.

And an earthquake fault is discovered and the

Is that a taking?
MR. LEWIS:

10

And

It is not taking for the following

11

reason.

12

the land, it was the discovery of the fact that the land

13

had no value in the first place.

14

before and after test, the uses before and after, you find

15

that it is the fact that it's on a fault and it's no good

16

to build on anyway, if that's the case.

It was not the regulation that took the value of

QUESTION:

So when you take the

Well, why, why can't the State say

18

here that the finding was that this coastal zone, because

19

of new and detailed studies with reference to erosion, is

20

now a very dangerous place to build; dangerous for the

21

owner, dangerous for the neighbors.

22

MR. LEWIS:

Because if look -- if you go out

23

there and if you look at the land, and you go out there

24

and see it, you have a big house on the left, you have a

big house, a four story house in the middle, and on the

such a conclusion, and Justice Toll --

we're arguing about.

fact that this ordinance had, or this regulation had a

valid public purpose.

8

MR. LEWIS:

9

QUESTION:

We - - your client stipulated the

Yes, sir.

We indeed say that.

And it seems to me that there are

10

instances in which all economic viability can be deprived

because of an urgent safety reason, and that there's no

taking.

MR. LEWIS:

Well this is -And I don't think your answer has

refuted that proposition.
MR. LEWIS:

Well, what I'm saying in that case,

17

if there's an urgent safety reason, the urgency of that,

18

whatever it is, if it's a fire coming down on you, if it's

19

a fact that there's a bomb underneath of you, the

exigencies of that situations are what demands that.

this case there's no such thing.

Justice Toll took some findings in the legislature

the findings that there was a great public harm was not a

Well, I assume the legislature can

make a finding, can't it?
MR. LEWIS:

They never said anything about it

being a great public harm.

16

you can look at the factual findings of the legislature it

17

talks about a -- the erosion, it talks about tourism, it

18

talks about making the beaches nice and making them

19

pretty, it has a whole bunch of nice statements that all

20

legislation has for the reason they passed such an act.

21

All they said was that, and if

But to take that and to say, okay, I'm going to jump

22

from that and say that these findings make it a great

public harm, I don't think you can do that.

going to do that, what happens is that we're going to have

If you're

we're going to have to attack the statute.

2

Because we're going to be in fear that some higher

3

authority or judge is going to say we didn't attack the

4

statute as it substantially advances legitimate State

5

interests, and because you didn't do that, hey it's a

QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Lewis, on that

16

question, the South Carolina supreme court thought you'd

17

conceded that, at least they said that in their opinion.

18

Did you in your cert petition ask us to review the

19

accuracy of that concession?

MR. LEWIS:

Yes, sir.

something that could be used as a basis for denying just

Mr. Lewis, may I ask you two factual

11

questions.

12

there's an indication that at some point in the recallable

13

past, maybe 10 or 15 years ago, your land was under water

14

at one point.

15

I seem to recall that somewhere in the record

Is that correct?

MR. LEWIS:

There is something in the record,

16

and I don't remember how long back, that there was a pond

17

on one of our lots.

you'll see, you'll sit on one side and you have to walk

around some water that's out there to get to the beach on

the other side.

you described as the finding of the South Carolina supreme

court that the development of the land would be

12

detrimental to public welfare, safety, health, and so on.

13

And you said that finding came out of the blue.

14

Was that finding possibly based on, and simply a kind

15

of an interpretation of this record evidence that at one

16

point some of your land, at least, was inundated?

the alternative, was that so-called finding simply a

statement in a shorthand kind of way that that's what the

Building on an unstable and fragile beach

dune system does create harm.
10

QUESTION:

Well, if you say there is no

11

constitutional right to harm others and link it to your

12

argument -- what about Justice Holmes' opinion in Mann

13

against Pennsylvania Coal Company, where there was no

14

question that the sub-surface mining would very likely to

15

cause the subsidence of some residences, and yet the Court

16

said that the compensation had to be paid.

17

MR. HARNESS:

I think what Justice Holmes was

18

looking at was the balance between the degree of harm.

1

There was very little public harm, in his way of thinking.

20

It was a private harm that he was discussing.

21

instance, in that particular instance, the degree of

22

diminution in value was very significant.

23

I think in looking at the harm, what the Court
does is to look at the degree of the harm.

proposition that there is no right to harm others in

2

support of your idea of the nuisance exception is perhaps

3

too broad, that sometimes there will be some actions of

4

property owners that may cause some sort of harm to others

5

and yet, perhaps they may not be totally proscribed

6

without paying compensation?

7

MR. HARNESS:

I would concede that.

I think

8

that this goes back to what has been termed the Mugler

9

principle.

The community has authority to prevent serious

10

public harm by denying uses without being required to pay

11

compensation, but certainly it is a measure of the degree

12

of harm that the State is seeking to prevent.

13

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me we have two

14

extreme positions here.

15

doesn't matter how much harm, you have to pay.

16

read the South Carolina supreme court, it seems to say, it

17

doesn't matter how little harm, you don't have to pay.

supreme court said?

If you read the findings and

highest type of police power activity, that is preventing

QUESTION:

12

13

Did it say highest type of police

power activity?

14

MR. HARNESS:

No, sir, it does not say that, but

15

I think that that has been the position taken by the

16

solicitor general and by this Court, that if there is a

17

great threat to life and property, that certainly would

fit within the commonly called nuisance exception.

MR. HARNESS:

I think that the threat is very

3

real. First of all, the act looked at the threat to life

and property by building near the ocean.

recognized that portions of homes, even homes themselves

6

during times of great storm events will be blown or washed

into houses behind them

8

It is well

Secondly, that septic tanks and that sewer lines
that lead to these houses are very near the ocean, break

asunder and that those contaminants are put into public

waters. Thirdly, that water lines are broken and the water

supply is contaminated, and fourthly --

building entirely, not necessary precautions, just say you

can't build?

1

Well, Mr. Harness, with reference to

the adjacent homes, the homes that have been built on

4

Carolina could require those homes to be removed because

it still is the same threat to public safety that exists

with respect to allowing new construction on these lots.

Isn't that right?

Wouldn't your theory take you that far?

You could prevent new construction.

That is correct.

Now, can you require the person

It's

not safe because the next rain is going to come and your

you to take it down, now.

MR. HARNESS:

Compensation or no

No compensation.

It would be very

15

similar to the tenement houses where the court has said

you have to either remove these things or improve them.

17

It makes it impossible for the landowner to do so, because

of the threat to the public.

me, indicate that there is a taking, if the owner is

denied all economically viable use of his land.

the court's term, economically viable.

MR. HARNESS:

That's

The court has never, to my

6

knowledge, applied that test.

It has repeatedly said that

7

diminution in value alone is not sufficient to equate to a

8

taking, but I think it - - from the way I have read it --

9

it may be a shorthand for the fact that you have to look

10

at two things, the diminution in value and also the

11

reasonable investment-backed expectations.

I don't think it has been applied literally and

I have had the same problem of determining what the word

But do you think -- I didn't

understand the South Carolina court to go on that basis,

that he didn't have any valid expectation.

MR. HARNESS:

The supreme court did not discuss

that because it did not have to reach it.
QUESTION:

Well, if it comes here, I think if

13

the case comes here, I thought the California court --or

14

your State court said that even if there is a valid

15

investment expectation, even if the law deprives the

16

landowner of all economic value, even if this law is

17

valid, and no pay.

18

MR. HARNESS:

That is not the way I read it.

19

The way I understood the case was that, first of all, the

20

petitioner raised a very extreme position, that diminution

21

alone was sufficient to equate to a taking, and second,

22

that he conceded the purposes and findings, and as a

23

result the court did not have to go in and look at

specifically the harms above what the legislature had

dictated, because it was never questioned.

It was never raised.

1

And they were addressing

2

the very narrow theory that he presented to the court,

3

which is diminution alone was sufficient to equate to a

4

taking.

5

QUESTION:

Am I right at least to this extent,

6

that if -- that your State court's opinion would bar also

7

any claim of a temporary taking?

8

MR. HARNESS:

9

As the Supreme Court opinion analogizes to

That's correct.

10

wetlands regulation, and they say just as with respect to

11

the '77 Coastal Zone Management Act, which prevented the

12

uncontrolled use of coastal wetlands, and it says our

13

analysis there did not contain a discussion of whether any

14

economically viable use remained in the property, so also

15

we don't have to have that discussion here, and I don't

16

think wetlands regulation is something that I would call

17

calling into question high concerns of public safety.

MR. HARNESS:

In Carter -- the case they're

referring to is Carter v. South Carolina Coastal Council.

change the natural character of the area so as to make it

reasonable investment-backed expectations, although it was

not raised.

8

9

QUESTION:

I'm not talking about reasonable

investment-backed expectations.

I'm saying that the court

10

here said we will be overruling Carter if we acknowledged

11

that a total taking would require compensation.

12

That's what they said, and I take that to

13

mean -- I take that to be the position that any valid

14

regulation of the land -- any valid regulation, regardless

15

of whether it rises to the level of regulation in order to

16

prevent a public nuisance, does not require compensation

17

even if it requires -- even if it results in a complete

Carter rested upon the importance of the --of public

MR. HARNESS:

between eminent domain and taking in that case - - rested

on the proposition that you do not have a right to use

It simply said public

Our position has been throughout the course of this

I don't know

10

exactly where that line is and certainly the court has had

11

to do it on an ad hoc basis.

12

As it relates to the South Carolina supreme

13

court, however, all they were faced with was not the

14

degree of harm, it was the fact that they conceded that

15

there was harm, and secondly they did not raise it in

their very extreme position.

17

One of the other points that I would like to

18

make is again back to the degree of harm and to talk a bit

19

about the purpose of the act.

to prevent people from building on unstable or eroding
