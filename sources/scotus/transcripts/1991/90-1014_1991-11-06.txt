ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COOPER:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

At the 1989 graduation ceremony of the Nathan

12

Bishop Middle School in Providence, Rhode Island, Rabbi

13

Leslie Gutterman opened the exercise with an

14

invocation -- one characterized by the district court as

15

an example of elegant simplicity, thoughtful content, and

16

sincere citizenship.

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, I think -About 13 or 14, aren't they?
Yes, Your Honor.
Are we getting so -I'm sorry, I could not hear you.
Never mind, go ahead.
The district court and the court of

10

appeals concluded that Rabbi Gutterman's invocation -- and

11

he gave a benediction which contained a similar reference

12

to God -- he opened the ceremony with the statement, God

13

of the free, hope of the brave.

14

concluded that that reference to the deity constituted an

15

endorsement of religion, and therefore violated the second

16

prong of this Court's three-part test under the Lemon

17

case.

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, the graduates generally

The district court and the court of appeals on

the concession of counsel for respondents concluded that

We submit that if the courts below were correct,

that if the Establishment Clause forbids the governmental

expression of religious sentiments in a traditional civic

ceremony of this kind, then Rabbi Gutterman's elegantly

simple reference to God pales as a constitutional threat,

21

when compared with the opening ritual of this Court that

we have just witnessed.

We certainly believe that it cannot compare with

QUESTION:

Well, isn't one of the reasons that

the people who are listening to the prayer are capable of

exercising different degrees of judgment, and hence

5

different degrees of assent or nonassent by their being

6

there.

Isn't that another distinction?

7

MR. COOPER:

Yes, Your Honor it is.

In fact, we

8

would concede that that is a very important part of the

9

nature and setting of either a graduation ceremony or a

10

classroom prayer, or prayer as expressed by this

would you be making the same argument?

MR. COOPER:

No, Your Honor, I would not.
And why not?

they don't have to agree to it, do they?
MR. COOPER:

That's -- that is the point.

And

the circumstances in which the Court's opening prayer is

expressed are in no way coercive.

can't you use a sectarian prayer?
MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, I don't think that a

sectarian prayer would, per se, be coercive.

Would one be any more coercive than

MR. COOPER:

can hypothesize extreme examples -- examples that would,

indeed, cross the threshold from religious expression to

I don't think that it is -QUESTION:

MR. COOPER:

Well,Your Honor, the statement from

the podium may be accompanied by various exhortations such

MR. COOPER;

1

Your Honor, I do believe that the

2

Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise clause were,

3

ah, were framed by the founding fathers to accomplish

4

religious freedom generally, both to prevent the

5

Government from - QUESTION:

6

Well, is the test the same under

either clause for a particular challenge?

8

essentially the same inquiry.
MR. COOPER:

You think it's

Your Honor, I do believe that both

10

require the finding of some coercive pressure on the

11

individual - QUESTION:

12

Well, could you have coercion from an

13

establishment standpoint but not a free exercise

14

standpoint?

15

MR. COOPER:

QUESTION:

Could you, Your Honor?
Yes, in other words, if you find

17

coercion in one, do you necessarily find coercion in the

18

other?

19

satisfy an equal protection -- or an establishment

20

challenge, as you do a free exercise challenge?

Do you have to have the same level of coercion to

21

Your Honor, I cannot think of an

instance where that might not be the case.

attendance, by holding out substantial inducements to

2

attendance that would amount to undue influence.

3

believe that the graduation ceremony context may well be

4

such an instance.

5

I

So in that regard, if this case were coming

6

before you in the absence of the stipulation that

7

attendance was entirely voluntary, then there would have

8

to be an inquiry into whether it was voluntary.

9

And if the determination was that it was not

10

voluntary, that attendance, that exposure to the

11

Government's speech, was not purely voluntary, one must

12

assess the nature and the setting of that speech to

13

determine if it is coercive.

14

I don't --

15

QUESTION:

Of course, if you said that the

16

Establishment Clause requires both noncoercion and

17

nonsectarianism, then it wouldn't have a content different

18

from the free exercise clause, would it?

19

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, I believe that is an

20

accurate statement.

And certainly, if the rule

21

that -- the rule of law that you are suggesting is

22

incorporated in the Establishment Clause,' then this

23

invocation in this benediction, anyway, before you, would

24

have to be upheld, because it was clearly

25

nondenominational.

10

it?
MR. COOPER:

13

Your Honor, I -- I believe that

you're right, yes.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. COOPER:

You believe so?
I will not argue with that.

But I

16

do not think that transformed what was otherwise a very

17

nondenominational invocation into something that was

18

sectarian.

19

But even if it did, again, I would want to

20

reiterate, that would not, in and of itself, mean that the

21

religious expression was coercive.

22

QUESTION:

When you say sectarian, you mean that

23

the entire prayer has got to be' lifted or taken verbatim

24

from some traditional, sectarian liturgy or traditional

25

expression of prayer?

me give you the alternative -- would it be sectarian if

2

selected phrases had been taken, not only from the Bible,

3

as Justice Blackmun suggested, but from recognized,

4

written prayers of a given religion, and had just been

5

en-sprinkled into this, and incorporated into this, but

6

not -- not verbatim?

7

Would that qualify as sectarian?

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, it might well qualify

8

as sectarian.

In other words, if -- to use a prayer that

9

is associated with just one sect, very clearly and

10

distinguishably to the audience, it would be very

11

difficult to maintain that that was not sectarian.

12

QUESTION:

But how about using half a prayer or

13

a third of a prayer?

14

word sectarian to draw this distinction, would it be

15

sectarian if simply selected phrases had been taken out of

a traditional liturgy and rearranged and otherwise

incorporated into fresh material?

MR. COOPER:

I mean would -- is your using the

Your Honor, I don't see how anyone

19

could compose a prayer that did not include phrases that

20

had been used by different sects.

number of different sects, they would have the very

definition of a nonsectarian prayer.

could be given or not.

9

MS. BLANDING:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I think

10

that public school education, as this Court has already

11

recognized, doesn't fall into the Marsh kind of analysis

12

to begin with, because the facts relating to the history

13

of public education are different than the facts relating

14

to legislative prayer.

QUESTION:

Suppose that at this graduation the

rabbi was present and he stood up before the main

commencement speaker and said, I've been asked by the

principal, on behalf of all the clergy here in -- in

2

That's true, Your Honor.

From

the record you don't know that.
Not only does the city's argument ignore the

3
4

essential nature of this case, but the city urges an

5

interpretation of the Establishment Clause which would set

6

the stage for radical changes in the relationship between

7

Government officials and religious institutions.
The coercion test that the city suggests has

8

been repeatedly rejected by this Court because in its
10

brief, the city suggests that the Establishment Clause

11

proscribes only the use of Government force or funds to

12

aid or inhibit religious practices.

13

Indeed, in its brief, the city openly suggests

14

that Government officials may participate in religious

15

debate, and that Government speech cannot amount to

16

coercion of religious -- religious liberty to the extent

17

that the Establishment Clause is implicated.

18

If this Court were to adopt the standard that

1

the city proposes, then graduation ceremonies in public

20

schools could open with a Roman Catholic mass.

21

long as the graduation ceremony was voluntary in the sense

22

that children were not obligated to attend, then that

would -- that practice would pass Establishment Clause

1

there is nothing to prevent a Government official from

2

standing up and saying that this is a Christian country

3

and that non-Christians are doomed to everlasting

damnation.

5

If speech alone, absent compelled attendance,

6

does not warrant the protection of the Establishment

Clause, then decades worth of cases which this Court has

decided, dealing with prayer in the public school setting,

must fall; Abington v. Schempp, Engel v. Vitale -QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor --

And if that's the -- I don't

But I do suggest to the Court that even if the

1

2

Court were to examine this particular set of facts under a

3

coercion argument, that in fact what the school department

4

did here was coercive towards the graduating

5

children, just as the voluntary prayer in the classroom is

6

coercive.

7

The mere fact that this is removed from a

8

classroom and takes place at a public school function

9

instead of in the school building on a class day doesn't

10
11

change the essential nature of the case.
QUESTION:

Well, is that a product of the manner

12

in which the graduation is held, and the freedom to come

13

and go - - or lack of freedom to come and go - - or is it

14

because of the sophistication of the children or the

15

adolescents, so that the effect of them is going to be

16

different from the effect on legislators who may be

17

standing here, or anyone in this courtroom who may be

18

standing here and hearing God save the United States?

19

MS. BLANDING:

It is a combination, Your Honor,

20

of all of those factors.

This, in a sense, all of the

Establishment Clause cases that this Court deals with are

I think, Your Honor, that may be

But I still think that if you analyze that

case under the traditional tests that this Court has used,

22

and under the endorsement test, that the message that's

being conveyed to the audience is still a message that

favoring religious expression.

MS. BLANDING:

1

I think the message to college

seniors, Your Honor, would still remain under the

3

endorsement test, that the school officials that

4

are -- that are putting on and organizing the graduation,

5

if they are choosing a clergyman, as happened in this

6

case, if they are suggesting to the clergyman -- as

7

happened in this case also -- the school officials told

the clergyman what kind of prayer he could say.

Do you think making the decision turn

cases?
MS. BLANDING:

9

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

I think

that the Lemon test has, in essence, stood the test of

time.

Although it is sometimes difficult to apply, I

11

don't think the coercion test is any easier to apply.

12

The Court, in the area of criminal law, for

13

example, has always wrestled with the issue of when a

14

confession is coerced and when it is voluntary.

15

in that scenario, the age of the people involved is

16

important.

And even

17

I think that the National School Board

18

Association makes the point better than I could make it in

19

its amicus brief, which is that if this Court -- that

20

school officials and communities and parents have relied

21

on this Court's analysis under the Lemon test for decades.

22

MS. BLANDING:

Pardon, Your Honor?

The court below turned it on effects.
Yes, the court below addressed

12

the effects argument, and did not address the purpose

argument.

QUESTION:

Well, tell me how do you think that

the primary effect of what went on at this ceremony is to

advance religion?

MS. BLANDING:

Well, Your Honor --

Is it or not?

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. BLANDING:

The way that I am --

Is it, or not?
Well, I understand -- the way I

12

understand it, Your Honor, it is that the Court views the

13

endorsement test as part of the effects prong of the Lemon

14

test.

15

effect of having a school prayer --a prayer delivered at

16

a public school function, that the effect and the message

17

that's conveyed to the primary audience -- which is the

18

schoolchildren -- is that public school officials are not

19

only endorsing religion, they're endorsing a particular

20

religious message that is being delivered by this

21

particular clergy whom they have chosen.

22

And I think that the message that is conveyed, the

QUESTION:

Ms. Blanding, do you subscribe to

23

that version of the Lemon test which says that the primary

24

purpose and effect must not be to advance religion, or to

25

the other version that says that a primary purpose or

depending on whether we want to uphold or not to uphold.

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

5

MS. BLANDING:

Which one of the two do you like?
Your Honor, under either

6

analysis, I think that the primary purpose and effect in

7

this case, of the school department's practice, is to

8

advance religion.

9

statement of facts that was submitted to the court below

There is nothing in the agreed

10

that suggests the Government's purpose in including prayer

11

in part of the school's commencement exercises, and not

12

including them in other of the school's commencement

13

exercises.

14

The Government makes the argument that by

15

including prayer they are merely acknowledging religious

16

tradition.

17

fact that prayer is the -- is inherently religious.

18

not simply a passive acknowledgement, as the display of a

19

nativity scene, or the display or a menorah may, in some

20

circumstances, be passive acknowledgement.

21

It is worship.

22

However, this Court has always recognized the
It's

It is active.

To say that any vocal prayer is merely an

23

acknowledgement of religious traditions is to diminish the

24

value of that prayer.

Furthermore, I don't think that it is possible

to devise a nonsectarian prayer that covers all people and

2

all religious beliefs.

3

more diverse than it was when it was founded in terms of

4

the religious beliefs of its citizens that it is virtually

5

impossible to devise a prayer which encompasses the

6

beliefs of all of those citizens.

7

This country has become so much

With regard to the effect of including a prayer,

8

as I stated earlier, the message that must be given by

9

public school teachers who have chosen a particular

10

clergyperson and have brought him into a public school

11

function to deliver a prayer is that the public school

12

is -- at the very least -- saying that prayer is a

13

preferred practice.

14

message to nonadherents and nonbelievers that their

15

religious beliefs are not as important, that they are

16

outsiders, and that the public school system does not

17

belong to them in the same way that it belongs to

18

believers.

QUESTION:

And by doing so, they are giving a

Why doesn't a Thanksgiving

proclamation do that?
MS. BLANDING:

And why is that any worse?
A Thanksgiving -- I think under

22

its facts, Your Honor, a Thanksgiving proclamation is much

23

different than a prayer which is delivered to a specific

24

audience of children in a school setting which is as

25

controlled as this one.

The Thanksgiving proclamation is

not really delivered to any specific audience.

2

I'm not sure that there is anyone that would have standing

3

to bring such a case before the Court.

4

QUESTION:

In fact,

But if you're talking about making

5

people -- you know, if that's the test, whether people are

6

made to feel like outsiders, if you're going to use an

7

endorsement test, is there anything that's more of an

8

endorsement than a Thanksgiving proclamation -- which

9

virtually every President has issued?
MS. BLANDING:

10

Your Honor, I think that, again,

11

there are some Marsh elements, or in some sense the

12

Thanksgiving proclamation is more like Marsh and has some

13

more of the elements of Marsh than this particular case

14

does.

15

QUESTION:

I don't see what a controlled

16

classroom environment has to do with endorsement.

17

see what it has to do with coercion, not with endorsement.

MS. BLANDING:

I can

I think that in terms of the

19

message that is being given to the audience, the primary

20

audience, the whole set of facts around a graduation

ceremony are relevant to the endorsement inquiry.

this case is essentially a school prayer case.
