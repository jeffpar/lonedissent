ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ROBERTS:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case is here from the United States

11
12

District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

That

13

court ruled that the Secretary of Commerce could,

14

consistent with the Constitution and the Census Act,

15

include Federal personnel stationed abroad, primarily

16

servicemen and servicewomen, in the State-by-State

17

apportionment count on which the allocation of

18

representatives is based.

19

hold that the Secretary's method for doing so with respect

20

to the 1990 census was arbitrary and capricious, in

21

violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.

The court went on, however, to

The Secretary relied primarily on home of record

data in Defense Department files, as had been done in

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, may I interrupt you at

this point.

has no choice of which State to list his home of record.

8

It has got to be the State in which the person then

9

legally resides?

10
11
12

I think you have made the point clear, but it

it is correct that when a person enlists, that person

MR. ROBERTS:

The instructions say you must list

your permanent home or actual home at time of enlistment.
QUESTION:

So that the suggestion that somebody

13

could simply list a State whose tax laws he found

14

attractive is not true?

15

I take

MR. ROBERTS:

That is not true.

Taxation is

16

treated with a different concept, legal residence.

17

Someone can have a home State in one State and declare a

18

legal residence for tax purposes elsewhere.

19

suggestion that home of record is subject to manipulation

20

for tax purposes is not true.

21

the joint appendix, page 151 where that is clarified.

22

But the

I would refer the Court to

Now, based on its finding of a violation, the

23

district court ordered the executive branch defendants not

24

to count the nearly 1 million Federal personnel stationed

25

abroad in the apportionment count at all.

It ordered that

1

a new statement be sent to Congress specifying the number

2

of representatives to which each State is entitled, and it

3

ordered the clerk of the House to send to the governors

4

new certificates telling them how many representatives

5

their States were entitled to.

6

decision below will shift a representative from the State

7

of Washington to Massachusetts, only the second time in

8

the 200-year history of the census that any such relief

9

has been ordered.

If allowed to stand, the

The first time was last fall with the

10

district court's decision in the Montana case which this

11

Court reversed last month.

12

The decision here should meet the same fate:

13

first, because judicial review is unavailable under the

14

APA; second, even if review is available, the Secretary's

15

decision to allocate personnel abroad to their home of

16

record is not arbitrary and capricious; and third, even if

17

there is a violation of the APA, the appropriate remedy is

18

a remand to the Secretary, not judicial reapportionment of

19

the House of Representatives.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, as I understand the

21

respondents in their briefs, they also make a claim that

22

the Constitution itself is violated, and I suppose that

23

would have to be resolved apart from any APA claim.

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

We believe, Your Honor, that the

constitutional claims are also barred by the commitment of

this matter to the Secretary's discretion.

We recognize

2

that this Court in Webster against Doe indicated that

3

there may be a higher level that needs to be shown.

4

in Webster, the constitutional claim was a personal right,

5

extrinsic if you will, from the matter that Congress had

insulated from judicial review.

8

are in large part indistinguishable.

But

Here, that is not the

The constitutional claim and the statutory claim

QUESTION:

9

Well, what does the Constitution mean

10

in requiring an enumeration and in referring to the whole

11

number of persons?

What do you suppose that meaning is?

MR. ROBERTS:

12

Well, assuming there is review, an

13

enumeration is exactly what took place in this case.

14

Secretary didn't estimate the number of servicepeople

15

abroad.

16

that.

17

not 811.

18

The

It didn't take a sample and then extrapolate from
The Secretary counted them, 918,810, not 809 and

Now, the Secretary counted them from forms, but

19

that is how the census is conducted by and large.

When

20

you get a census form in the mail, it asks you to fill it

21

out, or the head of the household, and state how many

22

people are living at that home.

23

spouse, three children, the form is returned.

24

Bureau counts from that form, but that is still an actual

25

enumeration.

sufficient, for example in the case of a prison, to ask

And even if, in the

It is still an actual

It is not an estimate.

The other constitutional provision to which you

9
10

referred, the original clause, the respective numbers of

11

the States, the Fourteenth Amendment in each State, I

12

think both sides agree that what the framers are referring

13

to are inhabitants.

14

to conclude, using the words of the first Census Act and

15

the Census Clause, that servicemen abroad can still be

16

considered as belonging to the respective numbers of their

17

home States.

18

And the question is, is it rational

I think the answer to that is clear.

Madison

19

knew what an inhabitant was.

He was involved in drafting

20

the Census Act, and he said it includes someone who is

21

absent for a considerable period on public business,

22

certainly an apt description of our troops abroad.

23

tested in the case of Minister Forsythe in 1824, our

24

minister to Spain who was elected from Georgia to the

25

House.

His election was challenged.

It was

1

an inhabitant of Georgia.

You have been in Spain, and the

2

House said, his absence abroad on public business did not

3

deprive him of the status of an inhabitant, and the same

4

should be true of a private serving overseas in Korea.

5

The review of both the constitutional claims and

6

the administrative law claims is barred by the Census Act.

7

The APA says that if a matter is committed to agency

8

discretion by law, there is no review.
QUESTION:

9

Well, what if the Secretary were to

10

do some wholly arbitrary act like counting people who live

11

in Massachusetts as part of the population of the State of

12

Washington?
MR. ROBERTS:

13

I think in any case in which the

14

argument is that judicial review is precluded, you can

15

come up with hypotheticals that seem to call for

16

corrective action.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes -But that is not enough to

19

establish that the exception to review doesn't apply or

20

otherwise it would never apply.

21

exception to judicial review this Court recognized in

22

Webster.

23

every left-handed person was a threat to national security

24

and dismissed them, that would be absurd, but it still

25

would not be subject to review.

For example, there is an

Now if the director of the CIA decided that

1

One point that is important to consider in

2

discussing this is how likely is it that the absurd or

3

extreme case will go uncorrected.

4

situation in which that is extremely unlikely.

5

pays attention to the conduct of the census very

6

carefully, too carefully I think according to my brother,

7

and they certainly pay attention to the reapportionment of

8

the House of Representatives.

We think that this is a
Congress

This is a situation where

the political branches can be expected to correct for
10

11

extreme cases of the sort you hypothesized.
QUESTION:

But under your theory of the case, it

12

is not necessary to do so, but what do you think the

13

agency action would be here?

14

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I am not sure.

The only

15

conceivable final agency action is the Secretary's report

16

to the President of the tabulation of population by

17

States, which certainly doesn't provide a suitable case

18

for judicial review.

1

stating Massachusetts has 15 million people --

20
21
22

QUESTION:

All that is required is a document

And in your view, is the President

authorized to correct that?
MR. ROBERTS:

Absolutely; he has the obligation

23

to take care that the law be faithfully executed.

24

could decide, he could be, say I have always believed that

25

the usual residence rule should never be departed from and

He

1

I disagree.

Send me some statistics without apportioning

2

servicemen abroad.
QUESTION:

3

He has that obligation.
So then I guess the next possibility

4

is the President's transmittal of the data to Congress as

5

the agency act?
MR. ROBERTS:

6

Yes, except that the President is

7

not an agency subject to suit under the APA, and I don't

8

understand Massachusetts to challenge that submission

9

here.
The next step would be Congress, and that is how

10
11

the process has traditionally operated.

case.

16

was to specify that the conduct of the census, the

17

Secretary will conduct the census in such form and content

18

as he may determine, pursuant to the constitutional grant

19

to Congress to conduct the census in such manner as they

20

shall by law direct.

The action they took years ago in the Census Act

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, I know the President is

not covered by the Administrative Procedure Act, but do

you really think that that means that there is no review

24

whatever of Presidential actions?

25

1

reviewable because the APA doesn't cover him?

2

MR. ROBERTS:

3

QUESTION:

Well, he --

I agree, he is not reviewable under

4

the APA, but might he not be reviewable in some other

5

fashion?
MR. ROBERTS:

6

Theoretically, in a purely

7

ministerial task, by mandamus, but this is not a purely

8

ministerial task, and there is no suggestion that there is

9

any other basis for suit here, other than the APA.
So his part in this process, which is key, the

10
11

Secretary's statement doesn't entitle a State to anything.

12

It is the President's statement by law which entitles a

13

State to that number of representatives unless changed by

14

Congress.
QUESTION:

15

When the APA refers to agency action,

16

don't you think it means action binding upon private

17

individuals somehow?

18

meant.

19

else, even the filing of a report by the President with

20

Congress, does that constitute agency action?

Can it be the filing of a report with somebody

MR. ROBERTS:

21

I always thought that is what it

Not in the sense, for example, as

States an entitlement to a certain number of

2

representatives, and yet that is insulated from review

under the APA.

Now the district - -

5

QUESTION:

I am a little puzzled by it; how far

6

can the President depart from what the Secretary's report

would show?

8

Massachusetts three extra seats without any factual basis

9

or anything, just I think that is a good State and they

10
11

Could he just say, I think I will give

ought to have three more seats.
MR. ROBERTS:

The law directs him to apply, of

12

course, a particular mathematical formula to the

13

population figures he receives, but I don't think there is

14

a limit on his exercise of authority to direct the

15

Secretary of Commerce to conduct the census in a

16

particular manner.

17

subject to judicial review, but unlawful just to say,

18

these are the figures, they are right, but I am going to

19

submit a different statement.

the Secretary in the conduct of the census.

21

QUESTION:

It would be unlawful, maybe not

But he can certainly direct

But would he have to remand it in

22

effect to the Secretary or could he say, well, I have had

23

somebody over at the FBI making some checks for me and

they tell me there are really more people in

25

Massachusetts, so I am going to give them extra seats.

spelled out in the law, and that indicates that that is

the mechanism for review, not judicial review of any of

the thousands upon thousands of judgments that went into

13

the underlying census figures.

14

Now the district - -

15

QUESTION:

If by law the President's action were

16

final, would that be reviewable?

17

MR. ROBERTS:

18
1

No, it would not because he is

not an agency subject to review under the APA.
QUESTION:

But the President can't seize the

20

steel mills or withhold tapes either, but his actions are

21

subject to review in those instances.

MR. ROBERTS:

1

I think that is right, because the

2

statutory scheme which indicates his statement is to go

3

before Congress - -

4

QUESTION:

But my hypothetical was that his

5

action was conclusive.

6

MR. ROBERTS:

It is conclusive unless reviewed

7

by Congress, and my submission is that by providing for a

8

special mechanism for congressional review, and the

9

historical fact that that is how Congress has reviewed it,

10

indicates an intent to preclude review of that interim

11

step in the transmission process.

12

Now, the district court in this case relied

13

heavily on the usual residence concept for its law to

14

apply, the concept that people should be counted for

15

purposes of the census where they live and sleep most of

16

the time as of census day.

17

exceptions to that principle time and time again.

18

Boarding school students are not counted where they live

and sleep most of the time, they are counted at their

2

except by passing a new law?
MR. ROBERTS:

3
4

No, the requirement is for them to

pass a new law.
QUESTION:

5
6

Is there any way that Congress can not accept it

Both houses, plus the concurrence of

the President?
MR. ROBERTS:

7

Right.

Now that is a way, of

8

course, that Congress can change anything, by passing a

9

law.

10

QUESTION:

Right.

11

MR. ROBERTS:

However, they have specifically

12

provided in the census and in the Apportionment Act for a

13

mechanism, and it is a historical mechanism, for this to

14

lie in Congress and to be addressed in a particular period

15

so that they can take action.

16

QUESTION:

But no single house of Congress can

17

just look at this stuff from the President and say this is

18

junk, and we are not going to proceed on this basis.
MR. ROBERTS:

19

No, it has to be, as the statute

says, a subsequent statute that has to be enacted.

In other words, the usual residence concept

9

cannot provide law to apply in considering this case,

10

because this is a departure and modification of the usual

residence rule, as has been historically done in a variety

of circumstances including, of course, most prominently in

13

1970 when again, Federal personnel abroad were apportioned

among the States based on home of record.

principle that we ought to keep our word.
MR. ROBERTS:

5

I don't think that undercuts our

6

position.

First of course, representations or statements

7

of counsel are not part of the administrative record, and

8

what needs to be reviewed is the administrative record.
But secondly, all that the counsel was saying is

9
10

that the Secretary had made a commitment.

He had made a

decision, the commitment referred to is simply the

12

decision in the administrative record.

more question.

When you say that the President's action

against the President?

it is the warden's action, yes.

But the only point I am

21

making is that there is no action against the President

of appeals held recently, and as I said, I don't

there is no review of the President's action under the

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. GOLANN:

Very well, Mr. Roberts.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Secretary has argued that he has virtually

12

13

unbridled discretion to conduct the decennial census

without review by any court.

15

16

constitutional and statutory mandates.

17

We disagree.

The

The Constitution and the statutes which mirror

18

its language require three things of the apportionment

census.

20

is, the Secretary must actually count the population on a

21

State-by-State basis.

First, it requires an actual enumeration.

That

Second, it must be a decennial census.

All of these criteria -- actual enumeration,

10

QUESTION:

Well, do you think the word actual in

11

the Constitution changes the meaning of enumeration and

12

gives that noun a meaning it wouldn't otherwise have if

13

the word actual weren't in front of it?

14

MR. GOLANN:

We believe so, Your Honor.

We

15

believe that enumeration has been historically understood

16

and applied consistently except for overseas employees in

17

1970 and 1990 to require, as the Seventh Circuit recently

18

observed, a head count of the population, not a

statistical sampling or estimation.

implemented by a head count, actual census-taking of the

Or at least all the important

2

alternatives, and the obvious other alternative was

3

returning to the historic practice, which was, as I say,

4

to count them as Americans -- in fact, apportion them the

same way as the domestic military, where they were living

6

on the date of the census and not where they had lived

7

years or decades before.
The lower court concluded that this complete and

8

unexplained failure to consider an important alternative
10

violated the standard of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers and

11

was arbitrary and capricious.
I should note that this Court should not be

been suggested in the Secretary's brief.

that every State will file suit in every decennial census

QUESTION:

MR. GOLANN:

At all.

Why is that preferable?

That is preferable because the

4

decennial census is a snapshot, and a snapshot of the

5

population on April 1990, and that didn't happen.
QUESTION:

6

Why is that snapshot closer to -- in

7

focus than the snapshot of using stale data but at least

8

some data?
MR. GOLANN:

9

Because for one thing it involves

10

the problem - - and this was the reason for some other

11

variations from usual residence of double counting.

12

People would be counted one place in 1990, they'd be

13

counted a different place in 1992, and that would be one

14

problem.

15

be that as a practical matter it couldn't happen.

The other problem,

You will note in the record that when the

17

Secretary did conduct a minor enumeration of 60,000

18

civilian employees, only 20 percent of them ever returned

19

their questionnaires.

20

military in Your Honor's hypothetical,

21

response rate will be so low that it will simply not be an

22

enumeration.

QUESTION:

Now that they have left the

So that no data except that gathered

24

on essentially an account made every 10 years will ever

25

suffice on your theory.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

8

reason the Court should be hesitant to conclude that

9

judicial review is available is the consequences.

10

That

One

My brother says it's not going to be a big

11

problem, it's always just going to be between number 435

12

and number 436.

13

number 440 on the list and you look, and you see if the

14

undercount litigation comes out one way, you move up to

15

438, and then if litigation about how foreign personnel

16

should be counted moves you up to 436, and then you need

17

to look very carefully at how many boarding schools you

18

have in your State to see if there are enough of those,

19

that's a departure from the usual residence rule to bring

20

you up to 435.

21

That's not true at all.

If your State is

You have to file that lawsuit even though

22

another State the same day is going to file a lawsuit

against the Secretary for not counting American citizens

you down again, and all of this litigation is going to be

going on while the States are redistricting, while

2

candidates are considering whether to run, while primaries

3

are taking place.

4

The point is that the conduct of the census and

5

the reapportionment is not suited to a case-by-case

6

judicial review of each one of the thousands upon

7

thousands of judgment calls that go into the census.

8

That's particularly true when you consider that it's done

9

in a limited time and on a limited budget.
The district court looked at one decision - - how

10
11

to allocate Federal personnel overseas -- and concluded

12

that an actual survey would have led to more accurate

13

data.

14

on that.

15

to more accurate data only at a great increase in cost.

16

The Secretary determined that the additional accuracy, if

17

any, was not worth the cost.

18

QUESTION:

That may or may not be true.

The record is unclear

But even assuming it's true, it would have led

There's no standard --

Mr. Roberts, do you think we have to

19

vote this method of enumeration up or down to decide this

20

case?

21

MR. ROBERTS:

Absolutely not.

I think the Court

22

should conclude that the decision of the Secretary is

23

committed to his discretion by law and therefore not

24

subject to judicial review.

25

QUESTION:

What if we don't agree with that?

Couldn't we say -- couldn't we decide this case by saying
that well, it may be all right, but the Secretary has not

3

done a very good job of telling us why, and then we would

just send it back.

MR. ROBERTS:

your view, you should still reverse because this matter

was not remanded to the Secretary.

Now, Massachusetts has no trouble treating these

inaccuracy in not counting is okay.
