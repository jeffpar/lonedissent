ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Eighth Circuit, in this case, invalidated a

11
12

regulation issued by the Secretary of the Interior in 1986

13

to interpret the geographic reach of the first sentence of

14

section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

15

That sentence provides that each Federal agency,

16

in consultation with the Secretary, shall ensure that any

17

action it authorizes, funds, or carries out, is not likely

18

to have either one of two consequences:

19

an endangered or threatened species or, second, adversely

20

modify habitat that is determined by the Secretary, after

21

consultation with affected States, to be critical for the

22

species.

23

first, jeopardize

The Secretary, from the outset, has construed

24

the portion of section 7(a)(2) that concerns critical

25

habitat of a species not to apply in foreign countries,

1

because the reference to affected States gives it a

2

domestic focus, and because application in foreign

3

countries would present practical difficulties and impose

4

this Nation's environmental laws and land use planning on

5

foreign countries.

6

below have challenged that construction.

7

Neither respondents nor the courts

In the 1986 interpretive regulation at issue

8

here, the Secretary concluded, for similar reasons, that

9

the portion of the same sentence that concerns actions

10

that affect the species themselves likewise does not apply

11

in foreign countries.
The court of appeals invalidated that

12

13

interpretation, thereby setting aside the uniform

14

interpretation of not only the agencies charged with

15

administering the act, but also the agencies engaged in

16

furnishing assistance to foreign governments for projects

17

in their countries.

18

The court of appeals erred in two fundamental

19

respects.

20

the merits of the validity of the regulation, because the

21

respondent organizations do not have standing to challenge

22

it.

24

actual or threatened injury as the result of U.S.

their ability to view wildlife.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, how does the citizens'

suit provisions affect the standing inquiry?
MR. KNEEDLER:

In the first place, we think the

5

citizen suit provision is inapplicable in this case

6

because that refers to situations generally where persons

7

alleged to be in violation of the act.

8

interpretive regulation, which he wasn't even required to

9

issue in the first place, in our view, does not fall

10
11

The Secretary's

within the citizens' suit provision.
The provision that addresses the Secretary's

12

enforcement responsibilities, which is what respondents

13

seem to be directing their suit to, does not govern this

14

sort of regulation.

15

regulations under section 4 of the act.

16

place, we think the citizens' suit provision is

17

inapplicable here.

18

It governs a specific category of
So in the first

But moreover, the citizens' suit provision, as

19

this Court has made clear in Sea Clammers and other cases,

20

cannot extend the standing -- the jurisdiction, case or

21

controversy requirement -- jurisdiction under the case or

22

controversy requirement beyond that specified in this

23

Court's cases.

24

So the - -

provide that abridgement of the right that Congress has

2

given would constitute injury.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, what would be -- to be

4

sure, if the statute defines a statutory right .and then

5

says that a person may sue for a violation - -

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

Yes.
--of that right, then standing

would result because Congress has defined the right.

9

But this -- the citizens' suit provision does

10

not define any substantive rights.

11

said in Valley Forge, the APA provision, giving any person

12

aggrieved a right to sue, does not define substantive

13

rights, it simply creates a cause of action.

14

Just as this Court

So respondents would be required to look

15

elsewhere in the Endangered Species Act for any

16

substantive rights that they would seek to invoke in this

17

case.

18

At one point, respondents were arguing that they

19

had certain procedural rights to have one agency consult

20

with another regarding projects in foreign countries.

21

we pointed out in our petition and brief, that holding by

22

the Eighth Circuit to that effect was inconsistent with

23

every other court of appeals that has considered it.

24

respondents do not, as we understand it, defend it here,

25

because procedural rights can only be invoked by persons

As

And

1

who have a substantive stake in the agency's decision.
So unless respondents can show that some of

2

3

their members had an actual stake in a foreign project and

4

were injured there, the fact that there might be

5

procedural provisions under the act would not be

6

sufficient to give them standing.

7

So to come back to your question, and argue this

8

case does not arise under the citizens' suit provision.

9

It's essentially an APA challenge to a regulation.

And as

10

such, as a -- if the A - - regulation is the agency action,

11

this Court has made clear, just two terms ago in the

12

National Wildlife Federation case, that unless a statute

13

specifically provides for a -- challenge to a regulation

14

as soon as it's issued, ordinarily a person has to wait

15

until the regulation has been applied to his particular

16

case.

17

QUESTION:

Well, I understood the respondents to

18

argue that section 7(a)(2) provides that each Federal

19

agency shall consult with the Secretary when action or

20

funding is likely to jeopardize the continuation of an

21

endangered species.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And they think that is the

24

substantive right that they're seeking to enforce under

25

the citizens' suit provision.

MR. KNEEDLER:

1

Well, if an agency that was

2

otherwise required to do so did not consult or took action

3

that would jeopardize a species, that would be a violation

4

of the act.
But again, respondents have not sued an action

5
6

agency, seeking prevent what they claim would be a

7

violation of the act by that agency - - the engaging in a

8

project in a foreign country without the necessary

9

consultation.

10

They've sued the Secretary of the Interior, who

11

has simply issued an interpretive regulation stating what

12

he believes to be the content of the section 7(a)(2)

13

requirement.

14

cannot require another agency to consult with the

15

Secretary about a project.
So whatever may be the case in a dispute about a

16
17

But the - - but the Secretary of the Interior

particular project, which, again, we don't have here --

18

QUESTION:

We did.

Do you think that the

19

citizens' suit provision would enable a citizen to sue

20

because the --a Federal agency had failed to consult?
MR. KNEEDLER:

21

It would confer a right of

22

action.

But again, the article III standing requirements

23

would have to be met.

24

there are three essential standing requirements that, even

25

under a citizens' suit, a plaintiff has to meet.

And as this Court has made clear,

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

First, the plaintiff must show that he has

1
2

suffered some actual or threatened injury; second, he must

3

show that that injury is fairly traceable to the

4

challenged action; and third, he must show that that

5

injury -- there's a likelihood that that injury will be

6

redressed by a decision in his favor.

7

And we've shown in our brief that respondents

8

here satisfy none of those requirements with respect to

9

any of their members in foreign countries.
Respondents, in their brief, focus on two of

10
11

Defenders' members in an effort to establish

12

standing -- excuse me, focus on five.

13

appeals found standing only on the basis of two.

14

rejected the third, Mr. Plowden, on the ground that he

15

hadn't even gotten within 200 miles of the project in

16

18

appeals didn't even address it.

And any nexus that the remaining two might have

So this case -- respondent's standing would

20

depend entirely on the ability to establish that two

21

members that the court of appeals focused on had standing

22

in their own right.

23

These two are Joyce Kelly and Amy Skilbred.

24
25

And those two members fail each step.

Joyce Kelly's entire basis for standing is one

Kelly makes no allegation that on her visit to the Nile

3

River in 1986 she was harmed at all in her viewing of any

endangered species.

In that -- in her affidavit, Joyce

All she says was that I will suffer

And with respect to future injuries, she says I

7

will suffer harm as a result of U.S. Bureau of Reclamation

8

assistance in rehabilitating the Aswan Dam Hydroelectric

9

Power -- Power Plant.

There's no indication in her

10

affidavit, or in the Bureau of Reclamation report which

11

she references, that that rehabilitation would have any

12

effect, whatever, on an endangered species, and

13

specifically, the Nile crocodile.

14

Moreover, Joyce Kelly has not shown that she

15

actually has firm plans to return to Egypt.

16

is that I have observed the traditional habitat of the

17

Nile crocodile, and I intend to do so again.

Now -- so she hasn't shown either actual injury

1
2

in the past -- she didn't claim it -- or future injury.

3

Because, as this Court has said, with respect to

4

threatened injury, the threat has to be real and

5

immediate.

6

impending -- which suggests that any injury has to be

7

immediately forthcoming.

8

allegation or assertion that Joyce Kelly makes here, that

9

she intends to return sometime in the. future, falls far

The injury has to be certainly

The sort of vague, unspecific

10

short of that necessary to establish a concrete threat of

11

future injury.
QUESTION:

12

What would -- could she possibly

13

satisfy?

14

she said they're going to be building the dam until 1991

15

and she plans to go back in 1990, or something.

16

that have been enough?

17

What if she'd actually seen some crocodiles, and

MR. KNEEDLER:

Would

Well, first of all, the mere fact

18

that she visited in the past is not, alone, enough, as

this court said in Lyons.

QUESTION:

Well, how could the injury -- I mean,

4

the project is going to take several years to complete.

5

And she couldn't be injured -- her theory is that she's

6

injured by the completion of the project, as I understand.

7

It may kill off the crocodiles.

8

And if she's seen crocodiles the last time, she

9

says sometime a couple of years from now, she wants to go

10

back and take pictures of them and make studies, that

11

wouldn't be enough?

Is that an injury that's

23

It is the sort of injury, yes,

any more than she thinks there's a danger that if you

2

don't consult and you don't avoid the environmental hazard

and so on and so forth, the crocodiles may become extinct,

and I can't see any more crocodiles?

MR. KNEEDLER:

She would have to show both that

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, she would have to show, at

12

least, that there was a likelihood of some -- of some

adverse impact.

15

That's the standard that triggers the

So if she's relying just on injury to the

16

species, rather than her use of the land, which she's not

17

alleging here -- just injury to the species, she would

18

have to show some injury to the species.

19

But beyond that, she would also have to show --

2

3

affirmative burden of establishing injury as a result of

4

the project.

She has to - - she has the

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

That's not

At least a likelihood of injury,

6

we submit.

And again, the -- under this Court's standing

7

doctrine, the Court has reiterated just last term, the

8

Court presumes it doesn't have jurisdiction unless it

9

affirmatively appears in the record, and it's up to the

10

person invoking the jurisdiction of the Court to show the

11

injury.

12

So in this case, she has to show some injury.

13

And a risk to animals does not translate into injury to a

14

human being.

15

QUESTION:

Wouldn't she also have to at least

16

suggest how the Bureau's -- Bureau of Reclamation's

17

involvement in this dam might hurt the crocodile?

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, she would.

She would have

19

to show that if she was challenging the project itself --

20

again, she's challenging a regulation, which is even one

21

more step removed.

22

regulation -- I mean the project -- she would have to show

23

that the injury is fairly traceable to the Bureau of

24

Reclamation's assistance, and would be likely to be cured

25

by either a withdrawal of the assistance or consultation,

But assuming she was challenging the

1

or at least by the withdrawal of the assistance.
And that she can't show, both because the Bureau

2

3

of Reclamation is an independent actor.

4

we have here foreign sovereigns who have it within their

5

own power, as respondents concede, to go forward or not to

6

go forward, to seek funding from other sources.

7

So - - but going back to the - -

8

QUESTION:

9

But beyond that,

She is not challenging the repair of

the Aswan -- the specific project.

She is just

10

challenging a regular --an interpretive regulation issued

11

by the Secretary of the Interior.

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

That -- that's correct.

And the

13

same thing is true with Amy Skilbred, with respect to the

14

Mahaweli project.

And they have used these two projects as being

But the fact that the respondents have

22

challenged the Secretary's regulation, and the court

23

entertained the suit in that context, really converts the

24

court of appeals' disagreement with the Secretary's

25

interpretation into nothing more than an advisory opinion.

Because these respondents do not - QUESTION:

Would it be part of -- would it be

3

part of her burden to also prove that the foreign

4

government could no get financing elsewhere?

5

guess it's always -- there's always a possibility that the

6

government could build its own dams and all the rest of it

7

without American money.

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

10

Because I

Well, the --

Would that be part of her burden?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, it would.

And in fact, when

11

it comes to the actions of a foreign country, we think

12

that as a matter of law, she could not show that, for

13

reasons derived from this Court's act of state and

14

political question doctrines.

15

presume to decide and receive evidence on the question of

16

whether a foreign sovereign is likely or not likely to

17

undertake a project on its own soil with -- seeking other

foreign assistance.

19

A U.S. court should not

But beyond that, under this -- under this

20

Court's decisions in Allen v. Wright and Simon v. Eastern

21

Kentucky Welfare, even in a wholly domestic context, the

22

Court has made clear that, at the very least, the

23

plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the actions of

24

a third party are so likely to happen that the injury will

25

be redressed by the relief.

And respondents have fallen

In fact, this is a particularly improbable case

for that can be obtained from what is the closely parallel

7

Weren't they due to a change in the

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, what -- the opinion itself

8

states that the precipitating factor or the basis in the

9

statutory text was the 1978 amendments to the Endangered

10

Species Act, which simply reconfirmed the domestic focus

11

of section 7.

only to affected States.

13

Section 7 as originally passed referred

And yet the Court found that to be -- to be

insufficient to overcome the presumption that the act does

not apply.

Again, the burden is on the respondents in this

5

case to show that Congress affirmatively intended the act

to apply overseas.

history of section 7(a)(2), and nothing in the background

specifically intended section 7(a)(2) to apply overseas.
That, in our view, is the end of the matter, as

13

it was in ARAMCO because an affirmative indication is

that Congress was aware of it, much less that it wanted

QUESTION:

But particularly in this

No, I know there's no affirm -- I'm

just asking if there's a presumption that Congress knows

what the law is.

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't know that it's a

11

presumption in the sense that it's a legal presumption

that operates here.

There is an assumption, I guess, in

certain situations.

But I think that that -- that that

background is simply not involved here.

decision to retain language in the Senate bill.

The respondents

Well, what the Senate bill was proposing to

19

delete, that the conference report language refers to, was

20

the whole reference to consultation between agencies and

21

the Secretaries.

22

Well, that's -- that -- that perhaps inadvertent

deletion of the whole consultation process is something

quite different from suggesting that Congress intended to

Again, the reference in section 7(a)(2) of the

act, itself, to affected States, gives that section --

gives that sentence a domestic focus.

4

here, are trying to make the improbably argument that

5

Congress, in another portion of the very same sentence

6

intended the agency's obligations to have a vastly

7

different geographic reach, since the critical habitat

8

portion of that sentence concededly does not apply in

9

foreign countries.

And respondents

Yet, they're arguing that the

10

protection for the species, themselves, the species that

11

would use that habitat, does apply in foreign countries.

12

It's also important to point out the practical

difficulties and serious interference with foreign

relations that would result from applying section 7(a)(2)

in this setting.

16

discussed recently in the dissenting opinion in ARAMCO

presumption in that case, acknowledged that where an act

apply.

They may

So even if he - - even if he withdrew this

MR. O'NEILL:

The Justice -- I would assume

that, if this Court rules, that's the end of the subject.

The Secretary will issue a regulation, the agencies will

As to whether there is a possibility on the

1

outskirts of reality that the agencies won't comply, the

3

answer to that is there is a possibility.

4

extremely unlikely.

5

But it is

I'd like to talk for a minute about the statute.

6

The statute that's at issue is essentially the fourth

7

iteration of the Endangered Species Act.

8

iteration issued in '66, an iteration issued in '69.

9

iteration in '69 created a listing process.

10

There was an
The

And under the

'69 statutes, species throughout the world were listed.
So that in 1973, Congress was writing against an

11
12

Endangered Species Act that listed species throughout the

13

world.

14

recognizes that the U.S. has pledged itself as a sovereign

15

state-in the international community, to conserve various

16

species of wildlife.

The 1973 act, in section 2, the Congress

17

Section 4, which deals with the listing of the

18

species, requires that both foreign and domestic species

19

are listed.

20

Secretary lists foreign species.

And there's no question about that.

And the

21

Section 7(a)(2), which is at issue, and which

22

was written against the backdrop of the 1969 Endangered

23

Species Act which listed species worldwide, says each

24

Federal agency -- it doesn't say each Federal agency

25

except the State Department -- shall consult with the

doesn't say any agency action in the United States --

funded or carried out as not likely to jeopardize the

4

continued existence of any endangered or threatened

5

species.

6

species in the United States.

It doesn't say any endangered or threatened

7

But again, that section, in '73 when it was

8

passed, was passed against a backdrop of listing of all

9

species, both here and abroad.

When the act was amended

10

in 1978, and that's why I said that there were essentially

11

four versions of the act that we're talking about, the

12

Secretary's position was that section 7 applied worldwide.

QUESTION:

May I stop you there, for just a

moment?

MR. O'NEILL:

QUESTION:

Is the authority for that the

guideline that's in pages 28 to 30 of the joint appendix,

QUESTION:

MR. O'NEILL:

Section 9 provides a series of

8

prohibitions about taking species outside the U.S., about

9

engaging in international trade outside the U.S.

10

My answer to the argument, though, is section 9

11

shows you that when Congress wanted to limit the scope of

12

the statute to the United States or to the high seas, or

13

to the United States, the high seas, and a foreign

14

country, it did so in the structure of section 9.

15

In section 7, they use all-encompassing

language -- any agency action, any endangered species.

the lesson that I draw from section 9 is different than

So then doesn't that -- isn't

that a response to your most recent argument?
MR. O'NEILL:

9

It is a response, but if you look

at the totality of the action decision being made, it is

11

more of a United States action decision than it is a Sri

MR. O'NEILL:

15

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

I have several points.

First on the question of

12

standing, the Secretary of the Interior did not take the

13

position in 1986, just as we do not take the position

14

today, that the interpretive regulation is binding on

15

other agencies.

16

in which we say that the preamble to the 1986 regulation

17

stated that the Fish and Wildlife Service performs only,

18

quote,

19

quote, and that the action agency makes the ultimate

20

decision as to whether its proposed actions will comply

21

with the act.

I refer the Court to page 6 of our brief,

"an advisory function under section 7," close

QUESTION:

22

Yeah, but that doesn't --it doesn't

23

reach the question of whether there's -- they're bound to

24

consult.

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but the -- this is an

QUESTION:

The Secretary of the Interior,

The Secretary cannot make

Your colleague on the other side said

6

that at one time, the Secretary took the position that the

7

agency is bound to consult, if he has a regulation that

8

they have to consult.

9

You haven't answered that yet.
MR. KNEEDLER:

10

No, the best evidence that they

11

did not is the fact that respondents have not pointed to,

12

and we are not aware of a single instance in which

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

1

The statutory duty is mandatory.

2

The question is whether the Secretary's interpretation of

what the statute means - -

4

QUESTION:

But if the statute clearly applied to

5

foreign projects, then there would be a mandatory duty to

6

consult.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right, but that's not -- that's

8

different from saying the Secretary's interpretive

9

regulation is binding on the agency.

Whatever binds the

10

agency is the statute, itself, not what the Secretary says

11

about it.

12

QUESTION:

But would the -- would this

13

Secretary's interpretation of the statute be entitled to

14

deference from other agencies?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, it would be entitled to

16

deference the same way as any others.

17

1986, while the prior regulation was in effect, agencies

18

did not consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service.

QUESTION:

But from 1978 to
