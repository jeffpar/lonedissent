ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. CLAPP

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLAPP:

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue presented in this case is whether a

10
11

district court, in determining a reasonable hourly fee, a

12

reasonable fee award under Federal fee-shifting statutes,

13

may enhance that award above the lodestar amount in order

14

to reflect the fact that plaintiff's attorneys have taken

15

the case on a contingent fee basis, thus assuming the risk

16

of receiving no attorney's fees at all, and this case the

17

district court denied a preliminary injunction motion and

18

ultimately issued an order on the merits which denied all

19

of the relief sought by the plaintiff and granted relief

20

limited to the ratification of a preexisting state court

21

order.

st

22

\

On that basis, when determining the reasonable

23

attorney's fees to be awarded to the plaintiffs, the

24

district court concluded to award the full lodestar amount

25

and in addition a contingency bonus or enhancement to

1

reflect the fact that plaintiff's counsel had taken the

2

case on a contingency basis.

3

The decision that the enhancement award was in

4

order was based upon the bizarre conclusions that in the

5

first place the plaintiff's loss of the preliminary

6

injunction motion somehow entitled plaintiffs to be

7

compensated at a greater rate, not only with respect to

8

the effort expended with respect to the preliminary

9

injunction motion and other claims that were lost, but

10

with respect to all hours devoted to the case.

11

the court based its decision on its determination that

12

plaintiff's attorney who brought and prosecuted the case

13

with no guarantee of an enhancement was nevertheless

14

entitled to the enhancement award.

15

Secondly,

This case, we submit, demonstrates an example of

16

the Hensley lodestar method of fee calculation run amuck.

17

Our response to the precise issue presented to the Court

18

is first, no enhancement for a, of a lodestar fee to

19

reflect risk of lost contingency should ever be granted,

20

for the reason that any such award of an enhancement is

21

necessarily speculative and contrary to the evidence of

22

the market's response to risk of loss assumption as

23

demonstrated by the evidence before the Court.

24
25

QUESTION:

How about that it's contrary to the

fee-shifting statute?

It's also

for that reason,

contrary - -

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CLAPP:

Shouldn't you start with that?
Well, the fee-shifting statute

5

provides, of course, that fees should be reasonable, and

6

this Court has determined on several occasions that -QUESTION:

7
8

It only provides for fees when you

win - MR. CLAPP:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MR. CLAPP:

That's correct, Your Honor.
-- not when you lose.
Precisely the point that we were

12

raising with respect to the basis for this Court's

13

determination, that it is absolutely bizarre -QUESTION:

14

And if you're getting enhanced when

15

you win, you're getting enhanced and being paid for when

16

you lose.

17

MR. CLAPP:

18

QUESTION:

19

question, isn't it?

20

MR. CLAPP:

That's correct.
That's just a plain old statutory

We would certainly contend that it

21

was, Your Honor.

The respondents, we anticipate, will

22

argue that on the basis of economic theory that despite

23

what the facts show the enhancement should be available in

24

order to encourage the bringing of these types of lawsuits

25

in general.

QUESTION:

1

And the arguments for both sides are

2

pretty well set forth in the various opinions for the

3

Court in the second Delaware case, aren't they?
MR. CLAPP:

4

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

5

difficulty with the various opinions set forth in the

6

Delaware case is that both -- that's a major problem, of

7

course, but I will address my comments for the moment

8

Otherwise you wouldn't be - Otherwise we wouldn't be here today.
And you wouldn't be being paid to be

here.

13

MR. CLAPP:

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. CLAPP:

That's correct.

Very true.

I would like to address my

16

observations, if I could for a moment, to Justice

17

O'Connor's concurring opinion and the dissenting opinion

18

in Delaware Valley II.

1

remarks by pointing out that this Court determined in

20

Delaware Valley I, or set forth in Delaware Valley I in

21

Justice White's opinion, that the whole purpose for this

22

Court's selection of the Hensley method of fee calculation

23

was to avoid, was precisely to avoid the sort of arbitrary

24

and capricious conclusion that enhancement of an otherwise

I would like to preface those

The difficulty, it seems to me, with both the

1

2

concurring opinion and the dissenting opinion in Delaware

3

Valley II is that neither of those opinions address the

4

difficult issue that arises when a court attempts to

5

venture beyond its role as a fact-finder and to begin

6

enunciating policy.

7

QUESTION:

8

Mr. Clapp, may I ask a question to

show my ignorance of this whole area of the law?

Where

did the term lodestar come ‘from in this context?
MR. CLAPP:

10

Your Honor, I understand that the

11

term lodestar was coined by the Third Circuit in its early

12

development of the method of fee calculation that refers

13

to a base of all hours expended on a case, reasonably

14

expended on a case, times the reasonable hourly rate.

15

Beyond that, I cannot explain the derivation of the term.

«

16

QUESTION:

It always struck me as a strange kind

18

MR. CLAPP:

It struck me as a strange term, too.

QUESTION:

of a term.

But it nevertheless was adopted by

this Court, wasn't it?

MR. CLAPP:

The term was adopted by this Court.
Well, we do do strange things.

MR. CLAPP:

1

The method that is'referred to by

2

the term that was adopted by this Court was a modification

3

of that Third Circuit approach that had been developed

4

prior to that time.

5

QUESTION:

In computing the lodestar, now that

6

we know what it is, you do take market parses into

7

account, do you?
MR. CLAPP:

8

My understanding of that, Your

Honor, is that the market determines what the reasonable
10

hourly rate to be used in calculating the fee is.
QUESTION:

11

What if an economist could convince

12

us, and I probably couldn't, that the market is different

13

in a free market when you're just charging clients and you

14

don't have Government mixing into the thing, the market

15

pays a little more when there's a contingency involved

16

than it does when there's no contingency involved?

c

17

MR. CLAPP:

Assuming that such evidence could be

18

developed, then that evidence would simply be evidence of

1

what the market rate is in that particular market.

20

QUESTION:

And then it would indicate that the

21

contingency factor would be reasonable, I guess, because

22

within the higher --

23

MR. CLAPP:

It would simply indicate that to

whatever extent that market compensates for contingency,

that figure is already reflected in the, in that market

hourly rate.
QUESTION:

On the lode, because the lodestar

assumed when it is worked out that there is a, that if
there has been a contingency factor, it was taken into
account in computing the lodestar?
MR. CLAPP:

It was taken into account by the

market in determining what the market rate was, and the
courts should be limited to simply determining what that
market rate is.
QUESTION:
is it?

But it isn't the fact of contingency,

It's a question of how difficult the issue is and

what kind of skill it takes to win.
MR. CLAPP:

The definition of the risk of loss

is complicated, Your Honor, and I would address that
question specifically by saying whether, or the extent of
the risk of loss in a particular case is a function not
only of the complexity of the issues advanced, and to that
extent the plaintiff controls that issue by the extent of
the relief that is granted, or requested in a case like
this.
QUESTION:
MR. CLAPP:
QUESTION:

Mr. Clapp -Yes, sir, Justice Blackmun.
I have a question.

Perhaps I should

direct it to your opposition, but isn't there a state law
claim remaining in this case for which damages are

MR. CLAPP:

2

There certainly is, Your Honor.

3

There is a state law claim remaining on the face of the

4

complaint for $1 million.
QUESTION:

5
6

How does that affect the outcome of

this argument?
MR. CLAPP:

7

Well, assuming, Your Honor, that a

8

rational support for fee enhancement, lodestar fee

9

enhancement, could be constructed, I think amicus, the

10

American Bar Association and this Court in other occasions

11

has recognized that a fee arrangement between plaintiff

12

and their counsel may have the effect of reducing whatever

13

risk would otherwise be inherent in a particular case.

14

Thus in this case, as we understand plaintiff's

15

arrangement with their attorney, if the plaintiffs are

16

successful in establishing a right to a fee award in this

17

case, that will be the limit of the compensation that they

18

receive.

19

compensated on a percentage fee basis for any work that is

20

performed in this case, assuming that they are successful

21

in establishing their state related claims to damages.

22

If they are not, plaintiffs will still be

QUESTION:

Assume that we say that contingent

23

fees are inappropriate and that the court is concluding a

24

lodestar fee and the court hears expert witnesses or

25

considers an affidavit, and the testimony is that in cases

of this kind since recovery is uncertain the hourly rate

is generally $50 an hour higher than other hourly rates.

Should that be included in the lodestar amount?

MR. CLAPP:

We think not, Your Honor.

lodestar is not a reflection of what a particular supplier

in the market hopes to obtain.

contend under the Hensley lodestar method, should reflect

It should be, and we

repeat, what a particular attorney hopes to receive.

-- the $50 an hour increase.
Well then are we engaged in a

circular enterprise no matter which way we rule?
MR. CLAPP:

To the extent that the Court becomes

20

involved in trying to parse the elements that a particular

21

market rate reflects, my answer to Justice Kennedy's

22

question would be that there is no need for the Court to

23

get involved in that parsing.

prevailing market rate.

1

Well, should the market be defined as

2

the market for attorney's fees generally and not just for

3

fees of cases of this type,.so that if you were the trial

4

judge you'd ask a defense firm what they charge an

5

insurance company by the hour and use that as the rate?
MR. CLAPP:

6

The question before a court in any

7

fee-fixing case, fee-shifting case, is what is the

8

appropriate market rate to use.

9

The evidence that the

10

particular market's compensation rate might include how

11

much attorneys generally charge for the provision of

services.

14

having similar skills.

The precise question would be how does the

QUESTION:

Well, if there's no objection to the

16

trial court taking into account the discrete market which

17

consists of those who undertake representation in cases of

18

this type, and if that discrete market includes an

19

enhanced hourly rate for the contingency factor then it

seems to me it makes no difference what we rule in this

case.

We might as well rule against you and have it all

that the lodestar method adopted by this Court

contemplates.

There is no relevant

Could I test that with you just a

QUESTION:

Against the background of what

alternatives are available in the market.
MR. CLAPP:

But that -- understand, Your Honor,

10

that in these sorts of cases, in fee-shifting cases, the

11

client is going to have no interest in limiting his

12

attorney's compensation where the case is on a contingency

13

basis, because he's not going to pay it anyway.

It's

14

going to be someone else who will pay that fee.

He might

15

as well agree to a rate of, in your example, $200 an hour.

QUESTION:

No, but I'm assuming he would, you

17

try to make him -- you would make the statutory fee be one

that would be a duplicate of what would have been

do you think just the lawyer just cooked it up out of thin

air?

these two alternative ways of computing a fee?

QUESTION:

Well, it did when I was in practice.

8

MR. CLAPP:

-- Your Honor, but it would not be

the result of free market operation.
10
11

It would be the

result of negotiations between that party and his client.
QUESTION:

But your argument assumes that if the

12

client had hung tough and said no, $25 is as high as I'm

13

going to go, he would have taken the case anyway on a

14

contingent fee.

15

only if you win, that he would have taken the case anyway.

And that's -- I mean, I don't think we can make that

17

assumption, can we, if we are fact-finders?

If the client had said, you know, $25

MR. CLAPP:

It's not necessary to make that

assumption.
QUESTION:

Maybe what you're saying is go ahead

and make that assumption and see what happens, and if it

turns out that nobody takes these cases, then maybe you'd

better modify your assumption.

MR. CLAPP:

1

Well, and my response to that should

2

be, Your Honor, is that if in fact the market rates are

3

insufficient to attract counsel, then Congress should make

4

decisions about what steps it wants td take to enforce its

5

policy.

It shouldn't be the courts -QUESTION:

6

Well, isn't the problem with that

7

response that Congress, I thought, gave the courts the

8

responsibility for determining a rate that would in fact
attract?

10

MR. CLAPP:

21

I'd like to begin by addressing the question

that has arisen already as to what hourly rate a court

2

the outcome.

3

not impossible to find lawyers in the market who tell

4

their clients I will charge you $25 an hour if you're

5

willing to pay regardless of whether we win or lose, but

6

if you want me to take this on a contingency basis then

7

I'm going to charge you $40 an hour.
QUESTION:

So as a practical matter it is difficult if

What about the situation which

certainly was more common at the time when I practiced,

10

I'll either take it so much an hour if you're good for the

11

fee, win or lose, or else I'll take one-third or one-

12

half, you know, not always one-half, of the recovery if we

13

win?

How does that fit into the picture?

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. SEAMON:

I think that that is still the

16

prevailing practice, that when a lawyer takes a

17

contingency, makes a contingency arrangement he contracts

18

with the client for some percentage of the ultimate

19

recovery.

20

Now, Justice Stevens raised the question well,

21

what if you can get an economist to come in and say I have

22

looked at all of these contingency arrangements and I have

23

decided that in fact they end up amounting to $40 an hour

of compensation for the lawyers rather than 25.

We would

charge $40 to his Client, but the fairness in that

instance resides on the fact that it is the product of the

consensual arrangement between the plaintiff and his

very different.

12

QUESTION:

Well then when you say a fee is fair

13

in the sense of the $40 fee, you mean it's fair by virtue

14

of the fact it was consented to, and not by virtue of the

15

fact that it represented market?

16

MR. SEAMON:

That's correct.

Or to put it

17

another way, the fact that it is consensually agreed to is

18

what makes it the market, you know, what the market calls

for and what the market will provide.

6

of this sort, assuming we're outside this sphere of cases.

7

The $40 is still the market figure, isn't it?
MR. SEAMON:

8

Yes, it may be possible to

9

establish a market figure that prevails in the private,

10

unregulated market, but to apply that in the context of

11

fee-shifting is to say that the defendant should pay not

12

on the basis of what he did that led to the lawsuit but on

13

the basis of what arrangement the plaintiff has made with

his client.

MR. SEAMON:

No.
I mean, isn't it the nature of a

contingent fee that it depends enormously upon how good

the case looks to the lawyer?

That's right.

that doesn't strike me as likely.

MR. SEAMON:

1

Not as a separate matter, Justice

2

Kennedy, because the difficulty of the case is going to be

3

reflected both in the hourly rate that a lawyer of the

4

adequate experience is able to charge as well as the

5

number of hours expended in litigating the case.

6

Presumably the more difficult the case, the harder it will

7

be to litigate, the more hours expended, and the higher

8

the lodestar.
QUESTION:

10

What about the probable merits of the

case, the probability of success?
MR. SEAMON:

11

No, we think that the probability

12

of success is irrelevant in calculating the lodestar and

13

also should be irrelevant as a separate matter --

14

QUESTION:

I take it most of the circuits are in

disagreement with that proposition and most of the

circuits do include probability or likelihood of success

that?

I just want to emphasize the first point that,

2

even assuming we get beyond these evidentiary difficulties

and decide that in fact the contingency market charges $40

plaintiff has made with his attorney, and we don't think
10

that Congress intended the term reasonable attorney's fee

11

to mean different things depending simply on what

12

arrangement the plaintiff has made with his attorney.

13

And in fact this Court rejected a similar view

14

of congressional intent in Blanchard v. Bergeron where it

15

held that the amount of the fee cannot be determined by

16

whatever contract the plaintiff has made with his

The same principle operates here.

1

including the court in this case, has held that this

2

arrangement, this contingency arrangement that was in fact

3

made is a basis for enhancing the lodestar fee by 25

4

percent.

5

Beyond the evidentiary problems, and we think

6

the unfairness problem that this confronts or assumes that

7

Congress intended, there are a number of fundamental

8

conceptual difficulties with the market theory that is

9

driving our opponent's position.

In our view one

10

essential flaw is that it assumes that litigation under

11

fee-shifting statutes should operate in the same way as

12

litigation does in the private market.

13

very existence of the fee-shifting provision radically

14

alters the way the litigation will proceed, as this Court

15

recognized in Evans v. Jeff D.

But in fact the

16

In a fee-shifting case there is this prospect of

17

a lodestar or some sort of award sitting at the end of the

18

litigation that will influence the way a defendant

19

considers litigating the case and influence the

20

defendant's judgments about making a settlement or not.

21

That same dynamic doesn't operate in the typical

22

contingency case where the plaintiff in a personal injury

23

suit, for example, pays the same amount as a judgment

24

whether the plaintiff has a contingency arrangement with

25

his attorney or not, and if there is a contingency

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The court, as courts do,

2

sometimes reject experts, sometimes reject testimony and

3

sometimes accept it in part.

4

QUESTION:

And of course --

Does it involve, doesn't it involve a

5

court deciding what the degree of risk is?

6

going to enhance for risk, I suppose you'd give a

7

different enhancement for a small risk and a bigger one

8

for a larger risk.

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, this court --

Is that right?
I'm not sure if the question

12

goes to what this judge did or if it's a general question

13

that you're asking me, Justice White.

No.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

2

Excuse me.

We think that the

approach suggested by Justice O'Connor in Delaware Valley

enhancement should be awarded, and if so, the degree of

Yes.

done in this case, and again the issue of how it should be

QUESTION:

Well, if you thought it ought to be

done according to Justice O'Connor's opinion, which would

22

have come out with 2.0, you should have cross-petitioned

And the

1

only issue that's before this Court is whether enhancement

2

for contingent risk can be taken into account under any

3

conditions by the local courts like this judge did.

4

Let me just add one other thing to answering

5

your question, Justice White, and that is unlike some of

6

the technical issues that were before the court in this

7

case, that is the extent of the toxic waste in this

8

particular dump and how it was impacting on the Burlington

9

marketplace, which I don't think the local judge, I may be

10

wrong, had any particular knowledge about, determining the

11

legal marketplace and appropriate and reasonable

12

attorney's fees is something t*hat, as this Court has said

13

on a number of occasions, that courts have familiarity

14

with.
Justice Stevens referred back to his experience

15
16

in private practice.

Judge Billings has a lot of

17

experience as a state court judge, as a Federal court

18

judge, as a practitioner in the local marketplace in

19

Burlington.

this standard as Congress has done in many other statutes.

2

To name just a couple, in the Individuals with

3

Disabilities in Education Act Congress said no bonus or

4

multiplier may be used in the calculation of the

5

reasonable attorney's fees.

QUESTION:

Some of those limitations that

12

Congress put in later statutes were in response to the

13

emerging fee jurisprudence of this Court, were they not?

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, I think yes, Mr. Chief

15

Justice Rehnquist, but I think it goes to prove our point

16

rather than undercut it.

18

was passed in 1986.

21

passed the Superfund law amending, CERCLA, to put in a

24

Congress put in the Superfund law the exact same

1

statutes before this Court, the Clean Water Act and RCRA.

2

And I think when you take all of these statutes

3

together you come to a conclusion that Congress, under

4

these statutes where it did not put limitations on

5

reasonable attorney's fees, meant for the market to

6

govern, and that contingent risk may be taken into account

7

under appropriate circumstances.

8

Justice Scalia's statement in Casey I think is

9

right to the point, where the Court said a comparison of

10

statutes is proper because statutes are construed to

11

contain that permissible meaning which fits most logically

12

and comfortably with the body of both previously and

13

subsequently enacted law.

14

QUESTION:

It's harder to do that when the later

law is a specific response to a judicial decision that has

that the judicial decision was wrong, in which case they

19

would have meant without that qualification what they

meant in the earlier statute.

I may be an indication that that Congress thought

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

1

I'm not trying to say that's a

2

direct relationship with Casey, it's just the principle.

3

But I think my answer to Chief Justice Rehnquist's

4

question still applies, and that is Congress certainly

5

looked with open eyes to the possibility of contingency

6

fee enhancements after a certain point and decided to

7

include such enhancements in some statutes and not in

8

others.

9

Court, Congress decided not to place a restriction.

10

And let me just add one other part to it.

In a statute very much like the ones before this

11

were restrictions on fees that Congress put in prior to

12

1972 and prior to when anybody, as far as I know, heard of

13

the term lodestar.

14

QUESTION:

contingencies.

what we're talking about here.

could be reasonable with limits, but with other acts, such

17

as the ones before this Court, a reasonable attorney's

the limit of the discipline of the marketplace.

.All we are saying is that as this Court has

directed local courts to look at the marketplace to

resolve these other questions which can be difficult, the

Court should also direct lower courts to look at the

of non-payment.

The last part of my argument is that Justice

O'Connor's test, which borrows in significant part from

Justice White's opinion in Delaware Valley, is workable.

Not only is it workable, but it has worked.

standard and feels that it should apply to this case even

it should remand the case.
Justice O'Connor's test we believe provides the
answer to a lot of the legitimate concerns raised by
Justice White in the opinion in Delaware.Valley.

Justice O'Connor suggest, contingent enhancement is based
upon a comparable class of cases, then the discipline of

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, the Congress addressed

that problem, and that's one of the reasons there are
attorney fee statutes in a case like this in which there,
it principally is focused on an injunction to close the

particular, and I'm now referring to the legislative

history of the 1976 Civil Rights Act which courts have

looked to, cases that present a comparable difficulty,

And the term reasonable attorney's fees has, as

17

I have discussed, been used to focus the courts upon the

19

In conclusion, local courts have discretion to

20

consider the risk of non-payment as a part of reasonable

attorney's fees.

22

just as local courts consider other aspects of the award

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

11

Justice White, I would disagree

12

with you on that, but the important point is that Congress

13

has decided that question and determined that only

14

prevailing parties obtain fees.

15

coupled with Justice O'Connor's test, is that the

marketplace forces attorneys to weed out the less worthy
