ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE E. MECKLER

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9
10

MR. MECKLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

my it please the Court:
There are two questions presented in this case.

11
12

The first question dealt with the right to a jury trial

13

under title I of the Labor Management Relations Disclosure

14

Act, LMRDA, and that particular issue has been conceded by

15

the respondent, and as a result, I don't intend to argue

16

the merits of that issue.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MECKLER:

19

Well, it seems to me the most

appropriate thing to do
QUESTION:

20
21

Do you want us to rule on it?

Well, what if we disagree with both

of you?
MR. MECKLER:

22

Well, I understand that's

23

possible.

24

remand, reverse and remand on that issue.

25

I think the most appropriate thing to do is to

with you.
MR. MECKLER:

2

The court below did disagree with

3

us.

I think there's a -- the point I'm trying to make is

4

that the matter should be remanded to the circuit court

5

in light of the concession, and in light of Terry, let

6

them reconsider the issue.
QUESTION:

7

Well, I think that we're wanting to

8

deal right now with the argument before this Court.

9

think you'd be quite justified in saying that you submit

10

that matter on your brief and save a little time for

11

rebuttal.
MR. MECKLER:

12

13
14

Fine.

I

That's what I'll do, Your

Honor.
Moving then to the second question presented,

15

which is, does section 301 of the Labor Management

16

Relations Act create a Federal cause of action under which

17

a union member may sue his union for violation of the

18

union constitution.

19

the statute mean something.

20

cause of action is created in this particular situation.

21

And this is a case where the words of
And what they mean is that a

Now, the language of the statute in pertinent

22

part are as follows; suits for violations of contracts

23

between an employer and a labor organization or between

24

any such labor organizations may be brought in any

25

district court.

The first question that must be answered,

1

of course, is whether a union constitution is a 301

2

contract.

3

this Court in the affirmative in the Plumbers case.

4

And that question has been answered already by

The second question which we then must move on

5

to is, can a nonsignatory to a 301 contract between unions

6

sue to remedy a violation of that contract, and can they

7

sue under 301.

8

answered that question in Smith v. Evening News, and

9

answered it in the affirmative.

And in essence, I think the Court has also

10

Admittedly, Smith v. Evening News dealt with the

11

other half of this statute, the two halves being contracts

12

between a labor organization and an employer and contracts

13

between labor organizations.

14

talking about contracts between a labor organization and

15

an employer, a nonsignatory who in that case who had

16

benefits arising out of that contract could bring suit

17

against the employer in that case.

18

Smith held that when we're

The same principle is just as applicable in this

19

case.

20

any basis for differentiation in the treatment of

21

collective bargaining agreements, the first type of

22

statute -- excuse me, the first type of contract defined

23

in this statute, and union constitutions, the second type

24

of contract defined in this statute.

25

There is no language in the statute that suggests

Now the Smith court made it clear that the

2

case, any labor organizations referred to contracts and

4

language.

5

between any such labor organizations may be brought in

6

district court.

7

is a violation of one of these types of contracts.

8

Therefore, a cause of action, a Federal cause of action,

9

exists to remedy that violation.

10

The statute is very open-ended in its
It says, suits for violations of contracts

What we have here is a claim that there

Now there are a number of policy reasons which I

11

suggest to the Court lend weight to our position in

12

addition to the language of the statute, which is clear,

13

Plumbers, which is clear, and Smith v. Evening News, which

14

is also clear.

15

hold that union members may bring suit under 301 against

16

their union for violation of union constitutions?

What are some of these policy reasons to

17

First of all, it's been long determined by this

18

Court that when we are in the area of 301, 301 contracts,

19

that substantive Federal law must apply.

20

Court's determination way back in the Lincoln Mills case,

21

and a long line of precedent following Lincoln Mills.

22

there's good reason for that, particularly in this

23

context, because of the uniformity that applying Federal

24

substantive law brings to the process.

25

That was this

And

Uniformity in the context of the enforcement of

1

a 301 contract, in this case a union constitution, brings

2

to us predictability, it brings to us labor stability.

3

It's far better from a policy perspective to have

4

decisions made on interpretations of union constitutions

5

which may apply to as many as all 50 States, and in this

6

instance, in this case it does, to be determined by a

7

uniform policy of Federal law rather than determined by 50

8

different State courts.

If it were determined by 50

different State courts, we could have many different
10

interpretations and we would be creating chaos.

The whole

11

purpose of the Lincoln Mills concept is to do just the

12

opposite of that.
Now in addition, the application of Federal

13
14

labor law principles should not depend on who happens to

15

file suit.

16

and certainly under Plumbers, a local union has the right

17

to sue an international union on a union constitution, an

18

international union has the right to sue a local union on

1

a union constitution under 301.

There are different -- if that were to occur,

If that were to occur, and individual members

20
21

were not permitted the right to sue under 301 on this

22

situation, we would end up with different meanings for the

23

same constitutional provision depending upon who happened

24

to sue.

25

shopping, which is something that we should try to avoid.

That would also lead, I'm sure, to forum

1

And it would lead to uncertainty and lack of

2

predictability and a destruction of labor stability.

3

Now another policy consideration that I think

4

the Court should look to is the fact that oftentimes in

5

these kinds of cases, LMRDA claims, and that certainly, in

6

this instance it's the same situation -- LMRDA claims are

7

intertwined with claims of a breach of a union

8

constitution.

Frequently, in LMRDA claims, the question

of constitutional interpretation, interpreting the union
10

constitution, comes up in many instances.

The courts have

11

always assumed that in rendering that interpretation, they

12

must look to Federal law to make a determination.
Now if we're in a situation where there is no

13
14

Federal cause of action in this context, are we going to

15

have claims involving intertwined claims of LMRDA

16

violations, union constitution violations, whereby on some

17

of those provisions, in some instances the court makes a

18

determination based on Federal law, yet on the same

1

constitutional provisions, the court makes a determination

20

based upon State law?

21

lot of sense.

Mr. Meckler, do you think Congress

members?

MR. MECKLER:

of the statute itself.

If Congress has chosen to indicate a

Federal policy, such as Justice O'Connor was inquiring

about, to Federalize, they could have equally well done

19

MR. MECKLER:

Well, I suppose that's true, but

20

as the Court looked at in Plumbers, the -- it's very clear

21

that at the time of the passage of section 301 back in

22

1947, union constitutions were the primary form of

contracts between labor organizations.

those very words.

suggests congressional intent --

That choice of words, it seems to me,

QUESTION:

You think the principal thing

Congress had in mind in the Taft-Hartley Act when it

defined the term were union constitutions?

MR. MECKLER:
principal thing.

I don't think that that was the

I thought from what you said a moment

MR. MECKLER:

No, Your Honor, I didn't mean to

11

suggest that.

12

Congress had in mind when it chose the language that it

13

chose in section 301.

14

additional evidence of that in the statutory language

15

itself, and that is section (1)(b) of the act,

16

29 U.S.C. 141(b), where Congress is talking about the

17

purpose of the statute and indicates that one of the

18

purposes is to protect the right of individual employees

19

in their relations with labor organizations.

20

I think that it is one of the things that

And I might add there is some

Now, the document that defines relations with

21

labor organizations of individual employees, the most

22

likely document, at least, is a union constitution.

23

seems to me that there is certainly evidence in the

24

legislation itself to suggest that Congress intended to

25

include these types of disputes.

So it

QUESTION:

1

I take it under your view that if

2

there were an auto lease or a lease for a building between

3

one labor union and another, that that would be a 301

4

suit, or am I incorrect about that?

5

MR. MECKLER:

Well, I think there's a question

6

there, to be sure, but the question is a Federal question.

7

The question of whether there is some benefit that's

8

included in the constitution from which the plaintiff

9

derives some benefit, some term in the constitution -QUESTION:

10
11

No, no.

Just suppose one labor

organization sues another over an auto lease.
MR. MECKLER:

12

I believe that probably falls

13

within the language of the statute.

14

here on a union constitution, and this Court has already

15

decided that a union constitution is a 301 contract.

16

type of contract that Your Honor refers to certainly

17

hasn't been decided by this Court yet.

QUESTION:

supports our argument in one respect, and that is that it

2

suggests that matters such as this are matters that are to

be committed to the Federal branch of government, not the

In that case, of course, it

violation, but as a violation of the act.
MR. MECKLER:

10

Well, yes, that's true, but I

11

think the important thing there is that the Court

12

indicated that it's a matter of Federal concern.

13

that's point number one.

14

Now

Point number two is Lockridge preceded Plumbers.

15

I believe that Plumbers changes the landscape because

16

Plumbers tells us that a union constitution is a 301

17

contract.

18

301 at all, never considered whether a union constitution

19

was a 301 contract.

20

that point of view, I would have to distinguish Lockridge

21

on that basis.

22

supports our position.

Now Lockridge never considered the question of

Now we know that it is.

And from

But I think Lockridge in some respects

23

Another point or policy reason, it seems to me,

24

is that the idea of judicial efficiency -- it seems a far

25

better practice for a plaintiff in such a case to litigate

1

the issues all in one forum rather than in two different

2

forums.

3

Finally, I think we need to have a remedy here.

4

We have a union constitution which is the basic document

5

defining the rights of union members, vis-a-vis their

6

union.

7

plaintiffs -- petitioners claim it's violated.

8

circuit court tells us there's no remedy for that

9

violation.

And it's violated, at least
And the

They tell us on the one hand that there's no

10

State contract claim because 301 preempts it.

11

us on the other hand that there's no 301 claim.

12

to be a remedy for this kind of a contractual violation.

13

Otherwise the union constitutions aren't worth the paper

14

they're written on, the protections that they may afford

15

union members are worthless.

16
17
18
19
20

They tell
There has

And as this case stands here before the Court
today, there is no remedy.
QUESTION:

Well, maybe they were wrong about 301

preempting it.
MR. MECKLER:

Well, maybe they were.

I don't

21

understand logically their inference there.

But it seems

22

to me if you look at 301 itself, it's clear that 301

23

includes this type of dispute.

24

of 301 -- as Your Honor was talking about earlier in some

25

of the arguments this morning, the words of 301 I think

are the key to this case.

QUESTION:

3

union and a member?

4

Does 301 mention a suit between a

MR. MECKLER:

No.

Nor does it mention a suit

5

between an individual member or employee and a employer.

6

Nor does it mention a suit between an individual member

7

and a union.
QUESTION:

9

It does mention a suit between two

MR. MECKLER:

10

It does mention a suit -- well, it

talks about -- no, Your Honor, I beg to differ with you

there.

says that suits may be brought for violations of such

14

contracts.

It mentions a contract between two unions, and it

QUESTION:

Exactly.

But it doesn't mention a

contract between a union and a member.
MR. MECKLER:

No, it talks about contracts

18

between two or more labor organizations, I think, is the

19

language of the statute.

20

QUESTION:

Exactly.

21

MR. MECKLER:

And the point being this Court has

22

already decided, in Plumbers, that union constitutions are

23

that kind of a contract, are a 301 contract.

24

it becomes a matter of 301 concern, it becomes a matter of

25

Federal concern, Federal courts' concern.

QUESTION:

Would you be making the same argument

4

if the 301 didn't mention contracts between two or more

5

labor organizations?
MR. MECKLER:

6

I don't think so.

I mean I think

7

that if it did not mention that language, then Plumbers

8

never would have happened and we wouldn't be here today,

9

probably.

10

QUESTION:

Why not?

11

MR. MECKLER:

Why not?

Because the statutory language

defines the bounds here.

organizations, by definition now, include union

constitutions.

QUESTION:

And the bounds include contracts
And contracts between labor

Yeah, but it still doesn't mention

contracts between a union and a member.
MR. MECKLER:

It doesn't mention contracts

19

between a union and a member, but I would suggest to the

20

Court that a union constitution is a contract between

21

labor organizations by virtue of its usage over years, and

22

more importantly by virtue of Plumbers.

23

Plumbers tells us.

25

That's what

I think I'm going to conclude my argument at
this point and reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK G. CLOPPERT, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

5
6

MR. CLOPPERT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

7

The issue before this Court is the intent of

8

Congress in enacting section 301 of Taft-Hartley,

9

specifically the provisions for suits for violation of

10

contracts between any such labor organization and its

11

applications to union constitutions in a situation such as

12

we have here.

14

MR. CLOPPERT:

QUESTION:

16

That is correct, Your Honor.

Although the court of appeals ruled

in your favor?

18

You do concede the jury trial issue?

MR. CLOPPERT:

That is correct.

It was before

this Court came down with the Terry decision.

19

QUESTION:

That's before Terry?

20

MR. CLOPPERT:

21

The state of the law in union constitutions is

That is correct, Your Honor.

22

important.

In 1947, at the time the Taft-Hartley was

23

passed, a union constitution defined two separate types of

24

relationships.

25

international union and a member, and it defined a

the claims in this case is not only for breach of the
international constitution, but also for breach of the

Let me try to clear my mind a second and think of one.

I

can think of one where there's a provision in a
local - - in a constitution, that requires before a
referendum vote is held, before a referendum vote is held,
a mail ballot referendum vote, that the local must conduct
a meeting.

The members must discuss the issue and vote on

whether or not that referendum vote should be authorized.
Okay?
It seems to me if the local were then to go
ahead and conduct a referendum for whatever reasons
contrary to that provision, that local members would
certainly have an interest in that.

Certainly the local

itself would have a clear interest in that.

And the

international which would want its local to be run
according to one, the written constitution, and two, in an
appropriate manner, would have a very strong interest in
that.
I litigated a similar case like that, and that
happens.

That kind of stuff happens all the time.

And it

seems to me that that kind of situation shows us how
unworkable these kinds of categorizations are.
Let me just make another point as far as that
goes.

It seems that the proposition put forth by the

respondents in this case is directly in contradiction to
Smith.

Because what Smith tells us is there's you know,

there's lots of different provisions in collective

2

bargaining agreements, too.

directly to the union, between the union and the company.

4

Some of them may flow to the individual employee.

5

Smith, the Court found that the provisions in question

6

flew -- I mean flowed, excuse me, to the individual

7

employee.

8

9

Some of them may flow

In

Now they're suggesting that if they flow to the
individual employee, there's no Federal cause of action;

10

if they don't flow to the individual employee, then there

11

is a cause of action.

12

QUESTION:

Smith says just the opposite.
Yes, but Smith was -- when you're

13

talking about collective bargaining agreements, you kind

14

of have a presumption based on the whole history of labor

15

law that all collective bargaining agreements have an

16

impact on interstate commerce.

17

presumption applies to every provision of every union

18

constitution, or every contract between two unions.

MR. MECKLER:

I'm not sure the same

20

answers the question and tells us that union constitutions

21

are contracts within the meaning of 301.

goes to the dissent that you wrote in that very case.

the hypotheticals that have been talked about where it's
