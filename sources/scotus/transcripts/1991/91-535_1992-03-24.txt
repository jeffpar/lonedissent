ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR N. EISENBERG

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EISENBERG:

8

‘9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At issue in this case is the constitutionality

10
11

of Hawaii's total prohibition against write-in voting.

12

This case began in 1986.

13

year held in Hawaii with respect to State legislative

14

offices, one-third of those elections were uncontested; a

15

single candidate was running unopposed.

16

In the general election that

And that pattern of uncontested elections was

17

consistent with the pattern that prevailed in the 1982

18

elections and in the 1984 general elections with respect

19

to State legislative offices.
One of the uncontested elections in 1986

20
21

occurred in the State legislative district, the State

22

House of Representatives district in which Mr. Burdick

23

lived.

24

Burdick had no interest in voting for that candidate.

25

did, however, want to participate in the election, and he

A single candidate was running unopposed.

Mr.
He

1

saw his only opportunity to participate as the casting of

2

a write-in ballot to express his opposition to the single

3

candidate running unopposed, and to express support for an

4

alternative candidate.

5

Hawaii, unfortunately, has a total prohibition

6

against all write-in voting in all elections and under all

7

circumstances, and that total prohibition was invoked to

8

bar his right to exercise a write-in ballot.

9

prohibition, therefore, denied Mr. Burdick the opportunity

This total

10

to vote for the candidate of his choice, or in the

11

alternative, to cast a ballot as a protest vote.

12

Moreover, one of the unique functions of

13

write-in voting in our society is that it serves as a

14

safety valve mechanism, to permit voters to respond to new

15

issues or changed circumstances that arise after the close

16

of the petitioning period but before the election.

17

In this case, Mr. Burdick did not realize that a

18

single candidate was running unopposed until the close of

19

the petitioning period and still Hawaii invoked its total

20

prohibition against write-in voting, even to deny the use

21

of the write-in ballot as a safety valve mechanism.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Eisenberg, are you asserting the

23

right just to make a write-in vote for someone who would

24

otherwise be qualified to be on the ballot?

25

MR. EISENBERG:

We think that Mr. Burdick has a

right to vote for somebody who is unqualified as well as

2

for somebody who is qualified.

3

Burdick -QUESTION:

4
5

MR. EISENBERG:

That's right.

In that instance,

the vote would simply be a protest vote, a vote no.

8

10

For someone, who under State law

could not qualify to occupy the office?

6

7

We think that if Mr.

QUESTION:

Donald Duck.

QUESTION:

Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, whatever,

that is fine.

You are claiming that right?

MR. EISENBERG:

11

We are claiming that the

12

individual has a right to vote for Mickey Mouse or Donald

13

Duck.

14

How the State chooses to record that vote is - QUESTION:

I suppose that anyone can write

15

something on the ballot.

16

that, you want the State to have to count it?

17

MR. EISENBERG:

Now you are going further than

Well, there are several things

18

that are implicated in the phrase, count it.

insist that Mr. Burdick has the right to have somebody who

20

is ineligible to hold office, hold office.

21

isn't counted towards the election of that person.

22

We don't

So his vote

But we do think that the right to vote embraces

23

both a right to choose, and if there is no meaningful

24

choice, a right to say no, and if Mr. Burdick chooses to

25

say no by voting for an unqualified candidate or a

should record his vote, we think, as a protest vote.

State has an obligation to record that vote as a protest

vote.

Well, there are several

10

vote as it is written in, so that if somebody votes for a

fictional character, if somebody votes for an unqualified

13

15

QUESTION:

You think the Constitution requires

every State to do that?
MR. EISENBERG:

We think that the Constitution,

16

at the very least, requires that the State acknowledge the

17

protest vote, the vote no.

18

about voting either in support or against candidates, then

19

the vote against a candidate must be recorded somehow.

needn't have a full list --

a question.

1

MR. EISENBERG:

We think that the textual source

2

of our constitutional claim is either the First Amendment

3

or the equal protection clause.

4
5

QUESTION:

Have we ever held that the First

Amendment establishes a right to vote?

6

MR. EISENBERG:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. EISENBERG:

9
10
11

Well, we have --

Have we?
We have used the equal

protection clause to find that there was a right to a
meaningful vote.
QUESTION:

I wasn't asking you about the -- I

12

didn't ask you about the equal protection, I asked you

13

about the First Amendment.

14

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, I think we have talked

15

about the First Amendment right of political participation

16

in a number of cases, and in Anderson against Celebrezze,

17

the Court identified the right to vote, the right to run

18

for office, the right to associate in support of a

19

candidate, all as an amalgam of rights protected by the

20

First Amendment.

21

QUESTION:

Is the theory behind your answer a

22

theory of effective franchise or solely a theory of First

23

Amendment expression, in effect, quite independent of the

24

act of voting?

25

MR. EISENBERG:

I think, Your Honor, it is both.

1

It involves the right to cast a meaningful ballot, which

2

is in some sense, the right of effective franchise.

3

QUESTION:

Well, to the extent that your

4

argument is based on a meaningful ballot kind of argument,

5

why should the standards be any different from -- or

6

perhaps you are not saying they should be, but should the

7

standards be any different from the ballot access cases?
MR. EISENBERG:

8

9
10

We think that the overarching

standard employed by this Court even in ballot access
cases generally is Anderson against Celebrezze which -QUESTION:

11

Do you think under the ballot access

12

cases, we will assume it is some real individual, not

13

Donald Duck, decided at the same time your client did that

14

he would like to be on the ballot and came forward under,

15

given the statutory scheme of Hawaii, that he would have

16

any claim on the ballot access theory?

17

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, we think that he may or

18

may not have a claim under a ballot access theory, but

19

that is because there are very different interests that

20

apply when the State is regulating access to the ballot in

21

a formal printed way.

22

QUESTION:

Well, but the fact is that the

23

ultimate value to be served by ballot access is effective

24

franchise.

25

not merely the interest of the individual who wants to be

I mean, it is ultimately a public interest and

1

on the ballot, and bearing that in mind, number 1,

2

shouldn't the standards be the same whether we are dealing

3

with a person who wants to be on the ballot or the person

4

who wants to write in a name.

5

they should be essentially the same standards?
MR. EISENBERG:

6

Wouldn't you agree that

We do agree that the standards

7

are the same, and the standard is Anderson against

8

Celebrezze.

9

QUESTION:

Now if they are the same standards,

10

isn't it clear that under the Hawaii statute, the access

11

to the ballot is sufficiently free so that the individual

12

who ‘woke up after the primary period and said, gee, nobody

13

is running, I want my name on there, that individual

14

wouldn't have any claim under the -- given the Hawaii

15

statute.

16

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, we think that that

17

individual should have a claim, because we think that

18

write-in voting provides an important safety valve

19

mechanism which should be recognized --

20

QUESTION:

So that you basically want us to

21

expand the law, not merely with respect to somebody who

22

wishes to write in, but you want us to expand ballot

23

access law beyond any point that it has reached thus far.

24
25

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, ballot access law as we

have generally understood it involves regulating the

1

formal printed ballot.
QUESTION:

2

What's the answer to my question?

I

3

mean, you do basically want an expansion of ballot access

4

from anything that our cases have held up to this point,

5

isn't that correct?
MR. EISENBERG:

6

If ballot access is to be

7

defined more broadly, as Your Honor is suggesting, yes,

8

that is correct.
QUESTION:

9

I thought you were accepting that.

MR. EISENBERG:

10

That would be correct, but we

11

think that the overarching standard is the Anderson

12

against Celebrezze standard, which requires in this

13

instance the State of Hawaii to come forward with some

14

showing that the total prohibition that it imposes is

15

necessary to the advancement of some substantial

16

governmental interest, and that is a showing that the

17

State of Hawaii cannot make in this case.

18

showing that the State of Hawaii has not made in this

19

case.

That is a

Hawaii advances four interests in support of its

20
21

claim.

First, an interest in limiting factionalism by

22

prohibiting sore-loser candidacies; second, an interest in

23

protecting political parties against interparty raiding;

24

third, an interest in an informed electorate; fourth, an

25

interest in protecting Hawaii's runaway election

1

provisions.
QUESTION:

2

With respect to each of those

3

interests, do we apply strict scrutiny, rational-basis

4

scrutiny or some other form of scrutiny to assessing the

5

validity of Hawaii's interest?
MR. EISENBERG:

6

We think we apply Anderson

7

against Celebrezze with teeth, which approaches strict

8

scrutiny, which is the standard imposed in Tashjian and in

9

Eu.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Is that under the First Amendment

prong of your argument or under the right-to-vote prong?
MR. EISENBERG:

The Court has in Anderson and

13

most recently in Norman against Reed suggested that while

14

it looks first these days to the First Amendment as the

15

source, as the textual source for the protection of the

16

rights of electoral participation, it would reach the same

17

result under the equal protection clause, and it doesn't

18

much matter whether you call it a right to vote or an

19

equal right to vote.

20

In both instances, we think that Hawaii is

21

obligated to show that the total prohibition is necessary

22

to the advancement of substantial governmental interests,

23

and it has not made that showing in this case.

24
25

The interest in an informed electorate, while a
worthwhile goal, cannot justify Hawaii's blanket
11

1

prohibition, even in circumstances where there are no

2

sore-loser candidates.

3

sore-loser candidates it can enact a narrow sore-loser

4

provision.

If the State is concerned about

The interest in protecting parties against

5
6

interparty raiding has no application whatever to a

7

prohibition that would be extended to a general election.

8

Interparty raiding is a concern about voting in primary

9

elections.

10
11

So again, Hawaii's total prohibition sweeps

too broadly.
We think that there is another consideration in

12

this regard, and that is that at least one of the three

13

established parties in Hawaii, the Libertarian Party, has

14

now expressly requested that voters in its primary

15

elections be permitted to cast write-in ballots.

16

Hawaii, it seems to us, now has a Tashjian problem, a

17

problem confronted by this Court in Tashjian where the

18

State, in that instance, the State of Connecticut, was

19

imposing a restrictive measure on ballot access, and even

20

in circumstances where the party had no interest in the

21

protection that the State was affording it.

So

22

And so for these reasons we think that the

23

interest in protecting against interparty raiding is

24

insufficient in this case.

25

The interest in an informed electorate, again,

while a worthwhile goal, we think cannot be justified

2

here.

3

ignorant way, that concern seems improbable, because it is

4

not likely that somebody is going to vote for somebody

5

that they know nothing about, when you have to actually go

6

to the trouble of casting a write-in ballot.

If the State is concerned about voters voting in an

7

If the concern is for the --

8

QUESTION:

Isn't it likely that a write-in voter

is probably better informed than other voters?
MR. EISENBERG:

10

It is likely that a write-in

11

voter who goes to the trouble of casting a write-in vote

12

is better informed than other voters. *

13

Moreover, if the State were concerned about the

14

body politic in general, that is to say, if the State were

15

concerned that everybody ought to know that are

16

surreptitious write-in candidates afoot, then the State

17

can do, the State of Hawaii can do what approximately 20

18

other States do:

1

file a declaration of candidacy shortly before the

20

election.

it can require that write-in candidates

This mechanism satisfies the safety valve

21

22

concern.

23

after the petitioning process is closed where new

24

circumstances or new issues arise, and it provides that

25

flexibility.

It allows write-in candidates to enter the race

And if the State were concerned about an

1

informed electorate in that regard, informing the

2

electorate that there are other write-in candidates or

3

indeed there are other candidates beyond those who are

4

simply listed on the ballot, Hawaii can do, as I say, what

5

20 other States have done.
Finally, the interest in protecting Hawaii's

6

7

runaway election provisions cannot justify Hawaii's

8

policy.

9

elections in these circumstances, there is no occasion to

To the degree that Hawaii has abolished general

10

cast a write-in ballot, so this last concern about Hawaii,

11

this concern about their provisions with respect to

12

runaway elections, is irrelevant.

13

In fact, Hawaii's runaway election provisions,

14

provisions which permit a candidate who emerges from the

15

primary election as a victor and unopposed for at least

16

county offices and State legislative offices, not to have

17

to stand for election in the general election, that

18

provision argues more forcefully in favor of a right to

19

cast a write-in ballot in these dispositive primary

20

elections, because in Hawaii, given the pattern of

21

uncontested elections, and given these runaway election

22

provisions, the right to cast a write-in ballot at the

23

primary level is very, very important.

QUESTION:

1

May I ask a question, just to be sure

2

I understand your position.

Do you think that Hawaii

3

could prohibit anyone from qualifying for and holding

4

office unless they have followed Hawaii's procedure for
%

5
6

getting on the election ballot?
MR. EISENBERG:

If Hawaii had a write-in

7

candidate registration requirement, a requirement that a

8

write-in candidate declare and if the candidate fails to

9

comply, it seems to us that Hawaii can do what these 20

10

other States do, which is to declare the individual

11

ineligible to hold office.

12

QUESTION:

We have no quarrel with that.

But if it were a -- not a voter

13

standing here today, but someone who would like to be a

14

candidate and hold office, you would take the position

15

that Hawaii's present laws concerning who goes on the

16

general election ballot and therefore who can serve in

17

those offices on the ballot, you would take the position

18

that that is unconstitutional?

19

MR. EISENBERG:

We think to the degree that

20

Hawaii does not provide for the safety valve mechanism of

21

a write-in ballot, to permit the candidate, in Your

22

Honor's hypothetical, to enter the race as a write-in

23

candidate after the petitioning period is closed, which in

24

Hawaii is 60 days before the primary election, 105 days

25

before the general election, we think that Hawaii's

provisions are.too restrictive.
QUESTION:

And how many States have similar

prohibitions against all write-in?

4

five States?

5

MR. EISENBERG:

Is that a total of

There is a total of - - there are

6

four States that by statute prohibit write-ins and we are

7

informed that Louisiana, as a matter of practice, also

8

prohibits write-in voting.

9

QUESTION:

Is it part of your case that the

10

State has to count these votes or does the State just have

11

to allow them to be cast?

12

MR. EISENBERG:

We think that the State has to

13

count the votes, clearly a vote for a qualified candidate

14

should surely be counted.

15

State should have to count the protest vote, the vote no.

16

The State may be able to put it into a broad category of

17

no votes, but the State has to recognize that there is a

18

body of dissenters out there who don't like the choices

19

that have been provided to them.

20

QUESTION:

But we also think that the

Why does it have to provide this

21

forum for the dissenters in its election machine?

22

the State says, gee, it's just a lot cheaper to buy time

for them on some television channel, so election eve,

everybody who wants to vote no will be given time to come

25

in and protest?

about both.

And in fact, this Court has recognized that

9

the electoral process extends beyond simply choosing

10

somebody who is going to get elected.

Celebrezze, this Court recognized the important expressive

aspects of the electoral process, engendering new issues

into the process, in putting forth new ideas.

protest, to use the election as a protest mechanism, is
there?
MR. EISENBERG:

Not specifically, Your Honor.

But the very definition of an election, in our view,
embraces the right to choose and again, if there is no
meaningful choice, the right to say no, and that right to
say no has to be reflected somewhere on the books of the
State.
It is a very dangerous notion, both in First
Amendment terms and in terms of higher democratic values,
for the State to try to sweep that dissent under the rug,
to pretend it doesn't exist.
When Hawaii says to Mr. Burdick, in the interest
of promoting consensus, you can vote for only one
candidate or not vote at all, consensus may be a very
valuable interest, but consensus depends upon consent, and
the State has an obligation as well to recognize the
dissenting members of its society in the important aspect
of voting.
QUESTION:

Mr. Eisenberg, if the essence of your

claim is the right to be heard in saying no, why isn't the
statement of no sufficiently recorded simply if the State
records a blank ballot?

By doing that, they are saying,

he has said no to the candidate on the ballot.
MR. EISENBERG:

Because a blank ballot signifies

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN S. MICHAELS

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6

7
8

MR. MICHAELS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
At the outset of our argument, we would like to
emphasize three very brief points that we would like to

10

carry through our discussion with the Court, and which we

11

would urge the Court to keep in mind as it deliberates

12

upon this important case.

13

First, Hawaii is simply not in a small minority

14

of States when it comes to the issue that is actually

15

presented by this case, because rather than the mere 4

16

States that Mr. Eisenberg refers to, well over 30 States,

17

and in fact, by our count, 37 States do not permit what

18

Mr. Burdick claims the Constitution compels, namely the

1

right at primaries and general elections to vote for

20

whomever one pleases.

21

Second, if this case is about voting, then this

22

case is governed by this Court's ballot access decisions.

23

Voting is very different from generalized speech.

24

the casting of legally effective speech, and under the

25

ballot access decisions of this Court, Hawaii's law is
21

(800) FOR DEPO

It is

1

plainly constitutional because viewed as a whole it does

2

not substantially burden Mr. Burdick's ability to cast an

3

effective vote, and if there is any substantial burden,

4

those burdens are justified by Hawaii's compelling

5

interest in narrowing the field of eligible candidates for

6

the general election and promoting an informed vote.

7

And third, to the degree Mr. Burdick is saying

8

that Hawaii need not seat a write-in candidate who would

9

get a certain number of votes, but that nonetheless,

10

Hawaii must count up and publish that speech, this case is

11

not governed by the questions of substantial burdens or

12

the issue of compelling State interests.

13

It is merely controlled by the question

14

established by this Court's public forum cases, namely

15

whether Hawaii has acted neutrally in excluding the purely

•16

advisory

question from the ballot, I quote, if you don't

17

like all

of the people on this list,who would you vote

18

for?

19

That advisory question Hawaii has excluded in a

20

neutral fashion, and because the answer -- that answer to

21

the public forum question runs in our favor, Hawaii's law

22

is constitutional and Mr. Burdick is entitled to no relief

23

from the Federal courts.

24
25

As the argument in the briefs and the discussion
has established, it has to be the case that States have

1

the authority under our Constitution to exclude the

2

ability of voters to cast write-in votes for broad classes

3

of candidates.

4

In fact, Mr. Burdick really doesn't contend

5

otherwise.

He says that we need not seat ineligible

6

candidates.

7

not seat late filers.

8

at what the right to vote means in our country, it has to

mean that.

We need not seat primary losers, and we need
And if one just looks, for example,

Because in our Nation, and as this Court has

10

defined what voting means in a constitutional sense, the

11

right to vote is preservative of other rights, as this

Court said in the Yick Wo v. Hopkins case, because the

right to vote is legally effective speech.

It is the right, when joined with other votes,

15

to transfer power.

16

up in seating a particular candidate, but the reason

17

politicians worry about votes as opposed to just ordinary

18

speech, which is nonetheless very important, is the fact

19

that votes, if there are enough of them, put you out of a

20

job.

21

Now it is true that not all votes end

We have eligibility rules in our Nation for a

22

variety of reasons.

We have them because some people, we

23

have determined as a constitutional matter, don't have

24

enough experience.

25

that would serve to eliminate classes of candidates

But we also have eligibility rules

because they have too much experience, term limits for

2

example.
And one of the great ironies of this case, if

3
4

write-in voting really means the right to vote for

5

whomever one pleases, is that the term limit movement,

6

which is a widespread movement across this Nation, would

be shut down at the outset as a matter of constitutional

law.

MR. MICHAELS:

has essentially conceded that Hawaii need not seat anyone

who in the 1994 election would vote by write-in for

16

Governor Waihee.

17

time, and for that reason, the term limit is an effective

18

ban that Mr. Burdick agrees Hawaii can effectuate by

19

prohibiting votes for that category of candidates.

His time has come to an end at that

20

What he is saying, Hawaii must count up all the

21

protest speech that would be cast at that time for people

22

that want Governor Waihee to keep serving, but we need not

23

seat Governor Waihee for a third term.

24
25

And what we are contending to the Court is that
that protest speech is a public forum question.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

You agree, I think you stated

expressly in your answer that you understand that they are

not claiming that the person for whom the write-in vote is

8

cast must by the same reasoning be seated in office if

9

there is a sufficient number, or would otherwise be a

10

sufficient number of write-in votes to elect the person.

11

You understand them explaining that?

MR. MICHAELS:

QUESTION:

We understand that concession.

As long as that concession is made,

how does their argument threaten the term limit?

words, the former governor isn't going to have to go back

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. MICHAELS:

That is

The point that we would emphasize

6

to the Court also in considering this case is that this is

7

very -- at its outset, a facial challenge to Hawaii's ban

8

on write-in voting.

The petitioner, even in the 1 86

State House race that was before the court, never said who
10

he wanted to vote for, never said whether the person he

11

wanted to vote for was in fact Donald Duck or someone who

12

was not eligible or so on.
And under that situation, the Court should not

13
14

be speculating as to all the possible ranges of situations

15

in which our law might operate in a tough manner.

16

facial challenge, you look to see whether there is any

17

circumstance in which the law can be validly applied, and

18

the petitioner has virtually conceded that there are large

1

numbers of cases in which it can.

Secondly, the petitioner did not make any record

20

below concerning the burden that our law may impose upon

him.

24

through the courts of appeals, that we really tried to get

25

the signatures but we couldn't; it was too hard to get the

There was none of the typical testimony or evidence

1

2

no such testimony in this record.

None of that -- there is

3

And the record from our side of the case shows

4

that there are large numbers of third parties that exist

5

and have existed in Hawaii and large numbers of

6

nonpartisan candidates who make it through the primary

7

stage.

8

Our Hawaii law is structured around a four-part
process; the party petition process which commences with

10

the filing of the party petitions in April; there is the

11

candidate filing deadline in July; there is the primary in

12

September; and then the general election.

13

And Hawaii's law should be particularly amenable

14

to being sustained by this Court because it creates two

15

cumulative opportunities for voters like Mr. Burdick to

16

get the candidates they want on the ballot.

17

We do have a petition route, and you can

18

guarantee access for your chosen candidates by filing the

1

petitions equal to 1 percent of the general electorate

20

vote by April, and we have a primary route.

21

And the routes are structured in a manner so

22

that those persons who try to file for that automatic

23

access in April have that

24

deadline and the July candidate filing deadline in which

petitions must occur.
The lieutenant governor must make his decision

2

3

on the petitions within 30 days.

There is an

4

administrative appeal authorized under our little APA for

5

the last 60 days; and for those persons who are

6

disqualified from that automatic access by the April

7

deadline, they have the right to bail out and get back

8

into the game by filing for a nonpartisan slot.
And what we would emphasize to the Court.also is

that you can file a party petition even if you are just a

single candidate.

some of them do come fairly early in the process.

Are those filing deadlines, means you

11

MR. MICHAELS:

12

Our basic, our system is structured in a way so

13

that not only can an individual get on the ballot through

14

the automatic access in April, because you don't have to

15

have party committees, party officers, or rules.

16

statute admonishes you to file them if you have them, but

17

if you don't have them, you won't be kicked off the

18

ballot.

19

That's correct, sir.

The

But it also allows the party candidates whose

20

petitions fail to get on the ballot through the

21

nonpartisan process -- there is no disaffiliation

22

requirement under Hawaii law, and so it is truly a case

23

where Hawaii has two complementary and each equally

24

available systems for getting on to the ballot.

25

We submit to the Court that under this Court's

cases in Munro v. Socialist Workers' Party is we submit

2

our best case, that our system is wholly constitutional,

3

and there is really no argument by the petitioner that it

4

is not.

5

There are a couple of footnotes in the brief

6

criticizing parts of the law, but there is no extended

7

argument looking into the Court's cases and what the Court

8

has decided in these cases, to challenge as a

9

constitutional matter our law.

10

And if one looks to the principles that the

11

Court adopted in the Munro case, that access at the

12

primary stage alone would be sufficient, we have that

13

automatic backup that you can get into at April with a 1

14

percent signature requirement that is equally sufficient

15

and makes our law doubly good.

16

The Ninth Circuit in this case therefore has a

17

right to say that there wasn't any substantial burden on

18

Mr. Burdick's constitutional interests, and the Court need

19

not get to the second step of the analysis, as to

20

compelling interest, except perhaps to note that there is

21

a rational relationship between the laws, the goals that

22

we have, and the law that is adopted.

24

for the Court to decide the case.

interests at every turn that are narrowly tailored to the

2

way that the law is written.

3

You simply cannot have the kind of informed

4

voting that Hawaii mandates unless you have deadlines that

5

stick, and although Mr. Burdick concedes that the

6

sore-loser interest is only a narrow one, we urge the

7

Court to look at Judge Easterbrook's opinion in the

8

Seventh Circuit case.

9

candidates are mad after the primary.

10

A lot more people than just the

Our eligibility requirements, those are conceded

11

to be valid and can be enforced, and at the primary there

12

is an important interest in respecting the party's ability

13

to, in a sense, have their own house in order.

14

Now, Mr. Burdick says that it is enough just to

15

say that in Hawaii our laws provide that you have to be a

16

member of the party in order to be a party candidate at

17

the primary.

18

election law, and the point we wish to make with respect

19

to the party raiding argument is that the parties need not

20

just to have this requirement out there, but they need the

21

time to make that requirement effective by looking at the

22

filing deadline to see if there really is a bona fide

23

Only registered Republicans.

Yes, only registered Republicans vote

in the Republican and only Democrats - MR. MICHAELS:

That's true that that is one way,

but we have chosen to balance the question a little

7

differently.

8

State, we do have an open primary, and this is recognized

9

because for a large number of races the Democratic primary

was determinative, and it remained so in large numbers of

11

races.

12

But for the protection of the Republican Party

13

and the Libertarian Party and any other party that exists

14

in Hawaii, what we do is two things.

15

candidates who run in the primary have got to be party

16

members; and secondly, we provide that 60-day period

17

between the filing deadline and the primary date for the

18

party itself to go to court and say, this person isn't

QUESTION:

So a registered Democrat could not

run in the Republican primary in Hawaii?

5

MR. MICHAELS:

That's correct.

In large measure

6

this case is not about write-in voting at all, because Mr.

7

Burdick has said that there are broad classes of

8

candidates where he is asking not that a candidate be

9

seated or that politicians need worry about write-in votes

10

in the manner that I described before, but he is asking

11

that Hawaii, at its own expense, count up what he writes

12

on his ballot and publish it in the lieutenant governor's

13

reports.

14

If I could just, at this point, direct the

15

Court's attention to page 71 of the JA, these are sample

ballots and this is the way the ballot looks to the voter

And we can state to the Court wi,th confidence,

20

it is no crime in Hawaii to write in on your ballot, but

21

we are not going to count it up and we are not going to

publish it, and that is the law in Hawaii if you write a

message on your ballot.

Actually, it

We are not going to

So whether it is favorable or not

favorable, we just don't publish what is written in on the
ballot if it is not punched and executed in a manner
required by law.
And under the Court's decisions, the Cornelius
case is certainly a very powerful case for us^.

This is a

matter that the State can regulate, how it publishes
the -- and what questions it will address at the ballot.
Judge Posner in the Georges v. Carney case put
it very well, a State could decide to have the advisory
question of who if not these do you want regardless of
whether they could be seated, but Hawaii, along with a
large number of States has decided not to do that, and
that is a legitimate decision to make.
I might just add that in that regard, our law
would also be justified as a time, place and manner
restriction at the ballot because what you are saying, if
there is this right to cast this advisory speech, is that
you must double the election ballot, that there is an
advisory question tacked on to every single race from
governor on down, and that conceptual overcrowding of the
ballot is something that Hawaii has an interest in

MR. EISENBERG:

We think Hawaii's deficiencies

2

are twofold, Your Honor.

3

question is we don't lose the case because Hawaii's law is

4

deficient in a second way.

I think the answer to your

Hawaii essentially closes off, as we said, the

5
6

political process to write-in vote, and even for qualified

7

votes, so that if somebody wants to vote for -- not

8

express a no vote, a protest vote, but vote by virtue of a

9

write-in for somebody who is perfectly qualified to hold

10

office, we think Hawaii's law which closes off the process

11

60 days before the primary election and 105 days before

12

the general election is deficient on that ground as well.
The total prohibition simply cannot be

13
14

sustained.

15

Mr. Michaels about filing deadlines with respect to those

16

States that require a write-in candidate to register

17

shortly before the election, and Mr. Michaels shows

18

several States which have quite long filing deadlines.

19

On that issue, there was some discussion with

There are other States that we could have chosen

20

that have quite short filing deadlines; California

21

requires filing by write-ins 2 weeks in advance of the

22

election.

23

QUESTION:

But under your argument all the

States with a long filing deadline for write-in candidates

No, no, we do not say that those

We think that those restrictions shortly

10

before an election, the filing deadline is reasonable, and

11

the State can say if the write-in candidate does not file,

12

that write-in candidate is not eligible to hold office.

13

If the deadline is not unreasonably long, we say that

14

those filing deadlines are perfectly reasonable.

15

The only then remaining question is, what does

16

the State do with a vote for somebody who has not

17

registered?

18

an unqualified voter?

19

our view is a protest vote, is a vote no, and in that

20

circumstance, the State must still record the vote as a

21

vote no, but we have no problem with filing deadlines for

write-in candidates that are reasonably imposed.

framework, most States say the candidate who fails to file

properly, shortly before an election, is ineligible to

13

hold office and the vote won't be counted.

14

some States, for example, Georgia, that has a filing

deadline that continues to count the votes, and in fact,

there was an unreported Federal district court decision in

the 1980s, James against Falagant, where the voters voted

into office, in essence, an individual who did not

properly register.

And the question in that circumstance was

21

whether Hawaii's prohibition against that individual from

requirements and therefore was ineligible, whether that

MR. EISENBERG:

You didn't disagree with that?
No, that in fact is the

appropriate approach we think.
What is at stake in this case is the right of
the voters to choose, petitioner's right to direct his
portion of sovereign power to the candidate of his choice.

10

This right, we say, is not an absolute right.

11

regulate write-in voting in a variety of ways, with

12

specific focused concerns, and those regulatory measures

13

at not at issue in this case.

14

Many States

What is at issue is the application of Hawaii's

15

total prohibition against all write-in voting in all

16

elections and under all circumstances.

17

prohibition, we think, cannot satisfy the standard

18

articulated by this Court in Anderson against Celebrezze.

That total prohibition cannot be shown necessary to the

advancement of any substantial governmental interest, and

the decision of the court of appeals should be reversed.
