ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. MINEAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether a taxpayer

11
12

must include in her gross income amounts received in

13

settlement of a title VII wage disparity suit.

14

the settlement award is gross income because it amounts

15

simply to delayed payment of wages for services.

16

wages should be taxed in the same manner as if they had

17

been paid when earned.

18

We submit

Those

The facts of this case are not in dispute.

19

taxpayers were female employees of the Tennessee Valley

Authority.

in certain male-dominated pay schedules without providing

23

comparable increases to employees in certain

24

female-dominated pay schedules.

1

eliminate prospectively the pay disparity and to provide,

2

quote, back pay to all affected female employees in an

3

amount sufficient to eliminate discrimination.

4

In 1987, the plaintiffs and TVA settled the

5

lawsuit by entering into a settlement agreement.

6

taxpayers in this case shared in the settlement proceeds.

7

TVA made payments to them, and in accordance with the

8

terms of the settlement agreement, withheld amounts for

9

Social Security and Federal income taxes.

The

The taxpayers

10

then filed claims for refund of the withheld taxes.

11

Internal Revenue Service disallowed those claims.

The

The taxpayers then brought this refund suit.

12

13

They argue that the settlement payments should be excluded

14

from gross income under section 104(a)(2) of the Internal

15

Revenue Code, which states that gross income does not

16

include, quote, the amount of any damages received on

17

account of personal injuries or sickness.

18

court rejected their claim; however, the court of appeals

19

reversed.

The district

20

The majority reasoned that title VII awards

21

constitute damages on account of personal injuries or

22

sickness because injuries resulting from discrimination

23

are, quote, injuries to the individual rights and dignity

24

of the person.

25

that title VII awards should be included in gross income

Judge Wellford dissented.

He concluded

1

because they simply amount to a payment of wages for

2

services.

3

We submit that Judge Wellford is correct.

An

4

equitable award of back pay is compensation for services.

5

The Court recognized that principle in Social Security

6

Board v. Nierotko, where it held that a back pay award

7

under the National Labor Relations Act is subject to

8

Social Security taxation.

9

surely the back pay is remuneration.

As the Court stated there,
The same is true

10

with respect to title VII back pay, which was patterned

11

after the NLRA remedy.

12

Thus, the taxpayers back - -

Be payment for services?
Yes, that's right.
But you would not have provided any

services.
MR. MINEAR:

That's right.

But this was the

very issue that was involved in Nierotko, actually.

24

was an unlawful discharge case also.

provide services even though one might not be active.

any services.
MR. MINEAR:

8

9
10

Of course -- I mean, you can say he remained in,

Well, that's correct.

But that was

the issue that this Court faced in Nierotko and decided
that in fact those were wages for services.
QUESTION:

11

Well, would you give the same answer

12

if there were a physical injury caused to an employee and

13

the recovery is measured on the basis of lost wages?

14

MR. MINEAR:

No, we would not.

That is the very

15

distinction we draw between personal injuries and wages

16

for services.

17

the service, that he has been disabled, in those cases

18

he's receiving damages by the amount of the lost wages.

That where a person is unable to perform

QUESTION:

Well, how about a suit for sexual

harassment?
MR. MINEAR:

21

In those cases, title VII did not

22

provide a monetary remedy for those types of cases in the

23

past.

QUESTION:

Well, under the new legislation are

you going to have to face that question?

2

MR. MINEAR:
that question.

3
4

Yes, I suspect that we will face

QUESTION:

And what's the position you would

take?

5

MR. MINEAR:

I don't believe that the IRS has

6

had an opportunity to formulate a formal position on that,

7

but I think the same principles would be applied in this

8

case.

9

amounts to a capital loss of some kind for the - - on

We would look to whether there has been what

10

behalf of the employee.

11

suffered emotional injury, that is a type of injury that

12

is recognized by the Service as being within the 104(a)(2)

13

exclusion.

14

QUESTION:

If the employee, for instance,

You think the Treasury regulation

15

puts forward the same approach that you're urging us to

16

adopt here?

17

MR. MINEAR:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, that is correct.
It doesn't read that way.

It says

19

the phrase damages received means an amount received

20

through prosecution of a legal suit based on tort or

21

tort- type rights.

22

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

And I think that that

23

regulation is referring specifically to what we mean by

24

the term damages received.

It's not speaking to what we

25

mean by a personal injury.

And I think the important

1

distinction that that regulation is making -- which, by

2

the way, appears on page 12 of our reply brief -- the

3

important distinction that that regulation is making is

4

between a damage remedy and a remedy for equitable relief,

5

for specific relief.
It says the term damages received means an

6

7

amount received through prosecution of a legal suit or

8

action based on tort or tort-type rights.

9

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't a suit brought, as in

10

this case under title VII, a suit for damages based on a

11

tort-type right?
MR. MINEAR:

12

Because instead, Your Honor, that

13

is a suit for equitable relief, for specific relief.

14

title VII provides is an equitable remedy for specific

15

relief in the form of reinstatement and an additional

16

award of back pay.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

What

Can't you get damages as a form of

relief?
MR. MINEAR:

This - - I would look to the same

20

distinction that this Court drew in Bowen v. Massachusetts

21

between -- the term damages and the term specific relief.

22

Damages are provided as a monetary substitute for a loss,

23

while specific relief is provided as the very thing to

24

which the plaintiff is entitled.

25

the majority opinion used the back pay award as an example

And in fact, in Bowen,

8

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

of that type of specific relief where a monetary award is

2

provided.

3

Now as I was saying, the taxpayers' back pay

4

award in this case falls squarely within the Internal

5

Revenue Code's definition of income, which expressly

6

includes compensation for services.

7

then is whether some other provision of the code

8

nevertheless removes back pay from that definition.

9

And the only question

As a starting point, we note that this Court has

10

repeatedly stated that exclusions from income must be

11

express and not implied.

12

emphasized that even express exclusion should be construed

13

with restraint in light of Congress's policy to tax

14

comprehensively.

And this Court has repeatedly

15

Now there is no express exclusion for title VII

16

back pay awards, and we believe that the court of appears

17

erred in construing section 104(a)(2) as providing that

18

kind of exclusion.

19

QUESTION:

So, Mr. Minear, if Congress in

20

enacting title VII had provided for damages for this sort

21

of discrimination and allowed a jury trial so that

22

Albemarle would have come out the other way, then this

23

award would be excluded?

24
25

MR. MINEAR:
the first hurdle here.

Not necessarily.

That only passes

The question in front must first

QUESTION:

about here is:

sickness.

So there still would

And that

And that would depend on

Mr. Minear, the phrase we're talking

on account of personal injuries or

Why did the Government abandon its original

10

interpretation of that in which personal injuries would

11

mean physical injuries?

12

injuries or sickness, it seems to me -- the phrase feet or

13

inches, you wouldn't think that feet referred to a part of

14

the human anatomy, given the word feet as used with

15

inches.

16

mean, it obviously connotes to me physical injuries.

And when you say personal injuries or sickness, I

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

Well, I agree with you.
And the Government used to take that

position.
MR. MINEAR:

21

I mean, when you say personal

It took that position in 1920, I

think.
QUESTION:

Why did it abandon that high ground

23

and now try to argue that somehow the word personal

injuries means expenditure of capital?

3

QUESTION:

I mean, it just does not connote

that, frankly.
MR. MINEAR:

Yes, I agree with you, Your Honor,

4

with regard to that point.

5

one looks to the original language of the 1918 statute.

6

And in 1920, based on that language, the IRS took the

7

position that personal injuries meant physical injuries.

8

However, that same year, this Court decided the case of

9

Eisner v. Macomber, and that indicated, at least

It becomes even stronger when

10

suggested, that income for purposes of the Sixteenth

11

Amendment referred only to gains from labor or capital.

12

The IRS, looking at that definition,

13

reconsidered this question, and it said, well, regardless

14

of what what is now section 104(a)(2) might say, this

15

wouldn't be income in any regard because a damage award is

16

not a gain from labor or capital.

17

that continued.

18

just became irrelevant, based on the Service's, view of the

19

meaning of income.

20

1955, when this Court decided Glenshaw Glass, and made

21

clear that income includes all accessions to wealth.

22

In other words, that the exclusion here

That question was finally resolved in

injury somehow carried on.

1

like 1983 that the Government acquiesced in the

2

proposition that the phrase goes beyond physical injuries.

3

Am I wrong about that?

4

MR. MINEAR:

Well, actually the first

5

case -- that was the first court of appeals opinion,

6

Roemer, the Ninth Circuit case, I think is the first court

7

of appeals case where that was squarely decided.

8

arose in a tax court case in 1972 called Say v.

Commissioner.

It also

Now perhaps the IRS made the mistake of not

10

pressing that argument further and continuing to draw the

11

line between physical injuries and other types of

12

injuries.

13

However, by that time there had been this

14

accumulation of practice, you know, from the - - as a

result of the original Eisner decision.

that is the position the Internal Revenue Service has

Nevertheless,

taken.
I would like to go back and just clarify a few

2

3

points with respect to this distinction between damages

4

and specific relief, because I do think it's important.

5

And it is reflected in the D.C. Circuit's recent decision

6

in Sparrow v. Commissioner.

7
8

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, can I ask you a

preliminary question before that?

9

MR. MINEAR:
QUESTION:

10

Yes, Your Honor.
The court of appeals placed heavy

11

reliance on a decision called Threlkeld against the

12

Commissioner, a 15 to 1 decision of the tax court.

13

don't even cite that case in either your principal brief

16

terms of damages and the like.

You

Why don't you have anything to say about

Threlkeld?

19

analysis in that case?

And what's your view of that case and the

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, the Threlkeld, at its

21

most general level, that you looked at the nature of the

22

injury, I think is correct.

1

pay or results.

Isn't that right?

MR. MINEAR:

2

Why, and it's that latter point

3

that I have some difficulty with here, because I think

4

that leads to a certain amount of confusion.

5

in Threlkeld, it was attempting to deal with a difficulty

6

that had originally arisen in the Roemer tax court

7

decision.

8

distinction between personal reputation and business

The question

And in Roemer the tax court had tried to make a

reputation, saying that one could get an exclusion for
10

injuries to one's personal reputation, but not to one's

11

business reputation.

12

And what Threlkeld did, and I think quite

13

correctly, was eliminate that distinction and said no, we

14

simply look to the fact that there was an injury to one's

15

reputation.

16

that's what Threlkeld really stands for.

17

makes this very point in his dissenting opinion below.

18

That's as far as we need to go.

And I think

Judge Wellford

But I think that it's mistaken to suddenly to

1

exclude any consideration of what type of injury was

20

actually suffered here, and that's how it is being used by

21

respondents, I believe.

22

suffered in this case was a underpayment of earnings.

23

female employees were not paid as much as their male

24

counterparts.

QUESTION:

The injury that was actually

MR. MINEAR:

Well, that was the only injury that

title VII provides recompense for.

significant, too, that the settlement award has to based

5

on the cause of action that's allowed under title VII.

Now, title VII provided for equitable relief in the form

of reinstatement and back pay sufficient to make the

And I think that's

The back pay award is simply

So even if he was -- even if he

11

suffered great embarrassment and he worried a lot, lost a

12

lot of weight, things like that?

13

MR. MINEAR:

14

QUESTION:

15

Title VII does not -And title VII just isn't designed to

recompense - -

16

MR. MINEAR:

Until recently amended, it was not

17

designed to compensate for that.

1

respect to the personal injuries aspect of this, I think

2

the question will focus on what is the nature of the

3

particular injury.

4

emotional distress, for instance, it seems to me that the

5

IRS has already provided the proper analogy.
QUESTION:

6

7

And up until now, the -- title VII

has never allowed recovery for emotional distress.
MR. MINEAR:

8

9

If there is something akin to

That's correct.

That's correct.

And I think it's also interesting to not that all of this

10

entire matter here is a matter of rather recent origin.

11

For many years, there was no question that back pay awards

12

under the NLRA were in fact included as gross income.

13

These cases have all arisen in the past few years,

14

actually.

15
16

QUESTION:

19
20
21

Under the new statute, Mr. Minear, is

there a jury trial provided -- under the new statute?

17
18

And it's been a --

MR. MINEAR:
provided.

I believe that a jury trial is

That is correct.
QUESTION:

Would that change your position so

that this would become legal and not equitable?
MR. MINEAR:

Well, again, I think the question

22

here is we shouldn't allow the existence of a jury trial

23

to determine that question but rather the nature of the

24

cause of action that's provided.

25

you're receiving money as a substitute for loss, it seems

And in the cases where

to me that those are damages.

And again, that only

2

answers the first half of our question.

3

Now, I'd like to turn to the --

4

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, but I would like to ask

5

one further question.

6

underpayment of wages, that's the easy case.

7

answered Justice Scalia by saying if there was also a

is that the only difference in those statutes in

And the bottom line

as Chief Justice Rehnquist appropriately pointed out and

we agreed, that was a statute of limitations case, but the

analysis of this Court in that case because the -- section

there, who sought to extend the limitations to 6 years for

QUESTION:

So if there's a suit for refusal to

Yes, because it was for invidious

title VII goes further, and of course, sex, national

QUESTION:

Mr. Finley, would we have an easier

2

time with this case if instead of focusing on fine

3

distinctions in personal injury and fine distinctions

4

about damages, we focused instead on the further

5

requirement under 104 -- 104(2), which speaks of damages

6

received on account of personal injuries.

7

Can't we say that even assuming you are correct,

8

that this is a personal injury here, the damages were not

9

received on account of the personal injury, simply because

10

they bear no relationship and the inquiry in determining

11

them bears no relationship to the personal injury which

12

you say occurred?

13

In the award of the damages, it doesn't matter

14

whether the discrimination was egregious or not.

15

doesn't matter whether the person discriminated against

16

was hurt or otherwise psychologically injured.

The only

17

thing that matters is the amount of the wages.

And since

18

that bears no relationship to the extent of the personal

19

injury, why isn't the easy answer to say that the damages

20

are not awarded on account of the injury?

21

MR. FINLEY:

It

Because, Your Honor, these are the

22

consequences of the injury that the Government has focused

23

on wrongfully.

24

v. Moody, the purpose of the statute, of the title VII

25

statute is to compensate and make whole the injured

person.

QUESTION:

So you're saying the very nature of

3

the statute focuses it solely on personal injury, and as a

4

matter of law, we would have to say here that a back pay

5

award is on account of the injury because that indeed is

6

the object of the statute.

7

MR. FINLEY:

Is that it?

That is exactly what happened in

8

this case, Your Honor.

That is correct.

It is the --we

9

must establish, and in this case -- I, as counsel for the

10

plaintiffs in this case had to establish that there was a

11

wrong committed by the defendant TVA, that TVA had

12

discriminated against these employees based upon their

13

sex.

15

QUESTION:

And we were able to present proof to the district

But doesn't your answer suffer from

16

the fact that under the statute, different kinds of relief

17

could be rewarded?

18

a back pay award, and there could indeed be equitable

19

relief to remedy the discrimination without the payment of

20

a penny.

21

I mean, there need not necessarily be

MR. FINLEY:

I would agree with the second part

22

of your postulate, that there is these differences, but I

23

don't think my case suffers from it because we are back

again talking about remedies.

QUESTION:

job across the street, and making the same thing, except

he wanted back his old job -- it was easier.

In this case it did not allow a suit

MR. FINLEY:

QUESTION:

That's right.
But if -- in my example, if title VII

had allowed a suit for emotional distress, it wouldn't

make any difference that he worked across the street and
didn't lose any pay.

10
11

MR. FINLEY:

On that component of the injury,

you're correct, Your Honor.

Now, to go back to this whole question here, and

13

here again is where the scope of the exclusion comes in in

MR. FINLEY:

That were the consequences, Your

That were the consequences.

But as this Court has

7

held, and Chief Justice Rehnquist in the Meritor Savings

8

case pointed this out very nicely about the emotional

9

effects of discrimination upon a victim.
Now, Congress didn't provide a remedy for it at

10
11

that time, and Congress provided a remedy of back pay,

12

which was all we could claim in our prayer for relief.

13

The gravamen of the case, however, which had to be

14

demonstrated and proved, was the wrongful discrimination

of the employer.
