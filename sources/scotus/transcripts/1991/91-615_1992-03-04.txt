ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is here on petition for writ of

12

certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Jersey to decide

13

the question whether New Jersey has the constitutional

14

right to tax an apportioned share of the capital gain

15

earned by the Bendix Corporation from an investment that

16

it had in a company called ASARCO between 1978 and 1981.

17

Bendix was a company at this time that operated various

18

types of businesses, aerospace, automotive, and other, it

19

had four operating groups.

20

in New Jersey and elsewhere around the United States.

21

These businesses were operated

In 1978 the chairman of Bendix, reviewing its

22

broad financial interests, determined that it would be

23

prudent to invest a substantial sum of money in ASARCO

24

which is a copper and non-ferrous metals mining and

25

refining company.

It's undisputed that the business of

1

ASARCO had nothing to do with the businesses in which

2

Bendix was engaged, and of that $127 million was used to

3

purchase approximately 20, a little over 20 percent of the

4

stock of ASARCO.

5

2 years later in 1980 the chairman of Bendix

6

decided that they had had a very nice profit in the ASARCO

7

stock, it was an excellent investment.

8

that natural resources were going to continue to grow and

9

be as profitable in the future as they had been during the

10

period that they had held the stock.

11

be a good idea to concentrate the company's resources more

12

in high tech areas closer to where it was already

operating and the ASARCO stock was sold.

substantial profit was made.

MR. FREY:

Well, there is a different theory --

QUESTION:

-- the company in which the

12

investment is made is also a New Jersey company.
MR. FREY:

There is a completely different

13

theory of measuring the taxation, which I believe New York

14

uses, where you look at not where the taxpayer is

15

operating but where the company is in which it has

16

invested and is operating.

ASARCO did or did not do business in New Jersey.

That is not the basis of the

That would produce a completely different

I don't know what it is.

QUESTION:

And I think it is

Do we have this case on the

22

understanding that the investment by Bendix in ASARCO was

23

a means of handling some of their working capital for a

24

period of time?

Definitely not.

That would be

case.

what I would call investment capital or resources of

Working capital is the capital that is employed in

It is like the money you need to cover the

We are talking here about drawing on

Bendix and investing it somewhere where Bendix thought it
10

would be profitable.
Now the question ultimately is whether that

11
12

investment and the income from that investment is part of

13

the business that Bendix was conducting in New Jersey or

14

not part of the business that Bendix was conducting in New

15

Jersey.

And if it was not, New Jersey can't tax it.
Now, the nexus requirement, which is what we're

16
17

talking about here, did New Jersey have nexus to tax the

18

profit that Bendix made in the ASARCO investment, has two

1

pieces.

20

jurisdictional element like was involved in the Quill

21

case, that is was Bendix in New Jersey to be subject to

22

any taxation by New Jersey, and the answer to that is

clearly yes.

The first piece is sort of the personal

There is a second part, however, which is well
recognized, deeply rooted.

It goes back to sort of one of

1

the earliest principles of Fourteenth Amendment due

2

process jurisprudence which is the transaction that is

3

being taxed must have a connection with the taxing state,

4

that is the state may tax a transaction only if it

5

provides opportunities, benefits, or protection for the

6

activity that it is taxing.

7

Now, the problem in applying this test which the

8

Court has often stated comes up when you have a multi-

9

state business engaging in a variety of activities in a

10

number of states and you try to decide what parts of the

11

activities of that business are taxable in the state and

12

how do you measure a fair amount of tax.

13

dealing with this has developed two concepts.

14

concept of apportionment which asks how you measure how

15

much of the total income of a business may be taxed in a

16

particular state, and the second is a concept which has

17

normally been captured in the idea of the unitary

18

business, that is identifying what is the business that is

19

being conducted in part in the state that is trying to tax

20

the income.

21

Now the Court in
One is the

Now somebody might ask, and I think Justice

22

O'Connor may have asked in her dissent in ASARCO, what's

23

wrong with a system under which we just take all of the

24

income of the corporation and we apportion it and we let

25

the state tax a share of that.

Isn't that good enough

really?

2

think.

3

that is that it happens to be a corporation which is

4

receiving this income rather than looking at the substance

5

of the business activities, and that method does in fact

6

invite extraterritorial taxation.

7
8

And there is a couple of things wrong with that I
One of the things is that that method exalts form,

Let me give an example to try to capture this
thought.

Suppose I have a business that operates beauty

parlors in New York and New Jersey.

There's no question

10

that the income from that business can be taxed by New

11

Jersey in accordance with some measurement of the share of

12

that business that I do in New Jersey.

13

don't want to expand my beauty parlor business at present

14

and I decide to open up a business in California in

15

parking lots, or to buy stock in a business in California

in parking lots.

Now suppose I

I don't think it matters for this

Now suppose that in a given year I make no money

with the beauty parlors, is highly profitable.

to seize a share of the profits that I made from a

business that I was not operating at all in New Jersey and

tax them.
Now, the problem that we're dealing with here,

11

12

of course, is a problem of taxation of intangible income,

13

that is - -

14

QUESTION:

Just before you get away from your

15

hypothetical, in your hypothetical what was the

16

domiciliary state of the corporation?

17

MR. FREY:

New York.

I didn't mention it, but -

QUESTION:

Well, but in - - I take it under your

18
19
20

proposal that New York could tax part of the parking lot

21

business.

22

MR. FREY:

If the parking lot business were

23

operated, were a separate corporation in which I owned

24

stock, New York could tax it.

25

New York can tax it is I think a totally different

principle from the principle on which New Jersey or

it.

Well, yes, but they could tax

And under your submission to us I take it in the

MR. FREY:

Michigan.

7

QUESTION:

-- Michigan can tax the profits that

8

are made from that.
MR. FREY:

That is correct.

10

suggesting that it can't be taxed.

11

question at all.

12

We're not

That is not the

The question is may New Jersey tax it.

QUESTION:

And it seems to me somewhat odd under

13

your system that Michigan can reap all of the benefits of

14

the gain on disposition.

15

MR. FREY:

I don't think it's odd at all because

16

I think the principle under which Michigan gets to tax all

17

of these benefits is the same principle that applies to

18

individuals when they live in a state.

1

they live, which presumptively and in practice when you're

20

talking about the commercial domicile as the state that

21

safeguards and provides opportunities and benefits for the

22

generality of the operation although not the specific

23

details of it, has the right to tax all income wherever

24

earned except to the extent that it's being taxed some

25

place else and you may have to give credit under the

1

Commerce Clause or under other principles.

2

That is if I live in New York and I make money-

3

abroad, let's say, New York has the perfect power to tax

4

that, not because the activities abroad took place in New

5

York, but because of a well settled, long standing

6

recognition that proceeds from really a different

7

principle that the domiciliary state has the right to tax.

8

I think you're asking the question the wrong way

9

because I think the constitutional question is what has

10

New Jersey done that would justify New Jersey -- that is

11

what is the relationship between New Jersey and what it is

12

that it seeks to tax.

13

it helps New Jersey to say well, the commercial domicile

14

doesn't have all that much better a relationship.

15

my response to the question.

16

And if there is none, I don't think

That is

The alternative is to abandon, it seems to me,

17

what the Court has clearly held in a number of cases, both

18

the sort of bedrock principle that there has to be nexus

19

to the tax transaction and then the principle that was

20

developed in the Mobil, Container line of cases that

21

suggests that unitary business is sort of the bench mark.

22

And let me say about intangible income that

23

until, as I understand it, until 1960 or so no one ever

24

suggested that intangible income, dividends, interest,

25

capital gains, was taxable anyplace except the commercial

domicile or some other, that is that income was always

2

allocable to a single place.

3

deeply rooted.

4

That's the tradition that's

Now you may say --

QUESTION:-

Excuse me, was that true even then

5

with respect to income from non tangibles resulting from

6

just short term investments and working capital?

7

MR. FREY:

I think it probably is not true as to

8

working capital, and I want to explain -- I mean, I think

9

the Court in the Mobil, ASARCO, Container line of cases

10

developed a very coherent tenable theory for understanding

11

the question that is before the Court today that governs

12

the outcome in this case.

13

the unitary business principle, as I am sure the Court

14

understands, is a notion that a single business conducted

15

in many states may have different components, that is you

16

may have factories in one state, you may have stores in

17

another state.

18

combined business activity and therefore it is fair to

19

look at those activities as a single business.

20

What the Court, the Court --

They all contribute to the wealth of the

And in the Mobil case where the Court was

21

dealing with dividends that Mobil earned from primarily

22

ARAMCO, that is production in Saudi Arabia, it said

23

Vermont could tax its apportioned share of that because in

24

essence the oil production in Saudi Arabia and the

25

ultimate sale of oil in Vermont and elsewhere were part of

a single business.

Vermont could tax its share.

The Court said that the linchpin of

2

3

apportionability, the linchpin is the unitary business

4

concept.

5

is whether the businesses are unitary.

6

ASARCO and Woolworth a year later and the Court looks at

7

those cases, and in those cases again you had an

8

investment in various subsidiaries that produce dividend

9

income and other income to the parent.

That is you, the way you go about deciding this
Now along come

And the question

10

was whether Idaho or New Mexico respectively could bring

11

that dividend income into the business that was being

12

conducted in Idaho or in New Mexico.
And the Court said no.

13

The Court said, and I

14

quote, we cannot accept, consistently with recognized due

15

process standards, a definition of unitary business that

16

would permit non domiciliary states to apportion and tax

17

dividends where the business activities of the dividend

18

payor have nothing to do with the activities of the

19

recipient in the taxing state.
Now in this case it is conceded that there is no

20
21

relationship between ASARCO's business and Bendix's

22

business.

23

the matter.

24

page 18a of the Appendix, the tests for determining a

25

unitary business are not controlled by the relationship

You would think that that would be the end of

Court, the New Jersey Supreme Court in this case saying

5

the opposite of that as clearly as it could.

So we have the Supreme Court saying one

Now New Jersey says it really, the Supreme Court

can't literally have meant what it said in ASARCO.

8

can't it have meant?

Why

Because it says consider working

Working capital is an example of something the

10

income from which has always been treated as being part of

11

the operating income of a business, taxable where the

12

business operates without regard to the fact that the bank

13

or the United States Government or whoever may be

14

producing that income, paying those dividends or that

15

interest, has no unitary relationship with the business.

16

And that of course is true.

17

We don't disagree with that.

So we had this exception to the broad principle

18

that was stated in ASARCO and the Court dealt with this

19

exception in the Container case, which was the last case

20

in this series of cases.

21

clear in another context, in corn products, and I want to

22

talk about the corn products case for a minute, capital

transactions can serve either an investment function or an

operational function.

it's part of the operations that took place in part in New

Isn't part of the problem of using

for making the original investment, but in fact the way

MR. FREY:

No, not at all.

In fact that's one

12

of the, the great fallacies in New Jersey's argument, is

13

that you should look at what happened after the investment

14

ceased being an investment and became money which might

15

then be employed either in another investment or in the

16

operations.

17

Our position is that it's quite clear that what you look

18

at - - you're taxing the current income.

19

whether at the time this intangible income was generated

20

it was being then and there used in some way, the

21

intangible asset, in the operation of the business.

22

don't think you have the problem.

you have from the Mobil, Container line of cases, is a

very coherent rule.

QUESTION:

2

Before you do that, Mr. Frey, would

3

you comment a little, maybe you've already covered it,

4

more specifically on what I understand to be the New

Jersey Supreme Court's point that if you look at

6

operations of the taxpayer, where the operations in a

7

sense were acquiring and disposing of businesses --

8

MR. FREY:

All right.

-- and that that's what makes this

10

case a little bit different from ASARCO.
MR. FREY:

That is an exception that I would

recognize.

selling intangible interests.

16

would be business income and you, the question you would

17

ask in this case was whether the business of investment

18

that was conducted, that line of business of Bendix, was

19

conducted in part in New Jersey, in which case the profits

20

from that business might be taxable.

You could have a line of business, such as

can imagine.

order for there to be a reversal in this case.

the dissent there was a substantial emphasis on the fact

That is in

that ASARCO there was drawing upon its knowledge and

what, what I believe -- there is a part of the dissent, I

17

think in all fairness, that suggests that the unitary

therefore it purchased corn futures as a way of assuring

that when it needed corn it would have them, have the corn

is that that was part of the ordinary course of the

There is no

If an investment is passive it's, the Court

has thought of it as not being part of the unitary

12

finding was impermissible because the partial subsidiaries

13

were not subject to even minimal control by ASARCO, it was

14

explaining the ASARCO case, and were therefore passive

investments in the most basic sense of the term.

that both Container Corporation case and ASARCO case

When it sees

10

the opportunity of diversifying into an area that's going

11

to generate capital for another line, which was one of the

12

reasons, rationales for the ASARCO investment, it will go

13

into that line.

which is what the Court talked about in Container is that

12

MS. HAMILL:

13

I'm sorry, I thought from your

The problem

15

with ASARCO and Woolworth is the fact that you, we're put

into a straight jacket of looking only at whether there

we think ASARCO was wrongly decided.

wrongly decided for three reasons.

requirement of a relationship between the payor and payee

of investment income, which really fragments the

between ASARCO and Bendix when we're not taxing ASARCO.

7

We're trying to tax Bendix.

One is this

You go around looking for some relationship

That's one problem.

The other problem which I think is related is

8

9

We think it was

the inference in ASARCO and Woolworth that -- and Mr. Frey

10

was really talking about this - - that once you get by the

nexus jurisdictional issue under the due process clause,

that the next question is whether the income itself that

you're talking about has some relation to the taxing

the taxing state and what is outside the taxing state is

part of a unitary business, if the unitary business

principle means anything, you don't have to go any further

not going to be able to show a direct monetary flow, a

The California

operating loss in California, the taxing state, and the

14

Court says well, but still that, those other businesses

There is a potential for

about that.

We don't use combined reporting in New

dividends from the subsidiaries and we say under our

We take the

statute dividends from subsidiaries that are 80 percent or

more owned, i.e. wholly-owned or down to 80 percent, are
