CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Goldblatt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN H. GOLDBLATT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDBLATT:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether a brief may

10
11

serve the function of a notice of appeal and thereby vest

12

jurisdiction in a Federal court of appeals.

13

arises in the context of a civil rights action that was

14

filed in the District of Maryland in 1983.

The issue

15

As it was a multiparty, multiclaim case, one

16

respondent, Dr. Barry, was granted summary judgment in

17

1984.

course and went to jury trial in 1988.

19

The remainder of the case proceeded in the ordinary

Several of the defendants were granted a

20

directed verdict.

21

jury, and after that verdict was entered, final judgment

22

was entered in February of 1988.

23

The remainder of the case went to the

Subsequent thereto, Smith filed a notice of

24

appeal.

J.N.O.V. pending at that time.

2

QUESTION:

That's rather a trap, isn't it?

3

MR. GOLDBLATT:

There is no argument made here

4

that that notice of appeal on its own may vest

5

jurisdiction.

6

and other cases.

7

states in 4 (a) (4) .

This Court has made that clear in Griggs
Of no effect means what that language

8

Nevertheless, the notice of appeal was forwarded

9

to the circuit court by the district court, and that court

10

started a process of informal briefing which it uses in

11

cases where there is a pro se appeal.
QUESTION:

12

The original of -- at least when I

13

used to practice, the original of the notice of appeal was

14

filed with the district court.

15

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Is that still true?

That is correct, Mr. Chief

16

Justice.

17

it's required by Rule 3(d), and the district court is then

18

required - - the clerk is required to transmit it forthwith

19

to the court of appeals with the docket entries.

That is true -- it was true in this case, and

The Fourth Circuit - -

But the brief here was not filed with

That is correct, Justice

The brief was filed with the circuit court.

And yet you want the brief to be

considered the notice of appeal.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

2

That is correct.

Rule 4(a)(1) I

3

believe provides that when a notice of appeal is filed

4

with the circuit rather than with the district court, it

5

is still operational, but under that rule the circuit

6

court is required to date it, transmit it back to the

7

district court, which would then docket it as a notice of

8

appeal, and I think the purpose of that rule is to render

9

the notice of appeal effective if it is filed in the wrong

10

court.
QUESTION:

11

Would your rule be that any

12

appellant's brief is a sufficient notice of appeal, or is

13

it somehow confined to the circumstances present in this

14

case?

15

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I think the rule that we're

16

relying on is the rule that's stated in the comment to

17

Rule 3(c), which is that any paper that serves the

18

function of notice will vest jurisdiction in the court of

19

appeals.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

So if you prevail, then any appellant

can satisfy the notice of appeal by simply filing a brief.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

I think the answer to that would

23

be yes, but I would qualify it by saying that in the

24

ordinary course that is not likely to occur, and I think a

25

brief like any -- it would be - - the modification in this

1

case would be to say that a brief cannot serve that

2

purpose, although any other document can, Justice Kennedy.

3

QUESTION:

The problem, of course, with that is

4

that notice of appeal is really what starts the time

5

ticking for compiling of the record, and without having

6

the record before them, the appellee who has to answer the

7

brief within the prescribed time is at a serious

8

disadvantage.

9

appellee can ask for an extension, but it seems to me a

I suppose the answer to that is the

10

rule with very far-reaching consequences that you're

11

arguing, although there are some equities in this case.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

12

I think the equities are what

13

should prevail here.

14

this is the rule that has been in effect --

15

QUESTION:

I think it really --in many ways,

Well, if the equities prevail I

16

want -- I need to know what the rule is, and of course not

17

all the equities are on your side, since your client's own

18

attorney advised him that the original notice of appeal

19

was invalid.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

20

That's correct, Justice Kennedy,

21

but at the time that his attorney sent him that letter,

22

which is in the Joint Appendix, he was under instructions

23

from the Fourth Circuit to file a brief.

24

he did nothing, or ignored it and did nothing in the

25

process.

It's not as if

He merely complied with the orders of the Fourth

It did provide the other

A notice of appeal doesn't tell the other side

QUESTION:

It doesn't

You're required to identify the

But the rule about not being able to

13

take it -- you know, if you take it too soon it's

14

ineffective, that doesn't seem to me to be consistent with

15

this rule you're urging upon us, is it?

16

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I think it is.

The reason why

17

the premature appeal under Rule 4(a)(4) shall have no

18

effect is because the rule expressly states that.

19

asking the Court here to superimpose judicial entity on an

20

otherwise silent rule.

21

QUESTION:

I'm not

But why would the rule state that if

22

the rule maker was only concerned about the other side

23

having notice?

24

fail to give the other side notice.

give the other side notice.

The fact that it's filed too soon doesn't

It does

1

MR. GOLDBLATT:

And that would apply to the

2

notice of appeal that he in fact filed, but for purposes

3

of what is known as the functional equivalent doctrine,

4

that brief that he filed in the appellate court within the

5

appropriate 30-day time frame served every purpose that

6

the other side would have gotten had he filed a new notice

7

of appeal, as the rules would otherwise require, and that

8

concept that an equivalent document, if it serves the

9

purpose of notice, vests jurisdiction, has its origins in

10

Rule 3(c) itself, in the comment to Rule 3(c), and in fact

11

even before the 1979 amendments.

12

The 1967 amendments point to Coppedge v. United

13

States, which identified that all manner of documents have

14

been allowed to serve the function of notice and preserve

15

jurisdiction in the court of appeals -- Coppedge was a pro

16

se case -- and then in 1979 the rule was amended to say

17

that an appeal should not be dismissed for informality of

18

form of title in the notice of appeal.

19

Now that would have been the rule, I submit,

20

e pro -- pro se litigants even before 1979.

21

thing the amendment really did was to solidify it, make it

22

clear, and apply it to all cases whether the person is

23

represented by counsel or not.

24
25

The only

I think the important thing to bear in mind is,
the importance of notice of appeal is to give notice.

1

Beyond that, the other requirements have always contained

2

the caveat that they can be construed liberally, and this

3

Court has done so because the rule so directs.

4

And these rules, unlike other rules of

5

procedure, contain Rule 2 as well, which allows the

6

circuits on a case-by-case basis to suspend the operation

7

of the rules in a given case for good cause shown, so

8

these rules carry with them a purpose that for purposes of

9

jurisdiction it is preferable to construe them

10

liberally -QUESTION:

11
12

Could a court of appeals suspend the

30-day time limit for filing a notice of appeal?

13

MR. GOLDBLATT:

No it could not, because under

14

Rule 26(b)

15

26(b), which says nothing in these rules shall give the

16

courts the authority to extend the time for filing an

17

appeal, and 26(b) is the limit on the equitable powers of

18

the court.

19

-- Rule 2 is specifically limited by Rule

The time cannot be extended.
QUESTION:

Mr. Goldblatt, the form of brief that

20

was filed here does not expressly name the individuals

21

against whom the claims are being made, does it?

22

23
24
25

MR. GOLDBLATT:

That is correct, Justice

O'Connor, it does not.

wouldn't it, to say that whatever else it might do that it

gave any kind of notice to Dr. Barry, who'd been dismissed

2

years before by the court.

3

provided notice to Barry?

.4

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I mean, how do you think it

It provided notice to Barry,

5

Justice O'Connor, because it was served upon Dr. Barry.

6

His counsel, in fact, received a copy of it, so at

7

least - QUESTION:

8

10

Do you think that a fair reading of

it would give any indication that Dr. Barry was subject to
it, or being noticed?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

11

I think so, if one distinguishes

12

between notice merely alerting the party that the judgment

13

has an appeal -- been appealed, as opposed to notice of

14

what the issues are that you intend to raise.
The general rule, as I understand it, is an

15
16

appeal from the final judgment in a case brings up the

17

entire case.

18

you identify which appellees you're going to go against or

19

what you're going to do.

20

of appeal with the district court, it's served on all

21

parties.

22

There's not a requirement at that point that

QUESTION:

Indeed, if you file your notice

Yes, and if I got a notice of appeal

23

I would understand that to be the case, and therefore I

24

would think even though it doesn't name my - - the cause of

25

action against me in particular, I have got to assume that

2

it may involve me.
But when I get a brief that supposedly is

3

directed at everything that's supposed to be involved in

4

the appeal, I might feel differently, don't you think?

5

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I think not, and I think an

6

example of that is certainly Dr. Barry, even before he

7

received that brief, just by having notice that an appeal

8

had been taken, he had identified the very issue that we

9

ultimately, when we were appointed, raised in the case.

10

He knew what the issue was in the case, and in fact

11

submitted his informal brief before Smith submitted his

12

own pro se.

13

I think that the purposes of notice, as limited

14

as they are, are simply to make a decision within 30 days

15

and alert the court and the other sides that an appeal has

16

been taken, that what he put in that informal brief,

17

albeit imprecise, albeit pro se language, alerted everyone

18

on the other side of the potentiality that they would be

19

included in the case.

20

QUESTION:

If this brief hadn't been filed

21

within the 30-day period after final -- suppose the final

22

judgment still hadn't entered when this brief was filed,

23

then you'd be out of court?

24

MR. GOLDBLATT:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, I would, Justice Scalia.

Until you filed your reply brief.

I

1

assume your reply brief might bring you back in court

2

again.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

3

I would suggest that any

4

document that served the purpose of notice, if it's filed

5

within the 30-day time frame, under the rule, under the

6

Advisory Committee note, will serve the purpose.

7

the important point is, notice is important, but its

8

importance is limited to making that decision.

9

I think

It's entirely possible that parties would not

10

know when you appeal it and identify the final judgment as

11

the order being appealed in a multiparty case, those

12

parties will not know at that point whether they're in the

13

case at all, what issues are in the case, and what issues

14

are not.

15

is why this document, as imprecise as it is, gave them all

16

the notice that they'd be entitled to in a notice of

17

appeal.

18

It serves a very, very limited purpose, and that

QUESTION:

But it did one thing more, didn't it?

19

Didn't it in effect limit the issues in a way which a

20

straight notice of appeal would hot have done?

21

by referring, in effect, to trial error rather than --or

22

perhaps even jury error, I forget, but as distinguished

23

from pretrial rulings.

25

MR. GOLDBLATT:

It limited

Justice Souter, my answer there,

I think is that here you have to look at that pleading as

1

a pro se pleading, so I don't think the Court would look

2

at that pleading if it was submitted by a lawyer in the

3

same way, and that is with solicitude, and I think that

4

when he answers the question, what relief do you want, a

5

new trial on all issues triable by jury, that gave the

6

other side enough information to recognize the possibility

7

of any issue being raised on appeal.

8

QUESTION:

Well, you say that that is the same

as saying you're appealing from the final judgment.
10
11

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Mr. Chief Justice, yes, I am,

for a pro se litigant.

12

QUESTION:

What's your authority for that?

13

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I don't have any express

14

authority, other than this Court's admonition that pro se

15

pleadings are to be construed liberally.

16

liberal construction to get to that point.

17

QUESTION:

It does require

Well, we said that about a pleading

18

which attempts to state a claim for relief.

Not to my knowledge.

However, I

would submit that, given the purpose of the notice, that

Because the alternative is to

have cases dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

4

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Well, what's the matter with that?
The.problem with that, I think,

5

particularly for pro se litigants -- first of all, I think

6

Rule 3(c) itself says that it's not to occur.

7

preference is to not have that happen.

8

construed liberally to protect jurisdiction, and that's

9

what Coppedge does, and I think the concept of final

The

We want this

10

judgment, which is a concept that this Court on several

11

occasions, of course, has had to pass on, is not something

12

that a pro se litigant is going to readily understand.

13

QUESTION:

Well, but how many rules do we have

14

to bend to give the sort of breaks you want given to pro

15

se litigants?

16

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I don't think you have to bend

17

anything more than the solicitude that their pleadings are

18

entitled to.

19

litigants and for pro se litigants, has always bent this

20

rule in favor of finding jurisdiction.

The rule itself, both for counseled

QUESTION:

21

So then you really don't have to

22

rely, you say, on any particular solicitude for pro se

I don't think we have to.

1

I think that even with counseled litigants the rule from

2

this Court since Foman v. Davis with regard to judgment

3

designation in a notice of appeal has been that even a

4

mistake in the designation, if the intent to appeal is

5

manifest and the other side is not prejudiced thereby,

6

will not be fatal.

7

QUESTION:

Do you have any case that involves a

8

document such as this, which is not even intended as a

9

notice of appeal?

I mean, 3(c) says an appeal shall not

10

be dismissed for informality of form or title of the

11

notice of appeal, but it seems to me quite different when

12

the document that is filed is not even intended to be a

13

notice of appeal.

14

It's intended to be a brief.

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Justice Scalia, that language,

15

if you look to the explanation in the Advisory Committee

16

note, which this Court has of course indicated is of

17

significance in interpreting this, refers to a Judge

18

Wisdom opinion in Cobb v. Lewis where a petition to appeal

19

under 1292(b) was allowed -- was denied, but the court

20

treated it as a notice of appeal under 1292(a).

21

In the discussion, the Court identified the

22

various documents that over the years the Federal

23

appellate courts have allowed to do service as a notice of

24

appeal, including an appellate brief, and I think read

25

together with that language, plus the language in the

1967
QUESTION:

2

You don't think it referred to just

3

the holding of the case, you think it referred to every

4

example that the case gave?

5

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I think it did, especially in

6

light of the reference in the 1967 comment to Coppedge v.

7

United States, which is a case decided by this Court, in

8

which the Court in a footnote indicated pro se appellants

9

have not had trouble with the notice of appeal

10

requirements because of the liberal attitude the courts

11

have taken, and proceeded to string-cite any number of

12

cases, including motions to proceed in forma pauperis,

13

letters to judges, any manner of document that can serve

14

notice.

15

The point being that if you accomplish what you

16

have to accomplish under Rule 3, you have vested

17

jurisdiction, and that that is the preferred rule to

18

strict compliance with these particular procedural rules.

19

QUESTION:

Should the court of appeals have

20

taken this brief and sent it down to the district court

21

for filing there, as it's supposed to do when it

22

erroneously gets a notice of appeal?

23

4 somewhere says?

24
25

MR. GOLDBLATT:

I would submit that there's no basis in the

this case.

The second issue, which is if you get over that

11

hurdle of whether this particular document, this informal

brief, does meet the court's requirements for compliance

13

with Rule 3(c), which is a separate issue.

QUESTION:

Yes, except that an appellant's

filing of a responding brief, and at that point there is

no record, so it seems to me quite plausible to say that

we do have a rule that a brief cannot be a notice of

Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure are skewed.

21

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Justice Kennedy, the reason we

get this informal brief is because he filed an untimely

notice of appeal.

we take it out of that context and just have a brief filed

court would not treat that as a brief.

It might treat it

2

as a notice of appeal and start the correct procedures,

3

but it is not a brief.

4

It is not filed pursuant to the orders of the

5

court in the ordinary course, and my point is the court

6

should not be guided by the title the litigant puts on the

7

document any more than the court is guided by the title

3

that litigants put on any other documents.

It's not a

brief in that sense.
10

It may well be a notice of appeal, but it's not

11

a brief, and I don't think it would trigger any of the

12

other time requirements because the court would not even

13

have the case docketed, and I think that's the real answer

14

to that question.

15

QUESTION:

It's not a brief.
Plus the fact I suppose such a brief

would seldom be filed within the time permitted for a

MR. GOLDBLATT:

apart the step of timely filing a notice of appeal as a

2

matter of unique significance.

3

failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a

4

notice of appeal does not affect the appeal's validity and

5

is ground for such action only as the court deems

6

appropriate.

7

According to the rule, the

The implication, of course, is that the validity

8

of an appeal hinges on the timely filing of a notice of

9

appeal, and that that step is of such fundamental

10

importance that the court does not have such discretion

11

with regard to a failure to fulfill that requirement.

12

Further evidence in the plain language of the

13

rules as to the significance of this step is the time

14

limit for filing a notice of appeal which, unlike other

15

provisions of the rules which may be suspended pursuant to

Rule 2, may not be enlarged by the court, in accordance

1

You're referring to some of the court

2

decisions that are referred to in, say, the footnote in

3

Coppedge or something like that?

4
5

MR. BAMBERGER:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's

correct.

6

We submit that allowing a brief to serve as a

7

notice of appeal would not be mere informality of form,

8

but would be waiving a separate jurisdictional requirement

9

altogether, and there is support in the rules for that

10

11

position.
The rules are designed as an integrated set of

12

rules, according to the Advisory Committee note to Rule 1.

13

They set out detailed provisions regarding notices of

14

appeal on the one hand and briefs on the other, and those

15

rules have different requirements relating to content,

16

filing, and service.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Bamberger, do you agree with the

18

Fourth Circuit's suggestion that an appellate brief can

19

never serve as a notice of appeal?

20

MR. BAMBERGER:

21

22

Yes, Justice O'Connor, that

would be our position.
QUESTION:

Well, couldn't one maintain that

23

position and say that all it leads to is the conclusion

24

that once you decide it will be treated as a notice of

25

appeal it shall no longer be treated as a brief?

I mean,

I think it's quite logical what you say, that it has to be

2

one or the other.

3

The rules have two separate requirements, a

4

notice requirement and a brief requirement, and there

5

should be both, but I think what your colleague is saying

6

is simply, this one was the former.

7

Call it a notice, and he hasn't filed his brief yet.

He'll have to file a later brief.

your objection?

10

MR. BAMBERGER:

It was the notice.

Doesn't that satisfy

I believe it does, Justice

11

Scalia, in the sense that what the rules really require

12

are two separate filings.

13

QUESTION:

Right.

14

MR. BAMBERGER:

And it is true that Rule 3

states that informality of form or title would not be the

16

basis for disallowing a notice of appeal, so

hypothetically I suppose if were titled, brief, and it

QUESTION:

Well, this circuit specifically does

2

not require that a brief be filed, because it has a

procedure for these informal briefs, which is just the

court's form.

5

itself has said that it doesn't want briefs, in a

6

conventional sense.

7

That's the whole purpose.

MR. BAMBERGER:

So the circuit

Well, at the same time the court

8

has a procedure for entering an order that, although it

9

does not mandate the filing of an informal brief, requires

10

the clerk to send the briefs out to counsel and to the pro

11

se parties with an instruction that if the briefs are to

12

be filed, they must be filed by a certain date, which

13

would certainly be a strong suggestion that the court

would be interested in having the issues briefed.

We submit that there is a difference between

MR. BAMBERGER:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That's my answer.

It seems to me that the petitioner

21

here could argue that the appellees, or the putative

22

appellees, had far more notice of what the issues were and

23

what the judgment was and what the basis of the appeal was

24

from this informal brief than it would from just the

one-line statement that's required by the rules that

MR. BAMBERGER:

I think it's far more

I guess in response to that,

10

Justice Kennedy, I would say two things.

11

with respect to Dr. Barry there was nothing at all in the

12

informal brief concerning him, and as to the other

13

defendants, there certainly was no specific designation of

14

the final judgment or any particular judgment or order.

To say that asking for a new trial on all issues

16

triable by a jury is sufficiently specific we think would

17

be stretching it a little too far.

18

QUESTION:

Yes, but we don't have to stretch it

19

that far.

All we have to do is say it was effective with

20

respect to those things that it clearly did specify, it

21

was not effective with respect, let's say, to the

22

dismissal of Dr. Barry.

23

to its deficiencies, it doesn't follow that this can't

24

function as any kind of a notice of appeal, it simply

follows that it could function only as a limited notice of

MR. BAMBERGER:

2

Justice Souter, with respect to

3

even the defendants who defended the case at trial, there

4

were certain defendants who got out on directed verdict,

5

there were others against whom only one claim was tried.

6

It's simply not clear enough from the phrase --we would

7

submit that it's not clear enough from the phrase, all

8

issues triable by a jury, exactly what this individual is

9

appealing.
QUESTION:

10

Isn't the answer to that to ask him

11

what he means, rather than say he can't appeal anything at

12

all?

13

MR. BAMBERGER:

Well, again, as I stated

14

earlier, I think you could probably take virtually any

15

appellate brief and say that it sufficiently discusses the

16

issues to provide notice and it also identifies the party

17

taking the appeal and the court to whom the appeal is

18

being taken, but yet the rules require two separate

19

filings, the giving of notice first, and then, at a later

20

date, the brief.

21

QUESTION:

They don't really require two

22

separate filings, do they?

You keep saying that.

23

a person could waive the brief, file a notice of appeal,

24

and after that just sort of punt the whole process, but at

25

least the jurisdictional basis for the court to act would

2

isn't that true?

3

MR. BAMBERGER:

I believe that once a notice of

4

appeal, a proper notice of appeal has been filed, the

5

normal process would be for the appellate court to issue

6

an order as to the date when briefs are due.

7

QUESTION:

Oh, perfectly true, and if one party

8

doesn't file a brief the appellate court can take whatever

9

action is appropriate, but the question is, did

10

they -- was appellate jurisdiction established, and the

11

fact is, all you need is one document to do that, you

12

don't need two.

13

Isn't that true?

MR. BAMBERGER:

That is true.

That is true, and

14

we would submit that the document was not specific enough,

15

and certainly as to Dr. Barry was completely deficient.

16

Petitioner Smith refers this Court to prior

17

decisions showing that special solicitude for pro se

18

litigants is appropriate, and especially prisoners.

19

premise underlying the solicitude that is afforded to pro

20

se litigants is that substantial but imperfect compliance

21

may be accepted when an appellant has done all that he

If it came down to deciding

I'm not sure I'm prepared to

The functional equivalent doctrine which was

acknowledged by this Court - - was acknowledged by this

technicalities should not bar appellate review if the

litigant's action is the functional equivalent of what the

rules require.

We would submit that Smith's filing of an

functional equivalent of a notice of appeal, really did

questions posed by that court on a preprinted form.

22

adopt Carter, which is a Fifth Circuit rule, that is a

blanket rule that a brief may never do service as a notice

have no occasion to determine whether this particular

2

document meets the judgment designation requirement.

3

So I think that the holding is clear a brief may

4

not do service, and I would submit respectfully that it's

5

not a defensible position, and that -- because there's

6

just nothing in the rules that would do that.

7

I would also again point out there's also no

8

question in this case that this informal brief has never

9

been the brief in this case.

When we were appointed to

10

the case, this case went through classical, formal

11

briefing under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure

12

with briefs that looked like briefs, and the court used

13

those briefs to decide whether this document was a valid

14

notice of appeal and it was based on the conclusion that a

15

brief, something labeled a brief, may not be a valid

16

notice of appeal, that the case was dismissed.

QUESTION:

18

The informal brief's filed --

How did that sequence come about?

MR. GOLDBLATT:

FOR DFPO

MR. GOLDBLATT:

1

Then the next thing that happens

2

is this Court decides West v. Atkins on June 20th, 1 88,

3

which essentially knocks out Barry's sole basis for

4

getting out of the case.

5

Then on June 24th, I believe it was, they filed

6

a brief saying well, West v. Atkins came down, Calvert no

7

longer gets us out of the case, but he didn't appeal to us

8

anyway.
It was at that point, not, at that point, even

10

identifying the fact that the notice of appeal was

11

invalid.

12

point - - it was at that point that the circuit appointed

13

us to represent Smith and brief the issue of whether or

14

not the informal brief could serve as a valid notice of

15

appeal.

16

It was on a totally different issue at that

We then went through the ordinary briefing.

We

17

had a briefing schedule, we filed our brief, they filed

18

theirs, there was a reply brief, and a decision.

this case itself this informal brief is not a brief at

20

all. ’That's never been the issue for the Fourth Circuit.

21

The only issue was, can we call it a notice of appeal?

But was the brief that you filed

23

addressed to all of the issues, or just to the

24

jurisdictional point?

point, plus the issues on the merits as to why it should

2

be reversed as to Dr. Barry, and why it should be reversed

3

as to the remaining respondents, and in that sense, that's

4

the issue that was before the Fourth Circuit, and there

5

can't be any doubt about it.
I just want to close briefly on the question of

6

7

solicitude, and I think the one thing that my colleague

8

omits is the fact that Mr. Smith is proceeding pro se in

9

this matter.
He is also, as the record makes very clear,

10
11

suffering from rather substantial psychological problems,

12

and they are putting an onus on him that I submit is

13

inappropriate under these rules - - inappropriate under the

14

spirit of these rules, and putting him to a task that he

15

and many other people out there simply cannot meet, in a

16

situation where there is absolutely no prejudice to them

17

at all.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Goldblatt, I can understand how

19

you would say that about some things required of a pro se

20

litigant, but to file a notice of appeal when you've got a

21

form in the back of the rulebook and it can be one

There may be problems with the judgment

What he didn't understand was the operation of

11
12

Rule 4(a)(4), which apparently to a certain extent was

spurred on by instructions from the Fourth Circuit that he

Coppedge was in 1961.
Oh, I'm sorry, I misspoke, but

7

it referred back to cases that had been relied on up to

language in 3(c) was adopted, and the Advisory Committee

note makes it clear that that is the intended way.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GOLDBLATT:

13

When did we last use it, in Torres?
Torres would have been the last

case where you construed one of the requirements in 3(c).

14

There was some language in Firstier which was

1990, I believe, where reference was also made to Rule

16

general compliance with the rules was last discussed in
