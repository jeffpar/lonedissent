CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK L. LANDAU

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. LANDAU:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case presents the straightforward question

11

of when a habeas petitioner who failed to fully develop

12

the facts of his case in a State post-conviction

13

proceeding is nevertheless entitled to a Federal

14

evidentiary hearing.

15

should be entitled to that Federal hearing only when he

16

can demonstrate cause for his failure to present his

17

evidence and prejudice that results.

18

It is the State's position that he

My argument this afternoon will focus on two

19

propositions in support of that conclusion.

20

cause and prejudice is required in this case because of

21

the -- because the Court's recent decisions requiring the

22

application of that test in other circumstances are not

23

distinguishable here.

24
25

First, that

Second, that section 2245(d) of the 1966 Federal
Habeas Act does not preclude the adoption of a cause and

prejudice standard under these circumstances.

2

does not address the question of whether an evidentiary-

3

hearing is required, but rather the weight that must be

4

given to State fact-findings when the hearing is to be

5

held.

The statute

Before turning to those contentions, let me
briefly recount the factual context for those contentions.
Jose Tamayo-Reyes was charged in State court
with the crime of murder.

In accordance with a plea

10

agreement, he agreed to plead no contest to the lesser

11

charge of manslaughter.

12

filed a State post-conviction petition challenging the

13

voluntariness of that plea.

14

court gave him a fair opportunity to present all of the

15

evidence that he thought should be before the court on

16

that issue.

17

record as completely as he should have and that he would

18

like to supplement that record through a Federal court

19

evidentiary hearing.

20

Ten months later, Tamayo-Reyes

The State post-conviction

He now says that he didn't develop that

The Federal court denied his request for

21

petition -- or request for the evidentiary hearing.

22

Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed that

23

Tamayo-Reyes received a full and fair hearing, but

24

nevertheless reversed a holding that the district court

25

should have applied the rule of Townsend v. Sain, which

The

V.

1

requires a Federal evidentiary hearing as long as the

2

petitioner's failure to develop the facts in the State

3

post-conviction proceeding was not deliberate.

4

Thus, the Ninth Circuit's ruling means that once

5

petitioners raise their claims, they are not responsible

6

for failing to fully develop this claims in the State

7

post-conviction proceeding, unless they did so as the

8

result of conscious, considered, deliberate decision.

9

In all other cases -- he forgot, he failed to

10

discover evidence that was reasonably available to him, or

11

anything other - - virtually anything other than a tactical

12

decision - - his failure to develop those facts at the

13

State court proceeding requires the Federal court to hold

14

an evidentiary hearing.

15

The precise question before this Court, then, is

16

whether the Ninth Circuit was correct and whether

17

Townsend's deliberate bypass rule is still good law.

QUESTION:

And yet you obtained a grant of

3

MR. LANDAU:

Yes, we did, Your Honor.

4

Returning to our first proposition that cause

5

and prejudice and not mere deliberate bypass must be

6

applied in this case, I suppose the short answer is that

7

Townsend borrowed the deliberate bypass test from Fay v.

8

Noia, which was decided the same day.

however, has since been limited in a number of decisions,

10

and was ultimately overruled this last term in Coleman v.

11

Thompson.

standard, then, is gone.

And so also, we argue, should

There are, however, more fundamental reasons for

15

rejecting the deliberate bypass standard in this case than

16

the overruling of Fay v. Noia.

17

deliberate bypass test in that case and criticized it in

18

other cases for good reasons.

19

reasons apply with equal force here.

20

Court addressed the question of whether deliberate bypass

21

or cause and prejudice should apply where habeas

22

petitions -- petitioners fail to raise claims, fail to

23

appeal, or fail to conform to any number of other State

24

procedural rules.

25

The court rejected the

issue is whether or when to grant a State habeas

2

petitioner a Federal evidentiary hearing.

3

at least three reasons.

4

QUESTION:

This is so for

Well, of course, in all those other

5

instances, I suppose it is true that we could look to an

6

adequate and independent State ground as the basis for the

7

procedural bar and so forth.

8

9

MR. LANDAU:

That is not present here.

Justice O'Connor, it is true that

the Court has looked at the policies that underlie the

10

adequate and independent State ground in some of its

11

decisions, though not all, in those decisions in which the

12

cause and prejudice standard is adopted.

13

case, in the Francis case, in a number of others, the

14

Court has applied the cause and prejudice test for

15

different reasons.

16

In the Davis

Having said that, we would still submit that the

17

policies that are underlying the adequate and independent

18

State ground test that were applied in those other cases

19

apply here as well.

20

QUESTION:

Well, of course one other concern

21

might be that here the Federal court has agreed to

22

entertain the legal issue.

23

hear that issue and decide it on habeas.

24

Federal court should -- maybe it's desirable that it be

25

decided based on all the facts as they could be developed

And maybe the

rather than simply on the record below.

2

some differences here that you have to come to grips with.

3

MR. LANDAU:

I think there are

My response to that, Justice

4

O'Connor, would be that Federal habeas petitioners get a

5

single opportunity to make their factual record or show

6

cause for failure to do so, as this Court held in the

7

McCleskey case just this last term.

8

petitioners be treated differently and have an easier time

9

of obtaining the second evidentiary hearing?

Why should State

As this

10

Court said in the Francis case when considering whether or

11

not to adopt the deliberate --or the cause and prejudice

12

standard that it had in Davis, we shouldn't be treating

13

State and Federal petitioners differently.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, McCleskey was a State prisoner.

He was a State prisoner on Federal habeas.
MR. LANDAU:

That is true, Justice Kennedy.

But

17

the question in that case was the extent to which you get

18

a successive habeas --

19

QUESTION:

Yes, and we made it very clear that

20

it is the duty of the petitioner to the extent possible to

21

bring all of his claims in the first proceeding.

22

doesn't that mean that that first proceeding is of the

23

greatest importance and so -- isn't that an argument, at

24

least, for saying that there should be a full fact-finding

25

and evidentiary hearing at that stage?

But

V

1

MR. LANDAU:

is one of the most important reasons why there should be a

3

cause and prejudice test applied in this circumstance and

4

cases like it, so that there is the proper incentive for

5

petitioners to develop the facts at the first opportunity,

6

which is the State petition.
QUESTION:

Well, I said first opportunity and my

8

submission to you was that it was the first hearing in

9

Federal court where the statute, one of the provisions of

10

the statute for disregarding the State's finding is that

11

the facts were not adequately developed.

12

MR. LANDAU:

Well, as the Court has observed

13

repeatedly in its cause and prejudice tests, one of the

14

most important defects of the deliberate bypass test is

15

that it fails to pay proper respect to the State's role in

16

the overall criminal adjudication process.

17

consideration is what underlies all of those cases.

18

should apply here.

QUESTION:

Mr. Landau, can I interrupt with just

2

one question?

3

your position that may make a lot of sense.

4

that -- your position does require overruling a portion of

5

Townsend.

You're making a policy argument in favor of

6

MR. LANDAU:

7

QUESTION:

8

Do you think

That is correct.
What about -- how consistent is your

position with subsection (d)(3) of 2254?

9

MR. LANDAU:

I'd be happy to turn to that

10

portion of my argument, Justice Stevens.

11

the respondent, Tamayo-Reyes, has argued that in enacting

12

the statute in 1966, specifically section 2254(d), that

13

Congress somehow adopted the deliberate bypass test of

14

Townsend.

15

Townsend serve related but very different purposes.

We think that's incorrect.

It is true that

The statute and

16

Townsend identifies the situations in which the

17

Federal courts are required to offer petitioners an

18

evidentiary hearing.

19

section 2254(d), defines the weight that must be given the

20

State court determinations.

21

functions.

22

you'll excuse the colloquialism, mixing apples and

23

oranges.

Those are two different

/

1

at the structure of the act as a whole, the only possible

2

standard that could be drawn from that is the cause and

3

prejudice statute.

4

two sections that relate to additional evidentiary

5

hearings in the same enactment in the 1966 act, they

6

require a cause-type standard, and it doesn't make any

7

sense that Congress would not apply the similar standard

8

in the similar circumstance.

9

If you look, for example, at the other

Section 2244(b), for example -- this is the

10

statute, the successive petition statute that was at issue

11

in McCleskey -- defines the extent to which successive

12

Federal habeas petitions can be filed, and provides that

13

new grounds will not be allowed unless the petitioner can

14

establish cause and prejudice.

That's a successive petition.

why that section should inform the problem before us.
MR. LANDAU:

Allen, the same policies that underlie the successive

petition sections also inform the evidentiary hearing.

1

standards that apply to second habeas petitions should

2

apply to first habeas petitions?

3

MR. LANDAU:

This is true.

That's correct.

4

What we're talking about is trying to provide incentives

5

for petitioners to bring all their evidence to court as

6

early as possible so that the court that is hearing this

7

matter in the first instance can make its decision based

8

on the best record possible.

10

petitioners to do that, you frustrate the process.

You

You also frustrate the Federal court.
QUESTION:

I wasn't quite sure when you answered

14

Justice Steven's first question about 2254(d)(3).

15

thought the substance of your answer was that well, the

16

hearing doesn't have to be held.

must be held in any -- you're absolutely entitled to bring

And then it

That is absolutely correct, Justice

24

Kennedy, but what -- if you look carefully at the language

Once it is

presumption if the facts were not adequately developed.

MR. LANDAU:

That's correct.

And what that

means is, Your Honor, that the State court may not presume

that the State court determination, the conclusions that

10

were drawn by the State court, that those are no longer

That's correct.

Well, no.

State hearing and say the material facts were not

2

adequately developed in the State court, period, without

3

having any inquiry made as to what the proceedings in the

4

State court were and what position he took.

5

MR. LANDAU:

That is correct.

I believe that

6

neither party are taking issue with that.

7

that the Court will need under Townsend to apply either

8

the deliberate bypass test that was expressed in Townsend,

9

or the cause and prejudice test which we are proposing

10

It is a given

here.
QUESTION:

11

You're saying that subsection (3) is

12

given application, under your theory, when a case is

13

accepted by the Federal court because there was cause and

14

prejudice.

15

to a particular matter, the material facts, because of the

16

cause and prejudice, were not adequately developed.

that item, having accepted the case, the court will not

MR. LANDAU:

Correct.

And I think

7

that's borne out by the second paragraph of the statute,

8

which provides that in an evidentiary hearing in a

proceeding, this is how you rebut the presumption.

This

is how you offer evidence to controvert the presumption.

The first portion of the statute refers to those cases

and of itself is the reason why we're entitled to a
hearing.

I believe that that affidavit is evidence which

shows that the hearing in the State court did not result
in adequate development of the facts.
But even absent that affidavit, we have on the
meager record which was created in the State postconviction proceeding, the person who was hired as an
interpreter saying that all he told Mr. Tamayo-Reyes was
murder is killing someone without permission and
manslaughter is less than murder.
The importance of the Federal hearing would be
to more fully develop the manner in which the
interpretation defect did not convey what is required in
order for a person to understand the mens rea elements.
The standards under which Mr. Tamayo-Reyes is
seeking a hearing have been in effect for nearly 30 years
- - standards which were set out in Townsend and adopted at
least twice by enactments of Congress, standards which
have provided strong protection to State interests during
that time.

In 1966, Congress

Congress did not import that same concept of

finality into section 2254.

To the contrary, in section

2254, Congress created an evidentiary rule which would be

10

applicable once the hearing was being held.

11

time, in section 2241, Congress expanded the jurisdiction

12

of the district courts so that the evidentiary hearings

which Congress was clearly contemplating would take place

However, the action that Congress took in 2244

in fact, the number of hearings has decreased

dramatically.

But when they acted, they said in the

portions of the legislative history which are more

applicable perhaps to section 2241, we need to expand the

jurisdiction of the district courts because under Townsend

there will be more hearings.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wax, 2254 also includes

appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies

available in the courts of the State or that there is

either an absence of available State corrective process or

the existence of circumstances rendering such process

ineffective.

direction from what you're arguing here?

3

MR. WAX:

I believe that it does not.

I believe

4

that existence of the exhaustion requirement in the

6

provides significant protection to the State.

7

exhaustion requirement precludes a petitioner from coming

into the Federal court and significantly reformulating his

claims.

The

If, however, the exhaustion requirement were

read to preclude a petitioner from offering any new

fact -- and I submit that the State's position is not

If they are seen as applying at

to first overcome Townsend before getting a hearing, then

in that hearing have to overcome the presumption.

that it is reasonable to assume that Congress enacted a

6

very difficult evidentiary presumption for a petitioner to

7

overcome, based on the type of standard which would be

8

applied in the first instance in determining whether or

9

not the hearing should be held.

I think

If the presumption of correctness as it applies

10
11

in 2254(d) is made more difficult for a petitioner to

12

overcome, it seems to me that the Court would be undoing

13

what Congress set out to do when it enacted that statute.

14

If we can't get a hearing unless cause and prejudice is

15

shown, Congress' desire to provide protection through the

16

presumption of correctness is less necessary.

17

believe that this Court should take that step.

And I don't

And the fact that

1

Congress adopted those rules in 1976 with knowledge of, we

2

have to assume, what they meant, and with the advisory

committee report available to it, provides further

4

evidence that the Townsend language has been adopted.

5

In addition, a number of decisions of this Court

have called section 2254(d) a codification of Townsend.

recognize that there is some dispute in the case law about

that.

Second, in McCleskey, the Court acknowledged

2

that that was an area in which the Court had taken the

3

lead, and in which Congress' enactments had not been

4

intended to preclude further judicial development of the

5

law.

6

the entire history of congressional enactments in the area

7

of habeas corpus is replete with evidentiary hearing

language.

That is distinguishable from this situation in which

Third, McCleskey saw a very close parallel
10

between the question of inadequate and independent State

11

ground, which underlies the cause and prejudice analysis,

12

and the procedural default which occurs in the successive

13

petition area.

14

Here we do not have a procedural default.

To

15

the extent that the State was attempting to suggest in its

16

reply brief that Oregon law might consider this situation

17

a procedural default situation, it is important to look

18

not only to the rules which they have cited, but in

1

addition, rule 71 of the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure.

20

As we indicated in our brief, the Oregon courts

21

have in some areas adopted the Townsend and Fay language.

22

Rule 71 of the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure provides

23

for relief from judgment under certain circumstances.

24

those circumstances include mistake, inadvertence,

25

surprise, or excusable neglect.

QUESTION:

Is it correct, Mr. Wax, that the

10

district court has the discretion to hold a hearing if it

11

chooses to do so?
MR. WAX:

12

It is certainly correct that they have

13

the discretion to do so.

14

the rule which the State is suggesting, it is entirely

15

possible that that discretion could be removed.

16

the Court is to focus on the circumstances set out in

17

Townsend in which a hearing is mandatory and addressed

18

only that question, the discretion arguably would remain

19

unlimited.

20

QUESTION:

If however, this Court adopts

And if

Well, even under the deliberate

21

bypass standard, does the court have discretion to go

22

ahead and hold a hearing?

23

MR. WAX:

I believe that it does since Townsend

24

says that a hearing is mandatory in the six enumerated

25

circumstances, but is discretionary in any other -37

QUESTION:

1

Does that circumstance work for you

2

or against you in this case, the fact that there is

3

discretion to ignore the deliberate bypass rule, if that's

4

the rule, or I assume, the cause and prejudice rule, if

5

that's the rule we adopt?
MR. WAX:

6

The reality, I'm afraid, is that that

7

works against us because the district judges are not, in

8

my experience, exercising their discretion in that way.

9

They are looking to the first part of Townsend and, in

10

most instances, not looking to the fact that there is

11

discretion available.
QUESTION:

12

Well, does it work for you to the

13

extent that if the rule is valid, it indicates that the

14

statute is not binding on the district court?

15
16

MR. WAX:

Yes, it would.

When viewed in that

way, it certainly would.
QUESTION:

The discretion is,

as you've indicated, as I understand the statute --

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Grant hearings for additional

reasons.

5

MR. WAX:

Yes.

In looking at the decision in

6

Coleman, one finds further support for Mr. Tamayo-Reyes,

7

because in that decision the Court noted that the costs in

8

the federalism calculus are particularly high when a

9

procedural default has occurred.

And that recognition, I

10

submit, is applicable here and further underscores the

11

fact that in balancing the Federal/State interests in this

12

situation, the interest of the States are adequately

13

protected.

14
15

If there are no other questions, I will complete
my argument and thank you very much for your time.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JACK L. LANDAU

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MR. LANDAU:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

I would like to make a couple of points

22

following up on Mr. Wax's remarks.

23

to the record to demonstrate the deficiency of the State

24

court hearing and the necessity for the Federal

25

evidentiary hearing in this case.

First, he has referred

bit of the record as well because I think it makes the

2

point that I'm trying to make, or that I tried to make in

3

my opening remarks.

4

If you take a look at that in the joint

5

appendix, the deposition of the interpreter indicates not

6

that the translation was in anyway inadequate, it

7

demonstrates that he didn't have a very good memory at

8

that point 2 years after the fact.

9

would submit, would he have that problem, were the

How much more so, I

10

evidence to be adduced some 6 years in addition after

11

that, or 8 years after the fact?

12

That is the very point that we are asserting

13

here, is that there needs to be built into this system

14

incentives for petitioners to put all of their evidence in

15

at the earliest possible point so that the witnesses,

16

whose recollections are fresh, or as fresh as possible at

17

the time, can have that evidence.

18

QUESTION:

Why isn't that incentive provided by

19

the natural desire of a person in prison to try to get out

20

as soon as possible?

21

MR. WAX:

Justice Stevens, there's no question

22

that there is that incentive that works in the system.

23

Our concern is that the application of the deliberate

24

bypass works against that and that the cause and prejudice

25

tests provides the kind of further incentive that would

QUESTION:

You're arguing for -- the rule you're

3

arguing for is really for the benefit of the prisoners, to

4

make sure they make their cases as promptly as they can.

5

MR. WAX:

I think, as I said in my opening

6

remark, that adoption of the cause and prejudice test

7

ultimately will benefit the prisoners because it will

8

promote the ability of the Federal/State fact-finders to

9

make accurate decisions as early on in the process.

10
11

QUESTION:

Well, that just means it'll benefit

those prisoners who deserve to get off.

12

MR. WAX:

13

QUESTION:

That's true.
It will not benefit those who don't

14

deserve to get off, because in those cases, bad memory is

15

a positive advantage, isn't it?

emphasize, was that is also works in the favor of the

3

Federal courts which might not otherwise have to hear the

4

matter at all if the full record were put before the State

5

--or the State court in the first instance.
Mr. Wax also mentions the legislative history

6

7

and says in that in the '64 and '66 act legislative

8

history there is some aversion - - or some reference to

9

Townsend.

That is true, but if you look at that

10

legislative history, the comments are twofold.

First,

11

that there was -- there's concern about the effect of

12

Townsend being too many additional hearings.

13

the inappropriateness from a federalism point of having

14

the Federal courts reviewing the State fact-finding

15

process.

And second,

16

As the Court has - - as this Court has observed

17

in Sumner v. Mata, the whole underpinning of the statute

18

is to reduce the friction that necessarily follows when

19

you have any evidentiary hearings on - - in Federal court

20

to review those findings of the State court.
