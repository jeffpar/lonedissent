ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

maybe it please the Court:
Up until 1982, employees in the State of

11
12

Michigan who reached retirement age with a job-related

13

disability were entitled to collect workers' compensation

14

benefits and retirement benefits, even though both

15

workers' compensation benefits and retirement benefits

16

were intended to compensate an employee of the same exact

17

wage loss.

18

to earn more money after retirement than they would have

19

earned if they had continued to work.

20

In many cases this allowed retired employees

Now, needless to say, this so-called retiree

21

problem was quite costly to employers and was considered

22

by many government officials to be the single biggest

23

liability to maintaining and attracting business to the

24

State of Michigan.

25

The Michigan legislature responded to this

1

problem in 1981 by passing a statute that authorized

2

employers to coordinate workers' compensation benefits

3

with various other benefits provided by employers.

4

the 1981 statute, which became effective on March 31,

5

1982, employers were allowed to offset workers'

6

compensation benefits against the amounts that an employee

7

was otherwise receiving from employer-sponsored wage

8

replacement programs, such as pensions and Social

9

Security.

10

Under

Now a few years after the 1981 statute went into

11

effect, the Michigan supreme court held in a case called

12

Chambers -- unanimously held that the coordination

13

provisions applied to all payments of workers'

14

compensation after March 31, 1982, regardless of when the

15

employee happened to have been injured.

16

The court reached this conclusion by relying on

17

the plain language of the 1981 statute, the structure of

18

the statute, and the legislative purpose in requiring

19

coordination of benefits in the first place.

20

Now, the Chambers decision was immediately

21

attacked by employee groups in the State of Michigan, and

22

efforts were made to overrule it legislatively.

23

years later, in May of 1987, the Michigan legislature

24

passed a statute abolishing coordination of workers'

25

benefits for employees injured prior to March 31, 1982.

Almost 2

But the legislature was not content simply to

1

2

abolish coordination of workers' compensation benefits

3

prospectively; they went much further.

4

explicitly announced that the Michigan Supreme Court's

5

decision in Chambers was erroneously decided, had

6

erroneously interpreted the intent of 1981 legislature.

7

And to remedy this perceived error, what the Michigan

8

legislature did in 1987 was to repeal the 1981

9

coordination provision retroactively and required

The 1987 statute

10

employers to make refunds, with interest, to all employees

11

whose benefits had been lawfully coordinated during the 5-

12

year period that the 1981 statute had been in effect.

13

Now, petitioners did not challenge the 1987

14

statute to the extent that it affected the amount of

15

workers' compensation benefits payable prospectively; but

16

they claimed that the retroactive provisions of the

17

statute violated the contracts clause and the due process

18

clause of the Federal Constitution to the extent that it

19

required employers to go back and reassess their workers'

20

compensation obligations for the years 1982 to 1987 under

21

a completely different set of rules than were in effect

22

during that period of time.

23

The Michigan courts rejected these Federal

24

constitutional claims, and we have renewed them in this

25

Court.

QUESTION:

1
2

Mr. Geller, what is the contract

exactly that you say was impaired?

3

MR. GELLER:

The contract is the contract of

4

employment between employers in the State and these .

5

employees.

6

QUESTION:

Well, if you look back at the

7

original employment contract with people who were hired

8

before 1981 who were injured and put on disability before

9

then, I assume under the terms of the original program,

10

there would be no coordination of benefits.

11

MR. GELLER:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GELLER:

14

There was no - That was the original understanding.
Well, there was no coordination of

benefits at that time, Justice O'Connor.

That's correct.

15

QUESTION:

So how can that contract be impaired?

16

MR. GELLER: I think because the terms of the

17

contract, we allege, Your Honor, are that employers will

18

make workers' compensation benefits to disabled employees

19

in whatever amount is lawful at the - - during the period

20

of time of disability.

21

lawful will vary in the future based upon what the

22

legislature determines in light of existing events.

23

may go up; it may go down.

25

After all, the amounts that may be

amount is that is lawful during every subsequent period of

1

disability, and that was what we - - what we assert was the

2

contractual obligation and the contractual expectation.

3

Now, at the time that these employees became injured there

4

was no coordination, but subsequently there was

5

coordination, and the employers satisfied their

6

contractual obligation by paying coordinated benefits

7

during that period of time.

argue that the contract was that of the original

10

understanding between the employer and the employees, that

they'd get what the law provided when the -MR. GELLER:

14

QUESTION:

-- when they were disabled and

15

started receiving the benefits.

16

MR. GELLER:

First of all, Your Honor, I think

17

the terms of the contract are essentially a question of

18

State law.

19

this case because we know from the Michigan Supreme

20

Court's definitive decision in the Chambers case that the

21

benefits could go down as well as up, and that would be

22

consistent with the contract.

23

QUESTION:

I don't think you can make that argument in

Well, for purposes of a contract

24

clause assertion, is it purely a matter of State law or is

25

there a Federal law component to what a contract is?

MR. GELLER:

1

There is a Federal law component in

2

determining whether the contract has been impaired.

You

3

have to determine, of course, what the contract is in

4

order to determine whether subsequent legislation impairs

5

it.
And what we say is that the terms of the

6

7

contract here, as is shown by the consistent experience in

8

Michigan under the workers' compensation statute is that

9

the employers are not promising to pay any specific amount

10

in the future.

They have promised to pay whatever the

11

amount is that is lawful for subsequent periods of

12

disability, and that's of course exactly what General

13

Motors did here -- and Ford -- between 1982 and 1987.

No, this is not a class action,

QUESTION:

So when did each of these people go

to work for General Motors and for Ford?
MR. GELLER:

They went to work well before the

Exactly.

tradition and usage in Michigan?
MR. GELLER:

It's based on that.

1

I don't see analytically how it would

be any different if the statute had been passed just

3

before the Michigan Supreme Court had acted.

4

MR. GELLER:

I think we would have much the same

arguments.

I think our case is even stronger though,

6

Justice Stevens, because we do have a definitive

7

construction in 1985 of this law, and it was only 2 years

8

later that the court - - that the Michigan legislature says

9

the 1981 statute didn't mean that --

MR. GELLER:

-- but we know for a fact that it

did mean what the Chambers court said.

In fact, the

1

1987 law, Justice White, was prospective and retroactive.

2

We have not challenged the prospective aspects of the law.

3

Let me just say in answer to Justice Stevens

4

question that there was an immediate reaction to the

5

Chambers decision, but the -- the bills that were

6

introduced in the senate and the house of representatives

7

in Michigan did not all provide for retroactive liability.

8

9

The bills that were introduced in the senate
provided only for prospective changes in the coordination

10

rules, and.it was not until 8 days before the bill was

11

actually passed in 1987 that a conference committee agreed

12

to put in this retroactive provision.

13

Now, the court below gave two reasons for

14

rejecting our contract clause claim.

15

which took up only a single sentence of its opinion and

16

was not otherwise explained was the assertion that

17

workers' compensation benefits are not contractual and

18

they are therefore not protected by the contracts clause

19

against -- subsequent legislative impairment.

20

The first reason

We believe, and we have gotten into this a

21

little bit already, but this is inconsistent with the

22

undisputed facts concerning the nature of workers'

23

compensation in Michigan and contrary to many cases that

24

25

contracts clause.

MR. GELLER:

1

Exactly, and Your Honor, that's

2

exactly what the employers in this case did between 1982

3

and 1987 they paid the exact amounts that Michigan had

4

said they were obligated to pay under their workers'

5

compensation obligations, and they took that into account

6

in making a number of business decisions as to what their

7

expenses were during that period.

Oh, but they didn't know under 1985

that they'd made the right calculation.

but you can't say they were darned sure they were going to

MR. GELLER:

19

the reason why the legislature in 1981 passed this

coordination of benefits provision, and I think the

21

Michigan Supreme Court in Chambers asked that question.

22

They did it because the employers in the State were facing

23

extraordinary obligations to pay workers' compensation as

MR. GELLER:

In 1980, Justice White, there had been other amendments to

1

In 1980 -- let me say this to begin with.

2

and the Michigan Supreme Court tries to draw a nexus

3

between the 1980 and 1981 statutes, and they have conjured

4

up this notion that the 1981 statute was in fact a way of

5

dealing with the problem caused in 1980, and that it was a

6

trade-off and that people who didn't get benefit increases

7

in 1981 -- in 1980, were not subject to coordination in

8

1981.

9

there was a nexus here.

There is absolutely no evidence for the notion that

14

were due to employees who were hurt before were the same

15

as the workmen's compensation payments for employees who

17

MR. GELLER:

The obligation to coordinate was

exactly the same and people who were injured prior to 1980

19

did get an increase in benefits in 1980.

But my view is that there was - -

QUESTION:

5

MR. GELLER:

How about those hurt before 1981?
People who were hurt before 1981

6

were entitled to get supplemental workers' compensation

7

benefits under a statute passed in 1980, and some of these

8

benefits were very substantial and led to increases of up

9

to 85 percent in their benefits.

And those workers'

10

compensation benefits, Justice White, those supplemental

11

benefits, were not subject to coordination.
So it is not the case that people who are

12

13

injured prior to 1982 were much worse off in terms of the

14

amount that they collected than people who were injured

15

after 1982.

not a tradeoff.

But the salient point is that there is no

Now, what we suggest is that the situation in

Michigan was indistinguishable from that.

QUESTION:

Would you say the same thing about a

10

MR. GELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, we would.

employer and an employee entered into a contract to pay

12

the minimum wage in return for work and if 5 years later

13

the State decided that the minimum wage had been too low

Every other form of compensation works its way

5

into the contract, and we say that that is the case with

6

workers' compensation as well.

I might say that if the State of Michigan could

8

do this, it could decide for example that the minimum wage

10

the period.1982 and 1987 and it could pass a statute

There are many

All of the cases that respondents rely on, such

has taken a quite different approach when dealing with

Now, the second type of case involves so-called

curative legislation.

upheld retroactive statutes that cured inadvertent

technical defects in prior legislation -- the Heinszen

case, for example, where there was a tariff in effect, but

There's no problem in that type of case because

2

it doesn't destroy any reliance interests.

3

can't upset any settled expectations because they in fact

4

reaffirm what everyone always thought to be the law.

5

On the other hand, this Court has said that

6

retroactive laws that represent changes in legislative

7

policy can't be imposed retroactively because of the

8

fundamental unfairness of imposing new rules of conduct on

9

people who've had -- who've engaged in past completed

10

transactions under different rules of law.

11

classic case for this type of retroactive legislation is

12

the Forbes Pioneer case, where the case tried to enact a

toll and make it retroactive 4 years to a time when a ship

14

had passed through the canal thinking that there was no

On the part, I think, of people

generally, certainly on the part of the legislature, on

the part of the former Governor who had sponsored the

administrative officers who had administered it and had

15

sponsored it as well, as far as the public generally.

And indeed, the author of the opinion in

By January of 1986,

in the Rookledge case, for example, where an election had

previously been required as between accepting a workers'

comp benefit or suing a third-party tort-feasor, the

legislature declared that that election was no longer

required by an amendment to the workers' compensation act.

MR. SACHS:

yes, I know you have so held, but what it is, what the

5

court had said in the earlier cases was that the election

6

was a fatal one, not statute of limitation, but a

7

permanent and irrevocable election, and the court in

8

effect reinstated a claim that did not previously exist.

9

More pertinently to the present circumstances,

10

the reason,why the action was taken here and had in the

11

legislative judgment, which I suggest is the dispositive

12

fact, had to be taken here was that this was the first

13

time in 75 years where the legislature, at least as

construed in the opinion in the legislature, misconstrued

So that there could be no claim of reliance, the

If I may, I want to zero in on the extraordinary

proposition that's urged by General Motors and Ford, under

legislature has said hot only is workers' compensation a

then, the claim is that the contractual theory is that we

to nonsense because ultimately what they are saying is, as

QUESTION:

Your Honor -That's the opinion of the highest

court in the State saying what the legislature meant.
MR. SACHS:

It was -- the Michigan Supreme Court

11

applying a rule of construction and no more, has, by its

12

own acknowledgement, concluded that because the

13

legislature had not adequately indicated an intention not

14

15
16

to apply to previous injuries, that the act would not be
construed to exclude the application to those injuries.
QUESTION:

Well, that's just a long way around

17

of saying, they construed the law and -- as to what the

18

law meant and they are the final authority.

19

MR. SACHS:

Not the final authority, with all

20

respect, Mr. Chief Justice, because then there is another

case before the Michigan Supreme Court, namely this case.

on the 1982 statute, because the Supreme Court of Michigan

MR. SACHS:

Clearly, Your Honor, they had no

expectations based on the Chambers decision, which didn't

18

come down until 1985, the last day in 1985.

Just a few things, Mr. Chief

To begin with, Mr. Sachs claims that he is

a bill that would have made the 1981 statute applicable

only to people injured after 1982, but I would refer the

What he said about the

Forbes case is that this Court held that statute
unconstitutional because it was not rational, but it was

Why should they get - - why should they

The statute was struck down, not because it
wasn't rational to charge people for going through a
canal, but because the statute completely destroyed
