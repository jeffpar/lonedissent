CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We will hear argument

on No. 90-985, Jayne Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health
Clinic.
Mr. Sekulow.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY ALAN SEKULOW
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. SEKULOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In the Eastern District of Virginia, what would
have been a State action for trespass or public nuisance
has now become a Federal case through the application of
the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 to the petitioner's
antiabortion protest activities.

The U.S. District Court

for the Eastern District of Virginia now monitors State
obstruction actions. This case should not be in Federal
court.
The Fourth Circuit holding rests on two faulty
legal premises.

First, that opposition to abortion

constitutes invidious discrimination against women, and
that petitioners' activities violate the respondents'
constitutional right to interstate travel.

The

interpretation of the lower courts goes a long way in
making 1985(3) the general Federal tort law that this

Court has long counselled against.
There is redress available, and that is in the

2

3

circuit courts of Virginia, for trespass, for public

4

nuisance.

5

injunctions involving these type of activities.

6

those courts of appeal have approved the injunctions which

7

prohibited trespass and blockades, and basically word for

8

word, comma for comma, with regard to the same substantive

9

issue as the Federal courts here.

10

And 12 State court of appeals have reviewed
All of

And that is prohibiting

trespass.
We think it is important to point out that the

11
12

court operated under the assumption that opposition to

13

abortion constitutes invidious discrimination against

14

women.

15

Ellis said that it is indisputable that all the defendants

16

share a deep commitment to the goals of stopping the

17

practice of abortion and reversing its legalization.

18

stated that the defendants and their followers hope to

19

prevent abortion, to dissuade women from seeking the

20

clinic's abortion services, and to impress upon members of

21

society the moral righteousness and intensity of their

22

anti-abortion views.

23

This despite the court's finding of facts.

Judge

He

The court, however, comes to an illogical

24

conclusion of law that those purposes constitute invidious

25

discrimination against women.

Our position is that that

statement and that conclusion is wrong, and the Fourth

2

Circuit should be reversed.

3

of this act to the petitioner's activities has been

4

reviewed by numerous Federal courts.

5

most courts have applied the act.

*\

The issue of the application

And quite frankly,

6

But we think the mistake that the lower courts

7

have made is applying the act to an activity that is not

8

within the scope of this statute as it relates to

9

classifications protected.

Certainly gender, in and of

10

itself, could be and would be protected under this act.

11

But here, the class has been defined not by gender, but

12

rather by an activity; seeking abortion.

13

doubt that the opposition that the petitioners have in

14

this case is not to women, but rather to the activity of

15

abortion.

16

that.

17

engaged in these activities to rescue fetuses.

18

what the court below said.

19

that was made was that constituted some form of invidious

20

discrimination against women.

QUESTION:

There is no

The court itself stated that the petitioners
That's

And the illogical conclusion

Is it your point that a group who

22

perform a particular activity cannot qualify as a group

23

for purposes of the invidious discrimination necessary?

25

MR. SEKULOW:

Your Honor, yes.

that it doesn't focus on activity.

Our point is

To be a violation

are, not on something they want to do.

QUESTION:

Why couldn't you

who oppose the -- oppose the war in Kuwait, or who opposed

World War II, or whatever, why isn't that a group?

Why is that?

And here, it was

That's a group not defined by any

mutable characteristics.

13

something they want to do.

It's not a group defined as a
It's defining the class by

This Court, in Griffin, focused in on the animus
that the petitioners' actions would have to be taken

against the particular respondents because of who they

are.

The animus would be at the

Now if they -QUESTION:

And therefore no liability under this

statute, that's your submission?

MR. SEKULOW:

I would think in that case they

would not be, although if they were letting whites

in - - and I think under your hypothetical that they would

14

be.

QUESTION:

Well, not's play with the

hypothetical too much.

often recognizes that it can reach a necessary or a direct

consequence.

But it seems to me that the law

If it is because of, in your

hypothetical, who they are, in this case it would be

designated, and the court below, has been women seeking

But in

abortion.
And as the facts of this case establish, the

3

opposition by the petitioners to the activity of abortion

4

was not just aimed at women.

5

involved in the entire abortion process.

6

petitioners -- yes, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION:

It was aimed at everybody
These

But of course your argument

8

would -- would affect racial classifications as well.

I

9

mean, if there were a group trying to prevent integration

10

of a public school, for example, and blocked access to the

11

schools, by your argument, it wouldn't be covered.

12

MR. SEKULOW:

No, I think it would be in that

13

case, Your Honor, because the animus, Justice O'Connor,

14

would be because they don't want, I would take it in that

15

case, a particular racial group not in that school.

16

here, it is the entire incident of abortion that is the

17

motivating factor that animates these petitioners.

18

not men, it is not women, it is all involved.

QUESTION:

And

It is

But Counsel, supposing you had a

20

class of women, all of whom want abortions.

21

they wore little pins or something so they could be

22

readily identified.

23

and said, don't let any women in who wear those pins.

24

Would that be a class protected by the statute?

25

And assume

I don't think so, Your Honor,

because it would not be motivated by women, it was because

of their activity of voting.

4

QUESTION:

What in the statute, what language in

the statute supports your -- your argument?

5

MR. SEKULOW:

I think the term that would

6

support it best is where the statute says that the purpose

7

of depriving that class and then the equal protection of

8

laws, equal privileges, and immunities has been

9

interpreted by this Court as to require that invidious

class-based animus aimed at the class.

And here it is the

The purpose of preventing the people in the voting

MR. SEKULOW:

That's not within the

of the statute.

1

constitute discrimination against gender.

2

Now it's true that Congress and the public in

3

the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, amended, if you will,

4

but here is still, even in the PDA, an exemption which

5

does not require employers to fund abortion-related

6

insurance needs.

7

certainly was not acting with an invidious discriminatory

8

animus in passing the exemption, the exception of PDA.

9

And I think that points to that Congress

QUESTION:

Of course, Mr. Sekulow, it's sort of

10

hard to parse the statute too closely, isn't it, because

11

even the requirement for any class-based animus is not to

12

be found in this statute, is it?

QUESTION:

The statute is not clear.

If there's any person or class of

there has to be a class-based animus.

MR. SEKULOW:

I don't think it was made up by

this Court.

20

you take the context of the whole, for the purpose of

depriving that class.

privileges and immunities, that's what this Court, looking

23

at in the legislative history -- which I'm hesitant to

bring up, but I will bring up - - pointed to.

a mob tries to prevent both blacks and whites from

wouldn't cover it.

don't think it's consistent with this Court's precedence.

MR. SEKULOW:

Our position, Your Honor, Justice

O'Connor, would be that it would still would not apply

because there still would have to be a class-based animus.

Not that clause.

MR. SEKULOW:

No, not that clause, but the

wording, equal protection of the laws, is the provision on

present.

If the hindrance argument was just going to be that police

QUESTION:

Again, I think you're confusing the

ultimate purpose with the intermediate purpose, and I

8

think both are covered by the statute.

MR. SEKULOW:

And even if they were, Your Honor,

10

even if they were, the animus is not towards women, it's

11

towards an activity.

12

Klux Klan Act, section 2, does not provide substantive

13

relief itself.

14

the substantive right, which respondents have relied on,

15

is the right to interstate travel.

16

believe that there's no violation of interstate travel.

17

There's no proof that the petitioners would have engaged

18

in their activities to deny women their right to

the fact that interstate travel was prevented was not

enough to be a violation of interstate travel.

The Court said what - - would go back now - - when

Then is it entirely on the subjective

purpose of the people who close down the airport.
MR. SEKULOW:

I think it is a subjective test,

Your Honor.

20

even if it was an objective test, in the hypothetical that

21

Your Honor's given, if they closed it down because of what

22

they considered a traffic problem, or something else,

23

that's where you have to take a look at what is

24

motivating, what is animating these particular

25

individuals.

I think the animus has to be subjective.

But

And in the right to travel context, in Griffin,

the allegation in the complaint was that these particular

black people were not being treated equally with white

people as it relates to interstate travel.

5

this Court said that we need to send it back down for

further factual development, that maybe they did purposely

mean to do this.

would constitute a violation of interstate travel.

It was a mere conclusion of law.

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case is not about whether respondents have

a remedy for petitioners' tortious conduct.

12

they also have, in addition, a Federal civil rights remedy

13

for that same conduct.

QUESTION:

This case is about whether

would they not, if they had made the $50,000

They do, in

MR. ROBERTS:

It would have satisfied the

jurisdictional limit, and then could have sued under State

law under diversity.

QUESTION:

And there the findings are a

violation of State law here, aren't there?
MR. ROBERTS:

There are those findings.

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

And that would be covered, wouldn't

it?
MR. ROBERTS:

That would be a conspiracy to

deprive that person of constitutional rights.

What if two or more persons engage

That would not be covered.

Section 1985(3) is directed to the discriminatory

deprivation of rights, not simply the deprivation of

rights.

12

original bill that was introduced to the one they enacted.

13

The original bill made it unlawful to do any act in

14

violation of the rights, privileges, or immunities of

15

another person.

16

That was the change that Congress made from the

It would cover the picketer example.

of reasoning in the Geduldig case.

That's wrong as a matter of law and

As a.matter of law, this Court rejected that line

1

writing for the Court, explained that a classification

2

based on pregnancy was not the same as a gender-based

3

classification, even though only women could become

4

pregnant.

5

Accepting respondents' submission that

6

opposition to abortion is the same as discrimination on

7

the basis of gender, because only women can have

8

abortions, would require overruling the rationale of
Geduldig.
As a matter of logic, for a conspiracy to seek

10
11

to deprive persons of the equal protection of the laws or

12

equal privileges and immunities, the conspirators must

13

seek to deny to some what they would permit to others.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Is Geduldig in tension with Johnson

Controls?
MR. ROBERTS:

I think not, Your Honor.

Johnson

17

Controls, in that case the basic problem was that fertile

18

women were barred from certain jobs because of the danger

1

exposure to lead would have to their offspring, while

20

fertile men were not barred from those same jobs, even

21

though it was shown that the same exposure could affect

22

their offspring.

23

majority opinion, was a gender classification.

24

therefore, it's fully consistent with Geduldig.

25

Johnson Controls, as was noted in the

QUESTION:

In other words -- all right.

MR. ROBERTS:

1

Here petitioners do not seek to

2

deny to some what they would permit to others.

3

to prohibit the practice of abortion all together.

4

Respondents, in their amici, bring up the analogy that

5

opposition to women seeking abortions is just like a

6

conspiracy against blacks seeking to vote.

7

They seek

If you examine the analogy closely, it breaks

8

down.

In the conspiracy against blacks seeking to vote,

9

what animates it is opposition to a group on the basis of

10

race.

11

not opposition to the activity of voting.

12

solely opposition to the activity of abortion.

13

It is blacks that they do not want to vote.

It's

Here it is

As a matter of logic, you cannot deprive a class

14

of equal protection or equal privileges and immunities

15

with respect to a right that only that class can exercise.

16

You can certainly conspire to deprive them of that right,

17

but it is not a denial of equal protection or equal

18

privileges and immunities.

19

Respondents also have no cause of action under

20

section 1985(3) because the right for which they seek a

21

remedy, the constitutional right to travel, is not

22

implicated in this case.

23

violation of the right to travel in the absence of either

24

discrimination between residents, on the one hand, and

25

nonresidents, or newcomers, on the other, as in Doe v.

into neither of those categories.

Respondents would find a violation of the

12

constitutional right to travel based solely on two facts.

14

One, some of the patients at these clinics come from out

15

of State, and two, petitioners blocked access to the

16

clinics.

17

would find a violation in every case, almost every case,

18

for example, of a picket line, so long as some of the

workers or customers were from out of State.

has never accepted such an unlimited view.

QUESTION:

This Court

Mr. Roberts, if the evidence

22

established that one of the purposes was to prevent or

23

hinder local police from putting an end to the

24

demonstration and the blockade, do you think that 1985(3)

25

in that second clause would cover it?

First of

all, no such allegation was made in the complaint.

4

No, I don't, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I said if that -- if the facts

established that.

5

MR. ROBERTS:

If the facts established that, I

6

think that we would still be back to the class-based

7

animus requirement.

8

just as the immediately preceding clause, which is the one

9

at issue in this case, the requirement that it be a

The prevent and hinder clause has,

10

deprivation of equal protection.

11

interpreted that language in the clause at issue here to

12

require the class-based invidiously discriminatory animus.

13

And I think the word equal should carry the same meaning

14

in the second clause.

15

the amendment process, just as the words equal were added

16

in the immediately preceding clause.

17

This Court, in Griffin,

Particularly since it was added in

To continue, there were no such findings in this

18

case.

And I also think it would be a difficult question

19

whether under the facts that were alleged, you prevent or

20

hinder State authorities when you simply are arrested.

21

That's not preventing them from doing their job, that's

22

allowing them to do their job.

23

hinder clause was directed to were the classic case of

24

lynching, where there is affirmative disruption and

25

interference with the State authorities.

QUESTION:

asking that Roe v. Wade be overruled?

Mr. Roberts, in this case are you

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor, the issue doesn't

even come up.
QUESTION:

6

Well, that hasn't prevented the

7

Solicitor General from taking that position in prior

8

cases.

9

you're relying on Doe against Bolton here?

Three or four of them in a row.

MR. ROBERTS:

10

Is it because you

We are not relying on Doe against

11

Bolton.

12

brother is the one relying on it.

13

because that was an affirmative case of discrimination --

14
15
16

We distinguish Doe against Bolton.

QUESTION:

I believe my

And we distinguish it

But you cited it a little while ago

affirmatively.
MR. ROBERTS:

I cited it for the proposition

17

that this Court's right to travel cases have hinged on

18

discrimination and between residents and nonresidents.

19

And that's not at issue here.

20

O'Connor has explained, the right to travel is based on

21

the privileges and immunities clause, then I think it

22

becomes quite clear that it's not implicated.

23

states, to paraphrase, that a citizen of State A, when he

24

moves into State B, or travels into State B, must have all

25

the privileges and immunities of a citizen of State B.

1

Of course if your office prevailed in

2

its suggestion that Roe against Wade be overruled, Doe

against Bolton would go with it, will it not?

I'm not sure, Your Honor.

against Bolton is a discrimination case.

9

alleged in the complaint.

I think that's a separate

The right to an abortion is not implicated

Neither of the lower courts relied on that ground
They relied solely on the

10

constitutional right to travel, which, as I've indicated,

11

is not implicated in this case.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

It seems to me you've slipped a

stitch here somewhere.
QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, did your answer to

15

Justice O'Connor's question depend on the size of the

16

conspiracy?

17

people, only two people went to the clinic, you could

18

answer quite plausibly as you did that they certainly were

19

not conspiring to preclude the police from arresting them

20

because they were easily arrestable and were arrested.

21

you have 2,000 who go to the clinic, and the point of the

22

conspiracy is to act in this massive fashion, then isn't

23

it more reasonable to analyze the conspiracy as, one, in

24

effect, to preclude the enforcement of laws against

25

trespass, against assault, and so on?

For example, if you had a conspiracy of two

And wouldn't your

(202)289-2260

If

1

answer be different if you consider the size?
MR. ROBERTS:

2

If I may, the answer would be the

3

same, Your Honor, because regardless of the size of the

4

conspiracy, the class-based animus requirement continues

5

under the prevent and hinder clause.

6

there was simply no class-based animus, either under the

7

first clause under which the respondents have relied, or

8

the prevent or hinder clause.

Mr. Schafer, was any reliance ever

placed in the courts below by your clients on this second

clause of section 1985, for the purpose of hindering or

5

preventing the constituted authorities from securing all

6

laws?

7

MR. SCHAFER:

This case, Justice O'Connor, was

8

tried 9 days after the complaint was filed.

And the

complaint did not make a hinder or prevent claim.

evidence then developed it.

13

But the evidence established a hinder -- in my

14

judgment --a hinder and prevent claim.

Although courts below have not made findings on

Mr. Schafer, your position is that

that hinder claim does not require any class-based animus.

No, I agree with that.

I would not consent that it doesn't -- I think

QUESTION:

Because otherwise, the question I was

going to ask you, if it doesn't require class-based

animus, then I suppose you would have had to apply that

MR. SCHAFER:

QUESTION:

5

apply to something like that?

You wouldn't assert that it would

MR. SCHAFER:

6

Yes.

As I read Griffin, I think the

7

class-based animus is written into the statute by the

8

equal protection and equal privileges and immunities
clause.

And I think that the evidence, as I say, the odd

10

thing in this case is that under the Federal rules, we

11

could amend our complaint today to accommodate the

12

finding -- the facts that were developed in a Court below,

13

and we don't even have to amend a complaint under the

14

Federal rules to make that claim, because the Federal

15

rules provide that if the evidence establishes a claim,

16

the pleadings will be deemed to be amended to encompass

17

that claim.

18

And I think that we do have that claim based on

1

these facts.

20

the Court knows, that the tactics of these people are to

21

frustrate law enforcement.

22

where they're going to set up their blockades of clinics,

23

which clinics are going to be blockaded.

24

the dates, but they don't announce where, and so local

25

police and authorities don't know where.

And these facts are basically, as I'm sure

5

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Schafer, if section 1985

6

does extend to gender-based class animus, how can you pick

7

out a subset of that class and say that's the class?
MR. SCHAFER:

8

9

We don't do that, Your Honor.

They keep saying we do that, but that's not what we do.

10

Our contention is simply this; that when you target a

11

right of a class and attempt to take away that class'

12

constitutional right, you are discriminating against that

13

class, the entire class.

the way they do it is target the women who are exercising

the right.

But the losers, if they win, the losers are

I think that's right.

So it is not

MR. SCHAFER:

Well, the purpose, though, the

whole effort is to take away the right to choose.

QUESTION:

Not the

The right of women to choose to have

and men by saying to women who are capable of bearing

2

children, you may not have certain jobs, that's a

discrimination not against just them, it's a

discrimination against all women.

And in Satty, when the employer says when you

impacted by the discrimination, it's a discrimination

The first is if the doctors

denied any right or privilege of a citizen of the United

22

States, or if they suffer injury by their person or

destroy the abortion right, I suppose yes, they do.

I

1

don't know why they wouldn't, offhand.
QUESTION:

2

In other words, you could put them in

3

the same position as the Republicans who were referred to

4

as one of the class to be protected by the statute at the

5

time it was passed. Kind of an ancillary category which

6

essentially gets its foot in the door by being ancillary

7

to a primarily protected category.

As I - - certainly as I read the

legislative history, that was the intent there, as you, I

guess suggest.

see that if that action were brought that it would be

subject to a motion to dismiss by matter of course of this

case.

And I do think that there's no - - I don't

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

I don't

My second question goes

16

back to Mr. Roberts' answer with respect to the

17

applicability of Johnson Controls.

I don't think the

discrimination against women and there's absolutely no - -

what the underlying facts were as to whether there was

grounds for a distinction drawn between men and women in

that the police cannot enforce the law?
MR. SCHAFER:

a class-based animus -- class-based discrimination, not

12

animus, discrimination.

13

14

by - - that women's right is the one that's targeted here,

and when you try to take away that right, you're trying to

16

take away a woman's right, and you are therefore

17

discriminating against women, just as in Griffin when you

18

tried to take away the civil rights of African-Americans,

19

you were discriminating against African Americans, and you

had a cause of action under 1985(3).

Any conspiracy that's animated by an invidious

only two that are really at issue here are the

It seems to me worth at least noting that this

MR. SCHAFER:

Well, it's just that the effort

here is to destroy the right to choose, to frustrate it,

11

to prevent it being exercised, hopefully to eliminate it.

12

Now when you do that, you're directly targeting a right of

Just a few points.

1

With regard to the issue in

2

Johnson Controls, the basis of the Court's opinion, or a

3

significant portion of that opinion states that the bias

4

in Johnson Control's policy is obvious.

5

not fertile women are given a choice as to whether they

6

wish to risk their reproductive health.

7

further; first Johnson Control's policy classifies on the

8

basis of gender and child-bearing capacity rather than

9

fertility alone.

Fertile men, but

With regard to the right to privacy, counsel, my

20

So the right to

With regard to the issue of the right to travel,

21

as Justice Scalia has said, it has to be purposeful

22

because the statute in and of itself says that the

23

activities have to be engaged in for the purpose of

24

depriving a class, here described as women seeking

25

abortion, their constitutional right to interstate travel.

QUESTION:

7

MR. SEKULOW:

8

QUESTION:

9

May I ask you a question?
Yes, sir.

And I'm not sure of the significance

of it, but I notice one of the findings was that these

10

rescues have been taking place in many places across the

11

country and have been enjoined in New York, Pennsylvania,

12

Washington, Connecticut, California, as well as the

13

Washington metropolitan area.

14

relevance to the interstate aspect?

15

MR. SEKULOW:

Does that have any

I do not think so, Your Honor,

16

because again, I think we have to look at what this Court

17

has said, plus the statute itself requiring purposeful

18

action.

19

findings of fact point out, it was Judge Ellis'

20

determination that the activities, if they were to have

21

taken place, of the petitioners, would have had an effect

22

on interstate travel, not that there was a purposeful

23

violation of the right to interstate travel.

24
25

And here it's clear there was not.

QUESTION:

And as the

in this case without relying on the interstate travel?

MR. SEKULOW:

prevail?

Do I think that respondents can

No, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

Why not?

4

MR. SEKULOW:

Because their sole independent

5

right that is at stake here is interstate travel.

6

they -- the interpretation respondents have given, Justice

7

White, to the statute is pre the limiting amendment.

8

is they've eliminated the requirement of denial of

9

equality.

10

Plus

It's any constitutional action and that is not

what is at stake here.
And with regard to the State action issue, the

11

12

State claims, as Judge Ellis pointed out, a public

13

nuisance can be brought by a private party in a State

14

circuit court in Virginia, and in fact, they have been

15

brought in Virginia circuit courts, and they have been

16

issued.
