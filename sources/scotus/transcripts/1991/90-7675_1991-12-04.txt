CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Cleary.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD J. CLEARY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEARY:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Each generation must reaffirm the guarantee of

10
11

the First Amendment with the hard cases.

12

understood the dangers of orthodoxy and standardized

13

thought and chose liberty.

14

The framers

We are once again faced with a case that will

15

demonstrate whether or not there is room for the freedom

16

for the thought that we hate, whether there is room for

17

the eternal vigilance necessary for the opinions that we

18

loathe.

19

The conduct in this case is reprehensible, is

20

abhorrent, and is well-known by now.

I'm not here to

21

defend the alleged conduct, but as Justice Frankfurter

22

said 40 years ago, history has shown that the safeguards

23

of liberty are generally forged in cases involving not

24

very nice people.

25

involving cases involving very ugly fact situations.

He might just as well have well said,

1

I am here to discuss and to ask the Court to

2

review the Minnesota supreme court's interpretation of a

3

St. Paul ordinance.

4

QUESTION:

Justice -Mr. Cleary, in reading your briefs,

5

it appeared to me that you were arguing a case other than

6

the one presented, which I thought involved the statute as

7

construed by the Minnesota supreme court.

8

MR. CLEARY:

9

QUESTION:

I did go into great -Now, do you agree at this point that

10

we are looking at the statute as the Minnesota supreme

11

court has interpreted it?

12

MR. CLEARY:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Yes.
Not as it could theoretically have

been interpreted?
MR. CLEARY:

Yes.

The reason I went into as

16

much detail as I did with the ordinance as written was to

17

show the distance from A to B and the attempt to narrowly

18

construe that law.

19

right under Federal statute to construe their laws.

20

QUESTION:

We have to acknowledge the State has a

And in essence what the Minnesota

21

supreme court appears to have said is, we interpret the

22

law as reaching only those exceptions that the Supreme

23

Court has recognized to the First Amendment -- fighting

24

words, for instance, out of our prior Chaplinsky case.

25

Now, do you agree that that's what they've done?

MR. CLEARY:

1

I agree that the Court attempted to

2

narrow the ordinance and in doing so cited Chaplinsky and

3

Brandenburg to this Court.

4

QUESTION: . Right, and in essence they said what

5

that statute means is what the Supreme Court has permitted

6

in Brandenburg and Chaplinsky.

7

MR. CLEARY:

They did cite those cases, Your

8

Honor.

9

that was used shows a much broader reach than what this

10

I do believe, however, that the expansive language

Court indicated in those cases.
In discussing Chaplinsky they cite several times

11

12

the afflict injury dictum from that case.

13

standard that was very close to an offensiveness standard

14

and.raises the adverse emotional harm idea from the

15

Hustler Magazine case in that the outrageousness standard

16

is raised, and it really opens a hole to the First

17

Amendment.

18

QUESTION:

That took a

Well, if we thought that the

19

Minnesota court recognized that the Minnesota statute

20

reaches only what was said in Chaplinsky could survive and

21

in Brandenburg what survived, would you still be here?

22

23

MR. CLEARY:

I would still object to the

ordinance as construed, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

25

overturn those older holdings.

So you would ask us to somehow

MR. CLEARY:

No, I don't believe it's necessary

2

to do that, Your Honor, to get to the position that I'm

3

requesting.

4

cited Chaplinsky and Brandenburg, the lower court, but in

5

doing so in Brandenburg, for instance, they refer to the

6

provocative standard, and the Government may censor

7

provocative conduct, and it does so in a manner where it

8

cites the likely to incite imminent lawless action as

9

opposed to the likely to and directed to, and I think the

The Court has acknowledged that the court

10

real significance of that is that you could have a hostile

11

audience censor the expression.

12

Brandenburg was written in terms of a sympathetic

13

audience, and I believe you get into the heckler's veto

14

problem if you allow that type of interpretation, and the

15

language of that opinion, combined with the language of

16

the ordinance as originally written, really leaves that

17

open as a possibility - - as a significant possibility,

18

combined with the injury language from Chaplinsky.

19

I believe that

The problem is that the language is so broad

20

that it leaves open the possibility of an outrageousness

21

standard, a dignity standard as imposed, and just

22

generally an offensiveness standard, and that is --

23

QUESTION:

Well, in your view, what is the

24

constitutional boundaries for the fighting words doctrine,

25

only those words which would provoke some other person to

an assault on the speaker, physical assault?
MR. CLEARY:

2

From this Court's opinions, Your

3

Honor, I believe it's limited to those words that bring on

4

an immediate breach of peace, the reflexive violence idea.

5

I don't believe that the Court has construed, nor did the

6

New Hampshire court originally construe, the inflict

7

injury dictum as part of that holding.

8

Court has limited that to immediate breach of the peace

9

type of cases.
QUESTION:

10

I believe the

May a State validly proscribe words

11

that cause alarm and fear for one's safety, even if the

12

fear for the breach of the safety is some act that will

13

occur maybe 24 hours, 48 hours later?

14

MR. CLEARY:

I believe so, Your Honor, and I

15

believe so in terms of a viewpoint-neutral type of law

16

that may address the content of what you're referring to

17

but would do so in terms of immediate breach of peace, or

18

would do so in terms of another law such as a threat law,

19

a terrorist or threat law which I think would be

20

permissible and even fit the alleged fact situation in

21

this case.

22

this case, for instance, certainly in the fact situation

23

there were laws available to the State, significant and

24

hard and tough laws, to deal with an ugly fact situation.

25

I don't mean to downplay the victims -- in

Instead, they chose a law that's not as serious,

that addresses and attempts to address expression and the

2

content of that expression with interest in its

3

communicative impact, which is a totally different type

4

of

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Cleary, isn't one of your

6

complaints that the Minnesota statute as construed by the

7

supreme court of Minnesota punishes only some fighting

8

words and not others?

9

MR. CLEARY:

It is, Your Honor.

That is one of

10

my positions, that in doing so, even though it is a

11

subcategory, technically, of unprotected conduct, it still

12

is picking out an opinion, a disfavored message, and

13

making that clear through the State.

14

idea, and the problem that we have is that the Government

15

must not betray neutrality, and I believe it does, even

16

when it picks out a subcategory.

It's a paternalistic

17

With the First Amendment, it does not

18

necessarily follow that if you punish the greater you can

19

punish the lesser.

20

posting of signs, for instance, somewhat akin to Vincent,

21

and if we had in there including but not limited to signs

22

regarding the Democratic Party symbols, now that might be

23

a mere example, and it might be a subcategory, but I

24

believe this Court would be offended by that.

25

If we had a law that banned the

1

betraying sympathy or hostility to a political viewpoint,

2

and I believe the same principle is in course here,

3

because I think the problem we have is that we have - -

regardless of whether those symbols are mere examples, we

5

have the possibility, the real possibility, that we have a

Government signaling its disagreement with the particular

type of opinion.

QUESTION:

Do you understand the Supreme Court

of Minnesota to have decided one way or another whether

10

the conduct of this particular petitioner is included in

11

the statute?

12

MR. CLEARY:

No, I did not decide -- I did not

13

see their opinion as directly deciding whether or not the

14

conduct of the petitioner was included.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

It left that presumably for the State

district court.

I thought you asked whether it was tried.
QUESTION:

6

Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood the

If they did send it back for trial,

7

is it not necessarily true that they held that the

8

allegations in the complaint alleged a violation of the

9

statute?

10

MR. CLEARY:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

11

because it was an overbreadth challenge and I think what

12

they were saying was that the ordinance itself was

13

constitutional after the narrow construction, but I --

14

QUESTION:

But in the other case you cite, or

15

your opponent, I guess, that's the S.L.J. case, when they

16

narrowly construed it they said, therefore the conduct

17

isn't within the statute and they dismissed the charge.

18
19
20

22

MR. CLEARY:

They did.

They handled that in a

different fashion than they handled this case.
QUESTION:

But you think they left open the

question whether the complaint should be dismissed or not
MR. CLEARY:

Well, I think they left open how

23

the ordinance, once narrowly construed, would affect this

24

alleged conduct, yes.

25

the opinion is such that they are - -

I mean, the defendant ought to know whether

QUESTION:

I don't understand.

Mr. Cleary, I don't understand the

comments you made earlier in response to the Chief

Justice.

examples of a general prohibition.

I mean, it does

1

but in fact the text of the ordinance is limited to

2

causing alarm or resentment for only certain reasons, and

3

if you cause alarm or resentment for other reasons, that

4

is not unlawful under the ordinance, isn't that right?

5

MR. CLEARY:

6

QUESTION:

7

That's what you said to me, was it

not?
MR. CLEARY:

8

9

That is right.

Well, what I said was, the

respondent's position is that these were mere examples and

10

that there was not a viewpoint selected and discriminated

11

against.

12

QUESTION:

Yes, and I thought you said, even if

13

that is so, and I didn't understand you to be

14

contradicting that categorically.

15

MR. CLEARY:

Well, I am - - I am suggesting

16

that's not true.

17

scenario, that if the Court were to believe that they were

18

mere examples, that there's still problems with the narrow

19

construction in that it does not address speech that would

20

not be - - that would either be tolerant or would be

21

intolerant in other areas, and in that sense it's

22

betraying a viewpoint from the Government that is no

23

longer neutral.

that sense.

How do you -- where do you want to

draw the line?
MR. CLEARY:

Well, I'm not suggesting the Court

need overrule Chaplinsky, which talks about immediate

11

breach of peace, and those would not necessarily have to

12

be threatening words.

13

QUESTION:

What I am suggesting is that when

I guess I was drawing the Chaplinsky

distinction between the fighting words and the words that

MR. CLEARY:

I think the Court was talking about

two separate categories.

have to say that that simply was a mistaken statement and

MR. CLEARY:

No, I don't believe so.

that the Court must draw the line in favor of the

I think that if the

Well, I agree, but aren't you really

14

coming to the point of saying that the Chaplinsky

15

reference to words that injure was in fact, at least by

today's standards, an erroneous reference and we should

MR. CLEARY:

QUESTION:

MR. CLEARY:

I am.
Okay.
The debate in this case is not

21

about the wisdom of eradicating intolerance, the debate is

22

about the method of reaching that goal.

the city council officials in this case and in other

communities are very well-meaning, and that's usually the

I believe that

cross the line from the Fourteenth Amendment duty of the

2

State to not participate in any racist State action or any

3

intolerant State action, in that sense, with the First

4

Amendment right of self-expression, even if it be

5

intolerant, provided it does not cross the line of illegal

6

conduct itself.

7

I believe the danger in a law like this is that

8

it does pick out viewpoints, that it is

9

viewpoint-discriminatory, and that there's nothing to stop

10

another State from taking a law just like this, having a

11

different symbol such as -- and it uses the example in the

12

briefs of the Star of David -- and suggesting that you can

13

narrowly construe that to fighting words, that leaving

that open to the law enforcement officials, it's not only

MR. CLEARY:

It's constitutional in the sense

that immediate breach of peace is still good law under

I do, Your Honor, in the sense, not

Justice Brandeis once said that fear breeds repression and

the First Amendment in that there are many groups that

would like to encroach upon its principles with

well-meaning intentions, but in doing so, they are still

21

punishing the content of the communication and they are

doing so in a discriminatory manner, and the government is

think would be much easier to litigate than the inflict

MR. CLEARY:

That's correct, Chief Justice.

I

think that the Court's holding in Texas v. Johnson

supports the petitioner's position in this case, and I

4

also would point out that I do not think that the dissents

5

are necessarily inconsistent with the petitioner's

position on this law.

7

I would say that is particularly true because of

8

the fact that this Court put a great emphasis on the

unique nature of the American flag and in doing so, I

believe acknowledged the Stromberg red flag of the '30's,

the black armband in the '60's, a tinker, and was mindful

of the fact that once that door is opened, that it could

It is hard to draw the line on - There are 15 policemen there when the

in that sense.

MR. CLEARY:

There is certainly communication

and it certainly could be considered a threat, and I

believe a prosecution pursuant to a viewpoint-neutral law

Well, Mr. Foley, would you address

the concern expressed by your opponent that the ordinance

is limited to only fighting words that arouse anger,

alarm, or resentment on the basis of race, color, creed,

10

11

could cause the same reaction in people?

12
13

The argument is that the statute is
underinclusive.

14

MR. FOLEY:

Your Honor, it's our position that

15

the statute is not underinclusive, that this is a fighting

16

words case, that this is unprotected conduct under the

First Amendment, and that the City of St. Paul has the

right to determine which harms it can proscribe within the

QUESTION:

So why, I mean, how can you possibly

say it isn't content-based to that extent?
MR. FOLEY:

8

9

That's correct, Your Honor.

Your Honor, we have alternative

theories that it is content-based, but it is unprotected

10

conduct because it is fighting words, but we also believe

11

that the main purpose of the ordinance is not to limit

12

freedom of expression in that the harm that it's

13

attempting to regulate is neutral and it could be

14

considered content-neutral under the Renton-Barnes

15

analysis that this Court has engaged in, but even if the

16

Court feels that it is content-based, that there is a

17

compelling State purpose in public safety and order and

safety of their citizens for the City of St. Paul to pass

such an ordinance.
QUESTION:

Why is that?

Mr. Foley, suppose you,

9

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Isn't it true that the, at least up

10

to now, that any concept we may have had of fighting words

11

has been a concept which took fighting words as a whole

12

and assumed that to the extent that they could be

13

punished, they would be punished as fighting words, not as

14

categories within fighting words?

15

your view, we would be making new law, wouldn't we?

16
17
18

MR. FOLEY:

So that if we accepted

I don't believe we would be making

new law under that analysis.
I think under the fighting words doctrine, if

19

there is action that either inflicts injury or causes

20

immediate breach of the peace and under this particular

21

ordinance as construed by the Minnesota supreme court,

22

there has to be action combined with an intent to cause

23

that action with the defined affect of being based on the

24

race, in this particular case, of the Jones family.

My understanding of the Minnesota

It could either be the inflicts injury prong of the

QUESTION:

Going back to your earlier answer, if

I understand it, with respect to the infliction of injury-

10

point, your theory is that because the category of words

that inflict injury are outside First Amendment

identified by means of content.

MR. FOLEY: I believe, Justice White, your first

10

question is that it would have been unconstitutional as

11

written under the Gooding decision, and when the Lewis

12

case was sent back in light of Gooding, the Louisiana

to follow the directions of this Court as precisely as it

In reference to Justice White's and Justice

O'Connor's observations, this is Lewis, this is not

This is not marginal effects on the First
