ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

9

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
MR. MINEAR:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case arises from the Federal Reserve

12

13

Board's attempts to regulate MCorp, a Texas-based bank

14

holding company that is operating in bankruptcy as debtor

15

in possession.

16

court sitting in bankruptcy may enjoin the Federal Reserve

17

Board from conducting a proceeding to determine whether

18

MCorp is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices.

19

issue turns on the meaning of Section 1818 of the

20

Financial Institutions Supervisory Act, also known as

21

FISA.

22

The basic issue is whether a district

That

Section 1818, subsection (b), provides that the

23

Federal Reserve Board may initiate a proceeding like the

24

one involved here to investigate a bank holding company's

25

practices and to issue, if necessary, a cease-and-desist

Subsection (h) further provides that an aggrieved

Subsection (i) then states as follows, and I

"Except as otherwise provided in this section, no

court shall have jurisdiction to affect, by injunction or

7

otherwise, the issuance or enforcement of any notice or

8

order under this section, or to review, modify, suspend,
terminate, or set aside any such notice or order."

10

We submit that Section 1818 (i) means what it

11

says, and it prohibits any court, including a district

12

court sitting in bankruptcy, from interfering with the

13

Board's ongoing proceedings.

14

QUESTION:

Now Congress -- suppose the district

15

court hadn't done anything except to say -- except to

16

remind the Board that the statute says that there's an

17

automatic stay of all proceedings.

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, Your Honor, the Bankruptcy

Code does provide an automatic stay.

QUESTION:

Does that apply to everything that

the Board was doing?
MR. MINEAR:

Well, it certainly applies to an

5

action to cease and desist an unlawful practice, and that

is what the Board has asserted here.

9

QUESTION:

The lower court's ruling was not

based on the automatic stay provision.
MR. MINEAR:

That is correct.

It did not even

10

reach that issue, and it rejected all of MCorp's

11

bankruptcy allegations.

12

largely agreed with our construction of Section 1818(i),

13

that it would prohibit any such proceeding in the

14

bankruptcy court in accordance with bankruptcy law.

15

further held, however, that this Court's decision in

16

Leedom v. Kyne, provided the court with inherent

17

jurisdiction to enjoin the Board's proceedings.

18

The court of appeals, in fact,

Now we have petitioned this Court to review the

Leedom holding, while MCorp has petitioned on the

bankruptcy law issues.

22

continuing source of confusion for the lower courts.

3

held, however, that a judicial review action could proceed

4

notwithstanding the absence of any particular judicial

5

proceeding that was specified by statute.

6

that a cause of action could be inferred because the

absence of jurisdiction under the specific facts there

8

would amount to the obliteration of congressionally

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Minear, could I ask you whether

2

under FISA the Board is ever able to compel the bank

3

holding company to spend its assets to take care of the

4

subsidiary banks before an Article III court has had a

5

chance to review the Board's order?
MR. MINEAR:

6

7
8

9

Has it ever done so or can it do

so?
QUESTION:

Is it possible under the law that the

Board can compel that transfer of assets before a court

10

has had a chance to review it?

11

MR. MINEAR:

12

13
14

It could issue an order, but that

order would immediately be subject to judicial review.
QUESTION:

It's immediately subject to appeal

and judicial review.

15

MR. MINEAR:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, and the Board -And the minute that happens, is it

17

also theoretically possible then, that a bankruptcy court

18

could have jurisdiction?

19

MR. MINEAR:

That point might be debatable.

One

20

point, to clarify as to the first point that you made.

21

The -- an order from the Board will not be effective for

22

30 days from the point of issuance, so that provides a

23

30-day window to seek judicial relief.

24
25

The second question you raised was whether a
bankruptcy court would be able to review that.

Under FISA

1

Section 1818(h), a court of appeals is vested with the

2

jurisdiction to review the orders of the Board.

3

it's a possible argument that the bankruptcy court might

4

have authority to review it under 1334(b).

5

QUESTION:

I suppose

Wouldn't you then get the priority

6

section under the Bankruptcy Code if somebody went to the

7

bankruptcy court and said, look, now we're here, and

8

couldn't they apply their jurisdiction at that stage?

9

MR. MINEAR:

Well, first of all, this is not a

10

claim in bankruptcy as you might -- arise from a debtor.

11

MCorp is not being obligated to pay any money at all to

12

the Federal Reserve Board.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MINEAR:

15
16

Rather, it's been required --

It could happen, presumably.
That MCorp could be required to pay

money to the Fed?
QUESTION:

No, no, no, no.

That you could have

17

this overlapping jurisdiction in a given situation, if the

18

funds were ordered transferred.

19

MR. MINEAR:

It could be that there would be

20

overlapping jurisdiction at some point, but I think that

21

question, of course, is premature here.

22

is go forward with our proceeding.

23

debatable point whether the bankruptcy court would, in

24

fact, have -- concurrent jurisdiction in that situation.

25

It would depend in part on whether the order affected --

2

think.

preclusive effect of Section 1818 (i).

And it would also depend on the scope with the

QUESTION:

4

Do you think there are any limits on

5

the authority of the Board to determine what's an unsound

6

banking practice and to the relief that it can order?
MR. MINEAR:

7

Oh, certainly there are limits, but

8

nevertheless, Congress has not defined that term.

9

Board is entitled to make a reasonable judgment on this,

10

and its views are entitled to deference.
QUESTION:

11
12

And has the Board been consistent in

its view of its power?
MR. MINEAR:

13

On this particular question, yes it

14

has.

15

that opens up a broad array of possible forms of

16

mismanagement that might arise.

17

And the

As with respect to unsafe and unsound practices,

QUESTION:

You want to get Leedom, but while

18

we're on Justice O'Connor's question, assume that the

19

Board conducts its proceedings, issues its orders, and

20

there is then an appeal to the circuit court which

21

ratifies the Board's order.

22

order to MCorp to transfer property to subsidiary banks.

23

At that point does 1334(d) come into effect so that the

24

bankruptcy court then has jurisdiction to review the

25

propriety of that order transferring property?

At that point, there is an

Well, 1334(d) gives the bankruptcy-

5

If the order has been approved, the first thing -- has

6

been subject of judicial review and has been upheld, the

7

first question would be the content of that order.

8

might be that the order will simply direct MCorp to put

together a plan for providing capital to its subsidiary

banks.
If MCorp is subject to such an order, I assume

11
12

that it would go to the bankruptcy court and seek such

13

relief, that this is outside the ordinary course of *

14

business.

15

provided it falls within 363(c) of the Bankruptcy Code,

16

but it's a matter within the ordinary course of business.

17

Assuming it's not, MCorp would go to the bankruptcy court

18

and seek approval.of its plan to comply with the Board's

19

order.

20

a law that MCorp has to apply -- has to comply with.

21

MCorp could provide money to its subsidiaries,

But the Eoard's order should simply be treated as

And as this Court indicated in the Midlantic

22

National Bank case, simply being a debtor in possession

23

does not exempt you from other regulatory requirement.

QUESTION:

And I take it works that way under

the National Labor Relations Act.

If a bankrupt is

1

subject to an NLRB action, it simply goes to the circuit

2

court, the NLRB is either -- if the NLRB is affirmed, then

3

any property transfer is under the control of the

4

bankruptcy court, and the bankruptcy court is simply bound

5

by that decree.
MR. MINEAR:

6

I believe that is the case.

And

7

there are cases such as Nathanson v. NLRB, which is a

8

pre-code case, which indicates that the bankruptcy court

9

should defer to the agency in terms of even liquidating

10

back pay agreements.

Now, of course, that's far down

11

stream from where we are right now.

12

whether the Board should be allowed to go forward with its

13

proceeding in this case.

14

stymied in even going forward with its administrative

15

proceeding here.

Our question is just

The Board has been completely

Now as I was saying, Congress has carefully

considered the question of appropriate judicial relief in

this case, and that clearly distinguishes this case from

Leedom.

20

opportunity to seek judicial review of the Board's action

21

once the Board definitively acts.

22

Congress has been quite express and explicit in stating

23

that MCorp has no right to review at all until the Board

24

completes its administrative investigation and determines

25

whether it will issue an order.

Congress has provided that MCorp will have full

4

5

there has been no administrative proceeding, and it's

6

unclear at this point what action the Board might take.

7

That's all that is

As a result of the lower court's

MCorp really makes no serious attempt to defend

8

the court of appeals' Leedom rationale.

In fact, its

9

brief it devotes a mere two paragraphs to the Leedom

10

question.

11

limitations do not apply in the bankruptcy context.

12

as the court of appeals stated, that is simply not so.

13

is important to recall the precise language of Section

14

1818 (i):

15

court shall have jurisdiction to enjoin the Board's

16

ongoing proceedings.

17

for bankruptcy courts, and the bankruptcy law itself

18

contains no such exception.

19

MCorp argues instead that Section 1818's
And
It

That provision contains no exception

Now as I mentioned before, MCorp has attempted

20

to find an exemption in the Bankruptcy Code's automatic

It's important to remember also that the Board

3

initiated the proceeding here to determine when - - whether

MCorp, which continues to function as a bank holding

company, is in violation of the safety and soundness

requirements of the Board.

Court's words, does not give a debtor in possession carte

blanche to ignore regulatory requirements.
Here MCorp has elected to continue in operation

10
11

and continue to own banks and continue to operate banks.

12

Thus the need for Board oversight remains.

13

MCorp continues such operations, it should be subject to

14

the same regulatory requirements that apply to any other

15

bank holding company in operation.

16

As long as

MCorp also -- attempts to find an exception to

Section 1818(i) in the jurisdictional provisions of the

18

Bankruptcy Code, as set forth at 28 U.S.C. 1334.

proceedings.

5

Second, Congress has specified exactly what civil

proceeding is available for challenging the Board's order.

7

And as I have explained, that is the petition for judicial

8

review under Section 1818(h).

9

QUESTION:

10

But that

As an initial

Section 1334(b) does not speak to those.

Excuse me.

What we have here

immediately is an administrative proceeding, right?

11

MR. MINEAR:

12

QUESTION:

That is correct.
But the attempt to review the

13

propriety of that administrative proceeding is a civil

14

proceeding.

15

MR. MINEAR:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

That is correct as well.
So you are within 1334(b).

It is a

civil proceeding related to a case under Title XI.
MR. MINEAR:

But what is the civil proceeding,

19

Justice Scalia?

That is the civil proceeding that

20

Congress has provided in section 1818(h), which is a

21

petition for judicial review of a final order.

that is one of the principal criticisms of Leedom, that

Thus, it's quite reasonable for the Fed to treat

a bank holding company's refusal to aid its subsidiary
banks as an -- or to treat it as an unsafe or unsound
practice in the facts of this case.
The lower court's injunction has prevented the
Board from conducting an evidentiary hearing, and we think
the better course here is to reject the lower court's
Leedom analysis and allow the administrative proceeding to
go forward.

But if the Court decides to reach the source-

of-strength issue, it should decide it in the Board's
favor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF MCORP, ET AL.
MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This morning the Government has asked the Court,
to overlook the fact that by statute Congress made
available to bank holding companies the ability to take
advantage of Title XI of the United States Code, that is
to say, the Bankruptcy Code.

And instead, based upon a

congressional source that the Board is unable to identify,

1

the Board has suggested that the entire Chapter 11,

2

proceeding under Title XI may be eviscerated by the

3

removal of all of the assets of the holding company from

4

the holding company to the banks while it is in Chapter 11

5

to leave the holding company creditors of more than half a

6

billion dollars high and dry.

QUESTION:

8

Well, Mr. Miller, the completion of

the administrative hearing here without any enforcement
beyond that won't remove any property from the holding

10

company, will it?
MR. MILLER:

11

It will not.

However, it is our

12

position that the orders issued by the Board in the fall

13

of 1 88, and particularly the third cease-and-desist

14

order, which is at pages 84 and 85 of the joint appendix,

15

go way beyond anything that the Government has represented

today.

That just isn't happening

The Board -- the Board took the

position that the temporary order requiring the down­

MCorp went into the district court in the Chapter 11 case

inapplicable.

4

where are you with regard to enforcement of the temporary

order that says go ahead and pay all your assets over.

6

Now suppose that's the situation, then

MR. MILLER:

Then, Justice, it seems to me that

7

we must examine whether or not this order to put all the

8

assets from the holding company into the banks has any --

9

valid statutory source.

Otherwise, there is never an

10

opportunity to review that before the entire holding

11

company assets are eviscerated, the Chapter 11 is over,

12

and the banks effectively have collapsed with the 400 or

13

whatever million dollars have been placed in them.

14

cannot be that the Court has no power to examine whether

15

or not the underlying basis for the Government's assertion

2

MCorp could continue to pay debts previously contracted

exceptions to dissipation -- but it couldn't contract for

since the 1334(d) was enacted in 1984, it well succeeded

the enactment of 1818 (i).

QUESTION:

And obviously,

MR. MILLER:

Yes, we did.

I believe that the

record will reflect we asked for two things.

We asked for

10

a declaratory judgment that the automatic stay applied,

11

and we asked for a Section 105 stay, which is the

12

bankruptcy equivalent of the All Ritz Act against

13

prosecution.

14

with regard to the -- any act to control assets of the

are no exemptions to that in Section 362(b), none

22

authority granted under Section 105(a).

QUESTION:

2

Now let me just understand.

So

3

you're now -- you're saying that as of now, debts are

4

being paid and properties are being transferred quite

5

beyond the control or authority of the bankruptcy court to

6

stay.

7

MR. MILLER:

No, I'm not saying that at all.

8

What I'm saying is that, during the Chapter 11,

9

administrative expenses may be paid despite the temporary

10

order of the Board of Governors which would say that

11

without their consent you cannot pay salaries, you cannot

12

pay your lawyers to come to the United States Supreme

13

Court, you cannot pay anything without the control of the

14

Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas being exercised.

15

What we're saying is, yes, the exclusive

16

jurisdiction of Title XXVIII authorizes the court to

17

administer the Chapter 11 case and to administer the

18

assets during the Chapter 11 free from interference with

19

the control over those assets by the Board of Governors.

QUESTION:

But for that stay, or for the

And is the validity of that stay what

we're reviewing now?
MR. MILLER:

16

1

Leedom analysis of the court of appeals.

2

analysis is sound, but more importantly we think that

3

statutory framework in which the source-of-strength

4

charges were brought, and its counterpoint with the

5

bankruptcy require an examination by the bankruptcy court

6

of whether or not the proceeding may go forward.

7

reason for that is that there is an automatic stay under

8

Section(a)(1), and here we're now -- we're off the issue

9

of the temporary orders, and we're on to the main

w

We think the

And the

10

proceedings.

And (a)(1) prohibits any suit or proceeding,

11

including an administrative proceeding, that could have

12

been brought prior to a filing of a petition from going

13

forward.
Now, the Board relies upon the exemption in

14
15

Section 364 -- Section 362(b)(4), which says that a

16

governmental unit proceeding under Section(a)(1) to

17

enforce its police or regulatory power may, nevertheless,

18

despite Section(a)(1), go forward to the point of judgment

19

unless the judgment is a nonmonetary judgment.

20

under Section (b)(5) for injunctive relief, it may be

21

enforced.

22

And then

The issue then arises, it seems to us, for the

23

bankruptcy, or here, the Article III district court, to

24

determine whether this is a legitimate police or

25

regulatory power enforcement action.

Is there a police

there is not, then seemingly subsection(a)(1), the

MR. MILLER:

We believe that in a bankruptcy,

where the nature of the proceeding is one that is

13

calculated to lead to the removal of the assets of a

holding company, yes, that under those circumstances, the

MR. MILLER:

Correct.
Do you think that's what the statute

means?
MR. MILLER:

Well, I think that 1818(i), which

13

requires that you proceed either in the district court on

14

temporary orders or in the court of appeals on final

15

orders, is analogous to an exhaustion statute.

16

think there are two attacks to an exhaustion statute:

one, a constitutional collateral attack, and the other,

the question of whether the agency is proceeding in

And there is nothing in this statute that

Nor is there, we submit, in any other

legislation, such a power.

Indeed, in the thirties, in

11

the 1930's, the Congress of the United States eliminated

12

the shareholder assessment capability in a serious of four

13

amendments in 1933, I believe 5, and then later stretching

14

into the 1950's, despite testimony during those hearings,

15

which is cited in our brief, that by the Comptroller of

the Currency, that this was a valuable tool in allowing

the regulatory authorities to work with the stockholders

and management of then-troubled and failing banks.

abilities.

the Board, nevertheless, seeks to enforce the source-of -

statutory term of unsafe and unsound, which we think could

25

be interpreted to mean anything.
