Mr. Greenwsld.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. SETH GREENWALD, ESQ.»
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GREENWALD;

Mr. Chief Justic®, and may it please

the Court;
This is an appeal from a judgment or an order of a
three-judge district court in. the Southern District of New
York, which declared unconstitutional seven sections of New
York’s judiciary law.

They were

declared unconstitutional

as — on th© basis that they vers unconstitutional on their
face.

In other words » basically that every word in them was

unconstitutional.

And the b<asis of this declaration was that

they were in violation of the due process rights of the
appellees, the plaintiffs below.
The statute» or sections of the statute in questi.on,
form part of Article 19 of this law, which provide a process
and framework for punishing contempts of court.

In this case,

those that are denominated or processed for punishing civil
contempts.

However, it should be, I think, pointed out that this
process applies to all disobedience or disregard of court
orders, and while this case is said to com® up in th© context.

4
of disregard of a subpoena and supplementary proceedings» to
disclose assets after a judgment

is obtained* it would also

apply , feh© order of declaration of unco^stitutionality , to
people who violate injunctions in the State court, support
orders for where husband or wives are to support their spouses,
and the like.
QUESTION % Well, are you saying that the district
court didn’t merely strike it down in its applicatiori as to
these particular plaintiffs, but simply said that th© State of
New York couldn’t enforce it at all?
MR. GREENWALD:

I say yes, that — and that was the

effect that the State of New York could not enforce or punish
contempts of court, period.

And it did — I say that because

it declared these seven sections of 'the law unconstitutional
on their face, and it also declared this to be a class action,
and th© plaintiffs were all people who had ever bean subject to
civil contempt in the State of New York.

And I think it’s

rather clear from th© order that it applied to people who had
been and who ar© currently subject to be.
So it had an aII*»pervasive effect.

And, as I say,

it basically and totally enjoined this process, which is
fundamental to th© operation of any court, State or federal.
Now, as to what are called the facts of this case,
the district court recited what it called the typical case of
Harry Vail.

I wish to emphasize that this was based on simply

5
allegations in a complaint.

Because there was no ferial her©»

Indeed# if you look at the record,, -there is not even an
affidavit from Harry Vail as to the facts of his ease.
QUESTION5 Did th© Stata file an answer?
MR. GREENW&LDs Th© Sfcafc© in this case, or the
appellants # State court judges# were at the time of th® hearing
befor© th© three-judge court# moving to dismiss.

In effect#

they never got a chance to file an answer# and I would submit
that when th© plaintiffs are simply moving for a preliminary
injunction# obviously# according to the federal rules# there
is no requirement that we file an answer; and after th© grant
of what was called — it first# by th,® way# was a final order#
and then they# th© district court revised it to call it a
partial summary judgment; but# basically# of course# the
partial summary judgment was an injunction and# in effect#
the grant of final relief.
4

And

certainly it was final in so fax* as the appellants

here# State court judges.
QUESTION;

But they did# on page 20 it seems they

*

did try to limit it. They granted a declaratory judgment# but
said it was only enjoined against being used against the
members of the class.
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION;
to cut hs-ck a little?

Well# but what I wish to emphasise —

Could I interpret that as they were trying

6
Not that they w@.r® successful*
MR. GREENWALD:

[laughing]

I think the district

court realized, because we had a hearing after the first order
cante down, after the decision cams down, which was in the form
of an. order, and I pointed out to the district court that, their
order was so all-pervasive and all-encompassing that it would
wreck havoc with the process of State courts adjudicating
civil contempt in the State of New York.
And I can confidently say that that was the situa­
tion.

Judges and lawyers in the Stats were in such a state

of confusion that nothing could be don©.
Now, in answer to your question, I think the point
was that the district court may have thought it was perhaps
cutting back or being a little more judicious in its order,
but the practical effect was still that there was no way in
tii© State of New York to issue, ©v©n issue process in order
to show cause*
QUESTION:

Because they held it unconstitutional

on its face.
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And —

On their face.

I guess they meant on

theix' face.
MR. GREENWALD:

And when you excise seven sections

of our Judicairy Law, which provides for the issuance of
process, which provide for the hearing, which provide for fch©

7
punishment, you ar® left with nothing. And it was painted out,
I think, by the Sheriff of the City of New York, unless there
is a statute, you cannot ultimately punish someone for
contempt by commitment in the Stats of New York -unless there
is some statute in existence.
Now, getting back to tha case of Harry Vail, I also
wish to emphasize, and this involves all the appellees, that
this involves one county of the State of New'York, what
seems to b® the practice, or the procedure in Dutchess County.
I think ray briefs and the cases I eit© show that it is not
uniformly or the rule throughout th© State of Now York, as
to how courts proceed in the adjudications of civil contempts»
And ~~
QUESTION;

If a witness does not appear in response

to a subpoena in an ordinary lawsuit under -the New York Cod©,
is th© procedure much like this, that is, to issue an order
to show cause to teat witness why he should not be punished
for contempt?
MR. GREENW&LD:

I would say teat it is basically th©

same, teat th© disobedience of a subpoena is punishable as a
contempIt of court»

And, indeed, th© subpoena hers end pretty

mute any subpoena that's issued states on its face that
disregard of th® subpoena is punishable as a contempt of
court.
QUESTION; That’s true of any subpoena.

8
MR. GREENWALDs
QUESTIONS

Right.

— requiring any witness to show up any-

where? isn’t it?
MR. GREENWALDs
remedy of

Yes.

I mean that is the ultimate

the court to enforce the subpoena.

There has to be

some method of enforcement.
QUESTION;

Isn’t that true even without th© statute?

MR. GREENWALDs

I —■ ih@r© has been soma discussion

as to th© inherent power of a court to punish a —
QUESTION? Right.
MR. GREENWALDs
QUESTION;

— civil contempt.

Well; that’s wnat "sub-poena* means as a

matter of language; it means shot'? up under penalty of what
will happen to you if you don’t show up.
MR. GREENWALDs

Yes,

But 1 submit that in the

context of New York’s procedure and judiciary law, which
sets for a process for the punishment or citing someone for
civil contempt# and then a hearing and then an adjudication
of contempt, that fully satisfies due process.
New, Mr. Vail and the other appellees complained of
being found in civil contempt, mid that after being found in
civil contempt they were fined, for teat civil contempt, and
after they failed to pay that fine, they were, or he was —
not all ©f th© appellees were — committed for nonpayment of
that fin©.

9

Actually I -would point out that in Mr. Vail’s cas©
it happened to be one day# and, in fact? all of the appellees
who say they were committed? it was a very short period.
QUESTION;
correctly.

Let me so® if I understand this sequene®

That first he received a notice in the form of a

subpoena that required him to appear for the usual postjudgment inquiry of a judgment debtor? is that correct?
MR. GREENWALD;

As t© his assets.

QUESTION; And h© did not respond to that.
MR. GREENWALD;

He did not respond to that? that

is? to --

QUESTION;

Then the court? when he did not appear?

the court issued an order to shot*? cause? directing him to
appear to shew cause why h® should not be punished for
contempt? is that correct?
MR. GREENWALD;

That is right? on the application

or affidavit or affirmation of a judgment credit? his attorney
— he requested -«•
QUESTION; And h® failed to appear then?
MR. GREENWALD:

Y@s.

QUESTION; And when he did not appear then? then the
court issued an order imposing a fine? and that was the third
stage.
MR. GREENWALDs

That was the third stag®.

And this?

by the way. all these were? of course? personally served on the

10
judgment debtor, as far as the facts of this case, there is
no dispute about that, although you will see an affidavit of
someone claiming he got it. he got his subpoena in the mail.
2f that, be the case, then that is a complete defense to the
action, or the proceeding.
But certainly as to the class# all of this is
personally served.

And, as I say, that these are court

records.
QUESTIONt Bo I understand correctly that, the fine
of some $270, the so-called fine, was then — did not go into
tii© treasury of 'the court# but want to the judgment creditor
to apply on tine debt? is that correct?
MR. GREENWALD:

That is correct.

The fine, sine©

tills is denominated as civil contempt, goes to the party
instituting the proceeding# and in all these cases goes to the
reduction of the judgment.

I think in Mr. Vail’s case the

fining order required him to pay $10 a week.

So# -therefor®#

it wasn't something that had to be paid all at one a.
Now# I think the context of on© default after another
has to b© recognised.

When w© speak about due process# as to

this contempt proceeding, fchsr© is no dispute that, a very one
of those appellees got, notice, and# furthermore# received an
opportunity to be heard.
And if at any point the contemner, that's the judg­
ment debtor# had responded and informed the judgment creditor

il
in the proper manner,

or the court., of their indigency —

because these appellees claim they are indigent —* and
evidenced his lack of assets, the matter would be ended,
because that was the object of the subpoena’, to examine as to
assets.
So, once again, I would state ‘that, to Mr. Vail and
©very other appellee here, due process was accorded.
QUESTION:
on© thing in my mind.

Mr. Gr@an.wald, let me just clarify this
Had the

Vail, to take th© example,

responded to th® discovery proceeding and come in and testified
that he had no assets, under New York practice what would have
happened then?
MR. GHEENW&LD: That’s th® and of it.

He’s responded

to th© subpoena -~
QUESTION: Do they vacate th© judgment then?

Th®

default judgment.
MR. GREENWM.D:

No, th© judgment is not vacated,

but, the point is that the purpose of th® subpoena was to
examine this judgment debtor to sea whether he had any as safes
available to the satisfaction ©£ th© judgment.
only purpose of the subpoena.
QUESTION:

That was th®

To vacate --

If fch© examination discloses a kind of

borderline case, say, does the judge have fell© power at that
proceeding to enter som© kind of a payment order than th®
initial judgment?

12
MR* GREENWALD: .Absolutely not.

B a causes the point is

that the judgment debtor has responded to the subpoena»

He's

not in default.
The only way to vacate the judgment would be* of
course, either to make a motion to vacate the judgment or
declare bankruptcy , which than can wipe out the judgment.
But that's another process.
QUESTION:

Is there a judge there at the supple­

mental proceedings?
MS. GREENWALD:

The supplementary proceedings are

done on a subpoena issued by the attorney, and normally a
judge is not there.
QUESTIONS

There can — there ar® some processas -You s&y "there”, where is that, in a

courtroom?
MR. GREENWALD•

It can be in a courtroom, or, I

think, they oftentimes are returnable at the lawyer's office.
QUESTION: Right,
QUESTION:

Like a deposition.

MR. GREENWALD:

Like a deposition, right.

QUESTION: And how often can the judgment creditor
do this?

Let's say, the first time he comes in and the

judgment debtor says, "Sorry, I have no money, and I

have a

lot of debts and no assets", then can th® judgment creditor
try all over again th® following week?
Is there any limit on how many times or how frequently

13
h® can do it, in other words?

MR. GREENWALDs

I do not believe there is any limit,

but I would submit, of course, if this comes down to being
harassment, that obviously relief from the court can b©
obtained.

Indeed, I cite the case where — in ray reply brief,

a case called Oysterman^s Bank —* where the State court simply
enjoined any further supplementary proceedings, after being
informed, in an informal manner, just a letter, of the fact
that the judgment debtor was on public assistance,
I also wish to emphasise, and having stated what is
called the facts, that if this type of matter, this type of
adjudication of civil contempt is to b© reviewed, I submit
that tills court should do it on what is a full record, namely,
where it has con® up

through the State courts, where the

matter has bean fully litigated and the facts found.
And this is why I contend that th© district court
should have abstained.

In other words, it should have

considered the applicable principles of federalism, comity, and
equity, which apply to any federal court, when I see it in
effect reviewing State court decisions.
QUESTIONt

You mean abstention in the sense that

Younger and Huffman, and not in th© sens© of letting the State
court decide a question of Stata law?

MR. GREENWALD; Well, I am now speaking in th© sens©
of the Ypungar-Huffman abstention.

However, I will say that

14

1 think it’s not completely clear# or 1 think that the
abstention to obtain a ruling of the State court as to
procedures might h@ efficacious in this case # too.

Because

you are dealing here with a statute that basically has not
been construed by tits® Stafea court.
QUESTIOHt well# at the time# what was the precise
status of the Sfeat© proceedings when th® injunction was
entered?
MR. GREEMWMjD: Well# if w© speak about ~
QUESTIOH;

There had been a holding of-contempt#

or had been an adjudication of contempt?
MR. GREENWALD:
the whole thing was over.

In th® case of Mr. Vail# apparently
It was almost like -» and that

gets to res judicata ~«QUESTION t What do you mean it was over?
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

Y@s.

MR. GREENWALDs
QUESTION s

— h® had bean fined.

Yes.

MR. GREENWALDs
and he had paid the fine.
QUESTION:

He had been found in contempt# ~~

A commitment order had b@®n issued#
So the whole matter is over.

So he faced no confinement# of course.

MR. GREENWALD:

Yes.

I mean# certainly Mr. Vail's

case would not warrant an injunction# I think I could say.
QUESTION:

Yes.

15
MR* GREENWALDs

However, if there was any complaint

about that, then if it's —
QUESTION: Well, the injuncfcicn probably didn't affect;
his case in any way.
MR* GREENWALDs
did affect his case.

1 couldn't think it really — it

However, I canft rely on the fact that

Mr, Vail not having a case for an injunction, because there
war® other appellees, in fact l think there were eight or
nine in number, and they came into federal court after they
had been adjudicating contempt, had been served wife the
finding order, and requested a temporary restraining order
from fe© federal court and obtained same.
And I wish to emphasise, by feh® way, that I did not
oppose any restraint on

I mean, oppose fees© res training

orders, but 1 —
QUESTIONS Did you ask for abstention in fee lower
court?
MR, GREBNWALD:

I certainly did.

And I think it's

rather obvious, because thero’s some discussion of it in the
district court opinion,
I also, though, as to fee people who had been
already found in contempt, I had put in our

motion to dismiss,

and that's all we had in fe® district court,

He can be

In other words, fines

You have th© possibility of all types

of legal action which would be quit© disruptive of the whole
past contempt process.
QUESTION;

It said that th© contempt here has been

satisfied by the payment of the fine which has been applied
on the debt.
MR. GREENWALD;
QUESTION;

That’s —

So that you regard that as res judicata?

MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes.

In th© case of Harry Vail.

Now, suppos©, at -this point, the judgment

I?
creditor served a notice in the usual way for an additional
post-judgment inquiry into assets, reciting in that application
that they were informed and believed, under oath, that the
judgment debtor had inherited real estate and personal
property in the value of at least $15,000.
At the present time, could they proceed, given the
judgment of the three-judge court, could they require him to
appear and submit to examination, and, if he failed, could a
State court judge ultimately find him in contempt?
MR. GREENWALDs Well, I would put it this ways

They

still can, of course, serve a subpoena in supplementary
proceedings.

The careful lawyer would be well-advised to put

on that subpoena, as the form — the form company which
publishes this type of form, in New York it!s generally a form,
what we call the Blumberg forms -- would have on it, "failure
to reply to this subpoena not only will subject you to
punishment for contempt but may result in your fin© or
imprisonment".
But. at this point, after this, after to© disregard
of this subpoena, if toe attorney would seek to, you know,
obtain the order to show cause to punish for contempt under
section 757, the procedure provided for, he could not do so,
because under the judgment of the court below it doesn't
exist any more? it’s been declared unconstitutional, it’s
been enjoined, it can’t be used.

18
And — yes?
QUESTION:

Go ahead.
Can I ask you a question, Mr. Gresnwald?

As here, so often, when a man goes to jail, all of a sudden
the fine is paid.
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

Yes, it*s very curious.

Well, it's possible, is it not, for the

payment to be mad© out of exempt property?
MR. GREENWALD:
the payment.

It might very well ba possible for

But I wish to point out, and in my reply brief

I cite the c&s© of Brown v. Liberty Loan Corporation, where the
Fifth Circuit reversed the lower district court and held that
it was not necessary to give notice of fch© fact that you hav©
exemptions.

That due process does not require that.

Basically, due process doesn't require or doesn't
legislate this type of notice.

And

QUESTION: Well, what I wanted to ask, do you have any
procedure in New York whereby a return of payment made out of
exempt property can b© effectuated?
MR. GREENWALD:

I do not know of .any procedure. The

point I would make is that if a person has exempt property
and chooses to satisfy his just debts, and let us recognise©
the fact that there's a judgment involved, that should not be
condemned.

He has an. exemption, h® can rely on that exemption.
But if h© has available money and chooses to pay this

debt, which has been reduced to judgment, I don't see where any

19

constitutional objection can be made.
Now, as X wish to emphasize, the federal court here
essentially took a State court record and than, proceeded to
review it, as if it was a State appellate court,

And X submit;

that it does not hav© that power, and under the principles of
Huffman v. Pursus, that abstention is entirely proper in this
case.
QUESTIONS
General Graenwalds

Let in® ask this, in that connection.
How long have these laws been on the

books in New York State?
MR. GREENWALD:

The Judiciary Law was passed about

the turn of the Century, I think it was enacted about 1906
or 1907.
QUESTION:

And you said earlier that 'they have

never been construed by the New York courts?

I have difficulty

following that.
MR. GREENWALD:

1 don't -— I say they have not been

And I also point out that as to the supplementary

proceedings or th© subpoena, this type of subpoena, I believe
the contempt process only became applicable in 1963 as a

—- in a section, said that disregard of the subpoena is

MR. GREENWALD:

Yes, cerfcainly — yes, they are

used ©very day.
QUESTION:

Aren’t these statutes — isn’t this

statutory pattern similar to that in a great many of the
States?
MR. GREENWALD:

Yes, it certainly is.

What is the statutory

QUESTION:

No# I understand.

Just let me get my

problem out before you.
The attorney’s notice# then# is not preceded by any

MR* GREENWALD:

No. The attorney issues the subpoena

MR. GREENWALD:

a time limit, basically.

Now, the rule to show cause why the debtor

emphasize, th© contempt of court is not th® failur® to pay th®
judgment.

It
QUESTIONs

But do you know of any other State pro-

c®dures which provide contempt of court for th® failure to
respond to a notice of that kind, which is not preceded ■ by
any court order?
MR. GREENWALD: Well, —
QUESTIONs

Well, is not fell© subpoena itself a court

order?
c

MR. GREENWALD s

Th© subpoena is deemed to be a court

order, because the attorney in this case is acting as an
officer of the court, as b.® does in many States.

I think in

soma Statas lie can issue, say, a number of types of process
as .an officer of th© court.

23

But what I wish to emphasize is —
QUESTION;

But it's different from the federal

system, for example?
MR» GREENWALD;

Yes, of course»

Right in the federal

system, like, I think, a marshal has to serve th® summons and
complaint; in the State court, anybody can.
But what I —
QUESTION;

There are notices ©f deposition in the

federal system teat are issued by lawyers.

Now, if you don*t

show up for a deposition, certainly court proceedings can
ensue against you.
MR» GREENWALDs
QUESTION;

That's right.

It's a violation of the court order that

then gives rise to th® contempt, rather than the failure to
show in th© first instance.
MR. GREENWALD; Well, but the point is that due

and this is what I wish to emphasize, due process

requires notice and an opportunity to be heard.

Th© order to

show cause here, as is recognised in th© district court
opinion, gives teat notice and then gives the opportunity to
be heard in court.

Basically, the enforcement of this

subpoena is a totally judicial process, and —

Well, he —

If h© didn't give a good excuse, could

MR. GREENWALB;

Y@s, he could hold him in contempt,

and of course that holding -QUESTION:

For not complying with the original

subposna?
MR. GREENWALB;

Yes, he could.

And of course that

holding ©f contempt could foe reviewed on appeal.

25
I’m not h&x® saying that: my clients, the State
court judges, made the correct decisione

Because the correct*»

ness of their decision is to be reviewed on appeal.

If the

person who is held in contempt objects to it.
But what I wish to emphasis© is, basic to this case
is the claim of indigency of these — the appellees claim
they are indigent.

And if any judgment debtor comes into

court in response to this order to show cause and says, 6’I have
no money, I am indigent”, and of course than the judge would
examine them a little further, yon know, about that, indigency.
As a matter of law, h© would not be found in contempt.
And, indeed, —
QUESTION; Why not?

If h© didn’t show up for the

lawyer’s subpoena?
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

Because

Indigency is no defense to failure to

respond to process, is it?
MR. GREENWALD:

But I do wish to emphasis© that the

cases, the few cashes -»*- and they are nicely prized in the Stats
of New York -- indicate that if, at the show-cause hearing
•iS*

the judgment debtor shows that he is indigent, that he cannot,
you know, that he. in effect

that h© cannot pay the

judgment, that’s the and of the matter.

He's not held in

contempt.
QUESTION;

Even if the lawyer had tried on 35

26

occasions to get him to respond to a subpoena at his office ,
and h© just refused to con® in, said, "I'm not going to any
lawyer’s office at all, you can’t make me”, couldn’t the judge
hold him in contempt for that even if h© was indigent?
MR* GREENWALDt

It’s conceivable, but what I wish

to emphasis© is that —QUESTIONs

Because indigency is not a complete

defense.
MR. GREEMWALDs

But I wish to emphasize that since

the ultimate penalty her© is a fine, and if the person cannot
pay the fin®, h© cannot be committed, then that’s the end
of the subpoena.

And that is basically what happens in New

York, in the New York courts.
The problem in this c&s© is not the lack of any due
process, it’s the complete disregard of judicial process by
the appellees.

And if there is any error in the action of the

appellants, the Stata court judges, that was to be reviewed
on appeal by the State courts, with an appeal to this Court,
if the condemner so chose.
The point is you have

really

* have no record

here, and these statutes do provide due process.

Is fch® subpoena that was issued in the

The issue in this case is th© State

court procedures and decisions, and that’s where I think

I say, th© requirement of an actual hearing

MISS BLOOM;

Mr. Chief Justic®, and may it pleas©

There are two essential issues in this case.

Whether these ~

it for du© process purposes, a different kind of an officer

29

of the court from a .lawyer who is admitted to the bar, under
New York law?
MISS BLOOM;
QUESTION;

Yes,

Yes, he is,

Hasn't the New York statute delegated to

a lawyer, who is attorney of record in a particular case, the
*

authority fcc issue that subpoena?
MISS BLOOM;

Yes, and I don’t quite his authority tc

issue it, and I don’t question th® fact that the debtors in
this case disobeyed the subpoenas.
Th© question is, whether or not debtors may be
jailed for up to ninety days for disobeying the subpoena without
ever appearing before a judge and without ever being advised of
their right to counsel or assigned counsel if indigent.
QUESTION;

Wall, that about proves it.

He had an

opportunity to appear before a judge.
MISS BLOOM;

That’s correct.

They did have, an

Is there any more — anything necessary other than for
the judge to issue a show-caus© order and put him in jail?
MISS BLOOM;

No. But we have a different situation

there.
QUESTION;

Well* didn’t h© issue a show-cause order

here?
MISS BLOOM;

Yes* he did.

What I’d like to do is to clarify enactly what
happened when that show-cause order was issued.

And I would

like to clarify th© statutory procedure by outlining how the
statutes operated with respect to Patrick Ward.

I would

maintain that everything that happened to Patrick Ward was
permitted under th© statutes.
QUESTION;

Th© creditor’s attorneys never

31

A default judgment was taken against Patrick Ward Ik,
city court in the City of Poughkeepsie for nonpayment of a
$125 medical hill.

The creditor’s attorney -than issued a

subpoena ordering Ward to appear for a disclosure daposifelon
at the courthouse.
The courthouse was designated as the location,, not
because a judge was involved in these proceedings, but because
that was the requested location.
Ward appeared as instructed.

When the attorney did

not appear, a clerk instructed Ward to go to the attorney’s
office.

Ward went to the office, and told the attorney that

he would produce the information at the courthouse, but not at
the attorney’s office.

He ©asantially did not understand the

purpose or meaning of the subpoena.
Based upon Ward’s refusal to provide this information,
the creditor's attorney instituted civil contempt proceedings
to enforce compliance with the subpoena.

He served Ward with

a notice of motion to hold him in contempt.
Wow, under 75? of the Judiciary Law, the proceedings
may b© commenced by a show-cause order or a warrant of
commitment — warrant of attachment, or by the creditor’s
attorney issuing a notice of motion.
If we examine toe show-cause order, which appears at
page 12 of my brief and in 757, the order does not inform the
debtor that failure to appear may result in incarceration or

32

a fin©.

It informs him at this point that failure to appear

may rasn.lt in a finding of contempt.
When Ward received the notice of this hearing, he
contacted the creditor’s attorney and arranged to satisfy
the judgment by paying tan dollars a weak to the attorney.
He did not g© to the court hearing.

He was again under the

misimpression that he didn't have to.
Three weeks later, Ward was laid off from his job
and told the creditor’s attorney that, he would not be able to
continue making payments.
Three months later, Ward was served with a contempt
order.

He was held in contempt for his failure: to obey the

subpoena, not his *—
QUESTIONS

You say a contempt order at that point.

This is not an order to show cause, but an -MISS BLOQMs

him to do, isn't it?

that h© got further notice to go to to© attorney's office is

QUESTION:

You mean they adjourned the hearing or

MISS BLOOM:

That’s correct.

And under New York

procedure —
QUESTION:

Under New York law it would foa the same

as though they adjourned it from the third floor of the
courthouse to the fifth floor?
MISS BLOOM:
QUESTION;

Exactly.
Where does appeal lie from the county

court of the appellant here# the appellate division?
MISS BLOOM:

The appellat® term.

QUESTION: Well# are you saying that it's inconceivable
that the appellate term, if your client had appealed that
citation, would not hav© found soma violation of toe State
law and cite him under those circumstances?
MISS BLOOM:

I am not suggesting that.

I am

suggesting, as w® will see as toes© procedures follow, tost
individuals may be incarcerated who are on public assistance,
©r have other forms of exempt incoma, before they realise
that ~~ before they have an opportunity to appeal. And that
they suffer this kind of injury before they are aware of
appellate procedures

35

Secondly, sine© they do not have an attorney , they
may not know that they have these defenses, and they may not
use the procedures as they might otherwise.
QUESTION

%

Well, doesn't the appellate term have

authority to grant a stay if it felt that the man was being
incarcerated by the county court wrongly?
MISS BLOOM:

Yes, they do.

Yes, they do.

Let me just respond to that and clarify what I've
just said.
The procedure that Patrick Ward would have had to
us© fco stop the proceedings against him, after -the contempt
order was issued, was to make a motion to vacate the contempt
order.

H® would have gone back before 'the county court judge

that issued the initial contempt order, and he could have
gotten a stay at that point.
QUESTION: Well, don’t you think that the New York
courts could have given you relief without striking down the
whole batch of statutes?
MISS BLOOM: They might have, and that —
QUESTION:

And don't you think they would have?

MISS BLOOM: They certainly might have.

And th@y —

and we don’t —
QUESTION:

But by this action everybody is — there’s

no more contempt in New York.
MISS BLOOM; Well, the court still has an inherent

36

contempt power.- and the only thing that they can’t do is to
incarcerate individuals.
QUESTION:

They can clearly fine 'them.

Well, is contempt without th® power of

incarceration any good?
MISS BLOOM:

I don't question that these New York
«

courts —
QUESTION: Do you think that all of these statutes
®r© unconstitutional on their face?
MISS BLOOM:

Yes, I do.

I think that statutes that put —
QUESTION:
MISS BLOOM:

All of them?
Th© statutes that ware declared

unconstitutional, yes.
QUESTION:

You wouldn't settle for them being

unconstitutional as applied to your class?
MISS BLOOM:

If you want to declara them unconstitu­

tional as applied, that would satisfy our interest.
I feel that whenever individuals are incarcerated
without an attorney ana without ever appearing before a judge,
there is such, a high risk that —
QUESTION:

Well, mv case is that this man was

subpoenaed by th© judge to appear from him, and h© never
showed up: and fch© judge issued a bench warrant and had him
brought in.

That's as legal as anything I know of,

I misunderstood your

If the individual is — if the judge issues a bench

No, he issued a subpoena*

And the man

ignored the subpoena, without ever seeing a judge, he ignored
it? and, without seeing a judge, the judge issued a bench

day.

And there's nothing I know of illegal about it.

You get

your hearing then, yes, you get a show-cause hearing.
But th© bench warrant, they will pick you up wherever
you are,
MISS BLOOM; There are two different situations in this

38

case t though»
First of all? as the proceedings indicate# the
individual was never held in contempt for wilfully disobeying
a court order.

There was never any finding that tee individual

wilfully failed to appear at the show-cause hearing, or
wilfully failed to pay the fine.

Tha statutes indicata that

an individual can be incarcerated if he neglects or refuses
to pay tha fin®.
QUESTION; But that’s a different case

from th© one

hare, that th® court wrote on. They didn’t say anything — as
I understand, on page 2a, they say just th® opposite, don’t;
they?
MISS BLOOM:

No.

If w© look at the statutes —

In your recital of Mr. Ward’s

tribulations, you mentioned the fact that ho was! subject to a

What is -the procedure in New York if he had

ignored that in the same
MISS BLOOMs

way that h@ ignored the other order?

If he had ignored a support order, and

the support order was issued by a Hew York Family Court judge,
he would have had ~~ end if he did not appear at an initial
show-eaus© hearing, fch@ court would physically bring him before
th© Family Court, and ask him —
QUESTION;
MISS BLOOMs

How is that accomplished?
They issue what’s called a writ of

attachment, and th© Sheriff goes out, picks up th© person, and

44
brings him before the court..

And a hearing would hav© been

held at that. time,, feo determine why h© didn’t pay the support

order.
He also would have b@©n provided

with — he would

have been informed of his right to counselt and he would have
been informed that he had a right to assigned counsel if h®
was indigent.
QUESTION;

Is that same procedure followed in a

divorce case# where alimony is ordered?
MISS BLOOM;

It’s followed only in support actions

in Family Court. The irony of feh© situation is that a creditor
or an attorney in feh© support and alimony situation has the
option c£ eighfeer using th© Family Court procedures „ which
provide the procedural safeguards that we’re asking for here,
or the procedures in the Judiciary Law, which provide non©
of those procedural safeguards.
QUESTION: But if tli© divorce is in an ordinary court
not the Family Court, what are th® procedures with respect to
alimony?
MISS BLOOM;

Well, the procedures will h© those

found in th© Judicary Law, in th® challenged sections of the
civil contempt statutes.

So feh® judgment in this cas© would

invalidate that procedure a® well as with respect to creditors

in the lower court did not answer or respond to his affidavit.
QUESTION; Well, was there any idling wrong with th® —
would there have been any shortcomings in any possible State
remedies, or adjudications with respect to your constitutional
issues?
In short, could you have raised them in the State
court and had them adjudicated?
MISS BLOOM;

W© could have raised these constitutional

issues in the State court. We felt

with respect to Patrick

With respect to individua3.s such as Harry Vail, we

could have appealed on his behalf.

Th© problem in his case,

■though, is that we maintain that he suffered too much injury
by the time he got to toe appellate level. , He was incarcerated
and his entire income was exempt from execution.
He could have appealed to get that money back.

There

would be no way —»
QUESTION;

At some point in that process, if he had

48

got ahold of a lawyer earlier, he could have raised all the
quesfelons he wanted to in the State court.
MISS BLOOMs

If he had gotten — if he had had

counsel, he could have; that's correct.
QUESTION:

Or if h© had known enough himself.

Now, you seem to treat this — these proceedings a
lot like a criminal case, in terms of what procedures might
b® required, presence and counsel# and things like that# and
yet you say it shouldn't b@ treated as a criminal case# even
a quasi-criminal cas© for purposes of Younger abstention.
MISS BLOOM2

That’s correct,

I am treating them not as a criminal case for the
due process protections that. I believe are required her©#
but a case in which an individual is deprived of liberty.
And that can occur in many civil contexts# it can occur in
civil commitment context# and others? and I believe that for
due process reasons# that, an individual must be assigned a
lawyer and must appear before a judge before that individual
can be incarcerated# for -QUESTION s

QUESTION? But it —- when, you’re talking about
vindicating the authority of the court» of a State court»
you’re pretty close to the core of the State interest in its
judicial processes» aren't you?
It’s not just enjoining some case.

This is keeping

a court, from -- keeping a court from protecting its own
authority.
MISS BLOOM;

Well, what happened her® ~~ first of

statutes,

I don’t blame you.
MISS BLOOM;

The statutes say feat.

The statutes

They play no part in criminal law enforcement.
QUESTION;

Well» Huffman v. Pursue wasn’t strictly a

crimina»! case, was it?
MISS BLOOM;

No» it wasn’t, but the statutes in

that case were used in aid. of criminal statutes, and fch©
essential difference is that fee proceedings were initiated

by the State.
In this case we have private individuals initiating
proceedings, and there is *•QUESTION;

Well, don't you think the State has just

as great an interest in seeing th© authority of its courts

I believe that tiiar© is an essential

I believe that we first have to look at what

is that individuals are held in contempt for.

it

They &r® not

being held in contempt as would be th® case in a criminal
contempt proceeding, for wilfully disobeying a court order.
They ar® being held in contempt for wilfully disobeying a
subpoena issued by a creditor's attorney.
There is a —
QUESTION:

Yes, but th© defendant cannot

be held

in contempt until he further disregards the show-cause order.
It may b© h© will be h®ld in contempt even if h© comes to
court in response to that show-cause order, but he cannot be
held in contempt without disobeying that order.

I mean# h© —

at least he cannot be held in contempt without that order
having been issued by the judge.
MISS BLOOM:

Correct.

Correct.

However, the order,

the ultimate contempt order holds an individual in contempt,
not. for intentionally disobeying that court order.
The standard is on© of neglect or refusal.

If an

individual breaks a leg on his way to th® courthouse, and
doesn’t appear for the show-cause hearing, he has neglected to
obey that court order, and if h© intentionally disobeyed th©

51
subpoena, a contempt order ‘could properly issue.
Going back to Mr. Justice
QUESTIONs

I don't know the purpose of that illustra

tion, but if ha, at some point, showed a court that he broke
his leg on the way, you don’t suggest that any court would
hold him in contempt for not appearing?
MISS BLOOM;

Ha could be held in contempt in his

absence, that is my point. And because he has been held —
QUESTIONs

But don’t you think that would be

corrected as soon as it was shown that he broke his leg?
On the way to th® courthouse.
MISS BLOOM;

Correct.

However, my point is that

that may not happen until the individual has sat in jail for
ninety days.
QUESTION: But getting back to my brother Rehnquist's
original question, isn’t it strange that in a private case
involving money, et cetera, ©t cetera, et cetera, it’s
necessary to knock down seven State statutes in order to give
relief -bo eight people?
Do you know of any case like that?
MISS BLOOM; Well, this is a statutory scheme.

There

could be up to 15 statutes, the number wouldn’t make any
difference
QUESTION:

I mean, what difference do these people

have, other than their own rights?

They don't have any rights

Do

they?
MISS BLOOMs

Well, they ar© representative of a

class of individuals who are subjected

to these statutes,

sir.
QUESTIONS

Which is a very simple — and all they

need is relief for that class.
MISS BLOOMS
QUESTIONS

That's correct.
And they don't need to ~~ relief for

all of the other people, if other situations are governed by
the same statutes.
MISS BLOOM;

You are correct, *—

QUESTION2

So where does the interest come to this

Court that in order to protect these people we have to knock
down the whole works?
In order to do, quote, "justice to these people",

MISS BLOOMs

As I said earlier, these people's

interests would be satisfied if these statutes ware declared

QUESTION;

At. what point would you say the assign­

ment of counsel should take place?

MISS BLOOM;

I believe that the statutory procedure

could work as follows — and I will insert when counsel should

I shouldn't have said "what do you think";

what do you think the Constitution commands in this regard?
MISS BLOOM:

I believe that if the creditor is

making an application for contempt, that may involve incarcer­
ation, that counsel must be assigned when the individual is
physically brought before the court by a writ of attachment,
which I have described, and it appears that the individual is
going to disobey, further disobey the subpoena, and may face
incarceration.
QUESTION:

I don't suggest that

I'm suggesting that the assignment of

counsel, or the advising of an individual of his right to
assigned counsel, must occur when the writ of attachment
after the writ of attachment has issued, and the individual
is physically before th© judge.
QUESTION:

And he says, "I'm indigent'8? now he

doesn't really need a lawyer, because th© judge is going to

MISS BLOOM:

Well, unless th© creditor has further —

further need for information that he is seeking.
QUESTION:

It seems to me that th© need for counsel

MISS BLOOM:

Not necessarily,

to a civil contempt action.

And these are all complicated

That’s correct.

What kind of defense is that?

You don’t need any of these other

defenses?
MISS BLOOM;
QUESTION;

Not necessarily.
ted only by indigency do you become

eligible for the appointment of a lawyer.
MISS BLOOM:

You might net, which would show that

in many cases the appointment of a lawyer is not going to be
needed.

But it will also insure that the individual who does

not need the appointment of a lawyer is advised that h© has
the right to a lawyer.

Surely.
I'm interested in the effect of the

Assume for the moment that we affirm the decision of

the district court.

Th© order applies to all persons, without,

any limitation as to time, who have been subjected to this
procedure in the past, to go back to 1906, I supposa, if
anybody is still alive.
What remedy would they have, as a practical matter?
MISS BLOOM:

Well, I read the order differently.

I read the order in light of the opinion.

Th® opinion clearly

states that the court has enjoined further application of these
statutes, and 1 believe that very clearly means that it does
not have retroactive effect.
QUESTION:
MISS BLOOM:

That is not what the order says, is it?
No, it is not.

But I believe that it

can only logically be read in. light of th© decision.
