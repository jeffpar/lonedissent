ORAL ARGUMENT OF LILLIAN 2EXSEL COHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRS. COHEN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please) the Court:
The question presented by this case is ’whether a
state court criminal conviction should be set aside as funda­
mentally unfair because the trial judge did not explain the
issue of causation to th® jury.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit answered
this question in th© affirmative "on th® limited and singular
facts of this case.w

Th© court held that in this case the jury

may not have been aware that tbay had to decide th© issue of
causation and, alternatively, that if the jury was aware of
this element the Instruction was not detailed enough.
Petitioner belives that th© decision below is
erroneouss

First, because th© issue of causation was focused

for the jury throughout th© trial by the prosecution and by
both defense lawyers? second, because the record controverts
respondent's assumption that it would have been to his advantage
to have had a detailed instruction or th© issue of causation;
and, third, haems© the ultimata question that was decided by

4
the court below and upon which its decision rests, t© wife,
whether the jury instruction was adequate, was essentially a
question of state law and not a matter for habeas corpus
review.
)

Respondent and his co-defendant.were convicted of
the crime of murder in th

second degree under a section of

the New York penal law which provides that a person is guilty
of murder when under circumstances evincing a depraved indif­
ference to human life he recklessly engages in conduct which
creates a grave risk of death to another person and thereby
causes the death of another person,
A defendant is reckless under Haw York law whan h©
is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and un­
justifiable risk that a particular result will occur.
The facts in this case are essentially undisputed.
December 30, 1970, in th® evening, respondent Kibbe and his
co-defendant Roy Krall met a man named Georg© Stafford in a
bar in Rochester, Maw York.

At that point, Stafford had al­

ready been refused service in the bar because he had had so
much to drink.

Kibbe and Krall agreed to give Stafford a rid®

home whan Stafford indicated that hs was afraid to drive his
own car.

The defendants later admitted that they had already

formed th© intent to take the money which Stafford had been
flashing in the bar•
First, however, the three men went to two more bars,

5

one of which refused Stafford service again.

Kibbe and Krall

then drove Stafford to a rural area outsid® of Rochester.
They took his money.

According to the defendants, Stafford

lowered his trousers and took off his boots to stow then that
he had no more money.

Stafford's girlfriend testified at th©

trial, however, that in fact, because of an injury to his leg,
h© could not remove his right boot.
©£ underss is accounted for.

However, Stafford’s state

The fact is that h@ was left

essentially undressed at th® side of a two-lane, unlit road,
which was banked on both sides with snow.
How, th® record establishes that it was four degrees
outside, so Stafford was not wearing his jacket nor his boots.
Thase were handed to him by respondent Kibbe with th© advice
that Stafford get inside so that h© not frees© to death.
0

How, there is — oh, on© essential fact remains and
that is that at this point Kibbe and Krall drove off leaving
Stafford on the side of th® road, having fallen into the snow­
bank, and they took with them his eyeglasses.

Now, there is

no dispute —

he wouldn’t freeze to death.

They didn't —
QUESTION:

But. there wasn't any inside, was there?

MRS. COHEN:

Well, this is the point.

It is undis­

puted that there was an open gas station in the area.

Era11,

in the statement he later gave to the police, said that they
left Stafford 75 feet away from this gas station.

Th© prose­

cution introduced physical evidence to show that in fact
Stafford had been left a quarter mile away from the gas station.
QUESTION:

Th© gas station in any event was on th©

other side of the read?
MRS. COHEN:

That is th© critical point.

And not

only was it on th© other side of th© road, but Kibbe and Krall
both acknowledged that they knew this.

So when they told him

to get inside some place, and they knew that the gas station
was on the other side of th© road, they realized he had to
cross th© road.
Moreover, Krall acknowledged — at least Krall
acknowledged that there was in fact at that time on th® road
traffic going in both directions.
QUESTION:

Sine© I have interrupted you, I didn't

understand you, what you told us about falling into a snow­
bank.

QUESTIONS

What kind of a. road was this, a state two-

lane road.?
MRS. COHEN:
QUESTIONs
MRS. COHENs

I gather it is a county road.
In Monroe County?
Y@,s.

And the main feature from our

standpoint that is relevant is that it was a two-lane highway,
that

bare was no artificial lighting overhead.
QUESTIONs

But I was wondering how much traffic Idler©

wa.ff on it?
MRS. COHENs

Well, there is testimony'on traffic.

Although the respondent disputes the amount ©£ traffic, as I
say. Krai2••himself admitted that there war® cars going in both

8
directions afe the time that they abandon,ad Stafford.

At the

time of the accident, which took place half an hour later, at
least three cars converged on that point.

And as we point out

in the reply brief, the driver of the car which ultimately
struck Stafford indicated that passersby, as they came along
after the accident,- stopped to give him assistance.

So that

the*:© may not have been heavy rush-hour traffic which might
exist, you knew, in a major city —
QUESTION^

Hell, this wasn't the rush-hour, this was,

what, eight or nine o'clock at night?
MRS. COHEN:

This was 9:30 in the evening.

So that

•it may not have been the rush-hour but, on the other hand, it
wasn't in the early morning hours when veu would expect that
there would- b© very little traffic on the road.

But there is

affirmative evidence that cars were passing on the road and
there is the admission by lx all himself that ther© ware cars
going in both directions when they did abandon him at the side
of th© road.

I don't know the answer, I'm afraid, but

9
Half an hour later , after h© was abandoned, Stafford
was struck by a light pickup truck going ten miles over fcha
speed limit.

The accident, occurred one-quarter mil© away from

the gas station.

Stafford at -the time of th© accident was

sitting in the middle of the lane on th® same aid© of th©
highway as he had been abandoned.

Than it went to th© United States District

Judge on habeas corpus, so that is fch© fourth time around, and
h© said th© trial was fair and there, was no problem and pointed

10

out that no objection had been mad® at the trial on this issue?
MRS. COHEKs

Well, I think ultimately what is

critical is that he looked at the alleged error in this case
and he felt that it was not a substantial violation and that
he was simply being called upon to review jury instructions,
that that was not the province of habeas corpus review.
QUESTIONS

Only on the f if fell time it got into fch®

fifth court that the judgment at the -trial court was set
aside?
MRS. COHENs

Was set aside, and I might add with one

dissent, it was not a unanimous decision by the Second Circuit.
Now, from the beginning of this trial, the two
lawyers r©preseating Kibbe ana Krall attoapted to shift re­
sponsibility for what happened to the driver of -Hie truck,
Michael Blake.

They did this in several ways.

First, they cross-'examined Michael Blake extensively

X

about the circumstances under which he struck. Stafford.

They

cross-examined the medical examiner to show that there was no
chance that death was caused by anything except the impact from
-the -truck.

And they also argued this in summation and they

argued it vary graphically, 1 think very emotionally.

Krall's

attorney actually said to the jury that if anyone in this case
was depraved am if anyone in this case caused Stafford’s
death, it was Michael Blake, and interestingly the officials
have taken

bo

action against him for his wrongdoing.

1.1

At the same time they both pointedly disputed the
foreseeability of Stafford’s death, how they argued could
Kibbe and Kr&lX have foreseen when they left this man by the
aid® of th© road that along would com® this pickup truck
driving ten miles an hour over the speed limit and that the
driver would not swerve or brake.
QUESTIONS

as to the immediate cause of death# i.e. being struck by the
automobile —
MRS, COHEN:

No, that was firmly established»

It

or for injuries received anywhere else?
MRS. COHENs

Nothing extraneous, no.

It was clearly

established that it was the impact of the -truck and it was —
QUESTION:
MRS. COHENs

The sole and immediate cans© of death?
the sol® and immediate cans© of death.,

Mowe in short, as th® court below itself found, th©
issue of causation was constantly being placed before th® jury
by the defense.

And I might add, th© prosecutor responded in

kind, arguing that even though these defendants were net th©
\

sol® cause of death, wen though they were not the immediate
causa of death, nevertheless they war© responsible and they
war© th© approximat® cause of death.
Mow, notwithstanding the fact that th© theory of the

12
defens® was to deny that Kibbs and Krall had caused the death,
neither defense lawyer objected when th® trial judge did not
define the element of causation for the jury,

We believe

there are two —
QUESTION:

They didn’t raise it in the appellata

division, either?
MRS. COHENs

No, they did not.

And it was th© same

lawyer at least representing respondent Kibbe who represented
him on his direct appeal.

The issue was raised in the appellate

division by the dissenting judge, and it was answered by the
majority there who believed that he was not deprived of a fair
trial.
It was first explicitly raised in behalf of these two
defendants when the case got to the Court of Appeals,

So that

they did not take .an objection at the time of the charge mid,
as I indicated, we believe there ar© two possible explanations
for their decision.
The first is that, they were satisfied that the issue
of causation had been focused for the jury.

The second is

that they realised that under New York law an explicit charge
on causation would have effectively deprived them of the oppor­
tunity of arguing to the jury that it. was the negligence ©f
the driver that was to blame and in that; way attempting to sway
the jury away from the responsibility of 'Hi® defendants,
QUESTION:

The prosecutor, on the contrary, emphasised

13

to a great extent the conduct in leaving th© man out on th®
road and the probability that he would b© ©sspossed to great
danger?
MRS. COHENj

All of th© arguments in this case are

very emotional in that sens®.
very dramatic.
dramatic.

You know, th© facts are really

They ar© very unusual, but they are very

The picture of this very helpless man, in a state

of undress, left in th© free zing weather on th® side of th©
road, without his glasses, this was hammered at constantly,
*

and that was hammered at by the prosecution to show responsi­
bility and it was disputed by the defense who said it simply
was not foreseeable.
With respect to counsels' likely satisfaction that
th© issue was proparly before the jury, I point to the state­
ment by counsel for Sr all who, even before the charge to th©
jury, said in summation, you probably have the counts wall in
kind since we have all gone over it.

Now, at that point in

ths trial, th© indictment had been road to the jury by Kibbe's
counsel in summation, it. had been outlined by the district
attorney in his opening, the record indicates that it was
read to the jury during th® voir dir© as each new pan©! was
brought in, thereafter Krall’s attorney proceeded to read the
indictment to th© jury and the judge at th© beginning of his
charge read th© indictment to the jury.

The judge also read

th© provisions of th® statute after emphasising that every

14
alament of the crime had to be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.
i\nd ultimately, while the jury was deliberating , the
indictment was given to them so that they could track the
charges.
Despite these repeated statements of the law to the
jury- and despite the fact that causation was argued so
graphically to the jury by both defense counsel., the court
below questioned whether the jury was aware that it had to
decide the issue of causation.

This conclusion, in my opinion,

cannot be sustained on the record in this cas©, and we believe
that the explanation for the court’s speculation that the jury
may not have been aware of this issue which was the focus of
the trial, was its failure to make an analysis of this trial
as mandated by this Court in Cupp v. Naughten.
In Cupp, this Court specifically reaffirmed what it
called the fundamental princi.pl© that a single jury instruction
may not be evaluated only in the context of the overall charge
but in the context of the entire trial.
QUESTIONs

Thar© is nothing vary new about that idea,

is there?
MRS. COHEN:

No, but the Court used the words

"fundamental principle, *' it took it as given, and in doing so
emphasised the relevance of the witnesses’ testimony and th©
relevance of the arguments of counsel.

15

In the instant case, insofar as this court keloid
acknowledged these factors, they did it in a footnote, consid­
ering the fact that this is supposed to be an alternat® holding
in the case, and they discounted them in much th© same way that
they discounted the relevance of reading the statute and read­
ing the indictment to the jury.

That is, they lifted each of

these factors out of the context of the trial and they examined
them one by one, and they, rejected them,

instead of making

the overall ©valuation which Cupp requires, of whether or not
the trial as a whole was fundamentally fair.
Now, respondent attempts to distinguish Cupp on the
grounds that the alleged, error there was corrected within the
confines of the charge itself and there was no recourse to the
other ©vents of the trial.
To me this argument highlights th® real distinction
bstwssn Cupp and this case.

Cupp involved challenge to an

affirmative instruction to th® jury.

The jury was told there

that it should find that the prosecution's witnesses had told
ths truth unless th® presumption of innocence — excuse me,
th© presumption of truthfulness was overcome.

Therefore, in

Cupp it became necessary to determine whether anything in th®
remainder of the charge offset, th® impact on the minds of th©
jury of that directive by the trial judge.
The instant c&s© is quite different.

Th© charge to

th© jury in th© instant case was perfectly adequate' as far as

16
it want t and in fact the court below characterized much of
the charge as scrupulous.

We believe that bscaus© the trial

judge did not affirmatively rads lead the jury, did not
affirmatively say anything to them which had to b© erased
from their minds *—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE burgers

W® will r@su©m there at

Is 00 o’clock, Mrs. Cohen.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed
unti1 Is 00 o5clock p.m.]

17
AFTERNOON SESSION - la 00 O'CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mrs. Cohen, you may

continue.
MRS. COHENs

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court;
Before the recess, I was addressing respondent's
contention that Cupp v. Naughten was simply a caseinvolving a
self-correcting instruction.

Petitioner belives that this

argument ignores the analysis that was endorsed by the Court
in Cupp without, I might add, denying its validity.
la fact-, because Cupp involved a challenge t© an
affirmative instruction to the jury, whereas this case involves
an emission, resort to what happened during the remainder of
the trial becomes even more germane.

Because th© trial judge

in this case did not affirmatively misadvise the jury u
mislead the jury, there was nothing which had to ba ©rased
from th© mind3 of the jurors or, as respondent says, neutral­
ised.

There was no infaction ©f the rest of the trial, the

rest of the trial was prefectly adequate.
Therefor©, th© question is simply whether the record
as a whol© shows that t.ha gap in th© charge was affectively
filled by the eve-nhs of trial, an approach which is consistent
not only with Cupp but which is consistent with the approach
used is all bebras corpus review.
In addition to its failure to properly apply Cupp,

18

the Circuit Court in its evaluation of this state court in­
struction also failed to credit factors upon which it has
relied in its own cases to sustain its own federal convictions
in a series of cases, of which the bast example is United
Statas v» Papa, in 533 Fed 2d.

The court below sustained

federal narcotic conspiracy convictions, despite the failure
in each of those cases on the part of the trial judge to
charge the element of knowledge to the jury.

In each instance,

the Circuit Court determined that th© jury was aware of the
missing element because the district judge had read to th©
jury both the statute and the indictment.

In Papa, it 'was

don© repeatedly, as it was done in this case.

It is clear

therefore that by refusing to give du© weight to the same
factors that it. has relied upon in reviewing its own convic­
tions, the court below was effectively holding this state
court trial judge to a higher standard than it has held its
own district judges.
QUESTIONs

Well, would you b@ making the same argu­

ment or would the same issue fo@ hare or any other if the
gentleman had been abandoned with his clothes on at the same
spot and h© had managed to crawl to the filling station and
then hs was murdered inside th© filling station by soma -tramps?
MRS. COHEN:

I

Wall, again that presupposes sera©
i

factual —
QUESTIONS

Perhaps you would never have prosecuted

19
him.

But assum® you had, would that kind of an instruction

have been adequate to pose, th© question?
MRS. COHEN:

Wall, New York law, so far as we have

been able to determine, has no standard or

valuation of

contributory negligence and it certainly does not seem to
follow th© decision cited by the respondent, the North Carolina
decision, which is to the effect that if th© victim has found
safety and then for reasons of his own abandons it and is
then injured or killed, that is not foreseeable.

New York

does not seem to -QUESTION:

Wall, h® never found safety apparently

because as soon, as he got in the filling station he was killed
by somebody else.

Now, is that — of course, he never would

have been out there and he never would have had to go to the
filling station except for th© fact that these people
abandoned him there.
MRS. COHEN:

Well, the question ultimately would

have been th© same question that it is in this case, and that
is was it foreseeable -that when they left this man at th© side
of the road he would then be killed, for example —
QUESTION:

That isn't what the instruction said, is

it?
MRS, COHEN:

The instructions to th© jury in this

case said —
QUESTION:

It mentioned cans© all right, but it

20

didn't talk about foreseeability.
MRS. COHENs
QUESTION:

Well —
At® you now suggesting that perhaps the

issue really was foreseeability?
MRS. COEENs

The issue was foreseeability throughout

the trial.
QUESTION*

Well, how did the jury even know that the

issue was foreseeability?
MRS. COHENs

they knew that the issue was foresee­

ability because it was argued to them affectively by all three
lawyers in this case, the prosecution and the two defensa
lawyers -questions

And then the judge says don't listen to

them, I will give you the law?
MRS* COHENs

No,- on the contrary.

The judge said to

thara vary explicitly, s© long as you find a basis for counsels'
arguments in the evidence, you may follow counsels" arguments

in reaching your conclusion.

And I don't believe even in the

decisions of tbs Circuit Court in reviewing its own convictions
it has concluded that a single statement by th® judg© that I
am the source of tfea law effectively wipes out the impact of
th® other arguments in the case.
QUESTION:

So tli© issue would foa th® sane here if he

had foaen struck by lightning on th© side of the road?
MRS. COHEN:

The issue would have been foreseeability..

21
The difference would have been that# as a matter of New York
law# I would suggest that that would have been an intervening#
a superseding clause and there might have been a different
cas© in that case.
QUESTION:

Well# I know# but the instruction that

was given to them wouldn't distinguish between any of the three
cases# the actual case, the filling station case or the
lightning case.
MRS. COHEN:

Yes.

But# on the other hand, we aren’t

simply dealing with the facts of this case# and it is our
argument in this case that had there been an explicit instruc­
tion to the jury in this case on foreseeability# the result
would have been that the defense would not have had available
to it the negligence that was involved in this case in arguing
to the jury that the defendants were not responsible.

I think

w© sort of have to focus on what happened in this particulas1
casa.

It is possible to conceive of all kinds of hypothetical

happenings# but that is not what happened in this case.

In

this case# there was simply a negligent driver who cam© along
the road.

Under New York lav/# this would have been regarded

as within the foreseeable consequences of leaving this man by
the aid® of the road in a helpless condition.
QUESTION:

Did this judge give the usually or at

least frequently given charge that you are to evaluate things
in the light of ordinary human experience?

22

MRS. COHEN:

Well, he certainly instructed them on

the need to prove tilings b®yoncl

&

reasonable doubt and in­

dicated to them what a reasonable doubt might be.

I don’t

recall that, ha specifically said that you may rely on your
common sense.

On the other hand, that was specifically argued

to th© jury by the district attorney, as a matter of common
sens®, when you look at what happened in this case, it must
foa self-evident, that these men leaving this victim by the side
of 'the. road in his condition would have foreseen as reasonable
men that this was a consequence of their actions.
QUESTION:

Is it common ground between you and your

adversary what the proper instructions would hav© bean had it
been given?
MRS. COHEN:

•

Your Honor, until our reply brief there

was never any discussion of what New York law was, and that is
one of the problems that we have with the opinion below.
was not argued to the Circuit Court.

It

The Circuit Court, in

concluding that an Instruction on causation might have been
helpful, never1 had recourse to New York law.

Instead, it

discussed the various decisions from other jurisdictions, many
of them very old.
QUESTIONt

Well, my question is, is it clear what

the instructions should hav© been, had it been given?
MRS. COHEN:
QUESTION:

I». our view, tha instruction —
Not in your view.

My question is, is it

23
c I ear i is New York clear what the instructions should have
been if the instructions had been given?
MRS. COHEN:

I think yes, and certainly th© decision

by th® Court of Appeals in this particular case reaffirms that
the instruction in this case would have been that notwith­
standing the fact that the defendants in this case ware not
the sola or the immediate cause, if it was foreseeable that
their conduct, would have resulted in the death by vehicle of
this victim, then you may convict him -- you may convict him.
QUESTION:

Is it different, from the ordinary concepts

of approximat® cause in a tort case in New York?
MRS. COHEN:

I don't think it is different in th©

sense of th© standard.

It is still a reasonable man standard.

But it is just that there is a different degree of negligence
that is required and
QUESTION:

Well, this isn't negligence, is it?

We

are talking about approximate cause.
MRS. COHEN:

Well, in this case, these defendants

were held to recklessness.

Th© charge to th® jury was that

you had to find that, these men w@r© aware of and consciously
disregarded a substantial risk,
QUESTION:
MRS. COHEN:
QUESTION:

What they did caused his death —
That’s right.
— but my question is, is caussa th® same

within th® meaning of this statute, th® same as the concepts

24

of: approximate cause under Hew York tort law or different?
MRS. COHENs

In the analysis, I would say yes, but

in terms of the degree of culpability required, no.

In

Kibbe —
QUESTION:

How my question is do you concede what

your adversary contends, that the prosecuting attorney in fact
gave an erroneous description of cause?
MRS. COHEN:

Hot at all.

We dispute that in the

MRS. COHEN:

Well, no, I bag to differ on that be­

QUESTION:

Wall, you rely a good deal -- you say yes,

the trial judge did fail to give any instruction on the meaning
of the word "cause" under the statute.

But you say all of

those blanks were filled in by argument of counsel, among
other things, the prosecutor argued at seme length.

But your

adversary says, ah-huh, but he gave: the wrong concept of
cause, he gave a "but for."
MRS. COHEN:

Under New York law, we point out in the

reply brief, "but for" certainly enters into the consideration
in this case and in «very case where causation is involved.

They certainly do not. cite any authority to

QUESTION:

MRS. COHEN:

I understand them to be reaching out to

decide a broad constitutional principle in this case.

It

seams to me that they ar© deciding a question of state law,
which is what ws have been discussing for the last few minutes,
and with which I ultimately quarrel with the Second Circuit

28
about..

It seems tli&t if toe court finds that the issue of

causation was bn for 6 the jury, then there is no constitutional
question remaining with respect to this instruction.

Insofar

as the court below set aside the conviction for failure to
more adequately charge causation, it assumed, as I indicated
before, the role of an appellat® court, of deciding an issue
of state 1aw, and we believe it is significant that neither
respondent nor the court below has cited a single case in
which a federal court has set aside a state criminal convic­
tion for an alleged error in an instruction to the jury.
QUESTION:

Is it possible tout the defense carefully

and studiously avoided a request for an instruction on causation on the grounds that the less said about causation the
better it would be for the defendants?
MRS. COHFNs

This is the thrust of our reply brief,

because although the law in New York prior to to® Kibbe de­
cision in the Court of Appeals was sparse, the Court of Appeals
had talked about, causation and ted made it clear that ordinary
negligence which follows the acts of to© defendant may not b®

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very wall.

Ms. Ginsberg*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA GINSBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF* THE RESPONDENT
MS. GINSBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Court:
As a presliminary matter, let me say that Mr. Krall
did not file a habeas corpus petition with Mr. Kibbe.

Mr.

Kibfo© filed this petition pro sa in the District Court in the
Northern District of New York after the Second Circuit ruling.
It is my under standing that Mr. Krall filed his own pro se
petition and that is still pending in the Northern. District of

31
Haw York.
In petitioner's own analysis of New York law, fore­
seeability is the key to determining causation.

Tbs problem

for petitioner in this assertion is that the jury didn’t, know
that.

Causation was a bitterly contested issue at trial in

this case.

The defense contended that Kibb© and Krall had

left Stafford on the shoulder of a lightly trafficked road
that was two lanes wide, and they had left him no more than
75 feet from an open and lighted gas station.

Stafford had

been left at that spot, the defense contended, because having
seen th© lights and the gas station he asked to ha let out
there.
That the road was lightly trafficked is established
by a great deal of evidence in this case.

As a preliminary

matter, after Blake, the driver of the truck, hit Stafford, he
turned around in the north™bound lain© and drove south until he
reached the body.

Now, I submit to this Court that that is

hardly the kind of conduct that a driver familiar with the
road, as Blake testified he was, would have engaged in if the
road was highly trafficked.
Moreover, Kibb©, in his custodial statement, asserted
that there were no cars in the vicinity, and Krall, though he
did acknowledge that there war© cars, said that there ware few.
What this record shows in fact is that in ih® forty minutes
that transpired her®, only four vehicles were on that road

32

Kibbe's, Blake’s a®d the two on-coming cars that triad to
signal unsuccessfully to Blake to slow dovm.
Now, there is another factor in this scenario that
militates very strongly against the foreseeability of.
Stafford’s injury, and that was Stafford's awareness and desire
to go to the gas station.
QUESTION s

D© you say that it is not foreseeable

that scan© automobiles would be traveling on that road?
MS. GINSBERG;

Well, Your Honor, the requirements

of foreseeability in this case are that, the defendant be aware
of the risk of death by the specific agency that actually in”
filched the harm.
QUESTION;

Well, if the defendant was driving a car

there, why should it not be foreseeable that other people
would be driving there, and the road is provided for that
purpose?
MS. GINSBERG;
it was a narrow roadway.
asked to get out there.

Well, that is true, Your Honor, but
Stafford knew of the gas station,
Kibbe, in his experience, knew that

the road was not heavily trafficked, it was not, if you will,
like trying to get across the New York State Thruway.

It was

a. two-lane country roadway, and I submit that on those facts,
and these are the facts that the defense relied on, it was
reasonable for Kibbe to expect, Stafford to get across the
highway to tha gas station.

It was no more, on the defense

33

theory, than 75 feet.

And Stafford was aware of the station

and ha merely had to cross two lanes of 'traffic.

MS. GINSBERG;
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor

Do you disagree with that?

MS. GINSBERG:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

The problem

with that is that the jury was rot instructed on causation and
we don't know what they considered in reaching their ultimate
verdict of guilt.

We contend that 'they did not consider

causation,
QUESTION:

But. why should that affect the normal

rule that where there are disputes you presume the jury re­
solved the disputes in favor of the prevailing aid©?
MS. GINSBERG:

That is the situation in which the

jury has been properly and adequately instructed on th© facts
of th© crime — excuse me, the elements of th© crime.

The

problem her© is that th© jury didn’t know that they had to de­
termine causation.

Moreover, they didn’t know what that

consider foreseeability.

They didn't know that they had to

It was as Iced earlier this morning about Kibbe's suggestion
or warning to Stafford to get inside»

But I would contend

that what he meant by -that was to get to the gas station.
What that shows is that Kibbs believed that the gas station
was accessible and that Stafford knew it was accessible, and
Kibbs did not foresee that h® would freese to death.

He

foresaw that he would get to the gas station and b© safe
there.
QUESTIONS

Well, we ar© not here trying the inno­

cence or guilt of this person or trying to av&luat® the merits
of this lawsuit, but simply to determine whether the Court of
Appeals was correct in holding that it was a constitutional
violation for the trial judge not to specifically instruct on
the meaning of the word "cause" under the New York statute.
That is the issue here, isn't it?
MS. GINSBERG;

Exactly.

Exactly, Your Honor.

We

would submit, and I think the Second Circuit found, that due
process requires not only that the prosecution prove each and
every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt but that
the finder of fact assess that evidence and find that it is
sufficient.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly there can foe no serious

claim that the jury didn't find ©vary element of the crime
beyond a reasontbla doubt because they war© instructed correct
ly as to th© burden of proof of the prosecution beyond a

33
reasonable doubt and they were given this statute in hip®
verba which uses the word "cause."

So there can be no serious

question but what the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt
that your client caused this person’s death.

Now, the problem

is, as th© Court of Appeals held, that it was a constitutional
violation not. -to instruct as to th® meaning of the word '’cause”
and that, is what fell® case is about, isn’t, it?
MS. GINSBERG:

Hell, what I would say is that in

this context on fch** difficult facts of this case and. th® con»
\

piex and intricate problems ©f causation presented by this
case, th® failure to explain causation is tantamount to no
instruction on causation at all.
QUESTION:

Well, now, as a matter ©f New York law,

you arc mistaken, aren’t you?

Th© New York courts have held

against you in this particular ease, holding both the Appellate
Division and the New York Court of Appeals have hold that the
instructions were sufficient, as a matter of New York law.
MS. GINSBERG:

No, Your Honor, that is not correct.

I have to'take issue with that.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

What do you have to say about the question

I put to your friend that any clarification of causation was
carefully avoided by the defense because the less said about
causation the bettor for the defense?

Was that a tactic of

the defense?
MS. GINSBERG:
QUESTION:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

Well, what is there in this record that

will suggest to support your answer?
MS. GINSBERG:

■i
As a preliminary matter, I would like

to say that the Second Circuit specifically found that the

40
failure to object in this case was an isaadvartent failure
that counsel, having argued as h© did prior to trial and at
the close of the state's case

that causation had not been

established hers, it was clearly the defense's position that
the state had not sufficiently established foreseeability and
the other elements of causation that are required.
Now, I think that it is clear from the defense's
contention and indeed from the petitioner *s own assessment of.
New York law that the defendant could not help but have bean
benefitted by a detailed charge ©n causation.

QUESTIONS

MS. GINSBERG;

Your Honor, I was not of course trial

counsel araS I cannot from personal first-hand knowledge, but
I would say it war. just inadvertence.
QUESTION;

But having discussed the subject as much

as it was discussed and having contemplated it ©sough to talk
about it in extenso in the closing arguments, how can — isn't
it remarkable to suggest that that is an inadvertent over­
sight?
MS. GINSBERG;

Well, Your Honor, I don't think so.

I think sometimes in fcfe® give and take of the heat of the
moment and the concerns that a trial lawyer may have about
other things,"the failure -to object to a particular charge may

41
well have escaped him.
The important: thing now is to look at that charge
and to assess it in terms of what New York law would require,
and I don’t think that there can ba any dispute .about the
gross deficiencies of this charge.
QUESTION:

Well, the New York courts have differed

with you on that, they have affirmed — two appellat® courts
have affirmed this conviction, s© you can't really say that
New York law requires that any more ha don© than was don® in
this case.
MS. GINSBERG:
QUESTION:

Well --

Th© New York courts have said that you

are wrong about it.
MS. GINSBERG:

What I would have to say in answer

to that, Your Honor, is that in fact in Kibbe itself, whan th©
court was addressing the question of sufficiency of the evi­
dence ©a the question of causation, th© court specifically
halt! ‘that it was critical t© a finding of causation that, th©

»

Petitioner does not even contend that th© judge in
this case charged foreseeability.

There can b© no question

that that charge, in answer €o Mr. Justice Burger’s question,
would have helped th© petitioner.

This in no way, shape or

part of the defense.

QUESTIONS

Ms. Ginsberg, can I ask about that.

Do

MS. GINSBERG:

Your Honor, not in this proceeding,

we do not.
QUESTION:

Well, then would you not agree that we

must accept at least this much of th© -jury verdict as having
established that the defendant had the requisite intent to
commit the crime?
MS. GINSBERG:

This particular statute under New

York law does not, as the Second Circuit noted in a footnote,
require intent.

instructions should have been mad© and why the system can
only function if those things are made at th© appropriate
time?
MS. GINSBERG:

Your Honor, I would in candor have

to concede that a request would have been helpful.

But as th©

Second Circuit found, th© failure to request was inadvertent.
All the defense counsel did was to contest causation.

In.

fact, under New York law, there is a requirement for the judge
as a preliminary basic matter to charge sufficiently cm all
th© ©laments of the crime. . The judge in this case had an
obligation as wall, and in light of defense counsel's presen­
tation of the issue of causation
had some obligation as well*

QUESTIONS

How did the inadvertence run all the way

up to the appellato division?
MS. GINSBERGs

Well, Your Honor, again I cannot

speak to that, but I would point out, as has been pointed out
to me, the appellate division did consider this charge on the
merits.
QUESTION;

If they hadn't, I guess this point never

would have gotten here, would it?
MS. GINSBERG;
QUESTION;

I mean if we had left it to counsel for

the petitioner, he never
MS. GINSBERG;
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor ~

would have raised it.
Well, Your Honor —

I mean respondent, h© never would have

raised it.
MS. GINSBERG:

Well, I don't know that that is so.

That is a hypothesis and I can't really speak to that.
QUESTION:

Wh@r@ do you locate in the Constitution

his requirement to give a foreseeabiMty instruction?

Let's

suppar ihe judge had said here — you not© that I used the word
"cause," members of the jury, now I really mean it, you must
find that the defendant caused the death of the victim, and
he didn’t say anything more.

You would still ba hare saying

•that h© should have defined cause?
MS. GINSBERG:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Not because my Brother Stewart said the

48

jury didn't find cause in finding him guilty? they must have
because he said? really now? you must find causation? and
the jury finds him guilty so they found causation.

Mow? why

would you ~~ where in the Constitution is there a requirement
for the judge not only to say now X really I mean it, find
cause? where is the requirement that h© must, define it in
terms of forase@abil.ity?
MS. GINSBERG:

Well? as I know that Your Honor is

aware? that didn't happen in this case.

The judge didn’t even

identify causation.
QUESTION:

I know, but you would still ba her© on

the same ground? I am sure you would.

Now? where is the pro­

vision, for foreseeability?
MS. GINSBERG:

The Second Circuit found and we

assert here that the failure to explain causation precluded
the jurors from finding that element beyond a reasonable
doubt*
QUESTION:

No? the judge said you must find causation

and they found causation.

It is just that you don’t like the

way — you don’t like the fact that the jury might not have
decided on foreseeability.
MS. GINSBERG:

Well? it is not a matter of might?

Your Honor? it is an absolute fact? a certainty if you will.
Uninstructed —
QUESTION:

it was instructed in my example on

49

causation, and so was this jury on causation.
MS. GINSBERG:

Well, Your Honor, hut the instruction

given or th© example given by th® prosecutor —
QUESTION:

Well, the jury was just left free to

find causation th® way, I guess they decided what causation
meant and they found it.
MS, GINSBERG:

Well, Your Honor, it is our position

»

that the judge’s failure to identify causation is an issue or
to specifically direct that the jury find causation, communi"
cated to th© jury th© belief that causation was to b© assumed.
This misconception was fostered, if you will, by th© arguments
of the prosecutor when he told the jurors basically, using- th®
"but for" test, that they could convict if they found that
/

Stafford would not have died but for ‘th© conduct of Kibfo®. and
Ktall.
QUESTION:

Well, the jury must have agreed with him.

Thay at least found "but for" cause.
MS. GINSBERG:

But that is not the test, and that is

tantamount to no finding of causation at all.
QUESTION:

I don't sea where you get that.

must have found at least a "but for" causa.

The jury

Now, is that ua-

constitu ticnal?
MS, GINSBERG:

it is tantamount on these facts to not

finding causation at all because —
QUESTION:

You keep saying that but I am not sure I

50
will ever believe it.
MS» GINSBERG:

— uninstructed ors if you will, under

the guidance ©£ the prosecutor, the jury
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume the judge had inV

P

structed on "but for" cause and said, look, jury, her© is
what I mean by cause, it means but for, that's all, and then
explained what "but for" was, would you be her©?

I would

suppose you would be claiming that the "but for caus©" is un~
constitutional.
MS. GlNSBERGs

Well, with the caveat that that is

not what happened her©, but the judge told the jurors that he
/as would instruct on the law .and' then failed to tell them
anything about, causation, the use of the "but. for" test en­
couraged the jurors to believe that causation could be
assumed so long as they found that Kifobe's conduct formed a
link, if you will, in the chain ©£ ©vents
QUESTION:

If they hadn't hav© left him by the road,

he probably wouldn't, have been run over.
MS, GINSBERG:

But, Your Honor, as you pointed out

in the course of the petitioner's argument, under this mis conception if respondents having left Stafford on the side of
tha road, if h® was subsequently hit by lightning or hit by a
crashing piano that 'ironically crashed on the roadway, Klbbe
would be guilty of murder,
questions

And would you say that would be

51
unconstitutional?
MS. GINSBERG:

Ob the aharg® that was given in this

case, i would say yes.
QUESTION s

For what, reason?

MS, GINSBERG;

Because on this charge 'the jurors

could not have found causation as that —
QUESTION:

As the Constitution requires causation

to be defined?
MS. GINSBERG;

As the Constitution requires that

each element of the crime be presented to the jury so that
they may make that determination.
QUESTION;
on© question.

Ms. Ginsberg, 1st mo just follow up with

Do I correctly state the law of New York when

I say that the instruction that should have been given
substance should have said that the .causation *— that the
chain of causation will be broken if death was caused by an

able?

Because isn't it rather clear that.

• . . llw that a truck would have been driving down

this highway at this hour of th® night?

HS. -IJNSBERG:

Ti'-r: — th:'. simple answer t<- your

52
question is no, on these facts it would not have in any way
hurt fell© defense,, it would not hav© put them in any worse,
position than they were without it.
QUESTION:

Well, to put it. somewhat differently? the

instructions ar© long and they often confuse the jury, as you
know.

Do you think it is conceivable that the lawyer might

0

have felt that that doesn't really add very much to the
charge, putting, that in, exercising the question of foresee­
ability of the fact that a truck driver might be driving down
this road at that hour of the night?
MS. GINSBERG:

No, Your Honor, because if the de­

fense contentions are accepted, all that Stafford had to do
when fee was let out of the car was to quickly cross the road
where the gas station was there to offer him shelter.
QUESTION:

And doesn't that same point go to whether

it was reckless and high degree of death', if you assume- that
h@ can get up and walk across the road, then they weren't
reckless.

It seems to me that the jury must hav© decided that

against you.
MS. GINSBERG:

Well, Your Honor, as I said earlier

is a much lesser standard•
QUESTION:

Unless you ar® assuming -that the truck

had to come along at the very moment while he was trying to
run across the road, which I don't think that is —
MS. GINSBERG:

Reckless is a much lesser standard

53

because it requires only —
QUESTION;

Would you not agree that if it was fore­

seeable, the thing they reasonably expected was that h© would
get up where they left him off and walk across the road to
the gas station, if that was the state of facts and everybody
thought was for©se@able,. then they really weren’t reckless.
MS. GINSBERG:

Well, Your Honor, recklessness goes

to — I would say recklessness goes to several of the fact
situations or fact hypotheses in this case, and I would sugrait that the jury might, well have found recklessness with re­
gard to the weather conditions, that even —
QUESTION:

Well, what if it is cold, if he just has

to walk across th© street and get in a warm gas station?
MS. GINSBERG:

Well, that nay well be, Your Honor,

but that was a question of fact which the jury —
QUESTION:

But you are saying that it is conceivable

they could have resolved the factual issue of reckless on®
way and the factual issue of foreseeability another way?
MS. GINSBERG:
QUESTION:

That is th© heart of your ease?

MS. GINSBERG:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

Even though he was drunk?

MS. GINSBERGS
QUESTION;

Exactly.

Yes, Your Honor.

Because the record shows that, despite

what you said, the expert testified — does that indicate a

54
high degree of intoxication, 25 parcent — the answer was a
very heavy degree of intoxication.

So wa read differant

sections of the record,, didn’t we?
MS. GINSBERGs

Exactly, and it was a question of

fact for the jury TO determine.
