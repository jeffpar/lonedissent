MR. CHIEF justice BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-439, Territory of Guam v. Olsen.
Mr. Troutman, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES H. TROUTMAN, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TROUTMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The essence of this case is the ability of the
Territory of Guam to determine for itself the type of court
system it desires for its own local cases.

The specific ques­

tion presented in this cas© is whether section 22 of the
Organic Act of Guam, which is 48 United States Code 1424, per­
mits the Legislature of Guam to create an Appellate Division
-- rather create a Supreme Court of Guam and transfer from the
Appellate Division of the District,Court to the Supreme Court
of Guam all appeals from the lower courts of the territory.
A brief history of this legislation I believe is in
order.

First, in 1974, the 12th Guam Legislature decided that

it was time to have the local court system, in its opinion any­
how, as autonomous as the rest of the government had become.
la 1950, the Organic Act created a civil government
for the Territory of Guam and created at that time a legisla­
ture having legislative authority over all matters of local
interest.

A Governor of Guam was also created, who was an

4
appointed official, appointed by the President, answerable to
the Interior Department, and section 22 of the Organic Act
created a court system similar to but significantly different
from that in the other territories, probably most similar to
that of tha old Arizona Territory.
•Then there were certain significant amendments in
1951 and 1958, which I -shall discuss later.

And then in 1970,

the Elective Governor Act was adopted, which gave Guam its
first elected Governor, elected locally.
Then in 1974, the Legislature of Guam amended tha
local codas of Guam which had previously by tha first Guam
Legislators created the Appellate Division of the District
Court, it amended these laws to provide for a Supreme Court of
Guam and a Superior Court, which was then the Superior Court
being a court of local jurisdiction.
As soon as a case could go through the process of thei
then Superior Court, it came up for appeal before the Supreme
Court.

This was Aganu Bay v. Dillingham,

And as soon as the

Supreme Court -had received it, the Agana Bay Company pe­
titioned to the District Court of Guam to issue & writ of pro­
hibition declaring that the Supreme Court of Guam had no
authority to hear appeals from any sort of lower court,
activity.

The District Court of Guam than granted this writ

which was thereupon appealed to the Ninth Circuit and on
January 17, 1976, the Ninth Circuit, a panel of three judges,

5
reversed the District Court, saying that the Supreme Court
under the Organic Act did have a right to exist and hear cases
on appeal.
Meanwhile, the respondent in this case, Olsen, had
been convicted in the Superior Court of various crimes,
burglary, receiving stolen property and assault with a deadly
weapon.

He had appealed both to the Supreme Court and, -the

District Court on th© generally held belief at that time that
nc on© knew which court would hear the appeal.
As soon as the Agana Bay decision cam© down, th®
District Court then reversed or rather denied th© appeal in the
Olsen case, saying that it had no jurisdiction.

This denial

was then appealed to th® Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and
before the Ninth Circuit could act a petition for certiorari
was filed by th© respondents in this-action, which was denied.
Then the Ninth Circuit ea bench, but without further briefs or
argument, reversed the opinion in the Agana Bay case, declaring
that th© Supreme Court of Guam could not hear, had no jurisdic­
tion to hear appeals because the Guam Legislature had no power
to create one under the Organic Act.
QUESTION:

Agana Bay and this cas© are two wholly

separate cases, ar© they not?
MR. TROUTMAN:

They are completely separate, Your

Honor, except that the issue involved is the same.
QUESTION:

Just as a matter of curiosity, is the

6-7
personnel of the new courts established in Guam confined to
persons admitted to the bar in Guam?

In other words, do

judges have to be lawyers?
MR. TROUTMAN;

Oh, yes, except for the police court,

and that only for the encumbent.
QUESTION;

The current —

Just a grandfather clause?

MR. TOURTMAN;

Yes, for the on® judge.

Actually,

though, not for the bar of Guam, Your Honor, because the compo­
sition of the new court, of the Supreme Court of Guam, would
have been almost identical to that of the Appellate Division of
the District Court in that; the Chief Justice was the only
Justice appointed, and h© was a member of the bar and had to
bs a member of the bar of Guam.

Eut he would designate two

other Associata Justices from among a group which would includet
a District Judge, with his consent, ncn-invoived judges of the
Superior Court or one of the judges of the high court in the
Trust Territory with their consent, which is the same way that
the Appellate Division is now constituted under the Organic Act,
'of Guam, section 22 {a}, "the second paragraph.
QUESTION;

Mien the second paragraph refers then to

three judges of the District Court of Guam, it is not talking
about three federal district judges, I gather?
MR. TROUTMAN:

No, Your Honor, there are no Article

III courts applicable to Guam as original or appellate jurisdiction on the island.

Th® only Article III court that is

8

involved in the Guam cases is the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals.
QUESTION;

So even the District Court of Guam is not

an Article III court?
MR. TROUTMAN;

No, Your Honor, that is a legislative

court, created by the Organic Act of Guam in 1950.
QUESTION;

And its decisions are appealable to the

Ninth Circuit?
MR. TROUTMAN;
QUESTION;

That is correct, yes.

But not the Supreme Court of Guam?

MR. TROUTMAN;

That is correct, because the Supreme

Court did not exist —
QUESTION;

Wall, under this plan that you would sup­

port, there would be a good many federal questions that would
end up with the Supreme Court of Guam subject to no federal
review?
MR. TROUTMAN;

Collateral questions.

You see, the

District Court of Guam, Your Honor, has exclusive jurisdiction
over all cases which arise under the
QUESTION:

Wall, that is arising under —

TROUTMAN:

— and, ©f course, income tax, but other

issues, yas -QUESTION:

But only federal offenses would never b©

subject to federal review?
MR. TROUTMAN;

Up to a point, Your Honor, not on

9

direct appeal.

We believe —

QUESTIONS

Hew about a federal constitutioml defense

to a case in a Guam court?
MR. TROUTMAN:

Well, in a criminal case, Your Honor,

we would believe that it could be brought on a writ of habeas
corpus in the District Court.
QUESTIONs

Well, what about a civil case?

MR. TROUTMAN:

A civil case, that presents more of a

problem.
QUESTION:

That is a euphemism for it is not appeal­

able to a federal court?
MR. TROUTMAN:

Correct.

At the time the Guam Legis­

lature passed the Court Reorganization Act, -they also passed a
resolution requesting Congress to amend the Organic Act to
provide -QUESTION:

Yes, but until that is dona there would be

jno appeal?
MR. TROUTMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

1933 applies to Guam?

MR. TROUTMAN:

Yes, it does completely.

I think wa need to look at the —
QUESTION:

May I just ask you —

MR. TROUTMAN:
QUESTION:

Certainly.

I gather that as this decision now stands,

there is no such things as the Supreme Court of Guam?

10
MR. TROUTMAN:

Thai; is correct.

And the appeals now

pending -QUESTION:

Is this hecauss the statute has been read

to mean that there is no authority to create this court, there
was no authority given with jurisdiction?
MR. TROUTMAN:

No.

Th© authority I would say would

be that there is no authority to create this court.
QUESTION;

But no authority to transfer any appellate

jurisdiction?
MR. TROUTMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is what you really mean?

MR. TROUTMAN:

That is what I really mean.

But th©

original decision actually in Agana Bay said that there was no
authority to create th© court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Troutman, following up on Justice

White's question, under your view of the Organic Act, would it
have been possible to create a local, court to try local matters
and have no appellate review whatsoever of that court's de­
cisions?
MR. TROUTMAN;

Yes, Your Honor, it would be because

th® Organic Act states that, to begin with, the District Court
of Guam shall have such appellate jurisdiction as th® Legisla­
ture of Guam determines, so -that if the Legislature of Guam
didn't deterrains any jurisdiction, regardless of what else it
created, if it didn't act to deterrain© there was jurisdiction

11
in the District Court, then it wouldn't have any.

This is

sort of a question 'that we ar© facing with many cases right
now, because the case below has said that the Legislature
cannot transfer

jurisdiction from the appellate division to a

Supreme Court, yet what the Legislature has don© is repeal any
authorization of jurisdiction to the District Coux*t and has
not yet acted to replace it with anything.
QUESTION;

So that if we merely hold that th© Supreme

Court of Guam is not properly constituted under the present
stats of the law, there would fas a trial in a Guam court with
no review of the federal question in any court?
MR. TROUTMAN;

In any court, that is unfortunately

the case, y@s.
The Organic Act of Guam is quite different from the
Act of the Virgin Islands and other territories.

Most of the

early western territories actually, except Arizona, provided a
complete court system.

They set up a Supreme Court, District

Courts, Probata Courts, Justice of the Peace Courts.

In

Arizona, however, they set up a court which said — they set up
a District Court and such other inferior courts as th© Legisla­
ture may or may not determine.

In the Virgin Islands, the

Legislature of the Virgin Islands today only has authority to
create inferior courts and also has very limited authority to
create exclusive jurisdiction in th® courts that it doss
create.

But. on Guam the Congress has said no such thing.

There

12
is no — the judicial authority of Guam is vested in not only
•the District Court hut in such court or courts as the Legisla­
ture may create.

There is no word anywhere in the judiciary

section of the Organic Act which would act to mention the word
inferior court to otherwise limit the Legislature in the typ©
of courts that it would create.
QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General» what if any affect

on this case does the 1976 legislation, congressional legisla­
tion have?
MR. TROUTMAN;

On the Guam Constitution?
\

QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. TROUTMAN:

Relatively limited, I believe. Your

Honor, for several reasons.

The first is that it applies only

to a Guam Constitution which hasn't yat been written, and the
constitutional convention will fc© called for later this year,
June, and under the timetable Congress would not receive it
until possibly early 1978.

But presently approximately forty

cases on appeal are awaiting decision on this case in the
courts of Guam.

So there are — we are talking now about ex­

isting Guam, not as what it may be after the Guam Constitution
has com© about.
On the second part of that question, Your Honor,
from the: history of the 1976 legislation that passed, it would
indicate that the reason for section 2 (b)(7) regarding the
courts was not so much that Congress was trying to interpret

13
the existing Organic Act but because they were at a quandary
to know how to interpret the situation in light of this contiming litigation, because at that time, at the tima that was
inserted, the Ninth Circuit decision, en banc decision had
ccxne down but certiorari had not yet been granted, so they
assumed that that decision was final and acted accordingly,
I think that the congressional intent, if you can
find any in the original Organic Act, is not as respondents
would urge, that Guam could not -- was barred completely from
creating this type of court? Congress originally considered
two versions of the Organic Act, two or three,

in which they

created in these proposals various forms of a court system
similar to a state court system.

In other words, they said

this is the system and treated it. more as a constitution.
However, they rejected all of these versions and came
cut with what is now 22(a) of the Organic Act, plus other
parts which have since been amended.

In fact, later, in 1951,

when they realized how much appellata jurisdiction the. lag is-”
latura had given them, they ware forced to amend the judiciary
section so that appeals would go from the Appellate Division to
the Ninth circuit as was desired at that tima, for the simple
reason that before the 1951 amendment there was a limited right
of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in matters, in felonies and in
matters in excess of $3,000.

Everything below that was not

appealable, but these were just the matters that were being

14
appealed to the Appellate Division of -the District Court.

So

there was a desire that they not end there at that time.
Then in 1953 it was determined that with the in­
creasing amount of appeals again, the former system of assign­
ing judges to fcha District Court was simply unworkable, chiefly
because of the distance, they were assigned by the Chief Justice
of this Court, and also they came from Article III courts of
the United States.

So it was amended to provide that designa­

tion of associate judges for this Appellate Division would be
provided by the presiding judge of the Appellate Division from
among judges able to sit on the District Court, namely judges
who had been designated by either the Chief Justice or the
Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, and also from judges in the
high court of the Trust Territory, which incidentally has no
judicial jurisdiction ovar Guam whatsoever.
It is also interesting for comparison to note the
covenant of the Northern. Marianas recently passed also, while
there they did provide for the proper route to appeal to an
Article III court, they did that because, all of the parties
were then knowledgeable that — were ‘then quite aware that the
Northern Marianas would probably eventually be creating its
own courts.

But the language giving jurisdiction to its

Appellate Division is very similar to that found in the
Organic Act of Gu&m.
QUESTIONS

Is that in your brief?

I believe it is in

15
your brief, isn't: it?
I®. TROUTMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

It is on

pag© 5 of the brief for the petitioners.
QUESTIONi

The language authorizing the creation of

the courts is very similar -MR. TROUTMANi

No, authorizing the Appellate Division.

We sr© not here talking about the authority of Guam to creat®
lower courts, in other words courts of general jurisdiction.
But section 402(c) says the District Court, now referring to
the Northern Marianas, the District Court will have such appel­
late jurisdiction as the Constitution or laws of the Northern
Mariam Islands may provide.

Then they go on to say when it

sits as an .Appellat© Court, the District Court will consist of
three judges, at least one of whom will be a judge of a court
of record of the Northern Mariana Islands.
So the first sentence of this is very similar to that
in the Organic Act of Guam, referring to appeals, where it says
in section 22 r~.), talking about jurisdiction, the District
Court, it says, shall have original jurisdiction in all otter
causes in Guam, jurisdiction over which ’has not been trans£erred by the Legislature to other court or courts established
by it, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as the Legis­
lature may determine.
QUESTION:

It is that phrase that you say is written

similar to — will have such appellate jurisdiction as the

16
constitution or laws of the Northern Mariam Islands may pro­
vide.?
MR. TROUTMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

You are making that comparison?

MR. TROUTMAN;

I am, yes, that is the point of the

comparison.
QUESTION:
tion.

Mr. Troutman, may I ask on© other ques­

Th® language you just; read, the transfer of original

jurisdiction language, that is broad enough to cover, as I
would read it, at laast I think, transfer of cases arising
under federal law?

MR. TROUTMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

Would you agree with that?

MR. TROUTMAN:

No, I would not, Your Honor, bacaus©

prior to that statement, the full sentence reads, the District
Court of Guam will have the jurisdiction of a District Court
of the Unit'd states in all causes arising under the Constitu­
tion? treaties and laws of the United States, regardless of
fchs sum or value of the matter in controversy, shall have
original, jurisdiction in all other causes in Guam, jurisdiction
over which has not been transferred.

QUESTION:

I 8<B&.

MR. TROUTMAN:

So that the only thing 'that can be

transferred. is crfchsr causes than what this —

QUESTION:

I SS®,

17
QUESTION:

What does that do to diversity casas?

MR. TROUTMAN:

This, Your Honor, I cannot rightly say

because this is currently in litigation at the present time.
QUESTION;

Yes, because it is contradictory, isn't

it, about diversity?
MR. TROUTMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

It would b€5.

It can't both have the

jurisdiction of a federal District Court and still fee transfer­
able to another court?
MR. TROUTMAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

You can read Tidewater Mutual.

MR. TROUTMAN:

The issue I believe in diversity is

that diversity basically is not a cause arising under- the law
of Guam.

That is one argument.
QUESTION:

I know, but it says the jurisdiction of

the federal court.
MR. TROUTMAN:

That's true.

And actually at the

present time the District Court of Guam has assumed that it
does have diversity jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Well, then, diversity cases are not

transferable out of
MR. TROUTMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct, they are not.

So even though another court, says the

local court system is set. up, suiters have the choice then?
MR. TROUTMAN:

Under the existing law, that is

18

correct.
QUESTION?

I dor.8t understand why a diversity case

is not transferable.

I understand your answer as to cases

arising under federal law, but there is nothing in hare about
diversity cases not being transferable, is there?
MR. TROUTMAN:

Well, that particular question has not

been addressed in the Court Reorganization Act because its
jurisdictional statement is that jurisdiction lies in the
Superior Court in all cases arising under the laws of Guam.

So

actually there is a gap there of two types of cases which go
to the District Court.

One type I believe probably would b©

diversity, since Guam has no provisions itself for diversity
per sa, and also cases that probably arise under, say, aaothsr
law but are heard on Guara.

Litigation is going on in one of

those at the present time, for instance, which arise under the
laws of the Trust Territory, but the parties are found in Guam
and the case is pursued there.
We. would further argue that the appeal to a District
Court than to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is not actually
a matter of right that was established by the original Organic
Act, since under th® original Organic Act there was no right
to appeal to th© District Court to begin with.

This right had

to be mad® when it was mad.® by th.© Legislature of Guam.

This

was done in th® first Guam Legislature by really a court, a
separate division is what they called it, an appellate division

19
of the District Court, but that was a creature ©f Guam and not
of the Organic Act.
Our argument further is that the subsequent amend™
meats do not in essence repeal or emit that right of Guam to
change its original act in the first place.

In other words,

the second paragraph of section 22 of the Organic Act, where
it starts "appeals to the District Court of Guam shall be heard,
and determined by an Appellate Division,” and so forth, ‘this
does not state that appeals cannot b© heard any place sis®, but
merely provides the system that has developed that it should
h@ heard, if and assuming the Guam Legislature continues tha
appeals to the Appellate Division.
Guam has progressed far in its ability to determine
its own form of government within the Organic Act of Guam, and
w® are not arguing — our whole argument hare is that this is
permitted within the Organic Act, as it presently exists.
In cur view, the Organic Act of Guam represents maxi­
mum flexibility to Guam in determining the form of government
for the territory in. a much greater degree than has been pro­
vided by the Organic Acts of various other territories and
possessions.
In tha Florida case cited in our brief, American
Ocean Insurance v. 3 56 Bales of Cotton, this Court, back when
Florida was a territory ruled that the Congress may give to a
territory either the jurisdiction it wants to in a court system

20
or permit 'feliat territory to give, either what is normally
federal jurisdiction or local jurisdiction to a court ©£ its
choice.
QUESTION:

What other territories has Congress given

the jurisdiction which you claim was given here to Guam?
MR. TROUTMAN?

None, Your Honor, because very

specifically elsewhere, at least in recent history, it spells
out how the courts are to operate.

In the Virgin Islands, it

is vary specific that they state that local jurisdiction may
not — rather, it may create only inferior courts, and then it
actually provides that jurisdiction of the — rather, appeals
may ba taken — rather, shall b© taken from the lower courts
created by the jurisdiction of the Virgin Islands to the
District. Court of the Virgin Islands.

So that this is specific

ally stated.
In old Hawaii, when it was a territory, the Congress
actually created a Supreme Court and permitted inferior courts
to ba created and created certain intermediate courts also.
But there again they referred to inferior courts as the
province of the Hawaii legislature.
In Puerto Rico, under its Organic Act days, not
under the common law, of course, there was a court system
created again by the Organic Act but giving inferior powers to
tha Puerto Rican Legislature.

So that actually we are arguing

that the Guam Organic Act is different from that of other

21
jurisdictions* and this is why Guam claims its power.

If we

were operating under, say* the Virgin Islands* Hawaii or
Arizona Organic Acts, there is no question that Guam could not
do what it is presently doing.
QUESTION?

And under those acts the authority is

limited to creating non-appallafc© courts ~~
MR» TROUTMEAN:
QUESTIOMs

Yes, I would ~

— creating so-called inferior courts?

MR. TROUTMAN:

That is correct, Your Honor, it is.

It is either specifically limited to that or in some of the
older ones the whole setup, the whole court system is estab­
lished by Congress, leaving no -QUESTION:

No authority whatsoever?

MR. TROUTMAN:
QUESTION:

— no authority whatsoever.

While I have interrupted you, may I ask —•

you don't need to answer it now, bat I wonder if you are going
to address yourself to the impact upon this case, if any, of
the newly authorized constitutional convention, the CONCON
authorisation?
MR. TROUTMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, I don’t believe that

there is actually going to be that much impact at the moment.
I think the reason for this is what will happen is covered
adequately by the CONCON Act itself in that, number on®, I
cannot forecast what the CONCON will come up with.
have no idea at this point.

X really

I presume it will com© up with

22
something similar, but this is net — I have n© way ©£ telling>
The history cf that section 2(b)(7) indicates that
the matter of the relationship of whatever court is created
will __/© determined probably at the time that Congress approves
the Guam Constitution and be part of -the joint resolution.
This was the intent by counsel at the time of the Senate amend­
ment to that.
As to cases that are existing now, I don’t foresee that it
will have any effect whatsoever inasmuch as these cases, par­
ticularly criminal cases, are already in the appeal rout®
under existing laws, and I don’t see how the Guam CONCON Act
will be able to reverse or change what is presently the law.
QUESTIONS
federal review?

How would a cas® in the local courts get

Is there any direct federal review?

MR. TROUTMANs
QUESTION:

Under the existing law, Your Honor?

Yes.

MR. TROUTMAN:

Under the existing law, the review is

to the Appellate Division of the District Court which, being a
part of the District Court, you have a right to appeal auto­
matically to the Ninth Circuit Court.

This is how this case

came before this Court.
QUESTION:

Under year view of the jurisdiction, how

would on® gat to direct federal review?
MR. TROUTMAN:

In the criminal case such as this, I

imagine a criminal review would b® by habeas corpus in the

23
District Court.
question?

Well, that is not direct review, of

course.
MR. TROUTMAN?

No.

Under the present time, Your

Honor, there would be no direct review.
QUESTION:

If you are correct?

MR. TROUTMANs
QUESTION;
down.

Yes, assuming cur position.

I have one mors question before you sit

You indicated that consideration has been given to the

problem of providing direct review from a decision of the
Supreme Court of Guam.

Is the thought that that review would

be in the Ninth Circuit or in this Court, do you know?
HR. TROUTMAN:

Your Honor, there is actually quite a

bit of controversy on this point.

The Chief Justice appointed

a committee on the Pacific Territories which' held hearings in
Guam last August.

It seems to me the view of the bar of Guam

that they would like review to h@ to the Ninth Circuit since
this would actually provide more direct, mora number of
appeals since the chances of getting a review to this Court
are much lass.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Trapp.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD G. TRAPP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. TRAPP;

Mr. Chisf Justice, and may it pleas® the

24
Court;
Mr- Justice Statons asked a question, the answer to
which being given I was shocked to hear, bsacusa I believe his
question was, what if the Ninth Circuit's decision is upheld
ard. the Supreme Court of Guam remains stricken down, at th®
present time would there be any right of appeal in Guam at all,
and I believe Gen, Troutmanfs answer was no-

I submit that

th© answer to that question definitely is yes, because it is a
cornmon canon of statutory construction that if a statute is
amended and if for some reason — and if it is obvious that
th© intent is not to do away with th© remedy -that was given,
for example such a case as this, there was no intention to do
away with appeals altogether, but rather to direct appeals
through a different rout© and to a different court, and if
that repealer and substitute law ware declared invalid, then
of course the original law would spring back into being, and
under section 55 of fchs Guam Court Reorganization Act, it says
©very reference in law, rule or regulation to th© island court
shall be read to mean the Superior Court of Guam, it. means we
would still have the old law with the change which would not
be invalid, of changing th® old island court name to the
Superior Court, and than the law under the Ninth Circuit’s
latest decision would simply read that you can take appeals
from th® Superior Court of Guam to th© Appellate Division of
the District Court of Guam.

25
QUESTION:

Mr. Trapp, let me just modify the ques­

tion a little bit then.

Supposing the question is whether the

Organic Act would prevent the Guam Legislature from enacting
two statutes.

In the first statute they say we hereby with­

draw all appellat® jurisdiction from the District Court, and
that goes into effect, and I guess they hav® the power to do
that under -the Organic Act.

And ih©n secondly, a year later,

they pass the statute saying now appeals will be taken to the
newly created Guam Supreme Court, and then we knocked out the
second statutes, I suppos® then there would b© no appeal?
MR, TRAPP:

Well, in the first placa, I think w©

have at least raising its head a possible constitutional ques­
tion as to whether or not — well, first a question of whether
Congress intended to do mmy with appeals to an .Article III
court eventually on federal questions, and -QUESTION:

Well, is there anything in the language

of the Organic Act that would prevent the Guam Legislature front
withdrawing entirely the appellat© jurisdiction ©f the existing'
District Court?
MR. TRAPP:

I don’t think that there is anything in

the language of the Organic Act which prevents that, but I
think we are not — the government 3«ems to take some comfort
from the fact that thar© is no such language, but I think that
they are not talking about the real world, they are not talking
about the world that the Congress expected would obtain in

26
Guam and that is to say the world where invariably appeals is
a certain number of instances are always allowed by the legis­
lature.
QUESTION?

Judge

Kennedy read the wore, "determined,,"

as I understand his ©pinion? to mean that there is at least
some category of petit matters? small matters as to which there
need b© no appeal.
MR. TRAPP:

Of course? and the language in the Organic

Act does not say shall provide appeals in all cases? so deter­
mined means of course to roak© a rational decision of some sort
to make distinctions between cases ? those that may b® appealed
and those that may not b© appealed.
QUESTION:

You would say that means they can doter-

min© that there will be minor matters as to which there wibl be
no appeal? but they could not determine that there will b© no
appeals at all?
MR. TRAPP:

I am not saying that the language does

not say that there cannot be no appeals at all.

I -am simply

saying I can’t believe that Congress ever anticipated that
situation ever happening.
QUESTION:

Certainly your construction is not what

one weald call the plain meaning of the language that Judge
Stevens was asking about? is it?
MR. TRAPP:

As to Congress not contemplating never

doing away with all appeals?

27
QUESTI OK :

No, I mean as to th© part; of sect ion 22(a)

©n p&g© two of th© petitioner's brief which describas th©
original jurisdiction and says jurisdiction ©f th® District
Court — and than says jurisdiction.;, appellate jurisdiction
over which has not been transferred by th© legislature to
other courts or courts established by it ©ad shall have such
appellate jurisdiction as th© legislature may determine.
that to me sounds Ilk© carta blanch©.
MR. TRAPP:

Now,

Why isn't it?

Mr. Justice Rahnquist, ar@ you asking me

why couldn't they simply not ever provide for appeals?
QUESTION:

Why not read the statute literally, and

if on© does read it literally it sounds to me to give virtu­
ally unlimited authority to the Guam Legislature in this par­
ticular matter.
MR. TRAPP:

Oh, I roust respectfully disagree.

I

think that if we analyse -that language carefully, in the first
place if w® look at. th© first sentence, which says in what
courts th© judicial authority shall reside, but it doesn't say
what courts can be created.

How, if you look at fell© second

sentence; in fell© second sentence it says that original jurisdiction can be transferred, appellata jurisdiction can b© de­
termined, and I think we have to think of this in ;.i chrono­
logical and rational way.

There is no appellate jurisdiction

unless first there is some original jurisdiction which has
bean transferred.

So it seems to me that the plain language,

28
if we apply the plain language rule to this second sentence,
what Congress is saying is, look, we ar© going to have a
District Court of Guam, and that District Court of Guam is
going to have all jurisdiction and, of course, there will be
appeals to th© Ninth Circuit, to an Artie1© III court from
that District Court of Guam.
Now, it may be that th© Guam Legislature wants to
set up its own courts of original jurisdiction.
they can do that.

All right,

They can take this jurisdiction which is in

th© District Court of Guam and they can transfer it.
Well, what about appeals then?

Well, in that ©vent,

then an appellat© jurisdiction for th© District Court can be
determined and appeals can then go from these new courts of
original jurisdiction but these cases will nev©rt heles s go up
through the District Court., which is a craatur© of statute,
ar.d — os: Congress, rather —
QUESTION;

Ever, though the Guam Legislature deter­

mines that th© District Court will not have appellate juris­
diction?
HR. TRAPP;

Yes, but I don't think — I can't believe

that the Congress ever dreamt that the Guam Legislature would
simply say, well, we are gs;ing to create courts of original
jurisdiction but we will never have appeals from any of the
more important types? of cases.
QUESTION;

But you have appeal ‘to the Supreme Court

29
©f Guam.
MR. TRAPP;

We have an appeal to th© Supreme Court

of Guam now, but there is nothing in the language to suggest
that that was ever contemplated by th© Congress or that Congress
ever gave any express authority to indicate to the Guam Legis­
lature that it simply wanted to let go of the Guam judicial
system.
QUESTION;

Well, aren't you saying that when the

Congress said shall have appellate jurisdiction as the Legis­
lature, may determine, thay were saying that they will have some
appellate jurisdiction?
MR. TRAPP:

That th© District Court would have son®

appellate jurisdiction, that is all they are saying.
QUESTION;
MR. TRAPP;
QUESTION;

That is what I thought you were saying.
Yes, and that is all w© are saying.
In other words, it isn't a grant: of power

as under Article III of the federal Constitution to the Congress
of the United States, is that what you are saying?
MR. TRAPP:
QUESTION:

Not at all.

Not at all.

Wall, there is some dispute over what is

the scope of the congressional power as to Article III that
has never been finally resolved?
MR. TRAPP:
QUESTION:

That3 s righfc.
Mr. Trapp, help m© out;

Appellate Division of th© District Court?

What is this

30
MR. TRAPP:

Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, what 'the

Appellate Division, is is this:

Originally the Organic Act as

w© have just discussed said you could transfer original juris­
diction, that the legislature could determine what appellata
jurisdiction the District Court of Guam would have.

Now, th©

legislature -QUESTION:

No, physically what is ths Appellata

Division?
MR. TRAPP:
QUESTION:
MR. TRAPP:

All right.

The legislature —

is it mad© up of three judges or what?
It is three judges, and the way it hap­

pens to come about to he three judges is that a year after ths
Organic Act was enacted, th® Guam Legislature decided to determin® appellate jurisdiction in th® District Court and in doing
that it passed Public Law 17 which set up an Appellate
Division within th® District Court and it provided that there
would be three judges, not just the judge appointed by th®
President of the United States as th© judge of th© territorial
District: Court, of Guam, but two other judges originally to be
designated to sit in temporary status by the Chief Justice of
the United Statas.
Now, this was on the books for seme yearn when the
Congress apparently decided to recognise what th© Guam Legis­
lature had don® and enacted an amendment to the Organic Act
which I submit to this Court shows that the Congress only

31
intended for the District Court of Guam to have appellata
jurisdiction because if the Guam Legislature had the power to
simply creat® appellat® courts, then you could say, well, by
creating appellate division it created the appellate court.
But the Congress felt it was necessary to go a step further
and legitimize what th©v had done with further legislation,
even though what they had done was formalizing the procedure
within the framework of th® appellate jurisdiction which
Congress had expressly given to th© Guam Legislature, that is
to say th® jurisdiction to determine what appellate jurisdic­
tion that appellate court would have.
QUESTION:

Are th© other two judges territorial

judges?
MR. TRAPP:
QUESTION:
MR. TRAPP:

No.
What slot do they fit in?
They ar® now, they might be judges out

of th© Trust Territory, th© high court of th© Trust Territory
of th® Pacific Islands.

They might bs Unit©! States District

Court judges from an actual United States district.
QUESTION:
MR. TRAPP:

You mean within the Ninth Circuit?
Within the Ninth Circuit or conceivably

I suppose -QUESTION:
MR. TRAPP:
QUESTION:

Or outside?
— conceivably even outside, I believe.
In what tribunal is vested the traditional

32
probat® jurisdiction such as we have in the states?
MR. TRAPPs

The Superior Court* probate, domestic

relations matters ~~ when you say traditional, now everything
local has been transferred, which for many years the probat©
jurisdiction v?as in what, was called the Island Court of Guam,
which, is really no more than the predecessor of the Superior
Court, which is th© Island Court with an enlarged scope of
jurisdiction.
I might say that this is a very unusual thing that
Gen. Troutman is attributing to the Congress to say that in
effect the Guam Legislature can make the very highest tribunal
in Guam the highest appellate court, that is to say, for ®xampla, that the Guam Supreme Court is the plaything of the
legislature.

I think it vfould be very unusual to have a

system of government where the legislature could simply at any
moment abolish the Guam Supreme Court, change its jurisdiction,
effectively, fire the judges and have all new judges appoint®!,
for whatever political reason they might think fit.

And Guam

does have a record of — the Guam Legislature does have a
record, and I am presently a Senator of -that Legislature, but
I wasn't a part of ‘this scheme a few years ago whereby they
would switch the appointing power back and forth between the
Governor and the Legislature, depending upon who was in power,
and how it suited them.
S© if the Guam Supreme Court is to be upheld, I think

33

that I cari pretty well guarantee to this Court that it will
very definitely be the placing of the Legislature.

The

Constitutional Convention Act definitely has a great deal of
effect upon this present case because the language is different by far than what we find in th® present Organic Act»

It

is th© first time we find express authority to establish a
"system of local courts," and I don’t think we ar© reading
too much into that language "system of local courts” to think
of higher and lower courts.
that express language.

This is the first time we find

Congress didn't use it before.

If

Congress wished to delegate to the Guam Legislature in 1950
authority to establish a system of local courts, one might
think that they would have said so.

They have said so for the

first time in the Constitutional Convention Act.
Also we can see that Congress agrees that this
matter is certainly not put to rest, Congress has not yet let
go of the local judiciary, and this is definitely evidenced by
th© Constitutional Convention Act where Congress says that
sometime in the futere the Congress is still going to regulate
th© federal and local relationship.
QUESTION:

Well, in that sense Congress hasn't let go

of the federal courts either, has it?
MR. TRAPP:

No, it hasn't, but it is suggested right

now that Congress has already regulated that federal and local
relationship by simply saying to Guam -- and this is the

34
petitioner's position — saying to Guam, well, go ahaad, set
up whatever system you want.

But Congress says that, that re­

lationship still has to be regulated.
Now, again in the Agana Bay case, decided by the
Ninth Circuit, the majority said there is nothing to indicate
that Guam is incapable of establishing and operating its own
Appellate Court.

Well, I take exception to that, if I may,

and I think it is a consideration.
Gen. Troutman has said that a judge or justice of
the -- rathsr, a justice of the Superior Court must be a
lawyer.

Well, if that is so, it must be in legislation, that

has come about I believe since the Court Reorganization Act.
I am not sure that is so.
would stand corrected.

If he has authority for that, I

That was not my understanding.

But in any event, if a lawyer is appointed to the
Supreme Court of Guam, that lawyer need only have been admitted,
to practice six months before his appointment.
QUESTION:

Well, one need not be a lawyer to be

appointed to this Court, as you probably know.
MR. TRAPP:

That, might foe so, but when the Congress

originally considered setting up a Supreme Court of Guam and
keeping in mind that the appointing power to this Court is
vested in the President of the United States, as opposed to
the advice and consent of the Senate —
QUESTION:

Subject to the advice and consent of the

35
MR. TRAPP:
is

Yes.

In Guam what we are talking about

allowing the Guam Legislature,sometimes they do it them­

selves, in allowing the Governor, sometimes h® does it with
the advice and consent of the Guam Legislature, depending upon
what the Legislature wants to do with it at the time, to in
effect bring about a situation where justices will be appointed
who really have very low or no qualifications.
QUESTION:

Mr. Trapp, I just wonder, should we make

a presumption on© way or another as to whether Guam is capable
of self government, which presumption should we make, that it
is or that, it is not?
MR. TRAPP:

I think we should make th© presumption

that it is capable of self government but, on th® other hand,
we have a situation where I would agree on© hundred percent
•with the underlying notion of the petitioner’s case that Guam
should b® entitled to self-determination, self-determination
of the legislature, let the people of Guam, let them elect
their own representatives to make their laws? self-determination
in the executive, let us elect our own executive officer, after
all, we have to live with him day-to-day and he has very broad
powers.
But when we get to the judiciary, and who is actually
concerned about the judiciary, the people of Guam?

I suggest

not the people of Guam, really, generally, but litigants,
peoples who find themselves before the courts..

And I suggest

36

that really what we seed is not self-determination necessarily,
What we need is learning, what we need is experience,- and what
we need is impartiality, and I can tell you from my experience
in practicing in Guam for sixteen and a half years that if we
have a system where the chief justice sits on these cases- and
share offices and office space with the trial judges, where two
of the. trial judges along with the chief justice will sit in
judgment on their peers, as the way it has worked so far,
where you have a very small and tight-knit community of a
hundred and some-odd thousand, you are not. going to get im­
partiality .
QUESTION:

That is the way the Appellate Division of

the District Court works.

Don’t they sit in a panel of three

reviewing the decisions of one of the three?
MR. TRAPP:

It does work that way sometimes but only

when they are unable to get a United States District Court
judge.

Almost invariably they get a judge from the Trust

Territory and they get a United States District Court judge
from Hawaii or the mainland.
QUESTION:

But the procedure permits that to happen

in the District Court —
MR. TRAPP:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does.
— the very procedure you are. criticizing

in the other court.
MR. TRAPP:

Yes, it does, but the Guam Supreme Court

37

if you hava impartiality , if you lack impartiality in the
Appellate Division of the District Court, you still get
another bit© of the apple and that is you get off to the Ninth
Circuit.
QUESTION:
MR. TRAPP:

Is any of this in the record?
As to the representations I -am making to

the Court?
QUESTION:
MR. TRAPP:
QUESTION:

Yes.
No.

It is not because —

Well, how can I take your word against

the people of Guam who spoke through their Legislature, in­
cluding you?

Right?

MR. TRAPP:

How can I do that?
I don't think it is necessary because I

thank what I am really saying is none of us is here today to
decide whether Guam is ready for th© step, the ultimate ques­
tion in this case, because there is no evidence taken at the
trial court level on this point.

The only question of course

is on© of statutory construction.
QUESTION:

And there is nothing in the statute that,

prevents it, nothing, not one word that I could find.
MR. TRAPP:

Mr. Justice Marshall, th© problem is

that there is nothing in th© statute which authorizes it and
it is a uniform rule that a territorial legislature cannot do
what it is not authorised by th® Congress, because only what
the Congress --

38
QUESTION:

Where do you get, that from?

given broad authorization»

They are

The language of my Brother

Rehnquist was awful broad.
MR. TRAPP:

Well# I suggest to you that you simply

say that the Guam Legislature can determine what appellate
jurisdiction# the District Court will have, is not broad
authorization to go off and create other courts.

I submit to

you that it is a suggestion by the Congress that that would be
the limit of the power that the legislature would have to
create an appellate situation.
QUESTION:

What specifically in the Constitution

gives as authority to tell Guam that they can't do it?
thought the Constitution gave Congress that right.

I

I didn't

think it gave us the right.
MR. TRAPP;

Well # what we are her© today to do is to

try to decide whether Congress has done that or not.

The

Constitution tells Congress that it has plenary powers aver the
territories, it has complete control of the territories# and
because of that# a number of courts have held# that th© terri­
tories have ossly such power as is expressly delegate! by the
Congress to the territories.
QUESTION:

Well# if there is any doubt, who should it.

be in favor of?
MR. TRAPP:

Oh# it should definitely be in favor of

the Congress# the Congress retaining its powers, because th©

39

delegation has to be aa express one»
QUESTION;

Well, who speaks for the people of Guam?

MR. TRAPP;

Today before this Court I suppose that

the Attorney General is speaking for the people of Guam, but
QUESTION;

Well;, what legal argument do you give us

that say3 ha is wrong other than your argument that they will
go wild down there, whatever you want to say?
MR. TRAPP:

Wall, the legal argument I give you, Mr.

Justice Marshall, is the argument that I mad© whan I first
brought this up in the Agana Bay case, without getting into all
these other questions that w© are involved in today.

I simply

asked the District Court to read that statute, and it is th©
statute itself that is the basis of our argument, and a careful
reading of it I sufcsa.it to you does not give th® Guam Legislatore
the authority to transfer that jurisdiction or to create other
appellat® courts.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think you are using your

colleague’s time now.
MR. TRAPP;

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. F®r©nz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER S. FERENZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE GUAM BAR ASSOCIATION, AMICUS CURIAE
MR. FERENZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
I welcome the opportunity to carry on th© discussion

40

previously had with Mr. Trapp.

When the question was first

raised hera, I was equally shocked as Mr. Trapp, that there
would be no right of appeal in Guam, were this Court to affirm
and strike down th© Supreme Court, of Guam.

And I quite agree

with Mr. Trapp’s views on the subject matter of -chat very
point.
To answer Mr. Justice Marshall, I would say this,
that the Article IV, section 3 provision of the Constitution
which grants plenary power to the Congress to control th®
Territory of Guam is the authority that this Court needs.

I

suggest, and it has never been before this Court or any other
court so far as I know, that if Congress were to expressly
grant to Guam th® right to contain its own appeals, that that
might be construed as an invalid delegation by Congress of its
plenary powers.
QUESTIONj

Do you m«an if Congress were to authorize

Guam to have appeals to th© Supreme Court of Guam and no
further appeals to any Article III court, or did I misunder­
stand you?
MR. FEREN3:

Mo.

I suggest that that is an, argument

that could bs scholarly made.
QUESTION:

How would you reconcile that, with the

cases which you have cited in your brief on page 35 where
appeals from territorial courts, in the western states in th©
early days to this Court were limited to $2,000 or $3,000 in

41

amount?

In other words, if your controversy was not more than

$2,000 and you were appealing from the Supreme Court of
Washington, you. could not. get to an Article III court.
MR. FERENZs

The only thing that I can answer that

is that those provisions may have been invalid under that argu­
ment.

To develop the argument, let us review the elective

governor bill of Guam.

Before the elective governor bill, the

Governor of Guam was appointed by the President, and at that
time the laws of Guam ware subject to anuilmenfc by Congress
after on© year or within a one-year period.

Now, since the

elective governor bill has been in effect, Congress has expressly said we reserve the right to anuli any law of Guam.

In

affect, they have given Guam something but they have taken it
back.
So when we are talking about self-determination for
Guam, we are really not talking about self-determination in the.
true political sens©.
QUESTION:

Guam is an unincorporated —
Do you think Congress could nullify this

very statute?
MR. FERJ2NZ:

That’s correct.

Th<3 statement is very

clear and very precise.
Now, Guam was set up in the traditional sense of
three equal branches of government, and if we are to say that
th© Guam judiciary is without the control of Congress, that is
Congress says you may create your own judiciary and we have no

42
control over it, but we recognize that we have to control -the
laws of Guam in the executive branch, then I say that we do
not have an equal division of our branches of government.
QUESTION;

But. that is for Congress to decide and

determine.
MR. FERENZ;

That5s correct.

And I think by virtue

of tha elected governor provision may have determined that
self-determination for Guam is still a limited concept.
QUESTION;

Doesn’t that just mean that no matter how

we decide this case, tomorrow congress could change that de­
cision, whichever way we go?
MR. FERENZ:

Exactly, ani I intended to conclude my

remarks by suggesting to the Court that the most reasonable
thing to do is to leave matters status quo, that is as the
Ninth Circuit determined it.

W© will have a court system that

has proven itself over the past, the Ninth Circuit has played
an important part in the laws of Guam and its progress.
QUESTION;
status quo her®.

But there is a question of what is the

The Ninth Circuit upset tha status quo.

MR. FERENZ;
Reorganisation Act.

By status quo, I mean before the Court
What I am saying is if the Court were to

affirm, wa would have an orderly process for litigants to take
appeals in important casae to the Ninth Circuit, and Congress
will have an opportunity as it stated before in the CONCON
Act or in some other later time to seriously conside,: the basis

43
for Guam’s judiciary and self-determination.
QUESTION:

How far is it geographically fran Guam to

the west coast of the United States?
MR. FERENZ:

Well? it is about 9,000 miles — to the

west coast?
QUESTION:
MR. FERENZ:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Six thousand miles.
Excuse me.

The west coast of the United

States is Hawaii.
QUESTION:

I am talking about the Ninth Circuit

Court of Appeals, which generally -MR. FERENZ:
QUESTION:

It is about 6,000 miles, about 14 hours,,
About 6,000 miles.

How many lawyers are

there in Guam?
MR. FERENZ:

About fifty lawyers in private practice

plus government attorneys.
QUESTION:

And the total population again, a hundred

and some-odd -MR. FERENZ:

100,000 roughly.

But bear in mind that

the Ninth Circuit sits every year in Hawaii and they have sat
ones in Guam, and we understand the indications are that they
will go back.
QUESTION:
MR. FERENZ:

Now I would think they would.
In conclusion, I can't add any more, but

I think this Court is taking a proper step in reviewing the

44
matter and should take it to Congress.

1 have said in the

amicus brief that I feel that the language that has been used
is unfortunate,

it really hasn’t clarified anything for us.

I agree with Justice Rehnquist.

When I first read

the statute, when my brother at the bar first took his attack
at it, I was wondering why he was taking it.
me to ba so self-evident.

It just seemed to

But if you reread it and consider

it with the legislative material that wa have at the beginning
of Guam5s organic history, then it becomes clear to me that we
don’t have a mandate frcsn Congress that Guam could do what it
wants.
QUESTIONS

Perhaps no one over on the other side of

the avenue here read it before they enacted this statute.
MR. FEREHZ:

I think that is entirely possible.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.
