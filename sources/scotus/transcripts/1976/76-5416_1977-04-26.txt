MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-5416, Jones against Hildebrant.

Mr. Rees, you may proceed whenever you8re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID K. REES, ESQ.,
ON BEIIALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
I am David Reas.

I represent the petitions* in this

case. Ruby Jones.
In 1973, Ruby Jonas filed a complaint in the Denver
District Court in which she alleged that Douglas Hildebranfc,
Brian Moran, and the City and County of Denver, as respondeat
superior, had killed her son. Larry by shooting him in the back
e f the head.
Brian Moran, was subsequently dismissed from that
suit, at the end of discovery.

The action proceeded against

just Officer Ilildebrant and the City and County of Denver.
Her complaint stated three claims;

first, battery?

second, negligence — both of these claims were properly
brought under the Colorado Wrongful Death Act, and are
controlled by Colorado lav/.

The third claim was brought

pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983, and is a federal claim.
At the close of the evidence — well, first of all,
in answer to this complaint, Ilildebrant and the City said

4
— they admitted that Hi3.debrant shot Larry Jones intentionally ,
and that he v/as acting under color of State law when he did so,
They alleged, however, -QUESTION %

This was during the course of what kind

of activity that he was shot?
MR. REES;

The record is silento But, in fact, the

record below would show that officer nildebrant was responding
to a call of a silent burglar alarm, and that he was pursuing
Larry Jones, who was allegedly committing a burglary.
As a result, Hildebrant alleged that he was acting
in self-defense, and he also alleged that Larry Jones was a
fleeing felon, and that tin© shooting was justified on that
ground.
But the jury rejected both of those defenses.
At the close of the evidence, the defendants moved
to dismiss Mrs. Jones' claim under 1933 on the grounds that
it was redundant with her State claim.
QUESTION:

Of course, did the complaint mention

1903?
MR. REES:

Yes, specifically.

QUESTION: And what was the claim, thp constitutional
claim?
MR. REES;

The constitutional claim on Mrs. Jones®

behalf, and it’s her claim, is founded in — you
it two different ways;

can look at

first, this Court, has held on several

occasions that a parent, has a constitutional right to raise
their child - and that that child cannot be taken from them
without, the due process of law.

So in Armstrong vs0 Man20

and in idle Stanley case, this Court held that the State could
not deprive a parent of their parental rights without meeting
the guidelines of the Fourteenth Amendment.
And in the Meyer vs. Nebraska case *—
QUESTION: Where could I find your complaint in the
record, do you know?
MR. REES:

It’s in the —

QUESTION:

In tiie Appendix.

Is it right there at

pages 1, 2, and 3 of the Appendix?
MR. REES:

Yes, it is.

QUESTION;

And your third claim is down in paragraph

10, is that it?
MR. REES:

Yes. Ana particularly paragraph

QUESTION: And vhere is the 1983 — you say it’s just
under the constitution?
1 take it, you -MR. REES:
QUESTION:

Yes, v/e allege the elements of 1983.
Yes.

Yes?, And I take it tnat :■ t wee

understood to be a 19 83 -~
MR. REES:

Oh, yes, it has been treated

so at all

timer? in the course of the proceeding by the district court
and by the Colorado Supreme Court.

5

QUESTION; And I take it that -- you state it both
ways here, either she is suing on behalf of her son or on her
own behalf, either way.
MR. REES:

Well, we drafted it that way.

QUESTION:

Yes. So which one are you pushing new?

MR. REES:

Rut what we — it has now become clear,

after four years, that it is her right, that it would b©
improper fox* her to sue on behalf of her son’s right.
QUESTION: Well, then, if you’re right there, we were
wrong in turning down

Gary Gilmore’s mother’s petition for a

stay, weren’t we?
MR. REES:

No.

And the reason for that is this:

Gary Gilmore had rights of his own, as Judge Lewis in -the
Tenth Circuit stated the morning he was killed.

Gary Gilmore

was given every due process of law.
QUESTION:

Well, he didn’t — his mother didn’t

think he was.
MR. REES:

That’s right.

But his mother had no rights that were deprived thsro.
QUESTION:

Well, —

MR. REES:

In other words, let me try and make the

distinction•

A mother does not have the right not to have

her son killed; a mother does have

the

Stats official wrongfully kill her son.
dis tinction

right not fco have a
And that’s the

7
Every

possible due process was afforded -to Gary

Gilmore* and he, an adult, chose not to file any further papers
in this Court,

And Judge Lewis said, this man has rights too?

and here the mother, with no real standing, just tried to come
in and save her son’s life.
And I think that’s a significant distinction,
QUESTIONs

Mr, Rees, let me follow through on

Justice White's question,

I think the printed Appendix is

confusing, because you printed the

Amended Complaint and the
>

Answer to the Original Complaint, which is not printed.

And

the things don't fit together.
Did the original complaint cite

mention 1983 in

so many words?
MR, REES;

The Original Complaint and the Amended

Complaint are essentially the same, the difference being that
a fourth claim for relief was
QUESTION: Well, that isn’t essentially the same,
certainly.

Of course it’s a difference,
MR. REESs

Y©s.

QUESTION:

That’s why I’m confused when I read the

Answer to the Original Complaint and then try to fit it into
the Amended Complaint,
I’m asking:

Is 1983 mentioned in the original

complaint?
MR. REES:

Yes.

3
QUESTION!

And I take it, fch© answer is no.

HR, REES;

Mo, it is.

You mean specific

statutory citation, Your Honor?
QUESTION;

That’s what I mean.
1

MR* REES;

I think it was.

I may be wrong about

that.
QUESTION; Well, if it was, why isn’t it mentioned in
the Amended Complaint?
MR © REES;
pled the elements.

I think we just, un.de r fact pleading,
But there was no question at any point

on any of the party’s parts that this was a 1983 complaint.
QUESTION;
MR. REES:

Is that good pleading?
It’s probably not as good as it might

have been, but under fact pleading, I do think it is certainly
sufficient; and there was no question about notice here.
All the parties understood that this was a 1983 complaint.
QUESTION;

And what was the

a 1983 is a statute

that allows civil recovery for the deprivation of any rights,
privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and
laws of the United States.
MR. REES;

And what was the theory here?

The theory here is that a mother —■ and

I can get this two different ways:

first of all, that a moth®:

has a right to not have her child taken, whether by court
proceeding or by bullet, by a State official.
QUESTION;

Why? What provision of the Constitution o:

9

federal law?
MR. REES :

It, would be the due process clause.

Meyer vs. Nebraska, they talked about the term

In,

liberty” and

they construed liberty to include the liberty to raise
children.
QUESTION:

Well, now, you mean that this person who

was killed should have been given a hearing before he was
shot?

Is that what you mean?
MR. REES:

No, he shouldn't have been shot at all.

QUESTION; Well, no, he shouldn't as a matter of
State tort and criminal law, but what in the United States
Cons iituition protected either him or his mother from that?
MR. REES:

The Fourteenth Amendment.

QUESTION: Well,, what part of it?
MR. REES:

The part that you shall not be deprived

of. life or liberty, *■—
QUESTION:
MR. REES:

Yes.
—- without the due process* of law.

QUESTION:

This was life, wasn't it?

MR. REES;

Well, as to Larry, it was his li fe.

QUESTION:
MR. REES:
QUESTION:

Yes.
As to Mrs. Jones, it was her liberty.
Yes. Arid what was the constitutional

violation with respect to either one?
MR. REES:

The constitutional violation 'was the

10

Infringement of her rights as a parent.
QUESTION;

To what?

MRo REES s

To raise her child.

QUESTION;

But where do you find that In the

Cons fcitution?
MR. REES;

Well, for example,

QUESTION;

The due process clause

I thought

perhaps you were saying that there should have been a hearing
accorded before ha was shot.
MR. REES;

Well, in answer to Justice Rehnquist’s

question, you know, had there been a hearing and the death
penalty imposed after a criminal case had been filed against
him, a hearing would have precluded a suit.

But I'm not

saying that they should have held a hearing before they
wrongfully shot. larry in. the back, of the head*
QUESTION:

Well, what constitution&l deprivation

MR. REES:

The constitutional deprivation was the

was tliere?

deprivation to raise *—
QUESTION; Well, .where do you —
MR. REES;

Just as in my —

QUESTION: First

of all, you're referring, I suppose,

to tli® Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. REES;

To the Fourteenth Amendment.

QUESTION; Begin with that. And now, what in the

II
Fourteenth Amendment?

You5 re talking about equal protection

of the laws here,
MR» REES:

What?

QUESTION: Equal protection»
MR, REES:

Yes»

QUESTION:

Do you rely on that?

MR» REES:

We are not, we8 re relying on the word

liberty" primarily.

53

QUESTION:

Because ycur complaint talks about

equal protection? you*va abandoned that, have you?
MR» REES:

Yes.

When we drafted the complaint,

and I can explain that — Officer Hildebrant is white, Larry
Jonas was black, we thought there might be a problem there
when we drafted the complaint»

In the course of discovery

we decided that the equal protection claim was not well
founded, but that file deprivation of —
QUESTION:

Because he had shot white people, too?

MR» REES:

No»

But we did not feel we had a case

that we could show —
QUESTION: Well, what do you feel — what is your
case now, based upon the Federal Constitution or the federal
law?
MR* REES i

Our federal case is that: you cannot take

— you cannot take a child’s life.
directly on that point.

And there’s a case

12

QUESTION:

I understand, but that’s protected by

State law, criminal and negligence law0
MR. REES:
Fourteenth Amendment,

No, it’s also protected under the
fed the Eighth Circuit has held

specifically on that, with identical facts.

Mattis vs. Schnarr.

In Mattis vs. Schnarr, Mattis was a doctor whose son
was killed by a local police officer who was chasing young
Mattis and fired a so-called warning shot teat hit him in the
head and killed him.
QUESTION;
MR. REES:

Unh-hunh.
And Mattis, the father, brought a suit

under 1983» and tee Missouri Court held that that was proper.
There are other cases with similar facts that are
cited in the brief, Perkins vs. Salafia.
QUESTION:

And what

MR. REES:

Perhaps I can — excuse me. Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, it's still not clear to me what

provision of tee United States Constitution you're relying on.
MR. REES:

The Fourteenth Amendment, in precisely

what protects — the right to liberty would be the key word,
it is the sane part of tee Constitution that protected the
plaintiffs in never vs. Nebraska, and that protected the
plaintiffs in Stanley vs» Illinois.
QUESTION:

Those are two different kinds of — in

Mayer vs, Nebrafea, though, the State courts of Nebraska could

13
have he.Id all the hearings they wanted to in the world, and
they still wouldn't have been allowed to do what they tried
to do in that case*
MR* REES;

That's right*

QUESTION: So that's kind of a substantive type
liberty as opposed to the kind of procedural type liberty that
I thought you were talking about.
MR* REES;
liberty;

Ho, I'xr. talking about very substantive

nor being shot in the back of the head*

Or having

your son shot in the back*
QUESTION;

But you've conceded ~ I don't mean

conceded, but don't, you agree that, given a suitable statute '
on the books and a proper trial and hearing and so forth,
that a State could put someone to death?
MR * REES:

Oh, yes*

QUESTION: So it's not an absolute prohibition, the
way it is in Meyer*
MR* REES:

That's correct.

But you must look. T

think, to whether there is a right that it finds protection*
Okay.

And the answer to that is that, you do have a. right in

y-.mr children*

It is one of tee very essentials of life.

And that's what has been held in the whole series of cases
that I argued — perhaps if I can explain the background of —

15

QUESTION:
MR. REES:

You don't: allege that in your complaint.
And unless all of those elements are

met, then the plaintiff can't recover.
Perhaps I can put this in historical perspective and
make it clearer.
Courts have held traditionally that the Civil Rights
Acte are deficient on the issue of standing to bring suite.
And there are several court decisions, Brazier vs. Cherry is
probably the leading one? and there is also a footnote in
Moor vs. County of Alameda, that you can look at State law
on the issue of standing.

And that where the State has a

wrongful death statute, which provides an independent right
in the survivor, that that will give them standing under IS83.
And that was one of the things pointed out in Mattis vs.
Schnarrr and Colorado does have such a statute.
And so Mrs. Jones properly did bring the suit.
QUESTION:

Well, now you're talking about the State

And the only

MR. REES:

Well, I had said initially that there

were two ways in which you could view -this as it being proper

Mr. Justice Stewart has already,

several times, pointed out that no one is questioning, and
none of our questions are addressed to the problem of the
right to recover under Colorado Stats law for the wrongful

deathr if it can be shown.
HR. REES:

Yes .

QUESTION?

The questions are addressed to the right

f.o recover under to© federal statute.
MR. REES:
QUESTION:

That’s true.
But you now concede that the automobile

killing would not be the same as the shooting.
MR. REES:

Correct.

QUESTION: And is the only distinction toe intent?
MR. REES:

Yes.

One would be ~ and if they

intentionally drove their automobile into the back of Larry's
car and killed him, then a 1983 action would be proper.
QUESTION: Well, it would be just as easy to allege
that with respect to an automobile as it would with respect
to a gun, wouldn’t it?
MR. REES:

Certainly.

As an attorney I try to sign pleadings toat reflect
the facts as I see them.
In this case, officer Ifildebrant admitted that he
shot him intentionally.
case.

Negligence was never an issue in this

And if he had said,, “I tripped while I was chasing him

and the gun went off**, to at would have been a — certainly
a defense to a 1983 claim.

But. that just wasn't what happened

here.
What happened here was that he shot toe kid in toe

17

kid in the back of the head.
QUESTION; Why did you say a little while ago that
you thought that after — that you realized, after two or
three years, -that the mother had to be suing in her own right?
MR. REES;
QUESTION;

Well, we thought ~
Could she sue, or does Colorado law

permit, or does 19 83 permit a mother to sue to recover on
behalf of her son, as sort of a survivor, on survivor’s —
MR. REES;.

Undey 3 cheuer vs. Rhodes - yes, survivor­

ship action would be proper.
The problem we had ~~
QUESTION; Well, why do you say that *— why . do you
say here, then, that the mother couldn't proceed on that basis?
MR. REES;

Well, in hindsight,she could have.

But that would have been, first oi aij., a difit»rent
claim. That would have bean a claim for Larry's rights and
not for her rights.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. REES;

That's one.

QUESTION?
MR. REES;

Two, —

And what’s wrong with that?
Well, the problem with us was that at

the time that there was a case, there was a case, Perkins ys.
S alg.fi a *—
QUESTION:
MR, REES;

Oh, a Colorado case.
No, it is not, it's a federal district

18

court case and it comes from Connecticut»
And I think it hag since been overruled, not
directly but in light of other decisions» But it said
specifically you couldn't do that»
QUESTION:

Under 1983?

MR. REES;

Under 19 83.

It said only where you've

get ~~ only if there’s a wrongful death action, so that the
mother can bring the action in her own name, will we permit
that suit»
And in view of -the Perkins case, and in view of the
cases that said it was proper to posture the case as we had
postured it, we chose to posture it that way. We could have
postured it either way, because Colorado had both statutes.
And simply because of the Perkins case, we chose to plead it
the way we did.
Four years ago I would posture it both ways to protect
myself and to try to recover even additional damages on behalf
of L cry; but that's hindsight.
QUESTION;

Well, how doss

on what basis did the

Colorude; Sup rams Court judge the case?
MRo REES:

The Colorado Supreme Court said, one,

Ruby Jor.es would have had no standing at all unless you look
to tiis Colorado wrongful death statute.

And if you're going

to utilize the Colorado wrongful death statute on the issue
of standing, you must incorporate its remedy as well.

The

19

theory there is that where the federal lav? is silent on an
issuey you look to State law to fill the gap,»
And we would argue that even if you look to the
Colorado statute to give Mrs» Jones standing to bring this
suit, there is no gap with respect to the remedies.
So the Colorado court held that if we had filed a
1983 action in federal court, that the net pecuniary less rule
under Colorado law would have been engrafted onto — and
that’s their language -- our claim in federal court.
And so they said -that tire Colorado rule of damages
could govern a claim brought under the federal statute.
QUESTION: And so ‘they said the 1983 action in the
Stats:?, court didn’t survive at all.
MR. REES:

It wasn't a matter of survival, but ---

QUESTION:

It was that: they merged it.

MR. REES:

They merged it.

It was simply the same

measure of damages es if —
QUESTION:

So they just said it isn’t really any

different, it isn’t a separate cause of action at all,
MR. REES:

That because it has the same measure of

damages, it would be duplicitous, and there’s no need to
instruct: the jury on both of them.
And that was the whole basis of their ruling and
the reason why we petitioned for certiorari.
Perhaps if I can answer your question, Justice

20

Blackmun, in another' ways

Given that decision as it stands

now, if I were to file another suit in Colorado on behalf of
you know, in a different case, on behalf of Larry, then
the Colorado limitations on recovery for survivorship statutes
~ I'm not sure exactly what they are *— would also apply and
would govern the federal law*
And what they've dona here is they've restricted a
statute,■ where the very purpose of that statute was to provide
a remedy supplemental to a State remedy*
QUESTION: Well- but. if you're talking about any
person injured, you have the choice of your theory as to
Larry's mother, which you were urging earlier, as an independent
conshitutional violation *
MR. REES:

Yes.

QUESTION:

But if you're trying to recover damages

for the injury or death of Larry, then you've get to get a
survivorship statute somewhere I would think.
MR* REES:

I agree,

we have not alleged damages on

Larry's behalf in this suit, nor do the damages that we seek -QUESTION:

In loss of income to his mother, basically*

Or loss of support.
MR. REES:

Well, loss of income is covered under

the Colorado net pecuniary loss rule, and that would he
covered in tlx© $1500 that Was awarded by the jury*
seek double recovery for that.

We don't

federal common law that, governs 19 03 action# ~QUIJSTION:

Now# what's your authority for saying

that federal common lav/ governs 19 83 action?
MR. REES:

Probably the leading case is Basis fee vs.

Weir.
QUESTION;

Is that a case in this Court?

MR. REES:

No# that's a Third Circuit case.

QUESTION:

Has this Court ever spoken on the subject?

MR. REES:

This Court has not used the words

I

"common law" to my knowledge.

However# in Sullivan vs. Little

Hunting Park# where the Court was dealing with a case that
came under 1981 but# like 1983# is governed by 42 U.S.C. 1938
on -the damage issue# -the Court said that the measure

of

damages can be drawn from either federal or State sources# but
the,

smedy is a federal remedy and responsive to where a

federal right has bean infringed.
And this makes sense, the federal common lav; should
govern this action# for two reasons:
First of all# federal common lav? traditionally
applies to the enclaves of law that are of specific federal
concerns

And, given the history

QUESTION;

The difference between federal —

between common law and statutory lav; is what?
HR. REES;

Well, the common lav/ can *— the federal

MR. REES:

It’s construction of the statutes, of

s aying.

the. 19 88; that’s right.
But, on occasion, -die courts have gone quite beyond
the statute. For example, in Shaw vs. Garrison, the Louisiana
— if was a federal court in Louisiana, as a matter of
federal common law, said that the action could survive even
though there was no federal survivorship statuta, and even,
though, under Louisiana lav/, the action would have died.
QUESTION:

I’m still trying to find the federal law

that gives a survivorship right to the mother.
MR. REES:

Excuse me?

QUESTION:

The State — the federal law that gives

a survivorship right of action to the mother.
MR. REES:

Well, the right of action is through 1983,

and the cons fcifcutional —

To the mother?

HR„ REES:

That’s right. And the constitutional

I wouldn’t go so far as to say any kind

teacher beats her son in school, I don’t think that would give
rise necessarily to a 19 03 action.
QUESTION:

Why not?

Under your theory.

MR. REES:

Well, I was alluding particularly to.the

Court’s recent decision.
QUESTION: Well, doesn’t a mother have a liberty for
her child not to be spanked by anybody but her?
MR. REES:
not have that liberty

I guess not, Your Honor.

No.

that is:

The defendants imply that perhaps we would have had a different

brought in the State court.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr» Rees .

Mr. Doan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WESLEY II. DOAN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DOAN:

Mr. Chief Justi.ce and members of the

Court:
If the Court please, I have had the same difficulty
in trying to respond to this case from the very inception

of

the petition in this matter, and I think it?s extremely
important at this stage of the proceeding' that the factual
situation that existed in this case be corrected.
The plaintiff has alleged that this was an intentional
shooting in the back of the head, and perhaps, if any error
was made? by the Colorado Supreme Court in this matter, it was
in likewise making that statement that it was admitted that
the plaintiff was intentionally shot in the back of the head.
What the court should have said was that it was
admitted that the police officer intentionally shot at the
plaintiff, the net result of which was that he was killed.
The fact is, as was found by Judge Goldberg at the
trial court level, and as is indicated on page 30 of the
Appendix in this matter, in part at least, and as is in our
answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall [sic],
the facies were that, as Judge Goldberg indicated end the true
facts before the jury decided were that the police officer is

27

driving down the street and sees the shadow of a figura in a
lighted Day Care Center.» which is a building provided in the
area where it existed for mothers to bring their children
during the daytime so they could work»
Upon seeing this, and a silent burglar alarm,, the
officer exited his vehicle, went to the side of the building
and his partner drove the police car down the street, turned
up another street and was going to proceed back down the alley
in order to provide cover at the back of the building»

The

officer, in fact, then saw this party in the building jump
/

out the building almost on 'top of him* in an area where it was
lighted.

This boy at that time was six foot tall and about

200 pounds .

The officer observed him, after demanding that hsi

halt, instructing him to halt, run from him*
?3 Judge Goldberg indicated, perhaps, in taking the
case in the bast light available bo the plaintiff, he should
have determined what was in his hand* And therefore a jury
question wr-.s presented*
The fact was, to which Judge Goldberg refers, is
that the officer testified that, he saw, as this large figure
is running from an area of lightness into darkness, into an
area of a paved alley to an area of rubble, that there was *
gleam of metal in the hand of the boy, that he thought, in
his mind -- this was unrefuted ~~ that this person who was
running from him has a gun in his hand and was going to shoot

28

QUESTION:

That’s all very interesting, counsel , but

this is the jury case that's already been decided, isn't it?
MR. DOAN:

It certainly is , Your Honor. And it was

decided upon the issues of whether cr not, under those circumstances, the officer was negligent,,
QUESTION;

Well, and a decision was

MR. DOAN:

It goes along with your question earlier —

QUESTION:

Yes, but the decision was adverse to you,

was it not?
MR. DOAN:

It was, Your Honor.

QUESTION; And you did not bring that question here,
did you?
MR. DOAN:

Well, I was satisfied with the judgment

rendered by the. court and the jury below.
Getting from that factual situation to what I truly
believe is the issue before this Court is, and that is whether
or not the damages in this case were inadequate.

And the

only way that you could get at that is the asking by the
plaintiff or the petitioner her© to rule that the wrongful
death damage rule of Colorado was unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

You say this was submitted as a negligence

c&s® to the jury?
MR. DOAN:

It was, Your Honor.

The instructions

were submitted to the jury on negligence and also as to whether

29

or not- in effect., it was an excessive us© of force under those
circuit® tances.
Th© issue that's now before the Court, as I see it,
is vary simple. The petitioner is asking that there be two
rules of damage that, exist in Colorado:

one, that although it

is not specifically pl©d„ 1983, that w© pled the elements,
and -the court said
words.

and perhaps again there was a mistake of

If it were a true 19 83 claim, it would not merge with

any State claim, it. would stand on its own.
QUESTION:
MR. DO AM:
QUESTION;

Where
And then ----Where did th© court say that?

In the

Appendix?
MR. DOAN:
QUESTION

•

Pardon me?

I'm saying this.

Do you have nr. Appendix reference?

Well, you're telling us what th® court said, I thought.
MR. DOAM:

Mo, I'm saying if the court made a

mistake, it used the word "merge", Your Honor.
QUESTIONS
MR. DOAN:

0ho
Or it used the word --- I believe our

Colorado Supreme Court used the word, that it would be
"'engrafted" upon th© Colorado Wrongful Death Act.
I'm saying that the Colorado Wrongful Death Act,
stood on its own in this case, and it provided all of the
things that this Court said th®. person would be entitled to if

3Q

they had a claim that existed under 1983.
The Court, in Monroe, provided that it would have -there would be four purposes of 'that case, and that would be
to provide a remedy to declare that there were any unconstitu­
tional State laws, to override those unconstitutional State
laws•

And I cannot determine, from the way this case is

framed, whether or not the peti.tJ.oner is asking the Court to
declare the Colorado Wrongful Death Act end the Colorado
rule: of damages in that case unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Well, as I understand the Colorado

Supreme Court,. it accepted the fact that there could be, or
that it would entertain a 1933 action for the wrongful death
of the :?or., —
MR. DOAN:
QUESTIONs

That’s correct.
-- but that the Colorado damage limita­

tions would apply to it.
MR. DOAN:

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

And if — let’s assume that the only

causa of action that had been pleaded here in the complaint
was a 1983 cause of action.

The Colorado Supreme Court, T

take it, would have held that the Colorado courts entertain,
that cause of actionf but that the Colorado Wrongful Death
statute limitations apply to it, and you would have had the
same result.
MR. DOAN:

That is absolutely correct.

31

QUESTION:

Now, if that*s the — would you have

thought the Colorado Supreme Court: would have made a legal
error if the case had come to it in ‘that posture, and it had
decided just what it did?
MR. DOAN:

It would have made no difference at all,

if Your Honor please, and the result would have been exactly
the same.
If every circuit case which dealt — most of -them
dealt with survival, that's cited by the appellant in this
case, were applied, the result would also os the same.
QUESTION: Well, do you suggest that.

I know you

must *— you probably support tha Colorado Supreme Court's
ruling that the Colorado damage limitation applies.
MR. DOAN:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

QUESTION: But do you — are you arguing here that
no 19 83 action was pleaded at all, no valid action was pleaded
at all?
MR. DOAN:

I believe that it was not validly pleaded,

th at8 s co r re ct •
QUESTION:
MR. DOAN:

All sight.

Now, why is that?

Because it does not set forth a claim for

anything other than the mother’s denial of what she terms as
her right to raise her child.

And that that does not rise to

the level of what would constitute a constitutional claim.
QUESTION:

Now, apparently the Colorado Supreme Court

32

didn’t, rule that way, did it?

It didn’t

MR. DO/\N:

Colorado —

QUIJSTIONs

It didn’t proceed on that basis.

MR. DOAN;

Th© Colorado Suprams Court agreed with

*

the -trial court that,regardless of what you called it, line
net result is going to be the same, in effect.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION: Well., formerly, though, didn’t the trial
court dismiss th© 1983 claim?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. DOAN:

At the conclusion of all of the evidence

in th® case, it did dismiss what was referred to —
QUESTION:

Well, then your Supreme Court —• if I

read the opinion at page 49 of the Appendix correctly —
"However, because the instant suit was brought in state court
and joined with a suit under the state wrongful death
statute, th© trial court properly ruled that the two actions
weife merged so 'that the 1983 claim should be dismissed.M
MR. DOAN:

That's right.

QUESTION:

So doss it coma here as a case in which

the 1983 claim has been dismissed?
t

MR. DOAN:

Yes, it does. Your Honor, and that's the

way it!s before the Court.
QUESTION:

Well now, does the petition for certiorari

present the question whether or not the action in dismissing

33

the 1983 claim should b® reviewed?

Looking at the questions

presented at page 2 of the brief of the petitioner, this seems
to assume that the 1983 action was sustained;, because the
damages were erroneously — the standard of dfimages ? am I
wrong?
MRo DOAN:

In answer to that question, if Your Honor

please, it's my belief that the only thing that*3 before this
Court is

'her. / plea that the damages in the case are

inadequate,
QUESTION: Well, how do they get here if, as it gets
here, wa have a judgment dismissing the 19 83 claim?

How do.

wa get tothe issue of damages under 1983?
MR, DOAN:

I frankly do not know how w© got here on

that issue, because the only issue framed, as it now comes
back in the reply brief, is the issue that the damages a::©
inadequate, and the wrong measure of damages was used,
QUESTION:

Wall, in his questions presented in the

petitioner’s brief, not very articulately but at least it’s
arguable

that’s at page 2 of the white brief — arguab 1©

that he is challenging the constitutionality of the limit
which the action of the State court placed on a 1983 action?
that is, applying the Colorado Wrongful Death Act limit, as
Justice White earlier suggested, to a 1983 action.
Now, what do you — can the question, presented be
read that way?

\

34
Or do you still say that he’s just complaining about
the quantum of damages?
MRo DOAN:

I still believe. Your Honor, that that is

in fact that the question that he has attempted to raise

in

this Court, regardless of how he wishes to label it®
QUESTION:

The 1983 action was dismissed in the trial

MR. DOAN:

Yes, Your HOncr.

QUESTION:

-— and that was never appealed;

court, —

MR. DOAN:
QUESTION;

It was net.
— and so it’s out of the case. Asad I

don't quite see, therefore, how this question can arise.
MR. DOAN: The 1983 action was dismissed because ihe
trial court says:

You have available to you a completa

remedy under the Colorado Wrongful Death law.
a

Now, our trial court was a little more astute than
that, it went one step further end said; "Under 1983, where I
can find no federal right of action to exist, no right of
survival to exist, I am directed to look to 1988; and when
I look to 1988, 1988 tells ms that I don’t find any federal
rule for the measure of damages in a wrongful death action

)

because there is no such federal action..

Again I must look

to -the State rule.
"And to got to that rule, the closest State tort
would be wrongful death.

ThorSore, I’m applying the wrongful

35

death damage rule of the Stats of Colorado, which is the
nearest, closest thing, and which I5m directed by the court
to do."
They cite, for instance, Brazier, which I know that
[If]

Mr. Justice Marshall is familiar with. /This case had been
tried in that court at that time, the result would be exactly
the same.

Because in that case-, the court went to 1988 to

find a way to have the action survive, and said it should then
look to Georgia law and adopt the Georgia law, and if we said
it was Colorado lav/ that had to be applied, they would have
found the same measure of damages in this case in that case»
And the only thing that I can say before the Court
is that it seems to me, and the attempt to evaluate this
matter, that really what they're talking about is the damages
are inadequate and we want a special rule of damages to be
created, where we can punish police officers.
QUESTION; Well, let me back up again to this question,
presented.

If we take this to be the question presented to

this Court,"can the State measure of damages cancel and
displace an action brought pursuant to 1983?"
Nov/,his 1983 action was dismissed, as several members
of the Court have pointed out.
MR. DOAN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; And there was no review of that by the
Supreme Court of Colorado, was there?

MR. DOAMs

Wall, they referred to it.
*

QUESTION3 Well, did the Supreme Court — 1911 put
it -this way;

Tell me what you think the Supreme Court of

Colorado said, other than what they said in that short
paragraph on page 48 about it being engrafted — what did
they say about the dismissal?

Did they affirm the dismissal,

or did they evade the question?
MR. DOANj

They only — that’s all they said, that

it'Was engrafted upon, because, in fact,the rule of damages
in the case would be exactly the same, by whatever name you
called it.

Whether you call if. wrongful death or by 19 83,

you always get to the same rule of damages.
QUESTION: Well, the dissent of Chief Justice Pringle
and Justice Groves would tend to support you.

They are saying

that "I do not believe that Colorado’s judicial limitation of
net loss as a measure of damages for wrongful death appli.es
to actions under 1983.”
Well, that’s the way, at least, the dissenters read
the Court’s opinion.
Then, is that question here at all?
MR. DOAN:

I can’t see how it is, Your Honor, because,

as I interpret the sum and substan.ee of the petition, the
brief, the reply brief, the issue is that damages were
inadequate find, in effect, saying we didn’t get enough because
you limited us to net pecuniary loss.

37

And I don’t sea how that issue is before the Court?
because our Colorado Supreme Court said;

We have followed that

rule for years? wa follow it in this case? that is the rule?
it’s the majority rule in wrongful death cases in the United
States.
And? I believe? Your Honor? Mr. Chief Justice? if I
may refer -to Idle Aopendix, at page 43 of the Appendix? Mr.
Justice Hodges, in ruling upon the case, defined it this way;
!,Shs appeals from -this judgment solely on the damage issue."
It would appear to me that the majority in the case
and the dissent in the case considered it that way, and I
respectfully submit to the Court that that is exactly the
only issue that is before this Court.
And if I may say, in conclusion, the petitioner is
asking the Court to create something which this Court, I feel,
has clearly indicated does not exist,, -and that’s a federal
common lav; rule of damages*
In this case, what would happen if the director of
that Day Care Center was in the building at the same time as
the officer, they both fired simultaneously, they both fired
a fatal shot?

Under the petitioner’s request here, there

would be a special rule of damages, which he says this Court
should creata, I guess, under 1983, that would take away all
of the other aspects of the Colorado Wrongful Death statute.
QUESTION:

Could you help ms a minute in the Appen-

38
dix?
MRe DOAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I will try.

I notice on page 1, in the chronological

list of docket entries, under the date of November 14, 1974,
your motion to strike the third claim for relief, which is
the 19 83 claim, was granted.

Is that right?

November 14, 1974.
'MR. DOAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
All right.

Now, when you turn over to

pacts 40, this is after the trial, there was a motion for new
trial.
Page 40.

I notices in paragraph 2, on® of the

grounds of the motion is, s*Th© court erred in dismissing

MR. DOAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

That’s right.

That’s the motion for

And then when you get to

then there was an appeal by the plaintiff

MR. DOAN:

reason may be, the dismissal of the 1983 claim.

Does that bring before us the question whether the

MR. DOAN;

Well, I would submit, if Your Honor

please, that it does not.
QUESTION:

That is doesn’t.

MR. DOAN:

That it does not.

QUESTION:

But, in any event, if it does, I take it

the first question ws have to decide is whether or not the
1983 action was properly dismissed before we reach the question
of measure of damages.
MR. DOAN:

Well, that would be, of course, absolutely

.'t'.-'-’ct if tiiat were the issue before the Court:
4

the correct-

ness of it.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

If they presented that in -the question.
It. certainly hasn’t been presented with

any crystal clarity, I must say.
QUESTION: Well, thereno question that on® of tie
specific issues argued in the Colorado Supreme Court was
whether or not the 1983 action was appropriate — was properly
dismissed.
I have got the brief her© of the plaintiff or the
appellant in that case, arid that is one of the specific
questions asserted to the Colorado Supreme Court.
MR. DOAN;

Wall,

t

would say that it was argued,

41

Mr* Justice White, because what they were complaining about
was not in reality the dismissal of 19 83, it was because in -~
}

you didn't us© 'the right me esure of damages, and had you said
it’s 1983 instead of wrongful death, then you should have used
punitive damages, you should have used some federal rule? and
that’s what the argument was all about*
QUESTION:

Is there son® difference in the elements

necessary to prove recovery, as you understand it, as between
a Section 1983 claim, such as was pleaded her®, and the
Colorado Wrongful Death statute?
MR* DOAN:

No, I know of no other rule, Mr* Justice

Rehnquist, that could be used in the case.
n.j

Because there is

federal rule of damages in the case, and where there is no

federal rule, 1988 cays you shall look to the State lav/ and
apply it in the trial and disposition of the cause.

QUESTION:

But take the substance of the action

rather than the remedy.

If the plaintiff makes out a claim

trndtr the Wrongful Death statute, under these circumstances,
would he also make out a claim under 1983, and vice versa?
MR. DOAN;

^

No, because there is no

there is no

federal wrongful death. He couldn't state a claim under 1983
for wrongful death, because it doesn't exist. 1983 says you
shall look to and apply 1983 where there is no remedy other­
wise.
And the upshot of what

and if they got. the purest

thing that they wanted in this case, they would have one rule
that would apply to police officers, who are the only people
carrying guns, and another rule that would apply to a private
shopkeeper if he had shot the plaintiff under these circum-»
stances»
So I submit, if the Court please, that there is
aosolutely no basis for recovery in this action? and we ask
that the?. Court affirm the judgment below and restate to the
lower courts of this land the tenets of Monro®, and set forth
explicitly what Monroe meansf in regard fco what is available
in a 1983 action, and perhaps this kind of confusion will
■eel" be evoi b; d in this Court.
Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID K. REES, ESQ.,

Yes, I do. Your Honor.

If it please toe Court:

It thus used the Colorado net pecuniary

MR’i REES:

Well, it doesn't have the reference to

the statute, but we —
QUESTION: Well, in the face of the complaint which
preceded it, which explicitly went on for a page or so
mentioning 1983.

Is that not so?

MR® REES:

I don't remember -- I think we die

mention: 19 83 in the preceding one.

It was, at all times,

understood by all parties that we were continuing our 1983
claim, that — and that we have all of the elements there,
its

it’s fact pleading, and we did plead the elements, and the
court treated it as a 1983 action in ruling on the motion to
dismiss.

The Colorado Supreme Court treated it as a 1983

44
action in affirming» And the partd.es have always treated it as
a 1983 action, and it was -always understood»
)

Further, the jury instructions that we tendered were
jury instructions for a Section 1983 action»

There was no

misunderstanding on that point at any time.
And the reason the question is postured as it is,
is because the basis of the Colorado court's ruling — because
the basis of their ruling was that the Colorado rule of
damages applied, and therefore the district court acted
properly in dismissing the complaint»
So, when I drafted the issue for cert, I thought
that that language, which is perhaps sloppy, fairly included
the question of
properly
problem:

the dismissal, as it had been litigated

every stage, and was clearly the thrust of our
was that they had dismissed it, but that they had

dismissed it because of the rule of damages they had applied.
QUESTION;

Well, do you agree -chat before we get

issixv of damages, what the proper test, whether it's
federal or 2tat», of damago» is», we have to decide whether or
not you have a 1983 cause of action?
HR. REES:
QUESTION:

I think that's fair.
I suppose it's not relevant, Mr. R©es, but

would it bo a reasonable assumption that the jury, in fixing
the damage at $1500, in effect and as a practical matter,
awarded a sum to cover the funeral expanses of this man?
