ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN L. BIOFF, ESQ.,
ON BEHAI,F OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BIOFFz

Mr. Chief Justice? and may it pleas© the

Courts
Tha issue 1b. this case is whether ©a employer may b@
required to arbitrate a dispute between the employer ©ad a
union wh@r® the dispute s that is both the events which give
ris-3 to the alleged liability and the union's claim concerning
that liability all. occur after the agreement to arbitrate is
ended.
Tlo facts of til© case are undisputed.

Th© employer

NoId©, a manufacturer ef bakery goods, maintained and operated
a bakery plant in Norfolk, Virginia, and had entered into a
labor agreement in July of 1970 with the respondent union
which had a term extending until July 21, 1973,.

However, the

duration clause of the labor agreement provided that after
July 21, 1973, the labor agreement would remain in effect until
either a new agreement was reached by the parti.es or either
party gave written notice to the other of cancellation*
The labor agreement, contained a severance pay pro­
vision.,

That provision in general terms stated that employees

4
with three or more years of continuous service with the em­
ployer would be entitled to a severance payment based upon a
formula set out in th© contract, upon the happening ©f certain
contingencies, on© of which was th© permanent closing of th©
plant.
Th© agreement also contained a grievance arbitration
procedure*

In mid-May 1973 , the union gave notice to the com­

pany pursuant to section 8{d) of th© National Labor Relations
Act of its intention to negotiate a new agreement and negotia­
tions between th© company and the union then commenced and con­
tinued fox a period of sent© three months *

No agreement was

r©ached by th® parties during this period of negotiation and
on August 20,- 1973, th© union sent to the' company a written
notie © of seven-day cancellation of th® contract pursuant to
the duration clause of the agreement«

That notice was sent on

August 20, 1973, which meant that the labor agreement termin­
ated by reason of the union's notice on August 27, 1973.
The negotiators for the parties met on August 31,
IS?3, at which time the union rejected th© company's final
proposal for a new contract.

At that meeting, the union ad­

vised the company that unless th® compary accepted the union’s
proposals, the union would go out on strike.
After considering the union's proposals, considering
its financial position, tlm employer concluded that it could
not survive at its Norfolk, Virginia plant in th© face of a

5
strik©, and it accordingly notified the union that ©ffoctiv©
that night» August 31» 1973 » th® employer was permanently
closing its Norfolk» Virginia plant» and in fact on that date
the employer did close permanently its Norfolk» Virginia plant,
and on teat date it terminated th® employees represented by
th© union.
Subsequent to th® plant closing» subsequent to th®
termination of th© employ ©as» the union made a demand upon th©
company for th© payment of severance pay.
clined to pay severance pay.

The employer de­

Th® union then mad© a demand

employer was obligated to pay the severance pay.
declined to arbitrate,

The employer

m both instances» th® employer’s po­

sition was that the obligation to pay severance pay' and th®
duty to arbitrate both ware extinguished or expired when th®
contract ended*
QUESTIONS

Suppose hypothetically that instead of

that sequence th® parties had rocked along for another year or
two without a contract» as I am sure you know sometimes
happens,

MR. BIOS’S*s
QUESTION?

Yes» sir.
And then after a year or a year and a

half th© employer closed th® plant» would you say that th©
right to the severance pay which you now claim was vested
under tho written contract would be enforceable a year and &

6
half or two y©are later?
MR. BIOFPs

Your Honor, are you assuming in your

question that the contrast had been terminated —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BIOFF;
QUESTION:

— as it was?
Y@S.

MR. BIOFF:
QUESTION:

Our position is —
The contract terminated but employment

continued.
MR. BIOFF:
QUESTION:

Employment.
And the factory continued operating.

MR. BIOFF:
bo

But then was closed a year and a half or

later?
QUESTION:

Y@S.

MR. BIOFF;

On those facts, I think we would have the

sanus fact situation as we have in this case.
QUESTION:

Five years later than it would have to b©

the same, wouldn't it?
MR

4

BIOFPs

Yes, our position would fo® — our

position is simply this, that under the contract the employees
were nut entitled to severance pay simply because there was no
contract after August 27, 1973.

That is not to say — and I

think that this point is at the very heart of this litigation
— that is not to say that the employees ware automatically
divested of a right to severance pay when the contract

7
terminated, because under the National Labor Relations Act
wheat a contract ends# the terms and conditions of employment
that are set forth in that contract continue in affect until
such time as either this; employer and the union agree to new
terms and condition-j of employment or the employer bargains
away the existing terms and conditions of employment by bar­
gaining with the union feo an impasse.
In this case, it is unclear, the record is unclear ais
to exactly what happened on August 31, 1973, that is whether
the union mad® any demand upon the employer feo negotiate with
the employer over the ending of severance benefits, and thus
it is unclear whether there may have been a waiver by the
union of its right feo bargain over the elimination of the
severance benefits.
Put assuming that there was no waiver of that right
and assuming that the employer simply unilaterally ended the
severance benefits, that would be/ arguably a violation ox
section 8(a) (S) of the National Labor Relations Act,

on© of

the remedies for which might have been the payment cf the
severance benefits.
The point is here th® union never filed an unfair
labor practice charge, it never filed a complaint with the
Labor Board saying that the employer had unilaterally termin­
ated th® severance benefits.
l am not sure, Mr, Chief Justice, that answers your

8
question, tout I think *—
QUESTION:

Wall, I taka your a as war to be that, no

matter how much tirn© had ©lapsed, if the mmi kept on working
and the factory is ©pen , that whan, as and if the factory was
closed, severance pay under the original contract would be
enforceable?
MR. BIOFP:

No, sir.

Assuming that the contract had

ba®a terminated, the severance pay would not be enforceable
under the contract because the contract no longer existed,

if

a —
QUESTION:

Then I did misunderstand you.

I thought

you said at first it would be the same whether it was three
days, three weeks or three years.
MR, BIOFF:

I am saying that.

What I am saying is

that, whether it is three days, three weeks, or three years
after the termination of the contract, there is no right to
severance pay under the contract because the contract no longer
exists and consequently there is no right to arbitrate the
question of whether or not severances pay is owing, again be­
cause there is no agreement to arbitrate, and the duty, as
this Court has frequently said, to arbitrate depends upon the
existence of an.agreement to arbitrate«
QUESTION:
MR. BIOFF:
QUESTION:

I have two questions,
Yes, sir?
Suppose a matter was in arbitration for

9
about a w©ak and the plant closed down and the contract was
goa®, would that arbitration continue?
MR. BIOFF%

Are you r©farring to an arbitration over

severance pay or scan® other issue?
QUE STION s
MR. BIOFF:

Anything?
Any issue.

I would think the arbitra­

tion would continue b@caus© presumably th® arbitration pro­
vision under that hypothetical case had been invoked prior to
th© terminal data of th© agreement,
QUESTION:

Now, what if there was a mass who claimed

that he wasn’t paid for th® last week of work, he could main­
tain that under th© contract, of course?
MR. BIOFFs

You are assuming that the man works

Monday through Friday, th© contract ends on Saturday, can he
then arbitrate the issue?
QUESTION:
MR. BIOFF;

Yas.
I think the answer to that is probably

yes, that h® can, but I think —
QUESTION:
MR. BIOFF:

Under the contract?
Yes, sir.

I think th® difference between

that case —
QUESTION:

I think you had better say that h© could

gat it for work rather than under th© contract.
MR. BIOFF:

Well, no, I think there is a distinction

between the case you put and th© case that is at bar here, and

10
1 think tha difference is simply this:

When th© individual

works Monday 'through Friday, a contract ends, th® employer
refuses to pay for that last week's work, I think that issue
might vary well be arbitrable because all of the ©vents giving
rise to the/griavance that was filed occurred while the con­
tract existed, and indeed th® employer's liability for th©
payment of those wages cam© into existence during th® term of
th® contract*
In our ease, the difference is that there was no
liability created for severance pay until after th® contract
terminated,
QUESTION:

If you had severed th© man on a Friday,

ha would have had an arbitrable case, wouldn't he?
MR. BIOFF:

Let's assume a contract ends on Saturday,

we had discharged the man on Friday —
QUESTIONs
MR. BIOFFs

Right.
— th© grievance was filed on Monday,

it would be our position that that grievance is arbitrable be­
cause the ©vent giving rise to a claimed liability occurred
while the contract existed.

If the man was discharged on

Monday and the contract expired on Saturday, it would b© cur
position that that discharge grievance would not b® arbitrable.
Let me talc® this case.

Now, let's assume that there

is a provision in tha contract that says an employ©© with on©
year or more of service may not be discharged without a prior

11
warning notice,

ted let’s assume that after a — let’s assume

that the contract expires on Saturday and the. employer dis­
charges the employee on Monday? but the employs® has not had a
prior warning notice.

Mow? it would be our position on those

facts that that discharge is not subject to the grievance
arbitration procedure simply because at the time the discharge
occurred the grievance arbitration procedure no longer existed.
However? that employee might very well have a claim before the
National Labor Relations Board that the employer had unilater­
ally changed the terms and conditions of employment after the
contract ended, without bargaining with th© union, because the
pre-existing term and condition of employment was that, employees
would not be discharged, that is employees with more than a
year of service, would not, be discharged without a prior warn­
ing notice; after th© contract ends the employer discharges
the employe© without a prior warning notice, hence there is a
change, a unilateral change in terms and conditions of employ­
ment and the amployee has a case before th© Labor Board under
8(a)(5).
QUESTION;

Counsel, you emphasise th© critical fact

being that the liability totally matured prior to th© expira­
tion of the agreement to give rise to the duty to arbitrate,
as I understand it.

You say all th© ©vents supporting the

claim, supporting tha liability happened before th© contract
expired.

Do I misstate —

12

MR. BIOFF:

That i3 th© test.

QUESTIONS

I stated it awkwardly.

MR. BIOFFs

That is not our cae@.

Our case is

averything happened aftar the contract expired.
QUESTIONS

I understand that.

But you wouId concede

that you had a duty to arbitrata if the events occurred before
the contract expired.
MR. BIOFFs
QUESTION:

Yea.
Wall, supposing you have a vacation pay

case and it is generally considered to b© a vested interest in
vacation pay but Christmas doesn't come until two weeks after
termination of the contract, would the claim for the pro-rated
share of tha vacation' pay ba arbitrable or not?

I am stating

it awkwardly, but assume that the contract expires after ten
mouths of vacation pay vested bafor© he actually gats the
vacation, could he arbitrate that?
MR, BIOFF:

If I understand your hypothetical cor­

rectly# tha answer is — cur answer to that would be no.
QUESTION:
MR. BIOFF:

That is what. I thought you would say,
Yes.

And I think the reason that it

would not b'3 is because that sine© the agreement to arbitrate
had ended prior to the time that the liability for pro-rata
vacation cams into existence.

Now, again — and I think that

MR. BIOFFs
QUESTION:
MR. BIOFFs

AS to th© ~
It wonId b© a© again, I think.
As to th© hours that h© worked prior to

th® terminal date of the contract, we would say that that gave
rise to an arbitrable issue, because -the employer's liability
was ers&ted prior to the expiration of th® contract.
QUESTION;

You see, if th© right to severance pay is

a vested right, your liability was created at least to the ex­
tent — fee- a cor-la in extent was created —
MR, BIOFFs

I think that depends, Your Honor, on

what you mean by a vested right or what you mean by the —
QUESTIONs

Well, let’s assume there is a vested right

here, what, duty do you. have to these people?

Would you have

to pay them then?
MR. BIOFFs

vested right you mean —
QUESTION;

f
That they have a right to th© accrued

termination pay that they have earned, .even though the succeed­
ing contract may not provide for it.
. MR. BIOFFs

They have a right to it so long as the

employer and th© union have not. bargained it away during the
hiatus between contracts, and therein lies the whole point in

14
this cas®.
QUESTIONS

Wall , as sum© ~~ let ra® put the case a

little different.
MR. BIOFP:
QUESTION;

All right.
Assume the contract said in words "you

will ear si X dollars of severance pay for so many months that
you work and in circum stances shall this be bargained away f
taken away, or anything else, you get it when you leave the
employes for any rsason whatsoever,w and then you didn't pay
him.

Would they have a right ~ they would have a clear

contract right to the money, but then you disputed over the
amount or something like that, would that be arbitrable?
MR. BIQFFs

No.

And I don’t think it is a contract

right to the. money either, because there is no contract.

The

right to the money stems from the fact that the severance pay
obligation becomes a term ar.& condition of employment after
the agreement endse th® employer may not unilaterally change,
it doesn't stem from the contract.

The terminology "secured
i

right" and "vested right" as far as we arts concerned; is simply
i

a label.

The question is what do you mean by that. 1
If you mean by an accrued .right that the employer

and the union may not bargain to eliminate it, then wa don't
agree there is such a thing as an accrued right, because under
the National Labor Relations Act the employer and the union
f

can bargain to eliminate any right that, exists under a labor

15

contract.
Let's take the severance pay case.

Let's take our

cas® and let's assume that instead of the employer simply
notifying the union oa August 31, 1973 that it was going to
close the plant and it was not going to pay severance pay,
assume instead that the employer had erne to the union and
said we are contemplating closing the plant, w© are in poor
financial condition? w© do not want to pay severance pay? we
want to negotiate with you about the severance pay, and they
do negotiate*
How, arm of two things is going to happen.

The

union agrees to the elimination of the severance pay, and
certainly the law doesn't say the employer and the union camnot agree to the elimination of it, and if they do eliminate
it and the employer than closes the plant, obviously no
severance pay is due.

But let's assume that the union does

Certainly, Your Honor -- let's tak© our severance
T3i@re is a severance pay provision in the contract

that expired August 27, 1973.

Let's assume that instead of

what actually occurred her®, the plant remained in operation,
the parties bargained for a new contract, and tho employer
said in those negotiations, look, w© want to eliminate the
severance pay provision from the next contract, and let’s
further assume that the union agreed to that elimination and
they entered into a contract without a severance pay provision,
and the .employer then closed the plant under the succeeding
contract.

Surely, no severance pay is due and owing under

those facts.
QUESTION?
MR. BIOFFs

I am not sure I agree.
lhat would be our position, at least.

It would also be our position that even assuming the union did
not agree to the elimination of severance pay, the employer
nevertheless could bargain to an impasse with the union for the
elimination of the severance

and then eliminate if, and

the union's recourse then would be to strike.

1?
The fundamenta I thing that is at the vary core of
this law suit, and it is a vary important issue, is that the
Fourth Circuit has confused two very distinct national labor
policies.

The first national labor policy is that when you

have an existing labor agreement, the parties ar© encouraged
to resolve their controversies a rad their disputes by peaceful
means pursuant to a grievance arbitration procedure, and indeed
that is spalled out in the Labor Management Relations Act, in
section 203(d),
Incidentally, the language of 203(d) is very inter©sting because it says, and I quote:

"Final adjustment by a

method agreed upon by the parties is hereby declared to be
the desirable method for settlement of grievance disputes
arising over the application or interpretation of an existing
collective bargaining agreement,"
Now, that is one very important national labor
policy, but there is an equally importent national labor
policy that comas into play whan a labor contract expires and
during the hiatus between labor contracts, and that important
labor policy is that, the parties ar© gr@a to bargain collec­
tively and to utilize their respective economic strengths to
obtain what they desire in those negotiations.
QUESTION:

The union cm Id only strike her© because

the contract had expired?
MR. BIOFFs

That is correct, sir.

18

QUESTION?

Because there was a promise not t© strike

in return for an agreement to arbitrat®?
MR. BIOFFs

That's right? sir.

During tha tarra ©f

tha contract? tha union could not have struck.

The union

gav© notice to tha employer to tarminat© the agreement.
Thar® was only on® reason that the union gav© that notice and
that was to fra© them to strike,

had so what tha Fourth

Circuit is really doing her© is the Fourth Circuit is saying
tha employ or has a duty to arbitrate after the contract ends?
even though tha union has tha right to strike during that
period? and that is my vary point.

That is why the two

national labor policies? which are very distinct? on© that
exists while the contract is in force? tha other that exists
during tha hiatus between the contracts? is being intermingled or confused by tha decision, of tha Fourth Circuit in
this case.

There was no

agreement covering fcfas — according t© your submission,- th©
ratas of pay or th© working condition^ during that period,
after th® agreement had baa a abrogated and terminated.
MR. BIOFF:

That5b correct. Your Honor.

But under

th© National Labor Relations Act, as interpreted by the
National Labor Relations Board, when a labor agreement ter*»
minatas, th® employer may not unilaterally change th© terms
and conditions of employment that existed under th® expired
labor contract until either (1) it negotiates with th© union
and the union agrees to soma change; or (2) it negotiates
wit!» th® union and they reach a bona fide impasse over an
issue, at which point th© employer may then unilaterally change
that condition.
QUESTION:

Well, then, why doesn't that principle

apply here?
MR. BIOFF:
QUESTION:

It does.
I mean apply her© to affect th® severance

pay and ths arbitration thereof.
MR. BIOFF:

Wall, th© point is th© arbitration

Davis case, in our brief ~~ th© arbitration clauso is not a
term and condition of employment.
QUESTION:
MR. BIOFF:

I see.

wherein tha Fourth Cifeeuit has committed a vary serious error.

No, Judge, I am not.

Your Honor, I am

not conceding that.

you said.
MR. BIOFF:

sooner or later?

MR. BIOFF:

Because the union want to th© wrong forum.

MR» BXOFFs
$15,000»

I am really not sure, I think around

But the point is, Your Honor, when the union went to

the Federal District Court and then when the union went to the
Fourth Circuit, it created some law that is extremely detri­
mental to the principles of labor law that those of us that
practice in the field rely on, and so this case involves not
money but principle, a very important on©, I might add.
The other points that X would like to make before
closing about the Fourth Circuit’s decision is that obviously
it rewrites the contract, the party's contract.

The labor

agreement, in the duration clause, says that upon — after
July 21, 1373, that either party, upon seven days written
notice, could terminate th© agreement*

1^ think it said could
\

terminate this agreement.
Now, this agreement means every provision in the
agreement, not some of them, but all of them.
QUESTIONS

Lat's assume that th© contract had said

expressly in the arbitration clause and this arbitration clause
shall apply to th® settlement of any rights accrued prior to
th® expiration of this contract, and that it is perfectly clear
that they intended to arbitrate any dispute over an accrued

th® contract that way?

Yes, and so it is an interpretation, and

how should \m disagree with their interpretation of a collec\

QUESTION:

Well, I assume you say no it isn't possible

to read their opinion that way, you are saying that they con­
cluded there is a duty to arbitrate on policy grounds or some
other reason, other than th® terms of the contract.
MR. BIOFFs

That would be my corselusion. and that is

’fch© way I would read the decision, because you can't read this
contract and conclude that the arbitration agreement did not
©nd on August 27, 1973.

MR. BIOFP:

It is a tough eas© for you# isn’t it?
Wiley is tougher.

I don't have too much

trouble with the Piano case because in th© Piano case, the
plant closed, the employees were terminated, the demand to
rah ire them at the new plant in French Lick# Indiana was made#
and th© refusal by the employer to agree to th© rehiring#

24

all of those facts occurred before the contract ended.

The

only thing that occurred afterward was th© fact that they
didn’t rehire psopl© la French Lick,

in other words, Your

Honor# the Piano case would be analogous to our case —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Then it is your friend's

problem, not yours.
Go ahead.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD ROSENBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ROSENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas®

the Court:
I think that the issues her© ar© very clearly drawn
by the questions that have coras from the Court.

Essentially

what we have is a proposition advanced by the petitioner in
this case that is extremely detrimental to the national labor
policy to have contractual rights vindicated in the contractual
forum, that in some way, using the arbitral forum that this
contract provided, violates the national labor policy.

That

argument is, of course, absurd.
It does not give full credit to this contract between
tha parties.

It does not give full credit to the presumption

of arbitrability that this Court has many times declared.

It

pays no attention whatsoever to the repeated decisions of this
Court, most particularly the Wiley and Piano Workers cases,
Your Honor, and Wiley is indeed directly on point.
QUESTION:

You agree with the language in Wiley as

applied to this case that the question of arbitrability is one
for the court to decide?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Certainly, Your Honor.

And just for

27
the moment, if I may, the Fourth Circuit did discuss the
question of the arbitrator's cwm duty upon remand.
is sot before this Court.

That issue

The dissenter is the Fourth Circuit

indicated that there was a procedural arbitrability question,
and that question is sot presented in the cert petition or
argued here.
qua none.

The question here is exclusive arbitirability

And I think that Wiley and Piano Workers ar© di­

rectly in point.
The on® point in Wiloy that is never discussed either
in this argument or in the briefs by the petitioner is that
element .-of Wiley that specifically refers to the question about
the accrual of rights for the realization thereafter.

And in

Wiley the law suit was essentially.a declaratory judgment
brought —■
QUESTION:

But do you say that, any time at least

arguably a right has accrued under a labor contract, the
arbitration clause will provide the termination of the contract
unless there is some specific provision against it?
MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION?

Yes, Your Honor, and that —

And do you think that is Wiley?

MR. ROSENBERG:

I think that is Wiley.

I think that

is the Steel Workers trilogy, I think that is Piano Workers.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't know about Steel Workers.

What, about lha rule that in order' to fore© an employer or a
union to arbitrate there has to bs a promise to arbitrate?

28
MR. ROSENBERG:

Hara

there is unquestionably a

promiaa to arbitrate.
■ QUESTION:

I kacw, but where did the — yen have to

find that the promise was intended to apply after th@ termination of the contract in which the promise is included.
MR. ROSENBERG:

There is no indication whatsoever

that it was not intended to apply to all contractual disputes.
Wa have here
QUESTION:

You &r© missing my point.

My point is

where do you get th© notion that a month after a contract has
expired that a right that is accrued prior tc the termination
/

of the contract has to be arbitrated?

MR. ROSENBERG:

Prom the very language of the arbi­

tration clause and from th© presumption cf arbitrability.
QUESTION: I know, but the contract has expired, those
words are now gone.
MR. ROSENBERG:

The contract has not expired in its

If rights survive under that contract —
QUESTION:

If, the question is if there is a right

to arbitrate, that is the question.
MR. ROSENBERG:

The question, Your Honor, is whether

there is a right to severance pay —
QUESTION:

Oh, you can do that —

MR. ROSENBERG:

— and if there is a right to sever­

29
QUESTION:

— you can do that ia a 301 suit.

MR. ROSENBERGs

— if there is a right to severance

pay, a vested right to severanee pay, then the proper forum
for the resolution of such a dispute is arbitration and not a
court.
QUESTION5

I understand about your position, but in

order to sustain it you have got to show that there was a
promise to arbitrate.
MR. ROSENBERG:

There was unquestionably a promise to

arbitrate in the broadest imaginable language, and my opponent
has characterized its agreement to arbitrate as admittedly
broad.

It contains no exclusion.
QUESTION:

But the promise has expired.

MR. ROSENBERG:

The promise has expired•no more than

th-a right to vested severance pay or vested earned wages.

Sue

hypothetical© that, were presented 'to my opponant during his
/■

argument made clear that there are obviously rights which are
an accrued or earned right natures which survive the-normal
expiration of th© agreement.
QUESTION:

I could agree wholly with that without

also agreeing that any disputes about those rights hay© to be
arbitrated •.
MR. ROSENBERG:

But, if you look to the arbitration

clause, this arbitration clause doss not remove any contractual
dispute from arbitration.

If there is to fc® a dispute about

30

that substantive right, it must be determined by an arbitrator
and not by a court# otherwise w© would have the ludicrous
situation in which there would be forum shopping as between
courts and arbitrators# depending upon the fortuity of the
date of termination.

Wa assert rights that ©re based upon

this contract.
QUESTIONS

I suppose you would concede to the arbi­

tration clause if the arbitration clause said that this

premised arbitration shall not apply after the termination of
the contract# then you wouldn’t ba making this argument?
MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

Certainly# Your Honos.*#

Your client is not in a position to raise

much question about fortuity sine© it was the on© that gave
notice of termination.
MR. ROSENBERG:

But if that had been in the hypo­

thetical situation# Your Honor# if it had occurred some other
way# the question still is as to whether or not this arbitra­
tion clausa-is in any way limited.
QUESTION:

-Justice White has shown that, it could

interpretation possible under which there is to be no

QUESTION:

Well, that; wasn't in th© contextof an
That was in th© context of what issues under

a currently administered contract ar® arbitrable.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Wall, Your Honor, there is of course

th® question in Wiley and then in Piano Workers that Justice
Whits pointed out.

In Wiley, the rights to b© arbitrated were,

rights subsequent to th© expiration'o£ the. agreement.

Justice

Harlan, for a unanimous Court, in Wiley, very specifically
dealt with th® rights occurring I believe it was after January
1, 1962, which was th© expiration date of th© contract.
QUESTION:

Counsel, ware you bound to arbitrata?

Suppose when you made th© demand for severance pay th® employer
said let's arbitrate, would you have been bound?
MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

After the termination of the contract?

MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Y©s.

And therefore your strike was in breach

of the agreement?
MR. ROSENBERG:

There was no strike here, Your Honor ,

because the plant was closed prior to any strike.

But such a

strike ~
QUESTION:

You gave notice, didn't you?

MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

W© gav® notice, but ~~

QUESTION:

Subsequently?

Ho* let's assume that the moment that you

MR, ROSENBERG:

W© struck at a time that we had 'no

notion that the plant was to be closed.

The strike that would

have occurred in such a circumstance would sot have anything to
do with severance pay.
QUESTION:

But the strike during the termination of

the contract would have been forbidden by the contract.
MR. ROSENBERG:

A strike for severance pay would have

been forbidden by the contract.
QUESTION:

Well* you have no strike clausa.

MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

You had a no strike clause in ‘the contract.

MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes, but a no strike clause —

And it was expressed in return for a

promis® to arbitrate.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Th© no strike clause was in return

for a promise to arbitrate contractual issues.
dealing with hare is a contractual claim.

What we are

The severance

33
pay is a contractual claim.

Everything stems from the fact

that our claim for severance pay sounds in contract; is
governed by the contract, and this Court's decisions make
clear that; where there is such a claim, then necessarily there
must be arbitration unless, as Your Honor has pointed out,
there is an expressed exclusion.
QUESTION:

Well, if you v?er© bound to arbitrata and

the arbitration clause was still in existence, you had no
business giving notice to strike.
MR. ROSENBERG:

W© gave that notice prior to the time

that the employer indicated any intention of a plant closing.
The issue of severance pay was not before anyone because so
far as vm understood the plant was to r«anain open forever.
QUESTION:

Was there a contract, when you gave the

notice to strike?
MR. ROSENBERG:

There was a contract — w<a had given

notice that, the contract was to foe out of effect following the
tii® that wa would be — pardon me, shortly prior to the time
that we intended to strike.

We never struck.

Wa gave notice

Wa had at no point

tractual conditions.

Wa weren’t even aware that we had a

contractual problem,

H© in fact paid

And same of your questions by Your Honor and by

Justice Marshall dealt with tfea question of vacation pay, and
in this Court the petitioner is now saying it had no vacation
pay obligation but yet it want right ahead and paid them, and
vacation pay is indistinguishable front severance pay, and
cartainly as regards the arbitrability of a claim for sever­
ance pay, a claim that is based upon the contract itself.
QUESTION:

Do I understand it, at the time you gave

the notice of intention to strike —

QUESTION?

Right.

— there was no contractual arbitrable

issue to which' your promise not to strike applied?
f ■’

MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

Of course not.

That didn’t arise until the severance pay

issue arose —
MR.1 ROSENBERG:
QUESTION;
was shut down?

That did not —

— and that couldn't axis® until the plant

35
MR. ROSENBERG:

W© said w© are going to strike you

in order to get a higher wag®.

The company said, well, we

can't, afford that, sorry, w© are going to close our plant.
Then we said a week later, you closed the plant, now pay us
the money you ora us under our contract? so that the timing
makes absolutely clear that any threatened strike had nothing
whatsoever to do with it.
QUESTION:

I want to bs clear.

You answered to my

Brother White that, at the time you gave th© notice you were
going to strike, there existed no arbitrable is sue., no con­
tractual issue for arbitration, to which the promise not to
strike applies.
MR. ROSENBERG:
QUESTION:

Precisely right, Your Honor.

Am 1 correct in understanding that -the

contractual issue with respect -bo severance pay is simply
whether or not th® obligation is a vested right or not, is
that
MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes, however phrased, whether vested,

earned or accrued or whatever it is, whatever the phrasing*
And l think the Fourth Circuit stated it very well.

The

nature of the right of severance pay is something that is de­
termined by th® parties, by their intention.

Th© question of

who is to determine* the parties' intention has been answered
repeatedly, and where there is, as here, a broad arbitration
clause, that question as to the intent of th© parties is to

36

ha answered by the arbitrator.

If cot? w© would have a site”

aid on in which the very saries of hypothetical that war©
presented would all b© matters for the already overburdened
federal courts.

I think Your Honor asked a question about

wages.
It is very easy to say yes * wa will pay the wages
that were due in the final weak.
dispute over those wages'?

But what is there is a

In that circumstances, would there

not then be a federal suit for §25, a difference between a
claim of wages for $75 and $100.' I think it is clear that
bsyosd any question that that matter is one for arbitration
rathsr than the courts, and that is what we are discussing
her©, because our- claim is contractual in nature.

If not

resolved by tha arbitrator, it must be resolved by the courts.
And if to bs resolved by the courts, it would inundate an
already overburdened federal judiciary.
QUESTION:

What do you say about his argument that

all you had to -do is go to tha Labor Board and file an unfair
labor practice charge and you would have been paid?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Ws don't go to the Labor Board to

enforce contract claims, Your Honor.

Ws have a contract, we

Tha Labar Board is not
Section 301 is the

place to enforce contractual claims.
QUESTION*

He says that by refusing to pay you, they

3?
changed the terms and conditions of the employment unilaterally
and thereby committed an unfair labor practice and all you bad
to do is file a charge and, as I understand him, they
desperately search for a defense and then pay you.
MR. ROSENBERG!

I doubt if they would, have said that

if wa had filed an unfair labor practice charge.

Whether or

not they would have said that there was no impasse is some­
thing else again.

It is very easy in this Court to say that

they had not bargained to impasse on fch© issue.

They might

have had an entirely different position before the National
Labor Relations Board.

We are perfectly prepared to submit our contract
claim to the contractually provided method for adjustment.

Why should w® go to the Labor Board to deal with an issue of
entirely different dimension?

That would be ludicrous.

We

have a contract, tv® want it enforced and we want it enforced
in the way that the contract itself provides.

W© have a con-

tract with ass admittedly broad, to us© the company's phrase,
arbitration clause, a clause that the Court of Appeal's referral
to as all-encompassing.
So unlike the hypothetical presented by Mr. Justice
White, we don't have an arbitration clausa that, is in any way
limited? w@ rather have one that is as broad as can be.
given that clause and given this Court’s decisions saying
that, there can ba no denial c f arbitration in such a

j

availablef it is clear that tta Fourth Circuit’s interpreta­
tion of this arbitration clause in this contract as permitting
arbitration is one that mast be given credence.
QUESTIONS

How long does- this arbitration clausa

survive the termination of the contract?
MB. ROSENBERG:

For so long as contract claims can

fcs made, in the saraa sens© that a suit for severance pay in a
court of law could be mad© sometime later or the same way that
a suit for a pension might come at sometime substantially sub­
sequent he the normal expiration of the contract.

If such a

claim regarding pension cams up, it would obviously be a con­
tract. claim to b© contractually resolved, and similarly a
claim for severance pay based upon a"'contract must be con­
tractually resolved, even though it might coma up somfcira©
subsequent? significantly subsequent in time.
We don’t have that issue her®.

The demand for arbi­

tration followed immediately upon the notification that the
plant was closed and the denial of the severance pay.
I think I have used all but my opponent’s rebuttal
time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

No, your opponent has no

time.
MR. ROSENBERG :

Oh, he has no time and!, that being

s

so,

ws will pass any further time, Your Honor, and end the case
