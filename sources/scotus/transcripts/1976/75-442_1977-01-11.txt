MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-442, Poelker against Doe.
Mr. Freeman, I think you may proceed whan you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE P. FREEMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may if please

the Court:
The nature of this case generally involves the
assertion of an indigent pregnant woman that she has a
constitutional right to require a municipality to provide the
surgeon and all hospital facilities to carry out her first
trimester decision to b® aborted.

The city, after this Court’s

decision in Roe and in Doa v. Bolton, did not recognize a
constitutional duty to provide such abortions but continued
its policy against the establishment of an abortion service
in its hospitals.
St. Louis has two general hospitals, and I say advis­
edly.

The last time I left St. Louis it did.

There is a.

debate going on right now whether to abandon one or not.

And

they are physically separated from the other department or
governmental buildings.

And through the years it has expressed

or reflected the culture of the state which, as the Court, well
knows, Missouri has had a criminal abortion statute, and that

4
was Infused within all of our civil governmental structure,
including the hospitals.

And that situation obtained up

until the time of this Court’s Roe and Dp® decisions.

And

thereafter, although at that time there was considerable
debate, confusion, addressed to the problem, but there was
never any express, direct changing of the established
hospital policy against abortion.

And what 1 refer to as

abortion is non-therapeufcic or elective abortion.
This case arose over that policy in the hospital,
and later changed by trial tactic, which I will allude to, by
reason of the fact that an indigent lady appeared at the
hospital, and our hospital does not allow practice by private
physicians.

In other words, all of the physicians in the

hospital are governmental or city employees, and are selected
through civil service procedure.
The lady appeared at the hospital and went to the
GYN clinic and then was referred to the obstetrical clinic of
the hospital.

She was told that she was pregnant, and there

is some dispute in -the position of the parties as to whether
she asked for a non-therapeutic or elective abortion at the
time from the physicians there.
The physicians at the hospital, at the GYN and OB
clinics, represent a dual position.

Many years ago—and I

think I am accurat® in telling the Court that it was probably
20 to possibly 25 years ago—the City of St.. Louis was in some

5
accreditation -trouble, and the universities that provide
medical schools in St.Louis came to the aid of the city, and
St. Louis University was one of those, Washington University
the other, and entered into an arrangement where the
physicians of the staffs in the medical schools would staff
the various services of the hospitals.
with respect to the GYN and OB.

And that was done

And in this case there is a.

vestige of that by St. Louis University, which is a Jesuit,
Catholic, institution, in City Hospital No, 1 as distinguished
from another hospital called Homer G. Phillips Hospital,
which is City Hospital Mo. 2, which was staffed by Washington
University, which is a non-sectarian hospital.
Through the passage of the years th© Horaer G. Phillips
Hospital, No. 2, encountered the difficulty of Washington
University with its increased demand upon its own organic
hospital facilities to the extant that

physicians were not

furnished, at least in sufficient amounts by Washington
University to that, hospital, where in the case of City Hospital
No. 1, St, Louis University did maintain the OB and GYN
services in the hospital in contention in this case.

As I

state, that is an. accident of history,
The lady was refused her request of «an abortion,
after she was told she was pregnant, by several medical
students who were associated with St. Louis University
undergoing their training under the auspices or aegis of

G
St» Louis University under the instruction of senior
physicians who headed the various services there, including
these two, OB and GYN.
The reasons given at the time were the physicians5
personal reluctance, their personal morality, or ethical
positions against performing abortions on—-in this case it
happened to b® principally a financial indication.
was without fundsy-felt she could not

The lady

with her husband

unemployed™-felt she could not support another child..

In

this case the physicians there felt that they could not
render an abortion service to a woman because of that tyoe of
indication without any physiological indication.
The plaintiff ©r respondent here did not get the
abortion, went to a private institution through, I believe,
the arrangement of later counsel in the case, and she was
aborted ©n August 27th.

Fiv® days before that, she had filed

suit in the District Court, August 17th, and this was before
service was had upon one of the defendants here.
The case proceeded without in fine developing each
of the facts in it but attempting to allude to them as they
corns in because of the issues, the case developed three
principal matters with two subordinate ones to one of them.
And that is abortion on demand and the appellate abuse of
discretion through the unreasonably overturning the District
Court's findings and the appellate conviction and punishment

7
of the mayor, one of the petitioners here, of bad faith.

And

then there was the initial question of justiciability or the
standing and mootness of the auestion when it was existent in
the District Court.
There was a trial, an appeal on the justiciable
controversy question, a reversal by the Eighth Circuit, with
remand.

There was a 'trial on the m@rits with a reversal by

the Eighth Circuit and a remand, and then an ultimate two
appeals after that on the question of the attorneys' fees in
the case.
The Eighth Circuit's reasoning is based upon--its
finding of a denial of Equal Protection is based upon an
assumption that childbearing

and abortion are equivalent

and, therefor©, to assist childbearing-

but not offer abortions

is unequal treatment without legal justification.

In the

I

arguments of the other cases I think this question has been
lightly touched, but I think I can provide a service to this
Court by respectfully suggesting a different analysis or an
enlarged analysis,,

I think I could suggest t© the Court to

contrast the universe of childbearing

with abortion,

I think

the judicial point of view is required to be different in a
case such as this than it has been in any of the other type
of cases.

Your Honors * attention in the abortion cases of

Roe and Do© and P1azrned Parenthood v. Central Missouri and some
of the others has been centered towards abortion.

This case

8
involves something far more broad than abortion, and I think
that by respectfully suggesting these things to Your Honors
that it may b© of help in Your Honors' analysis.
The Court will certainly recall that childbearing
is a consummation of a person.

It is a value of infinite

worth, and event ©f incalculable consequences.
is its process and life is its end.
opposite.

Generation

Abortion is just the

It is 'the prevention of the birth of a person.

It is the obliteration of the possibility of a person.

It

is an interference with life, and death or non-existence is
its end.

Childbearing is a natural process.

The attitude of

the community, including the medical science it is associated
with in part, is to support and assist childbearing, not to
cause this natural phenomenon.

Abortion, on the other hand,

is an interruption and, deliberate termination of this natural
process, and thwarts it.
In objective logical extension, childbearing

is

essential for the continuation of the human race—the family,
the community, feh@ state, and the nation.

Abortion is, in an

objective, philosophical sense, genocidal.
Q

Mr. Freeman, do you want us to overrule

Wade and Roe?
MR. FREEMAN:

Not in this proceeding, Your Honor.

But I am trying to lay the bsisis to show the interest of th©
state in childbearing that is non-existent in abortion.

9

Q

I was just interested in where you were going

to end up.
MR. FREEMAN:

Abortion is genocidal.

Only its

exception or antithesis, childbearing, allows for survival
of mankind.

From these essences society's and the

individual’s relationships to childbearing and abortion are
totally different.

They are unique in themselves and foreign

t© each other and hostile in soma respects.
In childbearing a woman's objective is a live,
healthy infant, the fulfillment of her womanhood, and a wife
accomplishes her physical and spiritual function in the
marital status.

The father and husband realizes the

establishment or enlargement of his family and realizes an
important aspect of his manhood in the progeny ©f his family.
Q

All of this is true with respect to the whole

spectrum here, whether payment is mads by the state or whether
the city furnishes the service or whether it does not? is that
not so?
:

MR. FREEMAN:

That is true, Your Honor.

But those

considerations underlie the propriety and persuasiveness of
the distinctions that the Constitution ought to recognize in
the different treatment of abortion and childbearing.
Q

As a matter of policy, as a matter of state

policy, a state, quit® apart from our Constitution but simply
as a matter of policy or state policy, a state could have

10
either policy—could it not?—and states historically have
had both policies.

States have historically given bounties

for large families, and states have historically—I am talking
about states in th© world, not necessarily the United States —
but organized government, organized society has decided to
give to encourage large families in some states in some points
in history, and states equally have hit upon a policy of
encouraging small families.

And there are states today that

are doing that, India and others.
rational state policy.

Each is a permissible,

States have historically done both,

have -they not, as a matter ©f public policy?
MR. FREEMAN:

I believe that is lately historically

accurate, Your Honor, but I do not think that the fact that
it occurs vitiates or denies th® rationality underlying
childbearing with respect to—
Q

Either is a rational policy from the point of

view of state policy, I would presume.

At least each has

historically been followed at one time or another by on©
nation or another; is that not true?
MR. FREEMANs
Q

Yes, I believe.

Suppose, Mr. Freeman, that there, were no

hospitals in the State of Missouri and in the City of St. Louis
except those maintained by public authority so that there was
a monopoly.

Would you suggest that all thos«i hospitals could

refuse under any circumstances to have abortions performed?

11
MR. FREEMAN:

I think you force me to the logical

position that that is probably right’—
Q

That they could refuse?

MR. FREEMAN:
Honor.

They could refuse abortione Your

But I believe in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's

question, there is another facet of the intellectual infesti™
gation that is required, and that is here you have not only
the interest of a woman in one disposition or the other; you
have the interest of a child.
constitutionally recognized..

These certainly must be
And it is dependant upon that

choice of the woman.
Th© state is certainly, I would suggest, entitled
to recognize these interests in childbearing where they are
non-existent in abortion.
Q

Do you not implicitly recognize the right to

be treated in a public hospital
believe you do in your brief,

when you point out, as I
that in Hospital No. 2 there are

no barriers; is that right?
MR. FREEMAN:

No, Your Honor.

If you gathered that

from my brief, I gave th© Court a wrong impression.
Q

Do th® same barriers exist in both hospitals?

MR. FREEMAN;

Let me'detail a little of th® facts in

explanation or answer to your question.

In a political

campaign in a mayoral election in St. Louis, this question
emerged.

And both the existing mayor at the time and his

12
successor, who is one of the petitioners in this case, both
stated that they were opposed to abortions, a political
platform in their ©lection,,

They made that statement publicly

and broadly.
In the merits of this case the evidence showed in
ferial that the physicians of the city hospitals were unaware
of this position of both the previous mayor and the mayor in
existence at the time of the trial, at both hospitals; there
is no evidence that the physicians at. Hospital No. 2 knew
anything about the city hospital policy, and certainly

ther©

is positive expressed evidence by the physicians themselves
that they knew nothing about the policy in this particular

rase.
Q

The policy was the same in both hospitals ? I

thought that was the question.
MR. FREEMAN:

When I tried to fairly answer fch©

question, Your Honor—
Q

Yes or no.

MR. FREEMAN:

—there was no insinuation of the

policy by direct action ©f the mayor down to the operative
level in either of the hospitals.

But there was certainly an

adopted position by the mayor which was known to fch® chief
administrator of the hospital but non©theless unkown to the
operating physicians.
Q

But is it. not true that in Hospital No. 2 the

13
rule Weis not as strict as it was in Hospital No» 1?
MR. FREEMAN;

I cannot answer that, Your Honor,

There ware no abortions performed, to my knowledge, in
Hospital No, 2.
Q

None?

MR. FREEMAN;

None that 1 know of, no, sir.

I think

I might further enlarge on that answer by 3aying City Hospital
No. 2 is largely staffed by persons of Spanish or Portuguese—
Q

No, it has been a Negro hospital 29 years ago.

MR. FREEMAN;

That is right, Your Honor, but I am

talking about their physicians there now.

And you have a

Moslem and Catholic situation at City Hospital No. 2 that you
do not have th©—that influence.

But, on the other hand,

St. Louis University provides the physicians, the chiefs of
staff, at City Hospital No. 1.
Q

Then is it fair fc© infer from what you said

that neither hospital as a hospital had a policy but depended
upon th© views of the staff?

And in both hospitals

apparently the staff had views had views--’•moral or religious
views—that mad® them object to performing non-therapeutic
abortions ? is that correct?
MR. FREEMAN;
Hospital No. 1.

1 can certainly answer for City

I ara trying my best from hearsay and so forth

about City Hospital No. 2 because that was not litigated, nor
did we investigata it in the trial at all, City Hospital No. 2.

14
Q

But did City Hospital No. 1 have an official

hospital policy?
MR. FREEMAN;

Yes , it did.

But, as 1 stated, it.

did not get down to physicians, and the policy itself is
subject to the interpretation, as the mayor testified in the
trial, that it is an ultimate question for the physician to
determine whether the woman's life or her health is in danger.
Q

But both the hospital and th© staff in Hospital

No. 1 presumably had a practice and & rule that they followed
of not performing non-therapeutic abortions.
MR. FREEMAN;
Q

That is clear in this case, is it not?

MR. FREEMAN:
Q

That is right, Your Honor.

That is clear, yes.

What is the hospital apart from, its staff?

Doctors can perform the abortion? is that not right?
MR. FREEMAN;

Administration is another level, Your

Honor„
Q

But they cannot perform abortion.

MR. FREEMAN:
Q

No, no.

I meant t© illustrate—

What th© doctors individually decide is .an

individual decision of the physician, I thought you had told
us earlier.
MR. FREEMAN;
Q

That is right.

That is right.

If they all decide the same way, does that make

it a policy of th® hospital?

15

MRo FREEMAN:

I would say 'chat it would coincide

with the policy of the hospital in this casa»

But 1 would not.

think it would be the causative factor of the policy of the
hospital because the city recognises the right of each
physician to make up his own mind and practice medicine
according to his own lights, at least to the extent of not
providing abortions.
Q

Does this record show that there

is any

doctor who was excluded from the staff because he would
perform abortions,, elective abortions so-called?
MR. FREEMANs
till fclie time of trial.

No, Your Honor.

There was not up

Now, to be fair on that question, I

understand since the Eighth Circuit declared that the city had
th© right, there were two successive

physicians that volun­

teered their services for a part-time and did perform a
limited number of abortions.

But they left the staff after

that, and my understanding now is thf.it there are no physicians
that will perform abortions, and that it is contracted out to
a private facility.
This Court has recognised a limited privacy right
of abortion and an absence of state power in the abortion
context, but it did not diminish or degrada society’s
historical role in childbearing, nor did it create opposition
or make any connection between childbearing and abortion.
The woman, th© Court taught., does have an absolute

16
constitutional right to abortion, but the woman's constitu­
tional—does not have, I meant to say—and it is related to
her privacy interest and admits only of a limited right in
abortion.

Realisation of her interest, this privacy right

in abortion, occurs in a medics?! context in relation to her
life or her health.

Abortion determination is essentially &

medical decision made by her physician for her life and health
and in privacy.

But in childbearing, the opposite is the

case; where a woman is not in the abortion, that is, she has
determined to bear children, whether she is pregnant at the
time or not or antecedent or postpregnancy, she is in a
totally different continuum that exists.

No abortion decision

or legal considerations arise for her or the state.

The

putative child’s interest emerges, and it would seem to be
vary constitutionally considerable by the state.
The interest of the child would seam to emerge as a
fundamental factor where the woman makes her election to enter
childbearing or childbirth.
•There is a perfect harmony that emerges that can at
least be contemplated between the various interests.

The

mother, she is interested in the situation with respect to
herself.

The child certainly, the putative child.

The

father as a husband at least.

And the community, state, and

nation emerges at this point.

All of these legal relations

are perfectly accommodated to one another and without friction

17
or opposition to on© another»
Q

At all times, Mr. Freeman?

MR. FREEMAN:

There can be situations? of course?

Your Honor? postulated where maybe the father of the child
has no desire or
Q

legal relationship to the child.

I was thinking of those occasions when, as

there ar@ some? when the mother’s health is endangered and
then the physician and the patient have to make a decision
as between the two interests.

So, I am merely asking whether

at all times what you are saying is true.
MR. FREEMAN:

Your Honor, if I understand your

question accurately, I would say that ray statement still
holds true because once the woman has made fch© decision not
fe© be aborted, that she has elected for childbearing, all the
considerations of health and s© forth, are abstracted from her
situation.

The interest now lies in protecting her health

in childbearing sad the child that she is bearing and everyone
associated with her, including the state.
Q

If the decision is the other way, then what?

MR. FREEMAN:

That is what I am trying to illus­

trate, that you ar@ in a totally different context or con­
tinuum where the woman has mad© an abortion decision
inconsistent with this Court's -teachings—
Q

Let us get away from the woman.

The physician

has advised it because her health, her life, will be in

18
danger.

All I am trying to point out is, in contradistinc­

tion to your general statement, that sometimes the interests
of the mother, the child, the father, are not always
compatible, are they?
MR. FREEMAN:

Your Honor, 3.' may not be apprehending

the thrust of your question.

But, as I see it or what 1 am

trying to say to the Court, that where the woman has made the
©lection for childbearing, whether it. is a threat to her
health or not, different interests emerge that are compatible,
whereas he has made the election, albeit within the teachings
of the Court, the medical decision, but ultimately she is not
going to be operated on unless she consents to it—in that
sense that ultimate choice, there is a world of difference
between abortion and childbearing, and these other interests
irresistibly emerge in childbearing that do not emerge in
abortion.
Q

How about where it was an accident?

MR. FREEMAN;
Q

You know.

MR. FREEMAN:

An accident in what way. Your Honor?
[Laughter]
That is the way I thought, you meant«

The woman still must make the election.

She still must

determine—
Q

She makes the election and sh@ goes to the

Hospital No. 1, and you say no.
MR, FREEMAN:

Am 1 right?

Your Honor is taking me into the

19
context of another, situation.

I was trying to illustrate

not the—
G

Ara I right that if it was an accident and she

goes to Hospital No. 1 and she explained this accident, she
does not get an abortion?
MR. FREEMAN;
Q

And if she was raped, the same would be true?

MR. FREEMAN;
Q

She does not get an abortion, no.

You do not see a thing wrong with that?

MR. FREEMAN:
that point.

That is right, Your Honor.

I have not. developed my argument to

But I believe that bears and can be axplained in

terms of Equal Protection.
Q

Does not your argument end up there, whichever

way you go?
MR. FREEMAN;

No, it does not, Your Honor.

It. goes

further than that.
Q

You are going to make exceptions for that?

MR. FREEMAN:

No.

The abortion question I see is

in a totally different universe than the question of child­
bearing.
Q

This is a childbearing of a child that is the

result of a rape, and you say that the government is interested
in that.
MR. FREEMAN:

Yes, I believe so, Your Honor.

As a commentary

or

the situation of the difference

20
between abortion and childbearing, the time continuum of the
several interests existent

in

childbearing commences and

continues since before conception until adulthood of the
child, which certainly is not the case in the question of
abortione

You have fch© marriage, family health and counseling

for the wife, parental car®, medical and social, GYN and
obstetrical care, birth, pediatric,

postpartum, medical,

and social services, educational formation of the child,
moral training, school, formal school, and ultimately
citizenship, that all revolve and are intimately connected
with childbearing that are abstracted from the abortion
question„
The Court of Appeals concluded that equivalency
exists between abortion and childbearing»

And this, I believe,

results from an erroneous viewing that childbearing and
abortion ar© surgical procedures»

They both admittedly ar©

surgical procedures, but that does not lead to the conclusion
of the general equivalency.

Factually and legally I believe

that such a view is too limited and inaccurate.
Legally this Court has said that the nature of a
woman4 s constitutional right is essentially a m@di.cal decision
by a personal physician, confined to matters that relate to
her life or health.

This Court has showed concern for a

woman's life and health by insistence that her welfare be
determined by a freely acquired, totally independent

21
professional medical judgment.

It d:.d not: say--

MR. chief JUSTICE BURGER:

Your time is consumed

now, Mr. Freeman.
MR. FREEMAN:

I thank you, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Susman., whenever you

are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK SUSMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SUSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1973 this Court in Roe v. Wade and Doe

Bolton

recognized for the entire nation the constitutional right
of a woman to terminate a pregnancy.

In the succeeding four

years since that decision enormous benefits have accrued fc©
the 'women of this country and, for ©.sample, the rates of
septic abortion, illegal abortion, infant mortality through
the use of amniocentesis, maternal mortality, and other
comparable rates have all dropped precipitously.
there

And yet

has been one segment of the female population of this

country which has not benefited nor been allowed to share in
these advantages that have come to pass, a.nd that of course is
the indigent female.

This has occurred through two basic

reasons.
On© is the restriction on Medicaid payments, which
occupied this Court's time this morning and part of this

22

afternoon in regard to the cases arising from the jurisdic­
tions of Pennsylvania and Connecticut.

And the second

encumbrance from the public sector has bean the foreclosure
of public hospitals.

To date less than 25 percent of the

public hospitals in this country offer.- the procedure of
abortion.

And this segment of society, the indigent female,

who has not been allowed to share in the advantages of this
Court’s decisions in 1973, contribute in large part to the
fact--Q

By public hospitals you mean the govern-

mentally operated hospitals that serve indigent patients?
MR. SUSMAN:

For the purposes of this case, public

hospitals tended to include only those basically owned by the
government and operated by them.

They do not include those

which w® sometimes call semiprivate or semipublic,

They do

not include sectarian institutions.
Q

These are government owned and/or operated

hospitals that serve indigent patients?
MR. SUSMAN;
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

Is your 25 percent figure for public hospitals

or all hospitals?
MR, SUSMAN;

Public hospitals.

This segment of society that we are discussing, the
indigent female, is the largest portion of that group which
contributes to the fact that—

23
Q

Would the particular problem of public hospitals

go away if the Social Security- Act or Medicaid required the
payment for abortions?
MR. SUSMAN:

No, it would not because tie reasons

that have foreclosed the public hospitals from providing
abortions in the City of St. Louis have nothing to do with
whether or not they will be reimbursed by Medicaid.

And, in

fact, the State of Missouri is presently under court order
to do so as in regard of Singleton v, Wulff.
Q

If a state was going to participate in Medicaid,

what if it was required to pay for abortions?
MR. SUSMAN:
Q

if it were required to offer abortions—

Yes.

MR. SUSMAN:

-—then as to what the policy of the

hospitals —
Q

Then your problem would go away or not?

MR. SUSMAN:

I ara'not sure because I do not know

how the city would respond.

They might decide not; to partici­

pate in the program.
Q

This would be just cities.

I suppose by a state

statute the state legislature decides whether to participate,
does it not?
MR. SUSMAN:
Q

That is correct.

How has the city responded to the decision, of

the Court of Appeals in this case?

24
MR. SUSMAN :

Since the second reversal by the

Eighth Circuity they have been performing abortions.
Q

In the hospitals or by contracting them out,

as your brother said?
MR. SUSMAN:

Initially started by performing the

procedures within the hospital facilities themselves but only
within City 1.

They have never offered abortions at City 2.

Then there was a period of time in which they had
some difficulties, whether for reasons of their own or
otherwise, I will not go into and the record does not
support; but. they stopped.
physicians.

They had some reasons--procuring

And during that period of time, they contracted

out with a private, not-for-profit tax-exempt facility, which
is basically a clinic doing abortion procedures and nothing
else.

That also came to an end.

And, as we stand here today,

the City of St. Louis has reinstitutad in City Hospital No. 1
its own program dor doing abortion procedures,
Q

What about No. 2?

MR. SUSMAN:

Number 2 has never done abortion

abortion procedures and has no plans to do so.

If a woman

shews up at City 2—and, as you pointed out, Mr. Justice,
that basically serves, the black area of the City of St. Louis—
Q

It always has.

MR. SUSMAN:
question about it.

Always has.

That is correct.

No

She is referred to City Hospital No. 1

25
for the treatment.
Q

Do you make any separate complaint, of the fact,

Mr. Susman, that abortions even under ‘the Eighth Circuit
mandate ar© avallab1© only at Hospital No. 1 and not at
Hospital No,. 2?
MR. SOSMAN;

No, we do not.

I do not think that

because there is a constitutional obligation of the city
through its public hospitals to provide abortions that that
means they must do them at every hospital facility, assuming
there is not some great inconvenience.

I also do not

personally believe -that they could not fulfill this constitu­
tional obligation by in fact contracting out with a private
facility.

I do not think you have a constitutional right to

on-site procedures.

I think their contracting out during

this period of time we were previously discussing was in fact
constitutional and did comply with the order of tie Eighth
Circuit.
It is this segment of society, the indigent female,
which is the largest group and has contributed greatly to the
fact that the illegitimacy rate in the City of St. Louis is
presently 46 percent.

One out of every two births is now

illegitimate in the city.
The poor segment of society has always utilized the
city hospitals as their sole source ©f receiving medical
assistance, and the poor have neither the economic means nor

26
the sophistication feo seek out a broad x*ange of Radical
services, and they never hav®.

The public hospital stands

as the exclusive provider of medical services, the delivery
of medicine, physicians, facilities, and related services.
And yet, as this case demonstrates clearly and as the record
showed, the public hospitals are the subject of political
vagaries.

They have become involved in the political campaigns

for mayor and for lessor offices in die City of Sfc„ Louis.
This is not a case, as the petitioners attempted to
state it, where we are seeking to imply that every woman has
& right to an abortion at the public hospitals.

tfe do not

believe that there is an abligation of the state to furnish
the exorcise of any fundamental right, and clear1/ abortion
has been held by this Court to be such a fundamental right.
We do not believe, for example, that there would be
a constitutional right, a requirement,for the pub Lie hospitals
of the City of St. Louis to offer maternity care.
merely s.n Equal Protection argument.

It is

That if they offer

maternity care, then they also must offer the procedure of
abortion.
Q

So, your whole constitutional argument is

bottomed on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, is it?
MR. SUSMAN;
sir, it is.

In larga and almost exclusively, yes,

This case really is merely a plea that the badge

27
of indigency not be used as some type of financial bludgeon
to coerce the indigent to submit to the religious and moral
philosophies of those in political control and those who
manipulate the medical and financial dole.
Q

In comparison with whom ar© your- clients being

denied equal protection?
MR. SUSMAN: Those indigent women, eligible for care
at the city hospitals, who elect and wish to carry the
pregnancies to term.
Q

That is just a comparison between indigent,

I take it.
MR. SUSMAN:

This case is basically the class of

indigents.
Q

Yes, but indigency doss not make the difference.

MR. SUSMAN:

I do not believe it does, although

the Eighth Circuit saw that as an additional Equal Protection
denial.
Q

Do you see it as discrimination as between two

classes of pregnant, indigent women, do you?
MR. SUSMAN;
Q

Although the plaintiffs —

And one class gets medical care at the city

hospital if they give birth or if they have a miscarriage,
and th© other class of pregnant women does not get care at
the city hospital if they want to have an abortion.
th© two classes'?

Are those

28
MR. SUSMAN:

I do not believe they are, Your Honor»

I do not believe that the requirement of indigency really
affects a class.
Q

They are all indigent.

The universe is

indigent women or they would not be at the public hospital,
as you defined it earlier.
MR. SUSMAN:

That is not necessarily correct.

Those

who go to the public hospitals fox' treatment of any type and
who can afford to pay are billed for the services rendered.
\

Q
question.

Then who are your classes?

1 will repeat my

In comparison with whom are your clients being

denied equal protection of the law?
MR. SUSMAN:

I think to answer that we first have

to identify who the clients are»

I would say that the

clients are the class of pregnant women who desire to
terminate those pregnancies.

And in comparison to them is

the class of pregnant woman who desire to carry those preg­
nancies to term.
Q

Indigent and affluent?

MR. SUSMAN;
Q

Correct.

If they ar© affluent, they can realize.their

desire to have an abortion at the same price as they would have
to pay at the public hospital.
MR. SUSMAN:
Q

More easily, yes.

They would go to the private hospital.

29
MR. SUSMAN%

That is correct.

They have that extra

option .
Q

How can you make that class then?

How can you

put them in your class?
MR. SUSMAN:

Because I think there is still the

Equal Protection denial, regardless of whether or not they
are indigent.
Q

Hen?? is the millionaire person, female, denied

any protection if sh@ goes to a private hospital in Switzer­
land and has an' abortion?

She cannot be in the same

category, can she, with the indigent?
MR. SUSMAMs

I think there is clearly an extra

argument for the indigents.

I think that is an extra

argument for denial and a separate basis of denial of equal
protection.

But I think any woman, whether indigent or

prosperous, has a right to equal treatment at the city
hospital.
Q

Do you need that?

MR. SUSMANs

As a purist legally, yes.

As a

practical matter, no.
Q

Do you need that to win?

MR. SUSMAM %
Q

No, Your Honor.

I am really confused now.

What comparison do

you want us to make now?
MR. SUSMAM:

I am asking for a comparison between

30
those woman, regardless of their economic means, who have a
right to treatment at the city hospital, who are pregnant
and desire to terminate as opposed to those women, who,
regardless of means, have a right to treatment at city
hospital and desire to carry t© term.
Q

When you say right to treatment, do you mean

right to treatment under the practices of the city hospital?
MR. SUSMANs

And the charter in

the operation of

the institution, yes.
Q

And the charter.

A parson who can pay will

be treated, but they will collect from him.
MR. SUSMAN:

That is correct.

That has always been

the practice, regardless of the treatment.
Q

What you are saying is 'that the City of

St. Louis as a governmental entity cannot maintain a hospital
which declines fc© perform abortions.
MR. SUSMAN;

Provided they perform simultaneously

the full range of maternity services.
although

And many public hospitals

not in the City of St. Louis but throughout this

country, there are many public hospitals that do not have any
maternity departments whatsoever, but; they have closed them
down for a variety of reasons.

Our legal theory would not

allow us to bring a ease against such & public hospital and
demand that they offer abortion procedures if they do not
simultaneously offer the treatment of maternity and delivery.

31
Q

Mr. Susman, you. say that you want your clients

to be freed from the prejudices and moral judgments of the
majority.

And yefc if v® sustain your argument here, if that

majority in St. Louis City or St. Louis County, whatever,
feels strongly enough about it, they can simply cut off the
rendering of any sort of maternity service.
MR. SUSMAN:
Q

That is correct.

Could they cut out just furnishing any kind of

maternity services without payment but still furnish the
service if somebody could pay?
MR. BUSMAN;
.Q

Y©s, I believe they could.

Is there any First Amendment issue in this

case, or has there ever been?
MR. SUSMAN s

I think there is a First Amendment

issue, but it has not been raised.
previous abortion cases

„

It has been raised in many

and no court to date, to my knowledge,

has seen fit to recognise it but always choosing other
alternative grounds, and for that reason it was not raised»
It is clearly there lurking.
Q

But if it is not raised, we perhaps are not

permitted really to look at your argument about the religious
views of the majority in the community and that sort of thing.
MR. SUSMAN:

That is true, but I have net raised

such arguments, Your Honor.
Q

You mentioned them in passing at least.

32
MR» SUSMAN;

The only religious view involved here,

or moral view, is that of petitioner Poelker, who testified
at trial that the only reason for the imposition of the policy
of his edict that there be no abortions performed in the
public hospitals of the City of St.» Louis was that in his
personal belief abortion is murder»

He further testified

that he had never made any investigations or studies whatsoever
as to whether they had feh© necessary facilities, whether the
personnel there was willing to do it, whether they could
offer them, what th© effect would b© on other services offered,
whether there was any possibility of contracting out with a
private facility to do them»
or study»

He never made any investigations

He had a sole reason, and that was he thought it

was murder, and that is why he issued th© edict.
Contrary to the statements of my broth©:;’ counsel,
two of th© four physicians who examined and treat*id and talked
with Jane Doe when she appeared on her visits to the City
Hospital, two of the four clearly stated to her that the
hospital policy would not allow it to b@ done there.

All four

©f th© physicians are students, classing them together.
were students, two were actually physicians at the time.

Two
All

four testified that ‘they had personal moral beliefs against
providing the procedure.

On® of the doctors, the on© in

charge, the chief resident ©f OB/GYN, even refused to giv© to
Jan© Doe a statement as to th© existence of her pregnancy so

33
that she could take the statement elsewhere and seek relief.
He would not even give her such a statement.

He said that

was his policy, never to give statements of pregnancy to any
woman who desired c*n abortion.
All of these parsons, whether students or physicians,
ar© associated with St. Louis University, which tie trial court
itself stated clearly, and there was no dispute, that it was a
Catholic university.

But the trial court further stated that

no one associated with that university would ever perform an
abortion.

In fact, it was introduced into evidence—and it

appears in the record—that the faculty manual, St. Louis
University, prohibits anybody associated with the university
doing an abortion.

And a Jesuit so testified.

And that if

you did such a procedure, you would be subject to loss of
appointment, contract, and tenure for doing so.
Q

What if in fact in a small town all of the doc­

tors in the public hospital had those religious beliefs.

Do

you think feh© Constitution compels the city to compel the:®
to perform abortions?
MR. SUSMAMs

Absolutely not.

And I would be the first

feo come here and defend any individual physician's right—
nux'se’s or

orderly5s—to refuse on their personal religious

and moral, grounds to participate in such a procedure which
violates their religious principles.
Q

Then where would you end up in that kind of

34
hypothetical case, where the only people on the hospital
staff and the only competent people they can gat on tha
hospital staff have those religious beliefs?
MR. SUSMAN:

I think there has to be--and the word

"reasonable" gets tossed around so much with lawyers and
judges”“but I think there has to be reasonable efforts to
procure the services of individuals who do not share those
personally held beliefs.
Q

Mo, ray hypothesis is those reasonable efforts

have been mads and they cannot find anybody competent who is
willing to work in that hospital as doctors on tha staff who
do not hold those religious beliefs.
MR. SUSMAN:

Than you &r® weighing in tie balance,

in my opinion, the choice of compelling a physician to do
this procedure which he is personally opposed to lor religious
or moral reasons as against, on the other side of the balance,
compelling the woman who wants the abortion to travel some
indeterminate distance to procure it elsewhere.

And putting

•those two in the balance, in my opinion, it would weigh in
favor of the physician who does not want to participate.

She

must travel.
Q

Or the town has a constitutional duty to

subsidize the travel of the woman; is that it?
MR. SUSMAN;

That is also a realistic possibility.

But I would again point out here that ever sine® the Eighth

35
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in this case, the city has
been furnishing this procedure, has been able to find
physicians because they have gotten them from Washington
University, which is a non-sectarian institution.

In fact,

Washington University has always maintained its own clinic,
which does outpatient terminations of pregnancy.

They could

not provide the physicians before because. St. Louis University
was contracted to provide all OB/GYN services.

Obviously you

are playing with a stacked deck, or you were in the past.
Q

Mr„ Susman, you seem to me to have

admitted

that if the deck were stacked by the physicians's religious
and moral convictions, that would be permissible.

But when

you look at the mayor’s and supervisors’ moral convictions,
you say that is intolerable even to consider it as a factor.
MR. SUSMAN:

I think the mayor is entitled to his

personal opinions»

H© does not have to participate in any

abortion decision.

But ha does not have the right by ©diet

to forbid the performance of abortions within the public
hospital institutions.
Q

If it is a complete justification for the

doctor, why is it not a factor that: might be considered by the
hospita1 adminisfcration?
MR. SUSMAN?

This was not a factor considered by

the administration.
Q

I thought you said the whole reason for it was

36
their religious and. moral opposition to abortions.
MR. SUSMAN:
Q

Of the physicians because—•

Maybe I misunderstood you.

I thought the

mayor himself was opposed on moral and religious grounds.
MR. SUSMAN:

That is correct.

Perhaps I do not

understand your question.
Q

It seems to me that if that is a legitimate

consideration for a doctor, why is it not also at least a
legitimate—maybe it should not be contro 1 ling--but at least
a legitimate consideration for another government repre­
sentative?
MR. SUSMAN:

Because I can draw a vast distinction

between the opinion of a doctor who must participate in the
actual procedure and perform it as opposed to the mayor having
his private beliefs.

He does not have to participate in it.

He can believe anything he wants.

Nobody is asking him to

participate or perform one.
Q

let us say that these are private strongly

held beliefs that he has publicised and on the basis of which
h® has been elected t© office to run the hospitals by a
majority of the people.
MR. SUSMAN;

I do not believe that that is a legiti­

mate reason or rational© for the government or the City of
St. Louis in this case to justify the deprivation of women's
constitutional rights to an abortion, as stated by this Court

37
in Roe and Do®.

First of ali, I think the standard is clear

that w@ are talking about a compelling state interest, and the
moral beliefs of the mayor do not, in my mind, constitute a
compelling state interest.
Q

Mr. Busman, what do we have in this record to

show exactly—is there anything in writing about this policy?
MR. BUSMAN;

It was admitted.

There was no question

that the policy—
Q

My question was, Is there anything in writing—

MR. BUSMAN:
Q

-“written down?

MR. SUSMAN:
Q

No.

No, it was not.

It was not an ordinance, it was nor a regulation

of the hospital?
MR. SUSMAN:

It was not an ordinance.

It was not

a hospital regulation.
Q

There is nothing written.

MR. BUSMAN:
Q

No, sir.

And the edict you say that the mayor issued,

is that in the record?
MR. SUSMAN:
was.

It is in quotations as to what the edict

No, that is not in the record.

There is testimony from

the mayor that he did issue such an order to his co-defendant
petitioner. Dr. Wochner, who is Commissioner of Hospitals and
testified that he would have wanted, to perform the procedures

33
and thought, they ought to be performed but could not because
of the mayor who appointed him and—
Q

What I am trying to get is just what do w© sat

aside that the city did?
MR. SUSMAN%
Q

I think there are two things.

We set aside the fact that two employees

refused to do the job—four employee?; is that right?
MR. SUSMAN:

I think it becomes less a question of

setting aside than taking feh® tack chosen by the Eighth
Circuit and imposing an affirmative duty upon the petitioners
to allow and to provide the necessary facilities and
personnel and resources on a comparable basis as they are
provided for those who choose maternity.
I think there is some serious question as to whether
the edict, for lack of a better word, of the mayor or the
petitioner Poelker in this case really had much legal
substance.
Q

That is exactly what I am talking about.

if that has no legal substance, what do we do?

So,

We enjoin

these four people from doing it?
MR. SUSMAN:
Q

I see they have gone by now.

MR. SUSMAN:
Q

No.

Yes.

They have graduated, have they not?

MR. SUSMAN:

Two of the students have graduated.

39

Q

Normally we have an ordinance we declare

unconstitutional.
state agency.

We have a statute or we have an order of a

Here I am trying to find out what was done by

the state that was wrong.
MR. SUSMAN:

Ignoring for the moment the legality

or the illegality of the mayor’s edict, the record clearly
demonstrates that the co-petitioner, Dr. Wochner, relied upon
it in not providing abortions, which he chose to do were it
not for the ©diet.

So, number one, I think that petitioner

Wochner can be directed to ignore this edict, legal or
illegal, and be allowed to proceed to offer these procedures,
that physicians b® obtained as they have been since November
of 1974, several months after the Eighth Circuit ruled, and
they have been providing these procedures.
Q

What case do we have that is like this?

We

have an amorphous thing up here that everybody admits and all.
We do not get jurisdiction by consent between parties.
MR. SUSMANs

I understand that, but what we do have

are the uncontroverted facts that abortions have never been
performed in th© City Hospitals of St. Louis.

We also have the

uncontroverted fact -that there were two things that prevented
these abortions from being provided, and one was the mayor's—
Q

This was in one hospital you are talking about.

MR. SUSMAN:
Q

The edict applied to both.

I thought you said there-was-nothing in this

40

record

about two, and it was not in the case.
MR. SUSMAN;

There was no evidence as to the practice

of two because there was only one identifiable named plaintiff,
and sh© only went to City Hospital No. 1.

But the mayores

edict, the record shows, applied to both hospitals.

The

staffing procedure only applied to City Hospital No. 1» that
hospital at which Jan© Do© appeared and attempted to procure
the medical services desired by her.
Q

Are the doctors in the city hospital in

St. Louis stair.® officers under the laws of Missouri?
MR. SUSMAN:

I do not believe they are.

They are

employees, independent contractors—
Q

I said, are they state officers?

MR. SUSMAN:
Q

In quotes.

MR. SUSMAN:
Q

I do not believe they are.

1 do not believe they aref Your Honor.

Sc, where do you get your state addon?

MR. BUSMAN:

State action comes not in the individual

practices of those physicians but again through the mayor's
policy and, number two, the staffing procedure which allows it
to be staffed in such a manner that you will never have a
physician who does not have moral principles against performing
abortions.

The state action is not in the individuals who

actually comprise the staff but the policy of the state that
allows it to be staffed in such a fashion.

It is the staffing

41
policy that was attacked, not the staff p©r se.

And that

policy clearly is state action.
Again the petitioner Poelker never offered any
justification, nor was there any in the record, nor has
counsel indicated any in argument, other than the mayor's
personal beliefs that resulted in this policy that presently
exists.
I do not think there is much reason to devote much
time to the issue of standing, which is one of the other
three issues in this case,because I think that is clearly
decided under the prior decisions of this Court.
I would briefly mention the attorneys' fee issue.
Although counsel did not have time to argue it orally, I would
suggest that, all of the arguments included in their brief
ar© completely undercut and obviated by the recent passage of
Public Law 94-559, allowing for attorneys' fees under the
original appellate court theory of private attorney* general.
I think under the•holding ©f Bradley v. Richmond School
District it is retroactive.

I think the legislative history

which we furnished to the Court by reference in a latter
updating our brief shows that it was intended to be refcroi

active.

There have been two decisions to date,

one by the

Northern District of Mississippi, on December 14 , 1976., and
one by the United States Court of Appeals, the Eighth Circuit,
last Thursday, January 6th, both holding in fact that this

42
public law is retroactive.
Q

If you win.

MR. SUSMAN:

Correct.

Absolutely.

Prevailing party

only.
Q

Then you are concerned with fees only in the

District Court?
MR. SUSMAN:

And in the Appellate Court.

They

were awarded at both levels.
Q

Ware they finally ordered in both levels?

MR. SUSMAN:

They were, Your Honor.

In fact, the

Appellate Court fees were awarded first, and then it was
remanded to the District Court for awarding of counsel fees.
So, chronologically the appellat© fees came first.
of these fees

All

presently now in the registry of the court

have been paid in.
In conclusion, while it is true that the policies
of the petitioners have not totally foreclosed abortions for
0

women of low and marginal incomes in the City of St. Louis,
the effect upon their access to services has in f act been
devastating.

For no other reasons than the petitioners'

hospital policies, they have been denied the equal protection
in the making of a constitutionally protected choice.

They

have suffered in fact the cruel coercion of financial support
to choose carrying to term although against their desires
and ageiinst in many cases their best, interests of life and

43
health»

To ignore the economic bait forces them to rely

upon -the charity and beneficence of the private medical
sec-tor for assistance, a degrading alternative.
Lastly we would note that to deny the indigent
women the same rights of access to control over their own
reproduction fosters a perpetuation of the cycle of poverty
generation after generation and denies them an opportunity
to ©scape and to rise above the conditions of their environs.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

Thae case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2;43 p.ra., the case was submitted.]
