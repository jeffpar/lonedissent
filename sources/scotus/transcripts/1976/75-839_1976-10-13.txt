MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: We will hear arguments next
in 839. Whalen against Richard Roe» and others.
Mr. Greenwald» you may proceed whenever you*re ready.
OML ARGUMENT OF A. SETH GREENWALD, ESQ. f
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GREENWALD:

Mr. Chief Justi.ce» and may it please

the Court:
This is an appeal from a judgment of the United
States District Court for th© Southern Disstriet of New York»
which declared unconstitutional and enjoined -the operation of
three sections of th® New York Public Health Law» contained
in Article 33 of that law, which deals with controlled
substances» dangerous drugs» arid the like.
Actually» only Section 3332(2){a) is involved,
That is th© provision that requires that on filed official
New York State prescriptions the names and addresses of th©
patients be contained thereon» and be filed with th© New York
State Department of Health» whose Commissioner is th© appellant
herein,
Th© district, court ®njoined this statute on the
basis that 'this provision was an invasion of privacy of the
appellees who are anonymous» basically anonymous patients and
known doctors,
I would allude to 'th© operation of th© other sections»

4
which were enjoined, they require the use of the official
New York State prescription in prescribing these certain
dangerous drugs, and this applies to doctors and pharmacists
in the State of Hew York.
QUESTIONj Does Hew York have any legal requirement
that either the pharmacist in question ©r th® doctor in
question k©ap a record ©f drugs he has prescribed, and that
that record be available for inspection on th© premises?
MR. GREENWM.DS

Basically yes.

As it was in th®

prior law, under this triplicate prescription system, on©
copy of the prescription is kept by the doctor’, if he self
dispenses th® drug, or the pharmacist who fills that
prescription. So, therefore, th® doctor or pharmacist does
have to keep these records, and the statute so provides „ for
a period of five years? has to keep these records —
QUESTION s Did your opponents challenge th®
constitutionality of the requirement that that record be
©pen for inspection?
MR. GREENWALDs

No, and indeed th© district court,

in one of its prior decisions, I think in the decision that
resulted in the judgment, stated that th® appellees conceded
th® constitutionality of th® prior requirement of law.
I would only point out, of course, that not being in
issue, that provision ©r requirement not being in issue,
certainly at this time, if nothing ©Is®, it's presumed

5
constitutional, it's not at issue in this c&s®.
Now, —
QUESTION t

And the name of the patient would be

disclosed under the prior law, wouldn’t it?
MR. GREENWALDs
QUESTIONS

Oh, yes, of ecusrse.

It would foa on the prescription.

MR. GREENWALD;

Right.

The name of the patient.,

under the prior lav/, and this is at least for forty years,
was available to the New York State Department of Health.
QUESTIONs

Upon demand.

MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION;

Upon demand, or,, basically, the -~

Or periodic inspection.

MR. GREENWALDs

Periodic inspection of pharmacists’

file, prescription records.
QUESTION;

But it wasn’t automatically filed in a

computer in Albany.
MR. GREENWALD;

Well, I would say that all the law,

of course, requires is that it be each month, one copy be
filed or sent up to the Department of Health in Albany.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GREENWALD:

I would, at this point, like to

point out the computerisation is not a requirement of the
lav/, it’s an administrative operation.
QUESTION:

Yes, I understand.

But that, in practical effect, was the difference

6

between the old law and the present lav/ being attacked
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTIONs

Well, —

<— part of the present law that's being

attacked?
MR. GREENWALDs

Yes.

I think the requirement for

filing and, I think, at this point, what was the purpose for
filing of triplicate prescriptions.
QUESTION!

Yes„

QUESTIONS Does New York have & statute requiring
gunshot wounds to be reported by physicians?
MR. GREENWALDs
QUESTIONS

Oh, yes. They have a —

Has that been passed on by the Court of

Appeals of New York?
MR. GREENWALDs

I'm not aware, but I believe that it

has the general variety of medical reporting statutes, such
as gunshot wounds, venereal disease, contagious diseases, and
the like, and I don't believe they have ever been filed,
because it's rather obvious that they serve a public health
need.

As does this filing statute also.
And this is the question of purpose.
Now,
QUESTION:

isn't it?

That’s the whole point in the eas®,

As to whether it does.
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

Well, I think that the —

I don't think the other side agrees with

7
that.
MR. GREENWALDs

Y@s.

I think that the purpose is rather* obvious.

No. 1,

it's only for a certain type of dangerous and habit-forming
drugs, but it’s called the Schedule II drugs, which have been
found to b© forming psychologically dependent attitudes and
the like.

It does not cover fch® whole spectrum of prescription

prescribing.

The State of New York is not engaging in some

wholesale supervision of the practice of medicine. We don't
even know what ailments are involved her®.
It only concerns narcotic and amphetamine type drugs,
where the danger for abuse of the public health, or danger
to the public health is the greatest.
Now, it has been conceded in the decision, I think
my adversaries — that abuse and diversion of these type of
drugs from legitimate channels is a serious problem? and,
indeed, there is a serious problem in this area of mis­
application of what I'd say medical principles, a lot of
these drugs are prescribed by doctorsp

studies have been

made,for quasi-medical uses, for rather fallacious reasons.
And, further, I would submit that..— and I think it's
rather obvious — that inclusion of the names and addresses
on -the filed prescriptions do assist in deterring and exposing
prescriptions which are not within the law.
investigations

They assist in

8

And in this area, the State of New York is exercising
its police power in the interest of the public health and
safety.

It is regulating the us® of dangerous drugs,, those

which are habit-forming, which has, for over fifty years,
sine© I cite the Whipple v. Martinson case, been recognised
by this Court as clearly within a State’s power.

Vast

discretion in the control of this iyp© of dangerous drug.
QUESTION;

Mr. Greenwald, so that I may be sure,

you’re taking the position that if you didn’t have the nam®s
and addresses, the State could not effectively do what it

wants to do under the statute?
MR. GREENWALD;
clear and obvious.

That is quite — that is quit©

Even from the decision below".

It tried

to explain av/ay the reasons for names and addresses on, I would
say, a basis of a number of fallacious assumptions.

And I

would say, of course, it was the true primary purpose, perhaps,
of the filing, to identify a patient going from doctor to
doctor and receiving, say, ©van from one or more doctors, an
over thirty-day supply? but that was not the only purpose.
And I would emphasise that the appellant naver
conceded that it was.
QUESTION;

And I suppose this is to reach doctors

like the late Dr. Moore, whose case we had hare a year or two
ago, who gave prescriptions to people who never came to his
office, h© just gave them out wholesale.

9

MR. GREENWALDs

That, is part of the —

QUESTION? Will this statuta catch that kind of
violation?
MR. GREENWALD?

Quit® clearly , it would catch that

type of violation, and having the names and addresses of that
doctor's patients would be quite valuable in the investigation
of that doctor’s activities.
QUESTION?

And tha record shows you didn’t need

it.
MR. GREENWALD?

I say «

QUESTION? As witness the fact that he’s in jail.
MR. GREENWALD?

Now, the question, I think

I’m

not that well acquainted with the case of Dr. Moor©? but I
would emphasize that the case I do cite, a similar type of
case, did not reach this Court, United States v, Warren.

It

takes months and months of laborious investigation to build a
case against a doctor like this, when some of the activities
of this type of doctor are so well known they are printed up
in the newspapers.
The point being that filing with nantes and addresses,
so we know who are the patients, the supposed patients, you
might say, obviously enables fch© enforcement authorities to
much more quickly bring proceedings against that type of
doctor, to have a fuller pictura of his type of activities,
to better control this illegal activity, and, let’s put it

10

quite bluntly , because this has been the record, to deter
this activity from taking placa, this typ© of medical practice
not within any ethical principias from ever taking place in
the first place.
Now, as I said, we do hav®, and it's rather obvious,
that the problem or feh© situation, I will say the situation
of a patient, it’s a bogus patient basically, going from one
doctor to another to obtain this type of dangerous drug.
If he goes from doctor to doctor, there is really no
;

conceivable way that this type of activity is going to be
©k posed unless you have the patients;’ names and addresses
because you correlate the patients *—
QUESTION:

of course the patient could use a

different name each place.
MR, GREENWALD:

Now, that assumes that that patient,

that patient is going to violate another section of the law.
We have a prohibition against, of course, using false names
or-fraud and deception.

And to just simply assume that that

/

type of person is going to violate one law or two laws, three
laws, I think is simply specious.
QUESTION:

It’s no answer to

Wait a minute.

You mean that a person

that’s addicted to dope is worried about law violations?
MR. GREEMWALD:

I would say the —

MR. GREENWALD:

QUESTIONs They will commit murder for itl
MR. GREENWALD:

My answer to you is that this Court;

a number of years ago held that the condition of being a drug
addict is not a crime.
QUESTIONS

I believe that was in —
But isn't the short answer to the broad

question, that you can’t catch them all, but you're going to
try to catch as many as you can?
MR. GREENWALDs

Well, certainly that’s the case.

We can't assume that ©very single person is going around
using all types of names.

And I would also say that if a

doctor is doing his job, you might say, of practicing medicine*
properly, there are many situations where a patient or a
person coming around to this cannot use a false name.
times these people are on Medicare or Medicaid.
there are other ways to check.

Many

Obviously

The use of a false name would

expose their type of activity even more quickly.
QUESTION:

In Haw York City, the doctor doesn't know

where the patient lives.
MR. GREENWALD:
QUESTION:

Suppose *—

In New York City, believe it or not,

I'll fcak© judicial notice, is not a rural community.
MR. GREENWALD:

I would also state that, when ~~ I'm

from New York City# and that when I go to my doctor, after I
go,; and this is, I think, a typical procedure, a bill is mailed

12
to me.

If that bill didn't get to me, the doctor would be put

on some notice that something's out of touch.
QUESTIONS

Wall, I would imagine that the doctors

you're talking about don't give bills.
MR. GREENWALDs That may b© another thing we would
like to investigate in this case, because '«hat we find a lot
of times is that these doctors who are engaging in this type
of activity don't keep medical records.

Indeed, the triplicate

prescription, with the names and addresses, may h© the only
record of what's going on in this doctor's practice, or socalled practice.
QUESTIONs

These Schedule II drugs are, as I under­

stand it, are various drugs that have a perfectly good
medical and pharmaceutical purpose when properly used and
prescribed for certain given ailments, physical or emotional,
whatever.

But whose use by people who don't need them, or

whose overuse, maybe, by people who do need them, is an. abuse
and can become — can lead to physical or psychological
dependence? is that right?
MR. GREENWALD2

Yes.

QUESTIONS Schedule II drugs are not hard-core
narcotics, ar® they?
MR. GREENWALDs

Well, when you talk about —

Schedule II drugs are, in part, narcotics.

You talk about

hard-core narcotics / ' s treat drugs, such as, say, heroin, that

13

MR. GREENWALDs

Nobody can prescribe that.

MR. GREENWALD;

Yes.

an amphetamine type drug, one which is quite frequent in this
case, is one called Ritalin, which has several uses.

Right.

You didn't say morphine was included?

MR. GREENWALD;
QUESTION;

Morphine, yes.

Morphine is included

As a Title II drug?

MR. GREENWALD;

— as a Title II drug, because

morphine is an opium derivative and habit-forming, and
dangerous.

I thought it was in Title I.

MR. GREENWALD;

No, it’s ~

QUESTIONs Well, let's not argue cibout it.
QUESTION;

Does it make any difference, from your

point of view, on the police power of the State in controlling
any of these drugs?

Is the police power —

MR. GREENWALD;

Well, I think it is clearly within

the police power of the State to control these drugs, and part

15

of the control is the method of distributi dii»

QUESTIONS

To male® it clear to you, for th© balance

of your argument, the purpose of my question was to understand
th© context of ‘this statutory requirement.

We’re not dealing

her© with contraband, as such?
MR, GREENWALD:

No. Basically, and itEs in th©

legislative history, this law is not designed to control
perhaps th© more serious problem of street drugs,
QUESTION? Right,
MR, GREENWALDs This statute is designed to control
or better regulate th© problem of diversion from apparently
legitimate sources.

Now, —
QUESTION:

Mr. Greenwald, on© more question.

If we

affirm h©re, do you feel the existing reporting requirements
as to venereal disease, infectious disease, gunshot wounds,of
your State will be jeopardised?
MR, GREENWALD:

Yes,'"I think quit© seriously they

will be in great jeopardy, and perhaps mors important than —
I think it was my first point about the bad policy of the
finding — finding a doctor-patient relationship, in and of
itself, is a fundamental interest, is that, as I think Your
Honors are all aware, the doctor-patient privilege finds its

16
expression in law in confidentiality as provided for only in
State laws»

New York doss provide for doctor-patient testi­

monial confidentiality.
Now# it was not known# even' at common law# and#
indeed# there ar© many variations on this privilege; and#
furthermore# commentators have criticised the privilege#
b@ca.usca many times it prevents courts from getting

at the

truth.
What should b® emphasised is that it is not necessary
for medical treatment for there to be a confidential relation­
ship between doctor and patient# and I think this ces®
demonstrates that.
There are allegations or# they would say# the record
shows the testimony of the patients that they stopped using
Schedule II because of the filing requirement.
Well# let's look at what happens.

A patient goes

to the doctor# h© tells the doctor what ails him.

The

doctor then makes a diagnosis and determines on a course of
treatment.

In his complete discretion or his decision he may

decide on a Schedule II drug# and only at that point does he
writ® a prescription.

How# I ask you# has the practice of

medicine been interfered with?
The practice of medicine has not. been interfered with
in the thirty years# there's no record of it# in California#
the fifteen years in Illinois# and I think about ten or twelve

17
years in Idaho.

But the saute type of filing mid reporting has

been in fore®.
Nov?, as w@ said. I said that problem or th® situation
of doctor to doctor0
Now, as to patients, the purpose of this statute.
The patients who get from a doctor an over thirty-day supply.
Now, this will more probably be the abuse of the patient by
the doctor.
Now, obviously, we can still printout, as we do, w@
can still printout prescriptions, anonymous prescriptions —
they are as anonymous as ’the patients — that contain over
thirty days’ supply, which is a violation of the law.
However, what we cannot know is, is this one person
receiving multiple prescriptions from the same doctor?
what?

Or

All we can do now is get a list of perhaps a hundred,

a thousand of these type of prescriptions that come through
each month, and send out investigators back to the drug store
to find out who are the patients, to find out which are the
most serious cases of abuse.
!t!s absolutely impossible to do with 24 investigators
r\

in the whole State of New York.
QUESTION? Does New York law prohibit the prescribing
of a more than thirty-day supply of Schedule II drugs?
MR. GREENWALDs

Yes.

Quite specifically, under the

triplicate prescription law, a doctor is limited to prescribing

18

a thirty-day supply with several exceptions, I believe some
of the drugs for children, I believe with Ritalin they may be
able to prescribe a three-month supply. Bub-, basically, there
is a limitation of a thirty-day supply.
In point of fact, the exception for, 1 think, three
months would depend on knowing the age, which w© require to be
reported, and the drug and the patient, for example, to know
whether that was b@ing complied with.
Now, another point or another purpose is that
basically filing of triplicate: prescriptions with patient*s
name heightens the doctor’s awareness of the status of this
patient,

There is, of course, — and it was said that this

law has no application to addicts.

It’s true.

In the sense

that the law prohibits prescribing this type of Schedule II
dangerous drugs to addicts and habitual users.

But how are

we going to know whether -that’s being complied with unless
we know, have som® record of who are receiving them?
Itod another major proble, I submit, is if the names
and addresses are missing from -the filed prescriptions, a
doctor could prescribe for himself with little danger of
detection.

He could -os© false names, his own name, whatever

name h® feels like.

He could make sura it’s under a thirty-

day supply, because he has these, his own, you know, he has
these matters.
And I would also say, and it's rather obvious from

19
your own cases, I think the Moor® case, which I am not
acquainted with, that there ar© unscrupulous doctors and
pharmacists who ar© basically dispensers of drugs at will.
And finally you have the question of forgeries.
Now, it's true a computer cannot, in and of itself, identify
a nam© ®s a forgery.

But ~~ and this is, of course, I think

the cases that have com© up — usually forgery is when you have
a forgery, the person who is using a false name does it in a
rather large amount, just like when you print up counterfeit
money, you do it in an amount to make it worthwhile.

And,

normally, because it's a false name, it's the same name.
Now, if we don't know the name, there's no way to,
say, send out the alert that someone using the name of suchand-such is active in your area, if you got a prescription in
■that name

this alert can be sent out to the druggist —

to report: —
QUESTION: Are you talking about the forging of a
registered doctor’s nama or the forging of a non-existent
doctor?
MR. GREENWALD:

It could be either way.

It could fo©

possibly in the true name: of -the patient, with a forged
doctor’s signature, it

could be a false name with a true

doctor’s signatur®, a doctor — it could be any number of
things.

The point is that there are countless variations.
QUESTION:

It’s also tru© that, as you said, you

20

only have twenty people who are going to do all of this.
MR. GHEENWALD:
QUESTION:

Well, I think — and the point is —

Yon haven’t forgotten that, have you?

MR. GKEENWALD:

No, certainly.

And that comes to

the question that the district court seemed to consider the
fact that because w© hadn’t gotten, you know, enough results
her®, that somehow it then became unconstitutional.
That if we had a good record of results in this arest,
if we produced enough casas, that then this would become
cons titutional.
I submit that tills is not the test of constitutional»
ity, that this Court has clearly stated the case in other
similar situations, such as, I think, the Dan.forth case, that
the filing or reporting requirement is reasonably directed
to the preservation of health.
And I submit that tills type of filing requirement
clearly is so related.
Now, I also want to take up, very briefly ~ ray time
has' almost expired — that filing clearly does not interfere
with the doctor»patient relationship, and X submit that the
doctor-patient relationship is not constitutionally protected.
QUESTION:

Is there a docfcor-pat.ent privilege in

Now York?
MR. GREENWALD:

Yas, there is. But, for purposes of

this statute, as right in the law, and I cite it in my brief,

21

it is sot applicable as to what investigation —

QUESTION; Well, you argue that if you lose this case
©a constitutional grounds, there will b© a constitutional
doctor»*pati©nt privilege.
MR. GREENWALDs

Oh, I think it's quite clear that

an affirmance of the judgment below will establish a
constitutionally protected doctor^patient privilag®.
The district court clearly found such a privilege
from its reading of the abortion Re® and Doe cases.

I believe

that those decisions did no such thing, that it was a misreading
of those decisions.

I think that, and as I have emphasised,

that.it would be improper to do so, there are valid policy
reasons not to, and I don’t think they have been at all
answered by my adversary.
This Court also has declined, in any number of cases,
just this last term, to extend any right of privacy, such as —
or, I*d say, going back more than the last term.,

But in the

Planned Parenthood of Missouri v. Danforth, even in an abortion
context, reporting abortions with names and addresses, was not.
violative of a patient's privacy.
And California Bankers Association v. Schultz, no
violation of right of privacy in reporting bank records.
And perhaps the most obvious one is that, income tax
reporting is well known, and maybe people have some expectation

23

of privacy in that; area,

But for th® operation of income tax

laws,- and, 1 would submit also, our drug control program, you
have to have these reports.

And it doesn't make any

difference whether th© statuta is being properly administered.
If we had never computerised on© prescription, this
law would have a purpose.

Computerisation is not necessary to

the operation ©f the law.

Computers are not an unconstitutional

machine.

There is a spectre her©»
Now, the spectre in this case is whether — is the

fear of unauthorised disclosure,,
Now, the appellees, th© patients her© were totally
ignorant of the, of this law, of what it r€sally was. They
thought that their records were going to b€) available to the
police, to the Army, to the bar association, that they w@r®
going to be maintained £or©v®r and ever; and that simply was

l
not and is not the case.
And a fear of hypothetical stigmatization has never
been held to stay a cause of action, and only this past term
this -Court held, in Paul v« Davis, that even if what they
feared, .these appellees feared, disclosure of their drug

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL 0. LESCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LESCH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas© the

Courts
Perhaps I should state th© issue in this case as I
understand it.
Ill© judgment of the court below enjoined enforcement;
aid declared unconstitutional this statute, in so far as it
required disclosure to the State of New York of the identi-fay
of patients receiving Schedule II drugs.
Now, Mr. Gre@nwa.ld just referred to the Dan forth

case, in

which

tills Court

upheld record-keeping requirements.

But yesterday I had the opportunity to look in the Library of
th© Supreme Court and to look at the forms that were actually
required by th© State of Missouri in th© Panforth case, and
those forms specifically said that they didn't want the
patient’s name, all they wanted was th© patient’s number.
So -that if the State of Missouri was interested in statistical
information that related to a particular patient, and they
wanted more information about that patient, they could then
go back and get the name ? but there was nothing on file in
th© State of Missouri.

There was no computer printout of all

25

the names of the people who had had abortions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lesch, did yon challenge or do you

now question the constitutionality of a re sard™keeping
requirement that a physician who prescribe;3 these drugs keep
those records in his office and that those records be open
to inspection by the.State of New York?
MR. LESCH:

No, Your Honor. We are not challenging

that here today»
QUESTION:

You concede that*s constitutional?

MR. LESCHr

No» w® don't concede it*, either.

But we

don't think that that point has to b® readied.
QUESTION:

Well*, what — then all your constitutional

argument boils down to is that if it's made easier through
modern technology for the State of New York to enforce this
law, that there’s a constitutional difference?
MR. LESCII:

Thea:© is a constitutional difference.

It is our position, when the State of New York obtains 125,000
prescriptions per month through a massive computerisation and
record collection system, 2.5 million prescriptions over a
period of a year, and it turns out that they have two suspects
from that system, one of them, it turns out, is exonerated
/

and the other one is unresolved at the time of trial, the
whole system
QUESTION:
minute, Mr. Lssch.

Well, no, now wait a minute. Wait a
Can’t that just as well be taken as evidence

26
that til© system is working very wall, that it is in fact
deterring tha abuse of xh& thing?
MR. LESCHs

If the system — well, the — but the

same tiling happened before, Your Honor,,

There's nothing in

the legislative history, there are no statistics that this
type of system was necessary»

Triplicat® prescriptions ar@ a

fantasm, ar© a spectre, are an unsupported theory that the
Mr» Greenwald and the Department of Health have found in this
case.
For example, Mr, Greenwald gave a lot of hypothetical
situations to the whole Court today, none of them are supported
in this record.

They had Mr, Cannissaro testify, who is the

head of their system, they had Mr, Belli2zi testify, we have
the whole legislative history as part of the record before
this Court, no on® has ever suggested that this so-called
doctor-to-'doctor problem is really a problem.
And yet it was on that basis that they went to the
Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals sent the cas© back
to trial.
The principal argument that they made was that there
was a doctor-to-doctor problem her®, namely, that patients,
using tha same, name, would go to more than on© doctor in order'
to obtain illicit supplies of these drugs.

But that problem

turned out to be non-existent, and it is against that fact
and against the fact that thousands of names of patients are

27
being put on the computer- as to which there is instant access,
so that anybody who is author! zed, and the statute provides
for interdepartmental transfer of this information, can
obtain that information.
Moreover, the record is also uncontradicted, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, that there is — that the security system
for this program is entirely inadequate.
There was on© witness in this case, a man by the
name of Wasserxnan.

He was an expert on security.

He pointed

out defect after defect after defect in this system.

By the

way, these —*
QUESTIONs

Well now, wait a minute. Does your

constitutional argument then turn not on tie fact that you
have to turn the *— the doctor has to turn the records over
to authorised New York personnel, but on the further fact
that tui®re may be leakage to unauthorized persons?
MR. LESCH:

Our constitutional argument turns on the

basic right of privacy, that when you have here, first of all,
a relationship that has been historically recognized, for
example,, by the existence of the physician'*patient privilege —
■t

QUESTION s

But not — there's nothing in the

Constitution about that.
'

/
A

MR. LESCH; There's nothing in the Constitution —
QUESTION;

That's a. matter'of Scat© law. State

evidence law, isn’t it?

28

MR. LESCH: That's quit© right.

3ufc there is

something in the Constitution# as this Court has found in
Roe v, Wade and Doe v. Bolton# that there are certain
attributes of that relationship that deserve protection.
And similarly# “**»
QUESTION:

You would find the same fault with the

reporting of gunshot wounds?
MR, LESCH:

Ho# 1 do not# Your Honor.

I think that's

an entirely different case.
QUESTION:

The reporting of contagious and

venereal diseases.
MR. LESCH:

Absolutely not.

QUESTION:

No problem.

MR. LESCH:

That is entirely different.

Yes.

Because in the reporting of gunshot wounds or in
the reporting of contagious diseases# there* is a compelling
State interest.

There is a legitimate interest of the State,

If somebody shoots somebody else# the State ought to take
action# and the State ought to find out about a gunshot
wound as quickly as it can.
And if someone is “«
QUESTION:

But it invades a certain amount of

privacy# doesn't it?
MR. LESCH:

It invades a certain amount of privacy.

In Doe v. Bolton and Roe v. Wad®# this Court didn't hold that

29

there is an absolute right of privacy*

It only referred to

th© first trimester, as to the right to mac© the abortion
decision*
W®'re not saying that the right of privacy is
absolute in any sense*

But we are saying fchsfc th© Court looks

at the relationship, looks at the doctor's right to prescribe
— and there is testimony in this case, for example, by a
psychiatrist, that h© would not prescribe Schedule II drugs
to patients of his, because he would have to tell them about
th© filing requirement„
QUESTION: Why is that any more significant than, that;
there are soma doctors who won't perform abortions?

That's

just a. personal scruple on the part of the doctor, isn't it?
MR, LESCH:
Honor*

No, it’s more than that, I believe, Your

Because in Roe v, Wade and Doe v* Bolton, this Court

talked about the right to practice medicine unhindered by non­
medical considerationso
/ V

And it is a non-medical consideration, we urge, as
to what the effect of th© filing requirement will be on the
future health of the patient*

That shouldn't be what goes

into the doctor's mind when h© decides, Is tills drug necessary
\

for my treatment of this patient?

>

It ought to be simply, What;
•y

is th© patient's medical history and what wiki the effect of
this drug be on th© patient?
This Court has held that there are other ways to

30

monitor doctors.

There ar@ licensing requirements.

The

State, for example, can, on the prescriptions «— we5re not
challenging this — the State can require the doctors to file
all of ‘their prescriptions with the doctor’s name on it.
The only thing that w@ object to, and that's why I
restated the issue at the beginning of my argument, is the
patient's name.

So that in the case that you mentioned, Mr.

Chief Justice, before, toe Moore case, if a physician is
giving out a large number of prescriptions of Schedule 11
drugs, the Department of Health can go to that physician and
ask him to see fcha patient records, and check up on the bona
fides of every one of those.
But what w© do —

Did you say in your colloquy with brotheir

Rehnquist that you would or would not con os da the State could

QUESTION£ Who is getting a prescription.
MR. LESCHs Whether the state could require to©
patient to give his name to the doctor?
QUESTION:

To toe doctor.

And there's no further

requirement to report it to the State.
MR. LESCH3

Oh, 1 have no problem with the Stata

giving “** with the patient giving his awn name to the
physician.

31

QUESTION:

And for the State requiring the physician

to keep a record of the patient’s name?
MR, LESCHs

I have no problem with the State requir­

ing the physician to keep the name,
QUESTIONS

So that at som© time, if there were

probable cause to suspect something, you could subpoena the
doctor’s records?
MR. LESCHs

Exactly.

QUESTION:

Exactly.

You wouldn’t se® anything wrong with that:?

MR. LESCHs

No* I wouldn’t, because there you have

what you have in —
QUESTION: What about; calling the doctor before a
Grand Jury?
MR. LESCHs

1 would see nothing wrong with calling a.

doctor before a Grand
QUESTION:

Jury.

And asking him* "Tell me the names of the

patients to whom you prescribed Title II drugs in the last year”?
MR. LESCHs

Yes, and there is a basic distinction

between that case and the case we have. And that is that that
case provides for invocation of the judicial process, which
the two concurring justices in the Schultz case
QUESTION:

>

But you need no probable cause to call

him before the Grand Jury?
MR. LESCHs

Youneed no probable cause, but you do

have a district court judge supervising the conduct of the

32

Grand Jury proceedings.,
QUESTIONS Well, supervising it in what sens©?
H© can claim the privilege ©gainst self*»incrimination, but
that’s not in question here.
MR» LESCHs

No, if h© claims, on behalf of his

patient, the doctor-patient privilege, and it is determined
by the district court judge that idle questions that are being
asked of that doctor are simply a fishing expedition, h©
won’t be required to answer them,
QUESTION? Well now, that’s a question of State law,
whether he can claim the doctor-patient privilege. Certainly
there is no federal doctor-patient privilege that on© can
claim before a Grand Jury, is there?
MR* LESCHs Well, to the extent that there is —
okay, to the extent that w©5re talking about that, and that
would only obtain in the State court proceeding»
QUESTION? So what is the difference between calling
him before a Grand Jury and inspecting his records?
MR.LESCH:

If there is a right of privacy that a

patient has and that a physician can protect, then a court
can supervise the ©xercis© of that right of privacy during
Grand Jury testimony or during demands for his records.
QUESTION:

Oh, well, then you're* saying, in response

to Justice Whit®, that h© can be called before a Grand Jury,
but if he’s asked to disclose the names of his patients, he

33

then assaris this district court decision?.
MR. LESCHs

If* in fact* h© has reason to believe

that this is a fishing expedition* or there is no basis for
such a request* he can do so.
QUESTION5

But that isn't our case.

But you’re saying that’s just like any

witness before a Grand Jury* you wouldn’t be saying that this
would be special to tins doctor?
MR. LESCHs

I’m not saying that* yes.

Excuse me*

Your Honor is correct* that’s what I’m saying.
QUESTIONS

If the normal rule would apply* whatever

it is.
MR. LESCHs The normal rule would apply. But you
would have the opportunity for judicial intervention, and
that’s what we don’t have in this case.
QUESTIONS Well* in New York* may witnesses before a
Grand Jury decline to answer a question on the grounds that
it’s a fishing expedition* or ara they limited to the Fifth
Amendment?
MR. LESCHs

Your Honor* I can’t «- I can’t answer that.

I think that if -*■
QUESTIONS

Have you ever heard of a State that allows

a witness to decline *»»•
MR. LESCHs

If a warrant is insufficiently specific*

if a. request for information is overly general* then I think
the objection to the request for information can be made* that.

34
it is a fishing expedition*
QUESTION s Wellf you don11 need a warrant to examine
someone before a Grand Jury* all you need is a subpoena.
MR. LESCHj Ail right*

I was talking about a request

for information to e. physician, by way of warrant or subpoena.
QUESTION?

Well, Mr* Jaffe, your point, I under»

stand, is —
MR. LESCH3
QUESTIONS

I'm Mr* L®sch, Your Honor*
Oh, that's right,

I understand that your

point is that whatever position the doctor makes, a judge will
decide it»
MR* LESCHs
QUESTION!

Exactly*

Exactly. There is —

Whether it's

if it's a fishing or

whatever it is, it will be a judge who decides it.
MR. LESCH s

That is the only point that I am trying

to mak© hare. Whereas her® we have the collection of millions
of prescriptions without any opportunity for a judg© to decidet
anything.
And absolutely no need shown, ei'iher before the
statute was enacted or sine© it's been enacted, that -these
had any effect whatsoever.

We have 31 persons who are

operating this system and have access to the information.
W© have exactly two suspects in the twenty months that the
system was operated. And in that time on© of them was
discharged, and th® other one was left unresolved.

35

QUESTION; Well# I take it you arts not suggesting
that if you win this case -that there will be established a
constitutional privilege# which would permit a patient to
object to his doctor testifying against him?
MR» LESCHs

No constitutional privilege»
In © criminal case,

In a criminal case»

MR» LESCHs That has nothing to do with this case#

For example# a psychoanalyst
QUESTIONS

Well# but you — the rule you've

MR» LESCHs

It certainly wouldn't»

That's a question for another day.
As are the questions relating to gunshot wounds#
which is a much simpler case»
problem with that.

As I said before# I have ,no

Or the reporting of venereal diseases #

because -«
QUESTIONS But you ar© contending for a generalised
constitutional right of privacy# which the Court's opinion
in Katz v» United States said, did not exist;?

36

MR* LESCH; Well, following the Katz case, this
Court decide Do©, Roe, it also decided the case of Buckley v.
Valeoi vin all of those cases the Court recognized that privacy
is a constitutionally protected right*
Now, I’m not saying -that it is a generalised right
of privacy» What I’m referring to her® is a right of a
physician to practice medicine, which is wall within the
confines of this Court’s prior decisions, the right of a
patient to receive advice untrammeled by non-medical considera­
tions, which is also well within this Court’s prior decisions»
I’m not saying that every aspect of privacy is
constitutionally protected»
But I am saying that when you hay© the peculiar
situation of, first of all, the physician-patient relationship,
and secondly you have the affect on the practice of medicine
by the physician, and thridly you have the total lack of
any necessity for the disclosure of millions of names of highly
personal information to the State, that under these circum­
stances the right of privacy ought to exist.
The Court in Poe v,, Oilman talk©! about tin-* right of
privacy being a rational continuum.

And I believe that this

case is a rational continuation —
QUESTION:

But Poe v. Ullman dismissed 'die writ as

improvidently granted, didn’t it?
MR» LESCHs

I was referring to the concurring

37
opinion in that css©? which was quoted by Judge Friendly in
the court below.
QUESTION; The dissenting opinion, I think it was.
MR. LESCHs

I think it was at that time,, but that

was also before Doe and Ro©

Your Honor.

1

QUESTION? Did you say Judge Friendly ~~ I did not
observe Judge Friendly as a member of this panel.
MR. LESGIs

Well? there was a —• Judge Friendly —-

originally this case was dismissed.
QUESTION? When it was foe fore a single judge.
QUESTIONS

Yes.

But not in the present ease? is

that it?
MR. LESCH: what happened in this case was that
originally Judge Carter dismissed the case for want of a
substantial federal question.

It then went up to the Circuit

Court of Appeals? and Judge Friendly instituted a temporary
restraining order? or continued the one that Judge Carter had
granted? in effect held that there was a substantial federal
question and quoted the Po® v. Ullman case.
He then sent it back down for argument on the
preliminary injunction motion,

And it was only after we had

established? in the record in this case? all of the facts that
I am talking about now? that then the case cam© up to this
Court with a full record? where it is shown that there is no
need for this system

38
X believe we have- also shown the Federal Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act has no triplicate prescription
provision# the Uniform Controlled Substances Act has no
triplicate prescription provision? 39 States of the Union have
no such provision.,
And this Court has often held that where so many
other States have no triplicate prescription — or have no
comparable provisions in their statute# that is also an
indication that those provisions are unnecessary»
The fact is# in this css©# that '£her® has not been
a scintilla of evidence -- and Mr, Graanwald, for the State# lias
not pointed -to a scintilla of evidence that there is any need
whatsoever for the patient’s name»
If there were some showing of need, as there is not
in this case# at that point the Stats may well condition use
of a more effective means, which involves

%

danger to a

constitutionally protected privacy# on the taking of all
reasonable precautions which limit the risk»

So that is

the point where the adequacy of 'the State security system
comes into play, Justice Rehnquist, in response to your prior
question. But we don’t reach that point in this case.

And

the thna©-*judge court didn’t reach it in this case, because
there was absolutely no showing,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
time, Mr, Lasch

You are now on Mr, Jaffa’s

39
MR. LESCHs

In that: case? I will withdraw.

Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Jaffe.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF II. MILES JAFFE, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. JAFFE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleas® the

Courts
If I could go back to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question,
w@ do admit that it is th® difference in the extent and
intrusivaness of th© system that is at th© heart of this case.
And th© case really does take off from th© concurring opinion
of Mr. Justice Powsll in -the Schultz case, where he says:
"at som® point government intrusion upon these areas would
implicate legitimate expectations of privacy.
And th© key to this case is that, unlike the
decision in Danforth or in Schultz, where the reporting was
not systematic and in fact was not properly challenged, or
as in the American Physleans case, which was affirmed by this
Court in th© last term, but not heard by this Court, there is
systematic reporting her© of the names of literally hundreds
of thousands of patients.
It is our belief thare comas a print at which the
demand of th® State for systematic reporting of absolutely
innocent conduct becomes offensive.
And, in fact, the intrusiveness of the conduct was

40

seer?, at the trial, because, as Mr. Lesch has commented, this
case went up and down, originally Judge Carter thought there
was no substantial federal question, it was reversed by the
Second Circuit, it cam© back downy we asked for a temporary
injunction, and the Court said, No, you haven't shown us any
real injury.
Well, when we finally got to trial, the witnesses
who testified testified to substantial intrusion into the
doctor-psfeient relationship, which is a part of this case#
part is the intimacy of the information the government is
seeking, part is the doctor-patient relationship.
Witnesses -testified — these witnesses, it is true,
are innocent of illegal practices, but they testified that
the thought of having the State have all tills information
made them very uneasy? or a doctor testified that he would not.
prescribe for a schisophrenic, in one cas© — I think that's
at page 169 of the record, Dr. Brody's testimony

h@ would

not prescribe for a schizophrenic patient -tihese drugs because,
as all of the other doctors testified, h© felt he was required
to inform the patient that the system existed and that the
name would b© forwarded to Albany.
He then felt that if h® so informed the schisophrenic#
that would upset the very treatment which he in fact intended
to prescribe for the schisophrenic.
So here we are asking the Court to address itself to-

41
the questions which war© not raised in Danforth or Miller,
where there was investigation, but th© question where there
is, in effect, a dragnet before, not an investigation afterward,
and that is the distinction.
It is fin© for th© State to investigate, and we’re
for it, and we d© not believe that drug abase is a good thing(
we think it's a bad thing? and w© think doctors should have to
report, and we do think that doctors should, in fact — tha
computer can printout exactly what the doctor’s us© is.
That is to say, if on© doctor is prescribing hundreds of
thousands of pills © month, or whatever would b© the right
quantum, you can then go and investigate that doctor, and
the doctor is required, under th© statute, and w® do not
object to this, the doctor is required under th© statute to
keep those records. And then when th© Stata goes and conducts
the investigation, so b© it.
QUESTION?

But now, th© State does need probable

cause, under th© pre-existing system, to go and inspect a
doctor’s records.
MR. JAFFEs

And does not her®.

And that is not challenged in this case.
What is challenged in this case is th© centralisa­
tion and the data processing implications that are taking
place in this case, whether it ha medical information, the
next we will have is income? in the Valeo case w© have political

42
contributions# for which a reason was found there# which we
think was compelling»

The difference here is that the state's:

showing is totally inadequate»
The next esse wa may get is “the filing at birth of
all fingerprints7 which — it’s true# if wa asked any single
eitisen to come forward at any time# we could probably get his.
fingerprints.

It’s the systematic dragnet prior to any

criminal conduct# with totally innocent patients her©# who
ar® compelled to fo© part of the system»

No one goes to get a

Schedule II drug because h© wants to b© happy about it.

He

is a patiant# and he is presumably sick.
QUESTION:

Well# you’re compellad to b© a part of

the system when you’re bom in most States# aren’t you# because
tiie birth certificate is filad and forwardad to the State
Registrar of Statistics?
MR. JAFFE:

Exactly» And we would say to the Court

there should be limits on the degree to which the State can
then start cataloging your every activity»
QUESTION: Well# why not draw the line before that?
Why not say no registration of birth certificates?
MR» JAFFEs

Because the registration of birth

certificates ha® a clear need.
QUESTION: Well# then you’re saying that in evezy one
of these cases wher© the States are out to collect any kind of
data# th© State has to show a compelling interest or a clear

43
n@©d or something like that?
MR. JAFFE:

Your Honor, that is not as hard as Your

Honor makes it. sound.
In fact, usually the State can show a very clear
reason for spending millions of dollars talcing in $125,000
125,000 prescriptions par month.

And, in fact, th© need in

the gunshot case, and -th© need in th© venereal disease, those
needs are clear.
But there comes a time, when we8:r® dealing with
medical records, when the need
me get to that point.

and this css®

and let

This case was tried. This case does

not com© up on a motion to dismiss.

It does not com® up on

summary judgment.
It comes up, after three judges originally, rather
skeptical, heard th© testimony of these pa<d@nfcs, and what
they said was, in th© year or twenty months; that this system
was in effect, w© had one case in which there’s a suspect.
There hasn’t been any showing that th© system has acted as a
deterrent.

We have no showing at all of ary need here.

And what w® preserve, as we rule against the name requirement,
we preserve, is the most comprehensive system of regulation
of any drug -- of fny drug regulation in tie country, namely,
everything must be filled out on a New York State form.

It

must includ€i —
QUESTION:

Mr. Jaffa, let me just ask one question

44
that’s running through my mind»
If you look at it from the point of view of the
individual whose privacy is being invaded , because his naxn®
is being put in a file sort® place, does it matter to him
whether, when somebody wants to find out whether he’s taking
'these drugs or not, whether the parson trying to find out
goes to til® corner pharmacist and says, "Do you have any
information about this man?15 or h© goes to Albany?
MR. JAFFEs
QUESTIONs

Yes, it does —
I mean, presumably, he would patronise

the local drug store, I suppose.
MR. JAFFEs

Sure.

It does make a difference,

because most people recognize at this

point that the

possibility of abuse, if, in fact, th® information is
centralized within th® control of -th© government, is
incalenable.
QUESTIONS

But I suppos® the individual’s coneam

only arises when h@5s under investigation, does it not?
MR. JAFFEs

No»

In other words, he’s worried

about th© fact that if he takes a dangerous drug, and he says,
"Well, I may run for office next year, and th® Governor in
this State in fact can simply push a button on th© computer and
find out, among other things, who my business associates ar®,
because we have a list of fchos® p@opl®, and who my drugs [sic]
are, because we have a list of those people” — in other words.

QUESTIONj Well, couldn’t the Governor go to the corner

MR. JAFFE;

MR. JAFFEs

Oh© facility her©.

It is tru© that »~

QUESTION:

That it is easier to go to Albany than

it is to go to th® corner drugstore.
MR. JAFFE:

It is easier to push the computer button

and find out where all of our citizens have been, and what all
th© citizens do, and who their associations are, and who
their political contributions ar®f and so :forth and so on.
But are we going to authorize the State to make a
collection of political contributions, without a showing that
in fact there is a reason for that?
QUESTION:

In income tax, federal income tax returns,

they are supposed to be of th© utmost sacred category of privacy.

45
and yet we know,- as e practical matter, that they are leaked#
especially in recent years.
How# would you regard that sis a claw in it?
MR. JAFFE3
Your Honor.

Mo# that would be exactly on point#

I would say that if federal incoma tax were not

necessary# then, we shouldn't have the form;?. We all know it
is necessaryB and therefore we don't object to it.
QUESTIONS Wall# don't you think gun control is

necessary?
MR. JAFFEs

Yes. 1 do.

But I think —• but hare w© have a showing after
trial# which is the difference in this cas-is.
That the State has gotten literally nothing after
trial# shown nothing as the product.

And v;a say# as Mr.

Justice Pew© 11 indicated in the Schultz casse, there comas a
point whan the material turned up by a sys-cem which includas
hundreds of thousands of prescriptions per month, almost,
when it has gone too far.
And where, as YourHonor points out, where you find
an immediate need, as in the income tax area, we would then
xiphoid the system.
Whara, for example

w& might s^en feel, in th©

income tax place, they went too far, as requiring everybody
to report every check -chat he has,
And it is true that the IRS could get every check.

47
Bat v,?© would still not want the government to have a record
of every chock, And checks as® leas personal, if on® looks at
Miller, than are th© medical records of people here.
And, interestingly, in the Danforth case, in th®
Schultn case, and in idle Association of American Physicians,
non© of tho. regulations required -the centralized reporting of
nantes.

And th© statute in Dan forth does not have a central —*

does not require the central reporting. And the regulations
do ■..’’not include, on the form, th© name.
That's the distinction we call to th® Court's
attention, and urge.

And we urge the Court -to examine

carefully the findings of th© lower court and their narrow­
ness, perhaps not the language but the narrowness of that
finding, which saids

Where there is no product from th®

system and where the system is requiring th© massive central­
isation, there we think that the diminition of constitutionally
protected right is too great.
Or, put otherwise, when you have regulation of this
sort, precision must h© th© touchstone.
Thank you.

ME. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Jaffa.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Greenwald?
You have a couple of minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT 05' A. SETH GREENWALD, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, GREI3MWALD:

Wall, I would want —» yes,

1 think

I did reserve © couple of minutes,
I- wish to emphasize that my "*-•

counsel for the

Roa appellees has stated that interdepartmental communication
is allowed under this statute.

That's basically erroneous.

The confidentiality provision in this law, one© again ignored
by the district court*, provides that patient identity is only
available to ‘the Department of Health investigators, people
V

who are responsible for the enforcement of Article 33, or
other agencies that license people who deal in this©
controlled substances.

...........

Thus, the example given by the attorney for the
patient appellees, shout the Governor getting information, is
absolute nonsense.

Th© Governor would be violating the law

if he went to gat this information.
And I think I can fairly stat© that under this law
the Commissioner of Health, who, I admit, is an appointee of
the Governor, has a legal duty and a legal right, to tell the
Governor, if this ever happened — price again, a hypothetic©.!
— to gat out of his office.
And, of course, all this is in th© height of hypo*»
thesis.
Now, I also would like to emphasise that th© con~

49
fidentisilty provision her© is one of the most carefully
drawn. 1' think, und©r~analys£s, and when you speak about income
tax records, indeed, the reason you find leaks perhaps of
income tax records is that the law allows those records to be
provided to any government official.

‘Thia is not the case

in th© operation of our filing triplicate prescriptions.
And there's also the spectre of lack of results,
claim of one or two in twenty months of operation.

In point

of fact, I think it’s — I have found it in the record.

In point of fact, we did not have the cap,ability of printing
out patient names, or extracting patient names from the
computer until about, roughly, August 1974, and there was a
ferial in Dacamber.
2 think it’s irrelevant to the constitutionality of
this section whether we got one report, 50 reports or 150
reports.
But, basically, you have a system in its infancy.
There ©re certain priorities in the Department of Health.
Constitutionality of a statute on its face, and that’s what
we’re involved in here, cannot depend on the efficiency or
proper operation by the appellant.
Indeed, as 1 have cited in my Reply Brief, if there
had been a preliminary injunction, let's say, for example,
granted against this sytern, and there was ona for about four
or five or six months, you'd have no results to discuss.

50
It’s rather obvious that the constitutionality of this statute
depends on whether it is reasonably directed to accomplishing
its purpose»

Th-3 discussion —
QUESTION :

Mr» Greanwald, if we could find & way to

send this case back, don’t you think, as broke as New York is,
that they might forget about it?
MR. GKEENWALDs

I would submit that thora's no

necessity —» I don't think thar©*s any necessity to send this
case back.

It has been mentioned by the amici, the amici

curia® briefs, because it’s rather obvious that the record,
in later months, showed w© war© getting all types of reports.
But I submit that that is a totally erroneous test of
constitutionality.

That would mean that in California, if

they got proper results, or results that impressed the district
court judges, it's constitutional in California.

If, in

Idaho, they might get only ten, because it’s a small Stato,
then there is no need.
.MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

I think you've answered

th® question, counsel.
MR. GREENWALDx

Thank you.

MR. GIIIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Th© ease is submitted.

i'Whsreupon, at 3 s 0 3 o’.clock, p.m», the case in the
above-antitied matter was submitted.]
