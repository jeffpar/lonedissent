P ROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75~l805:> Garland Jeffers against the United States.
Mr, Bower, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN BOWER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR. BOWER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Garland Jeffers became involved in dealing in
narcotics in Gary. Indiana, in and around November 1971.

He

ai.;d about four cr five of his friends who were all around his
age, that is, around 21 years of age, met and began a pattern
of drug-related activities.

They engaged in robberies in

which they stole drugs from other dope pushers on the street.
They extorted money from other drug dealers for them to be able
to continue in operation within the city of Gary, and they,
themselves, engaged in distribution of heroin and cocaine.
Jeffers1 role in this operation which lasted from
November *71 through the time of the indictment on March 18,
197^, was admittedly one of at least a supervisor.

He began as

treasurer and after a certain period of time literally became
the head of the drug operation,
QUESTION:
MR, BONER:

How did he get this promotion?
I think he took it, Your Honor.

Mr, Jeffers is apparently a very dynamic and forceful

4
individual and had sufficient number of friends that were
willing to assist him in taking over this rather hazardous
position and occupation*
What happened, Your Honor, was, to focus to the Court,
that all of the activities, involved In the case presently
before the Court, occurred in Gary, Indiana, and part of them
in Chicago,
There was one family drug ring in Gary,

It ran over

a period of two and a half years and at one time or another
there x*jere over fifty different individuals actively involved
in the operation.
QUESTION:
MR, BOWER:
Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

What do you mean by a “family drug ring"?
This was the name given to this operation,
They called it "The Family,"
It doesn't connote a "mom and pop" type

of drug —
(laughter)
MR* BOWER:

It doesn't to me, Your Honore' It was

nicknamed by the press as "The Family" and basically went by
that name.
The reason to point out this background, Your Honors,
is to emphasize that our issue today has to do with Jeffers'
multiple prosecution of separate drug violations under the
federal law.
The evidence presented at Jeffers 1 first trial which

5
was for conspiracy to distribute heroin and cocaine is basically
the same evidence presented in his second trial which is on the
continuing criminal enterprise.
I point this out to the Court at the beginning so
that there is no confusion that we are not talking about any
type of multiple drug conspiracies, separate drug rings, or any
confusion concerning what evidence was presented in both the
lower court cases.
The Government has never contended, nor could they
in fact contend, that the evidence used at the first trial and
the evidence used at the second trial wasn't from the same
witnesses and wasn't from the same series of transactions.
All right.
A resume of the prosecutions is like this.

On March

18, 1974, Garland Jeffers and nine others were indicted in
Hammond, Hammond Criminal 74-56, for conspiracy to distribute
heroin,
On the same date, in a companion indictment, Jeffers,
by himself, was indicted with a continuing criminal enterprise
charge under 848.
All right.
The Government — Upon request.of the Government,
the conspiracy case was set for trial.

Objections were filed

to the — Or the Government then filed a motion for trial
together of the conspiracy case and the continuing criminal

6
enterprise.
Objections were filed by the attorney representing
all the defendants in the conspiracy case, arguing that the
presence of Jeffers in the courtroom on a continuing criminal
enterprise would prejudice the other various defendants in the
conspiracy, and Jeffers argued that the presence of the other
nine defendants in the conspiracy would jeopardise his right
to a free trial.
The trial court saw fit not to allow consolidation,
which left the record that Jeffers had pending against him, a
conspiracy charge and pending also on a separate indictment,
a continuing criminal enterprise charge.
The Government then went to trial on a conspiracy
charge and convicted Jeffers of conspiracy to distribute heroin
and he received a 15-year jail sentence.
QUESTION;

Mr. Bower, I take it it's very clear and

plain and you have conceded that he was one of those who
objected to consolidation of the trial.
MR, BOVJER;
QUESTION;
MR* BONER:
Honor.

Yes.
Bid he push for severance?
He pushed for no trial together, Your

They were not joined.

severance.

It was not a request for a

The Government had seen fit to return two indict­

ments and then sought to try them together.
Jeffers and others opposed the trial consolidation.

7
QUESTION:

Do you think the situation is different

than if there had been two counts and one indictment and he,
himself, moved for a severance?
MR0 BOWER:

I think it would„

As a matter of fact,

I think this situation is entirely different, for one very
obvious reason.

The Government at any time had the option to

sever Jeffers from the conspiracy trial and try him later on the
conspiracy in the continuing criminal enterprise trial at one
time.
That's the big distinction here.

These two indict­

ments were not joined and the request was for the Government to
join the two of them together.
In other words, the first trial took place, the
Government still had an option before trying him on a conspiracy,
to sever him from the conspiracy and attempt to try him together
later on the continuing criminal enterprise.
QUESTION:

If they had done that,could the jury have

convicted him on both of those counts?
HR. BOWER:
no.

Well, my response should be no, and is

I would suggest that we follow Justice Powell's Footnotes

17 and 18 in lannelli and instruct the jury as follows: that
they should not consider the conspiracy charge against Jeffers
unless they find him not guilty of the continuing criminal
enterprise, and should only consider the conspiracy charge if
they find him not guilty of the continuing criminal enterprise.

8
Jeffers, prior to the second trial, in fact, raised
the double jeopardy claim by a motion for dismissal,,

In that

dismissal, he alleged that the evidence to be used against him
would be the same and asserted, prior to the second trial, that
conspiracy was a lesser included offense of the continued
criminal enterprise.
It appears to me, to the Court, that the first big
crucial step that must be taken by Jeffers in order to sub­
stantiate his violation of double jeopardy rights is whether or
not conspiracy to distribute heroin is a lesser included offense
in a continuing criminal enterprise charge,
Jeffers submits and argues to the Courfc that it is.
The standard definition of a conspiracy, briefly
stated, is simply an agreement between two or more that by
concerted action to accomplish a criminal purpose*
It is Jeffers1 contention that the continued criminal
enterprise charge under Section 848 means that a person has to
undertake a series of violations of the Federal Drug Law and
that they have to be undertaken in concert with five or more
people with whom he occupies a position of supervisor-manager
and for which he derives substantial income.
The crucial statutory definition that Jeffers contends
is controlling is that the continuing criminal enterprise
statute requires that the series of drug violations be taken
in concert with five or mere.

9
I submit to the Court that "in concert" can only mean
that there has been an agreement in design and plan and that
this is a basic definition of a conspiracy*
QUESTION:

How many do you have to have to sustain

the first charge that you have described here?
MR* BOWER:
QUESTION:
MR* BOWER:

Two, Your Honor,
How many for the second?
Five, Your Honor,

Well, five or six.

Jeffers, himself, with five

others,
The Government has taken a position that lannel11
controls this case and the fact that this Honorable Court found
in lannelli that the gambling offense was also -- was not
phrased in terms of the conspiracy statute or that the gambling
offense did not require an agreement, therefore they were
separate, the slight difference in phraseology, as appears in
the continuing enterprise statute should not be controlling*
I submit, Your Honor, that it is controlling*

The

reason why is that if the Government's position is correct
this Court is going to have to find that the phrase "in concert,"
as appears in the continuing enterprise statute, must be inter­
preted to mean not in concert.
It is Jeffers ! position that a conspiracy is an
essential basic element of a continued criminal enterprise,
and, as such, if the continuing criminal enterprise charge is

10

proven a conspiracy, In fact, will be proven.
Therefore, Jeffers contends that if he is tried and
convicted on the lesser included offense of conspiracy, he may
not be prosecuted subsequently on the greater offense of a
continuing criminal enterprise.
QUESTION:

There are really three basic issues in

this case, aren't there?
First of all, is conspiracy a lesser included
offense of this new statutory offense?
MR. BOWER:
QUESTION:

Right.
Secondly, if so, does the double jeopardy

clause prohibit the prosecution on the greater offense after
conviction of the lesser included offense?
MR,. BOWER:
QUESTION:

That's right.
And, thirdly, if so, was that waived in

this case by your client’s motion of insisting upon severance
of the trial?
MR. BOWER:
QUESTION;

Yes.
Those are the three basic issues, aren't

they?
MR, BOWER:

Yes.
"V

QUESTION:

And you are now directing yourself to the

first, or have been.
MR, BOWER:

To the first and to the second.

QUESTION:

Is it a lesser Included offense?

11
MR. BOWER:
QUESTION:

Yes, It is.
I mean that's the issue to vshich you are

now directing yourself.
MR. BOWER:

That's right.

It Is lesser included, Your Honor, because of the
standard definitions concerning lesser Included, to the effect
that the greater offense cannot be committed without, in fact,
having the lesser offense committed.
What I am saying is that Section 848, continuing
criminal enterprise section, in its definition, when it says,
"I, series of drug violations must be undertaken in concert with
five or more of necessity requires" ■—
QUESTION:
exception to that?

Mr. Bower, isn't there one possible
The Government suggests that the five or

more persons could be innocent dupes of Mr. Jeffers.
If one can read the statutory language "in concert
with" as including innocent employees, Innocent dupes, then
your argument would fail, would it not?
MR. BOWER:

Justice Stevens, I see no way that that

can be done because when you use the phrase, "in concert,"
there has got to be an agreement in design or plan.

Not only

joint action, but they have to agree as to the end.

The end is

the Illegal drug distribution.
QUESTION:

Mr, Bower, just so — you would agree that,

if the statute were read as an innocent dupe statute, then there

12
would be no lesser included offense.

Your point, as I under­

stand it, is that is a manifestly unreasonable reading of the
statute.
MR, BOWER:

Yes.

Yes to both questions,,

The concept of in concert, perhaps, best can be
pointed out by an analogy, in that if you called the Boston Pops
Orchestra together for them to play in concert they are all
jointly acting, but you wouldn’t expect each individual
musician to be playing a different song.
The in concert requires not only joint action, but
agreement as to the end, agreement as t© design or scheme.
The argument that innocent dupes, such as hired
messenger boys to make delivery, they are not part of any
conspiracy or drug ring at all, unless they are aware of what
the goals are.

If they are aware that they are delivering

heroin, then they are part of the agreement and they are part of
the continuing criminal enterprise.
So, I think that even though the Government contends
that Jeffers could be convicted if there were five innocent
dupes, I would say that this could not be under the meaning of
the statute.
It requires five other individuals actively partici­
pating in the drug operation.

And, in fact, Your Honor, that's

exactly what was present in this case,
dupes.

There were no innocent

The prosecutions against the variety of the Family

13
members, the drug ring members, all showed that they were aware
a nd pa rt ic i pa t ed in it,
QUESTION:

Tell me again how a criminal act under a

statute that requires at least five is the lesser included
offense in the number one. which requires only two,

I know

you have gone over that but it would help me if you would -MR, BOWER:

Well, because, in fact, a conspiracy

could be committed with only two people, as opposed to five,
Your Honor,

1 would say that, basically, that was an election

of Congress when they outlined -QUESTION:

Mr, Bower, which is the lesser included

offense under your theory?
MR, BOWER:

The conspiracy is the lesser included.

The continued criminal enterprise is the greater, for several
reasons.
One, the continued criminal enterprise has. a great
amount of additional elements that require to be proven, besides
the conspiracy.

Besides the in concert action with five or more,

they have to show he was a supervisor, they have to show he
received substantial income,
I would point out, too, what supports this is the
fact that the continued criminal enterprise statute carries by
far the heavier penalty.

On first offense, it is ten years to

life, non-suspendable.
On. the conspiracy charge, if it is conspiracy to

14
distribute, it is up to the same as the substantive offense, or
fifteen years.
So, It seems evident that Congress In writing 848,
continued criminal enterprise statute, in imposing such a heavy
penalty, intended to cover the evils that are present from
conspiratorial behavior.
So, not only do the penalties, but the language of
the statute strongly suggest that conspiracy is, in fact,
included,
I would direct the Court's attention to Xannelll and
suggest to the Court that this Court's treatment in the
lannelll case warrants Jeffers' double jeopardy claim being
sustained,
In Ianne111, Justice Powell's opinion in Footnotes 17
and 18 discusses the concept of Blcekburger and the concept of
whether or not, in the lannelll case, the gambling offense,
1955 gambling offense, required an agreement or conspiracy as
part of the offense.
This Court specifically found in lannelll that the
gambling offense did not require conspiracy.
Jeffers' case is the other side of that.

In Jeffers'

case, the continuing criminal enterprise does, in fact, require1
conspiratorial activity.

It requires action in concert.

Therefore, applying. lannelll to Jeffers, it is
logical to come to the conclusion that Jeffers’ rights of-

15

double jeopardy had been violated by the multiple prosecution.
I would reserve
QUESTION:

The Government, in its brief, says that

even if you are right the

conspiracy is a lesser included

offense of this new statutory offense, nonetheless, the law is
not all that clear that it violates the Double Jeopardy Clause-bo
try somebody for the greater offense after conviction of the
lesser included offense.
MR* BOWER:

The Government takes that position,

Your Honor*
QUESTION:

Yes;, and you haven't, I don't think,

directed yourself very much to that, have you?
MR. BOWER:

1 simply comment that I do not feel that

that is the current status of the law before this Court.

I

know of. no case holding in which they have allowed conviction
of the lesser followed by a subsequent prosecution for the
greater, except in those rare instances such as Diaz in which
there was a conviction for some type of an assault, the victim
later died and then a reindictment on, I believe, manslaughter.
QUESTION;

Is there any case from this Court in which

it has been prohibited on grounds of double jeopardy?
MR. BOWERS:

Well, Jeffers contends Robinson v. Neil

and Waller v. Florida impliedly state that this Court has
adopted a lesser included offense rule.

This Court's action in

both those cases, remanding for purposes of determination

16

whether or not it was the same offense, impliedly accepts the
lesser included offense rule because in Robinson you had
destruction of public property and then a subsequent theft
charge, and in Waller a similar situation.
QUESTION:
included offense.

We didn't say to see if it was a lesser
We said to see if it was the same offense.

MR. BOWER:

Well, Your Honor, it is obvious they were

not identical by title.
QUESTION:

In other words, the same exact offense.

Neither of those opinions in this Court

discussed this issue, precisely, did it?
MR. BOWER:

No.

I would point out, and I have in my brief at length,
that Robinson v. Nell on remand from this Court did discuss
it at length and basically stated that the lesser included
offense rule should control the -QUESTION:

That was the decision of the Court of

Appeals ?
MR. BOWER:

Honor.

very difficult to apply that case because you wouldn’t know

It may even be

more difficult because you wouldn't be able to identify.

If

you tried to apply Ashe to it, you would have a difficult time
because how would you show to this Honorable Court the reason
for the not guilty?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume, then, at

1:00 o'clock, Mr. Sheehan.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o’clock, noon, the argument in
the above-entitled matter was recessed, to reconvene at
1:00 o'clock, p.m„, the same day.)

AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:00 p.m.)
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Sheehan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F„ SHEEHANs 111, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, SHEEHAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this case, we have made several arguments in the
alternative,any one of which is, in our view, sufficient
standing alone to warrant an affirmance of the judgment of the
Court of Appeals,
In the early part of our brief, we explain why we
believe that under this Court's analysis in the lannelll
decision a conspiracy is not a lesser included offense but a
continuing criminal enterprise.
Those arguments which are essentially matters of
statutory construction are laid out fully in our brief,

An$

with the Court's permission^ I' 11 move on directly to some of
our arguments which are perhaps more conceptually difficult.
QUESTION:

In your brief is the phrase "in concert"

or acting in concert with -~
MR, BOWER:

In concert with, yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

We have urged that that phrase does not use — that
that statute does not use the language of conspiracy.
not use the language of agreement.

It does

Congress knew in creating

20

this act how to use those words»
it did so in Section 849»
QUESTION:

It did so in Section 846 and

It did not do so in Section 848»

And if you are right in terms of strictly

statutory interpretation then you say it follows without any
doubt that there is no double jeopardy violation?
MR, SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Mr, Justice.

Your argument in the second statute is

based on the difference between the word "in concert with"
and "in agreement with,"

If the statute said "in agreement

with" you'd concede you. are wrong, I assume.
MR, SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's probably correct.

Is there any case that you know of that

construes the words "in concert with” as not meaning "in
agreement with"?
MR, SHEEHAN:

Well, I know of no case that has

squarely faced that issue.

There are decisions in the Court

of Appeals which have upheld convictions of defendants on both
Section 846 conspiracies and Section 848 continuing criminal
enterprise convictions.
QUESTION:

I haven't read those, other than Judge

Sprecher's opinion in this case because he did so on the theory
that they were the same,
MR, SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

He did, indeed.

Do those others adopt your statutory

theory or did they adopt his theory or are they unclear?

21
MR* SHEEHAN:

They are unclear.

They adopt neither*

The first of the remaining arguments I would like to
touch on in our brief is perhaps the narrowest of those argumenfcs, and that is that the petitioner,having insisted that the
charges against him not be tried in one case, cannot now complain
that they were, in keeping with his wishes, tried in two trials.
If the Court agrees with our position in this regard,
then it will be unnecessary to dec5.de whether a conspiracy is,
in fact, a lesser included offense of a continuing criminal
enterprise*
QUESTION:

Even if we decide it is.

MR, SHEEHAN:

Yes, that's right.

You can decide this

issue even assuming that it is a lesser included offense.
The indictment charging Petitioner with a conspiracy
and the indictment charging him with a continuing criminal
enterprise were returned on the same day by the same grand jury*
The Government then moved to consolidate those two
indictments for trial in one case.
objected.

He argued

The Petitioner, however,

I am reading from page 15 of the

Appendix — This is his objection.to the Government's motion
to consolidate

that consolidation of these indictments would

be improper in this case for the reasons that neither the
parties nor the charges are the same.

He said, at page 18 of

the Appendix, that the Government was attempting to consolidate
a conspiracy of ten defendants with a substantive offense of

22

only one defendant.
He said to acid a substantive defense to the con­
spiracy charge would only confuse the jury.

And he concluded*

on page 23 of the Appendix, that consolidation would be wrong
since there is "neither an identify of defendants nor an iden­
tity of charges" in the two indictments.
His arguments, of course, prevailed.

The District

Court denied the Government's motion and ordered that the
indictments be tried separately as they were.
Prior to trial, in the instant case, the Petitioner
moved to dismiss the indictment, completely reversing his
position and now arguing that the Government was at fault for
not joining all the charges against him in one case.

This is

at page 29 of the Appendix.
Petitioner also argued that once the District Court
had heeded to his request that the indictments be tried in two
trials, then the Government was obliged, Petitioner said, by
the Double Jeopardy Clause,to elect which indictment it vjould
bring to trial against him and to forego prosecution on the
other.
That motion, of course, ivas not granted.
In his reply brief, for the first time in this case,
Petitioner now takes yet a third position.

He argues that his

objection bo the Government's motion to consolidate has been
misinterpreted all this time.

He says, at page 5 of his reply

23
brief* that he was objecting not to trial of both charges
together in a single trial but to the presence of the other
conspiracy defendants in' the same case with him.
The suggestion* in short* is that the Petitioner
actually wanted all of the charges brought against him in a
single case involving!him alone»
The record flatly refutes this.
It is true that in the objection — In his objection
to the Government's motion to consolidate*the Petitioner said
that he feared that the evidence of overt acts of his coconspirators which would be admissible against him in the
conspiracy case would carry over and prejudice him,in the
jury's mind*

on the continuing criminal enterprise charge,

But the remedy* said Petitioner, was to try the
charges separately* not to try him alone*free of all the. other
defendants.

Indeed* if the charges had been tried separately

that very same evidence would have been admissible — the
evidence of his co-conspirators' overt acts — whether or not
they were named as co-defendants in a. case charging him with
both conspiracy and a continuing criminal enterprise.
Furthermore* the docket entries in the two cases
show the Petitioner never wanted both charges tried together.
The indictments were returned on March 18th.
conspiracy charge was set first for May 20«

Trial on the
Trial on the

continuing criminal enterprise charge was set for June 24th,

24
In early April, the Government moved to consolidate,.
On April 29th, Petitioner filed hla objections to that motion
and a hearing was held on April 30th.
clusive*

That hearing was incon­

It was continued over to May 7th.
In between the first part of that hearing on April 30th

and the second cn May 7th, the Petitioner moved to postpone the
continuing criminal enterprise from its initial date of June
24th over to August 12th.

That motion was granted.

That was not, -we submit, the action of one who wanted
to go to trial on both charges in a single case.
QUESTION:
this argument.

Mr. Sheehan, just help me a little bit on

Are you arguing estoppal or waiver, or what is

exactly the legal significance of the fact that he opposed the
motion to consolidate and delayed the trial?
MR, SHEEHAN:

Well, we think that the Petitioner

stands in the same relation to the Double Jeopardy Clause as
does a defendant who secures in the middle of his trial a
mistrial, or who consents to a mistrial.
Indeed, we think the Petitioner stands roughly in the
same posture vis-a-vis the Double Jeopardy Clause as a defendant
who appeals his conviction and gets a new. trial.
Now, the reason that a new trial Is permitted, not­
withstanding that jeopardy is already attached.

Whenever a

defendant requests mistrial, or consents to one ~QUESTION:

If you are making that argument, you are

25
saying then jeopardy for this offense did attach at the other
trial»
Is that what you are saying?
MR, SHEEHAN:
attach»

No.

It isn't important that jeopardy

What's important is that the Petitioner retain primary

control over the course to be followed*
That is the reason why, for example, when a case has
already started before the jury and the defendant requests a
mistrial, he can be tried again.
This Court has said that

■ has explained that result

not so much in terms of waiver t^hich the Court has held that
traditional waiver concepts are not particularly relevant under
a double jeopardy analysis.

What is important is that the

defendant, in this case the Petitioner, retains primary control
over the course to be followed,»
In this case that happened*
one trial*

Petitioner wanted two.
QUESTION:

The Government wanted

He retained primary control.

Did he ever say he wanted two trials, or

did he just say he didn't ‘want both trials on the first
occasion?
MR. SHEEHAN:

Well, there were two trials that were

scheduled, one for May and one for June.
to consolidate them.

The Government moved

The Petitioner opposed that consolidation.

That's pretty close to saying he wanted two trials, it seems
to me.

He wanted the status quo maintained, that was two trials.

26

QUESTION:

So you donPt contend that there is either

a waiver or an estoppel?
MR. SHEEHAN:

Well, I don11 use either of those

labels „
QUESTION:

Is there any established legal doctrine

that you say applies, is what I am trying to find out,
MR, SHEEHAN:

Yes, I think that the established

legal doctrine that permits, for example, a retrial after a
defendant requests a mistrial.
QUESTION:

What do you call that doctrine?

MR, SHEEHAN:

Well, this Court has declined to call

it a waiver or an estoppel, although the concepts are quite
similar.
The word "waiver" connotes, for example a Joanson v.
Zerost standard, and the Court has consistently refused to
adopt that standard in cases involving the Double Jeopardy
Clause.
But I think the result and the concept is essentially
the same.

The defendant got what he wanted„

For him now to

sajr that he is immunized from prosecution on the second charge
when the Government wanted to go forward with both eharges
together in one trial perhaps that can be said to have stoppedhim or that he waived.

In any event, his control over the

proceeding now disables him from claiming protection by the
Double Jeopardy Clause,

27
QUESTION:

But at no time did he say he wanted two

MR. SHEEHAN:

Well# he was going to go to two trials.

*•- As a matter of fact# he said he didn’t

He pleaded not guilty# didn't he?

MRi, SHEEHAN:

He pleaded not guilty and he would have

preferred to have no trials# but that certainly is not a
protection granted by the Double Jeopardy Clause.
QUESTION:

You could punish him for asking for two

trials,
MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

No# we are not punishing -**

— If you. are saying that he is saying

I don't want to be tried on both of these at the same time.
MR. SHEEHAN:

We are not punishing him.

We are

trying to avoid the Government’s being punished for the
District Court’s granting his motion to try these cases
separately when the Government wanted to try them together.
QUESTION:

If you had originally said that you were

going to go for two trials and you had not made the motion to
consolidate# wouldn’t he be In the same position he is in now?
MR. SHEEHAN:

If we had not moved to consolidate

would he be In the same position he is in now?
QUESTION:

Uh# huh.

MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

No# I don’t think so.

You said it was his action and I think it

28

probably was your action because you made the motion to
consolidate,,

That's ail I am saying.

MR. SHEEHAN:

Well, the Government could have

returned these two charges against the Petitioner in one —
in a two-count indictment, presumably, and presumably, at that
point the Petitioner would have moved to sever the counts.
And, presumably, the District Court would have been persuaded
by his arguments,
QUESTION:

But the record, as we have it, is, one,

two indictments; two, two dates for trial, one on each indict­
ment; three, your motion to consolidate and his opposition to
the motion to consolidate.
MR, SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

That's exactly right.

So it wasn't his volition.

It was yours.

You mad a the motion.
MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

No, we made the motion for one trial.

Yes,

MR, SHEEHAN:

We tried to bring these two counts --

these charges against him —» in a single trial.

The only reason

T

they resulted in two trials was because Petitioner insisted
that they take place in two trials.

I

i

QUESTION:

What was the practical consequence jof the

two trials rather than the one?
MR. SHEEHAN:
Mr, Ju.sfc.ice.

I

I am not sure I understand your question,

29
QUESTION:

Well, If I understood more about your

argument, perhaps, I could articulate the question better.
Is the result of all this that the Government had to
go to trial first on a lesser offense and when it got a guilty
verdict on that it was prevented from trying for the greater
offense?
MR. SHEEHAN:

Well, I think that Ss his argument.

That is his argument.
QUESTION:

Is that, in fact, what happened?

MR. SHEEHAN:

Well, we don't think the Government

was prohibited from going to trial on the continuing criminal
enterprise, even assuming it is a greater offense.
QUESTION:

Was he, in fact, tried for the lesser

offense first?
MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION;

He was tried for the conspiracy first.

Which the defendant contends Is the

lesser offense?
MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION;

That1s correct»

And you say that had the Government had

its druthers and known of these contentions at the time they
would have tried him for both offenses jointly, or else would
have tried him for the greater offense first?
MR. SHEEHAN:

Well, the Government sought to bring

tiiese cases — tried to bring them jointly.

The Government

has never taken the position that they are lesser and greater

30

included offenses.

They tried to bring them together*

Now, let's assume they are greater and lesser
offenses,

Then the result of Petitioner's argument is that

whenever a defendant is charged with an offense that can be
broken down into a lesser included offense and can persuade the
District Court to order the Government to try the lesser in­
cluded offense separately from the greater, and the lesser
included offense first, then he is thereafter immunized from
prosecution on the greater offense.
We submit that -QUESTION:

I suppose the Speedy Trial Act might give

the defendant in a particular situation some ammunition to force
the District judge to do that.
MR. SHEEHAN:

I don't know why speedy trial considera­

tions -- No, I think speedy trial considerations would militate
in favor of both charges being tried in a single trial together
rather than separating them.
QUESTION:

If there were different dates.

If there

was a substantial 3.apse of time between the two indictments it
certainly would enter into it.
MR, SHEEHAN:

Well, I think if there were substantial

lapse of time in the two indictments, even in that case,to try
both charges together would bring both charges to trial and to
culmination at the soonest available — at the soonest moment
possible.

31

QUESTION:

Who made the decision as to which -- after

it was decided the two cases 'would not be consolidated, who
decided which should go first?
MR* SHEEHAN:

I am not — The record doesn't show

that, but I think that vie can make some inferences from the
record,

The conspiracy trial was set first, for May 20th, and

the continuing criminal enterprise for June 24th.
On May 7th, when the District Court refused to grant
the Government's motion to consolidate, by that time the con­
tinuing criminal enterprise charge had been pushed off to
August 12th.

Now, by that time, also, there were some 75

docket entries in the conspiracy case, involving ten defendants,
involving all of those defendants,
activity had already taken place.

Substantial pre-trial
That trial was always

scheduled to go first and it involved ten defendants.

It made

sense -CUESTION:

Did the Government ever request that the

greater offense, assuming the other side's characterization,
that that trial go forward first?
MR* SHEEHAN:

No.-

And, in fact, if a defendant wanted to have a lesser
included offense and a greater offense tried separately in most
cases it would make sense to try the lesser first because if you
tried the greater first that would, by definition, include
oriaA oi the xesser, unless the jury got some sort of special

32

instruction.
1 was saying that Petitioners action in this case
puts him in the same position as one who requests a mistrial.
I also
QUESTION:

Just let me ask one other question»

Now far does your position go on trying the lesser
and later you are free to try the greater?
Supposing you have, as in your bank robbery statute,
the series of four or five series, each one a little bit larger
than the one in the preceding subparagraph?
Would you say the Constitution would not present any
obstacle to a series of, say, five or six trials?

You get what

you can the first time, then you corne back and try for a little
more the second time.
MR. SHEEHAN:

I say the Double Jeopardy Clause would

not prohibit successive trials, so long as the defendant was
never twice in jeopardy on the same offense,

1

lie would have the protection of the Due Process
Clause if it appeared that successive prosecutions by the

Government were for no good reason but to harass the defendant,
something along that line,
QUESTION:

What if there were an indictment for

manslaughter and a trial and conviction of manslaughter?

Could

a federal or state government then indict him for first degree
mu :der for exactly the same killing and try him for that

33
despite the Double Jeopardy Clause?
MR9 SHEEHAN:

I think if he is then -- I think, that

the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the trial of a
defendant on a greater offense after he has been convicted on a
lesser included offense* provided that at neither trial is he
twice in jeopardy for either of the other offenses»
QUESTION:
twice in jeopardy.

The whole issue is whether or not he is
That’s a question begging answer,

MR, SHEEHAN:

I certainly didn’t mean it to be.

In the example that you put, at the trial on, I think
you said, manslaughter -~
QUESTION:

Yes, a trial and conviction of manslaughter

and then a subsequent indictment, trial and trial of murder for
the same killing.

Is that permissible under the Double Jeopardy

Clause?
MR* SHEEHAN:

It would be in these circumstances:

At the trial for manslaughter, the defendant was not in jeopardy
of conviction or punishment on the first degree murder charge.
QUESTION:

That’s right, because he was only charged

with manslaughter.
MR, SHEEHAN;

Right,

And in-the trial on the first

degree murder charge, the defendant could not be allowed to be
placed in Jeopardy for conviction of the lesser Included offense
of manslaughter, and if he were convicted on the greater any
punishment that he received on the lesser would have to be givers

34
credit.
This, I think, is the Diaz case,
QUESTION:

I am not talking about somebody who —

the trial of assault and then that person subsequently dies,
I am talking about a homicide,
MR, SHEEHAN:

I understand.

I think that the Diaz

case stands for the broader proposition than the narrow facts
on which it was decided.
QUESTION:

Well, then, what's your answer to my

question?
MR. SHEEHAN:

Yes, provided that -- Yes, he could be

tried on the indictment for first degree murder,
QUESTION:

Let me get this straight.

You said he

would get credit for the time he served on the lesser offense,
MR. SHEEHAN:

Yes,

You would have to avoid a double

punishment,

The man is charged with manslaughter and

given five years, then he is charged with second degree murder
for the same killing and he gets fifteen years, but he gets the
five taken off the fifteen, right?
die.

And then he is sentenced to

What credit does he get there?
MR, SHEEHAN:

I don’t know the answer to that.

think it would be hard to give him any credit there,

I

I do say

that the Due Process Clause would protect the defendant against QUEST ion :

You mean that a man robs a federal bank and

35
he is charged with receiving stolen goods and then he is charged
with robbery* then he is charged with robbery with force and then
he is convicted of robbery with deadly weapon.
MR0 SHEEHAN:

I think probably the Due Process

Clause would prohibit that series of prosecutions.
QUESTION:

But you don't think that's double jeopardy?

MRo SHEEHAN:

Not so long as he is never twice placed

in jeopardy on the same offense.
QUESTION:

What if a defendant is first indicted for

robbing a bank which had federal insurance* under the appropriate
federal statute* that bank being located in Hammond* Indiana*
and then charged with transportation of the proceeds of a bank
robbery across state lines, assuming there was a federal statute
prohibiting that?
Do you think that punishment after trial and
conviction on both of those charges, even though they involved
-precisely the same acts, would violate the Double Jeopardy
Clause?

*
MR„ SHEEHAN:

No.

I think chose are, not the same

offenses under the Blockburger test.
would be perfectly permissible.

I think that prosecution

I think the situation you just-

hypothesized does not involve greater and lesser included
offenses.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think — The Blockburger test,

by its terns, doesn't refer to the Double Jeopardy Clause,

36
does it?
MR, SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

That's correct, it doesn't.

It is «—

Intent of Congress.

MR, SHEEHAN;

— It Is a formula for identifying the

identity of the offenses.
Wells I said a moment ago that I thought that the
Diaz case stands for the broad proposition that I have just
advanced.

At the very least, I submit, it stands for the

narrower proposition that prosecution on the greater offense
can be had following conviction on a lesser Included offense,
whenever at the time of the trial of the lesser included offenst
the Government, for good reason, was not able to charge the
greater offense.
Thus, for example, if the greater crime has not yet
actually been committed when the lesser is tried, as in the
Diaz case, or, for example, if the defendant can conceal the
full extent of his crime from the Government, so that the
Government does not know the greater offense has been committed
when the lesser is tried, or, as in the present case, if the
Government is prohibited by order of court from trying both
cases together, then, we submit, the Double Jeopardy Clause
does not bar prosecution for the greater offense, provided,
of course, that there was a conviction on the lesser included
offense and provided that any punishment that he has suffered
on the lesser offense be credited.

37
QUESTION:

Although the Government was prohibited, by

order of court, from trying them both together, it was not
prohibited by order of court from trying the greater offense
first.
MR. SHEEHAN:

Mo, it was not, but since the Government

did not believe it was a greater offense there would be no —
Well
QUESTION:

At least it was aware there was a

possibility it might be so considered, I suppose.
MR. SHEEHAN:

No, it certainly was not.

The

defendant had argued quite strongly that they were different
cases.
QUESTION:

It doesn't accept its understanding of

the law on the basis of the defendant's arguments, does it?
MR. SHEEHAN:

No, but we continue to believe that

they are not greater and lesser included offenses,
QUESTION:
I am saying,

But you knew there was an issue, is all

At least you should have known there was an

issue, I would think,
MR. SHEEHAN:
issue.

Let's assume that we knew there was an

It would still make sense to try the lesser first,

I submit, especially since the lesser offense involved ten
defendants.

But there was no issue raised about which trial

would go first.

The conspiracy was always set to go first.

Furthermore, when the District Court ruled that the

38
cases could no'c be consolidated, it had already ruled against
us that the eases were even — bore such a close resemblance
to each other that they were appropriate for consolidation,
QUESTION:
your favor.

Weil, in that respect, it had ruled in

It had held that they were separate offense,

hadn't it?
MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And that's your claim now.

one was not a lesser included offense.

It ruled that

In that respect, it had

ruled favorably to you,
MR. SHEEHAN:

That's correct.

Our position. I think, fully respects the policies
that underly the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Two prosecutions, in a situation such as I’ve just
described, do not represent judge shopping by the prosecution
in order to secure a sentence that the Government seeks that
appears to be appropriate from the point of view of the
Government alone.

Nor do they represent an effort by the

Government to try a defendant repeatedly until a conviction
is obtained contradicting earlier acquittals and perhaps
casting doubt on the integrity of earlier trials.
It is true that the defendant may live in a con­
tinuing state of anxiety

that he will some day be tried for

*

the greater offense, but if the defendant has concealed the
full extent of his crime, or if, as here, he himself requests

39
two trials, that anxiety cannot be said to have been caused by
any misconduct on the part of the Government.
As I mentioned earlier, our position does not leave
the defendant at the mercy of a prosecutor who would carve up
an offense into a series of underlying offenses and bring a
series of vexatious prosecutions up the ladder, as it is said.
The Due Process Clause fully protects the defendant
from such governmental conduct, even if, because he is never
twice put in jeopardy, he cannot claim protection under the
Double Jeopardy Clause,
QUESTION:

Mr, Sheehan, help me, If maybe I missed it.

The Government could have indicted in one indictment with two
counts, right?
MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct, Mr, Justice.

And for some reason that you don't know and

I don't know they decided to do it in two indictment®.
MR. SHEEHAN:
, QUESTION:
no way

Yes, that's correct.

And if they: had put it: in two, there is

he could have challenged that? .
MR. SHEEHAN:

single indictment?

If they had put both counts in the

sever the counts,
wUh&TXUN:

he could haver

mil, SHEEHjaN:
he would have,

Yes, I thinn — X would presume that

I presume his objections to auin& to trial on

40
both those charges together vjculd have been the same.
QUESTION:

So we come out the same way.

MR. SHEEHAN:

So we come out the same.

Indeed, for example, suppose the District Court had
granted our order and it had gone on up to the Court of Appeals
and the petitioner in the Court of Appeals had argued that the
motion to consolidate had been improperly granted by the
District Court and the Appellate Court accepted its position
and sent it back for a new trial, separate trial, on the
continuing criminal enterprise?

I think the defendant would be

hard put to say that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred that
trial.
I think he is in the same position as he would have
been in persuading the Court of Appeals to order two trials,
as he is today, having persuaded the District Court to order
two trials.
QUESTION:

I wonder if that follows, because isn't

one of the reasons for his position that they should be
separate trials the fact that there were a lot of defendants
in the conspiracy trial with respect to whom prejudicial
evidence would be introduced, who were not defendants in the
continuing criminal enterprise trial?
MR. SHEEHAN:

Well, he said he feared that the

evidence of his co-conspirators' overt acts would come in and
that would carry over.

But that evidence would be admissible

41

if he was tried in one trial on both the conspiracy and the
continuing criminal enterprise.

The evidence of his co-

conspirators ’ overt, acts would be admissible against him on
the conspiracy charge, even if they were not named as codefendants,

That requires an instruction by the District

Court to the jury that they should not consider the evidence
of overt acts on the continuing criminal enterprise charge,
QUESTION:

I see,

MR, SHEEHAN:

Now, the Petitioner argues that our

position is foreclosed by this Court's decisions in Waller v,
Florida and Robinson v. Neil.
Those cases, in our view, do not hold that prosecution
for greater offense is always barred by an earlier conviction
on a lesser included offense.
Indeed, that issue was not raised or argued in those
cases.

They involved the question whether a municipality and

a state were dual sovereigns\under the Double Jeopardy Clause.
And, holding that they were not, the Court cannot be said to
have passed upon or resolved the questions presented here.
If those questions had been presented and passed —
If those questions had been resolved in Nailer or in Robinson,
then, presumably, the Court could have decided Blackiedge v.
Perry on double jeopardy grounds.

And, perhaps, the Court

would not have granted a writ of certiorari in the case to be
argued next, Brown v_. Ohio.

42

I think that the issue Is an open one.
is the first time it is presented to the Court.

I think this
And I would

repeat, in closing, that the Due Process Clause is available
to prevent the prosecutor fran carving up crimes and bringing
a series of prosecutions for no good reason.
The Double Jeopardy Clause, however, applies only
when a defendant is tw5.ce put in jeopardy for the same offense.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bower.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN BOWER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR.. BOWER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I direct my rebuttal time directly to the alleged
waiver issue.
1 must agree with Justice Stevens when he queried
the Government’s representative as to whether or not this, in
fact, is an estoppel or a waiver argument.
QUESTION:

What would you call it v?hen a defendant

moves for mistrial after he has been exposed to jeopardy and
mistrial is granted and then he is tried again?

Would you call

that waiver or estoppel, or what?
MR. BOWER;

I would call it, Judge, Your Honor, a

waiver with a small ”w.,!
for it.

I don't think there has been a name

I must agree with Mr. Sheehan in this instance.

And

I find no problems with a retrial after a granted motion for a

43
mistrial when made by the defendant.
And* quite frankly, I don’t see how it is controlling
here.
And the reason why is that in this case there was a
ten-defendant conspiracy indictment and the objections to the
consolidation were filed by all of the defendants.
pleading is in the file — is in the Appendix.

The

Much of the

argument in there is by the other remaining defendants in not
wanting to toe tried with Jeffers on the continuing criminal
enterprise trial.
Jeffers’ argument, also, may it please the Court,
on page 20, points out that the — He is talking about a
steamroller effect upon the minds of the jury.

The sheer

aggregate of evidence amassed by the Government and provided
to the jury would create an inference of criminal disposition
based upon mere association with other defendants with whom
the evidence is stronger.
So, what we have is a standard assertion that all of
the defendants will not receive a fair trial by this prejudicial
joinder or this trial together.
I-submit to the Court that the United States v.
Simmons holds that you cannot penalise the exercise of a
constitutionally protected right by requiring in order to
exercise it you must waive another right.
The Government would ask this Court to rule that when

44
Jeffers, including the other nine defendants in the conspiracy
when Jeffers sought to prevent the trial together, which is
a Sixth Amendment right to have a fair trial, he, of necessity,
had to waive Fifth Amendment rights.
And this goes bach to Justice Stevenson's comment,
or question
to the Government:
i

Is this a waiver of constitu-

tional rights?
I submit that for the Court to rule there is a
waiver — there has been a waiver of double Jeopardy rights,
of Fifth Amendment rights, and that the record is simply
absent in shewing the type of knowing, intelligent and
voluntary waiver that is required of a basic fundamental
constitutional right.
QUESTION:

Do you think each of these indictments

required exactly the same proof or is there some proof required
for each that was not required in the other?
MR. BOWER:

The continuing criminal enterprise

required more proof, especially concerning income, Your Honor,
but the conspiracy evidence was identical.

As a matter of

fact —
QUESTION:
identical.

That's not the issue, whether it was

Was the Government required to prove something as

to each indictment that -was not required to prove the other?
Not whether they- did, in fact.
MR. BOWER:

Concerning Jeffers, no, Your Honor.

*5
The Government, of course, with a multi-defendant
conspiracy, would have to prove a tie-in of each defendant into
the conspiracy.

That wasn't required in Jeffers* ease, but,

of course, Jeffers had to be tied in,
QUESTION:

Isn’t it almost a definition of a lesser

included offense that the lesser .included offense involves the
same proof as the greater included offense, but that the greater
included offense — but that the greater offense involves the
proof to the 'lesser offense, plus X, plus something more?

MR» BOWER:
QUESTION:
MR. BOWER:
QUESTION:
MR, BOWER:

Yes, thafc!s correct,
That's what it means, isn't it?
That's right,
Like manslaughter and first degree murder,
Right,

You've got a question of intent.

In this instance, if I may go back to the waiver,
we do not know why the trial court refused to grant the motion
for trial together.
And I must point out that Jeffers did not object, or
did not take a stance that there could never be a trial together.
What he claimed was that there would be a prejudicial joinder
if the ten-denfendant conspiracy was tried with the continuing
criminal enterprise.
When the trial court granted his objection, the
Government was in this position:

They had a pending conspiracy

charge against him and a pending continuing criminal enterprise.

The Government.* then, was the one that proceeded the
trial on the conspiracy first.

\

r

Jeffers did not cause, demand or was responsible for
the conspiracy trial being tried first.
The Government had a very simple option.

They could

have moved to sever Jeffers from the conspiracy trial and
tried him with the continuing criminal .enterprise later.
What I am submitting to the Court is that Jeffers 1
actions in seeking a fair trial, free of prejudicial joinder,
in no way can be interpreted, or should in no way be inter­
preted to mean that he forever waived double jeopardy rights.
QUESTION:

If the Government had followed the

option that you just suggested, could it have properly requested
a lesser included offense instruction in the trial?
MR. BOWER:

Most assuredly.

I would suggest that

Justice Powell in Iannelli, Footnotes 17 and 18, pointed out
the proper procedure in that, and I reiterate it to the Court
that that’s the way to handle it.

And that’s a very practical,

sensible way to handle it, because the penalty for continued
criminal enterprise, obviously, covers the evils sought to be
prohibited by a conspiracy.
I would submit that the «— at least Justice

Burger

has recognized that the same evidence rule is a matter of
constitutional import.
I would suggest, also, to the Court, that if this

^7
Court recognizes the same evidence rule, it must of necessity
follow along with the lesser included offense rule, because
by the definition set forth in Biockburger, applying it to the
case at bar, the conspiracy was proven, both in the conspiracy
case and the continuing criminal enterprise.
The only additional elements in the continuing
criminal enterprise had to do with Jeffers' position as
rnsnager and the fact he received substantial income.
So, I submit to the Court that the first trial and
conviction on the conspiracy as a lesser included offense and
the continuing criminal enterprise should, under the rules of
double jeopardy, bar subsequent prosecution for the continuing
criminal enterprise.
QUESTION; . But Blockburger was not rested on the
Double Jeopardy Clause.
MR. BONER:
QUESTION:

Correct,
Then why do you cite Blockburger for the

proposition that you just said?
MR, BOWER:

I cite it because it has traditionally

been viewed and used by lower courts for these purposes.
QUESTION:
MR, BOWER:

Are those decisions binding on us?
No, but I think if there is any doubt,

I urge this Court to adopt It, to make it clear that we have
this constitutional protection, the double jeopardy, and that
the way that we apply it is through the same evidence test.

43
For years, cases have been coming before this Court
concerned with same evidence versus same transaction, and the
Court has repeatedly held that the same transaction rule is
not what the Double (Jeopardy Clause was meant to cover.
If it isn't the same evidence rule, I would submit
we have no viable double Jeopardy provision.
So I would urge the Court that the lesser included
offense rule is simply an extension of the same evidence rule,
and that,if not elevated to constitutional standard by this
Court,should be elevated to such standard.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:37 o'clock, p.m„, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
