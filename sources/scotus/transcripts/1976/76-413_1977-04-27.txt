MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

now in 76-413, United States v. Larionoff.
Mr. Jones, you may proceed whenever you axe ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The issue in this case which arises under a statute
that has since been repealed is whether the variable r©enlist­
ment. bonus of an enlisted man who extends his enlistment in the
military service is computed as of the date he signs his exten­
sion agreement or, instead, as of the later date in which he
enters into service of the extension period.
This issue involves approximately $60 or $7 0 million
in military pay, and this Court granted certiorari to resolve
a conflict among the circuits.
In order to understand this case, it is necessary
first to understand the considerations that led to enactment of
statutory authority for payment of variable r©enlistment
bonuses, also to understand the manner in which the Department
of Defense exercised that authority.
The statute was enacted in 1965, during the first
major phase of this country’s military undertaking in Vietnam.
At that time, the Department of Defense was concerned that

4
enlisted m©n possessing critical military skills would reenter
civilian life at the end of their original enlistment periods,
leaving the Department of Defense with the essential but ex­
pensive task of training new men in those skills.
It was determined that the offer of a large boms in
addition to the existing so-called regular reenlistment boms
might induce, substantial numbers of enlisted men to reenlist at
the end of their original enlistment periods.
It was further determined that the size of the bonus
in each case should depend upon the importance of the particu­
lar military skill to the military.

Accordingly, Congress

authorized the Secretary of Defense to assign to each military
skill an award level, ranging from zero to four, depending upon
the importance of that skill to the military at that. time.
These award levels were subject to annual review and modifica­
tion as th© military’s needs changed.
The bonus, called -the variable reenlistment bonus,
was equal to the regular reenlistmsnt bonus multiplied by the
award level in effect for the enlisted man’s skill level at
the time of his reenlistment.
For present purposes, the most significant aspects
of this history are that the variable reenlistment bonus statute
by its terms refers only to reenlistments, not to extensions of
enlistments, and that there is no indication in the legislative
history that either th© Department of Defense or Congress gave

5
consideration to how or csvan whether the variable reenlistment
bonus program would apply to extensions of enlistment.
Now, this is important because extensions differ from
raanlistments in two fundamental respects.
timing.

They differ as to

An extension typically is entered into right at the

outset of the man's military service, whereas, by contrast, a
reenlistmsnt only takes place at the end of that original en­
listment period.
QUESTION:

Has this been your position throughout?

MR. JONES:

Has what been our position throughout,

Mr. Justice White?
QUESTION:

Has what you just said?

MR. JONES:

Oh, yes.

There is a clear difference be­

tween extensions and reenlistments.
QUESTION:

And has your —

MR. JONES:

Oh, I am not arguing that the statute —

that the bonus program doesn't apply to extensions.

I am just

explaining, if you will give me time, how it applies.
QUESTION:

All right.

Would you repeat what you

just said?
MR. JONES:
listments in two ways.

I said the extensions differ from reen­
I just described one way in which they

differ, that is as to timing.

The extension is entered into at

tbs beginning of the period of service; the reenlistment is
entered into only at the end of the original enlistment period.

6

The second difference is more important: for this
case, and that is the difference in motivations

An enlisted

man extends his enlistment at th© outsat of his military
service in order to qualify for specialized training that will
lead to higher pay in th© military and in some cases at least
to a tetter career in civilian life after he leaves the mili­
tary»
As a condition of eligibility for specialized -train­
ing of this kind, the military requires, often requires a
longer mininum service commitment than th© original enlistment
period, and th© enlisted man extends his enlistment at the
beginning in order to satisfy that condition of eligibility and
to receive th© specialized training.
In contrast, a reenlistment is entered into only at
th© end of the original enlistment period.

There is no built-

in incentive other than the pay, allowances and other enjoy­
ments that the military life generally may afford.
Now, in view of these differences, we cannot know how
Congress would have legislated with respect to extensions of
enlistment if it had that matter, if it explicitly considered
that matter.

Congress might have concluded that the incentive

of specialized training was sufficient alone to induce exten­
sions and that no additional bonus need be provided.
On the other hand, in view of —
QUESTION;

Extension of enlistment would be typically

what, from —
MR. JONES:

From four years to six years.

th© extension in this case.
period of time.

That is

It could be for a lesser or greater

The original enlistment period here was four

years.
In view of the differences in timing, that is that
the extension is entered, the extension agreement is signed at
the beginning, Congress, had. it considered the matter, might
have acted to clarify the question when the variable reenlist­
ment bonus accrues in cases of extensions, but it did neither.
The statute and th© legislative history are silent as
to the intended application of the variable reenlisfxnent bonus
program to extensions of enlistment.

Now, this is not to say

that the program does not apply to extensions of enlistment,
but it applies not by virtue of the language of the bonus
statute itself, former 37 U.S.C. 308(g), but rather as a conse­
quence of the general catchall provision in 37 U.S.C. 906,
which provides that a man who extends his enlistment is en­
titled to the same pay and allowances as are made available to
the man who reenlists.
This means that when Congress passed the bonus
statute, the Secretary of Defense was left with the delegated
responsibility of accommodating the bonus program to a group of
service members who extend their enlistments, but that had not
been within the explicit contemplation of Congress when it

8

enacted t.h© statute»
Now, the major question confronting the Secretary in
this regard was whether in cases of extensions the bonus was to
be measured on the. basis of the award level that was in effect
when the extension agreement was signed or instead on the basis
of the award level that was in effect on the later date when
the extended period was entered into.
Now, the former alternative would have concededly had
the advantage of relative certainty, that is at the time the
agreement was signed everyone would know what award level would
apply.
On the other hand, relative certainty as to the award
level that will apply to a bonus that will not be received for
several years might not be of major significance as compared
with the basic incentive of specialized training.
In any event, several other considerations militated
against measuring the .bonus as of the earlier date.

That form

of computation would have led to a potential disparity between
the treatment of reenlistments and extensions.

It would have

created the possibility that a man who entered into his exten­
sion period would receive a different bonus, perhaps greater,
perhaps smaller, depending upon what had happened to the award
level in the intervening time, from that received by a man who
entered into his reenlistment period on the same day and
possessing the same skill.

9
Now# fehis disparity in treatment could have been ex­
pected to have led to disputes and dissatisfaction and, mere
than that, it. would appear to ba contrary to the statutory
command of equal treatment for extensions and raenlistments.
Furthermore, 37 U.S„C. 308(b) provides that a man who
reenlists during basic training is not entitled to the boms.
That statute would seem to suggest, in view of the requirement
of equal treatment, that the bonus could not immediately vest
in the case of an extension that was entered into, an extension

agreement that was signed during the period of basic training,
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, if a man dies somewhere along

the line, does that make any difference at all?
MR. JONES:

Well, if he dies before he enters into

his extension period, our position is that he is not entitled
to any bonus.

The matter hasn’t been fleshed out in litigation,

but I assume that would be the respondent's position, too.
There is a provision in the regulations for recoup­
ment if the extension period is not fully served, that is if
for sane reason the man leaves the service having finished only
one of the two years of his extension period, then they could
recoup one-half of his variable reenlistment bonus.
QUESTION:

Has that ever bean effectuated, to your

knowledge, if a man dies?
MR. JONES:

The record does not so show because the

case is up on summary judgment, but it is ray understanding that

1C
it is common to have recoupment in, situations like that.
Well, let me state further that the bonus is paid in
installments, so that the future installments simply would not
be paid.

I think that that more than an official recoupment

would b© the method by which the full boms would not be paid.
Moreover, permitting the bonus to vest at the time
the extension agreement was signed would also be inconsistent
with the Secretary's representation to Congress at the time the
bill was being considered that there would be no express or
implied obligation with respect to future payments of the
bonuses.
QUESTION:

I suppose there is no doubt, is there, Mr.

Jones, that if I enlist in the Army as a private and the pay is,
as in fact was mins, $50 a month, and I enlist for three years
and two months later Congress reduces the pay to $45, I have to
stay in the Army three years?

MR. JONES:

Absolutely, and the enlistment agreements

provide — and I will get to this a little bit further, but they
normally provide that they ar© entered into in consideration of
the pay that will accrue, whatever accrues is what th© man gets,
under the contract.
With considerations of the kind that I have just re­
cited presumably in mind, the Secretary promulgated regulations
that in his view provide for computation of the. variable rsenlistment. bonus on th® basis of the award level in effect on the

11

day that, the man enters into the extended period of service#
whether he enters into that service by way of reenlistment or
extension.
Mow# there can ba no question under the statute that
the Secretary had latitude to adopt this rule.

The only ques­

tion in this case is whether the regulations have the effect
that the Secretary intended.
Now# with this rather extensive background in mind,
I will discuss the particular facts of this case.

The respond­

ents are Navy enlisted men who at the outset of their service
extended their enlistments from four years to six years in
order to qualify for training in the Navy’s program of what was
called advanced electronics field.
Their extension agreements stated that they were
entered into, and I quote, "in consideration of the pay, allow­
ances and benefits which will accrue to me during the continu­
ances of my service."

The agreements did not state that the

respondents would be entitled at any point to a variable reen­
listment bonus.

Indeed, the agreements did not mention th®

variable reenlistment boms at all.
Now# pursuant to these extension agreements, each
respondent in fact did receive the advance electronics field
training# and 'that training led to qualification in tha Naval
skill rating called communications technician maintenance or
CTM.

12

Now, the problem in this case arises bacaus© at the
time the respondents signed their extension agreements, the CTM
aitfard level was set at four, the highest permissible.

But by

four years later, whan they entered into their extension
periods, -the award level, COM award level had been reduced to
zero.
Moreover, by the time respondent Johnson entered into
sarvic© of his extension period, Congress had already repealed
the statutory authority for payment of variable r©enlistment
bonuses.

Accordingly, the Navy refused to pay the respondents

the bonus.
Respondents then brought this suit, claiming that
their right to the bonus had accrued within the meaning of
their extension agreements at the time they signed those agree­
ments, and they requested payment of the bonus based upon an
award level of four, or in the alternative release from service.
Some of the respondents submitted affidavits in which
they stated that they had been promised payment of a variable
reenlistment bonus by recruiting officer, based upon the award
level of four.
In response, the head of the Navy’s variable r©enlist­
ment bonui program submitted an affidavit in which he stated,
and I quote, "It is not the policy of the Department of the
Navy to promise specific eligibility for variable reenlistment
bonus, nor is any official authorized to make such a premise in

13

counseling with th© prospective enlistee.”
The government also submitted to the court regulations
requiring reenlistment interviewers to inform enlistees of, and
I quote, "VRB program flexibility and possibility of changes
which might decrease the amount of boms to which entitled at
the time of reenlistment."
Both sides then moved for summary judgment.

The

District Court granted the respondents' request for payment of
the bonuses and denied their requests for release from service.
Both sides appealed and tha Court of Appeals affirmed.
One point should b@ clarified in connection with
these facts.

Respondents in this Court state as a fact that

they were premised bonuses based upon an award level of four,
but that allegation was disputed in the District Court and the
court made no findings with respect to that.
Moreover, by granting summary judgment for the respond­
ents, the District Court necessarily proceeded upon the assump­
tion that no such promise had been mad©.

In any event, we take

the position here that whether or not such a pronis® was mad®
is legally immaterial.
Insofar as respondents argue a theory of promissory
estoppel and they do not appear to do so in this Court, it is
wall established that the government is not estopped by the
unauthorized representations of its agents, and respondents

QUESTION:

These ware alleged oral promises by ra-

cruiting officers?
MR. JONES:

That is correct.

That was the allegation.

It was never found as a fact.
Respondents have abandoned their request for release
from service, which presumably was based upon sane theory of
misrepresentation or mutual mistake by failing to file a cross
petition from that portion of the judgment below that was ad­
verse to them.
Accordingly, respondents 1 claim for entitlement to
th® bonus turns upon the test of the applicable military regu­
lations.

Now, the Department of Defense Instruction 1304.15,

paragraph VI.A., which we discuss in our brief, provides that
members will receive the award level effective on th© date of
their extensiori of enlistment.

The term "extension of enlist­

ment" is not defined in th© regulation.
We show in some detail, however, at pages 28 to 3 0 of
our brief, that both the Navy regulations and the extension
agreements themselves provide that an extension does not become
effective until the day following the expiration of th© original
enlistment period.

Asad as a corollary — and this is th© mili­

tary's construction of its own regulations — the extension of
enlistment occurs only when service of the extension period
begins.

Now, this is a fair reading of the regulation, and we

submit that it should be sustained.

15
But moreover, as we point out in our .reply brief, at
page 2, if extension of enlistment war© read as the respondents
suggest, as referring to the signing of th© «octansion agreement,
then respondents would never have become even potentially
eligible to receive a variable resniiatment boms.

Paragraph

V.B.l.b. of th® regulation, which is set forth at page 59 of
the appendix, requires that to be ©ligibi© for a bonus, a
service members must have completed at least 21 months of con­
tinuous active service prior to extension of enlistment, and
respondents had not completed any substantial active service
before they signed their extension agreements.
In short, under the regulations respondents were en­
titled at most to tha award level that was in effect on the days
that they entered into service of their extension periods.
Sine® the CTM award level on those dates was zero, the Navy
properly refused payment of th© variable reenlistment bonuses.
Now, respondents claim, however, that paragraph V.B.l.f.
of the regulation, which is at page 61 of the appendix, implies
-- it doesn’t state but implies — that they are entitled to a
bonus.
all.

But that paragraph has no application to respondents at
It is designed solely to deal with th© fact that an award

level — excuse me, that a 90-day advance notice is given before
an award level is reduced or terminated.
Thera ar© service members so situated that upon hear­
ing that their award level was to bs reduced or terminated,

16

they would be able to obtain an early discharge under the regu­
lations and reanlist, or possibly to sign an extension agree­
ment toward the end of their period of service and then enter
into service of the extended period.
Paragraph V.B.l.f. is simply designed to present such
service members from obtaining a variable r«enlistment boms
based upon the older outgoing award level.

As to such service

members, the purpose of this provision is to make the reduction
or termination of award level effective inroad iately upon the
issuance of the notice.

That is the only purpose and effect

of this provision.
It does not apply to respondents and it would not
assist them even if it did.

Now, I would concede that th©s®

regulations could have been written in a manner better calcu­
lated to reveal their objectives to the non-military mind.
They are not plain on their face.

But they are interpreted and

applied in a manner that I have described.
This Court's statement in a similar context,
Immigration & Naturalization Service v. Stanisic, pertains her©
as well, and I will quote from that opinioni "Granting that
this regulation is not free from ambiguity, w© find it disposi­
tive that the agency responsible for promulgating and administer
ing th© regulation as interpreted it to apply,"
Th© Navy's interprstation her© is not plainly errone­
ous, it is not inconsistent with the language of th© regulation

17

a .rid should ther ef ore be given controlling weight, in this litig ation.
I have one final point.

Respondents argue that if

they are right and the military is wrong about the meaning of
the military's own regulations, then Congress acted unconsti­
tutionally in repealing the variable reenlistrnent bonus in a
manner that deprived payment of the bonus or denied payment of
the bonus to respondent Johnson.

If that is correct, then the illustration,

MR. JONES:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, the same line of

analysis could equally well be applied there, however we would
strongly resist such an interpretation just as we do here.

In­

deed, our point with regard to their argument of constitution­
ality is that that is simply one more argument in favor of the
military’s interpretation.

The military’s construction avoids

any constitutional question and therefore should b© preferred,

For these reasons,, we ask that the judgment below be re­

Yes, and then normally — "that courts

unnecessary to resolve these doubts one way or the other."

MR. JONES:

Well, not only for the reason that I

would hope but also because each of these named respondents
has already completed all of his extended period so there would

in th© service.

If they are in tha service now, it is because

they reenlisted or further extended -their agreements of their
extensions and not because of the agreement they entered into
in this case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN DANIEL KEEFFE, ESQ.,
t

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KEEFFE:

Mr. chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
We are dealing with an act of Congress that was
passed during the war, and th® bonuses before this Court war©
!

passed to induce these plaintiffs to extend their enlistments.
To understand what happened here, you have to look at
the legislative history of section 308(g) and you have to
listen as you read to the words of Secretary McNamara when he
asked for these bonuses.

He was faced with th© situation where

21
first—termers, that is men in our service, men and women in
our service who were under four-year contracts, were enlisting
at -the rate of 25 percent, and all other enlistments in our
services fell in the rate of 8 5 percent.

There was an astound­

ing attrition rate in that first term, and it was this finding
by the Secretary that drew him to the conclusion that something
else was needed to induce military personnel to extend their
enlistments;

this, coupled with the fact that the training

required for these men and women is very expensive.
The testimony in the Congress is that it was over
$10,000 a person, therefor©, of ccursa, if you lost a parson in
a critically undermanned

skill you would have to retrain them

at a substantial cost.
So in addition to training which was offered these
men and women, they were also offered bonuses, substantial
bonuses to induce them to extend their enlistments in critic­
ally undermanned skills.

And it is this background that these

plaintiffs arrived in our services.

They enlisted for four

years, in basic training they were told not, Justice Relinquish
and Mr. Chief Justice, that their pay wouldn’t be changed, they
were told that if they extended their enlistments they would
receive bonuses, and the bonuses were computed off their
regular r©enlistment bonuses.
QUESTION:

What is the difference between those two?

You obviously think there is one.

22

MR. KEEFFE:

Yes, sir, I do, and I think it is a

fundamental difference between us, that is to say between the
petitioners and respondents.

That difference is this, it is

that we do not say that the Congress could not change basic pay,
in your case, your illustration from $50 to $45, we concede
that.

We also say that Congress has the power to provide

specific bonuses to induce people to extend -- something else.
Basic pay, one thing? these bonuses are something else,
The Congress said — and you read the testimony that
moves the Congress to spend this kind of money, and it says we
want to concentrate retention dollars at the decision-making
point.
QUESTION:

Pay, too, is an inducement to enlist.

I

mean the pay that a person gets in the armed services at what­
ever level.

If there were no pay, he probably wouldn't enlist.

MR. KEEFFE:

That is probably true.

That's true.

However, the question is were the bonuses an inducement, a
specific promise to pay by the Congress to these persons to ex­
tend their enlistments for an additional two years.

That is

something else and we say it is something else.
QUESTION:

How is it different from an undertaking at

the outset, if it is different, on the part of the military that
if you extend we will give you a raise in salary?
MR. KEEFFE:

I suppose ‘idle difference is that if you

— there wouldn't be any difference, Mr, Chief Justice, I don't

23

if you said exactly how much you were going to give then and
when they were going to get it.

Other than that, I don’t think

there would be that much of a difference.
What we had here, however, sir, was a finding by the
court, below based upon an extensive review of the legislative
history that it was the intent of Congress to do something very
specific,

at a very specific point in time and one that could

be calculated.

And I may say that when you look at the record,

you are going to find that there will never be another VRB
case here, I don't believe, because wa are only dealing with a
peculiarity of the manner in which this was administered by the

Navy.
When you look at, for instance, Daschler v. United
States, 204 in the Court of Claims, you will see set out there
exactly what happened in the other services.

One of the prob­

lems here, as you know, is that they repealed or rather part
of the class lost the bonuses because the Navy said that their
skill was no longer critically undermanned and as a result they
no longer got the bonuses, and so they said if we don't get
the bonuses does that mean we have to serve the two years, and.
the. answer was categorically yes, yes, you have to serve the
two years.
QUESTION:

Well, that was the answer the court gave

in Orloff v. Willowby, too, wasn't it?

The plaintiff there

said he was entitled to a commission because he was a doctor

24

and he had been drafted as a doctor, and the government refused
to commissi on him and hs said, well at least let me out, and
this Court said, you know, we will not let you out and you will
not get a commission.
MR. KEEFFE:
sir.

I appreciate that that was the finding,

The only thing I can say is that when you look at the

legislative history, it would appear that the men were entitled
to their bonuses through act of Congress.

And I would also say

to you, sir, that the bonuses that they ware entitled to I
believe they ware entitled to under the Navy regulations them­
selves .
It is only when you get into this slippery intepretation that the Secretary of the Navy used, which was to say in
the first three months of your four-year extension or four-year
contract, you extend for two years, making it a four-year obli­
gation, but we don’t pay you the bonuses until you start the
first day of the fifth year.

We don't pay you the bonuses.

So these men and women all enlist or extend their enlistments
induced by these bonuses a whole two years, and then as they
approach the fifth year, the Navy says these skills are no
longer critically undermanned and therefore w@ don't give any
bonuses out.

And this has the peculiar effect, if properly

administered in a computerized world, of never having to pay
the bonuses because you. always can induce enough people pre­
sumably through your recruitments to fill the necessary need,

25

then declare it no longer critical and you don't get your bonus.
And a majority of the plaintiffs before this Court had that
happen to them.
One plaintiff in particular was denied his bonus for
another reason.

That reason was Congress in 197 4 did away with

the variable reenlistment bonuses, and when they did that the
question was raised whether or not the statute prohibited the
Navy from paying that person's bonus.

That is what ws refer to

as the Johnson class.
QUESTION:

Mr. Keeffe, suppose on the first day of

the fifth year they said we don't need these services at all,
goodby?
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:
I1R. KEEFFE:

These plaintiffs would have left.
But would they have had any claim?
No, sir, I don't believe so., because

Congress —
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:

Well, why do they have a claim now?
They have a claim now because Congress

said w© want you to serve —
QUESTION:

I thought you said Congress says you shall

get a bonus —
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
— on the first day of the fifth year?

Now, in my hypothetical, on the first day of the fifth year
they said there are two things we don't do, one is give you a

26

bonus*, and let you stay.

You admit that you wouldn’t have any

case at all?
MR. KEEFFE:

I don’t believe we would. Your Honor,

because I believe the legislative history here demonstrates
that Congress intended to pay these bonuses for people to serve
in a critically undermanned skill.
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:

But Congress changed its mind, didn't it?
Yes, sir, it did but there is no evidence

that it changed it as to VRB for these persons who had previous­
ly enlisted, extended their enlistments.

They are a different

class of persons.
QUESTION:

But why wouldn’t they be entitled to the

bonus?
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:

On the first day?
Yes.
Becuase I believe it is clear — as a

matter of fact, it is because the recruitment provisions, by
the way, that were mentioned by the petitioners.
QUESTION:

Congress —

If the serviceman died on the first day,

would his hairs have a right of action for the bonus money?
MR. KEEFFE:

I believe they would for only that

which would be due and owing than.

That is to say — they ware

spread, you see.
QUESTION:

Well, then you don’t agree that when if

they let hira go the first day, you say he wouldn't be entitled

27

to the bonu s.
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION;

I don’t think he would have -If he died the first day, his heirs would?

MR. KEEFFE;

I don't think — I think that the intent

of the Congress, Justice Marshall, was to have these persons
extend their enlistments, fill a need and serve, and the
Congress was quite critical about the services that allowed
people to extend and then let them do something else.
QUESTION:

So —

There is nothing in the record that shows

that the government made any contract, deal or anything with
him to pay him a bonus,
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

hm I right?
Nothing ~

When he signed for this extended period,

there is nothing in there that said you get a bonus, is there?
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:
MR,. KEEFFE:

Yes, there is, as a matter of fact.
Where is it?
It is in his contract.
Where is it?
The contract says that in consideration

of pay benefit and allowances to be received, and —
QUESTION:
HR. KEEFFE:

Does that say bonus?
No, sir, it doesn't.

The government

stipulates however, as they did in the court below, that pay
includes the variable r«enlistment bonus.
QUESTION:

I thought I understood Mr. Jones to say

28

there was nothing in there that promised him a bonus.
MR. KEEFFE:

Well, that is incorrect then.

We have

a ~
QUESTION:
to it then?

You said he agreed to it.

Did he agree

Has he changed his position?

MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:

Yes, I believe he has.
The government has changed its position?
Yes, it has, and it points itself up in

the Carini case in the Fourth Circuit, where Judge Haynesworth
says, .in the early part of the opinion Judge Haynesworth says
that "I find that that statement, pay benefit and allowances,
doesn't include VRB," which I believe is the point that you are
making. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

And the —

If you agree, as I understand you have, in

the stipulation that VRB is pay, is —
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

Yes; the government conceded that.
And you assert it?
Yes, I do.
Did I understand you to say before, agree­

ing again with Justice Rehnquist, that the Army can reduce your
pay during your term of enlistment?
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

Yes, I believe it can.
Well, if this is pay haven't you stipulated

yourself into- a precarious position, to put it mildly?
MR. KEEFFE:

It would appear that way perhaps on the

29

surface hnd I appreciate your calling .it to my attention.

But

I think that the answer is that this is a special kind of in­
centive pay, inducement pay.

It is a different kind of pay

than what we refer to as general pay.
QUESTION:

Well, you must depend on the contract,

mustn't you, or not?
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

On the contract?
Yes.
Yes.
At least if you are supporting the judg­

ment of the Court of Appeals, you must because the Court of
Appeals apparently went on the basis that this was part of the
consideration, namely pay.
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

Yes, but let me —
Isn't that right?
Yes, sir, but “
Would you be here if the contract had

said but. excluding VRBs?
MR. KEEFFE:

Excluding VRB?

No, I don't think I

would.
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:

So you need the contract?
I need that agreement between the

serviceman and the Navy.
QUESTION:

well, what if the Navy rag, what if the

contract said this, that the Navy regulations were very clear

30

that ths VfiBs that he would b© entitled to was part of his pay,
would ba the VRBs that ware, then in effect?

What if it were

perfectly clear that — what if it were perfectly clear against
you, would you say the regulation would be invalid?
MR. KEEFFE:

When you say perfectly clear against me,

you mean it would not give us the VRB?
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:

That's right.
And also the contract would exclude th*

language —
QUESTION:

Well, the contract says exactly what it

does now, in consideration of pay, allowances and benefits, and
then there was a regulation which made it perfectly clear that
you would not get the VRB.
MR. KEEFFE;

If the regulation said that, we wouldn't

be here.
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

You wouldn't?
No, sir.
So you say then that —
No, sir.
You say then that that regulation would be

a reasonable construction of the statute?
MR. KEEFFE:

Yes, it would, because it left -- be­

cause the statute, 3 08 (g) left to -ths Secretary of Defense who
in turn allowed the service secretaries to regulate to put —•
QUESTION:

Well, I don't understand then how you can

31

go much farther because the Secretary, in interpreting his own
regulation, has said that under the regulations you don't get
th© VRBs.
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

You have to ■—
And if that is a reasonable construction

of th© statute, what have you got left?
MR. KEEFFE:

Obviously we say it is not.

First of

all, obviously we say it is not and we so find — we so found
in the court below.

They looked at the statute — understand

me, you have first of all the contract and the contract says
pay, benefits and allowances, and the government says in the
D.C. Circuit, not in the Fourth Circuit, but in the D .C.
Circuit it says that includes VRB.

And then we look to the

question of the regulations as to the eligibility of these
people under the regulations, and we find that a reasonable
interpretation of the regulations is that they are entitled
under the Navy regulations to th© bonuses.
Nov/, if — and that is our position — if you say
that the regulations do not vest a right or do not confer an
entitlement on these plaintiffs, than you have got to match
the regulations against the intent of Congress,
QUESTION:

And then you say such a regulation would

not violate the statute?
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

Only ~
Just a minute ago you said that anyway.

32

Perhaps you would like to reconsider -that.
MR. KEEFFE:

I only reconsider it to the extent that

I would presume when you say in your hypothetical on the
regulations that these persons would not have extended in a
critically undermanned skill and had been premised their
variable reenlistment bonuses.
QUEST ION;

But do you still say that if a regulation

ware perfectly clear that they would not get the VRB, that
that would be consistent with the statute?
MR. KEEFFE;

I presume you are saying at the time

they extend, Mr. Justice White.
QUESTION:

You obviously —

No, I am saying at the time they signed

the -- at the time they agree to extend —
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

Right.
— at the time they agree to extend here,

it is perfectly clear from the regulations that they will get
only the VRBs bhat are in effect during their period of reen­
listment or extension.

The regulation is perfectly clear on

that, and they go ahead and nevertheless sign it up because
they want the special training.
MR. KEEFFE:

Then they wouldn't be entitled, it seems

to me, to the —
QUESTION:

You would say than that such a regulation

would be consistant with the statute?
MR. KEEFFE:

I believe it would, because here you

33

would have a situation where they wouIda91 be paying any of the
bonuses to these men, they wouldn’t be asking them to extend,
and I presume they wouldn’t be told that they were entitled to
those bonuses.

But it seems to me that you have a different —

having posed that problem, you have a different case here, because we find two things.

We find that they are eligible

under the statute for the bonuses and we also find that under
the regulations as found by the court below that they were en­
titled to the bonuses.

So in this instance I think you do

have a different case.
QUESTION:
the concrete example.

Mr. Keeffe, may I ask you a question with
As I understand it, the question is

whether the right attaches to the date, he signs an extension
agreement — or at the time the period begins.

Now, at the

time h© signs the extension agreement, there are ‘two variables
that may affect the amount payable to him.

One, the amount of

the regular bonus? and, secondly, the multiple.
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
All right.

You say the multiple •— now is

the bonus itself fixed as of that time or is that, subject to
change?
MR. KEEFFE:
Stavans.

No, the multiple is not varied. Justice

You have -- the only thing that you can’t compute to

a dollar-cents figure is the exact amount of the bonus in
dollars and cents because the bonus is a variable of your

34

regular r ©enlistment bonus, and your reanlistment. bonus works
off how much you are paid.

For example, these were petty

officers and they might be different rates.

There was nothing

unclear in this case about what the multiple was going to be.
They were premised a multiple of four, the highest possible
multiple available to them.
QUESTION:

But it is true that as of the date they

signed the agrement, the extension agreement, they could not
then have computed the dollars that would have been payable to
them under their theory of — under your interpretation of the
regulations because they didn't know what they would be earn­
ing four years hence?
MR. KEEFFE:

No, but they did know that whatever

their reenlistment bonus was, it was going to be a multiple of
four of that.

They knew that.

They knew it was going to be

four, because ths way the services operated was they said this
is ths most critically undermanned skill.
You are looking at the plaintiffs here who wer© per­
sons such as the men who wer© in the Pueblo in a different
period of time, highly technically trained people, very compe­
tent people, very expensively trained.
QUESTION;

Do you think there is anything in the

statute cr regulations that would have prevented the military
from changing during the four-year period the basic reenlist­
ment bonus by cutting it in half, say, saying it would be a

35

half a month's pay instead of a four month's pay?
MR. KEEFFE:

No, I do not.

I don't think so, although

I have to say that as you read the legislative history of 308 (g)
there was a very definite effort to fix a certain amount of
money at a decision point, and that obviously would reduce it,
of course, because your multiple would be going off half of
what it was.
QUESTION:

The problem I see is that you are claiming

a fixed right — the bonus would be four times X.
MR. KEEFFE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And you are saying there is a fixed right

to four, but the government could change the X, and as soon as
you admit that it seems to me you may be admitting they could
make X aero.
MR. KEEFFE:

It would appear that we would go that

far, it would appear that you could do that, because obviously
the reenlistment boms, the regular reenlistment bonus was a
multiple off your regular pay, and the logic of it would appear
to go that far.

The only thing I can say in answer to that is

that the Congress of the United States had in mind, as we view
it and as I have stated here this morning, an intent to give a
specific amount of money to induce people to extend.

Now, that

certainly would frustrate that and w© then would be back in the
position of having to decide when the extensions went into
effect.

And if you follow the opinion below, and as we suggest,

36

the tint® that you have decided what these men ax© going to get
and the multiple thereof is at the time that they extend, aid
it would seem to me that you would have to compute the bonuses
at that time off of what their basic pay was then, in order to
effectuate a congressional purpose.
QUESTION:

Does the record tell us what — during the*

period that they war© actually paid, 1 take it they were four
times whatever the pay was at the time they entered into the
fifth year?
MR. KEEFFE:

Yes.

of course, none of these plaintiffs

ware
QUESTION:

I know, these people didn6t get it, but

•there was a practice of paying the bonus ~~
MR. KEEFFE:

Yes, there was a practike of paying the

multiple of four, yes.
QUESTION:
MR. KEEFFE:

Four times the salary at the time —
Y©s, although we don’t know how many of

them for sure, because, as I say, the way ths logic ©f the
matter now stands, with sophisticated computers you might not
have been able to pay anybody anything.

You sea, if you fill a

critical man skill and then go on — now, I may dwell on two
other points.
There ar@ two opposing casas her®, the one in the
Fourth Circuit and ths other in tha Ninth Circuit.

And as I

started to say, on the Fourth Circuit case, in Car ini, Judge

a

37

Haynesworth says, in a way that I do not understand, he said
that the pay benefit and allowances didn’t include the variable
r©enlistment boms and h@ couldn't se© it there and therefore
that was evidence of the fact that they weren't promised the
variable reenlistmeat boms.
And in th® D.G. Circuit the government had certified
in the brief, it conceded that pay included th® variable reen­
listment bonus.

So either that was in error or els® they

changed their position thsre, I don't know which,

,

In th® other case that is -— th® other circuit case,
is Judg® Snaed's opinion in the Ninth Circuit, and that has to
do with only on© group of the plaintiffs, it has to do with Mr.
Johnson, who was denied, his boms because of a change in the
statute, that is to say that th®

vrb

was eliminated.

And there

Judge, Snead says that there is no evidence in the statute itself
that would indicate that th©r® was any basis fcr preserving VRB
for Mr. Johnson.

So in addition to losing his bonus under th©

regulations, th© change in th© regulations, it also is alleged
that he losss it under a repeal of the 3 08 (g), where the put in
a new boms provision.
Now,

V/&

have looked at th© legislative history and her®

again w® say we don't see any support for that.

Judge Sneed

states it, but if you review it as wa hava, I don't se® any
support for that position.
Secondly, if that is so, we still look to an operation

38
of the bonus, wa give you an example in the brief itself where
wa say we think they would be eligible,, Johnson would be
eligible under the currant statute because although

vrb

was

eliminated, we don’t sea any basis for denying it to Johnson am
w© think that th© way the statute operates the multiple affects
Johnson in a way where h© can get his bonuses.

In particular,

wa cited an illustration there to cover that.
In addition to that, wa also say that if there was
that intent, than we are thrust into th© question that the
Court of Appeals below saw, and that is United States v. Lynch,
where it appears clearly the reason for repealing th© variable
reenlistment bonuses, which were only in effect from '65 to '74,
right in that period of th® war, that if that was th© case,
Congress was exercising its fiscal responsibility and to that
extent they are impairing th® men’s contract.
v® have to get to that position.

But I don't think

I think Johnson is qualified

because of his extension agreement and the agreement of Congress
to pay him at .the time hs mad® that decision.

If not,. I think

that he still is eligible under th© statute as it is amended.
And, lastly, if that isn’t th© case, than it appears we have to
look to th© question of the conflict of th© statute and Lynch
v. United States.
In th® few moments I hav© left, I would like to dwell

on —* I haven't touched really on th® equit is s hair®, which I am
sur® the court appreciates, as all the courts below hav®, ar©

39
very much on oar sid®.

Our psopi© ar© peopl© who were induced

to extend aM did sarv©, and they deserve a just consideration .
I also think it was intended that they should do so
and that Congress intended to pay then.

It is a large group,

but I do think that the equities are very much on their sid®.
I would also say that I think that w© concede — we
do concede that basic pay could ba changed.

We think that the

legislative history of 308 (g) indicates that Congress intended
a specific amount of money b© paid to these men, and for that
■the men and women served.
Are there any other questions?
QUESTION:

I have on© other question.

Is there any­

thing in the history of this statute to indicate that the
multiples were ever increased?

Increased?
In other words, say a man signs an extension

went to four, as I understand the government's verion, h® would
than to© entitled to four at the time of — at the time he
signed up he was only offered two.
MR. KEEFFE:

Yes, that’s right and, of course, that

would frustrate the intent of Congress the. way the operated be­
cause, of course, Congress did not want them to spread th©
bonus all over.

They

wanted them t© fix what was necessary to

fill a critical need, and that, is th© logic that the government

40
proceeds on.
QUESTIONS

My question is do you know if that ever

happened, do wo have any history of whether the government in
fact administered it that way?
MR. KEEFFE:

We don't in this case, Year Honor, because

we moved quickly through summary judgment, so I can't say that
it is here, but it may be in the related cases, particularly in
Sailors v. United States, which is a consolidated case in the
Ninth Circuit.

The difference -Tha answer, you said because they cut his

I thought that is

what you said.
MR. KEEFFE:

I believe that is correct.

Try the facts

am doing one job and I am fully qualified to do it, and you say
to me, "I will pay you twice your basic pay to do this other

that there the government would be required to pay you the

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything further,

Mr. Jones?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. JONES:

Yes.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Justice Marshall asked about the governmentSs po­
sition as to whether pay includes bonuses, and then tiara was a
colloquy which suggested that the government had changed its
position.

The government has not changed its position.

All we

ever stipulated was that the term "pay" includes bonuses, but
what the agreement states is that it is in consideration of the
pay that will accrue.

Now, our position has been that the

bonuses were a form ©f pay that simply never accrued as to these;
enlisted m@n.
QUESTION:

I just want to make clear.

If we disagreed

with you asset held or thought that the government really did
pronis® these VRBs, contrary to your position, you are not rely­
ing on any — yon would lose then, I tak® it — you ar© not
relying on any power of congress to reduce whatever it was they
promised?
MR. JONES:

No, we have not dons so, Mr. Justice White.

Most of the respondents entered into their extension periods

44

before Congress acted.
Mr. Justice white, I hav© given a little further
thought, perhaps not enough, to your question about the appro­
priate disposition if the Court agrees with our basic position
as to what th© regulations provide.

I would concede that th®

better view probably is that the petitioners did not hav® to
protect their position by cross-petitioning.
I would submit that, as a matter of law, if they are
not entitled ho a money judgment, they are not entitled to any
form of equitable relief under —

mission would b© in the ahsane© of a monay judgment under the
Tucker Act, there is no relief available.

QUESTION;.- Thar© is no basis for rescission.
MR. JONES;
QUESTION;

That is correct, yes.
X have two questions, if I may ask you.

First, is thsra anything in the history of the other case
that we could properly know about with respect to an increase in
th© award level which th© gov@ramsnb did in fabt pay which would
tend to confirm your viewpoint?
MR. JONES;

My answer to that, Mr.-Justice Stevens, is

45
yes and no.

At pag® 105 of th© appendix there is a schedule

of award levels which indicates that sont© award levels de­
creased, scsa© increased, some stayed th© same over a period of
several years.

However, there is nothing in this record that

establishes what the Navy's treatment was, but it is my under•:i

standing that th® Navy has consistently administered the regula­
tion so that when th© award level went up th© man was entitled
to th® larger bonus; when it went down, h© was entitled to th©
smaller boms.

This cas© —

QUESTION;

Excuse ma.

What do you understand, th©

Court of Appeals to have disagreed with th© Secretary’s inter­

MR. JONES;
QUESTION:

Well, I think it was a very —
Was it based at all on the legislative his­

tory?

MR. JONES;

That is not — I think th© court's allu­

sions to th© legislative history were based upon statements that:
war© mad© with respect to reenlistments and not with respect to
<sxtensions of enlistments.

There was language in the legislative

history which indicated that the boms would become available at
th© decision point.

That was th® decision point of 2:©enlistment.,

which was at the end of tha original enlistment period.

There

is no indication in th© legislative history that these Congress­
men ever considered th© application of th© program to extensions!
of enlistment, which presented a very different, kiss?, of problem..

QUESTI OH:

Mr» Jones, to add a second question I

wanted to ask you, would you agree that if your opponent is
correct and if th© right vested at the time the extension agree­
ment is signed, it would be more or less analogous to say earned
compensation for a month of service, on that hypothesis the
example that Mr. Justice Rehnquist gave of changing the level of
pay would really not be appropriate because that would h© — you
wouldn't say that tbs government could change the level of pay
for October sometime in November?
MR, JONES:

Again, Mr. Justice Stevens, yes and no.

Mr. Chiaf Justic© asked m© a similar question during my opening
argument, and I said that the sam® line of ana lysis could b®
argued to suggest that the level of pay upon original enlistment
was fixed in th© same way that the respondents argue that their
bonus was fixed.

Now, if the Court accepted that argument, then,

the same consequences v?ould flow, that is there might b© a con­
stitutional barrier to reduction.

New, that is th© first half cf

the answer,
Th© second half is that th^y are talking about, vesting
in a p@cul.iar- sens©.

They are not. saying that thay would b© en­

titled to the bonus if they never served their extension periods,
that is they are not really talking about th© vesting of pay for
services already done.

What -they are saying is that they had a

vested contract right for a quid pro quo one® thsy performed th®.
service, so it is a little different from pay for servie® that

has already been dona, but it la analogous.
QUESTION:

And you would not rely on th© analogy of

the military cutting of pay?
MR. JONES:

Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, w@ would argue

that just as the Congress can reduce pay# th© Congrass or ths
Navy under delegated responsibility can reduce the award level.
QUESTION:

Yes, if that is a fair reading of th©

regulations?
MR. JONES:

That's correct.

Thank you.
