MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ur. Randolph, after

reviewing these briefs and seeing some of the developments
that have come in those briefs, it occurs to us that perhaps
you and Mr. Lord, who have the lion's share of the two
.

hours that we’ve allocated, may not need all that time.

And

of course you know there’s no compulsion to use it just
because it’s been allocated.

We'll leave that up to your

good judgement.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR., ERO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PARTIES
MR. RANDOLPH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Court:
These cases are here on writs of certiorari to
tha United States Court of Appeals for the 4th, 9th and
District of Columbia Circuits.

At issue are the Clean Air

Act Amendments of 1970 and. regulations promulgated by EPA
requiring the respondents to take certain actions to control
motor vehicle air pollution.
Two of the Courts below, the 9th and 4th circuits,
decided the case on statutory grounds, calling era’s
regulations invalid insofar as they required states to comply
with them.

The District of Columbia’s circuit’s decision is

more difficult to summarise.

Basically, it agreed with EPA

that the state, as owner of the pollution source, the highways,

several of these pollutants react in complex ways producing
photochemical exidants„ or what is commonly called smog.
The result is thousands of deaths yearly, millions
of days of illness, and billions of dollars in health cost
and property damage throughout, the United States.
One more fact —* and I think this is very important

to our case: air pollution travels.

place.

It moves.

It doesn't

It doesn't stay located in one

The Court may have seen an article, X don't know the

truth of it but it illustrates my point, in last month's
Mew York Times where it was reported that the vineyards in
Western lew York were being destroyed by air pollution from
automobiles in Gary, Indiana,
illustration.

I think that’s a vivid

It’s possible; whether it’s true or not I

don’t know.
One other fact: in Section 101 of the Act that's
in issue here Congress found that the predominant part of
the nation's population — this was the verv first finding
in the Act — is located in the rapidly expanding metro­
politan areas of the country, which generally cross state
borders or are very near state borders.
how T don't think I exaggerate — before T talk
about the Act — to say that when Congress legislated in
the Clean. Air Act, it was doing so, it was acting, for

manv of the very reasons that the founders net in Phila­
delphia in 1797 and established the Constitution of the
United States.

Let me'be explicit.

One of the framers' main objectives was to keep
a national system of government wherebv one state could not
pursue its own selfish interests to the injurv and detriment
of its sister states and the citizens of the sister states.
I think you all recall, one of the most famous
statements about why the constitution met was made bv
Madison.

He likened Mew Jersey, sitting between Philadelphia

and New York, as a keg tapped at both ends.

or North

Carolina sittincr between South Carolina and. Virginia as
a patient bleeding from both arms.
My point is that in arguing here against national
action because of compulsion on the state, the respondents
have to confront the Congress clause at its verv core.
air is a national resource.

Air pollution travels.

rnhe

And

as l hope to demonstrate in this argument, it is no mart
of our federalism thatthe health, the welfare and the
property of the citizens of one state have to suffer because
surrounding states refuse to take action to combat air
pollution stemming from the use of their highways.
Mow, in the Clean Air Act amendments of 17*7^
Congress recognized that control of air Pollution was the
primary responsibility of the states.

But strong national

action was demanded.

Previous efforts — federal efforts —

to combat the mounting crisis had failed,

The history is

recounted in the Court’s opinion in NPJ1C v. wraiq, —- or
Train v. jTRDC.
Suffice it to sav here that despite offers of
technical and financial assistance to the states, the
states have made little progress in meeting their responsibility.
The 1970 amendments — I can describe then quickly.
The Court had two cases last term dealing with the Clean
Air Act, and I’ll be rather brief in this description.

In

the 1070 amendments the EPA administrator Was required to
set air quality standards at a level that protects against
the adverse

effects on health and welfare.

Section 11o of the Act set forth the process for
establishing stato programs to achieve and maintain these
air quality standards.
Now exactly how air pollution was to bo controlled
within a state was left initially to the stato itself.

The

state was to submit a plan to RPA which T5PA was reouired
to accept if the plan met the broad outlines set forth in
Section 119 of the Act.
Now two of those requirements set forth in 11ft
are that the state plan contain, where necessary, trans­
portation controls and an inspection and maintenance
program

7
If the state plan was deficient, T?PA would issue
a substitute, at least for those parts of the state plan
that were def icient *
Although the state plans were due bv January of
1972 , TfPA crave an' extension to all the states where
transportation controls would be required to meet ambient
air quality standards.

It did this because HPA realized,

just lilce everyone else did, that we had very little
experience with transportation controls.

As a matter of

fact, that was why we had a problem.
However, a federal Court of Appeals sittino in
the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Act did
not permit this delav, and ordered that the extension of
time be rescinded, and CPA complied.
By late 1971 the process of formulating state clans
had been completed,

some of CPA's final regulations —

which in nanv instances, I might add, reflected state
choices? and by that T mean, reflected the choices of the
states when they submitted proposals or proposed plans —
imposed duties on the states with respect to state owned
highways, and required the establishment of an emissions
inspection and maintenance program for vehicles registered
by the state„
Mow respondent's statutory argument in this case
is that the amendments

the 19?n amendments

do not

8

act to reduce motor vatic3e

In other words, to nut it bluntly, a state

can never be in violation of an implementation plan

signed

to meet air Duality standards.

MR. RANDOLPH:

By that,

they don’t.
MR. RANDOLPH:

A state can be a violator, and T

would say the respondents admit he can.
The cuestion then is, is whether a state, hv owning
the highways, can be a source of pollution — an owner of
a source of pollution —- which has to comply, like anyone
else, with'the Clean Air Act’s requirements.

Certainlv it' the state owns a municipal incinerator,
it's clear that it's a source of pollution, and it has to
comply.
I think that is their position.

And the

era's

position, I think, is clearly set out in our brief.
think it's fundamental to our argument.

And I

The ET>\ administrator

determined early on, before anv constitutional issue was
raised --- this was purely a matter of dealing with statutes.
Given the legislative history it's a judgement bv the
administrator, and I don't think it's ooen to reasonable
doubt that the states, bv owning a highwav, own a pollution
source, and can be recruired to take action just like a
private source owner can.
onr-priON:

But you've gone over that orettv gnicklv

by saying that thev own the pollution sources.

Well, the

source of the pollution isn’t the highway really, is it?
It’s the automobile.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, I agree that without automobiles

we would not have air pollution.

Without people driving

their automobiles about, we would not have air pollution.
Without a highway we would not have air pollution.

On your theory the ownership or the

control of — as exists in some places — of the airports

The federal government should

requires that result.
T-7e think it's quite a simple proposition involved
here as far as the E^Ads determination.

Is it unreasonable,

as the Administrator found, that when a property owner
i nvites others to engage in certain activities on the
property, the owner can be held responsible for the harm
caused by those activities'?

That is t,he Trr>.Ads Administrator’

decision.
The property owner in this case haooens to be the
state.

The property is the highway.

The person using them,

the invitees or licensees, are the citizens.
Further — and as 'hr. Justice Stewart said, we
believe the highways are quite analogous to the sewer systems

^he truest ion here is whether Congress has authorised

the Administrator to require the states to enforce his
plan.

'To one questions the Administrator can promulgate

his own plan and enforce,it, if he.finds the states’ plan
is not adequate.

The question is whether he can force the

states to enforce it.
MR. ’RANDOLPH:

accept that, construction of the Act.

It's not the Admini­

strator forcing the states to enforce his plan.
that's like saying

I mean

what it is is forcing the states to

QUESTION:

fell, to provide all of the inspectors

and police and so forth to carry out his nlan, rather than
having the federal government provide those people in
implementation of the federal plan, isn't it?
NR. RANDOLPH:
yes.

Nell, that is the choice, X suppose,

It may be something different than that, it mav be

requiring the state to do this or not having it done at
all,

depending on what the practical difficulties are of

having, for example, a federal highway control on the
nations highways.
OTTFSTim•

Well, during the second World War we

managed to have OPA federal officials in every hamlet?
during those various times we've been at war we've had

13
draft boards which were — you know, thasalutation was, you've
been chosen by a board consisting of your friends and
neighbors.

And that's who they were.
MR. RATTDOLPTT:

Well, X think we pointed out in

our reply brief that the draft — I think is far afield now,
but

we used it

for another point,* tha draft in World War 71

was done by requiring state officials to register the neonle.
And the question here is not — I don't think
the question here is really, which is the best svstem,
having federal highway controls for the first tine in the
country’s history, having federal inspection of maintenance.
The cmostion here is whether the states have a responsibility
here to do this by themselves.
OIJESTIO'T:

well, the question is whether Congress

has authorised what the ERA Administrator has done.
MR. RANDOLPH:

That’s one guestion.

And — the

first question in the case, I agree.
Mow, the only response —* I've developed what
the ERA Administrator determined.
our brief the legislative history.

We've set forth in
We set forth in our

brief the various statements that were made on the floor of
Congress.
The only response, T think — I think it's fair
to say that respondents make is that they seek to answer
our argument by misstating it.

They argue that Congress

14

could never have in tended this,, because rPA's position
known no rational hounds»

One nicrht as well say that

pollution from the factoryresulfcs from state action through,
for example, zoning decisions»

X think that's the example

that they give at, if I’m not mistaken, page 44 of their
brief.
hut that ignores the fact that the factory unlike
the highway sits on private land.

And if there is one thread

running through the entire Clean Air Act, it is that the
owner of a source of pollution is responsible, can be made
responsible, for controlling the pollution.
ottt’BTTOM

;

It's •—

If vou carry that to its logical

conclusion, most of the highways in this country are resting
on easements with a diversionary right to the fee owner;
isn't that so?

f?o that if you're talking about the ultimate

fee owner, you're talking about the owner of the adjoining
land.
MR. RAppoLPTT;
Justice.

T don't think that's so, Mr. Chief

At least T — that the highways of the country

are resting on easements.

I think the highway is taken

by eminent domain.
*11 fi

OTTPHTIOM;

mhe states said that it reverts back to the

fee owner of the underlying lew".
MR. RAUPOTjPPs

,

Wen that may be.

But the fact is

that the states are the ones that, have that highway,

^he

States, like a private nvmer, are the ones that are allowing
people to come on it and use it for a certain purpose.

And

as a result of that, pollution is generated.
It would he no different, for example, if the
state owned a facility in the municipal incinerator, let’s
suppose; but the state never onerated it; and invited a
private contractor to come on and run the municipal incinerator,
We think that the state in that situation could be
regulated and required to control that private contractor,
just like if the private contractor had beesi operating on
his own property with his own factory spewing resources into
the air, pollution into the air.
Now, they make another point in this regard with
which we agree,

Thav say the states are forced to comply

with federal law because they havenot exercised their
police power.

1 think that’s accurate,

hut all that means

is that we would not have federal legislation under the
Clean Air Act if the states had controlled air pollution.
It can’t mean anything more than that, because, to use the
example that we1ve been talking about, if a state incinerator
is poisoning the atmosphere, it’s because the state hasn't
exercised its colice power in the way the Congress wanted
the state to o»o it.
Yet respondents admit that such facilities must
comply with federal pollution standards •— air pollution

standards,
Now this brings me to the point, T think, unless
the Court has further questions in regard — T probably
should mention one thing which is not mentioned in our
brief as far as the statutory point is concerned.

And

I informed respondent’s counsel of the fact that I may
mention this.
I think the appearance and the impression the Court
may have is this whole idea of requiring states to comply
under federal law is something that was never talked about
very much during the hearings»

And it's not accurate,

'""he

reason why we don't find great debates about that -- and
I might remind the Court, the Clean Air Act passed the Senate
73 to nothing; it passed the House, I think, 347 to 1.

The

reason one doesn’t find great debates about that, and
I think it’s fair to say, is that the Court examines the
hearings, the legislative procedure —• what you'll find
is that they're filled with statements from cities
and states and

governors saying, we need this legislation.

We need tough legislation.

We need demanding legislation.

We need to be required to do these things.
The fact is, there wasn't any —- very much
opposition.

.As a matter of fact, the only onposition I

found from a state representative — and I have to give
California credit for consistency — is a statement of

.

17
Governor Reagan's on page 1300 of the Renate hearings,
where he objected to — as he out it — reserving for
state and local governments the task and cost of implementing
decisions of the federal government under threat of findes
and punishment if the job is not done to the satisfaction
of then-Secretary of HEW but now EPA Administrator.
Governor Reagan, I might add,

added later on in

his testimony that yes, I do think however that interstate
air pollution regions would benefit from federal overview
to resolve disputes and to prevent inaction in one state
imposing pollution problems on a people of a neighboring
state.

This is page 1301 of his testimony.
We have 17 states in which — end the District

of Columbia, in which pollution/transportation controls
have been required.

I've counted up the cities which are

either right on the border of a state or within a hundred
miles of the border of another state, and the number T
get is somewhere between 73 and R*5 per cent of

all the

cities where the controls we1 re talking about here are
required are of that category, either right on the border of
another state, or within at least inn miles of another state,,
Mow, I don't want to give the impression that Governor
Reagan would be -— was the onlv governor that talked anainst
this.

Hut I might add this: the Douglas and Head — and this

again is not cited in our brief —- it was the state —■ the

18
Attorney General of the Ptate of Minnesota, testified on
behalf of the National Associations of Attorneys General,
and stated at page 1183 of the Senate hearings that if a
state like my own state of

.Minnesota has not adopted the

Motor- Vehicle Inspection Law, and they still have not —
he was saying what kind of legislation he wanted — we would
still be pretty much compelled to install an inspection
program for emission control devices.

And without dragalng

this out too much further, the National Governors'
Conference, represented by Governor Sargent of Massachusetts,
from page 449 of the Senate hearings to page 4si, testified
in favor of the legislation.

And I think Governor Sarerent,

on behalf of the national Governors' Conference, said at the
end of his testimony, I think the states can't just shrug
t heir shoulders and say, well, let the federal government
do it.
I submit to the Court that that is the position of
the respondents in this case.
As far

as the statute is concerned, I think we

rest on solid grounds.

And in fact, the courts — the 1st

Circuit and the 9th Circuit — said that they ware construing
the statute only because of constitutional doubts that they
had.
Now, let me address those constitutional doubts.
QUECTIOTT:

Let me, before vou leave the statute —*.

19

Let’s take the simple ease of the municipally
operated incinerator, which everybody agrees in this case
is subject

to the statute.

And so the administrator

establishes criteria for standards for ambient air, both
primary and secondary pollution.

And the state comes in

with a plan that is found by the Administrator to be deficient
insofar as it regulates municipally owned and operated
incinerators in the state.
Is it all that clear under the statute that the
Administrator can then say to the state, your problem is
that you don't have stringent enough laws, or ordinances.
And so you go enact those, controlling municipally operated
incinerators.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, there’s been a lot of

confusion about that, and maybe I can clear it

up.

First of all, the Administrator's position in
this case before all the Courts of Appeals, has not been:
we can force states to make laws.
QUESTION:

Well, I think it's clear despite the

disclaimers that there has been some change of position
by the government in these — _
MR. RANDOLPH:

well,

think — T bea to differ

with you, but we won’t get any pigee apguing’about»that.
OTTECWTON:

QUESTION:

No, we're not talking about fcr sanctions

here is that what

Yes.

But what's — the problem

has happened is that regulations that

the — the EPA Administrator, in imposing these controls,
walked in on cat feet.

He didn't charge in like a buffalo

trying to knock the states down, which is the impression, I think,
that one gets

maybe,from reading the briefs in this case.

And we’re as responsible for that as anyone else.
What he did is, first of all, he tried to give an
extension of time which,

I think, was cut back bv a court

and told, no, you can’t give an extension.

And then, when

he was forced to impose controls, he tried to give the
states as much leeway as possible.

I mean he could have

gone and put in his regulations details down to — that
far, and said: you do it this way, and this is precisely the
way you have to do it.
Instead, he tried to be moderate.

He tried to —

in imposing something on the state, tried to give the state
leeway.

The states had come to him and said, look, we're
*

going to get legislation to direct.

So, you know, we're

going to have this passed in the House, we're going to have
this.

And the EPA Administrator said, okay, fine»

T<7hcn

you get the legislation, please submit it to me—"please"
wasn't there, X admit—submit it to me, and then you'll
be in compliance.
It’s the same with regulations.

That's the history behind that, Mr. Justice
Stewart.

position on the one hand of being told that under the law

the case was remanded, you remember, to the Administrator.

I think the conseguence of complying, for example, with the

the expenditure of money.

T‘7el3., is EPA' s argument here 3 imitet

to the contention that — is it in effect conceding that
the Administrator himself has to fill in all the details of
a federal plan after a state plan has been rejected either in
whole or in part?
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes ,

And that vou're simply dealing with

the state in its essentially proprietary capacity?

The

thing I thought was still an issue was that the Administrator
said,

in filling those details, he could sav, state, you hire

10,000 people to carry out the details of this nian.

Administrator has a right to promulgate.

Hell, how about as a statutory — I

We’re still at that level,

MR. RANDOLPH:

Does the statute authorize it?

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.

Number one, the state has to have an
Tf the state doesn't have an Implementa­

tion plan, the EPA is to substitute an implementation plan­
ter the state.

Under that implementation plan, any source -—

owner of a source of pollution can be required to abate the
pollution.

The EPA * s argument in this case, which I said

is fundamental to the case, is that the state is an owner

n
of a source of pollution, and therefore can he required to
abate that pollution just as if the steel industry was
required to hire 10,000 people in order to abate the pollution
that thev caused.

Tie treat then no differently.

That's the extent ofthe argument here.
there's nothing under the statute,
defines the state as a person,

And

Tf the state can be required

to clean up the pollution as a result of this municipal
incinerator, it can be required to clean up the pollution
as a result of the air pollution from the highways or from
the sewer system.

As a matter of fact, the distance between

sewer systems and highways I don't think is a very large
distance.

The sewer systems are to the water what the

highways are to the air: it both collects pollution: the
pollution comes from private sources? and vet the state
owns both.

So we think the state is responsible for both.
And it's not iust us.

I think the Court has so

held.

t think the Sanitary District case stands for that:

I think the City of Milwaukee v. Illinois stands for that —
as a matter, it's even clearer bacau.se the Court held there
that even in the absence of federal lav? the Court was going
to create federal 1aw to govern just that kind of pollution.
And it indicated — in dictum, I agree — that it would do
the same in regard to the ambient air.

If you mean that —* the alternative for the federal
government in this case is to offer the state a grant-in-aid

And if they accept it and

then fail to live up to the conditions, cut off the money,
I have two responses to that.

Number one, that was

what the history of that Act was before this.

But the states

failed to take the money, and the pollution went: unabated.
Number two, the law is that that puts the state
in the position of a foreign country,

Maryland, despite their proximity to Washington, to build
a billion dollars worth of new highways.

But if, for example, every incinerator

QUESTION:
Randolph,

Well, again, let me slow you down, Mr.

because 1 do want to understand your argument.
This Section, as I understand, deals with the

duty of a state as a regulator, not with the duty of a
state as an owner of highways.
MR. RANDOLPH:

It deals with —* well, this section

governmental agency, not about what it must do because it*3
an owner of property which may pollute the atmosphere.
What talks about its duty as an owner of property that may
pollute the atmosphere?

And that's what your whole theory

is, if I understand you.
MR. RANDOLPH;

The entire section 110 s- eaks to

the state in both capacities.

And it must, because if it

does not, then a state would foe under no obligation in an

To regulate itself.

It must foe

One ten must mean that, and the

reason it must is, because, number one ~~ and the states
admit this —■ if they have a municipal incinerator, they
have to comply.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand that.

But what

is there in this section that teaches anything about the
owner of a highway being a polluter?

I think Mr. Justice

Marshall and T are concerned about the absence of anything
in the statute to suggest that
the state a polluter.

that kind of activity makes

Within the meaning of the statute.

MR. RANDOLPH:

You cannot read — I would readily

admit, you cannot read section (a) to get to that conclusion,
like you cannot read a lot of other statutes.

You have

to look at the -QUESTION:

Se ction (a) doesn’t say to the in­

cinerator owner, either -MR. RANDOLPH:

It does not.

It does say that

transportation controls have to be put on, and that's on
page 6(a), Mr. Justice Stevens.

43
QUESTION:

Well, I can understand, the state as a

regulator would control the transportation that takes place
on its highways*

That's easy.

But does that mean that in

its capacity as an owner of the highway it has a different
duty than as a regulator?
MR. RANDOLPH:
supports that.

Yes.

We think the legislative history

We think — if you read the statute any other

way, then what you wind up with is a statute that makes no
sense with regard to municipal incinerators.

If you say 110

doesn't mean the state can be enforcing something against
itself, then I don't know what you do with the respondent's
concession in this case.

It must

power to have the emission standards for each particular
automobile as a condition for getting a license to drive the
car?

MR. RANDOLPH:

That would be a very broad claim

OUFKTION:

Broader than the

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.

'one you're making?

The reason is? because we

would then have to say, and we don't say, that simply because
the State has the power to regulate a certain activity,
therefore the EPA Administrator can require the state to
regulate that activity.

That would mean the EPA Administrator

could recruire them to control private smelters.

It could

require them to control anything.
QUESTION:

You said before --- you said before —

I thought,in response to the question I put — the federal -—
the EPA could close the highways within the state.

Isn't

that a — isn't that a bolder claim than the claim that they
should exercise their licensing power in a particular way?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Me are not — we have never imposed

any such requirements, Mr. Chief Justice.

T-Te say that the

state can be required to close down a source of pollution that
it owns, if that's absolutely necessary for compliance.

In

fact, what you mean by closing down the highways, is probably
the people use other means of transportation, for example.
I don't know whether — maybe block them off, or something.
But we've never made that kind of claim here.

Controls had to be imposed.

The primary responsibilities

of the states had to be met.
And I think the Court said , in NRDC v. Train ,
that the innovation of the statute was that under the Act
that a state had no choice but to meet that responsibility.
Are they responsible for the pollution coming from the
highways?

We think they are.
Now, I'd like to say at least a word about National

League of Cities.

We don't believe the federal laws cross

the line marked out by the Court in that case, and there is
one difference between this case and National League of Cities
that I think is immediately apparent.

Unlike National

League of Cities, the activity here is not one that — to
use the words of that decision — is essential to the separate
and independent existence of the states.
And what is more, the respondents admit it's not.
And I’ll tell the Court why.

They say that if the operation

of their transportation system have to be modified to
reduce air pollution, the federal government should do it.
I submit that's an admission that the activity that we’re
talking about is not one that's essential to the states.
Why not?
to do it.

Because they say, well, we want the federal government
If it were essential to their continued existence,

they would be making no such claim.

There was no such

claim made In the National League of Cities case by the
states, that the federal government should come in and
control their employees.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Me are unanimous on one thing, clean

So let's focus on the statute.
MR. HAWKINS:

Very good.

Now, the citizen groups intervened in the court
below in the District of Columbia circuit in support of DPA
because of their view, which we're glad to hear the Court
shares, that the statute promotes — for clean air and that
the EPA regulations are the only practical wav of achieving
that important objective.
So to the statutory question: is it reasonable
to regard a highway as a source of pollution?

And Mr.

Justice Stevens put it well in asking, what is the specific
statutory authority?

What is it that talks about the

state's duty as a polluter of the atmosphere?
Well, it is the same section that talks about any
source's duty, and that is the section which, empowers EPA
to promulgate regulations in the event that a state does
not submit an adequate plan.
of the Act.

That Section is Section 110 (c)

It is set forth at EPA's brief at page ha.

What it says is that the Administrator shall set forth —
promotiy prepare and publish proposed regulations setting

forth an implementation plan»

how, that implementation plan

must contain emission limitations which, although it doesn't
say so in Section 110 (a), are applicable to pollution
sources.
The question then is, is it reasonable to regard a
highway as a. pollution source?

I think the difficulty

that many people have had is that the highway is owned by
the state, and as such, it is difficult to perceive it as a
pollution source.

So let's look at some similar types of

sources which are owned by private parties.
For example, let us take a garage which performs
tuneups on automobiles.

Those automobiles are owned by the

individuals that brine those cars in.

However, the id liner

emissions may be substantial, especially for very large
garages.
Similarly, a private garage which perhaps stores
buses, or is a bus terminal.
party.

The buses are owned by another

But the garage itself nay collect emissions, concen­

trate emissions, and allow the problem to be created.
This is what a highway does in that it determines
the location of motor vehicle activity.

Tt concentrates

that motor vehicle activity to a degree where the problem
is created.

Mr. Justice Marshall, there’s one

exception, and that is, the bus lane on Shirley Highway
which moves very well.

And that's what we're aiming at.

Let's look at some others.

Is a shopping center,

where people circulate, idling their cars for hours on
ends trying to find a parking space during a pre-holiday
sale, is that a source of pollution?

Or is it fair for the

shopping center operator to insist that anv community that
adjoins the shopping center must go

after the individual

vehicles that circulate and are collected and are attracted
to that shopping center?
QUESTION:

Do you suggest that the FPA could order

the owner of the shopping center to establish an inspection
system on all vehicles coming into the shopping center, and
check them for air pollution?
MR. HAWKINS:

We believe there are precedents

which would establish just that type of responsibility,
and I!d like to turn to some of those.

[Whereupon, the Court was recessed until 1:00

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ur. Hawkins, T think

you have a few minutes left.
UR. HAWKTHS:

Thank vou, Mr. Chief Justice.

In the remaining moments I'd like to make iust
two points.
First, it is loaieal to regard highways as sources
of air pollution: and second, Congress intended that thev
be regarded as highways — as sources of air pollution.
I'd like to touch on the second point first,
Congressional intent.

I want to call the Justices attention

to the fact that in 1°74, after EPA Promulgated the mutilations
here in issue, Congress considered amendments to the clean
Mr Act in a comprehensive enercrv bill,

«"hose amendments

were passed in June of ln7A, and one pertinent amendment is
in the government’s brief at page 1.2 .A.

Tt amended Section

EPA's authority to •promulgate the very tvoes of recrulations

hare in issue, name, bus lanes.
Large paragraph (F!) on nacre 3hA specifies that,
basically, no retaliation relating to management of narking
supply or preferential bus/carpool lanes shall be promulgated
after the date of enactment of this paragraph, unless there
are locally conducted public hearings.
So Congress addressed, this issue.

Tt’s only concern

about bus lanes mas not that it mas irrational to regard the
highway as a source, but simo.1v that there hadn't been ade­
quate public participation in some of the bus lanes that had
been promulgated up to that point.
However, Congress didn't even recruire that those
bus lanes regulations be rescinded.

Instead, in the

conference reoort — as is pointed out in the government’s
brief at page IS — the conference report specifically
endorsed the existing bus lane regulations, and simply renuired
a procedural safeguard, for future bus lane regulations.
OTTPP^IOP:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL S. HOSHOT-ri;™?:, ESO.,
0*7 REUALF OF CALIFORNIA REn'ImTOM^RS.
MR. MOSKOI7TT7, r

Mr. Chief Justice, and na-v it

please the Court:
The Solicitor General has attempted to nersuade
this Court that the Administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency has both statutory and constitutional
authority to predetermine and control state transportation
policies.
Mow, to prevail in this case he’s going to have to

fi 2

persuade the Court of the correctness of his position on
both these issues.
I’m goincr to address myself to the statutorv issues,
and my colleague, Mr. Lord of Maryland, will discuss the
constitutional issues.
The environmental Protection Agency, in its latest
position which it takes before this Court, now seems to
recognize that it may only regulate polluters.

And to

justify its attempt to regulate state policies and activates
it characterizes the states as polluters because they own and
maintain highways which, it is asserted, are indirect sources
of pollution.
The notion of an indirect source of pollution,
I think, was developed somewhat more in PPA’s brief than it
was in oral argument.

And T think,perhaps, we should give

a little more attention to it here, because it is the slim
thread upon which this entire statutory Scheme is founded,
the notion of indirect source.

So we ought to step back a

little bit and ask where this notion that a highway is an
indirect source of pollution, precisely where does that come
f rom.
The first thing you notice about the term, indirect
source, is that it is not found anywhere in the statute.
Nowhere in the Clean Air Act do we read anything, not only
about a highway being an indirect source, but the term

indirect source, is not found in the statute.
The basis for the notion of indirect source at all,
in fact, is submitted by EPA to be a essay by the Administrator,
as a preamble to some regulations.

And this is the only

basis me're given in the regulations for the concent of
indirect source.
’'Tom interestingly enough there mas in the regulations
— in fact there still is -— there is a recoil at ion actual lv
defining indirect source.

And you’ll find .it in the parting

regulations, the one that describes the- present status of
that regulation as, its operation has now been suspended
due, of course, to the interposition of Congress.
QUESTION:
along these lines?

Well, how far does your argument go
Is it your claim that there’s no newer

to regulate any indirect source of air pollution?
NR. HOSKOT?ITJ!:

well> indeed there is.

What we’re

trying to shew now is the chain of reasoning by which it is
established that a highway is an indirect source of
pollution.
QUESTION:

All right.

NR. N0SK0WIT3:

And that state policies with

respect to those highways can be the proper subiect of
legislation.

Ho what I'm demonstrating

now is that starting

with no concrete anchor in the statute, we are then given the
concept of indirect source: and how that concent has been

fi4
utilized in this particular test.
QUESTIO7!:

Fell, now — but what, then, leads

you to concede that there is any power to recralate anv
indirect source, if there’s no statutory authority?
MR. MOSKOWi"?:

Well, I don’t really have to reach

the question of whether there's newer to regulate any
indirect source.
QUESTION:

Well, T think there’s some importance

here»
MR. MOSEOWITZ:

Yes.

Well, I haven't really

addressed the question of whether there's power to regulate
any indirect source.

What we're showing is that if there is

power to regulate an indirect source, that power does not
extend to regulating state transportation policies as
an indirect source.
QUESTIONi

Well, if there is, then one takes a

step from that, or doesn’t take a step from that.

Rut if

there isn't any power whatever to regulate any indirect
source, then you don't take the first step.
MR. MOQKOWITZ:
QUESTION:

I agree.

I think it's quite important in this

argument, whether or not you —MR. MOSKOWITZ:

Frankly, your honor, I don't see

anywhere in the statute where indirect source is addressed
at all.

And I'm being cautious on that ground simply because

it's a question the states don't have to reach.

I am

certainly not conceding anything —•
QUESTION:
to reach it.

No, it may very well he you do have

Because as I say, it there is a power on the

part of the Administrator of a state plan to reach an
indirect source, then we're faced with one kind of a case.
If there's no power at all to reach any indirect source,
then you have a much easier case.
MR. MQSKOWITK:

I think the short answer, your

honor, is that. I don’t see it in the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't vour argument — shouldn't

your argument be, perhaps, that assuming that there's power
in Congress

not in EPA, in Congress -- to regulate

indirect sources. Congress has not undertaken to exercise it
in statutes.
MR. MOSKOWITZ:
QUESTION:

Oh, we

indeed agree on that point.

Well, then you say that Congress, in
*

this statute, has not authorized the Administrator to
regulate any indirect source of air pollution.

Is that

your position?
MR. .U0SKQNIT7:

It's my position simply because

I haven't located the power in the statute.
QUESTION:

Fell,. Mr. Moskowitz , I’m not quite sure

how all these letters and numbers go together.

But Section

And it certainly

And couldn’t the

Administrator take the position that I am choosing to define
sources broadly, and the indirect sources -would be included
as wall as direct sources?
MR. MOSKOFIT2:

It seems to me --- and I agree.

Conceivably, he obviously has done that.

But I think the

question that I would like to proceed with, in order to fully
answer your question, is that we have to understand what an
indirect source is.
HUBSTION:

Well, an indirect source —

.MR. MOSKONIT75:
oofPTION?

In order to define — well —

Am I right in this, in my concent and

understanding of what a typical indirect source would be?
It would be a repair garage where — whose business is
repairing carbeufcors.

And private people take their auto­

mobiles in-there, maybe a hundred automobiles a day are in
there with the motors running, and they are ad-justing the
carburetors, and the gasoline fumes —• the various effluents
from carburetors -— arise from this repair shoo.

That would

be -- the repair .shop would be an indirect source, would it
not be?

As a matter of definition?
MR. MOFKONIT7:

It isn't the purest example,

because in that particular instance, the owner of the repair

67
shop would be creating the furies through manipulating the
cars directly, which isn't what the states are doing,
QUESTION:

These would be cars orivafcely owned,

paired,
MR, MORKOWITZ:
QUESTION:

I think — I think —

And the cars would be there as perniteas

or licensees on the premises,
MR, MOSKOWITZ:

Rather than give examples, I think

the most helpful thing I could do is to tell you what ERA
says it is, and maybe using that as •— it’s their concept,
and rather than us trying to figure out what it could be,
we can see what EPA said it is.
And in fact, they have defined it, and defined it
in the regulations (which, incidentally, have not been
cited by EPA, interestingly).

But the regulation defining

indirect source — we can focus very narrowly on what the
definition is.

It's found at 40 C.F.R., Section 52.22 sub

(b), and I'll read it because it's very short,
QUESTION:

Has that been the focus here anywhere?

MR. MOSKOFITZ:

It has not been cited by EPA, and

we have discovered it only belatedly, because as we said, the
it was tied to regulation of parking — new parking structures.
It's operation has been suspended, whatever that means.
so we didn't discover it until recently.

QUESTION:

52.22?

MR. MOSKOFITZ:

52.22 (b).

And what this says —

it's very short — the tern quote, indirect source, close
quote, means, a facility, buildinq, structure or installation
which attracts or may attract mobile source activity that
results in emissions of a pollutant for which there is a
national standard.

Puch indirect sources include but are

not limited to — and then seven examples follow.

I think

it's worthwhile to nav a little bit of attention to what those
examples are.
They include: retail commercial and industrial
facilities; recreation, amusement, sports and entertainment
facilities; airports; office and governmental buildings;
apartment and condominium buildings; education facilities.
Fhat basically EPA is saying is that any place
which anyone could ever want to get to for any purpose
which is a man-made structure or facility is an indirect
source.

It includes virtually every man-made object within

the jurisdiction of EPA.

It is a very, very broad and

sweeping concept, and certainly represents an expansive view
of EPA.' s mowers.
How, interestingly, one of the examples given in

this commodious list of what an indirect source — and as
I think I — the reason I wanted to read that, I think
it shows you that it is far more than garaaes.
everything.

It is

This building is an indirect source.

Everything is an indirect source.
But the curious thing is that also included on the
list of indirect sources are highways and roads.

That, in

fact, is interestingly given as the very first example.
There’s a difference between highways and roads, and all
these other indirect sources.

As I indicated, the other

examples given are destinations, a place to which a person
might want to go.

He is attracted to those destinations,

such as having to go to work.

He is attracted to work.

And then after work, he is attracted to going back home.

He

is attracted to the supermarket, and mavbe to the ball park.
QUESTION:

Well, he’s attracted to the superhighway,

too.
MR. MOSKOWIT7.:

Well, the difference between

being attracted to the highway and being attracted to his
destination is that the highway is the means of croina to
the indirect source.
QUESTION:

Well, let’s assume that the Xndianolis

Speedway is owned by the City of Indiapolis.
MR. MOSKO^ITS :
QUESTION:

Indeed.

to regulate the —
HR. MOSKOWTTZ:

The Indiapolis Speedway is, under

this definition, clearly an indirect source.

The sole point

that I'm trying to make here is that unlike the other
examples of indirect sources — unless one is a street
dragster, or maybe in the case of the Indiapolis highway, a
race car driver — few people are intrinsically attracted to
highways,
So the difference between them — and I'm only
showing this difference to show how there is this drift
from the statutory grounding — the difference is thatthe
highway is —■ we could perhaps term it, an indirect indirect
source.

It enables one to get to an indirect source.

is not an intrinsic attraction.

It

It serves as a means by

which one would get to the intrinsic attraction.
QUESTION:

Well, how about a sewer?

That enables —

that's a conduit for effluents from one place to another.
MR. MOPKONITZ:

Well, of course, the sewer example,

you know, we have two dimensions to the sewer example.

And

I suppose — they're not trying to regulate that as an indirect
source here.
QUESTION:

No, becaiise — that’s ~

MR. HOSKOWIT7:

I suppose the constitutional

question as to whether, you know, that analysis would apply
here, is properly Mr. Lord's.

The point that we're trying to

make here is that the concept of the highway as an indirect
source is not statutorily grounded.

Whether Congress could

have written it in as they wrote in sewers or as the federal
common law considered sewers is maybe a question that we
don't have to consider now.
Bi.it I think — the point that I've made so far
is that highways are, at best, an indirect indirect source.
But as the sole authority for EPA's application of its
concept of indirect source makes plain, namely, the
Administrator, it doesn't stop there with solely saying that
the highway is an indirect source.

Rather it uses the

concept that the highway is a source of pollution as a
springboard for its next step.
And the Administrator in his preface says that
what he's concerned about is not so much the existence of
highways.

What he's concerned about is that the, quote,

requlatory taxing and investment decisions made at all
levels of government which encourage the use of highways
by automobiles are also an indirect source.

He also says ~-

he cites as indirect sources particular examples;

licensing

vehicles and operators; providing a system of traffic laws;
as well as not

making choices which would have discouraged

the use of single passenger automobiles and encouraged the
use of mass transit.
So there's a certain shift here from the physical

12
object which may attract someone to go in a mobile source of
pollution, namely, a car, which, as we indicated, includes
everything in the known universe.

There’s a shift to

state policies which encourage the use of these automobiles
as opposed to mass transit? and state involvement, not only
as an owner — because the owner concept is what's being
stressed before this court — but the focus that’s set forth
by the Administrator himself when he came up with this
idea is not the state as an owner, but the state as a
regulatory, taxing and investment maker, a provider of
traffic lav/s.
QUESTIO?!:

On that very

point, supposing you had a

large factory with a large parking lot that would come within
the indirect source definition you described.

would it he

your view that the Administrator "would have the statutory
authority to regulate that indirect source by saying, you
must adopt a company policy of certain timing of shifts, of
certain regulations in the parking lot,, or certain — you
can’t let anybody use the parking lot unless they have a car
with, you knot-?, proper emissions --- that kind of regulation
of a private owner?

Would that be permissible?

MR. MOSKOWITZ:

What we were saying — of course

there was a good deal of dispute, as you recall, before
the Congress and the Administrator abandoned the indirect
source — the parking lots as an indirect source, and told

73
the Administrator not to regulate that»
deal of Constitutional discussion.

There was a good

And it's a position which

1 don't believe the state ever took a position on.

And we

don't take one now.
But there's a substantial difference between what
the Administrator could do to that owner of the parking
lot, and what it's prepared to do vis a vis the state.
Because you could tell — if you were to tall the owner of
the parking lot, shut dovm your parking lot, vary different
from telling the state, I want you to exercise your police
powers to regulate that private individual.

QUESTION:

Well, not in Los Angeles.

MR. MOBKGWITZ s
QUESTION;

And in fact —

Certainly not in Los Angeles.

Mr. Moskowits, what would be your

view of an Administrator's regulation that did not require
the state to establish a bus lane, but simnlv said, no more
than x amount of exhaust emissions shall be permitted per
qiven lineal mile of freeway.

And if the state wants to do

it by nutting in a bus lane, fine.

If thev want to put it

by limiting the cars on the highway, fine.

v’Tould you view

that differently than the bus lane regulation?
MR. MOSKOWITZ:

If something were available to the

states, such as building a plastic dome over the freeway
and somehow not letting that —- those pollutants into the
air, but putting it somewhere else to make it somehow more
analogous to the sewer example, then perhaps we could
say, they could do that.
But the prime evil here is not so much the subject
matter of the regulation

and that's why, vou know, we

haven't been very hard on the notion, abstractly, of
indirect source; that somehow a highway

could be regulated.

The prime evil, and the one that I wish to stress and leave
with this Court, is what RPA's contents of the regulations
are, the notion that the state must use its police powers
to regulate private conduct, to make not coming in for an
inspection a violation, to make not —■ after the inspection
and after 60 per cent of the cars which are mandated to fail

the only ways that are available are to use our police

QUESTION;

YOu simply have more power than a

private polluter to do it.
NR. MOSKOWITZ:

You can do it more easily.
The Administrator has not gone to

Justice Rehnquist's position.

The Administrator rather

presents this Court with a notion that it is going to change
the very regulations which are at issue here, and this
deals with Mr. Justice Powell's question of what's left in
this case.

Everything is left in this case upon which

certiorari was granted.

Because the Administrator not only

has not told this Court, I'm going to withdraw these
regulations; the case is moot.

He hasn't said that.

OUEPTION:

Well, federal officials have intruded

into the states since the time of the Whiskey Rebel 5 ion.
MR. MOSKOWTTZ:

Indeed, indeed.

And in fact

many of the examples given by the Administrator are —
specific constitutional empowerment of the federal government
to force the state to do particular kinds of things under
the War Powers Act, or .Article 3 and various other examples,
but no such power exists under the Commerce Clause to
force the states to use their police power in any particular
manner, and that’s our major point in this case.

MR. MOSKOWITZ:

Within the statute, you don’t

find any specific authority, and the presumption is that
traditional state functions are not likely to be found to
be usurped or regulated by the federal government, and that
this tatute does not present that specific authority, and
that in the absence of that, it should not be surmised, it
should not be read into the statute, the presumption should
be that traditional state authorities are to be maintained
unimpaired by a federal statute unless Congress says
differently.

Well, I thought you just answered —

MR. MOSKOtflTZ :
QUESTION:

Indeed.

Justice Rehnquist that yes, that would be all right to do
that.
MR. MOSKOWXTZ:

But you see the private operator

QUESTION:

I understand that.

I thought you said

awhile ago that there is no authoritv to regulate any
indirect source.
QUESTION:

No, he didn't.

MR. MOSKONITZ:
to be waffling on.

That was the one that I appeared

I think it was because I haven't explored

all the parameters, because once one suggests any indirect
>

source, then one gets into the Administrator's regulation
where everything is an indirect source.

And I'm not willing

to concede that he can regulate everything.
But the difference between a private highway opsrato
doing this and the state doing this is that the private
highway operator can't.give tickets.

He can't use any

police power, any criminal sanctions, to force peoole to stay
in their bus lanas.

I suppose you can say, don't you come

back here anymore.

But uniquely, the state is the one who

has to keep people in the bus lanes,

tad the way they do

it is to enforce a system of traffic laws.

And when the

Administrator tells a state, we demand you use your police
power to, quote, enforce our regulations, to make that
private conduct criminal under state law, that's the evil
we're addressing here, and that’s what we're suggesting is
nowhere to be found anywhere within the four corners of the
Clean Air Act.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY R. LORD, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF ?1ARYLAND AS RESPONDENT1
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. LORD:

Mr. Lord.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The constitutional arguments will attempt to track
the most recent metamorphoses of the ERA position as reflected
in the two briefs and in the argument this morning.
While the shift in position of ERA, contrary to
its statement, has been desperate and radical, the outcome
has not changed, and the effect upon the states possibly
is even more intrusive than with the regulations which were

presented to the Circuit Courts on petitions by the party
states.
I think perhaps the way to demonstrate the dif­
ference would be to turn to Appendix A of the brief that
we describe our sovereign goals, and that's pages 1A through
3A, and we have set out there an illustrative inspection
and maintenance program»

It happens to be the one that

was mandated for the State of Maryland.
Now, bear in mind that in the metropolitan
Baltimore intrastate qir duality control region there are
approximately 1.1 million private vehicles, light, medium
and heavy duty vehicles? I suppose the number increases
as much as seven fold when you move into the Los .Angeles
air quality control region.
Now, looking at the regulation, on the first page,
when this becomes a federal regulation in all its particulars
as described by Mr. Randolph this morning, the essential
change on page 1A, in stead of saying the State of Maryland
shall establish — at the bottom of the page — an inspection
and maintenance program, it will say, the State of Maryland
shall carry out a federal inspection and mainenance program.
We haven’t seen these new regulations, so all we
can. do is surmise as to what they may contain.

But this

would seem to foe logically following from fie positions
stated in the briefs and arguments.

00

At the top of page 2 A, in the fourth line , the
state will no longer have power to exempt arsy category of
vehicles, and I'm sure that
would be federal exemptions.

any exemptions that exist
The business about the state

shall submit within the particular time period legally
adopted regulations would no longer be necessary because the
federal regulations would speak for themselves.
Now, all the operative
be provisions (c)

provisions, which would

(1) through (f) on 2A, (d) and (e) at

It says that 30 per cent of vehicles shall

It happens to be 50 per cent of the vehicles in some

of the California districts.
The sanction for the frequency of inspection is
stated in (1), and this again would be a new federal
regulation.

It says that all vehicles, all 1.1 million

vehicles, will have to be inspected periodicallv no more
than one year apart.

So that’s the standard and the frequency.

shall be in a year that expired, during the time that this

MR. LORD;

Your honor, those provisions I think

would be out the same way that the early provisions about
the state having to submit within a particular time, at
the top of page 2A.

Because the state, presumably, if we

follow strictly the argument that you've heard from EPA,
would hot.have to adopt any legislation, and would not have
to adopt any regulations.

These would become the state

and recast

And I appreciate Justice Powell's problem,

but frankly, the states have had the same problem trying to
prepare for this case.
Now, as far as sanctions are concerned, I think

92

we can begin to see the intrusive’ nature of this new
approach.

If you look at (3), it says, these shall includev-

program.

There is no safety inspection

So this would be a brand new program.

The only

safety inspection in Maryland, for example, is when a vehicle
changes hands.

A used car is sold, it has to be inspected.

So for the first time we'd have a new •—

does.

It's in EPA'3

I think Virginia

Maryland does not happen to have one.
And so, it's obvious here that despite what •

•

EPA would like to have this Court believe, the sanction
here is not merely a licensing sanction on an annual basis,

93

the theory being, I suppose, that because the state licenses
already, it’s not really very much to ask the state to
conduct its licensing affairs in a different way»
There will have to be interim sanctions against
violators-

'Presumably those will be criminal.

If someone

weeks he must bring his vehicle into compliance, does not,

is to disconnect the devices he’s placed on his car, most
likely a criminal sanction.
Where is the source of it?

The source is going to

have to be this new federal regulation.

Because Maryland

does not happen to have any legislation on that subject.
And at this point has not had any reason to have any legis­
lation on the point.
Bo I think it? s much too seductive an argument to
suggest that legislation is not inevitable.

This program

will be one that will have to be managed by a group of people.
Now, we’ve had the helpful suggestion from EPA
that we could contract this out and maybe even make money
on it.

I don’t know that teh states have to adopt the

suggestions made by Counsel.

Obviously that would have

to be considered.
QUESTION:

Arizona has done that?

94
MR. LORD:

That's correct, Arizona has done that.

And I think that there was a referendum in November in
which that program was approved and effective about 12
days ago.

But that certainly is an option ■—
QUESTION:

There are several states that have

private inspections.
MR. LORD:

Certainly.

QUESTION;

Several states have that.

MR. LORD;

I suppose —

QUESTION:

Virginia has that.

MR. LORD:

I suppose, your honor, very many

governmental programs could be leased out.

The whole budget

making program, I suppose, could be leased out to an
accounting firm.

But it seems to me that one of the

essences

of sovereignty is that the states continue to have the options
available to them as to whether this will be done or whether
it won't be done.

And to suggest that everything is fore­

closed to the state except the option of hiring someone
to carry out the program, I think by its own terms, is
intrusive enough.
Now, when you look at the constitutional framework
of this — and bear in mind we have also had another
gracious concession by EPA that despite the clear language
of Section 113, this Administrator at least will not seek
criminal sanctions against states for violation here, despite

95
the fact that there's a $25,000 a day fine, and a 1 year
in jail per day fine, or both, that this Adrsinistrator
has decided he won't seek that against states.

Now that's

somewhat reassuring, but hardly puts the case to rest.
Obviously, the injunctive remedy here could be
very difficult for a state to live with.
Now, this has advanced to this Court as a compre­
hensive substitute transportation control plan.
that is the only way in

Indeed,

which this program could have any

federal authority whatsoever under Section 119.

And I'll

come later to the significance of this lack of comprehensiveness.
But turning to the —

Mr. Lord, I'm late in asking you this

question, but I want to be sure I understand it, even though
belatedly.
Your argument is proceeding upon the premise, upon
the hypothesis, that the statute does authorize what the

is unconstitutional.

Is that correct?

MR. LORD:

I should say, your honor, if one read

them carefully rather than be as direct.
I got the direct imnression that the Court had
taken an early look, in fact, discussed in some detail, the
constitutional problem, and had followed the doctrine
that when the constitutional problem seemed to be overwhelming
that there is a wav in which the constitutional issue can
be avoided, the Court would do it.
And it is clear that those are based on statutory
holdings.

Rut I think it's also clear that both of those

Courts, if more had been written, would have found the program
as stated then, pre-national Tie ague of Cities, hv almost
a year, both those cases, unconstitutional.
oprSTION:

But you — now your argument is assuming

that contrary to the Courts of Appeals that the statute
does permit what the Administrator gives vou here.

9j

MR. LORD:

Correct.- your honor.

And turning to that, first of all there is an
irony that after describing this new federal urogram, we
find that the only way the federal government has uotten to
the point of having the authority to do it, is through the
mechanism of a prior finding several years ago that the
state didn't have sufficient authoritv to do this themselves,
or they had not presented enough, so the states are told,
and were all told, back in 1°71, that they had not r>reduced
enough authority to carry out the program.

mha£ was the

exciting cause, if vou will, of the intrusion of the federal
government.
Mow we’re told that these regulations have been
withdrawn, and that there's been inherent federal authoritv
all along to do this through federal regulations.
Mow, the point was brought up by Justice Stevens
about a swarm of federal officials coming into the states
and perhaps being more intrusive, if not in a constitutional
sense, in a governmental sense, than what we are opposing

But our position constitutionally is, that

9B
the federal government has ample authority to-take this
program over itself.

In fact? I would go so far as to say

that the federal government could preempt this entire
program, carry it out through federal ftmdsand federal
employees, and bv a notice sometime prior to the licensing
expiration period in a state, notify a state that x vehicle
is not yet in compliance.

And the state would then have

to use, in that limited intrusion, lose — use its licensing
functions to not issue a state license.
I happen to feel — T should say, we hanpen to
feel, that that would not be so .intrusive as to be constitu

Anything short of that, however, —
QUESTION:

^he federal government coiild say —

no car on the highway without a federal sticker on it.
MR. LORD:

That's correct.

Rut then the question comes up, and we've talked
about this, as to whether that would require a separate
federal registration and licensing, or whether that could
be carried out and executed through the state licensing
fxmction.
And our conclusion was -- even thouah it's oerhaps
a concession that we don't have to make — that, the federal
government could use the existing licensing and de-licensing
mechanism of the state.

MR. LORD:

Right.

And we may have to have the

swarm that Justice Etevens was concerned about.
Now, X think it's interesting that ERA has said

inn
to thin Court this morning that no constitutional source
was cited for this 1^71 regulation.

And all of these

regulations, and this whole theory, was conceived of
in the latter half of 1973, within IP months after ^PA
lost -1RDC V. UP A.
That's simply not the case.

Tn fact, right in

the preamble to the Administrator’s theories, which have
been discussed today at length, is a citation to United Statesv.
California, as the axithority for what it is doing.
And in fact, U.C. v. California was so annealing to Uf'A
787

that in its brief in chief

United States v. California

was cited California v?as cited four times.
The United states v. California decision is reallv
more helpful to the states than it is to UPA.

And the

reason for that is that in the California case there was
a

railroad owned by the state of California that connected

45 state owned wharves in Can Francisco with a bunch of
industrial users some distance away at an interstate railroad.
It charged for the service, just like anv private railroad
would have.

And as such, the court found that there was

no valid distinction between what California was doing and
what a private railroad was doing.
And what we have here is the support for our
conclusion that state facilities are in now way exempted
from the Clean Air Act.

Tn fact, state facilities are included

and they could not urge on this Court with any degree of
success — at least they've never been able to do so in
the past — the state sovereignty argument available to
a state.

local matters, and so I don’t think they really fall within

QUESTION:

Mr. Lord, following up on Justice Stevens’

question for a minute, if the federal government sets out
to reach this fleet of motorcars that's operated by the
state, as you concede it may, can the Administrator say to
the state, you shall fine every drive?- who doesnot keep his
vehicle in compliance with the applicable federal standards
not less than $100?
MR. LORD:
with that.

I would have a great deal of trouble

I think that to the extent that it does require

operation on anyone else, even another state employee, in
the form of a sanction, I think it *s constitutional.

Once

you get beyond tha.t, it gets into a dangerous area.
Now the arguments that I'm presenting today are
hardly novel.

In fairness, we have been waiting with

baited breath to recede the reply brief from the federal
government which we received on Monday, to see if they were
at that point able to find a single case that stood for
the proposition that they espoused.

And they have not.

is clear that there is no case that stands for the proposition
thatthe commerce clause can be used to drag in the police
power of a sovereign state.

QUESTION:

Well, let’s taka the proprietary power

looked at one way at least, it’s not unlike the power that
the owner of a private turnpike would have to limit the
traffic density on his turnpike at the behest of the

107
Administrator.

And he would have that — the Administrator,

concededly , 1 think from what vre've heard, both under the
statute and under the constitution, would have the power
to regulate the owner of a private turnpike and say no more
than so many vehicles a minute on the ttarnpike.
®nldn't the same thing be said to a state?

And why

Because the

private operator doesn't have any police power.

He just

has the proprietary power that comes from ownina the
turnpike.
MR. LORD:

Which means that if he can own it, he

can also shut it down or limit access to it.
QUESTION:

Or limit access to it.

MR. LORD:

Well, I have a great deal of

problem

with the proposition that the state, could, for example,
declare a moratorium on new car registrations in the state,
the way it's done for sewar hookups, for example.

Because

it seems to me you may get into right to travel problems
and all sorts of other arbitrary and capricious problems.
I think there are probably other things that the
federal government could explore that neither the federal
government or the states have thought of.

Maybe that's a

good thing, but —

requirements, whatever the requirements are.

MR. LORD:

Well, your honor, I don't think I’m

begging the question when I just identify a problem with that.
That is a one year program, and when the licenses are
issued on the 1st of April, if that card is given to that
owner, that means that before he comes back the next March the
31st, he will have had to have done something.

And I

frankly don’t think that this is anything like what EPA had
inmind —
QUESTION:

Well, I’m just talking about the power.

MR. LORD:

Well, I think obviously —*

QUESTION:

Not whether Maryland wants to do it,

MR. LORD:

Right.

QUESTION:

— .can be required to do it but whether

or —-

it has the power to do it.
MR. LORD:

I think that that comes close to the

lesser intrusiveness aspects of my argument earlier.

I

think you’d have to take a hard look at whether they were
interim sanctions that the state would have to impose —
QUESTIOTT:

The sanction would be that the state

109
would not issue the license unless they had established
compliance„

That would mean you would have to set up

an inspection system —
MR. LORD:

That’s right.

OUERTION:

-- since you say you don’t have one.

MR. LORD:

You’d have to set it up, and you’d

also -- if you — as the inspection program for used cars
that are traded is now set up, it would have to be a system
of certification of facilities throughout the region, which
would meet the standards.

So that when the fellow came

back with the certification a year later, at least you'd
know that that certification was worth something other than
the piece of paper that it was written on.
Now the problem with that is that there will have
to be an additional sanction against errant inspection
stations.

Now the only way that can be done is through a

mole new program of licensing inspection stations.

And no

matter what EPA says, that is obviously something that would
have to be state legislation.

You just can't create that

problem in the mind of an Administrator somewhere and
expect it to be adequate notice for anybody.

There would

haveto be standardsset, and a staff to manage it.
If I could just close by saying, your honor, that
the constitutional

theory announced by EPA in its most

statements attempts to put EPA in the position that the state

110
of March has been described as being in, entering this
case like a lion,, and departing like a lamb.
Now, I think the analysis — the proper analysis —
would indicate that the new theory of EPA is even more
pernicious.

And to pursue the analogy, more leonine, than

the original position which has been abandoned.

And I think

the states are entitled tc have both the statutory and
constitutional questions decided in their favor..
