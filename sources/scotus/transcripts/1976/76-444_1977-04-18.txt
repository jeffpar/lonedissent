MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Mo. 76-444, Northeast Marine Terrairial
v. Caputo, consolidated with No. 75-454, International Terminal
v. Blundo.
Mr. Kimball, I think you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. KIMBALL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS, NORTHEAST MARINE TERMINAL
MR. KIMBALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
These consolidated cases present first impression
questions as to the meaning and scope of the status and situs
1972 amendments to sections 2(3) and 3(a) of th© Longshoremen's
and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.
Petitioners in 76-444, whom I represent, have always
conceded that there is no situs'question in thair case, and so
I hope to be permitted to limit my remarks to th© status
question.
These consolidated cases present the status question
in two distinguishable fact situations.

In 76-444, the employes

Caputo was helping load a consignee’s truck with break bulk
boxes of cheese.

In 76-454, employee Blundo was tallying cargo

which was being removed from a shipping container.

Therefore,

I hope to be. allowed to focus my remarks on whether employees

5
doing the sort of work which Mr. Caputo was doing, truck
loading work, have the coverage status.
Now, the threshold question is whether I may properly
focus solely upon the work which Mr. Caputo was doing when
was injured, or whether, as did the majority below, I must also
consider the fact that on other occasions Mr. Caputo spent a
significant part of his time aboard ships doing the traditional
loading and discharging work of a longshoreman.
Neither the Administrative Lav? Judge nor the Benefits
Review Board paid any attention whatsoever nor even mentioned
what Mr. Caputo did on other occasions.

The Administrativa Law

Judge specifically fixed Mr. Caputo*s status at the time of tka
inuury and tee board affirmed on. the ground that at that time
he was loading and discharging a ship and not loading a truck
as Judge Widener discerned in a similar fact situation in the
Adkins case, which is initially cited on page 5 of petitioners'
blue covered brief.
The legislative history is not crystal clear.

The

majority below and the First and Third Circuit Courts of Appeals
have held that status should not be determined solely as of the
time of injury.

The Fifth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals

have held to the contrary.
This Court, in decisions prior to the 1972 amendments,
has held that section 3(a) situs, section 2(2) injury in the
course of ©nployment, and sectio:-.

6

of crew raembars mast all b® determined at the tim
the

:

uyae g

iry
L on

other occasions.
It is suggested in our brief 'chat it would b© anomal­
ous if section 2(3) employe® status were determined on the
basis of what th@ man generally did, but then he was excluded
under the same section, because of what he was particularly do­
ing on an occasion.
It is further suggested in our brief that the general
functional criteria will bs almost appallingly difficult to
administer and adjudicate for reasons which xm have suggested
at pages 10 and 11.
Now, tlie federal respondent has distorted cur first
point by suggesting that longshoremen who are working on a
ship and who are obviously covered by both the old and the new
Act would not be covered while they ware using the ship’s
toilet facilities.

They would be, because of the work they

were doing or had been assigned to do.

And they would also bs

covered while they ware taking a coffee break aboard the ship,
because.; of the work which they had been assigned to do.
Although the federal respondent makes an important
concession that Congress 1 expressad intent to extend coverage
"to employees who would otherwise be covered bv this Act for
part of thair activity," implies that only persons who might
.

in; rate:

7
the 'new Act.

And parenthetically i would respectfully suggest

tc -she, Court that in c^nicci vir::, I irv® just quoted "by
Act" pretty clearly means by 'the old Act which the committee
was looking to amend.
As I say, although the federal respondent makes that
important concession, it arguas that because of what it says
is the risky task for cargo handling on the waterfront, all
"physical" cargo handling activity within the statutory situs
confers statutory status.
Ws have a stipulation in 76-444 that the work which
th© employes was doing, namely loading cheese in a consignee’s
truck with the assistance of a dolly, had the same risk factor
wherever trucks are loaded or unloaded with dollies.
Now, presumably th© government's suggestion that
there should be a limitation on, physical activity, was meant
to exclude clerical employees on the situs who, as Judge
Friendly wrote, are not, covered even by the most liberal con­
struction of tli® statute.
I should add also parenthetically that in a consider­
abis number of unappealed Benefits Review Board decisions, the
board has held that clerical personnel are covered by the
amendments.

MR. KIMBALL;

No longer do the executives go to the

MR. KIMBALL:

They are down on th© terminal and, of

course, they have all these usual clerical people down there,

QUESTION:

MR. KIMBALL;

its employees who definitely arc working loading and discharging

opinion below.

Excuse me, Your Honor?

It is not covered, according to the

But the Benefits Review Board has repeatedly

decided —
QUESTION:

On what basis is what I want to know.

MR. KIMBALL;

Well, the Benefits Review Board, if

Your Honor pleases, is virtually reading situs and status re­
quirements out of the statute.

They seem bant upon extending

this coverage to an appalling extent.

They would blanket, I

believe, the United States with this coverage if they could do
so.

In the thousands and thousands of cases which now there

must ba before the Benefits Review Board, I do not recall a
single one in which an employer has prevailed.
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t, a bookkeeper ©r a telephone oper­

ator whose place of employment was on the dock and whose
employer fell within the definition ©f 2(4) — and that would
be maritime employment, because that is the employer's business,
so wouldn't the telephone operator or bookkeeper fall within
the literal terms of these two statutes, statutory provisions?

MR. KIMBALLS

No, sir, they wouldn't fall within the

literal terras of the statute or within its infcsnh terms,

10
because. -QUESTION:

Well, take sway «•- apart from its iaa-aah,

how about the literal terms, you don’t think they are in
maritime employment?
MR. KIMBALL:

If Your Honor pleases, because of the

definition of employe© in section 2(3), no.
QUESTION:

Where are you referring to?

MR. KIMBALL:

I am referring on page 1 of the appen­

dix in the blue brief.
QUESTION:

It is cm pug© 3 of your brief, i believe,

isn't it?
MR. KIMBALL:
QUESTION:

It may fos there as well, sir.

Now, why ~

MR. KIMBALL:

And the language there is "employee

who means any person engaged in maritime employment," and so
on and on.
QUESTION:

Wall, don't you think that a telephone

operator employed by a stevedoring company, whose business is
to load and unload ships, is engaged in maritime employment?
MR. KIMBALL:

No, sir, because I believe the statute

necessitates that the employe© of the stevedore be engaged in
loading and unloading ships„
QUESTION:

Well, we are talking now about maritime

employment.
MR. Kimballs

That3s right, sir

11

lag

-

just stop with the first phrase, wouldn’t i:.hp clerical employ03
be covered?
MR. KIMBALL;

I do not conceive it to be so, Your

Honor.
QUESTION;

Wail, are you reading the following

phrase after the word "longshoreman" as modifying the entire
concept, that is "or other parsons engaged in longshoring
operations, " and you say,

I -take it, that a secretary is not

engaged ia longshoring operations, even if she works for a
maritime employer?
MR. KIMBALL;
QUESTION;

That is true, sir.

And that would b© true of the telephone

operator or all the other people who don’t actually function
as longshoremen?
MR. KIMBALL:

Participata in some way in the movement

of cargo, participate ia som© way other than remotely by
shuffling papers or doing things of that nature.
QUESTION;

There is no other definition of maritime

employment ia the Act?
MR. KIMBALLs

There is no definition of maritime

employment in the Act, Your Honor, and that, of course, has
been the difficulty all along.

QUESTION;

Mr. Kirbs.ll, cm the question of silnv?; too,

do you read the definition in 3 (a) as including buildings whir

are on a pier or wharf?

Th

noni

i

:

which includes a building, but they do include a building nay,
which kind of suggests to me that they didn’t intend to in­
clude feuiIding.
MR. KIMBALL:

Your Honor, I read th® situs require­

ment as including structures on a pier, dock or adjoining
structure.
QUESTION:

What is building way in 3(3)?

MR. KIMBALL:

I am trying to find it.

I think build­

ing way, if Your Honor pleases, is a structure having to do
with th® construction or repair of ships.

It goes along with

marine railway.
Now, adopting a suggestion in the Third Circuit
jobs case, the federal respondent argues that Congress5 in­
clusion of "employees who pick up"

— I say inclusion, I

misspoke myself and badly so, and this gets into why we don’t
cover coast line operators, perhaps.

Congress specifically

excluded "employees who pick up stored cargo for further
transshipment."
The government respondent argues that that must
necessarily mean truckman who receive delivery of cargo fox'
further overland transportation.

But that interpretation makes

the last two sentences of the committee report, which are
quoted on page 5 of the appendix to the blue covered brief, it
makes those last two sentences idiotically redundant.

And it

13

ignores th© fact that by statutory 4 ?f iaition thestj trnclc.xn
ars nou ccvsrsd by the Act because the trucking compani
not statutory employers as defined bv section 2(4) of the
statute.

*

And I would like to point out, because we read these
things so many times and the words escape us unless wa read
them over and over, but it is interesting to nets the distinc­
tion which the committee is making, and I think inarguably with
malice of forethought, if you please, on this fifth page.
They talk up there toward the top;
— thinking in terms of statutory employees

"Thus, employees"
"whose responsi­

bility is only to pick up stored cargo" and so forth.

Then

they talk down the last two sentences about individuals, and
they talk not about employers but they are talking about persons .
And then they make an interesting distinction,

in the very

last two lines they talk about navigable waters, which under
the expansive situs definition we know includes shore installa­
tions of the sort that Mr. Justice Stevens was remarking about,
but her© they draw a distinction between navigable waters and
pier adjoining navigable waters, which under thi-s amended defin­
ition is part of navigable waters.
Now, the federal respondent has distorted — excuse
me — the federal respondent has made some diversionary sugges­
tions which I respectfully submit both to the federal respondent
and to this Honorable Court are less than, helpful.

14
They refer, for irubauc®, to defensa base act de­
cisions by this Court, the O'Leary case, the O'Keeffe case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kimbal, before you read your point

about navigable waters including a pier, your last sentence, I
didn’t understand the argument you based on that last sen­

tence.

I didn't understand your point at all.
MR. KIMBALL:
QUESTION:

If Your Honor please —

I understand that the pier is within the

statutory definition of navigable waters and the report says
the pier is to be distinguished from navigable waters, which
seems inconsistent.

What do you. draw from that?

MR. KIMBALL:

I draw from that, if Your Honor pleases,

that the last two sentences of the report are an effort to in­
dicat© that, truckmen who are employed by trucking companies
are not intended to be included, therefore in an earlier part
of the report when the committee excludes employees whose re­
sponsibility is only to pick up stored cargo for further trans­
shipment, they are not
trucking companies.

talking about truckmen or employees of

They are "talking about somebody else.

And

I respectfully suggest that they are talking about people like
Caput© or indeed people who are performing functions like Mr.
BXundo, which Mr. Prettyman will talk about in just a moment.
These defense base act citations I suggest are not
helpful.

The Court has held that being injured at a defense

base act situs is not sufficient to entitle an employee to

15
ccrapensat ion.

Th© decision? which the government has cit&d

hold that the injury must result from a zone- of specis.':,
risk at th© defense base situs,

we know by stipulation that

Mr. Caputo was not performing any high-risk longshoring acti­
vity for which, as the majority below conceded, the Act is
intended to compensat®.
The federal respondent pleads for deference to the
Benefit Review Board consistent administrative interpretation
which, as I have I hope not offensively suggested to the.Court,
and as is recognized by the majority below, is a bootstrap
operation by th© board wherein they started off the first day
expanding this Act I think beyond mean and, as illustrated in
the reply brief in 76-454, the board has given virtually no
head to any status or situs limitations.
QUESTION:

Well, it wouldn't be the first government

agency that did that sort of thing, would it, and a lot of
those have bean upheld by this Court as being administrative
constructions.
MR. KIMBALL:

I think the difficulty, if Your Honor

pleases, is that the Benefits Review Board doesn't appreciate
that in ever expanding the statute it may b© depriving employees
of other rights and remedies which are superior to those pro­
vided by the Act.

I suggest, for instance, that if you expand

the statute to the ultimate limits than no on© is aver going to
b© able to sue under the authority of this Court's decision in

16

Gutierrez, no on© Is ev-jr going to fos able to sue a shipovr: r
for damages because of an u«.seaworthy cargo container.

Nor is

a railroad employee going to be able to sue.
Thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Prettyman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER, INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL
OPERATING COMPANY, INC.
MR. PRETTYMAN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I am Barrett Prettymaa, and I represent the.

International Terminal Operating Company, which I will call ITL,
the employer of the injured employee, Mr. Blusido in this case.
ITL really wears two hats.

It is a stevedoring com­

pany whose traditional job is to load and unload a vessel, but
it is also a terminal operator.

It employees terminal workers

and warehousemen to do the remaining work that needs to be dona
on a terminal after the ship is loaded or unloaded.
Mr. Blundo was a checker and had been for some five
years with ITL.

Interestingly, checkers also wear two hats.

checker can be at the vessel’s edge, checking the seal, for
example, of containers as they come off the vessel, and he is
part of the longshoring operation.

He checks those containers

as they are lowered on, as thiy first hit the pier.

That is

the checker directly — and I am quoting now *—"directly in­

volved in tbs leading or unloading functions.

that Congress

A

17
referred to in their report... aad those are the checkers that
they said were gaing Lo be oov-.srtd, arc. of course ws contend
that they ware going to be covered because they are part of the.
loading or unloading process.
But Mr. Blundo at the time of the accident and most
of the other time was wearing his other hat as a checker.

That

is, he was engaged soma distance away from where the loading
and unloading had taken place, he was removed both by distance
and by function, he was at a different terminal, a substantial
period of time had passed since the container that he was work­
ing on had been unloaded, and this particular container was
being stripped in a warehouse used for customs inspection.

His

sole job, his sol© job was to break the seal and, as the
contents were unloaded by strippsrs, he was to check then
against his manifest to make sure that the contents inside the
container corresponded with the manifest that said were the
right things.
QUESTION:

Was this container unloaded at this pier?

Is this the case where we don’t know where even it was unloaded
in this pier -MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

— or from what ship?

MR. PRETTYMANs

w© know that it was hot unloaded at

tills terminal, but we do not know where it was unloaded.

QUESTION?

Or from what ship?

MR. PRETTYMAN;

MR. PRETTYMAN:

We do know it came by truck.

but that is not in the record.

The. record doesn’t even shew

But he himself did not know whose it was,

from what ship it cam®, from what terminal it cams, or even who
unloaded it.
QUESTION;

Or how long it had been there?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Or how long it had been there.

He

said that sometimes the period of time was up to a week and
another witness said it. was quits often even longer than that
before they got to the particular function that he was engaged
in.
QUESTION;

What was this, the North River Pier or —

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION;

what, the pier where he was working?

Wh©ra h® was working.

MR. PRETTYMAN;

This was the 19th Street Pier in

Brooklyn.
QUESTION;

A Brooklyn pier.

MR. PRETT YMAN;
QUESTION;

R ig tit.

When you us© the word "unloaded," you mean

removed from the ship to tha deck?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

And is taken to its first prist of

19

rest.
QUESTION:

But

l

bio23. I:

container came from a ship?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

That’s correct, no question.

Wow, we say that Mr. Blundo.was not directly involved
in the loading or unloading functions, which I have just re; •
far rad to as Congress' criteria as to whether he was to bs
covered or not.
QUESTION:

Well, is it your contention that every­

thing that happened up to where the container was was part of
the unloading process?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

The unloading process starts when the

container is taken out of the hold or off the top of the ship,
depending upon whether it is break-bulk or container operation,
and taken down to the ground and then moved either to the
marshalling area for the container or the transit shed for the
break-bulk cargo, and at that point when it reaches that, point,
you are loading or unloading function —
QUESTION:

So the answer is yes?

MR, PRETTYMAN;
QUESTION:

You are back to the point of rest.

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Absolutely.

Well, you don’t want to stay there, do you?

MR. PRETTYMAN:

That is exactly where?, I want to stay.

I am advocating the point of rest, Your Hoho:

20
QUESTION:

And yea ile'-v.'.: tfa.<a '72 amandmeet has noth­

ing to do with it?
MR. PRETTYMANs

Oh» I think hhs '72 amendment adopted

point of rest because the '72 amendment specifically says and
refers to the fact that in the terms of unloading, taking it to
the storage area or holding area, and chat is point of rest,
and I will get in just a minute to some of the specific language
they used in the report in which they clearly indicated that
they wanted all the operations up to that storage or holding
area covered because that was the unloading operation, but they
did not want covered people working beyond that in the terminal
area.
QUESTION;

So there is a difference between you and

Mr. Kimball?
MR. PRETTYMAN;
QUESTION;

No.

Mr. Kimball said that the congressional

history didn't do him any good at all.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, let me put it to you this way:

Mr. Kimball and I are in slight disagreement on one point only,
as I understand it, and that is I think the congressional his­
tory is crystal clear as I read it.
it is as clear as I do.

Mr. Kimball doss not think

But I do not think that Mr. Kimball

disagrees with -me about point of rest.

I think ha reads the

congressional history in the -and, clear or unclear, as adopting
the point of rest thesis.

21
Now, first, of all, I think it is very important that
th© point: that I was just trying to make, that
i - 3d loa

.

d unlo .

aritime

and that is what they ware talking about, I think it is very
important that that be established.

Let's just take 02?.© sen­

tence from the committe® report, and the Senate and th® House
adopted really virtually the same committee report, and those
committee reports, the significant portions are at the end of
Mr. Kimball's brief, this blue backed brief here, starting in
th© appendix, and he first has the words of the statute and
then on page ii you will see the present act down at the
bottom, and this w© have a very significant statement here,
really the only statement because there was virtually no fleer
debate on this.

We had the only statement as to what Congress

really intended by maritime employment.
It is quite true, Mr. Justice Relinquish, that w®
don't have a definition within the statute itself of maritime
employment.

But I don't think anyone can read these few pages

without it becoming crystal clear what they intended by maritime
employment, namely the loading and unloading process.
For example, they say — now, just listen'to this
sentence:

"The committee does not intend" —
QUESTION:

Where are you, Mr. Pr@tt.yman?

MR. PREWTYM&N:
QUESTION;

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

What page of the blue brief?

22
MR. PRETTYMANs

This would be on page k, ah ihs

very bottom.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

The sentence at the very end.

"The committee doss not intend to cover employees
who are not engaged in loading, unloading, repairing, or build­
ing a vessel, just because they are injured in an area adjoin­
ing navigable waters used for such activity."
Now, if I may interpret that, what they are saying is
you can even meat the situs t ist but you are not covered if you
are not engaged in that loading or unloading process.

I am

emphasizing loading and unloading because obviously the build­
ing of the vessel is not part of the case before the Court.
Now, as to —
QUESTION:

Wall, those employees may be employees of

an employer who doesn't meet the statutory test, too?
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTIGN:

Well ~

That could be a taxi driver from the

streets of Brooklyn who is over there on a pier to pick up a

Everyone has simply assumed that if

you have one or more employees who ara covered, you automatically have your employer.

But X think what this s catenae is

talking about, they are not really talking about a cab driver,
with all due. respect, because they era talking about, somebody
who is injured in this particular area, and 1 think it is clear
throughout this whale paragraph here that when they are talk­
ing about employees they are talking about people who are
employed on the pier to do some type of terminal work.
QUESTION:

The covered employer.

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION;

Yes.

To what extend did the ’72 Act extend

coverage?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

It extended to this extent, Your

Honor, and it substantially extended it.

You remember, during

the ‘72 discussions before Congress, a representative of ILA
got up and said, look, we've got longshoreman who are cut in
half, her© is a man who is injured on th© ship and he is a
longshoreman, doing typical longshoreman's work.

If the same

man happens to be on the pier, he is going on th© pier to do
maybe similar work, ha is not coversd.

We've got a cut in

half situation.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

There are literally

dozens of them.

It is the

It is a 8 69 case# and it is the ana

that holds that you cannot he covered under the *27 Act, you
cannot get compensation if you have an. injury on the pier, even
if it is caused by a pertinence c-f a ship, ©von though you
would fee covered if you war© injured onboard ship.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

That is the Nacirema case.

That was

the case that was cited again and again to the Congress, and
that is precisely the.evil that Congress was attempting to get
at her®.

..It was trying to say that you do have these employeas

who are engaged in the loading or unloading process, right up
to the point of rest of a storage or holding area, and if they
happened -to be on the pier they are not covered, if they happy»
to be on the ship they are.

and that is .what they ware addressing these amendments to.
Now, if I may complete my answer, Mr. Justice
Marshall, the reason that there has been a substantial exten­
sion off coverage is that a great many off the gangs that worhad
ths.se ships increasingly work on shore, and this is particular­
ly true off containers, and Congress specifically noted that in
these last few pagas hers.

They refer specifically to the fact

that containerization has resulted in more and more men working
on the pier, so

MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, I —

A«d the cfchur hat h® wars was whr/.; ha was

doing here.
MR. PRETTYMAN:
QUESTIONS

Mr. Justica —

That, is iu and out. of federal jurisdiction.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

I ss.3 where the difficulty lies, and

I apologize for confusing you.

Wfcsn I began talking about a

checker wearing two hats, I was talking about checkers in
general.

Checkers in general wear two hats in the sense that

they can be doing one of two types of jobs, one at. the ship’s
edge and the other at some distant terminal.

Now, this par­

ticular man was working at the time of injury at the distant
terminal.

We do have evidence that, is part of a proffer that

is not actually proof but part of a proffer that he did spend
on other occasions up to 20 percent of his time on lighters or

on board a ship, but we have no indication of how long ago
this was or what feta precis© nature of that work was, or any­
thing ©Isa.
This man, so far as this record is concerned, was
wearing: the second hat that I was talking about, and was far
removed from the unloading process.

And I would like to point

out to you in that regard that. Ccs.gress specifically said in
fcha report that I was just referring to that checkers ware
covered only if they .were directly involved in ths loading or
unloading process«

Now, that statement, simply makes no sens©

20

if you adopt the view, for example, of the Benefit Review
Board, that it doesn't make

;..y difference wi.-ere. a cr

is

or what he is doing or whether you have a clerical war her ca­
nat.
Let me just give you an -example of the extent to
which the Benefit Review Board has gone, despite these state­
ments in here, there ar© at least eight statements, eight
statements in tha legislative history that I have, just referred
you to which severely qualify th© extension of compensation sr.d
made clear that Congress was not attempting to cover the entire,
terminal or the entire universe.

Despite that, the Benefit

Review Board has said that a temporary delivery clerk who
slipped on ice between th© parking lot and "bit© time clock,
checking it cut, was covered.

They have said that a man who

trips over a beam while returning to a work shack with his
men's time cards is covered.

They have said that a fellow who

injures his back while replacing paper in an IBM machine is
covered.
Mow, if you take those examples — and I want to
emphasis© that the government apparently backs the Benefit
Review Board, they say a number of times in their brief that
they era fully backing than — if you take those statements awl
compare them with

if it happens that a ship is unloaded di­

rectly into a consignee's conveyance, you would say that all

MR. PRETTYMAN:

That is all I wanted to know.
Now, in. the situation analogous to

that, where you hive it unloaded directly to the point of rest
and immediately picked up by the consignee, all the people up

have -

30
QUESTION*

Let'i

oisi

the cargo is unloaded, wsuM the same crews — is it possible
that am seme piers or in some terminals the same crews move it
from the first point of rest into consignee *s conveyance?
MR. PRETTYMANs
Your Honor.

Well, this virtually never happensr

You have a gang which is the unloading gang.

They

are assisted by certain other people who ar© engaged in what wo
call the lozsgshoring operation.

Those people work really as a

unit.
Now, th© only time that I can imagine that what you
are talking about occurs is whan —- let’s say, for example,
everybody is through work at five o’clock and thay are about to
go home and all of a sudden th© stevedoring company says, wait
a minute, we’ve got a crash job over here in th© terminal area,
would you b® willing to take it.
QUESTION:

Now, doe® your client — is your client

responsible for taking, for loading cargo into th© consigns©*s
conveyance?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

E© is responsible for getting them to

— as a terminal operator, h® is responsible for getting them to
th© consignee’s truck.
QUESTION:

Assume that I work for your client, on on®

day could I be assigned to unloading the ship and tfe© next day
assigned to moving cargo to the consignee’s conveyance?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

It is

possible.

Th© more likely

31
thing, what normally happens is that i

: .

part or a

gang, which is normally about 18 people plus drivers, if you
work as part of a gang you even have on the computer runout,
you have a number of your gang, you check the day before to ssa
whether your number is up, and if your gang's number is up ar.fl
you are not sick or something, than you know -that you are to
turn up at a certain ship the nest day and you work that gang
and you work the gang all day.

find then you check the next day

and you normally are going to work with the gang.
QUESTION:

But you might, be part of another gang the

next day?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

You can be, but normally what has

happened is that these gangs have tended to become units and they
tend to work together, and the men change only when there is a
death, retirement, illness or something of that sort.
QUESTION:

But. there is not a different union, is

there?
MR. PRETTYMAN:

Normally the I LA covers everybody on

the terminal, but you. have different locals.

For example, the

checkers, Mr. Blundc was in an entirely separate local, and
normally on most piers the locals are different,

if you are a

terminal operator, than if you are a part of the gang,

find I

want to emphasis® that in terms of even where you have or.© com­
pany like ITL- that dees both stevedoring work and the maritime
work,on their records, in their computer runouts, in their pay

32
seals and all the rest: of it, you are treated compla&ely separately if you are part of the unloading process as opposed to if
you ar® part of the terminal operation, a completely different
operation on the books of that company even though it is the
same company hiring both sets of people.
Now, in terms of th© respondents, -they indicate to us
that there are certain inequities that are going to grow out of
our system

rest.

I will take just a

couple of minutes, because I want to save sens times for rebuttal,
to point out inequities that arise if you adopt their system
rather than ours.
For example, you would have Mr. Caput© covered, and the
truckdriver is doing exactly the same work that he is, is not
covered.

You would have Mr. Bluado covered, but the off-terminal

checker who could fos checking precisely the same container on
another day, and this is dona off-terminal, would not be covered.
YOU —

On account of situs?

MR. PRETTYM&Ni

That’s correct.

You could have Mr.

MR. PRETTYMAN:

Well, thsy would- also c creed©, I think

they would concade,- I am not sure,- I would be interested in
hearing, but I think they would say that the truckdriver does
not meat the status test, period.

But in addition to that you

would have Mr. Blundo and Mr. Caputo both covered but you have
stata workers

and this is something they have never m@ntio&©:1,

have stayed vary carefully away from — but in your terminal
operations-f in. a great number of these docks, you have state
workers doing your terminal operations, and under the statute
they ar© excluded, which is going to give them, if you adopt
their viewpoint, a tremendous cost advantage, of course, hecaus©
they don't have to pay these higher federal benefits.

And they

have said nothing about the fact that you are going t© have state
employees who ar© excluded doing exactly the same work as tha
terminal operators who are covered and an entirely different
system for both.
QUESTION:

War© state employees excluded under the old

Act?
MR. FRETTYMAN:

not sure.

Under the old Act, Your Honor, I am

I just don't know.
And finally, you have strippers and staffers who work

both sides of the terminal, you have consolidatcrs who ar® quits
a difference away from the terminal, stripping and stuffing con­
tainers, and yet only those who happen to be inside th© terminal

34
ars going to b-a covered if you adopt their viewpoint.
Well, I can go on and os with these examples.

Bui;. el u

real inequities and the kind of era ay situations develop
under our theory but they develop under the theory if you try to
extend coverage as far as the government would have you do it.
I would like to save, if possible, the rest of say

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANGELO C. GUCCIARDO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GUCCIARDO:

Mr. chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts

X represent the two injured employees in both of these
cases, Carmelo Bland© and Mr. Capato.
First, before starting my argument, I wish to correct
certain misconceptions that have already been put forth to you,
and namely it is this, that the way of life on the waterfront is
that it is a shape job.

Even though you may have a regular

employer or be a member of a regular gang, you have to report
in the New York and Maw Jersey area to a hiring hall that is
maintained by the Waterfront Commission, and then you ar© sent,
out to work wherever work is available.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gucci ardo-, Mr. Prettyman has given us

some conception of his ideas of how the waterfront works, you

35
ar© now giving us some of yours.

I don't know that; either of

you would qualify as an expert witness if this war© in a trial
court.

If there are disputes between the two of you, whose

word ar© we to take, as to the practices?
MR. GUCCIARDOs
a family of longshoremen.

Your Honor, I state this:

I com© from

I have been in this business since

1953, handling longshore work almost regularly from 1953 up
until the present time.

I am familiar with the waterfront.

So a longshoreman gets hired and ha goes to his hiring
boss.

If he is hired as terminal labor, his duties ar© a number

of categories.

That is, ha can load and unload a lighter, which,

is a float, he can load and unload ship stores os, a ship, load
and unload containers and load and unload trucks.

He doesn't

know in advance when hs gats to that pier exactly whore he is
going to be assigned.

That is Mr. Caputo for you.

When he gets

thsre in the morning, even though he may be a regular employee,
h© may go ©aboard a lighter to unload a lighter.

This is the

walking in and out of federal jurisdiction that Congress intended
to correct.
Hof; only that;

if he is assigned in the morning t©

unload a lighter and that work is finished, and tha lighter is
finished, his extra labor boss may then say unload the trucks
that are delivering cargo that have to be put onboard a vessel.
The same way with the checker.

The checker does not know in

advance each day where fes will be assigned.

He reports to his

36
boss who is incidentally th® semi© labor boss, and he tails him
where to g© and what to do.
ITL was involved in this case, in Blundo.
QUESTION?

Mr. Gucciardo, could I just ask yon on©

question before you get too deeply into your argument*

Under

your theory of the statute, supposing Mr. Caputo took his wife
to the movies and after the shew they decided to walk across
the piar where he normally works and he fell and was injured,
would he be covered?
MR. GUCCIARDO:

No, sir.

Under that theory, fee is

QUESTION:

But then do you contend -chat his status

at, the time of the injury is controlling?
MR. GUCCIARDO:
QUESTIONS

That is correct.

The fact that he is generally a longshore­

man is irrelevant?
MR. GUCCIARDOs

No, that is material, Your Honor.

He

is generally a longshoreman but you also hav© to bs in the
course of employment to have a compensable injury.

You cannot,

for example, quit at. five o'clock and decide to come back be­
cause a friend of yours is working and you want to meat with
him so you can go home together.

You may have the same thought.

Well, after you have quit and you are waiting for your friend
who may work an hour overtime, which happens, and get hurt, he

37
is not; covered.
QUESTION:

Is. the reason he .is not covered because of

something in section 2(4} or something in section 3(a)?

What

is fehs reason under the statute that he is not covered?
MR. GUCC.IARDO:

Because he is not in the course of

employment at fell® feim® of the accident,
QUESTIONS

Where doss the statute require that?

MR. GUCCIARDOs

This is general compensation law.

In

order for an accident to be compensable, you must be in the
course of employment, people working for their employer in
furtherance of their employer’s activity,
QUESTION?

I understand that general compensation.

Does this tatute contain a similar requirement and, if so, in
what section?

Do you know?

MR. GUCCIARDOs
QUESTION:

Ho.

And if you don’t know —

MR. GUCCIARDOs

I am not aware of any particular

statute dealing with that particular point.
QUESTION:

So we have to go outside the written

language ©f the statute to find the limitation yen have just
described?
MR. GUCCIARDOs

Yes, because when Congress says that

covered as compensation cases, them you refer to compensation
law, asid that is what the mitiiak- is mad© in dealing with these
cases.

They are citing a. lot cl oases involving unseaworthiness.

38
Well, longshoremen who ara looking feo establish t
on th® part of the ship .have to establish that they are in the
service of the ship on the theory of unse&wcrthiness.

That lias

nothing to do with compensation law.
QUESTION?

Wall, you aren't even an employee if you

ara off work, are you?
MR. gucciardo:

That is correct.

You are not an

employe© —
QUESTION;

And you aren't engaged in maritime employ­

ment if you aren’t working?
MR. GUCCIARDG;

That is correct.

You might just as

wall be a walker in th© street..
QUESTIONS

Well, that is just plain — isn't that in

section 2 then, section 2(3), the term "employa©"?

You aren't

even an employ®© if you are not on duty, are you?
MR. GUCCIARDO:

That's correct.

You are not an em­

ploye© , and I would say that under that term, section 2(3}
i

encompasses that meaning, meaning the person engaged in mari­
time employment.

if this person has to go to the bathroom and sustains an
accident in the bathroom on the employer's premises, of

course, or if h© is checking out and has to punch out, which
is the Jackson case in the Fifth Circuit, that employee should
b© covered.
I take issue with the Jackson case as decided by the
Fifth Circuit, because the man was working all day long within

out, for that purpose h@ is covered under state law?

The only reason that the justices in that particular

case decided that way because the ®iployers and the carriers
would have us put blinders on and say he has got to b© doing
something in maritime employment at the time.
QUESTION:

That is not so.

Well, under your theory the man starts

cut doing maritime employment on the dock in the morning and is
asked to drive a truck ten miles away at noon to take some of
the stuff, comes back and has an accident while he is driving
the truck, lie is covered.
MR. GUCCIARDO:

That is not what happens on the

waterfront.
QUESTION:

Well, if that did happen on the waterfront,

would ho or would he not be covered under your theory?

40
MR. GUCCIARDO:

Th® purossss far which h© is MR'©

driving that track would have to ba examined.
QUESTION:

But ha could be?

MR. GUCCIARDO:
where that has cant® about.

Yes, ha could b®, and I will tell you
Thera was the Stiff id i case which

was involved in the Dal'laveatura case, which was dismissed for
technicalities.

In that particular case, an employer had bean

moving — the Pittston stevedoring Company had bsea moving its
pier from one location to another, which was within ten blocks.
So rather than hire private trucking for all of the existing
cargo that was remaining on Pier 10 to go to the stats pior or
Pier 12 — I don't remember the number of the pis;: — they used
their own drivers to go across city streets and within the
terminal.
In the Stiffidi case, of course, he was injured after
h@ got inside of the terminal and was opening the container for
the purposes of r«stuffing them into another container.

So

that the Administrative Law Judge held that to be compensable
and the Benefits Review Board also held it to be compensable.
But taking your example, if he had been hurt between
Pier 10 and Pier 12,

I would say under those particular sat of

circumstances that h© would also be covered under the Act.

Is he covered or not

MR. GUCCIARDOs

There is a provision of the law which

says, under th© compensation law, if you abandon your employ­
ment and are injured while abandoning employment, then you are
not covered.

I could give

you & similar ©scampie perhaps if you are being disturbed by
that particular point wher© 1 did hav© a case involving a
longshoreman who was told by -th© boss, now you go pick up the
pay of all the men who worked on pier so and so during the
week.

Because it is a shape job, they have to go to the vari­

ous piers to pick up their salary, so if the boss gives him
time off with pay -- that is very crucial, that with pay —
and ha goes to pick up that pay of all his employees for that
particular gang and brings it back, that is also compensable
under the law, because they are traveling the waterfront and
this is accepted procedure between terminal operators and the
Internatiosial Longshoremen's Association, that on® man go to
pick up the pay for all of the men.

QUSSTIOMs

Thank you.

MR. GUCClARDOs

I wanted to make a point that section

920, which deals with presumptions, should bs continued to ba
enforced-i

The average longshoreman cannot afford proceedings

to prosecute these cases.

All of th® costs of these proceedings

ar® born® by me personally and my firm, of course.
So that the purpose of the law was that th© burden of
proof should be on th© employers and their carriers, because
they were best able to sustain the cost of prosecuting these
claims.
All a person has to do who is injured on the water­
front is to say I am a longshoreman, I was working on th© job
and I got hurt, and my employer engaged longshoremen to work on
th® ship and on the piers.

Now the burden is on the employer

and carrier to come forth and disprove ‘that claim.
You will notice in both of these cases — in the
Caput© case they presented no evidence whatsoever.

In the

Blundo case, thay attempted to present some evidence in th®
farm of a safety man whose knowledge of the facts seemed to be
faulty.

But in any event, there is no proof to the contrary

offered in any record that this does not fall within the pre­
sumption of the Act? also th© other phase of the law, which

44
says that if thera are serious questions of. feet :ln law, teen
it. is to ba resolved in favor of th© claimant.
this what is occurring here now?

Wall, isn’t

Thar© is a serious question

of fact in law, and if that is truly bothering you, gentlemen,
that has to ba resolved in favor of th® claimant because that
is what the law has bean for many, many years.
Another misconception -- I am sorry to jump bade and
forth, but my adversary Mr. Prettyman says that it almost never
happens that ships are unloaded directly.

It happens quite

often and happens in two instances that I know ©f — banana
ships and frozen cargo.

They are perishable items.

So that if

that has to be unloaded, the same longshoremen, Mr. Caputo and
Mr. Blundo, are used in a direct line from th® ship directly
into th© consignee’s truck.

They have to us© th® longshoremen

to load their trucks because they require special heavy equip­
ment such as hi-los, dollies and manual labor to put it into
th© truck, a truckman can’t possibly carry all ‘this equipment
with him.

It is recognized on th© waterfront that this is th©

way it has to ba dona.
Th© only reason that th© truckman participates is
otherwise the employer would be paying him to do nothing and
watch then truck being loaded, so ha tells him you have to help.
Th© word "transshipment** used by the committee re­
ports in the House and in the Senate meant exactly that.
employer doesn't transship within his own terminal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRANK H. EASTERBROOK,ESQ.,
Hr'

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it,

pleas© the Court:
It is the position of th® Department of Labor -chat
the amended Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers Compensation Act
applies to all injuries suffered by waterfront workers during
th® process of transferring cargo between lard and water trans­
portation.
it is a simpla rule, easily applied, and we believe
that it correctly defines th© meaning of th® statute,
QUESTIONS

Mr. Easterbrook,

just so I am sure of your

position, if I read your brief correctly, it is the government's
position that ths example I gave of a nan returning from the
vie and walking across th© pier, fee would be covered, am I
right?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

It is the government's, position

46

that it: would not be covered , and the reason for
have to do with his status as an

pi

the test established in section 2(2) of

v.

It has to ho with

the statute, which is

not reprinted in any of the briefs.

QUESTION:

I tried to find it in —

MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Section 2(2) —

Section 902(2).

Right.

MR. EASTERBROOK:

That section requires that the in­

jury have arisen out of the course of employment.

That would

not fee met in the cas© of the injury in year hypothetical, Mr.
Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

What about my friend who is going up to

get the cigarettes, in your view, in the government's view?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Assuming that he is moving away

from the waterfront, Your Honor, in that event coverag© is ex­
cluded by the situs rule of the statute, section 3 (a) or
section 903 (a).

He too is not covered.

QUESTION:

What about transshipment, where it moves

from — it canes off the ship from Dock A, it is moved to Dock
Bf to Dock C and Dock D, and th© man has moved it on Dock X, is
h© covered?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Yea, Your Honor, in our view he is

covered and indeed that is very similar to th© Blundo case wa

47
have here.
QUESTION:

Wall, would that be if it was six months

later?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

in our view him© has nothing to do

with it# and I would like to develop for a moment, if I might,
what we believe is the correct test of coverage.
The statute establishes on its face the test that,
as Judge Friendly pointed out, can b© satisfied in three ways;

A worker is covered if ha is a longshoreman, or if he is en­
gaged in longs boring operations, or if ha otherwise meets the
test of maritime employment.
It is clear that unless Congress was wasting words,
some parsons are covered -Even though they are not injured at a
moment whan they are engaged in any long shoring operations..
QUESTIONs
2(3), is it?

Well, that is not a necessary reading of

If you take the phrase "including any longshore­

man or other person engaged in longshoring operations,55 it is
certainly possible as a matter of usage to read "engaged in
long shoring operations'* as modifying the word "longshoreman*
as well as ether person, ” is it not?'
MR. EASTERBROOK;

It. is conceivable that that is

correct, Mr. Justice Rehnguist, although wa don’t believe that
that is the best reading of the statute.

But it seems toler­

ably clear that the focus of the statute was upon the occupa­
tion of the worker.

The description of longshoreman art the

tion of th© occupations in which persons engage on 44e va4..::: frost -- long s hear eras n , harbor worker, ship repairman,

it is a

focus on occupations, rather than a focus on par Ocular tasks
at the moment of the injury, and that, focus on occasion rather
than on tasks

at the monent of injury is sufficiant to doom

petitioners' theories and arguments.
Th© occupation of longshoreman traditionally has
been understood to include a wide variety of waterfront tasks.
In Victory Carriers v. Law, for example, this Court used longshoremen in that generic sens© to include persons who carry out
most tasks on the waterfront.

And there is no reason to suppose

that Congress, which enacted this statute only a few months
later and in some measure in response to this Court's decision
in Victory Carriers and Nacireiaa

Operating Company, was using

longshoremen in some more narrow sens©.
All of this too must be considered against th© fact
that a maritime carrier employs stevedore contractors and
marine terminal operators like petitioners to carry out its
duty to make cargo available to consignees.
time.

The task is mari­

It is the marine carrier who engages petitioners to

carry out tasks on its behalf, and it pays for their services.
Ths ultimate responsibility is that of the marine carrier.

The

petitioners act on their behalf.

We have discussed this duty at pages 27 to 28 of our

43

brief# and this has caused some difference of view# 1 tliirk,
between the two petitioners.
Petitioner

Northeast concedes at pages 18 and 19

of its- brief that this duty exists and that tha coverage of
the Act therefore continues until the marine terminal car the
stevedore contractor has carried out that duty of making cargo
available.
Sines Bluado was injured before the cargo was made
available, under tha test advocated by Petitioner Northeast,
Blundo would fee covered by the Act.

Petitioners* contrary

arguments take us a long way from the statute•
Petitioners practically ignore the statute’s plain
words.

Counsel for petitioners were not talking about long­

shoremen and longshoring operations during their oral argument.
They ware talking instead about loading and unloading, words
that do not appear in the statute.
Tha words loading and unloading have com® from the
legislative history of the statute, and petitioners suggest
that this, rather than longshoremen and longshoring operations,
is tha proper test of coverage,
QUESTIONi

Do you suggest, Mr. Easterbrook, that

this statute is so clear that we need not resort to legislative
history?
MR. EASTERBROOKs

No, Your Honor, it is not and wc

think to resort to the legislative history is —

It, is about as uscloor es any statute

Or perhaps you could conceit,a

of on© more so?
MR. E&STERBROOKs

It leaves something to h© desired.

I think that the roost important part that wa draw from the
face of th© statute is its focus on occasions rather than
tasks, and I think that is very important to th© argument? be­
cause petitioners have tried in order to manufacture a racraent
of injury test to shift the focus to tasks rather than occupa­
tions .
In any event, petitioners —

They did mention th® fact that you walk

in and out of federal jurisdiction?
MR. EASTERBROOKs

That is very strongly mentioned in

th© legislative history»
QUESTION:

That is ths same thing.

MR. EASTERBROOKs

Your Honor„ l believe that it is

terribly important that Congress focused on walking in and out
of th® coverage of the statute.

The question presented in

this case is in large measure where they walk in and out of
that coverage.

It used to be before the 1972 amendments that

they walked in and out of that coverage at th© water’s edg©,
right smack at the edge of th© water, and that is what this
Court held in Nacirema Operating Co. and Victory Carriers v.
Law.

That is where the dividing line was.
What petitioners propose to do is to move that di­

viding line inland to the point of rest and then any longshore­
man who walks back and forth from on® side of th© point of
r©st walks in and out of federal coverage just like before,
only h© walks in and out of federal coverage at a different

place.
QUESTION:

But isn't there another difforcr.ee, Mr.

Easter brook, that under the old view he walked in and out of

52
coverage during the

day, regularly, whereas keecs he is

pretty much in or out fc

ae?

MR. EASTERBRGGK:

Your Honor, we believe that that

argument is inconsistent with the record.

Mr. Capa to testified

that during times when he was assigned to the terminal labor
category* as he was assigned to the terminal labor category on
the day he was injured* h© spent approximately 20 percent of
his time on th© water.

He further testified in the record of

this case

record.

It was not broken down in th©

H© testified further that if he had succeeded in load­

ing the truck, which ha was doing whan he was injured, his very
next assignment could have baen on the water, and that within
days h© worked on th© water sometimes and at other assignments
at other times.
Mr. Blundo testified similarly.
in as part of an offer of proof.

That testimony cam®

Th© reason it was an offer

of proof, rather than ordinary evidence in this cas®, was that
counsel for Petitioner ITL objected on the grounds that the
testimony was irrelevant.
QUESTIONs

Well, la it your view of th® record that

it supports th® notion that it is quite frequently true that
employees work on both sides of th© poij

' rest during the

53
saai?D day?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Both longshoremen in this case

testified that they themselves worked on both sides of the
pois.it of rest, in the same day .
QUESTION*

Wall, that really wasn't my question.

Do

you think the record fairly supports the view that employees
typically work oa both sides of th© point of rest on the same
day?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

There is no testimony ia th©

record concerning that from anyone other than the two respon­
dents , and they testified that that was true.
QUESTION:

Do you think wa can taka judicial notice

of th© material in the brief that has this kind of a Brandeis
brief on where the point of rest is?

That seams to support th®

contrary view, as I read it.

I ss® no reason why you can't take it for whatever it

is worth, with th© understanding that it was written, by an

QUESTION:

And Judge Friendly, of course, pointed out

his difficulty was that we didn’t have those facts before us,
and h© in effect suggested that he might hav© viewed th®-cas©
differently if they had been before him.

QUESTION:

MR. EASTERBROOKs

Our point is that it makes not

very much difference whether a lot of people walk back and
forth from on® side of th® point of rest to another.

Our point

is that it shouldn’t b© that kind of dividing line of coverage
exists at all, no matter how many people are walking back and
forth.
QUESTION:

Well, Judge Friendly, in his opinion for

th® Court of Appaals for the. Second Circuit, laid a good deal
of store by the fact that on© or more of these employees at
least at. other times and on other days had worked in employ­
ment that would be clearly covered.

Do you think — how im­

portant is that, in your view?

At a minimum, it dispositive in

these cases before it indicates that 'these respondents meet

QUESTIONs

In repairing the truck?

MR. EASTERBROOKs
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, h© would.

Mr. Easherbrook, I would have 'thought, in

kind of an indefinite a statute as this that one of the argu­
ments against the point of rest theory would be its adminis­
trative difficulty that you would have constant factual disputes .
But I frankly gather from your answer to Mr. Justice Marshall's
question that we would be engaged in very much the same kind of
disputes if wa followed your theory.
MR. EASTERBROOKs

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

I

think we could ask a very simpel question, that the board asks.
The board asks two kinds of question.

One is did -this injury

occur on the waterfront, at a place satisfying site status.
That is ordinarily determined relatively clearly.

The second

question of question 1h@ board asked is whether this person is
a parson who devotes his life to waterfront activities suf­
ficient to make him a longshoreman.

At that point we don't

cars whether he was at the moment of his injury doing, things
that ware traditionally thought of as longshoremen work.

It is

another — the board's test is a means of excluding a vary
broad category' of inquiries that petitioners would have you
undertake.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, what do you -think Congress,

the committe® meant when they said the committee does not ihte
—• doss not intend

59
loading, unloading, a:-: .3 then

sob©

irrelevant words., just bs~

cause they are injured in an arsa adjoining navigable waters
used for such activity?
MR, EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe —

What you have just said is diametrically

contrary to that.
MR. EASTERBROOK;

I dor.st believe so.

I believe the

key to understanding that, sentence is the clause baginning
"Just because.”

It is not. enough that they simply b© injured

in maritime situs.

They have to have something more.

They

have t© be engaged in the career of being a longshoreman or in
longshoring activities, just because they ar© in the situs
they don't qualify.

But if they are a longshoreman, that is

a different reason for qualifying under the Act other than
loading and unloading.
But I would like to point out something else about
that, it is something that drew some comment, comment by Mr.
Justice Rehnquist earlier, that, part of this was tautilogical.
The sentence in the committee report says that the
committee does not intend to cover employees who ar© not en­
gaged in loading and unloading.

Under section 2(3} of the

statute, no one is an employee unless he is engaged in maritime
employment, longshoremen, longshore operations, and. so on.
If you read the word "employes” in tha legislative
history together with its us© in the statute, the committee must

60
■

already <

qualified because they ax

.

»ngshoremen perhaps,

thatf that entire sentence fcacomes less than perfectly accu­
rate, because then the committee is saying wa do not intend to
cover employees who are under section 2(3) covered, and that
clearly isn’t right.
Perhaps it indicatas that tbs sentence was written
with less than precis® attention to detail.

But in any event,

the explanation I just gave to you, Mr. Chief Justice, is wa
believe the correct interpretation of the statuta.

The just

because clause is referring to what the situs requirement iff
all about and not to a status requirement.
QUESTION:

Mr. Easterbrook, is another way of saying

the same thing that you don't really read the word "employees”
in that sentence as being used in the statutory definition, is
that correct?
MR. EASTERBROOK:
QUESTION:

No, wb don't, and indeed —

And an employer may not be a covered

employer?
MR. EASTERbrooks

Well, in part that is tantilogleal,

too, because an employer is covered as an employer if ha has
any employees.
QUESTION s

But this might not *— the use of

■

nica]

how it is defined in the statute.

SI
MR. EASTERBROOK:

I ';,hiak that probably is not the

technical use as defined in the statute, and. that is a, problem
that infects this committee report considerably.

There is a

slide back and forth in many places in the committee report
between technical language as defined in the statute and lay
language, and it makes it very difficult to read the committes
report side by side with the statute in good sense.
The point of rest test is in many ways highly arti­
ficial.

In order to demonstrate this, I have taken some ex­

amples from a book compiled by the National Association of
Stevedores, one that has been submitted to this Court.
In Philadelphia, the point of rest is the very first
resting place after cargo has left the ship's tackle.

In

other words, where it is dropped by the ship’s tackle is the
point of rest, exdept for container vessels at Packer Avenue
where the point of rest is in. a marshalling yard.
In Boston, the point of rest is in sheds next to the
pier.

The cargo is picked up and dropped in several places

before it gets to the point of rest where it stops waiting for
someone to pick it up.
In Wilmington, North Carolina, th® point of rest is
seaward of the real resting point.

It is, in other words, at

one of the intermediate stops, and there is a different inter­
mediate point used for break-bulk cargo and container cargo.
In Hampton Reads, Virginia, the point of rest, is a

62
hundred feet forward of the bow and a hundred feet; aft rf

-he

stern of the vessel.
QUESTION:

What definition are you taking of point

of rest for these comments?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

My point was there is no defini­

tion of point of rest, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But you are using it. in statements to us.

You saying that it occurs a hundred feet such and such.

What

definition ar® you taking, even though you may disagree, with
it?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

I am using th® statement of the

National Association of Stevedores as to what, it means, what
definition they have used to come up with these lines is quits
beyond me.

I do not know.

My point is that the same words

mean different things in different ports, and my suggestion is
that perhaps it doesn't mean anything at all.
QUESTION:

Do any of these definitions bind any coart­

or any board?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

I don't believe so, but what I was

trying —

Then what is the relevance?

that is —
QUESTION:

Could not a court make its own definition?

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Yes, it could but at that point the

question becomes wide.
QUESTION:

By making its own definition, I mean mak­

MR. EASTERBROOK:

that —

tion.

That is also a conceivable defini­

It is on© that is used apparently in Philadelphia.

But

the problem with that and one that is overriding in the legis­
lative history is that that would create the same sort of

likewise.

Blundo did

Both men could have been assigned to tasks on the

water immediately after completing the tasks on which they
were injured.

Both men therefore spent part of their time do­

ing tasks covered even under petitioners’ interpretation of the
statute.

Both congressional committees wrote, a portion of

the. legislative history appearing at page iv of the appendix
in the blue brief, that the statute would "permit a uniform
compensation system to apply to employees who would otherwise
be, covered by this Act for part of their activity."

That in­

deed explains why the Act is written in terms of covered occu­
pations, rather than in terms of covered

QUESTION:

Mr. Easter brook, is there any support, for

the notion that the terra "maritima euployment" has sort of a
historical significance and refers to the kind of work that
years ago was done by people who want down to the ssa in ships
and so forth?
MR. EASTERBROOK:

Your Honor, the term "maritime

employment" has a long history in the law of admiralty.

I think

it is quite clear that th© statutory term "maritime employment"
doesn't mean th© admiralty word "maritime employmentt" and the
clearest example of that is the coverage of shipbuilders.

In

the lav; of admiralty, shipbuilders were not engaged in. maritime
employment.

But under the statute —

MR. EASTERBROOK:

Maritime employment, including

shipbuilders.

and the other is the harbor worker category.

Do you think that is a permissible reading

grammatically?
MR. EASTERBROOK;
question:

It would be.

Isn’t it also supported by the fact that

additionally the harbor worker was not in maritiia© ©mplovTaesfe,
as you point cut in your own footnote?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

It would be, with oss exception.

The section-by-section description of that section in both the
Senate and House committee reports makes it clear that there is
only a single test for maritime employment, and everything else
in that section is viewed as a subset of .-that, single test, and
that is in the section-by-section description.
QUESTION;

Is that part of the legislative history

any clearer than the paragraph about loading and unloading?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

It is, I think.

It is at page 15

of the Senate committe® report.
QUESTION;

And would apply to a dock worker who never

pat his foot on a ship?

HR. EfisST'ESlBROOK;

Yes, Your Hos-sr.

Ultimately the

Perhaps there

To the ©xtaat that there isr w® be­

lieve that they are entitled to the assistance of three time
tested principles:

Ons, the presumption of coverage in section

20(a) of the statute; two, the rule of liberal construction for
remedial statutes.

And the presumption of coverage in this

statute indicates that this is one of those statutes.

tad,

•three, the deference due to the agancy charged with the admin­
istration of the statute.

These principies means at; the minimum that; uncer­

no more than uncertainty.

Petitioners’ arguments raise

They harp upon ambiguities and they

offer plausible tests to resolve those ambiguities.

But the

board too has offered a plausible test to resolve any ambigui­
ties.

Its test is more in harmony with the statute and. its

legislative history, and we believe that the awards in this
case were proper.
QUESTION;

Mr. Easter brook, is the government's po­

sition entirely consistent with the opinion of the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit?
MR. EASTERBROOK;

No, it. is not, Your Honor.

Th©

test of coverage that the Benefits Review Board has constructed
is somewhat more expansive than the test articulated by Judge
Friendly.
QUESTION;

So you support the position of th® board?

MR. EASTERBROOK;

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Prettyman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER, INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL
OPERATING COMPANY, INC. ~ REBUTTAL
MR. PRETTYMAN;
it please the Court;

A few brief points in rebuttal, if

First of all, I do not know of a single decision of
the Benefits Review Board that has

k

;

I compensation to any

clerical worker of any kind who was injured.

And I now under­

stand the government to be fully supporting the position of the
Benefits Review Board.

You will notice in their brief there

was some confusion there because they war© talking about the
people who physically handled cargo.

They apparently now have

abandoned that requirements anyone who is on the terminal
working and employed is going to ba covered.
Number two, the government shows seme complexity
about point of rest.

On® of the respondents in these cases is

the Director of the Office of Workers Compensation Programs of
the Department of Labor.

He is a respondent in this case.

That very office issued a report just last December.

The

government has never referred to that report in its breifs,
although we referred to it and quoted it in our briefs.
It is interesting that in that report there doesn’t
seem to ba any confusion about point of rest because the
Department of Labor there says that the respondent in this case
there says, and I quote, "The marina terminal operator is re­
sponsible for all movement and handling of the ship8s cargo
between the point of rest and any place on the marins terminal
property except shipside ."

And the respondent in this

cbsq

also says stevedoring operations are confined to the area be­
tween the ship and the terminal area called point of rest.

71
So I suggest to yen that when Mr. Justice Rshaquist
asks which of the attorneys w-a should listen to as to the
difficulties of the case and the phrases and so forth, I sug­
gest that we should listen at least in this regard to the
respondent who carta inly is an expert as to what the point of
rest is, Mr. Easterbrook.
And I might say incidentally as to point of rest,
f

you do not go back and forth across the point of rest as has
been described in oral argument, because wa are talking about
a function here and not a geographical point.

If a man is en­

gaged in loading and unloading process, if he is part of the
gan, for example, it makes no difference whether ha walks
back and forth on the other side of the marshalling area or
not.

If he is engaged in the unloading process by way of ex­

ample, he is covered.
Now, the exact point of physical point of rest may
in fact change from terminal to terminal or yard to yard, as
the government has suggested, but it doesn't make any differ­
ence because in each yard, at. each terminal the point is exactly
fixed and, believe me, there is no confusion at each place as
to exactly where* the point of rest is, as he has described
himself using those examples.

It doesn't make'any difference

that geographically it may be different in Los Angeles than it
is in New York if in fact it is fixed in each place, and
everyone knows where it is.

Arsd let me just finally say that I think the state­
ment was mad© that loading and unloading was not, specifically
referred to in the statute.

If that was said, I refer you to

section 2(4) where it. is referred to, section 3 (a) where it is
referred to, and four times during the reports that I have
repeatedly referred to they specifically talk about the load­
ing and unloading function.
Thank you very much.
MR.

chief

JUSTICE BURGER:
