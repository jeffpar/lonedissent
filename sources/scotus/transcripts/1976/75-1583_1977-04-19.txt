MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will resume argument

Mr. Bell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL T. BELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES — Resumed
MR. BELL;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
We are astonished that anyone could come into
this Court and suggest, as we understood counsel yesterday
to suggest, first, that South Carolina is deliberately
evading the provisions of Section 5 of the Voting Rights
Act in this case, and second, that the Attorney General, in
1972, did not look at the submission, of our Senate plan.
We believe that both of these suggestions are
flatly contradicted by the record in this case.

It’s been

said that after the objection was entered pursuant to court
order Harper v. Levi in 1973, that South Carolina has
continued to enforce its plan, rather than coining up with
a new reapportionment, or submitting to the District Court
of the District of Columbia an action seeking a declaratory
judgment that the plan is enforceable.
How, of course, from 1973 until the commencement
of this suit, the judgment of that District Court was in
litigation.

It was appealed by the United States to the

Court of Appeals,

Judge Greane, in her District Court

38
order, specifically said that the order was without
prejudice to any aright of appeal on the issue, and so we
fail to see how that constitutes bad faith or evasion on
our part.
We feel also that the record of South Carolina’s
compliance with the Voting Rights Act since its inception
should dispel the notion that there's any bad faith or
evasion on our part in this case.
We promptly submitted this plan.

We mailed it off

three days after the Governor signed it into law, which is,
I think, a very prompt compliance in 1972.

South Carolina

has always complied with the Voting Rights Act.

We’re

quite proud that we are the only covered jurisdiction, and
this Court has judicially noticed, in Perkins v. Matthews,
that we're the only covered jurisdiction that has rigorously
and faithfully complied with the Section 5 pre-clearance
provision since the beginning.

We did so in this case.

The

Attorney General determined that our submission was complete,
which we think was his determination to make.

We think that

this Court clearly said that in Georgia v. United States.

And

so we fail to see where the evasion is on our part, where is
our bad faith.
In. fact* we feel that the record indicates the
opposite.
Wow, the record also shows that the Attorney Genera].

39

did look at our submission*

All of the testimony in the

record, all of the evidence in the record, points in that
direction.

There's nothing to indicate that agency action

was withheld, which was repeatedly suggested yesterday.
Quite obviously, agency action was not withheld.
The Attorney General received the submission? he reviewed
the submission? he reviewed the plan? and he acted.
It * s because he acted, and not because he failed
to act, that we have this lawsuit*

The plaintiffs disagree

with that action, but it simply is not plausible to claim
that he did not look at the plan, or that he totally
withheld agency action, ox* that he didn't review it at all.
So that's not the case we're arguing here.
It's a case in which the Attorney General did
receive the submission.

If there's any question about that,

I think it's dispelled by looking at the memorandum he filed
with the District Court a year later, in which he said, we
have again reviewed this submission, and we find that our
decision there was sound.

That's the same letter in which

he went on to say that the plan had a substantial racial
effect..

But ha starts that memorandum by saying, we have

reviewed all of this again.
reviewed it once before.

That indicates that he had

And he said we reached the same

conclusion, that that conclusion was sound.
QUESTION:

That letter is an appendix hare somewhere,

40
isn’t it?
MR. BELLs

Yes.

QUESTION:

I remember seeing it.

MR. BELL:

Mr. Justice Stewart, you find that

letter is on page — it’s in the Appendix starting at page
51 — I'm sorry, that8s the objection letter.

The memorandum

which I'm referring to is reprinted in the red brief, the
red brief, In the appendix there.
on page? 4A of that Appendix.

You’ll find that begins

And the language I’m referring

to is in the: first paragraph of that memorandum.

He says

there, we have again examined our files to determine whether
the conclusion reached and the reasons for that decision
are sound.

We conclude again that they were.
So we think

we think that the record, the facts

in this case, simply do not support most of the arguments
that ware being made yesterday in that regard.
It seems to me that to adopt the position which
was urged before the Court yesterday is quite clearly going to
create significant problems.

If the Court decides that

review under the Administrative Procedures Act is permitted,
I think yesterday's argument gave us a good foreshadowing
of what's going to happen.

We’re going to have a host of

collateral issues being raised in lawsuits on this matter.
All of these will have to be resolved in future litigation.
I don't think those issues are ripe for adjudication in this

41
Court today»

They will have to be resolved in collateral

suits in the future.

Some of the issues that were raised

in questioning yesterday are very difficult issues.
Who can seek review?
submitting authority?

Both?

Private parties?

The

Can private parties seek

review of objections as wall as non-objections?

And I

think the difficulty of that question is shown by the fact
that the private parties and the United States disagreed on
it.

Mr. Wollenberg said private parties cannot; Mr. Turner

said they can if there is some fundamental error that led to
the objection.

That's a difficult question which would have

to foe resolved.
QUESTION:

Suppose the Attorney General does not

object, or suppose he specifically says he is not going
to object.

And he says he’s carefully reviev/ed the plan,

and the State statute goes into effect.

May a party -- may

a private party then bring an independent suit to enjoin the
operation of the statute, not on constitutional grounds, but
on the. grounds that it does not comply with Section 5?
MR. BELL:
clear answer to that.
QUESTION j

I think the Act itself does not give a
Obviously the Act says —
Rave there been some decisions •— have

there been some attempts at private stilts to enjoin -MR. BELLs

I think the problem, and I think it's a

significant problem, there are certainly reasons why private

42
parties should be allowed in certain circumstances to
litigate that issue.

I think the way that has been

handled so far, and it seems to be something that is
acceptable to Congress, because Congress has not changed the
Act —
QUESTION:

Well, it5s really a question of whether

—- is to have a liberal rule of

intervention.

Now, private parties have intervened ■—

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but there's no place to

intervene, if the Attorney General doesn't enter his objection
MR. BEL.L:

You're quite right, because you're speak­

ing of the case in which he says, I enter no objection.
QUESTION:

I had thought that

I had thought the

rule —* I had just assumed, I suppose, the rule in the
statute was that private suits were not permitted, that if —
that after s. statute want into effect., a private party was
remitted to his constitutional remedies.
MR. BELL:

Yes, in the case that you're speaking

of, Mr. Justice White, I —
QUESTION:

Well, are there some decisions that

say that once *—
MR. BELL:

Yes, I think that the Allen ~ the Allen

decision of this Court says precisely that.

It says once

the State has obtained successful pre"Clearance, the only

43
remedy parties have is to bring the subsequent content on the
merits.

There is no -QUESTION:

Yeah, but on what merits?

MR. BELL:

On the merits of the plan.

QUESTION:

Well, I know; you mean on the

That Is —

constifutional grounds?
MR. BELL:

Yes, on the constitutional merits.

QUESTION:

Assume the statutory standard is more

stringent than the constitutional standard: my question
really asks 7 may a private part bring a private suit to
enforce the statutory standard?
MR. BELL:

I think Congress has indicated that the

constitutional merits are then to be reached; that the
purposes of Section 5 have been accomplished.
QUESTION:

Well, they should then be reached, but

is there sons authority for saying that Congress did not
intend a private suit such as I described?
MR. BELL:

I think the language in the Allen case

is the best indication of that.
QUESTION:
suggesting

Well, isn't that some argument for

isn't that an argument against allowing review?

MR. BELL:

I think quite clearly it is.

QUESTION:

Well, I would have supposed you would

have made that argument.
MR. BELL:

Well, if I haven't, I hope I'm making it

44
now,
QUESTION:

I mean if Congress didn’t intend —*

intended to bar private parties from bringing independent suits
to enjoin on the basis of the statutory standard, it would
seem odd that it allowed-- that it would allow review at the
behest of purely private parties.
MR. BELL:

Yes, I think if we look at the scheme of

Section 5, and see how it relates to the traditional
constitutional suit,

we begin to get some insight into that

question.
Now, the reason Section 5 was enacted, and I think
this irs quite clear, is because traditional suits were con­
sidered not to be an adequate remedy.
considered to be an adequate remedy?

But why weren’t they
There was a very

•;

specific problem that Congress was addressing.

£

It was a pr«..c

fcice which they had seen occur, and in some states in the
South, on a massive basis, of undercutting successful
Fifteenth Amendment litigation.

Private parties would have

a voting qualification stricken as unconstitutional, they
would win their case, and the State would react by changing
the qualification,

So that there had to be new litigation.

Not*/ pre-clearance and the suspension effect of
Section 5 has taken care of that problem, so that the sub­
sequent contest on the merits, the constitutional contest,
now is effective.

45
QUESTION:

Well, on the other hand * if Congress

has provided a statutory standard which new voting procedures
must conform to, what is your argument -- why would you
argue thatCongress didn't intend a private party to be able
to sue on the basis of the statute?

v

MR. BELL:

I think —

QUESTION:

The statute doesn’t just say so in

so many words, does it?
MR. BELL:

I think one of my difficulties with your

question, Justice White, is, I don’t see any decision of
this Court that has yet resolved that question.

It’s clear

that it is a question that has been on your minds.

It seems

to me that i:he Court has not yet reached a resolution of that
question.

I suppose that had the Court reached *—
QUESTION:

Well, how about — have suits been

brought in District Court?

Have they been dismissed or have

they been entertained?
MR. BELL:

To my knowledge, no suit has been ~~ a

substantive Section 5 suit has not been brought in a local
District Court when the Attorney General has not objected.
Now, another reason it’s hard to cite authority is
because this case is one of the first cases in which someone
challenged the Attorney General’s non-objection by
bringing an action other than the subsequent contest on the
merits provided in Section 5 which we think is the remedy

46

Congress Intended to be available.

And we think it is an

adequate remedy today# because there will be no undercutting
of judgments# which was the problem that Section 5 was
addressed to in the past.
I think at the time Congress extended the Act in
’75# there was no decision cf this Court which would indicate
that the substantive standard of Section 5 is clearly
different from the Fifteenth Amendment standard.

Some

members of the Court feel that the standard is the same* the
substantive standard both under the Fifteenth Amendment and
under Section 5.

And so I don’t think Congress was dealing with

the situation in which this Court had announced a clear rule
that substantive Section 5 coverage was different from
substantive constitutional coverage# so it would have to deal
with that issue by amending Section 5 or leaving Section 5
the way it is.
It seems to me that that was the issue in the
Beer case# which came after the '75 extension.

And as I say#

it seems to me from my reading of that case that the Court
has not made up its mind on the issue yet.

And certainly#

it's a difficult question.
I think our view would be that Congress has resolved
that question by saying# here is the subsequent suit.

Why

would Congress take care to preserve that suit if it was not
because it foresaw

exactly the factual situation we have heres

47
private parties disagreeing with a non-object ion by the
Attorney General?

It seems to me that’s why Congress was

careful to preserve that subsequent contest on the merits®
QUESTION %

Well» when you say substantive contest

on the merits, you’re talking about the constitutional —
•

7

the suit challenging —■
MR. BELL:

The subsequent constitutional suit, yes.

QUESTION:

Yeah, but that is not as necessarily as

broad a remedy as — in other word3, the plaintiffs might
lose that suit, and still the Attorney General’s objection be
sustained in a suit brought by the State challenging it in
a Three-Judge District Court here in the District of
Columbia, might it not?
MR. BELL:

That *s true.

If the substantive Section

5 standard is an affect-only standard, v?hereas the
constitutional requirement is either a purpose or a purpose and
effect standard, which language in the decisions of this Court
world indicate, then there would be a difference.
It seems to fa?, though, that the question of
purpose and effect is often one in which no bright line can
be drawn, and that the Attorney General, if that standard is
different, clearly could object, and if he found a clear
discriminatory effect, I think if that standard is different,
that that would certainly be a possibility for hirato object®,
Now, I don’t think that’s the situation we had in this

48

case in 1972.

There has been some question as to v;hy he

deferred, or what was he doing when he deferred in the
South Carolina case.

Well, it seems to me we have to look at

the situation in 1972.

I think the reasons are

intensely factual in this case.

The Attorney General was

faced with a situation in which a previous plan similar to the
plan which is now before the Court had been objected to in
March of that year — in March of that year — but the
objection was not based on a reasoned decision on the merits.
He said, I can't make up my mind.

Therefore, in my burden of

proof standard in my regulations, I interpose objection.
said, we are unable to reach a conclusion.

He

That’s what he

said in March to Act 932.
Now, when he received Act 1205, the plan we're
talking about now, in June — in June — the situation had
changed.
■ :L

For one thing, a constitutional court had found

'

that there was no discriminatory purpose behind that plan.
And in fact the plaintiffs in that case had conceded that
there was no discriminatory purpose behind the plan.

So

he was dealing with a situation in which parties to that
litigation had conceded there was no discriminatory
purpose? the Court had found no discriminatory —
QUESTION:

Yes, but actually — I gather the issue

here is rather narrow, isn't it?

We don’t really get to

the question of the merits of this action? it's rather

49
the narrow question of whether his stated reason for not
objecting was that he was deferring to the action of the
Three-Judge Court,

So there's only the narrow question whether

or not — whether or not that much is reviewable, that kind
of mistake, if you wish, whatever else it is, not to the
merits of why he objected or not? isn't that right?
MS, BELLS

I quite agree, Justice Brennan, but

I think *—
QUESTION:

I mean all the other things that

we’ve been discussing with you so far get rather beyond that,
MR. BELL:

I think that the reasons that he did

defer has something to do with whether we consider that
deference unreasonable.

And I’m suggesting that in addition

tothe fact ■—
QUESTION:

Well, I just want to suggest, that it's

MR. BELL:

— it's rather whether there is

point I'm trying to make.
only thing.

We don't think that was the

50

QUESTIONS

Where do you get that out of the record?

MR. BELL:

Okay, it seems to raa that — that if we

look at his letter, if we look at his letter «*— and it's
in the Appendix
QUESTION:

Are you speaking of the one you referred

MR. BELL:

No, that was the memorandum he filed

to before?

in the District of Columbia court, that if we look at his
1972 letter in which he said he was deferring, and I'm
referring to page 48 of the tan — the tan book, the
Appendi:

— and if I might invita the attention of the

Court to the‘full paragraph, which is at the bottom half
of that page, he first says, we think that our function is
to do what the District Court of the District of Columbia would
do fif this case were presented to them in a declaratory
j ucigmsnt action? that's the first thing he says.
The second thing he says is, under this standard,
that is, under the standard of doing what we think the
District Court would do, we feel constrained to defer tc the
judgment.

Than he goes on and explains that a little, more.

And it seems to me he indicates other factors besides just the
fact that that judgment had been entered in the constitutional
case.

Ha says also that there is a right of appeal to the

Supreme Court.

Parties who feel aggrieved have a full right

to seek appellate review.

He also notes, in the previous

51
paragraph, that he's considering this under a request for
expedited consideration, because the elections are getting
near.
QUESTION?

Welly but of course, in fact, there

was no — at this stage, there was no determination of the
District of Columbia Three-Judge Court.
MR. BELL:

No, there was not.

QUESTION;

.tod so the question really is, when he

says, under this standard, may he — may he do what he did?
defer the determination of the Three-Judge District Court
in South Carolina, merely because he thinks what they
did might have been what the District of Columbia Three-Judge
Court might do.

5953

Isn’t that what the issue is?

MR. BELL:

Yes, but we think that issue is —

QUESTION:

Not whether it's reviewable.

QUESTION:

That's the preliminary issue.

QUESTION:

Well, to that extent that it's reviewable,

there*s reliance on that reason for non-objection.
QUESTIONs

Right.

MR. BELL: Right.

He’s saying — I think what,

he

was saying is —
QUESTION:

No, but isn’t that the only question wa

have to decide in this case?
MR. BELL:

I think that all you have to decide is

that Section 5 means whatit says when it says when it says

52
that if the —
QUESTION:

No, no, no, please don't put it that

MR. BELL:

QKay, I"m sorry.

QUESTION:

Xsn8t that the issue for us to decide?

way.

Whether or not his non-objection based on that ground is
judicially reviewable?
MR. BELL:

I think ~ yes it is, quite clearly.

QUESTION:

And it’s your submission that even though

this can be defended as more or less

reasonable, at least

at the time it was made in the light of the then-state
of the law, I thought it was your position that even if he
had said, wo * re interposing no objection because South
Carolina voted Republican at the last election, that even
that Wouldn't be reviewable.
MR. BELL:

We think —

QUESTION:

Isn’t that your position in its

ultimate effect?
MR. BELL:

If that were his objection, we would

foe quite confident in coming to the District Court of the
District of Columbia ourselves, if he had objected on that
basis.
QUESTION:

No, I said, he didn’t object? he says,

we’re interposing no objection because your state voted right
at the last election.

Now what if ha did that?

Would that

53
be reviewable?

In your submission, it would not be? isn’t

that correct?
MR. BELL:

It would not — it would not fall within

the kind of review being sought here.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. BELL:

I don't think we want to go so far as to

say that what the Attorney General —QUESTION:

Well, your argument does go, and

necessarily goes that far, as I understand it? and I don’t find
that shocking.
MR. BELL:

Well, we think that Congress intended

to preclude that kind of review.
QUESTION:

Exactly, that is your submission, isn’t

MR. BELL:

Yes, and we think that if the Attorney

it?

General aver were to do that, JusticeStewart, that the
remedy for that is clear, it’s what happened in 1971,
Congressional oversight.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. BELL:

How, if —

QUESTION:

That’s the reason they put the onus on

the Attorney General.
MR. BELT,:

Exactly.

Now before 1971, it’s quite

clear froiaall the evidence in theCongrassional hearings
that the Attorney General was not reviewing many of these

54
submissions.

Mr. Turner said in his deposition, we were

too busy with voting examiners and registrars down in
Mississippi to pay much attention to pre-clearance.
it's also clear that in many case he

And

never responded, hundreds

of cases.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose then that you would

say that his non-objection would not be reviewable even
if he just says, we are not interposing an objection because
we haven't had time to look at it.
MR. BELL:

Yes.

QUESTION:

And we're just not able to do the job

that the statute contemplates.
MR. BELL:

Yes.

QUESTION:

You would say, non-reviewable.

MR. BELL:

Yes, non-review in that case.

QUESTION s

I think you must say that because it

sounds to ms like that's precisely what happened — in
effect what happened here.

Because he never, never looked

at it in the light of the Section 5 sta&fesd? he simply said,
some court has decided it’s constitutional.

So he's — so

it's just the sama as, I've never looked at it from the
standpoint of Section 5.
MR. BELL:

And we think that proposition is not as

shocking as it seams on its face, because there is
Congressional oversight —

55
620

QUESTION:

— it doesn't to you,

MR, BELLs

Pardon?

QUESTION:

Well

no it isn't that shocking.
V.

MR. BELLs

\

And it. seems to me that in Georgia* in the

Georgia case* this Court said that these things are things
that are left to the Attorney General.

We don’t have to find

that what he did do is the only thing he could do* or
QUESTION?

Or even the right thing.

MR. BELL;

Or even the right thing.

QUESTIONS

He might have been egregiously wrong.

But I thought it was your argument that it’s simply not
reviewable.
MR. BELLs

That's cur argument.

That’s our

QUESTIONS

Well* I wouldn’t back away from it* if

argument.

I were you.
MR. BELL:

And it seems to me that if the Attorney

General ever began flagrantly abasing that power* or doing
something which was clearly what Congress felt it did not
want* Congressional oversight would be the remedy for that
case —
QUESTION;

And not popular oversight* if you will,

MR. BELLs

— and not —• yes.

Of course that

hypothesis is completely implausive* because the Act has
been very successful in accomplishing its purpose* even in

56
in all those years that the Attorney General was not reviewing
every submission, blacks were making great strides forward
in the South.

Mr. Pottinger and others have said in the

testimony in 1975, this is the most successful piece of
Civil Rights Legislation ever passed by the Congress.
And so to talk about these hypotheses 1 think is
implausible as a matter of experience.

But even in those

situations, Congressional oversight is available, and
as you suggest, just public outrage at that kind of behavior,
if it occurred, certainly -QUESTION:

Mr. Bell, take a hypothetical.

The

Attorney General says, I am constrained to pass this up
because a Federal court has decided the question.

And he

sends that letter two days later, he sends a letter, says,
I was mistaken in that and
MR. BELL:

I do now object.

Under his guidelines, if he does both

of those things in the 60 day period, the objection will
stand", Justice Marshall, and the State could not

enforce*--

I think that’s clear under the guidelines.
QUESTION:

The trouble is, he didn’t do it within

MR. BELL:

Here, 434 days later, he entered' an

60 days,

objection pursuant to court order.
QUESTION:
within SO days

So you say it’s because ha didn’t do it.

57
MR. BELLs

Precisely,, and we think that's what Con-

gress has said* and what this Court said in Allen,
Congress knew that the Attorney General did not
make a reasoned decision cn the merits in 1975,

And they

didn't change the act.
Mr. Turner suggested yesterday that— or I understood
him to suggest that they always give reasons when they make
a response.

But his guidelines say that they don’t.

If

he fails to object, or says no objection, 51.20 of the
guidelines say nothing about him giving reasons.

If he

objects under the Section dealing with notification of
decision to object, it says, in sub (a), that he will give
reasons there.
And Congress knew that the interpretation of Section
5 was that he does not have to give reasons,
does not have to act.

. he

Now there's language of this court

in. the City of Richmond case which indicates that.

And

the proponents placed that interpretation on it in '75.
Congress knew that's what people thought it meant.

And

Congress didn't change the language of the Section.
I do think, to return to

a point that I.was

addressing earlier, that all kinds of questions will be
raised if this kind of — if this sort of litigation is
opened up, not just the question of who can seek review, but
the question of whether venue is in the District of Columbia

58
or in local courts? whethey 14(b) of theAct is a limit on
the general venue provisions of the APA? indeed, whether
14(b) requires a Three-Judge Court in an APA determination,
since Three-Judge Courts are required elsewhere.

Of course,

there wasn't a Three-Judge Court in Harper v« Levi.
soon must review be sought?

How

There's great emphasis placed

on the timeliness of the Harper v- lev! suit in this case,
but what happens if people wait a few months longer?
All of these are collateral questions that I
think would be an enormous waste of judicial time.

Why

not go to the remedies Congress has provided, which gets to
the merits of these plans?

Hither the subsequent contest

by parties, or the declaratory judgment action by the
State.
If I may, I would like to address myself also to
the q^iestioii of special ©lections in 1978, and just briefly.
Of course we think the issue is entirely hypothetical because
the District Court was correct in its decision.

But we would

note very quickly that under the Attorney General's guidelines,
were this objection ultimately to be sustained, we could go
before him' and ask him to withdraw it if the facts ot the
law have changed.

We believe that they have in this case,

and we would want to seek that.

And also, everyone admits

that we have the : ight to come into the District of Columbia
court and seek the declaratory judgment.

We would like that

59
option left open,

The State, yes, the Senate.

We note

that in Mississippi and Georgia legislators have been
allowed to serve out their full terms even after objections
have been entered or plans struck down.

It9s constitutional,

and we believe the good faith of our Senate entitles it to
that confederation as well.
A,<3 I say, we do basically consider that to be
hypothetical.

Ofcourse, our position is that the judgment

of the District Court should be affirmed.

South Carolina

promptly submitted its plan in 1972 in full compliance with the
Voting Rights Act; there was nothing else we could have done
to comply more fully.
The Attorney General did not object within 60 days.
Section 5 says, when that happens, the STate is entitled to
enforce the plan.
On these facts, we
South Carolina

ask this Court to told that

may enforce its

plan, because Congress said

what it meant in Section 5, and Section 5 means

exactly

what it isays, that we can enforce.
'Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wollenberg, you

have about three minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. ROGER WOLLENBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WOLLENBERG:

If the Court please, I do not

60

find it reassuring that Professor Bell says that great
strides are being made under the Voting Rights Act, because
great strides aren’t being made with respect to the South
Carolina Senate, which remains all white, or the Attorney
General in the memorandum that Professor Bell keeps referring
to that is in Appendix A in the red brief, in that
memorandum the Attorney General found that with proper
districts it would be assumed that if there were racial
voting, that blacks would elect four or five members of the
State Senate»
There may be progress elsewhere in the country,
in Georgia, and in Mississippi, and indeed, in the South
Carolina House as a result of orders of this Court or
objections of the Attorney General, progress has been made»
We’re here to try to get progress in the State
Senate of South Carolina,
Much has been said about the 1975 reenactment by
Congress'of the Act, and it must have been accepting the
SO day limit on everything for which Professor Bell has
been arguing.
Professor Bell overlooks the language of -- in the
House that is set forth in footnote 42 of his brief at page
29 where Mi*» Representative Edwards expressed great approval
for the Harper y. Levi decision which had

just been decided

when Congress was reenacting in 1975, and we have to say, 1

61
think, fchatCongreis in that raanacfcment was thoroughly
aware of the Edwards — and I want to — Harper ?, Levi —and I want to refer the Court also to the Senate report
No. 94295, the 94th Congress, First Session, page 18,
where a reference also was made to what was then — to the
reference to Harper v. Kleindienst and Connor v. Waller.
So Congress in 1975, I think, was well aware
of the fact that if the Attorney General got -™ went
completely out of the statutory schema and abdicated its
function, that sons result would be reached.

h lot of concern has been expressed
QUESTION:

The statutory scheme is simply for him

:o interposes an objection or not to interpose an objection?
that’s all the statute talks about.
MR. WOLLENSERGs

Yes, your Honor, but it is

settled under his own regulations and this Court’s decision
in Georgia that that is to foe a considered decision like a
Court would reach;, and it is not a decision —
QUESTION:

Well, that his regulations were permissible,

that*s what the Georgia case held.

I have it right in front

of me, and I wrote the opinion.
MR. WOLLENBBRS:

Yes, your Honor.

X think that the

kind of determination that the Attorney General is

intended

to make under Sections is the kind of determination that the
E itorney General — that would be made by the District of

62
Columbia Court if tha case were presented to it.
And this Court, in the Thermtron case and in
Dunlop v. Bachowski, has made very clear that where an
agency goes entirely outside of its statutory function,
that this Court will fashion a remedy without upsetting
the statutory scheme, a limited and narrow remedy.

And

we are asking in this case, only the most narrow and limited
remedy which was applied in Harper v. Levi, which was an
order to the Attorney General not to reach a particular
result but an order to perform his function and to reach
a decision that was independent.

And that’s what he did.

And it. was a decision that was entirely negative to the
statute f

and he indicated that it had been his view for at

least a year that the statute was an improper statute.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wollenberg, will you pinpoint a

little more clearly for me, in what respect did the
Attorney General go outside of the statutory authority?
MR. fSOLLENBERGs

Your Honor, when the Attorney

General' —QUESTION:

As Mr. Justice Stewart, the statute

gives him certain options? he took one of. them.
MR. WOLLENBERG:
an option.

In failing to object.,

he took

But just like the District Court in the

Therratron case which remanded a removed case on a ground
that was not authorized in the statute, in that same — and

63
was mandaraused for that despite statutory language and a
history of non-review of remand decisions.

Just like that

decision in Thermtron, the case here was that the Attorney
General, putting aside his own views as t© the validity of this
statute, feeling that he was compelled, constrained to follow
a District Court judgment which wasn't on the Voting Rights
Act, which was on the Fifteenth Amendment, and in which the
burden of proof had been on the plaintiffs, and where the
District Court had disclaimed that it was passing on Section
5 recognizing that that was a function for the B.C. courts
or the Attorney General, ha felt constrained to follow that.
I. cannot think of a clearer case of — well-intentione»
and good faith, no doubt — but a clearer case of abdication

of hii clear function under Section 5 to make a judgment under
the standards of the Voting Rights Act.
QUBSTXOHs

You call it an abdication.

Would-you

also agree *— I take it you would agree — that he mads an
error of law?
MR. WOLLEHBBRG:

It was an error of law, your

Honor, but it was an error of law of kind and degree that
goes far beyond an ordinary review on the merits where
factual questions are taken into account, and statutory
policy.
law.

In other words, anything can be called an error of

But when the Attorney General says, 1 won't exercise

ray own judgment because I can't, and I can't exercise ray own

64
judgment because a District Court reached a conclusion under
the Fifteenth Amendment while disclaiming the Voting Rights
Act, under those circumstances I say, like in the Thermtron
case , he has abdicated his function.

And like in Dunlop v.

Bachowski, I think that this Court can fashion a remedy
which will not open up the chamber of horrors that have been
suggested to your Honors, not open up general review,
everyone coming in to attack the Attorney General.

But

after all, the purpose of Section 5 was basically to place
the burden on the covered states to demonstrate that their
changes of electoral procedures were proper under the
standards of the Voting Rights Act.

And if the Attorney

General, in passing on that, didn’t apply the standards of
the Voting Rights Act, but applied a standard of a District
Court on the constitution, it seems to me that it is
legitimate to call that an abdication of function.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

the above“entitled matter was submitted.]
