MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume arguments

in United States against Lovasco.
Mr. Gildan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS GILDEN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GILDEN:
th® Court:

(Resumed)

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

Continuing my argument in this matter, I might

say that the government at no time before in the district
court or in the Eighth Circuit ever contended that the
^ fend ant had to prove the governmental misconduct, -the
tactical advantage secured by th® government by delaying
prosecution.

This is th© first time it has been raised, that

is in this Court.

Th© government conceded before th® district

court that all you had to do is prove th© prejudicial delay
and the subsequent resultant material prejudice, and both
elements were proved in th© district court and affirmed by
the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
It's a little bit unusual to-com© at this late data
and say th© Eighth Circuit was in error when th© Eighth
Circuit didn't even have thes© fundamentals before them at
the tiro© that th® government argued its eas© and presented
its brief to the Eighth Circuit when they said all Marion
required was the delay was unreasonable and the subsequent
resultant material prejudice.

31
QUESTION?

And that you concede is the defendants

burden.
MR. GXLDENs

That was our burden, and we proved that

burden by showing the 17-months delay, by proving that the
defendant had called the government from time to time on five
or six occasions and said, "What’s going on?"

The government

conceded that he had anxiety about his situation.

And then

^he resultant prejudice in the death of — well, we might say
that there were two witnesses that died.

However, the district

court laid its fundamentals of material prejudice on the death
of Stewart, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed the finding that
there was material prejudice in the death of Stewart.

So there

was the resultant material prejudice.
QUESTION:

Just

--

Mr. Stewart had to do only with

som© of the guns, didn’t, h©?
MR. GILDEN:

That’s correct.

But it was never isolated

as to where the guns — the government never isolated — of
course the government didn’t, know which ones cam© from Stewart
r

1

and which ones came from finding the guns in the car at the
arminal

ailroad mail facility.

However, the court concluded

that the very essentials, the very essential element, which is
the question did Lovasco know that the guns were© stolen would
be something that would be deprived of him by a trial without
having this material evidence present at a trial by the death
of a witness.

And the court, concluded that -- what is really

32

essential, Mr. Justice Blackmun, is the question that the
government didns t do anything for 17 months.
QUESTION:

This is my next question.

Does your

position depend on what the government's investigation uncovers
in the interim?

Suppose they had done something and it either

did or did not produce something additional.

Is your position

different then?
MR. GILDEN:
different.

No —* well, our position would b©

I think that if the government had just showed that

they ware trying to do something for 17 months, my position
would be totally different before this Court.

It would have

been different, I think, at the proceedings before the district
court, because —
QUESTION:

Totally different in what respect?

Would

it have met your case?
MR. GILDEN:

It would have met the standards that

they were continuing their investigation,

and then showed

nothing about ths continuous, nature of their investigation.
*

QUESTION:

What you ar® saying is if they had proved

that much ■—
MR. GILDEN:

That's correct.

'»

QUESTION:

_

~ if they had’ proved 'that much, notwithstand

ing the prejudice that you had proved —
MR. GILDEN:
QUESTION:

I say —
-- nevertheless, that you .would los© on the

33

motion.
MR. GILDEN;

1 think that within the framework of

the statute of limitations and the qu@st.ion of forasesability,
I don't think that the defendant can hold the government to
that kind of strict proof, you know, and hold that they are
sort of confined within a box that way.

That is not what I

am asking tills Court to do.
QUESTION:

What if there is no suggestion of any

deliberate delay to hurt you and no negligence, but simply
the desire of th® government to keep an undercover agant under
cover?
MR. GILDEN;
QUESTION;
MR. GILDEN;

Wall, -that was naver developed —
I know, but let's assume it were so.
If that were the case, like a continuous

narcotics investigation, I think that that would satisfy ■—
QUESTION;

It wouldn't be a continuous investigation

of you or your client, it would simply be that this agent was
in place and he might be making other cases.
MR. GILDEN;

But had they presented that evidence,

that would satisfy th® criteria.
QUESTION;
MR. GILDEN;

Bo you think that also would
That would satisfy th® criteria as wall.

I don't want to hamstring th® government in terms of —
QUESTION s

But you would think that as long as you

are prejudiced, even a negligent, ©van inattention, just

34

inattention,and negligence would — you. wouldn't: ©v@n need to
show that., I take it.

You would just show the delay and the

prejudice, and then fch© government must explain it.
MR, GILDEN:
QUESTION:

Well, say something.
In other words, any reasonable explanation

MR. GILDEN:
QUESTION:

Right.
— by fch® government.

MR. GILDEN:

Right.
/

QUESTION:

Let me see if I get this.

The defendant

concedes that it would have the burden of showing both delay
and prejudice,
MR. GILDEN:
QUESTION:

Correct.
And the government can successfully meet

that showing merely by showing some reasonable explanation of
why the delay?
MR. GILDEN:
for before this Court.

That8s correct.

That's all I am asking

I don't think that I am asking for

any principias which nail the government into a justification
which might meat the merits of the case or getting into the
substance of toe issues of toe case, just showing seme
consideration with respect to the fact that there has been a
completed investigation and now we want to get some more
evidence.
I might say that this Court should see the
potentiality of what fch© Government has don© her®.

In the

35
district court th® government argued — and tiier® was never
any proof in the record about this — the government argued
that they wares trying to get evidence that th© son was
implicated, the defendant's son, and they wanted to nail him.
They didn't feel th© defendant was guilty, but they thought
th® son was guilty.
Then in th© Eighth Circuit they changed that argument
and they said, "We wanted to find out who stole th© mail."
Then the government comes before this Court and
abandons both of fehos© arguments and says to tills Court, "We
wanted to continue th® investigation to nail th© defendant,
w® wanted to get marm evidence on him."
So now they have got three arguments.

And none of

those are supported by th© record in th® district court.
1

So

wonder, with, all these voluntary —
QUESTION:

Suppose any on® or all three had been

the subject, of seme government testimony in the district court,
would you be here?
MR. GILDEN:
my motion.

I wouldn't be her®.

I would have lost

I think tha court would have conceded that they

gave some reason or justification for th© delay, and the court
found that there was no reason or justification for th© delay,
and I wouldn’t be before tills Court — well, I would try to
appeal the issue, but. I still wouldn’t hava gotten very far.
I think that based, upon the record below, there is

36

an absence of any reason or jusiti£icat.ion.
QUESTION:

Aren't you really arguing that we ar©

bound, we must read the statute of limitations as though
Congress had said the action may be brought within five years,
but provided that it must be brought sooner unless -the
government shows that it could not have been brought sooner.
Isn't that, really what you are arguing about, -the application
of the statute?
MR, GILDEN:
of that.

No.

I just say that it!s not a question

I am just saying that if the government just showed

that they had moved their little finger on© inch, that would
ha sufficient to show that they ware doing something.
QUESTION:

Doesn't the statute say that they can

move within five years?
MR. GILDEN:

Well, I know, but if there ar© inter­

ceding constitutional rights teat affect tee defendant by
reason of the government — let me say this:

The government

states before this Court, and this is the interesting proposition,
that they hay® a right of inertia.
What troubles me so much —
QUESTION:

What fchcsy are saying is teat Congress

gave them five years of inertia in the statute of limitations.
MR. GILDEN:

They may fcs entitled to inertia, but

2 think that if intervening constitutional rights come into
play, as hear©, with the death of material witnesses, and due

37

process comes into the picture, 1 don’t think they have that
right any more»

I think they had -that responsibility- to fore­

see that within th© framework of the statute of limitations,
that there may be some resultant prejudice and they better
do something about getting this case to trial.
QUESTION:

What about a civil case where the

government is given a period to bring an action against a
private individual by a statute of limitations, and you can
mak® the same showing in a civil case.

Is th© Due Process

Clausa violated there?
MR. GILDEN:

I don’t think the du@ process —- I

think you would have questions of latches there.

I think that

is th© theory you would have there, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTIONs

Th© Due Process Claus© talks about

deprivation of lif®, liberty, or property.

Presumably a

civil defendant could b@ deprived of property just as surely
as a criminal defendant could, be deprived of liberty by
unwarranted government delay that was still within th®
limitations period.
MR. GILDEN:

I think -this Court is much more concerned

about fundamental constitutional rights of criminal cases than
they ar© in civil.
QUESTIONS

What is the fundamental constitutional

right you ar© talking about other than the right not to fos
deprived of liberty without due process of law?

38

MR- GILDEN:

The fundamsntal right is the right to a

fair trial, Mr. Justice Rehaquist.

If you donst have all your

witnesses at trial, you haven't had a fair trial.

And how can

you go to trial if you have lost your evidence, and the
government -QUESTIONS

If Stewart had died the day after the

crime, what would you have?
MR. GILDEN:

I might say that that was th® question

that was presented yesterday, and I can't say that certain —
QUESTION:

I think, it still is.

MR. GILDENs
QUESTION:

What, sir?
I think, it still is.

MR. GILDEN;

Wall, it may well b®, but I think that

certainly the district, court can deal with that issue, Mr.
Justice Marshall.

It can say that certainly that is something

the government has no control over.

But the government had

control over these proceedings.
And what ±3 so interesting is,that really bothers m®
so much, is th® government —
QUESTION :

Who determines how much evidence is

available for prosecution other than th® U.S. attorney?
MR. GILDEN:
QUESTION:

Well, he is th© only one.
Isn't that his prerogative and nobody

els®8 s?
MR. GILDEN:

True.

But let ms say this, this is all

39

QUESTION:

If he wants a little bit, he just wants

on© more witness —
MR. GILDENs

Well; h© didn't say that to the district

court.
QUESTION:
MR. GILDENs

Would that have been enough?
That would hav® been enough, he was

trying to find somebody.
QUESTION;
MR. GILDENs
QUESTION:

Can't you assume that?
Oh, I can -You don't assume that h@ did it

deliberately, do you?
MR. GILDEN:

Well, no.

Let me say tills.

it was don© deliberately, certainly.
QUESTION:

I believe

I believe that when —

What good is it to hold up prosecution

deliberately?
MR. GILDEN:
QUESTION:

Courts have h©Xd — this Court has —
I was told in law school that delay was

for the benefit of the defendant, because he could always
rely on the prosecutor's witness dying.
MR. GILDENs
QUESTION:
MR. GILDEN:
Honor.

Well, that’s true.
Weren’t you taught that in law school?
I was taught the same thing, your

But I might say, too, that it is a double-edged sword,

it can work against the defendant as well.

It worked against

him her*. . And I think that certainly delay, - dees benefit the

40

defendant, but# you know# I think -two things hav© to b®
considered hare.

The Court has supervisory jurisdiction over

some proceedings.

And let me say this, the Court when it feels

there has been a lack of prosecution or want of prosecution,
it has the right to dismss a case for want of prosecution.

And

I might say there are many cases that hold that as wall.
QUESTION;

Mr. Gilden, suppose in this case the

prosecutor had come in, th® U.S. attorney had come in and
testified, "We hav© a very large calendar in this district.

W©

just don't hav© enough personnel, enough resources, to put
everything on as we might want to accomplish what w© might want?
we have to select out the most important, and in th© exercise
°f our discretion, prosecutorial discretion, this case sat on
th© back burner

for a while."

MR. GILDEN:

Would that be enough?

That bothers m© new..

be enough to have it dismissed.
QUESTION;

I think that would

The reason that bothers me —

You think you would still prevail if that

is the only proof?
MR. GILDEN;
QUESTION;

Yes, I think so.
But as a practical matter, isn't that true

in many districts?
MR. GILDEN;

Tins®.

But what troubles m® so much, Mr.

Justice Brennan, is that we now operate at the gunshot of th.®
prosecutor, bolds courts and defendants now.
QUESTION;

I suppos® his pretrial, though —

41
MR. GILDEN:
QUESTION?
MR. GILDENs

Right.
— might have a bearing on it.
That8s what troubles me so much.

Mr.

Justice Rehnquist talked about the causes of delay in. this,
and the Assistant. Attorney General.

I might say that the

prosecutor shoots th® gun and now the courts have to get ready
^or trial within 60 days and defendants have to get ready for
trial within 60 days.

Now, w© have judicial accountability,

the courts do, and the defendants.

What, th.® government wants

to do is remove judicial accountability for their actions.
QUESTION s

Isn't the Speedy Trial Act going to put

pressure on th® government not to bring its indictments until
it is sur® that it is all r@ady to go to trial?
MR. GILDEN %

Well, certainly, because they ar® going

to have all of their evidence.
want to do.

I think that is what they

But ~

QUESTION:

Wall, th© Justice Dapartmant didn’t

sponsor th© Speedy Trial Act.
MR. GILDEN:

No, I understand.

But I think there

should b® judicial accountability for their inaction and
inertia,

w® are accountable — courts end defendants.

I

mean, w® have to jump art the will and at, the trigger of the
government.

So it seems to ms that in view of th© velocity

of .the speedy Trial Act and the policy statement of Congress
in passing it —

42

QUESTIONS

I am not sure what you mean by that., but

I think, if you would look at the records, you would find that
infinitely more casas ars; continued and postponed at tho
request of defendants by a ratio of 3 or 4 to 1 than am
continued and postponed at the r®quast of the prosecution.

MR. Q.ILDEM:

I would say this is probably true.

But what is interesting here is that L-ovasco kept calling the
government and saying, “What are you going to do?"

This

isn’t a. man who sort of took off and thought that the whole
matter was going to wash away and that nothing was going to
happen to him and he was hoping for delay and all that sort of
thing.

He wanted a resolution.

I would say-certainly many

defendants, people who are guilty* do not want to be brought
to trial, they don’t want to go to jail.
that are con

1 think that people

about their innocence and people who- are'

concor.<:Kjd about their anxiety systems and all that ar@ concerned
%out immediate resolutions of their problem.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Gilden, in th© government*s brief

they make a second argurtmit that the decision on the delay
should have bmta mad® after trial rather than in advance of
*r~ial.

Did thay ark bb.® court to postpone the decision in —
MR. GTsJMMs

No, they soever did.

This is merely

an advisory opinion of asking this Court; to rule on.

They

as. Rod the court for tfe« exercise of this discretion in
delaying the. natter until the close of the jury trial.

43
QUESTION s

What do you think about, feh© suggestion

as a procedural matter?
MR. GIXiDENs

I think that’s a bad on©.

1 feel that

when you get into pro-accusation delay and you rais© -the
question of Fifth Amendment due process f how can you go to
trial when you hav© lost material evidence?

Th@ district court

**as to make that determination before you go to trial.

If you

have lost your evidence and you have lest somebody who could
prove your innocence and ho finds that there is a violation of
.

due process, it. seems to ms you can’t have a fair trial.

i

Why

go through all that charade and then at the close of the trial
have the court rule on whether or not you had a fair ferial.
.It seems to in© that you are saving two things s

You ar© saving

the government money for the trial, yon are saving judicial

tiros, judicial economy of time with crowded dockets, and you
ar@ certainly saving the defendant a lot of counsel fees that
he has to pay for a trial of a case, that might take two or
thrcu~ or re v: deyr or a. we®};, depending upon the circumstances.
QUESTION:

One© again, Mr. Gilden, what good is the

sfetutb of .limitations?
MR. GILDEN;

Rather, what use is it?
I think it is something — and I might

say it's sc4?.afehiag the Court can be concerned about, and I
think it ks err ©iking that, as I raised before, I 'would say
fch-R. statute of limitations would be a factor in this matter
had feh© government said anything at all, had the government

44
com© through with any evitliiac® at all to show that it was
justifying its delay.
QUESTIONs

What part of the Constitution or statute

tells the proseouting attorney that he must get his indictment
within a certain number of - months?
MR. GXLDEN:

There is nothing in the Constitution,

^hars is nothing in any law except the statuta of limitations.
QUESTION:

MR. GILDEH:
■

QUESTION:
MR. <3ILDEH:

How are you injured?

What, sir?
How. ar®, you injured?
We era injured by the death of two

witnesses.

QUESTIONs

But I mean, who guarantees you those

witnesses?
MR. Gli-OENs

No on© guarantees it, but it’s my burden

to prove , under Marionthat I have been prejudiced, and I say
that ;■■■: asst med that burden and satisfied the district court
that

*>:4

had oeen prejudiced, ©ad certainly that under Marion

W; are entitled to show that prejudice.
QUESTION:

You are entitled to show it, but

1 don't

know whether you are entitled to win.
MR. GXISSJfs

Well, the. district court felt that I

should

QUESTION:
are n^cassary?

Us; l,jr M&rhaa, how many months do you think

45
ME., GILDEN:
QUESTION;

I don't waat to limit that.
Of course you can81, because —

MR. GILDENs
QUESTION;

I can’t.
I mean, you can got a narcotics indictment

in about 15 rain dies and you can get an involved conspiracy
indictnent. in about 2 yearc, right?
MR. GILDEN:
QUESTION;

That's true.
So there is no line to draw.

MR. GILDEN:

I think the district court can analyze

the type of cass, it can analyze whether it is a complex
conspiracy case, it can analyze whether it is a simpla «vent,
like here, did he steal th© guns or didn't he steal the guns,
did b© know they were stolon, didn't h@, and I think that’s
a very simple; proposition, and I think —QUESTIONS

Would th© gravity of the offens© play

any part in the kind of calculus you are suggesting?

For

example, a typical state law, tbsre is no statute of limitations
for murder, whereas for ordinary theft, lare&ny, th© statute
may be* 3 years, 4 yaars.

Would you say that’tua government's

time could be longer depending on the seriousness of the
offense?
MR.

11LDEN:

I would say that certainly a district

judge would certainly, or a state judge, would certainly
v&igh vary heavily a dismissal of an indictment based upon a
murder allegation,

tod X any that that is something to be

46
concerned about with respect to the exercise o£ discretion
by the district judge as to whether or not it was prejudicial
delay and material prejudice to the defendant.
1 say that no on© can safe up standards as to this
Crim© deserves this amount of prejudicial delay arid this on®
sets up another standard of tine.

X think it is something

for th® district court or the stata court to decide within
th© fraxnev/orx of what is 'the delay, what, was the reason for it,
and how was the defendant in any way prejudiced by th© delay.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gilden, ar© you behind in your criminal

calendars in the Eastern. District?
SIR. GULDEN:
within 60 days.

Oh, X think that we can get to trial

We are net behind at all.

QUESTION:

Have you had many cases like this out

thar-r. wh'3x* motions of this kind hav© been mad©?
MR. GILDEHi

One iacr«, a cas^ called Barkett.

It

a 4 1 -month delay, I baliftve, and it went to th© Eighth
Circuit and. came out of Kansas City.

Are you talking about th©

Eastern District or the Western •—
Questions
MR. G2LDENi

Both.
had th® district judge in Kansas City

dismissed the indictment for a 4S-monili delay.
QUESTION;
MR. GILDEN:
wrote the opinion.

Who was; vie judge on that on©, do you know?
In th® appellate court?

Judge Gibson

47
QUESTION:
MR. GXLDEN:

OK.
So I would say that from what I know

and la perusing all the cases, it is very unusual, certainly,
for a district judge to dismiss a case based upon prejudicial
delay 'and material resultant prejudice, and you will find that
the courts are -not receptive to that kind of motion.
So I think what w© are saying here is that the
government is certainly exercising a lot of concern about th®
administration of justice, but I don’t 'think th© administration
of justice is going to be in any way affected by a decision of
this Court that the defendant was prejudiced when, the government
did nothing to explain or justify its delay.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Gildea.

Iir. Rupp, do you hav© anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. RUPP
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUPP:

A coup!© of brief comments, Mr. Chief

Justice<
Mr. Gild©?:, suggested if the government had don®
anything here, perhaps this case shouldn’t fcs here.
duon :vavb*; it; alaldsr t ta here.

Well,

At the hearing on the motion

to dicraiss, the ■ Uaifcia States attorney, in response to questions
indicated that, furthermore, as to additional witnesses
received after tha date of Sepfcs^ifeer 26, 1973, that is true.

48
that is that there to few additional witnesses discovered,
but not as to the investigation itself.
expressly credited that, representation

The Eighth Circuit
and nevertheless held

that the indictment in this case should be dismissed, finding
that that wasn’t a sufficient jus-hi ficati on for the 18-month
dalay that occurred bar®.
Mr. Justice Stovens, as I raca.ll, yesterday you
expressed soma concern.about having government counsel testify
routinely in response to motions such as respondent's.

I should

point out that that is a much greater problem under the Eighth
Circuit'a formulation than under what m believe th® Du©
Process Claus© means.

Whenever the defendant under the Eighth

Circuit's formulation has bean able to make a facially
credible allegation of prejudice, the Eighth Circuit would
have the govemrusnt ccm*

in and attempt to affirmatively

justify any delay that occurred.

The only way that could be

don© is by having the United States attorney or the assistant

United 3t-..t-3s attorney com© in, attempt 'to document the course
of tie investigation in detail, saying who; was doing what at
whet rims for "That reason.

Government counsel might also have

'-•o taka the stand under tJx® Du© Process Clause as we believe
it should fce construed, but the inquiry would be much more
liirtitrd.

Govcounsel already takes th© stand in r.

m:.ari-er of con.tooi.to.

•- co

that most readily ccm-ss to mind

are motions that, deal w:i-r some aspect cf plus bargaining

49
negotiations.
With rsspect to th© questions that you asked
yesterday# Mr. Justice Marshall, th® government's position is

lxot that a potential defendant has an obligation to ask to b®
indicted.

H© raav# of course# do nothing.

The question here

is under what circumstances the defendant is entitled to
com© into court and say,”Guilty or not# th© Due Process Clause
Prevents the government from trying m©.K
Now# we hav@ suggested that a defendant may male®
the required showing in any of several ways.

And all my

response to your question yesterday was intended to indicate
is that if a defendant# a potential defendant.# had indicated
that if tee gomv.-mrmt delayed in reaching a decision whether
to prosecute# he might b© prejudiced, he would be la a stronger
position to claim immunity from prosecution.
QUESTION:

Isn't it true that he did in this case?

Is that true or not?
MR. RUPP:

The record is a bit unclear.

The record

certainly is cl©ar that Mr. lovasco called th® postal inspector
on several occasions.

MR. RiJPP!

That he ~

QUESTXQN:

That he did do it?

MR, RUPP:

No, I fhivk the record is precisely to

the. contrary.

What th© record shows is that Mr. Lovasco said

50

when, h© was interviewed 'that th©vonly guns h© had sold were
v

the guns

h© had found in the back seat of his car.

Not until

the motion on the hearing to dismiss did h® mention,and then
for the first time, that there were two additional people,
Stewart and his brother, and that th© guns in fact, or at least
two or three of them, came from some other sourc®.
QUESTION;

Do you say h© never called the prosecutor

and said, "Why don't you do something about this case?"
MR. RUPP;

H© did not call the prosecutor? h® called

th© postal inspector.
QUESTION:

I think it is the same thing.

Well, that's ‘the government.

MR. RUPP;

Y@s, that's right.

QUESTION:

K& did do that.

MR. RUPP;

He did, but he did not say anything —*

QUESTION;

He did what you wanted him to do?

MR. RUPP;

No, he didn't..

What h® did is say,

afsurae, is, "I am anxious about this.5'

I

What he didn't do. is

give the government any causa to believe that he was about to
b© prejudiced, his ability to defend himself at trial would b©
prejudiced were any delay to occur.
QUESTION;

He certainly couldn't have told them, "I

am afraid that Mr. Stewart is going to die."
MR. RUPP:

He couldn’t have said that because ha had

said earlier that he had found all of th© guns h© had sold to
Boaz in th© back seat of his car.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rupp, before you sit down, your

opponent has said that in the lower courts th® government took
the position that all that th© defendant needed to show was
prejudice and unreasonable delay.

Has ha correctly characterised

the record?
MR. RUPP:

That’s incorrect, your Honor.

As I

indicated during my presentation yesterday, the district court ~and, again, I can only refer you to the district court's order.
Th® district court based its dismissal in this case on
Rale 48 of th© Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

To some

extent that skewed th® proceedings during the opening round
of briefs in the court of appeals.

The issues presented here,

though, ware argued to th© court of appeals, and then when
the court of appeals issued its decision, the government
petitioned for rehearing, arguing both the issues that w©
present her© precisely as we pr®ssnt them her© and arguing that
the district court should have delayed reaching a decision
until after trial.

The reason that wasn't done earlier is

that th© motion itself was facially inadequate.

The motion

does net contain an assertion that Lovasco would have been
prsjudicad at trial.

It only claimed anxiety and concern

and an unelaborated assertion of pr@judi.ee.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rupp, as to that argument of yours

in part II of your brief that you just discussed that whan a
trial judge is met with a motion of this kind by til© defendant

52

that he should defer a ruling on it until after trial, do you
mean after a verdict or at the conclusion of all the evidence?
Which?

It wasn't clear to me from the ~
MR. RUPP :

Actually, it could come at either point.

QUESTION:

It could coma, certainly.

before trial.
mR.

It could

costs®

What, is your argument?
RUPP:

If the court is satisfied, after having

heard the evidence, that the defendant has suffered material
prejudice and wants to avoid having a verdict returned which
may cause soma prajic©, I think that’s appropriate.

All we

are concerned her© with is having these motions disposed of,
and particularly the prejudice aspect of the motion disposed of,
before trial of th® general issue, before the court has a
real opportunity to know precisely what this case is about.
QUESTION:
your argument?

I understand your reasoning, but what is

Before or after verdict?

MR. RUPP:

Our position is that if th© court is

satisfied before th© verdict that th© defendant has been
prejudiced, we feel h© can appropriately dismiss th© indictment;
at that point and not permit --QUESTION:

Even though th© jury might acquit him.

MR. RUPP:

Even though the jury might acquit.

QUESTION:

Even though if you appeal from the

dismissal before verdict and th® court of appeals decides you

are right, then you may not be able to prosecute him

MR. RUPP2

I am sorry.

that’s right, and I am sorry.

Let. me amend that.

Yes,

That would present a problem.

If the court would rule on —
QUESTION?

That is what prompted ray question.

MR. RUPP:

Yes, and I am sorry.

Our position then

would be that ha should wait until, as we indicated in the
brief, after the verdict is returned and before judgment has
been entered on the verdict.
QUESTIONS

That’s what Marion seems to contemplat©.

MR. RUPP:

That is precisely what Marion seems to

contemplat©.
QUESTION:

Thank- you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The cas® is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:38 a.m., arguments in the aboveentitled matter were concluded.]
