MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. FIinn, you may proceed whenever vou're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MACDONALD FT»INN, EEO. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. PI. INN:

Mr. chief Justice, and nav it nleass the

Court:
This antitrust action is before this Court for the
second time on writ of certiorari directed to the Court of
Appeals of the Sixth Circuit.
In 1069, in a 5 to 4 decision, this Court reversed
a summary judgement in favor of the present petitioners who
are the defendants below.

At the trial which followed in

the Western District of Kentucky, a verdict was directed for
the olaintiff on the liability issues,

'’’he jurv found

damages in the amount of some $93,000 before trebling, and
before the addition of counsel fees anJ costs.
Upon appeal from that first trial, the Court of
Appeals reversed, holding that while the plaintiff had made
out a prima facie case of ShermaJ; Act violations, nevertheless,
there were material facts in dispute, and the liability
issues as x*ell as the damage issue should have been submitted
to the jury.

4
Upon renand at the second trial, however, both sides
agreed to waive the jury-

Following that second trial, the

trial judge signed a photocopy of the plaintiff's proposed
findings and conclusions.

In adopting those conclusions, he

held that the defendants had violated both Sections one and
two of the Sherman Act.
Upon the appeal from that second trial, the Court
of Appeals affirmed, holding that the plaintiff had in fact
made out a prina facie case of a per se

tie violation of

Section one of the Sherman Act, and that the findinas adopted
by the trial judge below were not clearly erroneous.

As the

plaintiff urged, however, the Court of Appeals concluded that
having reached the result it did with regard to the Section
one finding, it was unnecessary on the appeal to determine
whether or not the Section two findina of
monopolize could be sustained.
It is with the case in that posture that this
Cotirt has granted certiorari.

The plaintiff, Fortner

Enterprises, is a corporation owner! by "Ir. A.B. Fortner,
a successful Louisville realtor.

The defendants are

U.S. Steel, which through its homes division sold prefabricated
houses; and its wholly owned finance subsidiary, U.S. Steel
Homes Credit Corporation, which confined its financing
services to promoting the sale of homes division houses.
By vrritten agreements executed in the first instance

in October, I960, and again in August, 1961, Mr. Fortner
negotiated with the Credit Corneration certain land loans
coverincf the acquisition and development of two neighboring
parcels of land in a subdivision owned by another of Mr.
Fortner’s corporations, Iriquois Development.

This financinq

was conditioned \ipon the agreement by the plaintiff to buv
and construct a Homes Division prefabricated house bn each
of the lots unless the underlying loans were repaid.

The

amount committed under these loan agreements was 100% of
the cost at which Mr. Fortner transferred the lots from the
one corporation to the other, plus the cost of development of
some 150 lots which were involved in the first transaction
which were not fully developed at that time.
Mr. Fortner testified that he would not have pur­
chased the defendants houses without this land financing,
which is the challenged subject in this lawsuit.

Mr. Fortner

also testified that only when the defendants had finallv
accepted his terms during extensive negotiations did he
agree to enter into this arrangement.
Fortner contends, both below and here, that this land
financing condition upon the purchases of prefabricated houses
was a per se

tie violation in that the loans were allegedly

unique, because 100% loans on equally favorable, equally
cheap terms, were not available at the time iron traditional
Louisville lending sources.

6

More specifically, Mr. Fortner and other witnesses
testified that to the best of their knowledge 100% loans
were not available from conventional lenders in Louisville at
the particular time it entered into these two transactions
with the defendant.
But, as the Court of Appeals noted, soon after the
plaintiff had negotiated its 100% terms with the defendant,
conventional Louisville lending agencies did, in fact, becrin
to grant 100% land loans.

In fact, it is undispute^on this

record that within less than a year of the second loan agreement,
in response not only to the alleged terms which the Credit
Corporation granted to the plaintiff here, but also in
response to 100% loans by other prefabricated house manufacturers,
the traditional Louisville lending agencies were indeed making
100% land loans.
be contend that Fortner has failed to make out a
prima facie case of the requisite economic newer over credit
in order to establish a per se tie

violation.

In holdinq

to the contrary, we respectfully submit that the Courts
below have failed to follow the mandate laid down by this
Court.
The Court of Appeals, on the most recent appeal,
held that even though Fortner had failed to prove that other
lenders were in any way orevented from making eoually favorable
or cheap loans, nonetheless, the requisite economic nower

7
over credit could be and was held to be in this case
established by solely three elements of proof; first, that
the loans were allegedly cheaper or more favorable than
available at the time from other sources in Louisville;
).

second, based upon the opinion testimony of Fortner's
cosnfcruction superintendent, that the tied product price,
the price for the houses charged by the defendant, was
allegedly higher than the price for a comparable conventional
house; and, finally, mere acceptance of this tying
condition in those circumstances»
I would turn now to what the petitioners believe
this Court held was necessary to establish economic power over
credit.
QUESTION:

Mr. Flinn, before you do that, is it

not correct that there was also at least reference in the
opinion to additional items of proof, namely, the fact that
there were other tie-ins with other — between your
/v

credit division and other purchases at home?
MR. FLINN:
correct,

Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe.that is

I intended to subsume that holding hv the Court

in my statement of the third element, customer acceptance.
The plaintiff has contended that uniquely favorable loans
were extended by the Credit Corporation to other borrowers.
h7e urge that there is absolutely no evidence in the record
of the terms or conditions on which loans were made by the

8
Credit Corporation to any other borrower ? we contend that
there is nothing that shows that loan s to any other
borrower on land financing were specially unique in the
sense that equally favorable terms were not available from
other conventional lenders,
QUESTION:

But is there not evidence that a certain

percentage — and I don’t remember the figure'now -- of your
Credit Company’s loans did have a tie-in feature with them?
MR. FLINN:
out of record.
an Appendix.

Plaintiff has, I think, taken the evidence

We have treated this point in some detail in
And the reason that we’ve put it in an appendix

to our reply brief, Mr. Justice, is because we are prepared to
stand and mount our argument today whether or not other
customers acquiesced in tying arrangements under uniquely
favorable loan terms.
Our argument is that as a matter of law the result
is the same for reasons which I will go into in my argument.
But we do take factual issue with the state of the record,
and have detailed the record in that appendix.
QUESTION:

Your point — just so I have it clearly

in mind — is that the customer acceptance feature of the
proof is the same whether it's this customer or this plus
some others.
MR. FLINN:
today, yes, sir.

Mr. Justice Stevens, that is my argument

Unlike a tying product which is unique or distinctive,
and commands a higher price or a premium orice, thereby
yielding an abnormally high profit to the seller, credit or
financing by contrast is the most fungible of all commodities.
One dollar is no different than any other dollar.

And no

lender can long command a higher price or more onerous or
costly terms for selling his credit or his financing services
than other lenders are asking.
In recognition of that fact, this Court — both the
majority and the defending justices — stated that the only
thing that cam be unique about a loan or financing is that
it is offered on cheaper or more favorable terms than other
lenders are offering at the particular moment.
Indeed, such cheaper offering of terms is the very
crux, the very essence, of competition among lenders.

In

recognition of that fact, and in keeping with that
competitive objective, again, both the majority end dissenting
justices of this Court rejected Fortner's argument that economic
power over credit can be established solely by the fact that
the terms offered are' cheaper or more favorable than
available elsewhere.
In fact, both the majority and dissenting justices
recognized that without any economic pox^er over credit, a lender
can decide to offer more favorable terms in order to promote
the sale of an ancillary or tied product.

Such a lender may

10

simply decide to give up some or all of the profit which other
lenders are making on the terms that they ask.

As Justice

Black stated for the majority, a seller who lacks economic
power in the credit market can lawfully offer advantageous terms
on credit as a means of promoting the sale of his tied
products, thereby in effect reducing the price of the tied
Product, engaging in price competition in the tied product
market.
In short, this Court concluded that cheaper, more
favorable terms for credit neither prove nor disprove the
existence of economic power.

They merely pose the decisive

question which must then be answered: if in fact the loan
terms were cheaper or more favorable than available elsewhere,

were

they

cheaper because

the defendants had some unique

economic ability, some unique competitive advantage, which
precluded other lenders from offering equally favorable
terms on a profitable basis ?
The issue mandated by this Court, therefore, was not
whether equally cheap financing was merely unavailable from
other lenders at the particular time.

Rather, as the

majority held, unless other lenders were legally barred from
of fairing 100% loan terms, the issue then is whether, in the
words of Justice Black, the defendants had a unique economic
ability to provide 100% financing at cheap rates because they
had some cost advantage or economies of scale in their credit

11
operation so that other lenders could not profitably lend
money on the risks involved.
The Court of Appeals addressed itself to these
factual issues.

It correctly concluded that there was

no such proof in this trial record.

Many lenders were

legally free, not subject to any prohibition upon making
100% land loans.

Similarly, Fortner offered no evidence

that the defendants had any cost advantage or economies of
scale arising out of their operations in the credit market.
Instead, the record shows affirmatively that the defendants
operated at a cost disadvantage and realized a lower rate
of

profit than conventional lenders did.

in fact, what

the Courts below found was, that conventional lenders were
not making 100% loans at the time of these transactions only
because they were unwilling to take the risk of lower
profits.
Now, as proof of economic power, as I indicated a
moment ago, both of the lower courts relied upon the evidence
qf the allegedly cheaper, more favorable loan terms which are
challenged here, coupled with the allegedly higher price of
the tied product, the houses, and customer acceptance of
that tying arrangement in those circumstances.
We urge that even if these fa <±s were submitted —
or supported by the record, they are not proof of power overcredit.

Reduced to their lowest common denominator, they

12
are at most consistent with, or tend to support, the claim
that the terms on which the loans were offered were, in fact,
cheaper or more favorable.
Proof of cheaper terms, however, as this Court
held, does not prove that the defendant had any unique ability
to offer loans on such terms.

It does not prove that other

lenders were precluded in any way from matching those
terms.
Where the tying element is offered at a cheaper
price, buyers will inevitably be attracted by that fact.
Particularly is that true where the tying element is fungible,
such as money.

Because no borrower, as we've noted, will pav

other lenders a higher price than he can obtain from some
other lender.
In those circumstances, we urge that acceptance of
the tying condition, even by numerous customers attracted
by the allegedly lower pri.ce of the financing, is at most
evidence that the credit terms were, in fact, cheaper or
more favorable.

It is not evidence of economic power.

Similarly, assume that Mr. Fortner had believed that
the defendants houses were overpriced or otherwise non-competi­
tive at the time he negotiated the loan arrangements which
are now challenged.
the contrary.

I would note that the evidence is to

Mr. Fortner’s disenchantment with the houses

appears to have occurred many months after he had negotiated,

13
requested, and entered into the second loan arrangement.
But -~
QUESTION:

Let me just interrupt you.

You say

the evidence is to the contrary, but didn't the judge find
that they are $455 more expensive?
testified.

And the witness so

So we've got to accept that.

MR. FLINN:

I agree.

I did not mean to state that

there was not a finding that the houses were higher priced.
I meant to say, there is no evidence that Mr. Fortner was
in any way disenchanted with the houses, deemed them
higher priced —
QUESTION:

But what difference does that make?

MR. FLINN:
Justice Stevens,

It makes a great deal of difference, Mr.

I believe that if at the time a buyer who

enters into a tying arrangement knowingly takes a product
which he doesn't want, knowingly takes a product which he
believes is over-priced, knowingly takes a product which
he deems is non-competitive on any other basis, it can
then be urged that an inference that he has been economically
coerced by some uniquely attractive singularly compelling
aspect of the tying element and an .inference of economic
power might be drawn from that.
Now, I am saying, first of all, in this case, the
evidence shows affirmatively --- though no finding was made
on this one way or the other -- that at the time, Mr. Fortner

14
solicited and negotiated not one but tv;o financing
arrangements.

He was in no way convinced that the houses

were anything other than superlative.

Indeed, as much as six

months after the second loan arrangement, he stated in a letter
that his principal competitor, Mr. Swindler, who had houses
comparable to his, he was sure anybody who would look at the
two houses would conclude that his U.S. Steel houses were
both cheaper and better.
Nov?, I submit Mr. Swindler, in order to survive in
the real estate business, notwithstanding that unhappy name,
must have had very good houses at very low prices.

And I

think that Mr. Fortner's own characterisation suggests that
it was not until long after he had negotiated the loan agree­
ments that he deemed these houses to be in any way defective
or overpriced.
\

My point is solely that no inference of economic
power can be drawn from any disenchantment with the houses
since that disenchantment did not arrive until after the
loan arrangements had been negotiated.
QUESTION:

I must have misunderstood your argument.

Because I thought you were saying that even if he paid more
for the houses and knew it, it really wouldn't make any
difference as long as the total package was what the free
market would dictate.
MR. FLINN:

That's the second part of my argument?

15
Mr. Justice Stevens, that even if at the time ha entered into
the loan arrangements, Mr. Fortner deemed the houses over­
priced or in any other way non-competitive, he would in the
circumstances of this kind of tying situation, have
agreed to accept that burden of the tied product only if he
concluded that the saving on the allegedly cheaper, more
favorable tying elements alone at least compensated for that
burden he was assuming.
Now, alternatively, where the tying element is aliened
ly unique because offered on more favorable or cheaper terms
than available elsewhere, the only way that a customer know­
ingly accepting the tying arrangement and knowingly accepting
a higher priced tied product, could evidence economic power
would be if the premium or the overcharge on the tied product,
the houses, exceeded the saving on the tying element.
the evidence is devoid of any such evidence.

And

The record is

devoid of any such evidence, and I believe that the plaintiff
makes no claim along those lines.
QUESTION:

Putting; your point a little differently,

Fortner could afford to pay more for the houses if he paid
less for the credit.
MR. FLINN:
succinctly.

Mr, Justice Powell, you state it very

That is our position.

Even after two trials, there is no evidence here that
traditional lenders were ever prevented by a cost disadvantage,

16
legal obstacle, or otherwise, from making 100% loans at a
profito

Nevertheless, ignoring this Court's mandate, we

urge, the Court of Appeals held, as I've noted previously,
that Fortner could prevail even though it failed to show that
other lenders were unable to make comparable loans.
We submit that the absence of such evidence by
itself is sufficient to destroy Fortner's per se time
violation in view of this Court's mandate on the prior review
of this case.
Moreover, there is affirmative proof in the record
that other lenders were not prevented from making equally
favorable 100% loans.

As I have mentioned before, even though

it was ignored by both the trial court and the Court of
Appeals, the evidence is undisputed that traditional lending
agencies within a very few months, began making 100% land
loans.
The Court of Appeals, incidentally, in its first
opinion, had correctly concluded that that evidence was relevant
to deciding whether other lenders were free and able to make
100% loans.
QUESTION;

Well, do — you stated that this evidence

was ignored by both the District Court and the Court of
Appeals.

Was it ignored to the extent that they found

otherwise?
MR. FLINN:

No.

There is no contrary finding, and

17
it was ignored, Mr, Justice Rahnquist, by the Court of Appeals
only in its second opinion,

In our brief we have cited to

the portion of the record where in the first Court of
Appeals opinion, they specifically averted to the fact that
there was no question but that other conventional lenders
began making 100% loans shortly after Fortner negotiated his
transaction with the defendants.
QUESTION:

And what was Judge Gordon's finding at

We did.

It was rejected.
QUESTION:

Your inference is that if the plaintiff

had given him such a finding to sign, he would have signed it?
Or your intimation?
MR. FLINN:
Justice.

I cannot speculate as to that, Mr.

I am saying that the state of the record, however,

is clear that other lenders did begin making these loans,
and indeed, even the plaintiff's expert witness. Professor
Hasten from the University of Georgia testified that this
became pretty much a general thing, although his testimony
as that of the other witnesses, was that at the specific
time, the particular time, of these loan transactions, he
did not believe that other* Louisville lenders were making
100% loans.

MR. FLINN:

The trial judge, however, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, predicated none of his findings upon credibility,
none of his findings upon disbelieving any of the witnesses,
none of his findings upon disavowing any of the evidence that
was in the reocrd.

He just chose to ignore it, is what the

plaintiff said.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that in order to make

a finding of fact stick, the District Court not only has to —
MR. FLINN:
QUESTION:

No.
— find the fact, but has to say, I

disbelieve the witnesses that testified to the contrary?
MR. FLINN:

No, I am not.

I am saying that in all

the facts and in the procedure of this case, I submit that
this is one of those cases where this Court, as any appellate
court, is free to look at facts which are not in dispute on
the record even though they have not been found by the trial

19

judge.
But let me say this:

even without this particular

fact, my legal argument remains the same.

I'm saying that

there was affirmative evidence that other lenders were
able to make 100% loans»

I believe that all I have to do

to sustain my argument that the plaintiff has failed to make
a prima facie case is show that there was no evidence that
other lenders were prevented from making 100% loans.
QUESTION:

And you say that the findings of the District

Court are silent on this point?
MR. FLINN:

Yes, sir.

However, the first opinion of the Sixth Circuit is
not silent on this point.
As I also noted, the Courts below concluded that
conventional Louisville lenders were not making 100% loans
earlier only because of their unwillingness to take the
risk involved.

Or indeed, as Fortner conceded in his brief

before the Court of Appeals, because such conventional lenders
would not take the chance of the loan not being profitable.
We urge that the fact that competing lenders
simply chose not to run the risk of lower profit until
stimulated by competition to do so demonstrates that they had
the ability to offer 100% loans like those allegedly given
by the defendants.
In. conclusion, we would ask the Court to consider

20
the competitive consequences of Fortner's position, adopted
by the courts below,, that economic power over credit is shown
where equally favorable terms are merely unavailable, and
simply because other lenders choose not to run the risk of
lower profit»
who

That proposition would mean that the innovator

pioneers lower credit terms to promote the accompanying

sale of a product violates the antitrust laws even though his
competition stimulates other lenders to lower their prices
for financing, a wholly desirable, laudable antitrust and
competitive objective.
To sanction that position, we respectfully submit,
is simply to stand the Sherman Act on its head.
Thank you very much, Hr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Anderson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH L. ANDERSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ANDERSON:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I appear here today for the second time, having
been here approximately eight years ago.

And before I got

here, my client asked me a number of questions.

My client

said, I understood that the Supreme Court had established
the basic groundrules for this case eight years ago. Didn't
they?

And I said, yes, I thought they had.
My client said, I thought we tried this case twice

21

and had fact findings in our favor, didn't we?

And I had

to answer, yes we did.
So, rhetorically, of course, to begin with, we
ask:

why are we here?
QUESTION:

What in Justice Black's opinion do you

point to to support a directed verdict on liability for the
plaintiff?
MR. ANDERSON:

I think part of it we could blame

on Mr. Justice White, your honor, because in his dissent,
his interpretation of the majority opinion was that, in effect,
that on the basis of the record that we had, if there were
no countervailing proof, the economic power issue as
such had been reduced, he — Mr. Justice White felt —• to a
relatively simple level on the scale of things.
basically, Judge Gordon, at the close

And that

of our 30 day trial

of this action, felt that we had proved not only all of the
evidence which was in the record before this court at that
time, but quite a bit more.

And that since there was no

evidence that —- produced by United States Steel and the
Credit Corporation to rebut that, that basically the
prima facie case that Judge Gordon felt that Mr. Justice
Black had delineated in this Court's opinion had been made,
and had not been properly rebutted.

And therefore, he

sustained the motion for a directed verdict.
QUESTION:

Do you think that takes into account

•22

adequately the existence of other sources of financing, and
the fact that the high price —• if it was high — was offset
«O'

by the low — the favorable interest rate?
MR. ANDERSON:

All of these matters were argued

ad naseum before Judge Gordon at that time, your honor.
Now, this is at the time that he gave the directed verdict.
The — one of the very interesting things about this is that
what you have heard today, and what you have read in the
briefs, are a great deal — are Mr. Flinn’s and his cohort's
economic theories.

They are not supported by the record.

But we have argued this case — and we argued this
case time and time again before Judge Gordon in the inter­
vening eight years up to the time that we got here.

And he

was quite familiar in great depth with all the facts and
all of the evidence that had been established.
Judge Gordon was not impressed at all with the very
meager evidence that had been presented for example about
the subsequent events involving basically the Louisville
Mortgage Service Company.

And their — its president testifying

that on a few occasions they had, from their own company's money,
made some 100% loans, but that those loans were not similar
to the Fortner loans with which he was familiar? and very
importantly, those loans involved personal guarantees by
principals of the borrower, which really made those loans
distinguishable.

23

Now, the only other testimony

Hr. PI inn re r red

to undisputed evidence that the only other testimony about
100% loans at a later time was some very general testimony that
was not pinpointed , but it is obvious that it involves loans
made a number of years later at a time when we were in an
inflationary spiral, and in circumstances totally different
than those which existed at the time that these loans were
made.
The only expert in this field —- as Mr. Justice
Rehnquist pointed out, Judge Gordon was free to ignore or
accept his testimony — but the only compet ent expert

:who

testified in this case was Dr. Hasten, who had been with the
i

University of Kentucky, who at the time of our last trial in
the form of the supplemental evidence that we presented,
was at — a professor of banking at the University of
Georgia.

And Dr. Hasten laid out the framework of the

economics of this case for Justice Gordon.
it was quite obvious

And, of course,

. at the trial itself, when Dr. Hasten

testified, that Judge Gordon was very much impressed by
Dr. Masten's testimony, which buttressed in many ways the
arguments that we had previously made.
And I respectfully submit that many things that you
have been hearing are Mr. PI inn8 s economic theories!.

We

get back to the basic proposition that what you have heard
today involved arguments as to facts.

As Mr. Justice

24
Rehnquist pointed out in an earlier argument today,
normally this Court does not — when a district judge acts
as fact finder —- make fact determinations»

And when those

fact determinations have been affirmed by the Circuit Court
this Court does not go behind those.
Basically, it is our position that what Mr. Flinn
is asking you to do is to go behind the Court's fact
findings.
QUESTION:

Do you think the court followed the

mandate of this Court?
MR. ANDERSON:
QUESTIONS

Yes, your honor, X do.

I'd like to hear you on it.

MR. ANDERSON:

All right, sir.

First of all, the jist of petitioner's argument is
that this Court's 1969 opinion indicated that the only way that
we could establish economic power was to establish that the
Credit Corporation had some cost advantage in what is described
as the credit market.
I would respectfully submit, to start out with,
that -— and they rely very heavily on the concept of
r

fungibility of money.

I would point out to the Court that

Dr. — that the record does not support this concept of
fungibility when it is

applied

to loans.

•phere are 1— this Court in the Philadelphia bank
case, for example, pointed out there are ■— that money is

25

the raw material and that loans are the finished product»
So we start out, I respectfully submit, with the basic
proposition that you have loans on particular terms.
just cheap loans.

Not

Because again» I submit, that while the

term, cheap, is used, we are talking about loans tnat are
on particular terms.
One of the unique aspects about the loans in question
here were — was the 100% aspect.

A hundred percent of the

cost of acquiring? the land and of developing it and of
building the prefabricated house packages that were bought,
were loaned.

We’re talking about $2,500,000 worth of loans

to generate purchases of house packages of about $700,000.
QUESTION:

Hr. Anderson, although you dislike the

word, cheap, as to the loans,

would you not agree that the

record indicates that these loans were on more favorable
terms than were available elsewhere?
HR. ANDERSON:

These loans were certainly on — it

depends on — we had a series of terms, your honor.
QUESTION:

We had

Well, but cutting through the whole

thing, what is your position with respect to the net value
of these loans to your client?

Were they more favorable or

less favorable?
MR. ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

They were more favorable.

So we could translate that to cheaper,

and we wouldn't be far wrong then, would we?

26

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, I think that it is — yes.

I

think that it is a misnomer to translate more favorable into
cheaper.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. ANDERSON:

Because if you've qot a two million

dollar loan, versus a million and a half dollar loan, the
two million dollar loan may be at the same interest rate as
the million and a half dollar loan.

But the two million

dollar loan, in certain circumstances, may be more favorable.
And that is exactly the situation here,
The volume of money being loaned was just as important
as the interest rate and the discount fee.

The interest

rate was comparable — 6% at that time was comparable to —
QUESTION:

Well, I realize that.

But cutting through

it all, isn't one of the facts that we start with in this
posture of the case that everybody agrees that these were
favorable loans for your client?
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, sir.

And if I -- but I would

like to emphasise favorable' as opposed to cheap.

One of the

reasons for that being the fact that in most instances of this
nature, you had — you have a requirement that there be
guarantees of the loan by the person, the individuals,
involved in the procedure, the borrower, Mr. Fortner in this
instance.

In this case, you had something entirely different

which created, again, a more favorable situation.

You had —

27
QUESTION:
interrupting.

Mr. Anderson, I don't mean to keep

But in terms of analyzing the case under the

antitrust laws,, does it matter in your position as to whether
the more favorable aspect was simply a reduction in interest
rate or a combination of other factors?

Wouldn’t we have

the same legal issue either way?
MR. ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

Not necessarily, your honor.

Well, then you have to help me.

Because

I don't understand your position.
MR. ANDERSON:

My position is that a favorable

interest rate can be one of the factors that makes a loan
under these peculiar type circumstances more favorable, but
that there are many other circumstances that can add to it,
that could even create a situation where the interest rate
would be higher, but vet would make the loan more unique,
more desirable to the consumer, than the interest rate, than
the cost of the money.

Depending upon the volume of money

that's involved, and the circumstances of the payment.
Eliminating the personal risk is a very important factor.
QUESTION:

But Mr. Anderson —
i

QUESTION;

Is that why you put so much emphasis on

the I003?
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, sir.

That's one of the reasons

why we put so much emphasis on the -QUESTION:

And that's why the other side put so

28
much emphasis on the fact that others continued to give a
100% afterwards?

MR. ANDERSON:

Others gave 100%

afterwards, your

honor, a few others did under the evidence.

Rut under

conditions where personal guarantees were required by the
principals of the borrower.
QUESTION:

So you think that8 s enough of it?

MR. ANDERSON:
of it.

I — no, I don’t think that’s enough

I think that is a distinguishing factor as between

the loans that were made to my client and offered to my
client. And my client was sought out.

And they kept asking

him, what will it take to get you to go with us?

Mr.

Fortner, not —
QUESTION;

It seems to me, all you're saying is

that there are a number of ways that a seller can cut the
price of the tying product.

He can cut the interest rate, he

can eliminate personal guarantees, he can make the principle
larger, he can do all sorts of things.

Rut in terms of anti­

trust consequences, what differenece does it make which
means he takes to cut the price?

It’s still the same animal,

isn't it?

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, it could get to that, your honor.

And let’s follow that up a little bit.

If you have someone,

then, who cuts the price, as you say, to the point that he
has cut the price of his loans below his cost, then, regardless

2<>

of how he got at the level of cost that he got to, if he ^is
cutting the effective price of his loan below that cost, then
we are back to the basic proposition —■ or this is a parallel
to a predatory type of action on his part.

He has created for

himself economic power, just as the man with the widget,
who -— which costs him a dollar to produce — if he decides
that he's going to sell his widget for 80£, he has created
economic power for himself.
And this is exactly what happens in this situation.
Again, excepting your premise that however you cut it the
combination of terms —
QUESTION:

You don't contend that these loans are

below cost?
MR. ANDERSON:
were below cost.

I don't contend that as such they

The U.S. Steel and the Credit Corporation

have contended — they admit they come close to it.

But

my point is that they got themselves down to a level where,
economically, the competitors at that time, in the economy
that existed at that time, were simply unwilling, because
of risk of loss, to make such loans, to offer such loans to
people.
This is the record.

This is what is in the record

These are the fact's in this case.

what Judge Gordon adopted as a finding of fact.

This is
And I submit

y

that those were the facts — economically and factually.

30

The problem was compounded by the, again — in
talking about the creation of economic power, the problem
was compounded in this situation by the fact that United
States Steel itself guarantees to the Credit Corporation the
loan.

And I emphasize that we have two different, separate

corporate entities in this case, not one.

And that when

they elected to operate under the separate corporate entity
principles, they are bound by them.
Now, in this situation, United States Steel Corporation
and we've cited the figures inthe brief — with its vast
resources, its retained earnings that it had in its kitty
to use, put itself again in the same type situation as your
predatory price cutter did by making available, where
necessary, funds from other sources to recompense the Credit
Corporation if it got into trouble in a particular loan,
such as it did with Fortner,
So that what we have — if a bank were making a loan,
or a savings and loan association were making a loan to a
developer, and that bank or savings and loan association said —
development loan like this, two and a half million dollar loan \

sa.id to that developer: you've got to buy United States Steel
prefabricated houses.

Clearly, we have two separate entities,

we have the tie created.

And then, okay: so United States

Steel comes back and says, all right, Mr. Bank, I'll guarantee
this loan to ensure achieving the ti0„

Let's turn that around.

MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, sir.

That is the one product

principal alluded to in Mr. Justice Stewart's dissent and —■
or, rather, in Mr. Justice Fortas' dissent, in which Mr.
Justice Stewart referred.

And this was one of the fears

that Mr. Justice White had in his dissent, that this type of
transaction would be either simple — what T call, sale of
product on credit transaction would be attacked under Fortner.
This is not proven to be the case, at all.

We don't have a

series of cases that have been filed over the last eight years
applying this decision in that fashion.

And I respectfully

32
submit that they're entirely different situations.

TIere

we're got the Credit Corporation being instructed to spend
or to commit itself to spend,to put forth, two and a half
million dollars to obtain $700 „,000 worth of sale.
We not only have them doing it with us, and again
this — they all didn't even have to be 100% loans to be
attractive to people.

The question is, what was sufficient?

As their own documents pointed out that we quoted in our
brief, what is enough, they said?

What is sufficient to do

the job? How much is enough to get you to take our product?
And in some instances, it may have been eighty percent.
some instances it may have been seventy percent.
instances it may have bean ninety percent.

In

In some

And in some

instances it may be a hundred percent.
But we do know this as an uncontradicted fact in
the record — and it's found by the court — that all of
the loans that were mada , I mean — yes, all of the loans
that were made, whether under the special financing program,
or under the general financing program of U.S. Steel,
contained the tie about which we are complaining here today.
And that is uncontradicted in the record.
We do know that the special financing program, which
is described by their own documents, was the program in which
they deliberately set out to attain additional sales of
house packages.

And we do know that there were 43 loans

33
involving the special terms necessary to obtain sales in
situations that were not otherwise generally acceptable»
So we — and of those 43 loans, we know that they involved
seven million, seven hundred thousand dollars worth of loans,
again involving the land acquisition and development aspects
only, of this situation.
So it can be seen from the very record, and the
i

findings of the trial court, that many, many other ties were
created by this program, and not just Fortner.

Fortner

happens to be the one that got hurt and is complaining, but
there were many others that were affected by this program
while it was in effect.
The higher price for the product as is established —
Justice Black, in the majority opinion in this case, said
this — held in this instance that this is evidence for the
finder of fact to consider.

The finder of fact considered

that evidence, and found it to be significant.
Mr. Justice Black said that these other factors that
I have referred to were evidence to be considered.

I do not

read this Court's opinion as saying — nor has the Sixth Cir­
cuit in either of its opinions — read this Court's opinion
as saying that the only way you can prove market power in
the lending situation is to prove some cost advantage on
the part of the lender.

Because — and I think that if you

analyze it, it is obvious that there are many othei 1 factors,

34
there are many other pieces of evidence that can prove that
economic'power just as well as a cost advantage.

You can

deliberately do something, and create an advantage for your­
self.

And as Hr. Justice Black points out in his opinion,

where a large company has tremendous resources behind itself,
it can do things that smaller companies that don't have these
tremendous resources behind them cannot do.
And this is e xactly the guarantee program that I
described in this -- in my argument here.

They were able

to underwrite, to the extent necessary, this program if they
wanted to.

And they elected to do so from funds from other

areas of their business.

One bit of

evidence is that all of the loans that they made involved
a tie.

Another bit of evidence is that the special financing

program, which was the program intended to get the business
when good banking principles were not applicable, involved —
that we know of — 43 loans concerning over seven million,
seven hundred thousand dollars in loans.

had to affect a very, very substantial number of house
packages.

you've got enough economic power in the credit market?

willing to back up that program with funds generated from other
aspects of your business, and where it is obvious that

of the trademark, you still don't have any economic base to
have a tie.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Flinn?
REBUTT7\L ARGUMENT OF MACDONALD FLINN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FLINN:
one thing:

Mr. Chief Justice, I would add only

these loans were not two million dollars for

the financing of land.

There is a challenge interposed by

the plaintiff in this case only to the land financing.

The

two land financing transactions together totalled less than
three hundred and eighty thousand dollars.
So I submit that on the record it's clear, even
on the findings

adopted by Judge Gordon it is clear, U.S.

Steel did not use $2.2 million worth of its assets to
promote the sale of what turned out to be 72 prefabricated
houses to this plaintiff.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Flinn, before you sit down.

MR. FLINN:
QUESTION'S

Yes, sir.
These 4 3 other loans that, your opponent

\A

y

referred to, were they contemporaneous or were they spread
over a period of time?
MR., FLINN:
r

They were spread over roughly a five

.

year period according to the face of the particular exhibit.
That exhibit was dated in late 1962.

It picks up loan

commitments, not even loan mades, Mr. Justice, but commitments

42
made as early as 1958.
that are

in addition, the two loans

listed on that particular

document for Fortner

Enterprises show that the other listings were commitments
rather than amounts actually loaned because as the record
here clearly demonstrates, Mr. Fortner did not take down
the full amount of the three hundred and eighty thousand
dollar land loans committed to him.

He gave up his project

before the development had run its course.
QUESTION t

Does the record show whether or not there

was a tie with respect to those 43 other loans?
MR. FLINT!s

I’m sure the record does 3how that.

No land financing was extended other than on the basis that
each lot would have a Homes Division house built on it.
we raise no issue about that.

So

We do, however, point out that

the $19 million loan figure which my friend, Mr. Anderson,
says was the tie is erroneous.

Of that $19 million, some

$13 or 14 million dollars was for the purchase of the houses
themselves.

Those were not land loans.

Then when we get

down to the x*oughly $5 million of land loans v?hich were
outstanding in one of the two years when these loans were
negotiated, there is no showing on the record as to how
many of those were special land loans, and therefore, by the
plaintiff's argument^ allegedly unique in any sense.

The

record is silent on those facts.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
