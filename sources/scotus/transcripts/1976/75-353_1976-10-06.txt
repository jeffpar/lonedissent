P R 0 C E ED IN GS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll hear arguments first

this morning in three related cases, 75»'353, 354 mid 55, Piper
and others against Chris“Craft and the related cases.
Mr. Cutler, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
^

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD N. CUTLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF BANGOR PUNTA CORPORATION
MR. CUTLER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

Court;
There are three sets of petitioners in this case,
held jointly and severally liable on different combinations of
events.

I shall argue for Bangor Punta, Judge Peck shall

argue for First Boston, and Mr. Pennoyor will argue for the
Piper family defendants.
This case involves a bid by Chris-Craft to taka over
th@ Piper

Aircraft Company in January of 1969.

The bid was

resisted by management, including members of the Piper family.
In 7tpril of '69 Piper's financial adviser, First
Boston, invited Bangor Punta to submit a competing bid.
did so and won in the marketplace.

Bangor

Christ-Craft went to court

and won a $36 million judgment, the largest ever rendered in a
private action under the Securities laws, and far more than any
conceivable difference between the value of the 42 percent of
Piper that Chris-Craft still owns and the 51 percent that it
s ought

5
If you will pick up, Your Honors,, the blue-covered
Bangor brief and look at page 9, that's our main brief, you
will find a table summarizing the control contest, of which tee
Clerk has extra copies»
Two technical violations of the Securities laws were
found against Bangor Punta,

The first, related to Item 5, on

that table, when, after announcing its intention to make an
exchange offer for Piper shares, Bangor bought three blocks
from institutions in off-Exchange transactions*
In a first-impression ruling on the application of
SEC Rule 10b~6, these purchases of Piper shares ware held to
have violated the rules, even though they were found below to
have been made without any manipulative intent or effect»
The second violation was found in connection with
Item 7 on that table»

Bangor's exchange prospectus did not

mention an offer it had received by one of its assets, the
Bangor and Aroostook Railroad, at a price- in cash well below
its carrying value on Bangor’s books»

In an SEC injunctive

suit that was triad together with tee Chris-Craft private suit,
tho district court found that this omission was mad® in good
faith and without intent to mislead,
QUESTION;
technical violations.

Mr» Cutler, you refer to both of those as
Bo you have a — is that a word of art,

or do you use it in a particular context?
MR» CUTLER?

I us© it in the sense, Justice Rehnquist,

6
that the violations were, as I have just said, found by the
district court to have bean made in good faith and without
intent to mislead,,
QUESTIONs

May I ask, Mr, Cutler, am I correct in

my understanding that the question of whether or not either or
both of these constituted a violation is not in issue bars before
this Court?
MR, CUTLER; That’s correct, Justice Stewart,

We

argued below, and we still believe, that they were not violations,
but we did not think either issue as to violation was of
sufficient importance to raise on certiorari and those issues
are not hare.
QUESTION;

MR. CUTLER;
QUESTION;

So we proceed hare on the premise

Y6S.
— that they both did constitute viola­

tions ?
MR, CUTLER; Right.
QUESTION;

Is it your position that the violations,

however they are characterised, caused no injur/?
MR, CUTLER;

It is our position that the violations

caused, no injury to Chrls-Craft, the plaintiff in this action,
or, indeed, to anyon© else.
The court below, the trial court, expressly rejected
charges that Bangor had already accepted that offer to buy the
railroad, or that it had even decided to accept the offer, and

7
they also rejected charges that a less should have been recorded
in Bangor's financial statements.
But the court found that the failure to mention the
offer was material,, because the offer mad© the carrying value
obsolete# as the trial court said, absent the disclosure»

And

it ordered Bangor to provide the exchanging Piper shareholders
an opportunity to rescind, which non® of them accepted,
QUESTION %

Did you say the trial court held that,

that rendered the valuation obsolete?
MR, CUTLERs

That th© carrying value was obsolete,

was the trial court's word, without some mention of the fact
that the offer had b©en received.

It did not say that the

carrying value should be changed, but that some mention should
have bean mad® of the fact that the offer had been received,
QUESTIONs

This is in the SEC action?

MR, CUTLER? Tills was in the SEC action, that carried
over to «—
QUESTION?
MR, CUTLERs

But not in this action?
It also carried over to the private

action, Justice Stewart,
QUESTIONS

MR, CUTLERs

1 see,
Yes,

As I said, the court ordered Bangor to provide an
opportunity to rescind to the accepting Piper shareholders#
which none of them accepted# because the market, value of the

8

Bangor exchanges package continued at all times to be higher
than the

value of the Piper shares that had been offered in

exchange.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Cutler, when was -that offer to

rescind mtade?
MR. CUTLERs That offer was made in, I believe, March
of 1976, Justice Stevens.

The delay from the time that cert

was denied in this Court on the original order having occurred
primarily because th® four Chris-Craft directors of Piper,
representing -their 42 percent, were anxious,, since Piper had
to issue a prospectus or a registration relating to this
exchange offer, that independent counsel be .retained for -'chat
purpose, and that updated financials ba provided.
delay was

entirely satisfactory

to the

sec,

And -that

-the enforcing arm?

but it mad® no real difference, because at all times, as I said,
throughout, the value of th© Bangor package was higher. And
no one rescinded.
Th© Court of Appeals affirmed all of these, particular
findings and orders relating to th® SEC case, and in that
action the SEC obtained all of the relief that was appropriate
for the exchanging Piper shareholders, none of whom have brought
any private damage action of their own.
Mow, Chris-Craft's private action has been before the:
Second Circuit three times, and each time the Second Circuit
reversed the District Court on the critical points of law that

9

are now here for review.

In so doing, idle Court created an

implied damage action for a non-purchaser under Rute 10b-6 in
conflict, we say, with this Court's ruling in Blue Chip; it
created an implied action for a competing offeror under 14(e),
in conflict, we say, with the principles of this Court’s later
opinion in Cort v. Ash? it held scienter was required but
defined it to equal mere awareness of the undisclosed fact
*

about those railroad negotiations, which we say is in conflict
with this Court's later opinion in Kochfelder.
And it found causation on the basis of presumptions,
despite findings in tha trial court that causal effect had nor
been proven.

It computed damages itself, on the theory that

wrongly insured Chris-Craft against a later and unrelated

decline in

the

value

of

the Piper

shares, and that confused the

value of control with a mere opportunity to compete for cdntro 1Q
Now, Mr. Liman is doubtless going to tell you a more
colorful tale, in which he will portray Chris-Craft as the
victim of tli© greatest Securities fraud since the Mississippi
bubble.

But Chris-Craft’s tale utterly failed to convince

the district court, which, as I’ve said, found that Bangor's
technical violations were made in good faith and without intent
to deceive.
We assume that this Court

did not grant certiorari

to re-try these findings of tha experienced trial judge,
findings which the Court of Appeals affirmed.

10

QUESTIONx Was Judge Pollack the trial judge in each
-- each time?
MR. CUTLER:

Judge Pollack was the trial judge in all

of the matters of which I have spoken.

Thera was, Justice?

Rehnquist,
QUESTION:

Judge Tenney was in there earlier, wasn’t

he?
MR, CUTLER:

There was an earlier Chris-Craft suit

for a preliminary injunction, tried by Judge Tenney.
I want to turn first to whether Congress intended to
create these private damage actions that Chris-Craft is now
pursuing.
As to Rule I0b~6, it seems to us that Blue Chip just
settles the issue.

Chris-Craft did not purchase any of the

Bangor securities that were offered in distribution, and the
violation was not committed in connection with those words of
10b, any of the Piper stock that was purchased by Chris-Craft.
As to 14(e), whether any private damage action was
created under 14(a) should be implied or any other section of
the Williams Act, has not bean squarely passed on by this
Court.
Under Cort v. Ash and Wyandotte, courts have implied
damage remedies only when tine plaintiff is within the class for
whose «special benefit, as Cort says, Congress acted, and only
when the harm alleged to him is the type of ham that Congress

11
wanted to prevent.
In Rondeau, this Court held that target company share
holders are the class that Congress wanted to protect in -the
Williams Act, and it indicated that the harm to them from a
violation is the only typ€^ of harm that Congress wanted to
prevent.
Thera is nothing, I think our briefs make clear,
there is absolutely nothing 'in the language or the legislative
intent of the Williams Act that shows Congress intended in
14(e) to confer rights on anyone other than the target company
shareholders or to prevent any harm suffered by a competing
offeror, but not suffered by the target shareholders as a class
*

As our briefs show, Congress gave no clue that it
wan,ted to, and neither die the SEC draftsman of the Williams
Act, or anyone who testified in its favor.
Now, Chris-Craft, while it holds Piper stock, is
very plainly not suing in that capacity, any more than a
displaced officer or director of a target company would be
suing in his capacity as a shareholder, if he was suing to
recover the fees and the salaries he lost because the new
people in control kicked him out.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Cutler, it’s pretty well settled,

isn’t it, in the federal courts generally, that a competing
offeror in a proposed, in an effort, in a takeover situation
can go into a federal district court and get an injunction?

12

MR. CUTLER:

He can go — he may very well b® able to

go, Justice Stewart, into a federal court to seek an injunction;
but, as I will reach in a moment, it seems to us —
QUESTION:

It is an injunction against a competing

MR. CUTLER:

Right.

offeror?
An injunction against a competing

offeror, in ox*d@r to protect the rights of the protected class,
the target company shareholders.

And only, all the cases to

date, in those circumstances.
QUESTION;
MR. CUTLER;

You accept that as the law, do you?
W© do not challenge that:,

tod, as I'll

show in a moment, when Congress has legislated both expressed
private injunctive and private damage remedies, it has
frequently granted a wider class the right to sue for an
injunction than the class it has allowed to su© for damages to
itself.
Now, what Chris-Craft is asking for here is the
damages for the loss of this opportunity to compete for control,
something no other target shareholder can have.
'than any other target shareholder could collect,

It's more
tod, moreover,

they are trying to collect it at the ultimate expense of -the very
target shareholders, the innocent shareholders, who accepted the
Bangor securities in the exchange offer and now hold Bangor
s tock.
And -that ironic result is going to occur in every

13
case of competing exchange offers if the lower is allowed to
recover damages against the winner*
And what we put to you is, Is it reasonable to believe
that target shareholders, who are the supposed victims of the
violation, but who .are not complaining themselves, are to be
turned into defendants instead of plaintiffs, and are to b©
injured by the judgment that’s supposed to protect them?
Yet the Court of Appeals here said that evidence of
legislative intent was unnecessary, and then, under common law
tort principles, Chris-Craft should have a federal damage
remedy, simply because it claimed injury from a violation of
the federal statute„

But there is supposed to be no federal

common law, and there is no universal statutory principia of
a federal damage remedy for everyone claiming violation, or
injury from a violation of a federal statute.
And when Your Honors look at the private remedies

■

that Congress has expressly created in the Securities laws
and many other laws, you' 1.1 find that they have weighed a
variety of competing policy considerations and come out with
a variety of answers.

Sometimes, as in the Food and Drug Act,

the Federal Trad© Commission Act, courts have held that. Congress
created no private remedies at all.

Sometimes, as in Water

Pollution and the Toxic Substances Act, that's now before the
President, Congress has created a private injunctive remedy,
but not a damage remedy.

14
And, as in -the Clayton Act and in the opinion in
Hawaii, Justice Marshall, where Congress created both types of
remedies, the Court held that Congress gave a broader class the
right to sue for the injunction than the class it gave the
right to sue for damagese And that’s why, Justice Stewart, the
cases that do allow persons outside the protective class to
seek injunctions in order to protect the class don’t establish
that Congress meant to give those same people the right to sue
for

damages to themselves „
Now, in ilie Securities laws themselves, Congress has

always created damage remedies on what the opinion in Hochfelder
called a particularised basis, for a limited type of harm and
a limited degree of culpability9 and for a limited class of
plaintiffs t
'

That’s the principle that Blue Chip and Hech-felder

follow and that the opinion below does note
Let me come now to the scienter»
In Hochfelder, the Court ruled that scienter is
required in a private damage action under 10b and also the
SEC rule issued under 10bB

And it defined scienter as 55a

mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, and
defraud»w
QUESTIONz
it?

That’s a little more than scienter, isn’t

I mean, intent is more than simply scienter.
MR, CUTLERs

Well, that was the definition of

15
scienter expressly used in Hochfelder, —
QUESTION;
MR. CUTLER;

I know.
-•* with the reservation I!m about to

come to dealing with recklessness, a point which was —
QUESTION: Which was left open.
MR. CUTLER;

Right.

This decision was issued before Hochfelder and it
held that no such intent was required.

As for the 10b~6

violation, it seems to us, Hochfelder very plainly controls
and the district court's findings of no manipulative intent or
effect, affirmed on appeal, conclude the issue.
The Court of Appeals here recognised that scienter
was required because 14(e) had been modeled on X0b~5. But after
it affirmed the trial court's finding that the omission concerning
the railroad negotiations had been made in good faith and without
intent to mislead, the Second Circuit found scienter in Bangor's
and First Boston's mere awareness of the negotiations? a
standard totally incompatible, we say, with the intent to
deceive that was required by Hochfelder.
In Hochfelder, Justice Stewart, as you noted, the
Court left open the question of whether recklessness could
ever meet the scienter requirement.

But -that, as Judge

Friendly had said earlier, was tee kind of recklessness that's
equivalent to wilful fraud, and no such recklessness, in that
sens®, could possibly have been involved here.

16
QUESTION;

Is this a point dispositive in itself?

If we agreed with yon,
MRc CUTLER;

If you agreed with us that this was not

recklessness , Justice White*. yes, we think it would be disposi­
tive,
QUESTION;

Of tlie entire case?

MR0 CUTLER;

Of the entire ease.

Every one of the

four points I had hoped to argue*, I will not get to, —
QUESTION;

Yes, I understand,,

MR. CUTLER;

— causation of damages is dispositive.

QUESTION; But — and you think this issue is con­
cluded by a case decided here since the Court, of Appeals action?
MR. CUTLER;

Yes.

Precisely.

The omission here was one that was fully discussed
between Bangor and First Boston and experienced counsel for
both of them, and it was deemed appropriate by all of them in
good faith* And, while in hindsight it may have been in error,
•that kind of decision, it doesn't, seem to us, can possibly fit
within Hochfelder's description of recklessness, ©specially
when -the courts below both concluded that there was no intent
to mislead? and that everything had been don© in good faith*
QUESTION;
show

May I ask this question;

Does the record

what percentage of Bangor Punts's earnings were derived

from the BAR Railroad?
MR. CUTLER;

Practically none*

If the record doss

1?

show, Justice Powell, the earnings, X think, in the last
pertinent year amounted to $60,000»
QUESTIONS What percentage
MR» CUTLERs And when the BAR was sold, even prime rate
interest on the five million, in cash, that was later received
when it was later sold, is obviously far more than $60,0000
QUESTIONS

Is there any evidence in the record that

indicates the extent to which the market appraiser's earning
power, as distinguished from the appraised value, «“
MRo CUTLERs Well, there is the objective fact,
Justice Powell, as Judge Peck will develop, that when the
railroad was in fact sold for five million dollars in cash,
after this exchange offer terminated, the price of Bangor
Punta8s stock went up within the succeeding two weeks»
Now, I may have missed my lights, Mr0 Chief Justice»
Hava I used -- I was supposed to have 20 minutes at the
beginning»
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Well, you've had a

little over 20 minutes now»
MR» CUTLERs

Yes» Well, I think, then, sir, 1 had

better leave the issues of causation and damages, each of which
would also be dispositi%7e, to my brief, reserving five minutes
for rebuttal, and I may have an opportunity to comment on
both then»
Thank you

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Judge Peck.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. PECK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION
MR. PECK:

Mr. chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The thrchold question in this case as far as First
Boston is concerned is:

What duty it owed to whom, in its

capacity as underwriter of Bangor Punts registration statement
and exchange offer?
And specifically, did it owe any duty to Chris-Craft
as a competing offeror?
The answer is found in Section 11 of the Securities
Act, defining the responsibility of an underwriter on a
registration statement, which is a duty of due diligence,
created by Section 1.1, and owed only to persons acquiring the
securities offered.
Now, Chris-Craft was not a member of that class, and
there’s no suggestion that it had any standing under Section II.
The claim is that,notwithstanding the express
provisions and limitations of Section 11, Chris-Cra ft — First
Boston had an implied responsibility under Section 14(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act, an Act that makes no reference to
underwriters and unlimited as to the parsons to whom it might
be liable, and as to the amount that might be recovered,
because the registration statement was made in connection with

19
a tender offer.

That fact, that connection makes all the

difference.
New, the untenability of such a claim, w© submit^ is
apparent, both from its conflict with the express language of

Section 11 and in necessary recognition of the fact that
Section 11 is the source and the only source of an underwriter's
responsibility on a registration statement,
QUESTIONS

Judge Peck, it's my understanding that

the — your brothers on the other side of the podium claim that

you are acting here, while you may have been acting as a
conventional statutory underwriter in the terms of the 1933 Act,
in your capacity in connection with the registration statement,
that you were, in addition, acting — that you had a. different
hat on through a good deal of these negotiations, and that

you were the general or the manager, or whatever the language
is in their brief, I've forgotten, of the whole deal.

And

in that respect you were not a, quote, “underwriter", unquote,
but you were acting in quite a different capacity»

Isn't that

~ do I understand that correctly?
MR» PECK:

Yes, -that is their contention, but it has

been completely rejected, expressly and specifically, by both
the district court and the Court of Appeals, whose only fault
was found, as far as First Boston is concerned, with respect
to 14(e), and it said that it had no directing or responsible
connection with any of the other alleged violations, that it

20

acted only in a professional capacity and solely in good faith.,
Those were the findings of both the district court
and —
QUESTION: But that's not saying solely as an under­
writer*
That, I thought, was their point*
MR* PECK: Well, cover it as you wall, there was -- in

the first place, the courts below said that it did rot
participate in these other matters in any respect other than
lending professional advice and assistance*
Now, I submit that that doesn't make anyone a
principal, or impose any of the liabilities of a principal*
QUESTION:

Well, at least one of the claims is based

on ©vents that occurred before First Boston was in the picture?
is that not so?
When did First Boston get in, in terms of -MR* PECK:

Well, First Boston came in, in its first

connection, whan the Pipers — after the Pipers rejected
well, the Pipers asked, in the first place, asked First Boston
to appraise the value “*■* I mean Bangor Punta

no, pardon me,

I’m right the first time? the Pipars asked Bangor Punta to
appraise the value of the Chris-Craft offer in the first
place, which -they did, and which they said had a value of $S5
a share.
The next thing was after the Pipers decided -that they

21
didn't want Chris-Craft as a partner, they asked First Boston
to participate in finding another offeror, which it did, and
that’s whan Bangor Punta came in*
Now, there is nothing in Section 14{e) to imply this
cause of action that's bean asserted here. There is nothing
in the legislative history to suggest any such congressional
intent.

Indeed, the whole of -the legislative history is

perfectly clear that the intent was to protect, only investors,
the class to whom an offer is addressed, the only persons who
can act upon the offer and the only persons who can be misled
if there's anything misleading.
There is nothing to meet any of the tests that this
Court has enumerated in tee past for implied causes of action,
Indeed, the very idea of causes of action to a person outside
a protected class, upon showing that the class was misled,
certainly dees not give rise to the implication of a cause of
action.
New, the anomaly is illustrated here.

Not. on© of the

persons who accepted the Bangor offer has ever complained? not
on© accepted the offer of rescission by direction of tee district
court.

And the anomaly is further illustrated by what tee

Court of Appeals did her© about causation.
Chris-Craft

adduced no evidence that the so-called

admission of the BAR — and that, I refer to BAR g>s the railroad
and the sale of tee railroad — that the omission of that from

22
the Bangor Punts registration statement accounted either for
Bangor Punta* s success in the contest or for Bangor — or for
Chris-Craft's loss of the contest,,
And the district court therefore held* and I'm going
to quote* that Chris-”Craft had failed to establish an essential
element of an action for damages* to wit* a causal relation
between the deficiency and the Bangor Puntei prospectus and
the harm complained of„
The Court of Appeals, however, faced with the inability
to establish causation* solved the problem very simply»

It

said that proof of causation* injury and damage v/as unnecessary*
all were to be presumed»
Nov/* the presumption that the Court had to indulge in
to reach its decision is not only impermissible, as a matter
of law* and demonstrative of the lack of proof of causefcion in
this case*

but* I submit* also demonstrative of why such a

cause of action as Chris-Craft is asserting here dees not
exist under the law»
Common and statutory law down the years* even in this
era of consumer litigation* have been

both practical and:

sensible in not spawning endless litigation between competitors
on charges that misleading advertising of one has taken away
customers from the othere

And Congress certainly didn't

intend to launch such litigation by 14(e)»
How* the Court of Appeals must have understood all

23

this, for it offered a special theory of imposing a non-existing
liability upon Bangor Punt a and First Bo-: ton alike „
It is, as the Court

expressed it,- that 14(e) created,

quote, wa broader standing to sue accorded to offerors based
on fraudulent tri-transactions ,"
In other words, scienter creates standing, And then
it proceeded to say what it meant by scienter, and it was that
it meant something more than mere negligence,
QUESTION

%

You say that the Court of Appeals said

scienter was a substitute not merely for intent but also for
caustion,
MRo PECK 2

Standing,

QUESTIONS Standing,
MR, PECK:

Yes, Your Honor,

And then it made its great error, conclusive in it*.a
light of this Court's language in Hochfelder? it said that an
intent to deceive is not an essential element of the causa of
action.
In other words, even though you're in a fraud case,
you don't need intent to defraud.

Anything more than mere

negligence, as it labeled First Boston's conduct here, would be
sufficient.
Now, I'm going to come, therefore, to scienter as the
way the Court, of Appeals worked it out.

It said that Bangor

Punta was required to apprise the Piper shareholders of the

24

negotiation over the BAR, and of the consequent indication that
it wasn’t worth what it was carried at on the books *

And that.

First Boston had enough information to reasonably deduce that
the registration statement was inaccurate in this respecto
The particulars given, however, were entirely in the
terms of First Boston’s investigation, which it said wasn’t
sufficient, that it should have carried, undertaken a further
investigation.
Mow, there’s no suggestion in the opinion as to what
any further investigation of First Boston would have disclosed,
or that it would have disclosed anything other than what First
Boston, the district court and the Court of Appeals alike found,
that there had been no decision to sell the railroad at the time
the registration statement was out.
Indeed, the district court rejected as having no
substance Chris-Craft’s basic claim that at the time of Bangor
Punta’s exchange offer it had intended to sell the BAR and
delayed the sale to avoid disclosure.
And said that it; could find, not even find that
there was any probability, reasonable probability of a sal® at
that time, that there was no purposeful omission of it from the
prospectus, and that First Boston acted solely in good faith.
Mow, tha Court of Appeals upheld those findings, and
agreed that the failure to disclose the sal® negotiations was
not in bad faith.

And then adding, however, these fateful

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr® Pennoyer®

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G„ PENNOYER, JR®, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF HOWARD PIPER, ET AL®
MR. PENNOYER:

Mr® Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Speaking in behalf of the Piper individuals, at a
slow gallop for five minutes, I'd like to discuss the issues
of causation and damages and the issue of scienter and touch
briefly on the S.3sue of individual liability and joint and
several liability.
On the question of causation and damages, — and I
won't repeat the legal points made by my colleagues, but solely
the facts *— the sole basis for this $36 million judgment
against the Piper individuals hangs on three communications
sent by Piper management in January of 1969, in the course of
Chris-Craft's cash tender offer for 300,000 shares for $65 a
share, at a time when Chris-Craft needed about 620,000 shares
to get control, and at a time when it said right in its cash
tender offer -that it did not intend by that cash tender offer

27

to acquire control®
Now, the

Piper contribution to Chris»Craft's lost

opportunity to get control seven, months later hangs , in the
Court of Appeals opinion, on a presumption#

Chris~Craft tells

this Court that, but for the acts of others later, it was a
sure winner and would have had a 99 percent chance of getting
control#
So that against the position of the party, the Court
of Appeals, nevertheless, makes a presumption that the acts
of the Pipers in communicating, as they did, in January caused
this lost opportunity seven months later#
We say that is contrary to the lesson of Mills, and
I will touch that no further, we've covered it in our brief#
On the question of scienter, the district court, as
trier of fact, construed the two letters that were sent in
January -- and 1 might say they are all reproduced in the Reply
Brief ~~ construed the statement that management is convinced
the offer is inadequate as a reference to the offer as a whole#
The Court of Appeals simply disagreed and gav© its
own construction, concluding that the reference was to price,
and,based on its own construction, declared that these letters
were materially misleading, and -therefore, said tee Court of
Appeals, the Pipers or the Piper management, in sending the
letters, recklessly and knowingly disregarded its obligations
to shareholders#

28
Similarly with the other, the third communication,
the Grumman press release, the Court of Appeals stated that
one of the many terms of the agreement should have been
specified in the joint press release put out by Grumman and
the Pipers.

The term, that is, that dealt with the right to

resell the shares to Piper.
The Court of Appeals said, with that provision in the
press release, there was a material omission, and therefore,
said the Court of Appeals, the Piper management, in issuing the
press release, recklessly and knowingly disregarded its
obligations to shareholders.
QUESTION? Do you think that might be a relevant,
factor in a private suit by a shareholder against Piper?
MR® PENNOYER;

Yes, we would not question that in a

private suit by a shareholder? it might be.
that it was a material omission, or that the
materially misleading.

We do not agree
letters were

But certainly it would have more

relevance in a suit by a private shareholder.
'Now, the district court — or Chris-Craft, let me say,
would infer scienter, and this is the only basis of scienter
that Isve already mentioned, on the basis of the Piper
management’s opposition to its tender offer, and to Chris-Craft
generally? but we say teat our position to Chris-Craft does
not equate with intention to deceive.
The district court heard the witnesses, it heard

23

William Piper, it heard non-Piper family management, director
witnesses on the question of -the communications»
Chris-Craft stipulated that the letters were prepared
by a proxy solicitor and reviewed by counsel, said Piper
testified that counsel advised them as to what needed to. be
said in the press release»
Now, with respect to individual liability, while the
whole Piper board —
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You are now moving into the

rebuttal time, Mr» Pennoyer»
MR» PENNOYERs Well, then, I will simply close with
this statements

that individual liability, a violation of a

fiduciary obligation to shareholders, was found on the basis
of a single footnote sentence that the Pipers, in sending the
letters, acted in their own intexst and not in the interest
of the shareholders.
Thank you»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr» Liman,

OPAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR L. LIMAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF CHRIS-CRAFT INDUSTRIES, INC», ET AL,
MR, LIMAN:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it pleas© Idle

Court:
I*m not going tc tell you, as my brother said, a
colorful tale or talk flavor»

But I think it would be of

assistance to this Court if I talked facts, the undisputed

30
facts on which the Court of Appeals decision rested, and I
think that you will find that those facts bear little
recognition to the presentations that have been made before»
As Mr, Justice Rehnquist observed, the issue of
violation was not raised in the petitions, and
given, and they were serious

those are

violation, and they occurred at

every stage of -this control contest? at ©very single stag© of
this control contest there were violations committed by the
petitioners to thwart Chris-Craft, violations which brought
forth two SEC lawsuits and on® proceeding by the New York Stock
t

Exchange»

QUESTIONs

There were two violations, they could

hardly have occurred at ©very stag©»

There were two, one

involving the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad valuation, and
the other a violation of 10ta~6? wasn't that it?

Two

violations»
MR» LIMAN?

No, Mr» Justice Stewart, there was a

violation in January, at the time Chris-Craft made its -tender
offer, when the Piper family, to discourage shareholders from
accepting that offer, made misrepresentations to 'them»

There

were violations when Bangor Punfca acquired its shares
illegally, in violation of Rule 10b«6»
when it announced its exchange offer»

There vrere violations
And there were violations

when Chris-Craft*s exchange offer was competing head-to-head
against Bangor Punt a's exchange offer»

31

But X really would, like to concentrate on the two
violations which Your Honor is referring tof because it is
also a given in this case that the control that Bangor Punta
has and exercises rests on 14.5 percent of Piper stocky which
it acquired illegally*

Illegally in these two transactions?

one, the acquisition of 7*5 percent for cash? the other, th®
7 percent through a misleading exchange offer»

And that

without those blocks, not oxily would Bangor Punta not have
control of Piper, but, at the end of the exchange offers,
Chris-Craft would have been leading by 41 to 31 percent, and
that was a lead which all experts, including their own,
testified was virtually insurmountable*
Arid, finally, there*s another point that. I should
address myself to right at the outset, and that is that ChrisCraft didn't come into court for the first time asking for
damages, it came into court asking for what my brother Cutler
said, a tenderer should ask for? it asked for a preliminary
injunction in late July of 1969 to preclude, to enjoin Bangor
from having the right to vote the illegally acquired cash
shares, and from consummating its exchange offer*

It told the

court at that time that if Bangor Punta was allowed to
consummate the exchange offer, the contest would be over, and
Bangor Punta, at that time, opposed it and it said — and
I quote from its memorandum in opposition to that preliminary
injunction — that it should be denied because, even assuming

32
Caris-Craffc can prove the allegations in its1 moving papers at
a full trial* after Bangor Punta hssB had the opportunity of
properly preparing itself for trial* a money judgment will
fully compensate Chris-Craft for any damages.
So when we —
QUESTIONs

Mr. Liman* could I interrupt you there?

The Court of Appeals * when it affirmed the denial of the
preliminary injunction* didn't rely on that* as I read it* but
rather relied on the fact that you could have received a
permanent order of divestiture* at least as to the 10b-6
violation* —
MR* LIMANs
QUESTION?

Yes »
— and thereafter you waived* as I under­

stand the case* you waived any equitable remedies arid elected
to stand on damages.
MR. LIMANs

That’s ~
Would not the case have been —• wouldn’t

this not have been air appropriate case for going forward on an
equitable basis after that point? and*if not* why not?
MR. LIMAN:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

But it ~

MR. LIMAN:

Bangor Punta, with full knowledge of this, proceeded to change
tlis complexion of Piper, brought in a new chief executive

But even in Chris-Craft II, we said ~~ her® we first

They want to enjoy the benefits of an

illegally gained control,
QUESTION t Did they oppose di vesti turcj on the ground
that it was not appropriate relief, or on the ground that they
then were disputing the liability issue?
MR, LIMAN:

No, they opposed it on the ground that

it was not appropriate relief, that Chris-Craft had waived it,
and that, in any event

they also, of course, opposed

liability; but they opposed divestiture as relief.

And the

Court of Appeals, you'll note in Chris-Craft II, said it
really was unfeasible, and I could explain th© difficulties
with it, but they threw up ©very obstacle to equitable
relief, which is what we were really seeking» We wer© not.

and still is a most valuable company»

Piper was

Your Honor, —
QUESTION;

Just one -- just so 'I have it sorted out.

When did the case finally become just a damage case?

It was

after Chris-Craft — the Court of Appeals second opinion# then?
MR. LIMAN;

No# in Chris-Craft — after Chris-Craft I

was decided# and after they proceeded to make the changes in
management# we said to 'the district; courts

We don’t believe

that divestiture is practical now# we want damages.
Whan they then opposed damages# we said;

Well# if

damages are not available# then we will take divestiture#
because an inadequate relief is better than no relief.
They opposed divestiture# and when it was remanded,
finally in Chris-Craft II# the Court of Appeals said;
Divestiture is impractical and unfeasible; award damages.
Now# in the early stages of the contest, and I don’t
want to dwell on them# that was the period before Bangor came
in# and it was a period when Piper committed these violations,
and they tell you that Piper acted in order to oppose ChrisCraft.

We never disputed their right to oppose Chris-Craft —
QUESTION;

You’re talking about the Piper individuals #

so-called?
MR. LIMAN;

The Piper individuals. We never disputed

that. That’s a false issue here# but they had to oppose it by
lawful means.

And the president of Bangor Punta# Wallace,

testified at trial that when he met them, to com© into the race.

35

they were espousing a scorched-earth policy against Chris-Craft.
Those were his words.
Now, Bangor Punta entered in May.

It entered by

acquiring the Piper shares, and it announced an exchange offer.
Chris-Craft also had a pending exchange offer and registration,
and at that time the contest stood at 33 percent Chris-Craft,
31 percent Bangor Punta.

So it was nip and tuck.

And Bangor Punta recognized, and the record shows it,
that the outcome would turn on certain blocks of stock that
were held by large holders, principally the fund, of funds, the
Cornfeld organization.

And Bangor Punta was advised that

these shares were leaning toward Chris-Craft, they were
emotionally committed to Chris-Craft, and that unless Bangor
Punta could take these shares out from under — and X*m quoting
— out from under Chris-Craft, that Chris-Craft would win
and that Bangor Punta*s strategry memoranda shewed that only
!

by acquiring these shares could it win.
Now, there was on© obstacle to the

acquisition of

these shares, and that was Rule lQb-6 of the SEC, which, as it
read and as it was interpreted by the SEC, precluded a company
that had announced an exchange offer from buying the stock of
•the target company for cash.
Now, this was a matter of real concern to the SEC,
because in April it called Chris-Craft and its counsel for that
down to the SEC and it warned Chris-Craft that if it bought any

36

of these shares for cash it would consider it a wilful
violation subject to criminal penalties,

And the counsel for

Chris-Craft advised Chris-Craft to comply? Chris-Craft did
comply- it cancelled all orders to buy shares for cash and it
didn't buy another share for cash while its exchange offer was
pending# even -though the opportunities were presented.
Now# on the eve' of Bangor Punta. entering the contest#
the SEC published this warning in a release,

Bangor Punta

stipulated in Chris-Craft II that it read the rlease. And it
not only read the release# but it received a warning from its
counsel to comply,

Bangor Punta said it relied on counsel.

Well# no counsel has ever found

no court here# district

court or Court of Appeals- has found that any of these parties
relied on counsel in either the 10b~S violation or the exchange
offer.
But its counsel testified — and what counts is what
he says# not what is said in & brief in this Court — and he
said that while he differed with the SEC’s interpretation —
and I'm quoting# and it's in our brief# at page 13 to 14 —
“We felt, that under the circumstances we should take a con­
servative position and therefore what we instructed management#
in effect# was# or in substance# that in view of that language
we should not involve ourselves in the solicitation of any
shares# in other words# we thought that it was proper to buy
shares of stock but only if they were unsolicited and not

37
over an exchange.B
And he later went on to testify, in accordance with
the wording of that rule , he instructed his management —
“instructed”,, these ar© the words — not to buy shares from
broker™ dealers»
And, really * what happens here could be summed up in
the difference between the way Bangor Punta reacted to the
advice of counsel and the way Chris-Craft did.

Because Bangor

Punta went right out, after these instructions, and it bought,
first, 40,000 shares of stock from two broker-dealers, American
Securities and Bay Securities,

It stipulated in Chris-Craft II

that it dossn*t even claim an exemption on those purchases under
Rule 10b™6, and. in fact, its counsel testified that they
didn5t tell him about those purchases until after they were
made.

So much for the reliance of counsel.
More importantly, they went and bought 80,000 shares

from Fund of Funds, and there they presented an issue of fact
and excuse at trial in Chris-Craft II,
shares ware not solicited.

They said that these

And the district court found

against them, and it said they solicited them, -they actually
flew out to the Bahamas to pick them up, and Bangor Punta never
even appealed from the finding of the district court that
those shares w©r@ solicited.
So that, in effect, all 120,000 shares were bought
in violation of their counsel*s advice and in violation of Rule

38
10fo™6, and it isn't as if Bangor didn’t have a remedy if it
wanted to contest the SEC*a interpretation, the SEC’s signal;
and instructions and directions here»

Because Rul© 10b~6

contains an exemption provision, which says that if you feel
•that any particular purchase may not have a manipulative or
improper effect, then you go to the SEC and present your casa»
Well, if they had done that, and if the SEC had
agreed with them, then the SEC would have had to give Chris™
Craft notice that it, too, could compete for and buy these
shares»
So what did Bangor Punt a do?

It j us t simply defied

its counsel's advice and went behind the back of the SEC and
bought these shares, while Chris-Craft was sitting there like a
bunch of Boy Scouts»
Now, to add -—
QUESTION:

Mr« Liman, may I interrupt you there?

Mr® Liman, as 'I understand it, and I think

I’m correct, there's no question in -this case, no question

The real question, the preliminary question at least,
is, isn't it, whether or not, given those facts, you have a

like to then return to the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad spat,
to the whole issue of standing, first under 14(e) arid then under
10b”69
On Section 14(e), the argument here, the premise of
their argument is that the Act was passed, the Williams Act

42

was passed to protect only stockholders and not to establish
rules of the game which would be for the protection of the
contestants,
X would submit to Your Honors that even if their
premise were correct# and I’ll show you that it is not# that
the only way that that protection of shareholders could be
enforced is by permitting the contestants to have a right of
action# which is the conclusion that the various courts that
have considered this have come to.
And the reason is simple.

Congress recognised that

these tender offers# always mad© at a premium above market#
were of great benefit# great value to shareholders.

Now# who

would make a tender offer# who would seek control# if he could
be cheated out of it by illegal means?
And we're told here# at least Congress was told by
the SEC# that -the SEC did not have the means to police these
control contests mad© by tender offers.

The SEC said that the

time was too short# their resources were too small# Idler© wasn't
pre-filing.

Senator Williams himself expressed skepticism and

pessimism# which X share# about the utility of shareholder
actions in keeping these contests honest? and# -therefore# if
these rules which Congress wanted to lay down to end industrial
warfare were to have any teeth and to have any meaning# then
the parties who have th© stake in the contest# the contestants#
really have to have the power to police each other.

And --

43
QUESTION j Was Congress told that?
MR. LIMANs

Yes.

Congress

it was not — what it

was told was what I had said before, that the SEC didn't have
the manpower and resources to do it.
Now, what was Congress's — what was in Congress's
mind, because I'd like to address myself to that.

In the Blue

Chip case, the Court observed that the cause of action under
lQb-5 was really implied in the absence of any indication by
th© SEC or Congress that there would be a private right of
action.
Well, here there was a vast difference.

First, it

t

was clear from what was said by both the SEC and Senator
Williams, that a principal purpose of this Act was to establish
ground rules, a code of fair play, which would protect both
.sides to th© contest.
And on th® very pages that -they cite for th©
proposition that Congress was concerned only about shareholders,
in the Senate hearings, Mr. Cohen said, WI should indicate,
however, that th© shareholders alone are not th© only persons
concerned”, and noted that if the bill were passed it might
serve to help the* take-over bidder in certain situations.
QUESTIONs Well, how reliable is that, Mr. Liman?
You’re talking now about th© testimony of a witness,admittedly
th© Chairman of the SEC, before a committee.
high-grade legislative history, is it?

That isn't a very

44

MRo LIMAN? Well, I think so, because-she SEC 'proposed
Section 14(e) here# it wasn't in the original bill.
But now let me quote Senator Williams,, the chairman
of the committeeo

He said, 85It is our nation's legitimate

businessmen, as well as the more than 20 million American share­
holders, who have the most to gain from this legislatione611
Again —
QUESTION s

You cite that remark as supporting the

implication of a private cause of action on behalf of one of
the tenders?
MR« LIMAN?

I cite that remark and others, such as

the desire to avoid tipping the balance, the importance in
other parts of the legislative history that the statements in
the House hearing, that if-there were an orderly supervised
process of disclosure and if some ground rules were lead down,
not only would the investors be batter protected, but everyone
would know where h® stands,
QUESTION?
MRs LIMAM?

Who was -that statement by?
That was Mr, Cohen, tbs Chairman of the

SEC, telling Congress teat»
I cite that for the proposition teat Congress was
not concerned alone and was not insensitive to the fact that
by establishing rules of a contest, that you would be offering
protection for both sides, just as you have in any contest»
More than that, this was a cas© in which the Act was

45

passed after a long history in the courts of causes of action
under Borak, under Section 10b-5» and Borat was discussed
before Congress«
about it»

Senator Williams was sophisticated, he know

And the SEC* in a letter to the House, pointed out

that tei® Birnbaum rule was an obstacle to lawsuits against
management opposing tender offersand said that because the
new language of the Williams Act was rejecting th© “in connec­
tion with sale" language, then that obstacle would ba removed*

Now, this again, let's sea what grad©

of legislative history this is»

This is a letter from the SEC

to whom?
MS. LIMAN*

To, I think it was Congressman Staggerst

and —
QUESTION*

And this qualifies as legislativ© history

in your view?
MR* LIMAN*

I think it qualifies -as legislative

history in determining whether there should be an implied
cause of action, because Congress acted on it*

Section 14(e) —

QUESTION*

How do you know Congress acted on it?

MR, LIMAN:

Because — I know because Section. 14(e),

unlike Section 10b-5, does not contain the Birnbaum-Blue Chip
language about 3in connection with a sale**? it contains
language of a much broader nature, and it contains that language
after Congress was told that, the effect of the language would

Weil* that might mean *— that might mean,

theoretically, that in some future case somebody might sue in
litigation like this, who said, !:I was deterred from buying

That's the most that that could mean»

No, it could mean that, and it could

Because the cases that were

coming up in the courts at that time involved the protagonists
to these contests»
QUESTION? Well, Mr# Liman, so long as you3re relying
on Mr» Cohen, as Chairman of the SEC, when did he use the
language that we find in''this legislative history, or in the
reports, I should say, wWe are concerned with the investor who
today is just a pawn in a form of industrial warfare, the
investor is lost somewhere in the shuffle»w
MR* LIMANs

He used that on the same page, Mr»

Chief Justice, as where he said that the investor is not the
only party who's concerned»
QUESTIONs Well, then, he said also, the only thing —
“the only tiling the bill is designed to do is to make effective
the purpose of the bill, so that the information which is to be

47
provided to the investor does.; In fact get to him."
MR. LIMANs

Yes.

But ha said that the way of making

fsure that fch© investor was not going to be lost in the shuffle
was by establishing rules of fair play, which would be binding
on both sides, and which would constitute codes of conduct on
which they could rely.

And, page for page, I think -the Court

will find in the legislative history there was more concern
expressed about conduct by management than conduct by the
tenderer.
Now, the commentators at the time, -*»
QUESTION?

Mr. Liman, before you move on to the

commentators, also Chairman Cohen, on the same occasion,
testified, as I understand it, that the Williams Act is not
designed to assist the offeror, nor designed to assist the
management in resisting any plans put forward by the offeror.
It is essentially based on the concept that the investor should
have the information so he can arrive at a proper decision.
Now, the part you rely cn is sandwiched between toe
portion fch© Chief Justice quoted and —

MR. LIMAN?
sistent.

Well, I don't think that it*s incon­

I think, as in the proxy contest, that the only way

the investor can get protected is if the parties to the
contest can police each other's conduct.
Now, when Congress had the bill before it, with this
broad language removing Birnbaum, there were commentaries,

fact that this bill was being enacted with this legislative
history # would confer standing,,

QUESTION:
MR. LIMAN:

Would confer standing on who?
On the tenderer as well as the target.

The SEC# which was the principal draftsman# and# as;
such# this Court has usually said its views are entitled in
those circumstances to great weight# went right, into court#
within a matter of months after the passage of this Act# and
said it confers standing on both sides.
And# most important# Congress# in 1970# amended this
Act.

It amended the Act after there had bean four celebrated

cases which said that there was standing for both tenderer

And the Congress did nothing to

circumscribe these interpretations# it did nothing to diminish
this right of action.

In fact# acting at the SEC3s request# it

strengthened the Act by giving the SEC more rule-making
power.
Now# Crane was decided on pre-Williams Act grounds#

this issue will no longer be with us # because Section 14(e)

49

gives the standing now»
Now, th® concessions that my friends make
QUESTION:

Mr» Liman, before you leave the 14(e)

standing issue, would you respond to their argument that.* everassuming you might have standing in an equity cas® and so forth,
when you get standing in a damage suit, the recovery adversely
affects the people who are the principal beneficiaries of the
legislation, namely, -the shareholders of exchange.
MR. LIMAN:

Yes»

I think that argument that they

make, first, has no applicability to -this case, because we did
go in for an injunction and they opposed it? and the rule has
always been, I think, clear, that where you — even if you have
a right only to equity, if equity cannot be done, than you can
get equity damages ? and they certainly did everything to
frustrate th© grant of relief.
QUESTION:

But, on th© facts of this case, apparently

there are some Bangor Punta shareholders who exchange Chris*»
Craft stock, and the value of whose shares will fo© declined
because of the $35 million judgment»
MR. LIMAN:

Yes„

Nottf I want to address myself to

that»
At the time, that rule constituted four percent of
til® shareholders of Bangor Punta, and when the rescission offer
order was being worked out, in the district court, Bangor
Punta made a big issue of the fact that many of these people

50
had sold, and that, therefor®, they shouldn't get the benefit
of the rescission offer.

So that there's no indication in this

record that -there's a single one left.
But the argument really proves too much, because what
it would say is that it would immunise a party who gains control
illegally by making an. exchange offer, if he had two percent,
three percent of the shareholders were former shareholders of
the target.
Now, look at Chris-Craft,

Chris-Craft had more

shareholders of Piper accept its exchange offer.

Nobody on the

other side of the table expresses any concern for them.

Their

only means of getting any form of restitution and compensation
in this case for the injury done is if Chris-Craft has standing
to sue.

At least to ■—
QUESTION:

Mr, Liman, in responding to Justice Stevensc

question, you referred to Bangor Punta as having gained control
illegally.

Is there any finding of fact, either in the district

court or the Court of Appeals, that the violations on the part
of Bangor Punta were causally and factually connected to their
gaining control?
MR, LIMAN:

Yes,

The Court of Appeals said, and I

think it's a matter of mathematics, Mr, Justice R@hnqu.ist, that
without each of these blocks it would not have control.

It

needed both for control.
Their argument on causation is that, even assuming they

51
had not acquired these shares illegally, then perhaps they may
haws, on some other day and by some ether means, acquired them
legallyo

They speculate on that.
QUESTION;

There is a factual finding that in the

record by one of the courts that there was a factual causal
connection between the violations and the ultimate acquisition
of control?
MR. LIMAN:

Yes. The Court of Appeals emphatically

states that, and it*s a matter of mathematics that -their
control rests on these illegally acquired blocks.
Now, th©

as I say, their argument is that this

Court should indulge in the speculation that maybe they — if
they hadn’t preempted the shares illegally, maybe they could
have gotten them legally.
Well, ever since Chief Justice Stone's opinion in
the Bigelow case, 1 really think that that argument has not
been heard.
They also male© arguments on —
QUESTION:

Well, do you think the Court of Appeals

also found or had to find that without the control Bangor
Punta

that Chris-Craft would have obtained it?
MR. LIMAN;

No, the Court of Appeals distinctly

did not find that, and it really refused to engage in til at kind
of speculation.
It did find in Chris-Craft III that Chris-Craft's

52
plurality * which would have been 41 to 31„ would have commanded
a premium, which suggests the value of it.

And, as I say, the

experts all testified -— I think Bangor Punta's expart said that
with 41 to 31, he doesn't sea hew Bangor Punta could have over­
taken Chris-Craft.
But X think that the problem is that — it's one that
was alluded to by Hr. Justice Harlan, as a former trial lawyer:
the problem of trying to prove what somebody would have dene
years after the event, when, actually, he never was faced with
the decision because his shares were obtained illegally.
It*s an impossible burden of proof, and the Court was content
here to base its holding on the fact that without those illegal
blocks, Chris-Craft would have enjoyed s rather substantial lead,,
Now, as I say, their concessions to legislative
history, including the 8 70 amendments, are to say that we, ‘that.
Chris-Craft should have the power to seek injunctive relief,
Well, Bo yak, I thought, ruled out the distinction between
injunctive and legal relief? but, in any event, we did seek it.
They stopped us.
And, second, they say, well, maybe management or the
target company should have the right to sue, because all of the
courts have agreed that the target company has the right to sue,
And if you give the target company the right to sue, but not the
tenderer, —
QUESTION:

That is, the courts have agreed that the

53

target company has the right to try to get an injunction»
MR» LIMANs

Yes,

And if you give the target company

the right to come into court

then, what would tip the balance

more, contrary to congressional intent, than not to permit the
texi ceror to come into court?
I would like to address myself to the 10b™6 standing
issue.
The district court and the Court of Appeals found, on
10b-6, that there was .standing under Birnbaum.

In the 1973

petition, Bangor didn’t even raise that, in fact, it didn’t even
raise Birnbaum as an obstacle in Chris-Craft 11$ and there was
a good reason why the courts found that -there was standing,
because Chris-Craft wasn’t the bystander of the Blue Chip case.
Chris-Craft was a buyer, it was bidding for th© very shares
that were illegally preempted here, and it had invested —
QUESTION:

Whfcn you refer to standing, you’re

referring to standing as whether you — whether Chris-Craft
has a cause of action.
MR. LXMAUs

That’s right.

And, you know, here’s ®

cas® in which we invested $44 million and wear© bidding for these
shares, and they went and preempted them illegally.
The Solicitor General, in his amicus brief on cart,
at page 17, notes that sines Section 14(e) proscribes manipula­
tive and deceptive conduct, that clearly an act that violates a
manipulation rule gives standing under Section 14(e). And if

54
you really contemplate it, I think an analogy suggests itself
to all of us, this was if, in a football game the referee blew
the whistle and one player goes while everybody else has stopped
play, runs to the unprotected goal, comes back and says it
should count, because the referee really shouldn't have blown
his whistle»

Well, you'd nave anarchy if you’d permit that

kind of argument; and you’d have anarchy if that kind of
argument could be made where somebody really wilfully violates
a rule of the SEC.
QUESTIONs
QUESTION:

Mr. Liman, —
Mr. Liman, that the shareholders ultimately

pay the bill for these things strongly is supportive of what
Senator Kuchel said when he introduced the bill, and what
Senator Williams said, and what other witnesses said, that
their concern was for the shareholders and no one else.
How do you protect the shareholders by putting a
burden on them of millions of dollar's of the judgment?
MR. LIMAN:
course, here.

You have two groups of shareholders, of

You have the Chris-Craft shareholders, who have

lost what Bangor Punta is being asked to pay; and, therefore,
it’s not a meitter of shareholder versus some other character,
it’s a matter of shareholders versus shareholders.
Now, Bangor Punta shareholders have rernedi.es against
their own directors.

Directors can get, and in almost all

cases do get, liability insurance.

And, really, the whole

55

purpose of the Williams Act was to have prevented what happened

lights to get controlf and then later coming in and saying#

Mr» Liman, let me go back to the 10b-6

I’m just not quite sura I understand your position»
Do you contend that Chris-Craft was a purchaser

within the meaning of the Bimbaura rule# or that the 3irsfcaum
rule does not apply to 10b-6?
MR* LIMAN:

I would contend both# that -— because the

burden — because 10b~6 does not have the 11 in connection with"
language# that Birnbaum should not be applied -to it®
But I contend# more than teat# that Section 14(e)

I don’t understand the* relevance of 14(e)

contest^ and Section 14(e) was adopted for the regulation of
conduct of tenders —
QUESTIONs

MR» LIMAN;

Oh; I see what you’re saying»
~ and it does contain language that

you shouldn’t engage in deceptive conduct»

And I contend that

what happened here violates that; too»
Going beyond that; on scienter; the Court of Appeals
has been made out here to have applied some standards that were
pre-Hochfelder, and that, didn’t really conform with Hochfelder.
Well, in the first place, the violations here w@r©
knowing violations? the violation of Rule 10b~6 was a knowing
violation»

The violations by the Pipers were knowing violations9

characterized by a scorched-earth policy» And the violation on
the BAR, and I didn’t get into tha facts, though they are set
forth in our brief, couldn’t have been more knowing, it had to
be judged in the context of competing exchange offers which were
perceived by the public to bs identical*
Chris-Craft got 112,000 shares, they got 111,500
shares.

And here they had an asset, mid in answer to a question

57

from -the Bench# this railroad in the first two of the last five
years had earned one-third of Bangor Punta’s income# they had
an asset which was being proffered to the public as. having a
value of 18 million on a market price evaluation in a section
of their prospectus which was updated to September 1968# and
the district court said that no director of Bangor Punta could
have believed that it had that value# and the reason that they
couldn't have believed it is that on May 22 the board had
received a recommendation# unanimously from its committee# to
sell tills railroad for five million,, The only dissenting voice
was that it should be sold at seven million.
They now come into this Court and say# Well# of
course# we never believed that it had this $18 million market
value# and we never contended otherwise.

They did# in fact#

contend otherwise in the Court of Appeals# and if I had the
time I could quote from their brief 'there.
The fact is that they presented this railroad as
having an $18 million value# it had a $5 million value. When
they did not warn or even hint in -their prospectus that this
railroad was on the block# and that this kind of loss could be
incurred.

The loss would have wiped out the earnings# and you

would have# -therefore# had a red number in their prospectus
going against a black number in the Chris-Craft prospectus.
It would have wiped out 36 percent, of the —
QUESTIONS

Mre Liman, I had understood that the

58
district court found that there had been no agreement on the
part of Bangor Punta to sell the BAR railroad stock at the
time the prospectus was issued.

And that actually the sale

occurred* as I recall, in October, a good many months later,
MR0 LIMAN:

Right,

The district court fotand that

there had been no agreement to sell,

It found that no director

could have believed -that it had the value# and, in fact,, the —
it found* also# that the head of the negotiating committee#
Hutchins# had reached what he believed to ba a conclusive
agreement with the buyer# which was memorialized in a
memorandum of the buyer# which is set forth in our brief# and
which said that the sale would talcs place two months after the
exchange offer was completed.

And it occurred exactly then.

But the important tiling was that the district court
said they couldn’t have believed that it had this inflated
value o
. Nowf they say that the Court of Appeals applied
improper standards of scienter.
that their conduct here was

Well# Judge Mansfield said
I’m sorry# Judge Gurfein said

that their conduct was recklessness equivalent to wilful
fraud.
Judge Mansfield said# citing Texas Gulf Sulphur* that
they ignored red flags and warning signals.

Judge Timber said

that their conduct was worse# and their scienter arguments
were dismissed in Chris-Craft III# where they said it was just

59

negligence and it wasn't reckless, as being frivolous *
That's a strong word for the Second Circuit to use
unanimously„
Thera was no finding in this record that they relied
on professionals0 The only advice they ever got from an account­
ant was that if -they sold this railroad they'd have this
enormous

loss of $13 million.
I observe that my time is finished.

the other points.

Very well, Mr. Liman.

Mr. Cutler, you have about five minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LLOYD N, CUTLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF BANGOR PUNTA CORPORATION
MR. CUTLERs
QUESTION %

Thank you very much. Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Cutler, could I ask you two questions,

if you could cover it in your brief time.
MR. CUTLERs
QUESTIONS

Yea.
Mo. 1, would you agree or disagr@€i that

the management would have standing under 14(e)?

That's one

question.
And the other question, I wanted you to refresh my
recollection in, why is the scienter relative to our problems
here, in view of the fact that liability is a given?
Just cover them, if you can.
MR. CUTLER;

Your second question was the first one

60

I wanted to take up, Justice Stevens, so? if I could,, Isd like
to answer that first»
When I said that the issue of violation was not in
the case , even as to 14(e). I should have mentioned that as our
certiorari petition itself states, and as tee questions
presented state, w® raise the question of whether damages are
recoverable under 14(e), absent scienter* in tee Hoch fed doc
sensa»
So that is an issue in tee case»
As to — could you repeat your first question again,
Justice Stevens?
QUKSTIOWs The first question is whether management
-- the other contestant would have standing under 14(e), and,
of course, logically, you understands
MR. CUTLER:

Yes,

Right»

tee corporation, as distinguished from

We would concede teat
management interested

in its purse, its salaries or fees in case it got thrown out,
but teat, the corporation has standing certainly to sue for an
injunction to protect the target shareholders, and perhaps even
to sue for damages for tee corporation, which would protect the
target shareholders.
QUESTIONs

Now, in your counterclaim in the district

court, was teat, the same position you took there.1?

Did Piper —

well, it wasn't yours, but did the Piper individuals takes tee
position, I guess, teat they had standing? didn't they?

61

Was there not a counterclaim?
MR. CUTLER; There was a counterclaim by Bangor Punta,
which was a counterclaim once 'Chris-Craft had sued us.? but our
answer to Bangor Punts specifically ~~ it was a stipulated
answer -- specifically raised the question, of what we’ve bean
calling her® their standing -bo sue? whether there was liability
for damages.
QUESTION; Well, then, if you should admit that
\

management would have standing in a contest like this, doesn’t
that make it sort of a one-sided standing rule, that on© side
has standing but the ether does not?

That’s what troubles me

a little bit about this.
MR. CUTLER;

I was speaking of the management having

standing to sue the —
QUESTION;
MR. CUTLER:

To sue for the corporation.
~ tender offeror.

In this case, of

course, we have two tender offerors.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. CUTLER: But let's say one tendar offeror, for an
injunction or to recover damages, perhaps, for the benefit of
the target shareholders, who are all members of that corporation.
QUESTION;

MR. CUTLER:

I ss@e

And perhaps, and I did say in answer to

a question from Justice -Stewart earlier, that perhaps even a
competing tender offeror would have standing to sue for an

62
injunction to prevent injury to the shareholders.
But the test, as I think -fell© Chief Justice’s opinion
in Rondeau makes very clear? is;

Can you show some injury to

the shareholders?
And while I’m on that point? and your further
question? Justice Stevens? while it is true? of course? that
some of the exchanging Piper shareholders own Chris-Craft stock?
it would seem to me? No. 1? that their injury is not an injury
of the kind we need consider here? because the principal
violation is on© relating to 'the Bangor tender offer? the
one -they didn’t accepto

They accepted the other offer.

Moreover? given a case in which soma of the target
shareholders are on one side of the damage suit and some are
on the other side? Congress might very well have left that
particular issue alone and said “no damage remedy"? just as th©
district court really did here.
I’d lik© to come next to the question of whether the
14.5 percent? which Mr. Liman says were involved in the two
violations? was decisive.
You have an express finding on that from the district
court, that after both of those violations? at the time that
the preliminary injunction was denied? that neither party has
gained control and both are in a position to do so.
In fact? th© Court of Appeals? when it was affirming
that finding? said each side had an equal opportunity to gain

63

controlo
What the Court of Appeals did was to misinterpret
Mills — and this is a point I don’t have time for now, which
will be covered in our brief — to presume both* that, the
target shareholders would have rejected the offer, and,_of
course, Mills invokes no presumptions and turns only on the
point that the target shareholders were entitled to a clean
and accurate prospectus or proxy, whether or not it would have
affected their offer,»
And, secondly, he made the presumption, which Mi11s
certainly doesn’t, authorize, because it said damages should be
awarded only to the extent they can ba proven, that the
violation caused Chris-Craft to lose its opportunity for
controlo
Is that all the time I have?
