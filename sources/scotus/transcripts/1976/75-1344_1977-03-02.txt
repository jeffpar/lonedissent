MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-1344, Scarborough against the United states.
Mr. ITirschkop, you may proceed whenever you3re
ready, I think.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP J. HIRSCHKOP, ESO. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue before the Court is a rather narrow one
here.

There is very little history or case law to really

draw upon.
The Court had the issue before it somewhat in the
Bass case, United States v. Bass, but not

precisely the

question raised here, which is an extension of Bass.
In Bass, however, the. Court reviewed the legislative
history, as much as there is of it, and concluded the legis­
lative history is of no great force and effect in this case.
I think we have to start again at that touchstone, accepting
Bass, what it stands for, although it was four members of
the Court that went as far as I would ask the Court to go in
this case, and five who went as far as the interpretation that
you have to have an interstate commerce nexus that is current
for a possession offense — I’m sorry, five who said you have
to have an interstate commerce nexus for possession, whether

4
it be current or not wasn't

reached by the fifth member*

In the legislative history we only have, really,
the comments of the Senator who proposed this amendment,
Senator Long,

In fact, three other Senators spoke on the

legislative debate, Senator Dominick, Senator Dodd and
Senator McClellan.
Each of those, three expressed reservations as to
the amendment itself.

Senator Dominick said, perhaps it has

gone too far; we can try and work it out in conference.
Senator Dodd, who drafted Titia IV, Section 922,
corresponding statute, said he was uneasy about it, but that
they would study it.
Senator McClellan said it requires further thought,
said he would try to understand it.

But he agreed with

Senator Dominick, it may go too far.
It's hard to say what they were talking about.
Looking at Senator Long, it's very clear what he had in
mind.

He wanted to stop felons — and I'll deal only with

the felon section of the statute, since that's what this
case covered — he wanted to stop felons from having guns
where they could engage in further crime having

previously

demonstrated that propensity.
And Justice Black, in the dissent in Bass, goes
to that language, in very plain language.
But the majority in the Bass case points out. that

5
ail through there is interstate commerce? in 922, they
require insterstate commerce in both the receiving and
transporting sections,

(g) and (h) i in 1202 they cite

clearly interstate commerce.
And the Court, pursuing that, held in Bass that
there had to be an interstate commerce nescus.
It's interesting, though, in Senator Long's
comment, in the legislative history, he says you could own
but not possess a weapon.

And then in discussing the

possession of a weapon, he goes on further, and says very
clearly, you shouldn’t possess it.

He doesn't want criminals

to have guns.
But he uses interchangeably a number of times
the words, acquire, with, possess, and taking with possess.
He says this amendment does not seek to do anything about
who owns a firearm.

He was concerned with the complaints

about Titia IV, the Dodd bill, at the time.
In Bass, the Court quotes the statements of
Congressman Pollack.

There's very, very small debate in

the House of Representatives on it.

And Congressman

Pollack says, one who takes,possesses, or receives a
firearm across state lines —■ and then has a number of other
statements cited in the brief for the respondent.
What we're left, with is a statute with literally
no legislative history.

Only the comments of Senator

6
Long, which are contradictory in places, although his intent
is clear.

But it’s only his intent,
He never, however, expresses clearly the intent,

whether there must, in fact, he that interstate nexus
required in the Bass case,
And so the Court than has to look where to go with
the matter.
I suggest to the Court the place we have to go is
to the Barrett decision of this Court in 1976, which is
very interesting in its scops.

In Barrett, it’s a 922 case,

and it does go to a case concerning receiving a firearm
that has travelled in interstate commerce,,
Justice Blackmun in the majority opinion in Barrett
points out that you must look to the specific language o £
the statute. How, Barrett is a case on 922 where

there

is a good deal of legislative history, where there were
reports from the Congress, there were extensive debates
from the Congress, there was much that could be looked at.
But Barrett was -- quoting Justice Blackmun — was
couched in the present perfect tense.

It cited a aun that

has travelled in interstate commerce, or has been shipped or
transported in interstate or foreign commerce, is the exact
language, i
And Justice Blackmun, looking at it there, writing
for the majority, said you must look at exactly what they

7
meant by the tense itself.
Now there was discussion between the majority and
dissenting views in Bass as to where commas were placed.
I suggest to the Court that given the legislative history,
or lack of it, in the Bass case, you can draw no inferences
for any commas or lack of them,,
But in Barrett, very precisely the Court says, wa
must look at the tense used; we must look at what the
legislature ended up saying.

That's particularly pertinent

in 1202, with no legislative history to draw upon.

You must

look at what they said, and deal with what they said, or take
upon yourselves the chore of legislating.
And he point3 out in the Barrett case, Section 922 (k) ,
Justice Blackmun points out, it uses the word, in commerce.
And that's the same language that's used in Section 1202, the
Section before the Court now.

Justice Blackmun points out

there's no lenity required in examining Section 922 because
there are no ambiguities as there v~ere in Section 1202, as
pointed out in Bass.
He further points out, there was, of course, a
great deal of legislative history; but he points out,
interestingly enough, that the legislative history pointed,
in Section 922, similar to that small amount of history on
Section 1202, they want to prevent possession by criminals
of handguns

8
Now the scope of who has them is different between
the two statutes.

People under indictment are included in

922? in 1202, it has to be people convicted of a felony,
aside from other classes of people.
Bat what is clear between the two is Congress in
both had an interstate commerce requirement.
statutes.

It is in both

And it is a question of how the Court will apply
*

that.

The sole question, as I see it in this case, is what

is the degree of nexus?
current?

Can it be current?

Can it be past?

Or must it be

Or must it be any nexus?

You approached this in the Rewis case.

Now Rewis

was not a gun case f it was an interstate gambling case under
the Travel Act.

But there you approached the problem of

what is the degree of nexus required?

How much interstate

commerce must there be, or what degree of interstate commerce
must there be, for it to be a violation of law?
When you look at the two Acts , the 1202 Act is
very precisely in current and present tense.

One who receives,

possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce.
There5s nothing past in it.

As opposed to 922, as I read a

moment ago, receive any firearm or ammunition which has been
shipped or transported through interstate or foreign commerce.
Now 32 d does not have a proscription against
possession.

But the language bn interstate commerce between

the two is very instructive.

9
And X suggest to the Court,, the only place you can
look for an interpretation of 1202 is to the language itself.
And as you pointed out in Barrett? you must look clearly at
the tense used? and take that for what Congress meant in
the absence of anything else.
*

In the Bass case? the Court pointed out that Title
VII was not carefully molded to complement Title IV.

In

fact? Title VII may be one of the worst examples of legislation
in terms of careful consideration on the Congress8 behalf.
It was brought to the floor and read? a week later
it was brought to the floor and read again.

During the

first week? the only comments were made by Senator Long.
During the second week? Senator Long made comments again.
He had a couple of questions from the three other Senators.
And then it was supposed to go to conference ? but for
some reason not clear in the record? not clear in the
Congressional record? it was immediately voted up„ and passed.
In Bass? the majority opinion by four Justices goes
farther than just saying there must foe a nexus.

It suggests

there is a difference between possession and receipt offenses.
And it goes on to state very clearly that more is required
for poseS3ion offenses.
Now? this has been treated by the government in
their brief as pure dictum.

I don't know if there's such

a thing as pure dictum in an opinion of the United States

10

Supreme Court.
In the Second Circuit, the Bell decision — that's
United States v. Bell — which came down this oast year —
late 1975 , I'm sorry — they treated that.

Thev foiled the

particular position we asked the Court to follow in this
case.

They took the totally opposite view of the Fourth

Circuit.
But there they cited the difference between what
they call obiter dictum and judicial dictum.

They pointed

out that the language in Bass was not just judges speculating
about soma thing, but a specific problem.
1 em that was present in Bass.

And it was a prob-

VThile not directly considered

by the Court in the opinion, not expressly considered, the
Court had to inherently consider it.

Because the Court

dismisses Bass, dismisses the indictment eventually, sayinn
there's no interstate nexus demonstrated in the record.
The Court recognizes inherently in there there would
have to be an interstate nexus shown to reach a conviction.
And the question of whether it need be a current of past
nexus would be inherent in that.
QUESTIONs

Has the appellate court, that is, the

Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, expressed the view
that the possession had to be by a person who contemporaneously
was himself travelling in interstate commerce?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

It didn't go that far, your Honor,

11

sayinq he had to he in interstate commerce.

But they went

as far as this Court went in Bass, or as the majority went in
Bass, that it had to be a current nexus of interstate commerce
QUESTION:

Now what do you understand that to be?

What are you contending in this case that possession in
commerce means within the meaning of this statute, 1202(a)?
HR. HIRSCHKOP:

That the person himself is in

commerce, or the person himself is engaged in —
QUESTION:

Now if the person himself is in commerce

and possesses a firearm, then the word transport is redundant,
isn’t it?
HR. HIRSCFKOP:

It may not be, your Honor.

If the

person is at an interstate facility, not actually going inter­
state , but somehow affecting commerce—
QUESTION:

If he’s waiting at an airport or a

railroad station?
MR. IIIRSCHKOP:

If he’s there, your Honor, or con­

ducting an act, say a robbery of an interstate facility,
the possession there would obtain, where transporting might
not.
At any rate, the Bell -QUESTION;

That else do you contend?

Is that call,

that you think the person can be convicted of possession
under this statute only under those circumstances that you’ve
✓

just described, where the person himself is — the possessor
then is in, somehow or another, interstate commerce?

12

MR. HIRSCHKOP:

No, sir, if the gun itself is in

interstate, if there is a clear showing, perhaps, that the
gun was passing through his possession.

It was a temporary

possession of a gun that had not come to rest out of inter­
state commerce; that also would pertain.
QUESTION:

Well, \tfhat sort of a case would that be?

That would be a receipt case, wouldn't it?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Well, the receipt

could well be,

prior to the time of his conviction, as we had in this
case, the Scarborough case.

But there could be a contract

to sell the gun, or a pledge, or some kind of adequate legal
showing to move the gun again into interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

That is, possession for the purpose of

sending it in interstate commerce?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:
2

QUESTION:

Constructive movement?

MR. HIRSCHKOP:
it.

Yes, sir, yes, sir.

Yes, sir, I think that would cover

I think there are probably a whole slew of things.
QUESTION:

I understand your position in this case

is that, read as extremely as the government suggests the
language should be read, that the moment he was convicted of
another felony -- of a felony — the moment any person is
convicted of a felony, if ha has at home a firearm, he9s
automatically, then and there, guilty of the offense of
possession post conviction.

13

MR. HXRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

If the government3s construction —-

If the firearm has ever moved in inter­

state comme rce ?
MR. HXRSCITKOP;
QUESTION:

Ever previously, yes, sir.

And that's basically what the government

says, although the government says, as a matter of grace,
we would give a little leeway for him to get rid of the
gun.
But how about if after his conviction, he possesses
a gun that he didn't possess before or at the time of his
conviction, if after his conviction he comes into possession
of a gun that has moved in interstate commerce, you wouldn't
concede that 'the statute covers that situation?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:
in all honesty.

I’m not sure of that, your Honor,

The problem there is the same thing I have

in differentiating between receipt and possession.

Any

receipt, even intrastate, shows a further movement of the
weapon.

Any receipt would show that.

Any coming into

possession after the conviction of a felony would show a
further movement of the weapon? there has to be an inherent
receipt there.

And so interstate commerce, albeit trans­

ferred to intrastate, will not have come to rest.
But pnce that gun comes to rest in the possession
of somebody — in this case, it was under a man’s bed —

MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Now, if possession has some kind of independent meaning

what does it mean in your submission?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Well, I believe among the things

it could mean, your Honor, is, if a. person receives the
gun — the instance you gave — after being convicted of a
felony, and the government can’t make a case on receipt,
because they can't show where he received —
QUESTION:

Where and when it was received.

MR. HIRSCHKOP:
As

QUESTION:

Of a gun that’s ever travelled in inter-

state commerce?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

No, that has travelled and come

15

into his possession after the time of his felony conviction.
That would be one of the reasons possession would be there,
to cover that particular loophole,
QUESTION:

You think the statute would cover that?

MR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Possession acquired after the conviction?

MR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir. -

I don’t understand: why wouldn’t that

be a receipt?
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

It would be a receipt, your Honor,

hut the government may have difficulty making a case based
on venue problems —
QUESTION:

Oh, I see, because you couldn’t prove

where and when it was received.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

I see.

Yes, sir.

Every possession is presumably preceded

by a receipt.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Preceded by it, yes, sir, but not

necessarily the same thing.

There are a couple of

circuit, at least, the Sixth Circuit, held it was identical,
with which we take exception.
QUESTION:

Well, receipt inevitably precedes

Yes, sir.

I assume no one is bom

It's the only way I could see it happening.

QUESTION:

Well, what about if a felon goes out to

the airport and picks up from air express six guns wrapped
up in a package?
MR» HIRSCHKOP :

At that moment;, he's guilty of the

offense of possession within an interstate commerce nexus,
t

yes, sir»
QUESTION:

Well, suppose it's delivered to him

outside of the gate of the airport?
MR» HIRSCHKOP:

As long ■— our -- my position would

be, your HOnor, as long as he receives that gun, after he‘s
convicted of a felony, and the gun has previously travelled
in interstate commerce, he was violating the statute»
QUESTION:

The possession?

MR» HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Regardless of when?

MR. HIRSCHKOPs

As long as it’s after the conviction

of the felony, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

But hte's got — a man is convicted of a
And he' gets a gun which travels in

interstate commerce 13 years ago.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

Is he guilty?

I think that would end up being a

factual determination that I can't broach at this time.
QUESTION:

These facts in my hypothetical are agreed

upon and in affidavit form.
MR. HIRSCHKOP:

If the gun came to him through any

17
contact with interstate, he would be guilty.

If the gun

came to him through commercial means, I assume interstate
will not have ended, and he would, be guilty of a possession
offense„
QUESTION:

Inother words, in answer to my brother

Marshall's question, you do not contend that the statute
means that the interstate commerce has to occur

after the

conviction in order to support the conviction for possession?
MR. RIRSCHKOP:

That’s correct, I do not take that

position, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Just the possession has to occur, for the

first time, after the conviction?
MR. RIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

In your submission?

MR. RIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Of a gun that’s ever moved in interstate

commerce?
MR. RIRSCHKOP:

As long as'it still moves in commerce,

whether intrastate or interstate, having previously moved in
interstate, the view I’ve taken is that the intrastate is
a continuation or extension of the interstate movement,
/

regardless of time, T guess.
I know only —
QUESTION:

May I just pause again?

MR. HIRSCHKOPs

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

I want to be sure I get this in mind „

Your point is that first possession after the
conviction for the felony, must — if you can prove that,
that proves the possession offense, if you get the
previous — previously having been in another state.
HR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

I believe it would, your Honor, yes.

Well, then, why is that any easier to

prove than the receipt offense?

Because if you could prove

when it was first received, couldn't you presumably prove
where it was first received?
HR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

Not necessarily, your Honor.

I see.

It's just the difference between

proving both when and where and proving when.
HR. HIRSCHKOP:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

It's pointed

out in a footnote? the respondents recognize that difficulty.
QUESTION;

A Smith £ Wesson revolver purchased in

Virginia has been in interstate commerce?
-HR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it has.

Need I prove any more than that?

HR. HIRSCHKOP:

Well, for possession, you’d have

to prove, as we take the position in this case, that he
received it prior — IFm sorry, subsequent to the time of his
conviction for a felony.

And the possession offense would

then occur at the moment he received it, or continuously
thereafter.

19

QUESTION:

Now, how in the world could you prove

that?
ME. HIRSCHKOP:

The government's very hard pressed

to make that kind of proof, no question, your Honor.

There

may be people with him at the time
QUESTION:

You don't stand out on the corner selling

handguns.
MR; HIRSCHKOP:
statutes, your Honor.

No, it's true of many criminal

There is that difficulty in proof.

But on the other taken, there is this question
of lenity and a strict construction of criminal statutes.
And I don't think the Court can make any great inferences,
given the legislative history of this particular statute.
I think the Court was eminently correct in the Bass case, in
the part thx-ee of the Bass case, and that —- that's the po­
sition the Court has to follow.

And that's exactly what the

Court did in the Barrett case.
QUESTION:

»

In the Barrett case, said, but that was

dicta.
MR. IIIRSCITKOP:

Well, Barrett treated it as dicta.

But even dicta ■—
QUESTION:

Well, that was a later case, wasn't it?

MR. HIRSCHKOP:
QUESTION;

Barrett’s a '76 case, yes, sir.

Under a different statute?

MR. HIRSCHKOP;

Yes, sir, 922.

It does cite Bass

20

for some propositions»
The only other thing I’d bring to the Court's
attention is the fact that the Courts of Appeals,, in variously
considering the Bass case, have, some of them, taken inde­
pendent views in support of the Bass case»
The Bell case in the 2nd Circuit is such a case»
Walker in the 7th Circuit crives some support to it also.
In fact, in the Walker case, in a footnote there, the Court
points out that a federal prosecution of a state offense
historically must be expressly authorized»
That’s one of the imderlying major problems in the
case, is that the — it is an offense that many, many
states specifically deal with,

disregard

an interstate

commerce nexus would int.i^de much on the province of the
states.
As the courts point out — several of the Courts of
Appeals, the Walker Court, the Bell Court — and as this
Court pointed out in Bass and Barrett, before such an intrusion
is made by the federal judiciary and the federal legislature,
there should be a very specific intent expressed, by the
federal legislature, to make such an intrusion.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. ALLEN, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
NR. ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I must confess that, from Nr. Hirschkop's comments,
I am a little confused myself as to exactly what his position
is with respect to the elements necessary for the possession
offense.

I assume that his position remains that from what

appears in his brief.
QUESTION;
is that the statute
MR. ALLEN:

Certainly, it's clear that his position
doesn’t apply to this case.
That is clear, your Honor.

The issue in this case is whether Section 1202(a)
of the Appendix at Title 18 prohibits a convicted felon
from possessing a firearm that has previously travelled
in interstate commerce, as we contend, or 'whether it only
prohibits a convicted felon from

possessing a firearm when

that firearm is moving in or is., a part of interstate commerce,
as I understand the petitioner to contend.
That issue is extremely important, to federal law
enforcement and the enforcement of the comprehensive gun
control legislation that Congress enacted in 1968, for the
f o1lowing re a sons.
QUESTIONS;

Would it also be

just as important if

the statute excluded — didn’t cover cases like this?

22

MR. ALLEN:
your Honor.

It would — that is the issue here,

It would be extremely important.

It xrould create,

in our view —
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but your —- what you've

stated is a much more broader -—- is a broader exclusion
than your colleague seems to
MR. ALLEN:

Well, as I xmderstand his position, your

Honor, the petitioner's construction in this case would, in
our view, create a substantial gap in the federal gun control
egisliition that was enacted,in 1968 .
QUESTION;

It is contrary —

Namely those who had possession prior

to his conviction for the felony?
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:
would he?

Those among others, your Honor.
Well, he woxildn't exclude any others,
'

MR. ALLEN:

Well, I believe his construction would

tend, at least as a practical, effect, to exclude a large
c ategorv of other individuals that Congress intended to
cover»
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

You mean the one he stated here orally?
Petitioner's construction, at least as

I understand it from his brief.

I!m not entirely clear

on his statement here orally.
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:

Okay.

Well, go ahead.

As this Court recognized in United States

23

v. Pass, the principal purpose of the entire gun control
statute that was enacted in 1963 was to keep firearms out
of the hands of convicted felons and other persons that
Congress classified as potentially dangerous or irresponsible.
QUESTION:

Of course, these firearms were in the

hands of the petitioner when he was not a convicted felon.
MR. ALLEN:

At least, according to his testimony,

your Honor.
QUESTION;

Well, that’s the proof in this case, isn’t

it?
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

That

is a fact, your Honor, that he —

That he possessed these firearms before

he’d been convicted of anything.
MR. ALLEN:

He also possessed them after he was

convicted of a felony, your Honor.
QUESTION:

It was a continuous possession then, I

sea.
MR. ALLEN:

That is right.

But as this Court

recognized in Barrett, the principal purpose was to keep
firearms out of the hands of convicted felons, whether
before or •—that is, out of the hands of felons who had
been previously convicted, as petitioner was in this case.
Petitioner's construction —
QUESTION;

Maybe we’re engaging in -- or

could

engage if we continue the colloquy — in doubletalk.

But

24
your view is that once there is a conviction, then auto­
matically he's guilty of this federal offense if he has in
his house a firearm.
HR. ALLEN:

Well, your Honor, I think that the rule

of reason would permit a construction of the statute which
gave

him reasonable time to relinquish possession without

being automatically in violation of the statute.

I think

that would be -QUESTION:

You don't think that would be the rule

of reason in criminal cases, do you?
QUESTION:
language.

Not when you’re talking about statutory

It either covers or doesn’t.
QUESTION:
HR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Ordinarily —
Fell —
•— after a verdict comes in, there is

some lapse of time before an accused is sentenced.

part of Title 4 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act of 1968. which this Court construed in Barrett, only
prohibits a convicted felon from receiving a firearm that
has previously travelled in interstate commerce, and only
then if he receives it after his felony conviction, or after
the effective date of the statute.

Strictly a question of statutory

And an important one, because not only would

petitioner's construction permit felons who had received
their firearms before their felony convictions or before the
effective date of the statute to retain possession of those

31
firearms, it would also, in a number of cases, permit felons
as a practical matter to possess firearms

to receive

firearms after their felony convictions and escape prosecution.

possession in Virginia.

And let us say that he was found in
That it was manufactured in

Connecticut, was shipped to Maryland in 1973, and was sold
to some other individual who subsequently lost it or it was
stolen from him.
Although those facts would demonstrate conclusively
that the individual had

received the firearm after his

felony conviction, and after the statute, and therefore was
clearly in. violation of Section 922 of Title 4, the government
may often not be able to prove where he received — when he —
where he received that weapon.

And since venue is a fact

to be proved, the individual could not be prosecuted for
that case.
In other words, petitioner*s construction would, as
a practical matter, permit felons to retain possession of
firearms whenever they managed to acquire the firearms in a

32
way that the place or time of acquiring them escaped
detection.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose the federal government

MR. ALLEN:

They could, your Honor, if the state —•

and the state authorities had a statute that prohibited that
conduct, and if the state authorities, for some reason or
other, wanted to prosecute him, they could do so.
But I think that Congress, in this case, perceived
that this statute was extremely important for federal interests.

That, it seems to me, is

unnecessary matter of proof, and certainly one that

is not required by the constitution,
Our construction of the scope of Section 1202
is based primarily on three considerations: first of all, the
1 anguage of the statute; second of all, the relationship

of Section 1202 with the entire schema of federal gun control
legislation; and third, the legislative history of SEction 1202,
which, notwithstanding Mr. Hirschkop's contention, we submit
unmistakably

demonstrates that Congress intended the broadest

possible scope to this Section.
Section 1202 by its terms prohibits any convicted
felon "nn other —- certatr; categories of dangerous individuals

34

from*, quote, punishes anyone who receives, possesses or
transports in commerce or affecting commerce,, any firearm.
Now, the phrase, in commerce or affecting commerce,
is admittedly not as clear as the statutory language in
Section 922, which this Court construed in United States
v. Barrett, which makes it unlawful for convicted felons
and certain other persons, quote, to receive any firearm
or ammunition which has teen shipped or transported in
interstate or foreign commerce.
Nevertheless, to the extent that the statutory
language of Section 2120(a) is a guide, we submit that it
points clearly to oux" construction.
First, the phrase, affecting commerce, which Mr.
Hirschkop has largely ignored, but which is also in Section
1202, is essentially a statutory term of art.

As we pointed

out in our brief, this Court has recognized the distinction
between legislation limited to activities in commerce, and an
assertion of Congress3 full commerce power so as to cover
all activity substantially affecting interstate commerce.
Congress has used the phrase, affect commerce or
affecting commerce, in a number

of statutes, which have

been interpreted to reach transactions involving products
after they have come to rest within a state.
In the Civil Rights Act — is one example that is
particularly constructive to this ease.

In SEetion 42 U.S.C.

35
— in 42 U.S.C. Section 2000(a)(c), the Civil Rights Act
defines, quote,, operations affecting commerce? to include
establishments a substantial portion of whose products,
quote, has moved in commerce .
The particular significance of that statute for this
case lies in the fact that Senator Long, the sponsor of
Section 1202, made specific reference in the legislative
history of Section 1202 to the Civil Rights Act and this
Court's decisions upholding the power of Congress, in
Senator Long's words, quote, to regulate matters affecting
commerce, net just to regulate interstate commerce itself.
Furthermore, if Congress had wanted to limit the offenses
sat forth in Section 1202 to conduct contemporaneous with
movement in interstate commarce, it clearly could have and
would have used language employed elsewhere in both the gun
control statute and other federal statutes which indicates
such a limitation.
For example, Section 922(j) of Title 4 of the Gun
Control Act makes it unlawful knowingly to receive, conceal
or sell a stolen firearm, quote, which is moving as, which
is a part of, or which constitutes interstate or foreign
commerce.
The language in Section 1202, we submit, is quite
raore broad.

It relates not only to firearms that are in

commerce, but those that are affecting commerce as well.

36

And in fact to construe section 1202(a) as
petitioner would construe it would be to read the term,
affecting commerce, out of the statute altogether.
Apart from the statutory language, the relationship
of Section

1202 to the entire scheme of federal gun

control legislation indicates that the possession offense
includes possession of firearms that have previously traveled
in interstate commerce, and it is not limited to possession
of firearms contemporaneous with interstate commerce movement.
As I mentioned at the outset, this Court, in Barrett,
recognized that the entire structure of the Gun Control
Act demonstrates that Congress sought broadly to keep firearms
away from the parsons Congress classified as potentially
dangerous and irresponsible.
Section 922(h) of Title 4 prohibits a convicted
felon of receiving a firearm after his felony conviction, and
after the date of the statute.

And as this Court indicated

in United Statas v, Bass, the receipt offense in Section
1202 has the same scope.
The only effect of adopting petitioner’s construction
of this statute would be that convicted felons would continue
to be prohibited, under Section 922, from acquiring firearms new firearms

after their felony conviction, but would

permit convicted felons to keep old firearms that they had
acquired before their felony convictions.

37

Furthermore, as I mentioned , even felons — even
convicted felons who received firearms after their felony
convictions, could not be prosecuted under petitioner's
construction if there was no way of proving when or where they
had acquired those firearms.
Hot only would that create an enormous loophole in
the scheme of the federal gun control statute, but there is
no conceivable reason why Congress would have intended
such a result.
There is no -— the act of receiving a firearm has
no inherently greater connection to interstate commerce than
the act of possessing a firearm.

A convicted felon may

receive a firearm long after that firearm has come to rest in
the state where he receives it.

And he would stil be

guilty under petitioner’s construction of violating both
Section 922 and Section 1202(a).
The act of receiving the weapon has no closer
nexus to interstate commerce than the act of possessing the
weapon which necessarily follows immediately after the rece ipt.
Furthermore, receipt is a terra which encompasses
conduct that goes far beyond any commercial transaction. You
can receive a weapon by gift or by stealing it.

true,
In shorty there is no basis for concluding that
Congress would have intended to make a distihction between
the proof required to show a nexus between the firearm and
interstate commerce for purposes of the receipt offense and
the proof that was necessary for the possession offense.
And certainly there's no basis in the language of the
statute for such a distinction* since the phrase, in commerce,
or affecting commerce, modifies both the offense of receiving
and possession in the statute.
Perhaps the most important consideration in terms
of the statutory scheme is that petitioner's construction would,
in effect, read the term, possession, completely out of the
statute.

your Honor, that is correct.

But in terms of the primary

purpose of the statute, which is to keep firearms out of the
hands of dangerous people, it’s completely inappropriate,
it seems to me, to construe the more inclusive term,

QUESTION:

Mr. Allen?

to that?
MR„ ALLEN:

Well, your Honor, there is a possible’

significance to that fact.

It is our primary contention

that the offense here is — that the term, in commerce or
affecting commerce,

encompasses a possession of any firearm

that has had some previous movement in interstate commerce.

to conclude that his

that his purchase in the course of

his possession of replacement parts for his gun in interstate
commerce would be a contemporaneous effect on interstate
commerce.

That, of course, is somewhat inconsistent with

our primary position, which is broader.
QUESTION t

That might even satisfy the test of the

Bell case, you’re suggestinn.
MR. ALLEN:

It might, your Honor, it might well.

I don't think there is — but 1 would emphasise that in our
view there’s just simply no rational basis for concluding
that the offense of possession in this statute dees not include
possession of firearms that have previously moved in inter­
state commerce.
The legislative history of this statute, it

seems

to me, more than anything, perhaps, demonstrates that
Congress was intending to prohibit the possession of firearms
by felons as broadly as possible.
Now, this Court in Bass concluded, not unreasonably,
that that history was not so clear as to demonstrate that there
was no' necessity for any showing in each case of any nexus
whatsoever between a firearm and interstate commerce, particu­
larly in view of this fact that the statute had language that

41
was ----- that specifically made reference to interstate
commerce.

But beyond that, since these firearms here were --

have been proven to have had a nexus with interstate commerce,
it seems to me the legislative history is quite clear that
Congress wanted to prohibit conduct as broad — prohibit
possession as broadly as possible.
Indeed, every word of the legislative history, or
every sentence, reflects a concern with possession, not
simply, as Mr. HXrschkop as suggested,
acquisition.

Possession was

ownership or

obviously what Congress was

after.
In summary, your Honor, petitioner’s construction
is completely at odds with the language of Section 1202, the
purpose of Section 1202 as reflected in the entire statutory
scheme, and the legislative history of Section 1202.
His constx'uction would create an enormous loophole
in the statute, a loophole which would frustrate Congress’
primary purpose in enacting this entire gun control
legislation.
Thank you very much, your Honors, if there are
no further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP J. H1RSCHKOP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER.
MR. HIRSCHKOP%

Your Honor, on the question of

petitioner’s construction with regard to a weapon that has
not yet come to rest. I suggest to the Court, it is the
only way you can harmonise the Bass and Barrett decisions
with any present position.
It was raised — and the reason I took the position
—- by the position taken by then-Judge Stevens in the
Walker case, we expressed surprise on the scope of receipt.
If you limit the interstate commerce nexus to a present
nexus on possession, he says there, well, receipt may be too
broad.
What’s inherent, I think, in Justice Marshall's
opinion in Bass is that if a gun is still moving, once
having started in interstate commerce, interstate commerce
will flow until the gun comes to rest.

And so receipt goes

farther than possession does, is the only way I think you
could differentiate the two, and I believe he did that.
I have to point out, in this case, my client was
convicted of four revolvers ~ four weapons, one of which
had an 1880 date of interstate commerce.

MR. HIRSCHKOPs

They would if we knew that the

jury did.

They had four weapons before them.

And that's

the problem with the stock that Justice Power raises.

In

fact, the evidence in the case was, that that weapon had
been given to his father to sell prior to the time of this
conviction, and he had gotten that part just for his father.
But you get a de minimus connection» because if
someone buys bullets, does that make the weapon in interstate
commerce, ox* a scope or a sight or cleaning oil, or what
have you.
I can only suggest in closing that in Bass, Justice
Marshall quotes Justice Holmes in a case in which he cites,
at footnote 15, that when people go out to buy guns, there's a
difference between people going out to commit murder.

They

look for guidance very often in the statute.

QUESTION;

Mr. HIrschkop, perhaps the

moral to be

drawn from this dilemma that8s posed is, that when a man is

Honor, because conviction of a felony carries With it a
