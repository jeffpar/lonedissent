Commission.
Mr. Pascal, I think you may proceed whenever you ar©
ready *
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER PASCAL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS“APPELLANTS
MR. PASCAL:

Mr, Chief Justice and may it pleas© the

Court:
This case raises the constitutionality of a 19S9
amendment to the Naw York Stock Transfer Tax which discriminates
against interstate commerce by taxing stock transactions in­
volving sales of stock outside New York far more heavily than
similar transactions involving sales within the Stata of New
York.
Our clients, the plaintiffs-appellants in this cas©,
are the principal stock exchanges in tha United States located
outside the State of New York, located in the States of
Massachusetts, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio.

Thase exchanges

compete, Your Honors, with stock exchanges located within th©
State of New York and indeed with each other to provide
efficient, fair and orderly markets for th© purchase and sal©
of securities,
Indeed, th© Securities Act Amendments of 197 5

4
recognize explicitly the public interest -and fair competition
among exchange markets to provide the fair and orderly markets
that I have referred 'to.
In the record of this case, there is evidence, albeit
not at a trial, in a legislative history of section 270-a, of
competition in specific securities.

In 1968, the year in

which this statute was passed, 88 percent of the share trading
on the exchanges who are plaintiffs her© was in securities
listed on the Maw Zyork stock Exchange.

In 1968, that same

year, and prior to that time, the Governor and Legislature of
Mew York perceived what I -would suggest as a peril, a competi­
tive peril of what one legislative witness characterized as
th® "competitive problems from non'-New York exchanges." In
1968, New York reacted to that peril by enacting a statute
which added section 270-a to th® Mew York Stock Transfer Tax.
In his message of approval, the Governor cited —
and I am quoting again — "th© greatly expanded capacity of
the regional exchanges to challenge th® New York exchanges
for business."

Regional exchanges are what people in the

business in New York call exchanges outside of New York.
Th© Governor also stated that section 270-a had as
another of its purposes to provide — and I am quoting again -“’long-term relief from some of the competitive pressures from
outsids the state."

Th© non-New York exchanges filed suit in

th© N©w York stata courts — in th© state courts because of th©

5
sntitax injunction statuta — for a declaration that section
270-a was repugnant to the convmarca cl&us© and other clauses
of the Unified Statas Constitution.

Th© defendants named war®

%

th® state agency charged with enforcing that statute,'collect­
ing th© tax and th© members of th© agency.
The trial court denied a motion to dismiss, which
was th® defendants1 response to the complaint, and under New
York procedure that denial

of the motion to dismiss was ap­

pealable as a matter of right, was appealed, and the Appellat®
Division of th© New York Suprema Court reversed, order th©
complaint dismissed, and th® New York Court of Appeals affirmed
that dismissal, holding section 270-a to be constitutional and
not to violata th® commerce clause and other clauses of the
Constitution under which it was challenged in th© complaint.
This case is here on appeal.
The question presented here, Your Honors, is whether
a state, tax on sal©, transfer or delivery of securities —
stocks in this case — which discriminates on th© basis of
whether the sale portion of a taxable transaction takes place
Inside or outside th© State of New York violates th© commerce
clausa, especially where, as her©, it is uncontested, indeed
proclaimed by the defendants, that the avowed purpose and th©
actual effect of the statutes was to confer a state created
advantage on local stock exchanges at the expense of their
out-of-state competitors.

6
QUESTIONS

The challenge her© is only on the com­

merce clausa, is it?
MR. PASCAL:
QUESTION;

That's correct.
Whatever ©Isa is relied on in the state

court# is that it?
MR. PASCAlis

That's correct.

We have dropped the

other two claims in th© complaint which were the privileges
and immunities clause and th© equal protection clause.
The discrimination which I have been referring to,
Your Honors, was I would suggest a direct result of New York's
reaction to the peril of competition, and th© mechanism of
discrimination was tc add two tax reductions in two large
areas — and I say large because vary little is left of the -pr©1
1960 schem© after th© addition of these two areas.
The first was th® inclusion in section 270-a of a
new limited or maximum tax of $3 50.

Actually, it was mor®

than $3 50 when it was pas sad, but it was gradually reduced to
$350 by the year 1973.

Sine© 1973, therefor©, no matter how

many shares of stock on© sells, on® is subject to a maximum
tax of $3 50 if and only if — this is th© only variable — th©
transaction takes place, the sale part of th® transaction on
the stock exhenag© takzv; place inside the state and not out­
side .
Th© second aspect of section 270-a which w© suggest
discriminates openly on the basis of only where the sal© takas

7
place is a new, what I have chosen to refer to as a non­
resident discount., whereby non-residents of the State of Maw
York pay precisely by 1973 am sine© that time ona-half the
tax they would pay if they were to execute their transactions,
that, is make their sales inside New York — I'm sorry, 'they
pay half as much if they execute inside New York, as if they
sell their securities outside New York.
QUESTION;

Mr. Pascal, sometime during your argument

are you going to treat the effect of the enactment of section
28(d) of the Securities Act?
MR. PASCAL;

Yes.

In fact, let m© move to that

right now, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

Section 28(d), which is

referred t© in our reply brief as well as the appellees brief,
had the effect of making transfers by registered 'transfer
agent, non-taxable.

The legislative history of 28(d) is that

it was an accident, as we pointed out in our jurisdictional
statement but did not repeat, in our briefs.

The Congress did

not intend, nor did 'die President intend in signing it, to re­
duce the impact of idle® section about which we are complaining.
Th© President made the statement that he was signing remedial
legislation and btoh Houses of Congress, 'the Chairman of th©
appropriate committees ma.de similar statements.
The fact is that, the remedial legislation has not
occurred as we stand here right now, and it obviously will not
during this session of Congress.

But section 28(d) clearly

8
doas not moot the case*
Humber one., th© appellees themselves — certainly I
can speak for the appellants, they don’t think it has been
mooted or we would have so advised the Court,
QUESTION:

But whether or not it moots it, it con­

ceivably could have an effect on th© burden that th® New York
tax doss put on commerce?
MR, PASCAL:

That's true, Mr, Justice Rahnquist, if

there is just on© registered transfer agent in New York, it
will reduces th© number of transactions that would otherwise be
taxable and subject to this

discrimination.

There are cer­

tain categories, however, that ar© completely unaffected,
for example deliveries to people living in Mew York, the large
institutional purchasers, sellers of securities, deliveries
by and to such parsons ar® unaffected.
The appellees themselves hav© included I think ap­
propriately in Appendix C in their brief, which consists of
the opinion of their counsel, Mr, Crotty -- this is counsel to
th© State of New York Department of Taxation and Finance,
quoting at page 31 of the appellees ’ brief, Mr, Crotty .says —
this is an opinion dated December 1, 1975, in discussing the
impact of the 1975 amendments, I think generally quite ac­
curately:

"However, where a sal©, agreement to sell, memorandum

of sale, or any other delivery or transfer takes place in New
York State, the stock transfer -tax due and owing thereon must

9

be paid.w

He is

tailing us that wherever transfers continue

to taka place and non-register@d transfer agents, whenever
that© is a delivery, the same section 270-a and the rest of
the stock transfer tax continues to apply.
So I would suggest that certainly Mr. Crotty, who
has given whafc is a fairly brief but concise and definitive
opinion of the New York Department of Taxation and Finance,
of which, by the way, the defendant commission in this case
is a part,

1 think he can be taken at his word, and I don't

think w© really have a dispute as to how 28 (d) operates or the
impact of s@ctt.ion 270-a after th© 1975 amendments.
question:

Mr. Pascal, would you give an example or

two of the deliveries of securities in New York that would not
b® affected by th® amendment of the Act of '3 4 but would still
ba covered by th© New York statute?
MR. PASCAL?

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell.

I might ba

basically trying to summarize on® or two examples given on
page 8 of cur yellow reply brief.

But th© on© that wa giv®

first and the on® that I think is somewhat classic is an ex­
ample of a New York life insurance company purchasing securi­
ties.

It is. either required by law to have a custodial agree­

ment or to take possession of those securities.

It is required,

in other words, this hypothetical, New York Institutional
Investor Life Insurance Company, the example I have given, to
«►

take possession of those securities.

When it takes possession,

10
whether it takes possession from a registered transfer agent
or from its own broker, the more delivery is taxable under the
transfer tax now, as always,.
QUESTION;

So even after the transfer, which would

be exempt under the transfer on feh® books by the transfer
agant, would be exempt under the federal act if the securities
in the name of the life insurance company were delivered to
it in Nsw York, that would bs a taxable transaction?
MB. PASCAL;

That is correct.

the situation right now.

That is precisely

A delivery is an important ©vent

and it is on© that occurs frequently in New York and it is
one that persists, and it is one that persists particularly
with regard to the large institutional investors in New York.
In fact, I would suggest, wholly aside from mootness, and
©ven in terms of the significance of the fact, in terms of
the kinds of considerations that, the Court normally gives at
the beginning of a case, in noting jurisdiction, that hasn't
changed one bit.
We have on the books in New York, in the New York
Court of Appeals right now, a d@ci.sion with, in a state of
enormous economic power, a very far-reaching decision that
condones a discriminatory tax scheme I think unlike anything
class to anything the Court has ever dealt with and found to
pass constitutional muster under the commerce clause.
The appellees refer to fch® extensive regulations

11
promulgated by th© defendants under transfer tax.

They &ra

indeed extensive, but I would direct the Court’s attention to
section 440.1(1)(12), a rather simple regulation, which just
lists the number of different types of taxable transactions
and, in further answer to Mr. Justice Powell's question, one
of those types of transactions is th© delivery of a certificat© by the transferor or his agent
to the transferes or his agent.
QUESTION?

meaning his broker —

That is unchanged.

Well, what -type of transaction gets the

benefit of th© new 29(c) then?
MR. PASCAL;

Well, the transaction where, for ■ex­

ample , I suppose -- and I would suggest, Mr. Justice Brennan,
that this was not intended, but. it probably is the effect
right now — th® -transaction where delivery is not mad© in
New York, that is scan© part of th© transaction takes place
there, but it is made outside New York, where no delivery is
mad© at all, or delivery is mad© to I suppose a registered
depository or clearing agency.

But if delivery is mad®, that

part is unchanged, and I would add -that th® policing of th©
transfer tax is don© through the brokers in New York.

So,

again, you can see how th® delivery still is something the
state can and doss get at and, according to the appellees 1
brief and Mr. Grotty’s opinion, intends to get at.
QUESTION;

Have w© any Idea of the proportion of

transactions in which there ©re deliveries that subject to the

12
•tax and the proportion not subject to the tax outside New
York?
MR. PASCAL:

Do you mean after the impact of section

28 (d)?
QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR. PASCALS

No, I don't think we do.

Indeed, I

think you can tell from the date of Mr. Grotty's opinion,
December of last year, things ware still being worked out
until fairly recently, and th© record in this case has been
frozen for a few years.

There is certainly nothing in the

record, and I really cannot add anything to it,
QUESTION;

Mr. Pascal, do you think our decision in

the Hughes case of last year has any bearing on this?

Are you

familiar with that case?
MR. PASCAL:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmim, I am,

I think

it has bearing in the sense, that while the Court and the
opinion of the Court purports to ba confronting a situation of
first impression, according to the language of the opinion of
th© Court, and as reemphasised by Mr. Justice Stevens' concur­
ring opinion, and that situation of first impression is not
present hers.

Th® Court does reinforce what I would call som©

very steady consistent verities regarding discrimination
against interstate censnare©.
I think that the Court itself in Hughes made clear
that it was dealing with a situation involving the state

13
itself, the. States of Maryland in Hughes, really becoming the
entrepreneur, if you will, and bidding up the pric® of hulks.
I think, taking the language of the Court, which in the
majority opinion said "Until today fch© Court has not been
asked to hold that th® entry by th© stata its®If into th®
market as a purchaser" —- and it goes on to talk about th©
bidding up on hulks -- I think that distinguishes the case by
itself, Mr. Justic® Blackmun, because th@r@ is no suggestion
her® that that is what has .been done.
Indeed,

I would suggest that the State of New York

could have, if th© N®w York exchanges and their continued
presence in New York war® so important to the state and its
continued economic viability, it could easily have don© some­
thing like the State of Maryland did.

It could have decided

to subsidize by cash subsidies, as Mr. Justic® Stevens sug­
gested, or by real ©stata tax rabat®.

It could have don®

something that would not have impeded interstate commarce.
What it couldn't do was pass a statute the whole purpose of
which was to in

tss&ncs shift tha economic burden of keeping

the exchanges located in New York to their out-of-state com­
petitors , which is precisely th© economic effect of what th®
State of New York did her®.
The defendants and the Court of Appeals, th© New
York Court of Appeals have offered us what I would suggest
ar© som© excuses for th© result reached in tha Court of

14
Appeals and for s@sti.osi 27Q~a rather than avoidances, if you
will.

That is, thar® is nowhere in the Court of Appeals,

indeed to fcha contrary, it is assumed that section 270-a does
creat® a discrimination.

I don’t think that is an issue her©.

One excuse suggested by the defendants but really
not by the Court, of Appeals is that somehow you can split up
the various elements of ‘the transaction.

I don’t think that

-that is a viable theory, nor has it been for quite a long
time, at least since Nippert v. Richmond and cases of that
kind, where the Court discussed the breadth of the mind of
man in devising ways of fragmenting a transaction.
The motivation of protecting th® local business is
something on which we can agree.

I would suggest that ever

since Baldwin v. Seelig, the Halliburton Oil Well Co. v,
R@ily, Nippert v, Richmond, the kind of discrimination we
have here, whether it is tax imposed discrimination or regu­
latory imposed discrimination, it makes no difference.

Indeed,

Freeman v. Hewit, on© of the cases cited by defendants, sug/

created that the tax type of discriminatory barrier could be
worse.
I think that was reinforced in Mr. Justice Brennan's
opinion in Great Atlantia & Pacivic v. Cottrell last term also,
in which the Court said that a state cannot ©rect economic
barriers to protect local business from competition.'

I think

that is one of tha verities which I was referring to that

15
won't fly here.
What do we have here?

Ws have statements in the

briefs and motion to dismiss by the appellees that the pur­
pose of section 270"a was to protect a major industry, to
protect and preserve the state's securities industry, and. this
one, to make New York the financial canter of the world.

That

is proclaimed in the-, motion to dismiss to be on© of the pur­
poses of section 27 0-a.
QUESTION:
MR. PASCAL:

They didn’t think it already was?
I suppos® they wanted to secure their

position, Mr. Justice Relinquish, and that is what is wrong
with the statute.
Tha Court of Appeals also suggested that the — and
I must say it is an argument that is somewhat unique, so one
cannot cite a string of cases

the Court of Appeals sug­

gested that the state was free to discriminate among different
types of interstate transactions, that what was really being
don© here was discrimination among all kinds of — a. number
of transactions, all of which were interstate.
Of course, we can go to

alliburton to see -that in

almost every case where that kind of situation occurred, where
you had a discriminatory tax ©r regulatory burden, you could b©
comparing cases, all of which had interstate elements.

What

is important her©, and what I think is really again undisputed,
is that her© w© have a situation where the discrimination

16
operates based oa whether a particular very important element
of tha transaction occurs inside or outside th® state.
Again, the Court of Appeals suggests — and this
relates also to th© protection of local business' point —
that it can neutralize th© advantages of th© place of origin,
that is since New York has already imposed a tax, they can
even up the odds, as it were, with th© out-of-state businesses.
That precis© language virtually is what is used by th© Court
in Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig to say that you can't do it, and
it was reinforced in Halliburton.

Having imposed th© tax,

New York might subsidise its businesses, it might grant tax
.rebates, it could do a lot of things to help local business,
but it couldn't n@utra.liz© tha advantages of. the other states
and tha securities markets located —
QUESTIONS

impose a-burden on those states of

origin?
MR. PASCAL*
QUESTION:
MR. PASCAL:

They couldn't do it by —
On the states of origin.
They couldn't do it, exactly.

And

finally there is a suggestion in the Court of Appeals argu­
ment that the practical effect — that is a quote of a phrase
1 believe from Bast v. Maxwell — the practical affect of th©
tax is somewhat ds minimis because New York residents ar®
likely to execute their transactions within New York.

That,

of cours®, is not only not barn© out by th® record, but it

17
flies directly in the face of th® legislative history of
those who passed it.

Th® very assumption of section 270-a

was that with a modern age,- with modern telecommunications
and computer systems, where everybody has access to the vari­
ous markets instantaneously, and where th® instantaneous com­
munication may gain, especially a large institutional seller
such as exist in New York- a particular advantage 'that all
markets were open to everybody and therefor© to suggest that,
as a practical matter, the New York institutions and other
sailers or buyers of securities would stay in New York because of geographic opinquity is something that is absolutely
unsupported, in fact belied by th© record.
QUESTION;

Do these -- do th® jurisdictions in

v/hich these regional exchanges operate impose no local transfer
taxes whatsoever?
MR. PASCAL:
fact,

That's correct, none of them do.

In

X think th© only other state in the Union which might

impose a transfer tax similar to New York's is Florida, and
I am not oven sure of that one right now.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Bush, you may pro-*

cead whenever you ar® ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. BUSH, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDAM'S-APPELLEES
MR. BUSH;

Mr. Chief Justic® and my it pleas® the

Court:
w© should like to emphasis® at the outset that this
review constitutes in our judgment on® of the most historic
cases that has com© before this Court, because it actually
means th® economic and fiscal solvency of the State of New
York together with that of the City of New York.
QUESTION:

Just this on® tax will do all of that?

ME. BUSH:

Well, part of this tax is earmarked to

guarantee to th© Municipal Assistance Corporation of th® City
of New York the federal loans "which Congress has authorised
to th® city and to th© big so-called "Big Mae" corporation
under legislation that —

aggregate amount of the tax shown in th® record?
MR. BUSH:

What was the —

MR. BUSH:

Well, it is in th® neighborhood of $200

million annually, although the volume has decreased since th©

20
enactment of 28(d) Iasi; year of tbs SEC Act.
QUESTIONS

That is what your friend is complaining

about, that that is a pretty heavy burden on interstate commerce,
isn't it?
MR. BUSES

Well, we don't think there is any burden

here whatsoever, Your Honor.

As a matter of fact, the tax

does not operate outside of. 'fell© State of Mew York.

There is

no extra territorial tax imposed whatever either upon these
plaintiffs or upon any of the shareholders who do not sail or
buy or sell their securities in the State of New York.
The only tax that is imposed are for those local
transactions involving sales aryl transfers occurring within the
State of Mew York.

Of course, these plaintiffs, as competing

stock exchanges, are not taxed at all upon any business that
is transacted on any one of those exchanges.
only if

The fax occurs

- m'© is a sale within the City of New York on on® of

our New York exchanges or whater there is a transfer made

That will ba the effect of 28(d)?

MR. BUSH;

28(d) would I think reduce it

some.*

where around $60 or $70 million a year.
QUESTIONS

To about $130 million?

MR. BUSHs

Somewhere in there.

Now, in the committee

report to the Big Mac assistance act of last year, Public Law
94“143, there is a table or index accompanying that Senate
report which shows the annual yield during 1975 or the fiscal
year ending last — in '75.
QUESTION;

Well, do you think the interstate com-

merce argument would be different in this case, Mr. Bush, if,
instead of earmarking the tax proceeds for Big Mac, they ear­
marked it to raise Governor Carey's salary to $5 million a
year?
MR. BUSH;

Prior to '68, Your Honor, the reverne from

this tax went into the general state treasury.

At the same

time this 290-a was passed, the revenue was transferred to the
City of New York for general purposes, and than during the
fiscal crisis the revenues earmarked to guarantee to the
federal government for fch® loans borrowed by the city, would
be backed up in part by the revenue from th© stock transfer
tax, along with ether revenue.
QUESTION;

other than your inspection fee type case,

have our interstate commerce burden decisions ever given any
iuatim;

a

that th© purpose for which the state uses . the

22
proceeds of the tax affect the determination as to whether or
not it burdens interstate commerce?
MR. BUSEs

Wall, my recollection of reading those

cases, it varies from tax to tax.

As long as the money is

used for a public purpose by a state or on© of its municipali­
ties and is a legitimate function of government* it seems to
ra© that a judicial adjustment has to be made case by case with
the natera of the tax involved and the revenue used for which
the proceeds may ba put.
QUESTION:

Well, does tha federal question turn on

how worthy we. regard the cause to which the proceeds are put?

don’t think that the —■

a good purpose and that all taxas of money that the state

MR. BUSH:

I would assume so.

MR. BUSH:

Well, I don't think that the Constitution

com•mplates, especially in this case, the death nail of the
sovereign State of N@w York through fiscal collapse, which

help you.
MR. BUSH:

Wall, it is cur position, Your Honor, that

the statute is not infirm constitutionally.
QUESTION:

QUESTIONS

And we will assume that New York needs

MR. BUSH?

W© need it desperately, no question about

the money.

it.

But I mention this public assistance because at the same

time that was passed last year, the Congress had before it the
consideration of th© amendments to the SEC Act, on® of which
was this amendment 28(d), but that did not divest the State of
New York of its taxing power in other areas on transactions
within th© State of New York in the sal® of securities.

28(d)

t

merely limited the tax or exempted th© tax for transfers within
the state of New York, not on other types of transactions with­
in th© state.

That power was not affected by Congress whatso­

ever .
Now, I don't really — the question was asked earlier
about th© relevancy of this Hughes decision that was handed
down last June.

As I read the opinion there, it constitu­

tionally was sustained because it was a legitimate purpose of
th© State of Maryland for th© protection of its environment to
do something about ridding itself of those junk automobiles.
If it is important from an environmental point

of

view to preserve the State of Maryland, I think for the same
reason it is important to the State of New York for its
economy to remain wholesome for the same reasons.

And that

the cases relied upon by th© plaintiffs here were all reviewed
and passed upon in the Hughes opinions of last spring, and also

25
in the earlier case of the Atlantic & Pacific Company cas®
that was handed down the. first part of last year.

The cases

relied upon therein are precisely th© same as thos© which are
relied upon by the plaintiffs here.
Now, in the A&P cas©* this Court found that the very
same cases were controlling as to the facts there involved.
But when it. cam© to the Hughes cas® four or five months later*
the same cases were rejected by the majority her©.

So that

our position is that all of these cases the plaintiffs cite
have got to h® distinguished upon th@ir facts and upon the
legal principias involved.
Mow, some of thos© involve a license to engage in
interstate commerce* which has been forbidden under the com­
merce clausa* or there was a gross receipts tax on the gross
proceeds from interstate commerce, and others involved other
types of situation.
Mow* none of thos© cases are in point her® because we
are not. licensing anyone here and w© are not. imposing upon a
privilege for someone to engage in sales transactions within
the State of New York.

Every stockholder in this country is

free to sell and buy and sell his stock on any exchange.

The

tax is only applied by New York where there is a sal® within
the State of New York or a subsequent transfer within the state
by a corporate transfer agent.
Unless thos© ©vents occur*, no tax is paid by anybody*

26
regardless of where the sal© may foa made, whether it is on
plaintiffs! exchanges or off the counter or over-the-counter
type of transaction.

And it seems ironic to ns -that the

plaintiffs ar© complaining that the competitive standing of
our New York state stock exchanges in comparison to theirs
and that the state ought to offer bounties or subsidies to our
own exchanges; similar to what was done in the Hughes situation?
merely bags the question.

New York has don® something to

equalize the competitive standing and it did so by the enact­
ment of the special tax inducement provision of section 270-a
of the tax law, to encourage out-of-state investors to continua
to ©agag© within the State of Maw York? and they offered non­
resident citizens a tax reduction in order to do that, and it
offered on the other hand the large block sale investors
special tax inducements if they traded within the State of New
York.
■Eowavarthey ar© still free 'to trade anywhere where
there, is a market for them.

And wa don't think that is any

burden upon interstate commerce.

In fact, it is a direct in­

ducement to engage in interstate commsrc©.
Now, the plaintiffs concede in their briefs submitted
here that the state has the taxing power to impose this tax.
They only complain because we reduced the tax.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bush, might I interrupt you?

MR. BUSH:

Yes, sir.

21
QUESTION;

Am I correct, though in understanding -that

there is on© rat© of tax paid if the transaction is over the
exchange and a different rat© if it is not, if it is over the
New York Stock Exchange?
MR* BUSH;

If it is don© within the Stata of New

York, we offer non-residents a reduced tax, if they sell within
the State of New York,
QUESTION;

Over the New York Stock Exchange?

MR. BUSH;

Over the New York State residents.

New

York State residents, if they do business within our exchanges,
they ar© taxed at the former rata, at a higher rate.
QUESTION;

How much difference in rat© is there?

MR. BUSH;

Well, it is a graduated, beginning back in

'68, down through *73, roughly now 50 percent less for out-ofstat© non-residents,
QUESTION;

Well, now is your defense ~ it is the

differential than, depending — now, what is your defens©

MR. BUSH;

Our stock transfer tax, we argue, is at

the end of commerce, it is upon a sale or a transfer occurring
within the Stata of New York after com-aerce has come to an and,
bat is not a direct burden on the flow of that commerce within
the State of New York.

We take the position that commerce has

ended, the flow has ended and ceased and that the final act of

28

sal® or transfer within the State of New York is purely a
incident which the Court has sustained in the past against a
constitutional tact as a burden —
QUESTIONS

And what is the reason for differentiating

than for having two different levels of tax?
MR. BUSH:

Merely as an inducement to bringing the

out-of“State business into the State of New York.
QUESTION;

It is intended to affect cut-of-state

business then?
MR. BUSH:

Well, you mean affected by keeping it out

of the state or bringing it in?
QUESTION:

Is it intended to change the way in which

out-of“State business would be done but for this particular tax
schema?
MR. BUSH:

Well, the tax has no extra territorial

effect if there is no later transfer within the State of New
York.

If th® sale is mad®, say, on a Chicago exchange, the tax

is not imposed on that.

It. is only if that stock is thereafter

transferred within the state by a corporate transfer agent that
the local tax is imposed on th© 'transfer, but no tax is imposed
on an out-of-state sale.
QUESTION:

But is it correct that the act of the

transfer agent generates one tax if th© prior sale was made
over th© Chicago exchange and a different tax if it is generated
over th© Hew York exchange?

29
MR. BOSHs

That's right.

QUESTION?

So there is th© discrimination, but you

say it is not a burden — now , why is it not a burden again?
Doesn’t it tend to discourage transactions over the Chicago
axch&ng© by companies, in stock of companies that have transfer
agents in New York?
MR. BUSH:

That is th® allegation mad© by th© plain-”

QUESTION:

Wall, what is your answer to th® allega­

tiffs.

tion?

That is what I haven’t quite understood.

That happens,

doesn’t it?
MR. BUSH:

Wall, I think it dome happen, but th© SEC

has reported that th© volume goes up every year anyway, so th©
tax itself I don’t think has that, much of an adverse effect
upon, say, a regional exchange located in Chicago.
QUESTION:

What did tha Mew York Legislature indicate

was th© purpose,along th© lines ©f Justice Stevens 3 question?
MR. BUSH:

The purpose was to retain th© Mew York

state stock exchanges within the City of New York which at that
time were threatening to move out of state because they could
not afford to continue business within th© state, and that is
part of our legislative history which is shown in our brief
and also is. th© jurisdictional statement.

And as an inducement

to keeping those exchanges within New York, it was agreed upon
by the City of New York, the State Legislature, th© Governor’s

30
office &nd the New York Stock Exchange that something had to
be done and one means of doing it xvas to reduce the tax for
future years on this type of trans actions, and as a consequence
■the exchanges agreed to stay within New York.
New, tdie effect of their leaving New York would have
meant; loss of millions of dollars in local taxes which they had
been paying up to then to the city, the loss of employees and
the taxes engendered by them, and plus the rents and every­
thing ©Is© x-7hich are involved in the operation of these ex­
changes .
Of course, New York City has been fee financial center
4

of the world.

It is recognised by th© Congress and the

amendatory acts passed last year with respect to th© SEC amend­
ments that are

involved hare, all of which were enacted to

preserve New York City as a financial center, not to embarrass
it nor to impede its growth, but to retain it for the purposes
of having adequate financial interests in the city and to
provide the capital and everything ©Is© it needed in the grow­
ing economy.
QUESTION;

Mr. Bush, before this reduction in tax, was

th© old rata such a burden an transfers on th© exchange that
th© exchanges war© suffering and this is why they wanted to

MR. BUSH:

Hopefully it •would bring in additional

business into Hew York.
QUESTION;

Was one of the reasons it was losing busi­

ness that New York imposed a tax on transactions on th© New
York exchange and th® other stabas didn't impose taxes on
transactions on their exchanges?
MR. BUSH:

Y©s, ws had two exchanges, th© New York

Stock and th© Annex Exchange, both dealing with different listed
securities, but the -transfer tax was involved with both ex­
changes for all -transactions on those two exchanges.
Now, in our legislative history that we have appended
to our brief we show th© economic statistics that are involved
up to 1960 and th® concern that was expressed by th© State of
New York if this business would be lost to it.
QUESTION:

Well, what analogy do you draw to Judge

H&chtler's opinion, in th© Court of Appeals?

It rests at ©ns

point, as I read it, kind of on the us© tax analogy.

32
MR. BUSEs

Well, that was the argument: that we were

making in the court below, that the transfer tax was similar to
a local sales or us© tax in the City of New York, and which
has been constitutionally sustained in the past.
How, the thrust of plaintiffs * argument changes from
court to court as wa proceed with this litigation.

As w® read

the briefs that war© filed in the courts below, their constitu­
tional thrust on the interstate commerce question was not to
themselves but to some stockholders or some investor who they
were claiming was being jeopardized.

Now, it is their own

business primarily that they are aiming this constitutional -~
QUESTIGNs

Well, it would ba a poor lawyer who,

MR. BUSH:

not embarrassed by that.
every stage.

That's right.

And w© are

We I think have met this head-on at

As I say, to repeat my self, w© don't see that

there are any undue, unfair burdens imposed upon interstate
commerce at all, ©specially here where non© of these plaintiffs
pay any tax at all and don't have to because our statute
doesn't reach out to their exchanges.
QUESTION:

I suppos® in Gibbers v. Ogden that New

York could have argued that they needed the revenues as much
as you do here.
MR. BUSH:

Well, in Gibbons and that line of case,

Your Honor, I think that was more in the nature of a license

33

fee, for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce or
that no on© was free to do it unless they had a permit to do
it.

Wa don't impose any such requirement her© to engage in

the stock transactions.

Everyone is fra© to sell at any ex­

change, regardless of where he — so long as ‘that stock may b©
listed on our regional exchange.

Limited by that, a stock-

holder is free to pick any plaintiff Es exchange to buy or sell
the stock.

The problem becomes one if h© has to transfer it

within the Stata of New York and the corporate transfer agent
is located here, the stock goes to New York to that agent to b®
transferred on the corporate books of th© company in whose
stock is issued, but even that is going to be eliminated under
these SEC amendments because the recommendations are net to
eliminate all stock certificates altogether and put it on a
computerized tape situation, and if and when that occurs then
there will b® fewer paper transactions involving th© transfer
of stock certificates.
QUESTION i

What about the deliveries that are

affected by your —
MR. BUSH:

Well, Your Honor, I think counsel —

QUESTION:

Institutional deliveries.

MR. BUSH:

~ counsel I think has misread that ruling

of th© counsel for the tax department.

It is limited to the

specific statutory provisions of 28(d) of th© SEC Act, and all
he is doing is rephrasing that languag®, and it says either

34
delivery or transfer within the state of New Yorkf so those
two types of transactions are now limited by 28(d)*

.Any other

t

type of transaction is still subject to the tax.

And the com­

mittee reports that recommended this legislation was clear to
male® clear to the Congress that they were not intending to
divest the Stats of New York of any other additional taxing
power that it might have, commerce or otherwise.

And they

recognized; I am sure? that the transfer tax was merely a
local tax which this Court has held in the past on certain
local taxable incidents occurring within the State of New York.

QUESTION:

Isn’t it?

'\MR. BUSH:

Y\

Isn’t it?

-- our revenue has fallen off in r-acent

years from what it was back at the time this thing was first
passed, I know that, as a matter of fact, although our record
\

her© does not clearly reflect -that.

For example, this table

that was submitted with Public Law 94-143, the Big Mac assistance
thing, shows estimated transfer taxes to the City of New York,
on Appendix ht in -th.© neighborhood ©f $184 million, which is
substantially less than the amount that we estimated back at the

38
time this lav? suit was started, which was in the neighborhood
of $250 million.

So it has fallen off significantly and no

doubt will as time goes on, especially if this 28 (d) is not
modified in some way next year by the next Congress.
QUESTION:

Are you taking the position, Mr. Bush,

that the congressional act her© makes this cas© one less
worthy of our consideration?
MR. BUSH;

I think it does, sine© this legislation

was enacted, because I think it indicates the unwillingness of
Congress to presrapt a field which under the Constitution I
■think it has the power to do.

That has not, yet been fully

don©. Your Honor, but I don't think the constitutional question
is as significant today as it was three or four years ago when
this thing was first started.

I think the Hughes opinion sort

of points that out also.

Wq.11, Mr, Justice Brennan, the injury in
