P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Smith against the United States.
Mr. Smith, I think you may proceed when you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TEFFT W. SMITH, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Tefft Smith, representing the petitioner ,
Jerry Lee Smith.

I wish to reserve five minutes for rebuttal.

This case concerns the proper relationship between
federal and state law in the obscenity area. Petitioner
submits that this case can be simply disposed of andthe
constitutional issues avoided by the logical interpretation
of the federal statute as being intended

r> support state-

policy and thus, as incorporating the state law oefintion
of obscenity in the circumstances of this case.
The petitioner, Jerry Lee Smith, was convicted by
a jury in the Southern District of Iowa and sentenced to
six months imprisonment.

Under the federal statute prescribing

the mailing of obscene matter, he was convicted for mailings
which took place solely within the State of 'Iowa.

These

mailings were lawful within Iowa.
Iowa law permits the distribution of all sexually

4
related material to Iowa adults, proscribing solely the
distribution of certain specified materials to minors.
The case here involves no distribution to minors.
The distributions involved were made exclusively to
postal inspectors who directly solicited the material.

Hence,

these distributions were totally permissible under the law
of the state in which they took place.
At trial, the government offered no evidence of any
contrary standard;

nonetheless, the Court permitted the

jury to determine for itself what were the community standards.
We submit this was error.
The federal statute should be construed, in the
present circumstances, as incorporating Iowa lav/ as the
measure of obscenity.

That statute precludes, as a matter of

lax/, any finding that the materials involved here are
obscene.
QUESTION:

Hr. Smith, you represent not only this

defendant, but also an amicus here, don’t you?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, our firm represents the American

Library Association, x/hich has filed an extensive amicus
brief in this case.

But I am here speaking on behalf of the

petitioner himself.

And my argument is directed to the

petitioner’s position, although I am prepared to discuss,
of course, the amicus brief.
QUESTION:

Well, you get a one-two punch when you

5
do this?»
MR. SMITH:

Well, your honor, that’s one of the

advantages, yes, Mr. Justice Blackman „
QUESTION:

Well, then you're not really a friend of

the Court, are you?
MR. SMITH:

I am here representina Mr. Jerry Lee

Smith, the petitioner here.
QUESTION:
amicus curiae.

So this lav; firm represents the

I don't see how you can do that.

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, your honor —
I understand amicus curiae to mean that

I have no interest in the case itself, but I want to see the
Court do the right thing.
MR. SMITH:

Well, your honor, as you xd.ll note from

the briefs, the amicus brief was. prepared by a Mr. North, and
that I have the principal responsibility for preparing —
QUESTION:

It's the same firm?

MR. SMITH:

It is the same laxv” firm, yes, Mr.

QUESTION:

And it's on the brief, it says that.

MR. SMITH:

That's correct.

Justice.

QUESTION:

Have you ever seen that before in this

Court?
MR. SMITH:
Justice Marshall.

I'm not certain that I have ever, Mr.

6

The federal statute here at issue was enacted in
1873.

The statute was enacted with almost no debate.

contains no statement of purpose..

It

And it provides no

definition of what is obscene natter.
The statute has subsequently been reenacted on a
number of occasions, but it has never been significantly
revised, substantially debated, and no definition of the
meaning of obscene matter has ever been provided.
Instead, the Congress has left that matter to
judicial resolution by this Court.
This Court, in the Miller decision and those that
have followed, has firmly stated that the issue of obscenity
is one of local concern, not national concern, within the
traditional state jurisdiction.

The Court has rejected any

need for national uniformity in this area, and stated that
the obscenity or non-obscenity of materials should be measured
by contemporary community standards

within the community

in which the distribution has effect.
In that the state legislatures are institutionally
the voice of the people for setting community standards, the
Court has recognized that the individual states have
considerable latitude in determining what their community
standards shall be.

Indeed, the Court has expressly

recognized that states have the option of doing precisely
what the State of Iowa has done here.

7
QUESTIO?!:

Mr. Smith, what if the Iowa legislature

by a rather large voting passed a counterpart of the federal
statute and the governor had signed it but the Suoreme Court
of Iowa had held that it violated Iowa's constitution.

Fhat

would your position be in that case?
MR. SMITH:

In that case,, I b eiieve, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, that the situation would be that there had not
been, as enacted through the governmental structure of Iowa,
a statute which e xpressed the intent of the state government,
which is the repository for the declaration of society's
values, to have obscenity proscribed within the state.

7\nd

in those circumstances, the remedy for the disagreement that
the communities and the legislature would have, in those
circumstances, would be the ballot box.
QUESTION:

So then your argument doesn't depend

on the fact that a majority of the people in Iowa may not
agree with the federal statute?
MR. SMITH:,

That's correct, your honor.

Because a

majority of people within the State of Iowa speak through
their elected representatives.
QUESTION:

But what if your hypothetical person

in that situation took the material which had been declared
permissible in Iowa, by virtue of the state supreme court's
action, took them over to Illinois and exhibited them.

Mould

he be subject to prosecution in the state of Illinois, assureing

8

it was forbidden there?
HR. SMITH:

Well, he would not be subject to

prosecution, of course, under the statute here, which is a
federal mail statute.

n es

QUESTION: No, I'm asking a hypothetical question.
MR. SMITH: He would be taking that material into
another state, whose community standard would be different.
And in that circumstance, under those community standards,
if they were deemed to apply, that material would be
proscribable, that

conduct could be deemed prescribable,

hind I believe that: the Section 1462 of the Federal Code
would apply.

But interstate —

QUESTION:

That would not be subject to two

prosecutions, or at least violating two statutes, the statutes
of Illinois, assuming they had statutes that prohibited
this, and the federal statutes relating to interstate
transportation.
MR. SMITH:

That’s correct.

The State of Illinois

could protect its own interests in that situation.
QUESTION:

So that the choice of the particular

state is binding only on that state, is that not true?
MR. SMITH:

That’s correct.

Here, and that’s

critical to our case, the distribution took place solely
from one point in Iowa into another point in Iowa.
therefore there can be no question of any other

And

9

Standard applying in the circumstances of this case.

There

was no distribution anywhere else outside of that state.
QUESTIOII:

Are there any questions about the

nature of the materials here?

Do you concede they ware all

hard core stuff?
HR. SMITH:

Nell, Mr. Justice Blackraun, the phrase

hard core is something that has no legal meaning.
simply a code word for some material.

It’s

We don’t concede

that this material is anything other than sexually related
materialj as to whether it’s hard core or not, the issue
here is a question of obscenity.

And obscenity is a legal

concept which requires a measurement in accordance with the
free elements set forth in Miller, subject tothe contemporary
community standard.
QUESTION:

Let me put it another way.

If the

federal statute applied, you concede that this subjectibility
to it and conviction thereunder would be proper?
MR. SMITH:

No, because that is our second argument,

Mr. Justice Blacknun* which is, that the application of this
statute in the circumstances of this case where state law
has permitted the conduct would involve fundamental due
process considerations.

Therefore, if the -- as a statutory

interpretation question, it is decided —
QUESTION:

Well, let me start all over again.

premise was, if the statute applied, if it is validly

My

10
applicable, do you concede that a conviction thereunder
would be proper?
MR. SMITH:

No.

We would submit that these

materials are not obscene as a matter of law.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
as a

As a matter of Iowa law, you’re saying.
As a matter of Iowa law, and therefore

matter of — and as a matter of

federal law.

We do

not concede the obscenity of these materials, as that concept
is defined by the Court.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

As defined by what?
By the Court, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

This Court recognizing the absence of any need, and
indeed, the absence of any congressionally expressed desire,
for national uniformity in this area, has expressly applied
the contemporary community standards approach to federal
prosecutions.

That was the express holding in the Ilamling

case.
In these circumstances, we submit, that the Iowa
statutory decision here constitutes those contemporary
community standards, and should be applied in the circximstances
of a federal prosecution for distribution solely within the
State of Iowa.
QUESTION:

Well, yesterday, in a case that was

argued involving the intestacy statutes of Illinois that
exclude illegitimate children from — fathers from this

il
intestate succession from a decedent father, we were told
that the state law does not reflect state public opinion
and community standards.

Indeed , we were told that a poll

had shown that a vast majority of people in Illinois thought
that that state law was contrary to what they thought would
be good state policy»
MR. SMITH:

Well, I would submit, Mr. Justice

Stewart, that that is an improper statement.

Because the

remedy for disagreement between the people — is the ballot
box.

That's the essential nature of a democratic republic.

In our brief we quote from James Madison in Federalist Mo. 10
where that proposition was definitively stated at the outset
of the formation of this nation, and this Court has repeatedly
recognized that it is the legislatures, and through the
legislatures, following up on. Mr. Justice Rehnquist's point,
the — then further given our system of checks and balances,
the application of the governor in those situations to decide
what is to be that society’s values.
Now, our argument is consistent with the doctrine
of cooperative federalism which has been well articulated
by this Court.

In our federalist system, federal law is

interstitial in nature, often being incomplete, not having
considered all circumstances.
QUESTION:

This is an argument of statutory

construction, I take it.

12
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
You don't have any doubt that if the

federal government says the National Labor Relations Act
shall apply in all 50 states, even though the people of Iowa
may not like it, it can nonetheless do that.
MR. SMITH:

That is correct.

It has therefore been appropriate to evaluate and
interpret the meanings of federal lav? with reference tothe
backdrop of state law.
As the cases discussed in our brief at pages
23-30 demonstrate, the Court has in the past often looked
to state law to determine the meaning of congressional
enactment, particularly in the circumstances presented here,
where the matters at issue are considered local in nature,
and there has been no demonstrated need for national
uniformity.
QUESTION:

Well, now, hasn't Congress, in an

analogous situations when it wanted to exempt the force of
federal laws from operation in states where the state
policy was otherwise, hasn't it explicitly so determined?
I'm thinking for example, it's a violation — a criminal
violation of federal law, I think, to mail slot machines,
in interstate commerce.

But hasn’t Congress expressly

exempted the mailing of slot machines from one place to
another in Nevada, for example?

13

MR. SMITH:

Congress has taken this approach in

certain of its more recent statutory enactments.

But the

decisions that we cite and discuss in our brief do not
involve situations where there was such an express
Congressional intent.

Moreover, in he relatively recent

decision of Mr. Justice Marshall, inthe United States versus
Bath, the Court expressly refused to extend the prescriptions
under the federal statute proscribing the possession of
handguns by a convicted felon to an intrastate possession
absent some clear manifestation of Congressional intent.
Mr. Justice Marshall emphasized in his opinion in
that- circumstance that the absence of any comment in the
legislative history or in the statute on this subject matter
should be deemed persuasive.
QUESTION:: Eut you, Mr. Smith, as I understand it,
would concede — assuming Illinois has the kind of lav;
that's described by the Chief Justice — you would concede
that this.federal statute would be applicable to a mail
shipment from one point to another in Illinois, would you
not?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
So it's not just the intrastate character

of this.
MR. SMITH:

No the significance as I tried to
4

articulate earlier of the intrastate element here is solely

14
that only one standard here can possibly be determined to be
at Issae»

It can be solely the Iowa standard that we have to

evaluate»

And that’s the only standard that the jury could

have been instructed to apply in the circumstances of this
case.
QUESTION:

You don’t raise any constitutional

question that what Congress could have said, whether or not
legal in the states?
MR» SMITH:

Well, we do raise —- and that is our

second argument — that there are fundamental notice problems
in that circumstance, again referring back to the decision
in United States versus Bath.»

The Court there — although

that was not the factual situation in that case — noted that
there would be real notice problems if any application of
federal Iwa —
QUESTION:

But you wouldn3t put it on any commerce

clause argument, would you?
MR. SMITH:

No, I would not.

But it's a due

process argumexit and a notice argument.
Here, no federal interest can possibly he deemed
to be served by this prosecution.

The Court, in evaluating

the question of the nature of obscenity has identified no
federal interest.

Mr, Justice Harlan, in dissenting in the

Roth case, expressly rejected any notion of an independent
federal interest, emphasising instead the paramount obligation

15
of the federal government to ensure full protection of first
amendment rights»,
Justice Harlan, dissenting in the Memoirs case,
articulated what we would submit is the most logical and
most reasonable interpretation of the federal statutes,
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Weren't those both dissenting opinions?
Both of those were dissenting opinions,

Mr, Justice Black.
In the Memoirs dissent, Mr. Justice Harlan stated
that there would be a limited federal interest in proscribing
certain materials for the purpose of assurincr the federal
instrumentalities like the mails would not be utilized to
thwart state laws.
In the circumstances presented here, the interpretation
adopted below and urged by the government is precisely the
opposite.

It thwarts state law,
QUESTION:

Suppose, Mr. Smith, thatyou had a state

that for some reason or other simply decided not to make
bank .robbery a crime, but the federal statute, of course,
makes it a crimeto transfer the proceeds over a state line,
and also makes it a federal crime to

rob a

national

bank „
Do yo\a think the Iowa view7 of ~~ the Iowa
legislature's view of bank robbery would prevail over the
federal statute?

16

HR. SMITH:

'Jot if the federal statute had

manifested a clear intent that there were legitimate
federal interests that were involved here and were concerned
here.
QUESTION:

Well,, doesn't it manifest it just by

the passage of it?
HR. SMITH:

Ho, because there is no expression

within the statute of any intent.

And indeed, the nature of

the sxibject matter, as recognised by this Court as such,
that it is a matter of local concern that there are no
national interests here.
Indeed, the very purpose that was articulated
by Mr. Chief Justice himself in the Miller case for
eliminating the national standard was preciselv -QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That's the national standard.
Standard.
Not the — that's the judgement of the

jury, in which I expressed the same view as my predecessor
Chief Justice Warren expressed, that this is essentially a
matter of local community standards.
HR. SMITH:

That’s correct.

And the thrust

of that reasoning, it seems to me, Mr. Chief Justice, is,
that you should permit material to be distributed in a local
community where they are acceptable.

And in the circumstances

where the state legislature had evaluated the matter, and as

17
a legislative policy judgement
QUESTION:

Well, then, this would apply to bank

robbery too? that would be your answer to that question.
Unless the federal statute made out some sort of case that
there is a special reason why the national bank, nationally
chartered banks, is a bad thing.
MR. SMITH:

That, I think, is somewhat the locric of

my position, although I would submit that the differences
here are, of course, that what we’re concerned with is
further, the question of the impact of these rulings on First
Amendment rights, the serious notice problems that are involved
in applying a federal proscription to conduct which is lawful
under state law.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought your arguments -- at

least one of your arguments was simply that cis a matter of
defirition

of the offense there couldn't he an offense in

your state.
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION;

That is correct.
I mean, whether or not there's been a

bank robbery is an objectively identifiable question.

And

the answer is, that one can tell by objective measurement.
But since the test of whether or not there’s even been
violation

in this

a

'kind of case depends on contemporary

community standards, and since the

legislature of this state

has stated what the contemporary community standards are,

10

and they do not include this, then there'& not even an
offense.

Isn’t that your point?
MR. SMITH:

I certainly would agree with

every­

thing that Justice Stewart has —QUESTION:

And that makes it quite different from

the bank . robbery case.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does.
There cannot even be an offense.

There

can’t be a bank robbery.
MR. SMITH:

The bank robbery situation involves

a question of conduct, where this —■ the issue here that
we’re concerned with is a question of how do you evaluate
the standards in determining what that conduct has been.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, could I ask a question?

Your argument, as I understand it, relates the
concept of contemporary community standards to the whole
problem of defining whether something is obscene or not.
The government responds, as I understand their
brief, by saying that the Miller test has two parts to it,
the first of which is this business of appealing to the prurient
interest.

And as I understand them, they say that the

contemporary community standard reference only modifies that
first part of the three part Miller test.
Do you — what is your response to that?

It

has a limited application rather than applying to the whole

19

concept of obscenity.
MR. SMITH:

Well', Mr. Justice Stevens, we would

submit that that is a distortion of the Millar decision.
And the opinion of Mr» Chief Justice in the Miller decision
states as its summary, we hold that obscenity

and that's

at page 37 of the opinion -- it states that we hold that
obscenity — utilizing the broad word obscenity — is to
be determined by applying contemporary community standards,
not national standards.
QUESTION:

You said the three-part test is a

conjunctive test and not a disjunctive test, is it?

That

the material has to —
MR. SMITH:

Yes.

The three independent elements

must conjoin for a finding of obscenity.

Moreover, the

subsequent opinion of Mr. Justice Rehnquist in Hamlin
repeatedly referred to the contemporary community standards
test as broadly applying to the concept of obscenity.
Similarly, the opinion in the Jenkins versus Georgia
case so refersr

expressly referring to the first two

tests of prurient interest and patently offensive appeal.
The — Mr. Chief Justice, in the Miller case, in
rejecting the national standards approach, expressly stated
that there will be varying, from community to community,
standards of precisely -- and I'm quoting from page 30 of
the opinion — of precisely what appeals to the prurient

20

interest or is patently offensive.
The history of the formulation of the patently
offensive test further confirms this fact,, in that when it
was first fully articulated by Mr. Justice Brennan in the
Memoirs case, he stated that material is patently offensive
because it affronts contemporary community standards relating
to the description of sexual matter.
And within the Court's own formulation, and moreover
within the logic of why it is that you proscribe obscenity,
is where it is offensive to the community.

If it is not

offensive to the community, it is not obscene.
The results that occurred below, and as urged by
the government, expressly has certain adverse consequences.
First, it effectively nullifies Iowa law.

And by the same

logic, the laws of at least six other states.

The Court has

recognized, in Lamont versus Postmaster General, that the U„S.
mails have a predominant influence in the nation.

Whatever —

the Court stated, whatever may have been the voluntary nature
of the postal system in the period of its establishment, it
is now the main artery through which the business, social and
personal affairs of the people are conducted.
Hence, the federal statute s would become the
dominant statutes.

Indeed, in the circumstances here, that

result runs directly contrary to what the Court has repeatedly
stated is the right of the individual state legislatures to

21

take the course followed by the State of Iowa, and to choose
to permit the regulation — the distribution of all sexually
related material to their citisem-y.
The further adverse consequence of this d ecision -and we would submit that the constitutional issue of notice
can be avoided by the interpretation of the statute which
we submit — is the fundamental fairness consideration that
a person has a legitjjmate expectation that if he conducts
himself in accordance with the laws of the state of his
residence, his conduct there will not lead him to criminal
proscription.
QUESTIO?!:

What about somebody in Iowa who mis-brands

drugs, and the Iowa legislature has chosen not to make that,
criminally punishable»

Would that give him a defense to a

federal charge?
HR. SMITH:

Not in a situation where, again, the

federal government has expressly enacted a statxite which has
its own standards which govern that conduct.
QUESTION:

Well, in the mis -brand ing of drucrs, the

violation itself doesn't depend on community standards „ does
it?
HR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No, and that is —
The very essence of this defense, as

m

this Court has said, depends upon whether or not —■ depends
upon the standards of the communities.

22

MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:

That

is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

But when a federal jury, sitting in

Iowa, on a federal mis -branding case, such as suggested
by Mr. Justice Relinquish, they do, as every jury does, apply
their own standards consistent, of course, it is hoped,
with instructions from the Court.

But is it not element air/

that every jury applies its own concept of morality and of
rights?
MR. SMITH:
evaluating conduct.

Yes, that is true, especially in
But this Court has very carefully

stated —
QUESTION:

One set of jurors might look at a particu­

lar label or brand on a drug or some grocery item and say,
no , this is not a mis "branding, it. doesn't mislead us.

But

another jury in another town in the state of Iowa might look
at it and say, it is a mis-branding.

So you can get that

variation, even on a subject of this kind, could you not?
MR. SMITH:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are

standards provided in those kinds of statutes.

The jury

is not free at its will to exercise whatever its judgement
on the morality or immorality of the conduct is.
QUESTION:

Well, I said hopefully the jury follows

the instructions of the court.

But we know that juries

don't always do it.
MR. SMITH:

But jurors must be required to consider

23

things objectively»

And here, in the circumstances of this

case, and under this Court's precedents, it has been
directly decided, thatthe jury must apply an objective
test based upon the community standards of the average
person in the community.
their own standards.

They're not supposed to apply

They are supposed to apply the standards

that prevail within the community.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith,,are those — is the definition

of the contemporary community standard, or the local
community standard, is that an issue of fact or an issue
of law in your judgement?
HR. SMITH:

I think that it is an issue of lav;, in

the present circumstances of this case, in that the Iowa
legislature has enacted a legal pronouncement on that issue.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Smith, your time

has expired.
Mr. Shapiro.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think it would be useful to just review

the

facts of the case before we discuss the lav?.
The material involved in this case consists o f
five magazines, five photographs, and two films which

24
petitioner deposited'in the mails»

They were all sert to

addresses within the State of Iowa.
The case was tried to a jury.

The defendant put

on evidence of community standard, which consisted largely
of photographs and magazines similar in nature to the material
which is alleged to be obscene here.
I would characterize both the material we have
charged to be obscene and the defensive material as obvious
hard-core pornography.
The District Court permitted the defense, over the
government's objection, to

introduce the I ox? a statute x?hich

limits the crime of obscenity to distribution to minors.

The

judge also in his instructions, charged the jury to consider
the effect of that statute along x?ith the other evidence in
determining what the community standard in the ■— I think it’s
the central district of Iox?a is.
The jury, after being charged under the Miller
test •— Miller and Hamling ■— these mailings all took place
after Miller — convicted the defendant on all counts.
The Court of Appeals —
QUESTION:

TThat did the instructions have to say

with respect to community standards?
MR. SHAPIRO:
23.

Are they in the —

Yes, they’re in the record, 22 and

Actually, let's see, they begin with instruction number

8 at 21, and then they carry on -- they’re very close to the

25
Miller's test.

At page 22, there's almost a literal

repetition of the Miller test. And I won't read it, but it's
stated quite clearly, including a definition of what
patently offensive means, and referring to what we would call
hard-core pornography.
QUESTION:

Do you recall, Mr. Shapiro, who the judge

was?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

I regret, your honor, I do not.

The District Judge %*as Judge Stuart, was

it not?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Judge Stuart, I think.

Well, he’s an old time Iowa judge, he

used to be on the Supreme Court of Iowa until fairly recently.
MR. SHAPIRO :

Now, at page 23 — at the bottom of

page 22 and page 23, is part of the instructions, it's
quite important.
In determining the views of the average person s
of the community, you are each entitled to draw on your
own knowledge of the views of the average persons in the
community from which you come, as well as consider the
evidence presented as to the state law on obscenity, and
materials available for purchase in certain stores as shown
by the evidence.
The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Judge
that it was proper for the jury to consider the effect of the

26

state statute, and it also concluded that this was simply an
element in determining community standards, it was not in
itself conclusive as the petitioner here contends»
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro,, just to put the same question

out; is it your view that the determination of the contemporary
community standard is a question of fact or a question of law?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the first two elements of the

test, in Miller, we believe are primarily questions of fact.
The Court so said in Miller, at page 30 of the opinion.
The last element, dealing with whether the material
lacks a serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value is much more of a legal question.

I also thing that

that last element is not subject to a community standard
limitation, because otherwise we would find that what are
considered serious matters in one part of the country cohld
not flow into another part of the country.

So you "'can't

really limit the third part of the test by community standards
factor.
QUESTION:
answers the question.

Mr, Shapiro, I don't think that quite
You suggested the first two pairts of

the Miller test are questions of fact, and the third part
might be a question of law.

My question is, whether the

community standard, the definition of community standard
itself, is a question of law or a question of facts which
apparently, at least according to your opponent, applied to

27

all three parts of the Miller test?
MR. SHAPIRO:

I would regard it principally as a

question of fact, subject to one qualification: the Court has
said in Hamling that under the constitutional tests in
Miller, the state may, for state purposes, constitutionally
define the geographical reach of the community in

tfhich the

standard is to be applied.
And that brings me to another element of the
community standard test which it's most important to
explicate.

That is, that the contemporary community standards

element of the test refers to the contemporary mores of the
community, and that is independently of the state statutory
policy, which either makes the distribution of obscene material
criminal or non-criminal.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, maybe I missed it: what

evidence did the government put on as community standards?
You said what the defendant put on.

What did the government

put on?
MR, SHAPIRO:

The government relied on decisions in

I think it is, Paris Adult Theater and Hamling, that it need
not put on evidence of community standards in order to make
this determination.
QUESTION:

What more reliable evidence is there

of the mores of a community than the laws of a selected —
an elected representatives?

28

MR, SHAPIRO:

Well, let me illustrate it if I

may, your honor.
In a state which has a statute condemning obscenity,
the Miller test itself recognizes that that lav/ does not
express the community standard,

It still has to be determined

by the jury, despite the state law.
Well, the converse is equally true.

The jury must

determine for itself the community standards .
QUESTION:

Well, we9re talking about mores.

Your

word was mores, which means, customs or standards,
MR, SHAPIROs

Yes.

Now, this means that the state

statute is a factor to be considered.

But all the state

statute in Iowa does, in fact all the state statutes in the
six states that we know about that have decriminalized
obscenity do, is to say that we will give up on trying to
prosecute this stuff criminally.

It certainly isn’t an

approval of it, it isn’t an encouragement of it, it doesn't
necessarily reflect what this Court is talking about when
it speaks of a constitutional standard under the First
Amendment of contemporary community standards dealing with
recognition by the average person of a matter that appeals
to the prurient interest, or to the extent that the community
standard applies to the patently offensive element, to what
is patently offensive.
QUESTION:

Would you make that same argument if

29

the State of Iowa had decriminalised marijuana or heroin
and got a federal prosecution?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, your honor, ws would.

And some

states have.
Of course, it has been pointed out .

I don't want

to *— there is a difference between this problem of
conduct and problem of defining obscenity which rests on a
constitutional definition under the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

Anc whether or not an offense has been

committed depends on community standards, on this particular
offense»
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Whether or not somebody smoked marijuana

doesn’t depend whatsoever on community standards.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, whether it can be constitutionally

punished, at least, I would rather express it in that way.
Now, as I said -QUESTION:
Shapiro.

May I just interrupt once more, Mr.

We're vacillating back and forth between the

contemporary community standard being a question of fact and
being a constitutional standard, which normally would be a
legal standard.

And you've reminded us that the Court

does not require the government to offer evidence on such
contemporary community standards.
Is the.re anything in the record which would enable

30

an appellate judge to deterrains what the crntemporary
community standard is'?
MR. SHAPIRO;

In the defendants view, the material

that he offered and the state statutes.

And in the government's

view, the state statute is a factor, but this goes to an
element that the jury is to decide.
QUESTION;

Is it

is this an issue that —
MR. SHJiPIRO;
QUESTION:

It is subject to appellate review.

And hot? does an appellate judge go about

reviewing the question of whether or not the correct community
standard was applied?
HR, SHAPIRO;

On the first two elements, he gives

the greatest weight to the jury.

The constitutional test in

Miller, as the Court has recognized when it dealt with the
question of the geographic scope of standards, is essentially
factual.
What the Court said in Miller was that under a
national constitution there can be variation from community
to community.

And then it went on to say there aren't

fixed national standards of precisely what appeals to the
prurient interest or is patently offensive.

These are

essentially questions of fact.
QUESTION;

I understand.

But are they questions of

fact that can be decided without any evidence being in the

31
record to tell us what the standard is in Iowa?

As I under-

stand your position, the government need offer no evidence —
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And we may not look to the I ox-? a law,

and we don't have to accept the defendant's evidence.

So

what do we look at to see what the standard is?
MR. SHAPIRO:

You look at the jury's determination.

Because this is the aspect of the issue —
QUESTION:

And they can determine this on the basis

of their own knowledge of what happens in the community,
which is not in the record for us to review, is that it?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That is the basis of the test as it

has been defined in the Court's decision.
QUESTION:

Now7, you told us that the Iowa law was

admissible in evidence?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Why?

MR. SHAPIRO:

In your view?

So that the jury may consider it,

since the jury is permitted to consider any evidence, any

And the statute could be considered by them.

QUESTION:

In a federal prosecution for possession

of marijuana, would it be —• would the absence of a state
criminal law criminalizing the possession of marijuana be
permissible into evidence?
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

No, your honor, it would not.

Well, what's the difference?

MR. SHAPIRO;

Well, X think the difference is that

the state statute here dealing with the decision to criminalize
or not criminalize obscenity would to some extent reflect
comunity mores.

But the weight to be given that is for the

jury.
Now, the state law, of course, in this case didn't
purport to determine community standards.

All it said was

that we will not prosecute — I'm paraphrasing grossly, but —
we will not prosecute obscenity as a crime.
Now, it doesn't follow from this that the community
mores in Iowa do not recognize hard core pornography to be
obscene.

But basically that's what you're dealing with.

Wow, I've said that what

we've got when a state decriminalizes obscenity is a different
in policy between a — the federal policy and the state policy
Each has a responsibility of its own under the constitution.
The federal responsibility in this case rests on the postal
pox/er.

That power extends to both interstate and intrastate

mailings, and it may be exercised

for the nation as a

whole.
In exercising it, Congress may — and we think in
18 USC 14G1 has -- adopted a nationwide prohibition barring
obscene matter from the mails, whether mailed interstate
or intrastate.
As a constitutional matter, that test is subject
in the determination — that statute — in the determination
of obscenity, is subject to the contemporary
standards element.

And it's not subject to anv

And this is primarily because a state

statute, while it is evidence of the mores of a community,
is not conclusive on it.
Like any state legislature concerned about matters
in its sphere of responsibility, Congress may determine that
certain activities are pernicious.

Now, the petitioner's

37

suggestion that as applied to hard core pornography this is
somehow inconsistent with our federalism, and therefore
requires that the statute foe read to create a local option

Congress could make federal obscenity law subject

It hasn't done so.

When it wishes to do so,

it does so expressly.

uniformly construed to apply across the nation as a whole.
It is part of a pattern of statutes expressina the federal

and Iowa’s responsibility.

It's Iowa's business

The federal conaress, if it

wishes, can also bar the material from the mail, either
interstate or intrastate.
IJov, the petitioner claims that the statute is
unduly vague as applied to the facts in this case.
Hamling the Court

Well, in

clearlv indicated what the statute applies

to:hard core pornography.

Petitioner was distributing hard

core pornography within the state.

Tie was not committing a

crime under state law, but he certainly was on notice that
he was committing a crime by distributing it by mail.

And

that is what he was convicted for, quite properly.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, on this question of vagueness

and perhaps the allied argument of over-breadth,, since this
is arguably a First Amendment case, as well as a due orocess
notice case, do we — is it a. complete answer to say thatthe
i

statute was not vague as applied to these facts, or should we
look at the potential over-breadth, in view of the First
Amendment implications?
Do I make ny question clear?
HR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, I think you do, your honor.

I don't think you have to reach any over-breadth
question on the facts here.

This is a claim of vagueness

made in circumstances where it's clear that the statute
applies.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

one o'clock, Hr. Shapiro.

I believe I was responding to a question from Hr.
Justice Stevens concerning whether the Court, in this case,
should reach the question of over-breadth.

And ray answer,

as I stated it then, was that in this case there’s no reason
for the Court to reach the issue of over-breadth.-

In this

case, the facts involved show clearly that the defendant was

So there is no reason to be concerned with any
question of over-breadth.
Mow, there’s been some discussion about what the
court of appeals is to consider in reviewing one of these
decisions.

The Court, in Hamling, noted that a juror was

entitled to call upon his own knowledge of community customs,
the customary candor in the community.

This decision — this

kind of dteermination was compared to a knowledge of what
reasonable conduct is, what a standard of due care is.

And

that's about all you can do in this area when you're trying
to determine what community

mores are,

to be sure a

defendant is entitled if he wishes to introduce evidence

40

concerning what community mores are, hut it is not mandatory
that the government do so»

The jurors knowledge is very

much analogous to the reasonable man standard.
This comes into play also when we consider the last
issue which petitioner presented in his brief, that his rights
were violated by the voir dire of the jury.

Mow, of course

the questions to be put to jurors in an obscenity case must
assure that the jurors are neutral and objective.

It*s been

said that it's appropriate to inquire, within the limits of the
judges — district judge’s power to control voir dire — into
the political moral, religious or sexual opinions which might
affect neutrality and objectivity.

Now, —
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, let me just ask one other

question that's been on my mind.
Is it your understanding that the matter of establishing

41
the contemporary community standard is part of the governments
affirmative case, or is it part of the defense that the
defendant may assert?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Who has the burden on that issue?
Well, of course, since it’s a

criminal case, there's always a burden of persuasion on the
government to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the
material involved offends community standards within the
Miller test.
On the other hand, the Court's decisions make
clear, there's no burden on the government of coming forward
with evidence on that issue.
Now, I think the -— the case can be summed up
by trying to decide

whether something that is offensive

necessarily has to be illegal.
The Constitutional test in Miller does not equate
offensiveness to the community with illegality in the
community.

And that's really the essence of our position.

This concept of community mores, that the statute involves —
that the Miller test involves — simply reflects a practical
and realistic way of handling what the Court has described
as an intractable problem.
There are all kinds of things that are offesnive
