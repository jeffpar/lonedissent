P R O C E E D I N G S
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75—12 78, Mt. Healthy School District against Doyle»
Mr» 0linger, I think you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP S. OLINGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. OLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

th© Court:
Mt. Healthy School District is a small school district
on the outskirts of Cincinnati.

It has approximately 7600

students, and approximately 325 teachers.
In 1966, the Board of Education employed Fred Doyle,
th© respondent in this case.

He was employed on three one-year

contracts and then h@ was given a — two two-year contracts.
All of these contracts were non-tenured.
In 1971, in the spring of that year, th® Board, as
was its usual custom, reviewed the contracts of the non-tenured
teachers and determined that year that ten of them should not
be renewed.

Mr. Doyle happened to be one of those teachers

whose contract was not renewed.
He requested a reason, following his--notice that he
was not renewed, and the Superintendent sent him a letter.

And

in that letter the Superintendent stated -that he was not renewed
because it was felt -that he lacked tact in handling professional

4
matters, and the Superintendent went on to cite two examples.
One was a telephone call that Mr» Doyle had mad® to
a local disc jockey at a radio station to, oh# criticise a
dress cod© that had been sent around to the teachers? and the
sscene example cited by the Superintendent was an obscene
gesture that Mr. Doyle had made to some female students in the
school.
After Mr. Doyle was aware that he was not going to be
renewed at Mt. Healthy# he sought employment elsewhere.

In

fact# in June of 1971# he obtained a job at the Miami Trace
local school district# which is fifty miles or so north of
Mt. Healthy.
One month later# in July# he filed this suit along
with two other school teachers# «and he filed the suit against
the five Board members in their individual and official
capacity.

He filed it against the Board itself as a political

entity of the States. And he filed it against the Superintendent.
QUESTION:
Mr. Olinger.

Let me ask you a question there# if I may#

And I will txy not to be parochial# but I3m used

to the Arizona organisation of school boards? let me give you
that and ask you if it’s like Ohio's.
Where I practiced in Arizona there was a municipal
corporation which was called a school district# and it was very
«•

much analogous to counties or cities and things like that.
Then the board that administered that district was called the

5
School Board.

It was not & suable entity in itself, it was

just a collection of individuals.
Now, what is the situation in Ohio?
MR0 OLINGER:

In Ohio, Your Honor, there are different

types of school districts,

But the particular district that w®

are discussing here is what is known as a city school districto
And, basically, it encompasses the district ~ or the same
boundary lines as the municipality of Mt. Healthy»
Now, however, in Ohio, school districts that are city
school districts do not have to be confined to that precise
municipal boundary»

And I think you will find, for example,

with the Mt. Healthy School District, it encompassed a larger
amount of territory than the city itself, part of the township,
and the same would b© true, for example, with the Board of
Education for the City of Cincinnati, which encompasses the
City of Cincinnati.,
QUESTION: What5s the difference between the school
district and the Board of Education?
MR. OLINGER:

Oh.

All right,

there is a difference in Ohio.

I*m not sure I know

I think, for all intents and

purposes, they have bean treated as synonymous.
QUESTION: And both are regarded as municipal corpora»
tions ?
MR. OLINGER:

No, no.

I have never heard a school

district referred to, as a municipal corporation.

It has always

s
been referred to as a school districts
QUESTIONS

Or a Board of Educations

MR. QLINGERs
QUESTION:

Or a Board of Education? either one.

As, for example, the Cincinnati Board of

Education is — would be the defendant in a suit against the
school districts wouldn't it?
MR. OLINGERs

Probably?

Yes , that is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, supposing I have a contract claim
against the school district, and name the proper parties, out
of whose treasury does the — is that judgment paid?
MR. OLINGER: That judgment would be paid out of the
general fund of —
QUESTION:

Of what?

MR. OLINGER:
Board of Education.

-- of the school district or the

Whichever you prefer to

as I understand:

it in Ohio, Your Honor, a school district is a —
QUESTION:
MR. OLINGER:

Geographic area.
— geographic area.

In Ohio — for

example, in this complaint, the respondent here in the initial

.

lawsuit sued the Mt. Healthy City School District Board of
Education.
Now, in the statute» it says that a board of education
shall be a body politic capable of suing and being sued.
QUESTION: So they are really just almost synonymous
for purposes of —

7

MRo OLINGER:

As X understand it# that is correct#

Your Honor»
QUESTION:

Doss the Constitution of Ohio provide for

school boards or boards of education# as I think you called
them?
MRe OLINGER:

The Constitution of Ohio provides that

there shall be a school system provided for in Ohio — I can't
recall the exact terms# Your Honor# and I —
QUESTION:

School Board members in Virginia ar©

constitutional officers»
MR* OLINGER:
QUESTION:

Is -that true in Ohio?
Your Honor# I don't believe they are»

I don't want to detain you on the point.

I was just interested.
Your school boards do have authority to levy taxes?
Or do -they?
MR. OLINGER:

In Ohio# Your Honor# there is what is

known in Ohio as a ten-mill limitation.

And that ten-mill

limitation must be shared in this# let’s say# in this particular
case, between the municipality — that would be the City of
Mfc. Healthy — and shared with the County of Hamilton# in
which the city resides# and also must then be shared with the
Board of Education.
QUESTION:

And that’s ten mills.
Right.

MR. OLINGER:

Now# those ten mills can be levied

without a vote of the people*

But one® you reach that ten-milii

8

limitation, then the only way you can then get a tax levy is
by submitting the matter to the public.
And I might say that in Mt. Healthy, in the past six
years, we have had five tax levies, they have all failed.

Our

most recent on© was yesterday — and we don’t know the result
of that yet,
QUESTION:

Who levies it?

MR, OLINGER:
itself, Your Honor,

The city?

No, the — it would be the School Board

The School Board itself, ~~

QUESTION:

Right,

MR, OLINGER;
levy on the ballot.

The county?

— adopts a resolution to put a tax

And if it’s passed, then we can, you

know, then have the —
QUESTION:

That’s the — the voters are all the

people in the school district,
MR, OLINGER;

In the school district, that is true.

QUESTION: Which could be different from the county
or the city or anything else, —
QUESTION: Could be.
QUESTION:

— boundary-wise,

MR, OLINGER:

Yes,

Boundary-wise, only the voters

who are in the school district may vot® on that particular
issue,
QUESTION: Right,
MR, OLINGER:

How about bond issues?

The salt© thing is true.

9

QUESTION:

That’s what I thought.

Is there any

authority to issue bonds up to a limitation analogous to the
ten-mill limitations, without a vote of the people or anything?
MR» OLINGER:

Your Honor, I!ra not sura on that? but

I think that on bonds you have to put all bond issues to a
general vote —
QUESTION:

That*s what I thought,

MR» OLINGER:
QUESTION;

— the general electorate»

I don’t want to detain you on this

particular subject? but while we are on it? does the record
show? or do you know as a matter of public record? what
percentage of the cost of operating the public schools in Ohio
is bora® by the State Treasury?

In Rodriguez? that was before

this Court a few years ago? I think the evidence showed? for
example? that some 40-odd percent came from State funds»
This may be relevant to the Eleventh Amendment issue in your
case? which is why I asked -the question,
MR. OLINGER:

Your Honor? there was no testimony

presented on -that issue in the trial»

I do have the figures

if — and they are ~
QUESTION; Are they matters of public record?
MR. OLINGER;
QUESTION:

Yes,

Yes? they are»

Well? what are they?

MR» OLINGER:

In -the 1971-72 school year the State

of Ohio contributed 48 percent.

In 1972-73 the State contri-

10
touted 51 parcent»

In 1373-74 it contributed 50 parcent»

In ’74-75# it contributed 53 percent»

And in 575-76 it also

contributed 53 percent»
QUESTION:

That’s under the equalizing formula»

HR, GLINGER:
QUESTION:

Yes»

Under the equal yield formula.

Right.

MR. OLIHGER:

I might say one other thing# Your

Honor# these percentages of State contribution would have been
higher except that in Ohio the State of Ohio is finding itself
in a very financially embarrassed position? it has reduced the
amount of equal yield to all the school districts in Ohio»
At the conclusion of the trial# the district court
dismissed the Board members and the Superintendent# and found
that the Board should — was guilty# and should pay to Mr»
Doyle something over 5#000 in wages# should pay something over
6#000 in attorney fees# assessed costs against the Board# and
ordered Mr» Doyle to be reinstated in the Mfc„ Healthy School
system on a tenured contract.
On appeal# the only thing the Sixth Circuit Court
of Appeals did was to reverse -the district court in so far as
attorney fees # on the basis of the Alyeska vs .Wilderness Society
holding that attorney fees are basically cost»
The evidence# I think# establishes beyond a doubt
that Mr. Doyle’s contract was- not renewed because the Board
members felt that he simply lacked the tact or# for us© ©f

11
another word # maturity to be given a tenured contract in the
Board of Education»
The Court in its opinion cites five examples# if you
will, of Mr. Doyle’s immaturity.

And# as one Board member

said# over the five years there appeared to be no improvement
in this maturity ox* lack of tact problem.
Now# in fact# I think perhaps the most important
thing that I can find in the judge*s opinion was 'when he states:
"In fact# as this court sees it and finds both -the Board and
the wuperintendent basically had ample reason not to grant Mr»
Doyle a tenured contract# without regard to the First Amendment
problem.n
The Court also pointed out that four Board ■ members
and the Superintendent stated# without any denial or rebuttal,
that they did not determine not to renew Mr. Doyle’s contract
because of a free speech problem,
QUESTION;

Mr. 0linger# the first question presented
0

in your Petition for Certiorari is whether the district court
had jurisdiction in this action under Section 1331.

Ar® you

planning to discuss that scon?
MR. OLIHGER:

Yes# I am# Your Honor.

QUESTION; All right.
MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION;

In fact# I am —•

I don’t mean to order your argument for

you# I just wanted to know if you did plan to discuss it.

12

MR. OLINGER:

Oh, yes, I did,. Your Honor,

1 may not

have very much time, bufc I do want to discuss every point that
I brought up*
The first point that I want to —* the first
proposition of lav; that I’d like to present to the Court is that
X don’t really have any question if the Court wishes to
accept the substantiality doctrine for the problem that is here
today.

That is, vie have a situation where, obviously, there

were a number of permissible reasons where the Board could
have not — could have used for not granting tenure.

And then

we have tills one non~p@rmissibl@ reason.
There is some argument, all right, the Board didn’t
consider that, but I’m going to treat 'the matter as though the
Board — and which they did, they were certainly well aware of
the WSAI phone call.
My position is is that, I think, as Judge Hogan —
who I am very fond of — looked at the case, he saw that the
Board had valid reasons not to renew the contract. But h® saw
the telephone call to WSAI and he felt under Pickering and, a.
as he cites, Skehan, that h® had no choice but, since there was
a First Amendment problem in there, that he had to rule against
the Board.
QUESTION:

I suppose Mr. Boyle had no legal advice

whan he stated the reasons, did he?
MR. OLINGER:

You mean the Superintendent, Your Honor?

13
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. OLINGER:

Yes, the Superintendent»

I did not represent the Board at that

time, and they had another attorney, but he died, and I don't
know whether he was alive or not at that particular time.
I can’t advise this Court on that particular problem, Your
Honor»
There’s one other thought I’d like to advance on that
first theory, and that is, maybe it’s similar to a reviewing
court who will not set aside a trial court, even if the trial
court decides a case for the wrong reasons but comes to the
right result.
And then my final theory is that I think, under the
-- what I am starting to understand is the doctrine of
federalism, or comity between the federal system and the
State system, that, you knew, the matter of education is
primarily a State concern, and therefore should be left to the
State to handle its own affairs.
Now, my second argument, of course, involves
jurisdiction.
QUESTION; And really, logically, that's your first
argument, isn't it?
MR. OLINGER;
QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes, I would say it is —

And if you're right about that, we never

get to the merits? is that correct?
MR. OLINGER;

Yes, that is correct, Your Honor»

14
'Ilie first, argument involves jurisdiction®

The —

Mr® Doyle brought his suit under, of course, 1983, which then
brings into play 1343 and 1341®
QUESTION:

1331.

MR® QLINGER:

1331.

In the first proposition in

my brief, I say that under Monroe vs» Papa, City of Kenosha vs.
Bruno# Moor vs. County o£ Alameda, and then this summer I
believe, the case of A1 dinger vs. Howard, that this Court has
tsaaaaeS^-1.Tsrs,3a85g3c3=3.-'T'?.,I^^-^-..i'^ CT.xgsaasi

consistently held that a municipality in a county are not a
person under 1983, and, consequently# the federal courts have
no jurisdiction either for legal, that is damages# or
equitable relief.
I am asking this Court today to extend that doctrine
to Boards of Education.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

one o'clock.
MR® QLINGER: Thank you very much,
[Whereupon, at 12:GO noon, the Court was recessed#
to reconvene at 1:00 p„m.# the same day.3

Olinger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP S. OLINGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — Resumed
MR. OLINGER:

If I recall correctly, we were dis­

cussing the 1983 issue in my brief.
any more time on it.

And I am not going to spend

I believe that there is valid reason to

take the position -that boards of education are entitled to the
same immunity that has been granted to both municipalities
and counties in this particular area.
I would like to move on now to the 1331 argument.
QUESTION:
ask you this:

Mr. Olinger, as you get into that, may I

Do you concede that if a bona fide claim of

$10,000 or more is presented by this case that there is federal
jurisdiction against this defendant?
MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION:

Under 1331?

MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION:

No.

No, Your Honor.

I think I —

That wasn't clear to me from your brief.

It5s a little more clear, I think, from your Supplemental
Brief.
MR. OLINGER:

All right.

When I — when the brief was

first prepared, when I prepared the Petition for Writ of

16
Certiorari, I was under the impression that that was the only
issue left, Section 1331, the $10,000 amount,,
QUESTION 2

Unh-hunh.

MR. OLINGER:

The Respondent’s brief brought up the

subject in its brief, and later, after further research and
looking at Bevins vs» The Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agente,
and Aldinger vs. Howard, I was — I had to reverse myself and
say, no, I don’t think that resolved the issue.
QUESTION: That even if there is 1331, federal juris­
diction, nonetheless, your client is not a person under
19 83»
MR. OLXNGER:
QUESTION:

And that —

Is that your position?

MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Yes, Your Honor.

Unh-hunh.

MR. OLINGER:

Nov?, respondent says, well, you know,

this Court has sua sponte jurisdiction to --- on its own, sue.
spont®, may raise the jurisdictional question.

The respondent

takes the position that -that is not a jurisdictional question,
and that’s the only point I disagree with.
I did not bring this subject up in my original
brief, I apologize for not being astute enough to recognize
that as an issue at that particular time.
But, anyway, going to 1331 and the $10,000 issues
At the time -that Mr. Doyle filed this lawsuit, he, of course,

17
had obtained employment elsewhere.

And just for argument

purposes,, that salary is approximately $2,000 less than the
salary that he vrnld have received at Mt. Healthy.
If I understand what the federal courts are saying,
is that when an employment question is involved, it's the
salary of that particular job that establishes the $10,000
jurisdiction.
Well, I'm not sure exactly, you know, what -the Court
means by that, but if you’re taking one year’s salary

and

the salary at Mt* Healthy would have been a little bit mo-re
than $10,000 — then, under Columbian Insurance Company
Wheelright, I suppose that this Court would say, well, that
there was federal jurisdiction on the $10,000 issue.
But the point I’m trying to make is that if that is
going to be the basis, if at the time he files the lawsuit he’s
got another position paying $8,000, the only distinction is
really the $2,000 between fch© two salaries.
QUESTION:

But, Hr. Olinger, isn't it true that

under the Ohio statutory law, if he had been rahired, he would
then have had tenure —
MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

— for tine rest of his life, subject to

being terminated for cause?
MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And **“ so that's $10,000 a year for the

18
rest of his working life# isn't it?
MRo OLINGER;
QUESTION;

That is correct# Your Honor»
Discounted# and then mitigated by any

other employmerit he might have had. So that that certainly# on
its face# looks like more than $10#000# doesn't it?
MR. OLINGER;

Well now# if you want to — if you want

to say he had $10,000 for the rest of his life# then I
suppose you get into the question; Well# how long is the
employe® entitled to claim this $10#0Q0?

Is it $10,000 times

the mortality rat® for the rest of his life?
In other words -QUESTION;
MR. OLINGER;
QUESTION;
MR. OLINGER;
QUESTION;
MR. OLINGER;

You only need one $10#000.
Oh# I know.
II® needs one $10#000# in one sentence»
I agree# Your Honor.
That's all he needs.
I agree.

What I’m pointing out is

that if we're going to establish jurisdiction on the $10#000
amount on that basis# then we've got. to think in terms of
damages,

Now# if we think in terms of damages# you’re going

to have to multiply $10 #000# and Mr. Doyle# I’d say# was thirty
years of age# and the mortality rate says he’s going to live to
seventy# we've got forty more years in there.

And the

federal district court could assess a $400#000 judgment
.against the Mt„ Healthy Board of Education.

19
QUESTION;

Well, that's kind of computation that a

jury is asked to make in every negligence case, isn’t it?
MR. OLINGER:

Yes, Your Honor, that’s basically true.

There’s no question about that.
I guess the point I'm trying to say, Your Honor, is
that if you want to take $10,000 and multiply it over his
life expectancy, then I think that the employer should be
entitled to take $8,000 and multiply it over his life
expectancy ~~
QUESTION;

That still —- the total still comes

out to well over 10,000.
MR. OLINGER; All right.
problem there, Your Honor.

Except one — there’s one

And that is in educational — in

computing salaries, of course -teachers are on steps, et cetera.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. OLINGER;

And they reach a maximum point at

seme level.
Nov;, the other — we don’t know what the Miami Trace
maximum level is, but it could be greater than Mt. Healthy.
QUESTION;

Of course, ordinarily, for ascertaining

the substantiality of the jurisdictional amount, you don't
try the damages issue and argue all the pros and cons.

There

is just kind of fhe idea, is it a colorable claim, isn’t it?
QUESTION;
the general teat

Is it a bona fide colorable claim?

That’s

20

QUESTIONS

Or just something trumped up, really, to

get you into federal court?
MR. OLINGER:
right.

Nell, what I*m — I just was

all

But what I’m saying is that if that’s what — if

it’s just a colorable claim, then, you know, I wonder why
$10,000 is even in the statute.
QUESTION;

Because, you know, this —

Well, they could take it out of the

statute.
MR. OLINGER; Well, yes, I ~
QUESTION;

It used to be $3,000.

MR. OLINGER; Right, it used to be $3,000, Your Honor,
QUESTION;

It may not have been a very effective

limitation, but that’s the way this Court and other courts
have read it.
QUESTION;

Yes.

QUESTION;

As being just "is it in good faith", more

or less, don’t you —
QUESTION;

It's effective when you’re talking about

a liquidated claim, like on a contract action or something
like that. But ~
MR„ OLINGER;

Yes, in there it would mean

something.
QUESTION;
MR. OLINGER;

in this kind of claim —
Here, you know, I really am almost

trying to tell the Court what I think is the proper way to

21
handle the $10,000 jurisdictional question.
The only thing I am trying to say is that when Mr*
Doyle initially filed his lawsuit, he honestly knew that the
only difference between the job that he was going to have at
Miami Trace and the job at Mt* Healthy, there was a difference
of $2,000.
Now, if we’re talking about money, that's what we’re
talking about.

If —

QUESTION;
other things.

Ho, he's talking about a whole lot of

I assume he's talking about he wanted to keep

the job that h© had, and I think he's talking about not being
put out of that job.

I think there's a whole lot than just

dollars and cents.
MR. OLINGER:

Okay, Your Honor.

Except that he did not

at the time that he filed

suit, he did not have & right to that job.

This is not a case

whether we have a tenured teacher, Your Honor.

I mean, I guess

that’s the point I’m trying to make.
QUESTION;

But —■ but, if he is right on the merits,

and therefore if the allegations in. his complaint are
sufficient, then if rehired *—• and his claim is that he should
have bean rehired ~~ then he would have had tenure under Ohio
*
law, wouldn’t he?
MR. OLINGER;
about that.

Yes, he would.

There’s no question

22
QUESTION:

All right»

QUESTION:

Whan will he get tenure in his new job?

MR» OLINGER:

He already has tenure, Your Honor»

Tenure for Mr» Doyle would have occurred after three years»
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

After three.
In the new job, Miami Trace job?

MR» OLINGER:
QUESTION:

Yes. Right.

After -three?

MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And -three is ~

QUESTION:

So you don't say —

MR. OLINGER:

I,m sorry, it’s either three, two or

three years; but he's got tenure now at Miami Trace.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. OLINGER:

He has tenure there.

QUESTION: But your —
QUESTION:

So now he has no cause of action,

according to you?
MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION:

Well, I —
Right?

MR. OLINGER:

You're right, I'm saying not only does

h© not have -QUESTION:

He doesn't have any cause of action?

MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION:

That's correctf as —

That's your position?

23

MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir* Your Honor* that is.

Because your more basic claim, jurisdic­

tional claim, is now, as I understand it, that even assuming
that -the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, exclusive of
interests and costs, and that therefore is federal jurisdiction
under Section 1331, nonetheless, your client is immune by
reason of 19 83?
MR. OLINGER:

That is correct.

And that — that is correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. OLINGER?
QUESTION:

Now, —
But let's assume for the moment that

your client is immune under 1983, —
MR. OLINGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
— suggestion is made by your opponent

that the cause of action may lie through the Fourteenth
Amendment to enforce First Amendment rights without regard to
IS83.

Would you respond to that?
MR. OLINGER:

Well, I'm going to try, Your Honor,

it's —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. OLINGER:
theory completely.

I’m not going to say I understand the

But --

QUESTION:
MR. OLINGER:

You have a lot of company on that.
All right.

I'm going to give it a try.

24
Anu let na start off by saying 'that in lb 12 the —»
there was a Constitutional Convention in Ohio»
Convention, they amended the Constitution»
after the amendment, read:

And at that,

And the Constitution,

Suits may be brought against the

State in such courts and in such manner as may be provided by
law.
And after that constitutional amendment was passed,
the issue immediately arose whether or not the State of Ohio
had abolished its sovereign immunity.
After numerous cases, particularly involving
municipalities, the Supreme Court of Ohio said:

Well, based

on Hans vs. Louisiana, based on cases in other jurisdictions,
we do not think that that provision in the Constitution is selfexecuting? that there must be a legislation enacted to carry
out that permission that has been granted by that constitutional
amendment.
QUESTION:

And that legislation could or might not

waive sovereign immunity? is that not so?
MR. OLINGER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Nov/, in the case of Aldridge vs. City of Youngstown,
which v/as decided in 1922, as I said, it became clear that if
the sovereign immunity of the State of Ohio was to be abolished,
it had to be abolished by specific provision of the Legislature.
Now, trying to apply that theory to the Fourteenth
Amendment theory and the First Amendment theory —• first of all,

25
if I understand the problem, under 19 83 it provides a remedy
and a method to carry out the Civil Rights provisions*
Nov?, the First Amendment, as I understand it, only
provides that, you know, that there shall be no violation of
the right to freedom of speech. But it doesn't provide a
remedy, et cetera.
Now, under the Fourteenth Amendment, if I understand
correctly — and this is where I may be wrong — the Fourteenth
Amendment, under Section 5, provides that the Fourteenth
Amendment can be — would be implemented or required to be
implemented by legislation passed by Congress.
Nov/, th© problem I have is I presume that that
language in the Fourteenth Amendment has to apply to the First
Amendment because, if I understand correctly, the first eight
I

Amendments apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.
And that, therefore, to carry out the First Amendment;, there
also has to be some sort of a congressional legislation in
order to carry out, you know, the provisions of the First
Amendment.
QUESTION:

And that 1983 is such legislation added,

and it imposed limits, i.e,, that your client is not a person.
MR. OLINGERs

That is correct. Your Honor.

In other words, that Congress did speak to the
subject in the 1983 area.

But they — but because the

Sherman Amendment was not adopted, the interpretation in this

26
Court has been, that it does not then apply to political entities
of the State»
Basically, that concludes my argument* and I thank
you very much»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE- BURGER;

Thank you* Mr» Olinger»

Mr„ Gottesman»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL H, GOTTESMAN* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GOTTESMAN;

Mr» Chief Justice* may it please

the Court;
It's been said that the jurisdictional issues properly
come first* and I will address them first»

But in doing so I

don't want to leave the impression that the First Amendment
claim is to be decided on the facts as they have been described
today by my colleague* Mr» Olingar»

We think the facts are

actually much more helpful to us* and I hope I am going to have
time to get to the First Amendment issue and talk about those
facts„
But* first* jurisdiction;
The complaint alleged jurisdiction on two separate
statutory grounds* predicated on two separate causes of action»
First of all* it alleged that ‘the defendant's conduct had
violated Section 1983* and the jurisdictional statute that was
then available was 1343»
Separately* it alleged that there was a cause of

27

action directly under the Fourteenth Amendment — not based
on 1983. but brought directly under the Fourteenth Amendment.
For which 1331 provided jurisdiction.
Now, let me —
QUESTION:

But 1331 would also have provided

jurisdiction on your 1983 action if more than $10*000 were
involved* exclusive of interests and costs.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Isn*t that correct.?

Well* I suppose it would, but, of

course, the plaintiff did not need 1331.
QUESTION:

You don’t need it, but it would have

also been a perfectly adequate jurisdictional statute upon
which to rely.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes, it would, if, in fact, he could

sue the school district under IS83.

That is to say, it would

only provide a jurisdictional basis for a 1983 action if he had
a cause of action under 1983? and that turns on whether the
school board is a person.
But, as we will see in a moment, our main point will
foe that the person’s limitation of 1983 is not a limitation
on a causa of action directly under the Fourteenth Amendment,
but -QUESTION:

Now, where do you get his cause of

action directly under the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR® GOTTESMAN:

Well, if I may just defer that for

one moment, it5s going to be the central focus of my discussion

28
here.
QUESTION:

Okay,

MR* GQTTESMANs

Sure.
But I do want to just say one thing

first, because if I don't say it first, I’m going to lose it.
And that is that in so far as this is a suit for reinstatement
-— let’s forget the back pay for a moment — there was clearly
jurisdiction \inder 1983 and 1343, because this was a suit
against the school board officials, in their official
capacity, as well as against the school board»
And in so far as it’s a suit against the school board
officials, the court had authority.
the meaning of 1983«

They are persons within

The court had authority to direct them to

take the step of reinstating the plaintiff.
The jurisdictional predicate here is precisely the
same as this Court has always used in all of the school
desegregation cases»
QUESTIONS

You say that’s like Ex Parte Young,

basically?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, except that we’re not concerned

about the Eleventh Amendment theory, but it’s the same kind of
thing.

You get relief, which the school board as an entity

must in fact provide, by directing the officers of the school
board to provide it.
And, indeed, I think a moment’s though will make
clear -that all of the school desegregation cases, which result

29
in orders directing school boards to take certain actions *
are 19 83 actions in which the award is obtained,, or the relief
is obtained by directing it to the school officials»

They are

directed to take certain action»
QUESTION:

Mr0 Gofctesman, here the trial court

dismissed the claim against the individual defendants, and you
did not appeal from that»
MR„ GOTTESMAN:

Welly we have a very peculiar

problem, Justice Stevens, and, in a sense, we’re going to.have
to ask for the Court’s indulgence on it„
No jurisdictional issue was raised in the district
court»

It was never asserted by the defendants, that there was

a lack of jurisdiction here.
As a result, when Idle district court found 1331
jurisdiction over the school board and provided all of the
relief that was sought, while technically the plaintiffs should
have cross»appealed from the court’s failure to keep the
school board individuals in.

And undoubtedly would have done

so, if there had been a jurisdictional issue raised in the
district court.

They were lulled into not cross-appealing

by their belief that there were no jurisdictional issues
confronting them down the road in this case.
Now, there have been a —-

QUESTION:

Why would there be an assumption, doesn't

ih© jurisdiction remain in a case right straight through?

30
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, of course.. It does, Your Honor.
And that's why I say we have to beg the Court's indulgence, if
we lose on 1331 — which I hope won't ~~
QUESTION:

Mr. Gettesman, did you cite 1331 in your

complaint?
MR. GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION!

Yes.

Yes.

MR. GOTTESMAN!

It was actually cited as 1931, but

it was a typographical error, and the district court -QUESTION: What's what I want to know. Because that's
the only reference X find is 1S3 31»
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes, it was understood by the district

qpurt as 1331, as it was noted.
If that's our only barrier, we're in good shape.
But wa would, on the point that Justice Stevens
raised, there have been a number of Court of Appeals decisions
recently, because the jurisdictional problems in this area are
so complex, that it held that a plaintiff, if he appears to
have a valid jurisdictional basis, even if h© didn't plead it
in the complaint, is entitled to have a remand so that he can
in fact so do, and so that his relief for the violation of his
constitutional rights is net forever denied him because of the
complexities of charting one's way through this jurisdictional
thicket.
QUESTION s

Well, is that a pleading point basically,

31
Mr, Gottesman, that you donsfc have to plead jurisdiction if it's
apparent from the facts?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

It*s not as broad as that. What the

Courts have essentially don© is created a special — it’s not
pleading.

They says

You’ve brought this suit and you’ve

asserted the wrong jurisdictional provision? you could
technically b® barred forever.
But, given that this is a Civil Rights action, given
teat w© have found a violation of your constitutional rights ,
given teat we believe there is an adequate jurisdictional basis
upon which this action could have been predicated, we’re going
to remand and allow you to amend the complaint.
They are not saying the complaint* in its present
form* suffices to actually raise this jurisdictional point*
©van though you haven’t recited the section by its terms,
QUESTION:

That’s not quite the same thing, though,

as saying that parties dismissed and is against whom the
dismissal has become final can be reinstated after that point.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, it’s not quite tee same.

There

have been two Fifth Circuit decisions, where they have allowed
a remand to amend the complaint to bring in additional parties*
in a context where only the entity was sued and the court con­
cluded that, the suit should have been brought against the
individuals»
QUESTION:

Thera you don’t have the res judicata

32

problem»
MR« GOTTESMAN:

Wellf that's right»

Well? we don't

have one here? either? if this Court allows the remand? because
we're still in the same cause of action? I think,
QUESTION:

But? Mr, Gotfcesman? if we allowed a

remand? you really wouldn't have to amend your complaint.
Your complaint is perfectly all right,
MR» GOTTESMAN:

The complaint is perfect.

The

problem is that —•
QUESTION:

What we would have to be doing is remanding

to let you take an appeal you didn't take,
MR, GOTTESMAN:

In essence. And that's why I say we

beg the Court's indulgence on it.

Because? obviously? we don't

have a right to that.
But let me go on? because there are obviously more
basic —
QUESTION:

Under that position? then? you can't

seek reinstatement,
MR, GOTTESMAN:

I suppose we are in the position that

we cannot proceed to seek reinstatement under 1983 against idle
school officials in their official capacities, for want of an
appeal having been taken,
I 'think that's where we are at.

And? assuming we

are right on the merits ? a teacher who was in fact right? who
brought this lawsuit? who secured complete relief in the

v

33
district court# and who presumptively, for the moment# is going
to have it on the merits affirmed# if only the Court will
recognize the jurisdictional basis# will go without relief#
reinstatement»
Bixfc let me go on# because I think we avoid the problem
if we are right that there is jurisdiction against the school
board»
Now# neither the district court nor -the Court of
Appeals has decided either of the 1983 '’person" questions#
which would have to be decided if the Court were going to say
that relief cannot be obtained under 1983«

And those two

questions are the following:

MR. GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

No relief.

MR. GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

Any relief.

It*s immune from liability under 19 83.

MR. GOTTESMAN:
not an immunity.

Any relief.

Well, it's not — Your Honor, it is

It is simply that Congress did not create a

cause of action against them.
QUESTION:

Well, because the statute doesn't

create a cause of action against a municipality.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

That’s correct.

And it’s important

that it’s not an immunity, as I will get to in a moment.
Now, -—
QUESTION:

It doesn’t fit under the word "person”.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Right.

Now, neither ‘the district court nor the Court of
Appeals has decided whether this school district is a person
in the sam® sense that a municipality is.

We have not briefed

that question, because neither court readied it.

It was our

view that if this Court found jurisdiction was improper under

35
1331 s feat the appropriate sfcsp would be a remand for fee
district court t.o decide an issue which neither it nor fee
Court of Appeals ever reached.

Particularly so because the

issue may turn-- not necessarily but may turn -- upon the
precise status of school districts in Ohio.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Directly under the Fourth Amendment

QUESTION:

And there is no federal analog of 1933,

MR. GOTTESMAN:

That's correct.

But the point was that the Fourth Amendment itself#
coupled with the jurisdictional power granted by 1331# which
enabled the federal courts to decide all questions arising
under the Constitution# was sufficient to allow a cause of
action for damages.
Now# for the moment# not. against a municipality — we

It didn’t imply that Congress, if it did enact a
statute, could not have put limitations on it.
MR. GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s true.

That was what I -— that was the point of

my question.
MR. GOTTESMAN:
chronology here.

But I think we have to recall the

When the Fourteenth Amendment was passed or

enacted in the late 1860’s, there was no federal question
jurisdiction in the federal.courts.

And so Section 5 of the

Fourteenth Amendment, of necessity, had to say, as it did say,
Congress will enact such legislation as will be necessary to

39

provide for the enforcement of this Amendment»
That was necessary because the whole predicate of the
Amendment was there ought to be a federal cause of action,, and
there was no federal jurisdiction to enforce it»
How- Congress’s first response to that, to Section 5
\

of the Fourteenth Amendment, was the enactment of the Civil
Rights Act of 1871, which contained both -»«- what are both
now 1983 and 1343.

The cause of action and the jurisdictional

provision were enacted together, to provide a cause of action
for damages under the Fourteenth Amendment.
How. at that time, in 1871, Congress, taking its
first tentative step in this area, made the judgment not to
permit suits against municipalities, or at least so this Court
held in Monroe v. Pap®.

There are many commentators who think

that’s a misreading of the legislative history, but we would
accept that we are obviously bound by Monroe v, Paps;.
In 1871, Congress said:

We don’t want to create this

cause of action against the municipality itself, but only
against the officials.
And if that’s where things stood, there would foe no
predicate for bringing a suit in federal court against the
municipality„
But four years later Congress enacted 1331,

At that

time it expressed non® of the cautions that it had expressed in
1871.

Indeed, as this Court has repeatedly commented in

40

discussing 1331* its intention

, with certain very specific

exceptions, to invest the federal courts with the entire body
of federal question jurisdiction* which constitutionally could
b© invested in them»
QUESTIONi

Well* how do you explain Bell vs, Hood's

reservation of the point* ultimately decided in Bivens * if it’s
that clear?
MR. GOTTESF-SAN% Well* what Bell vs. Hood said was that,
whan one -- and I think really this is all this Court needs to
decide in this case* and I’ll get to that in a moment ~ Bell
vs. Hood said* if a plaintiff comes into federal court and
says "I claim a cause of action directly under an amendment
of the Constitution”* and he asserts that $10*000 is in
controversy* the federal courts have jurisdiction to decide that
claim on -the merits.
Nov;* the Court* in Bell v, Hood* said there are a lot,
of questions the Court is going to have to decide on the merits.
The first question it's going to have to decide on the merits
is* is liier© such a cause of action directly under the
Amendment?
But* as Bell v. Hood emphasized* that's a question
on the merits* not a jurisdictional question.
And if the Court says* yes* there’s a cause of action?
then it’s going to have to go on and decide the other merits
questions* you know* Do you have a good claim under that cause

41
of action?
But it*s our view, and w@ have a footnote in our
brief to this effect,. it‘s our view that# as the defendant has
never, throughout these proceedings# challenged the existence
of the cause of action under the Fourteenth Amendment as a
merits issue, that that issue isn*fe properly here.

QUESTION:

— your position then would be, and perhaps

it.8s right, is that a plaintiff, ©ven though the --- in fact

42

you cannot sue a municipal corporation under 1331, because
1983 places limitations on it, and you have to — that's the
only way you can get into court because of that, even though
1331 is on the books.

You would say that if the plaintiff

says, 541 have a claim under 1983‘3 and nothing is raised about
jurisdiction, the rest of it is a merits question?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, not a claim under 1983.

A

claim directly under -the Fourteenth Amendment.
This complaint alleged a cause of action under the
Fourteenth Amendment with jurisdiction on 1331.

The

defendant challenged jurisdiction, because he said ~~ he didn’t,
even challenge that until the Court of Appeals, but there he
said there wasn't $10,000 in controversy.
disputed the

But. he never

existence of a cause of action under the

Fourteenth Amendment, which is a merits question, Bell v. Hood
says.
He never disputed it in the district court, he never
disputed it in the Court of /appeals, and he did not identify it:
as a question presented to this Court.

And in our view,

therefore, that merits question,is there such a thing as a
cause of action directly under the Fourteenth Amendment, is
not. before the Court.
^UESTIOfJ:

However, if you are wrong and it’s in

fact a jurisdictional question rather than a merits question,
then I take it that the other view would prevail?

43

MR» GOTTESMAN:

Yes»

Clearly, if it is a jurisdie-

tional question, it is before the Court»
I would urge the Court, if the Court were so minded,
and I think Bell v. Hood is squarely to the contrary, that
before 'the Court decides an. issue of that import, it ought to
have briefs, because this is an issue — the lower courts are
deciding this issue by the legions»

You will have ample

opportunity to decide it in a case when it's properly briefed»
You can even direct further briefing in this case.
But I view with real trepidation -that the Court would
decide the issue without briefs.

We have a lot we x^ould like

to say on that issue, but we didn't understand that issue to be
properly before the Court»
Because, as wa read Bell v. Hood, it was not a
jurisdictional question but a merits question, 'which was not
raised.
Well, the remaining jurisdictional question here is
amount in controversy, and really, with my limited time, I8d
like to go on to other issues»

I think we dealt with that in

our brief»
QUESTION;

Let m© just ask one other question on

the parson issue.
Do you agree that the issue of whether or not the
school board is a person is a jurisdictional issue?
MR» GOTTESMAN:

That’s interesting»

No, I guess —

44
it never occurred to me until Your Honor asked the question,»
But, obviously, for the same reason, the answer is no,it is
not jurisdiction»

Although jurisdiction does depend on it»

That is to say, if I allege a cause of action under
1983 saying that a school board is a person, that's a merits
questions

Is there such a cause of action?

And yet juris­

diction — I guess the mere allegation of it, in the same way
that Bell v» Hood does, the mere allegation of that cause of
action confers jurisdiction? but if the Court decides on the
merits -that the school board is not a person, then, on the
merits you fail on your cause of action»
QUESTION?
proof»

I'm just wondering who has the burden of

Because it doesn't seem to me that anybody really

addressed himself to the problem in the district court, even
in the pleadings»
MR» GOTTESMAN:

Well, one of the terrible problems

about this case, Your Honor, is that almost every issue that's
before this Court, and there are all terribly important issues,
is here without having been raised by the defendants in the
district court, with no record, and a record would have been
rae.de both on jurisdiction and the Eleven to Amendment if they
had been put in issue.

I can assure the Court that we would

have made one.
QUESTION:

Well, of course, if they are jurisdic­

tional issues, then it was the plaintiff's job to push them.

45
brief them, and make a record on them.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, that’s always true, Your Honor.

But I think the true meaning of Bell v» Hood is that a plaintiff
who comas into federal court and says, ”1 have a cause of
action, and this is my cause of action”, and who cites the
appropriate jurisdictional provisions which that cause of
action would trigger, in fact has properly asserted jurisdiction.
And it then lies with the defendant to challenge the existence
of the cause of action or

-that’s not really an, accurate

statement, it always lies with the plaintiff to establish his
cause of action.
But if the defendant never disputes the existence
of the cause of action, that's a merite question, and the
defendant is going — if the Court accepts that there is such
a cause of action, the defendant is going to be stuck with it.
QUESTIONj

But if the defendant never disputes the

existence of jurisdiction, —
MR. GOTTESMAN;
QUESTION;

No, the Court is always free to --

— then -the court is always free.

And

so it becomes vary important whether or not this is a juris­
dictional question or a merits question.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

That’s right.

Now, on both questions, this Court does not have
briefing from the parties.

Both questions are of — I can’t

describe what great importance they are for school desegregation

46

QUESTION;

When was the Eleventh Amendment issue

raised?
MR» GOTTKSMAN:

In the — the Eleventh Amendment

issue was raised in the opening appellate brief by the defend­
ant —
QUESTION:

In the Court of Appeals?

MR» GOTTESMAN;

In the Court of Appeals»

This Court held, in —
QUESTION;
any court below?

So it’s never really been addressed by

47
MRe GOTTESMAN;

Well, the district court raised it

on its own motion — I think that’s how the defendant
discovered that it existed*
QUESTION:

But it just said that it wasn’t raised*

MR* GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, no, it

said it’s been waived*

After that, in the same paragraph 9, Mr*

Justice White*
QUESTION:

Yes*

But then it was never really

discussed by any court at any -MR* GQTTESMAN:

No*

It was briefed by both sides

in the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals affirmed
without mentioning it, and so it5a here again in this
peculiar posture, that a terribly important issue on which -**"
on all of these issues, incidentally, all of the Courts of
Appeals are ruling in our favor; that’s obviously not
controlling in this Court.

But we would certainly like to

bring to this Court’s attention the analytical guidance that
those lower courts have provided, before this Court rules on
them.
But the Eleventh Amendment issue is terribly important*
It has never been discussed by the lower courts in this case*
If it had been raised in 'the district court, we would have
made a record, we would have shown that there isn’t any
possible way that this judgment would have cost ‘the State a
penny, that there is an independent entity, the school board,

which is not the alter-ego of fch© State -QUESTION;

Of course, you know, from Ford Motor

Company, that can be raised on appeal»
MR» GOTTESMAN:
Eclelman, Your Honor.

Well, we at least know it from

I’m not s-are about —

QUESTION: Well, Ed©Iraan relied on Ford Motor Company?
SO

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes, it did.

There’s no question that

it did.
QUESTION:

— you are under fair warning on that in

the district court, I think»
MR. GOTTESMAN:
it is a defense»

Again, we are under fair warning, but

And on that one this Court said, both in

Edelman and in Sosna vs» Iowa, the Eleventh Amendment is a
defense»

It’s a defense that they don’t waive by failing to

raise it in the district court. They can assert this defense
for the first time in the Court of Appeals, or even in the
Supreme Court.

But it is, nonetheless, a defense.

And the plaintiff doesn’t have the burden to come in
and prove the nonexistence of an immunity which is not asserted
by the defendant.
This Court, I believe in Sosna, said it was an
affirmative defense.

So I don’t want to overstay.

In any event, had it been raised, and it is a defensa,
I think, had it been raised, we t^ould have made a record.

That.

49
record would have shown beyond peradventure of doubt that an
award in this case of back pay will not impact upon th©
treasury of the State of Ohio, that it would impact only on
the treasury of the school board»
And beyond that, it seems to me, we had a further
point to make, which w@ do make in our brief, which iss
Even if for some reason we couldn’t collect this from the
school board, and the school board has been tendering sugges­
tions to this Court that maybe they couldn’t get the voters to
approve a bond issue or a tax levy or whatever, even if we
were unable to collect, that wouldn’t implicate the State
treasury.

We wouldn’t be the first plaintiffs who got a

judgment that was uncollectible.
But it wouldn’t give us a cause of action then
against the State, to make the State pay it»
against th® school beard.
QUESTION:

It's a judgment

And if —

I would — I, for one, would be interested

in -— it's up to you, if you would like to spend yovrbrief
remaining moments in discussing the merits.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Okay»

Thank you, Your Honor,

There are two merits questions»

They are both

fascinating.
Th© first one iss

Was th,© school board entitled to

rely on the phone call in making its decision not to renew
this teacher’s employment?

50

We think the answer to that is clearly that they
were not entitled to rely on it. We brief that at some length,
and I think as carefully as we could? and. in my limited time
I would like to reach the other question? which is really
new to this Court.
And that is:

How are the federal courts to deal

with this situation, in which it*s found that a school board or
another public employer has relied on more than one reason in
reaching its decision not to continue employment?
One of those reasons is an impermissible reason?
upon which it had no right to rely; and the other one or more
I think the district court fairly read found that there
were only two reasons here -— the second reason was a reason
upon which they could rely.
Does that mean automatically
QUESTION:

Well, one was the misconduct in the

lunchroom, cafeteria —
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Those things — the letter they

gave him, saying what was wrong,
QUESTION:

Well, you say two, then. One was the

telephone call to WSj\I —
MR. GOTTESMAN:

The other was the gesture to the

students in the lunchroom.
QUESTION:

The obscene gesture to the students.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Characterized as obscene.

51

QUESTION:

Well* an indelicate gesture.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well* I*11 accept it as obscene.

In any event* v/e do not assert that that's a
Fiv’gfc Amendment protected gesture* so —
QUESTION:

;

So you concede that on© was a proper

foundation* and submit that the other was not.
MR. GOTTESMAN:.

That’s right.

When we say ~~ we admit that the first would have
been a proper foundation if that is in fact what would have
actuated the board* alone* to decide not to renew.
QUESTION:

Isn’t that second ground something

broader than just a single episode?
MR. GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

Isn’t it a ~

Well* that’s* I guess. —

*— broad question of his lack of

maturity?
MR. GOTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

Well* there was a dispute between —

And then there are perhaps a dosen

elements under that.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well* at most* there are only five

that were testified by witnesses* including the phone call.
So there are four

the two plus three others.

The critical piece of evidence upon which the district
court appears to have relied* and certainly it supports the
district court’s finding* was the letter they gave to the
teacher when he said* "Why did you deny me renewal?"

And they

52
said, one-two.
But, be that as it may, whether it's two or five, we
have a case —*
QUESTION:

In which one is valid?

In your submission.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

All right.

Now, if we could only know what the school board
would have done, but for the phone call, we would know how to,
it seems to me, how to deal with this case.

If we knew, for

example, that but for the phone call the school board would
have given him his contract, then it’s clear that as a remedy
he ought to get his contract.
On the other hand, if we knew that the other one or
more incidents, standing alone, would have convinced them to
deny him renewal, then.it*s clear that he ought not to get
his contract as a remedy, or back pay.
But we can't know.

Not only do we not know, we canM:

knox-?. Because, as a result of the improper reliance on that
one issue, the school board never mad© the decision it was
supposed to make.
QUESTION:

But that assumes the improper reliance.

QUESTION: There was reliance.
MR. GOTTESMANs

Yes, it assumes that there was

reliance on this, which the district court found, and which —*
QUESTION:

Yes, but you have to assume it was improper.

53

MR* GQTTESMAN% We h&v® to assume 'that this was *—
that the first —QUESTION:

That the first question is thus in your

favor*
MR. GQTTESMAN:

Yes*

That’s right.

And I have

urged the Court that — since I have now one minute — we
brief the proposition that it's improper, and I want to address
the question of how does the Court remedy this —
QUESTION: But your argument has to be that you may
not even rely on a phone call to show lack of tact*
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. GQTTESMAN:
QUESTION:

In the facts of this case.

Because that’s protected First Amendment

activity.
MR. GQTTESMAN:
was not

Right.

And because it’s not — he

it was not a tactless phone call.

They just put

"tact" as a label on th® fact that he made the phone call.
Now, our view is that guidance is provided in a
number of areas, of what you do when you have a mixed motive,
improper decision.

Which is that you put th© burden on the

wrongdoer, as Judge Learned Hand said in a very similar NLRB
case, to disentangle the consequences for which he is chargeafola from those for which he is immune from responsibility.
It’s his burden to persuade the trier of fact that
even without this incident h® would have reached th© same

54
decision.
This Court; applied that same standard under Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act last year in Franks vs. Bowman
Transportation* saying that where race was a factor in an
employer’s decision to deny employment to somebody

,

that

doesn’t mean that h© might not have denied employment to him
anyway, but the burden is going to be on the employer to show
that he would have readied the sam© decisionf even if race had
nc>fc been a factor.
Now, these have all been statutory causes of action*
where the violation of a statutory right shifted the burden to
the defendant»

And we submit that the rule surely must be

at least the sam© whan it's a violation of one's constitutional
right* which has created this mixed motive dilemma; that the
burden must be on the defendant.
And* as we explain in our brief* there was no evidence
introduced in this cas© from which the court could have found*
and indeed the court did not find, that the defendant met that
burden.
QUESTION:

Before you sit down — excuse me* excuse

roe *— Before you sit down* just let me ask you this:
Wouldn't it be true that however we decided this' case*
it would* so far as future- conduct went and future behavior
on the part of school boards around the country* it would be
almost meaningless* or else it would put them in a terribly bad
9

55
trap, because, let's assume that — let's assume, that if w©
decide the case in your favor, thereafter, wouldn’t it be true
that any incompetent teacher, who knew that because of his
incompetence or misconduct or bad. behavior, he was not going
to be rehired, could simply go out and make a speech, a very
insulting speech against the school board, and if that were
any part of their decision not to rehire him, then he wotild
have to be rehired, despite his misconduct and incompetence,
on the one hand?
And wouldn’t it mean, on the other hand, that if we
decide it in your favor, that any school board that could read,
or whose lawyer could read, would know that when they failed
to rehire a candidate, a -teacher, all they had to do was not
mention this speech? and then they could fail to rehire him®
So, aren’t we just talking about meaningless words?
It might win or lose your case, but from the point of view of
future conduct, it would be meaningless?
MRa GOTTESMAN:

I think not, Your Honor, any more

where —• which forbids discharges based on union activity or
abstention from union activity®

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR, GOTTESMAN:

There are a variety of those.

The other side of the coin is, to us, more trouble­
some? which is, if we don't have a burden on the defendant in
the mixed motive cases, every school board that wants to fire
a defendant for a First Amendment reason will simply —* no
teacher can teach for five years without having don® something
that somebody could find objectionable — even though their
motivation is solely th® First Amendment reason, they will
just tack on two or thre© other incidents that are just *—

MR» GOTTESMAN:

First Amendment speech, but we also notice that two years ago
