MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Company, Incorporated»
Mr* Smith, you may proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A* SMITH. ESQ*
FOR THE PETITIONER
MR* SMITH:

Mr* Chief* Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a Federal income tax case which comes here
on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit*

It involves Section 172 of the

Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which permits carrybacks and
carryovers of hat operating loss deductions*
The question presented is whether Respondent, a
corporation, can cany back a $42,000 loss incurred in 19*58
as an offset against its 19*55 taxable income of $174,000
and thereby reduce its taxable income to $132,000, and after
that offset take $35,000 of that $42,000 loss and use it as
an offset against its 1967 taxable income*
No submit that from a mathematical and statutorystand point the answer to this question is plainly no,
$42,000 can only be used once to offset the $174,000 of
taxable income and no part remains for further use as an
offset for 1957*

The facts are fairly straightforward and were
stipulated to the District Court and can be 'summarized as
f ollows *
In 1966, Respondent had taxable income of $174,000*
In 1968s it had a loss, a net operating loss, of $42,000,
Pursuant to Section 172, Respondent carried back its $42,000
loss to the third year, that is, 1966, and then proceeded to
compute its 1966 tax liability as if it, that $42,000 loss,
was incurred in that earlier year*
Now, the< Code for Corporations prescribes two
methods of taxation* One, the so«oalied regular method under
Section 11 of the Code, provides for regular corporate in­
come tax rates*

In this case, that regular method yielded a

tax liability of $58,000, that is, those are the corporate
rates on $132,000 of taxable income, which was the $174,000
minus the $42,000«
Now, under Section 1201(a) of the Code, Respondent
was required to compute its tax under the alternative tax
computation which corporations can avail themselves of when
they have capital gains*

It engaged in the prescribed compu­

tation which we have set forth in our brief at page 4, under
The Alternative Method*
step approach

It took — basically* it's a two-

It took its $173*000, or what we say was

$174,000, essentially, subtracted the $42,000 loss, got
taxable income of a131,000, or $132,000*

And then what it had

to do was to subtract out Its capital gains.

Baa icallty, the

Step One operation of the tax yielded ?.;ero or a negative
number»
It then had to compute the capital gains segment,
the Step Two part of the partial tax, the capital gains tax.
which was a flat 25$ of the $166,000 of what the statute
refers to as long-term capital gain over short-term capital
loss, but for these purposes we will simply call capital gains,
and it got a tax liability of $41,000«
Now, under the Code, Respondent was required to
report its tax liability under the lower ~~ under the method
that yielded the lower liability»

So it did and it paid tax

of $41,000 in 1966«
Now, this suit involves the year 196?«

Respondent

filed a refund claim and asserted that even though its
$42,000 loss had been used to offset its taxable income in
its entirety, that somehow it still had $35>000 of this loss
which was available to offset income in X9&7*
Respondent's claim, essentially, is that a segmented
approach is the proper approach, and that is that the $42,000
1968 loss should ,only be offset against its $7,000 of ordinary
income and that yielded $35>000 for use in a subsequent year»
The District Court in Missouri ..upheld Respondent !s

In so holding,

I think it is significant that the

6
Eighth Circuit acknowledged that its beIdlog -.-jar; contrary to
the Treasury regulations.which were promulgated shortly after
the 1954 codification and have existed more or less in the
same state ever since»
QUESTION;

On the other hand, the Eighth Circuit-

had a consistent holding in the tax court and elsewhere,
MR» SMITH:

That is true, Mr* Justice Blaekmun«

I

was just getting to that»
QUESTION:

That's a little more persuasive than

Treasury regulations *
MR* SMITH:

Well- we think the Treasury regulations

are correct and we think the tax court in this case is in­
correct., as I will attempt to demonstrate*
At the time of the Eighth Circuit's decision, the
First Circuit and the Ninth Circuit had. indeed, rejected the
Government's position, taut albeit in brief procuream affirm­
ances*

In fact, the First Circuit characterized this question

an unimportant and seldom occurring, even though I think that
subsequent developments -have Indicated that the issue is
important and frequently occurring®
In our petition for certiorari, we told the Court
that there are about $34 million of taxes riding on this
issue and that frequently occurs because of the operation
of the alternative tax and the net operating loss carryback®
I think it is fair to characterize the Court of

7
Appeals decision as influenced largely by tie cumulative
weight of two appellate decisions rejecting the Government’s
position*

But thereafter, in fact, within three or four

months after the decision in this case, the Fourth Circuit
rendered its decision in Mutual Assurance Society v.
Commissioner which we submit to the Court is a well reasoned
and proper analysis of the statutory problem here.

Thereafter,

the Sixth Circuit,in Axelrod v, € (palssioner , upheld the
Commissioner's position in a case involving an individual
taxpayer, tout its opinion largely criticizes the Tax Court’s
decision in Chartlev Real Estate Company and speaks approv­
ingly of the Fourth Circuit's decision in Mutual.Assurance
Company.
The resolution of this problem depends upon a
careful analysis of the applicable statutory provision which
in this case is Section 172(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue
Code,
We have set out the pertinent part of this provision
at the-top of page 18 of our ,brief•

The statute reads:

“The portion of such loss which shall be carried
to each of the other taxable years shall be the excess, if any,
of the amount of such loss over the sum of the taxable income
for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be
carried,11
QUESTION:

Isn't the key phrase, in your submission

8
at least, "taxable income," and the technical meaning of that?
MR, SMITH:

Indeed, Mr. Justice Stewart»

We submit

that taxable income is a statutory term of art and that it is
defined in Section 63 of the Code which we have set forth at
page 36 in our Appendix to our brief on the merits which,
again, says that "taxable income means gross income, minus
the deductions allowed by this chapter.”
Now, in 1986, the Respondent’s taxable income was
$174,000»

Carrying back that loss and determining the excess,

if any, of the amount of such loss over the sum of the taxable
income for 1986, demonstrates, in our view, that that loss is
completely absorbed and that there is no longer any part of it
available for use in a subsequent taxable year.
Now, Respondent, basically, does not dispute the
definition of taxable income which is set forth very plainly
in the Code.

But it submits that because it used the alterna­

tive tax computation in the earlier year that somehow that
requires a different result in this case.
Now, we submit that the statutory language is plain
and that this operation of subtracting $42,000 from $174,000,
yielding $132,000 in taxable income is dictated by the statute,
and that there is no basis for Inferring any further modifi­
cations from the statutory term "taxable income.”
Indeed, if the Court would examine Section 172(d)
of the Code, you will find that there are basically a group of

9
modifications that Congress has prescribed from the tern
"taxable income,"

But the modification that Respondent seeks

to ingraft on the Code is not here.

These are detailed

statutes and we think, in the first instance, the language has
to be employed pretty much.,in a mechanical sort of way because
these are detailed and mechanical statutes designed to provide
limited kinds of relief for averaging, so to speak, and
alleviating some of the harsh results that might be caused
by the annual accounting method which is sort of the bedrock
of our tax system,
QUESTION;

I understand your position.

You think

the language is perfectly clear, but it is true, is it not,
that the 'Pax Court takes a different view as to the meaning
of the language, particularly the meaning of "taxable income"
in the context in which it is used?
MR* SMITH;
QUESTION:

That is true
it can't be all that clear, can it, if

the agency
MR, SMITH:

Weil, as we argue in our brief, we think,

and as the Fourth Circuit has set forth at great length in
its opinion, we think that the Tax Court's reading of the
statute is somewhat forced and unnatural because it would
require the insertion of — bear with me a minute.

Looking

again at page 2k of our brief which sets forth the statute
again, we say here ",..the Tax Court's construction views the

10
statute as if it reads—*.,» the. sura of the taxable income
j/fco which such loss may be carried/ for each of the prior
taxable years to which such loss may be carried,,*"
Indeed, the phrase,

"to which such loss may be

carried," would have to be repeated twice in order to shore
up the Tax Court's construction, or as we would submit
modification of the statute.
But as the Fourth Circuit pointed out, even if you
were to say that loss had to foe carried back against taxable
income, it still requires some substantial, we think, re­
writing of the statute,

You would have to say loss carried

back against taxable income which,
same $174,000,

in this case, is still the

But you would have to further say but only

to the extent that there was no reduction in tax liability.
We think the fact there was a reduction in tax
liability here for 1966, this is a function of Congress'
attempt to impose a lesser burden on long-term capital gains.
And we think this is basically a statutory tradeoff.
Essentially, you either get the alternative tax benefits °h
you get the operation of the net operating loss carryback.
We think that it Is improper for the Tax Court to

have concluded

that these benefits be pyramided. in ef fee t #.

Otherwise,

the corporation would have had to pay a $58,000 tax.

the loss of a $35*00 loss which, In effect,

is worth $17,500

is made up, pretty much equally by the difference between

You know, this is basically a statutory tracleup.

QUESTION:

Isn't it true that that $17.-000 isn’t

pure coincidence?
MR* SMITH:

I think it is, but I think it is a

helpful gauge in this case because, essentially, corporations
generally pay a tax on 50$ of their taxable Income.

In this

particular case, they are paying a tax on $25/000 of a larger
base.
He think that, essentially, you can't sort of
cumulate these benefits and we think that the statutory
language

the use of the term, "taxable income,11 signals

Congress® clear intent to provide this kind of strict
rna thema tica1 equa tion»
I think,if there is .evidence in the legislative
history here, I think I can enter the Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit's exploration of the history of this statute
which indicated that this result, the result that the tax­
payer seeks in this case, would not have been available under
Section 122(d) of the 1939 Code which did not use the phrase
"to which the taxable11-- you know that last phrase,
years to which such loss may be carried.

"prior tax

It simply talked

about "over net income of the intervening year."
I think the fact that Congress reenacted this
statute without any attempt to buttress, you know, the
Committee report is totally silent.
prior law is reaffirmed.

It said, essentially,

And prior law, under the old statute,

13

clearly would have rejected the taxpayer’s position.
I also think that it is not without coincidence
that shortly after the 195^- Code was codified and before the
Tax Court decided — rendered its Char tier decision, that the
commentary was uniformly to the effect that there could be
situations where a loss would be *— quote -- lost, so to speak,
that, essentially, you are either going to get the alternative
tax computation or you are going to get the net operating loss
carryback.
Then, after Chartler came down, I must confess that
I’ve looked into this question ancl asked people in the Internal
Revenue Service and they received a lot of calls from private
tax people also expressing surprise about the Chartier decision.
And I know that the history of this litigation is somewhat
dogged from the Commissioner’s point of view.

We have sought

to establish a conflict of decisions and we have succeeded,
but it’s basically because we think that our approach corres­
ponds with the legislative history.
The post-Chartier commentary is pretty much uniformly
in our favor, as well.

Since the filing our our briefs, a new

article has come out, more or less, so to speak, to balance
a critical — the only critical article we have been able to
find in the Tax Lawyer which is the publication of the ABA
section on taxation, but an article in 29 Tax Lawyer in Fall
1975 issue, entitled, "Net Operating Losses in Capital Gains,

14
a Deceptive Combination»"

That, again, supports the

Commissioner5s view that you can't cumulate, and it supports
the view of the Fourth Circuit that you can't cumulate the
benefits of these provisions*
I think it's also useful, if I may, to sort of try
to explore for a moment the underpinnings of this.whole net
operating loss deduction and to demonstrate, as I think can
be done, that the Fourth Circuit's approach here is eminently
a sound one*

For example, what the net operating loss carry­

back deduction is attempting to do is to, in effect, say okay,
this $42,000 loss occurred in 1968 but we are going to pretend
as if it occurred in 1966, and let's assume that it occurred
in 1966,
I think, in this case, it is absolutely plain that
what would happen would be that the same $4l,000 of tax would
be paid by the taxpayer and that there would be no net operating
loss carryover.

There would be no net operating loss, for that

year.
QUESTION:

Or to put it a different way, if in

1968 he had the same income picture as he, in fact, had in
1966, there would have been no excess loss,
MR* SMITH:

Exactly.

is that right?

Exactly.

To the extent that there have been complaints about
timing and that our position, more or less,exacerbates acci­
dents of timing, as Mr. Justice Stewart points out the taxpayer's

15
position also turns on the timing of these things,
I think the fact that —
QUESTION:

Are you trying to say that you are glad

Mr. Justice Stewart asked that question?
(laughter)
QUESTION:

Let me ask you this and let's see if

you are glad about this one.
Is it correct that if a taxpayer has a lower tax
by use of the alternative method that he must use that method?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
He has no option?
That is statutorily prescribed,
I don't know if you are glad or sorry

about that question, but I just —
MR, SMITH:
be glad nor sorry.

I think in this sphere you can neither
There are things that just are.

These

are legislative pronouncements and we think that the statutory
language is such that to demonstrate that this loss is no
longer available for use in 1967«
I just want to mention one other point and chat is
this decision in Well vw Commissioner which seems to have been
covered at length in the briefs, and that is that the Tax
Court held, in Well, that when you use the alternative tax
computation you cannot take an ordinary loss and net it
against your capital gains segment.

16
Now, while that- is an independent sc rot of rule, we
think that its existence and the fact that it has never been
questioned is instructive for the issue here,

And that is

simply there is a situation where deductions ere lost, so to
speak.

They can't be used, but this is simply a fact that

Congress is giving with one hand the benefits of the 25$ flat
rate and taking something away with the other.

That decision

was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit and it has never been
questioned since.
We think here the some rationale applies.

Yes, there

is a loss of the benefit of a deduction that might'otherwise
be available, but we don't think the tax law concerns itself
with what might otherwise be available.

These are the facts*

These are the configurations of income and the statutory net­
work has to be applied in its prescribed manner.
We think when it is applied in its prescribed manner
the answer is simply that the Fourth Circuit was right and that
the Tax Court, in Chartier leal Estate Company.was wrong*
I don't have anything further to say unless there
are questions,
QUESTION:

I take it that in figuring the alternative

tax, the taxable income still exceeds the amount of the loss
carryback?
MR* SMITH:
taxable income »» yes*

In figuring the alternative tax, the
Yes,

17
QUESTION:

I mean, any way you. figure it, even

though the rate is lower and they are sifting out capital
gains, the taxable income to which the 25% rate is applied is
still exceeds —
ME, SMITH:

Taxable income is a statutory term*

And

taxable income, we submit, no matter how you view it, how you
parce it, in this case, is $132,000«,

Thatfs what • • the tax

base is $166,000, but the taxpayers taxable income, in this
case -» no matter what method is applied — is $132,000.
QUESTION:

So, any way you figure ti e tax, the

taxable income exceeds the amount of the loss carryback?
MR, SMITH:

Yes.

I have nothing further»

I8d like to «save the rest

of my time for rebuttal,
QUESTION:

I suppose, Mr, Smith, as far as the

Government is concerned, the burr on the sadIn is Judge Raam's
decision in Chartier.
MR» SMITH:

That is the burr on the sadle.

It is

really the only exposition of the problem rejecting our
position, and we think that it pretty much relied on — it
stands on two prongs:
or, you know, the

one, this extrapolatior of the statute
you know, essentially saying that the

loss is carried back to taxable income and that taxable income
is only that ordinary income segment.
as a statutory matter*

We think that is wrong

18
And the other thing that Judge Raam relied on is
this rationale which was expressed by the Court in Libson Shops
v» Koehler, but as we point out in our reply brief, this is
not ~~ you know, the net operating loss carryback and carry
forward provisions are not a fluid system to enable the tax­
payer to sort of use a loss to hunt around for a place where it
will do some benefit*

In fact, the three years back and five

years forward is essentially a statutory system designed to
say well, at some point, we are going to cut off these benefits
and reassert the strictures, however harsh they may be, of the
annual accounting system,
We think that to the extent that there is policy here
it has to be squared with the detailed rules that Congress
prescribed,

1 refer the Court to its three decisions in

Wolford Realty Company, Lew It and Olympic Radio, and Rea 1
Motors, where the Court, more or less, said that these things
are detailed rules and they have to be prescribed with their
detailed verbiage,
Indeed, in Real Motors, their loss carryover was
denied, basically, because of timing.

While that may sadden

a particular taxpayer, we think that's really a question for
Congress to address itself and not for the statute to be

Mr. Baker,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUSSELL W. BAKER* ESQ.
FOR THE RESPONDENT
MR, BAKER:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please the

Court:
The Government's real position* to us* is this;
That our net operating loss is to be wasted in our circumstances,
That's a different way of putting it than we have been charged
with in the argument which was just concluded,
Now* I mean by wasted that it cannot be used to off­
set income in another year* income which was taxed at 48#«
The Government says* and it made a very clear state­
ment of its case* that the capital gain in 1966 on which we

21
paid tax is deemed to absorb our loss, leaving it unavailable
for use in the following year.
The consequence Is that on that part of the capital
gain which absorbs loss, we pay* effectively* 73# in taxes*

25# capital gains tax and 48# by not being able to use the
loss the following year.
Now* today* in 1976* were the problem to arise* the
alternative tax now being 30#* the compounded effect desired

by the Government would be 30 plus 48* or 78#.»
QUESTION:

Mr. Baker* the Government argues that

precisely the same thing* in essence* would have happened if
the loss had occurred in 1966* the same year in which the
capital gain had occurred.
What ”8 your response to that argument along the line
you are drawing now?
MR. BAKER:

Mr. Justice Stevens* that situation is

what I often call the same-year situation.

It is a situation

where the — a deficit in ordinary income occurs in the same
year that one has a large capital gain.
The Weil case which has been much mooted in
arguments before this Court, says — and it said in 195^ and*
so far as I know* it has been unlormly followed —
' QUESTION:
MR. BAKER:

1956.
1956?

It says that if it occurs in the same year the one

22
does not offset the other, the full capital gain must be
taxed under the alternative method and there is no reduction
of it by reason of the deficit in ordinary income»
Now, the Tax Court has looked at this and it has
found that the directions In the alternative tax statute on
this very point are unqualified and it has no choice»

This is

what the unqualified directions of the statute say and,
therefore, there is no reduction in tax there
I see a further question, perhaps, on your face or
in your mind, and that is in such case is there a net operating
loss to be carried over to another year?
The answer is there is not because Subsections C and
~J

of the statute tell just exactly how that is to be computed,

So that in the same year situation one must agree that the
loss disappears*

It does a vanishing act,

QUESTION:

Why should there be a different rule for

a different year situation?
MR» BAKER:

Mr* Justice Stevens, the policies that

have moved Congress to this are beyond my powers to detail to
you*

But may I say that since 1918 when the prototype of the

net operating loss statute came into our laws, that Congress
has, ever since then, provided a different method of calculating
the loss in the same year than it has in the carry year*
They have put a certain threshold on taxpayers which taxpayers
must meet in order to have a net operating loss»

But, once

23
they pass that threshold, then Congress lias always provided
other tests in the carry years to see how much of it would be
absorbed „
The policy implications of that I cannot explain®
QUESTION;

Doesn't it come down, then, to what we

really think the words Congress used mean?

Isn't that our

task, to just read the language as carefully as we can?
MR. BAKER;

Yes,

And that is, of course, the tas.k

of the Court in this ease*
What is the taxable income of each of the prior
taxable years to which such loss may be carried?
The Tax Court found that to which such loss may be
carried results in a favorable result to the taxpayer here,
because it said it modifies taxable income, the taxable income
to which it may be carried*
♦

And, in that case ~~ in our case, since the loss had
not been carried against our capital gain, that $33*000 not so
carried i*as available for carryover to another year.
So, of course, it is the interpretation of that
sentence

of the statute, but, may it please the Court, we

would suggest that it is perhaps a little more than an
exercise in merely reading a sentence.

It, perhaps,

requires the Court to examine the consequences of these
interpretations, if It finds the statute at all ambiguous,
to determine, and the consequences may tell the Court some

i

2k

significant things about the possible intent of Congress,
I should like to follow the Governmentes argument,
in describing the Chartier case, which is the one which started
5

this all off in 1969«
It may be noted that the Government had not* for many
years before that* ever taken an administrative position on
this point, but it did take a litigating position in Chartier.
Consequently, the Tax Court was the first court that
got to speak on the problem.

There, as in our case, the tax­

payer had a loss which it carried to a year that had ordinary
income and capital gain in it.

The loss wiped out the ordinary

income but then there was some still left, and in his first
petition the taxpayer said, t:May I take this against the
capital gain in computing the alternative tax?"
said no.

The Tax Court

As I was indicating in my answer to Mr, Justice

Stevens, there is an unqualified direction in the statute to
that effect.
The taxpayer then said, "May I then carry over my
loss to the next year and use it to reduce the ordinary Income
of that year to the extent that there is some'?’
The Government objected, but over that objection the
Tax Court allowed this, saying that the loss statute permitted
this t r e a tment«
Now, the Chartier court is the only court which has
had two petitions before it at the same time which was

25
confronted with both these questions.

It answered the first

one in favor of the Government and the second one for the tax­
payer.

And it is the second one that the Government today

wants overturned by this Court.
QUESTION;

The first one

what, the Weil case
•*rt*->w*r^»y"irwWr*

point?

MR. BAKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

One can;say it is the Weil case all over again, but
one also could say it was the first time that a court said
Weil applies in a carry year; but it is,» in effect , Mr. Justice
otewart, the Weil doctrine.
■a—

We should like the Court to take note of certain
irrationalities which we think are introduced by the Government's
position.
The Government has to admit, notwithstanding its
argument against cumulating benefits, the Government has to
admit that in many cases a taxpayer may use his net operating
loss fully and also have the favorable rate on the capital
gains.
What they claim is that in a few cases where the
capital gain comes early in the prescribed eight year period,
the absorption without tax benefit may take place.

But they

have to admit that if the.capital gain comes a little later in
thla prescribed eight-year period, giving enough time for

26
ordinary income to accumulate in the first year or two.
loss will be applied against that ordinary income,

the

favorable

rate will be available on capital gains,,
So, it is really a matter of accident within the
prescribed period, under the Governmentis position, they would
treat the Foster class of taxpayers in a fluctuating fashion*
dome would have all of their loss allowed, some part of it,
some get none of their loss allowed.
What this means to someone like Respondent Foster
Lumber Company is that, according to the Government, Poster
Lumber must waste $35.'000 of its net operating loss because its
capital gain occurred in the first of the possible years.
Whereas, its competitors across the street, identical in every
way to Poster Lumber Company, can get the net operating loss
and get the favorable rate on its taxable gain if only one
thing is dixferent,and that is that the loss occurred in the
second of the possible — that the, excuse me —» that the
capital gain occurred in the second or later of the possible
yea rs,
QUESTION:

All that means is that the losses

.

you can carry back the loss and deduct it against ordinary
income,

QUESTION:
against.

That would not be true in this —
So they are not being discriminated

It is just that people who have — just can't deduct

It from capital gains.
MR, BAKER:

Just as the case is in the same year.
With respect,, Mr. Justice White, I think

there are cases where it cannot be deducted and I would suggest
this to you: that if in the first year there is only capital
gain taxed at the alternative tax rate, and in the next year,
then, there is ordinary income, the loss carries back,- is
absorbed with that tax benefit, and, under the Government's
position, cannot be used in the second year.
QUESTION:

Because it has been fully absorbed in the

first, in the Government's position.
MR. BAKER:
QUESTION:

Yes, under their position.
Because there is taxable Income that has

been taxed at capital gains rates.
MR. BAKER:

They say that absorbs the loss, and our

position is that it doesn't,
QUESTION: Let me see if I have this straight.

Your

position is that the irrationality of the Government's posture
is that for one purpose they take capital gains into account

23
and for the other they do not*
MR® BAKER:
Mr® Justice

That would he one way of putting it,

Blackmun.

QUESTION:

This reminds me of a badly drawn will.

One could make arguments either way and there is illlogic on
each side of the case,
MR® BAKER:

That certainly is a way of putting it,

Mr® Justice Blackmun*
QUESTION:

This is precisely the same irrationality

as the distinction between the same year and the different year
situation.

One could give a hypothetical example showing that

that's equally illogical, and it does seem awfully illogical,
I have to admit®
MR® BAKER:

I quite agree, Mr. Justice Stevens, that

the same year situation is also illogical, but taxpayers have
no argument there, under the Code, because the language is
clear®
QUESTION:

But if you are arguing policy and what

seems arbitrary, and all, you could make precisely as strong
an argument.
MR* BAKER:

You could, indeed, Mr. Justice Stevens,

and it is something that some day, when Congress has time to
think about ^things like that, that perhaps it will take care of.
t
It might be of assistance, in the point we are making,
and if there is any question in the Court's mind about the

29
discrimination between taxpayers of the Foster class, to refer
the Court again to the table oh page 25 of our brief,

This

tells what happens to the taxpayers in a way that exposition can
hardly do.

It gives a general overview of the full nine-year

period involved, not with numbers but with a plain statement
of what happens to a net operating loss when it encounters a
capital gain in any one of the eight carry years.

It states

the Government position and our position for each year.
An examination of that table will show that the
Government's position gives eight different results in the
carry years, depending upon the timing of the capital gain»
Whereas, our position gives a consistent result in all eight
carry years, regardless of the year in which the capital gains
falls«
We have included this table for the reason that if
this Court discerns that one Interpretation of the statute gives
a crazy-quilt pattern to taxpayers in this situation and
another interpretation gives rise to a rational pattern, we
think the Court will no doubt consider those results in
selecting between the two interpretations.
QUESTION: uo you think that contributes to the
predictability of the thing ~~ situation?
MR. BAKER:

A Judgment for us would certainly con­

tribute to the predictability of the situation, yes, Mr* Chief
Justice

30

QUESTION:
MR, BAKER:

And you. have a consistent pattern,
The Government filed a reply brief just

before the hearing last year.

We have filed nothing in writing,

as was brought out in the question by Mr, Justice Stewart., with
the Court since that time,
I should, therefore, like to comment briefly on
certain points —» on the points made in that reply brief.
First, the Government there says, as it has said
again today, that the statute is clear and that policy and
consequences should play little, if any, part.
Now, on this question of whether the Government's
reading of the statute is plain and clear, as it insists, we
think reference should be made to the period curing which it
has been litigating the question and the results it has
obtained *
Perhaps, I am repeating here, but 1 think it is
worthy of emphasis,that which was brought out on a question by
the Court*

The Government took its first position in Chartier

and lost in 1969*
And, as the Government counsel indicated, it fought
for five years in the courts of this country to get a conflicting
decision.

And for five years, the courts continued to rule,

without a dissenting vote, that the language was either in
favor of the taxpayer or was at least ambiguous.
all ruled for the taxpayer.

And they

31
Not until the Mutual Assurance case was handed down
by the Fourth Circuit by a two to one vote* did it obtain the
conflicting decision that enabled the ease to be brought here*
In view of that history, it's a little hard to
accept the Government's assertion that the reading of this
statute is that plain and clear*
It seems to us that it is more fair to say that we
are in an area of genuine dispute and we can look not only at
the Tax Court for a serious opinion* but also at the opinion
of the Court below, the Eighth Circuit.

And the Eighth Circuit

found both readings of the statute to be equally plausible,
but it selected the one that favored the taxpayer because it
said it was supported by the basic policy considerations under­
lying Sections 1201 and 172.
We think the Court should realise that during the
many years that the Government says this question has been
open, the Government never, before Chartler, took a public
position on it.
The examples in its regulations carefully avoid the
problem.

The regulations are in effect in the language of

the statute which doesn't advance the inquiry very much.
The examples might have helped, but there is no example in the
regulation which helps resolve this issue.
The IRS never published a ruling on this point.

In

other words, it never communicated to Congress or to the public

32
any intimation of a view that losses could be absorbed-by
taxed capital gains.
Perhaps, this is why Congress has never seen fit to
clarify what now is a matter of controversy before this Court,
I should like to reply now to the Government's
assertion that the taxpayer would not have prevailed under the
provisions of the 1939 Code,

QUESTION;

Prior to Char tier., in 19)69 s I think you

said the Government had not undertaken any interpretation of
this language in any official way.
enforced?

How was the tax law

Prior to f69; would Foster Lumber Company have been

permitted by the practice of the IRS to have carried the loss
back as you now propose to do?

If I knew the answer to that., Mr, Justice

MR, BAKER;

Powell., I would gladly give it to you,
practice was variable,

I imagine that the

I do not think the Government can state

with any confidence that the practice was uniformly its way.
For example* prior to 1954* or as you corrected me*
perhaps 1956* the date of the hell decision, it may not have
even been clear to taxpayers that they couldn't deduct it from
their capital gain*

So they may have been taking it there

until the Weil decision,
QUESTION;

MR, BAKER;

In the same year,
In the same year.* until that came about.

Beyond the'Weil decision, I don't know what taxpayers
V

OOICSMBMnWMt»

«

were doing*

I think it is normal practice for-accountants and

tax advisers of corporations to advice their corporations
where there is doubt about a matter to take — to report it
favorably to themselves*
The Government did say* with respect to the *39 Cade*
that had a similar situation arisen under that Code, the
taxpayer would have lost, that in 195^ when the Code section
was rewritten the addition of the words "to which such loss may
be carried11

-»>- they admit they were added at that time, but

they say they are of no significance because the Committee
reports didn't bring out what the addition of these words
was .intended to do,
We don't see any basis, as I have indicated in my
answer to the last question, we don't see any basis for the
Government's assertion that the taxpayer would not have pre­
vailed under the '39 Code,
effect*

There is no decided case to that

There is no ruling to that effect,

The same policy

factors were acting then as now and there is a case in the
amicus brief of the North River Insurance Company, Merrill v,
the United States, which shows how the term "net income," the
term used instead of "taxable income" in the '39 Code, could
have been construed so as to avoid the unnecessary wasting of
a loss,
And when the Government asserts, that the addition in
2,954 of the very words "relied on the Tax Court* are o.l no

34
significance because the Go;u..iittee reports i.idn ! t say anything
about it* we feel that hardly needs a reply*

Surely silence

in the Committee reports can't properly be used to advance that
argument#
We have analyzed the 554 rewrite and we've put the
Committee reports side by side with them and we find at least
two conspicuous changes made in Section 172, other than this
one, which were not commented upon in the Committee reports*
So 1 don't think the Government should attempt to
make too much out of a decision toy a Congressional Committee
to comment only upon those changes which they deem of general
importance to large classes of taxpayers*
But there is one aspect of the Congressional history
of the net operating loss provision which we would like to
remind the Court of.
During the early New Deal years, there was no net
operating loss provision*

The Government needed the revenue

too badly to have one*
QUESTION:

Could 1 stop you for a minute to be sure

1 follow this one argument?

I am not sure Ido*

You say the law —• the result under the 1939 Code is
not clear*

They say they clearly would have gone for the

Government and you say there are no decisions*

Do you not rely

on the words "to which such loss may be carried" to support
your position?

And is it not correct that they were not a part

35
of the 3.939 statute? Therefore, doesn’t it follow that you
wouldn’t have had an argument under the language of the *39
statute?
MR, BAKER:

That is one way of putting it, Your Honor*

In that case, I would have retreated to the arguments
of the Merrill case, the case X cited, and argue the policy
factors in the construction of the word

"net income" as it

appeared in the '39 Code*
QUESTION:
MR* BAKER:

I see*

Thank you*

The Revenue Act of 1939 introduced the

modern net operating loss provision and It allowed two years
in which you could carry your loss*

If you couldn't get your

loss absorbed in those two years, it was gone forever*
Since then, they have been expanding this period*
We think that has significance*

There is only one reason why

you expand the period for using losses and that's so you can
use them, so they won't die and be wasted * I
In 1942, they expanded the period :o four years*
1950, they expanded the period to six years*
years*

In

in '54 to seven

In '58 to eight years* And yesterday, when the

President signed the Tax Bill, they had, by the 1976 Eaw,
expanded it to ten years for the carryover of a net operating
loss *
We say this record exhibits a great arid increasing
concern by Congress that net operating losses oe ussd and not

36

wasted *
I would turn now to a point which can strongly affect
one's view of the merits of this case*
In our brief, we showed that under the Government's
position, Poster would be taxed on $396.-000 over the threeyear period*

Whereas, everyone agrees that the aggregate

taxable income for the period is $361,000*
The Government, in Its reply brief, says we are
wrong about this, that Poster was not taxed or more than
$361,000*

The dispute traces to one computation.

The alterna­

tive tax in 1966 was 25$ of the capital gain of $167,000»

It

is agreed that ordinary Income was erased by the less carry­
back, leaving only 25# capital gains tax to be paid*
If you multiply $167,000 by 25%, you get the tax
of $41,000 which we paid,

So we say that $167,000 of capital

gains has been taxed»
The Government reply brief says otherwise.

It says

computing the tax on $132,000 of taxable income by the alterna­
tive method produced the tax of $41,000»
Is that true?

It doesn't sound right*

You take 25$ of $132,000 and by ordinary arithmetic
that yields a tax of in the neighborhood of $33,000,

So the

$41,000,which we paid, is the 25# tax on $167",000 capital gain,
as we argued.

37
To
so*

say

that it is £ tax on $132,000 is plainly not

And the Government brief does not show any explanation,

metaphysical or otherwise, to account for the inaccuracy.
So, we submit again, as we did in our basic brief,
that Poster has been taxed on $167,000 of capital gain in 1966,
And if itfe must waste our loss, as the Government contends,
we will be taxed on $396,000 over the three-year period.
In the end, the Government's attempt to force a
wasting of loss in our circumstances is based, more than any­
thing else, on its often repeated Insistence regarding the
meaning of the word “carried" as it appears in the sentence of
the statute.
If any court is qualified by close contact with the
Internal Revenue Code to pass upon the meaning of the word
"carried" that should be the Tax. Court,

We have mentioned

throughout this argument its pioneer decision in the Chartier
case in 1969»

The Tax Court has adhered to its reading of the

word "carried" In subsequent decisions,
As recently as 197in the Continental Equity case,
It declined the Government’s request to reconsider Chart ier
and said, "We remain convinced of the soundness of Chartier
and following in this case,"
