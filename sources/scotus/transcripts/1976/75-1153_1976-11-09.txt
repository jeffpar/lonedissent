MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

W© will hear arguments

next in 75-1153, Ahood v. Detroit Board of Education.
Mr. Petro,, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SYLVESTER PETRO„ ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. PETRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas® the

Court:
I represent the appellant dissident school teachers
in Detroit who have declined willingly to pay dues to the
appellee union.
The appellee Board of Education of Detroit,

empowered

by the Michigan Public Employment Relations Act, had agreed
with the appellee Federation of Teachers — I will call it the
union henceforth — to discharge the appellant teachers if they
refused to pay agency fees to the 'union.
In other words, what we have her© is what is known as

an agency shop contract, a contract which makes the payment of
fees normally equivalent to union dues a condition of employ­
ment.

The extraordinary aspect of this case, of course, is

that this condition of employment is a condition not of private:*,
employment but of public employment, of employment by a sub­
division of the State of Michigan.
The teachers brought suit in the Michigan courts,
contending that the Board’s continuing threat of discharges if

4
they failed to pay dues to the union constituted an outright
per se indefensible violation of their rights under the First
and Fourteenth Amendments <.

They went further and alleged that

the Michigan statute empowering the Board to thus condition
employment was constitutionally overboard as well.
The case is hare because the highest Michigan court
to pass on the issue, the Supreme Court of Michigan, having
denied an appeal — while indeed it handed down a decision
which is not vary easy to stata clearly, nevertheless seemed
to have dismissed out of hand, no question whatsoever sibout it,
those aspects of the complaint, which alleged par sa an indefen­
sible unconstitutionality.
"

In what may be the one clean-cut holding of the case,
the Michigan Court of Appeals did say that the Michigan PERA»,
section 10, authorizing the agency shop, was overbroad insofar
/

as it had to be construed, according to the Michigan Court of
Appeals, as authorizing the appellee union to use the agency
fees, let us say, in any way the union saw fit subject, of

/
I

course, to its own constitution and by-laws.
There is language in the opinion of the Michigan Court
of Appeals to 'the affect that it is well recognised that the
union in this case engages in political action.

The statute

does not confine the union8s use of the exacted agency fees to
only those things which we may call collective bargaining but
permits the us© of the fees for the kinds of political conduct

5
ia which the union normally engages.
Now, while holding that, the statute did permit the
union to use the agency fees for purposes other than coll@ct.ivis
bargaining, including political purposes, the truth of th®
matter is that th© court did not say that the statute was in
consequence thereof unconstitutionally over-broad.

It is vir­

tually impossible to avoid drawing th© inference that if, say,
wa had been able to skewer the court to the wall and fore© it
to make a comment on,® way or the other on this issue, it would
have said, y@s, the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad.
As a great judge once said in another case, the
opinion is instinct with that kind of commitment from the
Michigan Court of Appeals.
Still, in the fac© of this broad suggestion of uncon­
stitutional over breadth, the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed,
the dismissal of the teachers' petition for injunctive relief,
affirmed th© dismissal of the teachers' case completely, for
that matter *
t

Its idea seemed to be that if somehow th© teachers
vaurgsd to get it to commit itself on the unconstitutionality
of the statute, they should proceed by an action of one kind or
another thereafter to recover frexn th© union th© monies previ­
ously exacted and used by th© union unconstitutionally.
QUESTION;

Well, it said in so many words that the

teachers would have such an action, didn't they?

MR. PETRO:
Justice Relinquish.

I don't think you can say that, Mr,
What it said is that the statuta could

violate the teachers' rights.
QUESTION?

Well, if the union — I thought it said if

felis union chose to spend monies that it had collected for po­
litical activities, the Court of Appeals described political
activity, then an action would 11© in th® Michigan courts
against th® union to r a cover.
MR. PSTROs

What makes the case

bo

extraordinarily

difficult to deal with, when the court says not, that this
statute is unconstitutionally overbroad, but says instead the
statute could violate tha teachers' rights, all it has given us
is another law suit, you know.
QUESTION;

Well, it thought that th© giving of

another law suit was a sufficient curs of the overbreadth, if
there was»51 any, I take it.
MR. PETRO:

Well, we would have to win on th© over-

breadth argument all over again.
QUESTION:
MR. PETRO;
QUESTION:

I wouldn't this* so.
Well —
I mean, you are talking mostly just about

nomenclature rather than about th© actual issues, I think.
MR. PSTRO:

Well, our problem is that we were dis­

missed and wa think that we were dismissed in spite of tha fad:
that w® had what th© Michigan Court .of Appeals very largely

7
implied was & good constitutional claim.
New, if you are correct, Justice Rehnquisc, in sug­
gesting that w@ won on that point, than of course fch© denial of
relief is inexplicable and plainly incompatible with ©varything
this Court has had to say about violations of First Amendment
rights.
QUESTION;

Wall, isn't the denial based upon the

statement of the court that your clients mad© no allegation
that any of them, specifically protested the expenditure of
their funds for political purposes to which they objected?
MR. PETRO;

Well, that is what it is based on, but

this is not — there is no way to ground this holding in the
decisions of this Court.
QUESTION;

It s&ys therefore the plaintiffs &r© not

entitled to relief on this basis.
MR. PETRO;

This — the Michigan Court of Appeals

demanded of our clients a kind of conduct preparatory to action,
that has not been required in any First Amendment case that I
have ever encountered, and I believe that I have tried to read
them all.
QUESTION;

But you war© attacking a brand new statute,

weren't you, where nothing had ever been exacted?
MR. PETRO;

Well, there ar® all sorts of people paying

agency fs®3 under that statute.

It is only our clients who had

refused for a good long while to pay tha agency fees.

Still

8
sori©

have refused but others under protest have, because of

the continued throats fraa the Detroit Board of Education to
discharge than, they have now baas?, paying agency fees.
matter of fact, the

As a

other side makes a great deal of this,

acting as though our clients have disqualified th@ms©lv®s from
this suit because they have paid th® fees under protest.
Now, it is perfectly understandable that they should
do so.

Many of them have been Detroit school teachers for a

good long while and they are not about to give up their jobs,
©van though maybe thsy will get reinstatement at some future,
time.

But they have preserved their rights.

have been under protest.

that whatever th® union uses the money for, they may not collect

this stand is mad®, an a fortiori one, because it is incon­

MR. PETRO:
QUESTION:

Wall, the answer is yes.
Yss?
It was an emphatic yes.
Now, let's assume w® disagree with you on

that, your point is that at least they cannot collect if they
are going to' us a it for political purposes?
MR. PETRO:

Well, ac I see things, Justice White, to

see that would not. be any concession on my part because every­
thing that they do is political.
QUESTION:

Wall, I understand, but what if we dis­

agree with you on that?
MR, PETRO?
QUESTION:

Well, that is something —
Suppose they are using part of the money

for medical benefits or legal benefits or some kind of service
to their members and we have just disagreed with you that it is*
political?

Your other point is that they ar® using'seme of it

10
for political purposes?
MR. PETROs

Wall» the essential function of a union

is to engage in these negotiations of on® kind or another with
their opposite nuvsbers.

New, it is true, I suppose I should

certainly have to withdraw the suggestion that there is no con­
ceivable way in which the unions could spend money nonpolitically.

Dave Beck for the Teamsters used to spend Teamster

money on trips to Europe, ©id I would be hard put to establish
this as a political expenditur©.

MR. PETRO;

Welly that is true, qualification

MR. PETROs

Well, is that bad?
I am ready now to concede that all the

activities other than those that the union refers to as
collective bargaining may putatively b© non-political in
character.

11
after instance to determine.

But m far as those activities

Do you think bargaining for a contract?

MR. PETRO;
QUESTION;
MR. PETRO;

Yes, I —
•— bargaining with a public bodyj
That is correct, and I think that this

Court’s decision last, terra in the National League of cities
case puts this preposition beyond any further doubt.

And if it

is true, as was held in the National League of Cities case,
that the determination and the administration ©f a state or
locality's employment practices is a fundamental aspect of the
state's sovereignty, and sovereignty is, of course, the
political principle par excellence.

Then public sector collec­

tive bargaining which is explicitly designed to influence and
affect, rearrange and displace the sovereign decisions of
statas and localities in respect of their employment, must of
necessity also be political in character.
QUESTION;

Well, suppose — here the Michigan legis­

lature, which presumably exercises its sovereign power in
Michigan, along with the Governor, has passed a statute saying
there shall b© public sector collective bargaining?
MR. PETRO:

Yes indeed, and I suppose the Michigan

legislature has not for the first time engaged in a

12
const!tutioaally dubious piece of conduct.
QUESTION:

But do you say that violatas the National

League of Cities principle?
MR. PETRO:

who raised the question of whether the State of Michigan in

that I have suggested is that in passing PERA section

13
10, authorising the agency shop, the Michigan legislature was
in trouble with the national laagu® of cities case, as well as
with a number of other decisions handed down last term, most
notably Elrod v. Burns,

I think Elrod v. Burns is a case

which is virtually indistinguishable from this on®.
May I proceed, Mr. Chief Justice?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
two left.

You have only a minute or,

You are into your rebuttal time now, if you wish to

save any.
MR. RETRO:

My instincts do not permit me to end this

abruptly, so 1 must, point out that there are sane faturos about
this casa that need emphasis and need emphasis in connection
with the discussion that w© have just been having.

I shall go

over them very rapidly because I do wish to save ten minutes
for rebuttal.
Now, the first and I believe th® most profound
element, in this case lies in the distinction between the
activities of government and the activities of private persons
Government is on® tiling and private persons and their activity
are strictly another.
Thor® is a great deal mad© by tee other side of th©
fact that collective bargaining, while collective baraining in
the private sector is th© same thing as collective bargaining
in the public sector.

I believe teat this lacks as much dis~

comment as would be lacked by a person who said that all th©

14
Fords that roll off ths Ford assembly line are the same, it
doesn’t matter that one is drives by Sylvester Petro, a private
person, and th© other is driven by a policeman and is owned by
a polio© fare©.

They look alike but thsy ®r© different.

The same thing is true, say, of the jet engines that
are produced in such numbers.

Some g© into passenger commerciali

flights and others go into B-l bombers or B~52*s.

Vou taka that

same engine, take it out of a passenger plans and put it into a
bomber and you*v© got a different animal.
In the same way, that activity, collective bargaining’,
which looks as though it is exactly the same in the public
sector as it is in the private sector, is a different animal
entirely.

It is an animal that participates ©f the political

character, of tha government that constitutes the employer.
And whan that collective bargaining thus becomes political in
character, to ask or to insist that a public employe©, against
his will, finance it, it is tha same as forcing upon that
public school teacher political and ideological objectives
which quite obviously cannot b© sq&ured with ths First Amend­
ment of ths Constitution of -ths United States, a clear comprom­
ise ©f tha dissident teachers’ political, associations! and
speech rights is present in a case of this kind.
Thank you, and I will

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE SACHS, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF 05' THE APPELLEES
MR. SACHS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

•;

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
i
Perhaps in the remaining few minutes before the recasis

:

\

it would b© profitable to indicate what this case does not involve.

Clearly, I would suggest on the state of the record and

as the caoo comes before the Court, there is not a political
expenditures issue.
Dealing with the question that Mr. Justice Rehnquiat
asked, the lower court in fact decided favorably to the con­
tention of appellants as to the use of agency shop monies for
political purposes and mad© clear that war® such monies to be

16
expended over their objections, they would indeed have a cause
of action.
Th® complaint was dismissed in the instant case be­
cause in fact they had never mad® any appropriate protest or in
any timely fashion.

It should ha recalled, if the Court

pleas®, that this complaint, that is the initial complaint in
Warczak, of which Abood is virtually a carbon, was filed prior
to the effective data of the Act, and that circumstance was
virtually identical to the Hanson case, notwithstanding which
the plaintiffs alleged, although not on® penny had been col­
lected from anyone, nor of course therefore had on© penny been
expended, that the union was s cm show using the money for
political purposes • vir specif isd as to'which the plaintiffs ob­
jected, and they sought on that account not some remedy discreet'
and referable to expenditures or alleged expenditures of a
political nature, but they sought, aa in Hanson, to avoid the
obligation of the agency shop clause entirely.

They sought no

relief whatsoever as to the claimed expenditures, and they did
not itemize or specify any specific complaint, if 'any, which
they had.
They iacanted a phrasing which presumably was intended
to invoke a rsicady which would set aside th® clause entirely.
Moreover, during the entire pendency of the litigation, they
have be©n excused from enforcement ©£ the clausa, there has

bmn no

discharge of any plaintiff-appellant, there has been

17

no other enforcement.
The fact, of th© matter is then -Shat th® lower court,
after first saying that th® statute did not admit, as this
Court had interpreted th© Railway Labor Act to admit, of th©
possibility of expenditure or non-expenditure over objections

of dissenters, and after saying that could present a constitu­
tional dilemma, avoided the problem antirely by then agreeing
with the contention of th© plaintiffs and saying, yes, were
that to happen, there would indeed ha a remedy.

We did not

cross-appeal on that ruling, that is th© fashion in which the
matter comes before th© Court*
In addition, as xm have pointed out in our brief, th©
union, complying with —
QUESTIONs
MR, SACHSs
QUESTION:

Mr* Sachs, under -Yes?
— your understanding of the Court of

Appeals ruling, would a particular member of th® plaintiff
group have to object to particular expenditures or could ha be
— would it be sufficient for him generally to object to the
expenditure of any money for snv political purpose?
i

MR* SACHS:

Mr, Justice Stevens, I think under the

holding of the Court there would have to bs a specific objec­
tion, just as this Court stated in th© Lathrop ease, in the
context of constitutional adjudication, such a requirement
would bs necessary.

At least it was necessary in th© context

18
of the complaint there*

But I would respectfully suggest that

that is academic now, because the union has adopted the
remedial process which was recommendad by this Court in feh©
Allen case, as a means ©£ facilitating ready restitution of
the proportional payments insofar as they might b© applied for
political purposes.
QUESTIONS

What happens to the union member who

doesn’t particulars want t© disclose his disagreement with
particular union policies or political policies advocated by
the union but just doesn’t want his money spent for any par­
ticular purpose?

is he out of luck entirely?

MR. SACHS:

No, Your Honor: *

Under the internal

roairdy he ns,©d not disclose anything specific.

w@ go on

beyond what the appellata decision reported.
QUESTIONs

Can he then, to go back to my first ques­

tion, can he thsn simply say I don't want you spending my money
t

for any political purpose?
MR. SACHS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, he can.
And what, happens then?

Does ha get all

his money back or —
MR. SACKS:

No, ha would get, in accordance with the

remedy of this Court, and as provided by —
QUESTION:

case yet,

MR. SACKSs

How is that to be computed?
Thor© is a relationship to total ex­

penditures »
QUESTION 2
MR. SACHS %

How ar© you going to compute that?
We ar© going to compute it in th© best of

good faith and in accordance with fcha suggestion of th® Allen
case*, Your Honor, and as —
QUESTIONS
fcha dues is $30.

Just toll me in dollars and conte.

Say

How much does he get back if he says I don’t

want you spending the money for political purposes?

MR. SACHS:
QUESTION:

well, Your Honor, that would involve a
Say 40 percent of your budget is political

would h® gat 40 percent back?

MR. SACHS:

On Your Honor’s hypothetical, if it ware

40 percent, share would b© a 40 percent refund.
QUESTION:
MR. SACHSs

That is th® formula?
Yes, sir.

Obviously, it involves a deter

mi.nation and as th® procedure is set out in the appendix, there
is a procedure for determination, there is disinterested
review, and there is an opportunity to make precisely those
formulations, and there was a deliberate intent to make the
r%rasdy as expansive and as generous as possible so there would
not be problems of this sort.

*

20
And so th® fact is than,

I think I can fairly state

to the Court , as the matter cones before you , it does not in­
volve political issues in th© sons® that th® Court,-dealt with
them in Street or dealt with thara in Allan.

What it seams to

me is presented by this car;®, and th.® only appropriate question
presented by th© case, is whether th® rulings of this Court,
which seams to ms are quite clear, in Hanson, street and Allen
and L&throp, are equally applicable or ar© no less applicable
in the instance of a public employer with respect to its own
employees,

dh® csss does not involve, contrary to th® sugges­

tions of appellants, coercion of membership of any kind.
is not the nature of th© obligation,

That

it does not involve

coerced support of any views or positions of the union.

It

dots not involve ideological conformity in any fashion.

It

doss not involve suppression of dissent.

It doss not involve

censorship of any dissidents or dissenter's views.

Nona of

those matters ar© involves and, as I have already indicated,
it does not involve, under th© posture of th© case, any
political expenditures question.
QUESTIONS

I submit; —

It does involve, however, compulsory finan­

cial tribute to th® union, does it not?
MR. SACHS;
QUESTION:

It involvas compulsory -Imposed by the state as a condition ©£

government employment?
MR. SACHS:

I would respectfully differ with the term

21
’’tribute.”

Hier® is compulsory obligation of financial support,

Your Honor,
QUESTION

Well, isn’t that the dictionary moaning of

the word "tribute”?
MR. SACHS?

Wall, sometimes it has

a

pejorative sense

and I would think that inappropriate in this context. Your
Honor.

Th ar a is no question but that titer® is an obligation of

financial support.

AFTERNOON SESSION - I; GO Q1 CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Sachs, you may

continue*
MR. SACHS:

Thank you, Year Honor, and may it pleas®

the Courts
Appalla®s would suggest that an appropriate ©valua­
tion of the central issue which is tenure involves necessarily
a consideration of tha general Michigan Labor Cede which is
involved ht-r©.
Michigan, like many other states, an extraordinary
number, has adopted a comprehensive labor relations cod® which
in contrai and significant aspects parallels the National
Labor Relations Act.

And there are- numerous of our own State

Supreme Court which have indicated as much and have indicated
that teachings of tha federal act and indeed this Court's
interpretations of that act are persuasive in terms of deter­

mining the significance and system of tha state, act.
Part of that system includes not only the disciplinA.

try measures and procedures which ware before this Court in the
last, term in -the Cre.stwood case, involving antistrike provisions,,
but involve affirmative features dealing with a process of

collective bargaining, and in that respect the Michigan statute,
like the federal, like the National Labor Relations Act, pro­
visis that ! where» employssa in an appropriate bargaining unit
have by democratic vote ©fa majority of them selected a

23
representative,

TI*o public employer, basically in -the local

sector, has a responsibility to bargain, in good faith with
respect to wage, hours and conditions ©£ employment.

The ele­

ments of those concepts are, of course, entirely familiar to
this Court, and they are essentially of th© same meaning in
the state court.
An aspect which is critical to an understanding of
the state system in dealing with the issues in this case is
the proposition that th© representative chosen under the
Michigan scheme is th® exclusive representative, the exclusive
representative based upon majority rule.

As such, as this

Court has said several times, the organization is not a
"private organization," it is an organization which is clothed
with certain legislative authority in the context of what is
involved her a, as stated in Steele and Tunst&ll, it is an ©rgastiration which has the authority -to create and distinguish cer­
tain rights for the bargaining unit generally.
QUESTION?

Am I mistaken in my recollection that th©

federal labor legislation excludes governmental employers?
MR. SACHS:
QUESTION:

No, you are quit© correct, Your Honor,
Does th® lagislative history of that

legislation show why?
MR* SACHS?

I don't believe so, Your Honor, and I

recally cannot answer th® Court's question.
QUESTION?

But it dess clearly exclude them?

24
MR. SACHS %

Yesi sir.

Yes, sir.

And that» of

course, I think is ccmplimentary to leaving such matters to
the state», presumably at, least that was the essential congressional intent.
QUESTION;

Wall, it excludes any kind of federal

government employees also, didn’t it?
MR, SACHS:

That is correct.

And of course the

federal governmental employees have in substantial measure
bean covered by various executive orders which provided similar
kind of bar

og, though not precisely the same as is in­

volved here*
The corollary, it seems to me, which is critical to

again the

under standing of what is essentially here to the

proposition of exclusive representation is that there is a duty

of fair represantation on the part of the exclusive bargaining
representative to all members of the bargaining unit.

It is

perhaps not by accident that in appellants! entire brief there
is not an acknowledgement of the concept of the duty of fair
representation or a citation of Vaca or Humphrey or Hines or
any of the cases which this Court — in which this Court has
enunciated those familiar doctrines,
QUESTION:
MR. SACHS:

Are those cases applicable her©?
They ar© by borrowing by the state courts',

the Michigan court
QUESTION:

But not directly?

25
MR. SACHSi
QUESTION:

Not directly, no, Your Honor.
Has the Supreme Court of Michigan aver

adopted that rule?
MR. SACHS:

Yas , Your Honor, in a eas® called Lowe v»

Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union, has essentially adopted
the authorities expressed by this Court, and indeed in a more
recent case by the State Court of Appeals called Handwork, the
\

court has said that the requirements of the state statute maybe
perhaps are more strict than those imposed by this Court and
allow less discretion perhaps in terms of the bargaining
agent’s authority to discontinue a grievance short of arbitra­
tion than this Court might permit*
in any ©vent, the significance is that there is a
very serious burden and a very .serious responsibility imposed
upon the bargaining agent to represent all, including the
plaintiffs in this case.
There? has been no challenge in this complaint or in
this argument by appellants, and incised there is a disclaimer
to the concept of exclusive representation, and so that is not
an issue befora the Court.

And therefore I would suggest that

an appropriate corollary of the authority of the bargaining
agent, indeed this Court has said virtually there is such a
corollary on'the part of the bargaining agent to speak for all,
is to represent all fairly, and therefore that moans that
those who, whatever their exposition her©, challenge the

26
procedure, of the statute, nevertheless have called upon the
services of ths organisation which is required fairly and
without any discrimination to render services and no claim has
been mad® «~

QUESTION?

And what doas it include within the terms

of political?
MR. SACHSs

The terra, Your Honor, I think is broadly

defined to refer to political issue and ideological issues of
a controversial nature that are only incidentally related to
collectiva bargaining.

But does it generally ~ does everything

MR. SACHSs

Your Honor, there hasn't been an applica­

tior. yet, there hasn’t been any instance for its explication.
This would come at th® conclusion of the calendar year.

The

intent* certainly from the language, is to be expansive * as I
stated earlier, in auBwar to Mr, Justice Stevens' question, to

At least that is your understanding?
Yes, sir, that is my understanding.
What about those non-political expenditures

that are also non-bonericia1 to the appellants, I would think
social expenditures or conventions, publication expenditures,
travel expense and, if you will, organisation elsewhere?
MR. SACHS:

Your Honor, those matters ar© really not

felt it appropriate in Street and in Lathrop to indicate that
there ought, to foa appropriate record to determine where the
appropriate line is to be drawn, so it ought to ba here.

QUESTIONs

Well, jurisdictional in the standing

sense* as I understood it.
MR. SACHS;

Perhaps, Your Honor, that th© point —

again, none of the parties have addressed it and the court has
not addressed it as such.

What th© decision in this respect

of the lower court was that the statute did not have retro­
spective application.

After the conclusion of this litigation,

presumably he would be.
QUESTION:

Let's suppose this statute had never been

passed.
MR. SACHS:
QUESTION:
MR, SACKS:

Yas, sir.
Would he have been fired?
I don't know, because in light of the

prior adjudication, Your Honor, the state court# the state
Supreme Court has held that there was not an appropriate
statutory basis for the establishment of an agency shop clause,
therefore presumably there would not have been one and therefor©

33
there would not haves been a firing.

cede in view of the holding of the Court of Appeals that felia
statute does not apply?
MR. SACHS:

I concede that the court indicated that

tli© statute —
It held that it did not apply.

QUESTION:
MR, SACHS:
QUESTION:

— did net have retroactive application.
But doesn’t apply to this case.

So you

have no defense on the statute, and there is no statutory ques
tion before ue, isn't that correct?
QUESTION:
one of stato law.

Well, ••ill© statutory question is basically
w® wouldn’t interpret the Michigan statute.

34
Their claim, as I understand your opponents' claim, is that the
compelled deduction of dues violates their First

amendment

rights under the federal Constitution.
MR. SACHS:
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.
Your response is that it doesn't.

The way

it earn© up to the Michigan state courts was that the Michigan
courts said, yes, there was sufficient statutory authorization
for you to do -'chat, and in addition we find there was no con­
stitutional violation.
MR. SACHS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Well, counsel, isn’t it true that the con-

pulsion for the deduction as- to the contract is solely based on
the contract, there is no statutory authorization for the
deduction?
HR. SACHS:

There was no deduction.

In that, respect,

Your Honor, I have to indicate that both parties sought re­
hearing below and then clarification as to what the purpose of
the remand was with respect to the retroactive period, since
there had been no compulsion, since there had been no collection,
we could not understand what the point cf it was, and I to this;
day do not understand what issue remained on that score, but.
it was not framed in the terms that Your Honor is now question­
ing me.
QUESTION:

Let

me

put it this ways

Had there not

been — if the Court of Appeals had said the statute is totally

35
void, it. had never bsen. passed or something like that —
MR. SACHSt
QUESTION:

Yes, Year Honor.
— it was held 'that it doasn’t apply to

this contract, than you would not have been able to compel the
deduction because of an indspandsnt state ground reason, isn’t
that correct?
MR. SACHS:

Yes, entirely independent stats ground

reason.
QUESTIONs

So there really is no federal question

before us is what I am saying, there is no compulsion now for
a deduction as to these particular litigants?
MR. SACKS:

As to that past period, that would be so,

subject to the point that Mr. Justice White has raised and that
we acknowledge fairly, that —
QUESTION:

The part of the claim of the plaintiff,

wasn't, it, in his complaint, was that it was unconstitutional
for the collective bargaining agreement with the state to
compel him to contribute to the union activities?
MR. SAGES:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
I mean it didn’t. — that claim didn’t

depend on -whether there is a statute or not?
MR* SACKS:
QUESTION:

Well
But as to that claim, didn’t the Michigan

court, hold that h© was right, apart from this later statute?
MR. SACHS:

Wall, the court said that the contract

36
and the statute I thiuk wer© essentially aa& issue.

I don't

think th© plaintiffs attempted to disassociate the contract
from th© statute.

Their First Amendment claim was that there

were statutory action involved.
QUESTION;
MR. SACHS;
QUESTION;

But you relied on the statute ■—
Yes, sir.
— and say that th© reason that this is

i

now valid is because there is right to a refund?
MR. SACHS;
QUESTION;

Not the —
Now, whether or not the Michigan statute

was in existence or not, this petitioner's claim was rejected,
and part of his claim was that collecting a fee to support union
activities was unconstitutional?
ill, SACHS;
QUESTION;

That clearly was the claim. Your Honor.
That still is his claim right here, his

I

nurafcar one claim.
QUESTION;

without regard to what use it may be ap­

plied to?
QUESTION;

Statute or not, that is part of his claim

right now, right?
MR. SACHS;
QUESTION;

I presume.that is so, Your Honor.

It is the Detroit School Board that is

making the deduction to bring into play at least the claim of
First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
MR. SACHS;

Tii® fact of the matter is, Mr. Justice

37
Rebaquist, that the Detroit School Board, as th© appellants
before youf is not making a deduction, ther© has been no deduc­
tion because there has been a stay of the enforcement as to all
of these appellants.
QUESTION s

But the fact that something is stayed

pending review here doesn't moot it for th© reason, I take it?
MR. SACHSs

No, I want to be clear, stayed in a con­

tractual sense, not by virtu© ©f any court action.

The contract

itself provided that during th© pendency of litigation there
would not be enforcement and therefore th© plaintiffs have not
bean under any compulsion and they have not, as I sought to
state in ray opening remarks, ever — they have never sought to
challenge the expenditures as such, they sought to address, as
plaintiffs did in Hanson, the collection as such.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sachs, I still don't follow your

colloquy with my Brother White.

Didn't you tell us earlier

that the Michigan Supreme Court said that this very contract
between the school board and this union was invalid for want of
statutory authority?
MR. SACHS:

Your Honor, the Court I think in its

opinion did not distinguish and speak to this contract as such.
QUESTION;

Oh, I thought you referred to soma earlier

opinion of th® -MR. SACHS:

There is an earlier case not involving

these parties, Your Honor.

38

QUESTION:

All right, not involving these partias,

but a contract between a public body and a labor union?
MR. «SACES?
QUESTION s

Yes, Your Honor.
With an agency clausa in it?

MR. .SACHS:
QUESTION;;

Y0S.
And there held that the agency clause was

unenforceable, invalid, and whatever?
Mt» SACHSs
QUESTION:

For purely statutory reasons.
All right, wouldn’t that not apply if this!

statute is not applicable to the particular contract we have
got involved hare, then where is there any First Amendment
issue?
QUESTION:

The petitioner’s claim was overruled or

was rejected by the Michigan Supreme Court, by the Michigan
court, wasn't it?
MR. SACHS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And that included a rejection of his First,

Amendment claim, with or with cut a statuta?
MR. SACHS:

That is correct.

I hop® I have answered

•the court's questions on the point.
QUESTION:

Wall, at least the federal question hare,

doesn't it?
Your Honor, I am not sure.

MR. SACHS:
what time is now left.
QUESTION:

I don't know

May I —

I would think a federal question involved

39
in a casa of — this contract contains un®nfareaable provision
that mast b© as if there never was such a provision, on son©
state law ground.

That doesn’t maef the issue her®.

QUESTION:

Hi® petitioner should have won then, but

ha didn’t, did he?
HR. SACHS:

Your Honor, on that point, the court did

remand with rsspecfc 'to an appropriate remedy as to the retroactivo period.

That is not before this Court.

QUESTION:
MR. SACHS:
QUESTION:

You mean in the appellate court?
Yes, Your Honor.
I -fcake it if couldn’t have overruled the

prior Supreme Court opinion?
MR. SACHS:
to do so.

No, of course not, and it didn’t presume

It was acting not on the basis, Mr. Justice Brennan,

of the earlier opinion, but on ths basis of the intervening
statute enacted I think in 1973 which at that point sanctioned
such agreements as this and did so expressly, so there was no
longer a question of a statutory basis for the action which was
taken.
QUESTION:

Both parties petitioned to the Supreme.

Court of Michigan for review and it was denied?
MR. SACHS:

That is correct.

The appellants pe­

titioned on ths grounds which they would bring here? w© pe­
titioned because wa simply could sot understand the purpose of
the remand since there really was nothing that was not moot,

40
aad sine© there had bean no compulsion xm cm Id not understand
what was viable for purposes of any remand and indeed the
appellants seamed to join with us in that quandary as to what
the purpose of the remand was.

But in any ©vent, that is not

before this Court and has not been presented.
I would simply want to emphasize that it seems that
.in light of the precedents of this Court, on no basis, consider­
ing the parallel pattern of the Michigan statute to that of the
federal statute, there is any genui»,® First Amendment issue of
speech or association involved,

ffe are really back to the —

if th© questions are here, w® are back to those initial ques­
tions, and it s©sms to ra© that the issue is what this Court
characterized in th© last term in the black lung benefits case,
Usery v. Elkhorn, ae a legislative act adjusting the burdens
and benefits of ©conamie life, and that is all that is involved
in this.

And such a statute, it seems to me, comes to this

Court with a presumption of validity, and it is for the plain­
tiffs, not for th© defendants, to justify it.

There are no

First Amendment implications involved.
Thank you, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SYLVESTER PETRO, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL
MR. PETRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Just',ice, and Honorable

41
Associat® Justices:
I think thoroughly without any intention,. Mr. Sachs
has completely misled us all concerning the posture of this
case.

It all goes back to the Smigal decision by the Michigan

Supreme Court? holding that in the absence of an authorising
agency shop provision in the Michigan PERA? no public employer
could as a. matter of statute or a power enter an agency shop
contract.

Clear?
Now? after that decision? the Michigan legislature

proceeded immediately to pass the statute wanting as of the
time of the Smigal decision.

Nov?? observe very carefully?

Honorable Justices? it was after the passage of that enabling
agency shop provision that the contract in issue in this case
was entered by the parties.

If this dess not establish a

federal question? then I don’t know what a federal question is,
The contract involved in this case was entered by
the parties after the passage of the 1973 Michigan PERA section
10.

Now? since i have only three minutes left? let me proceed

immediately to what I
QUESTION;

Hr. Petro? may I just ask? why then in

the Court of Appeals opinion did they discuss the issu© of

MR. PETRO:

This was involved — you ar® going to

whether car not a contract then in existence? a, contract prior

in that cas®, not this on©.
QUESTION:

This is a new ball gam© w@ have.

In other words, th© contract in the

record fosfor© us is different from th® contract in th© record
before th® Court of Appeals —
MR. PETRO;
QUESTION:

That is correct.
— and nevertheless we are reviewing that

decision?
MR. PETRO:

No.

An aspect of th© contract involved

only that as to that period

This Court held

you know, these period were

employees throughout that period, throughout that period in~
volvid in the Sraigal case, throughout th® period involved in
this Afoood-Warczak case.

Now, the question was whether or not

they wsre going to be affected by the Michigan PERA amendment
in 19?3 which

the language of it is relevant here.

Th© Michigan PERA speaks in terms- of reaffirming its
favoring an agency shop.

It is a sort of, if I may say so

without antagonizing th© Court, a kind of a shell game by th©
Michigan legislature, designed to establish retroactively the
validity of th® agency shop PERA passed in 1974.

And the only

thing that this Michigan Court of Appeals, from, which we are
appealing, did with respect to that was say no, there can't
be no retroactive -

MR. PETRO:

Th® fundamental deficiency from the

point of view of the First Amendment in this case is that the

the teachers in order to use those forced loans to promote
political causes to which the teachers must be presumed in view
of thair general objection, th© teachers are opposed to them.
