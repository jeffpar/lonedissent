MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 75-831, Tully against Griffin.
I think you may proceed, Mr» Zolezzi.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS p'. ZOLEZZI, ESQ,
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justices and may it please the Court:
This is an appeal by the president and members of
the New York State Tax Commission and by employees of the
New York State Department of Taxation and Finance.
It is an appeal from an order of judgment of the
United States District Court for the District of Vermont which
aenied the Appellants’ motion to dismiss this action for lack
of subject matter jurisdiction.
The Appellee originally had come before the
District Court in order to enjoin the Appellants from the
enforcement and the execution of various provisions of the
New York State sales tax law.
Since they sought an injunction, a three-judge
court was convened and the three-judge court decided against us.
That is why we are here.
The basic facts leading up to the action are that
the Appellee is a Vermont corporation with its place of
business in Arlington, Vermont, which is located approximately
six miles from the New York border.

4
The Appellee is engaged in the retail sale of
furniture ana in its operations, a large portion of the sales
made are made to non-residents of the State of Vermont and are
made to residents of the State

of New York.

Some of the articles in the store purchased by New
York residents are carried away by the residents.
Other articles are delivered by Griffin to _
purchasers in New York by use of Griffin's own trucks by their
own employees.

These employees would come in and in many cases,

set up the furniture such as attaching legs to tables, et
cetera, and they would also send repairmen in to do various
repair and touch-up work on the furniture.
Griffin also advertises extensively in New York by­
way of newspapers, radio and t.v. and a roadsiae sign.
The New York State Tax Commission, based on the
activities of Griffin within the state, were of the opinion that
there was minimal contact within the state and we sought to
have Griffin collect sales tax for the State of New York on
those articles which are delivered into the state.
We are not seeking to have sales tax collected on
ary articles which are sold to New York residents at Griffin's
store and carried away by the resident from the store.

We are

only after the tax on goods delivered in New York State.
QUESTION: When you say you sought to have that tax
colleetea, you sent one of your auditors, didn't you, to the

5

store in Arlington?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Yes, sir, we sent one of our auditors

to the store based on the fact that we felt that there were
minimal contacts within the state.

When we arrived at the

store, at that time were were presented with the summons and
complaint in Federal District Court.
QUESTION:

What would New York have done if the

Appellee here, Griffin,

had simply told the auditor, in

effect, to get lost?
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

And not filed the lawsuit that he did.

MR. ZOLEZZI:
lost, we

Well --

Had we would have been told to get

would have come home and then, based on external

indices, what we did in this case, really, we went to the
«

Vermont Tax Commission and we obtained figures and facts related
to Griffin's sales and those sales upon which it had not paid
sales ‘tax to Vermont.
We took a percentage of that and applied it to New
York.
Basically, what you are going to say is, was it an
arbitrary figure we applied?
QUESTION:

Yes.

No, what I was going to say was, would

you have brought an action in the New York courts?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Yes.

Then based on these figures that

we obtained from Vermont, what we would do is come back, obtain

6

a judgment in New York and then, under the provisions of
Article 25 of the New York State Tax Law, have gone into Vermont
and sought to enforce out' New York claim in the Vermont courts,
QUESTION:

Well, now, would Griffin have had an

opportunity in the New York proceeding to litigate its claim
that this was an unconstitutional action by the taxing authority?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Oh, yes, in other words, when we went

in to seek a judgment in the New York courts, we would not do it
ex parte.

We would have to serve motion papers and they would be

put on notice that such an action was pending and they could
come in and defend their course.
QUESTION:

Do you mean, some sort of a long-arm

service?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Correct, it would be the long-arm

service under Section 302 of our civil practice law and rules
which, under the theory of doing a transaction of any business
within the state, would permit us to have jurisdiction over any
foreign corporations.
QUESTION:

What would be the situation, on your

view of the case, if sales were made final and the purchaser
had to arrange for the transportation?
MR. ZOLEZZI:
transportation?

If the purchaser arranged for the

In that case, we could not really touch Griffin

because Griffin would be out of state.

There would be no

transactions or no completion of the sale within the State of

7

New York because the entire operation would be completed in
Vermont.

The purchaser would have his own vehicle, et cetera,

pick up the goods and transport them.
QUESTION:

For all practical purposes, you couldn't

really tax those transactions, as a practical matter.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

As a practical matter we could not tax

Griffin but we could try to impose the use tax upon the
purchaser when he brings them in for use within the state.
QUESTION:
matter."

That is what I meant by "practical

Could you really do anything, as a practical matter,

with respect to all of these individual purchasers?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Practically speaking, the answer is no.

We have to rely upon the honesty of our residents.
QUESTION:

Unless they employ the United Parcel

Service to make most of the deliveries.

That is, if all of the

purchasers went to United Parcel you might be able to track
them down that way.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Yes, sir, that that would become one

big administrative bottle.
QUESTION:

That would be almost impossible.

MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Almost impossible,

Am I correct that some place in there

you don *t want that money?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

That we don't want which monev, your

Honor?
QUESTION:

You don't want the money of the person

that went up there and bought it and brought it back himself?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Oh, no, we are not saying we don’t

We are saying, "We are not trying to impose

upon Griffin the obligations of collecting it."
QUESTION:
this case.

Well, I thought that was admitted in

Isn't it?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Griffin

Yes, we admit that we will not impose

when the purchaser goes to Vermont, buys the article

and takes it with him from the store.
QUESTION:

It is not even in this case.

QUESTION:

No.

MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Pardon me, sir.

It is not in this case.

MR. ZOLEZZI:

No, that is not in this case.

What

we are trying to do is get Griffin to collect the sales tax for
those goods which are delivered into New York State by Griffin’s
trucks by Griffin’s employees.
QUESTION:

Mr. Zolezzi, you assessed a defiency of

$298,000, I think it was.

Is it your understanding that that

was based just on those items delivered by the Plaintiff's
trucks, or was

that on all sales to New York residents?

you used a percentage, I think you
MR. ZOLEZZI:

If

might have --

Well, we used a percentage.

What we

had done was, as I mentioned before, gone to the Vermont Tax
Commission and obtained an amount of money that was used payable

9

payable on sales taxes and sales taxes that were not paid to
Vermont.
We took Griffin's sales —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. ZOLEZZI:
taxes were paid.

Then we had the sales upon which no

We took a percentage of that and we assessed

that against Griffin.
This was done under Section 1138 of our tax law,
1138-A.
QUESTION:

But the question was, were you trying to

get the figure on those delivered in the Plaintiff's truck or
on those goods sold to New York residents?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

We were trying to get the

figure on

the goods that are delivered by Griffin in their trucks to
residents of New York — in New York State.
QUESTION:

And they have very substantial deliveries

if your figures are anywhere near correct.
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

We are of the opinion that they are.

Yes .

MR. ZOLEZZI:

At this point, when we tried to have

an audit, they would not permit us to see the books.

We really

do not have -- we don't know at this point, really, how much they
are doing.

This is a pure estimate.
This is one reason why we would like to have a

hearing so that we could determine if they are liable, if they

10

have — if they do have substantial business within the state.
If they do have substantial business, we are of
the opinion that they shoud render and collect a sales tax for
us .
QUESTION:

Do they do that under the Vermont pro­

ceeding?
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

In the Vermont proceeding?

Yes.

MR. ZOLEZZI:

In other words, if we had a judgment

in New York and went over to Vermont?
QUESTION:

Well, couldn't you have entered into the

Vermont proceeding here and had your hearing?
MR. ZOLEZZI:
ceeding.

Well, we weren't in the Vermont pro­

We were in the federal court and since they had

asked for an injunction, I had moved in a federal court to
dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on
28 U.S.C. 13 and 41 which says that the District Court shall not
enjoin, suspend, restrain the assessment, levy or collection of
taxes

-QUESTION:

And you lost that motion?

MR. ZOLEZZI:

Yes, sir.

It was a three-judge court

that sat on that motion.
QUESTION:

I am asking if you couldn’t have

defended your case when you lost the motion to dismiss?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

It is possible but we preferred to

11

come in on the motion to dismiss because we feel that this
action should be within the New York courts because we feel we
have adequate remedy.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose you lose here?

Then what

are you going to do?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Well, if we lose here, then I imagine

we are just going to have to go into federal court and defend
our actions.
QUESTION:

Then one other question;

you haven't

mentioned or haven’t cited Miller against Maryland, Miller
Brothers against Maryland in your brief.

Somewhere in your

argument, would you comment on it?
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION;

Well, I —

You don’t have to do it now.

Do it

whenever you want to.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

All right.

v
Having made the motion to dismiss for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction, the question before the District
Court in Vermont was whether the State of New York can provide
plain, speedy and efficient remedies.
Unfortunately, the District Court in Vermont felt
that the State of Hew York cannot provide plain, speedy and
efficient remedies and we have now appealed and it is the
position of the State of New York that such adequate remedies
are available.

12

Griffin would have two remedies available to it in
the State of New York.
One would be by an administrative agency judicial
review remedy.

In other words, this is a proceeding under

Article 78 of our civil practice law and rules.
The second method of relief would be by way of
declaratory judgment.
QUESTION:

Would the Constitutional issue be raised?

MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

In an Article 78 proceeding?

Yes, it can.

Does your opposition agree with that?

MR. ZOLEZZI:

I don’t believe he does.

Under the provisions of Section 1138 of the New
York State Tax Law, it specifically provides that there may be
an administrative review by the State Tax Commission of any
assessments determinations of the State Department of Taxation
and Finance.
If the State Tax Department -- State Tax Commission
has this review, the Appellee would come before the Commission,
present all of those facts which it feels would support its
position.
The State Tax Commission then would review the
evidence as it was presented and, based upon that evidence, it
would render a determination.

13
If the determination is favorable to the Appellee,
it would conclude the entire matter.
The State Tax Commission cannot decide the
constitutionality of the statute which the Appellee is claiming
as being constitutionally applied to it, but it can decide
whether a statute should be applied to a particular taxpayer
or person who is asked for a hearing.
The Appellee contends that an Article 78 proceeding
is an inadequate remedy because in order to review the
decision of the State Tax Commission, he would have to commence
an Article 78 proceeding which is judicial review of an
administrative determination.
Prior to bringing an Article 78 proceeding, they
would either have to pay the tax or post the bond for the tax.
The Appellee contends that this would render it net
a speedy, plain or efficient remedy.
As I said before, the Appellee is presupposing that
the determination of the State Tax Commission would be adverse
to it.

I think that in this regard he is trying to make the

State Tax Commission a rubber stamp of the Department of
Taxation and Finance.

It is not.

It must review the evidence as presented and its
decision must be based, in fact, upon the evidence as it has
been reviewed.
QUESTION:

What would it cost to put up the kind of

14

bond that your rule requires, your statute requires for
$298,000 of taxes?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Your Honor, I honestly don’t know what

the bondsman would charge for a percentage to ask for a bond.
QUESTION:

I suppose it would call for collatercil

of at least $300,000, wouldn't it?
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

And probably more.

MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

I would assume.

Once again ~

That is a pretty heavy burden, isn’t it?

MR. ZOLEZZI:

Well, once again, we are at a

position where, while the tax is assessed at $219,000, that is
a high estimate by the Department of Taxation and Finance.
If we had an audit of the books and we actually saw
how much was being delivered into New York State and then
assessed our particular sales tax on that, that amount, that
dollar

amount could be substantially reduced.
That $298,000 should not be taken as a figure which

is absolute, that it would have to post $298,000 bond.
QUESTION:

No, cut it in half.

Cut it in half, it

is still $150,000, isn't it?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Correct.

It may be less than that.

We don't know.
QUESTION:

Would Mr„ Griffin have to submit to an

audit if he went into all of this?

15

MR. ZOLEZZI:

If he went before a hearing before

the Tax Commission?
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

If he —

He would have to open up all of his

books to New York?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

He would have to open up his books

as to those sales which are delivered into New York State.
QUESTION:

And the thing he is complaining about is,

he doesn*t want you to see those books.
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Correct.

So the relief you'11 give him is to make

him show the books.
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Well, if he --

Am I right?

MR. ZOLEZZI:

We are not going to give him the

relief of making him show us the books.
QUESTION:

He can -- let's see -

Well, that is why he filed the case,

isn't it?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

This is why he filed it, correct.

But

we are of the opinion —
QUESTION:

That is the relief he seeks.

MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Correct.

But we are of the

Is there any way in New York he can get

that relief of not being required to show his books?

16

MR- ZOLEZZI:

He can bring an action for declaratory

judgment in the state courts, in which case he can challenge
the constitutionality of the applicability of the New York
taxing statute as it applies to him.
QUESTION:

And, can he get an injunction?

MR. ZOLEZZI:

He can get an injunction under

Section 6301 of the civil -QUESTION:

You wouldn’t oppose it?

MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Pardon me, sir?

You wouldn’t oppose it on the same

grounds?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

That is a policy decision of the

State Tax Commission that I can't make at this point.

I would

assume that we would put up nominal opposition to it, basically
because we would like to get Griffin to court to find out how
much he owes the State of New York.

court

QUESTION:

I thought that was what was in the works.

QUESTION:

That doesn't mean that the New York

would grant it.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Even if we opposed it, the likelihood

of Griffin obtaining an injunction in New York State is
extremely good because under Section 6301, it says that if
irreparable harm would be done to the person seeking the
injunction, the courts will grant an injunction and in this
case, with a $298,000 assessment and Griffin claiming only

17
$250,000 in assets, I am sure the Court would say, "If we don't
grant you injunction, irreparable harm will be done," and they
would.

bond on a small — relatively small business in order

to achieve the opportunity to assert the validity of the tax on
non-constitutional grounds or the validity of the tax on
t

constitutional grounds.
Now, isn't that quite a heavy burden?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

This would be if you took the

Article 73 procedure approach.
QUESTION:

Well, what others would be available?

MR. ZOLEZZI:

The other approach is, that would be

available to him would be -—
QUESTION:

Is the tax.

MR. ZOLEZZI:

If he paid the tax and came into

court and his position was the same, we would not only return
the tax but we would give him six percent interest on top of it.
We do not take the tax money.
QUESTION:

All this is for the privilege of liti­

gating a Vermont businessman's tax liability in another state.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

This would be if he took the Article

7 8 approach.
QUESTION:

What about the injunctive procedure?

18

MR. ZOLEZZI:

And in the injunction proceeding,

which would be an action for declaratory judgment as is provided
for by Section 3001 of our civil practice law and rules, the
Appellee could come into the courts of New York, apply for and
most probably obtain an injunction because irreparable harm
would be done if we were to force him to pay more than his total
assets and net worth.
QUESTION:

And that is the proceeding that Judge

Kaufman and two other New York judges found was inadequate
remedy.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

They found out that was inadequate

remedy.
QUESTION:

For purposes of 1341.

MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Yes, in the Ammex case.

In arguing all this, you get over 1140,

don’t you, and its prohibition or its statement that the other
remedy shall be exclusive and there shall be no declaratory
judgment.
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

1104.

MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Under 1140.

Now, under the provisions —

You have to have an end run around that

statute.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Well, it is not an end run around.

We took it head-on in New York.

Under the declaratory judgment

19

proceedings set forth by Section 3001 of 3001 of the civil
practice law and rules, we

have cases in New York specifically

holding that even though a tax statute says that an Article 78
proceeding shall be the exclusive remedy to be followed, if the
constitutionality of the statute or the applicability of the
statute is challenged, you do not have to follow the Article 78
proceeding, but you can proceed in a way of declaratory
judgment.
QUESTION:

And you think that is of great comfort

to the taxpayer?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

It is a comfort to the tax department.

The answer is yes, because otherwise what will
happen is, if he does not come in and challenge us, eventually
what will happen is, his trucks will come into New York and we
will probably confiscate one and then we are going to run into
the Miller situation, which is probably going to be your next
question.

We are of the opinion that Miller

does not apply in

this particular case.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. ZOLEZZI:

Miller was a situation where the

State of Maryland was trying to impose the collection of the
use and consumption tax of the State of Maryland upon a
Delaware vendor.

Under that case, residents of Maryland would

go into Delaware, purchase their goods and they would bring
them back into Maryland

or, on occasion, Miller would have

20

its trucks deli.ver the goods into Maryland on an occasional
basis.
QUESTION:

So far, precisely the same as this except

for the word "occasional."

Is that the distinction you are

drawing?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Yes, we are of the opinion that there

is substantial business interest within the state.

We feel

that there is more than a minimum contact, that Miller did not
have a minimum contact as such.
Miller did its advertising strictly in the Delaware
papers.

The advertising happened to carry over into Maryland

and Maryland residents then went to Delaware to Miller’s store,
made their purchases and proceeded from there.
In the case at bar, Griffin advertises in New York
newspapers which are published solely in New York.

In its

advertisements, as will be found on page 30 of the Appendix,
there is a map which specifically sets forth the road to be
taken from the Albany, Schenectady and Cambridge areas of New
York to Griffin's store in Vermont.
QUESTION:

Perhaps I got the facts wrong at the

outset, but are you claiming that this taxpayer should collect
a sales tax or a use tax on goods that are sold at its store
and carried away by the customer himself?
MR. ZOLEZZI:
are claiming —

No, sir.

No, sir.

Not at all.

We

21

QUESTION:

Well, then, what is the significance of

these advertisements?
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Well, we say that —

You moan, it is perfectly all right to

advertise in New York and say how to get to our store?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Right.

Solicitation itself would not

be doing business within the state.
QUESTION:

I —

And as long as the customer carries it

away with him, you are not attempting to —
MR. ZOLEZZI:

We are not attempting to collect it.

However, the solicitation within the state coupled
with the delivery by Griffin's employees with Griffin's trucks
and the sending of Griffin's repairmen into the state to do
touch-up work, the cumulative effect of it would be a minimal
contact of doing business or

transacting business within the

state.
We are of the opinion that the contract itself is
not completed until the goods are delivered and the delivery
takes place in the state.
The New York sales tax is a tax which is placed at
time of transfer of possession or title and as this court held
in the Berwind-White case back in 1939, that is a tax which can
be upheld because the tax takes place at transfer of possession
and/or title.
QUESTION:

Have you suggested or did you suggest

22

awhile ago that in this declaratory judgment action available
in the state courts that the tax people would hold their hands
at ending a completion of that action or not?
MR, ZOLEZZI:
hands pending.

I did not say that we would hold our

I just said that the probability of success on

Griffin's part was greater than ever because of the irreparable
harm which would be done prior to the

hearing.

In other words, with a $298,000 tax assessment and
only $250,000 in assets —•
QUESTION:

I suppose you are suggesting that there

is no really flat rule in New York that he could not get an
injunction pending with the «—
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Oh, there is no question.

There is

no rule saying that he could not get an injunction.

He could

get an injunction and the probability of success is great.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Zolezzi, what if, in

Mr. Justice White's words, the Tax
"Hold his hands."

Commissioner decided not to

It still had a long way to go before it

could ever get a judgment even in New York against Griffin,
didn’t it?

I mean, just sending an auditor up to Arlington

wasn't the same thing as getting an enforceable judgment.
MR. ZOLEZZI:
Arlington.

No, we would send the order to

The order to would come back with his report.

Based

upon that, we would commence, an action against Griffin in our
state courts for the enforcement of the injunction.

23

QUESTION:

Besides, it was decided to seize his

trucks.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Unless it was decided to seize his

trucks, correct.
But the practicalities of that are few and far
between because we just don't have the manpower to sit on the
roads from Vermont to New York waiting for different trucks
to come.
QUESTION:
this point.

Mr. Zolezzi, I am somewhat confused at

As I understand you, you are not trying to collect

a tax from the Plaintiffs but, rather, you are trying to collect
something like a penalty because they failed to collect the tax
from their customers.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

No, under the New York State Tax Law,

a vendor who does business within the State of New York is
personally liable for sales taxes.

The sales tax is collected

from the purchaser.
If the vendor

does not collect the sales tax, at

that point the vendor himself would become liable for the sales
tax that he had not collected.
QUESTION:

This is --

Well, on the sales that they do not

make deliveries, where the customer comes in and takes the
merchandise back to New York, who owes what kind of a tax

to

New York on those sales?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

On those sales, the purchaser himself

24
upon coming back would owe the State of New York a use tax for
use within the State of New York but it would not —
QUESTION:

So, regardless of whether or not Griffin

does any business in the State of New York.
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Is that right?

Any --

Wholly apart from that.

MR. ZOLEZZI:

Wholly apart from that.

Any purchase

by a New York resident out of state and brought back in, the
purchaser, on his own honesty, is supposed to

department and say, "I owe you money."
QUESTION:

You are not trying to collect from

Griffin any part of that.
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

No, no part thereof.

Or say that Griffin was supposed to

collect it himself.
MR. ZOLEZZI:
tax.

No, Griffin should not collect that

This is where we differ also from Miller because Maryland

tried to get Miller to collect the use tax.
QUESTION:

Are

you sure of that in Miller?

MR. ZOLEZZI: I am pretty sure of that, your Honor,

QUESTION:

What kind of gross do you collect from

New York residents to Huntington or everywhere else and buy
goods and bring it into New York?

25

MR. ZOLEZZI:

I wouldn't even venture a guess, your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Anything at all?

MR. ZOLEZZI:
honestly don't know.
QUESTION:

I wouldn't venture a guess.

I

I know that on occasion -Why don’t you just put a man out there

at the entrance to that Paramus Center out there in New Jersey?
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Well, this is exactly what happened.

Nine-tenths of the cars are New York cars.

MR. ZOLEZZI:

Well, this is exactly what happened

in ~~ just prior to this Griffin case.

We sent people out and

they had road blocks for the truck mileage tax.
As an incident to collection of the truck mileage
tax for New York State, it was found that many goods were being
shipped into the State of New York and no sales tax was being
collected.
The sales tax in New York is a tax which is
applicable at places of delivery so that even in New York State
your rates vary.

You can buy goods in New York City, which has

an eight percent sales tax, order them shipped to Schenectady
County, which has a four percent sales tax, and you only have to
pay four percent sales tax.
On the other hand, if you buy in Schenectady County
to ship to New York, you pay eight percent, so sales tax takes
place on delivery.

26

QUESTION:

But if Consolidated Edison buys a big

generator for a location somewhere in New York State, from out
of state, the Tax Commission tries to collect a use tax from it,
doesn't it?
MR. ZOLEZZI:

It would try to collect a use tax from

Consolidated Edison —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ZOLEZZI:

But not from the vendor who sold the

generator.
QUESTION:

And Consolidated Edison will probably

end up paying it.
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Correct.

Suppose that you dropped this case, but

if an arrangement was made for Griffin to have stand-by or
recommended delivery services?

As you indicated before, they

©uld completely avoid New York taxes.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Well, if

Griffin arranged for either

mail or common carrier services, then we would fall directly
into a Bellas Hess type of situation where we could not tax
them.

But by the fact that they are using their own trucks,

their own employees and they are sending their own repairmen in QUESTION:

But what if there is a matter of Vermont

law that title passed in Vermont when goods were paid for before
the delivery was made; would you still contend that you could
impose the tax?

27
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Yes, because our tax takes place

upon delivery and if they can obtain a credit in Vermont for
the tax they pay in New York, fine.

But as far as New York is

concerned, we say that our sales tax —QUESTION:
title passes.

You don't pay any attention where the

That is irrelevant.

MR. ZOLEZZI:

Well, under the Uniform Commercial

Code, I believe a title would pass upon completion of delivery
and the completion of delivery takes place in New York State.
QUESTION:

Well, but if as a matter of state law

in Vermont, title passed upon payment for> the merchandise you
could, I suppose, by the intent of the parties, make the
transaction one in which title passed at the time that the
goods were paid for.
MR. ZOLEZZI:
QUESTION:

Well, the New York State Sales Tax -—

You would disregard that as --

MR. ZOLEZZI:

The state sales tax has been upheld

by this Court in the Berwind-White case — is the tax takes
place upon transfer of title and/or possession and possession
transfer is in New York State when delivered by Griffin to the
purchaser in the State of New York.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think your time is

up, Counsel.
MR. ZOLEZZI:

Thank you, your Honor.

I just request

that the lower court's decision be overturned and that the

28

complaint be dismissed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Wickes.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. PAUL WICKES, ESQ.
MR. WICKES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Please the Court:
Section 1341 of Title 28 does not, by its terms
require dismissal of every federal court complaint that involves
state taxes.

Rather, it requires the district court to make

inquiry of the quality of the remedies that are available to
the particular litigant in the state court.
It is not helpful in that analysis to have a long
list of cases which uphold the efficacy of the remedies of a
certain state without testing to see whether they are relevant
to the particular plaintiff in the case before the court.
The Appellants assert the availability of two
remedies for Griffin in this case, both of which, we submit,
don’t pass the test of Section 1341.
The first remedy is that set forth by the statute
which requires as a first step that all of the books and records
of Griffin, Incorporated, be turned over to the taxing authorities
of the State of New York dating back to 1965, which was when the
sales tax was enacted.
The District Court for the Southern District of

29

New York in the United States Steel case specifically held that
submitting to an audit by a taxing authority of questionable
jurisdiction constituted irreparable injury and that if that
audit procedure constituted irreparable injury for United States
Steel Company and the other corporations that were involved in
that litigation, the situation is certainly much worse when we
look at this little Mom and Pop furniture store in Arlington,
Vermont.
QUESTION:

Well, irreparable injury, though, isn't

the test under 1341, is it?

You have to have that to get any

injunction.
MR. WICKES:

That is right, but I think that in the

District Court’s analysis in the United States Steel case, I
think it used the term "irreparable injury" by way of demon­
strating that the remedy was not plain, speedy and efficient.
QUESTION:

But I, certainly reading 1341 literally,

you would have to make out all the ordinary elements of an
injunction which would include irreparable injury.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.
And then show, in addition, that it was

not plain, speedy and efficient.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

That is right.
Incidentally, do you think that the

District Court's findings and conclusions of law in your favor
on the applicability of 1341 can stand side-by-side with

30

Kaufman’s opinion in the Ammex case?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Yes, I do.
How would you distinguish one from the

other?
MR. WICKES:

I think there are important distinctions.

The most important is the fact that the Appellant
tried to ignore all through this case which is that in between
the offices

of the New York State Tax Commission and Griffin

there is a state border and Ammex had eight sales facilities
that were located in the State of New York.

Their challenge to

that sales tax was an import-export clause challenge and a
commerce clause challenge, but there was no due process issue.
QUESTION:

But that goes to the merits of the

constitutional claim, doesn’t it?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

I think it goes -Not to the speedy and adequate nature

of the remedy.
MR. WICKES:

No, I think it goes to the quality of

tie remedy that is available in the state because one of our
contentions has been all along that the very act of going into
New York and invoking one of these remedies may constitute a
submission of jurisdiction in New York itfhich is the basis of
our due process claim and if that is correct, by the act of
going in and raising the claim in New York, we lose it and
Ammex clearly didn’t have that.

31
QUESTION:

But if you have a due process claim, if

you feel there is a constitutional objection to New York
procedure, you are free at the conclusion of the New York court
proceedings to bring that claim here, are you not?
MR. WICKES:

Well, that is right.

is another difference between the Ammex

We are.

There

case which is important,

I think, and that is that there was no issue in that case about
whether or not an injunction was available in the declaratory
judgment proceedings because the parties had stipulated that
there would be no collection activities pending completion
of the litigation and there is no such stipulation here and
Judge Kaufman thought that

stipulation was important.

The final thing I should say about Ammex is, when
Ammex finally got into the Supreme Court in New York, the trial
court in New York, that court held that a declaratory judgment
remedy was improper. In an unreported opinion that is published
in the New York Law Journal in January, the court said, we are
not going to decide this as a declaratory judgment and then it
proceeded to convert it into an Article 78 proceeding and
decided in Ammex' favor on the merits but there is still, I think,
even after Judge Kaufman's decision in Ammex, I think there is a
substantial difference.
That case was before our district court in Vermont.
That was argued fully in the district court.
district court deals with it in its opinion.

I think the

32
The second objection we have to the statutory
procedure is the apparent

inability of the Tax Commission based

on the Hospital Television

Systems case to hear a constitu­

tional challenge to its authority.
Apparently the function of the proceeding in the
Tax Commission is simply to sit and check the arithmetic of
the tax auditors.
Now, the Appellants have argued that we can go in
and present evidence on the constitutional claim before the Tax
Commission but that really begs the question of what is going
on here.
case.

The Tax Commissioners

are the Appellants in this

They have argued all along that on the facts of the case

as they have been disclosed we are liable for the tax.
QUESTION:

Could I ask at this point, is it your

understanding that New York is seeking to collect only the tax
due on the goods that are delivered by your client in New York?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And it is your submission, I take it,

or would be eventually, that New York is constitutionally for­
bidden to impose a sales tax at the point of delivery and make
the deliveror collect it.
MR. WICKES:

When the deliveror is separated by a

state line and has the limited kinds of contacts across that
state line that are present in this case.

We think that except,

perhaps, for the map and the newspaper, this case, in fact, is

33

identical to Millers Brothers.
QUESTION:

Do you think you would have to be i^hat in

cfcher context might be called, "Doing business in New York"?
MR. WICKES:

Well, the sales tax cases of this

Court have set up a pretty clear line between a business on the
one hand which either has people on a regular basis in terms of
sales and soliciting orders, which was the Scripto case, or has
some kind of property or facility in the state and somebody who
just goes in and out on a temporary basis to perform a delivery
the way they did in Millers Brothers.

That is a firm line that

has been held in the sales tax cases.
QUESTION:

Well, would you not concede that if there

were enough trips across the state line, say millions of people
crossing the state line on behalf of this mom and pop store,
that that might give them jurisdiction?
MR. WICKES:

I think that at some point those types

of contacts —
QUESTION:

And if you concede that, how is the State

of New York ever going to find out when that point has been
reached?
MR. WICKES:

Well, I suppose they are going to have

to litigate with a series of people who do an increasing or
decreasing number of trips.
QUESTION:

Well, they are litigating with you now.

Would you agree that if they ask you in discovery

34

what your volume of deliveries is, you would have to tell them
that?
MR. WICKES:

Well, that question came up in the

district court and we indicated some doubt about whether we
would agree that we had to tell them that because I don’t thinkunder Miller Brothers and the sales tax cases it is relevant,
but the relevance of the issue clearly can

be determined in the

district court and the district court
QUESTION:

How can they settle the issue without

having some idea of the magnitude of the transactions within
New York?
MR. WICKES:

Well, the indication in the district

court is that is how they decide that issue and we may well
have to disclose that information.
QUESTION:

If you have to disclose that in the

federal proceeding anyway, what is the irreparable harm about
submitting to an audit?
MR. WICKES:

Well, I think there is the substantial

difference between having to answer an interrogatory that asks
how many trips do you do into New York or even, how many dollars
of business do you do in New York to having to open up your
basements where your records are kept to the sales tax depart­
ment of New York.
QUESTION:

It is just a matter of the burden of

thumbing through a lot of records, is that what it is?

35-37
MR. WICKES:

And in this situation it is a substan­

tial burden.
QUESTION:

But there is no privacy interest at

stake.
MR. WICKES:

Well, not a very important one, I

don't think.
QUESTION:

Just the matter of responding to the

discovery that it is irreparable injury here.
MR. WICKES:

Well, no, I don’t think responding to

discovery would constitute irreparable injury.

I think the

irreparable injury comes about when, by asserting attack in the
face of Miller Brothers in a situation where the facts are as
close to Miller Brothers as they are, the auditors can require
us to turn over all our records.
QUESTION:

I think that is the injury.

Well, then you are just reading

1341 virtually out of the books.

You are saying that any time a

federal court determines that the imposition of the tax is
unconstitutional substantively, it can enjoin the enforcement.
MR. WICKES:

No, I don't think that is true.

I

think —QUESTION:

Even when there is a claim that withstands

the motion to dismiss they can issue an injunction pending a
decision.
MR. WICKES:

Well, I should speak about the

preliminary injunction that was issued in this case for a

38

minute, which is the reason we were here.
'V...
When this case was filed, we had been notified that
an auditor was going to come and we filed and served the
auditor when he came to Vermont.
In the initial pleadings in this case, there was no
request for a preliminary injunction.

We requested a declara­

tory judgment and a permanent injunction but there was no issue
about preliminary injunction.
After the complaint was filed and after the motion
to dismiss was filed, after the state’s memorandum of law was
filed in connection with the motion to dismiss, came this
assessment for $218,000 and the reason we then asked for
interrogatory relief was that on the expiration of 90 days from
the issuance of that assessment, our right to contest the
amount at issue was forever gone

so we asked for the inter­

locutory injunction just to stop that clock from running.
QUESTION:

And you need it to get away from that

$218,000 because that is an awful rich mom and pop, isn’t it?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is, your Honor.
And then you couldn't argue mom and pop

up here, could you?
QUESTION:

Mr. Wickes, suppose you were located in

Troy rather than Arlington.

What is the New York system?

Do

you have to file an annual return of this type of tax?
MR. WICKES:

It is a quarterly return, I thinly, your

39

Honor.

But, yes, it is a self-reporting mechanism, essentially.
QUESTION:

Are you taking the position that under

no circumstances are you subject to New York tax at all?
MR. WICKES:

We are taking the position that under

the present circumstances we are not subject to the New York
sales tax.
QUESTION:

Not on these del5.veries of furniture to

New York purchasers.
MR. WICKES:

That’s right.

That’s right.

Because

the issue isn't whether there is a tax due on that transaction.
There clearly is a tax due on that transaction.

It is the

use tax which the New York purchaser is supposed to pay.
The issue is whether we have sufficient contacts in
New York that New York can constitutionally require us to put
on their tax collectors’ hats.

That is what this case is

about, not whether there is a tax due.
QUESTION:

Well, does Griffin or anybody pay

Vermont sales tax on what is delivered in New York?
MR. WICKES:

No, there is no sales tax paid on that

transaction.
QUESTION:

But if it is within Vermont it is paid by

the Vermont person.
MR. WICKES:
New York.

Not if the goods ar>e delivered into

If it were delivered in Vermont or picked up in

Vermont they pay the Vermont sales tax.

40

QUESTION:

So as a matter of fact, Griffin pays

neither use tax nor sales tax.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Well, the store never pays a use tax.
Well, Griffin sets up a deal where

neither he nor the purchaser pays taxes.
MR. WICKES:

Well, not under the statute because

under the statute, the purchaser in that situation is
required to pay the tax.
QUESTION:

Well, as of now, the people in Albany

who buy the property in Vermont and it is delivered in the
Griffin truck in Albany, nobody pays either sales tax or use
tax on that delivered furniture.
MR. WICKES:

All right.

Well, there isn't anything

in the record to suggest that people ignore their tax statutes
and the tax is due on that transaction.
QUESTION:
MR. WICKES:

You assume that they pay the use tax.
I assume some number of them do and I

assume some number of them don’t.
QUESTION:

And what New York wants is double tax.

Is that the case?
MR. WICKES:

No, it is not.

It is not.

What they

want is for use to be their collectors because a lot of their
people, apparently they think don’t pay their taxes.
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, this suit is all

based on the fact that the New York furniture people complained.

41

MR. WICKES:

Well, that is what the tax

assessment was based on.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wickes, there seems to be a difference

between your view of the tax and your opponent’s view of the
tax.

He told me that the tax which would be payable on the.

merchandise delivered by your trucks to New York people at
their residences would be a sales tax.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Right.

Umn hmn.

And you are saying it would be — the

only tax due would be use tax.
MR. WICKES:
the merits.

That is exactly the dispute here on

That is the dispute because if it is a sales tax

we would have to collect it and if it is a use tax, we don't
have to collect it.
QUESTION:

So that the issue is one of whether as a

matter of New York law, the tax payable on the transactions in
dispute is a sales tax or a use tax.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Well, that —
If that is the issue, can you give me

some New York authority for the position you maintain?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:
MR. WICKES:

That is not the issue.
Oh, I thought that was what it was.
You see, the way the New York sales tax

works is that on every transaction where the sale takes place
in New York, the seller is required to collect the tax and then

42

it goes on to say, "If there is a situation where the seller
doesn’t collect the tax, there is the use tax due,"
fact, called "The compensating use tax."

It is, in

It is to make up

for this situation.
QUESTION:

But before you get to the "if" it does

say that the seller must collect the sales tax in that
situation.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

That is right.
And do not these transactions fit

precisely that situation?
MR. WICKES:

They do if New York can, as a matter

of federal constitutional lav;, make them pay taxes.
QUESTION:

As a matter of New York State tax law

we are talking about a sales tax rather than a use tax.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

That is right.
So you were mistaken earlier because

you said it was a use tax.
MR. WICKES:

I just want to be sure.

No, I am sorry.

I guess I am not

being clear.
It is a sales tax if we lose the case, because it
is a use tax only in a situation where, for one reason or
another, the sales tax doesn’t apply so if we win the case and
don’t have to collect the sales tax, then what New York
collects from its purchaser is a use tax.
QUESTION:

Yes, but what they are trying to collect

43

is a sales tax.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

That is right.
All right.

MR. WICKES:

That is right.

That is what they are trying to make

us collect.
QUESTION:

Suppose Griffin's salesmen brought the

furniture over and delivered it to an Albany home and said,
"This is worth $125.

If

you give me $125 it is yours."

Would New York be entitled to sales tax?
MR. WICKES:

No, New York would be entitled to the

use tax is our position on that.
QUESTION:

Well, if Griffin comes over and says,

"Mr. Jones, I want to make a sale to
this chair for $140.

you.

I want to sell you

You give me $140 and it is yours."

New York is entitled to sales tax from Griffin.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:
MR. WICKES:

That is right.
And the difference is what?
The difference is —
Is that you were paid in Vermont.
No,

No.

The difference is — is under

Miller Brothers — is that given the way Griffin transacts
business, it doesn't have enough contact in New York to allow
New York to require it to be a tax collector to fill that
function for it.
QUESTION:

Suppose you make that C.O.D.?

44
MR. WICKES:
situation.

I don't think that

changes the

I don't think the question of where the money

changes hands affects the situation.
QUESTION:

Well, if the money and the property and

everything else changes hands in New York, I think New York
has some interest.
MR. WICKES:

Well, the point is, under the Miller

Brothers and the Bellas Hess analysis, you don't look at a
single transaction and determine what tax applies in that
transaction.

You look at the way the party conducts his

business and ask the question of whether he has got in this
total picture enough contact and that is it.
QUESTION:

And that is just what New York would like

to get from you.
MR. WICKES:

Yes, it is.

Yes, it is.

Now, the Appellants have argued that we have got a
declaratory judgment procedure available as an alternative to
the state proceedings and they cite ten cases in support of
that proposition.
On careful analysis, not one of those cases can
safely lead us to conclude that a declaratory judgment
proceeding will be available in this case.
Sections 1138 and 1140 of the New York State
sales tax law are extraordinarily clear1 in saying that no
declaratory judgment challenge is available for any kind of a

45

tax litigation, whether it involves constitutional questions
or no t.
All but one of the cases cited by the Appellants in
support of their declaratory judgment argument were decided
under statutes that don't talk about forbidding declaratory
judgment challenges in constitutional cases and the courts as
a matter of statutory interpretation said, since the statute
doesn't forbid it for constitutional challenge, you can use a
declaratory judgment challenge in that case.
Two of the cases quoted, including the one that is
decided under this section of the act, have some language
about declaratory judgment actions but on the facts of the case
that is not the issue involved.
Those are the Hospital Television Systems and the
First National City Bank case.
And three of the cases that are cited in support of
this declaratory judgment remedy, while the court talked about
the possibility that it might be available in some case, in
fact, they threw the plaintiff out and sent him back to the
tax commis sion.
It is impossible to read the declaratory judgment
cases in New York and find a rationale that can lead to
confidence that that procedure is going to be available in
this court.
QUESTION:

But now, in a sense, that is where Ammex

46

and the district court here conflict, do they not?
MR. WICKES:

I think that Judge Kaufman's opinion

in Ammex is considerably more certain about the availability
of declaratory judgment than it should have been.
QUESTION:

And yet, he and the other two judges on

that panel were New York judges and presumably ex-New York
practitioners and in your case the district court consisted,
as it properly should have, of three Vermont practitioners, or
former practitioners.
MR. WICKES:

That is right and Judge Oakes is one

of them who sits in the Second Circuit in New York City but
that is right.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wickes, was the First National City

Bank case before the three-judge court when this case was
argued and decided?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

I don't remember, your Honor.
It was decided — the First National

City Bank case was decided late in 1975, as I recall, and as
you suggest, with a very clear statement there that the word
"exclusive" does not apply where you have a constitutional
issue.
MR. WICKES:

That is right.

There is a very clear

statement but it has nothing to do with the decision that the
court had to make in that case.
QUESTION:

Nevertheless, it is a clear statement

47

by the

highest court of New York.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
May I ask you this question?

If you

were satisfied that declaratory judgment relief followed by
injunctive relief were available in the New York courts, would
you be here?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:
MR. WICKES:

I would, your Honor?
Why?
Because of the fear that invoking the

remedies of the New York State Court may cost us our due
process argument, which is an argument that says, we have such
insubstantial contacts in New York State that the courts of
that state don't have jurisdiction over it sufficient to
support a judgment in a tax case and I think if we walk
New York and ask

into

them for a declaratory judgment, we may

well cause ourselves some problems on that issue.
QUESTION:

Why?

You would present that issue

right there, wouldn’t you?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, your Honor, right where?
You would present your due process issue

right there.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, you may lose it, but you would

certainly press it on appeal.
MR, WICKES:

Well, but the point is, I think we

48

cause risk to that issue by the act of invoking the remedy,
is the problem.
QUESTION:

You think that they would say you had

now made a general appearance and you are now under the
jurisdiction or something like that?
MR. WICKES:

So far as I know there is no special

appearance proceeding available to us on this issue.
QUESTION:

Why, no, but whether it is a general or

a special appearance isn't really the point.
the one my brother White makes.
of your complaint.

The point is

That would be the very basis

You can go into any court and claim that.

MR. WICKES:

I think -- I am saying that I think

there is a risk to us there and a risk that 1341 does not
require us to take.
Now, another problem with a declaratory injunction
proceeding is the question of whether an injunction is available
if the Tax Commission decides to proceed if, when we bring a
declaratory judgment proceeding, the way they issued their
assessment here after we went into the federal courts.
QUESTION:

Well, now, have their been instances in

New York practice where the Supreme Court of New York has
issued a declaratory judgment holding a tax not applicable?
And the State Tax Commission has nonetheless gone ahead and
tried to levy it?
MR. WICKES:

Our problem is different than that in

49

this case.
Our problem is the fact that when that assessment
is issued in the first instance, a clock starts to run and at
the end of 90 days the amount of the assessment is fixed and
forever unchallengeable and if we go in and bring a declaratory
judgment proceeding in New York and they start that clock
running the way they started it here and we lose our declara­
tory judgment challenge, we are stuck with 218 or 298 or
whatever thousands of dollars they —
QUESTION:

I thought you were distinguishing

between a declaratory judgment and an injunction and as I
understand it, the only difference between those remedies is
that, one, if the defendant violates it, he can be held in
contempt and the other, if he violates it, he can't be held
in contempt, that you could raise every issue on the merits
in the declaratory judgment action that you couldn't in the
injunction action.
MR. WICKES:

That's right, but the risk here is the

risk of what happens to us if we lose the declaratory judgment
action.

That is, it is eventually determined that we

constitutionally are liable for the tax and in the meant5.me,
we have lost the ability to contest the amount of the taxes
because of its assessment in the 90-day period.
QUESTION:

Well, that would be equally true if you

lost the injunctive action, wouldn't it?

50

MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.
I thought you were distinguishing

between them.
MR. WICKES:

No, I am not.

What I am. saying is,

the problem with the asserted remedy in New York is, that if
the Tax Commission starts the clock running, there isn’t any­
thing the New York court can do to stop that clock.
QUESTION:

And —

Mr. Wickes, that may be so, but it may

be that you might, like the other taxpayers, might have to
resort to your administrative remedies if you want to have the
amount of the tax reviewable in court.
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Well, that is right, but the point is All right, if you have your declaratory

judgment action and you are afraid about what is happening to
you administratively, you litigate before the administrator,
too.
MR. WICKES:

Well, I think if this Court determines

that these remedies in New York are plain, speedy and efficient
then that is the situation we are going to have.
If it determines that, it seems torie that what you
have done is, you have read those words out of the statute
because the statute doesn’t say that the federal courts are
without jurisdiction whenever there is any remedy available
in the statute.

It clearly imposes some test about the

quality of those remedies.

51

QUESTION:

Who lias the burden of proof on showing

the remedy issue, that it is plain and efficient and so forth?
HR. WICKES:

The district court, I think, in effect-

treated that as a question of law.

There was no — I suppose

because of the way the statute is written, it is our burden
to come in and show that the remedies are insufficient.

That

was, you know, that was the manner in which this thing was
argued out in the district court.
It seems to me there is a presumption under 1341 and
aider the cases that are decided under it that,

just in terms

of numbers, that the remedies are probably adequate and it is
up to us.

We pleaded in the complaint that 1341 wasn’t a bar

because the remedies weren't adequate and I think the burden
was on us to make that argument in the district court.
Another thing I think that it is important to say
is that in order to affirm the decision of the district court
in this case it is not necessary to make any expansion of the
categories of cases that are permitted to be heard in the
district courts under 1341.
In Spector against McLaughlin and in the Township of
Hillsborough case, both of which were decided in the 1940's,
this Court held that the situations where the availability of
appropriate remedies was unclear it was proper for the District
Court to hear the case and in a couple of cases that were
decided under Section 1342, which is the companion statute to

52
1341 that deals with administrative raid orders, this Court
specifically said that the state with a statute that denies
relief, when that statute has not been authoritatively over­
turned by the State Supreme Court, can't come into the
federal court and speculate that it may not be followed and
on that basis, try to get the case dismissed under Section
13 41.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wickes, may we come back a minute to

your wanting to stop the clock from running?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Suppose a three-judge court in Vermont

had decided the constitutional question against you.
you have

Would

gone into the New York State Tax Commissioner to

keep the clock from running on you or what would you have
done there?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

If our complaint had been dismissed?
Suppose the preliminary injunction had

not been issued by the three-judge court, what would you have
done?
MR. WICKES:

Well, I think we probably would have

had to go into New York with all the risks that that carries
and tried to stop that clock.
QUESTION:

Could you have gone both ways simul­

taneously or sought an injunction, say, in the three-judge
court and pursued

administrative remedies in New York just to

53

protect yourself as to the amount of the tax?
MR. WICKES:

I am not sure whether we could have

done that or not, your Honor.
we could not.

I don't know of any reason why

It turns out not to be necessary because the

motion for the preliminary injunction was granted.
QUESTION:

If you could have done it in Vermont,

could you have done it in New York?
MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:
MR. WICKES:

In the New York state courts?
Yes.
I think the answer to that is no

because I think the New York law that prohibits the granting
of injunctions

in these kinds of cases is so clear.

There

is not one case that suggests that that statute is going to be
QUESTION:

But you have very substantial dicta

that —
MR. WICKES:

Not on the point of injunctions.

declaratory judgment there is.

On

There isn't even a hint of

dicta about injunctions, not in any of these cases, thex-’e
isn't even a suggestion that that injunction ban is going to
be ignored.
QUESTION: Is there any negative language?
MR. WICKES:

The issue hasn't been raised so far

as I know.
QUESTION:

What is your -- I thought receded from

what I thought was a distinction you were making about

54

injunction versus declaratory judgment.

Is your point

that

even though you would get a declaratory judgment, there is
some prospect that the Tax Coinmission would go ahead not­
withstanding the state court saying the levy was unconstitu­
tional and levying on the property anyway?
MR. WICKES:

No, no, that is not the problem.

Our

point really has to do with the ability of the New York
courts to grant a preliminary injunction to preserve the
status quo,to protect our right eventually if we have to, to
contest the amount of the taxes that are due if we lose on the
merits.
QUESTION:
MR. WICKES:

For what reason —
There is no distinction between a

declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction.
QUESTION:

Well, what reason do you have to think

that a declaratory judgment -- it wpn't come up on the motion
calendar rather than a trial calendar.
I mean, what reason do you think that an action for
declaratory judgment won't be heard within the same time span
in New York as an application for a preliminary injunction?
MR. WICKES:

I don’t have any reason to think that»

The problem is that a preliminary declaratory
judgment isn’t going to tell the Tax Commission not to issue
this assessment the way they did in this case.
I mean, I don’t know what a preliminary declaratory

55

judgment is.
QUESTION:
thought, was,

I don't, either.

What I asked you, I

an ordinary declaratory judgment --

MR. WICKES:
QUESTION:

Yes?
-- couldn't that be heard by the New

York courts within the same time span as an application for a
preliminary injunction?
MR. WICKES:

I doubt that we could fully litigate

the merits of this case in the same time as you could hear a
kind of ordinary preliminary injunction motion, any more than
we could have completed this litigation in the district courts
faster than we heard the preliminary injunction.
I mean, that is the point of a preliminary injunction
is that it is an expedited proceeding and you don't have to
you
make a full determination and/talk about likelihood of success
on the merits and not ultimate results and that is what is
unavailable to us in this case and I think it is clearly
indicated.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen, the

case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3:07 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted and the Honorable Court was adjourned
until the following day.]
