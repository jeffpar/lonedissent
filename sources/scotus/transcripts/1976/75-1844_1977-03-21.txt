MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. RUPP
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUPP.
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

The government petitioned for writ of certiorari in.

this case after a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit had approved a dismissal of three counts
of the indictment.

Unlike fch© district court, the Court of

Appeals based its decision on th® Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment, holding -that respondent had satisfied what
the majority characterized as the two basic elements essential
’Co a daim of impermissible pre-accusation delay - -unreasonable­
ness on the part of the government

and prejudiced his ability

to defend against th© charges.
Because we believe th® decision in this case to be
incorrect and because that decision conflicts "with the approach
taken by several other courts of appeals on two recurring
issues of substantial importance, w© sought further review
by this Court.
I should like to begin this afternoon by outlining
as briefly as I can th© context in which th® issues presented
hare arose.

Respondent was indicted on March 6, 1975, on

4
three counts of unlawful possession of materials stolen from
tlie mails and one count of dealing in firearms without a
license.

The indictment, referred- specifically to eight handguns

that, respondent allegedly had possessed and sold between July 25
and August 31# 1973.
six days after his indictment respondent moved under
Rule 48 of -the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the
Sixth Amendment to have the charges against him dismissed.
He alleged in that motion that the government had not obtained
any information relating to the charges in the indictment
after September of 1973, that the ensuing delay of approximately
18 months was unreasonable# that that delay had caused him to
experience anxiety and concern.

He did not claim that the

delay had impaired his ability to defend against the charges.
The parties stipulated at the outset of the hearing
held on the motion to dismiss that a postal inspector had
interviewed respondent in September of 1973 about a series
of thefts from the Terminal Railroad Association facility in
St. Louis.

The parties also stipulated that investigation of

the thefts had continued 'diar@aft.er but that the government
had discovered only on® witness after September of 1973 who
might have bolstered its case.
Respondent attempted to support his claim that the
government had possessed sufficient evidence as of September
of 1973 to warrant presenting that evidence to the grand jury

5

by introducing the report that had been prepared by the
postal inspector *

That report described, a series of purchases

of semi-automatic handguns from two men in August and
September of 1973, all of which had been stolen after mailing
from the Terminal Railroad Association in St. Louis.

The

report stated that the agents had traced the weapons to a man
named Jos Boas and that Boas had admitted that he had obtained
the weapons from respondent,

The report further indicated

that the postal inspector had interviewed respondent in the
presence of respondent’s attorney on September 26, 1973.
Respondent, who was then working as a switchman
for the Terminal Railroad Association and would not have had
access to insured mail parcels in the normal course of his
duties, admitted to the postal inspector that he had sold Boaz
four or five weapons.

Respondent attempted to explain his

possession of those guns by claiming that he had found them in
a sack in th© back seat of his automobile after having gone to
the Terminal Railroad Association to visit his son who worked
•there as a mail handler.

The .report notad, finally, that

although respondent’s son had cashed four or five of the
checks given by Boas as payment for th© guns, the postal
inspectors had no direct evidence that respondent’s son was
responsible for th© thefts.
Respondent testified at the hearing on th© motion to
dismiss that two "possible"' witnesses on his behalf had died

6

during the 18-month delay referred to in his motion —- his
brother and a man named Tom Stewart.

According to respondent,

his brother had died approximately one year before the hearing,
had worked at the same place of business as Boaz, and had been
present when h@ had made arrangements by telephone to sell the
guns to Boaz.

Respondent claimed that Stewart was his source

for two or three of the guns and that Stewart had died
approximately six months before the hearing.

Again, however,

respondent stated for the first time that he had not disclosed
Stewart*s involvement earlier because of fear of retaliation
from Stewart.
Respondent’s testimony obviously raised a number of
questions.

For example, the fact that respondent had told th©

postal inspector that he had sold Boaz only the guns h© had
found in the back seat of his car and no more was inconsistent
with his assertion at the hearing that ha had obtained two or
three of those guns from Stewart.

Similarly, fear of retaliation

from Stewart could hardly have accounted for respondent's
failure

to mention» at the time h© filed his motion to dismiss,

Stewart's involvement, sine®, according to respondent, Stewart
had been dead at that time for approximately six months.

And,

furthermore, at no time during the hearing on the motion to
dismiss did respondent indicate what exculpatory testimony his
brother cr Stewart might have provided.
Despite these problems, th© district court dismissed

7
ail counts of the indictment»
QUESTION:

Who was the judge, Mr. Rupp?

MR. RUPP:

Judge Regan.

The court based its dismissal on. Rul© 48 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, finding that the government
had not adequately justified the 18-month delay referred to in
the motion to dismiss and that respondent had been prejudiced
by th® death of Torn Stewart, whom the court characterized as
a material witness on his behalf.
A divided panel of the court of appeals affirmed
dismissal of th© possession counts and reversed dismissal of
the account of the indictment charging respondent with having
dealt in firearms without a license.

Although the majority

credited th® government's explanation for th® delay as sterming
from an effort on its part to discover persons in addition to
respondent who may have b-.aen responsible for the thefts, the
court majority nevertheless concluded that the government had
not -sufficiently justified the delay and then that delay was
therefore unreasonable.
Th® court also accepted the district court’s finding
that respondent had been prejudiced by the death of Tom Stewart,
adding,without any basis,that were Stewart’s testimony available,
it would have supported respondent's claim that he did not
know that th® guns had been stolen from th© mails.
It may be worth mentioning, sine® respondent has

■e
raised the matter, at least briefly, that there is no
impedingjvfc to this Court®s reaching th© issues presented in
the petition»

It is true that th© thrust of the government’s

opening brief on appeal was not directed at those issues, but
the reason for that was that the district court had based its
decision not on th® Fifth Amendment but on Rule 48 of th®
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which, of coux*se, is not
applicable to th© pre-accusatory phase of criminal proceedings.
Thus, more importantly, as the opinions in this case
make clear, th© panel expressly considered tha issues presented
to this Court relying ultimately upon th® view of the Due
Process Clause that th© government disputed on rehearing in
that court and which is before -this Court.
The decision in this case imposes upon th® government,
via tli© Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, a duty of
sossedy accusation, roughly equivalent to, in some respects more
stringent than, th© speedy trial obligations specifically
imposed by the Sixth Amendment.

The standard employed here

for measuring the permissibility of pre-accusation delay cannot
b® squared with -hills Court's decision in Marior,.

Indeed, it

renders that decision largely meaningless.
Our position with respect to cases of this sort,
remains what it was at th© time Marion was decided.

That is

that the Due Process Claus© is not violated by delay in the
institution of formal criminal proceedings unless that delay

9

was part of an effort on th® government’s part to prejudice
the defense or perhaps, alternatively, v/as engaged in by the
government in reckless disregard of known risks of prejudice
to th© defense and actually caused such prejudice.
At the heart of the decision in Marion was this
Court's conclusion that th® disability suffered by potential
defendants did not in th© vast majority of cases begin to
compar® with the disability suffered by those who ar© actual
defendants.

The potential defendant is not required to live
*

under the stigma that
accusation.

almost inevitably attends formal public

The differences ar® even more dramatic in the

case of defendants who are incarcerated prior to trial.
Unlike the pre-accusatory period, furthermore, delay
in formal accusation until the government has completed its
investigation may benefit th© defendant and society in a
variety of ways.

Investigation beyond the point of mere

probable cause, for example, may result in th® discovery of
evidence exculpating the defendant, thereby avoiding
unwarranted or ill-considered charges of criminal conduct.
It may lead to the discovery of ameliorating evidence and a
discretionary decision not to prosecute.

It may lead to th®

discovery of evidence indicating that the person originally
under suspicion probably also committed other crinies or that
additional persons were, involved, thus facilitating the
resolution of related charges against all in a single

10

proceeding»

li; has often mad© possible tee shortening of tee

time between formal accusation and trial.
far from insubstantial.

These interests are

They cannot b® ignored in assessing

th© scop© of the government’s duty under the Du® Process Clause.
It is an exceedingly serious matter to immunize from
trial on® whom th® government has reason to believ® is guilty
of criminal conduct.

A remedy so stringent# in our judgment,

should be reserved for those cases of affirmative governmental
misconduct.

That is not to say that th© Due Process Claus® is

never violated without proof of affirmative governmental
misconduct.

Brady and Agurs stand to the contrary.

But the

remedy for violation of the government's duty to provide the
defense with exculpatory testimony in a Brady or Agurs context
is net the vary stringent remedy of dismissing all charges
immunizing tea defendant from further prosecution but remanding
the case for a new trial.
I want to emphasize here as clearly as I can that
so long as formal accusation is delayed pending further
investigation, as it was in this case, we believe that delay
can never be considered unjustified, should never be held to
constitute a breach of th® government's duty to a particular
defendant.

As Mr. Justice Powell pointed out in Watson, good

police practice often requires postponing an arrest even after
probable caus® has been established in order to develop further
evidence to proves guilt to a jury.

Hof fa is to th© same effect.

11
As Mr. Justice Stewart stated for the Court in that case, law
enforcement officers a.r© under no constitutional duty to call
a halt to a criminal investigation the moment they have the
minimum evidence to establish probable cause, a quantum of
evidence which may fall far short of the amount necessary to
establish guilt to a jury.
Wa do not mean to suggest, however, that the public
policies making delay in th© institution of formal criminal
proceedings an inevitable and desirable part of the criminal
process necessarily eliminates all concern with the expeditious
enforcement of the criminal lav/s.

There may be times, hopefully

they will ba rar®, when delay in formal accusation is th© result,
of efforts on th® government's part to prejudice the defense
and such prejudice occurs.

There may also be times, w© hop©

equally rare, when th© government engages in delay in reckless
disregard of known risks of prejudice to the def©ns© and such
prejudice occurs.

As w© acknowledged in Marion the Du© Process

Claus© is available to remedy abuses of those sorts which injur©
society as well as the criminal accused.

But in other than

those rare cases, we do not believe that the Due Process Claus©,
<

requires courts to consider th® timeliness on an ad hoc basis
of criminal charges brought within the applicable statute of
limitations.

As this Court pointed out in United States v. Ewell,
statutes of limitation stand as th© primary guarantee against

12
th© bringing of overly stale criminal charges.

Thay represent

a legislative balancing of society's int€ir@st in equitable
law enforcement and the interests of potential defendants in
being freed from having to defend themselves against charges
of long past criminal conduct.

To fo@ sure, statutes of

limitation war© never intended to immunize from judicial
scrutiny prosecutorial misconduct however unfair occurring
within the applicable limitations period, but they do take
into account th© fact that the timing of decisions to prosecute
should b@ or naces^arisy are affected both by th@ need to
proceed with car© and deliberateness and by a variety of
institutional factors, th© need to assign priorities, for
©xampX©, to the prosecution of some cases rather than others.
A standard for measuring the permissibility of pre­
accusation delay, such as that employed here, would involve
th© courts in the same process in which Congress is ©ngagad
in enacting statutes of limitations.

More importantly, w©

believe the courts should avoid the kind of ad hoc inquiry
into th© permissibility of pre-accusation delay that was
engaged in her# for a variety of eminently practical considera­
tions ,
First, if th© standard in this case w@r© to be used
widely, courts would h® required in perhaps a majority of
cases to attempt to determine the point at which the government
was obligated to take its case to th® grand jury, whether

13

measured against, a standard of probable cause or some other
standard.

A determination of that sort would involve nearly

insuperable problems of proof.
Second, it would make little sens®, if the duty is
so conceived, to limit it to government prosecutors.

If the

Dus Process Claus© is construed as embodying a prompt accusation
requirement, that duty presumably would extend to government
investigators generally.

We believe that judicial efforts to

supervise th® conduct of criminal investigations by reviewing
them at th® behest of individual defendants would have very
serious import for the administration of criminal justice.
Third, a prompt accusation requirement would
necessitate the holding of lengthy hearings, trial before the
trials in almost ©very case before th© required determinations
could be mad® with any assurance.
to

Th© prosecutor would have

document in detail the course of th© investigation leading

to the charges and particularly if the hearing were held before
trial of the general issue, the prosecutor would have to
provide a dress rehearsal of his cas® in an effort to show
that the time consumed by the investigation was reasonable under
circuit;stances.

At th© same time, th© courts would b@ required

to attempt to rssolve in th© context of the particular cas©
a variety of essentially policy disputes that transcend th®
individual case, whether available prosecutory resources war©
appropriately devoted to the prosecution of on© matter

rather

14

than another , whether the importance of continuing an agent
in an undercover capacity was more important than proceeding
with the prosecution of the particular defendant whose involve­
ment Was known. It is no answer to suggest that delay for any
°i these reasons is avoidable and is therefor© chargeable to
the government.

In fact, they are relevant to determining under

the Due Process Clause whether in light of all the circumstances
the government has proceeded consistently with shared notions
of fair play and fundamental decency.
We thus submit that the courts l>3low erred in dis­
missing three counts of the indictment in this case on the
basis of pre-accusation delay.

The indictment was returned

within 20 months of the offenses charged, well within th©
applicable 5-year statote of limitations.

Respondent neither

alleged nor sought to show that the government had delayed in
order to gain an impermissible tactical advantage,

neither has

respondent ever suggested that th© government proceeded in
reckless disregard of known risks of prejudice to him.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rupp, at that point, do you feel that

what you have just said now should b@ the burden of the

defendant?
MR. RUPP:

Yes, I do, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

QUESTION:

Isn’t this material that is specifically

within th® control and knowledge and awareness of th© government?
MR. RUPP:

Th© first standard, the standard that we

15
specifically suggested in Marion, the prosecutory misconduct
standard, is to some extent a subjective feast, and the evidence
that would be needed to sustain it, at least to son® extent,
would be ’within the hands of the government, although the
United States attorneys or assistant United States attorneys
responsible for delay could be, and I assume would be, called
to the stand and -asked to explain the reasons for the delay.'
I don’t think that we can assume that government counsel would
not answer those questions candidly.
The second alternative, or perhaps supplemental
standard is a good deal more objective,

government

proceeding with known risks ©£ prejudice to the defendant.
Now, that standard and the evidence needed to sustain a case
under that standard would not necessarily be within th©
exclusive control of th© government.

If, for example, a

defendant had communicated, as this respondent did not, that
evidence in his possession needed for any defense he might
have to put on was disapoiaring and the government, despite
that knowledge, proceeded to delay or continued to delay, such
evidence would go a long way toward making out a case.
QUESTION:
Blackmun’s question?

Mr. Rupp, may I follow up on Mr. Justice
I wonder if you have given sufficient,

consideration to your answer that th® government prosecutor
would readily tak© th© stand in discovery in connection with
such a pretrial motion.

Is that a considered position of th©

16
government or one you just felt was an appropriate answer to
a question you might not have thought -through?
MR. RUPP:

Well, I have not discussed it with others.

QUESTION:

Because that would b@ a rather dramatic

departure from what I understand the normal practice of
prosecutors to fo© if they are askad to testify about their
investigation of charges and the like.
MR. RUPP:

Well, I certainly am prepared to go back

to the Justice Department and obtain the government’s position.
QUESTION:

In fact, it*s my concern about tee

Undesirability of such discovery and that type of practice that
makes mo question the wisdom of the test that the government
advances in this particular case.
MR. RUPP:

Well, in this case government counsel

entered into with respondent a stipulation which encompassed
these matters.

I would assume that in many cases such factors

could ba stipulated to.
Now, tea governmental misconduct standard, we fully
anticipate that the case would be exceedingly rare in which
government counsel has affirmatively engaged in the kind' of
misconduct we think alone would violate the Due Process Claus®.
QUESTION:

I must confess that although the words

sound persuasive when you give them, I have some difficulty
■blinking of concrete examples teat fit. your test.

And tee

government normally I suppose wants to convict people it

17
believes are guilty

of crimes.

What is th® kind of

misconduct that might justify —
MR. RUPPs

Perhaps all of th® conduct that might be

encompassed under the governmental misconduct standard would
also be encompassed# I think it probably would be encompassed#
within th© standard of proceeding in vi®w of known risks of
prejudice to the defense.
QUESTION:

Well# supposing one of the witnesses is

an elderly man and th© government believes h® is going to
testify falsaly to an alibi.

Falsely.

crime was committed as alleged.

They are' satisfied th©

If they delayed a couple of

months because) they thought he might not be available as a
witness when h@ was going to be a false witness, would that
justify dismissal of th© indictment?
(Pause.3
MR. RUPPs

The elderly gentleman is not th© defendant

but a witness or prospective witness in the case?
QUESTION:

Mr. Lovasco's grandfather,

(Pause.)
MR. RUPP:

I suppose it would.

And the reason is

that it will seldom be trues that th© government will know with
100 percent assurance that the anticipated testimony of a
witness is going to be false.

That is th© decision to b© made

by the jury# and if th® government is 98 percent sur© that
someone is going to testify falsely and it will be difficult to

18

overcome 'that testimony and it proceeds to delay with the full
intent to prosecute at son© later time when -that witness may
not b@ available, I think that that is the kind of governmental
misconduct th© standard would encompass.

But I also think

that it would bs* encompassed by th® risk alternative formulation,
that is, the government proceeding despite its knowledge that
th® defendant suffers a very real chance* of being prejudiced
by any delay.
Now, in th© event that evidence the defendant feels
is needed is in the process of disappearing, on® of th© things
ha can do, of course, is to contact th© United States attorney
and inform him of that fact.

In this case, respondents could

4.
•

hardly have claimed teat tea government proceeded recklessly
with respect to th© two witnesses h@ testified at th.® hearing
would have been available earlier •—
QUESTION:

May I understand you correctly, you

think it*s tea criminal's responsibility to insist that ha h©
indicted?
MR. RUPP:

Ho.

Of course not.

QUESTION:

Well, what is it you are talking about?

You said he should get in touch with th® prosecutor.
MR. RUPP :
something as follows:
QUESTION:

A conversation of that sort might go
“I am innocent —
I can’t find any place in th© Constitution

that puts a burden on a man to get indicted.

19

MR. RUPP:

We are not suggesting for the moment that

respondent here should call the United States attorney and say,
"Indict, me."

What respondent might have don® is to say that

"I am innocent, the evidence, or some of the evidence I need to
establish my innocence may not b® available at some point in
the future.

If you are ever going to indict me, indict me nov/."

QUESTION:

MR. RUPP:

QUESTIONs

conviction which is achieved by a jury on a charge of tactics
such as were mad© in this case unless it is satisfied that it’s
in til® interest of justice to do so, too.
MR. RUPP:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Is there any case in this Court that says

it’s the responsibility of a parson allegedly about to be
charged with a crime to get ia touch with the U.S. attorney?
MR. RUPP s
for the moment.

Ho.

And we ar© not contending for that

Th@ government, for example, may learn from

third parties wholly unrelated to the defense that there is son.®

20

risk that evidence relevant to' the case

is about to be lost.

If the government nonetheless proceeds to delay, and it could
proceed^ that would in our judgment fall under the test that
w@ are contending for here.
QUESTION:

How would the defendant find out

that the government had that information?
MR. RUPP :

Presumably it would com® from third

parties associated with the case.

In the vast majority of

cases those people would b© as accessible to the defendant as
they will b© to the government, and often more accessible to
the defendant.

Question:

I don't understand this at all, why the

responsibility is on the person that is about to be indicted
to com® forth and say, “You know, I'm about to be indicted and
I wish you would hurry up.™
MR. RUPP:

Well, again, we are not suggesting that

a defendant put pressure on the government to indict him.

What

the defendent might do is suggest that evidence relevant to his
defense is about to be lost.

And, again, that evidence can

coma from third partias and it's going to be a rare case in
which the govarnr.^nt engages in such misconduct.
I would like to reserve the balance of my tin®, Mr.
Chief Justice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP LOUIS GILDEN
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT
MR. GILDEN:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it: pleas© the

I do want to clarify a f©w statements the Solicitor has

mad© which I don5t think are born© out in the record.

Judge

R@gan did not decide his cas® under Rule 48, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
H® decided it merely on Fifth Amendment essentials as set forth
in Marion that there was pre-indictment delay and subsequent
prejudice to the defendant.
I might say the government has made all kinds of
arguments about why they didn't win this motion, and that's
what they are confronted with today.

Mr. Justice Marshall, when

they talk about the defendant has to give up all of his evidence
to the government, tell the government what his cas© is going
to b® is sort of silly and nonsens©.

It is contrary to law.

When'the defendant cam® in with his witnesses to the trial court
in' th@ pretrial motion, he; presented his evidence that two
of his witnesses had died.

I know nothing in any kind of law

in this country that says that the defendant has to signal his
testimony to the government about what his evidence is going
to bs.

And the government at no time asked for a delay.

They

didn't ask for a continuance to check out the veracity of the
defendant's statement to the court.

They never said, "We don't
v

believe this man, that these two witnesses died, and therefor©
we want to check it out and see whether or not they would support

22

your statement that, would exculpate you in the commission of
this crime of stolen mail matter.”
I might say the government runs all over the turf
hare with respect to all kinds of allegations.

doing —

MR. GILDEN:
QUESTION:

Why should they say anything?
Well, they have some obligation to the —
Under what authority?
Let me say this —■
Under what authority?
Under the Marion case.
And precisely what language in Marion

do you rely on for them to have any duty to speak?
MR. GILDEN:

The pre-accusation delay, 17, 18 months,

the substance of material actual prejudice that this Court
has stated would be a Fifth Amendment violation in Marion.
I might say, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that in Marion
there was no evidence of the government delaying deliberately
to get a tactical advantage over the defendant.

There was

governmental negligence.
QUESTION;

But the indictment wasn't dismissed in

Marion either.
MR. GILDEN:

Well, it was sent back by this Court to

23

see whether the defendant could prove actual prejudice.

That's

all.
QUESTION:

And wasn't there also language in Marion

that talked about tactical advantage to the government?
MR. GILDEN:

All they said was we understand that

the government concedes to that.
QUESTION:

That's all this Court said.

Unless the defendant comes in on his motion,

and presumably he has the burden of proof on a motion like that,
and makes a prima facie case that th© Marion requirements are
there, why is the burden on th© government to go forward and
do anything?
MR. GILDEN:
burden.

We didn't say the government had any

We assumed th© burden at the motion.

didn't do anything.

Th© government

The government talks about all the bad

tilings that are going to happen to them in the event this
Court decides that the indictment should b® dismissed.

It's

going to interfere with their investigation of crimes, and
society, and the defendant.

Everybody is going —• the whole

administration of justice is going to collapse.

All they had

to do, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, was com© in and say, "We moved
our finger from A to B."
QUESTION:

They didn’t say that.

But your position,

if : my understanding

of Marion is correct, if th© case you made out on your burden
of proof satisfied all th© elements of Marion, bur if any of
those elements

were left in dispute, then the government could

24

stand mutas and quite conceivably properly win the motion.
flR. GILDEN:

I ara saying that my reading of Marion

is certainly different than the Solicitor8s reading of Marion»
And iuay^e I ■— I read Marion, and it says very definitely,
if the defendant can go back to trial and can at the trial
prove actual prejudice, than he should win his case on the
motion to dismiss the indictment.
QUESTION:

And you say that proof that a witness had

died without proof as to what that witness would testify is
a. proof of actual prejudice?
MR. GILDEN:

Well, 1st me say this, Mr. Justice

Rahnquist-, that the government never appealed the essential
finding that Tom Stewart would have testified that Lovasco did
not know the guns were stolen at the time that he supplied the
guns to Lovasco.
riow, that is essential testimony under an 18 U.S.C. 1708,
tiie knowledge that I knew these guns were stolen, that’s
essential testimony.
*

It's the bars guts of a defense to that

kind of a case.

And I might say 'that that is a finding of idle

Eighth Circuit.

The government hasn't appealed that material

prejudice that the defendant has suffered as a result of this
delay to this Court.

That's a finding this Court has to

accept.
QUESTION:

How much delay does there have to be before

a defendant is entitled to dismissal on the basis of actual

25

prejudice?
MR. GILDEN:

I wouldn't want to set up any standards

on that.
QUESTION:
prejudice.

In other words, there can be great

Let's assume an alleged bank robbery on one day

and the key witness for the defendants whose defense is an
alibi, let's say, dies the day after the robbery.

That's

^errible prejudice, and that's caused by delay, by delay in
the fact the indictment wasn't brought on the afternoon of the
robbery.
MR. GILDEN;
I might say that

That would b® an extreme situation.

this Court —

QUESTION:

Generally delays -- Congress has set

statutes of limitations which ar© presumptively the period
daring which an indictment need be returned.
MR. GILDEN;

Is that correct?

This Court in Marion said that doesn't;

set up all the standards with respect to

where there is a

constitutional right involved, and this Court specifically
stated that when th© Fifth Amendment due process question is
involved, pre-accusation delays, that's a matter that can be
assarted and the courts will listen to it.
QUESTION:
MR. GILDEN:

How much delay?
I'm not going to say how much delay.

But I believe this Court could say reasonable delay based on —
QUESTION:

Reasonable is presumably the statute of

26

limitation, isn’t it?
MR. GILDSN:

No, I don't think so, not when there

is a question of prejudice to the defendant.

I think, beised —

this Court doesn't really have to deal with the amount of
time.

And I might say that in Dickey —
QUESTION:

It certainly does.

MR. GXLDEN:

In Dickey and in Marion and in Barker,

the Court didn't set out of the amendments that this is
particularly -the situation of Barker v. Mingo, Justice Powell
didn't say that we are going to say that, all these things have
to be proved in order to show a Sixth Amendment violation of
the Constitution.

It said these are the things we should

consider and the trial court should be given certain latitude
to make these decisions based upon what he finds, based upon
the facts in front of him.

And I feel that in this kind of a

situation where Lovasco kepi: calling the government, Mr.
Justice Marshall, and saying — he says, "I want to be indicted,
do something, let ms know if I am innocent or I am going to be
indicted.”

He did it.

So even though criminals or defendants

are not called upon to ask that question, in this c&s© Lovasco
kept calling the inspector and saying, "What are you going to
do with me?
do?

I gav© you a statement, what are you going to

I'm concerned about what's going to happen to me."

And

at no time did the government, come back and do anything about
it.

In fact

27

QUESTION:

Don8t you think, that if he did that raora

than one© or twice , that, th© prosecutor would have said, "There
--s something going on around hare, we better look into it,"
because that doesn’t happen every day.
MR. GILDEN:
QUESTION:

I would think so.
And wouldn'i th© prosecutor say,

"W© have

got to take another look at this"?
MR. GILDEN:

I would think so.

They didn’t do

anything.
QUESTION:

That’s what they did, they took another

look.
MR. GILDEN:

Seventeen months later they took another

look.
QUESTION:

MR. GILDEN:

When did he start calling?

l-Is called immediately, right after his

statement to the government.

He cam® in and gave them a full

statement in front of his attorney.
kept calling.

And I might say -that, hs

He expressed his anxiety.

And let m© say this.

When the government talks

about a stipulation mad© with the defendant’s attorney, that
stipulation was that we had no further evidence in this matter.
The only time he secured some additional evidence was after
th© grand jury had returned their indictment against him.
QUESTION:
MR. GILDEN:

That is "w©" the government.
W© the government.

That’s right.

We had

23

nothing else.

We hadn’t don© anything.

And they stated —

there was no evidence at all to the court

as to what they

had dona for 17 months.
QUESTION:

What is the statute of limitations on

this offense?
MR. GILDEN:

I believe it's a 5-year statute of

limitations.
QUESTION:
MR. GILDEN:

You are quit® £ bit short of the 5 years.
It is.

But let me say that this Court

^as definitely stated, both in Dickey and also in Marion, that
when a constitutional right becomes in some way triggered by
the facts, that, that is something this Court is going to listen
to and decide whether or not this person should ba protected
based upon these intervening constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

Her© you have less than a third of the

time that Congress has said is a reasonable time in which to
bring it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

W® will resum© there at

10 in the morning.
MR. GILDEN:

Thank you,

[Whereupon, at 3 p.m., th® oral argument was recessed,
to reconvene at 10 a.m.,,Tuesday, March 22, 1977.]
