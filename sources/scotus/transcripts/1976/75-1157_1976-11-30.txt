next in Town of LooJcport

we will hear arguments

against Citizens for Community

Action at the Local Level and others.
Mr. Fuzak, you may proceed whenever you8re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR T. FUZAK, ESC!.. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS.
MR. FUZAK:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court.:
This is an appeal from a judgement of a three judge
Dictrict Court sitting for the Western District of New York.
That Court ruled that provisions of the New York State
constitution and of the New York State Municipal Home Rule
Law, relating to the procedures to be followed in connection
with the effectuation of changes in the form or structure of
county governments, were unconstitutional as being in
violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
The provisions in question sat forth the procedures
which are to be followed inthe event that the people of a
particular county

wish to change the form of their

government.
The traditional form of county government in New
York Stats is a legislative form.

That was the form in

Niagra County with which this case is concerned.

4
The constitutional and statutory provisions provide
as follows: if the citizens wish to change the form of their
government in any respect, or to transfer functions of
government between towns, villages or the county, they can
only do so if the county

legislature adopts a local law

presenting those changes or providing for those changes.
Then that local law must ba nut to referendum of the citizens
of the county as a whole.

And then in order to have the local

law taka effect and becoma the lav/ of the county, that local
1

law must obtain the majorityof the vote cast hy the voters
residing in the cities of the county, and it also must obtain
the majority of the votes cast by the voters residing in the
towns of the county, both taken as separate units.
And whether or not a' particular proposal obtains
a majority of all the votes in the county, taken as a sinale
unit, is not determinative of the issue.
The District Court held, in this case, that those
provisions violated the equal protection clause in view of
the fact that they denied the citizens of the county the
rights of the one person, one vote doctrine.
I might recite very briefly,

if I mav, the facts

of the case, to put the matter into perspective.

In 1972 the

ITiagra County Legislature adapted a proposed local law which
would effectuate a new charter form of government for the
IJiagra County residents.

5
That new charter form of government would have
changed the county form of government from a legislative
form to a combined executive and legislative fom.

It would

have created the new positions, elected positions, of
county executive and other subsidiary county officials.
It adopted that local law, and it put the local law
to referendum in November of 1972.
voters of the

At that referendum, the

towns, residing inthe

towns of the county,

did not approve the proposed changes by a majority.

^hey

disapproved of those changes.
The voters who resided in the cities of the county,
on the other hand, by a majority approved the proposed changes.

QUESTION:
HE. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Hr. Fuzak?

.

r'

Yes, sir.
In Hew York, are towns simply geographical

areas, or are they small cities?
HR. FUZAK:

Well, they're not small cities.

They

have different functions and they have different powers.
But they do have internal government structures.
will have a supervisor, the town will

The town

have a town board.

%
much like a city would have a mayor and a city council and

that type of things.
QUESTION:

But the whole state isn’t divided into

towns, then, the way some Hew England, states are?
HR. FUZAK:

Yes, I think in point of fact, it is.

And

The whole state is divided initially — the major superstructure
is the county.

And then from there you go to the city and

the town, which have different rights and powers and so on.
And inclusive inthe towns very frequently are villages, which
was the case here as well.
QUESTIO?!:

But does the county — here what was

involved was a new county charter?
MR. FU7,AK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice.
Now, would the provisions of the county

charter be equally applicable throughout the county?
MR. FUZAK:

Yes, sir, that's right.

QUESTION:

N7ith respect to everybody, that's right

HR. FUZAK:

Yes, sir, that's right.

QUESTIO?!:
MR. FUZAK:

Inside towns and outside towns?
Inside towns, inside cities, everyone

residing within that county would —
QUESTIONj

Are subject

to . everything that’s in

the charter?
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Precisely right, yes, sir.
How many towns are there, do you think,

in this County?
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Twelve.
And how many cities?
Three.
I gather that the aggregate — in other

7
words, it must be a majority of the aggregates of city
people and the aggregate of county voters.
HR. FUJSAK:
QUESTION:
HR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Each taken as separate units.
Yes.
That's correct.
And there was a majority of the

aggregate city but not of the aggregate county?
HR. FU7.AK:
QUESTION:

Correct, and there was a majority —
Even though there may be 12 towns, and

maybe 9 of them, the majority there may have voted in favor,
but the total was not a majority in favor.
MR. FUZAK:
conceivable.

That's correct.

Chat you suggest is

I don't exactly know how the votS.ng went, but

that is correct.
What happened in the ID72 referendum wets, that if
you took all the votes and put them into one basket, there was
a majority in favor of the adoption of this new county charter.
The proportion was 52$ to 40%.

They did it on that basis.

But they did not get the complementary votes that are required
by the constitution and by the municipal home rule law.
QUESTION:

And the county is either city or town,

there's nothing — no part of the county that's neither city
or 'town, is that correct?
MR. FUZAK:

The county — that's correct, sir.

And

included in the towns, there will be villages, and there are

0
villages.
QUESTIO?!:

Well, the town is what we call a township,

I guess.
MR. FUZAK:

Yes, sir, that’s correct, sir.

So as a consequence of that failure to obtain
approval, the County of Niagara commenced a suit in the Histrici:
Court, seeking a declaration by the District Court that those
provisions of the state constitution and the municipal home
rule law were indeed unconstitutional on these grounds, that
they denied the one person, one vote rule under the equal
protection clause.
The County of Niagara purported to bring that suit
on behalf of all of its citizens within the county.

The

defendant in that suit was the state of New York.
The District Court found that there was no substantial
federal question, refused to empanel a three judge court, and
dismissed the complaint.
That judgement became final.
Thereafter, these individualvdefendants in this
action, which the Citizens for Community Action at the Local.
Level, the acronym for which is CALL, began this action,
seeking precisely the same declaration of unconstitutionality
and precisely the . ame relief,

And that case proceeded, now

naming the County of Miagra as a defendant, or those officials
of the County who had officials acts to do in connection with

the certification of this proposed charter,, and also the
officials of the State of Hew York, who also had to do things
to make the proposed charter

the local law of the county.

There were no hearings in that proceeding, no proof
was adduced.

Instead, cross motions

were made for summary

j udgement.
QUESTION:

This wasn51 a three judge court, was it?

HR. FUZAK:

Now, a three judge court was empaneled

in this instance, yes sir.

And cross motions for summary

judgement were made.
QUESTION:

Was there any reference in the course

of, apparently, three judge court, of the previous action in
which a single judge had not even found it substantial enough
to ask for the conventional three judge court?
MR. FUZAK:

Yes, sir.

There was no particular reference in anything

that I'm aware of in connection with the empanelling of the
three judge court to that previous determination.
QUESTION:

Of course that would be part of the

The single judge found it so insubstantial

as not to even warrant a request for the conventional three
judge court.
MR. FUZAK:

Right, sir.

10

So a three judge court was empaneled, and these
cross motions for summary judgement were made.

Wo proof was

adduced,' and no testimony was taken.
QUESTION:
MR. FUZAK:

Affidavits?
Some affidavits, your honor.

The moving

papers on both motions, I think, would have to be characterized
as extraordinarily spare under the circumstances.

There was

no -- incisive review of the reasons for the passage of the
constitutional provisions or anything of that nature in those
papers.
While the court was considering those motions for
summary judgement, the county legislature went ahead and
adopted a new charter, or attempted to draft a new charter,
in 1974.

And before the decision on this case, the summary

j udgement motions.
In November of 1974, the County Legislature put a
new charter and a different charter up for referendum to the
voters of the County, which by its own terms, would supersede
any previous charter or any previous form of government for
the county.

And that was put to referendum in the same fashion.

QUESTION:

And the form of that government, did that

differ from the '72 proposal?
MR. FUZAK:

It differed in certain respects, your

honor, but not materially.

There were some changes in it,

I think made in order to accomodate some objections by people

11
in the towns, that kind of thing»
QUESTION:

But basically it would have been an

executive —
MR. FUZAK:

Correct? sir.

Correct.

And essentially

the same result, and almost by the same percentages or
proportions.

Again, there was about a 52% total in favor, if

you took all of the citizens and put them into one basket, and
48% opposed.

But the citizens of the towns again rejected

the proposed changes in their form of government,

the form of

county government.
QUESTION:

Are the differences relevant to this

decision in this case at ail?
MR. FUZAK:
are, your honor.

No, I don’t think we can say that they

There are some different positions involved

in the two charters, but I think for all intents and purposes
we ought to regard them here as being equivalent in their
scope and in their application and function.
QUESTION:
MR. FUZAK:

That is, of the two charters?
That’s right, sir.

That’s right.

After the November, 1972
QUESTION:

An.fi of the two votes, regardless of the

percentages or the precise numbers, the same — factually, the
two votes are identical?
MR. FUZAK:

The same result.

Exactly right, sir.

The voters of the town did not give it majority approval,

12
the voters of the city did,
QUESTION:
MR. FUZAK:

And there was an overall majority?
There was an overall majority.

And again, in that situation, the question came
as to whether that charter could be implemented. And application
a

was made, the decision of the Court on the first charter, the
1972 charter, came dovm shortly after the 1974 referendum
with respect to the 1974 charter.

^haNiaqara

County people

made an application to the Court to have its judgement
applied not to the 1972 charter, which was the subject matter
of the previous action or of the existing action, but to have
it apply instead to the 1974 charter.
The Court refused to do that, apparently on the
grounds that it did not have jurisdiction over the '74 charter,
which was not a subject of the lawsuit.
So a judgement was entered in 1979 declaring the
1972 charter to be the law of the land on the grounds that the
New York State constitution was unconstitutional and the
municipal home rule lav/ was unconstitutional, and that
since, in spite of the fact that there we re no statutory
provisions to support this kind of approach, that since
there had been an overall majority, that therefore these
changes that were proposed could take effect.

And so the

January, 1975 judgement said the 1972 charter is the law of
the land.

13

The Attorney General hao indicated that he was
going to appeal fronthat judgement.

Shortly before the time

to appeal expired, he made an announcement that he was not
going to carry forward the appeal, and so the town of Locknort
supported by the ocher towns of the countv, made an appli­
cation for intervention which was granted for the purpose
of prosecuting this appeal, and that's why we're here today.
After that, after the appeal was filed, the
state and county officials purported to put into effect the
1974 chartei*, and not the 1972 charter as was provided in
the original judgement and order of the court.

Ge raised

questions of mootness on the grounds that the subject matter
of the original action had been destroyed by the subsequentconduct
of the parties litigant.

That matter was up before the

Court on our original jurisdictional statement,
was remanded to the District Court.

'“‘he case

The original judgement
/

was vacated.

The case was remanded to the District Court for

further proceedings in light of the 1974 charter referendum.
And another proceeding was had — again, no proof —
but counsel were summoned to the District Court.
Court found that there was no mootness.
2*6

The District

,T1he District Court

denied an application by the CALL of plaintiffs here.

They had

made an application.to make sure that the case did in fact
have jurisdiction over the 1974 charter, to amend their
complaint so as to raise the questions of constitutionality

14

as to the ’74 charter? which would have been fine? we would
have had a trial and we

could have gone through the whole

thing»
But that was denied as well? and the Court found
no mootness.
QUESTION:
MR. FUZAN:

Leave to amend was denied?
That’s right, sir.

The Court found, in

•effect, that it was empowered to make its previous judgement,
w hich related to the '72 charter? applied to the '74 charter.
QUESmION:
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:
MR. FUZAK:

And did it?
It did do so? sir.
Entered a new judgement? did it?
It entered a new judgement in October —

in December of 1975.
QUESTION:

So there’s no mootness problem in this

case now?
MR. FU7AK:

Well, we claim there is a mootness
i

problem, and we raisethat on this appeal.
QUESTION:

Even with .respect — even after the

QUESTION:

And then after the change of the judgemem

remand?

MR. F177AK:

Yes, sir.

Because we —■ oxir position

on that is, that prior to that happening, the actions of
these parties litigant in fact destroyed the subject matter of
the original lawsuit, which was the ’72 charter.

The '74

charter was never considerer?, in the lawsuit at all.

The

record had been closed, and the natter had gone to appeal —
QUESTIO!!:

But the Court has now — so you must say

the Court was in error in having its judgement apply to the
1 74?
MR. FU7.AK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I do.
As long as you accept that, it's not

moot.
MR. FU7AK:
QUESTION:

No.
Well, at the most, you could claim that

the court did follow procedures that were unusual, if not
irregular.
MR. FTTZAIC:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I do.
But they did —- we do have a decision

before us affecting the 1974 charter.
MR. FU7AK:
QUESTION:
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Exactlv right, sir.
Which is the existing charter.
That's right.
Well, isn’t your complaint with respect

to that really that the New York officials, without any
federal court order, had already put into effect the 1974
charter?
MR. FUZAIC:
OUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And therefore there was no need to

litigate with respect to that, since the plaintiffs had already

16
obtained what they wanted, putting that charter into effect.
HR. FUZAK:

Yes, sir.

That pxit us in a very

peculiar position because —

v
QUESTION:
HR. FUZAK:

I can imagine.
— we then had to take some action to

protect our rights with respect to the '74 charter, and that's
why ve were required to start an action in state court, under
Article 78 of our Civil Practice Law —
QUESTION:

I suppose you would have some relief if

we reversed the District Court?
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, we certainly would.
You're saying, there's simply no predicate

for the order relating to the 1^74 charter.
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that's what I'm saying.
There's nothing.

Therefore, it's an

utterly improper order.
HR. FUZAK:

Correct, sir.

What happened, in

point of fact, was, that when the matter was remanded to the
Court, the Court on its own motion brought in the 1974
charter and made it an exhibit in the proceeding and so on,
and then proceeded from that standpoint to include it in the
case, and to act on the

'74 charter, amend the original

judgement to make it apply to the
QUESTION:
ment .

'74 charter.

On the reasoning of its oriainal judge­

17

HR. PU7AK:

Correct, sir.

Exactly on the

sane

reasoning.
QUESTION:

\

And you’ve already conceded the two

charters are — for this — purposes of this case, are
identical?
HR. FU8AK:

Essentially — quite riaht, Hr. Justice.

The issue here, as we see it, is whether or not the
equal protection clause — among these issues — there are
issues of nootness and there are other issues concerning the
relief that was granted by the Court, but I would like to
address myself principally to the consitutional miestion of
whether or not the equal protection clause can require or
dees require a state to afford its citizens the ricyht to
determine by an election process compatible with the one
person, one vote concept or doctrine, the form or structure
of subordinate government instrumentalities within the state.
And the appellants' position is, that the state is
not required to do that by any provision of the constitution,
and that the intervention of the federal judiciary in this
instance would be improper and was improper.

And we say

that for this reason: because what is at stake here is very
clearly and purely state action within the proper sphere
of state action, that is, the establishment, the modificationr
the repeal, the amendment, the abolishment of the state’s

own internal government structure.
QUESTION:

So you think that you could provide that

in a referendum on an amendment of a county charter that the
people in the town get two votes and the people outside the
town get one vote?
MR. FUZAK:

I think there are , as there are in all

these cases, there are points that you reach where the
situation is so apparently irrational that it calls for and
would require and would merit some judicial intervention.
I do.

not think, however, that the automatic

application of the one person, one vote doctrine is proper
in any sense.
QUESTION:

And you would say that — suppose the

county charter provided for the maximum mill levy.
pose that.

Just sup­

And there was a proposal that was subject to

referendum that the mill levy

would be raised. And you would

say this provision in New York, the way it is, would be proper,
namely, thatthe people inthe cities — people in the towns
would have to have a majority in order to approve the —
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Evan though the provision ape lie cl to

everybody equally?
MR. FUZAK:

Yes, sir, I would, for this reason:

because unlike the other cases x^here this Court hasa>plied
the one person, one vote doctrine, this case deals istrictly and
solely and purely with a question of the establishment or

19

change of the structure or form of internal state government.
The other esses, as you all recall, of course,
dealt with questions of representation, whether or not someone
was being deprive of his

Just awhile ago you answered me and

even apply to a mill levy change.

THat isn't

a structure.
HR. FUZAK:
is a different thing.

Yes.
I’m sorry, I misunderstood you.

No, that’s a different thing.

Well, I’m sorry your honor.

That

Because —

You would think that everybody would

have to have an equal chance at defeating that law.
MR. FUZAK:

No, that would not be an appropriate

part of the charter, that would not be an appropriate thing
for the local lav; to
government.

That would be an action that would have to be

taken by the appropriate representatives
after it was formed.
QUESTION:

I don’t —
Well, some charters set maximum

I hate to tell you, but they do.
MR. FUZAK:

Well, that is not in this case.

is not an issue in this case.

And the only — what is

That

20

involved here —
QUESTION:

All you’re talking about is the structure,

then, of the —MR. FUZAK:

Exactly right.

And that’s all that was

done in this case, and as a matter of fact, that’s all that
the constitution or the municipal home rule allows the counties
\

to do is change their structures in accordance with this
complementary majority vote rule.

So I don't think we can

get involved in the kind of problem you raise, Mr. Justice
White.
QUESTION:

So the kinds of things that the New York

law permits to be done are those that the Court was talking
about in Hunter against Pittsburgh?
MR. FUZAK:

Yes, sir, that's right.

This case in

no way involves any claim by anyone ~~ nor can it — that
anyone is being deprived of an equal vote in terms of the
selection of governmental representatives.

Because whether

there is a county charter, or whether there is not a county
charter, there is an appropriately constitutional republican
form of government for the county.

And there is no claim here

of any discrimination in that sense.
And of course most of the cases that the Court has
applied the one person, one vote rule to, involve exactly that
point.

There's a matter of representation, the matter of

apportionment, districting, and that type of thing.

21
This case does not involve that.
QUESTION:

Do you feel that Gordon against Lance

gives you any support?
MR. FU52AK:

Yes, sir, I very definitely do, because

I think the Court there found that it was within the political
practice, political judgement, in effect, of the state, to
make a determination that instead of having a simple
majority to approve additional municipal bond indebtedness,
there should be a requirement of a 60% majority.
Court said that was perfectly all right.

And the

Because in certain

circumstances and situations the one person, one vote rule
does not apply.
And I think that's very clear from the development
of the cases, because the Court has refused to haive an
automatic application of that rule.

And that's exactly

what happened in this case, I'm afraid.

Because I'm afraid

the District Court in rendering its judgement made an assumption
thatthere was an automatic application of the one person, one
vote doctrine.
And I take issue with that because I don't think
that's an appropriate assumption.

I don't think, it's

appropriate constitutionally, and I don't think it's
appropriate on the basis of the cases- that this Court has
decided in which the Court has refused to apply it, like
Wells versus Edwards when you're talking about the election

22

of the judiciary and things of that nature.
QUESTION:

Originally — that doctrine originally

arose, of course, in terms of what’s called representative
democracy in the legislative area.

And then it was expanded

to include what?
MR. FUZAK:

.
It was expanded to some extend to

include elections involving the incurring of public debt,
largely.
QUESTION :
MR. FUZAK:

Kolodziejski against Phoenix?
Phoenix, City of Phoenix versus

Kelodziejski, the city of Cipriana versus City of Hooma,
and that line of cases.
QUESTION:
MR. FUZAK:

And then also in that school, district.
The Kramer against the Union Free School

District where there was an election of a representative —
State of New

York — but where there was an election of a

representative board.

And again, I think the overtones there

were that the board that was being elected was fulfilling
the functions of representatives of the people, and that -I think it clearly fell within the Avery line of cases, Reynolds
versus Sims, Baker-Carr, and so on.
QUESTION:

And of course Avery involved a town.

MR. FUZAK:

Yes, sir.

Now that went pretty far away from

legislative apportionment, didn't, it?
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:
MR. FUZAK:

The Hadley case?
Yes.
Well, it did to an extent, your honor.

And so do, in fact, the cases where the one person, one vote
principle has been applied when the subject matter of the
elective processes the incurring of public debts.

That is

\

also somewhat removed from the election of representatives,
i

and yet not quite. ^Because they are both exercises of
governmental functions after the —
QUESTION:

Rather than the structure of the

governmental entity itself.
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Quite right.
Hadley and Cramer were both elections

to representative bodies, albeit of lesser stature than
state legislatures.
MR. FUZAK:

Yes, sir, that’s correct.

has found —

Your whole point, as I understand it,

is simply that ws do not have here anything that smacks in the
slightest of a choice of representatives,

QUESTION:

That5s correct.
This is just whether or not the county

may or may not have a particular structure of government.
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

That is right.
And whether it

can say, even though

there is a majority overall, if there8s not a majority of the
aggregate of the voters of the townships, than the county may
not have that new form..
MR. FUZAK:

Whether the state has that sovereign

authority to do that in terms of setting up its own form
of government -QUESTION:

Well, apart from that.

The whole theory,

as I understand it, of Reynolds and Sims and that whole line
of cases simply is inapplicable.
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Exactly right, sir.
And is it clear, may I ask, that the

new charter or charters affect the towns quite differently
from the way they affect the cities?
MR. FUZAK:

I don't think that's exactly the case.

1 think as a practical matter, that's true, because of the
difference in the authorities which are granted by state law

2 ‘5

to the towns and the cities»
when

I think as a practical matter

you superimpose an executive branch onto a county

government, the normal result is that the executive branch
assumes powers and does things that might normally not have
been done by the legislative branch when it was acting
in another fashion.
QUESTION:
MR. FUZAK:

At all.
No.

There is no — Mr. Justice Stevens,

to answer your, question, there is no transfer of functions
as between any of the subsidiary forms of government involved
in this particular charter.

But the difficulty is that the

holding of unconstitutionality is indiscriminate.

It holds

the entire provision of the state constitution, and the
entire section of the municipal home rule unconstitutional.
And that means as well the complementary majority requirement
if you are, in fact, going to transfer functions from the
town to the village or from the village to the town, or the
county to the town, and so on, which is, of course, a matter
of real substance and real importance.
QUESTION:

But in this case, that fact — it was

not present?
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION;
this, in this case?
MR. FUZAK:

That fact was not *— is not —
So there * s no real rationale behind
Is that it?
Behind what, sir?

‘ v..

26
QUESTION;

Behind requiring a majority of both the

town and the majority of the cities separately.
HR. FUZAK:

No, I think there's a rationale behind

it, your honor.
QUESTION;
MR. FUZAK:

What is it?
The rationale is, that I think people

have, in different areas of a particular county, have different
interests and different requirements in terms of their
county government.
it exists today,

And I think that the county government as

>or as it existed before they put this

charter into effect, was a functioning county government with
proper representation of all the people involved, nothing
wrong with it whatsoever.

And now you impose an entire new

superstructure of an executive branch on it, the natural,
normal result is an extension of the powers of the county,
an extension of the exercise of the powers of the county, and
an intrusion in to the exercise of powers by the —
QUESTION;

Even though, under the new county charter,

as you said earlier in your argument, the provisions will apply
equally to everyone?
MR. FUZAK;
QUESTION;

They apply equally to —
I mean, everyone is subject to them to

the same extent?
MR. FUZAK;

That9s right.

Except insofar as cities

and towns do have, by state law —■ general state law —

27
somewhat different authorities and powers.
QUESTION:

Well, is it possible that if this is a

valid system, that the cities might override township
interests because of the kind of representation they get in
county government?
MR. FUZAK:

Yes, in point of fact what we have here

in Niagra County, the situation is that there happen to be
some more residents in the three cities than there are in the
towns of the counties.

But that is not true in 53 of the

other 57 counties of the state that are covered by these
provisions.

In those 53 counties, the opposite is true.

There are more people living in the towns than are living
inthe cities, and if there is this claimed discrimination,
it rests in favor of the city dweller rather than the
town dweller.
I think the reason we can't get into it very deeply
is because there’s no record on it, frankly.

But I think the

reason this was adopted by the people, as part of their
constitution, was, to afford some kind of detente
thedifferent kinds of people.

between

And we saw that in the Dusch

case and some others that this Court has handled.
QUESTION:

Do town functions — what are town

functions in New York?

Is there any law enforcement function?

Do you have JP.’s that are elected on a township basis?
MR. FUZAK:

Yes, sir, yes, sir.

They have JP’s,

2a
they have a town hoard, they have a supervisor -QUESTION:

Do they have constables?

MR. FUZAK:

They have constables,, they have — they

have general governmental functions.
QUESTION:

Now, is it possible that if a county

developed an executive — what, do you have a sheriff?

Is

he the basic county law enforcement?
MR. FUZAK:

There is a county sheriff, that's

correct.
QUESTION:

Now, if the sheriff’s department expands

a great deal, might the need or use of the town constable
be diminished?
MR. FUZAK:

Exactly right.

And the same would be

true in other areas of services to people as well.

QUESTION: Then you might (inaudible) county constabulary
MR. FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Yes, yes.
So it is possible that the status quo

might be more greatly altered with -respect to the towns than
with respect to the cities?
MR. FUZAK:
practical matter.

Yes, I think that’s correct sir as a

I think that is correct as a practical

matter.
The other aspect of the matter, of course, that
provides great concern to the towns is, that if this provision
is ruled unconstitutional, as the District Court has done —

29
and I say indiscriminately —- it would mean, under the
District Court's ruling, that if a simply majority of the
people in the county wanted, to effect changes in the county
structure to transfer functions fromthe cities to the towns,
or fromthe counties to the towns, or vice versa, that could be
done, and the townspeople would not have the separate,
independent voice that they have in questions involving
annexation or things of that nature, which have found to have
been perfectly proper and appropriate,
QUESTION:

Are your school districts in Hew York

entirely separate fromthe towns and cities?
MR, FUZAK:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
They're not coincidental in boundary or

anything?
MR. FUZAK:

No, they are not.

The cities have their

own school systems, the towns are often included in union
free school districts, a number of them in one district, that
type of thing.

But there is a separation as between the

cities and the towns.
QUESTION:

I was going to inquire whether the re could

be any adverse tax consequences to the residences of the
towns?

Could the counties impose taxes on people who reside

in the towns that cannot be imposed, at present?
MR. FUZAK:

No, I don't believe that's true,

I

think that the power of taxation is the same in either event.

QUESTION:
MR. PUZ7UC:

Right.
Essentially, whether it * s the legislative

form or the executive form that we have under consideration
here.
