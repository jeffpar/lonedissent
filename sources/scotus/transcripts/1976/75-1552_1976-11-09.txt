P R O C S E DINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hoar arguments

next in 7 5-1552, Castaneda v. Parfcida.
Mr. Beery, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS PARKER BEERY, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, BEERY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
I represent the petitioner herein, Sheriff Claudio
Castaneda, of Hidalgo County, Texas.

In March of 1972, State

District Judge Jos© Alamia, a Mexican-American, residing ovor
the 92nd District Court, of Hidalgo County, Texas, selected
five, persons to serve a3 grand jury commissioners of that term
of court.

Thrsa of those five persons were of Mexic'an-American

or SpanishrAmericaa descant.

Those fiiva commissioners in turn

selected twenty persons to serva as potential grand jurors.
This list of twenty persons is known in Texas as the grand
jury pan©! or list or pool.

The person that summoned thus®

twenty persons to open court to be empaneled later by Judge
Alamia is the petitioner herein, Sheriff Claudio Castaneda.
Ten out of feh© twenty persons chosen by the grand
jury commissioners were Mexican-American; ten were AngloAmerican.

Three

-that were to b*s served by

Sheriff Castaneda could not be located. ‘One was listed on th®
return of the summons as being out of state.

Two Anglo-

4
Amer leans, shorn by fen® record, were excused by -«die court, prior
to the formal ©mpanelment of March 16, 1972.
On March 16, 1972, Judge Manila empaneled the grand
/
jury panel in open court.

On© M©xioan--Am@rican at -that time

was absent fresa the proceedings.

'Thirteen persons showed up.

Five Mexican-Americ&ns had been absent, out of state, or could

not b© found by Sheriff Castaneda*

Two Anglo-*Americans had

already bean excused by the court, leaving 13 persons to b©
empaneled•
Judge Alamia at that time only needing at that time
twelve persons to serve on the grand jury, had afe his option
excusing on© person for some sort of emergency excuse, on© man
by the name of Mr. Faulkner, aa Anglo-American, asked to be
excused because ha feud a business over in McAllen, Texas,
having to do with a drug store? on© Mexican-Amerlcan by the
name of Mr. Calvillo, who seemed to have a more pressing
matter, he had a father who was due for heart surgery in
Houston th© next week? and Judge Alamia, after considering
both excuses excused the Anglo-American, Mr. Faulkner, and
kept Mr. Calvillo on the grand jury.
That grand jury also, Judge Alamia, on that sane day,
on March 16th, appointed a Mexican-Amerlcan as foreman of the
grand jury.

Th© next day, cm March 17th, 1972, that particular

grand jury, consisting of fives M©xican-Am®rleans and seven Anglo
Americans, indicted th© respondent herein for th© offense of

5
burglary of a private residence in the. night with the intent
to commit rape.
QUESTIONs

Mr, Beery, is thar® a fixed sis© for grand

juries in Texas?
MR. BEERY:
QUESTION:

At least twelve, Your Honor.
And is there a minimum number that have to

vote for indictment?
MR. BEERYs
QUESTIONz
figures that

Yes, nine, at least, nine.
Do you accept or do you challenge the

of 79,2 percent?

MR. BEERY:

No, I do not challenge those figures at

all.
QUESTION:

Are you aware that they ar© totally incon­

sistent with what the Bureau of the Census has in its files and
records?
MR. BEERY:

I was relying on the exhibits that were

introduced by -she res perdent back in 197 3 in the motion for a
new trial.
QUESTION:

And you didn't undertake to test those by

finding out what th© Bureau of Census had to say about it?
MR. BEERY:

Not at that time. Your Honor, to be

honest with the Court, along those regards.

The reason I did

not is that there was such a clear waiver in this case of
challenging the grand jury that indicted the respondent that I
did net feel it was necessary to even contest anything at. the

6
motion for a new trial.
QUESTION:

On tiie waiver point, what do you do with

Francis v. Handerson?
MR, BEERY:
QUESTION:

Excuso me, Your Honor, I didn’t hoar?
Th® case of Francis v. Henderson.

MR. BEERY:

if believe that if we follow that case, I
V

believe it applies vary directly to this situation.
QUESTION:

Th© trouble is, your star® appellate

courts that considar th© merits as pointed out by 'th® Court
of Appeals, the federal Court of Appeals.
MR. BEERY:

It is very unfortunate that they did so.

I have devoted over half of my brief to the waiver issue to the,
Court of Criminal Appeals,

There was a case exactly on point

by the naans of Valdez v. State, found in 408 Southwestern 2d,
page 209, that took car© of the situation.

I have no excuse

for th© Court of Criminal Appeals not getting to th© waiver
situation before that,
QUESTION:

"fell, you started on the merits.

Didn't

the judge testify on th© merits?
MR. BEERY:
QUESTI OH:
MR. BEERY:

Judge Alamia testified —
In th© Federal district, Court.
— in th© federal habeas corpus baror©

Judge Garaa.
QUESTION:

By th© way, why didn’t th© commissioners

testify, any reason'at all?

7
MR. BEERY;

I can’t explain that.

I personally did

not handle that particular hearing, Your Honor.
questions

Well, how can we ever find the state's

reasons for this if we don’t have them to testify?
MR. BEERY;

I understand that it probably should h&v«&

been done but was not.
QUESTION;

Wall, isn’t that a failure for the stats

MR. BEERY?

It is a failure, but x do not believe

of Texas?

that the —
QUESTION:
MR.

beerys

«ted w® can’t remedy it., can w©?
1 believe that there are ether facts and

figures —
QUESTION;
MR. BEERY:

Can. V7® surmise as to the reason?
I believe, that there are other facts and

figures within the record that, tend to explain the disparity
shown by the respondent.
QUESTION;
MR. BEERY:

what, facts?
Wall, the fact, Your Honor, on page 249

of 4:.hs original transcript introduced by the respondent.

It

is shown that Hidalgo County, Taxas, that there was soma 25,637
males with Spanish surnames ever 25 years car older, some 5,791

completed no school years- whatsoever, representing — I compute
that to be acme 23 percent*
Also on tha. same page 249 of th© original transcript,

8
out of 30,312 females with Spanish surnames, 25 years or older,,
in 1970, who lived in the Hidalgo County area, 7,026 also com­
pleted no school years whatsoever, representing also 23 per­
cent.

Now, some of those perhaps could have qualified as grand

jurors, but one of the qualifications for being a grand juror
in the State of Tessas is that you b© able to read and writ©
the English language.
QUESTION:

But wouldn’t it have been much better if

the people who picked th© grand jury testified that "we did not.
discriminata at all," wouldn’t that have bean helpful, wouldn't
it have looked good in th© record?
MR. BEERYs
QUESTION:

Oh, yes, it would have looked —
Well, I assume that th© reason it is not

in tha record is because it wouldn’t be their testimony.
MR. BEERY:
QUESTION:
MR, BEERY:

No, not at all, Your Honor.
Wall, why wasn't it in the record?
Again, Your Honor,

I did not handle that

particular hearing so' I cannot explain to the Court why it was
not dene.
QUESTION:

You said you were standing on the waiver

proposition.
MR. BEERY:
QUESTION:
MR. BEERY:

That was at th® motion for new trial.
That was in the state court system?
The state court system, prior to the writ,

of habeas corpus hearing with Judge Garza’s court.

At that

9

particular time, I was with th® District Attorneys office but
left for & short while and then came back and did not handle
the habeas corpus hearing over in Brownsville, in front of
Judge Garza.
QUESTION:

Do you have any Supreme Court eas©s to

back you up on the waiver point?
MR. BEERY;
QUESTION;

On th® waiver point?
Yes.

You only cited three Supreraa Court

cases in your brief, all in ones paragraph.
MR. BEERY;

Well, the recent case of Francis v.

Henderson cam© out in May, that 1 was unaware of.
QUESTION;

Do you think that helps you?

MR. BEERY;

I believe so, Your Honor.

It is a case

where thare was a waiver in the state court, although wa have
the problem in -this Court, in this particular case, that the
state court jumped over th® waiver issue and went into the
marita of th® situation, which was unfortunate.
QUESTION:
MR. BEERY;

Where did you cite Francis in year brief?
I do not cite Francis, Your Honor, in

that brief.
QUESTION;

Wall, you can speak about what th® other

guy or lawyer did who tried the; case, but you did this brief,
didn't you?
MR. BEERY;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir, I did.
Well, do you rely on Francis now?

10
MR. BEERY s

1 want to rely on it, Year Honorbut 2

did not include it in my brief because, quit® frankly, I was
unaware of it at that particular time.
QUESTION:

It would have baan on® thing- if the Texas

s.

Appellat© Courts have relied on the waiver, then Francis v.
Henderson would say that the federal habeas corpus court would
have to also.

But her© you can’t rely on Francis v, Henderson,,

as I think you understand and told me in answer to a question,
because th© Taxas Appellate Courts did proceed to the merits,
and that was all pointed out by th© Federal Court of Appeals

her©.
MR.

beeryz

Yes, I think it was quite clearly on that

Particu1ar poiat.
QUESTION:

Before you proceed, it seems to have been

held by the Federal District Court that a prima facie case was
shorn and the District Court held that that prima facies case
had been rebutted and the Court of Appeals, without independent
examination as I read its opinion, simply accepted the proposi­
tion that a prima facia case of discrimination had been shown
and differed with the District Court in its holding that that
prima facia case h©d not been rebutted.

Do you accept the

proposition that a prima facie case has been shown?

I ask be­

cause it seams, as I read these statutes of Texas, that jurors
to oven be eligible for consideration must be citizens, and the
prima facie a&;m consisted not in showing th© percentage of

II
citizens but, of showisag the percentage of population —
MR. BEERYs

QUESTION s

That is very true.
— which is something quit© differant,

isn’t it?
MR. BEERYs

That's very true.

Also I believe around

page 266 of the original transcript, th@r® is shown I believe
fch© figure of 00m© 22,000 to 28,000 people in Hidalgo County,
Texas as of 197,0 that war© foreign born.

Now, how many of

those persons were citizens or have become citizens, no on©

knows,
QUESTIONS

S© do you or do you not accept the prop©-"

sitiem that a prims facie case has been shown?
MR. BEERY:

I would accept th© proposition, as Judge

Raynaido Garza didf that a bare prima faci® case
QUESTION?

Well, if jurors, in order to even be

eligible for conside .ration, have to be citizens, how do you
prove a prima facio case by showing th© proportion of residents'?
MR. BEERYs

1

would / leave that to th© respondent to

answer that particular question.
how

any there, are in the county.

I don’t know.

I don’t know

I don’t think anybody knows,

in particular.
QUESTION?

Then why do you -fee 11 ms you accept th©

finding that there was a prima faci© case?
MR. BEERY:

Wall, I think even when w© subtract th©

22,000 to 28,000 persons that are shown by those census figures

12
ia 1370 to ha foreign born, that you still are going to com®
out with a. disparity of com® sort*
QUESTION:
MR. BEERY:

You are.
Th© disparity her© was 30 percent.

Of

course,- there is 80 percent supposedly of the population, or
79*2 percent
QUESTIONs
MR. BEERY %

Population but not census.
Right ~~ not eligible population.

But

even subtracting that 22,000
QUESTION:

why didn’t you put any of what you arguing

in your brief?
MR. BEERY:
QUESTION:

Yca.tr Honor?
Why didn't you put any of what you are

arguing now in your brief?

Why did you save it to spring it ©si

us?
MR. BEERY:

I have no answer far that, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

x nas I have you filed any brief other

than this?
MR. BEERY:

Mo, sir, that is the only brief I filed,

QUESTION:

And you say her© you don't have waiver in

here any place.
MR. BEERY:
QUESTION:
MR. BEERY:

No, Your Honor, I do not.
It is not in there.
No*

I was relying on the federal cases.

I said that ore® the state court has reached the matter,

13
readied the merits and jumped over th® waiver issue, then the
federal courts would be bound by that particular ruling,
QUESTION;

You might bs right about it, but I think

you can put it, in her®, in the brief.

I mean this brief

doesn’t help at® at all, and I guess I will just have t© read
the transcript of this argument.
QUESTION;

And my understanding is you are not rely­

ing on waiver in this Court, are you?
MR. BEERY;

I don't believe that I can rely on waives:

in this Court.
QUESTION;
MR. BEERY;

You can't.
I don't believe I can because the Court

of Criminal Appeals did not ride on the waiver issue, although
they referred —
QUESTION;
MR, BEERY;
QUESTION;
MR, BEERY;

All right.
— war® squarely faced with the issue.
Let’s move on to the merits then,
All right.

Even assuming that a prima

fac.i© case was mad a by the respondent of 30 percent in this
particular case, w® did com© back, the petitioner, in the
hearing on the writ cf hafcsas corpus before Judge Reynaldo
Garza, with th® sworn testimony of Judge Aland®, who did
testify that he did not discriminat® against Mexican-Amsricans
in choosing th© grand jury commissioners.
Also I thirds if we look at the casas cited by th©

14
respondents, ©specially Muniz v. Beto» we can see readily in
those cases that, ©specially fch®

Wmiz

case, over a ten-year

period ©£ time there had Jseen seme ISO grand jury commissioner is
and non© of those had

h®®n

of

fclm

supposed excluded class

Maxican-Amoricans but ware all Anglo-Americans.
Also we would rely on the decision of Judge Garza.,
Reynaldo Garsa, that M@xican-Amerleans, at least in cur county ,
constitute a governing majority, and at the time, in 1972,

Judge Alemia was the only district judge that handled criminal
matters and was the only district, judge that selected commis­
sioners who- in turn selected grand jurors.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Beary, doesn't, that assume that members

of an ethnic group will not discriminate against other members
of an ethnic group?
MR. BEERYs

Yos, that is on© of our assumptions, Your

Honor.
QUESTIONS
MR. BEERY s

Do you think that is a valid assumption,?'

I bail leva so.

I believe it comports with

human experience, at least when they constitute a governing
majority.

It would be reasonable, in my opinion, for Judge

Alnniia and grand jury c ami is s loner s to discriminat® against
other Mexicau-Amerleans.

QUESTIONS

is there any evidence in this record that

supports your governing majority theory?

YiR.

beerys

There is seme evidence, Your Honor.

For

15
example, the population figures of scan® 8 0 parcent is soma
support for that particular proposition,

Also on the amended

hoaring on the motion —* the amended motion for now trial at
the state judge level, i believe it is at page 216 that l ask
the respondent at that time if he knew ©f any Anglo-American
officials in the county, and I believe his answer was no.
Also Judge Alamia at that particular time asked him if he knew
if there was any Anglo-American officials at all in the county,»
and again his answer was no.

And I believe that Judge Alamia

also asked him about the sheriff's department or police
department, if there were any Anglo-Americans on those par­
ticular departments that hs knew of, and he also said no.
r

Also I believe tbs record shows that Ju

'

Alamia,

as an elec tael official, elected state district judge of Texas
at that particular time was the only on© that handled by custom
criminal cases in cur court.
• QUESTION:

Going back now to ray first question, you

think it is not possible in southern Taxas £ci^ a state judge
the commis-s

. ur.s here to practice discrimination in favor

of an Anglo-American minority?
MR. BEERY:

Oh, I believe it is possible, but I

would think in that type of situation perhaps it, ought to be
on the respondent to prove that it was as a result ©f discrim­
ination by Mexiean-Am&ricana against another Mexioan-Axaerlean,
because I just don't believe that that proposition comports

16
with your human experience.
QUESTIONs

WallP I gathered you want us to really

take judicial notice of that fact when you speak of human ex­
perience?
MR. BEERY:
QUESTIONS

Yes.
What is it that you want us to take

judicial notice of?
MR, BEERY:

That Mexican-Americans would not purposely

and intentionally discriminate against other Mexican-Atnor leans
on selection of grand jurors,
QUESTION:

I cannot agree — and I can get you many

a study to show you to the contrary.
MR. BEERY:

I would be perfectly willing to see

those studies, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Wall, I can't take judicial notice of

something that is in dispute.
MR. BEERY:

At least Judge Garza of the United Statas

District Court believed that to be the case, that they would
not, ©specially elected officials, discriminate against the
people who elected them,
QUESTION:

I didn't think you put it on the elected

official point, I thought you put. it on nationality.
MR. BEERY:

Well, the elected official in this case —

QUESTION:

And you say there is not a single Spanish-

speaking person in the country who would do harm to another

17
Spanish-speaking person?
MR* BEERY:
QUESTION*
MR. BEERYs

No , I havan' t said that at all.
Wall, what are you saying?
l am saying the ©l®ct®d officials down

there like Judge Al&xnia would not intentionally discriminate,
purposely discriminate against the people who elected him.
QUESTION*

I didn't think the charge was against fch®

judge, I thought it was against the commissioners.
MR. BEERY *

Wall, as I understand it, it is against

the whole system, and the judge is part ©£ the system because
he appoints the commissioners.
I believe that is all I have at this particular time,
and I might save some for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you very much,
Mr. Hall.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID G, HALL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, HALL;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
Th© single most salient and important, fact in this
case is Hidalgo County itself and th® county's demography.
is 7S.2 percent Mexican “Americans,

It

That is almost 80 percent.

Now, it is true that wa are talking about total population here,
rather than, as some of the cases that have been presented in
this case, have talked about in terms of adult population.
Hons of the cases in this Court that I am aware of

9

18
in response to Mr. Justice Stewart's inquiry to my friend Mr.
Beery, have talked about it in terms of citizens as being the
norm by which we compare.
QUESTION:

Wall, was there any evidence in those

other cases that the state had a requirement of citizenship for
grand jury service?
MR. HALL:

I am not awar© of any state that-doss not

have a requirement of citizenship for jury service.
QUESTION:

Was that discussed in any of the other

MR. HALL:

It has act been discussed in any case,

cases?

either this on® by the ~~ it hasn't been alleged by the state
in this particular cess, and —
QUESTION:

’Soil, if it is a requirement of citizenship,

wouldn't the most logical statistical approach be in terms of
citizens?
MR. HALL:

The question, Your .Honor, it- comes--down to

who boars the burden of proving that, and I think that the
clear impart of the decisions of this Court, and particularly
the Fifth Circuit as well, are to the effect ’that the state
bears that burden as a matter of explanation for the disparity..
If the state: is going to say, well, yes, this 40 percent dis­
parity does exist —*
QUESTION:

But the question is what do you have to

show in osdsr to shift the burden to the state, and what I am

19
saying is wouldn't the most logical type of statistics for
your prima facie case be related to citizenship rather than
just residence?
MR. HALL:

Well, on at least four occasions in this

Court, in Avery v. Georgia —
QUESTION:

Well, you said that non© of those refer to

a requirement of citizenship, have you not?
MR. HALL:

That is correct.

The disparity between

the population and the jury pool is based upon total popula­
tion in Avery, Turner, Carter and Eubanks.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hall, isn't it probable that in each

of those casas the total population and the total number of
citizens were the same, whereas here there is a probability, it
is a border county and there is a probability of a large alien
population?
MR. HALL:

There is a possibility that there is a

larger alien population — a disproportionate alien population*
yes.
QUESTION:

Wall, there is something in the record

that tends to support that, according to your opponent.
MR. HALL:

It tends to —

QUESTION:

It says there are 22,000 to 28*,OOo foreign

born persons,
MR. HALL:

Mr, Justice Stevens, it really comas down

at this point on the basis of the record to pur® speculation.

20
Mid the question throughout on these kinds of issues — wa can
talk about the number of illegal aliens in the population, the
number of legal aliens, felons, illiterates, persons of unsound
mind, thos® persons lacking good moral character, all of those
of which are qualifications for jury service,

ihe question

still comes down to who bears the burden of producing that
information, and on —
QUESTIONS

Do you think the district judge in that

district could take judicial notice of th® fact that there is
a large alien population in a border community?
MR.

hall?

No, I don't believe he could, because what

we are talking about are — the case of th© prisoner her© was
a statistical case*

It is our opinion that the statistical

case can really only be rebutted effectively with the us© of
statistics and hard information.

What the state has con­

sistently relied ca hare is pure conjecture and speulcation.
There is seras possibility in the record that larger numbers of
Mexican-Air. s-ribana are disqualified on th© basis of alien or
education or whatever it may be, but it is nothing more than
just speculation.
QUESTIONi

And th© question still comes down —
Whan you say speculation, your opponent

says there is evidence in th© record that 22,000 to 28,000
foreign been persons reside in the district, is that evidence
or speculation?
MR,

halls

That — whether those persons are U.S.

21
citizens by birth, by virtue of having one parent who is an
American citis©», whether -they are naturalized individuals —
non© of that information is in the record.
QUESTION;

Doas your proof show anything about what

percentage war© literate, that is to qualify for jury service?
MR. HALLs

Your Honor, once again, the thrust ©f our

proof was the total population by which to compare and then
what is the disparity with that actually appearing on the jury
list selected by the commissioners, and w© did not go into the
question of the —
QUESTION:

But don’t you think that is quite im­

MR. BALL:

If I war® trying tii© case on behalf of the

portant?

state, yes, Your Honor, I would certainly want to go looking
for those kinds of statistics to try to explain that disparity
of ~
QUESTION:

Don’t you think you have/any obligation to

show anything about the literacy questions of the total
Spanish .sur named people?
MR. HhLLs

Your Honor, our understanding of the de­

cisions of this Court in Whitus and. Turner and Avery and
Patton and Hill indicates to the contrary, that when it comes
to — if the state is going to rely upon a suggestion that the
victims of discrimination are victims solely because they lack
the qualifications for service, then it is up to them to prove

22
that: fact*
QUESTION:

Ws.ll,, Mr. Hall, the cases you've raontioxiecl

say that on the basis of pure statistics in a simple disparity
between tlx© population and tbs proportion of — and the racial
make-up of the panel, an inference may be drawn that there has
been systematic racial discrimination arid that because there
is hardly any other explanation, X gather the cases say that
— and if there is some otther explanation, the state ought to
prove it*

But now the state says that that normal inference

of systematic racial discrimination should riot necessarily be
drawn because it just, doesn't make sens®,

this is their

argument anyway, that the people who choose juries would
systematically discriminate against their own race.

Now, the

inference out of the cases rest in human experience and in
logic and common sens®, and the state is saying that that in­
ference shouldn't be drawn when the great majority of the
population is — wall, when the discrimination is not against
a minority *
MR. HhLLs

f
Well, of course, there are a number of

examples where via have seen discrimination against a majority,
ana the courts have rsally not talked — this Court has not
talked about it, nor has any other that I am aware of, talked
about the — focused its attention upon who is doing the
discriminating.
The thrust ox your question, Mr. Justice White, is

23
perfectly wall taken.

1 think all of us — -this case would

have been an easy case in 1969 when Judge Alania took the beach.
This disparity is as grotesque a disparity as has been prasented t© this Court.
All the state is relying upon, other than this specu­
lation in the record that we talked about insofar as aliens
and education is concerned, is what — and I think what they
would like for this Court to do is to erect an irrebuttable
presumption that a black cannot discriminate against a black,

No, I was just going to say that you

wouldn't make out. your prim facie case based on just the
statistics you present, that just a disparity won’t prove your
case,

That is all the state is suggesting,

MR. HALL:

Wall, first of all, we’ve got the Texas

system itself, which is a totally subjective system.

It is

QUESTION:

That is part of the same argument, so that

is part of the same argument in the cases on the bocks that go
to justify the inference that there is this disparity and there

24
is this opportunity for discrimination.

MR» HALL:

Wall, if you remove from the ability to

roly upon a statistical case and you remove frost us the ability
to rely in part proof, as in such cases as Turner, for example,
/

which talks about th© subjective — the d is crimination occurs
at that point when subjective discretion is permitted —

th® power structure is just the reverse, is it not?

Not entirely.

QUESTION;

We are talking —

of th'-?. one that Justice White was talking about.
QUESTION;

In the record, who owns the property down

the. number in 1972 or 3 71 whoa this incident occurred as to
the number of registered voters and whether they war© MexicanAmerican majority or minority, and whether the numbers of
Maxicaa-Anrericaa office holders, there is nothing in the record
about that., what kind of offices they held.
What this ease really boils down to is wfosres do we
place feh© burden of proof in this kind of a situation.

And if

the burden falls upon the single defendant and the single
criminal action to prov® that his class, his ethnic group is
as qualified or more qualified than the rest of the population
in the community, then you have saddled him with an enormous
burden, that, is not. shared by criminal defendants in other kinds
of jurisdictions.
QUESTION?

Mr. Hall, you concede, as I understand it,

thut you as an individual defendant have the burden of making
a prima facie case?

.....

MR. HALLS

That is correct.

questions

And I suppose this is th© question her©

than in a case like this, what is a prima facie case.
MR. HALLs

That's correct.

And as we see it,*based

upon the decisions of this Court, admittedly, Mr. .Justice White,
in a different kind of a context, but applying th© same rules
to Hidalgo County that we apply to the rest, of the Nation, that,
a prims facie, case is made by showing soma kind of a disparity,
a significant disparity —

Could I ask you, to make sure I have it

Well, Peters — can you cite any majority

MR. HALL:

No*

QUESTION:

— on a constitutional basis that there is

a right to a fair cross-section?
MR. HALL;

of course, Mr. Justice Marshall wrote —

QUESTION;

You have got a right to a jury that, is

picked without racial discriminat.ion, that is what you have
got a right to.
MR. HALL:

That's correct.

QUESTION;

That, is as far as th® cases go so far on a.

grand jury, isn’t it?
MR. HALL;

On grand juries, yes.

Now, of course, I

believe in your opinion in Peters — excuse me, in Taylor, you

cited the language of Mr, Justice Marshall used in Paters.
QUESTION:

But. Taylor was —

MR. HALL:

Was a Sixth Araandmant petit jury case.

QUESTION:

That"a correct, petit jury,

MR. HALL:

But what focused — the interesting focus

of both Peters and Taylor are upon not the discrimination, like
in Taylor it was difficult to say that there was intentional
discrimination because it was the women who were refusing to
opt into the system that resulted in a jury pool that was not
representative of a cross-section of the community.
QUESTION:

Yes, but making a prima facie cas® about

if what you have a right to is a cross-section is on© thing,
and making a prima f acia cas© if what you haves a right to is
to ba free from racial discrimination is something else again.
HR. HALL:
fusa -the two.

That's correct, and I don't want to con­

1 understand the distinction, but I just wanted

to point cut to the Court that there seems to be, at least in
these two cases, a renewed emphasis upon the defendant's right
to a jury that is representative of his community, at least in
tha Sixth Amendment petit jury situation.
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals has already disagreed

with Judge Garza's determination, .and that is perhaps not ope®
to reexamination in many respects.

But your showing in the

cas® depended on an assumption that all of the Spanish surname?,d
people ware citizens and that they war® all literate, did it

28
not?

That is wher® you gat your 7 9.2 figure?
MR* HALLs

Your Honor, the 79*2 percent figure is

total population ~
QUESTION:

Yes.

MS* HALL:

— and I relied upon Avery, Turner, Carter,

and Eubanks, among other decisions in the Fifth Circuit, to
support the proposition that wa are entitled to us® -- 1st ms
back off ©£ th&t for a second.
if the disparity here were less, somewhere in the
norm or in the order of, say, 15 to 20 percent, I certainly
would have gona off to attempt to show that that could not
possibly have been based upon alien, literacy or the others.
But here we. have £ 40 percent disparity, 40-plus.

In 1939,

this Court, decided Pierre v. Louisiana., there was a~ 49 percent
disparity there, and it was a total exclusion case,
Arnold, in. 1964, there was one for 44.7 percent.

in

Thar® ar© 43

other written opinions of this Court on this subject, and none
reach a disparity any higher than this on© except the two I
just mentioned.
When you 'v® got. those kinds' of disparities, it is our
argument that there is a lot of room there for conjecture about',
alienage and literacy and sound mind and good moral character
and the other statutory qualifications.

But the burden

properly has to be placed upon the state to explain -QUESTIONs

You think yoikt 79.2 shifted the burden to

29
fch© state and that the state should then have cone in and
demonstrated in -soma way statistically that half of them
couldn’t speak English and 40 percent of them weren’t citizens
and so forth?
MR, HALL:

Yea, Your Honor.

QUESTIONS

If they could rsake that showing?

MR. HALL:

If they could make that showing.

Of

course, they had the testimony of Judge Alamia who had been
empaneling the juries for a few© and a half year period.

One

person had disqualified himself for language and he wasn’t a
Spanish speaker, ha was of Polish descent, who didn’t speak
English*

That, is the only evidence in the record about

language.
questions

.Mr* Hall, when you speak of the 43 cases

from this Court, era you lumping together petit jury and grand
jury cases?
MR. HALLs

Yes, Your Honor, l am including all those

on the subject of jury discrimination,
QUESTION?

And all but on© involved discrimination

against Negroes?
MR. HALLs

Hernandez is the exception, yes.

QUESTIONS

Ona exception.

MR. HALLs

Yes, Hernandez, in 1954.

QUESTIONs

And what war® fell© figures in that case;?

MR. HALL:

Hernandez was 11.1 percent in Jackson

30
County, Texas, in .1953 or ’53, but there were no MaxicanAmericans aver having appeared

it was a total exclusion.

QUESTION : It was a total exclusion cass, was it not?
MR, HALL:

Right.

QUESTION:

Mr, Hall, is there any question about this
i

issue being here?

2-ha I correct .in ray impression that it. was

raised for the first time in th© appeal in the Texas state
courts?
MR. HALL:

That's correct, Your Honor, it was raised

the first tim©-after the trial on © motion for a new trial,
and thz Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ignored the state's
arguments about waiver and decided the case on the merits —
Coleman v. Alabama, Ervin v. Dowd — there are a number of
decisions of this Court indicating to the lower courts and
also to this court, of course, that will reach the merits in
that kind of circumstance.

Supposing that there ware a full trial and the

No.

QUESTION:

It would help you.

But on the grand jury,

it is a problem, isn’t it?
MR. HALL:

Correct.

In closing, the only statement I would like to make
to the Court further is that we are talking about an indi­
vidual’s opportunity to be triad before a jury of his or her
peers.
QUESTIONs

Indie ted.

MR. HALL;

Yes, Your Honor, indicted.

Of course, on

that point, in Alexander v. Louisiana, I believe Mr. Justic®
White, in a footnote, points out that the standards and prin­
ciples for judging the kinds of claims are essentially the same.

QUESTION:
tion.

Mr. Ha 1.1, 1st me ask you on© other ques­

As I road the Court of Appeals opinion, if the case is

remanded for a further hearing and th®

state will have an

opportunity to put in other evidence, is that your reading or
do you think th© case is over?
MR. HALL:

That was not my understanding of it.

Now,

the state has already had two opportunities for a hearing.

As

a matter of fact, when this case was first taken into th©
federal court on the habeas corpus, the state was advised by
Judge Garza in a

orandum order that petitioner had shown

sufficient evidence to shift th© burden of proof to them and
that they ware expected to coma forward with evidence, and
this they totally, failed to do.
Now, on two occasions they have refused to put in
any kind of evidenca other than the testimony of th© judge —
QUESTION:

well, x understand, that goes to th©

question of whether they should get another hearing.

My ques­

tion is hew do you interpret th© mandat© — th€i court ends up
by saying it is remanded for further proceedings, rather than
just simply reversing and directing th© writ to issue.
MR. BALL:

I presume, th© way I understood that, I

presume what they are suggesting is that it be remanded to th©
District Court for th© purpose of issuing an order requiring a

•trial or r©indictmant or ratrial within 90 days.

That’s ray

understanding of it.
