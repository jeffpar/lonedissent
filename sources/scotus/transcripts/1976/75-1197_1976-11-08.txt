ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E, LEE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TEE APPELLANT
MR. LEE;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it'

pleas© the Court;
In separata enactments over the period from 1939 to
1958, Congress had graduatly expanded the Social Security en­
titlements of wage-earners' wives.

So that as of 1958, the

wife of a wage-earner with an entitled child in her care may
obtain benefits without regard to her age when the wage-earner
becomes entitled to primary benefits on his own account.
Also over time, but for quite different reasons.
Congress has expanded and has extended secondary benefits to
certain categories of divorced wives, including the provision
that is involved in this case, in 1965, that divorced wives -defined as those who are married to their husbands for a period
of twenty years or more prior to the divorce —• are entitled
to secondary benefits at the time that the wage-earner becomes
entitled to the primary benefits, provided that they have
reached age 62.
So that prior to age 62, wives, but not divorced

4
wives, are entitled to receive secondary benefits on the basis
of entitled children in their care.
QUESTION;

Is there any possibility under those regu­

lations that the wife could collect benefits from more, than one
husband, a way for a former wife?
MR. LEE;
QUESTION;
MR. LEE;

I think not, at least —
What about divorced persons?
-- she would have to be fairly old, she

would hav® to have been married to two of them for a period of
twenty years and, as I read the legislative history, that was
the purpose of that twenty-year requirement.

I suppose it

would ba conceivably possible, just as the wives being plus 21
years results in the possibilities of the fertile octogenarian,
but -that would be rare.
The appalls® in. this case, Helen DeCastro, was di­
vorced from Albert DeCastro in February of 1968, after more
than twenty years of marriage.
award her alimony.

The divorce decree did not

Some three years /'later, after her ex-husband

became eligible for primary benefits, Mrs. DeCastro applied for
wife's benefits on Mr. DeCastro!s account.

Sh© was then 56

years old and had in her care a 22-year-old disabled daughter.
Th© daughter was entitled to and continues t© receive child’s
insurance benefits because of Mr. DeCastroes ‘social security
earnings record.
At th® conclusion of the Administrative process, the

5
Secretary determined that Mrs. DeCastro was net entitled to
benefits; she thereupon brought, suit contending that section
202(b) (1) (B) of the Act unconstitutionally discriminates
against divorced wives.

The three-judge court ruled in her

favor and this appeal followed.
The key to the disposition of this case w© submit is
contained in two interrelated considerations.

The first is the

history of tha statutory provisions in which Congress over a
period of some three decadas has gradually but continually ex­
panded the secondary insurance benefits available to wives and
divorced wives, each with its separat® rational®, with a single
over-arching rationale in the case of wives to benefit the
family, but with subsidiary rationales applicable to most of
the individual ones.
Th® second dispositive consideration is the constitu­
tional standard to which Congress has held in performing its
policymaking function of allocating scarce social insurance
resources.

I would like to address each of these separately,

but first th® history of th© relevant statutory provisions.
Th© controlling feature of th© legislative history is
that th© secondary benefits to which wives and divorced wives
are antitied did not result from a single legislative enact­
ment but., rather, over a period of some thirty years.

Congress

has incrementally expanded these benefits with th© history of
each addition clearly disclosing a proper objective, but. in no

6

case did the rational® for the particular enlargement of
secondary insurance benefits to the wife equally embrace the
class of divorced wives to which the appall©© belongs,
When originally enacted in 1935, the Social Security
Act provided only primary benefits to the wage-earner himself.
Th© first expansion of secondary benefits occurred in 1939.
It was a. general expansion.

It had a general purpose, and

that purpose was very clearly set forth in th© legislative
history and was cited by this Court as dispositive of th©
issue in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, and it was to afford more
adequate protection to the family as a unit.
In addition and relevant to this case, th© 1939
amendments contained the first instance of extension of bene­
fits on an account of an entitled child in the car® of either
a wife or ex-wife.

It was a narrow extension.

It was mad®

only to widows who had reached either age 65 or had an entitled
child in their care.

And one® again, there was a precise

rational® for this particular extension, in addition to the
general family protection that was applicable to the entire
package of 1939 secondary benefits.

Again, this was quoted in

th© Wiesenfeld opinion, and it was that Congress wanted to
give th© child deprived of on© parent, in this case through
death, th© opportunity for th© personal attention of the other.
From 1939 to 1950, there was no change in the eligi­
bility provisions for wives or widows.

In 1950, Congress

7
extended the entitled child eligibility to the wife or a re­
tired,. whereas prior to that tine it had only beam deceased
wage-earnar.

Th© rational® was not th© same as it was in 193 9,

because th© wife, unlike th© widow, is not' faced with th®
choice of either foregoing income or leaving th© child unat­
tended altogether because her husband isn’t dead.

But retire­

ment in the usual case means income reduction, and extension of
this benefit reduced the need for major adjustments in th©
family patterns, in the normal family unit, coming at a time
lata in th® wage-earner 5s life.
Eight years later, in 1958, benefits war© extended to
th© wife, of a disabled wage-earner with an entitled child in
hex car®.

So that as of 1958 , we have all of th© grounds

covered — deceased, disabled or retired.

One© again, th©

rationale for extension to the disabled or to th© wife of a
disabled wage-earner with an entitled child in her car© was
tailor®! to th® particular extension.

As th© House committee

report observes, th® child of a disabled wage-earner will
usually be younger than th© child of a retired wag©-earner,
with correspondingly greater need to permit th© mother to re­
main at horns.

And the House canmitte® report further observas

that a person receiving liability insurance benefits — excuse
me, disability insurance benefits, frequently has high medical
expenses, with attendant diminution on the family iacorn©.
Each of th@s© extensions of secondary benefits to

8
wives or widows on account of entitled children in their care
was bottomed on a distinct font very proper rational®.

There is

on© unifying feature to the three, and it is that each
rational® promoted in some way more adequate protection to the
family as a unit.

Neither this general ofojactiva of affording

protection to the family as a unit , nor -the more precisely
identified objectives ©f the 1939, 1950 and 1958 amendments has
any relevance to divorced wives.
In the normal case, divorce works a fundamental and
©muring change not only on family relationships but also on
th® financial dependence of one divorced spouse on the. other.
Th© kinds of impact —
QUESTION 3
MR. LEEs

Are we bound by that observation?
Well,

I assume not, Mr. Justice White, but

it, is th® kind of thing certainly that under the broad dis­
cretion that this Court has afforded to Congress in its recent
decisions is th® kind of thing that Congress could have taken
into account.
QUESTION;

Well, it could have, but do you know

whether it did cr not?
MR. LEE;

We certainly know this, at a minimum, that

in 193 9, when the initial extension was mad©, that, th® thing
that Congress was attempting to do was to afford more adequate
protection for th© family as a unit.

We know that in 1958 they

bad family internal, on-going family relationships in mind.

9
because of the observation that family income would be reduced
because of disability —
QUESTION?

A lot of divorced wives ar© still depend­

ant upon -their ex-husbands for their support.
MR. LEE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Well, on what basis do you say that

Congress determined or that generally it is true that more
divorced wives than not are not dependent on their —
MR. LEE:

Well, the figures, the best figures that we

have are those that are set forth in our brief, and they indi­
cat® that only about 14 percent of: divorced, wives ar© entitled
to alimony by virtu© of the decree, and that about 45 percent
of those 14 parcent actually receive it, so we are down to
around 6.5 percent.

Th© significance of that fact, of course,

is this —
QUESTION;

Was any of that befor® Congress, or do you

know?

y
MR. LEE:

I really don't, know.

the reports so to indicata.

There is nothing in

But th® point is, what you really

corae down to then is a question of how much leeway do we give
to Congress in making these kinds of judgments.

You do have

the problem with the 6.5 parcant of the over-inclusiveness or
the under“inclusiveness, the same kind of problem that this
Court faced in Saif i, th© same kind of problem that this Court
faced just six months ago in th© Lucas case.

And in Dandridg®

10
Vo Williams, th<® Court said that Congress is entitled to face
these probloas one at a time.
And manifestly, when you hav© a program that is dasigned to handle the problems of tens of millions of people,
with desperate requirements and desperata circumstances,
there ara going to be some ragged edges.

As Mr. Justice

Stewart observed in his separata opinion in Cramer v. Union
Fr@s School District, that kind of imperfection is part of the
inevitable consequences of line-drawing, you always hav© son©
instances in which Congress does not and indeed cannot exactly
tailor its program to avoid any possibility of anomaly or in­
equity,

And if there is any message that comes out of Salfi

and Lucas and Dandridge v, Williams, it is that so long as
there is a rational basis which Congress could have taken into
account, that that is proper, and •—
QUESTION;

Would it be' so much trouble to identify

needy divorced wives?

Is that the only trouble -that Congress is

avoiding by this rule?
MR. LEE;

No, the problem Congress is avoiding by

this approach, Mr, Justice Whit©, is that Congress5 bag of
funds is limited and it can solve only on® problem at a time.
I might disagree.

In fact, by the time you take into account

the number of variables with which Congress has to deal
divorce status as opposed to non-divorce status, age,
dependency, and you could go on for about fiv© or six —■ and

11

■chan you consider all of the different canbin&tions that can
enter in? there is no circumstance in which someone cannot
take Congress has dona and say you mad© a mistake, that you
should have allocated more money in this instance rather than
in —
QUESTION;

You haven't suggested to me yet any basis

for distinguishing between the needy divorced wife and the
needy married — and the widow, except that it would cost, scan®
money, and mayh© it would cost too much.
would ba a bad reason.

I am not saying that

But is there any other reason than the

fact that it would just cost some money to identify the needy
divorced wives ?
MR. LEE;

Yes, there is.

If you concentrated on that

question — and, incidentally, that is th® question that the
lower court concentrated on, and I think that was the root
error ©f the lower court‘“-and you ask only th© question are
divorced wives more needy or less needy than wives, then I
.

.

think you might make a fairly good case for the proposition
that divorced wives in fact are as needy as a group as ar© ~
QUESTION;

I am just talking about a needy divorced

wife, and you agree that there would be needy divorced wives.
MR. LEE;

Indeed, I do, but that does not render the

statute unconstitutional, because probably the neediest of all
in our society are- probably not divorced wives nor wives but
probably orphans who have no parents at all to take care of

12
them.

But the point is that, Congress, so long as it acts on a

reasonable basis, so long as it —
QUESTION%

You mean a money-saving basis.

Now, 1 am

not saying that is a bad reason, but that is what it is doing,
isn't it, is saving money by not identifying the needy wives?
MR. LEE?

By going, as this Court said that they war®

entitled to proceed, on© step at a time.
QUESTIONS

Maybe another way to put that would ba

'that they are able, having & single pi®, to give more money to
other disabled categories, to children, to wives as distin­
guished from divorced wives, by drawing that line?
MR. LEE:

That is correct.

There ar© at least three

differences between wives in this context and divorced wives,
all of which fall within the broad aegis of protection of the
family as a unit and

sot©

of which very specifically were

identified by Congress as constituting part of its basis which
Congress could rationally take into account in making the de­
cision that it did in this case./
Th© first is that the death, retirement or disability
of the wage-earner has an affect on th© family income in the
usual case.

In the usual divorce situation this is not true.

In 6.5 percent of the cases it is. But as I mentioned a moment
ago, Lucas held that Congress may make distinctions based on
th© relative-likelihood of dependency»
legitimates versus illegitimates.

In that case, it was

Hare, it is wives'

13
dependency versus divorced wives' dependency.
Th© second difference is that th®r® is a living
benefit to th© wage-earner in that secondary insurance to
members of his family increases the family income and doss so
at th© time that there is a reduction in th® overall family
incoma.
And finally the payment of benefits to th® wife minimisss th© ©stent to which -the farai3.y’s normal routine must be
disrupted by th© wage-earner’s termination of his employment,
which was th© precis© factor 'that Congress mentioned at th©
time that it enacted th© 1958 addition.
Th© problems of divorced wives, Mr. Justice White,
ar© not to b® denied.

But th® disadvantages undar which they

labor ara created by the fact of divorce and not by th© social
security program.

Th© aspects of impact on the family from

death, retirement or disability with which Congress was attempt
ing to deal in this incremental program which it enacted ar©
simply lacking in th© divorce context..
Th® fact that hex ex-husband has reached retirement
has no effect on th® extent of Mrs. DeCastro's need.

Therefor©

unlike Wiasenfeld, for example, this is not a case where th©
©vent that triggered the particular benefit to on© class but
not another is an event that is accompanied by some hardship on
the non-receiving class.
Now, the final observation that I would like to make

14
— and then I will reserve some time — is that even if the
legislative history in this case were not as clear as it is,
and while Congress did not cover all the bases, we submit that
for reasons that Justice Garsdan has set forth in our brief,
they did a pretty good job, that under the consistent rulings
of this Court on clarity as to whether Congress has chosen a
proper purpose or an improper purpose, works to the benefit
rather than to the detriment of the statute, because under the
consistent rulings of this Court the purpose of statutory in­
terpretation is to sav© and not to destroy.
It would, wa submit, be a gross distortion of 'this
principle to ascribe to Congress a purpose that it did not have
but that would raise serious constitutional questions,
especially when both Congress and this Court have mad© it so
clear that the focus of these provisions is th© protection of
the family.
It is, as Mr. Justice Powell observed in his concur­
ring opinion in wiasenfeld, social security is designed cer­
tainly in this context for the protection of th© family.

That

was th© overriding consideration at th© time that Congress
first got into th© business of extending secondary insurance
benefits in 1939, it has been the single overarching purpose
sine© -that time, and every subsidiary rationale is consistent
with it.
Mov?, on© item that r®mains for discussion in the

15
course of this legislative history is the history of the on©
provision in 1965 that extended secondary benefits to the
divorced wife whose husband or whose wag®-earner ex-husband
is not deceased.
Hen:© again,, fch© legislative history is very praeis®
and it reveals that Congress intended to handle or to taka
car© of on® problem and on® problem only.

It might b© said or

on® purpose might have been generally to provides for needy
divorced wives of to provide for the children, of needy divorced
wives.

That was not the purpose of the 1965 amendment.

The

legislative history on this matter is very precis®, and I
quote:

"It is not uncommon for a marriage to and in divorce

after many years whan the wife is too old to build up a social
security earnings record even if she can find a job."

That is

a very narrow problem , and that is the narrow problem with
which Congress dealt, and that is the reason — that is one of
the two reasons, Mr. chief Justice, for the twenty-year require­
ment.

One was an attempt to avoid the multi.pl© claimant situa­

tion, and the other was to take care of the situation in which
a couple axe married for many years and at the conclusion of
that marriage the wife is simply too old, even if she could
find a job, to get back into the market and build, up a social
security earnings record on her own account.

Consequently, it

was the wife, the older divorced wife who was the f ocus of the
1965 amendment and not the child.

16
I would like to reserve son© time.
QUESTION?

Mr. Lee, before you sit down? am I correct
i

1b understanding that 1S65 is the first time when any divorced
wives got assy benefits at all?
MR. LEE:

Yes, a divorced wife whose wage-earner was

still living.
QUESTION:

But was there a divorced wife death berm-

fit before that?
MR. LEE:

Y@s, in 1950 it was extended to what they

called mothers * benefits in the case of a divorced wife whose
wage-earner ex-husband was dead and there were three require­
ments.

On© was that she have an entitled child in her care;

the second was that the wag©-earner b® dead; and the third was
that she show a certain measure of dependency.
QUESTION:

That was what, was involved in Weinberger,

wasn’t it?
MR. LEE:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, that was.

QUESTION:

Y@s.

MR. LEE:

None.

And before 1950, no provisions were

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN A. BRUSMAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BRUSMAN:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

17
The issue in this cas© revolves around the constitu­
tionality of section 202 (b)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act»
That section creates two classes of women.

The first class is

composed of wives under ag© 62 with dependent children in their
car©

t© whom benefits are granted.

Th® second class is com­

posed of wives who have secured divorces after at least twenty
years of marriage, who ar© also under ag® 62 and who also hav©
dependent children of the marriage in their car©.

To this

»

group, no social security benefits ar© granted.
The question that arises is whether this different
treatment of married wives and divorced wives with dependent
children ia their car© under ag© 62 is justified.

Does th©

line that Congress has drawn between married wives and
divorced wives with entitled children bear som@ rational rela­
tionship to a legitimate legislative purposa.
to m© to bsccma

vary

And so it seams

important for this Court to determine

what th® purpose of this provision of section 202(b)(1)(B) is.
1 submit that th© purposa of that provision is to
facilitate parental car© for dependent children by enabling
mothers to remain at home and care for those children.

I

think this purpose is clear when you ©xamin© section 202 (b) (1)
(B) .
It provides, first of all, benefits to wives and di­
vorced wives upon attaining age 62, regardless of whether or
not they have children in their care.

But a young wife under

18

ag© 62 Is given benefits only if she has a dependent child in
her care.

Th@ young wife who doesn't have a dependent child

in her care recalvas no benefits until sh© attains ag© 62, and
it seems to me that if Congress were concern©! solely for the
welfare of the wife, there would be no necessity to condition
her eligibility for benefits upon the presence of a child in
her car©»

Evidently Congress was concern©!, not with the wel­

fare of the wife herself but for the child that she her© re­
sponsibility for.
Moreover, if you look at the provisions that termin­
ate the benefits that are paid- to a wife with a child in her
car®, you se© that the benefits ceasa when the benefits that
are paid to a child cease.

In othar words, the wife's benefits

ar© linked t© the child's benefits and ar© paid only so long as
it was realistic to think that the child would need his mother's
car®.
QUESTION:

Mr. Brusman, in order to prevail on your

argument, as I understand your position, you have to first
pick out a purpose to identify that Congress was shooting at
and then in effect conclude that it missed.
MR.

brusmans

Is that right?

Well, the standard for tasting the con­

stitutionality of congressional legislation, as I understand
it, is that the classification drawn by Congress has to bear a
relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose.
QUESTIONS

Yes.

13

MR. BRUSMAN%

And I think it is important to identify

that purpose and to see whether the classification drawn re­
lates to it.
QUESTION;

In identifying the purpose, you necessarily

hav® to talc® th® position that Congress had a purpose in mi ml
but somehow misfired somewhere, between- adopting that purpose
and getting th® law passed?
MR. BRUSMAN;

Not really, bacaus®, you see, in 1939

benefits were first provided to wives as a class, end then in
1950 they ware provided to wives with children in th©ir car©.
And it seems that the history is th® problem.

The benefits

that were finally accorded to divorced wives didn't, begin until
1965,

I think the purpose of providing benefits to a wife with

a child in her car® was enacted or thought of back in 1950
when benefits were first accorded to wives with children.
QUESTION;

But do you say w© must conclude that each

time Congress amended th© Act, it had th© same purpose in mind?
MR. BRUSMAN;

Well, that purpose hasn't, changed.

There hasn’t b@@n any change in that section,of section 202(b)
(1) (B) .
QUESTION;

Mr. Brusman, in your brief, you don't cite

Mathews v. Lucas decided last June,

I take it you feel that

has no bearing on this case?
MR. BRUSMAN;
QUESTION;

I do.

It take it your opposition thinks otherwise,

20

bacaus© they cits it.
MR. BROGANs
QUESTION:

Apparently.

Mr. Srusman,

do you think -that before

1950, when there was a scheme of benefits for wives and no
scheme ©f benefits at all for divorced wives, was the scheme
unconsfcitutiona 1?
MR. BRUSMAN:

No, I don’t think it was.

But once

Congress recognized feat divorced wives had the same need for
benefits and are perhaps just as dependeat upon their former
husbands as the wives are concerned, one® they make that recog­
nition, then it seems to me that the previsions such as w© have
her© ar© unconstitutional.
QUESTION?

Does that not assume that divorced wives

as a general proposition ar© dependent upon their husbands?
MR. BRUSMAN;
QUESTION?,

That is —

You start with that assumption, don’t you?

MR. BRUSMAN;

I say that they ar© at least equally

dependent upon their former husbands as wives ar© ©n their
husbands.
QUESTION;

And from what do you draw that, common

human experience or what?
MR. BRUSMAN;

I would draw that from common sense,

yes, and —
QUESTION;
experience,

Well, common sense.

I said common human

is that th© generality of experience and does it -

21
MR. BRUSH AMs
QUESTIONS

Well, it seems to in© that a woman —

Is it not a matter ©f which we could taka

judicial notice, that the majority of women who get. divorced
get r«married?
MR. BRUSMANs

Well, on© of feha conditions for eligi­

bility under section 202(b)(1)(B) is that she not b© remarried.
QUESTIONS

Yes, I know, but I am speaking of the

generality of experienc® now.

You are making a general — you

postulated a general proposition that divorced wives as a class
w®r@ dependent upon their husbands, fch© husband from whom they
were first divorced.
MR. BRUSMANs

Wall, based on my experience, it is

not really a divorced wife that we are talking about here.

We

ar® talking about a divorced wife who is married at least
twenty years prior t© her divorce and who has children of that
marriage in her car©.
QUESTIONi

And who has not remarried?

MR. BRUSHA Kh

And who has not remarried.

ANd it is

that parson that is just as likely to b© dependeat upon her
husband as the wife,
' QUESTIONS

If she can find him.

MR. BRUSMANs

If sha can find him, and that was on©

of fch© problems in this case.
QUESTIONS

What are you going to do with th® govern­

ment's figures about those that you don’t find?

22
MR. brusman:

it still doesn't change the degree of

dependence.
QUESTION?
dependence.

Well, I don’t understand what you mean by

You mean a wife whose husband is not paying her

any alimony at all is dependent on him?
MR. BRUSMANs
QUESTIONS

Well, dependence —

Well, is she?

MR. BKUSMAN:

I think dependence exists, if she can't

find the husband, she lias t© find some other soiree ©f income
to survive.
QUESTIONt

So sha automatically, just by getting

married, sha becomes eligible?
MR. BRUSMAN:

Well, if she remarries, she becomes

Ineligible for benefits under this section.
QUESTION*

If sh® marries a man and lives with him

twenty years, it makes no difference whether she is divorced
or not, that is your theory?
MR. BRUSMAN:

I am not quit© sure I follow what you

are poinfcing out,
QUESTION?

That the divorced wife is entitled to the

same as th© undivarced wife.
MR. BRUSMANs

As long as she has a child in her care,

yes.
QUESTIONS

As long as she has the child, she is

qualified, there is no way she can lose it

23

MR. BRUSMAN;

Wall, she asm loea it if she remarries.

If th@ child become ineligible for benefits, -than sha loses it
as well.
From an examination of the structure of section 202
(b)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act, I submit respectfully
that th© purpose of that section is to allow a mother to remain
at home a m3, ear® for her child.

And given that purpose, the

question then becomes what justification exists for excluding
divorced wives and their children from th© statute's coverage.
Why should a divorced wife who was married at least twentyyears prior to her divorce b© denied benefits in preference to
a wife who has not been divorced?

Why should a wife who is

separated from her husband b© granted benefits and a divorced
wife not?

And why should children of divorced parents not have

th© same opportunity for th©ir parent’s full time and attention
that is afforded th© children of married parents?
A married mother
QUESTION;

Mr. Brusman* couldn't you ask all of those

same questions with respect to a divorced wif® with children
S3 years old who had only been married nineteen and a half
years?
MR. BRUSMAN;
QUESTION;

True, but wa ar® not ~

There is a whole variety of things that

ar@ going to b© unconstitutional if we hold this particular
a at,©gory unconstitutiona 1.

24
MR. BRUSHAN:

But the question in this cas© isn't the

constitutions. lity of -QUESTION:

Your sam® argument would apply to that

hypothetical case, wouldn't it?
MR. BRUSMAN:

I would believe so, yes, Your Honor.

A mother is afforded the opportunity of staying horn©
with her child? a divorced mother must forego that opportunity.
Benefits that Congress thought were essential for the proper
car© and supervision of the children of wage-earners ar® denied
simply because of the mother 5s marital status.

And what differ­

ence does it make whether the mother is married, separated or
divorced?

I submit it doesn't make any difference, and that

is why this exclusion of divorced wives from the statute’s
coverage .is irrational.
The Secretary has argued that there is & rational
teisis for this statute.

He argued, first of all, that wives

as a class are substantially more likely to he dependent upon
their husbands than divorced wives and ar© thus likely to
suffer loss of support when the husband becomes disabled or’
retires.

The basis for that statement ar© two surgeys, a 1925

survey and a 1975 survey that ha cites in his brief, and the
citations state that only 14 pereant of divorced women receive
alimony.
It is important I think to reflect upon what we are
not told by thoss statistics.

We don’t know the percentage of

25

divorced women with children who receive alimony.

We don’t

know th© percentage of divorced women who have bean married at
least twenty years prior to their divorce and who have children
in their care who receive alimony.

W© don't know the percent­

age of divorced women who perhaps don’t receive support in the
form of alimony but do receive it in the form of child support.
And it seems to m© that there will b® a much higher percentage
of woman receiving

divorced women receiving alimony among

those women who war® divorced after twenty years of marriage
with dependant children in their care.
And so the conclusion that the Secretary draws that
wives are more dependent than divorced wives upon the wag©earner really has no foundation, because both groups are going

to be equally dependent.
I have no figuras to cite to you.

The only figures

the Secretary has are two from a 1925 and a 1975 survey.
QUESTIONs

But what if w© agree with those figures

or what if we think we cannot ignore them, that ws must rely on
them, what then?
MR. BRUSMAN;

It s®sms to m© that Congress couldn't

have relied on those figures in enacting this legislation.

A

1925 survey was many years prior to the time this came into
law, and the 1975 survey occurred after this had already been
passed.
QUESTIONS

Yes, but I ask you again, what if w© —- do

26

you think fch© facts ar® relevant?

Do you think the question is

relevant as to the proportion of divorced wive® that are or ar©
not dependent?
MR. BRUSMAN:

I think th© relevant inquiry is th©

percentage of divorced wives with children in their car© that
receive

alimony as opposed —
QUESTION:

You think though that is a relevant inquiry?

MR. BRUSMAN s
QUESTION:

Yes.

And how do we find that out, what the

answer is?
MR. BRUSMAN:

I think that you can, you know, base —

you can make soma assumptions based on personal experience.
QUESTION:

Well, what if w© agree with fch© Secretary

as to what that percentage is?
MR. BRUSMAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?

what if w© agree with the Secretary as to

what, -that percentage is'?
MR. BRUSMAN:

Well, again, I just don't think -that

figure is the relevant figur®.
QUESTION:

Wall, I will put it to you, what if we

decided, what if we thought from the best information w© could
find that 10 percent of them were dependent no more?
MR. BRUSMAN:
QUESTION;

Ten percent of what, divorced women?

No, 10 percent of divorced women with de­

pendent children are receiving alimony but no more?

27

MR. BRUSHAMj

tod if th© same percentage of married

wives with children wer© dependent upon their husbands, then I
•think the statistic would be relevant•

W& don’t know the per­

centage of married wives with children that are dependent upon
their husbands.

In fact, this Court, in th® Froutera1 decision,

noted in a footnote that 41.5 percent ©£ all married women wer®
employed, and you commented that the presumption ©£ dependency
of wives upon their wage-earners doesn't bear any relationship
to pr@s65at.-day reality.
tod so it seems to me you just can’t presume that on©
group is dependent and then cite statistics that show that
another group isn’t..

Thay have to make presumptions in both

cases or have statistics in both casas.
QUESTIONS

Assuming that that figure you cited from

th® footnote in Fronfcaral is valid, what inference should be
drawn with respect than to people who are no longer — women
who are no longer th® wives of the principal social security
account?
MR. BRUSHAN;

I don’t understand th® question, Your

Honor.
QUESTION;
clearer.

Well, I don’t know how I could make it any

41 percent, you said,the footnote describes as being

employed and not dependent, of married women.
MR. BRUSHAN;
don’t know.

whether ©r not they are dependent, we

All w® know is the percentage that is employed.

28

QUESTION:

That is ©mplcived, yes.

So would it not be

reasonable for Congress to infer from that that they were not
dependent?
MR. BRUSMANs
QUESTION:

They could infer from that.

well, then move from the married woman to

the divorced woman, on what basis would you assume that there
is a dependency of the divorced wife?
MR. BRUSMAN:
to you.

Well, again, I have no figures to cite

But you have to understand that w© deal her® with the

woman divorced, after twenty years of marriage, who has a de­
pendant child in her car®, and it seems to me that it is the
child in her car® that is' going to determine whether or not she
is employed or whether or not she ia dependent.

The assumption

is that a woman with a child ©r children in h@r car© is going
to bs at home taking car-© of that child.
QUESTION:

Where do you gat that assumption?

MR. BRUSMAN:

Based on what the normal role of the

wife has teen in our society for many years, although it is
changing now.
QUESTION:

Precisely the contrary argument about work­

ing mothers, w© have had that dose?® of times here.
MR. BRUSMAN: -I realise that, but this legislation was
drawn at a time when the wife was traditionally the parent who
remained at homo and took car© of the child.
QUESTION:

Well, you are making your claim though today,

29
not, as ©£ IS65, aren't you?
MR, BRUSHAMs

That’s true, but you still hav© to,

it seems to m®, go back and look at what the purpose was in
giving benefits to wives with children, and if that takes her
back before 1965, sobeit.
The problem dealt with by this portion of the statute
again X submit is the needs of dependent children.

Those

n@@ds exist regardless of whether the child 8s mother is married,
separated or divorced.

The need ©f children of divorced

parents is no less than the need of children of married
parents, and the need in each case is the same and should be
satisfied for all.
By affording benefits
QUESTION:

*

Now, for a dependent, child or a divorced

wife in tills case?
MR. BRUSMAN:

The benefits are, paid to the wife, but

the ultimate beneficiary, it seems to me, is the child that
she is taking car© of.

They are paid to her so that she can

remain at home and give that child the car®, that Congress
apparently felt was very necessary.

And having recognized a

need among young and disabled children for their —QUESTION;

Well, there is an allowance for the child,

isn8t there?
MR. BRUSMAN;

There is, and there is an allowance

for the child if the mother is married — there is no

30

distinction as far as that is concerned.

Having recognised

a need among young and disabled children for maternal cars and
having determined to fulfill that need by granting benefits to
wives who can provida that care, it is entirely irrational for
Congress then to exclude divorced v/ives and their children from
tha statutecs coverage.

The divorce of -the mother doesn’t

change the need for benefits.
QUESTION?

Mr. Brusman, one other question.

Your

client could qualify if she w®r® a wife or if she were over 62,
as I understand it?
MR, BRUSMAN?

If she were a wife, sh© would b<s eligible

for benefits now and upon attaining ag© 62 sh® also becomes
eligible.
QUESTION %

Even though she retains her status as a

divorced wife.
MR. BRUSMANs
QUESTION?

¥©8.

Do you challenge tha age bracket of 62?

MR. BRUSMAN?

As far as this case is concerned, w©

are only dealing with wives with children in their car© and
divorced wives with children in their car© under ag© 62.
The Social Security Act is designed to pay benefits in
accordance with the probable needs of tha beneficiaries.

To

sustain this legislation, it seems to me, this Court has to
conclude that the needs of children of divorced parents are less
than th® needs of children of other parents.

31

QUESTION?

What would b® thm needs of a divorced

woman married twenty years with a dependant child who is only
52 years of age?

Would they not b® substantially the same as

the woman 62?
MR. BRUSHAN%
QUESTIONS

I think the needs would be the same.

That is part of your case, isn't it, be­

cause your client when she attains 62 will get these benefits?
MR. BRUSHAM2

Sh© will b© getting these benefits.

The relevant point that I am trying to make is that under age
62 wives with children in th©ir car© receive benefits.

The

divorced wives in the same situation don’t receive any benefits,
and yet the needs are exactly the same, although I don’t hav©
any statistics fc© give the Court.

Married and divorced mothers

with children that, hav© similar needs are treated differently
by this section, without any rational justification, and absent
rational justification for the different treatment I submit
that this section violates the equal protection guarantees im­
plicit in the Fifth Amendment due process clause, and accord­
ingly 1 urge that the judgment of the District Court bs
affirmed.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

RESBUTTAL

32
MR. LEEs

If 1 may, just very briefly, Mr, Chief

Justice.
First of all, with regard to Mathews v. Lucas, I can
understand the appellee's reluctance to discuss this case.
submit ‘that it is dispositive for at least two reasons.

We

On© is

that its bare holding amounts to nothing less than the proposi­
tion that Congress is entitled to make distinctions based upon
the ralatlva likelihood of dependency.

In that case, legitimacy

versus illegitimacy? in this case, wives who ar® dependent on
their wage-earner husbands as opposed to divorced wives for
whom the alimony picture is rather revealing as it has been set
forth in the statistics.
The second significance perhaps is to an even mors
fundamental point, and it is that, as I read Lucas, it contains
a reaffirmation of the principle that if there is unclarity in
the statuta and its history as to what the purpose of the
statute is

you don’t ascribe to, that unclarity works to the

benefit of the statute and not to its detriment, that it does
not result in ascribing to the statute a purpose which will
declare it unconstitutional.
And specially, in Mathews v. Lucas, the root error of
the lower court was the same as the root error in this Court,
and that is that that court concluded that, the Act was not in­
tended to merely replace actual support for the child lost but
also obligations ©f support or potential support.

And

35
that brings m© to th© proposition that I alluded to only
tangentially earlier, and th© point I think that Mr. Justice
Stevens was making, and teat is that her®, unlike Wiesenfold,
you have really a list of possible intarrelating considerations
teat could enter into Congress 5 deliberations — age, widowhood
or survivorship, th© relationship to th© wage-earner, dependency,
tea time the marriage endured, and whether there were entitled
children in their care.
Mow, every on® of those is a variable, and if you
make your determination rest solely upon need, than virtually
th® entire statutory scheme has to fall, because, as my opponent
has conceded and indeed h® must concede, th® need of on© who
has ba©n married 19 years by hypothesis will be just as great
as the on® who has been married for twenty years and one month.
The need of Mrs. DeCastro does not increase the day
that sh® turns 62 and, similarly, again th© relevance, Mr.
Justice White, of the support figures, in all but 6.5 percent
of the. cases, the need does not, increase when th© husband dies.
So that if tea focus is just on, number on©, an as­
sumed purpose; and, number two, a purpose that is not in fact
the purpose that Congress had in mind, then th© attack on the
statute will reach all across many, many of its aspects.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, another example — and just

correct me if I am wrong on this —- if the husband should re­
marry, does th© divorced wife stop being a statutory divorced

36

wife?
MRo LEE:
QUESTION:
MR, LEE;

Shs does not,
3h© does not?
So long as sh© satisfies the twenty-year

requirement, all of which leads to the proposition that 'the
only legal issue that is involved in this ease is the same legal
issue that the Court first considered in Nebia v. New York,
that it has thankfully reaffirmed in Williamson v. Le© Optical,
in SaIfi, and in Mathews v. Lucas, that in the area of alloca­
tion of scarce social insurance resources, as in the area of
economic regulation.
So as long as Congress cannot be clearly identified
to have relied on an improper purpose, as it did in wiesonfald,
and so long as it has net discriminated, as it has not don® in
this case, then those policy judgments in allocating scarce
resources for social insurance rest within the sound discretion
of Congress.

Under that standard, it is very clear, we submit,

that th© judgment of the lower court must be reversed.
Thank you.
