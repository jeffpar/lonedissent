ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNETT H. BRUKMER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF C? THE PETITIONER — RESUMED
MR. DRUMMER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it pleas© the Court:
The petitioner has based his constitutional claim on
Sixth Amendment grounds as well as fundamental fairness, on the
basis that the voucher rule had been applied to sanctify the
testimony of Linda Maness.

Although Linda was clearly adverse

within the definition of adverse set forth in Chambers, the
petitioner was unable to cross-examine her or to contradict
her.

This left her denial of guilt intact before the jury.

Her denial pointed the finger at the petitioner because he was
the only other suspect.
The petitioner was also unable to get Linda to admit

bar guilt on the stand.

It was a reasonable prospect of doing

this because Linda had previously made admissions against her
penal interests with regard to this case on a number of
occasions.

But defense counsel was unable to ask Linda whether

she knew in fact that the petitioner did not do it because the
trial court applied the voucher rule to preclude this inquiry.

IS
Even if defense counsel could only have elicited from
Linda -that she had previously stated that the petitioner did
not do it# this evidence would have had a dramatic impact upon
the jury.

This is especially true in light of the fact that

she had testified on the stand that the petitioner was alone
at the time, alone with the baby at th© time that the baby
was injured and that sh© had gone to the store.
It is very important to not© that Linda’s testimony
is the only evidence which would point the finger of guilt at
th© petitioner, rather than at Linda, except for the confession given by the petitioner which he recanted on the stand
and attempted to explain away.

Eis inability to extract

evidence from Linda also hurt his ability to support the recantation of his confession.
Under Washington v. Texas, th© petitioner was entitled
to us© th© testimony of th© witnesses h© had call©! to th©
stand.

Th© situation here is very similar to the situation

that this Court condemned in Davis v. Alaska.

It is a depriva­

tion of th© right to confrontation and compulsory process to
restrict a party to a single question suggesting bias or
interest when an adverse witness answers with a general denial
and th© party is seeking to adduce relevant and material evi­
dence which is probative in his defense.
Such a restriction deprived the petitioner here from
revealing th© falsehood and bias in Linda’s testimony.

Also

17
it may have appeared to the jury that the defense was engaged
in a baseless attack on Linda, and. this may have hurt the
petitioner as well.
We would call the Court's attention to the opinion of
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Torres,
which is based on this Court’s decision in Chambers.

The

situation there parallels the situation in Davis.
We would submit that the rights to confrontation and
compulsory process are clearly applicable without regard to
whether a third party confession appears in the record.

We

base this submission on the cases of Washington, Davis and
Torres, in addition to this Court’s decision in Chambers.
As early as his direct appeal, the petitioner has
argued that the voucher rule has been applied to limit the
right of the petitioner to use the testimony of Linda and Dana
Maness in violation of the Sixth Amendment principles set forth
in Washington v. Texas.
In Chambers, this Court set forth a balancing test
for evaluation cf the constitutionality of a clash between the
Sixth Amendment and state evidentiary rules.

The two compon­

ents are the value and validity of th© rule in question and
the impact -- the second is the impact on the petitioner's
ability to present a defense.
With regard to the first component, in this case the
voucher rule is an irrational rule.

It promotes no state

18
interest; whatsoever-.

Certainly, the respondent has not come

forward with any defense or explanation of the rationale for
the rule or the rationale for the application of the rule in
this particular case.
With regard to the impact of the rule on the peti­
tioner 5s ability to present a defense, we would refer this
Court to the findings of the court below, to the effect that
the voucher rul© undoubtedly worked to the detriment of the
petitioner and that some evidence suggesting his guilt —
excuse m© — suggesting his innocence was excluded.
It is also important to notice that fch© court said
that the fact-finding process had been impaired due to the
inability of the petitioner to cross-examine Linda Maness.
Because there is no legitimate state interest to be a counter­
vailing weight in the balancing test, we submit that in light
of the findings of the Fifth Circuit, the conclusion is inex­
orable, that the record reflects a constitutional violation of
•the petitioner's right to fundamental fairness as well as the
Sixth Amendment guarantees incorporated in the due process
clause.
In conclusion, I would like to briefly address myself
to an additional question which the respondent has attempted to
smuggle before this Court in his brief on the merits.

The

additional question relates to the exhaustion of state remedies ,
We would submit to the Court that this case reflects

19

no reason whatsoever for this Court to depart from its normal
policy to disregard a question when it is not properly before
this Court, was not presented to the court below, and if
accepted by this Court itfould alter rather than affirm the
judgment of the court below.
Additionally, substantively the argument is without
merit.

The. petitioner has presented to the state courts a

claim substantially equivalent to the claim presented to the
federal district, court.

This is the test set forth in the

respondent's brief and in the Fifth Circuit case in Lambert! v.
Wainwright, clearly under the exhaustion doctrine of repeated
applications to the state courts are not necessary, and the
mere possibility of success in state court, in light of the
facts of Chambers v. Mississippi, are no bar -- is no bar to
federal relief in this case under this Court.Js decision in
Wilbexding.
QUESTION:

But it was raised in the Fifth Circuit,

wasn't it?
MR. BEUMMER: It was not raised in the Fifth Circuit
before the panel which decided — which entered the judgment
which is before this Court.

It was raised in a supplemental

brief after the decision was made by the panel when the Fifth
Circuit tentatively agreed to hear the case en banc.

The

court subsequently vacated the order granting the hearing en
banc and no action was ever taken en banc.

The court reinstated

20

•the panel decision and the panel decision in no way could have
related to the exhaustion argument.
QUESTION:

Now, but really what I am saying is that

your due process argument certainly was advanced below?
MR. BRUMMERs Yes, there is no question -— that was
the only question that was raised below.

The respondent’s

exhaustion argument was not.
V?® would respectfully request that this Court reverse
the judgment of fch© court, below.

I would respectfully reserve

the remainder of ray time for rebuttal.
QUESTION;

Mr. Brumraer, before you sit down, we

talked yesterday a little bit about the fact that these letters
are no in evidence, the ones that you rely on.

And in the ex­

amination of the wife in the court below, when the letters were
offered the court, after looking at one or two of then, said,
counsel, what you have shown me is a bunch of leva letters to
her husband from a girl who loves her husband, no matter what
he has done* it says so.

Can we accept that characterization

by the court as a correct description of what is in the letters?
MR. DRUMMER;

No, you cannot, Your Honor,

The

letters clearly reflect that the wife wrote to the petitioner
saying they don't understand how I can still love you, but they
all think you did it.

the district court, the district court accepted our averments
as to the contents of those letters on the basis that -QUESTION:

material what your averments ar©?

Linda was not at the store during the afternoon of April 14,

That5s correct, and that is exactly what

the defense counsel tried to ask her on the stand.

It was may­

be tha third question out of his mouth on approximately page
35 of this appendix.

that Gary Maness did not” -- and he was cut off in mid-question

MR. BRUMMER:

and still grant this petitioner relief.
Your Honor, the prof £er of Dana Maness' testimony
supports the exact sam© contentions that are raised in the
letters, that the petitioner was rot guilty and that Linda knew
it and -that Linda was not at the store at the time the baby was
injured as sh® had testified from the stand.
tions.

The same allega­

Th© letters ara merely corroborative in a sens© of

Dana Manass5 testimony, which is before th© Court in the proffer
on pages 123 and 124.

And we would submit that that, coupled

with the inability to cross-examine Linda Maness is sufficient
to warrant granting this petitioner relief.
QUESTION:

DM you proffer the letters themselves?

MR. BRUMMER:

We did not, Your Honor.

The trial

judge, however, precluded —- was willing to look at those letters
and exclude them without any admission.

She mad® it quit© clear

that there was no sense in the petitioner's counsel persisting
because she was not going to let those letters into evidence in
any way.
QUESTION:

Wall, how does th© reviewing court evalu­

ate the trial judge's exclusion without examining th© letters?
MR. BRUMMER:

Your Honor, the letters are only sup­

portive of our general claim.
QUESTION:

Well, how does a reviewing court know that?

MR. BRUMMER:

Because we made allegations to that

fact in the federal district court, which is th® court where th©

25
respondent could have called into question —- neither the
respondent nor the court, called those into question.

As a

matter of fact, the court adopted those characterisations.

That

is how you know.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Brummer, 1st me ask on® more question.

Justice Powell has showed me the appendix to your motion to
supplement the record in. the; Court of Appeals in which you did
quote from at least on® of the letters.

And in one of those

letters there is the statement "Nobody can understand why I
still love you, but then they all think you did it.”

That is

what you said before.
MR. BRUMMER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Now, can you tell me whether that letter

was one of those that was shown to the trial judge at the trial?
Is there any way we can know whether -that is on® of those
letters?

Is there any way we can know which two letters were

shewn to the trial judge?
MR. BRUMMER:

Your Honor, there ware not just two

letters shown to the trial judge, the petitioner's counsel said
”1 have a bunch of letters."

The trial judge said let me see

the one that you have there, and then she excluded all the
letters on the basis of the voucher rule.
QUESTION:

But he refers specifically to one love

letter to her husband from a girl who loves her husband, no
matter what he has done.

It says — his characterisation is

26

quit© different from the impression one gets from the language
you emphasize.

The an.sv;@r I suppose is the record really does

not tell us which letters were shown to the 'trial judge.

The

whole bunch was handed to him, but which one h© was referring
to, w© do not know, because none were marked at the trial?
MR. BRUMMER:

I suggest that the Court might look at

page 88 of the appendix, which identifies — page 88 of the
appendix — which reflects —
QUESTION:
Your Honor,

He says i have a whole bunch of letters,

The Court, "1 just want to see the on© we ara

taIking about."
MR. BRUMMER;
QUESTION:

That is what the trial judge said —

And T am just trying to figure out which

one you were talking about.
MR. BRUMMER:

April 28, 1971, approximately at mid-

page, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BRUMMER:

But it is clear on that page, he has

a whole bunch of letters and he makes every attempt to have
those letters introduced into evidence.
QUESTION:

Well, every attempt is something — I

think you perhaps would have done a better job.
MR. BRUMMER:

Thank you.

If possible, I would like to

reserve some of my time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Yes, you can reserve.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR JOEL BERGER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
My Hama is Arthur Joel Berger, counsel for the
respondeat, Louie Wainwright.
Your Honors, petitioner's argument in this case is
predicated on a mischaraeterization that solely because of an
arbitrary finding that Linda Maness was not an adverse witness,
that, the trial court, pursuant to Florida statute 90.09, kept
numerous facts from the jury which would tend to establish a
doubt of petitioner's guilt.
Petitioner then relies on Chambers as the legal basis
for his relief.

The respondent submits, Your Honors, that

under a proper characterization of what in fact occurred below,
four concepts resolved this case, and that th@s© are the crucial
concepts with which this Court must filter the various factual
matters which it has before it.
The Stats of Florida has no problem with this Court's
decision in Chambers.

But the factual situation in Chambers,

Your Honors, is materially different from that situation which
this Court is presented with in the instant case.
In Chambers, the defendant was precluded from

23

introducing -- dynamite, highly probative, quality, reliable
evidence, evidence of his innocence.

But in this case. Your

Honors, the evidence which was excluded was smoke screen, was
innuendo evidence, on which petitioner sought to confuse the
jury.
QUESTION;

But it wasn't excluded on that basis, was

it?
MR. BERGER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

There were

numerous rules of evidence which sustained the trial court's
rulings in exclusion.
QUESTION:

But it wasn't — the trial judge didn't

us® those reasons?
MR. BERGER:

Yes, Your Honor, I am merely suggesting

I will subsequently get into the reasons why this occurred.
QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

Oh, wall, I -X merely am stating that one© you see

the situation factually as it exists in this record, that you
will be able to see that what petitioner is setting up is a
smoke screen, and he wishes to analogize that smoke screen to
th© solid evidence, the dynamite evidence that Chambers had
which so concerned this Court.
Thus, Your Honors, Chambers was decided not only on
evidentiary principles but, most importantly, as Justice Powell
emphasized in his opinion, was decided on ths totality of the
circumstances that were before this Court when it rendered its

29

Chambers decision.
The second concept: wa ask you to filter — and we
subsequently get to the facts of what actually occurred in this
case — is that in Chambers this Court took painstaking efforts
to clarify one proposition* that the state and the defense must
still follow the rules of evidence.

And those rules of

evidence* Your Honors* that this Court required both sides to
followf the rules which in fact are based on theory that these
rules enhance the integrity of ‘the fact-finding process.

This

Court did not hold in Chambers that every evidentiary ruling
bee ones a constitutional question because of whether that rule
of evidence enhanced the truth-finding process.
This Court did not state that the mere preclusion of
any etvidence denies due process if it in some way hampers the
defendant in presenting his case or from creating some doubt
of guilt.

If such were the test* Your Honors, which is

essence what the defendant is saying to this Court, if such
were the test there would be no rule of evidence which could
withstand a due process attack.
In this respect, Your Honors, the Maness situation is
directly opposite the rationale of Chambers, in that Maness the
rules of evidence which kept out the evidence were rules
designed to insure the integrity of the truth-finding process.
The third concept we ask you to look at in this case
are where wa get to fch© facts --

30

QUESTION:

Mr. Barger, you characterise the voucher

rule as such a rule?
MR. BERGER:

Your Honors, we note what this Court has

said in Chambers, but we do subnit that th© voucher rule has
one very important fact purpose with regard to integrity of
the truth-finding process, and that is that it precludes con­
fusion of th© jury.
QUESTION:

It precludes —
In other words, you characterize the

voucher rule as such a rule?
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, it does -So your position is not that th© voucher

rule didn't have any impact but, rather, that the voucher rule
is a good sound rule?
MR. BERGER:

No, Your Honors.

We will suggest later

that this case does not turn on the voucher rule at all.

As

we have indicated, the petitioner has mis-characterized the
situation.

H© tries to create a simple picture before this

Court that th© voucher rule on this evidence would come in.

Bui:

we submit that, in spit® of our position or in our position,
that other rules of evidence, rules which no doubt can -QUESTION:

Well, would it not bs correct to say that

the trial judge did in part rely on th© voucher rule -MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Y©s, Your Honor.
-- and your point is that h® had other

grounds on which he might have relied --

31

MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor» but we don't —
but you don't really know whether he

would have relied on those grounds had he not based his ruling
on the voucher rule?
MR. BERGER:

Well, Your Honors, as we will show

clearly, the only purpose of the voucher rule is primarily
state objection.

There are some indications in the record that

the court was merely stating, well, you have got to show that
this witness was adverse, but you will sec*, in reading this
transcript that the crucial portions of this record — which
we will get to very soon — that the court ~
QUESTION:

I think Wigmore contains a statement that

many jurisdictions follow a rule that on appeal, where a
challenge is made to the exclusion of evidence, the trial
judge's ruling will be upheld if thera was any basis upon
which the exclusion, could have been properly sustained, even
though the reason assigned by the trial judge was not a correct
one.

Does Florida follow that rule, do you know?
MR. BERGER:

Yes, Your Honor, in those cases which

Florida follows, are cited immediately after our citation to
the same stated in cases by this Court
QUEST ION:

Is all of this argument before -the Court

of Appeals?
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

15m sorry. Your Honor.
Is this position taken in the Court of

32
Appeals, the position you are now arguing?
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Which position, Your Honor?
That there were other reasons for — or­

are these fresh new reasons?

No, the

filed by respondent in this case directed generally to these
propositions, the exact theory, Your Honors, which we are pre­
senting to this Court in our brief, both grounds were presented
in the supplemental brief ordered by the ea banc court.

court, I am talking about the panel court.

QUESTION:

QUESTION;

Did you raise these arguments and make these points

when you argued to the three-member panel of the Fifth Circuit?

33
MR. BERGER:

I didn’t argue the case to the three-

member court.
QUESTION:

Well, you —

MR. BERGER:

W© did not. precisely take -these exact

positions.
i

QUESTION;

Mr. Berger, just to get something precise

before us, because it would help roe, toward the very beginning
of what counsel intended to h© an adverse examination of the
wife, h® started out, isn't it a fact that you know that your
husband Gary Maness — objection — did not ™ objection sus­
tained.

Counsel has represented to us that the intent of that

question was to represent or to ask if she did not know that
her husband did not. kill the baby.

Now, what was the reason,

what is the proper reason for sustaining that objection to the
leading question, other than tha fact that sh© was not an
adverse witness and therefore the voucher rule applied.?
MR. BERGER:

Well, Your Honor,

if I might rephrase

your question, what petitioner is asserting is that it was the
voucher rule that kept this out, and we ask Your Honors to
look very closely at Florida Statutes 90.09, 1971 statutes,
which says nothing about leading questions, Your Honor.

It

talks^ about adversity.
What this court did, which we will get to in on©
moment, is sustain these objections and expressly stated,
Your Honors, on page 85, the court said th© objaction sustained

She is your witness, ask her questions that are

not leading.

It didn't say you could not impeach her.

But, of course, to ask her questions that

You can ask leading questions of

It has nothing to do directly with the

The court was merely stating that.

QUESTION:

You have a right to ask leading questions

but it is rot at the discretion of the court if the witness is
adverse, so -the whole basis for the ruling is quit© obviously
that the court was not willing to accept th© view that she
should h© treated as a hostile witness .
MR. BERGER:

Am I wrong about that?

Well, Your Honor, I guess we differ on

that because my understanding is that this is a ruling --petitioner is trying to indicate a ruling totally on Florida
Statute 90.09, and that there is nothing in this statute which
indicates anything ©bout leading questions.

That is totally an

independent proposition.
The third concept which I wish to emphasise is this,
that the state trial court judge acted fairly to both sides in
this case.

It did not act arbitrarily whan it ruled, and it

did not abas© its discretion in any on© of those rulings.

35
Finally, the fourth and last principle we ask you to
look at before we go to the record in this case is this:
Assuming that there was any evidentiary error which this Court
finds in this case, that error does not run to the level of
denying petitioner an unfair trial, for three primary reasons.
If Your Honors will review the testimony of -the pe­
titioner, you will find, according to his confession, this
crime occurred around 4:00 o'clock.

The state obviously does

not know when the fatal blows were struck.

The petitioner, in

his testimony, does not state that h@ was not in the house at
4:00 o'clock.

In fact, his testimony indicates that he was

tli ©re.
QUESTION;

well, does not 'the autopsy of the infant

child show that the injuries ware over a long period of time?
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
They could not determine when the lethal

blows ware struck on the child's head?
MR. BERGER:

That's correct. Your Honor.

The

petitioner tells you that he was-- still at the house, in fact
during his entire testimony there was not on® statement in
this record during petitioner’s case in which he says Linda did
it.

There are © lot of inferences that petitioner wishes you

to draw stating that he said that, but unless petitioner turns
to the jury and tells them,

"My wife did it," how can any

evidentiary evidence that might have occurred in this court —

36
QUESTION?

Mr. Barger, right: ©a the first pag-a of the

examination, ’the question,
"No, I did not."

"Did you kill your baby?"

Answer,

Didn't that present that very point?

MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Well, we —
You don't think that gave the idea to the

judge that that was the defense's theory?
MR. BERGER:

Your Honor, what I am stating at this

point is that if petitioner, when he gets up there on the
stand and does not state "My wife did it," that that is a
totality in construing the totality of the circumstances.

It

is very important to determine whether if this Court finds any
evidentiary error, that this case constitutes a denial of due
process.
The second point is that the defendant never pre­
sented any secondary evidence other than his statements to in­
dicata in any way that Linda had at any time touched that
child.
The third point is that the evidence which petitioner
is complaining about now, -that he says was kept out, was not
highly exculpatory.

At best, Your Honors, this evidence was

directed toward a showing that Linda was not a credible witness,,
she might be a liar.

And furthermore, that sh© might have

bean present at the time of the crime.

But mere presence at

the time of a crime, Your Honors, is not, as petitioner would
have this Court equate, mad® a showing that Linda committed

37
this crime.
As we have indicated, this case turns on 15 pagas
in th© appendix, aj*d I ask t.h© Court to indulge me, if they
would, to look at th® appendix v;ith me to see exactly what
occurred at this trial and what the judge's rulings were.

QUESTION:
MR. BERGER:

Yes, that would be starting on page 85.

Now, I will let you get a seas© from the cold record of what
the trial judge was doing.

He has not even

So the court states that that

He immediately tells this court, before

any question is asked, that ha wants Linda declared as an
adverse witness.

But there is no evidence before the court to

indicate that sha is an adversa witness, and the court says at
this point that it is denied, because there is no showing.
Now he starts to ask another leading question.

Th©

prosecutor indicates something with regard to Florida Statute
90.09, but what doss the court do?

Does it say you cannot

impeach Linda because there is no way you are going to make a
showing that she is adverse?

The court says the objection is

sustained? ask a leading — I don't know whether h© is

not adverse.

The court is stating not now, she is

The court is not stating categorically that she

could never be impeached.
On page 86, counsel .starts to inquire, and the court
does not say you are not allowed to impeach Linda Maness be­
cause she is never going to bs an adverse witness and we are
cutting you off right now, such as was the situation in
Chambers, where in Chambers the trial court had all the facts
at that point.
What she is stating is just ask her questions that
are not leading.

Then we go down a little and we start the

testimony, and ona of the questions is, "With regard to a
foruis® that this baby had in the morning," the defense asks,
"how did that baby get the bruise on her forehead?"

Does Linda

Maness turn around and say, "Gary, my husband, did it."
Your Honors.

What does die say?

"I don’t know."

Mo,

It doesn't say don't impeach.

I understood you were

That is all the court says.
Because we have got to look at

what tli® trial judge is doing to petitioner in this ease.
On page 08 there is an objection with regard to hear­

Then the court says let’s

start talking about th® — the defense starts talking about a
latter dated April 28, 1371, this is a letter that isn’t
marked, h© just gets up there and says, "Read this letter to
the court," a letter that is not even introduced into evidence,
has not even been sought to be introduced into evidence„
Mr. Williams suggest that it is an improper predicate
and th® court sustains it.

What does th® court d© with regard

to this letter;in spite of the fact that it is not introduced,
in spit© of anything, this court bends over backwards and says
let me sda that letter you war® starting to talk about now,
th© specific letter, th® April 28th letter, white you wanted
to hav© read to the jury.
And this is done, as the court emphasises, noting
that it hasn't even bean marked for identification.

This

judge, Your Honors, is bending over backwards to try and be
fair to th® defendant.

She looks at that letter and she makes

an unchallenged ruling, after looking at teat letter, and
states that all this letter shows is that Linda Maaess loves
her husband, it doesn’t show adversity.
Then the court.asks, "Is there something you are

40
attempting to read to impeach this witness on?
no question asked along these lines."

There has been

That is an indication.

Your Honors, not that petitioner will never b® allowed to
impeach, but just that this court, having heard no inconsistent
statements, states not now.
We then proceed on, and the court says, "You can’t
get this letter into evidence unless there is something she
says that is contrary.

If you want to impeach by an incon-

slatent statement, you have to have some statement for which
tbs evidence you are going to us® is inconsistent."

This is

not a trial judge that is saying you can never impeach because
of the voucher rule.
The defense counsel says, wall, I have got another
latter, may I show you this letter.

Th® trial judge, that

they would have you believe is acting arbitrarily in keeping
out all this evidence, says,
also."

"Okay.

I will look at that letter

She categorizes an objection again on th© basis that

it is leading, not that petitioner Maness will never b©
allowed to impeach.

And all th® court says is that everything

you have shot®, me, and obviously in this case petitioner never
showed, all these letters.

But the court never said I will

never look at all these letters, I will look at everything
you5 v© got.
Th® court says, "All you have shown m© is a bunch of
love letters so far.

This is not an adverse witness yet.”

Then

41
Mr. Minkus says something -that, will b© vary important in thi3
Court’s review of tikie.se, various items of evidence, h© explains
why he wants to us® these letters, not as substantive evidence
of guilt, but he says on page 90, he says, "These letters can
com© in for impeachment."

And what does fch© court say?

Th®

court says you can never use these letters for impeachment.
This court judge did not preclude arbitrarily the impeachment
of this witness.

Sh© says, “But there is nothing to impeach

yet, there is an inconsistent statement.”
The court then says something that is quite contradietory to the impression that petitioner wishes you to get of
the trial judge’s actions, because right afgar this, this
colloquy occurs;
"The Court.;
"Mr. Minkus;

But there is nothing to impeach?
Could I call her as an adverse witness?"

And what does the court say to the state;

"Do you

Sh® is not precluding him at this point.

Then all sh© says right after that is, "Well, let’s pass on
the issue .right now.

Let's go back to the original question

you were asked, and if there is something to impeach, w© can
come to it.”

And she says I think this is the best way to do

it.
Then petitioner talks about some statements of the
police or some statements with regard to h@r being out of the
house.

And all the court says is that at this time sha is not

that 'what occurred at this trial is a precluding of his ability
to impeach because of Florida Statute 90.09.

QUESTION;

Well, just sticking with that for just a

moment, Mr. Berger, you've pointed out that the court said
just above on pag© 91, sh© hasn't said anything for you to
impeach, and Mr. Minkkus said, "Well, sh© said that sh© was out
of the house at the time that the baby was supposedly beaten.”
Now, she bad said that before the jury.

"And I have evidence

her© that says that she wasn't," and then the court wouldn't
let him us© that evidence, relying on the voucher rule, as I
understand it.

Isn't that correct?

I®. BERGER;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
So that particular purported contradiction

in ths direct testimony as to whether ©r not she was present

44
when the child was allegedly bsaten, that was a contradiction
that ms excluded on the voucher rule, and it really went to
the heart of the whole case, didn't it, as to whether or not
she was present then?
MR. BERGER;

Well, Your Honor, at that time, and the

court was merely stating that it had no evidence before it that
sh© was adverse.
QUESTION;

Yes, but then Mr. Minkus pointed out that

QUESTIONS

What is th® rule of evidence in Florida

MR. BERGERs

Your Honor, rules contained in Florida

Statute 90.03 —
QUESTION:
MR. BERGERs

Well, what is it?
—• that statement says before the .last

49
proof can b© given, and that is a prior inconsistent statement,
the circumstances of the statement sufficient to designate thm
occasion must be mentioned to the witness and he must be asked
whether or not he mad® the statement.
QUESTION?

But what I want to know is whether the

prior statement is admissible only for impeachment or is it ~
MR. BERGER:
Honor.

Oh, I see what you are getting at, Your

Florida law provides that if you hava impeaching evi­

dence, that evidence cones in only for impeachment unless that
particular piece of evidence also is admissible substantive
evidence under rules of law.

We have indicated in the remainder

of our brief, which we weren't able to get to, that there are
numerous rules which preclude this evidence from coming in as
substantive evidence, even though on this record, Your Honors
will note, there is no indication that —
QUESTION:

Well, let's just assume that it is an out-

of-court statement of the witness, a third-party witness, who
testifies to something in court and then the examiner wants to
introduce into evidence an out-of-court prior statement incon­
sistent with this same witness.
MR. BERGER:
QUESTION:

Oh, I sa®.
Let's assume that it. is admissible, is it

admissible only for impeachment cr not?
MR. BERGER:

No, Your Honor.

The procedures that

would have to b® employed in. this case is that the normal

50
impeachment type of examination would have to occur.

Following

that? counsel mast mark for identification and seek to introduce
that evidence as substantive evidence itself? not just to show
contradictions.
QUESTION:

Is it admissible for its truth?

MR* BERGER:

That depends on the evidence.

As 1 in­

dicated before? and I am sorry if I wasn't clear? then the court
must rule on this piece of evidence as it would any other piece
of evidence? if it is admissible.
QUESTION:

So if it is hearsay? it is hearsay? it is

not admissible?
MR. BERGER:

Exactly.

It would be used for impeach­

ment but if it is clear hearsay it could not be admissible as
substantive evidence if the parties sought to admit it as sub­
stantive evidence and told the court that it wanted that
evidence admitted as substantive evidence in addition to impeach­
ing evidence.
