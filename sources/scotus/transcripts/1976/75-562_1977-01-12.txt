MR„ CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ur. Sonosky, you nay oroeeed whenever you are ready.
Mr. Sonosky, it may be futile, but T am going to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN J. SONOSKV, EBO.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. RONOSKY:

Mr. Chief Jvisfcice, nenbers of — nay

it please the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

The question

before the Court is whether three-fourths of the Rosebud Sioux
Indian Reservation in South Dakota has been terminated by three
statutes adopted in 1904, 19f7 and 1910.

Each of those statutes

opened a portion of the Reservation and provided for the sale
of unreserved and unallotted land to settlers at prices fixed
in the statute with the proceeds of the sales -- and this is
important — to be credited to the Tribe in the Treasury only
as received from the settlers.
Rosebud Sioux Tribe is a part of the Great Rioux

4
Nation, one of the important American Indian bribes,
is an on-resident population of about 7,000.

There

Their history,

the rrenesis of the Reservation ones back to the 1860 Treaty
when the United states and the Rioux acrreed to the establish­
ment of the dreat Rioux Reservation which embraces all of
South Dakota west of the Missouri Rives:, about 25 million acres.
‘"he !nreaty providet! that this reservation would be
secured to than and never anv part of it would be taken from
them without the written consent of at least three-fourths of
the male adults.
In 1877, nine years later, the United States took
7 million acres of the Reservation.

That left about 18 million

acres.
In 1888, the United 8tat.es enacted the statute of
that year to which the Sioux aareed with the three-fourths
maiority and half the land, rouahly, about 9 million acres,
was explicitly restored to the public domain with the provision
that it would be. disposed of and the proceeds credited to the
Tribe and — this is important —■ at the end of ten years, any
of the land left, the United States would make a balloon pay­
ment and pay for all that was undisposed of.

As to the other nine million acres, that was divided
into six reservations, all. for the Sioux Tribe.
One of those six reservations was for the Rosebud
Sioux Tribe.

5

The 1989 Act provided for allotment and the allotment
process went forward shortly after the 1889 Act became effec­
tive .
In the back of the preen brief, which is our opening
brief, there is a map about the era of 1913 which shows the
Reservation as established by the 1889 Act.

It includes,

starting from the eastern end, portions of Orenory and Lynan
County.

Then Tripp County.

Then Mellette County and Todd

County.
Now, these counties of course all came after the
Reservation.
QUESTION:

How many counties are there in Couth

Dakota?
MR. CONOSKY:

X don't knew how many counties there

are in South Dakota, your Honor.

I am sure the Attorney

Oeneral may be able to tell you.
QUESTION:

All right.

OUECTTON:

You mean, these came after 1889?

MR. SONOSKY:

It is not important.

After the 1989 Act, they were organized.

The — as I said, the allotment process went forward.
In 1901, the United States undertook to take a
section, an outright purchase, to buy the eastern portion of
the Reservation, parts of Gregory and Lynan Counties.
And an agreement was negotiated in that year which
provided for the outright session, sale, conveyance and

surrender of the land, about 450,000 acres, as 1 recall, for
a lump sun of one Trillion, forty thousand dollars and the
Indians consented to that, again, three-fourths majority.
And the agreement provided that it would not be
effective until the Indians consented cind until it was ratified
hy Congress.

It went to Washington and it was sent to Congress

for ratification.
The House was willing to adopt a simple ratification
bill but the Senate insisted on two amendments, one of which
was to grant the state all sections 15 and 36, the school
lands and the other one was to open up the lands for free
hornsteads.
There was resistance to this on the ground that since
we paid tax money for this Indian land, we ought not to be
giving it away and it failed.
Ultimately, there was a compromise and the 1904 Act
was enacted and the 1904 Act, which is set up in our brief,
in the Appendix to the green brief, page 1-a — the 1904 Act,
the format of that Act is vazy interesting because the Act
itself provides that the lanes should be opened and disposed
of at the statutory price and the proceeds credited to the
Tribe only as received from the settlers.
But the Act opens by setting out in the Preamble,
]■': eceding t^ta enactment clause,

14e J_'yi)agreement, just as it

had been consented to by the Indians and then comas the

7
enactment clause and. then follows the agreement again, except
this time they leave o\it one article.

It is amended.

They amend the agreement to strip it of the article
that, required the Indians' consent and the ratification by
Congress and they make another amendment which was,

"We aren't

going to pay you one million forty thousand dollars for it.
What we are croincr to do is open up this land and dispose of it
and as it is sold, the proceeds will be credited to you only
as received."
That was the 1904 Act.
and Lynan on the eastern end,

That took care of Gregory

Incidentally, the best land,

of course.
In 1907, before the Indians had received —
QUESTION:

Hr. Sonosky, was the land under the 1904

Act ultimately sold?
ouESTICW*

To private people?

MR. SONOSKY:

To practically

my recollection is

that practically all of it was sold.
QUESTION:

And were the proceeds of those sales

credited to the Tribe?
HR. SONORKY:

Yes, the proceeds of those sales were

credited to the Tribe.
In 1907, before they had received any money from the
sales of these lands, the 1907 Act was passed and opened up
Tripp County in the same way, the same type of statute.

We

8
refer fco then as surplus land statutes on the theory that they
were surplus to the Indians9 needs and they were disposed of
to the settlers and the proceeds credited as received.
In 1910 was a third statute which covered Mellette
County and that left Todd County, which was never affected by
a statute although efforts were made to obtain a similar
statute for Todd County,
Now,, each one of these three statutes provided,
except for the 1904

Act, provided for allotment.

In the 1904

Act, the allotments had already been made because it started
out as a session.

It provided for allotments to all Indians

in the area to be opened before it was opened and each one of
them provided for a errant to the state of the school sections
16 and 36.

The United States paid for that land, $2.50 an

acre.
And the statutes a?so provided other benefits but in
order to make absolutely clear that the United States was not
buying this land, that the Indians were not selling this land,
that the United States was not paying for this land, each one
of these statutes in the last, section -- and you can take any
one of them, the first one or page 6a — provided that nochincr
in the statute shall in any manner bind the United States to
buy the land.
The United States was not a purchaser.
It went on to say, and the United States doesn't

guarantee to find purchasers for this land and it went on to
say it again, that the United States, all it is doing here is
acting as a trustee to open up this land and dispose of it and
credit the

Tribe with the proceeds only as received.,
QUESTION:

Now, to pursue Mr. Justice Rehnquist's

question, was that carried out?
find buyers?

Did the buyers pay?

Did they from time to time
Did the money go to the

Tribe?
MR. SONOSKY:
up and it was disposed
zation

Yes, your Honor, the land was opened
of until 1934 when the Indian Reorgani­

Act was passed at which time Congress provided that any

lands in this type of Reservation that were undisposed of
should be restored to the Tribe and at that time there was
%

restored to the Rosebud Tribe all undisposed-of land and there
were undisposed-of lands in Tripp County

and Mellette County.

I just don't remember if there were any in Gregory
County.

And at the same time that was restored to the Rosebud

Tribe, it was also restored to some 2G other tribes who fall
in the same category.
QUESTION:

Does the state argue that those restored

lands are outside the Reservation or does it concede that they
are inside the Reservation?
MR» SONOSKY:

I am sure the state would not argue

they are outside the Reservation because they are within the
exterior boundaries of the 1889 Act and the Indian

10
Reorganization Act limited the authority to restore only to
reservations„
Nov? we are in 1910

As far as the Bureau of Indian

Affairs was concerned and the Department of the Interior, this
entire area as fixed by the 1889 Act was administered as an
♦

Indian Reservation and the Tribe itself regarded all the
people who lived within those boundaries as living on the
Reservation.
In 1953, Congress passed what to Indians is the in­
famous Public Law 280 which authorized the state to

take

jurisdiction, or Indians or a Reservation, without their
consent and the State of -South Dakota in 1962 undertook to do
that by an Act ot the Legislature but the people in the State
of South Dakota within the Referendum repudiated that Act and
set it aside by a vote, as I recall of almost four-to-one.
QUESTION:

I uiiders rood in the brief that South

Dakota is not a PL280 state».
HR. SONOSKY

South Dakota is not a 280 state

because that failed.
QUESTION:

Because of that Referendum.

MR. SONOSKY:
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. SONOSKY:
QUESTION:

Because of that referendum.
I see.

Or otherwise, it would have been.

But it is not.

MR. SONOSKY:

It ±£ not.

11
QUESTION:

They decided against it and it never has

been ever since.
MR. SONOSKY:

I mention it only because the same

interests that were moving

that law continued to feel the same

way and there was harassment and the state and counties con­
tinued to enforce their laws aoainst Indians living on the
Reservation and finally, this suit was instituted in the Un’ted
States District Court for the District of South Dakota and the
complaint alleged — and I mention this because it defines the
only issue that is before the: Court.
The complaint alleged that the state and counties
were enforcing state laws against Indians on the open portions
of the Reservation and that the state had no authority to ask
for a declaratory judgment to that effect.
The state answered and admitted that it was enforcing
the laws only on non-trust land within the open areas.
The District Court rendered a judgment which was very
broad

The judgment appears on the red Appendix to the Peti­

tion page 114.
The District Court herd that the three acts in
question did excuse the Reservation or Indian land nature of
the unalrotted surplus lands in said counties by returning them
to the public domain and did diminish the geographical location
of the boundaries of the Reservation.
On appeal, the Court of Appeals after the case was

12
submitted in oral argument, leld the case until this Court
came down on this decision in PeCoteau v. County State Court
[PeCoteau v. District County Court1 and after PeCoteau came
down the Court of Appeals rendered its opinion and it held that
these three *— that first was the 1904 Act* that the 1904 Act
ratified the 1901 agreement and that it was a cession, that
the 1907 Act used the identical language of cession as did the
1904 Act,

There is no language of cession in the 1907 Act.
And that the 1910 Act used identical words, whatever

it was meant.

It didn'r say words of cession, but identical

words.
And it held that the Reservation had been terminated.
How did the Court of Appeals come to the conclusion
that there was a cession?
A cession is a sale.
a sale between sovereigns.

It is a high-class sale.

It is

To have a sale, you have to have a

seller and you have to have a buyer.
a buyer, you lave an agreed price.

If you have a seller and
Then you have a sale and a

cession.
Section six, the last section of these three surplus
land acts, says in so many words that the United States is
not buying this land.

They tire not even guaranteeing to find

buyers for this land.
All we are doing here is agreeing to dispose of the
land and credit the proceeds and there are reservations, if the

13
Court please and in particular, the Wind River Reservation
where the sane type of statute opened the land and only a little
over 10 percent of the land was ever sold and the other 90
percent, after the Indian Reorganisation 7vct, was restored to
the Tribe.
How could the Court reach that?
The Court assumed there was a cession.
fundamental error of the Court Below.

That is the

Nowhere in those

opinions is there any explanatiori of how title got out of the
Tribe into the United States and how do the courts below square
their action with the language in the last section of these
statufces ?

They don11.
QUESTION:

there?

Mr. Sonosky, can I interrupt you right

You referred to the 1934 Indian Reorganisation Act and

I understood you to say that pursuant to that statute, the
unsold lands were restored to the Tribe.
MR. SONOSKY:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

But if your theory is correct, why weren’t

those unsold lands already the property of the
MR. SONOSKY:

Tribe?

They were the property of the Tribe.

They were the property of the Tribe.
QUESTION:

Well, then —

HR. SONOSKY:
left the Tribe.

Beneficial title to those lands never

All that happened is that those lands were

subject to a statute that left them open for disposal but

14
until they were disposed of, the Tribe regained the beneficial
owner»

Proof of that is that this Court held in United Statas

versus Creek Nation, which is cited in our brief, where there
was a mistake made by the United States surveyor in the line
of the Reservation and he put Reservation land out into the
Public Domain and it was disposed of by the United States and
when the Tribe sued to recover, for just compensation, the
question arose as to when did title pass?
It didn't pass whan the erroneous survey was made
because that was the mistake of a federal officer.

The United

States is not responsible for that.
But when the patent was issuert to the entry men,
title passed and values were determined as of the date of the
issuance of the patent.
The same thing is true here.

As a matter of fact,

each one of these Acts provides that until that entryman does
all that he is required to do in terms of residence and settle­
ment and pays for the land, he has nothing.

Thus when an entry-

man failed, his entry was cancelled and the statutes, each of
them provides the land goes up acrain for sale.
Beneficial title never left the Tribe. •• If it had
left the Tribe, instead of restoring the land to the Tribe, it
would have taken an Act of Congress to convey the lands from
the United States to the Tribe.
QUESTION:

May I ask you this question, Mr. Sonosky?

15
If the agreement that had been reached between
Inspector McLaughlin and three-quarters of the adult members
of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe back in 1901 had been accepted in
the form in which it was negotiated and written* would that
have been a cession?
MR, SONOSKY:

Yes, your Honor.

That would have been

a cession and we said that in our brief to the. Court of
Appeals before this Court came down with DeCoteau because
there was an agreement,
i

QUESTION: And very clear words of cession, weren't
they?
MR. SONOSKY:
QUESTION:

In the agreement.

MR. SONOSKY:
agreed

price.

Unmistakeably clear words of cession.

In the agreement and there was an

The Indians were transferring their land and

the United States, was giving them one million forty thousand
dollars for it.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SONOSKY:

And chat was DeCoteau and that is what

DeCoteau stands for.
QUESTION:

Right.

And if that agreement had been

effectuated you can say that that would have been a cession
under DeCoteau or you say you concede then to the Court of
Appeals before DeCoteau.
MR. SONOSKY:

Before DeCoteau

16
QUESTION:

And in the 1904 Act, the Congress, the

Senate and the House of Representatives purported to accept,
ratify and confirm that agreement but then they said, "As here­
in amended and modified" and that is your case.
MR. SONOSKY:

Yes, and the amendment was to strike

the consent and ratification and to eliminate the — well, they
might as well have just thrown it out.
what they were really doing was to make sure that the
opposition understood that they were not spending tax money
for land and this xs the format they adopted but in Mattz ver­
sus Arnett, in .Seymour versus

Superintendent, which is by

contrast to DeCofceau, the situation that we have here, where
there is no sale, there is no buyer, there is no agreed price,
the land was never placed in the public domain, Indian title
was never

extinguished and the Reservation boundaries were

never terminated or affected and that is the controlling
principle for the Rosebud case.
QUESTION:
Mr. Sonosky?

May I ask you another question,

Supposing we were persuaded, or the statute

expressly provided that upon the sales over a period of time
the individual private citizen who would buy the land through
the government as trustee far the Indian, that as these parcels
were sold, the Reservation would be diminished to that extent
and that you therefore have a gradual diminution of the boun­
daries rather than the wholesale diminution that the lower

17
court found.
Would that he constitutionally permissible?
MR. SONOSKY:

X have no doubt that it would be

constitutionally permissible because the power of Congress
over Indians is so broad.
QUESTION:

The reason I ask you this, some of the

legislative history, as I read it, would be consistent with
the Congressional understanding of that being what was actually
going to happen where they talk about diminished Reservation
and changed boundaries and the like.
MR. SONOSKY:
QUESTION;

Yes.

But I realize that is not the theory of

the court below or the government's theory.
MR. SONOSKY;

No,

And since then we have had a

statutory definition of Indian country and it includes all
land, trust, or non trust.
QUESTION;

Thc.t is 18 USC 11 —

Well, that is for purposes of criminal

j uriediction.
MR. SONOSKY;
in all cases.

Except that this Court has applied it

It has not made the distinction.

The Court has

applied it in all cases.
The Court applied it in Matts; v„ Arnett and Seymour
versus Superintendent and the reason for it is that they just
got sick and. tired of having lav/ officers running around with
an abstract of title in their property to find out whether

18

they were or were not on trust land.

It is pretty hard to

figure that out even when you are living on the Reservation
and in order to permit

effective prosecution of the laws,

that was done.
Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Sonosky.

Mr. Farr.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, ESO.
ON BEHALF OF U, S. AS AMICUS CURIAE
QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, before you commence, will you

help me understand the facts situation?
The main issue, as I understand it, is the boundary
of the Reservation.
MR. FARR:

That is right.

QUESTION:

The location of the boundary.

the land within the disputed area?

Who occupies

Do Indians still occupy

part of it?
MR. FARR:

There are Indians within the disputed

area but I think the area is largely occupied by whites who
purchased or successors of the people who purchased the open
lands.
QUESTION:

Right.

And the principal interest of the

Indian Tribe, as I understand it, is whether the Tribe or the
state exer rises jurisdiction within the disputed area.
MR. FARR;

The Tribe arid the Federal Government ox1

19

the state, yes.
QUESTION'S

Right.

jurisdiction legally?

Well# who, in fact, has exercised

What laws have prevailed within the

disputed area in recent years?
MR. FARR:

How far back?

Well, this is a question which I think

the record is unclear on, Mr. Justice Powell.

Essentially,

the United States, as the United States understands the posi­
tion — of course, net having been the party to the suit
throughout, there has been some exercise of jurisdiction by
the state, they having taken the position that this is land
outside of an Indian Reservation to which their jurisdiction
applies.
QUESTION:

Have state criminal laws been imposed or

enforced within the disputed area?
MR. FARR:

I believe that the state has, you know,

gone ahead and imposed state criminal law as well as, though,
I think the Federal Government and the U.S. Attorneys have
also imposed some federal lav but there has basically been a
kind of working relationship in this area.
I am not sure how much of this is reflected by the
record but I think as a practical matter that is generally
what has been happening.
QUESTION:

All right.

Just one other question.

We

are not concerned with the individual title of any particular
parcel of land, are we?

20

MR. FARR:

We are not.

QUESTION:

Just the boundary of the Reservation.

MR. FARR:

That is right.

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. FARR:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The United States :.s appearing this afternoon as
amicus curiae is support of the position of the Rosebud Sioux
Tribe that the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit should be reversed.
We think that unde::- the principles set forth by this
Court in previous cases, particularly in Seymour, Matts and
DeCoteau, that it is clear that the acts of 1904, 1907 and 1910
did not disestablish the boundaries of the Rosebud Sioux
Reservation in the areas to which they applied.
I would like to note briefly at the outset one
important general point.

In suggesting that Congress did not

disestablish the boundaries of the Reservation in the early
1900*3, we do not mean to imply that Congress expected that
those boundaries and. the boundaries of comparable reservations
were going to continue indefinitely.
We agree that in the early 19D0!s, Congress contem­
plated at some period of time that the Reservation system
would, in fact, come to an end but wa

believe that time was

when the trust period on Indian allotments expired and the

21
assimilation of Indians and white settlers on the lands had
been accomplished.
QUESTION:

And in your view, it would have taken an

Act of Congress later, then, to —
HR. FARR:

That is correct.

Congress at some point

would have found that the assimilation had occurred and would
have passed an Act abolishing the Reservation.
At that point, all of these lands and all of the
people on it —- except if the Federal Government wished to
retain jurisdiction over the Indians — would have gone within
state jurisdiction.
In 1934, however, as the Court is aware, Congress
reversed that policy when it passed the Indian Reorganization
Act and definitely extended the trust period on the Indian
allotment.
I will discuss that more briefly in connection with
the General Allotment Act of 1887.
Because this case involves an issue of statutory
interpretation, the United States does not urge or perhaps
even believe it is possible for this Court to lay down a
binding fixed rule that would govern construction of acts in
all similar cases.
However, we do believe it is appropriate for this
Court to reaffirm the principle that except for the language
of an act or the compelling legislative history, shows a clear

22

intentior» by Congress to contract Reservation boundaries and
linit federal jurisdiction over certain areas of Indian
reservations, that whenever Congress without a binding agreenent opens lands to white settlers, it does not pay for then
and does not guarantee any payment but only agrees to act as
trustee for future uncertain sales and leaves the property
interest in the Indians — as they did in this case -- that
act does not remove the lands from the boundaries of the
Reservation.
As this Court said in Seymour, discussing an act
with very, very similar terms, the purpose of the 1906 Act is
neither to destroy the existence of the Reservation nor to
lessen federal responsibility or jurisdiction over the Indians
having tribal rights on that Reservation.
low, this principle that Congress did not

intend to

disestablish the Reservations is not one that the government
has made ro out of whole cloth.

It is supported both by

history and by the previous decisions of this Court.
To begin with, it is well-recognized that the Tx.1
are entitled to rely on certain rules of statutory construction.
In particular, doubtful expressions are to be resolved for the
benefit of the Indian.

N

Mora particularly, in cases of these types — of
this type, the intent to disestablish Reservation boundaries
*

must be made clear, either from the Act or the legislative

23
history and as this Court said in Rice versus Olson, the
policy of leaving Indians free from state jurisdiction and
control is deeply rooted in the nation's history.

All of these

rules of construction apply to the case at hand.
Equally important
QUESTION:

Mr, Farr, may I interrupt you?

MR. FARR;

Certain.ty.

QUESTION:

As I understand the geography, we really

are not talking about very many Indians because all of the
unsold land has been restored to the Indians and all the land
which was sold was sold to whites.
MR. FARR:

Isn't that right?

Well, those facts are true, yes.

But in

terms of the area in which we are talking about, we are talking
about a considerable area of land in which Indians will either
be able to move within federal jurisdiction or will be moving
within the state jurisdiction and of course, Indians do have
allotments within those open areas.
QUESTION:

Within the open areas.

MR. FARR;

Yes.

QUESTION:

But could you clarify one thing?

They do.
What

percentage of the — what portion of this total land was
restored in 1934?

How much of the original reservation is in

dispute?
MR, FARR:
I have no idea.

I would love to answer that question but

24
QUESTION:

The record does not tell us, j take it.

MR. FARR:

No.

QUESTION:

But these would be probably noncontiguous

parcels, wouldn’t they?
MR. FARR:

They would be little islands.

They are likely to be, ricrht.

I mean,

depending on the settlement practices and who defaulted and
who did not, the lands that would be left available would be
likely to be individual tracts.
QUESTION:

That is correct.

One more last question.

Does the record

tell us how many Indians live on the lands in dispute?
MR. FARR:

I believe that there is a figure stated

in one of the opinions below that — I think that the Reserva­
tion covers about 7,000.

I chink that the areas that we are

talking about, the counties -.hat we are talkincr about, the
number of Indians is somewhere around 1,600 or 1,700.

I think

that is reflected in the record.
QUESTION:

I see.

And those would be Indians that

reacquired lands or now occupy lands which were originally ■—
MR. FARR:
...... ■

Well, not necessarily.

Again, they may

f

be Indians who were allotted lands at the time that these areas
were opened.

When the areas were opened, Indians were first

given an opportunity to select allotments within those areas.
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn’t, by virtue of those

allotments, wouldn’t that land be Indian country?
MR. FARR:

That land is Indian country.

25
QUESTION:

There in no dispute about that.

MR. FARR:

No, I don't believe so.

QUESTION:

How man]-' Indians occupy

there is a dispute?

land over which

Do we know that?

MR. FARR:

I do not know.

QUESTION:

And there would be very few, would there

MR. FARR:

Well, I don’t know how many there would

not?

be, but I think -- I might just say that the principle, I
think, extends further than that because jurisdiction, if it
only applies on allotments, the Indians, any time they step off
their particular allotments onto territory that is owned by a
white settler may at that point be subject to state juris­
diction and that is something that clearly the Indians

do not

want and which is an interest we feel that we ought to protect
in this caseTurning- to the General Allotment Act of 1887 briefly —
QUESTION:

In other words, the nonreservation land

can bo and is Indian country if it is owned by the individual
Indians.
MR. PARR:

That is correct.

That applies in ---

QUESTION:

And by the same token, or the other side

of the same coin, within a Reservation there can be fee simple
and non-Indians.
p;R.

FARR:

Well, there can be fee simple and

26
non-Indians in terms of land ownership,
QUESTION:

That is what I mean.

MR. FARR:

No question.

However, for purposes of

jurisdiction -—
QUESTION:

Well, we are talkinc? now about the geo­

graphic boundaries of the Reservation.
■ MR. FARR:

That is correct.

Now, the definition of

Indian country, just to make sure that 1' have answered your
question properly, the definition of Indian country in 1151
includes all areas including patented lands within a Reserva­
tion within Indian country and also, Indian

allotments outside

the boundaries of a Reservation within Indian country.
QUESTION:

So within a Reservation, land owned in

fee simple by non-Indians is still Indian country.
MR. FARR:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Do you know what the relative proportion

of whites and Indians is in --.he area that is disputed?
MR. FARR:

If my memory serves me correctly,

Mr. Justice White, I think there are somewhere around 15,000
whites and 1,600 Indians.
QUESTION:

16,000 whites and 1,600 Indians.

MR. FARR:

I believe that is correct.

We also believe, in addition to the presumptions
that T discussed a minute ago, that the General Allotment Act
of 1887 has — that the policies and objectives of that are

21
consistent with the principle that an act such as this does
not disestablish Reservation boundaries.
Although Respondents in their brief have continually
turned the General Allotment Act on its head saying that it
embodies the intent of Congress to disestablish Reservations,
this Court has considered that precise question in several
recent cases and found the opposite intent and we believe the
Court correctly identified the intent of the General Allotment
Act only last term in 'doe versus Confederated Salish and
Kootenai Tribas, in which you quoted from Matts:

with approval

the following language:
’’Its policy, that of the General Allotment Act of
1887, was to continue the Reservation system and the trust
status of Indian lands but to allot tracts to individual
Indians for agriculture and grazing.

When all the lands had

been allotted and the trust expired, the Reservation could be
abolished.

And that is the Act of Congress that I said in

answer to your qxiestion, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Unalloted lands were made available to non-Indians
with a purpose in part of promoting interaction between the
races and of encouraging Indians to adopt white ways.
QUESTION:

When was that Act?

MR. FARR:

That is 1887.

QUESTION:

!S7.

H R. FARR:

Right

23
And in facte Respondents have said that this Sioux
Act* in fact, followed along from that general plan.
We think that that indicates that the Court has
recognized an intent to retain jurisdiction and control

over

those lands during the trust period with the consideration of
whether to end the Reservation to be made at a later time when
the assimilation had occurred and we think the Court has noted
that even more specifically in the cases in which we very
heavily rely on in our brief, Seymour and Mattz arid' also in
DeCouteau, which distinguishes both cases in a case where sale
was made for a sum certain and an agreement was made, as counsel
for the Tribe has discussed.
in addition to these guiding principles, we also
feel that the legislative history and the administrative treat­
ment that we have set forth in our brief supports the position
of the Tribe.
The remaining question then is, what is there
sufficient to override this in the materials that the Court
has before it?
Most importantly we call the Court's attention to
the fact that there is nothing in the Act that says specifi­
cally that jurisdiction over these areas was to be given to
the state.
In fact, I think, as a reading of the legislative
history shows, Congress was really not concerned with the

29
-jurisdiction at this point*

The pressure on Congress was to

open up lands for white settlers for two reasons, one, the
settlers wanted the lands and two, the counties wanted a
greater tax base»
Both of those objectives could be met perfectly
comfortably by'Congress by opening lands within the Reserva­
tion boundaries without sacrificing the principles of the
General Allotment Act of 1887 which was to continue the
Reservations durina the period of assimilation.
QUESTION:

Well, could the counties tax white-owned

lands within the Reservation?
MR. FARR:

Yes.

I don't believe that there is any dispute about that,
but that was considered at that time and I believe, even now,
would be considered land than is within the power of the state
to tax.
in DeCofceau, in fact, discussing the — this particu­
lar conflict of policy the Court said, in 1887, the General
Allotment Act was enacted in an attempt to reconcile the
government's responsibility for the Indians' welfare with the
desire of non-Indians to setele upon Reservation land and wa

/
submit in this case that the best way to reconcile those and
the way that Congress did reconcile them throughout this
period was to continue the Reservation system but open white
/

lands so that they would have a taxable bases for the county and

t

30

the whites would have the additional lands.
For those reasons, as my time is getting short, I
will close and simply suggest that the decision of the Court
of Appeals should be reversed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Thank you,

Mr. Farr.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. JANKLOW, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
GEN. JANKLQW:

Mr. Chief Justice and may

it please

the Court:
If I can, before beginning here, start out and refer
again to the map that, frankly, is in the brief of the Tribe
for the Appellant in this case because there were several
questions by members of the Court concerning the areas.
This particular area where my left hand is over is
Gregory County which is affected by the 1904 Act.
This particular area where my hand is now over is
Tx’ipp County, South Dakota which is affected by the 1907 Act
and where you see these two counties stacked on top of each
other, or I should say, one on the other, the top county is
Mellette County which is affected by the 1910 Act.
There is absolutely no dispute in this case with
respect to Todd County.

31
Both the State of South Dakota, the Tribe, the
Federal Government —* I think it is the only time we have ever
all agreed — we clearly aaree that that is an Indian Reserva­
tion even though there is fee-patented lands on it.
We feel that that :.s the type of situation that the
Court was addressing in Moe when it construed the subsection
6 of the General Allotment Act and not subsection 5 of the
General Allotment Act or subsection 12 of the Act of 1889 so
when the Government a moment ago was responding that this is
the situation in Moe, the Court construed subsection 6 and it
is this type of Reservation

t

the Todd County area, which is

abhorred as the checkerboard kind of problem that the Court

,

has addressed itself to before.
That is not the situation with respect to Mellette,
Tripp and Gregory,,

There has been sv,me questions by members —

QUESTION:

What about Lynan?

CRN. JANKLOW:

I'm sorry.

Lynan was —-

Lynan County is this small

little area.
QUESTION:

Part of Lynan went in the 1904 Act.

GEN. JANKLOW:
QUESTION:

Included with Gregory.

GEN, JANKLOW:
sorry, I missed.

That, is correct, sir.

Thai: is correct.

Lynan County.

I'm

It is just a small little corner up there.

QUESTION:

General, in Todd County, is fee-owned land

subject to county taxation?

32
GEN. JANKLOW:

Fee-owned lands in Todd County are

subject to county taxation.
QUESTION:

But is the fee-owned land subject to

tribal jurisdiction?
GEN. JANKLOW:

Well, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, that

is something that was frankly washed over by the government.
•The Rosebud Sioux Tribe has passed an ordinance which provides
that they have jurisdiction, civil and criminal, over every­
body within Todd County,
QUESTION:

What about —

GEN, JANKLOW:
areas.

Excuse me, within all four country

It is of recent vintage, this particular one is.

As

a matter of fact, it is about the time this lawsuit started
but their law and order cone now provides that they have civil
and criminal jurisdiction over everybody within — we call it
the four-county area even the ugh Lynan County would make it a
fifth.
QUESTION:

That includes taxation.

GEN, JANKLOW:

Thai: — they don't say that.

Their

law and order code provides that they have jurisdiction over
everyone within the

Act of .1889, which is this area and it

has been approved by the United States Department of Interior
as a valid tribal ordinance of recent vintage also.
QUESTION:

Let me ask you this.

Do you concede the

power of the tribe to exercise civil and criminal, jurisdiction

33
over all of Todd County?
GEN. JANKLOW:
Indians.

Absolutely not with respect to non-

But that is clearly not the issue in this case.
QUESTION:

No, it isn't.

GEN. JANKLOW:
QUESTION:

We don't consider that at all.

.So there is no additional issue by what

you just told us in the rest of the case.
GEN. JANKLOW:

No, sir.

Now, the question was also asked in the disputed
area, and we will call that — it is three and if I say three,
I really near, three and a part of fourth or four, but in the
disputed area the question was asked whether or not the Tribe
has exercised jurisdiction.
The Government responded they believe everybody has
been exercising jurisdiction
I defy anybody any time since 1904 to show any case
that the Federal Government has ever handled in the federal
courts with respect to non-Indian land in Gregory County, that
since the Act passed in 1907 with respect to Tripp County and
with respect to 1910 with respect to Mellette County.
There is litigation with respect to the Indian lands
because what we have in the old Reservation, there were
Indian allotments that were taken and under 1151 subsection C
of Title XVIII of the United 3tat.es Code, there is no argument
by the State of South Dakota that that is clearly federal

34
jurisdiction and for all we care, it is also the Rosebud
Sioux Tribe's jurisdiction.

Every place there is an. Indian

allotment in these three counties, this is what you call the
"checkerboard."

It is what you have insisted and what you have

in some other places but the important thing, although this
Court has repeatedly said that it abhors checkerboard juris­
diction, we have lived with it and we have lived

with it

comfortably in the State ot South Dakota with respect to these
three counties since the turn of the century and we have not
had a problem.
It has never been up before this Court before.

There

has not been a prolific amount of litigation in the Court of
Appeals or even in the Federal District Court.

I think all of

the cases that have ever been involved in a jurisdiction fight
are cited in either the Government's brief, the Tribe's brief
or or. bnei ar.b \:iiu«.re very few or them, probably eight or
nine in number.
And there has never been a dispute and we have
worked comfortably with jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Very little.

General Janklow, what percentage of the

total area would you estimate is undisputed Indian country?
GEN. JANKLOW:

In terms of three counties because I

don't have figures for Todd.
QUESTION:
counties.

Right.

I am just talking about the three

35
In terms of the perspective, Todd County is a little
better than 25 miles wide and 50 miles long so —* and this
would foe a close facsimile of what the size is — but it is
approximately 10 pereant of the land area in Mellette, Tripp
and Gregory Counties are Indian trust lands and that is all.
And approximately 10 percent of the population in
Mellette, Tripp and Gregory Counties are Indian people and it
is split as to where they live.
Some of them live on trust lands and some of them
live on deeded lands.

The Tribe has never, until 1972, even

attempted to exercise jurisdiction.
If for no other reason, 1' can tell you, I lived on
that Reservation for six years as director of the OEO legal
Services,

I was the chief of the Legal Services under the OEO

Program down there.
QUESTION:

General , what about deeded land that is

lived on by an Indian?
GEN. JANKLOW:

Deeded land in those three counties,

the Tribe has never exercised jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Even though occupied by an Indian.

GEN. JANKLOW:

Even though occupied by an Indian.

There has never been anything ir. the Tribal Court.

There are

thousands of divorce cases that have been handled, adoptions,
guardianships, probates —
QUESTION:

And then:: land figure that you gave me is

36
allotment.
GEN. JANKLOW:

It is allotted or I call it Indian

Trust.
QUESTION:

Indian Trust.

GEN. JANKLOW:

All right.

That would include'

allotments but

also land that is not allotted that is in Indian name.

I

would include that in the total.
QUESTION:

Was this where the Tribe was initially?

(SEN. JANKLON:

The original agency was Rosebud

Agency.
QUESTION:

But I mean, were the Indians moved there

from some other area or was this their ancestral home?
GEN. JANKLOW:

The eastern end of the Rosebud

Reservation consisted of Brule

Sioux which was added to the

Rosebud's Reservation with their consent and I do not know all
that history.

But I do know that they are not all Rosebudders

although they are all Rosebudders now.
But the Tribe has never exercised jurisdiction and
the Federal Government never has either in those areas so what
we have in terms of — if you want to just talk jurisdiction,
115.1 takes care of it.

It is subsection C with respect to

those individual pieces of Indian land in the three-county
area and it is subsection A :: believe which is any land within
the area of Todd County, whether it be deeded or on nondeeded
land.

37
All right, so the Tribes filed a lawsuit and we are
now here.

A couple of important, not distinctions but charac­

teristics of how we construe these things.
There are three basic cases that I think everybody
concedes lead the way.
Seymour.

The first one is the decision in

The second one is the decision in Mattz and the third

one is the decision last year involving our state also,
DeCoteau.
In Mattz and Seymour, both of them, this Court
handed down a rule of construction of these Indian treaties
and these Indian statutes that are passed and it said, you
look on the face of the Act and if it is net absolutely clear,
if it is not expressly clear from the face of the Act, you go
to the legislative history and surrounding circumstances and
this Court did that in Mattz when it wrote the Mattz decision.
It found that the Act, there was some question about
it, went behind the face of it.

As a matter of fact they found

that there was no question about it and still went behind the
face of it and used legislative history and surrounding circum­
stances to support the decision.
They did exactly the same thing in DeCoteau and in
the DeCoteau decision they also cited Seymour and Mattz again
with approval.
How, what we have with respect to the Rosebud Sioux
Tribe case is not unlike the case that was up here last year

38
before you and that is the D&Coteam casa»
The language is the same in the
convey»5'

Act,

That is exactly what Sisse ton had.

difference between DeCotean and this case.
lands are there.

"cede, sell,
There is only one

Even the school

The only difference is that this is un-sum

certain and there is a great distinction to be made about that,,
In the DeCoteau ca.se, the Tribe was told and knew
exactly

what they would be paid for their land and in this

particular case the Tribe was told that they would be paid so
much for the entry on the first so many days.
In other words, the best land would go first so it
would be like ?4, then $3 for everybody who came after that
and then $2 for everybody that came after that and then no
guarantee as to all of it being sold.

That is this last

paragraph,
QUESTION:

But the entire area really wasn't sold,

was it?
GEN. JANKLOW:

The entire area?

I think the figure

was, it was asked of Mr. Sane sky, it is approximately 4,000
acres of this total huge mass was returned in around 1934,
the 1930's.
QUESTION:

Well, the 4,000 acres ware not sold,

apparently.
GEN. JANKLOW:

I think it is approximately that.

New, I don't know

30

QUESTION:

Those words you were referring to didn't —

certainly didn’t mean that that entire area was sold and
conveyed at that time.
GEN. JANKLOW:

I don't follow your question, I’m sorry,

Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Where are you readinq the words you just

read to us?
GENC JANKLOW:
QUESTION:

I didn't read anything.

Yes.

GEN. JANKLOW;

"Sold and conveyed," did you say?
oh, "Cede, arant, sell."

Is that what

you mean?
QUESTION:

Yes.

GEM: JANKLOW:
QUESTION:

No, what area did that refer to?

GEN. JANKLOW:
QUESTION:

That is the first Act, the 1901 Act.

That referred to Greaory County.

Well, was there ever any land that was

not sold to somebody in Grecrory County?
GEN. JANKLOW:
Gfocrorv County.

To mv knowledge, land was returned in

Now, one thing that you have to remember is —

OUES'AION:

<r-e point you are making, though, is that

those words, you sav that those words meant that there was sold
to the United States the entire Gregory County at that time.
GEN. JANKLOW:
QUESTION:

There was —

At that time.

GEg. JANKLOW:

No, not sold to the United States.

We

40
are not aliening that it was sold, per se, to the United States.
QUESTION:

Welly when was it sold?

When was it sold,

under those words?
GEN. JA.NRLOT'7:

Under the agreement that was sicrned?

It was as of the time the Congress passed the Act.
What we have in the Act, and it is really confusing,
because they went out ann they entered into an agreement with
the Indian people in 1901 and that was the first part.

That is

the part that talks about cede, grant, sell.
The Indian people agreed and signed it by a threefourths majority.

They came back and Congress didn't buy it

but the best thinn I can do is draw your attention;there are
three volumes of Appendices, Joint Appendices filed plus we
have our own that is filed with the Court and it

goes all

through this exhaustively.
There is an incredible amount of legislative history
that has been able to be dug up.
QUITS';.

AT:

Are you suggesting that as of the time

the Act was passed, that that entire area was, what?

Ceded by

the Indians?
GEN. JAUKLOW:

The Gregory County area, that is

correct.
QUESTION:

At that time.

GEN. JANKLOw:

QUESTION;

At that particular time but. they ..

The entire area.

41
GEN. JANKLOw:
OUESTTON:

No, in Gregory County,

Nell, all rirrht, all of Gregory County.

GEN. JANKLOW:

The entire area, sir?

No, sir.

All

the surplus and unallotted lands are what they nave up but also
renlete in there is, there was a restoration to the domain and
as a result, the only thing 'hat the Indian people kept were
a lingering beneficial interest and that is what is discussed,
the Government has discussed that, what took place in 1934 and
this Court has also addressed itself to that in the Ash Sheep
case which this Court has previously handed down and in the
Ash Sheen case they said that these kinds of things kept, a
lingering beneficial interest»
The one thing that has not yet been previously told
to this Court, in 1938 the*Solicitor has handed down an opinion
which is set forth in document number 59 in the Appendices.
QUESTION:

well, to whom did the Indians cede

Gregory County in 1904?
GEN. JANKLOW:

They ceded it to — see, if I can —

I don't want to back myself into a cession corner because that
is not the key question.
Mr. Justice White, the key question is, whether or
not the Reservation was disestablished and that is always what
this Court poses.
QUESTION:

But you are relying rather heavily on the

lancmage which you just read»

42
HEN. JWKLOt'7:

T-Tell'4 only because this Court said

that language is precisely suited for cession in DeCoteau.

I

have taken that exactly from what this Court said a year ago
in DeCoteau.
OUE^TION:

I can't find that lancuace in the 1907

and the 1910 Acts.
GEN. JANKLOXJ:
Acts.

It is not in the .1907 and the 1910

It is only in the 1904 Act.
OUESTION:

And it r.s in the 190 4 Act, not by anything

signed by the Indians out it is signed by Congress.
'GEN. JANKLOm:

There are two things I would like to

sav to that, sir.
OUT! 9 TI on ;
he signs it.

Normally, when a grantor sells something,

There it says, "The said Indians do hereby cede,

surrender, grant and convey to the United States all their
claim, right, title and so on" and then that is enacted by
Congress.

That is not signed by the Indians.
GEN. JANKLOW:
QUESTION:

Right, there's —

There ins quite a little difference between

this and DeCoteau.
GEN, JANKLON:

There are two things I would like to

draw your attention to, sir.

The first thing is, on pages 41

of Petitioner's brief — and we aoree — the 1904, the 1907 and
the 1910 Acts may use different words hut Congress was intending
the same thing.

They have the same force and effect.

43
Me don't a roue that Greoorv, Tripp and Mellette or
the 1904, 1907 and 1910 have the same effect.
believe, used by Petitioners say

The words, 1

they concede the format

.is different but not the substance.
The 1904 in
the 1907 and 1910.

legal effect of language is the same as

We agree with that.

All right, now, specifically, to get onto the 1904
Ace, I think it is really important that we understand what
happened•.

in 1901 a Commissioner was sent out there.

He made

an agreement with the Indian people for Gregory County.
:

CRN. JANKLOW:

Inspector McLaughlin.

Thau was Inspr.otor McLaughlin.

is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

He came back.

That

Then the

bill was submitted to congress for approval what happened was,
there was

huge ficrht that erupted.

Not a huge fight but

there was a disagreement in the Congress.
The key thing was, several of the eastern Congressmen
were tired of givincr free land tc the homesteaders.

They

wanted them to pay for it and they were tired of the Government
paying the Indians for the land and then turning around and
oivinrf free homesteads so they got into this issue and this is
where it all came to a head in America *s history of free home­
stead versus paid homestead.

It was over, unfortunately, the

Rosebud Reservation.
find so the bill did not pass.

44
Then a bill passed which provided — and I believe
it was the next year or the year after —• no, they got into a
discussion on the homesteads and they sent Inspector McLaughlin
back out to the Rosebud aaain.
OUESTION:

And he couldn’t get three-quarters of

them to sign.
GEN. JANKLOW:

He could not qet three-quarters, but

he crot a majority»
OUESTION:

Right»

SEN. JANKLOW:

At this particular time.

Three-

quarters was not required by Section 5 of the General Allot­
ment Act —
QUESTION:

Under a recent decision of this Court.

GEN. JANKLOW:

But it was — that is correct.

But

it was decided, it was required under the Act of 1889.
QUESTION;

I mean a then-recent decision.

GEN: JANKLOW;
down.

All right.

Then the Lone Noli came

mhe Lone Wolf decision came down in 1902, which cante in

right in between the time the Indian people first signed the
Act and had the three-fourths; signatures and the next time
around when they signed it in 1903 or 1904.
In the Lone Wolf decision this Court very clearly
took care of the problem of signatures being required for
disestablishment of Reservations or anythincr else because what
is involved in the Lone Wolf case was a place where they

45
required three-fourths also by previous agreement and the
Government diet not get it.
Congress passed an Act,

They only got a majority and

The} went to the Supreme Court and

this Court held that Congress had that plenary power and that
they didn't have to stick to the three-fourths.
QUESTION:

Right.

GEN, JANKLOW:
QUESTION:
fact that
either.

But they could use a majority.

Your hypothesis, under Lone Wolf, the

they got a majority here doesn't make any difference,
If not one Indian had consented to it, Congress pre­

sumably still would have had the authority.
GEN, JANKLOW:

That is correct, your Honor.

Now, that’s —
I

QUESTION:

Nobody did consent to the 1907 and 1910.

Isn't that correct?
GEN, JANKLOW;

Then Congress, at the time that that

happenedr in the Lone Wolf decision,

they say that what you are

dealing with is the plenary power of Congress.
QUESTION:

Yes.

GEN. JANKLOW:

So as a result, these people turned

around and T>one folf said that Congress exercised this power
that it had without using it in a wise way or a judicious way.
They sent McLaughlin back out there when they never
held to.

He had then obtained the majority of the signatures,

fully explaining to the Indian people, and again, it is all in

46
the Appendices, the transcript, of just what Lone Wolf meant
and the power of it and the Congressional Records and the
House Reports and everything are replete with discussions of
what Lone Wolf meant.

So everybody knew what Lone Wolf meant.

He came back and then they passed it based on the
majority thing.
All right, now, with respect to 1907 and 1910, there
was no agreement in 1910 but there were meetings with the
Tribal Council but at that point in time,

nobody was ever

again signing agreements because of the Lone Wolf decision.
Lone Wolf did away with that particular necessity.
And you can go through the legislative history, you
know, and if you will examine the Government's brief and you
will examine the Tribe's brief, 'you511 find criticisms of what
went on in the Congress but you can’t find any substantive
legislative history and there are hundreds of documents that
pertain to it that are both, in the Joint Appendix as well as
in the individual Appendix.
draw your attention to the document at 629, I
believe it is, page 629 of the Joint Appendix, which is a
House Report, which just lays the whole thing out.

There are

about six pages there which just lay out in detail exactly
what it was that was happening and it lays out that these
reservations were being disestablished so, although I was

a,;ked the question before, the cession is not the key aspect,.

47
Whether or not there was a cession, frankly, is not
even relevant.

The question is, what was Congress' intent?

Did they intend to disestablish the Reservation?
Because if the answer is no, we have three new
counties in South Dakota that don't belong to the state, that
are part of the Rosebud Reservation which has been quadrupled
in size.
If the answer is yes, that Congress intended to dis­
establish the Reservation, then the answer is no.

We'll live

with what we have lived with for the last 60 years and so that
is the key issue.
That is the crux o:' it.

That is what Mattz has

taught us and, frankly, that is what DeCoteau has taught us.
They have laid down that particular criteria.
The uncertain sum ;.ir\the sum argument that has been
raised, thex-e is a lot of issue that because the Indians did
not know ultimately what they would get, that somehow this
uncertain sum created — completely substantively changed these
types of arrangements.
/

It is not clear.

All Congress was doing was

changing the method on how people were going to be paid.

That

is' the only thing that Congress was doing and they say that

During the period between the passage of the

statute, say the 1904 Act, and the actual conveyance of real

GEN. JANKLOW:

All right, under — all I can do — I

can't tell you that there is any magical point in time.

The answer would have been perfectly

clear under the contract that was negotiated in 1901.

The

United States would have owned it, wouldn't it?

Under the contract in 1901?

Yes.

GEN. JANKLOW:

It is not unclear at this point that

didn't get the title from an Indian.

That is the ones who gave them.

That is the one that was handing them

They were signed by the President and they were issued,

they said, pursuant to the General Homestead Act.

That is what

every natent out there says.
And so I can't say whether or not but that — if you

49
are familiar with the 538

I can’t describe it any better

than the 1938 Solicitor's opinion which does discuss this out
of the Ash Sheep case where it talks

about whether or not

this lingering beneficial interest, because he didn't know if
anybody was ever going tc move on it and buy it? whether or
not that is a crucial and important aspect.
And what they held is that that was not the deter­
mining factor,

Whether or not there was a cession was not

important and whether or not the Reservation was disestablished
or not was not important, that if there was a lingering bene­
ficial interest, that was not inconsistent with allowing the
Tribe to restore that to the area so that it would be outside
of a diminished or reduced Indian Reservation, restoring those
lands out in an area like that and still going on with their
business,

.ike we had in the Rosebud case.
What 1938 Solicitor' s opinion -just lays that particu­

lar aspect out,
with respect to the Ash Sheep case, the same thing is
true and I draw your attention to one thing in the Ash Sheep
case.

That involved a reservation which, although it had a

lingering beneficial interest, also disestablished part of that
reservation and created a new boundary.» right on the face of
the Act.
So there is an example of a place where we do have a
situation where new boundaries were created on the face of the

50

Act and the Indians still kept their lingering beneficial
interests in those lands like we had in Mellette, Tripp

and

Gregory Counties,.
QUESTION:

Well, when was the Reservation dis­

established, in part, do you say?
GEN. JANKLOW:

I don't know that there is a —it

QUESTION:

Well, which one do you say?

I think it is at the time that the

the Indian people and it was also explained to Congress, but
the Indian people were allowed to continue to occupy it,

GEN. JANKLOW:
QUESTION:

Three separate disestablishments.

GEN. JANKLOW;

But I don’t want to support that

position because I just — you can't tell whether the f.ioux
ever took it.
QUESTION:

Let’s suppose the very improbable that

none of the land was ever sold and the 1934 Act was never
passed and ricrht now, there had never been any sales of land,
nobody wanted it.

Except the Indians wanted it.

They were

Xivincr on it.
Under your position the Reservation nevertheless
would have been disestablished back in 1904.
GEN. JANKLOW:

That is just exactly what Congress

said over and over and over in its Congressional Record, over
and over and over in the debates, over and over: and over in
the House Reports.

There is just voluminous stuff and it is

replete with just exactly that, that the only chancre — that

GEN. JANKLOW:

We think this — that, and the 1938

Solicitor's Opinion which is found as Docket Number 59 in our
blue State's Appendices, which is on page 114.

Those are the

two ones that I think explain that "whole area that we have been

talking about for the last several minutes.
As far as what words are

used for disestablishment,

if you look at the cases, you see that we have everything from
the words,

"Cede, sell, convey, disestablish, restore to the

public domain, dispose, diminish."

-

Unfortunately, Congress never used any one set of
magical words and that is why every time that this Court has
been faced with this particular kind of question, whether it
was Seymour, whether it was Watts, whether it was DeCoteau or
now, that you have to go back and you have to look at the
legislative history and the surrounding circumstances as well
as the Act to figure it out.

GEN. JANKLOW:

Wr would also draw the Court's

attention to paces 99 through about 195 in the brief where
when you look at what are known as the Todd County Documents,
it reallv lays out what exactly all the understandings of the
parties were.
under Congress

It lays out what -— because what happened was,
power to disestablish these Reservations, they

could, have always cone forward and disestablished the Reser­
vation.

They went back for 1907.

They went back for 1910 and

the record is replete with the Indian people saying, "Look,

54
you came ones.

We crave you Gregory County.

Now you are back

here for more land."
And thin is in the meetings with the Council and
there are transcripts on this that are all through the records
that are before you.
Then he comes back in 1^10 and they say,

And he is tel liner them, "Look,

And then in 1010 he goes back and he tries to take
Tripo County.

He tries to open Tripp County and this is again

the famous Inspector McLaughlin, the great land-grabber,
because he is all over the western United States taking land
from everybody, especially poor Indians and he is back there

We gave you three-fourths

All this is in the record.
"That is all wo have left of our Reservation.

Please

don't take that from us,"
.And he went back, although he had been sent out to
negotiate another agreement, he went back to Washington and
told that to the Congress, told that to the Interior Department

55

and the Interior Department finally suggested to Congress they
not open up and effect Todd County in any way so there was no
change but as far as what the understanding of the parties
were, there has never been a misunderstanding of the parties,
be it the Federal Government, the Tribe or the State of South
Dakota, until 1972.
After the decision, frankly, the New Town decision,
which was an Eighth Circuit decision up in North Dakota, every­
thing really changed in the jurisdiction in South Dakota.
We have had litigation after litigation with respect

This one has

and the other one- Sissiton, has and Cook has bean decided by
the Eighth Circuit and a petition for cert has been requested
and nothing — no action has ever been taken on it.

56
Todd County hns ha/: other action taken.

As Justice

knows, we had the Heardslee decision where it talked about
disestablishment in that particular case, where, I believe,
the exact language is — where it discusses the areas other
than Todd County of the Rosebud and said "A disestablished
portion of the Reservation, however that disestablishment may
have been effected."
And this is the decision that rroes way back into the
'6Q5s, into the middle '60's.
There has never been any armament, disagreement or
misunderstanding by anybody until the policy chances.
Interestingly enough, we are here today against the
United States of

America.

In 1973, with a Reservation that

has cot exactly the same language as one of these Acts, exactly
*

the same Act

I should say language — United States ex rel„

Condo i versus Erickson which was another Eighth Circuit decision,
they are in there amicus on our side, on the «itate of South
Dakota's side and on the basis of the New Town decision, the
Eighth Circuit turns around and says that Condon — that the
Covernment's position was wrong.
Now they are in here sounding like, since time
immorial, they have taken the position that, our position of
the State of South Dakota.
In the La PXante case that the Eighth Circuit Court
of Appeals decided many, many years ago, 20, 30 years ago, I

57
can’t even rei^erber the date

manv, nanv, many years am, 20,

30 years aero, X can’t even remember the date, again, the
Federal Government came in and took the position that those
Reservations had been disestablished but to come in and argue
now in 1975 that this has always been the consistent policy of
the Federal Government is nonsense.
Unfortunately, we have to look back and see what
happened at the turn of the centurv because that is what
controls.

It is not what actions or who has been exercising

jurisdiction since then and we know that,
what controls is what happened at the turn of the
century.

Unfortunately, it :„s People's lives that are
Ninety percent of those people out there are non-

Indians and I am not imputing any bad motives to the Tribe and
X don't suggest that it was the white people who don't like
Indians or who want to harass Indians or, in the words of
Mr. Sonosky when ha started, harassment in these particular
counties, chase same forces that tried to take jurisdiction
are behind anything.
Those have not been the problems that we have had.
What we need, frankly, from this Court, what we need
from the Government, is a consistent policy because what
happens here and what happens: in the Congress affects us in
our daily lives.
People have investments out there, both Indian and

58
non-Indian.

People have their families out there, both

Indian and non-Indian.

We can't continuously be trading these

counties back and forth or charming our positions every 10 or
15 or 20 years and expect there ever to be a lack of problems
out there in that particular country.
They can talk all they wane about the problems that
we had but this is the same state that has set up an Indian
State Indian Task Force that involves members of that Tribe,
that hasn't — believe it or not, we have our own nego-HaHtm
committee on the state level

the only one in the Union to sit

down with these tribes and try and negotiate these problems
out but we can't do it if the policy of the Federal Government
is always going to change.
The important thing is, let's see exactly what
Congress intended at the turn ot the century.
3um certain is not an important aspect.

It may be

Important, as it frankly looks like it might have been in
DeCotean.

Until you get to look at the Rosebud documents,

unfortunately, Rosebud lays it all out as to what the sum
certain aspect was and all if was was a vehicle to facilitate
the change and they say that over and over and over and not
even the Indian people objected to that at the time that these
conversations went on.
everybody understood what happened.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN J. SONOSKY, ESO.
MR. SONOSKY:

1' have listened to the Attorney

General's conversation.

Much of it is assertion and not

supported by the record and not supported in fact and I would
indulge the Court not to give heed to these wide statements
that are being made.
We do have a principle established and it is
DeCoteau and

it is Matts and it is Seymour.

And if those

principles don't control, then every one of these 20 Reserva­
tions that we have found with, identical statutes to Rosebud
is going to have to be decided on the basis of things that are
extrinsic to the stature.

Court vrhat that last section of bur statutes meant where the
United States said it was not a purchaser.

don't buy it.

the Indians in 1903 and got a maiority vote but significantly.
Congress didn't put that in the 1904 Act.
