MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Plaute, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT PLAUT7I, ESQ.,

ON BEIIAIF OF mjrp RESPONDENT
or. PLAUTZ:

Nr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
My name is Robert Plau.tz, and I'm counsel for
petitioner.
This case concerns the assertion by the State of
Ohio that it can try twice, convict twice, and punish twice
one man for the theft of one 1967 Chevrolet.
The facts in this case are that petitioner
Nathaniel Brown 'was arrested, and in addition to beina
charqed with certain traffic offenses, the complaint that
was filed against him charged that he did unlawfully and
purposefully take, drive or operate a certain motor vehicle
without the consent of the owner of that vehicle.
The complaint ™
QUESTION:

Does that offense require proof of

intent to steal?
MR. PLAUTE:
QUESTION:

No, it does not, your honor.
Does the second charge recraire proof

4
of intent?
HR. PLAUTZ:

It requires proof of intent to

permanently deprive the owner of possession.
The complaint that was filed against him in the
first charge listed the name of the owner of the automobile,
and it listed her address.
Two days later, petitioner answered that charge.
He waived counsel, he waived trial bv jury, and without
any plea negotiations being entered into, he plead guiltv
to all of the charges that were levelled aaainst him.
He was sentenced to thirty days in the work house,
fined $100 and court costs.
Thirty days later, petitioner was leaving the
workhouse.

Waiting for him at the gates of the work house

were police officers.

These officers arrested petitioner,

and charged him with stealing the same motor vehicle that
had been the subject of the first charge.
This time the complaint that was filed aaainst.
him>

though, alleged the offense to be ten days prior to

the date that was alleged in the first complaint.
After certain procedural matters, petitioner
conditionally plead guilty to the chargethe express
understanding that a subsequent motion to

withdraw the

plea and dismiss the indictment on grounds of double
jeapordy could be filed.

The state agreed to this

5

procedure.
The motion was filed, the hearing was had, the
motion was denied.
Petitioner then was sentenced to six months
in the comity jail.

The sentence was suspended, he was

placed on one year probation.
Petitioner appealed his conviction to the Ohio
Court of Appeals Eight Appellate District.

That Court

affirmed the conviction, holding that two charges for
the same offense within the meaning of the double jeapordy
clause, applying this Court's test in Rlockburger.
And it said they were the same offense.

However,

because different dates were alleged in the complaints,
supposedly different crimes were committed.
QUESTION:

What if the Ohio legislature had, in

enacting the statute that prohibited the driving of a
car without the consent of the owner, put in a provision
that each day on which this offense occured shall be a
separate offense?
MR„ PLAUTE:
with that.

There would have been nothing wrong

Tliev cuulcl constitutionally charge a person

there with multiple counts provided they give the person
adequate notice that this was an offense.
I would cite examples of those types of crimes.
They are more — not really crimes of common law? emitting

6

noxious odors, each day is a —
QUESTION:
MR. PLAUTE:

Regulatory type of offenses?
Right.

Rut there also are — each

day you operate a gambling house, or some body house, or
some sort — whatever the statutes say.

Those statutes

give the accused adequate notice that each dav he does it,
he's going to get nailed for his misdeeds.

And also, in

•fecse instances, there are valid, srafee interests that the
state has in protecting an individual — protecting society
from that type of offense.
Now, admittedly, I'm sure, you know, Gloria Ingram
didn't feel any better by 'having her car — Gloria Ingram
was the victim — by having her car missing ten days as
opposed to only a few hours, but —
QUESTION:

Well, is there some constitutional

calculus that enables us to weigh the valid state interests
behind ordinances that prohibit the emission of
noxious fuiT.es as opposed to driving cars without consent.
Go that one might be a stz’ieter application of the double
jeapordy clause than the other*?
MR. PLAUTE:

Yes, I think you'd have to look at

the arbitrariness of what the state does with its statutes
when they apply them to the accused.

You could — well, in

a theft case , I was going to — getting into that later —
any theft case such as this, just because it was the alleged

7
differant datas in the complaint doesn't make it two different
crimes.

They could, have conceivably, under the Ohio Court

of Appeals opinion, have alleged —- filed ten complaints
against him, alleging different dates.

And it would have

been — just arbitrary just as on the face of it.

And I

would cite this Court's opinion in —
QUEST!OH;

What if 1 borrow your car on October

1st and say I’ll return it to you on October 2nd, and I
don't return it to you on October 2nd.

I take it under

Ohio law that on October 3rd, I'm guilty of driving without
your consent?
i

MR. PLAUTE;
QUESTION:

That is correct, your honor.
And the longer I put off returning that

car to you in accordance with my promise, don’t you suffer
a greater wrong?
MR. PLAUTE:
wrong.

The wrong — yes — not a greater

I'm being wronged.
QUESTION:

Well, you're losing the use of your

car for a longer period of time, in a very tangible,
economic sense, aren't you?
MR. PLAUTE:

Yes, but the State of Ohio hasn't

provided that each day I'm more aggrieved, as far as their
criminal statutes are concerned.

They feel that, you do

it. once, you d id it „
QUESTION;

Well, that goes to the question of

8
whether they provided that each day was a separate offense.
Bu.t I thought you were making the additional argument that
even if they put in such a provision , this Court would have
to weigh

how valid it was to make that kind of provision,

and how arbitrary the legislature had acted in doing so.
MR. PLAUTZ:

Oh, yes.

I would make that argument

if that were this case.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Plautz, what would you do —

MR. PLAUTZs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
— if they arrested a man for the

use of the car, and he explained, well, I was just a young
kid and I was going for a little joyride?
thirty days and sentenced.

And they find out later that

he's a leader of a stolen car ring?
could he?

And he's given

He couldn't he prosecuted,

Under your theory?
MR. PLAUTZ:

Those aren't the facts in this case,

but I would think that he could, if the second statute —
QUESTION:
first statute.

Well, I think I know enough about that

It wasn't meant to cover people who had a

car for tendays?

Am I right?

MR. PLAUTZ:
QUESTION:
MR. PLAUTZ:
QUESTION:
it's called.

It means —~
Am I right?
Admittedly, your Honor -It's a joyriding statute.

That's what

9
MR. PLAUTZ:

It's sometimes called joyriding,

That doesn’t mitigate —
OURSTION:

The kid says, I took it for a ride.

Mot ten days.
MR. PLAUTZ:

Your honor,, that statute does not

requii’e intent to permanently deprive the owner of
possession.

Admittedly# there are close cases.

Rut

under that statute# a person could have the car for as
long as a year.

And as long as ha doesn't7have informed

intent# all the elements in that statute are not proved.
Now# obviously, there does come a time when a
person dobs have a car for such a long period of time, as
a matter of law, it's a steal# it's not a joyride.
QUESTIONs

Well, couldn't,

a jury infer from the

recital of facts that you've just given that he did formally
intend to steal it when he kept it for a whole year?
MR. PLAUTZ:
QUESTION:
MR. PLANT”;

They could.
Without any —
They could.

But I'm sure if it had

gone to trial, they would introduce the confession that
the;/ did obtain from him within two hours after his arrest.
And in that confession he states that he did not have
the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession.
He was just going to take the car until he found a job.
Now, obviously, whether a jury is going to buy

10

that or not is another issue.

They could very well have

though.
The Ohio Supreme Court denied further State appellat
review in this case.
Now, there are three important facts to note
inthis case.

And first, as we've gone into, is that the

same automobile was involved in all of the charges.
Secondly, petitioner had no notice of that second
charge at the time of his uncounseled plea on the first
charge.
Similarly, petitioner was not given an opportunity
to defend himself on that second charge until after the
expiration of his first charge.
And finally, another important fact to note, is
that the second charge is alleged to have occurred prior
to the first charge.
Now, petitioner contends -—■
QUESTION:

It's not raised in any pre-trial

attack on the indictment?
MR. PLAUT55: Tour Honor, the issue that the Ohio
Court of Appeals decided this case on was not raised at
all in the two trial courts.
QUESTION:

I know.

question: did theychallenge
MR. PLAUTE:

But will you address my
the indictment

pre-trial?

Oh, yes, yes, your Honor.

11
QUESTION;

On this ground?

MR. PL MIT Z:
QUESTION:

On double jeapordy grounds.
On -- attacking this problem of the

date?
MR. PLAUTZ:

No, your Honor.

The reason was

that in the two trial courts — we had,really, two trial
courts, even in this same one — in the East Cleveland
Municipal Court and the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas
Court- both of those judges were concerned whether or not
they were lesser included offenses.

As fax as they were

concerned, if there were lesser included offenses, the
indictment had to be dismissed.
All the papers and motions and arguments in the
trials courts was focused on whether they were lesser
included offenses.

It made no difference about the dates

in the complaints.
We took the case up to the Ohio Court of Appeals.
In looking at the briefs in that case, all the arguments
were addressed to lesser included offenses.

And that is

why the Ohio Court of Appeals spent so much time in their
decision stating that it was a lesser included offense.
Then all of a sudden they came out with this decision
that it was because of the dates of the offense.
1' then filed a motion to reconsideration, timely
filed in that case, which I’m allowed.

I filed a timely

12
motion for reconsideration, stating that it was a continuous
offense.
today.

And that is why we have a diffpreent issue here
And we do not have the issue of lesser included

offense.
Because the Ohio Court of Appeals explicitly
held that it was a lesser included offense.
Now, in this case we are dealing with a State
statute —*
QUESTION:

But in effect it held — as I under­

stand their opinion — they held that this particular
operating of the vehicle without the owner’s consent was
not a lesser included offense of the stealing, because —
not the same act or same transaction at all.
MR. PLAUT7.•

That's the color they put on it.

The acts, the dates.
QUESTION:

Well, that's what they held.

In this

particular case, it was not a lesser included offense.
That’s what they held.
MR. PLAUTZ:
same offense.
is not.

Statutorily constructed, it is the

But as to the acts in the complaints, no,, it

They are supposedly two different crimes committed.
QUESTION:

Well, I know.

But it's just as though

the — two entirely different crimes were involved, as far
as they

are concerned.
MR. PLAUTZ:

Yes.

13
QUESTION;

Although operating a vehicle without

the owner's consent is a lesser included offense, you're
taking about the same day and the same car, in this case
they just held to the contrary.

They said it wasn't the

same act at all.
MR. PLAUTZ:

You're correct, your Honor.

Nov?, we're not asking this Court to interpret
that statute.

We're asking this Court rather to look to the

statutory interpretation of that statute given to it by
the Ohio courts, look to the conduct that is prohibited
by that statute.

Look to the conduct of the accused in

this case, Nathaniel Brown.

And then judge whether the

actions by the state of Ohio violate the purposes and
policies of the double jeapordy clause,
Now, that statute under which he was convicted
prohibits taking, operating or keeping a car without the
owner5 s consent.
The complaint filed against him charged taking,
violating or operating — now apparently the person who
drew the complaint copied the wrong form, because the
statute had been amended in March of *72.

But at any

rate it's never been alleged that nothing but —- the statute

in effect at the time of his arrest that he was charged
with.
Now, that statute covers all types of means and

14
methods in which one person can deprive another person of
dominion, possession and control of their property.

It

covers all types of situations in which that can occur.
Now, once the state prosecuted and convicted for
that conduct, for operating, taking and keeping that car
without the owner's consent, it was barred fromthereafter
prosecuting petitioner again for taking and operating
the same motor vehicle when there's been no

interruption

in his conduct.
QUESTIONS

I thought you had responded to one

question that intent -- proof of intent is not an element
of the so-called joyriding, and that proof of intent to
steal is required in the second?
MR. PLAUT2%
QUESTIONs

That is correct, your Honor,
Then, will you explain how they are

the same?
MR, PLAUT75:
QUESTIONs
MR. PLANT7, s

They are the same offense in that —
«lust because it's the same automobile?
No, your Honor.

Well, that had some­

thing to do with the evidence being introduced.

But once

they attach prosecution to his conduct: of taking, keeping
and operating the car, for as Iona as he was taking, keeping
and operating that car, once they attached that, they got
him for that entire conduct.
Applying then the same evidence test in this ~~

15
of this Court.
QUESTION:

Well# the criminal law doesn't punish

you just for conduct, does it?

If punishes you sometimes

for conduct and sometimes for conduct accompanied by
intent, a specific intent to commit a crime?
MR. PLAUTE s
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Well, you still have me lost.

MR. PLAUTE:

Once they qot him <6r the conduct,

they got him for the conduct as long as it lasted,
Applying then the same evidence test to the events
of November 29, 1973, at the very moment he may have had
that intent to permanently deprive this owner of possession
he was also taking the car, operating the car, and keeping
the car.

Ha was also doing that on November 29th.
Now, under the Ohio
QUESTION:

Perhaps he confided that to you, that

he had the intent all the time.

But on this record, how

dc- We find that out?
MR. PLAUTE%
QUESTION:

That he didn't have the intent?
On this record, you've conceded that

the prosecution had no obligation to show intent on the
joyriding charge,

but that it did have an obligation to

prove beyond a reasonable doubt the intent to steal from
a second, charge.
MR. PLANT2:

Yes, they would have — yes, and

IS
there was
QUESTION;

Not "If", they did, didn9fc they?

HR. PLAUTE;

Yes, they would have had that

obligation.
QUESTION;

Well, they did, and they must have

carried it out apparently, or you wouldn't be here.
HR. PLAUTE;

When — in plea negotiations being

entered into, I saw that a jury could have concluded that
this was auto stealing.

And I made that decision, and I

advised the client, and he agreed, and we plead guitly to
auto stealing.

)

And there was a confession obtained from the

individual within two hours after his arrest by the second
prosecuting authorities.

And that confession was made

available to me, and it was available in front of all of the
courts below.
Now, this Court need not expand on any other -- make
any new doctrines of constitutional law in this case.

It has

a test, it has the same evidence test, and just as this
Court added some refinements to it, I would say, in the
Waller case, barring multiple prosecutions from municipalities,
^

it must refine the test again andsay that it also applies
to continuous offenses, which, by their nature -—Now theoretically, under the Ohio Court of Appeals
decision, a. witness — even if it was at one prosecution, a
witness —■ a victim of a crl'4© such as a theft offense could

17
get on the stand, and the prosecutor could ask in direct
testimony — in this case it was Gloria Ingram — did you
®

give permission for the defendant to have the car on December
8 th?
No.
Did you give

permission for the defendant to have

the car on December 7th?
No.
December 6th?
No.
Fifth ■— all the way down to Noveiaber 29th.
I

Technically speaking, that is different evidence.
But on cross-examination, by simply asking the witness, did
you over have possession of the car at all during that period
of time, no, I think the evidence then, the complexion of
that evidence, substantially changes.

And it inherently is

the same evidence that he is defending himself against.
.

And the State

need not even bother — or with

the dates of the offense, by changing the dates of the offense,
they could do it for every hour or.every week, or whatever
I

the crime is they seek to — do. Jit the conclusion of a
larceny prosecution all they need to do is take .the
i

accusatory instrument, cross out the date of the offense,
put it in the typewriter, type

up anew date, and they have

a new crime, entitling it to a new trial and new punishment,

18

which has happened in this case*
Now, in the previous case that was argued, there were

I

some questions about, double punishment.
what happened in this case.

And that’s exactly

There is nothing to indicate

from the sentence that was imposed at the second trial that
it was in any way curative of the first sentence
that was imposed.

The first time around, he got thirty days

in the workhouse, the second time around, he got six months
in the county jail, sentence suspended, placed on one year's
probation.
QUESTIONS
I

Well, if you're right in your primary

argument that upon conviction of a lesser included offense
you cannot under the double jeaporcly clause even be
prosecuted for the greater offense, then the question of
punishment you don't get into.

It's a violation of the

constitution to even be charged with a great offense.
MR. PLANTS:

That is not entirely true, your Honor,

with regard —
QUESTION:

Wall, I thought that was your argument.

MR. PLAUTZ: ' My argument —
)

QUESTION:

I'm not saying it was true.

I thought

that was your argument.
MR. PLAUTZ2

That is not my argument, your Honor.

There are limited situations where

tine greater offense could

be subsequently charged, such as United States versus Dias.

19

This is not United States versus Dias„ because here , that
greater charge that .is alleged to have occurred prior to
the lesser charge, ten days before, and the State had adequate
notice that it occurred.

This is not something where an

element of the crime occurred after -QUESTION:

I thought you were making the same

basic argument that was made in the previous case, that the
double jeapordy clause, as a general rule, prohibited a
prosecution for a greater offense after a conviction for a
lesser included offense?
MR. PLAUTE:

As a general rule, yes, sir, but

there are exceptions which I've just mentioned, the United
States versus
QUESTION:

Well, are you making that argument

or not?
MR. PLAUTE:
QUESTION:

Yes, I am, your honor.

“

Well, then the matter of dual punishment

doesn't — you don't get to it.

If it's a constitutional

violation even to prosecute.
MR. PLAUTE

t

Well, that would be true.

But if

this court finds that they could have prosecuted for the
>££ense, he still was subject to the double punishment
then.

It's unclear from the Court's opinions here — it

seems that he’d have more of a due process argument than
a double jeapordy argument.

He still, nonetheless, makes the

20

argument that he was subject to a second punishment the
second time around.
QUESTION:

Well, another aspect of the double

jeapordy clause does guarantee against dual punishments
for the same offense.
MR. PLAUTZs
QUESTIONS

Yes, your Honor.
Well, the Ohio Court of Appeals’

interpretation of this statute as discussed by you in your
collogue with Justice White is upheld, and these are in fact
two different offenses, then not only can he be prosecuted twice
for them, he can be punished twice, Can he not?
MR. PLAUT2:

Oh, for sure.

thing falls, everything else falls.
in Blockburger and Gore.

For sure.

If one

Such as what happened

There’s nothing — would he nothing

wrong with consecutive sentences in that situation.

But

that was because the test in those cases were separate
offenses.

This is essentially the same offense.
QUESTIONS

Wall, what would you do if a man stole

a car in Ohio, and drove it to California, and they
picked him up in California for joyriding, couldn’t
Ohio try him for stealing?
MR. PLAUTE:

He would foe charged under the Cali­

fornia statutes for joyriding under their state statutes?
QUESTION:
MR, PLAUTSs

Yes,,
It would appear to me that the

present state of the law is that the State of Ohio could
prosecute him for auto stealing,
QUESTION:

And so the difference between that case

and your case is, both of them ended in Ohio.
MR. PLAUTZ:

Same sovereign.

Ohio Court of Appeals

made that explicitly clear, citing Waller v. Florida.
QUESTION s

And that9 s the only ground?

MR. PLAUTE:
QUESTIONS

Only ground for which, I’m sorry
For the double jeapordy point5 same

sovereign?
MR. PLAUTZ;
even Consider that.

Well, the Ohio Court of Appeals didn’t
It’s the same sovereign, yes.

Oh, yes,

of course, your honor.
QUESTIONS

Well, I'm wondering what you do in a

town like Texarkana, where the state line runs down the
middle of the street.
MR. PLAUTZ:

Well, I think the quote in one of the

cases, we're going to fritter away constitutional rights on
such metaphysical subtleties, something like that.
QUESTION;

I think your basic argument that I

have trouble with is that they knew that he

was guilty of

the major crime.
MR. PLAUTZs

They ~~ they had enough proof.

If

they wanted, they had enough proof within two hours after
his arrest

QUESTION:
MR. PLAUTEs

MR. PLAUTEs

They knew?
Yes, your honor.
And. that was what?
He signed a full confession saying

I took the car on November 29th.

They had enough proof that

he had the car ten days, they had enough proof to take it
in front of a jury.
QUESTION:

Well, is ten days — is there any

case in Ohio that says that the difference between these
two statutes is a number of days?
MR. PLAUTE:

Not involved in this case.

If you keep
But that

isn't the statute he was charged at.
But in answer to your question, they had — you know
there is ho case that interprets this statute that says that
x amount of time equals intent.

But there obviously are

close cases, and a jury could very conceivably, after enough
proof that he had the car for ten days, he had the intent
to permanently deprive the owner of possession.
QUESTION:

There was one additional point that had

to be shown.
MR. PLAUTE:

In the second prosecution?

Mr, Plants, the prosecutions were

in different counties, weren't they?
MR. PL&UTZs

Yes, and as the Ohio Court of Appeals

made clear, it didn't matter.
QUESTIONS
MR. PLAUTZ:

Say that again? what?
As the Ohio Court of Appeals mad©

clear, it didn't matter in their decision at all.

It was

QUESTION:

second go round.

QUESTION:
MR. PLANTS:
QUESTION:

Yes, your honor.
You didn't mention it was suspended.
I thought I did, I'm sorry.
Why do you think that more serious

crime endad up in a suspended sentence?
MR. PLAUTZ:

I think it was more serious because

the first prosecution —- the first prosecution occurred in
a more rural county, where they

coirs

down harder on

offenses like that, and the second prosecution happened
in urban Cleveland.
QUESTION:

You don't think the second one was more

lenient because of the service of that first sentence?
MR. PLAUTZ:

No.

I know — I can make a

And

it didn't make any difference.

There

was none of that discussion at all.

And that court had full subject matter

and territorial jurisdiction to prosecute the auto theft.
They could hare simply bound petitioner over to the Lake
County Grand Jury and returned the same indictment that
a Cuyohoga County Grand Jury did a couple of months later.
QUESTION:

How would they have jurisdiction over

the theft if the theft was in another county?
MR. PLAUTE s

There's a specific Ohio statute that

says that upon — any person -- well, there’s two statutes
as a matter of fact, one dealing with all theft offenses,
the other dealing specifically with motor vehicles, saying
that when you take the car and you,'ve gone to another
county, you can be tried, prosecuted in any county in
which you took the car.

And that statute specifically says,

prosecution and acquittal in one county bars prosecution
and acquittal — prosecution in another county.

The Ohio

courts ignored that statute.
You'll also notice that in ray brief I argued that

26

this Court could, if it wanted to, adopt the same transaction
test.

It is a way this Court could go.

I would urge

that that test does have some relevance at times, but
this Court need not take such a radical approach to the
issue.

And if has enough existing case law under the

Blockburger test and the same evidence tests.
1 know there were some questions in the prior
r.

■

argument about whether that * s amafcter of constitutional
law.

But looking at the Ohio Court

of Appeals' decision,

they took that test to be a matter of constitutional law.
They cited Blockburger and they quoted from it, each statute
requires proof of ~~ other does not — and they concluded
that that was the same offense within the Fifth Amendment
double jeapordy clause.

They applied that case to be a

constitutional test, and there are countless other state
court opinions that would do likewise.
I reserve the balance of ray time for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Sadd«
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. SADD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.
MR. SADD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
On November 29th, 1973, an automobile belonging
to Gloria Ingram was stolen by petitioner-appellant,

27

National Brown, from a parking lot in Cuyohoga County,
Ohio.
Nine days later, on Dacrasher 8th, 1973, Brown
was arrested in a different county of Ohio called Lake
County and charged with the misdemeanor of operating a
stolen motor vehicle without the owner’s consent»
Two day*s later, the petitioner' entered a plea
of guilt/to the offense of operating a stolen motor

vehicle

in LakeCounty, and was sentenced to thirty days in the Lake
County workhouse and fined $100 and costs.
The record, contrary to Mr. Plau&z* assertions
before this Court, does not contain any reason for the
Lake County law enforcement officials to contact the East
Cleveland law enforcement officials in Cuyohoga County.
Mr. Plants has addressed this Court, and told this
Court numerous factors that are outside the record.

HAd

he deemed these items sufficiently important, he would have
included them in the record.

He made note that the

Cuyahoga Comity prosecutors -- or officials were there at
Like County thirty days after the misdemeanor sentence was
served.
QUESTION;

Do you object to our taking judicial

notice that the statutes of Oklahoma — I mean, of Ohio?
MR. SADD:

Yeas. '

QUESTION:

You object to it?

20

MR. SADD:

I object to any material matter that is

not contained in the record before this Court?
QUESTION s

I limited my question to the statutes

of Ohio, which I understand is in our library.

Do you object

tc us taking notice of it?
MR. SADD 2

No,

QUESTION %

1 thought that was what you were doing.

MR. SADDs

I thought you said something different,

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall.
There is nothing inthe record as presented by
petitioner’s counsel to support any of the allegations that
he made.

And under this Court’s holding of Ciuccl y._IJllinois

materials that are not considered

cannotbe considered

by this Court unless they were presented in th.:Ls record
be;fore this Court.
The State of Ohio urges this Court to affirm this —
QUESTION:

Mr. Sadd, of course the complaint and

summons that was filed on the joyriding charge does
identify the name and address of the owner of the vehicle
a;:: being in East Cleveland.

So there was knowledge where

the vehicle had been taken from, I suppose.

Isn’t that a

reasonable inference?
MR. SADD:

I'm sorry.

QUESTIONS

Is it not reasonable to infer that the

prosecutor in the joyriding case knew where the vehicle

29

came from?
MR. SADBs

Not necessarilyP Mr. Justice Stevens.

QUESTION 5

But the complaint says, the owner

was Gloria Ingram, it gives her address.
MR. SADDs

That information could have been obtained

by simply calling the Bureau of Motor Vehicles of the
State of Ohio and obtaining the owner of that vehicle,
and the residence of that owner.
It doesn't necessarily mean that there was any reason
for the Lake County officials to contact the individual
law enforcement officers in Cuyohoga County.
QUESTION:

Wall, but the point isn't critical

whether they talked to the law enforcement, officers, is
it?

The point that’s critical, isn't it, that they had a

reasonable basis for finding out where the theft took place,
MR, SADD:

Yes, but it's not in the record.

QUESTION:

Well, but the fact is in the record,

they knew where the car earns from.
ths owner.

They knew the name of

All they had to do was pick up the phone, they’d

find out where it was stolen, wouldn’t they?
Can't we take judicial notice of that?
MR. SADD:

I think yon could taka a very judicial

notice of that fact that there was -- but you can't take
any judicial notice of the fact that on the record as it
was presented that there was any. communication between

30

Lake County and Cuyohoga County,
QUESTION:

Don’t you have hot car sheets in Ohio?

MR» SADD 2

We have if a vehicle is stolen, in

that it would be reported and placed in a computer to all
law enforcement agencies.

I guess that’s what you’re

referring to by a "hot sheet” that you report —
QUESTION s

Yes.

MR. SADD:

I assume that was —

QUESTION :

Arid Lake County has that facility?

MR,, SADD:

I have no idea? I’m not from Lake

County, Mr» Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, it’s in Ohio?

MR. SADD:

Yes, it is.

We urge — the State of Ohio urges this Court
to affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals of Cuyohoga
County on the basis of the following rules of constitutional
law.
Under the traditional Gavieres test, a defendant
is.not placed in double jeapordy when he is tried twice?
and the elements of each statutory offense with which he
is charged requires proof of a fact which the other does
not.
In the petitioner's case, both the intent elements
and. the conduct elements of the separate crimes of operating
ve iicl

wit!

ut the owner's consent, and stealing a

'31

vehicle, on their face, are sufficiently different to permit
the petitioner's second trial for auto stealing*
QUESTIONz

Do you think that's consistent with

the interstate court's holding?
MR. SADD;

Not really.

I feel thatthe Court

of Appeals' erred in its holding that they ware lesser included
offenses.

I think that from the admissions made by the

petitioner before this Court, and this Court itself on its
face, can determine that the two crimes were totally
separate and distinct.
First of all —
QUESTIONs

Yes, but

the Court said, they were —

under Ohio law, they were — that there was a lesser included
offense.

as

MR. SADD:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION i

Now, are we --- are we bound by that

a construction of
MR. SADD;

Ohio Law?

No.

The Ohio State Supreme Court
I

has not passed on the question of whether operating a. motor
vehicle without the owner's consent is a lesser included
offense of auto stealing.

This Court has the power and the

authority to constItuflonalisse, for double jeapordv purposes,
that question, and find that the two offenses are separate
on their face.

In Ohio —

QUESTIONs

Well, I take it though, that in finding

32

the — joyriding to he a lesser included offense, the
Ohio Court said that every single element necessary to
prove that, offense was also necessary to prove the greater
offense,
MR. SADD:

That’s correct.

QUESTION;

Isn't that what they said?

MR. SADD:

That's Correct.

QUESTION:

I think

— I would think that

at

least to that extent we're bound by the Court's ruling about
Ohio law, that there was no

.element necessary to prove the

lesser included offense that was not necessary to prove the
greater offense.
MR, 3ADD:

This Court, for purposes of double

jeapordy, can constitutionalize that question of Ohio law,
or remand this decision to the Ohio’ Supreme Court for
certification of whether or not operating a motor vehicle
is a lesser included offense of auto stealing.
In

Ohio v. Ikner,a decision which came down

after this decision in the present case, there the Ohio
Supreme Court —
QUESTION:

Are you supporting the decision —*

are you — you’re not supporting part of the rationale of
the Court of Appeals.
MR. SADD:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Are you

part of their opinion?
MR. SADD:

Yes.

QUSSTIOMs

That this ~ that they were just

completely different offenses.
MR. SADD:

Yes, they are completely different

offenses, on their face.

And auto steeling requires an

intent to permanently deprive an owner of his possession
permanently, and requires a physical taking of the vehicle,
whereas operating a stolen motor vehicle without the owner's
consent is joyriding, and
QUESTIONs

Yoxi started to tall us, I think, about

a decision in the Ohio court system, the Ohio Supreme
Court, subsequent to tills one?
MR. SADD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

What was that?

MR. SADD:

Mr. Justice Stewart, it was Ohio

versus’Ikner.

,

QUESTIONs

And what did it hold?

MR. SADD:

They

held and construed a decision

a similar statute, section 4945.04, I believe subparagraph (e),
which dealt with concealing with a stolen motor vehicle,
and the same provision under which petitioner Brown was convicted in Lake County, operating amotor vehicle.

And

they held that the offenses were separate offenses, following
the Blockburger decision of this Court.

QUESTION;

Have you got the cite for that case?

MR, SADD;

Yes, I do.

QUESTIONs

Well, if it!s there, fine.

It“s included in my brief.

You (Han't give us the name of it, and therefore
I thought it was an intervening case, yet another case
since you wrote your brief»

132

MR, SADD;

No, it was present.

QUESTION;

Fine „

MR, SADD;

It's State versus Ikner, 44 Ohio St* 2nd

(1975).
QUESTION:

But it did deal with a different statute?

MR, SADD;

It dealt with a larceny statute of

concealing a stolen motor

vehicle,

QUESTION;

Yes,

MR, SADD;

And here we have a larceny statute of

auto stealing.
And to support my position that the two offenses
are totally separate, we say that auto stealing requires
to
an intent/permanently deprive an owner of his possession
permanently, and requires a physical taking, whereas operating
a stolen motor vehicle

is joyriding or a temporary taking,

and not larceny.
To support that in my supplemental brief, I would
like to comment on the traditional purpose of the joyriding
statute, the legislative service commission wrote, this

35

section defines the offense commonly known as joyriding.
For some years, auto theft has been an increasing problem,
and in this type of offense, it is difficult to prove that the

)

offender intended to permanently deprive the owner of the car.
The offense of joyriding was designed to alleviate the
enforcement problems this creates, and the gist of the
offense is simply an unauthorised use of the vehicle.

It

is unnecessary to prove intent to permanently deprive the
owner.
So on that basis we hold

or we urge this

Court to find --- that the two crimes under. which the
petitioner were convicted were separate and distinct, and
have no applications for the purpose of the double
jeapordy, and that this —
QUESTION:

But. isn't this

maybe with some

constitutional limitations — but isn't it really, in the
first instance, at least, the function of the courts of Ohio
to determine whether something is a lesser included, offense
than something else,

}

MR. SADD:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

That's

and we — and if they've

made that determination •—
MR. SADD:

It might be appropriate —

QUESTION:

That's for us to accept, isn't it?

MR. SADD:

I still say, Mr. Justice Stewart, that you

can constitutionalize
QUESTION:

Well, that's a matter of State law.

MR. SADD:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

That's a matter of the state definition

of the offenses.

If one is a lesser included offense to

the other, then it is, as a matter of State law.

If it

isn't, it isn’t, as a matter of State law, and of the
State definitions of the various kinds of misconduct.
MR. SADD:

Then I would urge that —■ this case —

this case may be appropriate for a remand for the Ohio Supreme
Court to determine that issue.
QUESTION:
consider this case.

Well, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to
And the Ohio State court that decided

was the Court of Appeals in this case which held that the
so-called joyriding was a lesser included offense.
MR. SADD:

Mr. Justice Stewart, if this Court feels

that it is bound by the decision of the Ohio Court of
Appeal, then we would urge upon this Court the prosecution
for a lesser offense, a lesser included offense, in the first
instance does not bar prosecution for the greater offense,
because in that particular instance, there's an additional
element, contained in the felony statute.
QUESTION:

Well, there always is.

MR. SADD:

That's correct,

QUESTION:

That's the definition of a lesser included

offense»

If the greater offense requires the same

elements as the lesser

something else.

And we would urge then for purposes

of double jeapordy —

That's the question.

MR. SADD:

That the man has never bean placed in

QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

Right, and that's the constitutional

MR. 55ADD:

Correct,

question.
because the Fifth Amendment

speaks in terms of, no person shall be placed in jeapordy
twice for the same offense.
QUESTION;

Well, I

don't

understand why you

don't. — why you don't defend the ultimate rationale of the
Ohio Court of Appeals,

The Court simply said that if you

have a theft on one day, and fifteen days later you pick the
fellow up for joyriding, and indict him under that, they
in effect said that isn't the lesser included offense,
HR, SADD:

That's correct.

I was trying to

explain it in terms of, first, in ray opinion, that this
Court should determine.
QUESTION;

Maybe that just isn't acceptable for

constitutional purposes, I don't know.

But that's what they

39
said.

Although if you — I suppose if you indicted the man

for joyriding at the very moment that he stole a car, perhaps
the whole thing that joyriding is a lesser included offense
would have some significance.
MR. SADD:

But then the decision of the Ohio

Court of Appeals could he upheld on the basis that they did
constitute two different operative acts occurring nine
days apart —■
QUESTION:

Well, that's what they held.

MR. SADD:

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

That’s what they purported to hold,

MR. SADD:

That’s correct.

anyway.
I would have no

quarrel with it in that sense.
QUESTION:

Even though one of the lesser included

offense —• from the — in the sense that if somebody were
charged with larceny of an automobile, and were convicted of
joyriding, he could not then ba recharged with larceny of the
automobile.

It's a lesser included offense in that sense. Is

that it?
MR. SADD:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Because he would have implicitly been

acquitted of larceny when convicted of only the lesser included
offense.
MR. SADD:

That’s correct.

We feel that the

39

double je&pordy clause in this particular case had not been
violated at all.

And that this Court, when it considers this

question, should hold that —* and permit multiple prosecutions

I
for different acts, and that the true protection of a defendant
under double jeaporday purposes is for cumulative sentences.
Petitioner could hardly complain that he was sentenced
a greater time for the more serious offense in this particular
case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sadd, under the reasoning of the

Ohio Court of Appeals, do you think if they had — instead of
having one prosecution for joyriding, and then the second one
of stealing on a different date, if the second prosecution had
also been for

joyriding on a different date, what do you

think the Court of Appeals of Ohio would have done?
MR. SADD:

I think that perhaps they might have held

that it might have been the same offense, but I*m not positive.
QUESTION:

In other words, you don't rely on the date

difference, then?
MR. SADD:

I rely on the date difference?

QUESTION:

But you don’t think the Court of Appeals

relied on the date difference?
)

MR. SADD:

They did rely on the date difference.

They said it occurred nine days differently.
QUESTION:
misplaced.

But you’re saying that reliance is

I’m trying — what is your view of the significance

40-42
of the dates?
MR. SADD;

Of this case?

QUESTION:

Yeah.

MR. SADD:

Well, under the Court of Appeals

decision, I would say that prosecution for a lesser offense
would, not bar greater prosecution for a greater offense.
Because they were based
QUESTION:

Well, but assuming they'd both been

violations of subsection (b) is what I'm trying to get at —
both joyriding charges, but involving different dates?
MR. BAUDs

I would still say the Court of Appeals

would have affirmed the decision, saying that they occurred
in different counties.
QUESTION:

Do you think we would have had an obli­

gation to affirm that decision?
MR. SADD:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Because of the difference in dates?

MR. SADD:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

So you have two entirely separate

arguments: one, that there are two different dates
involved, and second, that even though the offense is a lesar
included, you can go ahead and prosecute for the greater —
MR. SADD:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

You said the dates only apply to the

or.e crime, but not to the other one

As urged by the governor-

A3
MR. SADD:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION:

You couldn't charge him with stealing

it for ten different days, could you?
MR. SADD;

No, that's not presented for this Court.

That issue is not hsx'e in this particular case.

We would

urge also that the arguments made by the Solicitor General
in his presentation on the lesser and greater also apply
at this particular time.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Do you have

anything further, Mr. Plauta?

MR. PLATJTZ ;

A few minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT PLAUTE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.
MR. PLAUTE:

I would just ~ may it please the

Court:
I would just remind the Court again that it's
alleged that the greater offense occurred prior to the lesser
offense, ten days prior, and in response to Justice Marshall's
statement about the hotsheets, that in fact happened in
this case.
He was stopped for a traffic offense, they ran a
make on the car, they came up with a hit from East Cleveland,
they immediately called the East Cleveland police.

They,

within two hours, went to Lake County, the city of Wickliffp.

obtained the confession from him within two hours.
They waited three days — it happened on Saturday —
they waited three days and they filed a complaint on a Tuesday.
However, on the previous day, Monday, he was in the Willoughby
Court for pleading guilty to operating.
QUESTION:

But I understand the state position to

be that all of those facts, they still can prosecute him for
both crimes.
MR. PLAUTE;
QUESTION:

Yes.
So, I mean, all this factual material

doesn’t mean anything to the State, does.'' it?
MR. PLAUTE;
QUESTION;
State's position?

That, is correct.
What do you say finally to the

That he is not in jeapordy.

MR. PLAUTE:

It is inherently arbitrary to have

a statute thatprohibits conduct to try, prosecute, and
convict, punish that individual, for that conduct, and then
come around and try to punish him again for that same conduct.
In i answer to Justice Stevens’ question, yes,
under the Ohio Court of Appeals’ holding, they apparently could
have got him twice for operating, keeping, and taking that
car within the ten day period.

It makes

no difference

that’s it’s an auto stealing charge.
QUESTION;

Mr. Plants, you used the words, inherently

arbitrary, a moment ago.

Some years ago this Court decided

45
a ease called

Palko

against.Connecticut, in which Justice

Cardoza , speaking for the Court, said that the double
jeapordy clause did not apply to the State, but that
principals of opposed to inherent arbitrariness did.
Then some years later, in an opinion by my
«

brother Marshall, in a case called Benton against Maryland,
Palko was overruled.

And it was held that the double jeapordy

clause did apply to the states.
I taka it what you’re arguing here is double •
t

jeapordy in its technical sense, as originally contained in
the Bill of Rights, not some concept of inherently arbitrary
under the due process clause, divorced from double jeapordy.
MR. PLAUTZ:
But to explain:

Yes — I’d answer yes to your question.

I think we have essentially here a crime

that was, you know, when the Bill of Rights was written,
we have here essentially a crime that was known at common
law, a theft, a larceny.

And I would think that that would

have some merit, rather than opposed to what's been brought
up in the previous case, in the 7th Circuit, a highly
statutory, complex crime.

I think we have essentially a crime

that is one continuous piece of conduct, that they can
only try, convict and punish once.
