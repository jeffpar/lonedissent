MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 7^~1106* United States against Gregory Washington,
Mr, Sheehan., you may proceed when you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM Fc SHEEHAN, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, SHEEHAN:

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
District, of Columbia Court of Appeals,
the judgment of the superior court

That court affirmed

suppressing for use in

evidence in Respondent's prosecution for grand larceny and
for receipt of stolen property the testimony that Respondent
had given earlier before a grand jury.
Unlike the one just heard., this case does not
involve a prosecution for perjury and, accordingly* it poses
squarely the question whether the Constitution requires the
Government to warn grand jury witnesses of their privilege
/

against self-incrimination when the Government has reason to
believe that the witness may be indicted on the basis of the
testimony that is sought,
I will state some of the facts quickly* since there
is a claim that the Government's conduct in this case violated
the Due Process Clause,
On the night of December 3* 1972* an officer of the

Metropolitan Police stopped a van-type automobile after
watching it make a U-turn, and in the back of the van found
a motorcycle that had recently been reported stolen.
The two occupants of the van were arrested.

The

police determined that the van belonged to the Respondent
and they notified him that the van was in their possession.
Within the next several days, in an effort to
retrieve the van,, the Respondent went both to the police
station and to the United States Attorney's office.

On both

occasions* he said that he did not wish to press charges
against the two men found in the van who it had been thought
might have stolen the van in addition to the motorcycle.
He said they were his friends and had had his permission to
use the van.
He also said that he*, himself, had been driving the
van on the evening in question — earlier on the evening in
question he had been driving the van —~ and he explained the
presence of the motorcycle in the van in a manner that both
the policeman to whom he spoke and the Assistant United
States Attorney to whom he spoke found unpersuasive®

I will

get to his explanation in just a moment.
The policeman, in fact, told the Respondent that he
did not believe his story and that If Respondent were to
testify to it in court it would foe likely'to get him into
trouble

The Assistant United States Attorney gave the
Respondent back his van and gave the Respondent, also* a
subpoena to appear before the grand jury investigating the
crime.

He did so because he was afraid Respondent would not

appear voluntarily, either because Respondent would not want
to testify against his friends or because he was* himself
involved.
When the Respondent came before the grand jury, the
Assistant United States Attorney in charge *»» not the same one
who had given him the subpoena ~~ was uncertain whether or not
to seek an indictment.

He was not sure what Respondentes

testimony would be, or whether it would be believable, and,
accordingly, he decided to leave the matter entirely to the
grand jury, itself, after they had heard the testimony of
Respondenfc.
Before the Respondent testified, he was given full
Miranda^ warnings,

He said that he understood them, that he

wanted to answer questions regarding the theft of the motor­
cycle and that he did not want the services of a lawyer.
QUESTION:

He had not had any Miranda warnings

when he was talking with the Assistant U„ S0 Attorney, had he';
MR, SHEEHAN:

He had not had Miranda- warnings when

he was talking to the Assistant, no,
He then gave testimony to the following effect.
On the night in question, he said he had been driving the van

6

and had stopped to help a stranger whose motorcycle had
broken down,,

The two of them put the motorcycle in the van,

he said.,, and drove on looking for help and the van* itself ,
broke down.

He then left the stranger with the motorcycle

and the van* he said* and walked a block or two away to a
gasoline station where he telephoned his two friends to come
help him.

He said he waited at the gas station for two hours

and his friends did not appear.

He said he then went back a

block or two away to where the van had been left and found it
was gone.

He said that he did not report the disappearance of

the van because he said he assumed his friends had come and
fixed it and then driven it away.

The stranger who owned the

motorcycle* he said* was never heard from or seen again.
Following his testimony, in due course* the grand
jury indicted him along with the other two men for grand
larceny and receipt of stolen property.
The superior court then granted the Respondent's
motion to suppress his testimony on the ground that it had
been obtained in violation of his privilege against self-’
incrimination.

The court held that the Assistant United

States Attorney* conducting the grand jury, had not adequately
inquired into the Respondent's ability to understand his rights.
And* in addition* had failed to warn Respondent* on top of the
warnings he had received* that his testimony could result m
an indictment by the grand jury.

7
In affirming, fche Court of Appeals said that the
principal respect in which the full Miranda warnings which
Respondent had received were deficient was that he had not
—- tvas in that he had not been told that he was a potential
defendant»
The upshot of the decision Is that a potential
defendant is entitled, in the Court of Appeals" view, under
the Self-Incrimination Clause, both to Miranda-type warnings
and to target warnings»
It seems appropriate to begin the analysis here with
something that, in our view, the Court of Appeals gave too
little attention to, the words of the constitutional provision
themselves:

"No person shall be compelled in any criminal

case to be a witness against himself.”
This Court, in Miranda v, Arizona, found that the
procedures surrounding custodial .Interrogation by the police
of a witness *— of a suspect --were inherently coereiye,
and, accordingly, it held that a set of learnings was necessary
in order to balance things out.
Without those warnings, it is now conclusively
presumed that any statements given by the witness were
compelled against the suspect's will.
The issue for decision today is whether questioning
in front of a grand jury is also so inherent;ly coercive that
warnings are required before any testimony given by a witness

8
in response to questions by the Government* may be considered
voluntary*.
Our position is that there are many differences
between the questioning of the suspect by the police in
custody and the questioning of a witness in regular grand
jury proceedingso
For the most part, we think that these differences
are self-evident *

They are also — they are* in any event,

set out at length in our brief»

I will mention only two*

Before the decision in Miranda, the interrogation
by the police occurred principally in private.

In contrast,

the questioning of a witness before the grand jury occurs
before between sixteen and twenty-three private citizens who
are not likely to be, in our view, so compliant to the
prosecutor's wishes as to countenance the kind of abuses that
were catalogued by this Court in Miranda„
Second, the question — I might add that the view
that I just expressed was, I think, stated also by Mr, Justice
Black, In the Groban decision he said it would be very difficult
*■

for officers of the state seriously to «abuse or deceive a
witness in the presence of the grand jury.
Moreover, the questioning in front of a grand jury
is undertaken under the overall supervision of a District
Court judge and frequently the questioning is transcribed and
reported as it was here.

9
In short* the privacy that before Miranda allowed the
abuses of custodial interrogation that were perceived to exist*
does not exist in the grand jury setting and there Is*
accordingly ~~
QUESTION;

If there is — Your point is that this is

not compulsion within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment* if
I understand you correctly»

If that is true* I would suppose

it is not compulsion if he testified in a trial in an open
court.,

It would be the same thing.
MR„ SHEEHAN:

If he testified as a witness in trial

in open court.
Is your question* Mr. Justice* whether the Government
has an obligation to warn a defendant
QUESTION;

No.

As I understand your argument -**

correct me if I am wrong.
the argument.

I am trying to get the thread of

You say this situation is different from the

police Interrogation in a police station* where the man is in
custody
MR. SHEEHAN;
QUESTION:

Yes* indeed.

— with respect to the issue of whether

or not there is compulsion.
MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

Yes. Indeed.

And you say there Is compulsion in the

police station but there is not compulsion in the grand jury
room because it Is more public.

10

MR» SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

For that reason and others»

And if .that reason is valid, would it

not also follow that testimony in open court, pursuant to a
subpoena, would not be testimony pursuant — would not foe
compelled testimony?
MR» SHEEHAN:

Yes, it does, indeed follow that that,

in fact, would foe the position —
QUESTION:

Nell, then, to what does the Fifth

Amendment ever apply?
MR» SHEEHAN:

To testimony that is compelled»

subpoena does not compel testimony»

The

The subpoena, Mr» Justice

Stevens, compels only the appearance of the witness and once
the witness does appear, in response to lawful process, it is
open to the witness then to claim his privilege against self­
incrimination;, as to any questions that he fears may tend to
incriminate hira»

He would be compelled, in this situation,

only if in response to such a claim the .District Court, perhaps
upon a grant of immunity; would order him to testify»
The subpoena itself is simply legal process»

There

is no constitutional privilege to object to legal process.

He

has no Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination»
QUESTION:

Let me put this case to you»

Suppose a

defendant in a criminal trial decided to waive counsel and
1

appear for himself, and a subpoena was served on him and he
”ab called to the witness stand and a question was asked of him,

11

Would he be compelled to answer

say he didn't know about the

Fifth Amendment privilege — Would that be compulsion?
MR» SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

I think it would not be compulsion0

I see*

In other words, compulsion is the

failure to exercise the privilege.
MR, SHEEHAN:

No, the compulsion is not the failure

to exercise the privilege.
QUESTION:

The compulsion —

What is it?

MR„ SHEEHAN:

Compulsion occurs when, by the

Government's affirmative conduct, it overbears the witness*
will „
QUESTION:

Well, then, in my hypothetical case,

there would be no compulsion because he just didn't realize
that he was ~~
MR. SHEEHAN:

Not unless he was instructed by the

Government, that he was compelled to answer questions, or
that he was compelled to take the stand,
1 suspect that probably the hypothetical would not
occur,

I suspect in a case like that the District Court in —>
QUESTION:

But under your position, there would be

no duty to warn, no compulsion, there would be no Fifth
Amendment issue.
QUESTION:

You don't really mean that the trial judge

could say, ’’Take the stand," to a defendant.
certainly.

That's compulsion,

12

MR a SHEEHAN:

Oh:,, no,

I think that might well be

compulsion»
QUESTION;

Well* that11 s what the question —

MR» SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

No, the question to which I —

Well, If you do that to an ordinary

witness — an ordinary witness, not a defendant, must take
the stand.
MR 0 SHEEHAN:
QUESTION;

That8 s c orrec t»

And, it isn't deemed compulsion for Fifth

Amendment purposes, unless he is ordered to answer over a claim
of the privilege»
MR» SHEEHAN:

That's correct.

Indeed, if the district Court just ordered a witness
-.- ordered the defendant to take the stand without more,that
would not be compulsion»

There would have to be an order to

answer the questions that were put to him that -would be com­
pulsion»
QUESTION:

But it is well settled that

whatever

the logic of it may be— that it violates the Fifth Amendment
#•
even to call the defendant himself to the stand if the calling;
is done by the proseefcuion»

Is that correct?

The prosecution can't say to the defendant, "Now, you
take the witness stand."
MR» SHEEHAN:

That, itself, is a violation»

Well, it would also be a violation of

the Federal statute making the defendant competent to testify

13

in his own behalf „
QUESTION:

Violation of the Constitutioni for

Heaven's sakes.
MR, SHEEHAN:

I think it would be a violation of the

Constitution in large measure because the Government could not;
oblige the defendant, in that case, to assert his privilege
in front of the jury,
QUESTION:

Doesn't it fall under the eases that

simply say that there can be no reference to the failure of
the defendant to testify, and that would be one way of calling
attention to it?
MR, SHEEHAN:

Yes,

The situation is quite different,

Mr, Chief Justice, in the setting of a grand jury,
QUESTION:

Well, this rule long antedates the

constitutional rule of comment on his failure to testify which
came about only about ten or twelve years ago.

This con-,

stitutional rule that it violates the Fifth Amendment for
the prosecution to call the defendant to the witness stand
is a couple of centuries old, at least, I think,
MR, SHEEHAN:

I am not certain»

If it is a couple

of centuries old, I am prepared to —
QUESTION:

Well, as long as — I am not quite a

couple of centuries old, but when I was in law school it was
well established and the proposition that it violates the
Constitution to comment on the defendant's failure to testify

14

is only about fifteen years old,
MRo SHEEHAN:

I am. prepared to concede* for purposes

of argument today, that it is indeed settled today that it
would violate the Constitution for the Government to call
the defendant to the stand or in any way to comment upon his
failure to take the -QUESTION:

Well* if you have conceded that it

violates the Constitution* namely* the Fifth Amendment* to call
the defendant to the witness stand* you must necessarily also
concede that that is a form of compulsion within the meaning
of the Self“incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment«
MR0 SHEEHAN:

Well, even if it is*, my position is

that the situation in the grand jury is entirely different»
With the' grand jury there is no rule —»
QUESTION:

There is less compulsion in the grand

jury context than in the open court?
MR» SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

Well, the grand —

Your argument before ran in just the

opposite direction, that the greater the public character the
lesser the degree of compulsion,,
QUESTION: "/..Well, isnst the vice of the first
hypothetical calling him in the presence of the jury which. Is
then made aware of his failure or his refusal to testify?
MR, SHEEHAN:
to me —

Yes* indeed.

The grand jury* it seems

15

QUESTION:

Can that apply at a bench trial as well

as a jury trial?

MR» SHEEHAN:

Well.» I think the issue of whether the:

defendant can be called to the stand in a criminal ease is
not the issue

posed here* in any event»

The grand jury Is entitled, it would seem to me*
to accord whatever weight it thought it warranted to a
witness' refusal to make statements in the grand jury setting»
So I think that is.;:,in .contrast to.’the-situation x^ith the trial
jury where they are

not allowed to make any inferences what­

soever.
For example* if the witness in a grand jury setting
decided that he was going to exercise his privilege and
pursuaded the prosecutor then not to call him in front of the
grand jury* the prosecutor would not be precluded from telling;
the grand jury* for example* in response to an inquiry by them*
why that individual had not come to testify before them* that
that individual was going to assert his privilege and so had
not been called.
But the touchstone of our position is that for there;
to be a requirement of Miranda warnings in this case* this
Court has got to find that the setting of the grand jury is as
inherently coercive as is custodial interrogation.
For the reasons that I have stated in brief* we fine
that there is no reason, in this case* to reject the traditional

test for determining the voluntariness of a person's response
QUESTION;

Mr, Sheehan., I Interrupted you and I

really didn't mean to.

You. were going to give us two dis­

tinctions beti^een the Miranda custodial Interrogation and the
grand jury*

one being the public character and you didn't get

to the second,
• MR. SHEEHAN:
point.

They were both turns on the same

The first was that It was public because it was

in front of between sixteen to twenty-three citizenss and the
second was it did have the protection of being under the
overall supervision of the District Court and also there was
the added safeguard of transcripts being made of the testimony
in many cases, as it was here.
To this point., I have been talking only of the
questioning of grand jury witnesses In general.
The court below did not hold that all grand jury
witnesses were required to receive warnings.

It held* instead,

that only potential defendants were required to receive
warnings.
It follows then that the court must have believed
that the questioning of potential defendants is somehow more
coercive than the questioning of ordinary witnesses.
QUESTION:

Did the court say how it defined a

potential defendant?
MR, SHEEHAN:

It did not.

17
It would seem to us that under either of the tests
for defining a potential defendant, either a subjective test
going to what was in the prosecutor's mind or an objective
test going to what was in the prosecutor's files, would be
the likely candidates for determining who is a potential
defendant,
We fail to see, however, hox»j the content of the
prosecutor's mind or of his files has any bearing on the
question whether the setting in the grand jury is inherently
coercive.
Certainly in the Miranda situation, this would be
irrelevant.

I take it the police would not be heard to say

that warnings were not required when they questioned an
individual in custody against whom they had no intention to
press charges.
QUESTION:

Except ~~ the only way — The Miranda

rule is an exclusionary rule, and the only time it arises is
in a criminal trial and the interrogee by

interroga tee,

whatever the word is, the person who "was questioned by
definition by hypothesis, is now a criminal defendant.

So,

obviously, he was a potential defendant at the time he was
being interrogated.
MR. SHEEHAN:

He may not have been a potential

defendant so far as the Government knex*j, though.

He may not

have been a potential defendant so-far as the police knew when

18
they questioned him# but the police would# nonetheless# be
obliged to give him warnings in the Miranda situation.
QUESTION:

They are not really obliged

an exclusionary rule.

You are

The Miranda rule is

trial•
MR, SHEEHAN:

Yes# that is true.

obliged to give warnings.

You are not

If you. don't give warnings and

statements are made# they may not be used because they are
d eeined inv olunta ry,
QUESTION:

That{s right,

MR, SHEEHAN:

We think that as the Court recognized

last term in the Beckwith case# the Miranda presumption of
involuntariness and the Miranda-type safeguards should apply
only when it can be said that the setting of the questioning
is# indeed# inherently coercive# and that# in our view# has
nothing to do with whether the Government thinks or knows this
or that at the time of the questioning.
My opponent does not appear to argue that questioning
before a grand jury is necessarily as coercive as custodial
interrogation.

Indeed# at page 23 of Respondent's brief# Note-

11# it is said that the matter is open to some doubt.

It is

a matter of speculation# he says# as to our position that it
is not as inherently coercive as custodial interrogation.
The argument# instead# appears to proceed upon the

19

assumption that, as was discussed earlier, the subpoena itself
is a form of compulsion -- is a form of testimonial compulsion.
If that were the case, if the subpoena without more,
amounted to compulsion to testify in contravention of the
privilege against self-incrimination, then it seems to me that
the many immunity statutes and the many — and also the many
decisions of this Court construing those statutes,would be
very curious, indeed,

if it was compulsion simply for the

witness to walk into the grand jury in response to a subpoena
commanding his appearance.
QUESTION:

It is a compulsion to appear.

MR. SHEEHAN:

It is, indeed, a compulsion to appear.

It is not a compulsion to give testimony, since the witness,
after he appears, is entitled to raise his privilege at any
point that he thinks a question, if answered, would tend to
incriminate him.
QUESTION:

What if he refuses to answer before the

grand jury and just says, "I won't answer," and they take him
before the judge and the judge just orders him to answer?
He never claims the privilege.
MR* SHEEHAN:

I think in a situation like that,

under the Cordell case, it might be too late for him to claim
the privilege later on, if he -QUESTION:

QUESTION:

21

but he still is compelled to incriminate himself.
Now what gets the Government off the hook in that
case?

Why is the evidence admissible?

With respect to a

witness in an ordinary courtroom, it is because he didnct
claim the privilege
MR, SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

I think the general rule —

— and that compulsion only arises for

purposes of the Fifth Amendment after you ajre compelled to
answer after you have claimed the privilege,
MR, SHEEHAN:

I think in that case ““The general

rule stated in the case of United States v, Monla is that the
witness has to claim his privilege in the grand jury setting
or else it is going to be lost to him,
I think then that his failure to assert the privilege
— I think if he failed, in the face of the District Court
order or in the face of the questions themselves, to assert the
privilege under the general rule that it must be asserted, he
would lose the privilege,

Yes, but waiving the privilege is quite

a different thing from saying there was no compulsion at all,,

I don't —

Maybe I8m not — Let me give you another

Supposing a witness who is not even a defendant at all

prosecutor says to him, "Well., you must answer*

And the

You are under

subpoena and you've got to answer the question *"
Is he being compelled to answer, or not?
MR. SHEEHAN:

I think in that case it would be

incumbent upon him to, if he wanted to keep his testimony out
of the subsequent prosecution, to say, "I don't want to
testify because it would violate my privilege."
QUESTION:

No, he is not claiming privilege at all,

no self“incriminations

He just doesn't want to testify,

doesn't like to talk about his friends.
Can he be compelled to answer those questions?
MR. SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think he can be.

Without going to the judge?

I think —
Can't you

just say ~~
MR. SHEEHAN:

There is no question about it.

He is

QUESTION:

So then, the compulsion arises without

any reference to the judge or any reference to the privilege
against self “incrimination.

It arises soleljr from the sub-

poena and getting on the stand, obeying the law and answering
questions.
MR. SHEEHAN:

No, but the compulsion takes place when

23

he is eora.pe3.led to incriminate himself, when he is called to
testify and he says, ”1 don't want to testify because I don't
want to get ray friends into trouble."

He is then stating, in

open court, "I am not being compelled to testify in violation
of my privilege against self-incrimination»"
If it turns out later that, In fact, he v*as, that he
had an ulterior reason, it seems to me not unfair to insist
that he have stated his constitutional reason at the time he
was compelled to answer,
QUESTION:

Supposing a witness is asked a question

by the prosecutor before the grand jury and he says, "I just
won't answer that," perhaps for reasons like Justice Stevens
suggested„
Now, can he, at that stage, be prosecuted for
contempt or do you have to go before the District — do you
have to go before the judge and get an order compelling him
to answer?
MR, SHEEHAN:
would not, in that case

That is my understanding.

And he

I think in that case, he would,

indeed, be compelled to answer if — because the only reason
he could avoid it —«* Well, I think, in that case, he would
be ordered to answer by the District Court judge,
QUESTION:

A short answer might be that , there is .a high

price to protecting your friends in that setting.

You might be

in contempt of court or find yourself charged with perjury»

24

MR, SHEEHAN:

Yes, I think that *s right *

I turn now to the question whether the failure by
the Government to give a target warning on top of the Miranda
warnings that were given or, indeed, alone, automatically
results in the coercion of the witness.
Certainly, if warnings regarding the privilege are
not required, it seems to us that neither are target warnings
because the witness cannot be more coerced by the failure to
receive a target warning than he is by the failure to receive
warnings regarding privilege.
Even if some warnings are required by the privilege,
it does not follow, automatically, that a target warning is
required in addition.
If warnings of the privilege are required to be
given to a potential defendant, presumably the reason will be
that they are necessary to overcome an inherently coercive
atmosphere in the grand jury. ’
There is no reason to believe,we think, that such
warnings would not, by themselves, be enough to dispel any in­
herent coerciveness that might be found to exist in the grand
jury.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sheehan, may I ask:

Suppose this

interrogation is not a grand jury interrogation, but by an
FBI agent In a custodial context.

I gather 181001 makes any

willfully false statement, in that context, even though he's

had Miranda warnings, does it not. a crime punishable by
$10.,000 fine or not more than 5 years in prison?

Under 13

USC 1001, isn't it?
The way it reads is;

"Whoever in any matter within

the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United
States willfully makes any false statement shall be fined not
more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both*
That's what the statute says*
Now, in that context, is it enough to give them
Miranda warnings, or do you have also to give them target
warnings?
MR* SHEEHAN:
about that*

Mr* Justice Brennan, I haven't thought

I am not sure that I can give an easy answer to

o

QUESTION:

Well, there the hypothesis is that

its custodial interrogation of a suspect by an FBI agent who
gives him Miranda warnings* 'Does he also have to tell him
he is a suspect?
MRa SHEEHAN:

I think he would not have to tell him.

he is a suspect, as well, in that case*
QUESTION:

If then, notwithstanding his Miranda

warning, he lies, he can be prosecuted under that statute*
MRa SHEEHAN;
QUESTION:

I think that's right*

What additional protection would it give

him to tell him he was a suspect?

Being a suspect doesn't

26
entitle you to commit perjury®

And# on the other hand,, even

though you are not a suspect.» you are protected against
c ompuIsory s eIf-inc rimination *
MR® SHEEHAN:

Yes®

The only additional help# it

seems to me# that the target warning gives —- Well# it seems
to me that it gives no help that warnings of the privilege
don't already give to protect against self“incrimination0
The result is the same in respect of target warnings
under the Due Process Clause®

We think that# as I suggested

in the argument just passed# that there is little to be gained
by shifting the analysis from the Self-incrimination Clause
to the Due Process Clause*
The target warning seems to us to be conceivably
helpful to the witness only insofar as it aids in the decision­
making process as to whether or not to invoke the privilege*
That process# it seems to us# is afforded all the
protection to which it is entitled by the Self-incrimination
Clause alone*
It must be assumed# therefore# that some values
not associated with the privilege, not protected by the
privilege, are protected by the Due Process Clause in the
context of a case such as this*

We can think of none*

In most cases# the witness already knows# in addition
whether or not he is a potential defendant®

Indeed# he may

know that far sooner than the Government will discover it*

27

That would make an additional putative defendant warning
doubly unnecessary, as a matter of constitutional law*
In any event, the facts of this case certainly do
not show a Due Process violation*
Before questioning the Respondent in this case, the
grand jury -- in front of the grand jury — the attorney gave
him full Miranda warnings*
was under investigation.

The Respondent knew what crime
The Respondent knew, in addition,

that his connection with the crime was known to the authori­
ties by virtue of his own statements made earlier to the
police and the Assistant United States Attorney,
He also knew that the explanation of his Invvolvement had not been believed by the policeman to whom he first
told it.
In these circumstances, the prosecutor's failure to
give him a target warnings, on top of full Miranda warnings,
seems to us was not so fundamentally unfair as to deprive the
Respondent of Due Process,
Indeed, we believe it was not unfair at all.
I will reserve whatever time I have left,
Mr, Chief Justice.
MR,

CHIEF

JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Weisberg.

Very well, Mr. Sheehan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP FREDERICK H, WEISBERG, ESQ*
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR* WEISBSRG:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am Frederick Welsherg,

I am counsel for Gregory

V, Washington, the Respondent in this case,
I would like to begin by setting out what
Respondent's position is in this ease* and in the course of
that state as clearly as I can what our position is not.
And then I would like to discuss briefly what 1
understand to be the position of the Government and why we
think that position Is simply unsupportable under this Court's
prior decisions,
Our position in this case is, simply put, that the
Government may not compel an Individual to incriminate himself
by requiring him to testify under subpoena before a grand jury
that has focused on him as a target for indictment, and then
after he testifies and is indicted, use against him at his
criminal trial the compelled self-Incriminatory testimony
without demonstrating that the defendant made a voluntary,
i..

:

knowing and intelligent waiver when he chose to testify before
the grand jury.
The factual premises of that position in this case
are the following:

Both prosecutors testified below, In this

case, in effect, that their purpose in subpoenaing

29

Mr* Washington to the grand .jury was to enable the grand
jury to determine* after hearing his testimony, whether or
not he should be indicted for the offense under investigation.
What they gave him was a very official looking
piece of paper that commanded him to appear before the grand
jury.

It was signed by the clerk of the court in the name of

the Chief Judge of the Superior Court commanding him to appear
before the grand jury and answer questions in connection with
an investigation into a crime of which he was suspected of
ha v ing c oirajii11 ed „
• QUESTION:

Was it any different* in any way, from

the usual subpoena to appear before a grand jury?
MR, WEIEBERG:

No* Your Honor.

The practice in the

Jistrieg of Columbia in the Grand Jury Section of the United
States Attorney's office is to have presigned subpoenas, a
stack of them, and, as happened in this case when
Mr. Washington came in and asked for his van back and the
prosecutor decided this was someone he ought to put before
the grand jury because he, himself, may be implicated in this
offense, he handed him the subpoena, and it is presigned by
the clerk of the court in the name of the chief judge.
QUESTION:

Isn't this the practice in most every

Jurisdiction?
MR. WE IS BERG:
jurisdictions.

I am not familiar with other

30

QUESTION:

I wondered why you thought that was

unusual,
MR* WEISBERG:

It is not unusual.,, Mr* Chief Justice*

The reason I mention it is not because it is unusual but
because Mr* Washington* coming in without counsel, gets a
piece of paper signed in the name of the chief judge of the
court commanding him to appear and answer questions*
I state that only because it is a factual predicate
for our position that there was compulsion in this case*
.*

QUESTION:

He would be given a similar piece of

paper if he were called as a possible witness in an automobile
accident case* would he not?
MR* WEISBERG:
QUESTION:

Thatss true* absolutely correct*

Was the subpoena returnable in the grand

jury room itself or did he have to go to an assistant U. S,
Attorney^ office?
MR, WEISBERG:

In the grand jury room. Your Honor*

Our position* very simply* is that Mr* Washington*
as the Government concedes in this ease* had an absolute
constitutional right to refuse to answer every single one of
the prosecutor^ questions in the grand jury relating to the
motorcycle found in his van.
He could waive that right* we readily concede* but
this record does not support a finding that Mr, Washington
voluntarily* knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege

31

against self-incrimination and two courts below have so found.
Having stated what our position is, I want to be
quick to state what our position is not.

The issue in this

case,, as we see it, is not whether grand jury target witnesses
are entitled to Miranda warnings or. as the Government would
prefer to put it, are entitled to certain warnings on top of
Miranda warnings.
We are not asking this Court to extend the pro»
phylactic rules of the Miranda case.

We are not asking this

Court in the case of grand jury target witnesses to manu­
facture a set of warnings, the failure to give any one of which
automatically will result in the suppression of testimony.
What we are asking this Court to recognize, as it
has recognized, in our view,, throughout the history of the
Fifth Amendment privilege, is that when the privilege applies
-r and I will go on to indicate why we think it does apply in
this case — it must be waived.

And the waiver must satisfy

the requirements of a voluntary, knowing and intelligent
waiver.

And that does not exist in this case.
X might add, in that connection, that what the

court below held, what Judge Nebeker writing for the Court of
Appeals held, was not that Mr. Washington's testimony must be
suppressed because the Government failed to give a particular
warning that he thought was required by some sort of a pro­
phylactic rule, an extension of the Miranda rule.

32

What the Court of Appeals, as they stated the issue
at the outset of their opinion and that they held,
Hr, Washington did not voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently
waive his privilege for, among other reasons, the fact that
he had no way of knowing, presumably, or was not, certainly
not told that he, himself, was the target of the investigation
when he testified before the grand jury,
QUESTION;

How do you square the ~~ with your view

the =>.- situation of the ordinary witness in a civil or a
criminal case, where he gets on the stand and simply refuses
to answer a question the Judge orders him to, answer*

He never

claims his privilege and he incriminates himself and that
answer is offered later in the criminal case and he claims
that it was coerced from him, that it was compelled.

And his

objection is overruled.
MR, WEISBERG:

The way x-re answer that question,

Your Honor, is simply fchiq.

It is essential to our position

that at the time Mr, Washington was subpoenaed —

The answer to that question* Your

Honor* ~*

And his answer is later admissible*

isn't it?

when the Government is seeking to avoid the burdens of the
adversary system*the very thing protected by the Fifth

QUESTION:

»

Let's talk about the witness I was

Why isn't his Fifth Amendment right infringed

in the example I gave you?
MR, WEISBERG:

Because with respect to ordinary

witnesses* Your Honor* with respect to whom the Government has
no purpose to indict* cases from this Court have recognized*
primarily in dictum, lufe Cordell by holding* that the burden
is on the witness to apprise the Government that they are
encroaching on Fifth Amendment territory.
QUESTION:

Whether anybody could sensibly say he

knew of his right or not?
MR, WEISBERG:
QUESTION:

That's correct* Your Honor,

The classical definition of compelled

self-incrimination is one who is ordered to answer a question
over the claim of privilege,
MR, WEISBERG:
QUESTION:

I agree with you,

So*when you talk about the question of

waiver* you are putting the cart before the horse.
MR, WEISBERG:

We don't think so* Your Honor,

In the case

.

QUESTION:

What authority do you have from this Court

35
for your proposition that in this type of situation you have
to show a knowing and intelligent waiver, rather than the
claim of privilege being an element in the compulsion?
MR, WEIS BERG:

We think that the decision in Garner.,

which we set forth at great length in our brief, is exactly
the authority for that, Your Honor,
When you are dealing with someone whom the Government
knoxx's will incriminate himself by giving answers and whom it
compels, in this case, under subpoena, to give those answers,
then the ordinary rule requiring a witness to put the
Government on notice makes no sense,
The Government knows it5s compelling incriminating
QUESTION:

ThatSs sort of a Due Process not a Fifth

Amendm ent a rgument,
V-v,

M.R„ WEISBERG:

'

We think this.case could be decided^,S'

under either provision, Your Honor, but I think it is part of
the Self-Incrimination Clause,
We do not view the waiver requirement as simply a
prophylactic rule.

If someone is compelled to incriminate

himself and is in a situation where the Government knows in
advance that the answers are likely to incriminate ham ano
sets out to get those answers by compelling him

with a

subpoena to give them, then we think that the burden is on she
Government to show that he waived his privilege before he
answered

35
We don’t think this is a Due Process caseo

The

Government would prefer to see it as a Due Process case and
if his testimony is voluntary, in traditional terns, then that
ends the inquiry as far as the Government is concerned„
We don *t think that is the case here*
The Government does not argue that Mr* Washington
waived his privilege*

In the face of two holdings by both

courts below, the Government argues Instead that he was not

t

compelled to incriminate himself*

Presumably, the argument

is that he had — even though be testified under subpoena —
he had the right not to incriminate

himself by simply saying,

"I refuse to ansxAfer on the grounds what the answer to that
question may incriminate me*"
I should point out here that in many cases like
this, and certainly in this case, we are dealing with a
witness subpoenaed to the grand jury without counsel, unable
to afford counsel, who probably, at the risk of being glib,
does not even know what the word "incriminate" means.
And the Government claims that what his burden is
is to understand the in’s and out’s of the Fifth Amendment
privilege, to know which questions to assert it to, which
questions it doesn’t apply to and to assert it when it
applies.

And we simply think that view ignores reality*

QUESTION:

Mr* Weisberg,

38

MR, WEISBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes. sir„

I understand that you say you are not

interested in Miranda warnings, that you want what has been
called target warnings.

Precisely what, in addition to

warnings that were given in this case, do you think are
required?
MR» WEISBERG:

Mr* Justice Powell, in our view, the

focus on what he was told or not told is the wrong focus*

He

needed to be put in a position where his decision to testify
could satisfy a court as a voluntary, knowing and intelligent
waiver of his privilege*
QUESTION:

What, in addition, do you think the

prosecutor should have asked him in this case?
MReWEISBERG:

Whether he understood that the body

that he was appearing before might indict him for a criminal
offense and he might be prosecuted.
QUESTION:

bo you think that is materially

different from telling him that whatever he said could be
used against him?
MR» WEISBERG:

Yes, Your Honor*

There is every

likelihood that Mr» Washington had no way of knowing what the
Government meant when they said could be used against him.
For all he knew, he would have to testify later as a witness
and what he said was going to be used to try to twist his
story then

39
He was given a subpoena by.a prosecutor who
indicates in the record below that he may have told him. that
he was needed as a witness in connection with the on-going
grand jury investigation*
For all Mr* Washington knew when he testified, he
was appearing as a witness in connection with an investigation
against two other people,,
And I might say, that's not my own personal — that
is my own personal view* but it is not just my personal view,
Both judges, both courts below, Judge Hannon on the Superior
Court and Judge Nebeker for the Court of Appeals, thought that
that warning was indispensible in this case to a voluntary,
knowing and intelligent waiver, and both refused to find
waiver on this record*
QUESTION:

Suppose a prosecutor in this case did not

know, personally, that Respondent was the target of the
investigation but the files did show that Respondent may be
a target*

What would your view be as to the requirement of

the Constitution?

/

MR* WEXSBERG:

It seems to me that there has to be

some knowledge on the part of the Government that it is
compelling potentially self-incriminatory testimony before our
analysis is activated*
QUESTION:

Does that mean the prosecutor would have

to exercise due care to know what the Government might know

40

through the FBI or. perhaps other officials?
MR0 WEISBERG:
correct»

I would think at a minimum that is

And, as a practical matter, prosecutors,

generali;»-

know at least the outlines —
QUESTION;

Perhaps, not always,

MR» WEISBERG:

It may be that they don't always

and in such a case, if the Government can make a claim before
a reviewing court that this was really an ordinary witness,
that they had no basis for thinking that this person — that
they were not trying to avoid the burdens of the adversary
system by building a case against this person out of his own
mouth, then it seems to me our analysis might not apply,
But I hark back to the opinion you wrote last term
in Garner, Your Honor, and it seems to me all the requirements
of that opinion are met here.

The Government knew exactly why

it tiras subpoenaing Gregory Washington»

It was subpoenaing

because it didn't believe his story and it thought the grand
jury might not believe his story, and if they didn't the
grand jury would indict him and they could prosecute him and
use his own testimony against him,
QUESTION:

In Garner, the Court stated the general

rule derived from Mon la
decision

or however one pronounces that

and it said there were three exceptions

to it.

Which of those three do you think applies to this
case?

MR, WEISBERG:

In a sense* Your Honor.* I think all

three apply,
QUESTION:

Which of the three is more relevant?

You go ahead and answer it any way you wish,
MR, WEISBERG:

It seems to me,* starting with the one

that seems least like this case* the difference between
Garner's situation and Mr, Sullivanrs situation and the
situation of Marquetti and Grosso is that the Government
when it compels Marquetti and Grosso to file a tax return*
required only of gamblers., knows that when it gets that return
it has incriminating evidence of gambling which it can then turn
over to the states or the Federal Government for prosecution
of gambling offenses.
Like the defendants in Marquettl and Grosso*
Mr» Washington was subpoenaed because the Government knew
what his story was likely to be and that it would be likely to
make him a criminal defendant if he told it to the grand jury
and they disbelieved it.
Like the situation in Miranda* although we don?t
rely on the prophylactic aspects of Miranda * what — aside from
the custody aspect of Miranda which I hope to get to In a
minute because I think it has absolutely nothing to do with
this case, the other half of the Miranda decision is the focus
rationale* that when the police are questioning non-»suspects
in the fact-finding process* people on the street who might

42

know something about an offense., about whom they have no
reason to think are guilty of any offense, there is no require­
ment to give warnings and there is no requirement to get
a waiver, and if those persons happen to incriminate themselves, at some point there would be a burden to give warnings
when they became a suspect, but at least the threshold state­
ments would not be excluded under the Miranda rule,
So, too, here, if Mr* Washington was subpoenaed
solely because he was someone who had seen the van drive away
with a motorcycle, just an ordinary witness, and lo and behold
when he got in there the Government realized for the first time
that this person may be implicated in the offense, we think
any incriminating statements made, much like the ordinary
witness at trial, would not be protected by our analysis*
Except that, it is our view, that when the person
began to incriminate himself in the grand jury, testifying under
compulsion of subpoena, the proceedings ought to stop and the
prosecutor ought to then say,

"You are getting yourself into

trouble, perhaps you ought to consult with a lawyer»"
And I am not sure what the third »*»
QUESTION:

You mean if the Government has a man in

the grand jury room and they say, "Did you steal this property?"
they should stop and say, "By the way, if you answer that
question the wrong way, you may be in trouble»"
MR* WEISBERG:

No, Your Honor»

If the question —

43
If he is subpoenaed because he is suspected of having stolen
the property* as was true here* then the Government has to do
that before they even get him in the grand jury»
Tha t! s our view.
QUESTION:

The fact is /ehat in this case the

prosecutor misinformed him as to his rights, didn't he?
Told him that he had rights that he* in fact* didn't have»
He said,. "You have a right to remain silent.

You are not

required to say anything to us in this grand jury at any time
or to answer any questions,"
Now, that's just incorrect, wasn't it?
MR, WEISBERG:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

He was required to answer any questions,

MR, WEISBERG:

He was required to answer every

question,
QUESTION:

Every question.

So he was misinformed.

He was told that he had rights that, in fact, he did not
possess, wasn't he?
MR, WEISBERG:

We have not argued in this case

because it is not necessary to our position that a putative
defendant in the grand jury has, like a defendant in a trial,
an absolute right to refuse to testify if he is, in fact, a
putative defendant»

That simply is not necessary to our

position and so we haven't argued on it,
I think an argument can be made based, in some part.

44

on Mr» Justice Rehnquist’s opinion in Michigan v„ Tucker —
language in the opinion “-that just like the defendant in a
trial,his right to remain silent at "trial, could he practically
nullified if you make him go into the grand jury without
counsel and fend for himself and decide which questions he
thinks might incriminate him and which might not,

He was told he had rights that he didn't have, but

certainly those rights could include rights that he did have,
MR, WEIBBERG;

If I understand, Your Honor's question

that’s why I responded to Mr, Justice Powell by saying focusing
on what he was told or what he was not told, it seems to me,
is the wrong focus,
Two courts fceloif viewed this record, viewed this
defendant and heard arguments and held that this was not a
voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver, and they could not QUESTION;

I understand your question.

It is not a criminal case in the sense that a
criminal trial is a criminal case.
is

The grand jury proceeding

One of the problems in this case is that we think that

the analogy to the criminal defendant is a very strong one.
This guy

if he answers the questions as he did he will be

a criminal defendant the next day as soon as the grand jury
hands up its indictment, and he is doing it without counsel,
QUESTION:

I understood your theory to be that he

was, in essence, the same as a defendant because the Government
»

has already made up its mind to proceed against him,

Therefore,

his rights before the grand jury were tantamount to his rights
in open court which would be the right to answer no questions

48
at all, which would mean that he was not subpoenaed.

He had

a right not to be subpoenaed,
MR, WEISBBRG:

I meant that as an argument by-

analogy, Your Honor, as the supporting basis for a holding
that a putative defendant, true putative defendant before
the grand jury, would have a right to silence.
We do not make that argument in this case because
it is unnecessary to this case.

We argue, only, that he has

a right not to answer incriminating questions.

Like an

ordinary witness, except that unlike an ordinary witness,
when he is subpoenaed because he is not an ordinary witness,
because he is the target, the ordinary duty to inform the
Government that they are subpoenaing self-incriminatory
testimony is unnecessary because it makes no sense.

They

already know they are subpoenaing self-incriminating testimony.
And what takes its place is that there be a voluntary,
knowing and intelligent waiver of the privilege,

At the point that Justice Stewart took

you and characterized it as an overwarning, he had already beem
told that he could have a lawyer outside the courtroom to help

to stop answering at any time until you talk to a lawyer, .
which, again, is an overwarning»
that right

He didn't necessarily have

Now, the prosecutor went on and said, "ho you want
to answer questions In reference to the stolen motorcycle
that was found in your truck?", and he said, "Yes, sir."
And, "ho you isant a lawyer, here or outside?"

That's the

third time, now, he is told about a lawyer.
"ho you want a lawyer, here or outside the grand
jury room?"
"No, I don't think so," says he.
How do you say, again, that he hasn't been warned
about his rights?
MR. WE3BBERG:

Your Honor, he was warned.

We agree

with that much of the plurality opinion, Mandujano, that says
✓

certain of the Miranda warnings are Inapplicable in the grand
jury context.
Our position is that Miranda fashioned warnings so
that people would understand what they are giving up when
they answer questions.
The warnings that are applicable in the police
station are simply inapplicable in the grand jury,

And what

he needed to be told in the grand jury was, "By the way,
Mr. Washington, this body whose questions you are about to
answer, is going to indict you if you answer them a certain
way and you don't have to.

And if you want to remain silent,

you have that right to do so, but you should know when you
testify that if you don't remain silent you are targeted for

50

ind ic fcment ."
QUESTION:

I know that{s the argument you make and

I know that Is one of the issues in this case* but certainly
whether or not you are a target in an investigation doesn't
either elevate or depress your constitutional right not to
be compelled to testify against yourself.

That's true whether

you are a target or not a target.
MR6 WEISBERG:
QUESTION:

I agree.

And neither truer nor less true whether

or not you are,
MR „ WE IS BERG:
QUESTION:

Is that correct?

MR* WEISBERG:
QUESTION:

I agree.

I agree with that*

And whether you are a target or not a

target you don't have any privilege to tell a lie under oath
which* of course* is not involved here.
MR. WEISBERG:
QUESTION:

We agree.

So* why* what's the point?

purpose of telling somebody he Is a target,

What's the

His constitutions!

right is no greater and no less whether he is a target or
isn't a target.
MR. WEISBERG:

I would respond to that question*

Mr, Justice Stewart, in two ways,
Fii’sfc, the difference between an ordinary witness
and a target witness is that if the Government has no idea this

51
witness is in any jeopardy, that it is not compelling selfincrimination by subpoenaing him, then the cases have
recognized that he has to tell the Government that it is
compelling self-incrimination, that the subpoena that it
issued him and the duty, his duty to testify, will force him
to incriminate himself»

That we take out of the Garner

opinion *
QUESTION:

So that's a question, it goes to

compulsion, then, right?
QUESTION:

Or does it go to waiver?

MR* WEISBERG:

We think he Is compelled by the

stibpoena, Your Honor, to answer»

And if he is compelled and

if he is in the category of suspects recognized in Garner
as not being required to put the Government on notice simply
because the Government is already on notice, then the compul­
sion of the subpoena is only undone by a voluntary, knowing
and intelligent xvaiver*
And we think that that requirement is not merely a
prophylactic rule*
case*

This is not a Due Process voluntariness

This is a privilege against self-incrimination case*

And when the privilege applies it's a constitutional right
that has to be given up*
QUESTION:

What's your definition of a target

defendant?
MR* WEISBERG;

We have, again in this case, not

52
defined that0
QUESTION:

Well, it is quite important.

And if we

were to adopt the principle that you are advocating, pro­
secutors would have to know who were target defendants and
who werenct.
MR. WEISBERG:

I agree.

The principle that we think

is the one that emerges from the Garner opinion.
QUESTION:

Well, how do you define it?

MR. WEISBERG:

When the Government knows that the

answers that it is compelling by subpoena may incriminate
that witness, in the sense that the witness is a potential
target for indictment.
And what the Government knew in this case is that
the grand jury would either believe him or it vjouldn't believe
him.
QUESTION:

When the Government knows that the

answers it is compelling from the witness will incriminate
him?
MR. WEISBERG:

Will incriminate him not in the

40>

sense that he is definitely going to be disbelieved and
definitely going to be indicted, but in the sense that if he
is disbelieved he may well be indicted.
QUESTION:

Well, that is true of any witness before

a grand jury, isn't it?

If he is disbelieved, he may be

indicted, probably for perjury.

53

MR, VIE IS BERG:

But in this case, Your Honor, the

difference is that the Government knew when it subpoenaed him
that one very likely possibility is that the grand jury would
disbelieve him and indict him, and that’s why they subpoenaed
him»
QUESTION:

What if I’m a prosecutor and I know that

a potential grand jury witness is apt to lie before the grand
jury*

Bo I have to warn him that he is a potential perjury

defendant?
MRa WEISBERG:

I think the answer to that question

is no, in light of the Mandujano opinion, but that may be
affected„
I have only one minute left and I would,Do I
have a minute left?
And I would like to comment very briefly on what
the Government’s argument really comes down to*
What it seems to me to be is that if they tell these*
witnesses what their constitutional .rights are, some of them
are going to exercise those rights and the Government is going;
to lose some testimonjr.
If what they are worried about is losing the testimony
of the individual in a prosecution against that individual,
our view is that that’s exactly what the Fifth Amendment
protects *
If what they are worried about is losing the

54
testimony of that individual against others whom he might
know about in the world of crime., our view is that it loses
nothing by giving warnings,, because it tells the witness what
— effective warnings, or obtaining, as we would say, at a
valid waiver*
QUESTION:
loses something.

The question isn't whether the Government

The question is whether the Constitution

requires -~
MR« WEISBERG:
QUESTION:

That's our starting point, Your Honor.

»» We know whether it is a good idea

to give them warnings.
MR* WEISBERG:

I agree completely,

Our starting

point is not that the Constitution requires the warnings«
The Constitution requires a waiver, and whatever warnings are
given, a court has to be able to say that when that person
decided to testify it was the product of a voluntary, knowing
and intelligent waiver.
What I wanted to mention briefly is the Immunity
/

provisions which answer almost all of the Government's
arguments about losing testimony against other people involved
in crime.
If the person has to make a waiver and refuses to
waive, the solution is simply, "I'm sorry, you can't refuse
to waive.

Here Is an Immunity statute that compels you to

testify despite your unwillingness to waive.'1

55
And they can compel that testimony and the only
thing they canct do is use that testimony against the
individual whom they've compelled under a grant of immunity.
They can still prosecute the individual under the ruling in
Castlgar.,
QUESTION:

But on your theory* then* the only way

you can compel testimony before a grand jury is to grant
immunity to people»
MR» WEISBERG:

Not at all. Your Honor,

They can

obtain a voluntary* knowing and intelligent waiver,
QUESTION:

Suppose that before every question they

asked — or after every question they ask to a witness for
a grand jury* this witness* the prosecutor said* "Remember*
■

•

you don't need to answer this question at all if you don't
want to.

And* furthermore* you don't need to answer if it

tends to incriminate you,"
Which warning would you rather have?
MR, WEISBERG:
QUESTION:
have?

Yes,

Of those two?
Which privilege would you rather

your friend* your neighbors* or the latter?
MR, VIE IS BERG:

to answer anything* regardless of incrimination,
QUESTION:
isn't it?

Well, that's Justice Stewart*s point*

MR 8 WEISBERG:

But two courts below.» Your Honor., have

said that, in this case, he didn't knowingly, Intelligently

.

Now, "bo you want to answer?"

t
And you say yes*

How about that?
MR, WEISBERG:

It seems to us, Your Honor, that

unless this Court can conclude that that was *a knowing and
intelligent waiver, over the holdings of two courts below,
that the holdings of the two courts below — of the court
below ought to be affirmed,
QUESTION:

I agree with that, but what about you?

What's the argument that it isn't a knowing and intelligent
waiver?
MR* WEISBERG:

That he had no basis of knowing why

he shouldn't answer those questions,
Wiiy shouldn't he answer then?

He was in no

jeopardy.
They want to know about the motorcycle found in
his truck that was driven by two other people/'I'll tell them
the

MR, CH3.JF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, Weis berg,.

57
Jo you have anything further, Mr* Sheehan?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP WILLIAM F0 SHEEHAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, SHEEHAN:

I would like to add one point in

conclusion,
ye think the issue in this ease is whether the
statements were voluntary.

Voluntary statements are admissible

This testimony was not compelled against the
privilege against self-incrimination by the issuance of the
subpoena alone.
Now, that seems to me to be the first question the
Court has to decide, whether the subpoena to appear coerces
testimony in violation of the privilege.
If that does not, as we believe it does not, then
the Court must decide whether or- not this situation is one
in which you can abandon the traditional test for voluntari­
ness.

Vlas the witness* will overborne by some sort of in­

formal coercive practices, such as took place in the Miranda
case.
QUESTION:

Mr, Sheehan, may I just'ask one question4

You know the overwarning part of the warnings were
given, "You need not answer any questions at all."
I take it the Government does not, as a matter of
routine, give all witnesses such advice, does it?

That would

mean nobody would ever have to answer any questions before

58

the grand jury,
MR* SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

I think that is probably right*

Is it not a fair inference, then, that if

a person like this is given such a warning the Government must
have had some notion of intending to indict him?
MR8 SHEEHAN:

I think that there Is no —» No.

No.

I don't think it is a fair inference.
QUESTION:

Would there be any reason to give a

warning this broad, unless the person were a likely defendant?
MR. SHEEHAN:

I think that there is no question but

that this person was a possible defendant.

The Assistant

United States Attorney who gave him these warnings had not
decided in his own mind whether he would request an indictment
from the grand jury in respect to the Respondent, or not,
I mean he was certainly aware there was a likelihood,
fifty percent chance, as far as he knew, maybe more, that an
indictment would follow following this Respondent's testimony*
QUESTION:

Isn't it equally likely that this warning,

overwarning, x«?as simply an inadvertent mistake*

This is not

the standard warning given to witnesses,if they have a standard
learning, is it?
MR* SHEEHAN:
Mr. Chief Justice*

1 think that is entirely correct,

I don't think that the Assistant United

States Attorney, in this case, focused on this question to the
extent that tie ought to

59
QUESTION:

Did he testify at the hearing?

MRe SHEEHAN:
QUESTION;

I believe he did.

Was he asked why he gave that type of

warning?
MRo SHEEHAN:

No .

MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you* gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
v (Whereupon* at 2:29 o'clock* p,nu* the case in the
a bov e“enti11ed matter was submitted.)
