ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD N. WINDERS, ESQ.#

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WINDERS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas®
%

the Court:
My name is Richard Winders# and I am an Assistant
Attorney General of the State of Iowa.

This case involves

the kidnap and rape and murder of a ten-year old girl in
Des Moines, Iowa.

The questions that will be presented con­

cern whether or not the respondent Williams wan deprived of
bis constitutional rights when he was transported by police
officers from Davenport# Iowa to Des Moines# Iowa.
i

During that trip# Williams made self-incriminating
statements and ultimately led the police to the body of the
little girl.

Williams was convicted of first degree murder

by jury verdict in Polk County, Iowa.

His conviction was

affirmed by the Iowa Supreme Court in a five-to-four decision.
Williams petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in
the Federal District Court of Iowa.

ieie.ee. by -

That, petition was sue™

■ Federal District Court Judge Hanson.

We

4
appealed to the Eighth Circuit and, in a two-to-one deeds5„©a,
Justice Webster dissenting, Judge Hanson's opinion was
affirmed.

Our petition for rehearing €;n banc was denied,

although three justices voted to hear it.
In 1968, on the day before Christmas, Pamela
Powers accompanied her mother to the YMCA in Des Moines to
watch her brother participate in a wrestling match.

if she could go to the wash roan.
permi ssion.

Her mother gave her that,

Pamela left aid she never returned and was

never seen alive again.
The respondent Williams was a resident of the YMCA
and at about 1:00 or 1:30 he was seen hurrying through the
lobby of the Y carrying a large bundle wrapped in a blanket.
He got outside and asked a young boy if the boy would open
the car door for him.

The boy did, Williams threw the

bundle inside, and the boy testified at trial that there
were two skinny white legs in it.

YMCA personnel tried fee.

stop Williams, but he pushed them aside and locked the doors
of the

car and drove away.
Two days later, on the morning of the 26th of

December, Henry MeKnight, a lawyer in Des Heines, came to
tha

Moines - police station and advised officers there

that Mr. Williams had phoned him from Moline, Illinois, and

5
Mr. MeKnight said he advis: sd Williams to- surrender in
Davenport, Iowa, which is just across the river.
Williams did surrender in Davenport at approxi­
mately 9;00 o'clock.

He was arrested and given his Miranda

warnings by a Lt. Ackerman.

He telephone Me Knight, who was

in the Das Moines police station, and MeKnight’s and of the
conversation with Williams was overheard by Chicsf of Police
Nichols and. also Officer Cleatus Learning.
MeKnight told Williams, among other things, that
Des Moines police officers would come and pick him up, they
wouldn't grill him, they would be nice to him, and they
would let no harm come to him, and that they would talk it
ova: in Des Moines.
He further told Williams that "you have to tell the
police where the body is, you are going to have to tell
them. *

He ended this conversation by saying, '"Well, it

makes no difference, you come back to Des Moines, tell .me,
I will tell them, I am going to tell them the whole story."
*

Judge Denato, of the Polk County District Court,
in a suppression hearing, found that, from that conversation,
that there was an agreement existing between the police and
Mr. MgKnight that no questions would be asked Williams on
his way back to Des Moines.

H© found this, even though both
*

Chief rf Police Nichols and Officer Learning denied the
existence of the agreement.

6
Learning and Officer Nelson went to Davenport to
pick up Williams.

They arrived around noon.

In the mean-

time, Williams had been taken before a municipal court judge,
arraigned on a fugitive warrant, and for the second time
given the Miranda warnings by the judge.

He was; also

granted a private conversation with the judge in chambers.
As h© was leaving, he noticed an individual :.n the court
room and asked if the man was a lawyer.

It was a Thomas

Kelly, from Davenport, and Williams was allowed to talk fee
him in private for about forty minutes.
Learning first saw Williams at approximately 1:00
o'clock on that day.

He for the third and last time gave

Williams the Miranda warnings.

Ha also stated ho Williams,

"Now, 1 want you to understand that you're represented by
Mr. Kelly here in Davenport and by Mr. Me Knight in Des Moines. '*
Williams acknowledged that he understood that.
Learning further stated that,

"I want you to re­

member rhafc I've told you here, because we will be visiting
on tin ’ way back to Des Moines."

They left about. 2.00

o8 clock.
Learning testified both, at the suppression hearing
and at the trial that shortly after they left, Williams
started asking him questions.

E© asked about the polies

procedures, whether they had searched for fingerprints in
his room, whether they had searched friends of his.

They

7
also had further discussions pertaining to religion, church
groups, singing, and that type of thing.
Learning testified further that he made a statement
to Williams shortly after they got on the freeway outside
of Des Moines.

Ife stated to him, "I want you to observe the

weather conditions.

It's raining, freezing, it is going to

You yourself are the only person that knows

where this little girl’s body is, and you’ve only been there

once.

I think we will be going right by the area, where the

body is.

I feel that we should stop and locate the body on

the way to Des Moines, rather than waiting and coming back,
because you may not b© able - to find it.

Tha parents of this

little girl deserves a Christian burial for th® girl that was
snatched away from them."
Williams; asked him why he felt 'they would be -going
by the area, and Learning replied to him, ”1 know it is in
the Mitchellvilla area.

I don’t know' where, but I know it

is thare."
Learning ended this conversation by telling Williams,
"I don’t want you to answer me.
any further.

I don't, want to discuss it

Just: think about it as we are riding down the

road."
Williams further stated to Learning, according to
Learning, that — also for the first time, shortly after
leaving Davenport on the’ freeway, that Williams told him,

8

"When I get to Dss Moines and see Mr. McKnight, I am going
to tell you the whole story.n

They proceeded on the inter­

state and,- shortly before they got to the Grinned 1 exit,
Williams spontaneously volunteered a question to Learning,
"Where did you find the little girl's shoes?”
QUESTION:

Mr, Winders, how far is it from

Davenport to Des Moines?
MR. WINDERS:

Your Honor, it is approximately l->3

miles.
QUESTION:

How far to the Grirmsll exit?

MR. WINDERS:

Grinnall is approximately 60 mile,

from Das Moines, so it would b© roughly 100 to 110, 120
miles.
QUESTION:

Mr. Winders, is it: correct that Mr,

Learning’s statement, that he knew the body was in. the area,
whatever it was, was a false statement?
MR. WINDERS:
flicting»

Your Honor, the testimony is con­

Williams — Learning stated that he had a theory

that she body was in the Mitchellvill© area, and Williams
at th3 suppression hearing also stated that he had keen told
by Learning that they speculated that the body was in th©
Mitch siIvilie area.

So it wasn’t exactly a lie, it was more

of a theory.
QUESTIONs

Well, it was incorrect, that fee knew?

MR. WINDERS:

E© didn’t absolutely know, no.

Only

9
Wi 1 llama kimw that.
QUESTION t

So tlrat was a false statement?

MR. WINDERS;
absolutely.

Well, he didn't know for sure,

It was his theory, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

What is the state5s position as to why

he made this statement, if it was not for the purpose of
trying to in effect interrogate the defendant?
MR. WINDERSs

Well, Your Honor, w© wouldn't call

it interrogation, but we do concede, and the, testimony is
/

fairly certain, that Learning wanted to find and locate -the
little girl before they got to Des Moires, and he stated
that.
QUESTION?

More narrowly, would it b© correct to

say that he wanted the defendant to reveal the whereabouts
of te® child?
MR. WINDERS:

I think you could say that.

It is

the same -tiling, I think, Your Honor.
After they searched for the shoes
QUESTION:

The seven minutes that you indicated

you wished has h@@n consumed, so you are on your own.
MR. WINDERS:

All right, Your Honor.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD C. TURNER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TURNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and m>.y it please

the Court:
If it would be helpful to thci Court, I -could pass
u.p to the Court some official Iowa road maps, which might
illuminate -the distances? and I have sons extra copies hare.
QUESTION:

I think we have atlases available if we

need to check that, counsel.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

All right.

It is about ~

You could give on© to me, if you would

like.
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

All right, I sure will.
Just leave them at the table and w® will

gat them later.
MR. TURNER:

Very well, sir.,

Wh®n I found out we had only a half hour to argue
this, I felt like the poor guy that sat down one night near
income tax time to do his income tax return and read in the
instructions that it would only take the average taxpayer a
half hour and he said to himself, "My gosh, it will take we
longer than, that to find my wife’s social security number

3

But the facts in this case are very important, of
course, and I think perhaps we should examine them furthest,
Kr. winders said it was shortly out of Dos Moines that he

misspoke.

Actually , I think faa

onto the highway.
Now,.the highway was icy.
testified to this.

Even th© defendant

It was sleeting, it was cole? and th®

predictions for that night were for snow.

And he did tel 1

this man, to induce him, and knowing I think that he w$s:- .
religious man, and he even called him — in the suppression
hearing he called him reverend.

H© did, he wanted to indue©

the man to tell him where Pamela Powers9 body was«

In fact,

h® didn't really know that it was in Mitchellville, and he
didn't for -that matter really know that she was dead, for a
fact.

There wasn't anything really in th© record at that

stage, but he suspected that she was.

And I don’t think it

is a fair characterization to say that he really lied, but.
he told him right then, "I don't want to discuss it further,
I don't want you to answer me."
Now, as they rod© down the highway, it was nearly
— it was 120 miles from Davenport to Grinnell.
that will shew on these maps.

I think

It is on Interstate 80, right

through Iowa, and Grinnell is a turn-off, a few miles.

And

when they reached that intersection, at that point Mr.
Williams voluntarily and spontaneously, volunteered "Did you
find her shoes?”

Well, h® said he knew, th© officer knew

they had found th© little girl’s clothing, but. he didn't

12
know, he hadn*t seem it, .he didn't know what it consisted
of, and he said,

"If the shoes were with the clothing, why,

we found them.”

Ha said, "Well, pull in here," and h© in­

dicated and they went into a gas station and fchsy looked
behind the gasoline station into a box where he said he hai
disposed of a pair of brown boots, and they didn’t find
them.

They were never found.
They drove on then, continued on thx highway, after

having a cup of coffee there, I think.

They drove on and a

few mii.es further they came to a rest stop, and he said, t5Did
you find the blanket?"

And he said, "Well, if it was wi-fi

the clothes, we found it.”

And he said, "Wall, pull of

here, I disposed of the blanket at a different place than I
put the clothes."

So they drove in there and they looked for

the blanket, but the blanket had been found, and the clothes
had been found.
They drove on and, as they got to Mi.tchalIviliewhich is or® of the very first exits outside of Das Moines —
and I think this led to Officer Learning5s theory, he
fch@cri.sed I think, he inferred that h© would — th© murderer
would want to dispose of the body as quickly as possible,
and that he would turn off as soon as h® could.

It wasn't

th© very first intersection or place h© could hava turned
off .

That was really .in Des Moines.

first, place outside of Des Moines.

But this was th© very

13
As they approached this place, he sale'., "Turn off
here, I will show you where the body is.*

And they did

turn off and he took them up the wrong road at first, lie
was a mil© off on that.

But after a couple of tries, they

went and located the body, right where he said it would be.
And he asked the officer about the little girl's face and
some things like that, that are in the record.
The girl's body was clad only in a T-shirt, other­
wise she was naked.

She had been sexually ravaged.

Seme?;

’ was found in her vagina, rectum and mouth, and she had disk!
of strangulation, according to the reports.
*

Now, of course, when they got back to Das Moines,
then Mr. MeKnight was quit© angry, the lawyer who was
waiting; there.

And indeed while it was found by the- trial

court in the suppression hearing by Judge Donato, who triod
this case as the judge, that there was an agreement.
I submit to you that you will find, on careful
examination of the record, that Learning — neither Learning
nor Nichols nor any other officer agreed to anything.
QUESTION;

Is that sort of agreement enforceable?

as if it were a contract under Iowa law?
MR. TURNER;

I should think not, Your Honor. Assam

ing that there was an agreement, it wouldn't to raa be en­
forceable.

It would violate the person's sense of fair play

but. I don't —

14
QUESTION?

It co-lid raise constitutional overtoilss#

but I would foa surprised if any state# as a matter of public
policy# would say you treat it just like you would a contract
to buy some potatoes.
MR* TURNER;

And I think# too# Your Honor# that
<r

you wouldn’t treat it the same way that you would treat an
agreement between defense counsel and the prosecuting
attorney.

I think there those kinds of agreements should be

honored.
But assuming that Learning agreed — which w© don It
and we say —
QUESTIONs

Wall# I thought w@ had to accept that

■there was an agreement.

Now# whatever that means# as my

Brother Relinquish suggests# might not b® -MR. TURNER:

Yes# sir# he raised that in the pre­

vious case and perhaps —
QUESTION:

Wall, let me just ask you this question.

Am I mistaken in believing that the trial judge in your state
found that there was an agreement?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

H© did.
And on habeas corpus and federal habeas

corpus# this was submitted by stipulation between the parties

on tii© ferial record# and that the District Court accepted
the fact that there was an agreement# and therefor® we have
to accept that as a fact in this cas®.

Am I mistaken about

that?
MR. TURNER:

Welly Your Honor, I know the rule on

that, .but actually -QUESTION?

That; question should foa answered yes or

no, 2 think.
MR. TURNER:
to accept it.

No, I don't think you absolutely sencl

If th© record is complete — and I think it­

is -— and if there is absolutely no

evidence that Learning

or Nichols or anyone agreed to anything — they heard this
conversation, certainly they heard this one-sided ~ now,
from that, ha found that there was an agreement*
QUESTION:

And so did th® District Court, the

Federal District Court, didn’t it?
MR. TURNER:

Well, th® Federal District Court did

so on the basis that it was bound by th© findings of the
trial court.
QUESTION:

Which you stipulated it should make its

findings on, didn't you?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
How did the Supreme Court of lo-wa treat

that point?
MR. TURNER:

They found that there was an agreseent,

I believe.
QUESTION:

So as it stands now, everybody agrees

there was an agreement but you?

16
MR. TURNER:
QUESTIONS

Well, Your Honor
Is that right?-

MR. TURNERS
QUESTIONS

That's correct, but I stand here —That ia what I thought.

MR, TURNERS

I plsad with the. Court, to consider

the record itself on this point, and I think that section
2254 has authority ia there for this Court.to do that, whore
there is an absence of this.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Attorney General, if we are bound

by the finding that there was • an agreement, what .is your
view as to whether or not it was broken by the questions
that; i«re asked by Officer Learning?
MR. T-URNERs

Well, Your Honor, Officer La&ming

testified, and he was uncontradicted, that he did not really
ask any questions.

He made this Christian burial stateraert,

and h® said "I don't want you to answer me."

Now, that may

bs considered to bs — that is going t© h® a question for
*

this Court to decide, whether that constituted isat@rroga.tion
or a psychological ploy.
QUESTIONS

I think you indicated earlier that the

office/.: was anxious by the questions he asked to lead
Williams into stating where the body was located, %did you
not?
MR. TURNERS
for that purpose

Yes, he was 'and ha made the statement

17
QUESTION;
MR. TURNER:

Would you regard that as irtar r og aidoa?
Well, it wasn’t interrogation in th©

customary seas© of thinking of interrogation as being
questioning.
QUESTION:

You mean he hadn’t been put under oath

at that time?
MR. TURNER;

Wall, ha hadn’t asked him a question.

He simply stated a fact.
weather conditions.

He said "I want you to observe the

I want you to noti.ce that it is snowing,

that it's, sleeting, that the roads are icy," and so an.

And

.he said "Even if the snow covers her body, you won’t be able
to find her body, and her parents deserve a good. Christian
burial."

Now -QUESTION;

But isn't the point, really, Mr. Attorney

General, what you indicated earlier, and that is that the
officer wanted to elicit information from Williams —
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
—■ by whatever techniques he used, I

would suppose a lawyer would consider -that he mn:<& pursuing
inter: agation.
MR. TURNER:

It is, but it was very brief.

was,

officer of the law, as a police officer anyway, and that;
this was volunteered two hours later.

18
QUESTIONS

Don't you concede though.•

Turnar.-

that if it had been a prosecuting attorney who msde —
assuming that there was an agreement, that he wrmld he
bound?

1

think you conceded that earlier.

MR. TURNER?
Your Honor.

As a matter of ethics, h@ would be,

I don't know that —
QUESTIONs

Well, as a matter of ethics, I supple

the police officer was bound.

But what, significance do ve.

attach to ethics in this?
MR. TURNER:
QUESTION:

Well, I think the sour: attach —
Let me rephrase the question.

Would it

make any difference in the outcome of the case if (a) there
had been an agreement undoubted, and ib) that it had been
mad© by the prosecuting attorney, rather than a police
officer?

MR.

turner:

QUESTION:

Perhaps, because, yes —
Does your position depend on the fact

that .it is a police officer rather than a prosecuting
attorney, is what I am trying to find out.
MR. TURNER:

In a plea bargain, for example, the

courts have held that the prosecuting attorney is bound and
later can't set aside his agreement.

And I think, yes, but

the law is never extended to a police officer in this regard.

QUESTION:

What is the sens;® of having a lawyer if

you cxrt have the lawyer to make an agreement to protect

19
you?
MR.

turners

Well, I haven’t conceded idler® was ,rm

to speak to the officers about anything relating to the

MR. TURNERS
QUESTION;
MR. TURNER;

I think fe® waived that.
And he waived that by speaking?
I think he waived both at that point,

because he had already had a lawyer.

Ha waived both his

right, not to speak and his right to counsel, both of which
right» he knew.

There is no question about it.

He admitted

that he knew them.

And her© 'there is a strong circumstancial probability of
reliability in his statement, and the honesty''and truth o£
his statement, when he took the police to the body.

And I

think here, where there has been a full hearing and these
rights have been adjudicated by the trial court, that the
trial court and the Supreme Court of Iowa are at least in
as good a position to make the decision, as would be Judge
Hansen or would be the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals,
and that therefore Stone v. Powell should be ess tended her-*.,
and that this cas© should ba denied on that ground alone.

QUESTION:
may I ask you this:

General Turner, before you sit down,
.As you know, th© very threshold point

that your adversary makes is that there was a finding in
this case that th© respondent's statement was, as a matter
of fact and a matter of law, involuntary, and that finding
has not bran challenged, and if that is true, then all this

28
talk of Miranda, Escobedo and everything else is wholly ir­
relevant because that would decide this case, and that was
a factual finding, it was affirmed on appeal, and it has
not, been challenged by you in -this Court.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. BARTELS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. BARTELS:

Mr.. Chief Justicef vac. may it plaaa©

the Courts
As the briefs in this ease indicate, theses arc

.

number of constitutional problems that are raised by the
record? and I would like to focus on what is the central

.id

most serious problem, and I think the on© the Court has baen
dealing with so far primarily.

And that is the deliberate

and repeated efforts by Das Mcdr.es police officers to deprive
•the defendant of the assistance of his counsel during an
interrogation about the crime, the very crime with which ha
has been charged? formally charged.
Now, this interrogation took placa, as Mr. Turner
and Mr. Winders havs indicated, on the automobile trip from
Davenport to Das Moines.

i think perhaps I ought to com©

back and emphasize certain facts that existed and that
svarycr© knew before the automobile trip began aal before
the interrogation took place.
First, the police clearly knew that the defendant
had retained an attorney, Mr. McKaight, to represent him
with regard to fit© charges h® was facing,

And indeed, Mr.

McKhigbt himself arranged to have th© defendant surrender in
Davenport.
Secondly, the police had been informed through
counae .1 that th® defendant did not wish to be questioned or
to provide any information during th© return trip to Das

Moines.

31
Third —
QUESTION;

Md do you say that is forever irrevo­

cable?
MR. BARTELS;

No, Your Honor, I car. conceive of

circumstances in which the defendant could clearly state
■that he had changed his mind about that, or that, ha was re­
jecting his attorney's advice about that.

But there is

nothing ©van remotely resembling that in this case»
QUESTION;

In other words, the rights are the

rights of th© defendant and not the rights of the lawyer?
fir.

BARTELS;

That is correct, Your Honor.

I guass

that brings me to the agreement.
QUESTION;

The what?

MR. BARTELS;

Th® agreement ‘that the state trial

court and Judge Hanson both found existed between the defense
counsel, Mr. McKnight, and th© police, to the effect that the
defendant would not be questioned during this return trip to
Des Moines.
There is clearly a considerable amount of support,
in the record for th© trial court's findings, particularly on
pages 38 and 39 of 'the Appendix.

The testimony of Chief

Nichols, who virtually concedes that there was an agreement.
At on

point, on page 39, Mr. McKnight says, "Now, didn't,

you say, wh&o. w® found out that they had stopped, -to find tin®
body, that you hoped that they hadn't questioned him and

32
hadn’t stopped to find'the body because we agreed that, that
vreuid not be done?"

And Chief Nichols said# "1 may have

said that*B
And D®t* learning denies the agreement., but; there#
Your Honor# the trial court specifically expressed doubts
about Defc. Learning's candor with regard to -the agreement# and
I think it is important her® to remember that the state
trial court got to see the demeanor both of the witnesses
end Mr. McKnightf who was in kind of a peculiar position.
QUESTIONS

Let me ask you a question about th©

t

treatment of th.® Supreme Court, of Iowa of the Polk County
District Court's finding on that point.

The Supreme Court#

at Sy tabus, paragraph 10» refers to it as an alleged agree­
ment# and I suppose that there was no occasion for the state
to ch illenge the finding in the Supreme Court of Iowa # since
the District Judge ultimately sustained a guilty verdict.
But you don’t contend# do you# -that the Supreme Court of Iowa
upheld the finding that there was an agreement?
MR. BARTELS;

No# Your Honor# I don’t think the

Supreme Court of Iowa really mad© any finding either way on
that# really relying on the finding of the state trial court#
which I think is the finding really that is referred to in
3<acti<

2254(d).

That is the finding on the merits of factual

dispute that has the initial presumption of correctness under
2254(d).

33
QUESTIONs

Lsfs accept that presumption ©f correct­

ness and the existence of something called an agreement by all
the courts and by the parties.

In the relationship between

the attorney and the client, who is the mastar end who is
the servant?
MR» BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, clearly at least

my view is that the client is the mater and that the attorney
is the servant.

QUESTION:

So —

MR. BARTELS:

But here, Your Honor, the defendant

has retained counsel to represent him and to assist him in
dealing with the police, and there is no contention her©
that this was a commercial contract, there is nc issue of
QUESTION:
though it were.

It has teen argued to some extent as

Now, taking it for as much as it has been

called an agreement or understanding — understanding might
perhaps h® a better term, would you agree?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think it is not per­

fectly clear what Judge Denato meant by an agreement.

I

think he at least meant a mutual understanding between the,
parties and that they mutually understood that the ‘other
party was essentially agreeing to this, that there was no
questioning»
QUESTION:

Your client, Williams, the defendant in

th© c^e@, you have agreed, is the master or the principal.

34
He can change agreements made by his agent, can he not, by
saying ,}I now want to talk"?
MR. BARTELS:

Well, he could have don© that, Your

Honor, but lie clearly -—
QUESTION:

Hypothetically.

MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Hypothetically, Your Honor.

But I am not assuming that ha did.

MR. BARTLESs

What could have happened, Your Honor,

in this 'trip is that the defendant could have said, "Mr.
Learning,

I want to reject everything my lawyer has done, I

want -.;o reject that agreement,

I want to give up assistance

of counsel, I want to talk to you."

And nothing even remote­

ly resembling that, happened in this case.
QUESTION:

But suppose he had said, instead of that,

without anything at all, ha said, "I want to tell you where
the body is, because I killed her."

There is nothing wrong

with that, is there?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, if that had taken place

before what has been referred to as the Christian burial
speech and the priest, then I think there still would be no
f

problom in this case, except perhaps the fact that Mr. Kelly
was domed, permission to go along in the squad car.

And I

think that was probably proper also, as long as the police;
were not going to interrogate while Mr. Kelly was not in the
police car.

35

QUESTIONS

Well, I take ife hs.fi they riddns 130

miles in couplet® silence and suddenly the defendant had
said,

3!Mr. Learning, I want to tell you, I know where the

body is, I am going to show you, I killed her," you wouldn't,
be her®, would you?
MR. BARTELS:

I assum® I would not, Your Honor, :io.

I don't think there is any problem with that.
QUESTION:

I gather, then, what you emphasize ir

that Learning, what he had to say all along, which led finally
to tha defendant saying what h® did?
MR. BARTELS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The most important

piece of interrogation here was the Christian burial speech,
and I think Mr. Turner has conceded really that this; warjust an obvious attempt to indue© tha defendant, to provide,
this information.

And it is also quit® clear from the record

that I c/uess the reason w® are here is that it. succeeded.
The information that was requested was in fact, given, the
delay which tha Attorney General tries to make something of
was exactly what Det. Learning asked for.

There was ho in­

formation given before the Christian burial speech, despite
all the other conversations referred tc, no information given

after the defendant returns to Dos Moines and sees Mr.
McKnight.
QUESTION:

Then what is the objection that you s-=©

to the Christian burial speech?

36
MR. BARTELS;
interrogation.

In other wards,, for

orb

thing# it is

And beyond being interrogation# Your Honor,

I think it was particularly offensive and coercive type of
interrogation# because obviously the references to the
Christian burial were designed to play on the defendant's
known religious background and his history of mental illness.
QUESTION;

Wall# what is the matter with that?

MR. BARTELS:
questions

With playing on it?

Yes.

Presumably# there is a privilege

against compulsory self"incrimination* but certainly the law
does not frown on incrimination teat comes voluntarily.

I:':

a man confesses a crime# you certainly don't hold it against
him.
MR. BARTELSs

No* Your Honor.

But I think the

point is that what De't. 'Learning did and' the' way ' in' which' hi
mad© that Christian burial speech was psychologically
coercive, and this Court has recognised in the past that
there —
QUESTION:

How does it coerce somebody?

MR. BARTELS;

Your Honor# I think that Det. Learning

was trying to play on the defendant's psychological weaknesses#
to make him do something that he would not have done under
any just ordinary question and answer in the case, and teat
to piny on those kinds of weaknesses amounts to psychological
coarcion.

If there is anything besides physical coercion*

Your Honor, I vaink this is the case.
QUESTIONS

Giver» the record as it now .is, Mr,

Bartels, if the only evidence introduced against, your client
the defendant, at trial was his statement "Did you find felt
shoes?" — let's assume nothing else beyond that — would
you say that should have been excluded under tho. exclusion
ary rule?
MR. BARTELSs

Your Honor, X doubt it,

I think

there might have had to ba soma further inquiry than by tin
trial courts, both Federal and State, in terms of whether
that question was somehow connected to the Christian burial

That is not what we

Wb are talking about the other in­

formation that was provided as a result of -the Christian
burial speech and the other questioning that took place.
QUESTION:

Do you think it would not be incriminat­

ing evidence to have that introduced?
MR. BARTELS.:

Your Honor, I think that would have

been probably admissible at barely relevant on 'the issue ©f
whether'-QUESTION:

ftell, was it incriminating?

MR, BARTELSs

Wall, Your Honor, I think if it

weren't incriminating, it wouldn't be relevant, so ray anwwer

38
is, yes, I think It might b® regarded as somewhat incrimin*a ting,
QUESTION?

Now, I am assuming that th® situation

would prevail that he would not take th© stand, do you
suggest that th® prosecutor couldn't make a great deal of
capital out of that in his closing arguments, along wit! all
th® other circumstances, th© evidence at the MCA, the man
was sasn carrying a bundle with the legs of a small child,
th© feet with shoes on?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor,

I t ink someone might

make r r©thing out of this question about the shoes.

On the

other hand, 'there war© a number of — well, I think that can
also be explained as curiosity and wanting to know what;
evidence has bean found.
Now, admittedly, Your Honor, I think it would be
rolev-: at and it would be something that the prosecutor could
use.

I can only say, as a prosecutor, that I would far

rather have the fact that th® defendant showed th© location

of t"

tody and knew the location of th© shoes and so forth.
QUESTION:

Yas, that is conclusive.

That is con­

clusive-.
MR. BARTELS:

And I think the question here is

whethsr — than whether the admission of the other statements
about the location of th© body was harmless beyond reason­
able doubt.

QUESTIONs

How about the search for the clothing

and tha blanket; do you think that would have b®en cdraissible?

MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think that is further

Your Honor, in addition to this agreement — perhaps
I ought to clarify some more ~
QUESTION:

Let m ask you one question about the

■agreement, if I may, Mr. Bartels, along the line I asked the
Attorney General about you.”: theory.

Suppose I am defense

counsel and you are a prosecuting attorney, and I cm© to
you and 1 say I know you've got my client under suspicion;
her© is a thousand dollars, you promise not to interrogate
him for.the nosst ten days.

Wow, you take the thousand

dollars and you call him before & grand jury five days
later, do you think that is an enforceable agreement?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, 2 think it is., and act

because of th® thousand dollars.

I think what is crucial

about th© agreement her©, Your'Honor, is that Mr. McKhigh
was mislead into not doing other things h@ could have don
to further protect th© defendant's rights, like asked to go
along in th® police car, like inform the defendant in much
detail about his rights and about the crucial importunes
in terns of th® admissibility of evidtme© at -trial that hinot disclose th® body or the location of tha body directly
to the poire® officers, rather than through counsel, whic;:
was obviously Mr. McKnight’s intent.
QUESTION:

You think then that an agreaaw'int between

parti? s like this is enforceable just as if it were a con-tract?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, let me clarify it.

I

think it is enforceable on behalf of th® defendant, that if
any interrogation takas place during that time, that it is
ivspror ©r, that is in violation of the right to counsel.

The

thousand dollars is clearly improper, but it has no bearing

QUESTIONS

When what you arcs saying is that it ir;

improper because it is a violation of the constitutional
right, not because of Iowa contract law?
MR. BARTELS;

That’s right. Your Honor.

The els-

!

fendant has the right to the assistance of counsel, and on©
of the kinds of assistance that counsel can give is to make
agreements of this sort with the prosecutor, and this type
of agreement is likely to change the course of conduct by
th© defense counsel in terms of what else ha would have don©
to protect those rights in the absence of th© agreement.
QUESTION?

But the agreement itself isn’t

separately enforceable to bar the evidence, it is simply a
factor to be taken into consideration to see whither the
»

defendant • t; constitutional rights have bean violated?
MR. BARTELS s

I think that is

&

true characterisa­

tion, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Mr. Bartels, you keep raising th© point

•about not letting him ride in th® car.

Wasn't he told that

it wae against police regulations, it was impossible?
MR. BARTELS;

H® was told it was impossible, Your

Honor, and I —
QUESTION;

Isn’t that true?

MR, BARTELS:

Your Honor, I don't know.

nothing in the record to suggest -that.

Thera is

I am not quit® sure,

42

in these circumstances —
questions

Well, any police regulations you read

will tell you that lawyers can’t ride in ears with their
clients.
MR. BARTELS:

We are not•again saying that Mr.

Kelly had an enforceable right to be in the car.
QUESTION*

I was saying I thought you put too mvtah

emphasis on it, that's all.
MR. BARTELSs

I think the point of it. Your Hontc:,

is that when the police were going to have -the defaidant
isolated from his counsel in that way, for whatevcn: raasoiv;,
that they were then required not to question, not only be­
cause of the agreement but because of the other indication ,
that the defendant should not bs questioned or provide in™
formation in tha absence of his attorney•
Your Honor, we could pretend that Mr. Kelly didn't
even «mist and the case would have to go tha sane way.

It.

is simply a factor.
Now, any of these factors I guess I have neglected
to talk about, although the Attorney General has.

The

several statements by 'the defendant that he would till the
whole story after, and Mr. Turner I think inadvertently left
after he saw Mr. Me Knight in Des Moines, not after he got
back to Des Moines.

it was clearly a reference

these statements in bet. Learning's testimony*

'm

counsel in

Ito, any of the facts that I have discussed so far
taken individually would have constitutionally precluded
Dot. Learning from engaging in the interrogation that took
place her©. .And in the face of all of them, he did engage
in these efforts to obtain information and specifically £■■
the purpose of getting it. before» the defendant could, reach
McKnight.

H© concedes that that, was his purpose.
New, that kind of purposeful attempt to obtain,

information, given all of this background about the agree­
ment, tl© other indications that there should be no question­
ing, the fact that defendant had counsel with regard to &
crime with which he had been charged, that purposeful in­
terrogation in light'of all those facts, clearly is a viola­
tion of the defendant's right to counsel under the sixth
and Fourteenth Amendments.

And that is quit® apart from any

considerations of Miranda v. Arizona here? ever, if that case
didn't exist, w® would still have the same result..
'Now, at the same time, it is true that Miranda
provides an alternative basis —
QUESTION:

Well, it is the only basis that the

Eighth Circuit rested on, isn't it?
MR. BARTELS:

No, Your Honor, I think that the

Eighth Circuit’s decision also rested on th® Sixth Amend­
ment's right to counsel, if I recall it correctly,
QUESTION:

You think so?

44
MR. BARTELSs

Yes, Your Honor.

I think clearly

the District Court's decision rested on sevarai grounds..
The Eighth Circuit did not deal with the volunt,ariress
)

issue, Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

It didn't touch it at ail, did it?

MR. BARTELSs

No, Your Honor.

It simply affirmed

and its discussion of the grounds for affirmance did. not.
include any discussion of voluntariness.

But I think the

meaning of that is that tha District Court's decini^n on
that stood, and still stands.
QUESTION;

Well, if the District Court's lecisiun

on that stood in the view of the Eighth Circuit
v

why would

it have been necessary to get into issues like Miranda and
Why wouldn't it simply have affirm A

the right of counsel?

on the involuntariness point?
MR, BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, I think the Eighth

Circuit was faced with a choice of several equal theories,
any om or two or three of which it could have discussed,
•sad ih&r® was really nothing about any of them that said
that '•.±4is issue or that should issue should be the on© that

you rely on primarily.

I think the Court of Appeals went

priisr:on the Sixth Amendment and Miranda grounds, and I
gather simply decided that it wasn't really necessary to rQLso
make the alternative finding of Voluntariness•

'QUESTIONS

If ws should, if this Court should .reject

45

the Miranda and the Sixth Aaiandment grounds and b@ unwilling
to pass upon the involuntariness grounds, I suppose: that th®
case should b© sent back to the Eighth Circuit so that it.
could consider whatever the state had to say about the
involuntariness finding being clearly erroneous?
HR, BARTELSs

No, Your Honor, 1 don’t think so.

The Eighth Circuit, the voluntariness issue was clearly pr©
seated to the Eighth Circuit and was; litigated there, and I
think the affirmance of the lower court opinion means that
th® lower court decision was —
QUESTION:

Wall, the first sentence in the Eighth

Circuit’s opinion refers to voluntariness.
MR. BARTELSi
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Except in the dissent.

MR. BARTELS %

In the dissent, Your Honor, it war

raised and challenged at that point, and I think, that reflects
th© fact that it was litigated and considered.
Now, under th© Miranda case — and I touch on this
very briefly — there is also clearly —
QUESTION:

Op to now your argument hasn't relied on

th© Miranda case, am I correct in that?
MR. BARTELS;
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

I think —

You relied rather on what Massiah and

Escobedo and basically on the —
MR. BARTELS;

That's right.

QUESTION:

— Sixth and Fourteenth JVracndxa-snts?

MR. BARTELS:

That’s right? Your Honor.

Everything

I said I think about th© facts also relates to *±v. lirendu

from Miranda or Escobedo,
Under Miranda? again? there is this altar: ative
ground? and I think in fact there are two ways of looking rt
it: under Miranda.

Probably th© most important way her® i

that since th© defendant himself and through counsel incite itsd
rather clearly that h© did not wish to make any statements in
th© absence of counsel, Miranda says interrogation oust

period.

I think this Court's opinions in Michigan v.

Mosley clarified that and reaffirmed that: distinction between
indications of a desire to have a lawyer and indications
th© right to remain silent.

:

So that there is no qursric-n

Evan under th© right to remain silent rubric? as
I read Mosley? Your Honor, there was a clear .‘Length of time
during which th© right to remain silent had been invoked,.
It was: about th® same crime, and th® Mosley analysis on that
point also wouldn’t apply to this case.

But th® counsel

point is still much clearer.
Your Honor? I think also ought to make seme statemint'; about waiver here.

I think the stateTs primary

defense really hare is that somehow there was a waiver.

And

t'

what Mr. 'Turner hasn't relied upon her® first of all is the
question "Did you find the shoes?"

and secondly the fact

that the defendant provided information.

Your

:, neither

y.®zm

of those statements in any way cam be said to be an indica™
tion of "I want to waive my lawyer •"

There is not < van an.

inference to be drawn there from the statement.
QUESTION%

is there not another question, the

question of waiving the right to remain silent on tils very
crucial subject?
MR. BARTELS;
QUESTION;

Your Honor

I think there is a. different question

from waiving the right to a lawyer, is it not?
MR, BARTELS;

That's right. Your Honor.

I think

the second problem with the state's view here is th«.t both
of these: statements com© after the defendant'a right not to
fca questioned in the absence of his lawyer has already
occurred.

And surely, Your Honor, the waiver has to precede

the violation in order to take care of it.
QUESTION:

That right stains from Miranda that you

are arguing now, does it not?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think it; stems both

from Miranda and from fch© Sixth Amendment right to Lav©
the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to have assistance
of counsel during this kind of critical stage after a charge

has been filed.

th© Court;
Hi the few minutes I have left, I thought 1
perhaps should address a question that was rails ac fay Mr
Justice Blackman earlier in my opponents * sxgrr.&nv, and Chat
is the applicability of the Stone and Rica case?, to fchi;
particulax case.
I think the simplest answer to the question is
that issue has never been raised here,
below.

it was never raired

It was not presented in th® petition for certio"? c-xi •

It was not address in th® petitioner's brief on the merits,
and it was not even —
QUESTION:

It might be because Stone- comas dev;..?,

too strong on -r
MR. BARTELS s

Your Honor , I think th® issue could

have been raised, as it was by th® litigants in the Stone
egr-e.

But more significantly, I think, Your Honor, ever- in

the reply brief that was filed last weak, there was certainly
no mention of this issue by the state.
QUESTION;
v. I ewe 11?

What would you have to say .about Stone

Would you think that would oatafrol here?

MR. BARTELS8

No, Your Honor.

QUESTIONS

Tell 'IS why.

Wall, Your Honor, I think that the

MR. BARTELSs

rational® in those cas«as was pretty carefully limited to
the purposes of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule,, c:id
I think this Court has recognized that thera are raihrr
different purposes behind that exclusionary rul

th-s-n, for

example, the protection of the right, to counsel that is i vvolved in this case.

For the Court to apply Stone and Rice

in this case would he a tremendous expansion of the Stone,
and Rice, well beyond the rationale I think that, the Court,
offered in that case, which basically related to the purely
rationale of the Fourth Amendment, and I don't think wa hev©
that hare, particularly

with regard to the Sirth

undertones of the case.
Your Honor, what the state basically asks this
Court to do in this particular case is to hold fcnat law
enforcement officers may do virtually anything short of
physical violence or threats of physical violence tc obtain
information from persons formally charged with crime, during
interrogation processes•

And a reversal of the Court of

Appeals and the District Court opinions in this case woulc
mean, among other things, that the police would be completely
/

free to ignore the existence ©£ counsel in a criminal case ?
and, indeed, it would go further than that, and tc
30uns-nl

evade

through what the state itself has ’ termed trickery ’and

deceit .

Yonr Honor, that result would b© con-fcrsiry to the

precedents of this Court, it would emasculate

t': c

Fifth a- id

Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments in this kind of situation,
and it would also make it virtually impossible for defeats*
counsel to operat® in a sensible way in dealing with clients
and police- in criminal cases.
Thank you.
MR. chief JUSTICE BURGER:
I think ‘the state has used its time.

Thank you, gentlemen.
Th® case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 1:05 o’clock p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
