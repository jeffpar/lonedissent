P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76~40 4, Illinois Briqk Company against Illinois,,
Mr. Hatton, I think you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD H. HATTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HATTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, arid may it please the

Court:
This is a case -that's before the Court on the granting
of a petition for certiorari to the Seventh Circuit Court of
Appeals.

The Seventh circuit Court of Appeals had reversed
!

a summary judgment granted by the district court in favor of
the defendants in an indirect' purchaser case.
The issue thus posited before this Court, as we view
it, is the application of Hanover Shea to the indirect purchaser
pass-on theories that have been much discussed in the bar and
before the lower courts „• in the context of the facts of this
proceeding.
I would like now, with the Court’s permission, to turn
to a description of the proceedings below. That is, in the
district court.
This particular case, the State off Illinois case,
is not a class action case,, as you know.

The State of Illinois

case was one of a series of cases filed in the Federal
District Court, in the Northern District of Illinois, Chicago

4
of courseThese cases were commenced by, or stimulated, if you
will, by the filing by the Antitrust Division of indictments
and a civil injunction complaint alleging that the defendant
manufacturers have conspired illegally under section 1 of the
Sherman Act to increase the price of concrete block.
That proceeded to stimulate a series of other cases,
including the State of Illinois case»

The other cases included

class action and other direct action cases seeking treble
damages by , masonry contractors, by owner-builders , and by
general contractors, and by the State of Illinois»
The indictments ■—ca; nolo
b£ the indictments»

contendere pleas disposed

The antitrust consent decree disposed of

the Anti.trust Division civil case.

And the other civil cases,

treble-damage suits, class actions, were all settled except
-for 'the State of Illinois case»
Thus we turn to the State of Illinois case, the
amended complaint filed by the State of Illinois in the district
court.

The amended complaint filed by the State of Illinois

was for and on behalf of itself, and other State and local
entities, so-called governmental entities»

These entities

were listed and enumerated on Appendix A of the amended complaint
filed by 'the State of Illinois.

There are some 700 of them.

As I wish to indicate, -this is not a class action
case

5
The amended complaint alleged a price- fixing con­
spiracy by the defendant

manufacturers of concrete block, and

alleged that the plaintiff and the Appendix A plaintiffs had
either purchased or directly or indirectly paid for concrete
block»
I would new, with the Court’s permission, describe the
industry»
The conspiracy charge is in the.Chicago urban area»
The defendants are manufacturers of concrete block located in
that area and distributing in -that area»
Concrete block is used as a minor component in
building structures, such as commercial office buildings,
industrial and public buildings»

Here, of course, we are

dealing with a public building of the State of Illinois and
the alleged Appendix A entities»

However, the owners of

public buildings in this instance do not buy concrete block»
They buy a completed building, which is a package of materials,
goods and services»
The bidding process may be briefly described as
follows;

The awarding authority for the construction of a

public building will necessarily send out plans and specifications and seek bids from general contractors»

The general

contractors, in preparing their bids, usually seek quotations
from various kinds and types of subcontractors, including
mas 0^.^ s ub contractors»

6
The masonry subcontractors quote not only concrete
block in contemplation of -the specifications for the masonry
package, but also necessarily are bidding on a package, a
masonry subcontract package, if you will# consisting of goods
and services and the components, whatever they may be»
The general contractors in the State of Illinois case
then proceed to submit their bids, competitive bids, their
sealed bids under State statutory requirements for competitive
bidding, and of course the awarding authority then awards, if
he elects to do so, then elects to award the contract to the
.lowest responsible bidder»

And the general contractor thus is

the successful bidder providing the package of

goods and.

services, namely a building, in which a component of that
building may be concrete block and which may in turn have been
under subcontract from a masonry subcontractor»
I would now like to turn to -- having the industry
background in mind and the nature of the proceeding, to turn
to the procedures below, particularly as relates to the
collection of evidence in support of the summary judgment
motion which we made on behalf of our defendants, and which
the district court granted»
At the onset of the case, we were of course concerned
with disposing of the criminal case and the other civil litiga­
tion other than the State _of ^Illinois case»
After the protracted negotiations that took place in

7
connection with the settling of the other cases, we then
served upon the State of Illinois interrogatories.

The purposes

of the interrogatories inter alia were to support a motion for
summary judgment on behalf of the defendants, on the grounds
that the plaintiff and the Appendix A entities did not
purchase concrete block.

They were indirect purchasers , and,,

under Ilanover Shoe, could not state a claim for relief.
Thus the intention of our original interrogatories,
which appear in the Appendix, was to determine whether the
plaintiffs did -- that the plaintiffs did not purchase concrete
block, they purchased through competitive bid a complete
building, that the buildings were not awarded on the basis of
a px-e-existing cost-plus-price contract or similar pricing
arrangement, but rather were on the basis of competitive bids.
During the course of our negotiations, as
necessarily required by the district court to reach agreement
on objections to interrogatories, we reached an understanding
with counsel for plaintiff, Mr, Ls© Freeman, Sr,, that instead
of — a more expeditious and more efficient way of obtaining
this information was through questionnaires.

And, accordingly,

questionnaires were prepared and circulated to each one of the
700-odd Schedule A plaintiffs, Appendix A plaintiffs,
Mr, Freeman, in the Appendix, by letter, at page 208
of the Appendix, explains the purposes.

The purpose was simply

to provide a method to obtain the information desired by o^lr

8

interrogatories through the questionnaire process, and thus to
elicit from those responding to the questionnaire the facts
that we believed necessary to have this case, fall into what we
believe to be the Hanover doctrine as contained in the Hanover
decision of this Court, and the rationale of the Hanover case»
The results of the questionnaire may be summarised
as follows:

Of the somewhat in excess of 700 Appendix A

Entities, 253 responded.
block directly.

Only four plaintiffs bought concrete

Of the remaining 249, none bought concreta

block directly, but bought buildings„ which were competitively
bid, with no pre-existing cost-plus contract or similar pricing
arrangement involved.
The results were quoted by Judge Kirkland, who is the
district judge who wrote the opinion sustaining our motion for
summary judgment, as follows:
Approximately one-third of the more than 700 plaintiffs
represented by the State have responded to interrogatories
propounded by defendants.

The responses reveal that only four

of the plaintiffs purchased concrete block directly from a
defendant.

One plaintiff disclosed it had made direct purchases

from a non™defendant.

The remaining responding plaintiffs did

not purchase concrete block directly from any defendant, nor
did they purchase concrete block indirectly pursuant to a costplus contract.
During the process, the parties, as appears at

9
Appendix 202 and 203* in contemplation of our motion for
summary judgment which was to be filed and which we had dis~
cussed with the court — who was then Judge Power* before he
went on, was elevated to the- Court of Appeals — along with
the briefing schedule.

And it was agreed by stipulation of the

parties that until our motion for summary judgment on the
indirect purchaser Hanover Shoe doctrine had been determined*
as well as several other then pending motions* that discovery
that all other discovery would be stayed until a disposition
by the district court of principally our

motion

for a summary

judgment on the indirect purchaser theory.,
And that is contained in the Appendix* our printed
Appendix* at page

stipulation and motion at pages 202 and

203.
I note this in passing because some of -the intervening
briefs have seemingly indicated that the court cut off
discovery.

It was not in fact that way.

Discovery was*, by

agreement, stayed until the district court had reached a
decision on our motion for partial summary judgment.
QUESTION:

I am having some difficulty* Mr. Hatton*

tracking just how this is relevant to the central issue.
MR. HATTON:

Well* the problem is -that there has

been — Mr. Freeman* in his brief on behalf of the State of
Illinois, along with some of the amicus curiae, has stated
that there are not facts sufficient in this record to permit

10

this Court to reach the issue which# I agree.# is decisive0
That was the reason for my — I will turn now to the
issue before this Court»
It is our view.of Hanover# and we believe this to be
the issue before this Court# that Hanover holds# and I confess#
Mr» Chief Justice# I have some temerity in this# having in mind
that Mr» Justice White wrote the opinion in Hanover# and Mr»
Justice Stewart dissented# but on another issue»
QUESTION;
MR. HATTON;

It was a Court opinion»
Yes# I know# sir»

[Laughter.3
QUESTION;

You’re not obliged to agree with us# if

you don’t want to»
MR. HATTON; I thought I might agree with that one#
Your Honor»
In our view. Hanover holds;

one# -that the first

purchaser of an illegaly pries-fixed article has been injured?
No. 2# his injury is the amount of illegal overcharge exacted?
No. 3# the defendant is precluded from claiming that the buyer#
first, purchaser in this instance#

passed on the illegal over­

charge in whole or in part to his customer# 'die next buyer.
Unless the buyer resold the article pursuant to a pre-existing
cost-plus contract or similar arrangement.
That's what we believe Hanover held# is that the
first purchaser —

11
QUESTION :

Mr0 Hatton, part 3 of your interpretation

of Hanover, then,, would interpret it as a rule of law that
certain elements in mitigation of damages are simply not
admissible, —
MRo HATTON :
QUESTION:

That is correct»
— regardless of what might or might not

be their probative value»
MR. HATTON:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
We can assume in this case that the

settlement that your client made with the first purchasers was
made in the light of Hanover Shoe? is that correct?

Hanover

Shoe had been decided at the time of the settlement, right?
MR. HATTON:

Hanover Shoe had been decided.

However,

our settlement, if Your Honor please, was not with, the trebledamage claimantsv the treble-damage class action cases was not
in contemplation of Hanover Shoe.

It was simply an effort to

settle these cases very simply on as reasonable a basis as
possible.
QUESTION: Well, they were settled, weren’t they?
MR. HATTON:
QUESTION:
MR. HATTON:

Oh, yes, they were, Your Honor.
And therefore tire ~
Claim forms were sent out pursuant to

the normal Rule 23 procedure.
QUESTION:

And with the first purchasers.

MR. HATTON;

Pardon?

12
QUESTIONS And the plaintiffs were the first purchasers,
weren't they?

With whom you settled.

MR.. HATTON;

No, die treble-damage suits which we

settled, the class action in other cases were included, a
class of masonry contractors, —
QUESTION;
MR. HATTON s

Yes.
— a class of general contractors and a

class of owner-builders.

And so thus we were settling with

all tiers in tills process.
QUESTION; Well, I would think it would be helpful for
you to point out that your settlement with the first purchasers
was made in the light of Hanover Shoe, and that therefore they
were satisfied, that was in complete satisfaction of your
claim for damages, a claim against you for damages —
MR. HATTON:
QUESTION;

Yes, that’s correct.
— under the antitrust laws.

MR. HATTON: Right.
QUESTION:

But there’s nothing left.

MR. HATTON: Well, we had a pragmatic problem, —
QUESTION:
MR. HATTON:
QUESTION:
MR. HATTON:

Of course you did.
— as Your Honor knows, —
You always do when you settle a lav/suit.
when you settle these mass class

action cases.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't, see why you're resisting

13

the inference contained in my questione
QUESTIONS

Your theory, I suppose, Mr, Hatton, is

that you settled for the second and third tiers on a nuisance
value basis, and the first tier were paid 100 cents on the
dollar,

That would be --MR, HATTON:

Our theory was to get out of the cases

as inexpensively as we collide,
[Laughter, 3
QUESTIONS

That’s always what occurs when you settle

a lawsuit,
MR, HATTON:
QUESTION:

Yes,

Right,

But it was made on the understanding that

you could not assert -the defense of passing-on against the
first purchaser,
MR. HATTON:

I would suppose that’s right, Your Honor?

yes,
QUESTION:
MR, HATTON:

I would think so,
Yes,

Right,

But, however, there’s the other side to my description
of Hanover.

Because if ray reading of Hanover is correct,

primarily that the defendant is precluded from claiming other
than a cost-plus contract, that the buyer, the first purchaser,
passed on the illegal overcharge, which is certainly the
holding in Hanover,

Then, of necessity, no succeeding

purchaser from the first buyer is entitled to show that all or

14
a part of the illegal overcharge has been passed- on to him by
the first buyer? and seek a recovery in the amount of the
passed-on overcharge*
Thus, as we would view it, the issues before this
Court, very humbly stated, would be whether this Court should
confirm the applicability and the rationale of Hanover as
applied to this fact situation, or to overrule Hanover, or to
modify Hanover in some manner which would permit — because,
the basic difficulty, as we see it, is that under Hanover the
first purchaser, the defendant may not claim that the first
purchaser passed on a part of that overcharge to the next buyer,
Therefore, we say that that being so this Court is
now faced with the problem of either having to overrule
Hanover or to so construe it as to permit a defendant, if this
Court agrees to permit passing-on as a method of recovery
through tha various elements of a distribution process, to
permit the defendants to have the opportunity, if you will, of
showing that a part of that overcharge was passed on by the
first buyer*
That is, we believe that — we are getting kind of
caught in between, if you will*

So, thus, it is our position,

may the Court please, that under Hanover, as we interpret it,
the first purchaser has the right to recover the full measure
of in© overcharge and the defendant may not claim that a part
of that overcharge was passed on*

15
And fchusly v;e say that if that be true, then Hanover
should control this case, and that, in this instance, the
summary judgment granted by the district court in Chicago
should be sustained, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals
should be reversed*,
I will not attempt to burden the Court with a
recitation of the facts in Hanover, they are of course well
known.
I would, however, desire now -QUESTIONS
was it?

Hanover was not a price-fixing agreement,

It was a —
HR. HATTONs
QUESTION;
MR. HATTON;
QUESTION:

No, it was not.
— monopoly case.
Yes, it was.
But I doubt that that, makes any difference

to you.
MR. IIATTON;

No, it doesn’t.

I would likes now to analyse Hanover as it applies —
as w® believe it applies to the proceeding before this Court.
At page — in Hanover, this Court undertook to analyze
various kinds and types of hypothetical fact situations in
reaching its conclusion that the first purchaser is the parson
damaged, has the right to the overcharge, the overcharge that
he recovers — the amount that he recovers is the amount of
the overcharge, and the defendant may not argue that h® passed

16

on that overcharge in whole or in part to a succeeding buyer.,
This Court said;

If, in the face of the overcharge,

the buyer does nothing and absorbs the loss, he's entitled to
treble damages0
The second illustration is;

It is also clear that

if the buyer responding to the illegal price maintains his own
price but takes steps to increase his volume or so decrease
other costs, his right to damages is not destroyed,,

That is

also, I think, self-evident.
However, I now wish -to address myself to the third
area, I am now at 392 U.S., page 490.

Since this third

illustration is, I think, important heres
We hold that the buyer is equally entitled to
damages if he raises -the price for his own product.

We hold

that the buyer is equally entitled to damages if h® raises the
price for his own product.
The Court then continues;

As long as the seller

continues to charge the illegal price, he takes from the buyer
more than the law allows.
And this is repeated, or I guess concurred in, if
that is the appropriate description, by the Solicitor General
at page IS of his brief, footnote 13, where he says; "The fact
that a direct purchaser may recover, from its own customers,
the overcharge it paid does not necessarily mean that it
suffered no damage

C5

17
The Court continues this illustration at 392? page
493? by saying =— this is in response to an argument mad© by
United Shoes

The rule

t

,

United arguas

should be subject to

the defense that economic circumstances were such that the
overcharged buyer could only charge his customers a higher
price? because the pries to him was higher*,

It is argued that

ia such circumstances? the buyer suffers no loss from the
overcharge.
The Court continues;

This situation might be

present? it is said? where the overcharge is imposed equally
on all the buyer“s competitors and where the demand for the
buyer’s product is so inelastic that the buyer and his
competitors all increase their prices by the amount of the cost
increase without suffering a consequent decline in sales.
We are not impressed with the argument -that sound law of
economics require recognizing this defense.
The Court then goes on to explain? which I will not
reiterate? the wide range of factors influencing a company’s
pricing policies.
I emphasize? may the Court please? the several
excerpts from the Court’s opinion and? as well as what I believe
the appropriate description from the Solicitor General’s
brief? because I understand the State of Illinois to argue
that if an overcharge occurs? say? of five cents at the
manufacturer’s level? and thus the cost of the block goes from?

18
say# one dollar to one dollar and ten cents# and that while the
block is then sold to the masonry contractor with the only
variations that the price of the block being the percentage
markup which the masonry contractor may wish to take on his
total package# and the general contractor# whatever his bid
may be»
Thus# the State of Illinois is arguing that this
block for one dollar and ten cents chugs along through the
process at a dollar and ten cents# or certainly no less than
that.

That# as I understand# is one of their basic arguments

and that is the reason why I have sought to point out that
that argument is rejected in Hanover Shoe#and concurred in# if
I may# by the Solicitor General.
I would like to next turn to why we believe# as we
have indicated# the rule of Hanover should be applied to this
case.
As we have indicated in our previous discussion and
in our brief# we believe that the facts of our case fit the
rationale of Hanover.

We believe that by simply holding# as in

Hanover and in ‘this case# that the original purchaser has the
right of action# that the original purchaser has the right of
recovery# .arid teat the right of recovery is the amount of the
overcharge# and that tee defendant pray not argue or seek to
argue or prove teat tee first buyer passed on the overcharge
in whole or in part# provides the judicial system and this

19
Court with substantial reasons for maintaining Hanover, and
applying it to situations such as presented in the instant
case.
No. 1 is the troublesome problem of avoiding
duplicative recoveries, where you have multiple chances of
recovery of the distribution process, it is readily apparent
til at if the Hanover doctrine is applied and the rationale
applied to cases in the nature of this case, then there will
be an absolute avoidance of duplicative recoveries.

This is

so because the first purchaser has the right of recovery and
obtains the entire recovery.
It also avoids insurmountable evidentiary problems
in terms of complex judicial and legal proceedings noted by
this Court in Hanover.
Much has been made by both the State of Illinois and
by the Solicitor General on the need of the deterrent factor —
the deterrence factor, if you will, in private treble-damage
suits, such as idles© suits before this Court.

However, -the

Solicitor General and counsel for the State of Illinois make
too much of that argument, because it seems to us that
deterrence — if the Hanover rationale is applied here, the
deterrence is at the first level, and if the first level, the
direct buyer, has that right of action and that right of
total recovery, he has his incentive and that is your deterrence.
And I think it is also vary clear that the Solicitor

20

General, for .example, and to an extent the State of Illinois
indicates that maybe not all of the first buyers will sue.
The answer, of course, is that the first buyer in these
instances, in practically ail of these instances, are probably
going to be class action suits, which would be brought by one
first buyer for and on behalf of himself and all others
similarly situated»
It is thus for those reasons, we believe,
administrative, judicial savings, the deterrence factor, and
the reasoning which

vq

have indicated both in our brief and

argument, that we believe that Hanover should control hers.
Thank you, Your Honor»
QUESTION;

Mr» Hatton, before you sit down —

MR, HATTON s
QUESTIONS

Yes.
What would you do with the case where

the ultimate consumer sues, either individually or as a class,
and that the first buyers do not sue, and the statute of
limitations runs.

So it’s very clear that the first buyers

can never sue.
MR. HATTONj

That's the vacant class, yes. That

would be a vacant class„
QUESTION;

And the ultimate consumers have sued

within the limitations period, but now the statute of
limitations has run and the first purchasers haven't sued, and
itfs clear now they cannot sue.

Would you allow that -“-recovery

21

ia that case?
MRo HATTONs The answer is;

No, I would not-

And I will explain why.
We quoted Bangor Punta in our brief as an example
of ~
QUESTION:

Which Bangor Punfca?

We have a lot of them.

The one involving the railroad?
MR. HATTON s
QUESTION;
MR. HATTON;

Yes.
Bangor & Aroostook, or whatever it was.
Correct.

I think the answer to the question is, the practical
answer to your question# Mr. Justice Stewart, is that that is
a very unlikely situation.
QUESTION;

Well, let’s hypothesize the existence

of it, unlikely as it may be.
MR. HATTON;

My answer to your question, Your Honor,

I would say no, they would not have the opportunity of suing.
That is tiie right, under Hanover Shoe, of the first purchaser.
The first purchaser does not exercise that right
under your illustration, the statute of limitations runs
against the indirect and ultimate consumer, who has filed suit,.
I would say, in my judgment —
QUESTION;

No, no, no.

has not run.
MR. HATTON;

I see

The statute of limitations

22
QUESTION;

Against the ultimate consumers. They

filed their suit ~~
MR. HATTON; Right,
QUESTION;

— before the statute had run, within the

limitations.
MR, HATTON;

All right, 15ve got the reverse, then,

QUESTION; And now, subsequently, the statute of
limitations has run and would bar any suit by anybody else,
MR, HATTON; By any direct purchaser.
QUESTION;
MR. HATTON;

Correct,
I would say, applying our view of

Hanover, Your Honor, that the indirect purchasers would not
have a claim.

I think -that has to be the inevitable logic of

it.
What I was going tc say, I think, however, that would
be very, as a practical matter, very unlikely.
QUESTION;

I don't think so.

MR, HATTON; Because if tie first purchaser has the
right of action, as we believe he has under Hanover, to obtain
the full overcharge, I can assure you there are quite a few
first purchasers around, and their counsel would be very —

23

QUESTIONi

«-for business or other reasons,,

MR® HATTON:
QUESTION:

That is very correct, Your Honor®
Mr® Hatton, if we decide the case the

way you ask us to, why, probably those ultimate consumers
wouldn’t even bother filing that lawsuit®
MR® HATTON:
QUESTION:
imperative.

1 would think that is right®
Of course, Mr® Hatton, it isn’t necessarily

The buyers in several tiers have the same period

of limitations®

Is that not so?

So that the period for the first purchaser might have
expired, and then someone down the line would sue and still be
within his statute of limitations®
MR® HATTONs

That might be conceivable. Your Honor®

Of course we have the four-year statute of limitations®

And

it is taking a rough rule of thumb that before your statute —
fraudulent concealment is of course normally, as in this case,
alleged.

Extending the statute backwards, you are talking

about, when the statutes expires going

forwards, and a rough

rule of thumb is whan a government, an antitrust indictment
comes out brought by the government, that normally relates to
the starting of the statute of limitations, having in mind
fraudulent concealment®
I would think it might be possible, but it would be
doubtful®

Because it seems to me it would cut — the

statute of limitations would pertain to everybody in terms of —

24
unless there were differences of knowledge# of course„
QUESTION:

If you read Hanover as establishing a rule

of law against any indirect purchaser having a cause of action#
how do you — how would you explain the cost-plus situation
which Hanover nevertheless seems to have recognised as extending
a cause of action?
MR. HATTON:

Yes# very understandably, Your HSnor.

Because# having in mind the Court's opinion in Hanover# as I
read the Court's opinion# it was the question of the difficulties
described by the Court of well nigh insuperable proof as to the
pricing decisions made after the first purchase*

And# of

course # as this Court well knows # this Court in Hanover went
through a large number of hypothetical illustrations about
what, would affect the pricing decision of the first buyer
when he re-sells# of '.She further process of re-selling# labor#
price fluctuations, competitive considerations*
And thus the cost-plus exception is an easily
identifiable exception because ‘that price is traced right
through# if I make myself clear*
QUESTION; Well# how .about in bidding?
How about in bids# submitting bids to a public
authority?

MR® HATTON:

Submitting bids to a public authority.

There are two types of Submitting bids to .-public authorities#
Mr. Justice White# one# of course# is the building itself#

25

which, under the competitive bidding under sealed bid with,
I think, three or four bidders„

In terms of bidding to public

authorities on a cost-plus contract?

Very seldom,

QUESTION; Well, most bidders when they submit a bid
have soma papers of their own that they have — by means of
which they have calculated their bid, and if you look at those
papers it might be very easy to tell at what price they put
in brick or what price they put in this, that, or the other
thing,

"-■QUESTION: Well,in those cases —
MR. HATTON; The problem of tracing the concrete
blocks is to what you’re referring.

Concrete block is of

course sold by the concrete block manufacturer to the — in
most instances — to the masonry subcontractor. The reason
til© masonry subcontractor is buying concrete block is because

26
he, in -turn, is submitting a quotation to a general contractor
on a masonry subcontracte

It may include concrete block,

probably undoubtedly would include brick, and plaster and
mortar and labor end the whole ball of wax.

Yes, you can

trace the price that the subcontractor, the masonry subcontractor
paid to the concrete block manufacturer*
However, when the masonry subcontractor submits his
quotation to the general, he's got a package of bride and
block and whatnot, and —

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD H. HATTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — Resumed
MR. HATTON:

May tie Chief justice please, may the

Court please:
I was in medias res , I think, in answering a question
of Mr. Justice White.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Would you raise your voice

a little, Mr. Hatton?
MR. HATTON:

Yes„

I v?as in the process of, in the middle of responding
to a question of Mr. Justice White.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

All right, you can go

ahead and finish it.
MR. HATTON*

Thank you. Your Honor.

If I understand the question, Mr. Justice White, it
is in terms of whether, regardless of what county it may be,
the

whether there is a line item for concrete block that

follows through.
My answer to that is contained, I think, in the
understanding, of course, that at 'the masonry contractor level,
the masonry contractor is bidding or submitting a quotation to
the general for the entire masonry contract.

The general, in

28
tura, uses that quotation in the formulation of his over-all
bid for the entire building.

And thus you have two free and

unrestrained markets with which we are here involved, both
subject —
QUESTIONs Well, what about the general contractor,
could he sue?
MR, HATTONs

No, he could not, on our theory of

Hanover Shoe,
QUESTION:

So you don't need to go any further?

MR, HATTON:

That's correct,

QUESTION; But you don't think there is even an
identifiable line item in the bid of toe general contractor?
MR, HATTON:

I am not sure, Your Honor,

It would --

QUESTION; Well, maybe you shouldn't say no that he
couldn't sue, should you?
MR, HATTON: Well, because you're talking — because
the theory, if v;e understand Hanover, and we have an example at
page 10 of our brief —
QUESTION:
MR. HATTON;

Your reply brief or your main brief?
It is our reply brief, Your Honor,

It is in toe second paragraph, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. HATTON:

Yes.
"If block costs $1.10, he may conclude

that he can only mark the job up 5 parcent, whereas he might
have been able to mark to© job up 8 percent if block had been

29

only $1.00.

If the masonry contractor reduces his markup

because block costs me;re, he is injured by lice overcharge and
there has been no pass-on."
What we*re saying is, Your Honor, this is entirely
different from fee cost-plus exception, the pre-existing costplus exception to Hanover, and in. no way relates to that type
of cost-plus exception or other similar pricing arrangement
by which I take to mean similar to cost-plus which really
guarantees a buyer that he will get that product at cost-plus
a previously agreed upon percentage.
May the Chief Justice please, I would like to reserve;
the balance remaining, if any, for rebuttal, if necessary.

MR. HATTON:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE A. FREEMAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FREEMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, end may it please

the Court;
As Justice Rehnquist noted, this case comes here on
a strictly legal issue.

The case was decided in the district

court on the question of standing.

Itrs been argued by the

defendants throughout, other proceedings, &a a matter of law.
Th© concrete block defendants make the assertion that as a
matter of law the State of Illinois is precluded from showing

30
that it9s been damaged*,
QUESTIONs

Let me ask you this, Mr. Freeman, if I may.

MR. FREEMANS
QUESTIONS

Sure.

On® thing that at least tentatively

troubles me about the Seventh Circuit’s opinion is that it
seems to me they have not said that sauce for the goose is
sauce for the gander, which may not be a Black’s Dictionary
phrase, but is at least a concept of equity.
It seems to me what they have said is that although
Hanover Shoe says as a matter of lav/, this type of evidence is
inadmissible to mitigate damages on the part of an antitrust
defendant, when you’re talking about an antitrust plaintiff
itss admissible and it just goes to a question of how much,
how convincing it is to the trier of fact.
Now, do you understand the Seventh Circuit’s opinion
that way, or do you understand it differently?
MR. FREEMAN;

Well, I would understand it differently.

I would say that this case is distinguishable from Hanover Shoe,,
and whereas in a situation of Hanover Shoe, where you have the
purchase of a capital item and you have all of these probleats
attendent upon determining unit cost and output and price,
that in those situations the direct purchaser has the cause of
action.
And that that’s what the Seventh Circuit held in
Commonwealth Edison vs. Allis-Chaimers.

It had a decision to

31

that effect which was right on point with Hanover Shoe.
In the Hanover Shoe situation, indeed, the indirect
or individual consumers of shoes may be too remote, you may
have to draw the line there»

I think what the Seventh Circuit

was saying is that this case is one of those clear exceptions
to Hanover Shoe which was envisioned by this Court when it
pointed to the cost-plus situation®

It recited to the facts

in th© record, the allegations of the complaint, which are
accepted as true, teat the defendants sat down in the hotel
room, they fixed th© price of concrete block at a dollar a
block, and teat the plaintiffs, tee State of Illinois, when it
built its schools, was damaged by the fact that the defendants
fixed the price of the block at a certain figure.
QUESTION s

Then you view Hanover Shoe not as a

general ruling on admissibility of evidence, but more or less
as a ruling on the facts of teat case that certain types of
evidence were just so remote that they shouldn't have been
allowed in?
MR® FREE?*»Ns

In essence", I think th© concern of tee

court was that under tee facts of Hanover, the only parson who
would sue was the person who leased the machine.

I don’t

know of any reported cases in that sort of situation where tee
ultimate consumers have sued, and therefore it- would be — that
would be the only person who could effectively enforce the
laws

32

In our situation, the ultimate plaintiff is the only
person who can effectively enforce the laws. the ultimate or
indirect purchaser*
I think there is authority that in certain instances
a rule of evidence can apply against a defendant and not a
plaintiff, for instance, on profit-and~loss data.

Defendants

can91 put in profit-and-loss data, but there are cases holding
that plaintiffs can show exorbitant, profits to demonstrate
conspiracy.
But I don*t think you have to go that far to rule in
favor of the State of Illinois in this case.
I think you have a spectrum of cases, on© is the
cost-plus on one side, and the other is what we would call the
overhead or capital equipment type case, where Hanover Shoe
may have been subject to paying too much rent as a result ©f a
conspiracy among landlords in the town where it operated.
Clearly, the purchaser of the shoe is too remote from
that sort of injury.

But we contend that this situation, the

construction industry situation is at the clear end ©f the
cost-plus spectrum. And the cases so held both before and
after Hanover Shoe.
QUESTION:

Mr. Freeman, is it then your view, just

so I have it clear, that if you are at the cost-plus end of
the spectrum, you say you're close to it here, close enough to
ba in that part of Hanover Shea, does that mean that the direct

33
purchaser — if the direct purchaser were the plaintiff# that
the defendants then would have that passing-on defense avail­
able?
MR» FREEMANs

Yes „

And the Tenth Circuit has so

held in a case we cited# Standard Industries vs. Mobil 0.11»
That defense, was submitted to the jury.
Clearly# if there is going to be an allocation among
plaintiffs in differant levels of the chain of distribution,
the* defendant is going to hat/© the opportunity to show who
actually was damaged.
QUESTIONt
never

So that it isn't a question ~ there would

be a problem of multiple recovery under your view# then#

it's always just a problem of how far along the spectrum is
the particular industry situation?
MR. FREEMAN:

Yes # there would not be — there

certainly can't be a question of multiple recovery in tinis case#
because everybody in the chain of distribution sued the
defendants # and the defendants settled not only with the
contractors but they settled with the private builders# who
stood in exactly 'She same position as the State of Illinois.
So they were all in together ~
QUESTION:

They mad® a foolhardy settlement under

your view of the law with the direct purchasers # because they
had a complete pass-on defense as to them.
MR. FREEMAN:

I don't even — as Mr. Hatton candidly

34
conceded, I don't even think they were thinking about Hanover
Shoe when they made their settlement, —
QUESTION ;

NOo

MR. FREEMAN;

— because the law as it existed when

this settlement was mad® was clearly that the State of Illinois
had standing to bring its action.

You had the State _o_f ^Illinois1.

vso Brisfcol-lSyers in the D. C. Circuit, you had -the Western
Liguid__Asphalt cas© in the Ninth Circuit, you had Master Key
in the Second Circuit, you had Armco Steel in the Eighth
Circuit, you had Sfcandard Indnotries in the Tenth Circuit.
QUESTIONs

Well, I don't mesa to interrupt your

litany, but what your point is, as I understand it, is that
if one knew in advance, in a particular treble-damage followup
on a government case, whether or not it's of the capital item
variety or the cost-plus variety, then one would know which
tier of purchasers could sue and no on® else could suei’

So

that then one would be advised to settle only with the potential
plaintiffs and would know they had complete defense as to the
other.
MR. FREEMANs Well, they know in -She capital equipment
situation, I think, that they have a complete defense.
QUESTION; As the consumers.

And, conversely here,

if you're correct, —MR. FREEMAN;
QUESTION:

Yes.

— they would know they have a complete

35

defense as to the direct purchaser*,
MRo

defense*,

FREEMAN;

Well, they may or may not have a comp la 15®

In this situation I think it*s a matter of proof.

In this situation I think they cannot rely on a decision
saying that the general contractor always passes on the over­
charge? in this situation I think it would be a matter of
proof and something to be determined by a jury.
QUESTION;

I see.

But at least they would have the

right to offer the proof in this situation.
MR. FREEMAN;
proof.

They have -the right to offer the

And I think that that would answer Justice Stewart’s

question, too.

There are many situations in which direct

purchasers don’t sue.

You asked if there were some examples.

Master Key was an example.

Western Liquid Asphalt was an

example. Armeo Steel, in the Eighth Circuit, was an example.
Direct purchasers did not sue, and the people who
recovered were the State of North Dakota, the State of
California, the State of Illinois.
'

The type of settlement that’s made in this case was

exactly the type of settlement which the courts have condemned
in the plumbing fixtures cases.

In the plumbing fixtures cases,

the defendant settled with the contractors for a million
dollars.

They made a nuisance settlement with their direct

purchasers, and when someone appealed to the Third Circuit,
trying to upsst that settlement, the Third Circuit, which had

36
ruled in Mangano that only direct purchasers have standing to
sue, affirmed the settlement# saying that it8s obvious the
contractors passed on most of their damages# so a million
dollars in plumbing fixtures was plenty for the contractors#
sine® they w©r@ clearly passing on their damages.
QUESTIONS

When would the indirect purchaser not be

able to sue# or not be able —• when would the indirect
purchaser not have the opportunity to offer his proof?
MRffl PREEMANs

Well# I would draw the line at Hanover

and in the electrical equipment cases # where you have — or
Lucy Webb Hospitals# Judge Gessii's opinion — where you have
something happening to someone who produces another product#
that is# the manufacturer of a product may be paying excessive
rent# may be paying excessive interest on a loan# may be
purchasing something which goes into the manufacturing process#
and then the product which he produces is something completely
different from what he has# himself# purchased.
I would distinguish -chat situation from the purchase
and resale of a discreet item which moved through the hands of
wholesalers# retailers# and other middlemen.
QUESTIONs And then you would at least always offer
the opportunity to prove damages# and also you would also
offer the defendant the chance to prove the pass-on defense
if he is sued by the direct purchaser?
MR. FREEMAN:

In a situation where it's simply a

37
purchase and resale of the same itern.
QUESTION:

Yes, you would always give him the

opportunity -to prove it?
MR. FREEMAN:

Yes„

And it’s been don@0

Damages

have been apportioned as between direct and indirect purchasers
in a number of cases» The drug cases are an example»
buy ampicillixx or fcefcracyclin because they*re sick.

People
The

manufacturer sets the price# the retailer puts a percentage
markup cn that price# end the consumer pays not only the over­
charge fixed by the manufacturer but the percentage markup.
And in those cases# people at different levels have
sued, and an attempt has been mad® to determine who was
actually injured.
Itss not end it hasn’t proved a difficult exercise.
And in most instances, in answer to Justi.ce Stevens’ question#
the contractor turns out usually not to have absorbed any
overcharge.

He’s in court and he can try to establish it# but

in Arxnco Steel in the Eighth Circuit it was held that the
contractor# under those circumstances of competitive bid#
clearly passed on all of th® damages.
We have cited —
QUESTION:

You mean if you have a complete pass-on,

either by raising ‘the price or by adding a percentage# costplus# you know, a percentage for labor and overhead and profit
and fch© like# is it your view ‘that the ultimata purchaser has

38
the right to recover damages including the percentage of
markup or the labor percentage added onto the cost of tile
block item?
MR. FREEMAN:

To that extent — to the amount of

the overcharge, the percentage added to the amount of over­
charge, yes. To the extent he can prove it.
QUESTION

%

So, in other words, if it is a fixed

practice of always adding 15 percent to cover labor overhead
and the like, the damages then that your client would recover
would not be just, the amount the defendants marked up the
price, but 'that amount pitas 15 percent?
MR» FREEMANS
QUESTIONS

Yes.

Yes.

MR. FREEMAN:

For instance, turning to the

defendants5 example of a brick that cost — that the contractor
pays a dollar for, let’s «assume that the brick cost 50 cents
and -the conspiracy raised the price from 50 cents to a dollar,
we would contend we’re entitled -to the 50 cents of overcharge
imposed by the manufacturer plus the percentage markup on that
50 cents teat the contractor would put on teat amount.
As a matter

fact, this case was tried in the Fifth
[sic]
'Circuit, in Southern General Industries vs. Mauls. The
e£

plaintiffs alleged price-fixing of concrete block, and they
prevailed, and subsequent to the jury verdict in the plaintiff's
favor, the defendants sought to dismiss the action because the

39

plaintiffs were indirect purchasers, and the district court
refused, and the Fifth Circuit refused to hear the case»
It's been proved, it's easy to prove, it's easier to
prove than a violation and easier to prove than damages
flowing from the violation, the pass-on issue itself»
In response to the argument that there is an inherent
incapability of proving the pass-on, we've cited to the trial
transcripts in the Master Key antitrust litigation where the
same argument was made, and the trial testimony in that case
clearly shows, from the defendant's own witnesses, tee
defendant's own contractor, they used the word "pass-on",
they do it, everyone understand that when a contractor prepares
his bid, he takes his material cost, he adds teem up, he adds
a percentage for overhead and profit. That percentage for
overhead and profit may vary, according to a number of other
factors? but tee only thing that affects the price of the
block is tee cost of the block.
cost of tee block.

He puts a percentage on that

Ha doesn’t do it any other way.

I think that is what the facts would show, and teat
is what we think we are entitled to show to the jury.
QUESTION* What is your response, Mr. Freeman, to
Mr. Hatton's argument that, yes, teat’s true, but if the price
©f tee block gats too high, the masonry contractor may shave
th® psrcentage markup?

Instead of normally marking up ten

percent, because the price went up he’s only going to make it

40

seven pereant.
MR. FREEMANs Well* first of ell, that’s three
answers, at least,.

He doesn't purchase the block until he’s

awarded the contract.

It’S almost an instantaneous thing.

A general contractor gets a firm quotation, he doesn’t purchase
the block until he gets the contract.
Second of all, if there is a conspiracy, as we allege,
it raised the cost of the block to all of the general
contractors who were bidding, all of the manufacturers give
quotations to all general contractors, so all general
contractors are subject to the same cost considerations when
setting their price.
If, in fact, he marks it. up a little bit less, then
h® would ~~ if that would ever happen in the real economic
world, I think his markup and overhead is determined by all
these other competitive factorsj but if the price of brick
should somehow affect his markup, it may happen in ©levator
equipment or something that’s more important to the over-all
building, that amount is still over and above the overcharge
imposed by the manufacturer.
What we’re talking about basically is the overcharge
imposed by the manufacturer.

In that situation, indeed, the

plaintiff may have difficulty proving the full amount of the
damages that flow from the overcharge or from the markup that
the contractor put on, but it still doesn’t disturb the fact

41
that; there is a overcharge placed by the manufacturer which is
carried through completely.
In fact, 1 think in the Western Liquid Asphalt case,
that argument was made that there are a number of — that there
are different markups.

I mean, they could show, as the facts

allege, as the facts were developed in the district court, they
could show that the markups differed as between contractors0
But it doesn’t affect th© price being carried forward.
And I think it's the reason that direct purchasers
don’t sue.

X would distinguish Hanover Shoe on its particular

factual context.

The issue here is not how much, not a price

rise? the issue isn’t, does the plaintiff in response to a
price increase to him raise his price?

Nobody raises the

price of block, you put a markup on the price of block.
In Kfflover_Shoe, we*re talking about shoes, where
you have a situation where hundreds of different factors can
affect the retail price of th© shoes, and therefore, to try
to determine how much Hanover Shoe would have raised the price
of its retail shoes would involve you in an inquiry which isn’t
present in this case.
Tills case is very simple in terms of hew contractors
operate.

That’s the kind of evidence we intend to show, that's

th© kind of evidence that will be shown when we got an
opportunity to conduct discovery and when we do ascertain —
obtain contractor pay-out affidavits, contractor records,

42
distributor records, showing the markup that they put on these
blocks.
QUESTIONt

Mr. Freeman, just on that point of

additional discovery, Mr. Hatton spent a good deal of time
this morning pointing out that you had stipulated, in effect,
that the record was adequate to present the legal issue
squarely.
Do you say the record is adequate or not adequate,
for us to decide the legal issue?
MR. FREEMANs

I think the

question was a legal issue.

record is adequate.

The

The only thing established by the

interrogatories that were filed was the fact that 'die State of
Illinois was an indirect purchaser.

Nothing else was established.

The factual issue here is whether or not the allega­
tions of the complaint, that the State of Illinois was injured
by a pass-on of these overcharges, is true or not true.
was no disco%7©ry on that issue.

There

And, indeed, you would think

that if the defendants, having settled with the contractor,
could have produced some evidence that there was no pass-on,
it can't ba done.

It’s been tried and it can't be don®.

It was tried in Master Kay, it was tried in Western
Lignid Asphalt, and I think the value of all -those cases,
especially Armco Steel, is the fact that they arose on a full
factual record.

Armco Steel, in the Eighth Circuit, was an

appeal from a jury verdict, where all of this was developed

43

And the argument was made that, the plaintiffs can’t recover
because they were too remote.

And the Court; of Appeals said,

But -they have, -they can show itj and they did show it*
I think it would be a mistake to decide a legal
question as posed in this case on speculation regarding what
the facts will show, and I think that’s what the Seventh
Circuit was saying, that the plaintiff should b@ given the
opportunity to demonstrate what the facts will show? and if
they don’t demonstrate it, they lose.
QUESTIONs

I think, though, Mr. Freeman, the Seventh

Circuit’s theory was different from yours. As I read the
opinion, they assumed that both; the direct purchaser and the
consumer, the ultimate or indirect purchaser could recover
and there would b® some kind of allocation.
I think your view is that either on© or the other
group recovers.
MR. FREEMAN:

No, no.

What I’m saying is, depending

on the facts, they may both have a chance to recover.
QUESTION: Well, but if the facts are as. you allege,
that there is a clear pass»on right down the line, then only
your clients could recover, end -the direct purchasers could
not.
Which I think is not really the way the Seventh
Circuit analyzed the case.
MR. FREEMAN: Well, the Seventh Circuit analyzed it,

44
I believe, more in terms of target: area., more in -terms of
foreseeable injury, toward concepts of proximat© cost, who
was in the zone of interest,,

Clearly, the State of Illinois

was in the zone of interest*
My response to your question goes more to th© factual
proof at trial* There will b© situations

the Master Key

antitrust litigation is a clear situation where th© evidence
showed complete pass-on*
In other cases, the Gypsum Wallboard antitrust litiga­
tion in the Ninth Circuit, there was an allocation among the
purchasers at different levels*

The evidence may show an

allocation between — tee evidence may show that direct
purchasers suffer some damage*
QUESTION; But your view of the facts, as I understand
it, is this is a complete pass-on case*
MR. FREEMAN:

My view of the facts is that in the

construction field, where the general contract

• is awarded

after the general contractor has secured firm commitments for
the price at which he!s going to buy, it's a clear pass-on
case, and we will be able to prove that*
QUESTIONS And therefore there's no problem of double
recovery, because the direct purchasers simply couldn't
recover*

They could also prove the pass-on*
MR. FREEMAN:

double recovery hers*

Exactly. There would be no problem of
Thera wouldn't, be any — I think the

45
only instance in which a problem of double recovery might arise
is if you try to dream up a situation in which a direct
purchaser sues in one jurisdiction/ and an indirect purchaser
sues many years later in a far distant jurisdiction, and some­
how or other the cases aren91 consolidated or aren’t put
together as cases —
QUESTIONS

Well, what about the case of a partial

pass-on, where it might be proved that a portion of the markup
had been passed on, but a portion had been absorbed by the
direct purchaser?

How would you resolve that case?

MR. FREEMANS

That's an apportionment case»

You

mean only one person is suing at on© time?
QUESTIONS

Well, yes, either they could both be suing

or one could be suing and the defense is raised, the pass-on,
and it*s a partial pass-on.

They didn’t pass it all on, but

they mitigate damages rather than —
MR. FREEMAN:

Well then, I think it's a question of

division as between'.the plaintiffs. There should not be a
double recovery*

The end user is going to get a portion of

those damages, and the direct purchaser will get a portion of
those damages „
QUESTIONS So then in your view Hanover -Shoe would be
limited to the situation where nothing has been passed on?
MR. FREEMANs
QUESTION:

Well, where it would b© two —

Or is it just too difficult to prove?

46

MR. FREEMAN:

Too difficult: to prove.

I mean,

it is like the target area cases* where you/ re trying to draw
the lin© somewhere between where you are going to allow someone
to have standing under Section 4, and in Hanover Shoe it is
so clear* seemingly* that you draw the line there. The same
way with Hie electrical equipment cases.
QUESTION:

Mr. Freeman* why do you concede that

there should be no double recovery?
If there is some spillover* why shouldn’t it fall
on the wrongdoer?
MR. FREEMAN:

Well* perhaps I shouldn’t have made

til at concession.
The law is clear that in many instances the wrongdoer
is liable for much more than his own overcharge.
QUESTION:

You’re certainly getting triple damages

to begin with* —
MR. FREEMAN:

Weil* you’re getting treble damages to

begin with* he’s also liable for co-conspirators.
QUESTION:

Let me ask another question.

Armco was

decided before Hanover Shoe.
MR. FREEMANs
QUESTION:

Yes.
Is chronology important here?

Do you

think Armco would have gone the same way had Hanover Shoe been
on til© books?
MR. FREEMAN:

Well* yes* because* not only was Armco

47
decided, but Stupp Brothers vs» State o£ Missouri, Stafca _of
Washington vsa Anterican Pipe.» and then, subsequent to Hanover,
this Court itself in Perkins and in Standard Oil vs. State of
Hawaii, made no distinction between indirect, and direct
purchaserso

In Perkins —-

QUESTIONs This has to be your position, I take it®
MR» FREEMAN: Well, and then, subsequent to Hanover,
you have four Circuits following, in essence, the decision in
Armco, and saying that Hanover could not have meant to change
this substantial body of law when no mention was made of it
in Hanover.

All those cases were on the books, -there were

only two or three years — decided two or three years prior
to Hanover, and no mention was mad© of them»

X believe it’s

clear that when the Court decided Hanover, it was not giving
any thought to those kind of cases»
And I think that the law, as it was developing prior
to Hanover, mad© the same distinction» When the State of
Washington bought electric generators through a contractor for
insulation in a dam, the State of Washington was held to have
standing to sue®
The same judge, Judge Boldfc, said that the —* in the
other context, said that the indirect purchasers of electricity,
•the consumers of electricity were too remote»

So, therefore,

the distinction was made there, the line was drawn between the
product which is purchased and resold and the product which is

48
simply purchased by a manufacturer, goes into the manufacturing
process, therefore its direct cost in relation to the
individual consumer's product can't be measured»
QUESTIONs

Mr» Freeman, what if in this case a

masonry contractor suing Illinois Brick Company, instead of
settling, had gone to trial and Illinois Brick had offered in
evidence as mitigating the damages suffered by the masonry
contractor the fact 'that he had completely passed on to the
general and to the ultimate purchaser the raised pries?
Should Judge Kirkland have allowed that evidence in, tinder
Hanover Shoe?
MR» FREEMAN;

Yes»

Yes.

That’s what the defendants should have done, if they
were worried about multiple recovery.

All parties were before

the court, it could have been resolved in one proceeding? by
making a settlement with one person, they admit that they do
not at all diminish the claim of the State of Illinois»
Yes, and I think there are two or three other cases
that have so held, have so given the defendant the opportunity
to present a passing-on defense to suit, where the case cams
within an exception to Hanover Shoe.
So I don't think there's any double standard or
unfairness to the defendants in that situation.
I’d like to say one word in closing about this•
spectre of burden on the judiciary, multiple recoveries

49

has been raised as a reason to deprive plaintiffs of the right
to sue. The multiple recovery situation hasn’t occurred, and
it’s very hard to imagine any situation in which it will ever
occur.
The burden on the judiciary would be the same whether
direct purchasers or indirect purchasers sue.

It's simply a

question, we believe, of a rule of law which allows the party
who was hurt, fee party who was actually hurt, the party who
has fee incentive to sue, fch© incentive to enforce the anti­
trust laws, who has the burden to the taxpayers to recover
illegal overcharges for those taxpayers when the money is
spent for public buildings, public construction and other
public purposes.
And it* s his right to assert, and we contend that
the State of Illinois, as the protector of that public interest,
should have its day in court.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Very well,

Mr. Freeman.

Mr. Baker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD I. BAKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. BAKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I am Donald Baker, Assistant Attorney General for
Antitrust

50
I am here because an effective damage remedy is
important to our national enforcement program as a deterrent
to price»fixing.

And because, also, the United States is a

major indirect purchaser of goods.
I have two points to make.
First, the offensive use of passing-on here is
entirely consistent with Hanover Shoe and with sound antitrust
policies.
Secondly, most of the multiple recovery feared by the
defendants can. be avoided by sound judicial administration.
I want to start by looking broadly at Hanover Shoe,
^

in terms of the needs for effective an id trust enforcement.
My starting point is that the treble»damage remedy
against price-fixers serves two distinct but related purposes.
The first purpose is to deprive the wrongdoer of the
fruits of his wrong, and to do it on such a scale as to deter
others from following such a course.
emphasises this point.

The unique trebling feature

It is a bounty designed to encourage

private parties to right public wrongs.
The second purpose of the treble-damage remedy is to
),

compensate the victims of a price fix for their injury.

The

analog^'' her© to tort law is clear and obvious.
If you keep these two purposes distinctly in mind, it
is easy to see why Hanover Shoe is different from the case at
bar.

Hanover involved defensive us© o‘f the pas sing-on defense.

5.1
The defendants simply argued that the plaintiff
shoe manufacturer had not been truly injured because it had
pushed on the overcharge on shoe machinery to the ultimate
buyers of shoes.

The court responded, quite rightly, that

the first purchaser, the shoe manufacturer, had been wronged
in the sensa of being overcharged and that the defendant could
not fo© allowed to defeat tills claim by raising highly
speculative chains of causation on behalf of the massive
purchasers who were not before the court»
The court 'was saying, at least in part, that the
defendant should be deprived of the fruits of his wrongdoing»
And that the plaintiff, having been wronged, was entitled to
recovery»
I note with interest Hanover*s discussion of the
1318 Dagn.all~Taan.5er Lumber case, where the Court quoted this
language, in footnote 8 on page 491:

The carrier ought not to

be allowed to retain his profit, and the only one who can take
it from him is the on© who stood any relationship to him»
If tills Court had not don® what it did in Hanover,
the value of the treble-damage remedy would have been sub­
stantially reduced as a deterrent against price-fixing and
similar crimes«

Undoubtedly

guilty defendants would have

been able to escape substantial liability on the basis of
hard to defeat' claims that somebody else must have been injured»
This logic, the logic of Hanover Shoe, does not

52
control the type of offensive passing-on that w© hav© in the
case at bar®

Here the first purchaser is not alone before the

Court, claiming injuries, but the State of Illinois is here
claiming direct and proximate injury flowing from the price fix®
Hanover does not hold that the first purchaser
recovers and pockets the whole overcharge, even where there are
subsequent purchasers who can shew -that all or part of th®
overcharge was passed on to them and they suffered proximate
injury®
We* re talking here about the second purpose of the
treble-damage remedy, th© purpose of compensating the victim
for his injury.

This is where th© tort analogy stands up.

Stated another way , Hanover secures the general —
QUESTION: Do you think Hanover holds that the first
purchaser may always recover the entire overcharge?
MR. BAKER:

No, to the contrary, I think that if --

that Hanover holds, if th© first purchaser is the only person
before the court, as with the analogy in Darn©11- Taenz&r, he
can recover the whole overcharge.

If, on th© other hand,

there is —
QUESTION:

You mean he won’t b© — and the defendant

can’t be heard to say that —
MR. BAKER:

That's correct.

QUESTION; So you disagree with Mr. Freeman?
ME. BAKER:

I respectfully do.

53
QUESTIONS
MR* BAKERs

Yes.
I think that what happens in the Hanover

— the way Hanover Shoe should work, is that, if you have a
multiplicity of claims corning out of a single chain, than you
consolidate the cases — and I am prepared to discuss how you
can do that ~
QUESTXONs
MR. BAKERs
QUESTION:

Yes, but —
— and that the defendant —
—• but if only the direct purchaser is

there, he recovers it all?
MR. BAKER;

He recovers it ail.

QUESTIONs And you will not listen to a pass-on
defense?
MR. BAKER;

If there are no other claims pending.

This is the reverse of Mr. Justice Stewart*s.
QUESTION;

But Mr. Freeman suggests that, in this

very situation here, the single plaintiff, if he5s a direct
purchaser, would have to meet a pass~on defense.
MR. BAKERS Well, I disagree with that.
QUESTION;
MR. BAKER;

Yes.
I think it's very important, from the

standpoint of antitrust enforcement, Mr. Justice White, that we
not have the fruits of the wrong, the treble-damage remedy for
that cut back by these other claims .
QUESTION;

Well, what if the direct purchaser’s case

54

is going to trial before the statute of limitations has run
on perhaps your ultimata purchaser's case, how do you handle
that?
MR. BAKERi where the first purchaser’s ease is going
to trial before the —»?
QUESTION;

In other words, you don’t know y@fc, and

the trial judge doesn't know at this stage, whether ultimate
purchasers may later come in.
MR. BAKER;

I think, Mr. Justice Relinquish, that that:

is, in fact, a situation that is not likely to occur very
often.
QUESTION; Well, when — in the rare cases when it
does occur, what do you do with it?
MR. BAKER: Well, in the rare case when it does
occur, and the first purchaser's suit goes forward to judgment,
there are no other cases yet filed, and a recovery judgment is
entered, I am prepared to argus that the defendant, if h®
reasonably fears other claims coming in, could at least us©
statutory interpleader and treat that judgment as a fund.
If the ultimate — there are a variety of other
devices.

If the subsequent purchaser is who he fears are not

in the same — are in the same district, he may be able to
bring them in ass an involuntary party under Rule 19«
I think the more real situation, which is really the
second part of my argument, the mor© real situation is where

55
you have oases that are filed by subsequent purchasers in
different districts or in different, separate actions0
Now, -the reason I say I think it's a r&r© case# Mr*
Justice Rehnquisfc, is that the indirect purchaser has no
incentive to lay back, particularly if he thinks he's going to
lose out in any way.

Our experience is that when, the government

files one of these cases# everybody who thinks he's got a right
comes charging in.
QUESTIONi

Well, a lot of private antitrust

litigation arises out of situations where the government
hasn't first obtained a nolo or consent decree, doesn’t it?
)

MR. BAKER:

A lot of private litigation does, but

nearly all the price*»fixing litigation tends to fallow
government cases, I believe.
But I may be wrong on that, because I may be more
conscious of the follow-on from government cases, because I
see it from a peculiar perspective.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Baker, you referred to something in

the nature of a fund, following up on Justice Rehnquist’s
hypothetical.
^

Is it your view that the amount that the

direct purchaser can recover would be the maximum amount of
the total recovery for everyone injured, or do you go along
with Mr. Freeman's view of the percentage markup?
MRo BAKER:
markup

No, I agree with Mr. Freeman on his

56

QUESTIONi

But then your fund would b© inadequate

by definition# then?
MR. BAKERs

>

The fund — the situation in this #

I m©an the fund would be pretty close »

And what we have here#

I mean# is you’ve got four kinds of situations# Mr. Justice
Stevenso
One situation is where direct and indirect
purchasers file in the same court# and you can consolidate
under Rule 42 *
When the direct and indirect purchasers file in
different districts# and then I believe that you can use the
1404# 1407 procedure# first of all consolidate for pre-trial#
and then the assigned judge can rule on the 1404 motion,,
The third situation is where people haven't filed#
and they’re in the same district# which would be true in this
case? and I think you can bring them in under Rule 19„
QUESTION:

And there you say the defendant should

go out- and say# "Please sue me" to those who haven’t sued him
yet*
MR. BAKER;
QUESTION:

Well# —
It’s sort of like yesterday# we had a

cas© where the defendant was going to go around and ask to be
indicted»

It’s the same kind of situation# I suppose.
[Laughter. 1
MRo BAKER: Well# I realize that this is a somewhat

57

unusual situation* but the defendant who is screaming to the
rooftops that he’s going to he rendered a hapless victim of
huge and multiple* you know* recovery * has some incentive to
go chase people up* and I just — I keep on coming back to
you* that that is the rare case* when people haven't filed?
and what concerns m© is that wa*r@ going to ~ we might allow
the rare case* which is indeed hard for the judicial process*
to —
QUESTION:

Why is it Mr, Freeman’s rule is more

workable* that you do it. on kind of a situation-by“situation
basis * and you only hav© one recovery or perhaps a shared
recovery if there is a partial pass-on.

Why do you have to

run the risk of the double recovery* that you seem to be
finding

acceptable?
You do* in your view* as I understand it* there

would be

cases where- you could have a total recovery by one

level of distribution and if there was someone that wasn’t
known or something like that* you could prove that he had
also been damaged* they could recover* even though it’s the
r.&m© amount*
MR. BAKER: The reason -QUESTION: But Mr• Freeman’s view would say it
depends on the fact* you know* what kind of an industry is it*
cost-plus or a capital item* and they are on© or the other
level of distribution to recover, but not all of them.

58

tod his theory, I guess, is that those with the
greatest incentive to sue, you can rely on, will probably sue»
MR» BAKER;

That’s right.

In his view, and I agree

with that, his view is that if the secondary level is in fact
the one that is feeling it, the State of Illinois, they are
the ones that are most likely to sue. And from the standpoint
of antitrust enforcement, it is important that they sue,
because a truly injured plaintiff is much more likely to press
his claims hard than a windfall plaintiff.
But the only point I was making, and it really was
following on from your earlier set of questions, was the
possibility that soma of it was passed on and soma of it
wasn’t, tod that there is some possibility of double — son®
double recovery»

But, as Mr. Justice Blackmun said, th©

—- surely that is not intolerable, per se, if it isn’t a
major problem, a little slopover on the shoulders of th©
wrongdoers, you know, is acceptable»
Although we would, as th© judicial system, would
try to ©void it.
*

QUESTION5

You don’t think treble*-damage is enough?

MR. BAKERs

Treble-damage is a very strong remedy,

Mr» Chief Justice, but the point that the defendants are
arguing hare is the possibility that some double recovery in
some unusual case means ‘that we ought to cast out of court
people who would b© normally compensated under any theory of

59

tort liability, And that was why I was — the only purpose
X was spooking to this rare case for,
I just, you know, I just want to come back to the
point that, to me, the issue here, as in tort, is one of
proximata causa, and I agree that that can be a difficult
situation in certain cases, it isn't a difficult situation in
this case, and this Court need not use this occasion to try
to draw that perfect line of how far out is too remote,
And I do think that it's terribly important that
in fact w© have opportunity for these truly injured public
bodies to coma in and prove the ., wrong that’s been done to
them,
*

Because, otherwise, we lose it in a number of ways.
First of all# .as public governments, we lose the value to the
taxpayers? and secondly, w® lose, as I was saying to Mr,
Justice Stevens, the full value of having the most injured,
the most

the plaintiff with the strongest incentive to sus,

to com© into the situation,
X don't think .1 have any further comment,
QUESTION;

Mr, Baker, may I just ask you a question?

MR„ BAKER s S are,
^

QUESTION;

You have argued that tie likelihood of

public recovery is very slight, double recovery, your
principal argument on behalf of the government is based on
policy.

You do not suggest there are policy considerations

60

that favor double recovery* do you?
MR. BAKER:

Of course not.

What I

- my point on

double recovery was simply that I did not feel that an
incidental risk ©f double recovery in an unusual case was a
reason to deprive an important wronged body of purchasers
a legal remedy. And it was nothing more than that.
And the thrust of my argument and the thrust of our
brief is* in fact* as I said* that there are sound judicial
devices available to assure that double recovery is not
likely to occur on a big scale.
QUESTION;

Mr. Baker* let me just be sure I heive --

I have one more thought in mind. Would you agree with Mr.
Freeman that if this is a case in which the plaintiffs -~*
assuming everybody is before the court* both direct and
indirect purchasers* so we don: fc have the problem of not
knowing whether someone will sue — would you agree that on
the facts of this case* the direct purchaser defendants should
be permitted to offer pass-on evidence in mitigation of
damages?
MR. BAKER:
QUESTION;
MR. BAKER:

Yes* —
If they were direct purchasers —
— in defending against the first

purchaser* in a case like this* «•QUESTION;
MR. BAKER:

Yes.
»» yes* they should.

And* in essence*

what you're likely to have in a pass-on situation is a damage
theory for the first purchaser, a damage theory based on
overcharge not on lost profits and so forth, and in that
circumstance the defendant could show that part of it was
passed on®
But what is important to me, from the standpoint of
antitrust enforcement of Hanover, is this?

that somebody —

that total overcharge be recovered and that — so it's
perfectly fin© to allow pass-on defans© to sort of allocate
as between victims, but not to allow it as a way of thwarting
the over-all processi
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr® Hatton?
MR. HATTON:

I have concluded I have no rebuttal,

Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
