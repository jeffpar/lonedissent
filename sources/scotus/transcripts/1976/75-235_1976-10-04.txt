MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Tha Court will hear

arguments first this morning in No. 75-235, G. M. Leasing
Corp., against the United States.
Mr. Leedy, you may proceed whenever you sure ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LEEDY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR.' LEEDY:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas© the

1 am Richard Leedy, from Salt Lak® City, Utah.

This case before the Court involves 'the Internal
Revenue Service seizure of assets pursuant to a jeopardy
assessment.

The question upon which this Court has granted

certiorari was whether or not such seizures violated the
fourth amendment to the Federal Constitution.
-

The petitioner in this case, G. M. Leasing Corporation

had all of its assets seized pursuant to such jeopardy tasc
assessment, and as a result it dealt the death knell to the
corporation.

Those assets consisted of several luxury

automobiles, including four Stutz automobiles, two Rolls-Royces,
and a Jaguar.

Additionally a bank account was seized from

G. M. Leasing Corporation, together with ail of its books and
records.
The petitioner was a family-owned corporation and
was a new or start-up corporation that was incorporated for
the purpose.of leasing luxury automobiles„

At the time of tha

4
seizure, petitioner had not yet. engaged in the business of
leasing»

However, it had taken many prerequisite steps in

order so to do„
QUESTION:

Is there a considerable demand for Stutzes

out in Sain lake?
MR. LEEDY;

No, your Honor, I don't believe so.

They

cost approximately $40,000 apiece.
QUESTION;

But. the contemplation was nonetheless

MR. LEEDY;

Yes.

I think it was going to be world­

In fact, two of the Stutzes were seized

from Los Angeles, California.

But. your Honor is correct* they had not

yet leased any cars»
QUESTION;

And had they any employees?

MR. L3EDY t
QUESTION;

Th© record shows they had no employees.
How recently had the company been

incorporated ?
MR, LEEDY;

My recollection* your Honor* and I'm not

positive, but I think it was within th© year.
There is no

question that th© petitioner, G. M.

Leasing Corporation* was a family corporation and primarily
controlled by an individual by the name of Georg© I» Norman, Jr.

Mr. Norman was a businessman in Salt Lake City, Utah* and he
had substantial income and substantial wealth.
Throughout th® briefs in this case Mr. Norman is
referred to as the taxpayer* and a taxpayer he was.

In 1970*

one of the years under consideration in this case* he paid
estimated taxes of $290*000.

Because of his income arid

high expenses* Mr. Norman was in a state of constantly under­
going IRS audits.

In fact* h© had undergone an audit from the

years 1963 through 1968* and the IRS auditor was on®
particular agent by the name of Phil Clayton.

Tfo@ evidence

at th® trial showed that an animosity had developed between
Mr, Norman and Mr. Clayton.
QUESTION s

Is .Mr. Norman a fugitive now?

MR, LEEDYs

Yes# your Honor,
Does this bring into play possibly th©
Do you know the Wo 1 inaro case?
I am not certain of that doctrin®# your

Honor,
Mr, Clayton was the IRS auditor who prepared the
assessments in th© instant casts,
In March of 173# th® taxpayer# George 1« Norman# Jr,
became a fugitive from justice.

Several years prior to

becoming a fugitive# he was convicted of th© Federal crime of
aiding and abetting th© willful misapplication of bank funds.
He was sentenced to too years in prison# and through 'th©
course of several years he had app®al©d his conviction.

In

March of '73 his appeals were exhausted and he was required
to surrender himself to begin serving his prison term.
H® did surrender himself to th© marshals in Denver#
Colorado# and after surrendering himself he asked for permission
to make a telephone call.

The marshal released him to go down

th© hall to a pay phone# and he never returned.
He left his family and his home — and incidentally#
he left his assets behind him.

Mr. Phil Clayton, th© evidence

shows# had been working on Mr. Norman's 570 and '71 taxes since
October prior to his fugitive, status in March.

Several w&aks

after lit. Norman became a fugitive# Mr. Clayton prepared a
statutory notice of deficiency for Mr. Norman’s 1970 and s7i

7
taxes.

He then recommended that this assessment be a jeopardy

assessment,, and he finally recommended that the petitioner?
G. M. Leasing Corporation? be considered the alter ©go?
nominee? or transferee of George I* Norman»
In accordance with those recommendations the IRS
issued a jeopardy assessment and made demand upon Mrs» Norman?
the taxpayerEs wife? for the payment of approximately
$1 million in taxes? penalties? and interest.
Mrs. Norman, who is not accustomed to her husband's
business but was merely a housewife, suggested that the IRS
agents see her husband's attorney.

Rather than so doing? the

IRS agents8 next step was to start seising assets.

Lake

Their first

City? Utah? which is

known throughout the briefs in th® trial as th® "Cottage."
Hi® Cottage was the office of petitioner,; it was also the
office of Georg® I Norman? and it was also th© residence of
George Norman's son? the inbervenor in this action.
QUESTION?

Mr. Leady? you are referring to -Mr. Norman

and petitioner as if they were two separate entities.

Do you

take issue with th® Tenth Circuit finding that on® was the
alter @go of the other?
MR. LEEDY:

I certainly do.

I would rather adopt

the trial court's finding that they were not alter ©go or
nominee status.
Interna?.

>*..■ —

;;©rvic® broke th© locks on the

8
building known as the Cottage,, and entered, and began searching.
Upon their entry, on© of their group chiefs realized that it
was a residence as well as an office and, based upon his own
testimony,, he said he was fearful of violating someone's
constitutional rights and therefor© h@ replaced th@ locks and
left th© premises.
Two days la tar -the Internal Revenue Service agents
again foroka into the Cottage, and they seised th® entire
Cottage, including th® real estate

and including ‘th© contents

of the Cottage, which included th© books and records of th©
petitioner.

Th® IRS at that time also seized all of the

assets of th© petitioner, which consisted of th® luxury
automobiles as wall as the bank account, its books and records.
The petitioner brought suit in th© United States
District Court for the District of Utah for wrongful Jilvv
pursuant to statute 26, United States Code, section 7426.'
Th® district court found in petitioner's favor, that it was
not an alter ©go, nominee, or transferee of George I» Norman,
Jr., but. th® Tenth Circuit Court o£ Appeals reversed.
The second aspect of the petitioner's claims in
th@ district court was that th© assessment was arbitrary and
capricious.

Th© petitioner sought an injunction against the

collection of tax and th© seizure of assets.

Ths Court may

wish to note that last term it decided the Shapiro.case, which
I believe had

almost; identical factual connotations as the

9

instant case.

In the instant case the petitioner attempted

to discover the basis underlying the tax assessment; which
was done in Shapiro.

In so doing, w® took the deposition of

the District Director of th© Internal Revenue Service in
Sait Lake City.

In th© Shapiro case rather than by deposition,

th© taxpayer proceeded by way of written interrogatories.
Under advice of Justice Department counsel, th©
District Director refused to answer any,questions concerning
the tax assessments.

Two reasons were given for the refusal.

The first was rather ironic,, because they r ©fused to give us
information about th© tax assessment because w® did not have
tiie taxpayer's consent; yet they had seized all of our assets
to pay for th© taxpayer's taxes.
The second reason for refusing to answer the questions
was the same reason given in Shapiro, that ‘the Anti-Injunction
Act applied and there was no jurisdiction in the district
court to restrain th® collection of taxes.
QUESTION:

In your view, conns©!, who was before

the court in that proceeding if th® taxpayer was a fugitive?

QUESTION:
MR. LEEDY:

will stop bothering you.Do you concede that the documents have been returned

MR. LEEDY;

Yes, your Honor.

MR. LEEDYs
QUESTION:

Y©s.
Were they th© documents of the petitioner

.hare, the corporation, or of Mr» Norman?
MR. LEEDY;

My understanding is every document that

jtfas seised was returned, including those of petitioner.
QUESTION;

And do you think a corporation has the

sain© rights under the fourth amendment as an individual does?
MR. LEEDY:

I believe the previous cases of this

Court held that, your Honor.

My recollection is the Silver-

thorn© Lumber Co. case.
QUESTION:

And you rely on. Siiverthorn®?

MR. LEEDY;

I rely on it for th© proposition that a

corporation has a four til amendment right to privacy.
QUESTION:

And yet the Solicitor General has not

cited it in his brief.
MR. LEEDY:

Maybe we will ask him why.
If it pleas© th© Court, at the trial we

attempted to attack the assessment that had been given because
the Government had counterclams for foreclosure upon the
assets.

We had showed that th© auditor had failed to include

in his computations 'th© fact that 'fch® taxpayer had paid
$290,000, that he had included in the assessment some $115,000
in income that really wasn’t income, and. that through his

IS
prior audits of the taxpayer, he knew that the taxpayer had
high business expenses, but yet he took no steps to find out
what the business expenses were»
Again, th© -trial court ruled in favor of the
petitioner under the theory that there is a presumption of
correctness as to an assessment, but that th© evidence that
we had brought forth had rebutted that presumption of
correctness and that shifted th© burden to the Government to
show if there were any taxes due and owing at all.
The Government’s evidence was in somewhat disarray»
They could not lay a foundation for their exhibit.
didn't have the necessary witnesses to testify.

They

After several

attempts the Government rested.
The trial court ruled in favor of the petitioner,
and the Tenth Circuit again reversed saying that w® had to
show more error than we had to overcome the presumption of
correctness.
The final proposition sought by the petitioner in the
trial court was that the seizure of its books and records and,
the seizure of its assets violated its fourth amendment rights
to th© Federal Constitution.

That is the

question - on which,

this Court granted certiorari.
Again,the trial court ruled in favor of the
petitioner and allowed as how the damages were permissible
but set a hearing date later for the determination of damages.

17
The Tenth Circuit again reversed that, and there was
a finding that the on© agent had acted with malice»

The

Tenth. Circuit indicated that it could find no malic© in the
record , and it held that the taxpayers had acted pursuant to
statute, the levy and distraint statute, and that therefor®
there was no illegal search.
It is petitioner's position that the levy and
distraint statute and the jeopardy assessment statute taken
together which allows the seizure of property immediately upon
assessment without any notice to the. taxpayer and without
any predetermination of probable cause is a violation of the
fourth amendment.
QUESTION?

Is

your claim that even if there had

been no entry into the corporate premises?
MR. LEEDY:

Yes, your Honor, that the s@isu.re of

assets itself is protected by the fourth amendment to the
Federal Constitution.
QUESTION;

You think you need a warrant to seise

those automobiles , for example?
MR. LEEDY%

That is what we ar@ arguing and urging

this Court to adopt.
QUESTION s

Do you have another claim that even if

that is not so, the entry into the premises —
MR. LEEDY:
QUESTION i

Yes, your Honor.
Is that a separate matter?

18

MR. LEEDY:

They are inextricably intertwined, but

I would argue that entry into the Cottage was a search and
that by virtu® of the fact that there war© intelligence agents
of the Internal Revenue Service participating, that by virtue
of the fact that the documents seised were turned over to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, that they were doing mors than
merely levying and collecting taxas, that they w©r© in fact
searching.
QUESTION?

Suppos® they found two cars on the public

street and two cars sitting in a driveway on private property.
Would you mak© the same argument about all those cars?
Mr. LEEDY:
QUESTION;

Y@s, sir, I certainly would.
You don’t think the prior cases of this

Court warrant the seizure of those four ears that I just
described?
MR. LEEDY;

If the Court is referring to the Phillips

v, Commissioner case, no, I don't believe so.

If I may

distinguish that case, that cas© involved not a jeopardy
assessment, but a situation where there had bean a determination
with both sides participating in the determination of fch©
amount of taxes du© and owing, and ~
QUESTION; What do you think Shapiro held?

You

referred to that case.
MR. LEEDY;

I think Shapiro held# to confine it to

the,I guess, precise holding, is that the Anti-Injunction'Act

19
does not apply to such an extent ‘that the taxpayer cannot
challenge 'the basis for the assessment»

tod if in fact there

is no factual basis underlying the assessment;.then he is
entitled to an injunction to prevent the collection of taxes»
QUESTION?

You think Shapiro recognized that there

can be a'-seizure first and a hearing later?
ME* LEEDYs

'That was the precis® factual situation in

Shapiro, yes, your Honor»
QUESTIONi

tod you say the court there shouldn’t have

proceeded on the assumption that the seizure was valid in the
first place without

Yes, your Honor, I believe that»

QUESTION;

Y@s »
What ware the items seized from the house

or office, th© combination, that have not been returned?
MR» LEEDYs

If it pleas® the Court, there war® many

items which were not th© property of petitioner which were
seised and not returned»

-All petitioner’s property had been

returned with the exception of the automobiles.

But there was

furnishings and furniture and other items that belonged to th©
taxpayer that were seized having value, and they have not been
returned»

20
QUESTION:

And when you use the term "taxpayer,” you

are referring fco Mr. Norman, the fugitive,, always, I take it.
MR. LEEDY:
QUESTION:
in this case?

Yes, your Honor.
Mr. Leedy, what remains to be adjudicated

The property has all been returned.

It*s just

a question of damages?
MR. LEEDY:

I believe so, your Honor,

and the

remedy for violation of th® petitioner’s rights,
QUESTION:

If the damages remain to be determined,

»
is the judgment below final?
MR. LEEDY:

Well, th® Tenth Circuit reversed that

judgment, your Honor.
QUESTION:

And scant it back for trial on th.® issue of

damages?
MR. LEEDY:

No, it just reversed it outright and

said that ther© is no liability.
QUESTION:
MR. LEEDY:

No liability.

I see.

If it pleas© the Court, 1 believe,in

determining whether or not a warrant is applicable to a tax
collector’s seizure, one might look at the legislative history
surrounding the adoption of the fourth amendment, which I
think clearly shows that th© tax collector's seizure"of property
was in. the contemplation of the framers of th® fourth amendment,
and most of that legislative history is gone into in my opening
.brief, and. I would, rather than being reptitious, just simply

21

state that 3: believe the legislative history supports the
proposition that a seizure of assets by a tax collector is
within the meaning of the word "seizure" of the fourth amendment»
The second question revolved around is once you
determine that the tax collector’s seizure is within the meaning
of the fourth amendment, the next question is whether or not
a warrant should be required before that seizure, or whether or
not there are exigent

circumstances present which would

dispense with the requirement of the warrant.
It is the petitioner's position that there are no
such exigent circumstances, and it is the Government's position
that there are.

The Government cites for support the fact that

the taxpayer was a fugitive, the fact, that he had not assisted
or cooperated in the preparation of his assessment or tax
returns, and the final reason that certain properties had
disappeared, and therefor© they felt there wer© exigent
circumstances which justified the dispensation of feh© warrant,
I would submit the fact that the taxpayer is a
fugitive has no bearing on whether or not. the collection of
taxes is in jeopardy, because all th© assets were left behind,
that he had no control over those assets, but even more
importantly, he had been a fugitive for approximately two to
three weeks before the issuance of th© jeopardy assessment and
there would certainly be time to obtain a warrant within that
period of time.

22
The second question, of whether or not he cooperated
in the preparation of his taxas, I again don't have any understanding how that bears upon whether the collection is in
jeopardy or not, but I would submit that the record is devoid
of any request on the part of the IRS to obtain his cooperation,
that in fact the agent himself preferred to go to third-party
sources to obtain his information about the taxpayer.
The. final argument, your Honor, pertaining to this
question is the disappearance of property.

If you recall, the

IRS agent entered into the Cottage on one particular day and
then they left shortly after that.

At that time they left men

keeping surveillance on the Cottage, and they observed that
evening certain boxes of material being taken by unknown persons.
A day and a half later they then decided to make the seizures.
I would submit, number one, that they had already
made the determination of jeopardy

prior to that occurrence

so that could not have been a relevant factor, and, number two,
that within the day and a half period they could have certainly
had time to obtain the detached neutral magistrate's decision
as to whether or not the man owed any taxes and whether or not
those taxes were in jeopardy.
The final argument the petitioners us© is the argument
which is often stated in tax cases, and that is that the
Government has a compelling and urgent need to 'collect its
taxes, and therefore there are exigent circumstances which do away

23
with the requirement of obtaining the magistrate's decision.
I would submit, to tins Court -that while I have heard
that statement made in many tax cases, I do not know what is
so urgent and compelling about the collection of this man's
taxes»

And, finally, I believe in this day and ag® of budget

deficits and deficit spendings, that while it may have once
been an urgent need of the Government, it is no longer such an
urgent needy at least no more urgent than the Government’s
need to obtain evidence against criminal suspects»
Therefore, in conclusion, your Honors, we believe
that the entry into the Cottage for the purpose of seizing
books and records was a search»

We believe that the seizure of

assets is also a seizure within the meaning of the fourth
amendment, that therefor® the general requirements of the.
fourth amendment should apply

that a warrant be obtained and

that there were no exigent circumstances in this case which
would dispense with the requirement of a warrant»

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you. Hr» Leedy.

Mr» Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT II» BORK ON BEHALF
OF THE DEFENDANTS
MR» BORK:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

I would like to return, the case somewhat to the issue

before us, which is the validity of these seizures under the

24
fourth amendment.

The propriety of a jeopardy assessment in

this case is not in issue.

Indeed,, at trial Mr. Leedy had a

witness who would testify about the jeopardy assessment
excluded on the grounds that he was not contesting the*
propriety of a jeopardy assessment, but h© was contesting the
amount of it.

So I don't think we need to discuss whether the

jeopardy assessment was in itself proper.
I would like to help focus consideration of the cas©
if I discuss separately the three acts that are complained of:
First# the seizure of seven luxury automobiles registered to
G. M. Leasing; second# the entry upon 'the premises of th©
office bungalow; third, the seizure of th® records along with
the other assets remaining in th© office.
Considerations affecting the legality of these three
acts don© without a warrant vary# so 1 think it is best to
discuss them separately.

What I want to say is background that

I think it's clear from th® record that the IRS had very good,
reason for what it did in this case# as th® facts show.

The

taxpayer# Mr. Norman# had filed a return for 1970 that gave
no information whatever from which his correct tax could be
computed.

Th© check he gave in payment of his 1971 tax was

dishonored by th® bank, and Mr. Norman never filed any return
for that year.

Not. unreasonably# th© Internal Revenue Service

became concerned about the collectiva of Mr. Norman's taxes.
Now, it began to investigate# but th© investigation

25
though formally opened

had not moved ahead until in early

March of 1973 Mr» Norman became a fugitive from justice after
being convicted for the misapplication of bank funds»

That

caused the Service to fear they would never recover any of the
taxes owed by Mr. Norman# and they moved rapidly ahead with
their audit.
Now# our brief states, and I want to correct any
wrong implication if there is one,that they received no
cooperation from Mr. Norman.

It is quite correct that Mr.

Norman was a fugitive from justice and nobody had asked him
prior to that time for cooperation.

After h© became a fugitive

from justice# they went to third-party sources to develop -their

information.
•

j

But tli© Service’s sans© of urgency was no doubt
increased by the fact that, as Agent Applegate testified in
the Appendix at page 85, h© said that there had been in this
case, missing stocks and bonds, shuffling of records, of bank

/
accounts cleaned out, safety deposit boxes cleaned out and
cars stolen.

So they were quit® concerned about

preserving

the assets they could still find.
QUESTION;

Well, now, all of this goes, doesn’t it,

to tee reasonableness and validity of the jeopardy assessment
which I thought you began by saying was not in issue.
MR. BORKs

I think, Fir. Justice Stewart, it goes

somewhat at least to the --

26
QUESTION:

I thought: in this case we proceeded upon

the premise that there was a jeopardy assessment and the validity
of that assessment is not in issue here.
MR. BORK:

That is quite correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I was putting this background in my think because it explains
the reasonableness of some of the actions that the IRS took
in trying to get the property
QUESTION;

Are you saying, then, are you suggesting

there are different gradations of jeopardy assessment?
MR. BORK:

No, no, I am not discussing the jeopardy

assessment, Mr. Justice Stewart.

I am discussing the entries,

and so forth, the background of that.
QUESTIONs

That'3 right.

And we begin then -with

a jeopardy assessment as a given, upon that premise.
MR.. BORK:

Right.

QUESTION:

And you are not going to suggest ’that this

kind of an entry is valid in some kinds of cases where 'there
has been a jeopardy assessment but not in others?
MR, BORK:

I am going to suggest, I think, that the

reasonableness of an entry in certain kinds of cases could
be drawn into question.

If there were an outrageous entry into

a private residence, for example# it might be a different kind
of case.

I am just trying to describe the kind of cas® -this is.

Well, if the jeopardy assessment were

valid, would this be a different kind of case?

Do you think that the Government needed

probable cause to enter these premises?
MR. BORK;

If it needed probable cause, the form of

No.

QUESTION;

Yes.

If they had no idea whether these

MR. BORKs

Yes.

But I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

in a case where it is the taxpayer’s property, there would
almost always be probable cause to think that — this building
was seized as well.

And there would almost always be probable

cause to suppose that there war® assets in an office building.

What, if there were probable cause only

to believe -that there, was evidence

It took them for two reasons;

One reason

was they thought, th© records might themselves contain assets,
such as stock certificates.

The other is.they thought th©

records might indicate th® location of other property of the
taxpayer.

That is not an investigatory reason such as you

would have in a criminal case; that is simply a means of track­
ing down property.

And all

of a seizure of records, \t

that

is at stake in that kind

seems to me# is

& property

31

interest, not a privacy interest.
QUESTION

How did you find out that some of the cars

%

were located down, in Los Angeles?
MR. BORKs
Chief Justice.

From these records?

I do not know the answer to that, Mr.

I do not believe they did find-it from these

records.
QUESTION:

At what stag® did the agents observe

the apparent surreptitious removal of boxes of material of
some kind from the Cottage?
MR. BORKs

They made the first entry into the bungalow

office on the 21st of March.

They backed out whan they saw

a stove and refrigerator, because they thought it might b@ a
private residence.

They then that night saw people carrying

boxes of things out of the building, and in the morning they
discovered that the Stutz automobile, which had been in the
garage and which they had not seized, had disappeared.
later recovered that.

They

It turned out that it had been removed

by tii® younger Norman, .and they later recovered

it.

But I suppose the automobiles in this case are the
most important issue to the Internal Revenue Service because
it3s seising assets of that type every day, and it*s terribly
important to the collection of taxes, and I think it would b©
utterly impracticable, given the dispersion of property

that

taxpayers mostly have, to impost; a warrant requirement on that
kind of seizure.

For one thing, the fourth amendment requires

32

that the places and so forth be described with particularity,
which means that you would have to search for the property
then post a guard and go bach and get a warrant, and you would
have multiple applications in. many cases as they kept locating
new property, which would also thrust the courts, I must say,
into the day-to-day administration of the Internal Revenue
Service.
Now, the cor® value of the fourth amendment 1 take
it to be the protection of privacy.

And it seems to me that

that value is not even implicated in the process of levying
upon automobiles.

The petitioner here makes no point that

there was any entry upon any private premises to seize the
automobiles.

Indeed, they were found on parking lots and public

garages, and I think on© of them was found on the street,
although 1 am not entirely sure.

But there is no privacy

interest.
The only thing that is at stake her® is a seizure
for a property interest, and the United States had a property
interest superior to that of Georg® Norman or his alter ego,
the petitioner her®.

And that is shown, I think, by the fact

that anything that was seized which should ultimately be held
to"have been improperly seised is fully compensable by damages
which an invasion of a privacy interest never is.
And I should note that a full deficiency notice
listing each of the items of deficiency has been served upon

33

the taxpayer

and that Mr. Norman is now in the tax court

through his attorney contesting the amount of the deficiency.
I -think that's sufficient.

I think the automobile

seizure is covered by Murray’s hsssea case we discuss in our
brief, and 1 think it’s sufficient to dispose of that issue in
favor of 'the United States.
There is only a property interest at stake, and I
think the interest of the United States and the flexibility in
collecting it, and efficiency in collecting the amount due it
by

delinquent taxpayers
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, would it have made

any difference if the automobiles bad bean on the private
property of the taxpayer?•
MR. BORK:

Well, Mr. Justice Powell, I think if they

had seized the automobile,

in the garage, j think that would

still have been reasonable „ ipd that ,1 think «brings me to ttu
question of the entry into the office, because they had to
remove — they removed a lock on the garage and were about to
seize the automobile when the younger Borman protested.
they didn't seize it.

So

But had they seized it, I taka it there

would have been less of a privacy interest in the garage entry
than there would have bean,if there was any,in the office
entry.

But I don't think it made any difference.
QUESTION?

Wouldn't Murray's^Lessea _ have covered

a seizure in a driveway on private property?

34
MR. BORKs

I think it would, Mr. Justice White.

QUESTIONS

But not in the garage?

MR. BORKs

I don’t know that I am willing to say it

would not in the garage.

That Is quite a cliff ©rant case.

QUESTIONs

Those weren’t the facts.

MR. BORKs

Nor that is quit© right.

Now, I think I hav© discussed 'the automobiles
sufficiently.

The sheer number of them, the dispersion of them,

the fact that they are easily movable, the fact that they were
in public places, and so forth, I think sufficiently establishes
the reasonableness of that seizure.
I want to talk about the second entry into the office.
It’s helpful to place those events in context.

I think our

brief does so adequately, and I will not go over the facts about
how they discovered that there was such an office, and so
forth,

I have mentioned that, they entered once, saw the stove

and the refrigerator, and backed out.
QUESTION.

Now, at that point —

Mr. Solicitor General, you mentioned

Should w@ not for the purpose of the

Does your argument in this case depend

on assuming that it was not a residence?

I think if it were a residence, it would

be a more difficult cas©.
QUESTION;

I know, but. what are you asking us to

Are you asking us to decide a case of a nonresidence?

or decide a rule that will apply to residences as well?
MR. BORKs

I am asking you to decides a case that

would apply to a nonresidence, Mr. Justice Stevens.

I think

the degree of residence that was involved here, which they
could- not have known, that is, that George Norman III, who was
19, had moved in her® for security purposes, doss not change
tills into a classic residential dwelling.
QUESTION?

If they didn't think it was a residence,

why did not they continue their total search the first time
they entered?

Wasn't it the policy not to

MR. BORKs

That is correct.

search residences?

But they went in and

saw the stove and refrigerator, and out of an abundance of

36
caution want. out.

Then two things happened.

On© was that

they talked to Mr. Ridd, a contractor, who said that he had
worked in there and it was an office.

Th© other was that they

began to see materials taken out at night.
Now, the record, unfortunately, although w® re.far
to an entrance on the 21st, when they backed out, and an
entrance on the 23rd, if you look at th.® Appendix, Mr. Justice
Stevens, it turns out on pages 34, 59, and 77, some people
testified that th® entrance took, place the next day, right
after — on the 22nd right after they saw the property being
removed, but other people testified that, no, it was th® 23rd,
and the record is in a very unsatisfactory state about that
and nobody apparently focused on that issue at th® trial lev©!.
Th<sy went back into the building, but X would place
in addition to the circumstances surrounding this, in
addition to the fact that a property interest is at stake
and not really a privacy interest, I think we ought to point
out that what was don© here follows about 700 years of
Anglo-American legal history., that at least since the 13th
century this kind of thing has been regularly dona.

English

common law is quite clear it was don©, as our brief describes,
in the colonies of the United States,

It is quit® clear

that, the States such as Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and
others which had prohibitions on unreasonable searches and
seizures, after adopting those prohibitions, adopted statutes

37
that; allowed what was done here and much, more than what was
dona her©.
So I think it is quite clear that the fourth
amendment was written against a background of English and
American legal history and of State constitutional law, which,
shows -that it was not intended to apply to entries to seize
property of the taxpayer who was delinquent in order to
satisfy his tax obligations.
QUESTION:

And 1 think -that entrance --

It was adopted; however, against a back­

ground of revulsion against writs of assistance and general
warrants and specifically against the background of the use
of those devices to search to see whether or not a person
owed taxes, isn’t that correct?
MR. BORKs

To search to see whether or not a person

owed taxes, that is quit© correct.
QUESTION:

That was its specific background, wasn’t

MR. BORKs

That is quite correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

But a writ of assistance, a general writ of assistance was an
authority to search almost at random to see whether there was
property in -the houses, and it often had no foundation —
QUESTION:

That is right.

... excise tax should

have been paid, or some similar tax.
MR. BORKs

Wh@r@as this is quit© different.

‘This is

a case in which it has been determined that taxes ar© owing by

38
a specific person and that ther© is reason, to believe he has
property on business premises,
QUESTION:

It has been determined unilaterally.

MR. BGRKs

Well, it has been determined in this case,

for example# after consultation with revenue counsel and all
the agents.

It was quite a thorough investigation here.

QUESTIONS

It hasn't been determined after any

adjudication? it has just been determined unilaterally by
the collector.
MR. BORK:

That, is correct, but that is precisely

vjhat has happened throughout our history from the adoption of
the Constitution on.

The First Congress, which proposed the

adoption of the fourth amendment, along with the rest of the
bill of rights, of course, also passed a statute allowing the
collection of taxes to be levied by distress and sal®, and
that contemplated the procedure that was used her®.

So I

thin! it's clear that the original understanding of the fourth
amendment is that this kind of entry was lawful and does not
require a warrant under the fourth amendment.

I

would not go so far as to make that statement as to a private

QUESTION:

How do you get in th© middle?

QUESTION:

~ you wouldn't distinguish this case of

a jeopardy assessment from any other situation in which th©
Commissioner is entitled to levy and distraint •—
MR. BORK;

No, no, Mr. Justice White.

Th® fact that

it was a jeopardy assessment does not — it could have been
just a plain assessment.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

MR. BORK:

But, also, I think it's useful to

recognize that this is indistinguishable from what, happens
in trie execution of judgments all over the country.

And in

fact in the vary jurisdiction in which this arose, Utah, th®
rule of civil procedure there, 64(b), says that if a sheriff

43
Is executing a judgment, he makes a public demand for property
in a building, and if fch© demand is refused, the statute says
he must cause the building to b® broken open and take .th®
property into his possession, and if necessary, h© may call to
his aid th© power of the county.
QUESTION;

Does that include a private residence?

MR» BORK?

So far as feh® rule appears on its faca,

Mr. Justice Stewart, it does.

I do not know what th© practice

is.
QUESTIONS

Has th® historic practice of which you

have advised us, thisthr@®~ or four- or five-century practice,
included warrantless breaking into private residences to find
property of a taxpayer who has been judged to owe tanas?
MR. BORKs

It certainly does, Mr. Justice Stewart.

QUESTION?

Why has the Internal Revenue Service been

so leary about that?
MR. BORKs

I think they live in this society, as the

rest of us do, and they recognise that there is a privacy
interest in a public horn© which they do not wish to invade.
Now, what they do with a privat® home is they arcs likely to
padlock it, and than negotiate.
QUESTION;

Is do what?

MR. BORKs

They may padlock a home, and then

QUESTION?

In this case, you equate this so-called

MR. BORK:

I dp, indeed.

And X think the evident»

shows that.
QUESTIONS

And surely you are not. submitting to us

that there is no privacy interest of the taxpayer, or of any­
body, in his private business office?
MR. BOSK:

Thor© is much less, I think, Mr. Justice

See v. SgaatfelQ says

Stewart, than there is in his horn®.

specifically that the court does not mean to imply that the
privacy interest in this kind of a governmental regulation
cas© is not less in an office than it is in a private residence
I think practically that is quite true, it is.

Mel, secondly,

the entry her© was not for the purpose of an investigatory
search* it was her© just to s©iz© property, and what6s at
stake really is ~ it has vary little to do with the privacy
interest; it is mainly a property interest that's at stake.
QUESTION;

Wall, I would think that if somebody

broke into my office in this building and looked for property,
•that would also invade a good deal of privacy, wouldn't it?
MR. BORK;

Indeed, it would.

But there is a. much

lower privacy interest, I think, in business premises.
you have on the other side the kinds of factors that
recognised

that 1 don’t expect a 20th century court to be bound absolutely

i

Mr. Justice Stevens, or one sleeps in his office for a week
to - safeguard it, I don't think it attains quite: the height cf
privacy that one has in one's regular residence and dwelling
place.
QUESTION?

Th© finding here was not only, ae my

brother Stevens has pointed out, that it was a residence, but
'it was a residence of someone other than the taxpayer.

It was

equivalent of John Smite’s residence.
MR. BORK:

It was th® taxpayer's president’s residence

in this record.
QUESTION ?

I thought thfj taxpayer was Mr. Norman.

MR. BORKs

I am sorry, the petitioner’s.

QUESTION?

And this was th© residence of tertius, of

Mr. Norman III

—

MR. BORK?

Th® president —

QUESTION?

— who constitutionally was th© equivalent

of just any John Smith.

So they are breaking into a third

person’s residence according to the finding.
QUESTIONs

Is tee young Norman, whose residence this

was, a party here?
MR. BORKs
Mr. Justice Whit©

He was below.

He is no longer in th© case,

47
QUESTIONS

Has the taxpayer any standing to talk

about the invasion of young Mr. Norman53 residence?
MR. BORK;

I wouldn’t think so, Mr. Justice White.

And in addition, it is true that the Court of Appeals set aside
all the findings in this case on the grounds shat the trial
court merely adopted without a change all of the findings
submitted by petitioner below.
QUESTION;

Are you suggesting that w© must talc© the

cas© as though it vzasn't a residence at all, because a corpora»
tion hasn't any standing to claim it is a resid®nc©,- or to
object to an invasion of a residence?
QUESTION;
wasn't it?

Tiie corporation — it was their office,

They clearly had standing to —
QUESTION;

Oh, yes, they have standing on the office,

but have they got standing to object to the entry as an entry
into a house?
MR. BORK;

I never thought of that, Mr. Justice White,

hut I think they probably do not.
QUESTION;

They don't have standing to object to the

breaking into the door to the premises that war© both an office
and a residence, because they weren't the only .resident?
QUESTION:

They have standing to object to it as an

entry into it as a business establishment.
QUESTION;

They don't have standing to make this

argument is what you say.

48

MR. BORKs

That is correct, not as 'to tertius.

QUESTIONS

Doesn’t Justice Jackson's opinion in

Morton Salt say that corporations don’t have the full protection
of the fourtii amendment that individuals do?
MR.BORK:

I think it's quit© 'true, Mr. Justice

Relinquist, that corporations do not.

I think Sea v. Seattle

suggests that business premises do not under the fifth amendment
certainly where ©van if you have got a corporation which can
b@ piorcad for the purpose of attaching liability to a private
individual, nevertheless that corporation has no privilege
under the fifth amendment.

/And for that reason, I think there

is really no occasion after in effect 700 years of history and
almost 200 years under our Constitution to use this case to
overturn practices that are common at every level of government,
state, local, and federal, and not just for tax collection but
also for execution of judgments.
QUESTION:

In that connection, following through on

Justice Relinquish" s question, do yon have any comment about
SiIver •thorn©?
MB. BORK:

I don't think I do, Mr. Justice Blackman,

QUESTION:

So I take it you —

MR. BORK:

It was a, sweeping us© of — I have a

comment, but I don't think it is relevant.

is relevant.

My comment, 1 hope,

It was a sweeping salsura of records from, a

49
Corporation which were then to be used for investigatory

purposes * and that is not true here.

They were merely seizing

documents as assets and as leads to assets.
QUESTION:

To satisfy judgments, the ultimate

To satisfy the ultimate judgment,

QUESTION?

- ' <'

Do you submit that the purpose of seizing

the documents solely as leads to assets would be sufficient to
justify a warrantless entry into the office?
MR. BORK:

Yes* Mr. Justice Stevens* 1 would.,

although there was the additional purpose of —

QUESTION:

I understand.

MR. BORK:

To sei:s© the records wasn't the reason -they

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr. Leedy* do you have any tiling further?

You have

about five minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J» LEEDY
ON BEHALF OF
MR. LEEDY:
time is almost gone.

the Court;

THE

PETITIONERS

As I was going to indicate* I believe ray
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Thar© is one issue I would like to take with the

Solicitor General that appears in the brief and also appears in

30
the argument here, and that is that.

the salzn:m of

the assets is'not a seizure within th© meaning of the fourth
amendment and not entitled to its protection because It), essence
they are seising a property interest and there is 'therefor® no
\

violation of a privacy interest.
I would take issue with that.

As 1 understand th®

right to privacy, th® right to be let alone from government
interference, I think it’s particularly acute when in fact a
premises is entered into, but also when the property is seized
and one is dispossessed of the ownership of th® property, I
think that that’s just as much a violation of th© privacy
interest as it is a property interest.

And I would cite this

Court to its case in Ones 1950 Plymouth Suiiaju v. Pennsylvania,
which is 380 U.S. 693, which is a forfeiture proceeding against
an'automobile wherein this Court held that the fourth amendment
applied when seeking to deprive an owner of the ownership of
his property.

Consequently, I believe it's superficial to say

that all we are doing is dispossessing a person of a property
interest* therefore, no privacy interest is affected and thero-for® the fourth amendment doesn’t apply.

S believe th® privacy

interests ar© affected when a person’s property is taken away
from him.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Leedy, before yon sit down, will you

refresh my recollection on just exactly what the posture of Mr.
Norman III, th® son, is in th® litigation now?

Is h© advancing

51
the arguments that you arc© making?
MR. LEEDS';

-No, your Honor.

brought by the petitioner.

The original case was

Subsequent to the bringing of tha

original case, the IRS seized additional assets from the sou..
Ha then intervened in this action and won in fcho trial court
and the IRS did not appeal the decision as to him.

It returned

the assets to him.
QUESTION;

And h© doesn’t have any pending claim for

damages or anything like that?
MR. LEEDY;

The reason I ask —

I think there would. b®, your Honort

because they returned th© stock to him, but. the value may have
declined.

Yes, I believe there would —
QUESTION;

Is he still a litigant?

Hi® reason I

ask is that are we concerned at all with the status of thas©
premises as a residence,or are we not?

Because a corporation

may only argue the impact on itself of th© entry.
MR. LEEDY;

Th® only person before this Court is

G„ M. Leasing Corporation, the petitioner.

Th© IRS conceded

the correctness of th® trial court's decision with respect to
the son.

That's th© only way I know how to answer.

But

•technically I presume he is entitled to a hearing on damages
in th® trial court.
QUESTION;

But in any ©vent, in this Court we are

only concerned with the status of th® G. M. Leasing Corporation
and its interest in th© premises.

52
MR.LEEDY:

Y@s, sir.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

Th© case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11;03 a.m., the arguments in tb©
above“entitled matter were concluded.}
