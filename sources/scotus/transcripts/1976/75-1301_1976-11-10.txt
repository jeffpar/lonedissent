MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

WeMl hear arguments

first this morning in 75-1301, Delaware Tribal Business
Committee against Weeks, and the related oases.
Mr. Christensen, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAI ARGUMENT OF GEORGE B. CHRISTENSEN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. CHRISTENSEN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
You will recall that this case poses the question of

•rhev&er a -three-” judge federal court may hold unconstitutional
e. dis tributi on. statute passed by Congress distributing an
Indian Claims Commission award, ten percent to two federally

recognized bribes, the balance to the members of the tribe
per capite, th

iding American citizens who have

Delaware blood in thom, but whose ancestors renounced the
tribe and became solely United States citizens some 110 years
ago.
The court enjoined distribution of the fund ’under
the statu! ; to last until either Congress amended the statute
or passed an entirely new one.
Now, the award was based upon a violation by the
856 and 1857 of an 1854 Treaty under which

some, of the land, then occupied by the Delawares in Kansas,

4
were to be sold at public sale with the* proceeds held in trust
by the United States for the benefit of the Delaware people.

to that in the argument, but that it was
for the Delaware people is extremely clear.
As a matter of fact, they were sold at private sale,
and in this case it was found, or the Indian Claims Commission
found the sale produced some thing in. the neighborhood of $1.4
mil ion. less than a public sale would be, and that*s the
foundation of 1L& axrrd which, with interest today, I am
informed, smeruts to something like $13.7 or $13.4 million.
Art -:r the 1354 Treaty and Si© sale of the lands, in
1861, in the rush of white settlers into Kansas, the United
States decided to remove the Delawares into Indian territory,
cr.d it promised to take, to sell their lands and then take the
pro v r-. dr., and buy them & place to live in Indian territory.
Ik Iad to make a deal with the Cherokees to get them in there,
hr cause, at that time, the United States was crowding more
Indians into a- e Indian territory and giving away or letting
■

land.

But chat Treaty —- and this is crucial to this case
- ■ of 1866 by which the Delawares were compelled, to move into
Indian territory, contained an important exception.
was s

And that

If a. Delaware could prove that he had adopted civilised

ways, that he had supported himself for five years, he was
given the option of renouncing the tribe and becoming

5
solely an American citizen. And under those circumstances he
could stay in Kansas on land that already had been allotted fco
him or the equivalent of it.
Sorte 21 adults chose to exercise that option in
186”, they with their children remained there and in a few
years their children also became American citizens»
Now, that process was one of renunciation of the
tribe completely.

Tribal affiliation, all interest in tribal

funds, except they got a pro rata share as it then existed.
And so they have been American citizens ever since.
•vt tlivt him® the Delaware tribe was actually in two
;n Ti:a..,.

The medr group was in Kansas.

There was a smaller

group th&t had wandered off down amongst the southern Indians
that were -jxpouted to rejoin the main tribe, but they never
did- and they ax*® located in western Oklahoma.
So you have today -two federally recognized tribes
before you:

the Delaware Tribe' of Indians, which I have the

honor to represent; and the Absentee Tribe of Western Oklahoi
QUESTION:

And where are your clients located?

HR. CHRISTENSEN:
HSCION;

They're located in Oklahoma also.

They*re in Oklahoma, also.

HR. CHRISTENSEN:

Yes.

In an area roughly in the

Bartlesville area, and the others are ---- the Absentee Tribe
is further west.
QUESTION;

Your group is called in the briefs the

6
Cherokee Delawares?
HR. CHRISTENSED;

Correct.

QUESTION: All righto
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

That’s correct.

Now, chat, name Cherokee, Your Honor, it’s a classifi ­
cation used hy the plaintiff Weeks in this case.

She set up

classes and subclasses of Delawares. And she denominated my
people Cherokee Delawares, because they lived with the
Cherokees and they had certain rights as Cherokees.
Hut the undisturbed finding of fact below is that
they constantly had maintained tribal identity during this
long span from 1867 or thereabouts to the time of the trial
of this action.
QUESTION:

May I ask you one more question?

I take

it that your group, or the group you represent, came about
separately after the 1854 Treaty.

Do I have my chronology

right?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

No, not quite, Your Honor.

The

group I represent cams about before Columbus landed here.
They were tine Delaware Tribe of Indians that originally started
out somewhere in New Jersey and, step by step, as you will find
-it traced in the briefs and in the history — there’s a long -QUESTION;

No, I know that, even the Last of the

Mohicans tails us this.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Yes.

7
QUESTI Oil j

My question was directed at their going

to Oklahoma and whether it was that, journey that carne after
the 1354 Treaty.
MR. CHRISTENSEN;
QUESTIONs

That’s the one.

MR. CHRISTENSEN:
question.

Yes.

Yes.

I misunderstood your

I beg your pardon.
QUESTION: All right.
QUESTION:

It car© after the 1866 Treaty, didn’t; it?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

They moved, I think, in 1867,

actually.
QUESTION:

Right after the Treaty of 1866.

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

It was after the 1866 Treaty.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Mr. Christensen, you said there were two

groups in 1866,

Was there not a third, the Munseas?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Yes, but they are not party to this

litigation.
QUESTION:

No, but they are relevant whan we’re

trying to figure out what Congress was doing with the distri­
bution of funds, I would think.
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Yes, there were.

The Munseasf as

I understand it., had started with the tribe, they had moved up

8
into New York and then they began to live with the Stock­
breeders .
I was born and. raised in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and
right across Lake Winnebago from me were the Stockbreeders»
Not until I got in -this case did I discover they were really
Delawares *
But the Munsees have been in Canada or Wisconsin
for many, many years; just how long I

can’t tell you, Mr.

J us hi ce S te v® ns.
Now, this brings us to the appellees, the so-called

Kansas Delawares.
tion.

Now, that again is a litigation classifica­

The Kansas D-alav;ares are solely American citizens,

there neves-r her been a group of Indian citizens holding
Indian citizenship known as the Kansas Delawares,

Never in

the past, end not today * This is purely a litigation device.
The ancestors of these people left the tribe in

186C- or 1867, exercising their option so to do, and they are
no more —
QUESTION:

The ancestors are the 2.1 adulte that,

you told us about earlier?

MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.

They are no more Delaware, political Delawares than

I ri \ a political Da

, be canoe my grandfather left Danmark

b they made this raove and came over
■

9

citizenship.
Now., it’s relatively easy in ray case, with an ocean
between us, to decide that I have no political rights as a
Dane. But., of course, her® we have these people of Delaware,
so» Delaware blood, who are living amongst all the rest of
us, and fairly near in some instances the political Delaware
Tribes, one of which I have the honor to represent.
QUESTION:

Did they live together in any recognizable

group?
MR. CHRISTENSEN;

No.

No, they do not.

They live

all over the country.
QUESTION: There’s some 900 of them now?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

And I understand a lot of them

went out into California during the days of the Dust Bowl.
They do not live together as a group. There is no group of
Kansas Delawares•

It is just a classification put together,

as you would put a class of bond holders or of citizens in
an ordinary class action case.
QUESTION: But it is true, is it not, Mr. Christensen,
that their ancestors, the 41 original Kansas Delawares, are
within the group that was wronged by the government’s breach
cf the Treaty?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

Their ancestors were in the group

wh-wia. a wrong was dons to idle tribal property, to the tribal
right.

10

QUESTION: They were a member of the Tribe at that
time?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Yes«

Yes.

You say the Kansas Delawares are kind of

like a classification of American Danes?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:

I bag pardon?

QUESTION: Are you saying that the Kansas Delaware
elavsification. if kind of like a classification of American
Danes?
MR. CHRISTENSEN:
QUESTION:

Correct. Correct.

That's a question from someone with

Swedish ancestry, I might say.
[Laughter. ]
MR. CHRISTENSEN: Well, this brings me ~~ my time is
up, if it please the Court.
Ci stand for this case being nonjusticiable, we
think it’s a better, cleaner way than going into this question
of rationality.

1

Thunk you vary much.
MR. CHIEF .JUSTICE BURGER:

All right, Mr. Chrisbansa.u

Mr. Randolph.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. RANDOLPH:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it plear c

Ii
Suppose this question were askeds

Does

the due

process clause of fee Fifth Amendment bar Congress from
i

dislxib.utir.o- tribal property only to the Tribe and its members?
v?,i think, and we think fee Court will agree, the
question seems to answer itself,

Yet, in our view, that's the

'very question presented by this case.

In fact, the question

may be somewhat similar —• simpler, as I’ll expand upon later;
fee question may well foes

Does the due process clause of fee

l'i£ it Amendment prohibit Congress from giving tribal property
to the Tribe?
I my tribal property, because feat is what we’re
dealing wife :

That's what the more fean $13 million feat

Mr. Christensen referred to, which is now gathering interest
in

he bribed Stries Treasury, represents, it’s tribal property.

No individual certainly has any vested rights in that property,
bib. money ”,‘s appropriated by Congress to satisfy a judgment
of tha Indian Claims Commission.

The money was appropriated

i.v; 1969, feat’s when it became tribal property.
The award of the Indian Claims Commission was to the
Absentee Delaware Tribe ar plaintiffs, and the Cherokee
belaware Triba, or the Delaware Tribe of Indians, which is
their more formal title.
As representatives of fee Delaware Tribe, the
: : 1 re ;er e— reaei-

■ of. fee irfeawar© Tribe, and the laris, re

■;t;» Christaraer pointed orb, it’s not a wrong that was don© to

12
an individual Del as-/arcs or a group of individual Delawares,
The basis for the award was a wrong that was done to the
Delaware Tribe more than 100 years ago, when the United States
breached its Treaty commitment in 1854, and failed to sell
the land, at public auction and sold it instead at private
sale.
So we’re dealing with tribal property.
Now, what, is Congress’s duty when it has tribal
property?

Congress’s duty is to determine what is the best

use cf that tribal property for the Delaware Indians.

It’s

not only its d ivy, it’s its power, its authority, its right.
The 1854 Treaty, in fact, charged Congress with that
responsibility for all money that was generated by the land
srlos.

Now, Congress's judgment, that is- its

Judgment about

how bast thi :■ tribal property should be used, is reflected in
the statute that the district court struck down in this case,
the statute that distributed money to the Absentee Delaware
Tribe and the Chorokee Delaware Tribe.

May I make one clarification?

There

is confusion, I think, perhaps in this discussion and
certainly in the opinion of the Court.

When we talk about

Kahsas D®1awares -QUESTION: Nell, the Indians who are now1 known as
the Kansas Delawares.
MR. RANDOLPH:

The Kansas Delawares are not members

of that Tribe, their ancestors were*

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yea.

QUESTION: What would you like to call them?

That’s

juns that has been given to them for purposes of this
case.
MR. RANDOLPH:

The non™Delaware Indians.

QUESTION: All right, the non™Delaware Indians were
th-sn Delaware Indians and members of the Tribe, is that
Correct?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Ye.s ,

QUESTION: And at that time a wrong had been done to
the Tribe? is that correct?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.

should have gotten»

They had, in affect, a cause of action»

didn't they?
QUESTIONS

Not as

MR. RANDOLPH:

—

No»

Certainly no.

QUESTION: The Tribe did, didn't it?
MR. RANDOLPH: The Tribe had a claim, certainly.
QUESTION: Right. And whan they elected to become
citizens, did they not — war© they not then entitled to a
pro rata share of the tribal assets?
MR. RANDOLPH; They were entitled, to use the precis©
harms of the Treaty, to a pro rata share of the tribal assets
than held in trust in the United States Treasury.
QLAOTIOM:

In the United States Treasury, or held

in trust by tho United States?
MR. RANDOLPH s By the United States.
QUESTION: Well, do you think the claim arising out
of the breach of the Treaty was something the Unitad States
held in trust for these people?
vJR. RANDOLPH:

No.

They held it in trust for the
?

Delaware Tribe, if there was anything that was--held in trust.

MR. RANDOLPH;

By “they” you mean the ancestors of

the people 'that *—
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.
On© naver knows, first of all, I

think that's rather speculative; who knows what would have
happened

in the money was realized,and 1866?

For all we know, the Secretary of -the Interior could have
decided that there was a good project, since the Delaware
Indians had so much money at that -time; in which case they
larad it.

I think that's somewhat speculative.

There is a "but for" relationship, I agree.

But

for the fact of the United States violation, it would appear
that the nncestors of the plaintiffs in this case probably
would hav«

received more money, I agree.
There's another "but for" in this case.
QUESTION; Do you think it's just probably?

Is there

anything to indicate that they would have received less than
br.-ir allocated share of the tribal assets at the time they
severed?

But, let me continue. As I said, Congress's
judgment about how best the tribal assets, which cams into

Because if they could have# they could have

MR, RANDOLPH; Well# 'the question that is — the one

no Delaware Indian Tribe has registered such a complaint.
The complaining partiesas Mr. Christensen pointed out, who
designate themselves the Kansas Del «wares, are not members of

So far

as the complaint appears, they are not members of any Indian
Tribe.

In fact, they are not a tribal entity at all. They

are not an organized group.

fund means that Congress has proparly ~~ improperly decided
how the tribal funds should be best used.
The basis for going further and saying the
Constitution was violated is, we think, all the more difficult
to understand, in.view of the Court's repeated holdings over
the years that Congress's plenary authority to decide what
should be done with tribal property# that the political
branches of tba government are charged with this responsibility,
the?; the Judiciary must defer to their judgment# and that# as
fee Court recently held# in Horton vs. Mancarl# legislation
dealing with Indians is constitutional if it fulfills Congress's
special obligation to the Indians.
phrases

And I stress that last

to the Indians.
In regard to the Kansas Delawares# Congress has no

special obligation to them as Indians# none whatsoever.

And

'that point, I think# is not in dispute.
I think it.fs fair to say that appellees really do nob
•.re'; our arguments on this score# and, as a matter of fact#
they don’t even, cite the Morton vs. Mancari opinion in their
brief.

Whet they invite the Court to do is to follow a

different path# the path that’s marked out by decisions that
do net dec.1 with Indian Tribes or Indians at all.
Their argument is simply this:

that it is absolutely

Irrational# thee: *«? no rational distinction between them and
eec Indian 1 eru.fiair rias of hue distribution statute.

22
Thin: as.©sinn

fchs statute violates due process

and, mors precisely, the equal protection principles that are
mhodied in *&. -> due process clause.
Now. by a rational distinction, I would suppose that
one means a distinction that's not based on the flip of a coin
or on whimsy, but on reasoning.

If that is the test, and I

think it isf then this statute certainly meets that test.
Let ma give the Court the rational basis.

It’s quits

s imp le.
In distributing tribal funds resulting from a 1969
smprcpriafcioa by Congress, the statute simply excludes those
-•“hoee ancestors relinquished any interest in tribal property &

canbury ago.
That's the rational basis.

At least that's one.

b's derived from Article IX of the 1866 Treaty 3
issing a few moments ago. And that says that
s.fi.oc the appellees* ancestors resigned, they were not to

share in tribal property.

Moreover, 'fch© sax® provision,, the

same. Article IX of that same Treaty says that in addition to
80 acres in fer. which these ancestors would get, they are
entitled to & pro rata share of the tribe's funds* then held
in trust by the United States•

rt interpreted this provision to say

that, well, i r, doesn't

‘hiat it appears to mean; what it

23

means is that; the ancestors would b© entitled fco share in a
future award.

And the court said furthers

the reason we

interpret it. that way is because we have to interpret
statutes .in favor of the Indians,
Well, we agree with the last proposition, but we think
an interpretation in favor of the Indians is not in favor of
the Delawares, but in favor of the Tribes that are before the
Court.
I would like to say that the one point that the
Delaware Indians constantly make, and make quite effectively
through cl r.:e brief, is the proposition that Mr. Justice
Stevens alluded to.

It’s simply this;

but for the breach in

n»y ancestor probably would have gotten more money when
he ‘oft the Tribe in 1867,

Whether the individual, or

ZBn:-aB Delawares would have been benefitted, one never knows.
If : y great-grandfather had more money in 1866, I don't know
whether 1 would be batter off today.
but the fact is, the "but for" relationship is the one
point that, the Kansas Delawares press.
If Congress had made a judgment to include them in
tine distribution on the basis of that reasoning, I think
Congress would have acted rationally,

I think that would have

bean within Congress’s discretion.
X also think, and the point I'm making to the Court
is that, it was likewise rational, derived from reasoning, for

24
Congress not. to include them on the basis of another “but for5’
reasoning.

But

for the fact that your ancestors left the

Tribe, you would have . been members of the Delaware Tribe and
entitled to tribal money when it was appropriated in 1969.
QUESTION:

Hr.

Randolph, your argument, of course,

is based on the face of the statute, and you presume a
rational basis for the congressional decision.

Do you disagree

with their analysis: of iis legislative history, that the real
purpose of not including -the catch-all phrase with this second
distribution, th© statute was to include the Munsees rather
than, the Kansas Delawares?
HR*

:

I wouldn’t frame it that way.

Certainly the Munsees were — I would put it in a class.

The

real purpose was to exclude a class of people who would share
in the award because and only because their ancestors were
members of the Tribe in 1854»

That, of course, included the

Munseas.
Bui; the problems that Congress realised, that
spoiled to the Munsees, applies

That's right.

QUESTION;

Absolutely.

Is there nv5.den.es in the legislative.

20

history that Congress was concerned about the problem of
identifying Kansas Delawares as opposed to identifying Munsees?
MR. RANDOLPH:

No, and I think that proves ray point.

They are so difficult to identify, Congress didn’t even know
they existed.
Congress.

And they never mad® themselves known before

They certainly -~
QUESTION: They did share in the earlier award,

Yes.

They shared in the earlier

But there's no indication and no

reference to this

particular group singled out. They shared in the other award
because there was a catch-all.
QUESTION:

So you would say there is no legislative

history indicating a deliberate decision by Congress to
exclude Kansas Delawares?
MR. RANDOLPH:
is precisely that.

No, I think the legislative history

Congress intended to — because Congress

intended to include those and only those it specified.

That

has the effect of excluding the Kansas Delawares, and Congress
so intended.
As v matter of fact, that's the very reason they are
suing in this case,
QUESTION:

And you say the rational basis is that

there was another consideration to that.
MR. RAMI CRB:

Yon.

vJhile I think there is a

29
rational basis — there are a number of rational bases.

One

is the one I just mentioned,, which is that the people that are
excluded are people whose ancestors gave up any right to
tribal property,

lies as simple as -that.

There’s another rational basis.
QUESTION; For a consideration,
MR. RANDOLPH;
QUESTION;

For a consideration.

Assuming one was needed.

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.

There’s no allegation,, I

might add. that the 1866 Treaty has been breached by Congress,,
bocause they didn’t pay a- certain amount to the Kansas
Delawares.

There’s another rational basis, too.
I mentioned earlier in the argument that

the question

hern may be, in fact, whether the due process clause prevents
Congress from distributing tribal property to the Tribe.
This statute- is, in effect- in form, a distribution not to
individuals directly, it’s a distribution between two Tribes.
If one takes a look at the statute, which is set forth ~~ it’s
1294(a), and it’s set forth in a number of places, but since
1 have the: jurisdictional statement out, it's page 96a and 97a
of the jurisdictional statement.
And on© notices 'that the form of the award and the
form :>f the apportionment is to the Absentee Delaware Tribe
of Western Oklahoma, and to the —• and also to the Cherokee
Del«wares, or the Delaware Tribe, as they are referred to.

30
The fact of the matter is that after giving the
money, this is the way the form of the award reads, after
giving the money to the Tribe ? that Congress directed how the
Tribe was to use 90 parcent of that money.? which is? of course?
a normal function of Congress and tha Executive Branch in
regulating the affairs of a ward? which a Tribe technically
is? and still is*
QUESTION: Hell? Mr* Randolph? Congress can conclude
that members of the Tribe are Indians? but if you are not a
member of the Tribe? what makes you an Indian?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Well? that's a very difficult

question? Kr. Justice Marshall.

One can fake the definition,

for example, in the Indian Reorganization Act, which defines
what an Indian is for the purposes of that Act,
Delawares would not fit within it.

The Kansas

You have to be a member of

a recognized Tribe? No. 1? or possess more than one-half Indian
bleed and
you live.

recognized os an Indian in the community in which
I don't think -there's an^ evidence whatsoever that

any of the people representing this class come within that
definition of an Indian.
Thera's common-law definitions in some State cases?
I understand, -chat say an Indian is a person who claims to be
an Indian? who possesses a high degree of Indian blood and
who acts in the customary tribal ways, and so on and so forth.
for our purposes? I think the important question is

31

not whether .in some abstract sense the Kansas Delawares are
Indians# but whether# in a federal context# they ar®.

And

the answer to that, is clearly no# they are not Indians because
Congress owes no special obligation to them# they are not in
any kind of trust status with the United States,

There is no

ward-guard!an reliationship between them.
As a matter of fact# the question came up whether
their counsel's contract for representing them had to be
approved by the Secretary of Interior,
it had to.

If they were Indians#

And the answer was no# it doesn’t have to be.

And they so argued# as a matter of fact# that it didn’t have
to be.
QUESTION:

Mr. Randolph# has Congress ever recognized

in any official way the Kansas Delawares since 1866?
MS. RANDOLPH:

No.

There is precedent — the

question came up. a question quite similar to /this# in 1906#
where there was another distribution to the Cherokee Delaware
Tribe# and in that distribution, the distribution was made to
vhe Delaware Tribe of Indians.

The question cam® up# does

that include the Kansas Delawares?

In 1906# the answer that

was decided riper, by the Secretary of Interior and the
Comptroller of the Currency — and we've got this set out in
.:r brief .. is no# tha Kansas Delawares are people that; are
descended from those who renounced their tribal membership in
1866# and they are certainly not entitled to this portion of

32
this award of $150,000.

Even though, l might add,, that soma

of the wrongs that the $150,000 was to compensate for we re
wrongs that occurred prior to 1866»
QUESTION:

Mr» Randolph, can I ask you one other

question, to be sure: I have your position right?

Assume

arguendo, and I knew you don* t accept this, but that the
ancestors of the Kansas Delawares were members of the class
that was wronged by the United States when it breached the
Treaty in 1854»

Assume further that the Indian Claims

Commission intended the award to benefit all of the descendants
of -'-ha class of all of the members who were wronged»
I take your position to be, nevertheless Congress,
in appropriating the money to satisfy the judgment, could
exclude people not members of Tribes,,
MR» RANDOLPHi
QUESTION:

Yes»

May I explain why?

So that — I mean, your position, your

legal position doesn't really rest on the equities at all.
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTIONs

Well, I —

What I'm really saying is that if on®

thinks it's somehow unfair to treat these people, you say
that's completely irrelevant, really,as a matter of legal
analysis»
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Yes»

U;,» RANDOLPH:

May I just expand upon that for one

33

second?
The: fairness of it is not the constitutional test?
certainly. Mr. Justice.

The constitutional test is rationality..

I know sometimes the Court uses the word "reasonable", but I
take it? by "reasonable" they don’t mean "fair" in the Court’s
eyes, because that would mean fairly subjective judgments.
The question is whether the distinction in this case
is a distinction that’s derived from reasoning, not based on
a flip of the coin.

is

And I think it's absolutely certain that

o

QUESTION:

Well, fairness may be irrelevant or it

may not, but I think your position would mean even if there
had been a judgment by something like the Court of Claims for
the entire class, but no money to pay it, Congress could
rationally decide to pay only soma of the participants in the
judgment and not others.
HR. RANDOLPH:

And the others would have, in their

possession, an unsatisfied judgment of the Court of Claims,
which Congress has absolutely no obligation to fulfill, and
the Court has so held.

QUESTION:

Thera’s a footnote in our brief

Glidden v, Zdanok is one of them.
Well, if Congress decides to appropriate

public moneys, supposing this weren't an Indian case at all,
is it held to any rational basis standard?

What if it just

decides that every tenth person in the country shall get $100?

MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, I 'think that's a question that,

as I view it, is open to the Court.

I mean, I can think of

Congress, X suppose, could apportion

money and give it only to people that are white.
QUESTION:

Well, that would raise a different

question than a purely random
MR. RANDOLPH:

If it were purely random, then it

would be, I suppose it could do it? I don’t know.
QUESTION:

I take it what you3re saying is that

whatever the test, if soma test is to be applied, it’s- the
lowest tier test that is to b® applied?
MR. RANDOLPH:

The Court has said for 200 years,

o--: 100 years, however many years they've been deciding Indian
cases, that what is best for the Indians is a judgment that’s
left to Congress.

And the only Indian — because of the

special relationship with Indians, who are the Indians that
Congress has a special > relationship with in this case?
Kansas Delawares?

No.

JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Randolph.

35
Mr. Stagner.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DELMER L. STAGNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. STAGNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
First of all, I would like to advise the Court I am
a little hard of hearing, and should I not understand the
question, I hope you will understand.
We have filed in -this case, in Case No. 75™ 1495,
which was the appeal of the Secretary, a motion to dismiss,
in which we cited certain authorities that we're sura the
Court will consider those authorities along with the others
in our brief in the consideration of this case.

We simply

did not. burden the brief with a repeating of those same
arguments.

It was suggested that we had not responded to

Horton vs. Mancarl, and our response to that case, and our
basis for saying, chat it is not applicable to this case is
included in that motion to dismiss.
I

think it’s important, if the Court please, to

understand that we’re her© before -the Court at this time in
two ‘'capacities.

The Kansas Delawares are not only the

descendants of the adult Kansas Delawares who remained in
Kansas when the Tribe was moved to the Indian territory in
1367.

There were- 48 minor children of those adults.
And Article IX of the Treaty of .1866 treated the

36
rights of those minor children quite differently than ife did
the rights of the adults»

And the present class of Kansas

Delawares area the present descendants of those minor Kansas
Delawares, that is, -who were minors in 1866, the same as they
are the descendants of the adults, just one generation less
remote»
But this has some serious differences in terms of
their legal standing before this Court, and in their claim
to chare in. the proceeds of this judgment.
It has ha-on presented to the Court in the arguments
that we are here representing expatriates, persons who have
resigned.

The fact is the minors never resigned from the

Tribe, and those are our ancestors.
QUESTION: Well, they weren’t around
MR. STAGNER:
QUESTION:

QUESTIONs

Yes, sir.

The grandchildren?

MR. STAGNER:
listed on the roll.

then, were they?

The minors were alive, they were

If the Court will note ~~
As of what date are you speaking?

MR. STAGNER:

1366.

In 1866, Article IX of the Treaty provided that the
adults could resign, but the minor children of those adults
were not required to resign, but were granted the option un-til
they reach?.'! the age of 21, to elect whether or not to resign.
They were allows*!, of course, to remain in Kansas with their

37

parents.
QUESTION:

I want to be sure.

The. children you ar®

speaking of are children of the 21 adults?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. STAGNER:

Yes. sir.

And they were shown on fee

registry.
QUESTION:

They weren't orphans.

No.

MR. STAGNER:

Wa have in this case -QUESTION;

Mr. Stagner, I understood you to use the

terra "grandchildren” when you first spoke.,
MR. STAGNER:
QUESTION:

No, I'm sorry, —
Children.

MR. STAGNER:

Yes.

I may have misspoken, but I mean

the chiIdren.
QUESTION:

Yes. There were no grandchildren probably

at that tins®.
MR. STAGNER:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

Yes,

MR. STAGNER:

As a matter of fact, Wanda June Weeks,

who is the plaintiff in this case, is the grand-daughter of a
man who is on bhat roll of 1866.

Her grandfather appears on

that; roll ns r. minor, and therefor© we’re just talking about,
two generations.

38

The question was raised about the enormity of the
problem of trying to trace back, but this is suggesting to
this Court that in order for the Kansas Delawares to be
entitled to Share, that, it would be necessary to be a catch­
all phrase,, so that you may get into a question of —
QUESTIONs

When did any ancestor of Mrs. Weeks

attend, a tribal meeting?
MR® STAGNER;

Mrs. Weeks, herself, as the record

shows, attended the tribal meetings.
QUESTION; When?

— X mean nineteen sixty™ —
QUESTION;

Yes, when the money was coming up.

MR® STAGNER:

[Laughter.3
MR. STAGNER:

Well - let ras address myself to that

point.
QUESTION: Well, did she attend any — any of her
ancestors attend prior to the I960 8s?
MR. STAGNER:

Well, sir, that’s hard to answer,

because of the history, which I would like to relate to you,
to explain the answer, —•
QUESTION;
MR. STAGNERs

But is there any —
— that there has been no tribal

39
meeting»
QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record to show

anything that any ancestor of Mrs, Weeks did in a tribal
manner before the 196G's?
MR. STAGNER:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

So she wasn't a member of the Tribe until

3.9 SO.
MR, STAGNER;

Well, our contention is, sir, that in

1960 there was no Tribe.
But, now, if the question related to Mrs. Weeks,
lot me relate the question to tile Kansas Delaware class, which
is, after all, she is hare in a representative capacity of
the whole class.
In fact, the last chief of the Delawares was in 1894,
when the last chief died.

The record shows -that in 1895, they

elected a Business Committee,

That Business Committee was

elected by the Cherokee Delawares, who were residing with
the Cheroka© Nation.

And its only function -through the years,

from that date to this date, is to present claims against the
United Statos.
Tbs testimony is clear, the testimony in this record
©ad in the Indian Claims Commission is of -the Chairman of
the Business Committes of the group -that calls itself the
Delaware: Tribe of Indians.

And that chairman is a man named

Jo.v IJerfclfo, ©o.d ho woo Chairman for 32 years, I believe it was.

40
He's the tu&n who brought; the action in the Indian Claims
Commission on behalf of the Tribe, signed the employment
contract for the attorney, and h® was- interestingly, a Kansas
Delaware.
Th© reason for that was that his mother had been one
of the 21 adults that remained in Kansas«

After the Tribe had

moved down here, his mother, being the daughter of the Chief
of tli® Tribe, married an Oklahoma man, moved to Oklahoma»
And —
QUESTION;

Are you going to end up by saying

nobody is entitled to this money?
MR. STAGNER;
QUESTION:

I’m sorry, I didn’t understand?

Are you going to end up by saying that

nobody is entitled to this money?
HR. STAGNER:

No, sir.

No, sir.

I'm saying that,

us v.h© representatives of the Kansas Delaware minors, we stand
on the same footing as members of th® historical Tribe who
owns this cause of action.
And I think it might be appropriate to address that
question th--

was raised as to the ownership of the cause of

action that existed in 1866»
QUESTION: Before you proceed to that, Mr. Stagner,
could you static what were the legal rights; of th® minor
children of these 21 people who left the Tribe in 1866 or
■oor. f h©r©~\f':?

41
MP.o STAGNER:

Be glad to.

Article IX provided —
QUESTION:

You said they are quite different from

their parents, and you relied on the difference, and just ~~
I would ho interested in what their legal status was®
MR. STAGNER:

All right, sir.

Article IX provided that the minors could remain
with their parents in Kansas.

They could continue to receive

their annuities.
QUESTION:

Right. And they all in fact did remain

with their parents?
MR. STAGNER:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; Didn't they?
MR. STAGNER:

Yes, sir.

And they could continue to receive their annuities.
They were «yariad an option until they reached -— when they
reached 21, to elect, at that time, whether or not, to resign
from the Tribe.

And if they elected to resign from the Tribe

at that tiro®, they would be entitled to a patent for the
allotment which they held, and would then have been entitled
to their pro rata share of the trust fund, the same as their
parents had bean given in 1866.
But the historical event that has been left out of

the presentation is that the very next year, after that Treaty
of 1066, the Delaware Tribe rad© an agreement with the Cherokee

42
tion, w

re moving to Oklahoma Territory under

a paragraph of a prior Treaty between the United States and
•the Cherokee Nation, whereby it would have been necessary for
them to abandon their tribal existence.
The Delawares sleeted to move east of the 96-degree
longitude, and under the Treaty provisions that were applicable
to that move, as ‘this Court has found in cases that have
been before you before — I want -to mention that in a moment?
I'm reminding myself not to forget it.
The Delawares moved east of the 96-degree longitude,
not as a tribe at all, and this Court has so found.

The

Cherokee Delawares have been before this Court before, twice.
Tbrr were burs iu a capacity as Cherokeas, seeking from this
Court their share of the Cherokee assets.

They were success­

ful .
And in the trial of that case, -these same people
claimed not to be Delawares, they claimed to be Cherokees,
and trey were right, because the agreement which they had
entered into and under which they moved was an agreement under
rich the tribal existence, the political body of the Delaware
Tribe, went out of existence.

And it had to, for them to be

able to move where they did.
And in that case this Court specifically found that
t

fid move vrcKr b'vv.fe condition, that section of the

Treaty, and thru since the year 1867, Justice Marshall, it is

43
our contention from that day there has been no tribe» There
has been a group that is calling itself a tribe,- but it is
our contention -that that group does not, in any sense, rise
to the dignity of a tribe»

They are an identifiable group of

- people, of which our people were a part, until this —
QUESTION:

Well, where is the tribe that's entitled

to this money?
MR» STAGNER;

Sir?

QUESTION; Where is the tribe that’s entitled to
this money?
MR» STAGNER;

Where is the tribe entabled to fch©

money?
QUESTIONs As I understand you as of new, nobody is
a tribe»
MR» STAGNER:

Well, Congress, in the Indian Claims

Commission actions, is always faced with this kind of a
situation.

As you, the Court, will know, the Indian Claims

Commission Act allows actions to be brought not just by
tribes, it can be brought by tribes, bands, and other
identiflable groups»
Now the other identifiable groups are there obviously
because there are many, many people who are current representa­
tives of historic tribes that no longer exist as political
bodies.

That’s what happened in this case.
These- two groups filed these actions in the Indian

44
Claims Commission as representatives of the historical tribe = .
It. is the historical tribe who owns the cause of action.
Who now own the judgment.
I quote from Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians
vs. United States, a Court of Claims case» reported at 430 Fed
2d 335. in which they cite the earlier case of McGhee vb.
United States, and say that 55the ancestral group ’owns* the
claim, and ti e present-day Indian groups are before the

Commission only on behalf of the ancestral entity."
bow, where you have that situation, and there is no
present modern-day tribe that is representative of that
historical group. Congress then has elected, as they have in

many, of these

union distribution Acts, to distribute the

money on a dascendancy basis.

Stronger under due process, yes, sir,

under just compensation.
QUESTION;

Yes, well, that's what this — the basia

of the court's opinion was due process, as I understand.
And you told us that ’the children were — remained
with 'their families, with their adult parents, in Kansas, and
they were given the right under the Treaty, when they reached
fchs age of majority, 21, to decide whether or not -they wanted
to return to the Tribe.
MR. STAGNER:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Now, what in fact did they do? Did any

single on© of them return to the Tribe?
MR. STAGNER:

No, sir, I*xn sorry, I didn't continue

tolling you that historical background for the minors.
QUESTION:
you.

No, you didn't, because we interrupted

I interrupted you.
MR. STAGNER:

Because, in 1867, the next year, the

Tribe made its contract with the Cherokee Nation, and left,
and under ilia terras of that Treaty, no one could ba added to
that, registry for moving to the Cherokee Nation after thirty
days.
Tha -minors simply had no option to return to the
Tribe. The Tribe want out of existence. The individual
Delawares 'went to .the Cherokee Nation.

There was no Tribe

46
from which they could resign.
Therefore, the Congress , recognising that status
that they were in, in 1874, appropriated funds to pay them for
their pro rata part of the Delaware national fund as it then,
existed.
Also to grant them their patents to their allotments,
the same &s if they had been an adult in 1866. And in ~~
QUESTIONs

What was that, 80 acres?

MR, STAGNER:
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. STAGNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, 80 acres.

And —

In Kansas?

MR. STAGNER:

In Kansas.

All of them*had had an 80-acre allotment.
QUESTION;
MR. STAGNER;

All the adults had?
All of them.

In 1360 thore had been an allotment of all the lands
in Kansas — that is, there had been an allotment of 80 acres
to each of the msrabers in Kansas, and the other lands were
surplus.
sse who moved to the Cherokee Nation, the:
allotments ware sold.
QUESTION: Right.
HR. STAGNER: And they, in turn, bought a life ©state

in the 160 acr*-s in the €herok©s Nation.

47
But.* substantially* all of them had bean treated
alike* so far as the real property is concerned.
The minor Delawares got their share of the Delaware
general fund just like their parents did* but at a later time.
But so did the Cherokee Delawares«,

The general fund

was totally expanded by 1893. There was an appropriation that
paid to fell® Cherokee Delawares the balance of the general fund,
So they all are on the same footing* so far as having been
given their part of the general fund.
As to the citizenship problem, it’s asserted by the
Absentees in this case that the Appropriation Act of 1874,
which conferred United States citizenship on the minor Dela­
wares, had the effect of terminating their Indian membership.
We say that that is contrary to many holdings of this
Court,

They rely upon the case of Elk vs, Wilkins, which

did not in any sense hold that. This Court., in a number of
cases,

I believe that there are six of them — have held

fhore is no incompatibility between the United States
citizenship and membership in an Indian Tribej and in the case
of v

. Amos, you specifically held that the conferring

of United States citizenship does not terminate Indian
citizenship.
So that the basis for their saying that the minors'
membership in the Tribe just simply is contrary to the holdings
of this Court

48
In 1875

,

then. Your Honor, the next year after the

Appropriation Act and the granting of citizenship, there was
an Act passed that now appears at 43 U „ S» Section. 189, which
was dealing with the historical problem then of the
government trying to encourage the Indians to leave the
reservations, and the history of this has been discussed in
several lower court cases, that what the government wanted t©
do was to get the Indians to resign and assimilate» That was
the public policy.
And in keeping with that public policy, they passed
this Act, and the last, paragraph of that Act, referring to
Indians who had theretofore resigned from fchair Tribe, or
ir tribal relationship, or shall hereafter abandon
■their relahiovcihip, Congress said that they shalli be entitled

to — or I.*.® da all be entitled to his distributive .share of
all annuities, tribal funds, lands and other property, the
same as though he had maintained his tribal relations ? and
any transfer, alienation or encumbrance of &ny interest he
nay hold or claim by reason of his former tribal relations
shall be void.
Now, it was just a year before that that they had
granted citizenship to these minors.
Now, we clo not contend, of course, that that being
an hat of Congress that that could not be repealed.
not boar,

It has

Juk? they arc -** the appellants in this case arc©

43

cono«mdlng that impliedly the challenged statute her© repealed
that section.
Because they have coma to you with the argument, as
it did to the trial court, assarting that these funds are
tribal 'funds and 'that they ara -the Tribe.
We say 'that the adjudicated cases say that they are
tribal funds, but only of the historical Tribe, and that
Congress, in dealing with those, tribal funds, then, of the
historical Tribe, may decide how to utilize those funds as
they appropriate money to pay an Indian Claims Commission
judgment.
And you have varying kinds of circumstances that
Congress has 1» deal with.

Such as the Navajoes, where they

are a homogenous unit, 'they can channel the funds through the
tribal unit &ok the members gst the benefits of it.

dsscendancy statute but sa being a distribution of these
fvo.. o

too Trike and, through the Tribe, to the members, and

ik.ru the i-.mhsrship is to be determined in accordance with the

We think that’s a misreading of Congress’ intention.

QUESTION?

I understand ax at.

MR. STACKER:

But, assuming that it's distributed

to all these classes, we’11 have five parcent.
I*d like to address my attention to one other state™
■«%.
33at mad.? by counsel, and that is, that this Court would
believe from the shet&ment made that th© group that’s calling

itself the. Cherokee Delaware class is a homogeneous class that
has bean 1 sving 'tribal meetings•

In fact, there are, as the

52

record shows here, 7500 of there scattered over 25 States of
v.

the Nation, they have no reservation, there has never been a
constitution that was adopted by this group until after this
lawsuit was filed.
Now, they are before you today saying, 51 We * re here
as

federally recognized tribe,*8

They are.

At least they

haves been recognized, after this lawsuit was tried.

And the

constitution which they adopted was after this lawsuit was

triad.

And this is pretty much a self-serving effort to try

•to gat themselves in a position, being able to corns to you,

to be a federally recognised tribe.
We say that at the tires of the action before the
Indian Claires Coremission# at the tire© of the adoption of this
statute, they had no such standing at all.

Thera was a Business Committee, period.

And that

Re-dross Cosridthae's job was to pursue this lawsuit, and that*a
nil that's hc?r, involved.

The by-laws that are affecting

that, or giving the paver to that Business Committee is in
til® record.

And the record shows that that is all that this

group has done.
Now, 'di at is an important thing for this group to

have dons.

OUS3TION:

Mr. Stagnar# let me interrupt again# to

54
QUESTION:

Prior to 18X8.

So they certainly —

they were not even arguably a part of the Tribe in 1854 and
1866?
MR. STAGNER:

No, sir.

Now, one little problem, and like all statements,
they are over-simplifications, is that in 1854 there were
about 200 Christian. Munsees that were living in Kansas on the
Kansas Reservation* They were the real problem, the knotty
problem.

But the Treaty of 1366 had dealt with those

Christian Munsees.

They were required to pay to the Tribe

so much per acre for the lands which they occupied. They were
not there as a part of the Delaware Tribe,

They were there

separate . -• 3 apart, and they had no share in any of the
: a matter of fact, they had to pay to get
their share.

And —

QUESTION:

So that they lived in Kansas, but were

not part of the Tribe?
MR. STAGNER:

That'3 right.

And that is why, you

sthat in drafting the statute, that they were a little
afraid to us® the catch-all phrase, because you would still
have the question of whether or not it included the Christian
Munsees.
QUESTION:

I see.

!: h. iTAGNE-R:

3c- someone got the bright idea, well,

let's just strike out the catch-all altogether, without

55

rentambe ri ng that if you do that you eliminate thess 300 .
pacpl& that ^srs already recognised as members of the Tribe
for the previous award, and were paid.

And the question

raised as to the administrative inconvenience of including
them, they have already — 300 ox them have already proved
their claims•

And no question ever raised anywhere that they

were not members of the Tribe.

They were paid in the original

payment, for s wrong prior to this one, as a matter of fact.
They had successfully proved their lineal ancestry
to the Tribe as of 1818, and now they are saying, Well, that
was a mistake, too, I guess.
But on© point I think that I need to touch on is
diffcc.iUH.-3 in the. status of th© adult Kansas Delawares,
as that .affects the legal question that this Court must deal
wi th.
As I indicated, we are here assorting that there® has

been .an arbitrary elsssif±cation, by error, but, nevertheless,
mm, resolved, an arbitrary classification by mistake, and
ya were left cut.
And that, in violation of th© equal protection of th©

Pifth Amendment.
We also have based cur claim to share in this

distribution upon the fact that in 1866 the shares of th© 21
adults, all being the. ancestors of our clients, became
individualized interests•

One® they left the Tribe, as in many,

56
many cases this Court h as held that once ‘that individual leaves
•the Tribe and receives certain assets , those are individual!zed,
and -they are protected by the Fifth Amendment from any taking,
without just compensation.
There is a line of cases, Jones vs. Meehan, which has
a landmark case, in which this Court has held that interest
of Indians in 'the tribal assets? ones individualized, become
a property right that's protected by the Fifth Amendment
against taking without paying just compensation.
So we have asserted that as a further basis for tine
fact that this statute is unconstitutional, because it does

not take that into account and allow those persons to share.
Admittedly, that raises the question as to whether
or not the;, payment of tills money would be a talcing of that
right.

But w® did not get from the trial court a distribu­

tion, a right to have this money distributed to us.

eric'-i

All the

court said was that the descendancy statute, as framed,

arbitrarily excluded us.

It will be up to Congress in framing

may decide.

the Congress to appropriate moneys to us.
As to the case that I've just referred to — the

QUESTION:

Mr, Stagner, in connection with your

rather than to individuals?
MR. STAGNERs
QUESTION:

No, sir.

I thought the government’s argument was

this is all money being given to Tribes.
MR. STAGNER:

That’s what the government contends,

sir. Anci I —■
QUESTION:

But you say it’s going to be given to

thousands of individuals?
MR. STAGNER:
QUESTION;

Sir?

It’s going to be given to several hundred

or seven or eight thousand individuals?
/

MR. STAGNER:

Yes, sir.

vLav; me explain shat a little.

This is a basic

fference in our approach,in this, that has caused a lot of the
difficulty.

But, of course, this Court is going to look at

what, the Congress did, not what I say or what Mr. Randolph
said. And whoa you look at the statute, you see that what the
statute dees is say that there shall b® a roll made up of
lineal descendants and this money, 90 percent of this money
shall be paid ho those persons on that roll.

Non® of that

going to any tribal' entity at all.
It’s a direct descendancy, lineal descandancy distri­
bution.
The other ten percent, however, was to be set back
for tribal, us®, and a part of that was — a pro rata part of

59
that was to gc to the Absentee group.
an organised entity.

It was, at that time,

But; the Cherokee group who now stands

before you and says,- "We5re a Tribe51, in 1972 couldn’t say that.
They weren't.

And therefore the Congress, in Section 1294(b),

as to the ten percent, or their pro rata part of the ten
percent that would be shared by the Cherokee Delawares , said
that the Secretary of the Interior shall not approve the use
of the funds remaining to the credit of the Tribe until the
Tribe is organised, a legal entity, which, in the judgment
of the Secretary, adequately protects the interest of its
members.
r;.;w, we say that Congress was recognizing at that
time that there was no federally recognized Tribe that even
chat -acmey wes going to.
we

!o

That Congress recognised, just as

or as wt contend in this case — that here was a

group saying they were the Tribe, but were not in fact.
One- little thing just occurred to it® as I — I left
in my argument in recitation of the membership question.
Mr. Jo© Barbies, who brought this lawsuit, as I say, was
Coairman of the* Committes that brought this lawsuit, was a
Kansas Delaware.

K© retired in 1952, after the suit had

• t;n filar, . And at the iir-.r of his retirement, this group,
woeting in Councilm the Delaware Tribe of Indians, adopted
Barties and all of his descendants

naas Delaware families, saying that

60
we recognize that; yon are members of the group, you are members
of the Tribe, you’re entitled fco your share in all the lands.
We were not only for thirty years attending their
meetings, we chaired the meetings, that wa had actually two
men on the Council that were Kansas Delawares, of Kansas
Delaware origin.
And Mr. Barbies died.
Chairman became

The subsequent Tribal

they cams then out of -’die Cherokee group,

rather than out of the Kansas group.

And even they didn't

disclaim us.
And I think it's important to note that nothing in
the 337 docket legislative history excluded us, we were
■

ted for thai

pose.

The original recommended bill for

the distribution of this very fund that was offered by the
Indians also included us.

They, clear up to that time, ware

recognizing that wa were part of the group.
QUESTION:

Mr. Stagner, may I interrupt again,

because you say Jo© 3arties, who is a member of your group,
was a leader in the prosecution of this lawsuit.

Now, by

that, do you mean the suit attacking the statute, or do you
mean Uh© prosecution of Claim 72 and 298?
MR. STAGNER:
QUESTION:

72 and 298.
So you’re talking about the creation of

the claim, not the lawsuit attacking the statute, then?
ME. STAGNER:

That*s right.

That’s right.

61
QUESTIONS Was he also involved in the prosecution
of th© claim 337?
MR. STAGNER:
QUESTION:
MR. STAGNER:
wrong on it.

Yes, sir.
I see.
I say that, and I don't want to be

Before the Indian Claims Commission, as I recall,

the Absentees had filed one claim, th® Cherokee Delawares had
filed number©us claims, and they were consolidated into
various ways, and they all participated together in those
actions.
And to say that th© Kansas Delawares actually filed
337, I don't recall.

But. they were included in and involved

in, participated in the determination of that action.
And I just don't have the recollection of which
croup actually filer it. But they were all treated together
by the Indian claims Commission as applying to both of these
groups.
How, the group here that is try:?jag "bo exclude us
: offered you rationale which they say would support the
statuta, had the accident not been made and they had been
dropped out.,
How, it's pretty obvious that this is a rational
that's n&var been considered by Congress.

This is a rations!

that's proffered by theue parties for the self-serving purpose
of defeating this iewsuit* of .course.

And w© have tried to

62
answer tLoa* proffered .vs- dcials, one by on®, in our briefs.
Bub an® of the things that bothers us is the
suggestion made by the government that we are

asking this

Court to do something that is very, very unusual, and is going
to cause the government a lot of troubles, a lot of
administrative inconvenience — that phrase, I know, is not
new to this Court*
But the administrative inconvenience involved here
is mat tliay would simply have to look at, in the case of
Wanda Weeks, two birth certificates* They have looked at it
and approved it*
It’s a bugaboo for them to say that this is going
to

be. a big ethnological problem to the Secretary of the

Interior.

And to consider this case in comparison of recent

casos the Court has had, I believe it was the Lucas case,
where you were dealing with the question of exclusion and
presumptions and so forth, had the Act put the duty on us to
prove our ancestry back to the Tribe of 1354, and we had
said that that's putting &

duty on us that has not bean put

on the other groups in the class, that would bring us within
vbe Lucas case*
But the Lucas case, you were very careful to
distinguish it, from 'those situations where: it was a rebuttable
presumption on one hand, or an irrebuttable presumption on the
otter.

We hsv-a 1: uv; vu cbsolufcv exclusion*

Thar© is no way

S3
that: this Court can read this statute to include us# save an
abortive effort that happened at that time# as the record
shows# once this accident, happened and was discovered- it
was of sores concern to the Indians that were involved»
the record shows it was»

And

And the Chairman of -the Business

Committee case to Washington to try to get it; amended, to
include us»
And to solve the problem, an arrangement was made
for an administrative construction by construing the 1906
roll as being an open roll, like the 1940 roll was, to just
“ -feinistrativaly construe to add the words ”or be entitled to
be on such roll5*»

Then, if that had been so construed to

the Kansas Delawares to show that they were entitled
to be on that roll for purposes of this distribution, it
solved the problem.
And that’s where it stood until they denied the
claims,

Someone in the Bureau than denied the claims, after

Congress, relying upon that, didn’t amend the Act.

Then, of

course, they had to go through the administrative procedure
and finally wind up before this Court»
But the question that Your Honor raised, that I
think is answered by the history that's shown by the record
in this case it* the contemporary construction that was given
to the Treaty of 1866, because the very first paragraph of
that Treaty relatus to a cl cilia which tills Tribe had, because

64
thsy had had

sok;

lands taken for railroad purposes, for

v?hieh they had never been compensated.
In 1860 the — some of their lands were taken for
railroad right-of-way purposes, given to the railroad by a
Treaty between the

Delawares and the government.

The railroad

refused to pay for it. The government refused to pay for it.
The Delaware's had no way of collecting it.

As a matter of

fact, a lawsuit was filed against -the railroad.
The Court held the railroad was not a party.
don't have any suit against the railroad.

You

The only way you

can gat paid is to be paid by the government.
Well,- that had not been paid in 1866 when the
gov; rnmsnfc says to the Delawares:

We want you to move to

Oklahoma Territory.
And they said: What about cur railroad money?

We’d

like to have that determined.
And you’ll not© the vary first paragraph of 'the
Trnniy of 1356 deals with that claim, in which the United
States guaranteed the Delawares that they would receive the
funds that, were due to them. And that was not even an
ting claim against the government, it was an existing
claim against n third party.
Article IX, then, which reserved the rights to share
in the assets, did not speak to a share in the Article I money?
but, in fact, w© proved in this action, that when that money

65
w-

approprited in. 189k, I believe it was, the residing

Kansas Delawares got their share.
Wow, the reason for that was —
QUESTIONs

That’s the railroad claim you’re still

talking about?
MR, STAGNER:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

Okay,

MR, STAGNER:

And that was an inchoate claim, an

abstract claim out there, where it was understood, from the
four corners of Article IX, by everybody -Shat if you will
resign, or elect to resign, then you will get your share of
r

assets. And it included all of the assets in which they

then had an interest.
":v. i ,lieve that we hive presented to this Court a
• 1 • r showing not only inequity but a showing of a legal
right to, in support of the unconstitutiQuality because of
the invidious discrimination.
The government in its brief has said that the
answer to this case is that Congress should determine what
should happen to this money. We agree.

The relief given us

by the trial court was just. that.
We asked the trial court, going in in a class action,
:

v; . ~.v'

' : der.:;r5':diiG if w-v rentitled to share and

f up the; rrohinery to allow us to participate. The trial
court denied

he

that relief,

Tie trial court chucked this

66
back to Congress, so that if the Congress feels it was in
error, that; they can correct it»

And at that time, of course,

the Congress will consider what this Court has said about 'the
status of these parties and their legal claim to share in the
proceeds of -this judgment-»
And there are many historical precedents, contrary
to whet's indicated by the brief of the appellantse for this
Court involving itself in the protection of Indian rights»
Just because they are Indians does not. mean they are not
United States citizens, with all 'the rights of 'the Fifth
Amendment.

And this Court has historically protected those

rights, where they became individualized.

MR* STAGNER:

Yes, sir.

I think the finding is that

they are Indians in the. same sense the Cherokee Delawares are.
Because the Cherokee Delawares —~
QUBSTION:

It was a specific finding on that?

MR. STAGNER:

I believe — I believe there is, sir.

67
It is not disputed in the case that we are the smae blood as
they are, historically.
The only question there is you're dealing with:
What: is an Indian in relation to a

political entity?

And

there is a serious question in this case as to whether or not
there even is a political entity or could be under this Court’s
holding in Baker vs» Carr,
In Baker va. Carr» you said Congress cannot just
call a group an Indian Tribe, and then deal with them under
the plenary power, without the courts having the right to
inquire as to your actions»
QUESTION:

I missed that in the Baker v, Carr case,

MR» STAGNER:

And we think that if you apply that

in this case, that there is a serious question whether even
the Cherokee Delawares are a Tribe.

No court, of course,

has defined what an Indian Tribe is.
In Montoya vs» Uni tod States, it is.
But it becomes a little distortion here because they
•-ow say we are a federally recognized Tribe, without consider­
ing the chronology of that event. That happened after the
lawsuit was tried.

The court was asked to approve it, the

trial court did not determine that that was not a matter that
was relevant to the case.
Than}: you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Stagnor.

/REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD J. ROTHBAUM, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. ROTHBAUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, end may it please

the Court:
This Court is not the proper forum in which to re­
try all tiie factual issues which were tried below.

There is

the unanimous finding cf the court below in regard to the
Delaware Tribe of Oklahoma.

It reads, quote, "The Kansas

Delawares deny that such tribal identity has been maintained
by Mis Cherokee Delawares.
'

We are unable to agree, and find

the Cherolcee Dslawares have maintained group identity,

having Chiefs and Business Committees continuously until the
present time."
We litigated that issue below, with a unanimous
finding on the point.
Theirs at page 16 of the Jurisdictional Statement.
In regard to the Absentee Delaware Tribe of Western
Oklahoma, who I have the honor to represent, -the finding is
the Absentee Delaware Tribe of Western Oklahoma has maintained
group identity, having Chiefs and a Tribal Council up to the
present time.

That's at page 12 of our Jurisdictional

Statement, page 1218 of 406 Fed Supp.
How, in regard fee the time of recognition of the
Tribes, the Cb-Groksa

or, their proper name, the

65
Delaware Tribe of Oklahoma* has b-asn a federally recognized
Tribe since 1962.

The documents that: were referred to by

Mr. Stagner do not deal wife federal recognition. That's
discussed ably in the brief of Mr. Christensen, and particularly
his Reply Brief.
The Absentee Delaware Tribe of Western Oklahoma has
fc'-.oa a federally recognized Tribe since 1357. has many
tribal functions. They are all in the record, in answers to
.interrogatories , requests for admissions.

If the Court feels

it important, we could easily prepare a post-argument memoran­
dum on it.
Now, in regard to the proposed administrativa
construction of the statute.

Dawart Barnes, Associate

Solicitor at Interior, did writ® a letter proposing that the
,3red open.

That would not have .included

xrr-rru.vs Dolor,os, because they were not eligible fco be on feat

1906 roll.

The Comptroller General so held, in 1904.

This

same exact identical question came up.
Wrongs ean>mi tu* 1 against fee Delaware Tribe. v?ho
should got fee Money, particularly should those who resigned
in Kansas get that money?
Th© question want -to the Attorney General. The
Attorney General wrote e long opinion, and then he said,
But I'm going to submit it for final decision fco fee Comptroller

General• The Comptroller General wrote a long decision, approv-

70

lag exclusion of the Kansas Dslawarss for the reason that in
Article IX of the: 1066 Treaty f

they had expatriated themselves

from the Tribe.
How, in regard to the minors, we do not argue that
Elk vs - Wilkins holds that, you can’t be the member of an
Indian Tribe and a member of the United States at the same
time. And if that's the impression that was drawn from our
brief, we’re sorry»
QUESTION:

Mr. Rothb&ura, I just lost a point.

You say the Attorney General wrote a long opinion saying that
l:

: >ir 'M Delawares were excluded'because -they had been

< oairiatecL

In connection with which claim was that

opinion?
HR, AOTHBAUM:

In connection with a series of claims

which were — it was the Comptroller General’s opinion which
was finally conclusive, Mr. Justice Stevens.

We have repro­

duce d both the Attorney General’s opinion and the Comptroller
General's opinion in pertinent part in our briefs.
There was a series of claims filed in the Court of
Claims, under a special jurisdictional act in 1901, or 1902,
I won’t swear to the data right at the moment.

The government

.agreed to settle the claims for a set amount of money.
The question. than became:

To whom is this money to be paid?

Is it to be — and the Comptroller Genera.? ruled it is to be
to —

QUESTION:

But just so I have it# these are

claims other than 337, 72 or 298?
MR. ROTHBAUM:

Yes,, Your Honor.

I see.

MR. ROTHBAUM:

But they do include the — the claims

bution on claim 337?
MR. ROTHBAUM:

They were.

Is that consistent with the other

Attorney General5s opinion?
MR. ROTHBAUM:

It is inconsistent.

The two tribal

entities opposed before Congress the use of a catch-all clause.
i'e think it x-m a mistake. Wa think that —
QUESTION:

Did they rely on. the Attorney General's

opinion in opposing the distribution?
MR. ROTHBAUM:
QUESTION:

I cannot state that for a fact.

But iha Attorney General’s opinion came

before the distribution statute related to claim 337?
MR. ROTHBAUM:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I sea.

MR. ROTHBAUM:

Both the Attorney General’s opinion

and. :h& Comptroller General’s opinion are 1904.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. ROTHBAUM:

Half a century prior to this time.

72
It. is ferus that there is a catch-all clause in 337,
Ws think that, was a mistake.
QUESTION:

And we think the history of it —

Well, if yon prevail, your side prevails

can Congress make the same mistake?
MR, ROTHEAUM:

Tomorrow?

Can Congress make feh© same mistake?

QUESTION: Bo the warn© thing it did with 337?
MR, ROTHEAUM:

Yes,

Congress could do it*
QUESTION: Could do it.

pain out. under this Court’s holding in Gen and similar cases.
We think it would be wrong.
But I do want to mention the question of the legis­
lative history which was before Congress.
Wow e it is true that the Munsee problem was a
substantial problem.

It is true that the Munsees had

r-ipcirated th^ms^lves from the Delaware Tribe in 1818, but that
the Bureau of Indian Affairs kept trying to bring them in.
But the attorney who represented the Tribes, before Congress,
pointed out to the Congress axpressly

and this is in the

record, it’s in the testimony — -that under a holding of the
Court of Clais-n, Minnesota Chippewa Tribe,- which is reported
in 115 Fed 2d, iiz& Indian Claims Commission Act, says the

73
Court of Claims, requires that awards be made not to
individual descendants of tribal members at the -time of -the
taking.» but to the tribal entity or entities today, close
quote»
It is perfectly true that Congress has , on many
occasions, used desceada&cy statutes, where the Tribes are
no longer existent or no longer viable or no longer functioning
today, or where on Tribe has become assimilated ' into another.
There are not the facts of this case, found unanimously

QUESTION:

Is that consistant with the Court of Ciains

decision you just described?
MR, ROTHBAUM:

Yes, sir,

Because it is one thing

to say that a modem roll, such. a3 the 1940 base census roll
prepared by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which has the same
function as the census prepared every decade by the Bureau of
vhe Census, is to be used as a. method for locating names and
addresses.
It'-' something else- again to say we’re going to
trace ethnologically by blood every one from 1818 forward.
QUESTION: The reason being you

you have the right people.
MR. ROTHBAUM:
QUESTION:

Well, then we know we have -—
Is that, then, just to be sura I give

you a chance to answer this thought that’s troubling me, as
I understood the argument earlier, the rationale of Congress
had to b@ they wanted the money to go to "the Tribes rather
than to individuals.

How does the actual distribution square

with that argument?
•to, ROTifBtoto:

I’m sorry, I didn’t gat the last part?

75

QUESTION:

Kow dees the actual distribution to

identified individuals square with the argument that the real
policy Congress was concerned with was giving money to
Tribes rather than to individuals?
Or raayb© I misunderstood the argument.
MR. ROTHBAUM:
2ar. Justice,

I'm sorry# but I don't quite follow#

The distribution is ten percent to the Tribe#

to each of th® Tribes# --

QUESTION:

I understand that.# but the 90 percent

I am asking.
MR. ROTJTRiv.UM * The 90 percent goes to those who are
on or eligible to be on the 1940 roll prepared by the Bureau
of Indian Affairs census, as a method of determining names
and addresses.

We're not talking about people who were on or

eligible to be on a roll of 1854# or some tiling like that.
This is simply © method of determining names and addresses.
And we have in the record# from the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, the manner in which the base census roll was constructed
:;nd so forth and so on,
I f.a-a ray time has expired.

I thank ‘th© Court.

thick that th© matter here is —* there is a clear rational
basis for the decision Congress mada.
