ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G, DIEDRICK» ESQ.
On Behalf of Petitioner
MR. DIEDRICK:

*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
I am here representing Johnnie Hankerson, who is
the Petitioner in this case? to petition this Court for
dertiorari from a Supreme Court decision in North Carolina
against him.
- .s

••

The question we contend is presented here is whe­
ther the Supreme Court', of North Carolina erred in not apply­
ing Mu Haney retroactively since the doctrine of Mullaney» as
it relates to Petitioner's case» greatly affected the fact­
finding process» or the reliability of the fact-finding pro­
cess.
The state court held that» by reason of the decis­
ion of Mu Haney» the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment prohibits the use of their long-standing rules in
homicide cases, that a Defendant, in order to rebut the pre­
sumption of malice» must prove to the satisfaction of the
jury that he killed in the heat of sudden passion and to
rebut the presumption of unlawfulness» that he killed in

4
They held that those instructions as they were
given in our case, violated the concept of due process
announced by

this Court in Mullaney.

However, they declined

without further guidance from this Court to apply it retro­
actively.
Petitioner contends that the main determination to
be made by this Court in whether or not to crive Mullaney
retroactivity is x^hether or not the major purpose of the new
constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of a crimin­
al trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding func­
tion and Petitioner contends that in order to do that, this
Court must closely scrutinize the major purpose which it
held Mullaney to serve.
This Court, in its opinion on Mullaney, relied
heavily on wjnship.

This Court further, in Ivan held kinship

to be retroactive.
However, the Petitioner contends that the Court, in
its own language in Mullaney, said that the major purpose of
Mullaney was to protect the integrity of the requirements of
the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt being carried
by the prosecution in criminal cases.
It went on further to say that this major purpose
to be served by this rule was an even greater purpose than
that which was set forth in Winship.
And I quote from Mr. Justice Powell’s opinion at

5
page 700, "Not only are the interests underlying Ninship
indicated, to a greater degree in this case, but in one res­
pect, the protection afforded those interests lives here»"
In kinship, the ultimate burden of persuasion
remained with the prosecution although the stay order had
been reduced to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
In this case, that is, in the Mullaney case, by
contrast, the state has affirmatively shifted the burden of
proof to the Defendant.

The result in a case such as this

one, where the Defendant is required to prove the critical
fact in dispute;ris to increase further the likelihood of an
erroneous murder conviction.

Therefore, the Petitioner

contends that this Court has already held in its decision in
Mullaney, that the major purpose to be served by that rule
was to correct an error in the fact-finding process because
they have stated it is to do away with the increase of the
further likelihood of an erroneous murder conviction.
Now, of necessity, in determining whether or not to
apply any of these new constitutional rules retroactively,
the Court must look at prior decisions and whether or not
they have given those decisions prospective only or retro­
active applications.
However, the Petitioner in this case contends that
you need only look to Ivan as far as it relates to the case
at the Bar because of the fact that Mullaney says that the

6

interests to be protected in Mullaney itself are greater than
those in win ship, that here it is not only proof beyond a
reasonable doubt to be protected, but, further, that it
places the burden solely on the state to carry that burden.
That is to say, in the winship case, it was proof
by a preponderance of the evidence but at all times that
proof rested solely upon the prosecution.
In Mullaney, it removes that burden
the Maine rule, which was corrected

of proof, or

by this Court in Mullaney,

removed that burden of proof or shifted that burden of proof
to the Defendant.
Now, in the Maine case, or the Mullaney case, this
Court stated that in Maine itself, the prosecution was re­
quired to prove the absence of self-defense beyond a rea­
rs onabie doubt.
How, in North Carolina until the Hankerson decision,
that is, the case which is at the Bar, the Defendant himself
had to satisfy the jury that he did act in self-defense,
That is to say that the burden of proof was shifted
from the state to the Defendant to come forward and satisfy
the jury of the four things necessary for them to return a
verdict of acquittal on the grounds of self-defense.
So the Petitioner earnestly contends that while a
review of all the other cases involving retroactivity being
applied prospectively is important, this Court need look no

7
further than the language of

Mu Haney in applying it with

Ivan and Winshlp,
QUESTION;

in this case, under the prior North

Carolina lav?, until changed by the Supreme Court in this case,
there were two separate matters in which the proof or persua­
sion, at least, was shifted to the Defendant.
First, the absence of malice, which would reduce
the homicide to manslaughter.
MR. DIEDRICKs

Is that correct?

From second degree murder to man­

slaughter, that is correct.
QUESTION:

And second, the question of self-defense

which, if proved — or if the jury was satisfied by the
Defendant, would wholly acquit the Defendant.

Is that

correct?
MR. DIEDRICKs
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the North Carolina Supreme Court

has treated them both alike and both as covered by Mullaney,
did it not?
MR. DIEDRICKs
QUESTION:

Yes, it did.

And both were involved in this particular

case, weren't they?
MR. DIEDRICKs
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And yet, Mullaney did not involve any

matter that would have been a complete defense to any charge
of homicide, did it?

8
MR. DIEDRICK:

It did not, but X

would argue that

it would address itself to that.
QUESTION:

That

is seif-defense, as in this case,

or insanity, as in the Lei an cl case, or so on.
MR. DIEDRICK:

It did not directly, but I would

argue that it did direct itself to that by ste.ting that Maine
had already had the rule which required the state to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of self-defense.
QUESTION:

But it did not say that that rule was

constitutionally required, did it?
MR. DIEDRICK:

It did not, but it analogized it to

the rule of proving heat of passion and held that to be, the
way Maine had it, constitutionally prohibitive.

QUESTION:

One involves elements of the offense

that the state has to prove and the other involves an
affirmative defense to the commission of any crime, and
that would be duress or insanity or self-defense, depending
on the crime.
MR. DIEDRICK:
Honor.

I would argue differently, Your

X would tell the Court that one of the necessary —
QUESTION:

correct, isn’t it?

degree of the homicide and the other does involve a complete

it not?

That is correct, is

9
MR. DIEDRICK:

That is correct,

Your Honor, but

they both require the absence of elements in order to rebut
the presumption of unlawfulness and unlawfulness is an ele­
ment of homicide in North Carolina.
GUESTION:

Hut unlawfulness is an element of nan-

slaurrhter.
MR. DIEDRICK:
QUESTION:
defense.

That is correct, Your Honor.

There is no unlawfulness if it is self-

There is no unlawfulness if it is a killing in the

course of warfare or a leers 1 execution or by somebody who is
insane.

There is just no unlawfulness, correct?
MR. DIEDRICK:

That is correct, but by statutory

and by case law definition of homicide in North Carolina,
an

element

of it is not the leak of insanity,

whereas,

an

element of the offense in North Carolina is unlawfulness.
Therefore, I would arerne to you

that a judgment

of acquittal by virtue of a plea of self-defense.is a negative of a necessary element.

That is, the elements are both

malice and unlawfulness, not the lack of insanity.

That is

not an element and both of these address themselves to
defenses involving these elements and I would aroue to you
that the North Carolina court, in adopting Mullaney and
making it applicable to our law, properly did so because it
says that this element of unlawfulness used to be — it used
to not he inferred but. it was actually presumed, the use cf a

10
deadly weapon, and it was up to the defendant to rebut that
presumption throucrh self-defense and that the element of
malice was actually presumed from the use of a deadly weapon
and that this had to be rebutted by the defendant throucrh the
use of his defense of heat of sudden passion.
QUESTION;

Do you think the sudden passion point

is here at all?
MR. DIEDRICK:

Do I believe it was properly raised

by the facts?
QUESTION:

7vs I understand your Supreme Court on

that particular point, the

Court said as a matter of state

law there wasn’t any evidence

at all of the heat of passion

and so the issue wasn’t even before them.
MR. DIEDRICK:
way,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

1 didn't understand it to be that

I thought they held that —
It says as a matter of state law, "We

note that there is no evidence in this case of a killing in
the heal; of passion on sudden provocation, therefore, this
issue is not properly presented as it was in Mullaney.

There

could not consequently be any Mullaney error preiudicial to
the defendant on this aspect of the case."
MR. DIEDRICK:
QUESTION:

Well, I would —

Do you say that it is unconstitutional

for a court to demand at least that the defendant present
some evidence, at least present the issue?

11
MR. DIEDRICK;

We 11, I am arauinq that there was

that issue presenter? by the facts in this case.
QUESTION:
weren't.

Well, I know, but they ruled that they

Now, that is just —- what I am really asking you is,

suppose the Court was right here that the defendant had not
presented any evidence of it but that he had to or his heat
of passion defense would not be any good.

Would that be

MR. DIEDRICK:

I think it was,

decision said when you properly present it.

QUESTION:
point.

Mow, you are on the heat of passion

The only way it could properly be here is if we

disagreed with your Supreme
MR, DIEDRICK:

Court on the facts.

That is correct. Your Honor.

But I

would argue to the Court that that defense certainly should
be available or, actually not the defense, the lack of it
should be available when a knife is

put at somebody's throat.

That certainly should be fact sufficient from which heat of
passion could arise.
QUESTION:

Well, your Suprema Court did not think

so.
MR. DIEDRICK:

Well, I would

disagree with the

Supreme Court, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that the defendant does

12
not have to present any evidence of any kind with respect to
the heat of passion issue?
MR. DIEDRICK;

I would say that, if the state's

evidence in itself would present facts from which this could
arise.

Here, the main thrust of the state case was exculpa­

tory statements.
himself.

That is, statements made by the defendant

His confession, his statement of how the incident

occurred and his own statements brought forward, I would
argue the defense was self-defense and the absence or the
presence of a heat of passion, therefore, the absence of
malice which would require these to be properly submitted
to the jury.
Now, to answer your

question,

certainly there

could be instances, and there are many instances in which
these two things are not really at issue, that the facts
don't properly raise but certainly the state's evidence, not
only in this case, but in many cases, bring those forward.
QUESTION:

So you rely on the state's evidence,

not on any facts introduced on behalf of the defense?
MR. DIEDRICK:

I would rely on both but I would

say that the state's evidence in this case properly brought
forward both those issues.
QUESTION:

And you disagree with the finding of

the North Carolina court, as pointed out by Justice White.
MR. DIEDRICK:

Yes, I disagree because I think that

13
as I answered Justice White, that any time you have a factual
situation that shows a knife being put at somebody's throat,
certainly the offense of heat of passion could properly be
raised.
QUESTION:

If wa should agree with the finding of

the North Carolina Supreme Court, would the retroactivity
issue still remain in this case?
MR. DIEDRICK:

I would argue that it would because

of the self-defense.
QUESTION:

But we never held that Mu.Haney, cer­

tainly up until now, applied to self-defense.
MR. DIEDRICK:
same, if

I would say the language is the

it please the Court.

It is the negating of a

necessary element and in Mullaney itself, they spoke of the
fact that Maine had in the past placed the burden on the state
to prove the absence of self-defense from the evidence of
beyond a reasonable doubt of saying that the absence of the
heat of passion would be no greater burden.
QUESTION:

So your view is that the retroactivity

issue remains in any event?
MR. DIEDRICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think the main thing that I am trying to point
out is that when you talk about insanity or alibi or anything
like- that, you are not talking of elements.

You are not

speaking of elements of the offense, both malice and

14
unlawfulness ars elements of the offense of homoeida which
the state, by its charge in this case, placed the burden on
the defendant to satisfy the jury of the absence of and that
is why we would argue it was constitutionally prohibitive
and it would, of necessity, in light of Ivan and Winship,
have to substantially affect the fact-finding process and
therefore, should be given full retroactivity.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Hensey.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES M. HENSEY, ESQ.
v

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. HENSEY;

Mr. Chief Justice and raay it please

the Court:
The State of North Carolina, of course, is quite
concerned over the reach and scope of your decision in the
Mu Haney case.

The State of North Carolina feels that its

Supreme Court was essentially correct in its ruling on the
retroactivity portion of the Mu Haney opinion.

That is, the

state feels that the Mullaney opinion should not be applied
retroactively by this Court,
Now, the state recognises, of course, the rule that
when the primary purpose of the new constitutional doctrine
is to substantially improve the reliability of the factfinding process, that more often than not, you have held that
type of decision to be retroactive.

15
However, the State of Worth Carolina would argue in
this case that your Mu Haney decision, because it was, as we
say, on the fringes more or less, of the question of how much
proof is required in a criminal case and who has the burden
of persuasion and whatnot, that this decision and the changes
that it made in the rules relating to burden of proof on
affirmative defenses, has not wrought such a dramatic improve­
ment in the fact-finding process so as to require the auto­
matic retroactivity of this decision.
The state, of course, has cited the Court to
certain psychological studies in its brief concerning jury
perceptions in criminal cases and where, in many, many
instances, the juries have been quite reluctant to convict
and have a much higher standard of beyond a reasonable doubt
and have a much higher standard where self-defense is raised»
And of course, as this Court pointed out not too
long ago, in,the death penalty cases, that jury nullification
of death penalties or cases involving the death penalty in
many instances have brought about the change that society
recognizes now in the imposition of the death penalty.
The point I am trying to make, of course, is that
juries are very knowledgeable and very sensitive and are
quite perceptive and. the state feels that the changing of
the rules on the burden of persuasion by the Mu Haney case
has not significantly improved the fact-finding process.

IS
Therefore, the state feels that this Court can
quite legitimately and properly consider the other two fac­
tors of justified reliance on the part of the state and that
an impact that retroactivity would have on both, the State of
North Carolina and on other states similarly situated.
Of course, the State of North Carolina feels that
a retroactive application of Mullaney would have an almost
disastrous impact on North Carolina.
There are something over 1,000 people currently in
the North
tions,

Carolina prisons involving murder-type prosecu­

While perhaps not all of them would ultimately pre­

How in the world — I suppose it can be done but it
would be an extremely difficult, costly and time-consuming
process.
QUESTION:

This would involve all who were

18
convicted of second-degree murder and even all who were
convicted of manslaughter if a defense of self-defense had
been interposed,
MR. HENSEYs

That is my understanding, assuming

that this Court does not go off on the distinction that you
were making earlier about whether this was properly presented.
But assuming you adopt the North Carolina Court's
analysis —
QUESTIONS
MR, HENSEYs

Right.
— yes.

Now, as I understand it,

probably the first degree murder conviction would survive
because you have to prove the element of premeditation and
deliberation or the felony or whatnot beyond a reasonable
doubt but in the second degree case where either an involun­
tary manslaughter issue was presented or a self-defense issue
was presented and possibly if this Court should go so far as
to extend this doctrine into other areas such as entrapment
or whatnot, you know, and that type of defense was raised,
then possibly even there.
QUESTION:

Well, just within the meets and bounds

of the Supreme Court decision of North Carolina.
MR. HENSEY;
QUESTIONS

Right.

Right.

It would be every second degree murder

conviction in which an involuntary manslaughter defense
or mitigation was in issue.

19
MR. HENSEYs
QUESTION;

Right, right.
And also even every manslaughter con­

viction in which it is self-defense.

numbers.

It is self-defense •— was an issue.
Was an issue.

How many --

Sir, there is no way to identify these

The statistics kept by the prison department and

the records kept by the prison department simply do not
pen-flit identification of this.

They have, in the records,

v;hat is known as the prisoner's version of what happened but,
of course, this is not a transcript of the trial and the
only way I know of would be to get a transcript of every one
of those trials and. see what issues were presented.
QUESTION:
MR. HENSEY:

How many gross numbers are involved?
Well, we are talking about around

1,000 total.
QUESTION:
convictions.
MR. HENSEY:

That is second-degree and manslaughter
'
No, iriy recollection is that we are

talking around about 700 second-degree type, or below.

Now,

of course, some of these people might be out on parole,
obviously.
Now, query whether or not they would have a right
to raise this point.
What we are saying, though, is that it is going to

20

be a very expensive, difficult and time-consuming matter that
would have a devastating impact on the administration of
justice in the State of North Carolina.
QUESTION:

Your brief states that 722 inmates, as

of June 10, 1975, had been convicted of second-degree murder.
MR. HENSBY:
QUESTION:
MR. EENSEY;

Yes, Your Honor.
hncl you cite a North Carolina case.
Correct.

Well, that is what the North

Carolina Supreme Court in Hankerson identified.

Those were

the numbers that they identified.
QUESTION:

That is in addition to 269 inmates

convicted of first-degree murder.
MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION:
MR. HENSEY:

First degree, right.
They wouldn81 be a problem here.
Right.

I don't think we will have any

problems with the first degree people.

We are going to have

a lot of problems with the second-degree people and any time
a self-defense gets into the thing.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hensey, the state did not cross-

petition here, I take it.
MR. HENSEY:

No, sir, we did not.

We thought about

it and finally decided —
QUESTION:

I take it, then, the question of whether

Nxilianey reaches self-defense just is not open here.

Wall, I did not think it was open,

Justice White, until 1 heard the questions this morning.
QUESTION;

Well, you mean you didn't think you

ought — you must have thought Mu Haney covered, it?
MS. HENSEY;
QUESTION;

Well —
I am talking about a matter of juris­

diction and a matter of whether we may properly decide in
this case.
MR. HENSEY;

Are you talking about the fact that

voluntary manslaughter was not properly presented?
QUESTION;

Ho, I am not talking about that.

I am

talking about, the fact that your Supreme Court said that
MuHaney applied to self-defense.
MR. HENSEY;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
And you did not cross-petition challen­

ging that.
MR. HENSEY;

No, I didn't because first of all, I

was under the impression that I was bound by the interpreta­
tion of my court.

My court —

You mean, it is a matter of whether you

have the authority to attack your court?
MR. HENSEY;

Well, certainly our court held, as a

of state law that there was absolutely no distinction
“

;

between the burden of proof required for voluntary man>~
slaughter and the burden of proof required for self-defense
and in —

22
QUESTION:

Wall, I can understand why you might

not have,, but the fact — it seems to me that the question of
whether Mullaney covers self-defense in North Carolina, that
issue just is not here-

You didn!t petition raising it and

certainly your colleague did not.
MR. HEMS'EY:
QUESTION:

No, it —
And to support the judgment, you are

not entitled to present it, either, because that would give
you a bigger judgment than you get.
MR. HENSEY:

That is right.

And, quite frankly,

I just did not perceive this to be a problem until this
morning and I thought that by the interpretation of our state
court and, secondly, in the trial of Fankerson, a. manslaughter
issue was presented to the jury.
QUESTION:
MR. HENSEY:

Yes.
A manslaughter issue was presented,

a self-defense issue was presented.

Therefore, X thought, by

having both issues presented to the jury, by the Supreme
Court of North Carolina saying they are all the same and —
QUESTION:.

The applicability of Mu Haney to self-

defense may vary, depending on the state.
MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION:

It may very well..
And. you say here, the reason you thought

it was a closed issue was that your court ruled that selfdefense and provocation should be treated the same.

23
MR e HENSEY:
QUESTION :
MR. HENSEY2

Precisely.
In terras of the burden of proof.
Precisely.

The standard in North

Carolina? which is proof to the satisfaction of the jury? is
the same in both of these inatters and our state court has so
held and as 1 understood? the major question? of course? was
retroactivity.

The ancillary question that I had raised in

my brief is that perhaps the Mullaney rules do not even apply
to North Carolina at all? that perhaps the satisfaction of
the jury test means something less than the preponderance of
the evidence test.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hensey? on that point? weren't you

arguing the same thing that the concurring opinion argued at
length?
MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION:
majority

That is correct.
And don't we have to interpret the

as having rejected that?
MR. HENSEY:

Yes? sir.

And? of course? I recog­

nise that in my brief that I may very well be foreclosed from
this argument.
QUESTION;

Because that is a North Carolina law

question.
MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Well? the North Carolina Supreme Court,

the majority? was holding what it understood the Federal

24
Constitution to require under the Mu Haney case.

laws and the Fourteenth Amendment required in the light of

MS. HENSEY:

Precisely.

It was not deciding a question of

what satisfaction of the jury means in terms of North
Carolina law.
QUESTION:

And, since it affirmed the conviction in

this case, you are entitled to make any argument you want in
upholding that decision to affirm this conviction.
MR. HENSEY:

Well, that was my feeling, Justice

Brennan and that is why I mad® the argument, of course.

Is it not correct that the Court decided a

malice in — I quess it is the Morgan tradition, that, really,
what North Carolina has is more of an evidentiary inference
of malice, that when certain things are shown, you know, then

26

the inference of malice arisen and the protection burden then
is shifted on the defendant to come- forward and present
evidence.
OUEETION:
question.

General Hensey, let. me ask you one other

Do you arrree with your opponent that the heat of

passion element is, in fact presented by this record under
the manslaughter part of it as opposed to the self-defense
issue?
HR. HENLEY:

Well, certainly, up until about 15 or

20 minutes ac?o, that was my

understanding of the posture of

the case.
OTJEsmiON:

And that the evidence of the knife at

the throat, would be sufficient to raise that phase of the

ease as well as the self-defense.
HR. HENGEY:

Yes, certainly it is my feelinq that

there was some evidence in the case and of course, North
Carolina does require that there be evidence in the case
before the judge instruct.
QUESTION;

Well, what do you do with what your

Supreme Court says?
UR. HENSPY:
QUESTION;

That it was not properly presented?
when there wasn't any evidence.

You

heard the passage I read.
HR. HENSEY:

Yes.

Yes.

Well, T don't know quite

what X would do with it but it is my feelino that the issue

27
is here», that, as I pointed out earlier, that similarity,
nay, the identity of the rules of law and the standards and
the burdens in North Carolina, T feel like get this issue up
here.
Certainly, the trial judge thought it was there.
He instructed that jury and I take it that jury could have
returned a verdict of voluntary manslaughter under the ins­
tructions in this case.
QUESTION:

What page of the Appendix are we talkincr

about, that the North Carolina
MR. TIENSEY:
QUESTION:

Supreme Court said it was, 33?

Thirty-three, I believe.
Thirty-three, the first full paragraph.

while Mr. Justice Stewart is lookincr at the Appen­
dix, how do you make the judgment disagree with your court
on this issue and accept the judgment of your court on other
issues?
MR. HENSEY:

Well, for one thing, on this issue

that I am disagreeing with, it seemed like to me that the
court was applying a federal principle that only you could
ultimately decide the scope of.
QUESTION:
MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION:
you said,

May I interrupt you right there?
Yes, sir.
The sentence Mr. Justice White read to

'We note there is no evidence in this case of a

killing in the heat of passion."

That is hardly a federal

28
question, is it?
MR. HENSEY:

No, it is not anti it is there and the

only thing I ear. tell you is —
QUESTION:

That you disagree with it.

MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION;

That I disagree with it.
You are representing the stats.

MR. HENSEY:

Yes, sir, and I feel like that I have

to make the best argument that I can.
QUESTION:

Well, you are entitled to that.

MR. HENSEY:

To conclude and summarise:

The state

is most concerned about the potential retroactive application
of your Mullaney case.

This is what we are most gravely

concerned about and if this Court could somehow

way clear to limit the retroactivity

find its

of Mullaney, the State

of North Carolina would be very, very happy because, by
Hankerson, hopefully, we have cleaned up whatever Federal
Constitutional error might have been present in our rules
before.
QUESTION:
MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION:
MR. HENSEY:

But you draw the line.
On what, sir, retroactivity?
Retroactivity.
Of course, I would draw the line as of

the date the decision was handed down and I realize this is
a source of great controversy and if you draw the line at
varying dates, I would say that any case that was tried to a

30
conclusion prior to the date of Muilaney should be allowed to

repair!.
QUESTION:

I would think that North Carolina would

even be happier and would be more interested in urging that
Mu Haney didn’t apply at all in this case.
MR. HENSEY:

Well, this was going to be my next

argument and by way of summary that, obviously, the milienium
as far as I would be concerned here today would be for youall to hold that Mu Haney never applied to North Carolina „
QUESTION:

But when you take that position without

a cross-petition —
MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION:

MR. HENSFY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, without a cross«petition.
You can take it, you think.

Well —
You are arguing to the Court of the

affirmance of this conviction, aren’t you?
MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION:

That is exactly what

I

am arguing.

No, you are attacking the holding of

your court.
MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION:

Well, the only thing —*
You are not trying to support the

judgment, you are attacking it.
MR. HENSEY:

Well, all I am saying is that the

Court may very well have misperceived and construed the sweep
of your opinion in Mullaney, Mr. Justice Blackmun and I

31
understand it only you can say with finality that the sweep
of your opinion — it possibly may apply to North Carolina.
As a representative of the state, I feel like it
did not.

I feel like our Court painted with too broad a

brush with your Mullaney decision and I feel like this is
something that is legitimate that this Court should consider
when it decides this particular case.
QUESTION:

General Hensey, what really is the

difference between —* as a matter of legal principle —between the heat of passion argument and the self-defense
argument?

What is the argument you are making for us to draw

a distinction, if we do reach it?
MR. HENSEY:

I can't see that there is any dis­

tinction myself.
QUESTION:

You really aren't making a very powerful

argument.
MR. HENSEY:

I'm sorry, sir, I misunderstood your

question.
QUESTION:

The question is, if you were permitted

to argue that there should be a distinction drawn between
self-defense and heat of passion for Mullaney purposes, then
I would say, well, what is the argument, and I thought you
said, "I don’t have an argument."
MR. HENSEY:

Well, I'm sorry, sir.

I thought you

were talking about in terms of state law concerning the

32
burden of proof on those two affirmative defenses»

ha I

understand it as a matter of state lav?, there is no differ­
ence between the two insofar as the burden of proof.
QUESTION;

But what is the difference as a matter

of Federal Constitutional lax? that you x?ould urge us to
consider?
HR. HENSEY:

Between self-defense and heat of

passion.
QUESTION:

when the burden as a matter of state law

is identical with respect to both of those matters.
MR. HENSEY:

Well, I would argue that insofar as

North Carolina is concerned, where the burden is to the
satisfaction of the jury on both of those affirmative
defenses, that satisfying the jury does not mean convincing
by a preponderance of the evidence.
QUESTION:

I understand, but that argument applies

equally to heat of passion and to self-defense.
MR. HENSEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Is there any principal reason for

distinguishing between heat of passion and self-defense as a
matter of Federal Constitutional lax??
The North Carolina Supreme Court saw none and
Hr. Justice Wright, in effect, has raised the question, well,
maybe there is one that we have not discussed.
HR. HENSEY:

hnd that is what I thought you were

33
asking awhile ago, sir, and my answer is tht I don't see any
distinction, e.1 ther.
QUESTION:

That is what I thought you said,

QUESTION:

Well, what is the difference between

self-defense and insanity as an affirmative defense?
MR. HENSEY:

Well, of course, self-defense goes to

the unlawfulness issue.
QUESTION:

It goes to whether or not a criminal

homicide has been committed at all.
MR. HENSEY:

It goes to the Mandrea element or to

the malice element.
QUESTION:

Well, each one of them goes to the basic

question of whether or not a criminal homicide has been
committed, does it

not,

MR. HENSEY:
One excuses

at all?
Yes, sir, it does.

It does.

because of the. mental condition.

The other excuses because of the threat to the bodily harm.
QUESTION:
MR. HENSEY:

Well, it is a justification.
Well,“'it is a justification but it is

not unlawful, is what you are saying, when it is self-defense.
I, quite frankly, can see no distinction but you
do have, of course, your Lei and case which was a strange
procedural animal in that the state had to find the man
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and then he had to come in
a;d prove himself insane beyond a reasonable doubt and, of

34

course, as I recall the opinion, you said that was all right
under those circimstances and of course, Oregon has long
since done away with that procedure, to my knowledge.
QUESTION:

But there are many, many cases — states

in which insanity remains an affirmative offense to be
pleaded and proved by the defendant.
MR. HENSEY:

Right.

One problem is, of course,

looking at the text writers, is that there seems to be some
question, number one, as to what an affirmative defense is,
what do you categorise as that?
And then, of course, there are all grades and
shades of proof once you decide the thing is an affirmative
defense and I can’t give you a rational distinction between,
let

us say, the

insanity problem and the heat, of passion or

self-defense problem except to say that it is there and
apparently this Court at one time or. another has made those
distinctions.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Diedrick?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. DIEDRXCK, ESQ.
MR. DIEDRXCK:

If it please the Court:

I just wanted to reply in rebuttal to his argument
with reference to the severe impact that it would have on the
administration of justice.

35
Now, I do not have available to me any statistics
of any state except

for North Carolina, which are present in

his brief and which our Court addressed itself to»
However, I think these statistics are unmeaningful
without some type of guidance as to the number of those which
are pleas, the number of those which are pleas of not guilty,
the number of those which are actually first-degree con­
victions, which are second-degree convictions, which are
manslaughter convictions because •—
QUESTION3

Well, he has separated the first-degree,

I thought, from the second-degree and the manslaughter.
MR. DIEDRXCK;

Ism not — I

understood that he

had but I was saying that I think that before you can answer
that question, you have to make that determination, having
all of that criteria available to you and, most importantly,
which ones were upon please of not guilty and which ones were
pleas of guilty.
QUESTION;

Well, somebody who pleaded guilty would

i
have pleaded guilty with the knowledge and/or the,
.

advice of

s lawyer as to what the then-state of the North Carolina

Ihw was and he could certainly collaterally attack that guilty
plea, couldn't he, if this were made retroactive?
Because now the law has been changed and he might
well — well, he could probably say. he would never have
pleaded guilty if it had been incumbent upon the state to

36
prove these things rather than upon himself.
MR. DIEDRICK:

But if that defense of self-defense

was available to him,, 1 would argue to you that whether under
the state law it was then affirmative defense with the
burden upon him or whether

it was not an affirmative defense,

that, yes, he would have had to consult with counsel and made
the determination of whether or not that defense was avail­
able to him but I would argue to you that the plea of guilty
a waiver of that.
QUESTION:

Well, that is undoubtedly what the

state would argue, but there is certainly an argument on the
other side,

isn't there?

MR. DIEDRICK:
QUESTION:

There could be, yes, Your Honor.

Even attacking a guilty plea.

MR. DIEDRICK:

There could be.

But the thing I

really would argue is this, if you take a factual situation
like my case, the case at the Bar, in which all of the
evidence is primarily exculpatory evidence which is statements
of the defendant wherein he clearly brought forward lack of
malice on his part, I would argue, in which he clear'ly
brought forward lack of unlawfulness because of the defense
of self-defensa.
Reviewing all of the facts and circumstances in the
case and weighing everything equally, I certainly argue to
the Court that the charge of the Court in this case

37
substantially affected the fact-finding process and if there
are these 728 other cases, three or four or ten which would
have properly brought this forward, then it makes no differ­
ence how severe an impact it would have on the administration

of justice, it should be done because I would argue to you,
these people were unconstitutionally convicted, that they did
not receive a fair trial, that they were placed where they
had a constitutionally prohibitive burden placed upon them
and regardless of the severe impact, it should be made
available to them.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE RTJRGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:50 o'clock a.m., the case
was gubmitted.]
