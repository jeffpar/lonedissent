MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will

Labor Relations Board.
Mr. Levenson, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN J. LEVENSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEVENSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please th© Court:
My name is Alan Lev®nson.

I am from Portland, Maine.

here today representing Bayside Enterprises, Inc.

I am

Bayside

is a poultry industry located in Waldo County, up near
Belfast, Main®.
The contention of Bayside — and this involves six
feed drivers, that drive poultry trucks, which ars the specialised
trucks that deliver grain.

These poultry drivers are exempt

from the National Labor Relations Act as exgricultural
laborers.

The National Labor Relations Act. ; on agricultural

laborers makes reference to, because of an act of Congress
in 1946 in the Appropriations Act, makes reference to
of fixe Fair Labor Standards Act.

3:(£)

In my brief I have set out

3(f) and all of this discussion today —- it’s on 'page 3 —
revolves around 3(f).
Now, this 3(f) has hs©n discussed many times before

4
before this Court, particularly in Farmers Agricultural
Company, and what it says is that to be exempt, you have to
either fall into th® primary classification or secondary
classification of farming.
Mow, in the poultry industry, it makes specific
reference to th© question of raising poultry.

So when I talk

about the primary definition of agriculture here, I will b©
talking about raising poultry.
Th© secondary definition talks about incidental to
or in conjunction with farming when performed by a farmer
or on a farm.

So I will have to be talking about farmer or

on a farm and incidental to or in conjunction with farming.
There is also a phrase "preparation for market,"
which is in 3(f), which also has some consideration in some
t

courts that hinge the exemption on that point.
The outline of my argument is that Bayside itself,
being a vertically integrated poultry organization, comes
within the definition of primary agriculture, because it is a
producer, and that the feed delivery drivers are within the
secondary definition of agriculture because of their work
being incidental to and in conjunction with farming.
I will also talk in terms of a possible alternative
argument that th© feed poultry drivers are "oji the farm" -within,
th® meaning of those words.
To summarize the arguments, th© choice hare, th©

5

feed poultry drivers ar® either (1) directly involved in
fanning,

(2) incidental to or connected with fanning, or (3)

not connected with fanning at>all.

And I will be talking about

the first two choices and leave th® third choice to my opponent.
Briefly I would like to talk to you about the facts
in th© case and just a lifctl© bit of sketch about the poultry
industry.
Baysid© is a single enterprise.
markets poultry up in Waldo County, Maine.

It produces and
Although there are

two corporations, there is a central management which makes
all the decisions of the poultry company, from, as one could
call it, from th© cradle to the grave of raising poultry.
The company is made up of several components.

Besides the

main office there is a breeding hatchary with several farms
connected to it, a commercial hatchery with 11 farms connected
to it, there is a feed mill, there is th® feed delivery
operation, which wa are talking about her©, there ar© 119 contract
farms, which I will go into th© contract a little later.
Baysid® itself owns seven farms.

There is a processing plant

for trucks to pick up the poultry from th© farms and deliver
it to th® processing plant.
Briefly this is how it works out:

Th® company has

a geneticist who makes the decisions as to what type of poultry
it should grow.

They are very successful because they

have reduced th® time it takes to grow a broiler from 16 weeks

6

to about

9 weeks.

They make such decisions as how to grow

a chicken with white meat, or how to speed up its maturity» and
things like that.

It is a very valuable integral part of the

business of raising chickens.
After they d@cid© that, then -they breed flocks to
produce the aggs.

Then they take the eggs and they hatch

them until they are on® day old.

Then they

put these ons-day-

old broilers on these contract - farms.
While they are doing that, they have a feed mill and
they ar© making feed for the broilers which changes according
to age.

They change it at least, four times and if the flock

is unhealthy, they may change it more times than that.
Than they have this feed delivery system which I
will talk about later which delivers the feed from the feed
mill to the contract farms.

Then while the poultry is on the

farms and the poultry stays on the farras for about nine weeks,
when they take it off, they have these feed crews that go onto
the farm and they

vaccinate, blood test, debeak, and all the

things that you do to keep up the health and well-being of the
poultry.
After the flock leaves, the farm crews go and clean
the poultry farms of the contract farmers.

While this is all

going on, and this is all being directed by a broiler departin'
manager who directs and supervises the farmers, and then there
is a farm crew.

He decides what age to market the flock and

7
what sis© the birds are marketable, and than he sends out the
craw from the processing plant who catches, coops, and loads the
birds

for transport to the processing plant.
The processing plant processes the birds and markets

them to a dealer or chain, soma

intermediate third party.

All of this that Bayside is doing is typical of what
is going on in the poultry industry.

It's a typical integrated

The otter point I would like to mate is that nearly
all the broilers today are produced by integrated broiler
firms, and this development has gradually arisen.

What used

to happen in the past, they used' to ha limited to processing
plants and individual feed mills and individual delivery

systains.

And as th© poultry Industry gradually developed,

each of these firms developed so that gradually they became
a concentration, so that each on© of these took in all th©
attributes of one firm.

What I am saying is that basically

there are four elements, I mean, big substantial components
of this type of vertical integrator.

They are th© feed mill,

the processing plant, th© hatcheries, and the producers, 'the
contract growers.

And gradually they all cam© together under

one management, and basically they are all interdependent on
each other.

And th© management -- it’s kind of like a bundle

of sticks, and they are all held together, and th© thing that
holds them together is the management that is making all the
decisions as to what is going to happen.
As a result, of this development, the fact that is
important to me, it seems, is that there is really no
significant live broiler market today.
raise chickens and sell them to anyone.

You can't go out and
All these farmers

are connected to soma type of broiler organisation.

Wow, that

becomes critical when I talk about the part of the processing
plant to this whole operation.

They are all marketed as

ready-to-cook broilers by an integrated company.
;

Th© argument of Bayside is that because of this type

of operation, it is Bayside and vertically integrated operators
like Bayside

that are in effect the producers within the

contemplation of the

statutes.

They are "the farmers.

And

9

basically that argument -breaks down into four elements.
First of all, the company is the on© that initiates
the production process, it’s the on© that invests in both
production and marketing of poultry, it's the on© that control:
all the marketing and production of poultry, and, fourthly,
it9s the on© that actively participates in the management of
the flock and the poultry husbandry.
Now, this position is sustained by two major
cases in the poultry industry, and one is Tyson8s Poultry
and on© is N.L.R.B. y. Strain.

Thar© are other cases that

sustain my position, but the rationale is set out in those
two cases.

Tyson.

was an egg producer and Strain was a

chicken poultry farmer like this one.
Th« contrary argument is that it* s the contract
farmers that: are raising the poultry and that they should be
considered the farmers.

That has a ring of simplicity in it

because the chickens are on the contract, farms.

When the

Court in Strain took this undor consideration, they framed
the issue this way:

Does the fact that the integrator uses

independent growers destroy his claim to having raised the
birds, or is the integrator more akin to the purchaser of the
bird?

The Court then reviewed the same factual type of

situation that 1 have described and said,

even -.though the

raising of the birds wire shared with independent growers,
Strain* s activities wer© more nearly that of on® engaged in

10

raising poultry than a purchaser or a jobber.
Whsn. Tyson took, up the sams situation»- it said,
w@ are here concerned with a single completely integrated
farming operation.

Tyson .is the farmers and they are the ones

who initiated the farming operation herein involved.

Without

the appellees (that’s Tyson), th© independent growers
arguably would never have undertaken the initial and continuing
costs of acquiring the birds and producing the eggs.

Th®

contract growers merely aid th© appellees who are the farmers.
So the issue drawn is:
a middle man?

Is a company like Bayside

Is it somebody that is kind of buying the

chickens from the farms?

Is it somebody who is a purchaser,

a distributor, or something like that?

Th© argument has been

made many times, and the rationale in Strain where they
talked about a rosebush case, they said no it wasn’t — I
mean,the rosebush case that they cited was more of a middle
man because they were buying it, they were only buying things
that were marketable, or a purchaser, or something like that.
Well, all of this gats down to the core of the
question, or what some people feel is ths cor®, is the risk
of loss.

Who is taking th© risk of this type of operation

between the farmers on th© farm and the vertical integrator
that is supervising and all of this?
contract itself.

Well, that involves the

The contract guarantees th® farmer a

11

specific rate par week depending upon the size of the house.
He then gives it an additional bonus depending on his production
as compared to other Baysid© contract fanners.

Bear in mind

that Bayside owns the flock at all times, and that chickens
are a perishable commodity.
The point I would Ilk© to make is that the payments
to the grower have no relationship to the market price that
Bayside eventually gets from it.

Whatever happens, the farmer

gets a certain guaranteed payment and then b@ does participate
in a bonus depending upon anybody els®.

Now, this can work

out several ways, because bear in mind -there are two markets
involved.

One is the feed market, the grain that you have

■co buy, and th© other is the process market that you have to
sell.

It is quit© conceivable that the man who is th© farmer

can receive a profit from his operation and then that sane
chicken can go out and be processed and sent
the vertical integrator can lose money.

to market, and

And th© reason for that

is because th© cost of grain can be more expensive than th®
cost of 'sailing th© bird.

It seems to me that is somewhat

critical.
Now, in th.© discussion of this at the trial level
we talked a lot about who had th© risk of loss.
to prove that w@ had all th© risk of loss.

I was trying

But there is no

question, it seems to me, -that, some of th© risk of loss, if a
man is employing other people, he would invest some money, so

12

h© would make less money than ha would otherwise.

But there is

a case on. this, as has been pointed out to me, about ducks
in the Tax Court, and it's called Maple Leaf Farms at 64, 438

And what. they say there is ‘that the risk is really
In other words, a man who .is a farmer in this type of

situation with a contract can really gauge the kind of loss h©
is going to — you know, if there is going to bs a loss, he
can kind of gauge what kind of money h© is going to get in
advance, while the person -who is tha vertical integrator has
to deal with markets that are unweildy, you never know what you
are going to get.

And -that is a critical fact in talking about

who is really running the farm and who isn't running the farm.

They cite also another case

If you just tarn to the appendix of the petition
for certiorari, you will find the contract itself, what w@ are
talking about.
Under the pamphlet that th© Government was kind
enough to provide us, entitled "Tlx© Maine Poultry Industry,"
on pug® 13 they say that this type? of contract, is called a
straight payxr.ant typ* contract rather than a share-the-profit
type.

Evidently the Southern growers have a shara-the-profit

type, and -idle Main® people have a straight payment type.
I don't rely cn that to say that th© Southern growers
aren't integrated? I am just saying there, is a slight
difference between the two.

MR. LEVENSON:
QUESTION:

You just don't use him next time.

You get another contractor next time.

MR. LEVENSON:

Talking about this contract that I

have before you# I would like to point out to you that the
integrator provides the chicks, tha feed, the medication, the
fuel, and 'tha litter.
Now, tha significance of providing the chicks in
this case, it seems to me, is vary important because you can
easily see it if you had an egg business because then the
product would b© the egg and you are giving the farmer a
chicken and out you come with an egg.

But what you ar®

getting here is you are getting the meat itself.

So that

the product really isn't the chicken? it's the meat.

The

significance of that is it's equivalent to giving a corn farmer
40 acres of land and say go rais© corn, because -fch© product

'tr...

16

will ultimately become corn.

Here we ar® giving them a

chicken and saying go raise meat, and you will get ultimately
processed meat.
What. I am saying is it isn't just th® ownership of
the bird

that's important in this relationship.

I think it8s

very important the fact that the product is th® meat itself.
As part of 'this contract, on A-2S of this, th©
grower under 1.) agrees to follow the instructions of the
Bayside supervisor in the case and th© maintenance of the flocks.
QUESTION s What ar© you reading from now?
MR. LEVENSON:
QUESTION:

It*S on page A-26 - 10.) —

Thank you.

MR. LEVER'S ON s

— of the same contract.

In other

words, when we talk about the grower1's obligation, that grower
obligates himself by contract to follow th© instruction of the
Bayside suparvisor in the care and management, of th© flocks.
On A-27, he also agrees to allow Bayside to move
the flocks from th© farm at any time.

That is No. 11.).

Back to A-26 on 4.), that contract farmer agrees to
have no poultry other than Bay side’s on th© farm during -th©
period of this contract.

So he is restricted; h© can't have

anybody ©Is©3s poultry except Bayside’s.

And he guarantees to

use only those materials supplied by Bayside for the purpose
of feeding and maintenance of birds under this contract.
My point, is that this is another disability when a

17
grower enters into this contract with the integrator that he
undertakes.

Now,- the point is that the grower himself, if you

look at the grower's position in this, h® isn't the type of
typical independent producer.

II© does not. own th© feed, h©

does not purchase or own the chicks, he doss not decide what
type of birds h© wants to grow or what type of feed h© wants
to feed them, he doss not. decide when to market th® flocks,
h« does not receive a market price when th© flock is taken,
he has no obligation to transport the feed to th© farm nor
catch, coop, and deliver th© mature birds to th© processing
plant.

He must follow

the directions of th© Bayside Broiler

Department manager, field supervisors and farm crows, and he
doss not vaccinate, blood test, d@b©ak, and h@ bears only a
secondary responsibility for th© health of th© flock and
treatment if it's sick.

doing.
The other part of this argument that the First
Circuit was particularly attracted to was the processing plant.
They seam to take the position that because so many people
ar® in processing, thereby the whole ‘thing t,sites on a commercial

Mow, the answer to that argument, it seems to me, is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HARRIET S. SHAPIRO
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25
MRSo SHAPIRO:
the Court:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case requires this Court to interpret the

agricultural exemption to the National Labor Illations Act.
That exemption is set out on page 2 of our brief, and it
involves three separata categories.
.First, • it exempts actual faming operations, including
the raising of poultry.
Second, it also exempts other activities by a farmer
that are incidental to his farm operation.
And third it exempts activities which are on a
farm and incidental to that farm's operations.
QUESTION:

If a chicken farmer owned a truck and

sent a truck over to a feed mill owned by somebody else and
hauled feed back, that would be incidental to farming, I
suppose, wouldn't it?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes, it probably would.

Petitioner’s claim is that the truck drivers here
that take the feed from petitioner’s feed mill to the grow-out
.2

farms ar© exempt under the second part of the definition.
That is that they are activities by a farmer which are
incidental to the operation of that farm.
So to support his claim, petitioner must show first
that Baysid© is a farmer, and, second, that the work of the
feed truck drivers is incidental to Baysida's farm operation.
So in response to Mr. Justice White's question, it wouldn't be

26

enough for this Court, to decide, contrary to our position,
that Daysido as a whole is a farmer in relation to its growers.
It also would have to decide whether th© feed mill operation
was an incident to 'that farming, and we would still have
another question if you decided the-feed mill operation was
not incident to the farming, the question would b© whether th®
truer driver’s work was incident to the feed mill or to the
farm.
QUESTION:
question if

I don‘t suppose there would b@ any

Baysid® owned the farms and raised the chickens

themselves.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

No.

As a matter of fact. Baysid©

does own certain — they do own the hatcheries and the breeder
farms, and tha peoples that ar® working on those farms are
within th© primary —
QUESTION:

And .if they had some truck drivers

running back and forth between their plant and those particular
farms -MRS. SHAPIRO:

Ho, then in that situation you would

have to decide whether the truck drivers war© incidental to
th© feed mill operation or to th© farm op®ration.
QUESTION:

I thought you had already said that he. .

is a farmer that owns the truck' that goes to tha feed mill.
MRS.SHAPIRO:

Yes.

But your hypothetical, I -thought,

was that if the feed mill truck was —

QUESTIONS

You mean, if a farmer sends his truck to

an independent, feed mill, his truck drivers are exempt, but
if he happens to own th© feed mill —
MRS. SHAPIROs
QUESTION:
with this.

You have to get back to the statute.

Mrs. Shapiro, let me add a question along

Wliafe is it in the statute that requires or permits

even a compartmentalization that you insist on, that you have
to say in its capacity as a feed mill operator and then in
its capacity as a breeder fanner, and that sort of thing.
MRS. SHAPIRO;

I think it3s a necessary implication

in the statute because the statute sets up these various
categories.

This first is primary farming, and second th©

statute recognizes that a farmer has incidental operations
and also may have non*"incidental operations.
says

That is why it

incidental farm operations ara within th© agricultural

exemption, but non-incidental farm operations are not.

So

you have got to compartmentalize.
QUESTION %
regulations,

Your analysis has the ring of a set of

hr# there any regulations that comport, these

compartments that you hav© mad©?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

What we are talking about is an

exemption that, is brought into th© National Labor Relations
Act but by the Appropriations Acts which say that this definition
in the Fai.r Labor Standards Act is to be used in th© National
Labor Relations Act.

28
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro, the wording of the 1938

Act, Pair Labor Standards Act, hasn’t changed, has it?

Isn't

it tii© same as it was originally?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTIONs

Y©s.

But th© Appropriations Acte ^incorporated

in tii© National Labor Relations Act. the fair labor standards,
don't they?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And do the regulations tale® into account

at all th@3@ differences in methods of faming?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

Well, th© Fair Labor Standards Act,

the regulations that I am referring to arc® under the Fair
Labor Standards Act.
QUESTION:

I

appreciate that.

th© words “agricultural employees0 for the purposes of th©

MRS. SHAPIRO:

That is certainly th© way th©

National Labor Relations Board interprets it.

QUESTION:

Bo the regulations address themselves to

this form of farming operations?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

They certainly do.

29

QUESTION 2

Directly.

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

W® refer to them in our brief.

Arid th© Labor Department feels that companies like Bays id©
ar® not to be considered farmers for tha purposes of the
Pair Labor Standards Act.
QUESTION:

And the Board follows: that?

HRS. SHAPIRO:

The Board follows that interpretation,

The only other point about the question that Mr'.
Justice White raised before lunch is that if this Court
should agree® that Bay side's relationships with its grow-out
farmers make it a farmer, than neither the Board nor the
court below saw the case that way.

So that they didn't reach

the question that you would have to reach then about whether
tha operations of the truck drivers were incidental to the
farm operation as thus defined, and it would probably be
appropriate to send the case back) for consideration of that
qu@st.ion.
• Our primary argument is that. Bay side as a whole is
not a farmer.

Instead, it is a complex, integrated company

that, contracts • with farmers.

It does run a limited farming

operation itself, the hatcheries and the breeder farms, and
.it doss have some purely industrial operations.
QUESTIONs

Insofar as it does run that limited

farming operation: itself, you concede that the employees
engaged in that activity are exempt.

30

■MBS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

I certainly do.

As agricultural works» rs.

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

Th© f@®& mill is, in our "/lew, one of th® industrial
operations, and the work of th© £@®d mill truck drivers is
incidental to that operation.

That is why we believe they are

not within th© agricultural exemption.
QUESTION:

Does the feed mill sell to anybody except

Bayside people?
MRS. SNAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes.

It sells commercially to p@opl© with

no connection with -MRS. SHAPIRO:

It sells to a group of farmers who

doesn't, have its own processing plant.

MRS. S HAP RIO:

Independent of Bayside.

That was at til© time of th© Board

X think that Bayside*3 brisf says that they no

longer do.
QUESTION:

It seems to m© I recall something in th®

papers to th® effect that that has been dona away with now.
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

I think that's correct.

Mrs. Shapiro, if your opponant is right

31
on what is a farm, and if you are right on the point that the
drivers aro incidental to the feed mill operation, what
employees would w© be fighting about?
MBS. SHAPIROs

You would still have to decide in that

case whether the feed mill operation is incidental to Bayside*s
farm operation.

We would still ba fighting about tha truck

drivers.
QUESTION;

Oh, I see.

But if the feed mill operation

is incidental to a farm, would it than follow the driver’s
war© engaged in work incidental to farming?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

If you fait that Baysid® was a

farmer.
Th© second part of tha definition, which is what w©
really are arguing about here, says, to get into that exemption
you have to both work —* the activity has to fo© by a farmer
and also it has to b® incidental to that farmer's farm
operation.
QUESTION:
differently.

May I ask the question just a little

If we concluded that th® feed mill was an

industrial operation and apt incidental to farming, but if
the growing was farming by Baysid©, would there b® any
employees we would be fighting about

other than these drivers?

Is th® whole point just over these drivers or are other
employees involved in any way?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

This particular fight is ovsr these

32

drivers.

I suppose if you took Bay side's argument that, they

are as a whole an agricultural enterprise, th@ next case you
would have would b® the feed mill employees, the processing
plant employees, and then you would have to decide whether the
processing plant was incidental.

If you accept their argument,

you do have to decide whether the feed mill is incidental
in relation to them.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro, the regulation to which you

referred at page 18 of your brief, 780.126, that description
goes

back to 1961,

bulletin?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes, I think it doe's.

Bay side's

claim is that they ara not a feed dealer and processor and
■that the first statement limits the description.

certainly do produce feed and they do process, and the
description of the typical kind cf an operation that's in the
body of this regulation fits exactly what Bayside has don®.

ramembar we didn't get these briefs until just the oth©r day
so I haven't had a chance to study them thoroughly as I would
like. What I am trying to find out is has that actual regulation

Because

you raaka an argument that 'diis is entitled to great weight in

with administering the statute.

What is unique about this is

that -diis interpretive bulletin is not a National Labor
Relations Board bulletin.
bulletin.

It's th© Wag© and Hour Division

So my question is has the Board applied this

regulation in any other cases?
MRS. SHAPIRO;
QUESTION:

They hav® don® so consistently.

Are they cited in your brief?

MRS. SHAPIRO:

Yes, at footnote 11.

Our argument basically is that the growers are the
farmers and Baysid® is not.

Our brief examines the terras of

Bay side's agreements with the grower's to show why in our view
tfa© growers are independent farmers in terms of the risks
they bear and the capital investments required and the typ©
of supervision they receive.
Again, I think the practical answer to Mr. Justice
White's question is teat on© of tee reasons for this arrangement
is that it doss permit Bayside to sham the risk.

It also

34
avoids Bayside having to have the capital investments/ which
are very substantial.
QUESTIONs

And it avoids having to treat them as

employees.
MRS. SHAPIRO:

How, the statute exempts -things that
Now, why wouldn’t getting feed — what

could be more integral to the operation of growing chickens
than feeding them?

You aren't going to grow many chickens

unless you feed them.

So why wouldn* t you say that hauling

your feed to your chickens is part of farming, not incidental,
just part, of farming?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

The answer to that — in the

Farmers' Irrigation Co, case that interpreted this same
language, the situation there was that there was an association
of farmers that provided water to irrigate the individual
farmers* crops.

And the argument there was mad®, as you say,

water is essential to growing crops.
unless you hav® water.

How, suppose thi© farmer who instead of

hiring his own employees to feed th© chickens for him contracts!
with a chicken feeder and they say they are employees then

Th® Court said that in several cases.

Well, the kind of control that Baysid®
On© of the reasons for that',' which

we didn't emphasize in our brief, but I think is really quite
important, is that if you look at the tarns of the agreement
between Bavsid© and its farmers. Baysid© has set up very
specific-specifications about the product.

It provides the

product, and it indicates how they want th© product grown.
it says nothing about th© labor sid® of it.

But

It dc@sn't say

anything about wages; it doesn't say anything about hours,
it doesn't say anything about fringe benefits.

It doesn't

say anything about the types of unsatisfactory performance
that arc© going to lead to a termination of th© relationship,
although it apparently contemplates 'that the farmers ara going

$

40
to hira ©mployeas, it doesn't say any tiling about the conditions
QUESTIONS

Doesn't that suggest almost a lessor-*

lessee relationship that you are asking for a certain
property and certain conditions from th© lessor, and you
don't car® how he goes about providing it?
MRS. SHAPIROs

That is precisely what it suggests,

and the reason I think that's important is because what the
National Labor Relations Act exemptions are concerned with is
that the farmer should be fr©s to set -fell© conditions of
employment of his workers without complying with the National
Labor Relations Act.

And thatEs just what Baysid© is not

doing.
QUESTION:

But if it is a lessor-less©© relationship,

doesn’t that strengthen Bayside's claim that it rather than
tbs contract, farmers is doing the farming.

If Bayside had

simply leased land from these same contract farmers and agreed
to pay them at the same way for their land, clearly Baysid©
would, be doing that farming, wouldn't it?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

If they had employees that were doing
i

the farming, but they don't.
requirements contract.

What 'they have is basically a

They hav© set. fairly specific

specifications for the product; they hav© supplied raw
materials; they say tills is the way we want those raw materials
put together, and we will pay you for the results of your
efforts.

Bui; how you put the product together, whether you

41
hire people to do it, and if you do, under what terns you
hire', people to do it, that*s of no concern to us.

And it's

on the basis of that kind of an agreement that thay ar© seeking
i

to avoid the requirements of the National Labor Relations
Act as regards th© ®rapioy®@s that they have where they do
set the terms and conditions of their employment.

Part of

the essence of their arrangement with their contract farmers
is that they ar® out of th© very area that the National Labor
Relations Act is concerned with.
BaysIda3 s argument that th© statutory exemption
covers those who contract for others to do th® actual farming
asks the Court to expand the statutory definition beyond its
\

plain meaning and beyond th© decisions of th® Court interpreting
the statute.

This statute is net required, either for
■'

\\

practical business reasons or to treat employers and employees
fairly.

Th® statutory definition is quit© precis®.

Congress

0

didn’t simply exempt agricultural laborers and leave it to the
courts to define agriculture; it spelled cut what it meant.
It, included farming in all its branches, but only those incidental
non-farming operations performed by the farmer.

That is, by

solution© engaged in actual farming.
As j pointed' out,the Court held in Farmers Irrigation
Co. that an. association of farmers that supplies irrigation
water to its member farmers is not itself a farmer for purposes
of the exemption.

The supplying of necessary services to farmers

42
deas not; make you a farmer.

So ©van though Baysid© supplies

necessary materials to the farmer and pays him for th© results
of his efforts, Baysid© is not th© farmer.
QUESTIONS

I get a feeling, Mrs. Shapiro,, that th©

Government’s position as you articulate it is that whan th®
total farming operation becomes subdivided and compartment!zed
resembling the methods of modern business in order to achieve
greater efficiency, that somehow or other the more efficient
function loses its character as farming.
MSS, SHAPIRO:

No.

Certainly, we ar© not arguing

that integration makes it los© its character.

Ail w© are

*

saying is that when you have.got a complex company, what you
have to do is look at what it is doing and look at th® nature
of, here, the contract with the growers.

We ar® not certainly

arguing that as a whole it's not a farm.

We agree that there

ar© parts of it that are farming.

All we ar© saying is that

in its relationships with th© growers, it's contracting with
farmers.

Certainly you can imagine situations in which Baysid®

would have its own farms, like th® sugar companies do.

It®s-

not the modernization of it that, is th® problem; it*s th©
form that that has taken.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Shapiro, suppose thay had owned all

of these farms and operated them.

They would still b@ under

th© saute legislative decision, wouldn't they?
MRS. SHAPIRO:

If they owned and operated all these

the feed mill was incidental to the operation of th® farm.

Would those trucks be in th® farming

la order to answer that question, you

would have to look at the relationship between Bayside*s

And the Wai&Xua cas®
¥

lays out certain questions that you ask in order fcq determine
whether the feed mill is incidental to Bayside5s farming
operation.

That is the

Everything ©Is© is -the same.

MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Right.

Whether those trucks b© process or farm.

MBS. SHAPIRO:

Our position-is that they would be

incidental to the feed mill. ;:.That*s, I think, quite clear.
Then th© next question is is -the feed mill incidental to Bayside *s

44
farm operations? .
Nov/, th® court b®low, and in our brief we discuss
th© question of whether the feed mill is incidental to the
vary limited farm operations that wo agree that Bayside is
involved in.

That is one question.

Your question would b®

whether th© feed mill is incidental to th© much larger farm
operation -that Bays id® would h© involved in in your case, and
that is yon ar® having it incidental to a different unit and
it*s a different question.
QUESTIONS

Boss it make any difference in this eas©

that th® feud mill was owned by a subsidiary?
MRS. SHAPIROs

No.

The Board found and the Court

agreed that it was one unit.
QUESTIONS

Does it make any difference that a small

percentage of -th© feed mill's product, was sold to outsiders?
MRS. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION s

Ho, it really doesn't.

So it would b© th© same if>the feed mill

were owned directly and located on property owned by Baysid®
and its entire output want for this chicken farming operations?
MRS, SHAPIRO s
QUESTION:

Yes.

You would still have th© issue in your

view as t.o whether or not. the work of th® truck drivers was
incidental to a farming function.
MBS. SHAPIRO:

And whether Bayside*s relationship

with tli© contract growers

• really makes them a farmer.

45

Th@ only two points I wanted to emphasise in addition
are thax there are no practical business reasons which require
treating Bayside as a unit,

in fact, soma of Bayside's truck

drivers are unionised, represented by the union, so they clearly
are under the National Labor Relations Act*

Bayside doesn't

contend otherwise.
QUESTION:

What function do they perform?

MRS. SIIAPIRO:

Those are the truck drivers that go

onto the farms and get the chickens and tak© them to the
processing plant.

They belong to the same bargaining unit as

the members of the processing plant.
QUESTION:

And. there has never been a claim that

they are agricultural workers.
MRS. SIIAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Mo.

And they are employees; they are net

independent contractors.
MRS. SIIAPIRO:

Oh, yes, they are employees.

And the other point I wanted to make was that there
is no considerations of fairness that require you to find
these truck drivers agricultural workers.

Our point is that

people that are performing similar work, the workers on
Bayside*s own farms and any employees of the growers, clearly
they are doing the same kind of work, they are both agricultural
workers.

They are both within the exemption.

Bayside also

has a — the truck driver that delivers the feed to the

46
independent farms? he is not an agricultural worker.

He is

doing the same kind of work as these truck drivers here are.
So in fairness considerations? they should be treated the same
way as people doing similar work.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well? Mrs. Shapiro.

You. have a few minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN J. LEVENSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEVENSON:

Thank you, your Honor.

In my presentation in chief I never got to the
question about incidental to or in conjunction with farming,
and I would lik® to do it right now.
In the regulations of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
to
I would like to make reference for your future research/730.157 (a),
and that says, "In the cans of transportation to farms of
materials and supplies, it seems clear that transportation to
the farm by the farmer of materials and supplies for use in
his farming operations, such as seed, animal or poultry feed,
farm machinery or equipment would be incidental to the farmer’s
actual farming operation.
In Maneja, which they quoted, that's 349 U.S. 262,
"Similarly the- exemption clearly covers the transportation of
farm implements, supplies, and field workers to and from tne
fields."

In Farmers Reservoir, which Mrs. Shapiro quotes as

saying that it isn't incidental to or in conjunction with
farming, I disputa that entiraly.

At 337 U.S. 766, it is

speaking about th© delivery of water to the headgates of
farms by irrigation company workers.

"It is equally clear

itat it does constitute a practice performed as an incident
to or in conjunction with farming.

The irrigation company

workers were not exempt, however, because th© delivery was
not by a farmer or on a farm."
Abbott Farms, 437, 304 holds that production and
hauling incidental to and in conjunction with poultry is
farming.

Wirts v. Osceola Farms, 372, 584-589, footnote 4,

"Movement of food and workers to the fields has significance
and purpose only in making it possible for the harvesting
activity to take place."
What I am saying, if you own an individual feed mill
and you have truck drivers from it, those truck drivers are
incidental to and in conjunction with the mill.
sense.

It makes

But if you own 3 million chickens all over the farm,

you are trying to raise chickens, you are not trying to
deliver feed.
With regard to how the feed mill works, one-third
of the production went to an independent feed company at. th©
time they bought the thing.

It doesn't go to it now.

But

the feed that goes to the farms only is driven by Bayside
drivers to Bayside farms.

They connect it up at the feed mill,

48

they pour it. into the truck, they drive to it, they may unload
it at the farms.

These days what's feeding the chicken?

The

guy who is deciding what to feed that chicken is extremely
important because h® is deciding how to change the feed every
minute of the time.
One more thing.
"on tho farms."

I have left out this business

In modern day farming, you. have got at least,

four separate elements.

You have got the hatcheries, you have

got the poultry processing plant, you have got the feed mill,
and you have got the poultry growers.

is on the farm.

What is the farm?

I

Every ©lament of that thing

What does the driver do?

from th© feed mill to the contract farms.

He is driving
That leaves open

the question what about the highways, driving back and forth
on that highway?

That is th® weakness in the argument.

That is addressed by the case of H.L.R.B. v. Olaa Sugar, 242 F.2d
at page 717, "It is common knowledge, that even small farms
are frequently bisected by public roads.

Even small farm

operators frequently own or operate noncontiguous fields
reached only by public roads. If a citrus fanner sent his
truck driver to haul hay baled in a distant field to be
stacked near th© farm building, th® operation would hot csas©
to be an agricultural one even if th© employe© made some use
of the public road on his trip."

If tills be true in tho case of

the small farmer, the case should also be true here.

49

We have also got this case of Brennan v. Sugar Growers
486 F. 2d 1011.

Those* wars cooks.

Th®y war© cooking in a

labor camp, and th© co-art ther© held that they are on a farm
as much as you could be on a farm, given the fact they ware in
a labor camp.

is if

s.r© in agriculture.

Nowadays, that’s agriculture.

And they will recognize this when they tak® and combine all of
these elements into one. that you are back to the original
farmer doing everything.

Now we have got the whole thing

doing everything.
Now, the question that Maneja raises —- and th© reason
I. am not saying this is primary farming is th© same reason
Manaja says this transportation of a truck from a field is
secondary farming.

Qlaa Sugar questions that.

They can't

understand why that isn't part of the harvesting operation.
I think? to hs quite frank, and I have never understood why
it. isn't part of raising poultry.

It's not incidental to, it’s

And that’s the issue to rae.

I would exempt

either one or the other, but I never considered that it wasn't
exempt.
My time has run out.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER2

Thank you, counsel.

Th© case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:47 p.m., oral argument in the aboveentitled matter was concluded.]
