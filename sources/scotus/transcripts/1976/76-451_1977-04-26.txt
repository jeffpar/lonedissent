MR0 CHIEF JUSTICE BIRGER:

We will resume arguments

in Alabama Pcwer against Davis,
Mr» Ryan, you may continue»
ORAL ARGUMENT OP ALLAN A0 RYAN, JR0, ESQ», (Resumed)
FOR TILE RESPONDENTS
MR» RYAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
There is really Just one issue in this case:

Is the

credit for pension plan purposes a credit — and I quote now
from Ac c a rod 1 *—» "which would have automatically accrued to the
veteran had he remained in private employment rather than
responding to the call of his country"?
If so, then Mr, Davis is entitled to that credit
and I do not understand my opponent to disagree with that
proposition»
On the other hand, if the Court should find that
this credit is based on the performance of actual work, then
the credit is not a function of seniority and Alabama Power
Company is obligated to provide such credit only if it does so
for employees on leave of absence,
QUESTION:

Would it re equally accurate to cast that

in terms of whether there has been compensation paid during the
period, rather than work was performed?
MR, RYAN:

Do I understand, Mr» Chief Justice, the

28
issue of whether the power company paid Mr» Davis while he
was in the service?
I don't think that that is an equivalent proposition*
I think that the fact that the company did not pay him com­
pensation is nothing more than a reflection of the fact that
he did not perform any work for the company during that time»
Compensation, in tha; sense, is a fundamentally
different aspect of the employment relationship and the
pension plan»
QUESTION:

Then you 3o not think that if the

employer paid the employee during all the period he was in the
service, as some employers did, that the contributions to the
pension fund would follow automatically?
MR» RYAN:

If the employer did pay the employee

while he was in the service, I would assume that they would
continue the pension plan, but I would not say that it would
have to follow automatically»
I think that had the power company paid Mr, Davis
for the time he was in the service and not extended him credit,
for the pension plan,that this case would be no different than
it is,
I don't think that tie pension plan is tied to
whether the company decides to pay him compensation or not*
I think the Court's inquiry is whether the pension plan, as
such, is a different aspect of the employment relationship than

29
compensation,,
We believe that it is.

We believe that the pension

is based on longevity of service and is not based on the
amount of work that .the employee actually performs for the
c ompany«

,
And# therefore* we believe the decision below should

be affirmed.
Under Accardi* the Court must look to the real
nature of the pension benefit.

It cannot be bound by narrow

definitions or the industrial >ractiee* as it said it would
not be in Accardi.
And* we think* that under that analysis* pension
plans are aspects of seniority

First* pension plans require

an employee to work for many years before he receives any
benefit at all.
Typically* an employee under this plan* as under
others* must work to age 65 to receive full benefits* and he
must work fifteen or more years to receive any benefits at all.
And* we submit that when it is possible for an
employee to work ten or fifteen or even more years and not
receive any pension at all* it is difficult to conceive of
the pension as simply being a. form of deferred compensation.
Moreover* pension plens fill needs of the employer
that other aspects of the employment relationship do not.
And the District Court based its decision* we feel*

30
on this ground„
Employers;» naturally, want a stable and experienced
work force*

And the promise of a pension, after years of

service, encourages employees to stay with the company through­
out their career, and this serves the need of the employer to
develop that stable work force,
QUESTION:

Mr, Ryan, let me go back a minute to the

provisions of C-l, which Mr, Justice Stewart and I were asking
you about yesterday afternoon.
That provision, after the talk about "restored without
loss of seniority,and they shall be entitled to participate in
insurance or other benefits offered by the employer or person
that established rules," wouldn't it be a perfectly orthodox
statutory construction to say ;hat that portion of the statute
grants all that is to be granted in the way of participation
in insurance or other benefits?
In other words, they cover what they wanted to give
the ex-servicemen In the way or insurance and other benefits
in that portion, and, therefore, you can't go back and read
seniority as covering the gran:; of pension plan,
MR, RYAN:

I would say, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, that

that inquiry, as you have put it, is reversed,

that what the

Court should look at first, as was established in Accardi, is
whether the benefit at issue is a function of seniority.
If the Court finds that it is such, then it has no

31
need to go to the second clause.
QUESTION:

Well, how about the expressio unius rule,

where the statute has, in so many words, covered what a re­
turned serviceman shall get in the way of pension plan?

You

don't go to some broader phrase and include it under that.
MKo RYAN:

Well, the statute, in its words, of

course, does not mention pension plans.

And the question is

whether the plan is an aspect of seniority, or not.
The Court said in —QUESTION:

Why shouldn't the question be whether it

is closer to participation in insurance or other benefits?
MR. RYAN:

Because the Court, in Accardi, said that

the other benefits clause was Intended to add certain benefits
to the veteran and not take away any that were established by
the seniority clause.
QUESTION:

And we agreed yesterday that was dicta.

MR. RYAN:

I don't believe that point is dicta,

Mr, Justice.

I believe the dicta point was the part of Accardi

which discussed the rationale of Congress and whether that
other benefits clause rooks only to the time when the service**
man is in uniform.
But, I think it was necessary to the decision in
AC-Cardn that it first construe whether the benefit was an
inspect oi seniority and then, as the -district Court had done •<«*
The -District Court — Or, rather, the Court of Appeals in

32
Accardl said yes, we find it is an aspect of seniority, but
we find it is taken away by the other benefits clause»

And the court in Accardl said,

"We find it is a

benefit of seniority and we find that once that conclusion is
reached the other benefits clause cannot come in and carve
out an exception*"
The other benefits clause is Intended only to add
things, not to take away things»
So, in that sense, I submit it was not dicta, and
the Court's inquiry must first be to the seniority clause»
We believe, in this case, that having made that
inquiry that the Court should conclude that the pension plan
is an aspect of seniority»
We recognise that,if the Court finds it necessary to
fail back on that second clause, Mr» Davis loses, because the
company does not extend pension benefits to employees on leave
of absence»

But it is very definitely a -- the first inquiry

must be to the seniority clause»
QUESTION;

Except, I thought we agreed yesterday

that the second clause doesn't literally apply in this case
because there was no plan in effect at the time that Mr» .Davis
was inducted into the Armed Forces»
MR* RYAN;
Mr»

That is one way of reading that statute,

Justice*
QUESTION;

Well, isn't that the only way to read it?

33
MR» RYAN;

Well, I 'chink, that if the phrase is read

In that sense, it essentially discriminates against the
veterans who went into the service prior to the time that
their employer adopted a pension plan»
In other words, if this pension plan in this case
had been adopted in 1940, instead of in 1944, the reading that
I understand yon to advance would not grant him the benefit of
pension»
QUESTION;

Noe

My question was simply directed to

the proposition that if there was no plan in effect at the
time he went in the Aimed Forces, then this see end section is
wholly inapplicable and you have to look to the other sections,,
MR» RYAN:

I would say if there was no plan in

effect when he went into the Aimed Forces —
QUESTION;

Then this second protection doesn't,by

its terms, apply?
MR» RYAN;

I would say that's an acceptable — That's

a consistent reading with the statute, yes„
I think there are other benefits to the employer that
accrue from a pension plan which we discuss in our brief»

One

is the incentive that it gives to older workers to retire with
some measure of financial security»

This, in turn, opens up

the channels of advancement within the organisation for younger
workers to advance.

That,: in Itself, is an attractive aspect

of the job to younger employees, in addition to the substantive

34
benefits of the pension plan»
QUESTION:

What If today, for the first time, the

employer developed a pension plan that was contributory, not
a fund of the kind we have

here, with four parts paid by the

employer and one part by the employee.

And it would be

voluntary in the sense that those employees who did not want
to make the back payments would not be required to do so, and
for simplicity $100 a year from this employee would be required
for each year he was employed»

Would you say he would be

exempt from payment of that money for the three years he was
in the service?
MR» RYAN:

Mo, Mr. Chief Justice, he would not be

exempt from paying that.
What the statute commands is only that he be re­
stored without loss of seniority.

It does not grant him any

benefits that his counterpart in the job does not have.
QUESTION:

But you are arguing for a result that

would give him monetary benefits for these three years, are you
not?
MR0 RYAN:

I am —

QUESTION:

Not just status on the payroll, in terms

of seniority, but money in the fund to his credit.
MR. RYAN:

Money in the fund is exactly what we

are asking for, but it is not money that his civilian counter­
part does not have.

35
The Court in Aecardi said that there is no point in
awarding a man seniority if you then deny him the prerequisites
that flow from it*

So, all we are asking is that he stand in

the same shoes as his civilian counterpart who stayed on the
job while Mr* Davis went off to serve in the Military,
J

We are not asking that he get any benefit that his
civilian counterpart does not have.
And, so, under that rationale, it is only fair that
he pay his $100 a year, just like his civilian counterpart.
That's the essential command of the statute, that it apply
evenly to — that the benefits flow evenly both to veteran
and non-veteran, alike.

So, in a contributory plan, he would

be entitled to pay his fair share,
QUESTION:

Mr, Ryan, does the record tell us how

contributions to this plan are computed or made, or what?
MR, RYAN:
Stevens,

I don't believe it does, Mr, Justice

I don't think that la a part of the plan, itself,

I may be mistaken in that, but I don't think that it does,
QUESTION:

It is a contributory plan?

MR, RYAN:

It is a non-contributory plan,

QUESTION:

It's non-a outributory.

MR, RYAN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Mr, Ryan, does your argument for coverage

get any support out of C»2, the declaration by Congress that
on his restoration he is restored in such manner as to give him

36
such status in his employment as he would have enjoyed if he
had continued in such employment?
MR, RYAN:

I think our argument does get support

from that statute, although the Court has mentioned on several
occasions that C-2 is a codification of the escalator principle
that the Court announced in Flshgold in 19^5 or 19^-6„
Congress effectively approved Flshgold by enacting
C-2, but that escalator principle is, of course, the guts of
our argument, that under Flshgold he does not step back on the
escalator at the point he stepped off.

He steps back on at

the point he would have been at had he not,gone into the
service»
I think, in looking at the pension plan as one which
benefits employer

as well as employee, it becomes clear that

the plan is an incentive to maintain a continuing employment
relationship with the company»

The worker Is paid wages and

vacations and other short-term benefits for the work that he
does from day to day, but the pension is over and above this»
It is an incentive for him to return to the job day after cay»
And the pension is withheld from him unless he stays on the
job until age 65«

The full pension, at any rate, is withheld

until he is at age 65,
And it is this unique aspect, we submit to the Court,
that sets the pension apart from other incidents of the
employment relationship, from other collectively bargained

37
benefits,and demonstrates that what counts is the simple and
continued status as an employee»
And, therefore, under the principles of Accardl
and Pester and, indeed, all cases which this Court has decided,
construing this statute, the time spent in the military must
be credited to the veteran or else he loses grbund as compared
to his civilian counterpart,
QUESTION:

Mr. Ryan, suppose under a collective

bargaining contract, a person who has been a machine operator
for

ten years gets paid more ;han when he had worked for

five years, that the pay is dependent upon length of service,
to some extent anyway.

Have we decided that the returning

veteran gets back on the escalator at the higher rate of pay?
MR* RYAN:

Yes, Mr» Justice White, the Court has

decided that, assuming that the pay raise is automatic.
I think that Tilton and other cases along that line
have held that.

They have held that if there is some

managerial discretion involved then it Is not as clear a
question, but the automatic pr Motion has been held to be
an incident of seniority.
Under this plan, I think, what I have said about
pensions is quite clearly illustrated, because under this
plan if you are on the payroll you are accumulating accredited
service, whether you are working or not.
If you are not on the payroll, you are not

38
accumulating accredited service, except under circumstances
that were stipulated below as being brief, infrequent and
exceptional»
So what is required is the simple status of being
on the payroll and not, as Petitioner argues, the actual
performance of work»

It is the continuing employment relation­

ship with the company that counts here and that is what
seniority is all about*
Let me illustrate with two examples»

There is

accredited service accumulated for the employee for those times
when he is on vacation, when he is on sick leave, when he is
on holiday, even despite the fact that during those periods
he is performing no actual work»
On the other side of the coin, there is no
additional accredited service for the time that he is working
in an overtime : capacity, even though, of course, he is
performing work during those hours»
And if this were truly a form of deferred compensa­
tion, as my opponent argues, both of these features would be
absent*

And in both cases the work performed is divorced

from the credit received*
Let me put this example, if I may.

Two workers

born on the same day, each goes to work for the company on
his ISfch birthday.

Each retires at his 65th birthday, having

performed an equal amount of work for the company*

Each starts

39
to receive a pension at age 65 which, of course, is exactly
equal for both workers.

Worker A dies after one year.
twenty years after his retirement *

Worker B lives for

Worker B receives twenty
.

1

times as much in pension benefits over the course of his life
as worker A did, despite the fact that each of them performed
the same work for the company.
I am not referring to military service at all in
this hypothetical.

My point is to illustrate that it is very

difficult to conceive of this plan as simply deferred compen­
sation when Worker B receives twenty times as much in the way
of benefits simply because of the fact that he lives longer,
more than twenty times as much as Worker A, despite having
performed exactly the same amount of work.
QUESTION:

That could still be compensation, because

the compensation would be that you. get benefits for the re­
mainder of your life, however long it,is and that's rather
standard*
MR9 RYAN:

I have no quarrel with that, and we are

not attacking the plan, in any sense, in that respect, but
I think it illustrates
QUESTION:

Compensation would fee that you get benefits

retirement benefits -=* for the remainder of your life, and
some people live longer than others.
compensation

It Is the same basic

It is the assurance of benefits for the remainder

40

of your life,
MR, RYAN:

Except that in one ease the worker is

receiving twenty times more*
QUESTION:

Well, that's —

MR, RYAN:

Let me stress one other point, because

I think there was a suggestion by the Petitioner that extending
credit to Mr, Davis, at this late date, would prejudice the
company because the company could not foresee,in 19^-3 ahd '44
and '45,that these payments would be required»
As we point out in our brief, there is no evidence
on this point, but even the argument, itself, fails to hold
water, because
QUESTION:

Isn't the evidence there, in the sense

that there was no plan in effect?

Isn't that some evidence

of foreseeability?
There was no plan in effect when he left, was there?
MR, RYAN:

That's correct, Mr, Chief Justice,

But, their argument, as I understand it, is that
It would be unfair now to tax the company for contributions
due in 1944 and 1945«
QUESTION:

Is that argument not based on the

proposition that at the time they put the plan in effect,
whatever year that was —
MRo RYAN:

1944,

QUESTION:

Actuaries looked at the number of employees

41
and the precise age of those employees,and their years of
service, and out of that amalgam constructed an actuarial basis
for the plan*

•* -.y

But they could not, they claim, include him, and
if there were ten others like him, could not Include those
in the same category simply because he was not an employee at
the time,
MR* RYAN:

Well, he was an employee at the time

that the pension plan was instituted.

He started employment

in 1936, and he x*as an employee even though he was off in
uniform at the time,
QUESTION:

With no knowledge on the part of the

company whether he would ever come back at all*
MR® RYAN:

Well, the amendment in 1966, which is

now Section 3-A of Roman Numeral III of the plan, and that's
on page 61 and 62 of the Appendix, under this amendment
and this, I stresses passed in 1966 — an employee is given
retroactive credit for his military service during World War
II and Korea, less one year, if he worked for the company
prior to his 25th birthday.
In other words, the company said, in 1966, "We will
allow you to fill the gap in credit caused by military service;
by taking the time you worked for us before

you entered the

plan, your 25th birthday, and using that to fill the gap, less
one year*"

.t

42

The only reason that did not apply to Mr» Davis is
because he didn't go to work for the company until he was 26»
But the point is this, that the company cannot be heard to
complain now, I think, as a practical matter, that affirming
the judgment below would cause it a great hardship, when in
1966 the fund was apparently solvent enough to grant retro»
t

active military credit to some employees»
I think that the Court should not consider this a
very tightly correlated fund when it has the possibility to do
that *
I thank the Court»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr» Ryan» 0

Mr. Boles, you have some time left*
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. HAMPTON BOLES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BOLES:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
What I would like to do in reply, in my remaining
time, is to place our case in perspective in view of the
Government's argument»
Now, the Government has basically argued that this
case — that pension rights should be determined to be
seniority in a sort of a general sense, without depending upon
the provisions of our pension plan,,

We say that you cannot divorce the amount of pension

43
paid, which is in dispute here, from the provisions of the
very agreement from which that right arises*
The Government, in its brief, apparently, realizing
the fallacy of its argument, says that you can have a pension
plan which is not dependent upon seniority if you have a
precise, 100$, correlation between units of work to units of
benefit *
We say that this Court in Poster said that although
the work requirement correlates only loosely with the benefit,
if it is a work requirement, which our plan very definitely has,
that that is not sufficient to invoke the statutory guarantee,
Now, with reference to some of the questions that
have been raised, I will point out that on page 17 of the
agreed statement of fact's ~ that's 17 of the Appendix — it
explains, somewhat, how the pension plan is funded and it
says the amount of contribution is determined annually.
And, also, in response to a question yesterday,
we have stipulated, as counsel for the Government has said,
that the employees of Alabama Power Company on leave of
absence were treated exactly the same as employees on leave
of absence for military service, with respect to determining
the amount of pay due under the pension plan*
There has been no discrimination against the veteran
under our plan*
earned

He has been paid for everything that he

44
And what is important here is, we go back to
Mra Justice Stewart's analysis of the section yesterday.,

The

section says three things, that you be given your seniority
when you return, that you be given other benefits and insur­
ance when you return, in accordance v*Jith the rules of the
employee in effect when you left, relating to other employees
on leave of absence, and that you will not be terminated
within one year»
And, Mr» Davis t*as not fired»

Mr» Davis

although

the statute, literally, didn't say that he has to be given
rights — we don't have to rely there, may it please you,
Mr* Justice Stewart, on that section»
If you take it out — take his rights out, by virtue:
of the fact that we didn't have a plan in 19-43> he doesn't
gain any other rights»
But, even if he did

* even if we accept the argu­

ment that we have to give him the rights equal to other
employees, this we have stipulated we have done»
So I say that he cannot get any rights there»
Now, the Government criticises us for not having
a,

precise correlation between units of work and units of

benefit»
If we say the law does not require that, we do not
give credit for overtime as earnings„

vie also do not count

an hourly credit under the plan as accredited service

i

or

45
overtime»
We say that we don't have to do that* that even
though we don't do that* it doesn't, somehoxtf, create seniority
out of a plan that is founded upon work.
All the time that my opposing counsel was up here
we were talking about actual work and automatic benefits.
When you speak of seniority — and I am not saying you have
to take the most narrow view of seniority — to determine
this case in our favor, you generally have to have two things,
and that is names of employees and dates that they were with
the company.
decision*

Then you can start paring down to make your

You don't have to have the earnings of that employee*

You don't have to say that that employee had to be a full-time
regular employee, working 40 hours a week*

It is simply a

matter of time*
How, it is not true, absolutely not true,that all
our plan requires is that you have a status as an employee
in order to gain benefits.

Certainly, you do gain some

benefits, and we described those yesterday.

You get time for

vesting, because that's only time-related.

You get time for

the one-year qualification, but there is no way, simply by
being on the payroll, unless — if payroll is described as
the status of an employee to the employer, that you can gain
one cent under the plan wifchout being a full-time regular
employee, working 40 hours a week on a full-time basis.

46
So, we say that we have followed the Act»
followed it in 1937«

it is go 3d nom

We

Our pension plan

requires a work requirement and it should be upheld by the
Court .
Now, for seme reason or another, there seems to be
some criticism because in l66 we granted a veteran something
over and above the normal employee.

This is exactly what the

Government has done in seme of its own retirement plans that
it has drawn up.
Specifically, I am talking about the Railroad
Retirement Act.

It also excludes military service from years

of service under that Act, except those portions which were
very narroi^/ly defined as wartime service.
And, I say, not only

if the Government had intended

to define seniority in a broad ’way for purposes of the Military
Selective Service Act, it certainly should have abided by it
in the Railroad Retirement Act, which it did not, and that is
in 45 U.S.C., Section 231, I think.
With that, Your Honor-, we say that our pension plan
embodies a very distinct, very apparent work requirement.
have to be on the payroll.

You

You also have to be earning, and

it should not be assumed by the Court that a utility or any
other corporation can have employees that are gaining benefits
as a full-time regular employee and being paid without doing
their work.

That simply is not practical.

It is not what

47
happens* and there is no evidence in this record that that is
what happens 0

You have to work to be paid except* of course*

for the normal things* like vacations* but we say he has
earned that.
Excuse me.

We say Mr. Davis earned his pension plan —
He earned his pension pay that was computed in

exactly the way the plan calls for and he is not entitled to
have any extra pay imputed or required because of his two and
one-half years in the military,
QUESTION:

You have to work to get benefits*

doesn't depend upon -•« in any way, upon how much you work.
If you are a full-time regular employee* you are not given
any more credit for overtime* or any less.

You'd get the

It's a 40-hour week and it's the same contribution,

even if you work 40 hours overtime* isn't it?
MR. BOLES:
Mr. Justice Stewart.

Your analysis is exactly c orrecfc *
We admit that.

That's evident in the

plan* but all we are saying is that there is nothing in the
law, and no case before^ this Court that requires the type of
precision between units of work and units of benefits that is
being asked and asserted by the Government.
I don't know that it would be administerable.

I

suppose you could do it with computers to keep up with the
minute by minute* hour by hour “*=
We say that we have a very practical* logical*

the lower judgment be reversed.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
