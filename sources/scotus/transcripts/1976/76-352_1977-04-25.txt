MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BUGGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-352, Chappalle against the Greater Baton Rouge
Airport District.
Mr. Adcock, I think you may proceed when you’re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF H 2RSCHEL C. ADCOCK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT.
MR. ADCOCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
My name is Herschel .Adcock and I represent the
appellate in this matter, E.C. Chappells, Jr.
This is a case that Is before the Court on a
constitutional issue, in that Louisiana statute requires the
ownership of property assessed with any parish in order for
a person to be a member of the airport commission.
For a period of five years, prior to the time the
appellant resigned, he was the executive director and
secretary of the greater Baton Rouge Airport District.

Mr.

Chappells was the -airport, for all intents and purposes.

He

ran the entire show, with the airport commission giving him
technical advice.
Mr. Chappells then resigned his position as the
director of the airport, and was appointed as a member of the
airport commission.

4
Shortly thereafter,
appointment ran, the East Bato

prior to the time that his
1

Rouge Parish clerk summarily

dismissed Mr. Ghappelle from tie Commission after receiving
a legal opinion that since Mr. Chappelle did not own property
assessed in East Baton Rouge Parish, that he was not qualified
to serve as a commissioner on ;he airport.
Based upon this notim, Mr. Chappelle then filed suit
in district court in Baton Rouge, alleging, number one, that
he did meet the qualifications

that he did own property that

had been assessed in East Bafcoi Rouge Parish? and it was
proven in Court that he did own property on which he had
actually paid taxes.
But the court held that since this property was
not listed on the assessment rolls, that he had not
technically met the requirements to be a member of the
a i rpor t comen i s s ion.
Mr. Chappelle likewise —* in the alternative if the
court determined that he did not meet these qualifications,
raised the issue that the Act which required the ownership
of property was unconstitutional, in violation of the
equal protection and due process clauses of the United State?
Constitution.
On March 4, 1975, Mr, Chappelle was formally denied
hiv,; rseafc on the airport commission.

On July 23, 1975, the 19th Judicial District Court

5
ruled in favor of the City of Baton Rouge, stating that
indeed he did not have the right to sit on the airport
commission because he did not have property assessed in
East Baton Rouge Parish.
Mr. Chappalle then wont to the next procedure.

He

asked the Court of Appeal, the 1st Circuit Court of Appeal
sitting in Baton Rouge, to review the decision.

Once again,

he urged the equctl protection and due process clauses of the
United States constitution, and once again, the Court of
Appeals aligned itself with the District Court, stating fchcit
he owned no assessed property, and was therefore not qualified
to sit as a member of the airport commission.
Mr. Chappeile had no direct right of appeal to the
Louisiana Stata Supreme Court, but asked the Supreme Court to
review this decision by the Cox rt of Appaals.

The Supreme

Court, in a memorandum decision, denied the writ, with one
of the justices stating that tie writ should be granted.,

And

he decided the case on which we principally relied, the
Turner v. Fouche.
We have before the Court, we believe, three questions.
The first one

is the case of Turner v. Fouche: does it mandate

that this statute in Louisiana that requires the ownership of
assessed property, does it mandate that this statute be struck
in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment?

Secondly, the Court should determine whether or not

6
this act is in violation of the due process clause, in that
the requirement of the ownership of assessed property has
no reasonable basis as to the qualifications of a person to
sit on the airport commission»
QUESTION:

What sort of authority, counsel, does

the Greater Baton Rouge Airport District exercise?
exercise general governmental authority?

Does it

Or is it kind of a

specialized district?
MR. ADCOCK:

It is a specialized commission that

deals with the day-to-day affairs of the airport itself.
QUESTION:
those

Salyer and

Well, why wouldn5fc that be governed by

Tulare

cases which we handed down about

three or four years ago which C notice neither party cites
in their briefs, where we said,, in the case of a special
improvement district, the one-man, one-vote rule and the
property requirements did not ipply?
MR. ADCOCK:

This boly is a public body that sits

and actually approves leases.
affairs of the airport.

And deals with the day to day

It is a public-appointive body; they

serve for a given term.
QUESTION:

Well, these were in that sense public

bodies, but I think they were described as kind of special
use districts rather than dist ricts having general governmental
powers.
MR. ADCOCK:

Yes, si:.

I8m not familiar with the

7
cases, your

Honor.

The third question wa think this Court should
consider is whether or not a citizen has the constitutional
right or fundamental right to hold an appointive position;
that is, whether he should hava the right to be considered to
the appointment of a public body, and whether or not the
ownership of property should come into the picture at all.
It is our position that if this Court upholds the
Louisiana statute that permits the state to require the
ownership of assessed property, this will just open the door
for additional classifications, and will completely undermine
i

>!V|^

the protection that

citizens nave to be considered in

appointments to public offices,,
QUESTION;

Well, we have upheld, just in the past

couple years, residency requirements for running for office
of five and ten years in length.
those >

How would you distinguish

every citizen has a right to be considered for

public office?
MR. ADCOCK;

Okay.

Residency requirements can be

argued as having a reasonable basis-

If someone — if you

do not have a residency requirement, it would be too difficult
fox: the voting officials to keep up with citizens.

You could

have someone who would move to one place and vote, and to
different areas and vote.
QUESTION;

Well, I8m talking about a New Hampshire

s
law which we upheld two or three years ago that as I recall
required a fifteen year residency requirement before you could
run for governor.

Now, that certainly isn't based —• that

isn't the kind of time period that you're talking about?
eliminating fraudulent voting.

I mean that's just a long­

term attachment to the State that was required, and we upheld
it.
MR. ADCOCK:

Okay, to live at a place for a certain

period of time, I believe, is i rational basis to determine
whether someone is qualified to sit in a public position.

But

to require that that person owns property assessed in a
parish in order to be considered for a public office is in
violation of the equal protection laws of the country.
QUESTION:

But doesn t it have the same motivation,

or at least something in common with the residency requirement,
that is, an attachment to a more-or-less permanent relationship
to the community?
MR. ADCOCK:

I don't believe that the ownership of

property can be considered as indicative of someone having an
attachment to a particular area.
QUESTION:

Because there are —

Well, the question is whether it's

rational for the State of Louisiana to think so; whether
that's an adequate basis.
MR. ADCOCK:

Yes.

Well, the State of Louisiana

apparently in drafting this I thought that it did have some

9

rational basis.

It is our position that it does not, that

the ownership of property does not make one better qualified
to sit as an airport commissioner, especially in the light
of the facts that we have before the court today.

Here we

have an expert in the field of aviation, a man who had run
the airport for five years; who had resided in the area for
a great length of time.

Yet h* was denied a seat on the

airport commission because he 3id not —
QUESTION;
qualifications.

Well, you're arguing his soecial

Statutes car.' : be made, can they, to reach

every situation when there's a line-drawing process?
MR. ADCOCK:

No, sir,

I was giving that as an

example of how this statute does discriminate against v
persons who are highly qualified.

Here we have apublic

body making decisions for the entire public of the parish of
East Baton Rouge and the greater Baton Rouge area.

These are

citizens throughout the parish, or this area of the state, who
have great need for an adequate airport.
QUESTION:

Yet—

Does this requirement apply to any other

public office in Louisiana?
MR. ADCOCK:

Not to sty knowledge, sir.

Not to my

knowledge.
QUESTION:

Is there any legislative history why

they attached to holding this office?
MR. ADCOCK:

No one ;,eems to be able to tell me.

I

10

have examined the records when this bill was presented to the
legislature in 1369, and there is nothing in there stating
why they had the requirement o : the ownership of property»
QUESTION:

Well, is

te eligible to be considered

now?
HR. ADCOCK:

According to the opinion of the lower

court, and of the parish attorney, he would not be, because
he

during the time that he was dismissed, and the time this

case actually came to trial, in an attempt to avoid the payment
of tremendous fees and co^ts to Mr. Chappells, he did go and
buy property.

The court ruled that that was a moot question?

that the statute required the ownership of property at the
time he was appointed.

And because he did not own the

property -~
QUESTION:

Well, suppose ha had to step aside now?

there “d be a vacancy.

Could ho be considered now?

MR. ADCOCKIf this statute remains on the books,
ho could not, because ha does rot own property.

He has

since dispossessed himself of this real estate.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose he hadn't.

Could he then

be considered?
MR. ADCOCK:
QUESTION:
compensatory job?

Yes, sis.
Why does ha want the job?

Is it a

Is there *—

MR. ADCOCK:

It is net a compensatory job.

QUESTIONS

I aslc selfishly because I, at one time,

served on an airport board.

Aid I don’t quite understand

what all the fuss is about.
MR. ADCOCKs

I'll have to go outside the record, to

a certain extent, although it is a part of the state records.
Mr. Chappelle has a long record of being connected with
aviation.

He is a retired Air Force Colonel.

He has served

in numerous capacities with airports in the past.

There was

a political struggle between tie mayor and the —- another
politician in the area, and he choose the wrong friend,
apparently.

He wanted to remain in the field of aviation, so

he would have the opportunity

:o attend seminars that would

keep him abreast of the change.! in the field of aviation.
That was his principal reason
We believe that the

for wanting —
.anguage that we have cited in

the brief on page 7 in the Tur>ar^_v. Pouch® is one that should
control this situation.

And I will quote a portion of its

"...the appellants and the members of their class do have a
federal constitutional right to be considered for public
service without the burden of Invidiously discriminatory
disqualifications."
discriminatory'

We submit that this is an invidiously

qualification : that is, the (qualification

that he must meet of owning property assessed.
And bear in ning that the lower court did hold that
Mr. Chappelle owned the property.

They did hold that property

12
as determined in Louisiana mea is either real or personal'
property.

They held that he owned property located in East

Baton Rouge Parish.

We’re not just talking about land? we’re

talking about property.

But the mere fact that it was not

listed on the assessment rolls was the issue thatthe
Court of Appeals used in which to uphold the lower court.
We further submit that there is no rational basis
for the ownership of property in that there is no *■— this does
not make a person better qualified to be an airport commissioner,
simply to have his property listed on the assessment rolls.
As we pointed out in our brief ~
QUESTION:

Le me ask you, Mr. Adcock, what

governmental bodies, under Louisiana law, may impose taxes
to fund airport bonds, if you nave such' things?

Any of

these organizations, the parish council, the city council, the
airport authority?
MR* ADCOCK:

Yes, sir? the airport authority, the

city council, can.impose taxes,

And of course, the state

1 eg i s 1 at u re s.
QUESTION:

: Does

the airport authority require the

consent of any other govsrnmen :al body before it may assess
a tax?
MR. ADCOCK:

I don31 believe — Mr. Keogh, being

the parish attorney,can better answer that question, Mr.
Justice.

13

QUESTION?
29y

Mr. Adcock„ what do you do with the

language in Snowden

v. Hughes
that -- it said back in
ago
1943 that more than 40 years/this Court determined that an
unlawful denial by state action of a right to state political
v.

office is not a denial of a right of property, or of liberty?
MR. ADCOCK:

We believe that the line of cases.

Turner v. Fouche, and the other cases cited —
QUESTIONS
MR. ADCOCK:
QUESTION:
MR. ADCOCK:

It cites chis case — with approval.
With approval.
Yes.
We believe that it's — that the

Tumer v. Fouche —- what we're centering on is the issue of
whether or not there's compelling state interest for requiring
this classification.

Mow, a person does not have a fundamental

right to be on the airport commission.

But he has the

fundamental right to be considered for this position.

And

he cannot be denied this right if such denial runs afoul
with the equal protection and due process clauses of the
United States constitution.

This, we submit, has happened

in this case.
First of all, the Tu::ner v. Fouche case —
QUESTION:

Well, if lie doesn't have a property

right, what does he have?
MR. ADCOCK:

He has

it's a fundamental right

arising from the constitution not to be discriminated in

14
consideration for appointment to this public body.

If there

was a compelling state interest for requiring this classifi­
cation, yes, perhaps.
QUESTION:

Well, in the Snowden case the man was

denied a political office because he was a Negro.

This Court

said, that wasn’t enough.
MR. ADCOCK:

Well, we believe this Court has

overruled that finding in the Snowden case in many areas, and
we further submit
QUESTION:

You’re not joing to put yourfinger on

them right now?
MR. ADCOCK:

No, sir.

We submit that this statute

could have just as well said, he must be a white citizen
owning property assessed.

It wo aid have been a little easier.

I don't believe our State court vould have permitted that
statute to stand when it was attacked on those — on the
constitutional grounds.
QUESTION:

Well, the statute does say that when you go

on the tax roll, you have to go an according to your race.
MR. ADCOCK:
QUESTION:

That isn’t what Louisiana says?

HR. ADCOCK:
it doss, I,being a
and I

I’m not familiar with that, if —

I'm not going to say it doesn't, but if

Louisiana citizen, I was not aware of it,

it's hard for me to accept that.
Finally, and as I had said at the outset, we do not

15
believe that there is a compelling State interest for the
upholding of this statute , which prohibits any person from
being considered for such appointment.

Consideration is the

key; not the right to be on that commission, but consideration
for.

Because we have here a parson that I think all parties

would admit is qualified to serve on the airport commission.
Had he not been, he certainly would not have been appointed.
But we have a person who was stricken by the parish clerk
\

simply because he did not own property assessed in East
Baton Rouge Parish.

We respectfully request this Court to

strike that portion of Louisiana Act 151 of 1969 as being
unconstitutional.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Adcock.

Mr. Keogh.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH F. KEOGH, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OP THE APPELLEES.
MR. KEOGH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Joe Keogh, and I represent the appellees
in this matter.

I spoke to the clerk earlier, and if I might

take about two seconds of the Court's time, I wanted to
verbally amend a typographical error on page 7 of appellees'
brief for the phrase as it appears is not the way that it was
intended to be printed.

The phrase should read —

16
QUESTION:

Where can we find it, first?

MR. KEOGH:
QUESTION:

In the second paragraph of page 7.
Yes.

MR. KEOGH:

And it’s implicit to my defense before

the Court, because we do not qiarrel with the. Turner
And the way it reads, it reads, the Turner rule — it reads —
and result in a further unwarranted intrusion on a legislative
body.

It should read, and further — and further result in

an unwarranted intrusion.

Because we do not feel like the

Turner case was an unwarranted intrusion on the legislative
authority of the STate of Geor jia.

In fact, we embrace the

Turner v, Fouche case, and we embrace all of the decisions
that stem from that line of jurisprudence, and yet submit to
this honorable Court, may it please the Court, that as has
been pointed out by some of the questions already, the case
that we have before us does no: fall within the ambit of
equal protection as set forth „n Turner v, Fouche or
[pronouncing] Fouche.

The essential part of the case that

the appellants I truthfully believe have misstated, uninten­
tionally , of course, is that this is a fundamental right.
And all of our research indicates that there are a lot of
fundamental rights that this court has set forth: marriage,
procreation, vote, equal voting power, interstate travel,
First Amendment rights.

All of these are set forth at page

8 of appellees® brief.

Access to the ballot as a candidate?

17
it’s arguable whether that has ever been clearly enunciated
as a fundamental right or not.

But vre submit, Hr. Chief Justice and Members of

Chappalle had to serve on an appointed advisory body.

as to whether or not this Boari of Commissioners had any

The question was referred to me, since

They do not

The Act, which we reproduced in

its entirety in our brief, sets forth the fact that this
body's authority is essentially of a recommendation level.
They recommend to the parish counsel, which acts as the
airport district.

The Act sets forth that it must

18
have at least one meeting a month.

And it transacts — as

counsel for appellant said — it transacts day-to-day
business of the Director that he brings before theras pass
resolutions and so forth.
Now, the way the Act sets up this Commission, it's
a two-tiered process.

And I'm not intentionally borrowing

on Mr. Justice Marshall’s language, two-tier process, in the
Mergier case, or [pronouncing] Mergier case when I use that
concept.

.......

But it is a two-tier process.
This Commission after it acts the counsel, which is
■

a dual sitting body, it sits as a parish counsel, which is a
single member districted body that governs the entire parish
and the city, because we have a combined form of government
in Baton Rouge, it recesses as the parish counsel and then
reconstitutes itself with the same membership and so forth
as the governing authority of the airport district.

So all

of the decisions that are made by resolution — this is all
found in the.Act — made by resolution of the Commissioners
is either approved, rescinded, or disapproved —or suspended,
rather * - rescinded, approved or suspended by action of the
parish counsel sitting as the

airport district.

And so, consequently, we view it as definitely not
the type of Board of Commissioners that, one is entitled to
serve on as a matter of.

Greyhound Bus Station, for example.

believe the legislature looked at this not only as establishing
a reasonable criteria to hold a nexus with an appointee to th€!
parish, an interest in the community, but moreover, and more of
a subtle reason, but more realistic, is to operate as a
restraint on the unbridled authority of the council to make
an appointment of anyone whom :hey desired that as I pointed

QUESTION s

Is it pc ssible to have personal

property taxed, and not be on the assessment rolls?
MR. KEOGH:

It's — now this is a fine point of fact,

that I can speak to? it’s not in the record because we didn’t
send up — it's perhaps in the transcript, but we didn’t send
up the pleadings, because we tiought we’d just stick to the
constitutional issues.

But it is possible if they had sales

tax on something like a Porsche automobile, Mr. Justice
Blackmun.

But the problem here is that the State law requires

that if I own any piece of movsable property and this is
not restricted — the previous court decisions in the courts
below have all held that this does not require someone to own
real estate like freeholders in the Turner case or any type
of property, it can be real, corporeal, incorporeal, moveable
or immoveable.

You can own on2 stick of furniture, and

I didn't know that.

Well, it's in the jurisdictional

statement on page 25, quoting from Section 1957 of your
code, the assessors throughout rhe state shall ascertain in
so far as practicable whether the persons whose property is
assessed by them and whose names figure on their assessment
rolls are white or colored.

Our legislature —

Marshall.
QUESTION:
MR. KEOGH;

I do too.
Our legislature some two years ago

spent a considerable amount of time and money through the
legislative council to go back through every law that was on

the books in the State of Louisiana and purge that type of
material from the laws,
QUESTION;

And they never suspected it would be

as simple as that?
QUESTION;

What Justice Marshall quotes also goes

no and requires that that fact he noted, made mention thereof
on the assessment rolls.

So that I suppose that the requirement

of owning property assessed in the parish requires that the
written record disclose the race of the person.

If it's

not that —
MR, KEOGH;

I’m completely unprepared to respond

MR. KEOGH;

aa an objective test, is to create some additional nexus to
the parish in the sense of one owning property would be more

QUESTION?

Supposing you had, for example, a young

flight instructor who didn't own any property, lived there
on a month to month basis, just out of the air force or something
like that; he’d be disqualified as opposed to someone who
happens to own an automobile.
MR. KEOGH?

What is the reason?

This is why I said earlier that we here

today —■ and I will be the first to concede this fact — can
think of a lot better reasons to have put in the law, but
still, these are net wholly irrelevant.

And I think the

Would you agree that if the language,

instead of saying, and owning property assessed, and supposing
it said, and having red hair; would that make it all right?
MR. KEOGH:

That’s a close qualification.

This is

the important part that Mr. Justice White brought up, and
that is that this gentleman could have opened his
classification by buying that single stick of furniture.

Maybe that —

Because one would

then be penalising the people who are too poor to own a

QUESTION:

How about over $500?

Would that also --

MR, KEOGH:

It becomes a question of degree.

QUESTION:

So that the nexus is, you want to be

sure that this person owns at least thirty or forty dollars
worth of property?
MR. KEOGH:

They intend to remain in the parish, and

have some interest in the commission. We submit -QUESTION:

Well, do you think that owning thirty

or forty dollars worth of property is better evidence of that
than six months residency?

No, sir.

but the rule *—•
QUESTION:

You also concede that there must ba some

reason for this requirement in order for it to be constitutional?

and then you take off the deduction.
QUESTION:

Did you not suggest to me that if it

is a thousand dollars or more, that would be unconstitutional?
MR. KEOGH:

Sir, I said that might be a closed

class, and as such, it would be very suspect.

We8d go back

to that strict scrutiny test —
QUESTION:

We don't know the dimensions of this

class, because we don't know where the exemption stops.
MR. KEOGH:
QUESTION:

Correct, your Honor.
It would

itill be assessed; that's your

point.
MR. KEOGH:

Yes, sir ., it would still be assessed.

It would be assessed, and the point is that whether it's for
five dollars or a hundred, it's not a closed classification.
The gentleman could go out and become a member of this class
very readily.

,

There’s no inference in this case, for example

30
as there was in Turner , of an. Invidious racial discrimination.
This board of c ommissioners is composed of black and white *
and the chairman is black.

considerations of equal protection cf the law, and we really
get into a consideration of, can a legislature ~ if it please

And of course,

if they don't, then of course, the commissioner has no way of

Your Honor, Mr. Justice Blackmun, the part thatl
was going to refer you to is in your Turner case, your
Honors kept pointing out that you were not prepared to hold
that the Georgia requirement of a freeholder being the only
person that could serva as a member of the board meant that,
and I'm quoting fromfche decision, the possibility thatother
circumstances might present thornselves in which a property

32
qualification for officeholder — officeholding — could
survive constitutional scrutiny.

That , plus the fact that in

Turner there was a requirement that one be a owner of land,
immovable real estate.

That's what the word, freeholder,

was defined as in the decision.

And moreover, in Turner,

the body that was being constituted was more of what we have
called a political body making political decisions? namely,
the Board of Education.

This Board of Education was a far

different instrumentality than the Board of Commissioners
in East Baton Rouge Parish.

Justice Blackmun; it had discretionary powers.
fact, a legislative body.
in the instant case,

It was, in

This is something we do not have

Those arethe three basic distinctions I

have made to show that this is not in the same category as
the Turner case.
And in conclusion,

wj

just simply submit, if it

please the Court, that in this particular situation, Turner
is not applicable.

And here we have a commission which, if

the legislature of the State of Louisiana cannot set these
not wholly unrealistic bases, wholly irrelevant, then we have
a bunch of other commissions that are going to be in trouble.
Because there are a lot of these type requirements that are
made for service on zoning bodies, for example, Mr. Chief
Justice, zoning bodies and many others.

And we submit that

that's why the courts below should be sustained.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further, Mr, Adcock?
MR, ADCOCK;

Yea, very briefly.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KERSCEEL C. ADCOCK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. ADCOCK;

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
Counsellor stated at the outset that he did not see
where we got the notion of the fundamental right.

I want to

once again direct you to page 7 of our brief, language from
the Turner v. Touche case.
The Court specifically held that the STate may not
deny to some the privilege of holding public office that
extends to others on the basis of distinctions that violate
the Federal constitution guarantees.
We submit that this is a public body.

Contrary to

what Mr. Keogh said, if it was just sitting there, what is the
purpose of having it?

This body can enter into leases, where

the parish's property is leased to persons, the rent-a-car
people, the other airport hangars, are all leased.
body is the one that enters in-;o those leases.
is oney.

And this

It can spend

It can authorize the expenditure of different funds.
And we further submil: that this requirement is one

that has found its way in a statute, and there is no reasonable
basis.

For instance, there?s n> requirement that the director

34

of finance of the parish of East Baton Rouge own property
assessed in Louisiana, East Baton Rouge.

There’s no requirement

that the director of the airport own property assessed in
East Baton Rouge.

These are appointed positions.

And there'si

no requirement that the parish attorney, who is likewise
appointed, own property assessed in the parish of East Baton
Rouge.
QUESTIONS

I take, though, that the —a parish

councilman, he’s elected, he doesn’t have to own property,
but if he’s to be elected to the commission, he has to own
assessed property, doesn't he?
MR® ADCOCK:

That is correct, under the dictates

of this statute.
We have a situation here Mr. Chappell© did actually
own property on which taxes were paid.

The court found that

he did own property, and that he had paid

taxes.

But the

mere fact that this property w as not listed on the assessment
rolls was the means they used to disqualify him and remove
him from this commission,
QUESTION:
or your friend did.

But you said it was a voluntary system,
Any taxpayer can get himself on the

assessment rolls without much difficulty, can’t he?
MR.» ADCOCK:
QUESTION:
MR. ADCOCK:

No one does.
This is a statute that is sitting on

35
the books, and I know of no person —
QUESTION:

Maybe you need to broaden the statute,

then.
MR. ADCOCK:

Yes, sir.

Maybe there should be a

requirement of something that is enforced.

But this is a

statute that -QUESTION:
MR. ADCOCK:

You mean nobody files a return?
No, sir

no one files a return.

The

exemption is so great that there are no personal property
taxes except with the businesses.
QUESTION:

How do you get anybody on the board, then,

on the commission?
MR. ADCOCK:
QUESTION:
MR. ADCOCK:

The rea! property —
I see.
— must be on the

taxing rolls.

And

I truthfully believe that this is what the legislature meant.
However, property, as it8s defined in Louisiana and in most
other jurisdictions, it5s either personal or real property.
QUESTION:

Do you accept your opponent's distinction,

or distinguishing Turner as he did on the three propositions?
MR. ADCOCK:
QUESTION;

NO, sir, I truthfully believe —
Do you feci Turner applies, or has no

relevancy?
MR. ADCOCK:

I think Turner applies to this decision.

It's as squarely on point as any decision that I would want to

36

rely, in ray opinion.
QUESTION;

At least one member of your State

Supreme Court felt so, didn’t 'he?
