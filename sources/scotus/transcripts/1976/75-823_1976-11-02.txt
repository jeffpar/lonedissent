MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 75-823, Belcher v. Stengel, Et Al.
Mr. B®11, you may pressed whenever you ara ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. BELL, ESQ„,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BELL;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas® the

Courts
This case is her® on a writ of certiorari from the
United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.

Does the

fact that an off-duty police officer, out of uniform, is
required by polios department regulation to carry a weapon at
all timos, establish that any use of that weapon against the
person of another, even though the officer is ©ganged in pri­
vata conduct at the time, to b© an action "under color of law”
within the meaning of 42 U.S.C., section 1983?
QUESTION;

Sometime at your own convenience — fit

it in wherever you wish — I would like to have you explain to
me why the conduct reflected by this record of this officer is
any different from what it would have been had h® been
specifically detailed to work overtime, that is work beyond
his ordinary work-day or work-weak — if you would deal with
that problem at some point.
MR. BELL:
Chief Justice.

I can deal with it at 'this moment, Mr.

The officer testified that he was a uniformed

4
officer on fool: patrol in an area in Columbus, Ohio that is
known as one of the most difficult areas to patrol.

And the

facts of this case will boar out that h© was off-duty, out of
uniform and was a Columbus police officer.

So had h® been on

overtime, I would respectfully suggest he would have bean in
uniform.
QUESTION?

Wall, a uniformed officer might be de­

tailed to overtime work in plain clothes.

That is not an

uncommon thing, is it?
MR. BELL?

No, Your Honor, it is not an uncommon

thing but, again, it would depend, I think, depending upon
other factors, and that this officer was a foot officer on
patrol.

Normally they would not ba assigned to plain clothes

duty on overtime.

I do not mean to say that that is true in

every case.
On March 1, 1971, the petitioner, off-duty, out of
uniform, and was a member of the Columbus Police Department, a
Columbus police officer, at approximately 1:15 a.m. in the
morning, was in a public bar known as Jimmie's Cafe, in
Columbus, Ohio, on a private social activity.

An altercation

developed in this bar between respondents and other persons in
the bar, not including the petitioner at this time.
The petitioner then became involved in this alterca­
tion and, as a result of his becoming involved in this alterca­
tion, h© resorted to the use of a .32 caliber automatic weapon.

5
firing it into the air, the use of this weapon resulted in
the deaths of respondents, decedents Noe and Ruff, and in­
juries to the respondent Stengel,
The respondents then filed two complaints on the
stated set of facts, briefly stated.

They filed a complaint

in th© Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio, a state
court, and a complaint in th© United States District Court,
alleging violation of 42 U.S.C. 1983 .
QUESTION:

Does Ohio hava a tort claims act that

permits suit against municipal corporations or the state?
MR. BELL:

No, sir, to answer your question.

The

complaint —
QUESTION:

In fact, there is still sovereign immunity

in most areas in Ohio, is there not?
MR. BELL:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

The respondents dismissed their complaint —
QUESTION:

Well, specifically, is Columbus an area

where the doctrine of sovereign immunity applies?
MR. BELL:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Either against th© municipality or the —

well, it woulc. b® the municipality?

MR. BELL:

Against the municipality, not against the

officers, but against the municipality.
QUESTION;

Against the municipality.

vould b© ©Kempt, from liability —

Municipality

6

MR. BELL:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

— shielded from liability by the doctrine

of sovereign immunity under Ohio law, is that correct?
MR. BELL:

Correct.

QUESTION:

All right.

MR. BELL:

And the federal system, under Monro© v.

Pape, the City of Columbus is not a parson under 1983.

Now,

the complaint was dismissed in the state court by respondents,
and it proceeded to -try the case in the United States District
Court upon the complaint they filed, stating and joining
twelve officers along with the respondent Belcher.
At the close of the plaintiff’s case, the twelve
officers were dismissed and th© respondent remained in the
case.
QUESTION:

What was the theory on which the other

twelve officers were originally joined?
MR. BELL:

Under 1985, title 42, conspiracy to, ona,

cover up the acts of the respondent Belcher; and, two, to
deprive the respondents of their constitutional rights under
42 U.S.C. 1985.
QUESTION:

Were they in effect Belcher’s superiors?

MR. BELL:

That is correct, and they were in the

chain of command.
QUESTION:

Mow —
Mr. Bell, there was also, was there not,

an inquiry by the Police Board of Inquiry?

7
MR. BELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And was that, initiated by tha respondent,

or how did that cane about?
MR. BELL:

No.

Does the record tell?

In the Board of Inquiry, which was

th® Firearms Board, which meats every time an officer uses his
firearm, was initiated automatically under the regulations of
th® Columbus Police Department.

It was not initiated by the

Tha complaint alleged facts in general in

paragraphs four and five, making general allegations and, as
we say, conclusions of law that at all times defendants acted
under color of law and in line of duty.

But in alleging the

facts as to the petitioner's conduct in paragraph eight of the
complaint, the allegations are accepted as trua and taken in
their best light for th© plaintiff, can only lead to the conelusion that the petitioner did not act under color of law.
The facts alleged in paragraph eight of tin© complaint,

MR. BELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

It begins at page 8,

Volume 1, and I am referring to page 10 of th© —
QUESTION:

I don't — I see, there are two volumes.

MR. BELL:

Correct — Volume. 1, page 10 —*

QUESTIONi

I see.

I se®.

s
MR. BELL:

— and I am reading at the bottom of —

you will notice it says ’'paragraph 8* and I am reading at the
bottom, where it begins,

"Raymond L« Belcher, who was out of

uniform and in no way identified as a Columbus policeman and
in no way involved in th® minor dispute heretofore described,
intervened by attacking one of the plaintiffs, decedent, from
th© rear by grabbing him around the neck from th© rear, said
intervention by Raymond L. Belcher being without any notifica­
tion or attempt to notify anybody in the caf© that he was an
off-duty Columbus policeman, and without any attempt by said
Raymond L. Belcher to make a police arrest or citizen's arrest
of any kind at this time."
The facts go on to state:

"Casey D„ Stengel, one of

th© respondents before th© Court, attempted to kick the
chemical mace equipment which Raymond L. Belcher pulled from
his clothing and which was blinding and choking the people
involved from th® hand of said Raymond L. Belcher; whereupon,
still without any warning, identification or attempt to make
an arrest, said Raymond L. Belcher pulled a gun from his
clothing, and which gun he was ordered and directed to carry
as an off-duty Columbus policeman, and at that time he shot
into the air resulting in the deaths of respondent Noe and
respondent Ruff, and injury to respondent Stengel»"
QUESTION:

What do you mean by "shot into the air"?

MR. BELL:

That was th© testimony of Raymond Belcher.

9

He testified that he was on the floor, on his back, being
stomped, and at that time he pulled the gun out from under his
back and shot into the air to get these men off of him.

The

shots struck and caused the damages —
QUESTION;

But they were on top of him, weren’t

MR. BELL;

Sir?

QUESTION;

The men were on top of him?

MR. BELL:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION:

Has there been sane change in position by

they?

both you and your adversary in this case, Mr. Bell?

I gather

from the allegations you read in th® complaint that the sug­
gestion that th© police officer did not ever assert, who he was
and that he never mad© any attempt to make an arrest, was
thought to furthar the plaintiffs’ cause and, on the other
hand, I gather* from other material in the record that whoever
defended the case for Mr. Belcher, defended it on the basis
that he was more or less acting in th© line of duty.
MR. BELL;

That is correct.

That via.3 a statement

made at the. close by the defense counsel, the then city
attorney, who prior* to that and at th© time of this act was
the safety director who issued an order in a letter to Mr,
Belcher.
The statement was made at the conclusion of the
plaintiffs' car© in argument for a directed verdict of

10

acquittal.

The court did not accept that statement, as I

understand it# as a stipulation because he want on further to
charge the jury as to the facts.

1 submit —

QUESTION:

He used it in his closing argument, too.

MR. BELL:

Yas, he did, and I respectfully submit —■

QUESTION:

And he really emphasized it.

MR. BELL;

— Mr. Justice# that the statement at. the

closing argument was not evidence, and I respectfully submit
that the statement at the conclusion of th© plaintiffs' cas©
was not evidence.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bell, there was evidence, that the

Police Inquiry Board found precisely th© same thing, and that
was evidence, was it not?
MR. BELL:

Th© Police Inquiry Board did find that th©

officer was justified in use of his weapon.
QUESTION:

And was acting in the line of duty?

MR. BELL:

In the line of duty.

QUESTION:

Was that evidence put into the record by

th© plaintiff or th© defendant?
MR. BELL:
recall.

Well, I was not at the trial and I don’t

I am sure it wasput in

by the plaintiff and would

have —
QUESTION:

Well, it would have supported th® argument

defense counsel mad© at the close of th© plaintiffs' cas© and
at tli® close of th® entire cas©, wouldn't it?

Wouldn’t he have

11
put that evidanc© in?
MR. BELL;

Yes, but —

QUESTION;

It certainly would have been consistent

with his theory of defense anyway.
MR. BELL;

It would have bean consistent with his

theory of defense but I can't answer you as to th© defense
counsel, but I sm sure th© plaintiff would put that in, too.
QUESTION;

You say there is no evidence but the

sta tenent in the closing by the city attorney is, "Bcnni©
Lehman related for you a conversation that sh© heard at th©
bar between these three people in which on® of them said, 'He
is a cop."'

Is that an accurate statement?

MR. BELL;
only statement tat
QUESTION;

Th© statement from Bonnie Lohrnan was the
we could find that indicated —
I til ought you said a mi nut© ago that

there was no evidence?
MR. BELL:

This —

QUESTION:

You mean there wasn’t much?

MR. BELL:

Wall, Mr. Justice Marshall, th® statement

by Bonnie Lohrnan was, as far as we wars concerned, what sh©
haard, number one? and wa know from the testimony of th©
petitioner that ha did not identify himself or attempt to act
under color of law, even though tha respondents may have
■thought he was or even questioned it, -they did not perceive
his actions, as I read paragraph 8 of tha complaint, where I

12
am arguing at, this point * to have been acting under color of
law .

Now -QUESTION*

In your view of the federal statute and

this complaint, if Belcher had been in uniform and on duty at
that, time and pi sc® , what would be the situation under the
federal statute?
MR. BELL:

If he had been in uniform and -—

QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR. BELL:

QUESTIONS

On duty.

MR. BELL:

He would have been acting under color of

But would that —

MR. BELL:

plaintiff

would you concede that the plaintiff would then

hav® had a valid action under the civil rights statute?
QUESTION:

Or would h@ only hav© a valid action if

h® could shoe excessive force beyond anything necessary?
MR. BELL:

That is what I was going to lead up to.

QUESTION:

Well, then, why would he than?

13
MR. BELL;

Wall, because

if excessive force is

used under color of lav/, that is the very thing that 1983
seeks to protect.
QUESTION:

Why?

Doesn't 1983 talk about a depriva­

tion of rights secured by the federal Constitution or law?
MR. BELL;

And through the Fourteenth Amendment, yes,

QUESTION:

Well, why is that a violation of the

sir.

Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. BELL:

Th® taking of life?

QUESTION:

No.

MR. BELL:

You mean excessive us© —

QUESTION!

Th© Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid

the taking of life.
MR. BELL:

Well, perhaps, Mr. Justice, I don't under-

stand your question.
QUESTION:
in this case.

Well, my question is a pretty basic one

It is on© that wasn't even discussed.

It was

hardly discussed by either the District Court or the Court of
Appeals.

But why, even assuming this was a — let's assume

that this policeman, Mr. Belcher, was in uniform and on duty,
and let's further assume that ©verything happened th© way it
did happen.

Why would the victims of his shooting or thair

estates — on© parson was injured seriously and two were killed,
as I understand it ■— why would they have an action under 1983?

14
MR. BELL:

Because under 1983 if there is an abuse

of authority or a misuse of authority? as stated in th©
judicial cases that hav© been before this Court before? that
is a violation of th© constitutional rights —
QUESTIONj

Of v?hat constitutional right?

MR. BELL!

Th© right to not b© punished without du©

process of law.
QUESTION!

Well? that involves the judicial system?

at least it has always bean thought to.

We hav© a case that

is going to be argued I guess later to day? so I had better
not

but generally? traditionally that has involved th®

judicial system and the penal system? hasn't it?
MR. BELLs

Yes.

But in the traditional cases ~~ in

th© cases before this Court? the lav; has fcmm set forte that
•the misuse of power possessed by virtue of state lav; and mad®
possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the
authority of state law, is action taken under color of law?
state law.
QUESTIONs

All right.

•taken under color of lav;.
MR. BELL;

Then let’s assume this is all

I have assumed that.

All right.

Therefor©? if he takes action

under color of law and misuses that authority to? let’s say?
and
QUESTION2
Belcher.

Remember? you are representing Mr,

You are not on the other side in this case.

15
MR„ BELLi

I realize that.

1 realize that, but I am

trying to be professionally honest with the Court as I can.
QUESTION:

Well, I understand that, but I really

don't -- let's assume that a policenan in uniform, on duty
but not in an emergency, he is just driving from on® stationhouse to another, drives with gross and wanton negligence and
strikes and kills somebody.

Does he deprive that victim, with

his gross and improper bahavior, of any constitutional right?
MR. BELL:

It is our position that he would not in

that case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Then what is the difference between that

cas® and this cas@?
MR. BELL:

There is no difference in that sens© in

our position of that case and this case, as you state it, and
that is what I am arguing.
QUESTION:

Ho, no, no, because in each case he is

acting under color of law.

Now, your present case, I know that

you argue that he isn’t
MR. BELL:

Correct.

QUESTION:

-- or wasn't.

MR. BELL:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

But I am assuming that.he is in both,

cases, both in the bar in Columbus, Ohio and hypothetically in
uniform and on duty and also on the street in Columbis, Ohio,
where h© just weaves and speeds and there is no emergency and

16
he kills somebody.

Now, why in either case is the victim de­

prived of any right guaranteed by the Constitution, the
federal Constitution ©r federal law?
MR. BELL;

All right.

In the latter case, Mr.

Justice Stewart, I agree that the victim of the automobile
would not bs deprived of a constitutional right and it would
not bs an action under 1983.
QUESTION:

In the cas® —

What about an officer in uniform

approaches a bank and a bank robbery is going on and engaged
in a gunfight with the bank robbers but inadvertantly shoots
and kills one of the customers or on© of the amploy©©s of the
hank.

Bo you think that is covered by 1983?
MR. BELL;

No, Your Honor, w© do not, and that is

ana of the reasons of our argument, that is on© of the purposes of our argument, that w@ do not feel that 1983 should —
that the doctrine "under color of law" should b© extended to
include these privata acts.
QUESTION;

Well, then the theory of your cas© might

more, appropriately be that this man was in fact on duty and
engaged in the normal functioning of the polio© under the
special instructions to carry guns at all times.
MR. BELL;

It is our contention that 'the District

Court hit on that theory, that he was carrying the gun on him,
in its charge, and w© fee! that although that charge is not
objected to — which I will get to later in my argument — we

17
feel that it was fundamental error.
QUESTION;

Mr. Ball, 1©1 me get back to your answer

fco Mir. Justice Stewart's question.

You said that in 'the squad

car incident, which Justice Stewart hypothesised, you felt it
was not a violation of any constitutional right.

The intima"

tion was that you felt in the bar case it is & violation of a
constitutional right?

•

MR. BELL;

It could be.

QUESTION;

Well, what would it turn on?

MR. BELL;

It would turn on, in my judgment, it

would turn on if the officer arrested the person, took them
into custody and then proceeded to beat a confession out of
him or to in some way -QUESTION;

That would be like Screws?

MR. BELL;

Screws, yes, Your Honor, or th© —

QUESTION;

Or Monroe v. Pape?

QUESTION;

But Screws said ha had to do it with an

intent, an expressed intent to deny him a right guaranteed by
the Constitution.
MR. BELL;

That is correct, and this Court reversed

the Screws case upon th© charge of the Court calling it funda
mental error because th© Court did not charge on that very
point, Justice Marshall.
QUESTION;

Of course, -that was a crimincal case.

MR. BELL;

And that was a criminal case, under 18

18
U.S.C., s@ctioxx 242.
QUESTIONS

The cases that I would —
But the constitutional right at stake was

precisely the same there, x*7&sn't it, the right of —
MR. BELLs

Excuse m©, sir?

QUESTION?

Th© constitutional right at stake in

Screws is precisely the sam®, th® right not to b© deprived of
right without due process of law?

question;

MR. BELL:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BELLs

Now, to further answer Justice Rehnquist's

Th© cas® most in point is the matter of Williams v,

United States, where a private detective in th© State of
Florida was engaged by a lumberyard to catch petty thieves,
and he had an authorisation issued from the state.
had with him an on-duty police officer, in uniform.

He also
Hs would

catch theses peopl©, take them to a paint shed and beat con­
fessions out of them, literally baat confessions out of them,
and at th© time that hs was doing it, which is very signifi­
cant, I suggest, ha was flashing his badge, his color of
authority.

This was not don© in this case that is at bar.
Now, wa respectfully submit that th© facts in this

complaint indicate private conduct, and that it lacks a juris­
dictional — it created a jurisdictional facult in the District
Court as attempting to include within 1983 those matters that
are private acts that we have just discussed.

19

QUEST31 OKs

You started, I think, at th® outset of

the case, Mr. Bell, by telling us that a companion suit l&d
been filed in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas?
MR. BELLs

That is correct.

QUESTION s

And what happaned to that litigation?

MR. BELL;

That was dismissed by respondents and

they elected to proceed —
QUESTION;

Dismissed by the plaintiffs?

MR. BELL;

Yes.

Therefor©, idle only fact in the com.'

plaint from which w© can derive official conduct, if th® Court
pleas®, is th© use of the weapon, which complaint alleges
petition carried pursuant to a department regulation requiring
off-duty officers to carry a weapon at all reasonable times
under a theory that officers are on duty 24 hours per day.
To focus upon the use of that weapon alone, coupled
with th© facts stated leading to the conclusion that it was
used in only a totally privat® manner, we feel, does not state
th® facts upon relief can be granted.

And that if the weapon

used is by and of itself determined to satisfy the "under
color of law" requirement, then one© again th© traditionally
exlucded private uses that w© have already discussed with feh©
Court will bs swept within -th© ambit of 42 U.S.C. 1983.
QUESTION;

But, Mr. Bell, you say just th© us© of

the private weapon, but does the record tell us why the de­
fendant became involved in th© incident, his motivation?

Was

20
it a privata motivation or in an effort to maintain the peace?
MR, BELL:

There was a conflict of testimony on this

QUESTION:

But if xm tak® the svidenc© most favor-

point.

ably to the verdict, do we not have to assume that he sought
to bring about pssice and 'therefore perform his duty as an
officer?
MR. BELL:

It is our position that, whether h®

sought either that interpretation or if h® became an aggressor
or as a matter of self-defense, it doesn't matter because he
did not attempt to act under color of law, as it has been de­
fined by th© cases in this Court, and that is
QUESTION:

Well, what is your theory of what h® was

trying to do whan he got involved?
MR. BELL;

He was sitting in — th© evidence was

that ha was sitting in the booth with a lady friend and two
other people.

Th® altercation was at the far end of th® bar

among respondents and other people.
QUESTION:

Between th© plaintiffs and third parties?

MR. BELL:

Third parties.

QUESTION:

And why did h© get involved?

MR, BELL:

All right.

First, 'the testimony was that

he said, well, I am going to arrest three — no, I am going
to arrest two of the officers, was part of the evidence, and
than he said I am going to go to the phone and call on-duty

21
officers, and h® newer got -~
QUESTION:

Well, now, both of those statements —

MR, BELL:

Excusa me, sir,

QUESTION t

Is it not true that both of those state­

ments are inconsistent with a purely privat® motivation?

And

do they not add to 'the evidence of the guns, or can you
properly say there is nothing but the gun involved in the case?
MR, BELL:

Yes, Your Honor, it is our position that

the mar® fact that he sought to get out of the bar to get to a
phone was not an act under color of law that would bring the
respondents, that they would perceive that they were acting
under a color of law and that they were going to be arrested
or that the petitioner was an officer.

That act .alone'of try­

ing to gat out of th® bar to get to a phon© does not make him
a police officer,
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t that act alone have bean th®

most sensible thing to do if ha had been in uniform, on duty,
to call for some back-up help?
MR, BELL:

I think ha would hav®, yes, sir, I agree

QUESTION:

Wall, that is consistent with what your

with that.

response was to Justice Stevens —
MR, BELL:
QUESTION:
in police activity

Yes, sir.
which adds up to me that he was engaged

22
MR. BELLs

Also it could bs private© activity if you

are going to call teh® police when you see trouble.
QUESTION?

What is it, arrest — you think he was

going to make a private® arrest?
MR. BELLs

No, Your Honor, he was not going to make

any arrest.
QUESTIONS

You said

MR. BELLs

Ha was going to get help.

QUESTIONS

I thought you first said he was going to

arrest one or two of them.
MR. BELL?

No.

He stated "I was going to arrest

them but by calling on-duty police officers," not himself.
QUESTION?

I mean to arrest is not private® ~ that

word is not a very privata word.
MR. BELL:

No.

QUESTION s

Arrest is not a very privat® word?

MR. BELL:

I &gn©@ with that.

QUESTION s

So he was acting as a policeman?

But his acts war© not

acts ~

let’s put ifc this ways

Well,

H© was acting as a policeman in plain

clothes.
MR. BELLs

He was acting I think, Your Honor, more

QUESTION;

Right.

like a ~~

MR. BELLs

a policeman off-duty who was required,

as testified by the chief of police, to talc® action.
QUESTION•

Right.

Now, how -—

MR. BELLs

Part of that action, was to go and call

other policemen.
QUESTION;

How could he be off-duty?

I thought you

said he was on duty 24 hours a day.
MR. BELLs

No, that — no.

QUESTION s

Didn't you say the

MR. BELL:

They ar© on duty eight hours a day, on

They ar© on duty —

call 16 hours a day
QUESTION:

I thought you said the reason he carried

a gun was because they war© considered to b© on duty 24 hours
a day.

I heard you wrong?
MR. BELL:

No, no.

You heard me correctly.

That

So they were expected to b® on duty, and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. LEWIS, ESQ.,

MR. LEWISs

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas® the

Courts
The question that Mr. Bell says is bafor© the Court
is not before the Court in any reasonable interpretation,
reasonable and accurat® interpretation of this record.

Perhaps

some of the argument that I advance her© should have been advaxicrd in more detail imposing the petition for writ of
certiorari.
I think there is now enough before the Court, in this
record to establish con.clusiv®Xy that the question that pe­
titioner says is present is not here, by any reasonable inter­
pretation or accurate interpretation of the record.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Lewis, if this man, the pe­

titioner here, Belcher — to repeat th© same question I put to
your friend -- had been on duty in his uniform and everything
else had occurred just as this record shows it, would you
have an action under 1383?
MR. LEWIS:

Certainly.

They are

I mean that doesn't answer the question?

MR. LEWIS:

QUESTION:

Well? h® would b® on duty? an on-duty

officer, going from one sfcatioahouss© to another? and let's

27
assum© he is careening down the street at 90 miles an hour
and he strikes and kills somebody.

That person clearly has a

tort action, but has he been deprived ■— has the victim been
deprived of any rights secured to him by the federal
Constitution or federa law; and, if so, what right?
MR. LEWIS:

Well, in th© tort situation, there is

no effort to enforce the law in the — you see, that was not
tii© situation, enforcing th© law.

Her© we have a situation

where the officer was in th© process of enforcing th® law, ona
of his duties, performing on® of his duties.
QUESTION:

Well, let’s assum® it was the duty of my

hypothetical policeman to go from one stationhous© to another,
h© was acting within th® scop© of his duty, in uniform, in a
police car, on duty.

What is ‘the difference between the two

cases?
MR. LEWIS s

Well, I think in our cas® w© have an

section of the civil rights act, the person is presumed to do

QUESTION:

The Constitution doesn’t say anything

that differentiates an injury caused by somebody at close
rang© with a pistol as contrasted with one caused by a

28
careening automobile.

Theres is nothing in. the Constitution

making that sort of differentiation, is there?
MR. LEWIS:

No, I think that is true.

But I think

the color of law —
QUESTION:

Let’s concede that you are correct about

color of law, about that he is acting under color of law.

Now,

my question goes beyond that, which is simply what rights or
liberty is protected by federal law or th© federal Constitu­
tion v/©r@ denied the victim?
MR. LEWIS:

Well, I think it is tha life, liberty

and property under due process of law.
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't it equally be true in the

case of -the grossly negligent driver, if you are correct?
MR. LEWIS:

Well, 1 have some trouble with that

situation — meets th© color of lav/.
QUESTION:

Wall, I am assuming the policeman is act­

ing under color of lav/ in both cases in my question.
MR. LEWIS:

Well, if you assume h© is acting under

color of law in those facts —
QUESTION:

Wall, a policeman in uniform, on duty,

going from one stationhouse to another, is acting under color
of law, isn't he?

We could agree about that, couldn’t w®?

MR. LEWIS:

Well, I don't believe — I don’t know

that, the cases have necessarily gone that far in the definition
of color of law.

29

QUESTION;

What if a policeman observed a bank

robbery and sees someone f lesing who h© has reasonable causa
to think robbed the bank? shoots at the person and kills him.
And say it take place in Ohio and Ohio says it is justifiable
for an officer in that position to shoot a fleeing fleon.

If

it turns out that h© was mistaken as to that person, does the
person have a causa of action under 1983?
MR. LEWIS;
QUESTION;

I don’t think so.

I don’t thistle so.

Well, why is that different from your

case?
MR. LEWIS;

Her© we hav© an officer, th® evidence

taken in the nost favorable light to th© complainant, was in
the process of qu@lli.ng a disturbance.

H© entered into, as

part of his police duties.
QUESTION;

Well, so in my case.

Certainly no one

could b© mors in th© performance of his police duties than in
uniform, having just witnessed a bank robbery, and trying to
prevent an escaping felon, someone whom he thought was an
escaping felon.
MR. LEWIS!

Well, I think th© distinction is some­

thing that is the question of a purely accidental occurrence,
happened in good faith in -the performance of duty, and th©
situation we hav© hare, shooting.two people -— three people, at
close range, and it has all been submitted to the jury and
there was no justification for the potential excessive force.

30
QUESTION:

In my hypothetical, th® man is much more

arguably in the course of duty than in your cas©, is it not?
MR. LEWIS:
QUESTION:

Right.
So what is it that would lead you to say

in my cas© you don’t have a claim under 1983 but in yours you
do?
MR. LEWIS:

Well, I think in both instances if we

assume they ar© under color of law, it is a question of the
excessive fore© us©d under the circumstances.
QUESTION:

Where doss the Constitution distinguish

on th® basis of excessive fore®?
MR. LEWIS:

Wall, I think that is th© thrust of

Monroe v„ Papa and th® Screws case, as I understand them, that
there was excessive fore© used.
QUESTION:

Screws was someone in custody, in a jail,

and beaten to death, was he not?

And Monroe was a Fourth

Amendment violation, so you never had to go — just th© pro­
cedural guarantees of th® Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewis, let m© ask you two questions

that I think may be relevant to Mr. Justice Relinquish5 s in­
quiry.

Supposing th® facts had shown that fcha officer said

to th® decedent before he shot him, "I don't think you need a
trial, I will take car© of things without all this judicial
process, and we will get things don© in a hurry."

I suppose

that would support a claim that th© man had bean denied due

31
process of lav/?
MR. LEWIS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And you would agree with 'that, would you

not?
MR. LEWIS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Now the second question I would like to

ask is does the question presented in th© petition for writ of
certiorari raisa any issua whatsoever with respect to whether
it has to b© negligence, deliberata intent, such as I raised,
or any of these different hypothetical cases, is that before
us today?
MR. LEWIS:

I don't believe so.

I don't believe so.

I think the sole question that is presented here is was
Belcher

acting under color of law or was this private conduct,

and all this lias been subraittad by the facts, the detailed
facts of this case have been submitted to a jury, the trial
court carefully instructed feh© jury to decide this case, is
this color of law.

The defense counsel used that theory

throughout the case,including the final argument.
QUESTION:

And thtee is no question as to the pro­

priety of the jury instructions bafora us?

We have to assume

that the jury was properly instructed on what the nature of
the violation was?
MR. LEWIS:

Well, it would be my view, in view of

th© fact that tl-nsy didn’t

except to the jury charges, although

lation.

It isn't solely the gun regu­

The Court of Appeals stated that.
If I could com© back to the initial place where Mr.

Bell started his argument, he is again, like he has dona
throughout some of the briefs, and lik® has happened in the
other courts, have taken part of the facts here and isolated
thorn and not look at the complete and accurate facts, includ­
ing the further allegations in this first complaint, th®
first claim related to color of law, that he didn't read to
you.

w® stated that generally.

There ar® other paragraphs

her® teat were not even mentioned.
Now, the posture of this case on the motion to dis­
miss the complaint canes back to this 5

There was © motion to

dismiss and there were depositions taken before th® court
ruled on the motion to dismiss, depositions taken of Belcher.
Of course, at the time th© suit was filed, we had no way of
getting these depositions.

At that time, Mr. Belcher admitted

and used in the deposition, which is before the Court and was
before the District Court, teat he shot th® two men and that
h® chased th® third man out the door of the cafe to apprehend

33

him.

Ha used words that indicated more than w® knew, because

we only had one survivor, of what his intention was.
In addition to that, Belcher admitted at that time
that he had applied for and had received industrial compensa­
tion for seme minor injuries in occurrence of that.

At that

posture in the case, and before the court had ruled on the
motion to th© pleadings, I filed a motion for partial summary
judgment on the issue of color of law, saying that that settled
' the issue of color of law.

The court — there was a dis­

pute of facts and the court, I think properly, overruled that
motion at that stag®, and let th© facts develop? likewise,
overuled the notion to dismiss the complaint, th® insufficiency
of the complaint, and I think this was a proper ruling
throughout the entire trial, the District Court allowed the
jury to settle the disputed facts of what happened.
And as Mr. Justice Stevens says, at this point, the
evidence has to be considered in its most favorable light to
the plaintiff.

QUESTION;

You ar@ saying ‘that is just what a police­

Yes.
So up to this point, except for th© uni­

form, he X3 acting just like a policeman, was he not?
MR. LEWIS;

Right.

Right.

Absolutely.

H© was

acting and he continued to act like a policeman.
QUESTION;

Would you say th® pursuit of the third man

was also acting like a policeman?
MR. LEWIS;

Very definitely.

He used the phrase in

there, he "didn't want him to get away."

H®r@ in on® moment

h© comas with — and his story is varied as the case goes on,
it is changed around and lie tried to fit himself within some

small cafe, ha jumps up, ha chases a man outside the bar who
was trying to get away, ha slugs him with fch© gun outside,
now that certainly wasn't a defans© but was th© act of a
policeman to get the other man, th® third man from getting

they ar© now trying to bring before this Court for idle third

They hav© besn cutting th© facts h©r®, leaving out
th© complete facts, presenting a case to this Court that

And that is th© reason

that I don't believe the question that they ar© trying to

I think w© are still talking

about basically what perhaps I failed to adequately cover in
opposing th© petition for certiorari, -that th© question is
not here.
They say that now w© weren't acting under color of
law.

That is all that is before th© Court.
QUESTION:

May I ask you this, Mr. Lewis:

Why did

you dismiss the law suit that, you filed in th© Franklin County
Court of Common Pleas?
MR. LEWIS:

That law suit, as I recollect it — and I

37

don't remember, I think it was filed separately —
QUESTION:

It was filed what?

MR. LEWIS:

It was filed after this suit was filed

her© and was filed against the City of Columbus, as I recollect
that suit.

It is not in the record of this case,.

But there

was a period of time involving I believe the Kent State cases,
where the question of sovereign immunity was up in the air in
Ohio.

There was a Court of Appeals decision in Ohio that

forcefully and vary dramatically argued against the doctrine
of sovereign immunity.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. LEWIS:

And it was at that part of the cas® to

keep op@n a direct claim against the city that th©r© was a
suit pending.

It had nothing — it was not coextensive with

this, it was not an election.
QUESTION:

Mr. Stengel wasn't a defendant in that

suit, as you remember?
MR. LEWIS:
QUESTION:

Wall, he was a plaintiff.
I mean Mr. Belcher wasn't a defendant.

Excuse ma.
MR. LEWIS:

As I remember the cas© — and it was a

long time agoo — it. is not in this record — but as I remember,
it was directed to the city of Columbus for the purpose of
taking advantage of the possible relaxation of the doctein© of
sovereign immunity, which was up in the air by decision of the

38

Northern Court of Appeals in the Stata of Ohio.

The judge

wrote a very -- an opinion that has not. b©@n accepted by the
Ohio Supreme Court.
QUESTION:
MR. LEWIS:
QUESTION:

Right.
That was what that case was about.
i take it you filed that case, you were

the attorney?
MR. LEWIS:

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

And it was dismissed

as the law became clear from -the ruling of the other case.

It

is not a part of the record in this case and —
QUESTION:

Well, it would be a matter of public

record.
MR. LEWIS:

Y@s.

And if I had known, I ecuid have

been batter prepared.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewis, assuming for the moment that

tha case is.hero, as presented by the petition, does, yaar po­
sition depend on the intent of the officer at the time ha
participated in this foray?
that may sharpen it a bit:

I put another question to you

it moved onffxxss there into what happened.

Would you hav© a

MR. LEWIS;

QUESTION;

MoWy let m© ask you this, Mr. Lewis:

If

you go into District Court and say ray claim arises under th©
Constitution of th© United States, because it is under 1331y
and your case is tried with a jury and so forth, is the ex­
istence of a constitutional question, is that a jurisdictional
question so far as th© District Court is concerned.?

Is that

th® kind of tiling that can bo raised at any time, or is that
the sort of thing that has to b© preserved by th® partias?
MR, LEWIS;

I think it, has to b© preserved by the

QUESTION;

Of course, federal courts ar® not courts

parties.

of general jurisdiction, they ar© courts of limited jurisdic­
tion, and a court is always fre® to examina its own jurisdic­
tion.

You would agree with those propositions, wouldn't you?
MR. LEWIS;
QUESTION:

Right.
Mr. Lewis, you are making a fairly

43
persuasive argument that the petition states a question that
is quite different from 'theory on which the case was presented
below.

Did you file more than one brief la opposition to the

petition for writ of certiorari?
MR. LEWIS;
QUESTION;
MR. LEWIS;

No, I did not, and I have -That is th© brief that —
-- I have indicated that, as I see th©

case now, was probably an inadequate presentation and I think
that th© things that probably should hav© been presented in
the thirty days that I had ar© now before th© Court.

I think

there is — though I am not in the position to press that
forcefully, because of maybe th® incompleteness of my brief,
there is an amicus brief her® that suggests that on© disposi­
tion is th© whole tiling was improvidently granted, and I do
suggest —
QUESTION;

Th© amicus brief was not filed until

August, after w© had granted the petition,
MR. LEWIS;
QUESTION;

Yes.
We didn't hav® very much enlightenment at

th© time.
MR. LEWIS;

That is true, and it is a rare case —

I understand there are a case or two where on further — as the
Court develops further information about th® facts, that
there is a determination that th© thing was imprevidently
granted, as tilings bacam® apparent to the Court, but that

44
weren’t apparant to the Court when the writ was granted, and
it is that disposition that I hav® suggested — that I h&ver»'t
suggested it as forcefully in my brief as perhaps the
Solicitor General did because I felt maybe I wasn’t entitled
tc.

I should have presented it more forcefully in my opposi­

tion to til© motion for petition for writ of certiorari, but
I do think -that that is appropriate solution or, in the event
that an affirmance I think may b@ appropriate.
When the whole accurate is accurately considered, I
think we have a manufactured record, manufactured argument
that has bean presented that the color of law issue has been
out of this case, procedurally out of this case.

And the

question that they say is before this Court is not before the
Court,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. BELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL
MR. BELL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas® the

Court:
Our position is that th© question has been preserved
upon the motion filed in District Court under Rule 12(b),
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure? it was preserved throughout
th® trial, preserved in th® Circuit Court of Appeals, and we

45
f@ai that it is still alive here today, as to whether or not
the court had jurisdiction under 1343.
The other remark that i would like to mak© is that
in question to Justice Marshall as to the petitioner going to
the phone, it is our position that that act of going to the
phone could have been an act of an individual or an officer or
person with any sort of duty, or

as. a privat® individual

could h&v® gone to the phone to call the police.

And we feel

that there is something more that must tak© plac® to bring
this cffi,se within the ambit and the actions of the petitioner
within the ambit of 1983.
QUESTION:

Like what?

MR. BELL:
