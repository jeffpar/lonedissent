PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-255, Hazelwood School District against United
States.
Mr. Allen, 1 think you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. ALLEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This case concerns charges by the government that
the Hazelwood School District in suburban St. Louis
discriminated against black applicants for teaching positions
in violation of the Civil Rights — of Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
After a trial*, the District Court found the charges
not substantiated*, and granted judgment for the school
district.

The Court of Appeals reversed, and directed the

entry of a remedial order.
In this Court, two questions are raised on review
of the Court of Appeals’ judgments one is whether the Court of
Appeals could legally find a violation of Title VII on the
basis of comparison of the proportion of black members of
Hazelwood's faculty, with the proportion of blacks among
teachers in the whole St. Louis area when

evidence was

4
available in the record, as we contend, to show that
Hazelwood did not discriminate against actual black
applicants for jobs.
The other question is whether, given the findings
and the evidence on which those findings rest, the Court of
Appeals in this case, we submit, lack the element of purpose»
There isn’t any constitutional basis for the application of
Title VII to this public school district.
Since it was formed about a quarter of a century
ago, the Hazelwood School District has grown -—
QUESTION :

But if we disagreed with you on

purpose, the — your question is answered»
MR. ALLEN:

We have no constitutional claim, no.

There’s no doubt, your Honor, that under Section 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment, without regard to the commerce clause,
Congress can enforce the equal protection laws? yes.
The Hazelwood District in 25 years has grown from
a small, rural collection of grammar schools, to a rather
good-sized stihur ban school system.

The area it serves is a

populous, outlying suburb of St. Louis, a predominantly white
suburb.
1954.

There were no black residents in the district in
Consequently, Hazelwood never maintained a system of

separate schools that was required by Missouri law up until
the time of Brown against Board of Educatian^
Thera were 59 black students in the school year

5

1567-63, and nearly 600 out of 25,000 total enrollment in the
school year 1973-74.
Hazelwood hired its first black teacher in 1969»
By the school year 1973-74, 22 of a faculty of about 1,200
ware black.

The official policy of the district since•sometime

before 1964, has been to hire the most competent, the best
qualified teachers, without regard to race, color, or other
extraneous factors.
In the 19605 s, Hazelwood had to engage in rather
extensive recruiting in order to find the most qualified
and most competent teachers it wanted.

At that time, the

demand for teachers was greater than the supply.
Today, recruiting is not nearly so necessary,
Hazelwood, indeed, is deluged with teaching applicants —
applications for teaching positions.
every vacancy.

Ten or a dozen for

These applications are received in a central

office, Hazelwood's personnel office.

There, in that central

office, vacancies are made known by the school principals,
and the central office is asked to refer applicants for
interviews.

And they are referred for interviews without

any real evaluation of their qualifications.
At the individual schools, the interviews are
conducted.

They're conducted by principals, and in some cases

in the secondary schools, by department heads.

They seek

through the interviewing process, to find the best

6
qualified teachers»
Title VII was made applicable to Hazelwood and
other public bodies in Masrch of 1972.

A few months later,

in October, the Justice Department gave Hazelwood notice
that it was considering filing a Title VII case against
it.

The suit was actually filed in August of 1973.

It

alleged a pattern or practice of discrimination against
black applicants for teaching positions in violation of
Title VII, and in addition, alleged violation of the Fourteenth.
Amendment.
The government searched through Hazelwood's files
of applications, employment forms, and the like.

It took

depositions of Hazelwood's top school administrators —
principals, school superintendents, personnel officers, and
so forth.

Exhibits which consisted of copies of the file

material, or were constructed from that file material, were
a principal part of the government's case at trial.
depositions carae in at trial.

The

And in addition, 25 black

applicants for teaching positions testified as to the
circumstances of their applications.
The government set out to prove that Hazelwood had
deliberately, purposefully engaged in a pattern or practice
of discrimination against black job applicants generally.
A showing of a few isolated cases of unfavorable treatment of
individual black applicants for teaching positions would not

7
do# to make the kind of case the government set out to make»
It tried to show — the government tried to show —
that Hazelwood's hiring procedures# this decentralised system
of

Interviewing that I've described, disfavored black

applicants generally.
The fact was that Hazelwood's files showed the
contrary.

Between 1971 and 1973, 17 black applicants were

hired or offered jobs, and 52 were identified by the
government as having been rejected for teaching jobs.

That

was just on the face of it, a much greater proportion of hires
than there were for applicants generally in that period,
So the government adopted as the centerpiece of its
attempted showing of a pattern or practice of discrimination
a comparison, a comparison of Hazelwood's racial composition,
of Hazelwood's faculty, in 1973-74, approximately two percent
black, with the racial composition of the St, Louis city and
county teachers.

In other words, as shown by the census of

.1979, 15 percent of all the teachers in St, Louis City and
county were black,
IN addition, in addition, the government noted
that an ad, a newspaper advertisement for teachers that
appeared in Jackson, Mississippi over Hazelwood's name back
in 1962, with the words, white only, in it, the same ad had
run elsewhere without that notation at the same time, that
Hazelwood had used application forms up until 1962-63, some

8
of which carried lines for racial identification? that
Haselwood had not recruited at predominantly black colleges
in the 19609s, when recruitment was a part of its hiring
process.
In addition, the gover’nment also cited the cases of
the 52 unsuccessful black applicants that it had identified,
and said that they had bean rejected in favor of whites no
better qualified.
Haselwood argued that none of this showed discrimi­
nation.

The District Court agreed.
On appeal, the Court, of Appeals found —
QUESTIONs

Mr. Allen.
*

MR. ALLENs
QUESTIONS

Yes.
Who was the District judge, Judge

Harper?
MR. ALLEN:

Judge Harper, your Honor.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals found that the
discrepancy between the racial composition of HaselwoodSs
faculty and this St. Louis city and county labor market,
taken in light of the what it termed unstructured, standardless»
hiring procedures, with vague and subjective criteria, made a
prima facie caui of discrimination in violation of Title VII.
QUESTION:
Appeals' holding

Mr, Allen, do you understand the Court of

to have rested solely on Title VII, and not

on any violation of the Fourteenth Amendment?
4

9
MR. ALLENs The Court of Appeals recited that there
was the charge of a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment
at the outset of its opinion? it found no such violation in
the course of its opinion.

I think it is fair, Mr. Justice

Rahnquist , to say that the Court of Appeals did not find a
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

It found that this

prima facie case that it based principally on the statistics
of a violation of Title VII was buttressed by these incidents
from Hazelwood's history that I've recited»

and its analysis

of the government's showing of rejected black applicants.
On that analysis» it found that 16 of them» 16
out of 52 of the black applicants, had bean

rejected for

jobs for which whites, no better qualified, had later been
hired.

Andof those 16 -— of those 16 — only two had gone

through the interview process, which was the only part of the
whole hiring procedure of which the Court was critical.

It

did not, in our view — this has become a matter of
contention? but in our view it clearly *— the Court did not
find purposeful discrimination.

And as I've said, in response

to Mr. Justice Relinquish's question, it did not find a
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
We submit that the Court of Appeals erred in
placing its reliance on the work-force labor-market comparison.
My argument on that score is a simple one, I think,
despit e

the impression thatmight be gotten from the rather

10

extensive discussion of the record that appears in the
briefs hare.

Let me try to make it simple.

That sort of comparison, the racial composition of
an employer's work force, and of the racial composition of a
labor market, is — is a — in some circumstances, a valid
test for whether there has been a violation of Title VII.

But

the circumstances simply did not obtain here.
For one thing, the circumstances didn’t obtain
because of the problem induced for the labor market statistics
by the hiring practices of the City of St. Louis schools.
City of St. Louis schools deliberately tried, and succeeded,
in maintaining an approximate fifty-fifty racial balance
between whites and blacks on its faculty.
QUESTIONs

Let me get my geography straight.

Hazelwood abuts on St. Louis County?
MR. ALLENi

Well, it abuts in a sense, your Honor.

The City of St. Louis, as 1 understand it, runs North along
the bluffs of the Mississippi River. And that — there is a
small point there where the Hazelwood District, which
generally lies North of the City of St. Louis, abuts it.
But in no realistic

sense is that a channel of trade or

communication between the two.

It is fairly described as an

outlying district, your Honor.
QUESTION3
know?

Is it part of St. Louis County, do you

11
MR. ALLEN;

It is part of St. Louis County, yes,

your Honor.
QUESTION;

And why do you think ©very black teacher

applicant in the St. Louis area would rather go to St. Louis
than Hazelwood?
MR. ALLEN;

I don't think that is the case, Mr.

Justice Blackmun.
QUESTION;

Well, isn't your statistical analysis

based on that assumption?
MR. ALLEN;

No, I think not, your Honor.

I think

our statistical analysis is based on the propisition that
there are not 15 percent of teachers in the work fores

in -

who are black in St. Louis city and county who are available
for hire by Hazelwood.
The government's position, as

X understand, is,

that the work force comparison is legitimate, because absent
discrimination, it means that that would be the composition
of the employer's work force.

And that situation is simply

not true, here, where one has this distorting effect.

That

is our position in that regard.
But there is really a deeper and more basic flaw
in the use of the work force/labor market comparison in
this case.

At its best, even if constructed validly, that

sort of comparison is a surrogate only for a true comparison
of how an employer has treated black applicants, actual

12
black applicants for jobs on the one hand# and how he has
treated applicants generally on the other hand.
Now# the government does not deny that# 1 don’t
think.

They don't acknowledge it, but they don’t deny it.

And it seems an obvious enough point.
They say that this latter kind

of evidence was

But there was that evidence

in the record## evidence as to the number of applications
generally# and the number of hires generally; the number
of black applicants# and the number of black applicants hired.
And that evidence, as I’ve indicated# showed that blacks
fared at least as well as whites in the periods 1971-72# 197273 and 1973-74.
QUESTION?

tom to.

%

That is exactly what I9m now going to

Because that is the government's principal position

with respect to the applicant flow data# and it's important
to understand.
There were six — there were six black members of
the Hazelwood faculty at the beginning .of the 1971-72

13
school year»

At least 16 were hired by 1973-74, because

there were 22 on the faculty in 1973-74»
QUESTION:

When was it that you found that the

Federal government was after you?
MR„ ALLEN:

In October, 1972, your Honor»

QUESTION:

Could that account for the additional —

MR, ALLEN:

It did not in fact — well, I suppose

it could, your Honor.

The fact was that — there were 13,

according to the District Court, 13 black members of the
faculty in the Fall of 1972.

Presumably before the notification

had been given, although after Title VII was made applicable.
QUESTION:

My question was-

when they haa official

notification: when they found that the Federal government
was moving around.
MR. ALLEN:
1972, your Honor.

As far as I knot*, it was October of

The record doesn't show any earlier date:

I suppose there may have beer an earlier date? I don't know.
The one •— there were 17, all told, in this period
who were either hired or offered jobs.

In that same period,

the government, as I’ve said, identified 52 unsuccessful black
applicants.

The rate of success was about 25 percent on the

basis of those figures.

.»

At the same time, there were 7,800 applications
generally, of whom 54.0 were hired: overall rate of success of
8 percent

14
Now, in addendum A to our reply brief, we have
made allowances for any that — black applicants that may be
missing from among those the government identified.
QUESTION?

Didn't you say in recent years you

didn't have race on the application?
MR. ALLEN:

These data, as I understand, had to

be gathered specially for the government.

In other words,

the identifications were made specifically for this case.
QUESTION;

How was that done?

You know?

You don't

know?
MR. ALLENs
QUESTIONs
MR. ALLEN:

I don’t know.

I know —

I can't imagine how.
Well, let me — Mr. Justice Marshall,

one way that the figures of six —
QUESTION:

One way they could do would be to see

if the student was from Lincoln University? that would be
one way.
MR. ALLEN:
your Honor.

That is with respect to applicants? yes,

With respect to successful applicants, there are

reports formerly to the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare, now the Equal Opportunity Commission, that asked
for a racial breakdown on the faculty.
in the record,

And those reports are

i'hat is where —* but the racial identification

of the applications was made, in part, by the school
district, as I understand it, and part by the FBI , which

IS
went through the school district’s records.
The record, 1 submit,, shows that there are no
significant number of black applicants who were not identifled by the FBI.

The -- all the applications for 1973

and *74 school year, and the 1972-73 school year ware
available to the FBI and the time it conducted its file
search.

Borne from 1971-72.
Haselwood school principals were deposed, their

depositions were taken.

And they were all asked about the

blacks they have interviewed.

The analysis of their testimony

on deposition is in addendum B to our reply brief, and
indicates that at most a vary few black applicants who were
interviewed are unaccounted for.
And 70 percent, on the basis of the figures that
are know, 70 percent of the black applicants who were
interviewed, who were known to have been interviewed, were
identified as having been interviewed, 70 percent of them
were hired.

And that is a larger percentage than obtained

for applicants generally, although that precise figure is
not of record.

It can -- an estimate can be made of how

many interviews there were for the number of hires, and the
proportion would be much less for applicants generally.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Allen, if the District Court — if

you had made this argument to the District Court, and the
District Court had found against you on it and decided to

16
consider just the evidence that the Court of Appeals ultimately
relied on.

And the Court of Appeals affirmed the District

Court's finding as not clearly erroneous.
MR. ALLEN:

No.

Would you —

I think that — Mr, Justice

Rehnquist, that would not be a clearly erroneous type of
finding.

I think this is a question of law, as to the

kind of showing that has to be made, in order to justify
a — make a holding that

a prima facie case has been made

under Title VII.
QUESTION s
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

This is a pattern of practice suit?
Yes, yes, your Honor.
Apart from that, there's two basic types

of Title VII violations, aren't there?

There's the Griggs v.

Duke Rower Co. type, which deals only with effect —
MR. ALisENi
QUESTION:

Yes,

yes.

— deliberate effect.

And then there's

this type, in which there has to be a proof of a discriminatory
purpose; isn * t that right?
MR, ALLEN:

Well, I don't know if the government

would concede that,
QUESTION:

A policy or practice —

MR. ALLEN:

A policy or practice

QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

—- of

diserimination.—

-- of discrimination.
— which has to be proved fey the

17
plaintiff, but aftsr the plaintiff proves certain things,
then it perhaps becomes the duty of the respondent, of the
defendant, to rebut the prima facie case.
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTIONs

Yes.

Well, we would submit

That was — that’s the McDonnell —

that's the basic McDonnell —
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTIONs
MR. ALLEN:

That's correct, your Honor.
And this is the latter type of case.
This is a pattern or practice type of

case.
QUESTION s

This is not a Duke Power kind of case

at all, is it?
MR. ALLEN:

Well, we believe, your Honor, that in

deciding the case on the basis of the — principally on the
basis of the work force/ labor market comparison, the Court
of Appeals decided what amounts to an effects case, regardless
of what the case may have been conceived of by the government
at the beginning? that the Court of Appeals did not itself
draw the further inference of purpose from the findings it
mad®.

And we submit, that given the infirmity of the

statistical showing? given tie refutation

of it in the

applicant flow data that I have been talking about, that no
such finding could have been made.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Allen, what do you do — am

f right, did you say earlier — the District Court found

18

sixteen —
MR. ALLEN:

No, the Court of Appeals.

The

Court of Appeals found sixteen cases, your Honor.
QUESTION:

—- cases of identifiable discrimination.

MR. ALLEN:

Identifiable discrimination, yes, sir.

QUESTION:

That’s in the sense that more qualified

— no more qualified whites were hired?
MR. ALLEN:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan;

yes.
QUESTION:

And you suggest that no significance i s

to be attached to it?
MR, ALLEN:

I don’t suggest there’s no significance.

Let. me state
QUESTION:

Well, why isn’t it dispositive?

MR. ALLEN:
about it.

No, let me state two or three things

First, the government, in opposing certiorari,

suggests that it was of dispositive significance, said that
the judgment could be affirmed on that basis solely.

They

abandoned that position in arguing the merits, and no longer
claim that.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s no answer to me,

MR. ALLEN:
going to say about it.

Wall, that is a preface to what 2 was
The fact is, your Honor, that the

sixteen cases out of fifty two do not establish a prima
facie case of discriminatio», because Hazelwood showed that

19

the hiring procedures that the applicants were subjected to
were operated fairly in the generality of cases»

That is

point one.
QUESTION:

And yet. they — notwithstanding whichr

however fairly they operated, they resulted in sixteen cases
of identifiable discrimination?
MR. ALLEN:

They resulted in sixteen cases of «—

QUESTION:

Well, I can’t imagine — that doesn't

strike ma as a

very fairly operated proceeding.

MR. ALLEN:

What they resulted in, your Honor, was

sixteen cases in which the McBonnel Douglas four point
test was satisfied.

And I suggest that even in a case where

the rest of the evidence was neutral as to the fairness of
the hiring procedures — and that's not this case? in this
case there's positive evidence that the hiring procedures
wore fair — even in another case, the McDonnell Douglas ~
satisfaction of the McDonnell Douglas test does not mean
necessarily or even always reasonably to a finding that there
was purposeful discrimination, and certainly net a pattern or
practice of discrimination.
QUESTION:

If wa disagree, I guess that's the

end of the case.
MR. ALLENs

Well, I think you have to -- to go one

further step, your Honor, and find that these 16 cases, two
of whom were interviewed — only two of whom were interviewed

20
— the; others were — all that happened to them was that
they were not referred for interviews, according to this
mechanical process of
QUESTION ?

referral that I've referred to»
Mr. Allen, assuming that the party

would be unable to get eligible school boards and all of the
principals to admit that they discriminated? assuming that
you couldn't get that, what other evidence could you get?
MR. ALLEN?

In a case like this, Mr. Justice Marshall?

If the applicant flow data that were in the record showed that
a much lower proportion of black applicants were being hired
than white applicants, I wouldn't have any problem with
even inferring purposeful discrimination, if the discrepancy
were great enough inthat kind of case.

But that is not whafe

this record showed.
QUESTION;?/ That would show it?
MR. ALLEN?

By statistics alone?

You certainly can show, by proper sta­

tistics, one can make a case from which purpose can be
inferred.
QUESTION?

That's the trouble — that's the

trouble , isn * t it?
ME. ALLENs
QUESTION?

Well, I —
Mr. Allen, had you finished your

answer to me?
MR, ALLEN?
QUESTION?

I think not quite.
I thought so

21
MR. ALLEN:

You would have to take one further step,

Mr. Justice Brennan, and that is to find that the cases of
the 16 made a pattern or practice by themselves of
discrimination.
QUESTION s
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Even if purposeful.
And purposeful?
Even if purposeful.

MR. ALLEN: Even if purposeful? thafc’s correct,
your Honor.
QUESTION:

In other words, you are suggesting, are

you, that there is —- must be a margin, a tolerance for
mistakes?
MR. ALLEN:

That in a situation of this sort,

where there were thousands of applications each year for
teaching positions, it — not all blacks are going to be
hired, just as not all whites are hired? yes, your Honor,
QUESTION:

You don91 mean thousands of applications

to Hazelwood?
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION;
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Thousands?
Thousands.
The case isn’t over, I take it, if —

even if we agree with you that purposeful discrimination was
not challenged — or found by the Court ofAppeals?
MR. ALLEN:

Well, there are fcwoseparate points,

22
your Honor.

I did not really get to the constitutional

argument.
QUESTION:

No, you haven't answered? the answer

is, no, the case isn't over*

We'd still have to decide

that purposeful discrimination is necessary in order to
sustain the Title VII case.
MR. ALLEN:

No, your Honor, I think that is not

quite what my argument is.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you say?

Title VII is unconstitutional?

Do you say

Unless there is a finding

of purposeful discrimination?
MR. ALLEN:

Unless -- and have evidence to support

that finding.
QUESTION:
MR. ALLEN:
QUESTIONs

All right, so that—
We have urged that, your Honor.
So that if we don't find purpose in

this case, then the Title VII — you say the Title VII —

Cannot constitutionally be applied •—■
Well, that's what I meant.

You haven't

MR.^ALLEN:

I have not argued that, this morning.

I have been — devoted myself to the other point, which I
thought would be better elucidated by counsel's argument.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G, WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THERESPONDENT.
MR. WALLACES

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
We find ourselves in the peculiar position here
of not believing that either of the questions presented in
the petition for certiorari, which this Court granted, is
really presented by this case, unless it can be said that
the second question is presented in a very limited sense.
We went into the District Court in this case, and
introduced evidence to establish a four-pronged showing of a
prima facie case of employment discrimination by the Ha2elwood
School District.

And that four-pronged showing, as we

presented our case, is very well summarised by Mr. Justice
Clarks' opinion for the Court of Appeals set forth in the
Appendix to the petition for a writ of certiorari —
QUESTIONs

Let me ask you, Mr. Wallace —

MR. WALLACES
QUESTION;

~ page 8B,

— since you're referring to Justice

Clark’s opinion, at page 3B, what seems to me a rather
central conclusion of that opinion, at the top of page 3B,
where it says, we have concluded that from its establishment
in 1949-1951, until at least March, 1974, Hazelwood has
engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminatorily failing
and refusing to hire blacks in violation of the Act, and

24
that the United States and certain black teaching applicants
are entitled to reliefs
Now, it's my understanding that the Act as applied
to private individuals was first enacted in 1964, and
that it was made applicable to governmental subdivisions only
in 1972.

Do you support that statement in the opinion as a

correct doctrine of law?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the statement is a little

elliptical.
QUESTION:

Well, it isn't elliptical at all.

MR. WALLACE:

It's elliptical in saying, in violation

of the Act attached to that whole period of time.
of the

The fact

matter is, the school district was under an

obligation under the Fourteenth Amendment not to discriminate
in its hiring practices during that entire period of time,
and the evidence showed a pattern or practice of discrimination
during that period, the portion of which, from March 24th,
1972, was covered by the Act.
QUESTION:

But the ~

What different standard is imposed by

Title VII than is imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION;

Well —

In this kind of case?

MR. WALLACE:

In this kind of case, probably no

different standard substantively.

I don't think this case

Involves any substantiva extension of the Fourteenth Amendment

25
obligation»

1 think that the impact of Title VII in this

case, is a procedural impact in shifting the burden of proof
to the defendant after a prima facie showing of discrimination
has been made.
QUESTION s

Purposeful discrimination?

MR, ULLAGE:

Purposeful discrimination, which is

what's involved in this case, as we understand it.
QUESTIONS

Do you feel that it's a pattern or

practice case?
MR. WALLACE;

That -- we don't believe that the

pattern or practice language of the statute is limited to
purposeful discrimination.

But this case is concerned only

with purposeful discrimination.

I think I can explain this

by briefly discussing these -QUESTION;

Well, suppose w© disagree with you and

agree with your adversary that there was no finding of
purposeful discrimination in this case?
MR. WALLACEs

Do you lose?

Oh, no, I think that it would still

be open for such a finding to be mads in the case, if you're
not satisfied —
QUESTION3

We would stop and remand, then; is that

it?
MR. WALLACE;
about that.

— if the Court was left in doubt

But I don't see any room for doubt about that.

QUESTION s

I understand

26
MR, WALLACES

And then beyond that there is the

question whether the other type of suit would be applied
here.

But I don’t see any basis for conceiving of the

Court of Appeals decision hare as being

.based on the rationale

of Griggs, that unintentional effects from the application of
standards or of tests have to be justified as a business
necessity, because the case never even got to the point of
showing what standard was disqualifying a disproportionate
number of blacks , in statistical showing, to even raise the
question of whether that’s a justifiable standard to have that
effect.
The case, as it's decided here, on the face of it,
involves a conclusion by the Court of Appeals that a prima,
facie showing has been made here; that no explanation other
than race accounts for the showing of the disparate effect,
QUESTION?

Is that a question of law or a question

of fact, in the sense, could the Court of Appeals have said
to the District Court, you said there was no prima facie
showing? we think there is one? therefore, we think your
finding was clearly erroneous?
MR, WALLACEs

Well, it's —* I think it*s fundamentally

a question of law -- of course it‘s mixed with questions of
fact — but it's fundamentally a question of law, whether we
made a prima facis showing of discrimination that stands
unrebutted.

27
Now, let me — this anticipates a little bit the
analysis that I was intending to give hare on page 8B of the
Appendix of the petition of the four-pronged —

of the

shov/ing that we did make in this case.
The first, a history of discriminatory practices
prior to the extension of Title VII to state and local
governments.

And that started off -- and I have to differ

with opposing counsel on that point — with a de jure
discriminatory hiring practice that vras in effect and
required by Missouri law, and in effect in the Hazelwood
District prior to this Court's decision in Brown against
Board of Education.

It5s true, there was no segregation of

students or teachers in Hazelwood,

But Missouri law required

every school district, including Hazelwood, to hire only
white teachers to teach white students, and only black teachers
to teach black students.

And they had nothing but white

students at Hazelwood,
QUESTIONS

Mr, Wallace, do you ™- you rely on that.

I take it, in part, to support a constitutional violation.

But

is that relevant to the Question of whether there was a
statutory violation?
MR. WALLACES

Well, it is? it's part of the background

here to the period in which the statute was in effect.

There

was an enormous momentum of hiring practices built up here,
a

system that was based on the hiring of only white teachers

28
QUESTION :

Well, let me — let me —

MR. WALLACES

— every year, right up to the

statute's enactment, and then during the years after the
statute9 s enactment.
QUESTION:

Are we being asked to decide a

constitutional question here?
MR. WALLACE s
QUESTION:

I don't believe so.

I don't think so.

That's the reason —

it seems to me you go back and forth, and your brief does the
same thing, between a constitutional problem and a statutory
problem.

And I frankly have some difficulty keeping the two

separate.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, part of the obligation arises

out of the situation in which the District found itself.
Because part of what the statute is aimed at is the perpetuation
of past discriminatory practices.

And when you have had a

system set up so that all your feeder teachers institutions
which you’ve been recruiting and hiring over the years are
geared to providing predominantly white faculty, some effort
has to be made to change that pattern of hiring into a
non-discriminatory pattern; yes.,

there is that obligation

at the outset of the statutory period.
QUESTION;

You think the statute imposes an

affirmative obligation to employ more blacks than whites during
'the period, in order to equalize the total —

29
MR. WALLACES

No, not to equalize or employ more

blacks than whites, but to revise the hiring practices in to
a non-discriminatory pattern of hiring, so that if we came
forward with a prima facie showing of discrimination in the
results, both as to particular individuals and in the
overall pattern of hiring, the Stata could show that its
practices are not discriminatory, which they didn't do here.
QUESTION;

Well, to sharpen the point, because I

think it relates to the statistical showing: supposing two
months after the statute went into effect, you brought a suit
a nd you put in evidence that at that particular moment in
time, 99 percent of the teachers were white.

Would that

tend to prove anything?
MR, WALLACE:

Maybe not in itself, without some

indication which this record shows of the quantity of teachers
being hired year by year.
QUESTION %

Well, could we focus on the hiring rate?

Your opponent seems to argue that we should look at the rate
of hire, and then on the rate of hire, the proportion is
.about equal.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, the rate of hire what?

he*s saying the rate of hired applicants.

1 mean,

We don't know the

race of the applicants, and there are serious problems with
'looking only at the applicants, when you have a situation in
which the applicant group may wall be distorted.

30

QUESTION:

But whose burden was it to identify

the race of the applicant?
MR. WALLACE:
prima facie case ,

and

We had a burden of presenting a
we presented a prima facie case that

War partly statistical in nature, but that has nothing to do
with the statistics that opposing counsel is talking about.
Our statistical showing had nothing to do with the treatment
of applicants.

And their contention is based on an interpo­

lation from bits and pieces of the record that were not
designed to make a statistical case for either the plaintiffs
or the defendants.
QUESTION:

Well, I3m just wondering how your

statistical casa differs fromtha hypothetical I gave you, the
two or three months after the Act was passed, there was
evidence that 69 percent of the teachers were white?

Did

you show anything more than that statistically?
MR. WALLACEs

Yes, we went Way beyond two or three

months after the Act was passed,

We went back and forward.

Well, this is all part of tha

I mean, if one considers some of that excessive,

it doesn't detract from what we’ve showed during the '72-'73,
and the “73-'74 period.

This suit was brought early on in the

31
history of the Act’s extension to state and local governments
because there was reason to move in this particular area,
where you had a history of a number of all white faculties
in suburban school districts.
QUESTION:

And this was the largest one.

In other words, you’re submitting that th<

Hazelwood School District, or some other school district,
could be in violation of the Act the moment it was passed.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, not the moment it was passed.

And that really isn’t presented here.
hypothetically in questioning.

That’s been presented

The suit was brought some

time after that, and the evidence had to do with their
hiring practices.

Every one of the sixteen individuals the

Court of Appeals found had been discriminated against in
hiring, those occurrences were during the statutory period,
not during the pre-statutory period.
And the other fifty — the others of the fifty-some
odd

x-fB

presented evidence with respect to, all occurred during

the statutory period.
QUESTION:

You said, then, 32 people hired during

the period that these 16 were discriminated against, you say,
32 hired, there've been 16 whites and 16 blacks hired.

Would

were discriminated agciinst, you say.

QUESTION:

Well, you say they ware equally competent,

they were at least as competent as the ones who were hired,
and the ones who were hired were white.

And that's your

discriminatory showing.
MR. WALLACE:
competent.

Well, it's not just equally

If you look at the findings that are involved

here, there are a number' of instances in which whites who
had been on academic probation and had other — on the face
of it —
QUESTION:

These are findings by the Court of

Appeals —
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

— of fact.

MR. WALLACE:

Of fact presented in the record here,

and not contradicted by anything found by the District Court
in its treatment of these individuals.

The District Court

simply didn't make as detailed a finding x*ith respect to
each of these individuals.

But you'll notice, we've summarized

some of them in the Appendix to our brief, in which there
is instance after instance of an individual who was black,
who applied, who didn't get the job, and then persons who had
been

on probation, suspended, dismissed from college, on

academic probation, had very low grades, et cetera, who were
white, were hired for the same job opportunity.
These are not mild instances.

On the face of it,

33

they indicated discrimination.

And part of what

opposing counsel has been contending here, what petitioners
have been contending, is that their practices themselves are
non-discriminatory.

And as to that, the evidence of pre-Act

discrimination in result is very probative.

Because they're

following the same practice that for years resulted in, first,
an all-white, then a virtually all-white faculty, at a time
when they were under a Fourteenth Amendment obligation not to
discriminate in their hiring practices.
QUESTION:

Well, let me just get it straight, what

your position is, following up on your colloquy with Justice
Stevens.

If two years after the Act was passed, and your

suit was filed, it is shown that since the Act was passed
they've hired twice as many Negroes as whites.

Nov; that

wouldn* t — I take it you would say that would not be an
adequate answer.
MR. WALLACE;

Well, that would ™ that showing

certainly would not be a prima facie statistical showing of
discrimination against blacks.
QUESTION:

Well, I know.

MR. WALLACE:
discriminated against.
QUESTION:

It might be individuals who were
There might be evidence of that.

Well, let’s say that at the time the

Act was passed 90 percent of the employees were white,as a
result of Fourteenth Amendment type discrimination prior to

34
the passage of the Act.

As soon as the Act is passed, the

company starts hiring twice as many blacks as whites.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that hypothetical is very

different from this case.
QUESTION:

Yes — we511 go ahead.

Well, would you say that the showing —-

the actual hirings would be an answer to —
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Well, they might very well.

It might be.

MR. WALLACE:

On the face of it, of course.

You'd have to know something more about the case, but on the
face of it, they might well ba an answer,

Here there wasn't

any answer offered to any of the prima facie case.
part of the difficulty here,

That was

The — after we introduced our

evidence — our statistical evidence, historical evidence,
the evidence of the standard lists — procedures being used,
a nd the evidence of the individua.1 instances of discrimination,
the rebuttal other than simple cross-examination of our
witnesses was summarized by the Court of Appeals at the bottom
of page 7B of the Appendix to the petition quite accurately
as follows: the school district presented one witness aridseveral exhibits.

The witness testified to the total number

of teachers who applied and were hired during the '71-'72 and
'73-'74 school years, and you can see the figures there at the
bottom of page 7B, which indicated hiring in excess of 200
teachers per year during the statutory period.

And the

35

exhibits consist of the policy manual, policy book, staff
handbook and historical summary of the formation of the
Hazelwood School District.
And then, at the top of page 8B, Hazelwood argued
that no discrimination could be proved because equal
employment opportunity was its official policy, and because of
the small number of black teachers was comparable to the
small number of black students enrolled in Hazelwood schools.
Ar.d beyond that, the only defense offered was an
attempt by Hazelwood to contend that it was following a policy
of hiring the best qualified and the vast majority of the
best-qualified applicants were white.

And for that reason,

there was a very small number of blacks, ten up to the time
that Hazelwcod was notified that our investigation was under
way , with that information as footnote 10 on page 7 of our
record.

For that reason, there was a very small number of

blacks hired.
And because that was the defense, our evidence
f ocussad on showing who was hired in place of the unsuccessful
black applicants, introduced extensive evidence with respect
to which of these people hired had poorer academic records,
had been on academic probation, and that sort of thing.
IN buttressing our statistical case, and the rest
of our showing, we did try to isolate some examples of
individuals who were discriminated against.

But we nowhere

36
purported to do an exhaustive study of the application lists
to the extent they were even available in an effort to ascer­
tain what total number of what percentage of applicants had
been black or had been white.

In fact, the United States

expressly, at the beginning of its case on trial, and this
is set out in full, this explanation of our introduction of
any of this material, on page 11 of the brief filed in our
support by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

And there, we

said at the outset of the case, in view of the District's
action severely restricting the pool of available qualified
black applicants, and its practice of destroying application
files after one year, it has not been possible to obtain
facts on all or probably most black applicants to the
District.
And we've collected in our brief, in footnote 93
on page 26, a number of examples of black applicants whose ap­
plications

could not be found by the District, even though

they were during the period when supposedly that the
applications had not yet been destroyed.
QUESTION:

I hope that you know that these were

black applicants, that their files -UR. WALLACE:
OFUESTICK:
MR. WALLACE:

These individuals testified that they
At the trial?
Yes, yes, or were deposed.

Now, what

as this statement went on to say, however we have been able

37
fco locate and identify at least fifty or sixty black
applicants for 1972 andl973 and 1973 and 1974 who, the
evidence will show, applied for positions for which there were
vacancies, emd that Hazelwood consistently hired white
applicants, either less or no better qualified for the vacancies
But the record is actually very sketchy on how we
identified these fifty or sixty, because no defense was
ever made that black applicants were being treated better
than white applicants; the whole defensa was the other way
around, that, the whites hired were better qualified than the
blacks, and that’s why so few blacks were being hired.

And

it wasn’t part of our statistical showing fco try to compare
how the applicant pool was being treated.
So the record doesn’t really show what happened
here in any detail.

But all that did happen was that a

search was mads through the records to pull out some examples
of black applicants based on knowledge of predominantly
black high schools or colleges that they might have attended,
or some other indication on the face of the application .
whether that individual was black.

This wasn’t part of an

effort to build a statistical case.

It was an effort to

identify some particular victims of discrimination, for that’s
part of our prima facie showing, and then interview those
people and in the course of those interviews they’d be
asked, do you know anyone else who was an unsuccessful applicant

3S
QUESTION:

teachers in Hazelwood with the percentage of black applicants
or potential applicants in St. Louis metropolitan area.

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTIONs

Well, what else did it consist of?

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

That was the statistical case,

You mean, that, you say, met your

prima facie burden?
MR. WALLACE:

That was one of the four parts of

our prima facie case, that, in comparison with the other
employers drawing from that employment area, there was a
gross statistical disparity in the number of — in the
percentage of blacks.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Wallace, is it not correct

that if we put to one side for the moment the fourth part of
the test, the 16 specific acts of discrimination, each of the
other three parts of the test would apply equally to my
hypothetical, example two months after

the Act was in effect,

when 99 percent would be white; you would have then proved a
prima facie case.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, if there had been findings of

16 individual instances -

39

QUESTION:

No, no, I'm saying if you put that to

one side.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I'm just saying that your case really

depends on the 16, doesn’t it?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, it's an important part of the

case in the delimited period.

But the period is not as

limited as your hypothetical.
QUESTION:

But is there any difference in —■

MR. WALLACE:

And the statistics have greater

probative value than they would under your hypothetical.
QUESTION:

Well, how is it different in probative

value if you have the same -- precisely the same kind of
statistical evidence?

I mean, it's the number of people employed

as compared with the total number — the percentage in the
labor market.o
which may

And there's a perfectly logical explanation,

be an unhappy one and uan undesirable one, but it'si

a non-statuf.ory explanation for the predominant number of
whites in the labor force at the time.
MR. WALLACE:

The statistics do show that the rate

of hiring is, in itself, under the percentage in the labor
market.
QUESTION:

But the question that this keeps raising

in my mind is, who had the burden of showing —
MR. WALLACE:

The statutory period —

40

QUESTION:

— the make-up of the hiring rate

and

the failure to hire more blacks during the period after
the statute was passed.
MR. WALLACE:

But we showed that in these statistics.

They show, when 284 are being hired altogether, and only 7
or 9, whatever it was, were black, that is way under the 15
percent.

You don’t have to compare it only with the total

work force.

The statistics also show that the rate of hiring

in itself is way under that percentage.

So it's all part of

the prima facie showing that was made here.
The point is that the other attempt to interpolate
from statistics raises evidentiary questions that were
not explored below, not only about how incomplete those
statistics 'were,

but we never introduced any evidence on

discriminatory reputation to show that the applicant flox-/ to
Hazelwood was being distorted, because there was never any
reason to have to introduce that.

The defense wasn't tnat

black applicants were being treated better than white appli­
cants; it wasn’t put in issue in this case.
There is something very similar to what the Court
was referring to in Castaneda v. Rartida in this case f an
attempt to put forward a new array cf a different statistical
case based on untested assumptions that were not explored
below, because the whole theory of the defense was different
below.

And it seems to us that this kind of attempt to rebut

41
our prima facie showing comes too late, when it's based on
evidentiary questions.

And the evidence isn't there.

My time is expired, unless there are further
questions.
