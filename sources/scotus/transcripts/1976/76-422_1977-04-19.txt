MR . CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Evans, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. DANIEL EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. EVANS:
Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

My name is Danny Evans „

I am Assistant Attorney General

for the State of Alabama, counsel for th© appellants.

My co-

counsel with m© today is Mr. Eric Bowen, also of our Attorney
General8s office.

The facts of the case are basically thep®■

Th-5'-’

presents an appeal from a three-judge ruling of the Middle
District of Alabama striking down both a state statute and an
administrative regulation.
Th© case started as two consolidated class actions,
both challenging different areas of Alabama law on constitu­
tional grounds as well as stcitutory grounds tinder Title VII.
This appeal pertains only to the part of th© order which struck
down a height-weight requirement and a prison regulation. Tha
class that is affected by this order challenged a five-foot-two,
120-pound minimum height-weight, requirement that is included in
an Alabama statute for law enforcement officers.

Included

under feat statute are prison guards.

Th© Act also challenged, although th® plaintiff

4
representative was not an fsnployee, an administrative regula™
fcion of t.h® Alabama Board of Corrections which prevented
guards of the opposite sex from working in contact positions
within penitentiaries in Alabama with inmates of the opposite
sex.
The court below found in regard to the statute that
the height-weight minimums on the basis of 1960 statistical
survey had a disproportionate impact on woman, and in that re­
gard and on that basis solely they found that it b© prima
facie discriminatory under Titi® VII and enjoined its further
application»
In regard to the regulation, th© court made no find­
ing of a prima facie showing of discrimination but merely pre­
sented it to be discriminatory and evidently explicitly due to
its application of th© bona fid© occupational qualification
d©£©ns©.
QUESTIOMs
MR. EVANS:
QUESTIONS
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

You don't have the state trooper cases?
No, W© do not.
Only the correction officer?
That’s right, Your Honor.
Do these statistics that you refer to,

taking into account th© eligible fanales and eligible males,
ar© they rastrictad to eligibles in th© sens© of being in th©
labor market or just women generally and man generally?
MR. EVANS:

That's all. Your Honor, just exactly that,

5
and that is on® of the grievances we bring to this Court, is
that the Court look to nearly 14-year-old statistics represent­
ing woman between the ages of 18 and 79 in Alabama.

Now, cer­

tainly they could have taken judicial notice of those facts.
There was no restriction — and you will find this on page 3 2
of the jurisdictional statement — there is no restriction as
to the number of age brackets that would ©van be considered
for the job or the number of people which ware actually in the
labor market itself, and certainly there was no finding as to
actual applicants, as this Court stated should be in Albemarle.
Now, there are several issuas before the Court by
this appeal but, due to time limitation, I intend to address
only three.

From notification of the clerk last Thursday, ha

indicated that, the Court would be interested in hearing a
jurisdictional issue on the province of this appeal at the out­
set.

Now, certainly the Court knows that probable jurisdiction

was noted on November 29th, but. since that time the AFL-CIO
filed an amicus brief challenging some aspects of jurisdiction,
and we are prepared to argue that today.
The second issue that, we contend should be addressed
by the Court is the applicability of Titi® VII to the states.
In. addition to that issue, we intend to argue the correct in­
terpretation of the bona fid© occupational qualifications.
QUESTION;

with respect to what kind of a job here?

What job is at issue here?

6

MR. EVANS:

A prison guard in an all-male prison or

all-female prison with
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

the guard of the opposite s©x.

And nothing with the highway patrol?
No, Your Honor.

This appeal pertains

only to the prison guard classification.
QUESTION:

And what is tha issue there, height and

weight or —
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

There are two issues in
Are they both here?
Yes, Your Honor.

Returning to tha first issue of jurisdiction and the
province of this appeal,'the appellants contend, of course,
that the Court noted probable jurisdiction properly on November
29th.

The grievance of th© AFL-CIO as amix is that, basically,

since Titi® VII was used as the grounds for part of the order ,
and since it could have been used under their assumptions for
the entirety of the order, then the case should not properly be
here as no constitutional finding was mad© by the court below.
At the outset, we world point out a few facts of the
case.

The complaint, the consolidated class action, challenged

Alabama statutes and regulations on statutory and constitution­
al grounds.

Every statute that was brought in was challenged

on constitutional grounds.
The three-judge court order

that pertained to tha

highway troopers, which is not before us, was based solely on

7
constitutions 1 grounds.

It was a complete 1983 action, having

nothing to do with Title VII.
QUESTION:

As a matter of fact, I gather the plain­

tiff tear a could not have brought a statutory action?

Of

course, you never exhausted first, before the commission —
MR. EVANS:

That seems to ha indicated by the record,

yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, it had to be just a constitutional

case?
MR. WANS:
QUESTION:
MR. WANS:
QUESTION:
MR. WANS:

That's correct.
But that is now out of this?
That is out of it.
That is not before us.
That was before the court when its de-

eision to convena a three-judge panel was made.

Also, in per­

taining to this appeal, the regulation which was enjoined was
enjoined on both

Title. VII and. constitutional grounds.

And

the statute which was enjoined bad a constitutional allegation
to it, and we feel that tee court met that allegation.

Now,

from these facte —
QUESTION:

The decision with respect to tee statute

was purely based upon Title VII, was it not?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And the decision with respect to tee

prison guard regulation was based on both?

8
MR« EVANS:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And the. AFL-CXO amicus brief is that a

fortiori it was a Title VII case —
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That's ccorrect, Your Honor.
— in light of Washington v. Davis and

other cases, if it didn't violate Title VII it couldn't possibly
violate hh® Constitution?
MR. EVANS:

In effect, Your Honor, that is their

argument, that the Title VII allegation makes insubstantial
the allegation of constitutiones.lity.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

Now, we feel

And that makes it unnecessary.
Now, w® feel that for several reasons,

including our challenge to the constitutionality of application
to the states of Title VII.

We feel that that is inappropriate

logic, especially dealing with the province of an appeal.

And

previous cases of this Court have held that if substantial con!

stitutional questions are alleged 'in th© complaint, that a
three-judge court should fca convened.
QUESTION:

Furthermore —

I don't think anybody, including any amicus,

is saying that the convention of th® three-judge court was in­
appropriate .
MR. EVANS:

I certainly hope not, Your Honor.

We

contend that it was not.
QUESTION;
of jurisdiction.

But that doesn't go to the question really

3

MR. EVANS:

Well, “the following facts I believe do:

The merits of tha claim were reached in this case, too.

In

fact, on® of tha statutes was enjoined explicitly on the basis
of constitutionality as well as a statutory question- and w©
feel it would be improper for the Court to ignore that deter­
mination.

w© also feel that it would be improper for the Court
*

to feel that a Title VII allegation makes insubstantial an alle­
gation of denial of equal protraction.
This Court recently

in Filbrick v. Glogic found

that even if a court is properly convened and reaches th© merits
of tha case, even if th© final ruling is based totally on
statutory grounds, then that case should be on direct appeal
to this Court, and wa feel that, it does properly lie her®.
The allegation that Title VII makes insubstantial tha
constitutional allegation we feel is remiss with many interpre­
tations of the three-judge appeal.

Hagans v. Lavine , a recent

case by this Court, indicated that that would be th© most
judicial efficiant method of dealing with itr

If a statutory

and constitutional claim are presented, for the single judge
to take the statutory claim, decide it, then take the constitu­
tional claim if necessary and convene a three-judge court.
Now, there are several problems wa

see with that

type of method, lout at the outset I would point out in this
particular case, dealing with equal protection and dealing with
a Title VII equal employment claim, the gravamen of the

&
10
complaint in each is identical»
will be vary similar.

The method of proof in both

The judicial efficiency therefore in

that regard would b© almost nil

of requiring that on© judge

determine a statutory claim and then possibly changing the
rout© of an appeal for one party and then reconvening a threejudge panel.
QUESTION:

Well, the point is that th© plaintiff pre­

vails upon the statutory claim, the constitutional claim is
never reached and the three-judge court is never convened under
th© preferable procedure.
MR. EVANS:

One blatant flav; we see in that, Your

Honor is that if the plaintiff doss prevail on th© statutory
claim and 'th© constitutional claim is never met, then ths de­
fendant, if ha should appeal, has to go through the. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:
ths statutory claim,

That’s right.
If the plaintiff doss in fact fail on
th© court finds that the constitutional

questions are still viable, convenes a three-judge court and
a direct appeal lies to this Court.
QUESTION:
MR, EVANS:

Correct.
So by joining an allegation of constitu­

tionality and a statutory claim, th© plaintiff is assured of a
direct appeal to this Court, whereas the defendant would not
be, and we feel that that would foe a denial of equal protection

11
to the defendant and certainly an improvident interpretation
of section 1253.
QUESTION?

Well, the plaintiff isn't assured of &

direct appeal to this Court if even on the constitutional
claim the injunction is denied on scan® basis other than the
merits of the claim.
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

That's correct/ Your Honor.
So there is no appeal then.

That is

under —
MR. EVANS:

If the merits are met, its standing is

proper, and so forth, it would lie hero.
QUESTION s
MR. EVANS:

Yes.
We feel, however, though, that there are

constitutional challenge to Title VII and its application to the
state is of significance in reaching the merits of even the
insubstantial-substantial argument regarding Title VII and the
Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:
Title VII?

Is that constitutional argument as to

I guess this is on National City grounds»

Was that

mad® below?
MR. EVANS:

No, Your Honor, it was not.

It was not

mad© below nor was it included specifically in our jurisdietIona1 s tatem ent.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't see how that handles your

argument that there is still appeal ability here?

12
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION;

For the simple fact: that —
That issue was nevar tendered and never

decided?
MR. EVANS:

W© feel that th© issue should be decided

by this Court for the simple fact that it has crucial bearing
on the subject matter of jurisdiction of this case and certain­
ly if it is unconstitutional, as ws contend that it is, then
it would destroy any insubstantial argument of th® constitrtion~
al claim.
Turning to that allegation —
QUESTION:
MR. EVANS:

You haven't arguad Filbrick v. Glogic.
Well, Your Honor, in a footnote in

Filbrick v. Glogic , th© Court, I think through Justice
Rhenquist specifically stated that they would not consider
hocemotive Engineers V. Chicago Rock Island Line, where.it was
specifically held —
QUESTION:

Isn't that footnote th© strongest precedent

MR. EVANS:

Yes, Your Honor, and w© contend that that

you have?

does support th© jurisdiction her©.
support the jurisdiction.

W© feel that that does

But turning to ‘th® constitutional

question, which I feel is properly before the Court, it in
basically our argument that the 1972 amendments of Title VII
pose- an unconstitutional abridgement of states* rights under
th© Tenth Amendment, as well as an unwarranted extension of the

13

congressional power.
At th© outset^ Title VII was justified on the
Commerce Claus©; as th© Court I am certain is familiar with.
In 1972, there was a

postscript application to include all

state activities within its coverage.

There was no definition

that the state activities much touched commerce, even in the
most incidental fashion.
QUESTION;

All state activities

Counsel, wouldn't you at least have to

counter claim in th® District Court in order to raise that sort
of a constitutional question, when the plaintiff is challenging
the constitutionality of your own statute?
MR. EVANS;

Your Honor, we raise it her© ora th© basis

of subject matter jurisdiction, and certainly the proper claim
for —
QUESTION;

Well, how do you spell that out?

stitutionality must ba established, and if it is not then th©

MR, EVANS:
matter

We certainly challenged th© subject

jurisdiction and, of course, as I am sure you are

aware, that can be raised at any point.
QUESTION:

But you say subject matter jurisdiction,

I don't get your jump from the unconstitutionality, your claim
of un,constitutionality of Title VII to subject matter jurisdic­
tion,
MR. EVANS:

It is our contention, basically, Your

Honor, that if th© court below was to us© a vehicle of Ti*cl©
VII to declare unconstitutionality or to declare vIdlativ© a
state statute and regulation of Alabama, it would b© without
subject matter jurisdiction to do that if that statutory
vehicle, i.e. Title VII, was itself unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

That is not a matter of jurisdiction —

QUESTION:

They still hav© alleged a claim under

1331 and 3143 that your statute and regulation violate the
equal protaction clause,
MR. EVANS:

Yes, Your Honor, and we feel that those

claims on th© basis of fact shouId b© denied, too.

But her©

ths statute was declared unconstitutional specifically on th©
basis of Titia VII.
QUESTION:;

Well, that is basically what a supremacy

clausa?
MR. EVANS:

Yes, Your Honor.

But we urge that if that,

15
is to be upheld, the constitutionality of Title VII must also
be examined to find out if the court had subject matter juris­
diction to entertain that allegation.
QUESTION;

Well, if I may say so, perhaps I am obtuse

on this but it -seems to me that was a matter of defease for you
to assert in the District Court that the claim was that your
practices violated Title VII, put to one side for th© moment
the claim that they were unconstitutional, but that your statute
and regulation violated Title VII.

And if you want to say in

defensa of that that Title VII is unconstitutional, that is for
you to say in defense on th© merits, but it has nothing to do
— and then it is up to th© court, to decide it, the District
Court, in the first

instance — it has nothing to do with th®

jurisdiction of idle District Court, does it?
MR. EVANS:

It would have nothing to do with thes

jurisdiction of -she District Court pertaining to the constitu­
tional claim, I agree*, Your Honor.
QUESTION3

No, no, to this Title VII claim.

You are

asking the District Court to hold that Titia VII is unconstitu­
tional as applied to you.

That is something for you to assert

in defans© on the merits of the claim against you.
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION;

Well, Your Honor —
It has nothing to do with th© jurisdiction

of the court.
MR. EVANS:

QUESTION;

Do you think that this Court, for example,

is without jurisdiction to hold something is unconstitutional?
}

MR. EVANS:
QUESTION;

No, Your Honor, I certainly do not.
Well, what doss it have to do with the

jurisdiction fpf the court?
MR. EVANS:

By the simple fact that the allegations

and the basis of the ruling of the District Court ware based on
that statute.
QUESTION;

Yes, and ~

But all statutes of Congress are presumed

constitutional
MR. EVANS;
QUESTION;

They certainly ax-©.
— and if you haven't challenged them at

all in the District Court, I wouldn't spend a lot of time argu­
ing a point like that up her©, if I war© you.
MR. EVANS;

Well, Your Honor, I will certainly proceed

with other arguments in that c&s©.

But w© do earnestly contend

that that is a viable issue before the Court and that it has
been briefed and the Solicitor General has been notified of it.
QUESTION:

You have only got 13 minutes to discusa

the merits of the case.
MR. EVANS;

I will proceed directly there, Your Honor.

The third issue which I intended to address today

17
deals with the province of a finding of a bona fide occupa™
tional qualification for contact positions within penitenti­
aries only in Alabama .
At the outset, as w© have just argued, we feel that
Title VII is inapplicable.

Hovrever, the factual considerations

that would uphold it under equal protection analysis and under
Title VII we feel would justify it as a bona fide occupational
qualification.
The court below found it violative of both equal
protection and Title VII.

Nevertheless, even if this Court

should find that Titi® VII is applicable and should also fits!,
as the court below evidently assumed, that it is priraa facie
discriminatory, we feel that the facts below justify the
defense of a bona fide occupational qualification.
We don’t urge a broad reading of this statute.
of the amicus have challenged that.

Many

We don’t urge that it

face the very purpose of the statute, and w© don’t challenge
the good intent of the Congress in this regard.

But if the

bona fide occupational qualification is to be given anything
more than an imaginary existence, certainly the facts of this
casa warrant it.

The facts surrounding th© regulation are

these:
The regulation was promulgated by the Board of Cor­
rections of Alabama only after the solicited advice of the
General Counsel for the EEOC.

It is not arbitrary.

It doesn't

18

just leave it up to op®n discretion.

It sets forth several

criteria to be used in determining whether a contact position
within a penitentiary should b© subject to requiring a guard
of a like sex with inmates.

It is limited only to contact

positions and Limited only to penitentiaries.

Alabama peni­

tentiaries are unique in themselves, as I am sure are all peni­
tentiaries within each state, and certainly —
QUESTION:

What is a contact position?

MR. EVANS:

A contact position in Alabama, Your

Honor, within the brief on page 5G they are laid out.

They

hav© five criteria that deal with the position, that define it
as the regulation did* basically whether they would be in di­
rect contact with the inmates of the opposite sex without any­
one els© around and requiring invasions of privacy, no other
protection, and so forth.
Now, in reference to the justifiability of this
particular regulation, wa point out some peculiarities about
Alabama's system.
dormitory.

The penitentiaries in Alabama are open

They are not single-cell occupied.

They have open

coamuna 1 * toilets, to allow open view into the penitentiaries
.

by the patrolling guards.
Alabama penitentiaries.

We hav© multiple offenders only in
We have other facilities that house

first offenders and youths.
Twenty percent of the population are sa offenders.
w© have farming operations at at least two of the four

19
facilities that require extensive strip searching and hat
searching, and -guards are used interchangeably in all the po­
sitions in the prisons, for several reasons, to promote their
familiarity with institutions and also because of a shorgag©
of manpower.
Now, the State of Alabama is not intending any type
of discrimination toward women in regard to its use of females
or of males in contact positions.

The state has been using

women in minimum security institutions since 1974,

They have

used them in work release centers, in youth facilities, and w©
have encountered several difficulties in those facilities, but
nevertheless the overriding considerations of equal employment
opportunity, w© have used them in those facilities.
The Board of Corrections, it is our contention, in
promulgating Regulation 204, deals with real concepts.

They

can't assume that inmatcss within the State of Alabama peni­
tentiaries view every individual along equal protection lines.
They are dealing with the stereotypes that are perceived by
the inmates within Alabama.

They hav© certain goals.

mast make sure the institutions are secure.
sure they have control of it.

They

They must male©

They must make sure that the

inmates sure safe and that their employees are safe.

And these

require realistic appraisals of the facts before them.
And v:?; feel that the record below dealing with
Commissioner Locke’s deposition, who is Commissioner of our

20
Board of Corrections, recognizing the sexual stereotypes, the
innate attraction of multiple offenders who have bean long in­
carcerated to a female's presence, or vice versa, are necessary
and realistic concerns, and that these certainly justify the
regulation.
Th© evidence that was proposed to the contrary below
does little we feel to impeach that.

Th© experts that testi­

fied, starting with Mr. Nelson — Mr. Nelson is th® Director
of a minimum security institution in. Chicago.

Now, that in­

stitution houses persons with less than a year to serve.
has been using woman there for six months.

He

They ar@ single

cell --- it is a single-cell institution* the toilets are not
communal, they are divided off, and the inmate/staff ration is
considerably less.

They have -- but primarily it is the fact

of th© type of institution -that wa are dealing with.
Now, from his six months appraisal, he said they
have been good.

But he admitted that the federal system, of

which he is a part, does not use women in the penitentiaries
in contact positions, and for obvious reasons that we feel are
adequately proposal today.
Mr. Sarver, the other expert before the court below,
had never sup@rvi.sad women in any penitentiary, although he
had b©an warden of two.

He had never known of any such situa­

tion. of women being in contact positions in penitentiaries, but
nevertheless he was sure that they would be very capable and

21
would add to the normalization of the prison system.

Well, we

feel that this is simply not credible evidence to impeach the
correctly promulgated regulation of the state.
QUESTION:

The whole issue ©n the merits of th® Title

VII issue is whether or not this is a bona fide occupational
qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of
th© particular business or enterprise, isn't it?
MR. EVANS:

Dealing with Regulation 204, it is, Your

Honor.

That is correct.

Th© regulation was

QUESTION
MR. EVANSs

To whom doss the regulation apply?
It applies to prison employees, th©

guards ~~

It. applies to people, anybody who wants to

MR. EVANS;
QUESTION:

Wall, Your Honor, it —
Well, aren't these assignments mad© from

the trainee register?
MR. EVANS:

The assignments as a corrections coun­

selor, this regulsation was to certify correctional counselors
in those positions.
QUESTION:

And so to certify them they come off the

trainee register?
MR. EVANS:

Initially it did, Your Honor, but that

has bean changed.
QUESTION:

Well, how do you get on the trainee

register?
MR. EVANS:

The trainee register has — you have to

satisfy the height and weight requirements, and that is the
difference.
QUESTION;

The regulation deals very frankly with

sex, with gender, if you will ■—
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:
MR. EVANSs

It is a combination of ~~
— the height and weight requirement?
That's right.

QUESTIONS

This is frankly a gender based distinction

MR. EVANS:

It deals with a combination of sex, that

is exactly right, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

It distinguishes between females and males

as such?
MR. EVANS:

Exactly, Your Honor, ami we feel the

court below ignored the factual differences of the institution

23
and of th© institutions that the experts testified about.

And

the fact that Alabama uses women in its minimum security in­
stitutions and has longer than any institution that was pro­
posed by the plaintiffs,

should not be found as an inconsistent

position with recognising the factual difference between a
minimum security work release center and a penitentiary for

QUESTION:

Well, were any of these plaintiffs in this

case on the register?
MR. EVANS;

No, Your Honor.

I didn't handle the case

at trial but I would challenge here if I felt, it would preserve
the standing of then to ©van challenge Regulation 204.
QUESTION:

Well, they have to get on the register

before they are ever even eligible to be selected for a
counselor?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Exactly, Your Honor.
And to get on the register they have to

satisfy height and weight requirements?
MR. EVANS:
QUESTION:

Exactly, Your Honor.
And how do you ever* reach the Title VII

case then without —- until you decide whether the height/weight
issue is -- you have to decide that, first, don't you?
MR. EVANS:

To decide their standing, probably not,

Your Honor, because a person is not an employee and I wouldn’t
think would have standing in any case to challenge that

24

regulation.
QUESTION?

Wouldn't that regulation mean that the

height/weight implicitly inherently involve s@.x discrimination
because of the generality of men &r© bigger than the general­
ity of women?
MR. EVANS:

That's it, Your Honor.

That is exactly

right.
QUESTION:

But if you could withhold th© height and

weight requirements, wouldn8,o that be the end of the case as to
these particular plaintiffs, because if they couldn't have met
the height and weight requirements they could never have gotten
on th© trainee register and therefore they never would have
had to have confront the sexually described classification?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. HOROWITZ, ESC-/
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MS. HOROWITZ:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I am Pae la Horowitz, counsel for appehlee Dianne

Rawlinson.
As the Court has requested, I will initially address
Idle jurisdictional point raised by one of the amicus briefs.
The, appellees' position is simply that under its prior holding
in Locomotive Engineers v. Chicago, Rhode Island, and Pacific
Railroad, this Court clearly has jurisdiction of this appeal
under 1253; and as recently as 197 5 in Filbrook v. Glogic,
this Court refused to reconsider the Engineers doctrina, and I
would submit that there is no reason for that doctrine to be
reconsider'ad now.
Turning if I may then to the merits of the Title VII
issues in this case, there are two Title VII questions.

The

firinvolves the validity of height and weight requirements
for employment as a prison guard in the Alabama system.

The

second involves the validity of an administrative regulation
which in effect provides that only like sex guards shall work
in the state's prisons.
QUESTION:

Do you represent a single individual

plaintiff, do you?
MS. HOROWITZ:

She represents a class, Your Honor,

which was certified as all women who are employed,might be

26

employed, or are applicants for employment with the Board of
Corrections.
QUESTION:
a certain weight?

Who are under a certain height and under
Is that in the class?

MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

No, Your HOnor.

Well, it would have to be, woudln't it,

otherwise they would have no claim?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Well, the individual plaintiff in this

case did not meet the weight requirement.
QUESTION:

Right, and the class she represents there­

fore, I would suppose, would not meat either the weight or the
height requirement, one or the other, or else they would be a
class without a grievance?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Well, she -- I would submit that she

clearly has -QUESTION:

Well, what was the class that was certi­

fied?
MS. HOROWITZ:

As 1 stated to you, that was. hew the

court certified.
QUESTION:

How?

MS. HOROWITZ:

As all women who are employed, might

be employed, or are applicants for employment with the Board of
Corrections for the job of prison guard.
QUESTION:

Well, many such women would not be

affected by the height and weight statute.

27
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION"

That's true.

And how could they be members of the

class ?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Well, they are members of the class

for purposes of challenging Regulation 204, because they are
clearly affected by the administrative regulation which exeludes women from working in the male facilities.
QUESTION:

If they never got on the roll -- if, as

my brothers have pointed out, the height and weight requirement
is valid, then your named plaintiff never gets on the roll and
is never in a position to challenge the regulation, right?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION;

That’s correct, Your Honor.

I take it that your point about the women

is that if women who are six feet tall and .150 pounds can't,
qualify for the inside so-called contact positions, than is
really a subclass, is it, of your general class?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Yes, I would say that they are a

class of women that are clearly included in the class as it was
certified by the District Court, and that —
QUESTION:

All females would have — all women would

have been in a position to challenge the regulation?
MS. HOROWITZ:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Now, with

respect to the validity of the height and weight requirement,
it is appellees' position that, as a facially neutral job
qualification, the height and weight requirement is governed by

28
this Court’s decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. and the
rationale ©f that case was correctly applied by the District
Court in the case sub judice.

The allocation of the burden

under Griggs in cases where you are dealing with a facially
neutral job qualification is the plaintiff bears the initial
burden of proving upon the facia .. case by showing that the job
qualification in issue has a substantial disparate impact on
women.
QUESTION:

Ms. Horowitz, before you go on, which sub­

section of 2G00s-2(a) were you claiming under in your Title VII
claim, section 1 about failure -- if you will turn to page 61
of the appellants' brief, you are probably so familiar with
them that you don't have to, but subsection 1 talks ciboet fail­
ing or refusing to hire, and subsection 2 talks about limiting,
segregating, or classifying.
MS. HOROWITZ:

Subsection 1, Your Honor, is relied on

for purposes of ths height and weight requirement, and subsea-tien 2 for purposes of the Regulation 204.
QUESTION:
1anguaga,

They ar© case in somewhat different

ar en’t they?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, I agree, they are,

Subsection 2 more resembles th© language

of the section that was involved in Griggs, than subsection 1?
MS. HOROWITZ:

But I don't think there is anything in

th© ratio.uala of Griggs that would limit it to cases brought

29

under subsection 2.
QUESTION5

You are referring to the rationale rather

than the holding?
MS. HOROWITZ:
questions

Pardon rae?

I say you are referring to th© rationale

rather than th© holding?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Correct.

I think that the import of

Griggs is that Title VII looks to th© consequences of employ­
ment practices and not to the motivation, and so that Griggs
becomes the appropriate analysis whenever you have a showing
that a facially neutra1 job qualification has a disparate im­
pact on a, protected class.

And in this case the plaintiff

made that showing, since the statistics indicate that when com­
bined the height and weight requirements disqualify 41 percent
of the women as opposed to less than 1 percent of the men.
QUESTIONi

Well, when v;e say women, women who are

looking for these jobs or just women in Alabama as a class?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Your Honor, the court below railed on

th® statistics which ar® national statistics of women 18 tc 79.
There are —
QUESTION:

All woman between 18 and 79 ar© not in the

job market, are they?
MS. HOROWITZ:

That's true, Your Honor, and I would

concade that there is nothing in th© statistical evidence pre­
sented to the court below to show the actual effect on

30
applicants of the height and weight requirement, but —
QUESTION:

Why wasn't that evidence presented?

It

is certainly available somewhere»
MS. HOROWITZ:

Well, I would submit, Your Honor, that

it is not easily available and that it should not be required
as part of the plaintiffs' evidentiary burden under Titi® VII,
because this is a height and weight requirement, I would sub­
mit, as a self-defining qualification, and it discriminates,
its evil is not only in the fact that it discriminates against
anybody who applies and is rejected for being under the mini­
mum, but it d is or iminat© s against all those who know of the
minimums and do not apply because they do not mast them.

It

is unlike a test or an interview or those kinds of job qualifi­
cations where a potential applicant cannot know whether or not
he will be — he or she will be disqualified until h© or she
actually undertakes the test or the interview.
QUESTION:

Ms. Horowitz, what worried me about this

case is if Alabama wanted to discriminate against woman, they
did it, they said no woman could b© hired, so what good is the
weight and height there?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

Wall, because the regulation ■—

Why would they waste that?

They have al%

ready said they can't have a woman —MS. HOROWITZ:

But hfc-3 regulation which says that

woman cannot be hired applies to the all-male penitentiaries .in

31

the state.

They were hiring only sinea 1954 — 1974, excuse

me.
QUESTION?
combine the two.

Yes, but that is what worried me, when you

I mean when they — as I understand the

statute, when Alabama wanted to say wa won't hire women, they
said "we won't hire women."
t

MS. HQRQWITZs

With r©spact to the four male peni­

tentiaries .
QUESTION:

Well, they knew how to say it?

They knew

how to say it?
MS. HOROWITZ:

That is correct, Your Honor, but I

think it is also interesting to point out that Regulation 204
was promulgated while this law suit was pending.
QUESTION:

Don't you think they can say they can put

in a weihg and a height restriction of sane sort?
MS. HOROWITZ;

Not when it shown to have a disparate

impact on a protected class under Title VII unless they show it
to b© job related,
QUESTION:

Well, could they say that they will net.

hir© anybody weighing more than 400 pounds?
MS. HOROWITZ:

I think that they can have — that

nothing in the court’s decision —.
QUESTION:

Thera is nothing wrong with that.

MS. HOROWITZ:

I think nothing in the court's decision

prohibits them from having proportional height and weight

32
requir ©nent s.
QUESTION:

Could they also say we won’t: hire anybody

over the age of 55?

With the approval of this Court, they can

say that, can’t they?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:
MS.

I would say they can and they do.

This Court, said so.

HOROWITZ:

But when the burden shifted in this

case to th® state to prove that the height and weight require­
ments were job related, I would submit that the state not only
failed to carry its burden of showing that any height and
weight requirements were related to the efficient performance
%

of the duties of a prison guard, but they certainly failed to
prove that these particular height and weight requirements had
any relation to the duties of a. prison guard.

They admitted

that there was no meaningful study conducted prior to the ap­
plication of the particular requirements of five-two and 120 -QUESTION:

Do- you think the Court could not take

judicial notice of the proposition that height, weight,

sloe

as a direct relationship to performing a function of a prison
guard?
MS. HOROWITZ:

I think that that is permissible and

that that is basically what the District Court said, because the
District Court said that -QUESTION;

This Court can do it, too, can't it?

MS. HOROWITZ:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think

33

that, the conclusion that you reach is the same because, as
the District Court did it, even assuming that height and weight
do have some relationship to strength and that strength is a
facet of effective job performance as a prison guard, there is
absolutely no proof that anybody below the arbitrarily defined
level of five-two and 120 pounds is unable to perform.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that traditional and usual

line-drawing process to which we have said many, many times
that any such line invariably excludes some that might well be
included and includes some that might properly be excluded?
MS. HOROWITZ:

I don't thixik, Mr. Chief Justice,

that this Court, has permitted that in Title VII cases.

In

Griggs this Court said that in going after -—
QUESTION;

Well, that had nothing to do with —-

MS. HOROWITZ:

— arbitrary and unnecessary barriers

to discrimination.
QUESTION:
job requirement.

Griggs had nothing to do with this kind of

What if they had said 100 pounds and four-

feet-eight, that would be all right, would it?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Depending on the proof that they

offered.
QUESTION:

Well, I am speaking —

MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:
firs:, instance,

The burden is on the state —

I am speaking of the regulation.

he state needs no proof.

In the

It can be a subjective

decision based upon general experience,

tod suppose they said

four-feet-eight and 100 pounds, would you have any quarrel
with, that?
MS. HOROWITZ:

It would depend on what kind of proof

the state introduced.
QUESTION:
volved.

No, they made a regulation, no proof in­

You don’t need any proof to make a regulation.
MS. HOROWITZ:

I wouldn't have any quarrel under this

case.
QUESTION;

That is what I am talking about.

You

wouldn’t have any quarrel, so the issue resolves itself to
allowing what you don’t like as comparing to allowing what you
would find acceptable.

It is on the wrong line, that is vcur

case, isn’t it?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

They have drawn an arbitrary line.

Well, four-feet-eight and 100 pounds would

b© just as arbitrary* wouldn’t it?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Well, I am not conceding to you that

that would be permissible.

I am only saying that it would not

necessarily be precluded by the. Court's decision to strike
d own five-two, 120.
QUESTION:

Let’s pursue your other proposition.

The

four-feet-eight and loo pounds would not exclude all the women
that you have been concerned about?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Well, then you never reach the question

35

if you cannot show the disparity, that that burden is on the
plaintiff, and if there is no disparate impact on a protected
class then there is no discrimination.
QUESTION;

That brings us around the circle again.

The state can draw a line, four-feet-eight and 100 pounds would
be tolerable a line, but five-feet-two, is it, five-feet-two
and 120 is an unacceptable line because of its exclusionary
operative effect?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Ms. Horowitz, can you give me the name of

any police force or prison guard system in the country that,
doesn't have a weight and height requirement?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Yes, Your Honor, the evidence in this

case shows that the federal prison system uses no height and
weight requir ements.
QUESTION:

I meant stat©.

MS. HOROWITZ:

I thought I said stats.

Among state systems, I do not know,

but it is my understanding from the amicus brief filed by
California that California does not.
:

QUESTION.

I was just, wondering hew many police

systems we will upset if we go along with you,
MS. HOROWITZ:

Well, I would concede to this Court

that the us© of height and weight minimums are quite common,
among law enforcement agencies, but I don't think that that is
a permissible ground for upholding then under Title

vii.

36

QUESTION?

Well, I just: want to know what we are

dealing with.
MS. HOROWITZ:

But it is my understanding that there

are a number of law enforcement —• the vast majority of law
enforcement agencies do use minimum height and weight require­
ments, and there is at the present time I believe a lot of
litigation, pending litigation dealing with the validity of such
minimums.
QUESTION;

Did you undertake to show how many inside

guards in contact positions in the federal system were under
120 and five-feet-two or four, whatever it is?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Not in the entire system, no, Your

Honor, but -QUESTION;

Wouldn't that have been quite relevant if

you now stand on it?
MS. HOROWITZ:

I don't think so, Your Honor, because

we did not rely on the failure of other systems to us® — to
not use height and v/eight requirements in proving our case to
the court below,,- and that is not necessary to an affirmance of
that court's holding.
QUESTION;

Ms. Horowitz, I am correct, am I not, that

both the height and weight requirements, that was struck down
under Title VXI?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.

And the other issue was also a Title VII

37

issue, namely bona fid© occupational qualification, is that so?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION;

That’s correct.

The only issues we have, both of thorn are

Title VII issues?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

No constitutional issue at all?

MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION;

That's right.

That's right.

Who was it that wanted to be a prison

guard, what name?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

R awlins on.

MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

Rawlinson.

Yes.

And she was the one who was excluded be­

cause of height and weight and contact -- and she is the one
who has perfected the procedural steps?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

And Mrs. Mieth has perfected them?

MS. HOROWITZ:

No.

Her claim — she was suing the

Department of Public Safety for a trooper position, and she
comes under the constitutional claims only.
QUESTION:

Her case is not here?

MS. HOROWITZ:

That’s correct.

This is only Title

VII, which brings us to -QUESTION:
where I am confused.

But she also applied?

Maybe this is

She wanted to bs either a state trooper

30
or a corrections officer,
MS a HOROWITZ:

is that it?
No.

Mi eth wanted to be a state

trooper; Rawlixison wanted to be a correctional officer.
QUESTIONs

Well, the one who wanted to be a state

trooper is no longer in the case at all?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Right.

The Department of Safety chos®

not to appeal.
QUESTION:

We have only one named plaintiff left?

MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

And that is who?

MS. HOROWITS:
QUESTION:

Dianne Rawlinson.

So the docket says Mieth -—

MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.

So the name of the case is —

— but Mieth is not in it now?

MS. HOROWITZ:

That is correct.

Turning to the merits of the other Title VII claim in
the case, that

is whether Regulation 204 canes within the EFQQ

defense, it is appellee’s position that, since it is clear
that all of the indicia of the proper construction of the BFOQ
defense point to the fact that it is an exception 'which is to
be narrowly construed, I would propose to this Court that the
standard which should be formulated to determine th© applic­
ability of the defense is whether the classification seeks a
permissible objective and whether it is necessary to 'the
achievement of that objective.

39

Congress used the word "necessary" in defining a
BFOQ, i.e., that which is reasonably necessary to the effective
operation of a business or enterprise, and I think that this
standard is the appropriate one for allowing the ©up 1 oyer to
come within the exception when the evidence warrants it, but
making sure that the exception is not allowed to swallow the
rule.
Now, applying that standard to the facts in this
case, I would submit to the Court, that the District Court was
clearly correct in refusing to apply the BFOQ defense.

The

first justification advanced by the state in support of Regula­
tion 204 was that women would be unable to safely and efficient­
ly perform the duties of a prison guard.
Mow, that is clearly a permissible objective.

In

other words, the plaintiff does not argue that it is permissible
for the State of Alabama to want to have a safe and efficient
work force in its prisons.

The question then becomes whether

or mot Regulation 204 is necessary to the achievement of that
objective.
QUESTION:

This has to be addressed in the context of

this type of penitentiary, all male, housing only multiple
offenders, is that right?
MS. HOROWITZ:
QUESTION:
related offenses?

That's correct.

I would

QUESTIONS

I thought that —

QUESTION:

That was in the record.

MS. HOROWITZ:

I think it is in the opinion as th©

state alleged that 20 percent of the offenders are sex offenders,
but I wouldn't quibble over it because I don’t think —
QUESTION:

Certainly some are?

MS. HOROWITZ:

I would concede that some are.- and I

don’t think it makes a difference to tha determination.
QUESTION:

What percantaga, if this record shows it,

ara in these institutions for crimes of violence?
MS. HOROWITZ:

I don’t think tha record shows th©

percentage, but it is clear that a number of them ara, if not
th© majority.
QUESTION:

Th© majority.

It is true

of

most state

prisons in the country, isn’t it?
MS. HOROWITZ:

But I would submit that th© burden was

on th® state to offer factual objective data that women could
not. perform in this kind of prison setting, and that that proof
is simply not in this record.
Thar© is a reliance on sexual stereotypes, which is
clearly not permissible under Title VII, in an effort to com©
within the BFOQ defense.
QUESTION:

There is —

Wasn't the reliance rather on th® prisoners'

41
sexual stereotypes?

MS. HOROWiTZs

Th©r@ were allegations to that effect,

Your Honor.

QUESTION^

Well, wasn't that fch© reliance on the

efoq

defense, that the prisoners would hav© this image about female
custodians?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Well, I think it was also clear from

the testimony that the prison administrators who testified in
this case agreed that women war© innately incapable of — I
mean that the Commissioner of Prisons testified that women are
sex objects.
QUESTION?

That in th© view of incarcerated adult

mala prisoners, who are all guilty of multiple offenses, that
— wasn't the BFQQ defense premised upon th© attitude of those
prisoners toward women guards?
MS. HOROWITZ:

Wall,

I would submit, Your Honor, that

that was only a part of th© argument.
QUESTION:

Well, was; it a part or not?

MS. HOROWITZ:

Yes, it was a part, but I donit think

that what th© state attempted to rely on
QUESTION:

I thought it did in its argument, and then,

of course, you countered with the cases saying that custom or
stereotypes cannot bs relied upon in the Steward and steward wa»s
cases.

I was going to ask you if this isn't a little different

from custom, if this is the natur © ©£ an incarcerated human

42

being ?
MS. HOROWITZ-;

Y©s, I would not analogize it to

custom or preference.
QUESTION?

You do that in your brief.

MS. HOROWITZ?

I think that -- well, that was not my

intention, if that is how it was read.
QUESTION:

I am glad you --

MS. HOROWITZ:

The way I would handle custom or

preferences under the formulation I suggested to the Court to
deal with the BFOQ defense, that being whether the classifica­
tion seeks a permissible objective, that if the defense is
customer preferences, that is not a permissible objective
under Title VII and you don’t go beyond that point.

But I am

not attempting to analogis® prisoners to customers by any means.
I think that that comes in in the — in terms of dealing with
the justification advanced by the state dealing with the privacy
needs of the prisoners.
If I may just summarize again the evidence presented
on the question of whether or not woman can safely and efficient
ly perform these jobs, it is appellees’ intention that the
state did not offer any factual data to establish that women in
fact cannot perform, that -they relied in no small measure on
sexual stereotypes, that the evidence established and the
District Court found that women were working satisfactorily in
contact positions in the non-penltentiaries, that this District

43

Court was unusually familiar with conditions in the Alabama
penitentiaries because Judge Johnson, ©ns of the members of
the three-judge court, had just handed down a ruling dealing
with conditions in these prisons, and that this three-judge
court unanimously found that the evidence just was not there
that women could not perform, and that that requires an af f Irmance.
And even though the burden was clearly on the defen­
dants to prove women could not perform, it is also to to noted
that the plaintiff introduced expert testimony from prison
administrators that women were performing in this capacity
elsewhere and in a satisfactory manner»

The height, and weight requirements.

MS. HOROWITZ:

No, Your Honor.

Tha justification

attempt©! there was th® relationship that tha height and wight
minimums bare to strength, but there was no assertion of BFOQ
as an affirmance defense.
QUESTION;

Thera was not?

MS. HOROWITZ:

No.

And it is the position of the

appellee that the District Court proceeded correctly because
I would submit to this Court that when you are dealing with a
facially neutral job qualification, Griggs is th© standard.
When you are dealing with gender based discrimination such as
we find in Regulation 204, then th© BFOQ defense is the standard.

If it is not pleaded, since th© burden is on th© defend­

ant, that ends th© case.
QUESTION:

I

MS. HOROWITZ:

S@@.

If I may quickly also address the

45
second justification advanced by the stata in support, of
Regulation 204 which was the privacy need3 of prisoners, again
I submit to this Court that the proper question to ba asked is
whether Regulation 204 is necessary to the achievement of the
stated objective.

Again, I would concede it is permissible,

that there ar© privacy needs which the prison administrators
rightly should concern themselves with.
Our position, howsvsr, is that the state failed to
prove that Regulation 204 was necessary to the achievement of
this objective because the evidence is clear that the sexual
aspects of th® job which are basically strip searches can be
separated from th© non-sexuai aspects, and th© state attempted
fc© offer no reason at all why it could not achieve its objec­
tive as th© District Court suggested, that is toy selective
work responsibilities as opposed to th© total exclusion of

•«omen »
Indeed, we ar© dealing primarily with th© four male
penitentiaries and the evidence reflected that in two of these
facilities no systematic strip searches ar© conducted, and in
th® other two less than 25 parcent, of th© work force is in­
volved in systematic strip searches.

QUESTION;

Well, isn't that judicially noticeable;

when you heard the recitation of th® facts?
MS. HOROWITZ:

I don’t think it is? Your Honor, when

th© facts include th© evidence that in th© non-penitentiaries
Alabama is employing women in contact positions and th© only
restriction that they have placed on the women is that they
not conduct strip searches, they are patrolling, they are con™
ducting hathroon inspections, and I don’t see how the state
can admit on the on© hand to evidence showing that women do
that work in non-penitentiaries and then come back and somehow
say, well, they can’t do it in penitentiaries.

So that would

b© my reason for saying that the only thing tills Court needs
concern itself with with respect to the privacy issu®, is th®
systematic strip searches, and that the evidence in this case
clearly indicates they can ba handled as th© District Court
ruled they should be, and that, this is the proper standard
under th© BFOQ defense.
Thank you

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS

Very well.

Mr. Evans, do yea have anything farther? '
ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. DANIEL EVANS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL
MR. EVANSs
things to state.

May it pleas© the Court, I have a few

I didn't mean to imply, Justice Marshall,

that the prison in Chicago is a first offender institution.
It is multiple offender.

What I stated I believe was that they

all have less than a year to serve, and it is single cell, and
so forth.
The state did try to make selective work responsi­
bilities.

That was the whole promulgation, the whole reason

behind Regulation 204, is to assign women in male prisons where
they could b© used and still meet the needs of the state, and
to assign males in women prisoners where they could be used.
Now, wa use their in the youth centers and in the
work release centers.

At cur youth centers, the boys are first

offenders, non-violent inmates, have got less than ten years
to serve, and they are gone to school during the day.

At the

work release centers, all the inmates are gone during the cay
to jobs.

There is certainly no patrolling situation like there

is in the penitentiaries.
I would like to address briefly the prima facie show­
ing against the statute of —- the height and weight statute.
The only thing that was shown in this case was some census

49

figures that ware taken in i960 of women between the ages of
18 and 79.

There was no attempt whatsoever to show women in

the Alabama work force that were eligible for employment as
prison guards, no attempt whatsoever.

And we feel that the

court, have taken judicial notice of this, and this is certainly
not sufficient to show and to challenge a state statute as
being prima facia discriminatory.
In Griggs, the court did find that a statistical
disparity plus a past practice of overt racial discrimination
mad© out a case of prima faci©
crimination.

a prima facie case of dis~

We don’t have any past practice her®.

have any overt discrimination in the past.

W@ don’t

Thera is nothing

shown but sot© Census figures, and we certainly contend that
the Griggs decision is limited by those circumstances.
QUESTION?

How long has sthis statute bean on the

books?
MR. EVANS?
QUESTION?
MR. EVANS:
question?

sine© 1971, Your Honor.
1971.
Yes, sir.
So for at least six years, up until now,

anybody under five-feefc-three in height and 120 pounds in
weight would know that there is no point in applying, wouldn't
they?
MR. EVANS:

Well, Your Honor, we contend that they

are not, that widely known because obviously the plaintiff

50

represented in this case had a master's degree in criminal
psychology and proposed to have some lav? enforcement experience
and had no idea that there was such a height-weight minimum.
Justice Marshall questioned earlier about th® wide­
spread us© of thes© 'things.

A Law Review article which wo

cite in th© brief, they have don© som© investigation of that
and found that 47 of the SO largest polic® forces in th©
country do use those„ and we are not aware of any state trooper
force in th© country that do©© not us© same typs of heightweight requirements.
As far as drawing the lines? which x believe Mr,
Chief Justice mentioned earlier? this job is not like an air­
line job where you could fell if a person is so many inches
long th©v can reach th© pedals and th® controls.
job which has a peculiar function.

This is a

The duties ar© unpredict­

able? there is high risk involved? and there is a maximum
amount of state responsibility both to th® inmates as well as
to the population which surrounds th® prisons.

AM to hold the

stats to such a rigid standard or to a mathematical certainty
to have to say that a person five-two? 120 pounds can always
do the job? whereas a person five-two? 115 pounds can never
do the job? we feel is certainly unjustified and a derrogation
of the Tenth Amendment power s.
