MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next, in 76-357? Linmark Associates against Township of
Willingboro.
Mr. Hauch, I think you may proceed when you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. HAUCH? JR.? ESQ.?
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HAUCHs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
In this case? the petitioners are contending that a
sign ordinance of the Township of Willingboro which prohibits
"For Sale" signs on residential premises is unconstitutional.
Right now? if you live in Willingboro and you desire
to soil your home? you may not post a "For Sale" sign on your
property.
If you desire to engage a realtor to aid you in
selling your home? neither you nor the realtor can post a
c’For Sale" sign on your property.
The justification offered by the Township is not that
the "For Sal©55 signs are improper? the justification is that
the Township Council has a fear that the residents of the
community in the neighborhood will develop what is called a
psychological fear? this being by seeing homes for sal® in
your neighborhood? you get; the message that people are moving
out? and. in turn? this might lead to an irrational reaction

4
on. the part of the neighbors 9 and they might rush to put their
homes on the market in a rush to leave the town»
Now, mixed in with this justification is the thought,
on the part of some people, that some neighbors may feel that
i.f this person moves out, a member of a racial minority may
move ini
So the justd.fication primarily is based on a train
»£ apprehension and fear»

Yet the ordinance bans all "For

Sale” signs on residences in Willingfooro.
We can see a number of examples where the ban would
be totally irrational to accomplish the end. of keeping fear from
residents»
For example t a person that is transferred in their
employment from Willingboro, for instance, in New Jersey to
California, cannot put up a sign "Home for sal© - Transfer"»
A black in the community that, is sailing may not put up a
sign "House for Sals - black moving out".

That certainly

would not create the fear that the Township envisions is present
in "For Sale" signs.
Similarly, a person moving from one side of town to

the other

and this is not a small town; it*s a town of

11,000 houses
across town".

couldn't put up a sign "House for sale - moving
Not out of town.

Now, the basis that the Township has established here,

1 think leads to the central issue in the case, and that isi

5
whether the Township can carry its heavy burden of sustaining
that this ordinance is constitutional and does not abridge
the freedom of speech of the First Amendment.,
In getting to this posture of the case# the Court of
Appeals# by a 2 to 1 decision# reversed the district court#
the Court of Appeals holding that the ordinance was constitu­
tional®

At that time# in the history of the development of

the protection afforded commercial speech# the Court of Appeals
only had th® initial case of 1342# of Valentine v, Chrestensen»
It had# subsequently# th© Pittsburgh Press case#
which upheld a prohibition on the advertising of on illegal
activity# namely# fell® sex discrimination in employment where
prohibited®
It also had this Court"s decision in Bigelow v„
Virginia# but did not think that the Bigelow decision extended
far enough to prevent th® Township from having such an ordinance
banning signs*
In 1976, aftsr the Court of Appeals decision# this
Court handed down its opinion in th© Virginia State Board of
Pharmacy case®

This was a notable announcement of protection

afforded to commercial speech®

Because# among other things#

and probably primary as far as society is concerned# it was
recognized that there is a great public interest in having
the fee© flow of commercial information# it may be. indispensable#
and that people in their ordinary individual commercial trans-

6
actions should be able to make not only intelligent but wellinformed decisions. They should not be kept ignorant of the
facts, they should not be pushed by other means to get facts
that are not more readily available by the message sought to be
put.
The analogy with the Virginia Stats Board of Pharmacy
s

case, I think, is extremely close to our case. There there was
a private economic transaction, and it was a case that extended
commercial advertising protection to a product.
of its kind.

The first case

It is essential, obviously, -that price, which was

a consideration in the Virginia Pharmacy case, was solroething
aaariL- *yixaetBBusss.KSVmiaiTTW .i-VI—Ti .iiMit T HH iTHimJwW

that had to be known by the purchaser.
In our case the supply of a product, or a house, the
availability of it on the market is equally essential to the
informed and intelligent choice of a buyer.
The Virginia Pharmacy case extended a protection of
the First Amendment not only for the benefit of the advertiser
but also for the benefit of the person receiving the advertise­
ment, so that he could be informed and make intelligent
decisions that affect his daily life.

And the sal© of a house

is a vitally important thing to most homeowners, it may b©
their most important asset.
How, the situation is not thsfc we claim signs cannot
be regulated of this nature.

Obviously, there are clear areas

for regulation? namely, signs cannot be false, they cannot be

7
deceptive, they cannot advertise an. illegal activity, as
indicated by the Pittsburgh Press case „

There may be other

areas of regulation, such as for safety and for health.
of these areas were involved in this case.

None

The Township comes

forth with no justification on any of those bases.
There also is not an ordinance framed for maintaining
in the community something for the purposes of safety, such as
traffic congestion, or something that is obnoxious and blaring,,
that offends the senses, such as noise.
QUESTION:

What, would be your view if an ordinance

prohibited placing any sign on the property at any time for any
reason?
MR, JIAUCH:
Your Honor please.

I would say it is unconstitutional, if
And ..if I may give an example, I think the

forbidding of political signs, for instance, no matter how small,
could be regulated.

I think it would be unconstitutional to

prohibit a political sign on a private property,
QUESTION: What about, a sign advertising cigarettes
or whiskey or a typical billboard sign?
MR, fSAUCII:

I think the typical billboard, sign, if

it's not compatible with the area in which it is displayed,
such as national beautification of highways, can be regulated,
QUESTION: *

Well, isn*t that the fear that the time

and place regulations can. be made of some public display?
MR, Hi'JJCH:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

I agree with that

8

wholeheartedly.

And X would say this, we do not, in this case,

have a time, manner and place restriction? we have a censorship
of the message itself»

It is prohibited»

the place is not significant»
ordinance»

The time, the manner,

It is not a purpose of this

It is just a complete and total suppression of a

message»
And I think that distinguishes it from all the cases,
including the American Mini Theatres case, in which the time
and manner may b© reasonably regulated»

We do not, contend it

can't be»
Prior* to the passage of this repeal, I may say to the
Court, the Township did have a regulatory scheme for signs»
It embraced at least two facets»

One facet was that the

sign, the number of the signs, the square footage of the signs,
the time after which they had to be removed was all provided by
this ordinance? reasonable regulation. And this pertains
particularly to house "For Sale" signs»
In addition, it is notable that in the ordinance, in
Section 17-3, there is a requirement that anyone putting up a
sign of this nature, or any other nature, must get a permit
from the Building Inspector.

There is no fee charged for the

permit in connection with “House for sale" signs.

That was

the regulatory scheme»
And I think it provided adequate means for monitoring,
in the event there was any thought of illegal activity in the

9
use of real estate signs, which is not on this record? but if
there were, the registration certainly would provide adequate
means for monitoring.
Moving on, the justification, upon analysis, cannot
in any way coma out to anything except a totally illogical
approach to how to achieve the stated goal of the Township,
j us

same message can be conveyed, ’ for sale", in a newspaper,

it can be conveyed in a broker’s office, in a multiple listing
book, or even a church, by neighbors talking or a social
function,
The message- itself is what the Township wants to

suppress, to achieve their goal.

A person is going to, if you

follow the Township's theory, have the same psychological fear
that is what same people have —«• when the person receives
th© message ' for sale”; because the message says people are
moving out. Whether he gets that message through a sign on a
property, a newspaper, or broker, or a neighbor, is not
significant, it is the message that would create the fear.
In addition, I think there is a distinction between
’"For Sale” signs on property and other possible methods of
advertising»
Pa-

y®'-*■£

A oroker requires a contract in most cases to
/ ot the broker’s commission. A newspaper cannot be

as objective, because the purpose of the advertiser is to sell.

n&

is certainly going to puff the property.

." ui. f ....

We don’t see

.X:1: no* riaicaciag I-'vrh a hots# has holvo in the roof or

10

things of that nature»

So it is not strictly objective.

It's

hard to conceive of anything more objective than a person without
outside influences driving around on a weekend in a suburban
community and seeing a sign, and seeing the house.

There is

no other way -chat he is going to sea these two things together
in a completely objective setting as far as he is concerned.
If he likes -QUESTION;

This ordinance applies to all property,

doesn't it, not just residential property?
MR. IIAUCH:

If Your Honor please, the ordinance is

designed to cover residential property as one area of sign
regulation.

There are also separate areas of regulation with

respect to commercial areas and industrial areas.

The design

of the ordinance is exclusionary and only permits of exceptions.
QUESTION;

Youk client, Linmark Associates, Incorpor­

ated, according to the complaint, owns land and premises in
Willingboro — is -that residential?
MR. HAUCII;

Residential; 25 Sherwood Drive, if Your

Honor please.
QUESTION:
MR. HAUCII:

Does the corporation live in.it or what?
It, is a corporation and the — first, I

would say, it is a corporation that owns this property, and
the circumstances of ownership probably would seem odd in a
housing setting.

My understand is it's a real estate company

that holds titles that come out of foreclosure until they can

11
be disposed of in a reasonable market»

There is no charge

that Linmark, or any evidence that Linmark engages in any way
in any illegal blockbusting activiti.es or any other legally
offensive activities in this community„

The

QUESTION;

No, I wasn’t — you answered my question

MR» IIAUCH:

Yes , sir.

to that.

QUESTION:

I was just, wondering why a corporation

should be owning a single-occupancy dwelling.
MR. HAUCII:

My understanding is, if Your Honor please,
*

that when there are foreclosures, rather than having a sal©
at a distressed price in a foreclosure proceeding, quite often
the mortgagee, be it a bank, life insurance company, or what,
will take title or put the fcifcal in a nominee name, if you
will, until a reasonable price can be obtained at a sale.
I think that is the situation here. Your Honor.
QUESTION: What is the business of Linmark Associates,
Incorporated?
MR. HAUCII:

That is its business, is holding these

titles, as I understand it, after acquiring theirs from fore­
closure sales, until a reasonable psrice can be obtained and a
suit made.
QUESTION:

And William Meliman, the other plaintiff,

is a real estate agant?
MR. HAUCII:

He is a general real estate agent, Your

12
Honor, yes? who engages in business in this Township,
QUESTION:

Mr. Hauch* we had a case up here not too

long ago involving the banning of cigarette advertising on
radio* and this was summarily affirmed* upholding the ban.
There was a message that was banned? if we decide for you in
this case* are we overruling that one?
MR. HAUCH:

I don’t believe so* sir.

Cigarette

advertising* to me* certainly is in the interest of public
health* which is a
QUESTION:

Well* it isn't illegal to smoke cigarettes

yet* maybe it ought to be* but it isn't yet.
MR. IIAUCII:

Well* I don't think you would be over­

ruling your ---- the decision in -the television advertising

case

on cigarettes* sir* because I think the public interest which
supports that would not be the same type of interest as
Willingboro could show in this case.
QUESTION:

There have been some distinctions’ at

least* however refined* on the broadcasters that do not apply*
for example, to newspapers* on the theory/that the use of the
public resource by a broadcaster gives the greater governmental
power.
MR. HAUCH:

Yes* sir* that would be true* Your Honor*

and broadcasting* of course* th-a licensing situation, a private
homeowner is not a licensing situation? so licensing activities
certainly can be much more regulated* as would be the case with

13
realtors but. not with the individual homeowner? on a "For Sale”
sign»
QUESTION:

Your client also wants to be able to put

up “Sold” signs as well as "For Sale" signs? are you defending
fch at p rac ti ce ? too ?
MR, HAUCH:

We are not defending it here? sir? because?

specifically? it was not in issue as such. But I would say that
the practice should ba allowed under proper regulation? to
indicate the information the property has been sold.

And

perhaps the sign should be .removed within five days ■ or some­
thing.
But I do think it's proper information —•
QUESTION: This is purely commercial? this aspect
is purely commercial.
MR. IIAUC1I:

Not entirely? if Your Honor please?

because it’s taking the property off of the market? which? I
think? would ha equally essential to somebody? a consumer?
that's interested in buying a property in the area? that this
property was sold.
It does h&va some element of informing the public on
something that they should have the right to know? if they are
interested in the housing market.
QUESTION:

Well? isn't, it a situation in which the

real estate, agent or agency is touting itself as having been
responsible for the sale?

14
HR* IIAUCH:

Thera is an element of that in it, and

it would not be denied, sir, that is a commercial element*
QUESTION;

Isn’t that the dominant one?

MR, HAUCIls

In practice it would be, I would think,

the dominant element because the seller no longer is concerned.
It is a commercial element.

But I wouldn’t say, because it’s

a commercial element, that it could be completely prohibited.
Moving on, the
QUESTION: But you apparently, in response to my
brother Blackmun's question, do

you do agree that there are

some interests that warrant the discretion of advertising.
MR. IIAUCH:

Yes, if Your Honor please,

QUESTION;

You indicated public health, interest in

public health warrants the suppression*
MR. IIAUCH:

Public health, public safety, the truth,

no deceptive advertising, and —•
QUESTION:

So your argument is there are some

interests, but this isn't one of them.
MR. IIAUCH: This is r*ct one. of them, sir.

I think it

fails tee test to be applied in a number of respects:

one, I

don51 think this ordinance furthers any paramount or compelling
governmental interest.

I definitely don't perceive of anything

that is incidental'about the regulation suppression, the
suppression of this speech to any valid immediate objectives.
The sole objective is to suppress the message “for sale” so

15
that you suppress an apprehension or fear*

And I don’t know

of any case that has held that it is proper just because of
simple fear or apprehension to suppress free speech.

And it

would be horrible if it happened.*, because I think* just in
times of controversy, such as are indicated by the Township
here* the more speech* the more information about the problem*
the more aid to society solving the problem.
Also, it is certainly not -the least essential way of
accomplishing this end.

Because education will do it*

suppression is not just a restriction.
I may indicate that our Fourteenth Amendment -.r^v.er.t
is primarily based on the finding by the District Court that
there 'was an improper motive, a desire of the Township officials
to frees© in past discrimination.

We’re relying on our brief

for that argument.
I think the important thing in a free speech case
today* that has commercial advertising* is to consider that our
experience with, government, our experience in society is that
secrecy doss not achieve desirable social ends.

The more

information made available in consumar transactions* in
consumer credit, in disclosures with respect to equal opportun­
ity* the better.

We get better answers. And I think the law

consistently supports that view.
There is no support in the Constitution for the
notion that if people are kept ignorant they are going to be

16
better off, and social ends are going to be achieved.
Here I think it,4 s irrational to believe that people
will act irrationally if they are given the full facts and the
truth.

That seems to be the approach taken by the Township.

I do not concede that it's supported by the lav/ or will achieve
the social end desired.
15 d like to reserve
QUESTION:

The equal protection clause argument,you

have just explained to us that this ordinance is designed to
have racial results.

You don't make an argument under the

equal protection clause that this ordinance prohibits tit©
display of "For Sale" or "Sold" signs, but doesn’t prohibit
the display of signs containing other messages?
MR. HAUCH: The overbreadth argument was not, if Your
Honor please, made a point in -the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION; Well, that could be a significant argument.
MR. HAUCH:

It could be a significant, argument, and

I think the realisation of -that came up in some very recent
cases of this Court on overbreadth, and it may well be, although
we have not urged it, because we did not urge it when we started
this case, that there is an ovarbreadth problem in this
case that’s vary serious.
QUESTION:

Well, I’m directing myself to the equal

protection clause, net the overbreadth, due process.
MR. HAUCH;

I see.

17
QUESTION:

Does Willingboro permit, signs advertising

other things, carrying messages?
MR. HAUC1I:

Willingboro permits signs advertising a

use that is made on the property, such as a business that is
on the property, and they advertise, if it's in a zone v/here it
can carry on its business.

It does not allow signs that

advertise off-premises business.
QUESTION: But if there's a bakery or a dressmaker or
a ""
MR. HAUCH:

He can advertise if he's in a commercial

zone on his property, but not off his property, and he can't
advertise if he's a branch of a bakery, as I understand it.
QUESTION:

How about a residential sons, a woman who

does dressmaking, for example?
MR. IIAUCH:

Dressmaking would not be permitted,

QUESTION:

In her

however,
own home.

In her own home, with

her own ne^-ils and . thread.
MR. HAUCII:

Well, not under the way the ordinance

is drafted, because it's not an exception.
I may point out, there are exceptions for private
enterprise.

You might have a stable.

QUESTION:

How about an apartment building putting

up a "Fox- Rent” sign, one, two, three-room apartments?
MRo HAUCH:

"For Rent" signs, if Your Honor please.

18

fall in the same repealer clause as the "For Sale'5 signs.
QUESTION;

So they are not permitted now in

Willingboro?
MR. IIAUCH;

No, sir.

Because the exclusion was both

"For Rent" as well as "For Sale".
QUESTION;

I see.

MR. IIAUCH;

But we have not stressed the "For Rent"

point, because they are in exactly the same category.
QUESTION;

Are there apartments in Willingboro?

Ap artmsnt, structures ?
'MR. HAUCII:

I don't believe there are, of any

significance, if any, sir.
QUESTION;

Where is it?

MR. IIAUCH;
and Trenton.

Willingboro is raidway between Philadelphia

It is —

QUESTION:

It's not my end of the State.

I was just

up there.
MR. HAUCII;

No, ifc!s

and it is a very large area,

I may say, geographically.
The answer that there may ba alternative means, I
think, is no argument against what we contend.

There's no

recognized principle that because you want, to give a message
in one way, and a speaker can get the message in another way,
that you have answered the suppression that violates' free
speech.

19
I really don’t; think that the Township thus far in
this case has come forward and met our free speech argument
head-on in its briefs.
Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve my remaining
time o
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION:

Very well.

May I ask just one question?

What is

your response to the argument that an ordinance of this
character preserves property values in the interest of the city
for tax purposes, and also in the interest of the property
owners themselves?
MR. HAUCII:

I think, looking at the record in this

case, during a period up until and through 1973, when signs
were permitted, the evidence is — and no one contests it —
that property values actually increased.

There is no ---

QUESTION: Did folic District Court make a finding to that
effect?
MR. HAUCII: The District Court, made a finding they
did not decrease during the period.

In the record, the — even

at trial, the members of the Township Council -testified that
property values had steadily increased.

They had not decreased

in Willingboro.
I think it would be difficult to assume that property
values would decrease because of the presence of signs.

I

think the competition that was shown in Willingboro for homes

20

would keep the price up, and obviously part of that is there
are homes for sala» it is a message,
QUESTION?

But whatever may have happened in your

community, it is common knowledge, I think, that where white
flight has occurred significantly, that property values have
suffered, resulting in diminution of tax revenues for the
community»
MR, IIAUCII:

I would agree that's true, sir.

And —

QUESTION: But it, hasn't happened in this community?
MR, IIAUCIIs

No, it has net. There's no evidence

whatsoever in the record that it has,
QUESTION

%

The purpose of this ordinance was preventive!,

I suppose.
MR. IIAUCII:
QUESTION:

Is to prevent
To prevent rather than to repair.

MR. IIAUCII: Well, it definitely is,. I suppose4 to
prevent rather than to repair, if Your Honor please? and the
means to prevent are illogical.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Gottlieb.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MYRON II. GOTTLIEB, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GOTTLIEB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It pleas®

the Court:
I disagree with counsel, as might be expected or

21

anticipated.

I think that what the Court has before it is an

ordinance to prohibit or ban a device which has been or was
being utilized to manipulate Willingboro from an integrated
community feo a resegregated one# and that# as such# it does
not run afoul of the equal protection clause.
And# secondly# whether an ordinance which furthers
this legitimate government interest fails ‘the First

Admendment

or is contradicted by the First Amendment.
QUESTION;

Would you think tit at would, be equally —

what would you -think if the ordinance included in its prohibi­
tion advertising in newspapers?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

I don’t believe that should be

I don’t believe that newspjipers, first of all# in

discussing this# it's quite evidence that Township Council
took the narrowest means it could take.
is not affected.

Newspaper advertisement

Other means of advertisement are not.

affected. And the record reflects# as shown by plaintiffs’
testimony# that over# or approximately 70 percent of all
real estate inquiries for the purchase of the homes com® from
methods other than "For Sale" signs.
We’re not trying to e^sfc into other areas. What we are
trying to do is merely hit the closest or the, narrowest way
we can approach the problem.

This is borne out by the fact#

further. Your Honor# that in Willingboro — and again disagreeing
with counsel — the fact of advertisement of homes for sale

22

did not cause panic,,

The only thing that caused panic was the

fact of advertisement for homes for sale through one particular
mods or method, and that was the forest of HFor Sale” signs
on the lawns of all the homes in the residential area*

That

was what was being attacked.
If we went at anything else, it wouldn't be reasonably
related to trying to solve the problem.

This, in fact, is

borne out by the fact that it did solve the problem.

The

insecurities and tensions and problems existing in Willingboro
prior to the ban of "For Sale” and "Sold" signs were diminished
strongly. They weren't entirely eradicated, but they were
diminished to quite an extent.

And that evidence is absolutely

uncontradicted in the record.
It's quite clear that this nation has a national
policy as to housing as to housing, and perhaps —
QUESTION;

Mr. Gottliebf could you tell me one thing

about the change that the ordinance brought about;

does the

evidence tall us whether there's been a change in the actual
number of houses being offered for sale?
MR. GOTTLIEB;

No, sir? it does not.

It does show

that the number of homes which were indeed sold prior to the
enactment of the ordinance is about the same.

There's been no

diminution of sales.

One realtor testified he was selling the

same? one said more.

So at least wa’ve got to assume it was

the sana

QUESTION:

No change in the rate of sal© nor in the

rate of putting houses on the market?
MR» GOTTLIEB:

I don’t know whether there was a

change ~

MR» GOTTLIEB:

Pardon?

QUESTION:

The fear»

MR* GOTTLIEB:

*»" people who are residing in the

community , who are selling based solely on fear, and it's
addressed solely to this on© issue of stability»
QUESTION: But doesn’t the evidence tend to indicate,
if the rates have remained constant, that there are just as
many people who sold on account of fear before the ordinance
as tli©re were after?
MR» GOTTLIEB:

No, sir.

Quite to the contrary»

The evidence, although as many people were selling as before,
it*, does not show why they were selling now? it does show that
of those who were selling
uncontradicted here

and again th© evidence is

there was less vocalisation, if I may,

by people who had sold their homes or were in the process of
selling their homes, or had decided to sail their homes, as

24
that in fact they were sailing or had decided to sell because
of a fear of being left there, the non-stable community, a fear
of being left there, the last — the neighborhood's changing,
that type of concept.
QUESTION;

You know, there's another way of doing

it, that's been don© in some towns, of putting a different sign
up;

"This house is not for sale".
MR. GOTTLIEB;

It worked very well.

That may in fact be the case, sir.

Willingboro did not choose —» the legislative judgment of the
Township Council was that this was the most appropriate course
based upon the recommendation of the Human Relations Commission
and the various public hearings that war© held.
QUESTION:

A sign saying "This house is not for sale"

would also violate — would also be impermissible under the ™~
MR. GOTTLIEB;
QUESTION:

It would now b© impermissible, yes, sir.

Right.

MR. GOTTLIEB;

Because no sign is permitted.

Well, there are certain signs which

sire permitted.
QUESTION;

Professional?

MR. GOTTLIEB;

Professional nameplates, if you would,

for a physician or an attorney or someone of a permitted
professional use in a residential area is permitted.
With that exception, no other «■*- and I'm not sure
how much of an exception that is —<• no other commercial
advertisement is allowed in & residential district

25
QUESTION: Right»
MR» GOTTLIEB:

The State of New Jersey, through its

courts, has determined that a municipality may not prohibit
political signs, so that we do not try to regulate that.
We accept the State court law that in fact political
signs may not be regulated, at least to the extent of being
prohibited.

I would assume that they could be kept back from

th© roadway, in the interest of traffic safety, or something
entirely not raised here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gottlieb, let ms ask one other

question that maybe you will reach.
On this 30 percent factor, that 30 percent of the
5?ales, only 30 parcent were generated by the "For Sale" sign.
Supposing the evidence had been the converse, that 30 percent
had been generated by local newspaper ads, and 70 percent by
”For Sales" signs, could the Township have banned the newspaper
ads?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

No, no.

We — I don’t think we can

approach newspaper advertisements, and we’re not trying to
approach newspaper advertisements.
QUESTION;

Well, what’s the difference?

MR* GOTTLIEB:

Factual findings in this particular

case were that newspaper advertisements did not "stir up™ the
residents.

Office inquiries or a listing in the multiple

listing servies booklet or pamphlet did not "stir up" people.

26
The sole thing that stirred up people were the abundance of
"For Sale" signs, -the signs that when people would -walk to and
from their home, to take a walk in their neighborhood, or to
drive to and from work, or to go to the store, or take your
child, to walk him or her to school, that was what did it»
The dominating presence»
QUESTION:

Well, this "forest of signs", does the

record tell us what percentage of homes were for sal© at any
given point in time?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

It does not. There is a mention,

quite candidly, where, at the two public hearings held on this,
a realtor at ons of the hearings, and I believe it was the
first hearing, stood up and indicated that:

"According to our

monthly review, at the previous month there were 230 or 200
'For Saits* signs up", Willingboro having a community of 11,000»
I have no idea how many other homes were up for sale
through ~ not utilizing signs»
refined by two other factors»

The indication further may be

The indication of the witness, if

I recall correctly # was that this was other realtors' signs,
it did not taka into account, I believe, me trying to sell my
own home»
Finally, this survey was taken in the month of
January»

On© would tend to suspect, through experience, that

January "For Sale" signs on the front lawn are much less than
May, June, this time of the year when most of the real estate

27
business goes on,
QUESTIONs

Well* is the difference between the

"For Sale6' signs and the newspaper ads* then* 'that the practice
in the real ©state business is to list

sample examples of

houses for sale* never list all 230 in the same ad* or anything
like that?

So that you don't get the feeling of how many are

actually on the market at any on© time»
MR. GOTTLIEB:
QUESTION:

I just can't indicate what —

X mean* if that's not it# I am trying

to understand why you draw a distinction between my example of
30 perdent — well# I say your difference is based on the fact
that there is evidence in the hearings that relate to signs#
and there is no evidence in the hearings relating to newspaper
ads; is that it?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

That’s quite correct.

Indeed# everybody

indicated# in testi fying# that there was no other mode of
advertisement which caused this panic among the residents of
Willingboro# other than the forest of "For Sale" signs.
Ubiquitous signs that are all over the place.
And that was it# that was what Willingboro approached?
they did not attempt to regulate in any other area* because
any other area wasn’t causing the problem.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gofclieb# see if — perhaps you have

already answered this# but does your ordinance touch upon*
political advertising at all?

28

MR® GQTTLIEBs

It doesn't speak on© way or the other*

I can indicate to Your Honor that the law, as determined by the
State courts of New Jersey , is that a municipality may not
prohibit signs of a political natura.
QUESTION:

So that —

Well, then, if you're in the midst of

a campaign, I can conceive of some political signs that would
accomplish just exactly what you are afraid -these ’’For Sale”
signs i^ould accomplish:

somathing that this neighborhood is

becoming all black,elect Joe Segregationist? or something like
this e
MR. GOTTLIEB:

Yes.

I can only relate to Your Honor

that in my mind that’s a policy decision made by the First
Amendment, that in fact if it’s a political or philosophical
or social and economical exposition of a thought or an idea,
that the First Amendment says we can’t regulate that.
However, here we have a situation where we have signs
which have a direct definable impact on the present residents
of Willingboro, which is resulting in transforming a community#
which is, I can say quite proudly, probably a model in this
nation for compliance with the Fair Housing Act, if not THE
model, tran.3ofrming that community into a resegregated on©.
Now, I can’t accept the assertion or the connotation
that the commercial speech in tills context, which is clearly
against the public welfare, clearly against the public policy,
because of its impact, which is truly deceptive in that nature,

29
because of its impact, is entitled to an elevated position
under the First Amendment.

I don’t believe that the Court or

the First Amendment has ever made that policy decision»
I think that the Court, indeed, has gone so far, in
many of the cases I’ve cited in my brief, to the other extreme?
that where the public health, safety and welfare of a community
are concerned, and where, her©, you've got a national welfare
interest concerned, as set forth in the Title VIII of the Fair
Housing Act, that the Court can't just put blinders to its
©y©s.

No court can»
In fact, I would have condemned Willingboro Township

Council if it had put blinders to its eyas and not acted in
this particular situation»
I would again indicate to the Court, contrary to the
statement by fellow counsel, that we have a fear psychology,
a panic, and it's not a. panic in the sens© that everybody is
moving, it’s an incipiency, a beginning in Willingboro, which
was not conjectural» There is no indication that because it
may have occurred, the record is filled with, instances where
in fact it was occurring» where in fact -there was a communication
by many of the residents that, indeed, "I'm uptight, and I'm
worried and I'm frustrated and I'm . fearful”, and that was
what Willingboro*s ordinance tried to get at»
QUESTION;
of these signs?

Mr* Gottlieb, how widespread was the use

30

MR., GOTTLIEB:

The signs appeared in every —

Willingboro has — was created by Levitt, to the extent that
we have various parks, Somerset Park, Pennyp&cker Park, with,
give or take, an average of 1,000 homes in each park0
were in ©vary park.

It was —

QUESTION:

In large numbers, or diffused, or what?

MR. GOTTLIEB:

Well, Willingboro has varicus types

of homes, willingboro has single-family residences,
has

They

willingboro

a section or an area of townhouses, with cul-de-sacs or

short little streets.

In a cul-de-sac with 20 homes, or

townhouses fronting onto it, which is perhaps 100 feet, 150 feet
long on both sides, like almost a U-shape, to say that eight
signs or six signs is less significant there than six signs or
eight signs on a street which is perhaps

a quarter of a mile

long, I think that two factors have to be determined here.
No. 1, the physical characteristic of the street
that it's on or of the homes bordering that street? and also
■5 ’

th© number.

But there were all over.

There’s no question that

signs war® in every park, or displayed in every park. They
weren't singling out one or two or three.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gottlieb, on that point, you mentioned

11,000 earlier? is that 11,000 population or 11,000 houses?
MR. GOTTLIEBs

No, 11,000 residences.

Willingboro

has approximately 45,000 people, which would be —
QUESTION: Well, 230 signs out of 11,000, that's one

31

out of every 45 or 50«
MR. GOTTLIEB:

If, in fact, the ~

QUESTXQN: Even if it was twice that many, it5d be —
you know, on® out of every 25 houses.
MR. GOTTLIEB:
QUESTION:

Is that a "forest”?

Pardon?

Even if there are twice as many as -the

230, that would be about one out of every 25 houses.
MR. GOTTLIEB:

Well, let’s assume that the sfcafcement

made, not subject to cross-examination ~ this is based on a
public hearing — were accurate, *ud again the statements mad®
are at taking a survey in January.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. GOTTLIEB:

But l©t9s assume tiiat they are

accurate, if, in fact, and it’s quite clear that the various
residents of the community stood up and protested about the
"forest of ’For Sale’ signs”, who am I tea say that eight is a
forest on my street and two is net, or is six a forest and
eleven, or just what?

I can’t say thaifc they were uniformly

distributed, where a home had perhaps «•*** or a street had perhaps
50 residences along it, end it hit precisely every 20th home,
or if, at 'bills end of -the street, wa had six among these ten
homes

'i

but none along the balance of the street or maybe one —
QUESTION:

Mr. Gottlieb, these figures cam© from the

people who war© supporting the ordinance, right?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

That is wrong.

These figures cams

32

from a realtor who stood up and opposed the ordinance at the
first public hearing, and said, “’My firm took a survey, -and
these are the results of that survey.”
QUESTION:

Are you talking about the number of signs?

MR. GOTTLIEB:

That is correct, sir.

QUESTION: Well, do you have any to contradict that?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

I can only indicate to Your Honor --

QUESTION; Do you have any figures in the record to
contradict that?
MR. GOTTLIEB; There is nothing in the record, other
than when one of the co unci linen who. was testifying was
questioned about it, he said, "We had figures which we
considered in making our determination, or arriving at our
judgment.

I do not recall the figures, nor do I have them

available here in court.*' And this is at the trial level.
QUESTION: Well, the only figures we have are 200-andsoma, in this record.
MR. GOTTLIEB:
QUESTION:

That is correct, sir.
So that that’s idle "forest®.

That is

MR. GOTTLIEB;

Th© "forest" is til® impression of

Well, sine© the change of Administration.

MR. GOTTLIEB;

Yes, sir.

And we haven't, panicked.

We're not

uptight about it.
[Laughter. ]
QUESTION;
MR, GOTTLIEB;

I hope!
I don't know the community conditions

in tli® District of Columbia.

But here is a legislative

decision made as to what they want or what they don't want.
But if in fact it. were to appear to the — those
people in authority, able to make that deeds ion, that in
fact there were a widespread panic-selling atmosphere in the
District of Columbia, and if in fact the authorities, whomever
they may be, were to determine that it is appropriate to

34
respond to that in order to maintain the stability in the
community — and I us© "stability" solely in the sense that
on© does not want to leave Willingboro or the District of
Columbia solely out of fear — and that's the way I believe it
was used ai the context of this case.

That in those situations,,

in that situation it would present the identical issue posed
to the Court in this case* that in fact we do have* because
of the way the public perceives it, a situation which is
inimical to fehe public health and welfare.
The argument of counsel that indeed the ordinance
has been utilised to discriminate against minorities is clearly
erroneous.

Counsel have suggested in their brief that because

we are prohibiting "For Sal®" signs* that itself means that
we're trying to keep minorities or anyone out? but the absence
of signs* in and of themselves* don’t control who moves in*
because of the absolutely effective alternate means of communica­
tion.
Couple that with the fact that the testimony even of
Mr, Mailman* the plaintiff in this case* or the petitioner here*

was to the effect that even though we have signs prohibited —
QUESTION:

Let me question your "absolutely

effective alternate means of communication" statement.

Now*

you’re suggesting that from the point of view of a seller he
can communicate his willingness to sell by advertising and
listing.

But what about the prospective buyer who drivos into

35

a neighborhood and says, "I may move into this block? I'm
!

curious to know how many people are selling»
community or one that5 s changing?"

Is it a stable

How doss he get the

message that he -would get if there were signs out front?
MRo GOTTLIEBs

That person spends 15 cents, buys a

newspaper, scans the "Homes for Sale” column in the newspaper,
that person —
QUESTION:

But is it

MR0 GOTTLIEBs

does the record —

— may go to a realtor and look at

the multiple listing service booklet, which lists every home
for sale in Willingboro, by park and by style of home,
Colonial or —
QUESTION:

And by block, he could get all the homes

on a given block?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

He -- well, I don't know if it

breaks it down to a particular block- but I do know it breaks
it down to a park.

And in Willingboro, its park system is

such that if you’live in Pennypacker, all the streets in that
park begin with, the letter P.

If you live in another one, and

so on.
So that one could find out, if not that particular
street, without going through the entirety of Pennypacker*s
listing, one could easily find out at least tine neighborhood,
at a two minutes® glance.
QUESTION:

Is it as easy as driving down the street

36

in a car on a Sunday afternoon?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

I would assume it*s much easier to

spend five minutes sitting at a desk than to drive through an
entire community of 45,GOG people.
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

What I’m talking about, you have a block

that you’re interested in, you want to know how many houses are
for sale, you go to — I se®, you go to the real estate agent
and ask, is basically what you’re saying.
MR. GOTTLIEB:

You can do that, or look at

a

classified section in the newspaper, under the "Homes for Sal©"
solumn.

What you’re suggesting is incomp1@

then?
MR. GOTTLIEB;

Pardon me?

QUESTION: Well, 1*11 withdraw that.
MR. GOTTLIEB:

It’s ironic, in response to your

question perhaps, that there is no home seeker who is a
•plaintiff in this particular case, that we don’t have a complaint

37

from someone who wants to move into town» We have a complaint
from a realtor whose livelihood is the earning of commissions
from the sale of realty, and a corporation whose income is
attributed to the turnover of real estate*

That's all we have

here*
QUESTIONz But the challenge, I suppose, is that there
ar© different people buying homes who might buy them were it
not for this ordinance*
That's the whole purpose of the ordinance, isn't it,
to hope that there will be more sales to whites than there will
be to blacks?
MR. GOTTLIEBs

No, sir.

No, sir.

Or at least that there won't be a

disproportionate number to blacks, would be a more accurate
way to put it.

QUESTION : Well, what were they so afraid of, then?
What’s all this fear?
MR. GOTTLIEB:

The fear is among the present

residents of Willingboro, who are moving not because they have
been transferred to Walla Walla, ox* because of the change in

38
their family siz©f or financial considerations, or other things
like that»

Their mere moving because they have got this bug

QUESTION;

Too lata in what sense?

MR. GOTTLIEBs

They're afraid that in fact they will

be left in a community which has changed. And by reacting to
that, they are encouraging that,
QUESTIONS

You mean the value of their property will

substantially decrease?
MR, GOTTLIEBs

They

may — I can't distinguish

between the value — it's entirely an irrational process? but
I can’t distinguish between a person wanting fco get out out of
fear and say how much of that he attributes to a decrease in
value, hoi-? much of it he does it because he doesn't like to
live in an integrated community, how much of it he

attributes

because ha dislikes minorities,
QUESTIONS Well. Wiliingbor© is an integrated
community. I understand,
MR. GOTTLIEB:

Willingboro is an absolutely

integrated community, block by block,
QUESTION: And therefore, presumably, the people who
live there are, if they don't like it, they are at least quite
willing to live in one, aren't -they?

You didn't mean an

integrated community, you meant an all-one-race community.

MR. GOTTLIEB:

I just want to make it absolutely clear, however, that
r

in fact that action of Willingboro was not to affect prospective
"** ’as shown by tee statistics, because it didn't have that

40

impact

but present residents of the community.
As to the First Amendment argument, obviously

petitioners contend there is a violation.

It is Willingboro’s

response that there must be* although commercial speech is not
wholly outside of the protection of the First Amendment* there
must be afforded a leaser degree of protection, and that is
based on the Court’s recognition, I believe Icm quoting from
Virginia Pharmacy, of the common-sense differences between
commercial speech and philosophical or economic or political
speech, or newspapers, or anything like that.
And, indeed, the Court itself has long recognized th©
obvious distinction in a billboard situation, and I need only
refer back to Packer vse Utah, which I believe is a case out
of til© early 1930’s.

The Court has continued to recognize

that,, and I might refer to the concepts developed in Lehman vs.
Shaker Heights, where the community is, in Willingboro‘s
situation, having this "thrust upon" concept, "forest of signs".
If, in fact, you as a judge may not believe that 200and-some signs is sufficient to create a "forest", I would
submit that if, in fact, because of th© way the public perceives
it, if in fact they believed there to be a "forest of signs53,
if in fact they reacted out of fear, if they were dominated by
this fear, they are th® determining guidelines, as to determine
whether* or not the signs had tills impact.
With respect to the First Amendment, it clearly shows

41
there was a deceptive impact.

The signs were the catalyst for

a process of resegreg&fcion.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. HAUCH, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HAUCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, I*d just

like, to,

in response to Mr. Justice Stewart*s inquiry with respect to
the record on the ordinance, clarify one point.
There are, in a residential zone, permitted specific
recreational activities of a private nature.

Xsm referring to

A14, if Your Honor please, of the Appendix, which contains
the ordinance.
On page A14, in Section 6.4, we see that there are
permitted signs advertising a golf course, country club,
private swimming club, — I suppose that would include "Swim
for a dollar a day" — marina, meaning a slip, I suppose that
would include for a boat, tennis court, "two dollars an hour"
or "five dollars an hour" to play.

That would be permitted.

And also equestrian trails, advertising a private stable, I
suppose you could advertise a stable for rent.
So the permission is granted to some private

activities»
