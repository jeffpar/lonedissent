MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear argument

next in 76-539, Dayton Board of Education against Brinkman.
Mr. Greer, I think you nay proceed when you're ready,,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. GREER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GREER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I am David Greer, and I am here representing the
Dayton, Ohio, Board of Education.
The paramount issue which we present involves the
proper fashioning of an equitable remedy in a school desegre­
gation case.

The basic principle is clear.

The nature of

the violation determines the scope of the remedy.
Our concern is with the application of that principle
to a case where the finder of the facts determined that only
limited segregatory practices exist as opposed to a dual
system either mandated or under the Keyes standard.
Our contention is -that a system-wide racial balance
remedy, as was mandated here by the Sixth Circuit, cannot be
justified equitably or constitutionally by such factual
I

findings.
Most of the factual contentions that were raised by
the plaintiffs in this action were resolved after an extended
trial some five years ago in favor of the Board of Education.

4
Three findings were determined by the finder of the
facts to constitute what it termed a cumulative violation of
the Constitution,,

Those three findings were a conditicn of

racial imbalance in the schools of the Dayton system* rescision
of resolutions that had been enacted by a lama duck school
board* and the existence of optional zones between certain
schools in the system»
Th© trial court specifically found* and in its
opinion after th© first remand* in

reviewing the Keyes

decision which came up while this case was in process*
specifically found that at no time did the defendant maintain
a dual system of education* and specifically found that this
case does not involve actions taken on a school~by-schoo1
basis* but* rather* segregatory practices»
The first, finding that was made in this case* 5.
condition of racial imbalance* does not amount to a violation
of the Constitution of this country.
The finding with respect to rescision of resolutions,
I think it is clear under the ruling of the Sixth Circuit and
the law in tills area* can only be considered a violation of a
constitutional duty to the extent that a constitutional duty
to act existed at the time the original resolutions were
adopted»
QUESTION: Do I understand that you’re saying the
finding that, there was a lack of racial balance* -that is* that

5

the schools did not each reflect the total composition of the
community is an erroneous finding.

You're attacking that

finding, are you?
MR* GREER:
misunderstood.

No., Your Honor, I don’t mean to be

There is no question, it was conceded at the

outset that there is racial imbalance in the schools in the
Dayton system.

The issue is that the racial —~

QUESTION:

Well, you’re attacking the conclusion

that flows from that finding, namely that that’s a constitu­
tional violation?
MR, GREER:

And it’s clear under the case law that

it is not a constitutional violation unless that condition
exists, because of intentional segregatory acts of the school
board.

And the finding in this case was simply that there

was a condition of racial imbalance and that it was consistent
with idle dispersement of the population in the Dayton area.
In other words, the evidence referred to actual
census tracts, as to where the populations were located, and
the trial court specifically found that the racial balance
or imbalance that existed in the Dayton schools reflected
exactly what the residential racial imbalance in the community
was,
I would also point out in this regard the court’s
findings, and there were facts that were as indisputable as
the racial imbalance in the schools, that the boundaries of

6
the various schools in this area had seen no modifications to
amount to anything for a period of some twenty years before
this suit was filed* and that, as the population in the Dayton
area moved, so changed the percentages of black to white students
in the various schools serving the residential areas«,
The point that I want to make with regard to the
three findings in this case is that there is only one of those
findings that, standing alone, could be considered a violation
of the equal protection clause of the Constitution.
The crux or the keystone of the findings of fact in
this case was idle finding with respect to optional zones,
small areas between two schools where a student living in
the area would have an option of going to either of those
two s chools.
Tha findings of fact here were that those optional
areas, and there were some 150 of them at one point in the
history of the school were generally placed there because of
the choica of walking one more block to school sjs opposed to
going over railroad tracks or Wolf Creek or what-have-you.
The court did find and mentioned four, out of all
of these optional zonas, that may have had — I think was the
court's phrase — some racial significance at the time of their
creation.

The court found as a. fact that the majority of

these zones had no racial significance at the time of their
creation, and it further found that none of the elementary

7
school optional zones had any racial significance of any kind
at the time this lawsuit was filed»
That left three of the four optional zones mentioned
by the court as having any racial significance at the time of
the filing of this lawsuit* and is set forth in our brief, and
I won't try to go through all the factual arguments here or
the factual findings»

It's clear that the effect of these

three zones, which were high school optional zones, was limited
and minimal»
The reason we are here before you this afternoon is
that these factual findings have triggered off a systemwi.de
remedy in the Dayton School District by which each and every
school in the system is required to reflect the systemwide
racial balance plus or minus 15 porcent»
In the brief which we filed, we were confident
enough of our position to state not only that the remedy here
must be rewritten, but a Is o that the only way that the
plaintiffs could hope to avoid a rewriting- of the remedy would
be to rewrite the factual findings»
And I submit that's exactly what this Court has been
requested to

do in the various briefs that have been filed in

opposition to our position»
The plaintiff's brief tacitly concedes cur position»
It does not attempt to justify the systemwide remedy on the
basis of the facts that were found»

First, it attempts to

stretch the factual findings beyond their evidentiary content?
and, second, it challenges the failure of the trial court to
adopt the plaintiff's position on the other factual issues
presented.
The Justice Department8s brief, in a more straightforward manner, explicitly and expressly concedes our position.,
The brief says, and I have it to quote to you because, if I
have to quote somebody, I like to quote my adversary when I
can,
QUESTION:

The brief agrees with you on the facts,

is that it?
HR, GREER:
three-part cumulative

The brief agrees with us that the
violation that the Court found would

not support the remedy that has been imposed,
QUESTION:
MR, GREER:

And the agreement ends there, I think.,
Then we get down to the point of

rewriting the facts, Mr, Justice White, and I would propose to
■the Court four separate reasons why you shouldn't succumb to
temptation, if it is a temptation, to adopt that kind of an
argument, establish a whole new brand of law in this area,
and, in essence, what I think these four reasons should
satisfy you, I hope, is that you should accept the facts as
found by the trier of the facts and adjust the remedy,
rather than accepting the remedy and adjusting the findings
of fact

9

First, I would submit that the facts in this case,
including the fact of a non-dual system in either the
statutory or the Keyes sense of the term, have been determined
as the law provides they should be determined, and no appeal
was taken by -die plaintiffs from the trial court's findings
as to a non-dual system.
Secondly, I v;ould point out that there was

no

finding of intentionally segregative school board actions in
a significant or meaningful portion of 'the school system,
and that there was therefore no basis for shifting to school
authorities the burden of proving that racially imbalanced
schools within the system were not the result of intentionally
segregative actions.
QUESTION;

What if we disagree with you on -that?

MR, GREER;

If you disagree with me, I think you —

QUESTION;

On that particular point,

MR, GREER:

On that particular point?

QUESTION;

Then what?

MR, GREER:

That’s the question of was it in a

meaningful or significant section of the school, then there
would be a shift of burden, and I think my response to that
would be clear.

And that’s really my third point here.

And

that is that even if the burden were shifted — the school
board didn't sit silent through 'these three or four weeks of
hearings, we did present evidence on each of these issues

10

•that was presented, and -the facts in the record support a
finding that even if the Keyes presumption had been called
into effect, the presumption is, after all, a rebuttable
presumption, and the trial court found that the arguments
that were made should be rejected, and that the racial
imbalance in the schools in the system was not the result
of intentional segregafcory actions by the school board*
QUESTION; Well, do you think the United States
challenges the rules of law applied by the district court or
the Court of Appeals?
MR. GREERs

As I understand the Justice Department’s

position, which I must confess I received in 'the fifth day of
a trial that I am presently engaged in in Cincinnati, after
completely agreeing with all my position in this ease, they
would ask this Court to look to the record, make an all-new
finding of fact, which is contrary to the findings of fact
that have been mad©, take historical practices -that exist or
historical situations that happened in 1926 or in 1933, and
then, by some leap of logic, presume by that that there was
in fact a dual system in Dayton as of 1954„
This gets into a whole lot of factual arguments
which have been made, and I might point out that today we
did file with the clerk, to supplement the record, the brief
that we had filed in the Sixth Circuit on our initial appeal
in this case, where it went through those facte*

11
QUESTIONS

You mentioned three of your reasons for

— did you get to your fourth?
MRo GREER:

I haven’t gotten to it» —

QUESTION: All right®
MRo GREER:

—- but I'll do that right now» Your

Honor.
The fourth reason ~~ and I think this is as good a
reason

as tie other three -- is that if the remedial goal in

a suit of this nature is» as this Court stated in Milliken»
to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the
position they would have occupied in the absence of such
conduct» a systemwide remedy is inappropriate.

Where» as here

in Dayton» the evidence establishes that the racial composition
of the schools reflected the changing racial composition of
the neighborhoods that were served by those schools and the
attendance zones and boundaries of these schools met with no
significant change over the twenty years that elapsed before
this suit was filed®
I submit to this Court» and to anybody else that
wants to ask me» that there would have been no difference in
the composition of the schools in the Dayton school system at
the time this lawsuit was filed» regardless of how any act in
192S or practice in 1933 or finding of fact in this case with
regard to optional zones is characterized.
Just to be specific on that point:

The schools in

12
the Dayton system as of 1954 , when the Brown, case was decided,
consisted of four schools that ware composed of an entirely
black student populationi 24 schools that had a mixed popula­
tion of blade and white students? and 21 all-white schools.
During tee twenty years that elapsed before the
filing of this suit, there were no significant boundary
changes, and the schools in these various mixtures were
affected only by population changes. There is a little pocket
in the east side of Dayton, the Washington Elementary School
serves that area, and the composition of the student body in
that, school has been somewhere around 23 or so percent
consistently through this entire twenty-year period.
Other schools during this twenty years were entirely
white in their student bodies at one point, or mixed at one
point, and as popiilation shifted the composition of the schools
shifted, so that by tee end of the period certain schools
►

were predominantly black, and you can list them.
So teat this is my fourth point that I would
present to tee Court? teat if the purpose of a remedy in this
kind of a case is to restore a condition teat -would have
existed but for constitutional violations, there is no basis
hare for a systemwide remedy.
New, I'm sure tee Court's going to have a lot of
questions for rae as well as for my opponents, those are our
four main answers to what has bean an effort, as I see it.

13

to try to persuade this Court to rewrite the facts, I don't
think that that is a request, that should be accepted by this
Court®

W© are not here, it seems to me, to determine the

correctness of the trial court's findings®
What we are here to determine is to whether the
findings of fact that have been made in this case support the
remedy that has been imposed®
It seems to me what the Department of Justice and
what the plaintiffs in this case are asking is that this
Court designate itself and the Circuit Courts of Appeals as
fact-finding commissions in every school desegregation case
tliat is filed®
That, I submit, is not a proper appellate function,
and that is, I submit, the job of -the trier of the facts, the
trial court, who has ‘the opportunity to develop those facts
on a witness-by-witness basis through the pressure of crossexamination and through examination of -the witnesses®
Now, as far as the historical facts that are
attempted to be put together out of a cold record in the
brief that was filed by the Department of Justice, I would
submit that those facts simply leave great logical gaps that
were filled in at the trial of this case®
There has not been any instance cited to this Court,
because there is none available for citation, where a student
in the Dayton school system was ever excluded from any school

14
because of his race*

There was an instance back in 1926 when

a group of students at an elementary school, Garfield, were
taught in a separate building behind the main school that was
the subject of a suit in 1926, and that practice was eliminated,
and that practice existed and was eliminated some four
generations of students before this case was filed.
.QUESTION:

Mr, Greer, you told us at the outset the

three facts on v/hich the district court found a cumulative
constitutional violation*

First, the fact that the schools

were racially imbalanced, the individual schools!
MR, GREER:
QUESTION:

Correct*
— two, the rescision of the resolution?

and three, the optional

20as.

And you admitted to us that the first and the second
wore not in themselves constitutional violations*

What did

the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit say about the
first and the second?
MR* GREER:

They said essentially the same thing*

They affirmed the finding that there was a cumulative viola­
tion, they didn’t pass —
QUESTION:

How could it be cumulative if there’s

only one?
MR* GREER:

Your Honor, I am lost, in that semantic

problem myself, but I gather that the Sense in which they used
the term "cumulative" is that the innocuous fact of racial

15

imbalance, coupled with an 0ptd.9n.al zone that: could aggravate
that racial imbalance between two schools., when looked at
together or cumulatively, could be considered a constitutional
violation.

I think that is the sense in which the court meant

to use that term.

I think -that makes some sense.

QUESTION: And you concede — you tell me if I'm
mistaken in nv understanding ~~ I understood you to concede that
the optional zones.» at least soma of them* with respect to
some of the schools, the high schools, some of the high schools,
could validly be found to have been violative of the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. GREER:

Vie are not challenging the findings of

the trier of the fact, which were the law
QUESTION:

Well, you told us that this ---

MR. GREER:

— were the law, that’s true.

Our

position is, and ws've set it forth in the brief, there was
only one of these -that amounted to anything at all, if you
take the tables that are attached in the Appendix as to ’due
populations of these various schools, you'll find even that
optional zone, which was between Roosevelt and Colonel White
High Schools, and existed essentially unchanged during this
period except for -the addition of two city blocks at one
point, affected something like one-half of one percent or
one percent of the black students in the entire system.
QUESTION;

So you do not concede that the optional

16

zones,which concededly violated the equal protection clause,,
resulted in this racial imbalance?
MR. GRERRs

V7e certainly do not concede that, and I

think I'd fly in the face of the record to suggest it, Your
Honor.
I have reserved some time for my rebuttal, if I may,
and I would like to take that time now.

Isd just like to say
«

one more thing with respect to the optional zones.
The finding of intent her©, which we concede and
then don't argue with, was that while most of these optional
zones were placed there out of perfectly honest and neutral
considerations, that, for example, if you even take the one
that’s a problem, the one between Roosevelt and Colonel White,
we've got the Dayton Tire and Rubber Company, we've got
Wolf Creek, we've got Railroad Tracks, we had at one time this
Dayton Stockyards, that presented soma problem for children
going to the closer of those two schools.
But -the court found that in determining the optional
zones, the school board did take into account feelings of
the community, whether they wanted it or not, and in that
respect some insidious intent may have crept into the
decision in these few zones.
But certainly what we don't concede is that there
was any meaningful or substantial portion of this district
affected

17
QUESTION: Well, that would affect, at the most., in
your submission, the racial make-up of the student body in
no more than two high schools, is that it?
MR. GREERs
QUESTION!
HR. GREER:

Three high, schools,,
Three high schools0
Because there is also the high school

Kiser involved in another one of the optional zones, where
there was a finding.
QUESTION;

There's a Dunbar in there somewhere,

isn91 there?
MR. GREER:

Dunbar was an optional school which

wasn't involved in this finding. Dunbar, at the time this
suit was filed, had its own district attendance boundaries
just like any oilier school.
There was a time when Dunbar was an optional school,
in the Mens® that any black student living anywhere in the
city could have hie choice of attending either the school in
his area or Dunbar High School.
QUESTION: When did til at practi.ce cease?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:

1962, I believe it was.
IIow many high schools are there in the

Dayton School District?
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:
Dayton Area?

There are ten at present.
Whet's the population of the Greater

18

Dees the record show?
HR. GREER:

1 will probably be assassinated by the

Chamber of Commerce if I concede that the population of
Dayton changes by whatever means that they use to assess it,
whether it be the 90-minute market or the exact boundaries of
the city. The school population is* at these relevant times,
set forth in the Appendix, and I!d have to check it or use
my brains that are seated at the table here to give it to you
precisely.
QUESTION: Were you served with a copy of the motion
for leave to file the brief of amicus?
MR. GREER:

I received it in the middle of an opening

statement last Friday, Your Honor, yes.

And I have no

objection to their filing an amicus brief.
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

It is late, you

know.

I realize it’s late, and I have not

had a chance to respond to it.
QUESTION:
MR, GREER:

But you do not oppose it?
No, I do not oppose it.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS R. LUCAS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LUCAS:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

In answer, first, to the question Hr, Justice
Rahnquist asked, I believe the population, at least the
figures we had in our brief, is 250,000o
QUESTIONS

Does that go outside of Montgomery County

at all, or is it well within Montgomery County?
MR. LUCAS:

I believe the city is entirely within

Montgomery County, Your Honor*
QUESTION:

How about the school district?

MR. LUCAS:

The school district does go beyond the

limits of the city, but not beyond the limits of the county.
QUESTION:

And this 250,000 population figure you

gave us was for what, the school population or the total
population of the school district, —
MR. LUCAS:
QUESTION:
MRo LUCAS:
QUESTION:
MR. LUCAS:

No, that’s the city of Dayton.
— or the population of the city?
That’s the city of Dayton, Your Honor.
Of all ages and sexes?
That's correct.

The pupil population

is 45,000, slightly less than 50 percent of whom are black.
Our argument to this Court is really in two basic
parts.
There was in Dayton, Ohio, in 1954 a de jure sagra­
ga tod system, a dual system, end that pre-Drown dual system
was never dismantled until the; district court finally ordered
a systemwide plan of desegregation.

20
QUESTION:

Well, didn't the court find to the

MR» LUCAS:

I think that finding —

contrary?

QUESTION s They found that there was not a dual
system, I thought»
MR» LUCAS:

As a fact»
Well, I think that the district court's

definition of "’dual” is probably relevant and it’s a definition
that was suggested by the defendants»

We've referred to it
»

in our brief®
What they suggested was, in order to have a dual
system, it had to be required by State law»
QUESTION: Well, didn't the district court find that
there was not a dual system?
MR® LUCAS:
Your Honor»

I think in that context, yes, he did,

And I refer to

QUESTION;

Well, isn’t it broader than that?

MR» LUCAS:

Ho, sir, I think that the ---

QUESTIONs

Didn't they really find that th© dual

system had been dismantled?
MR» LUCAS:

;

Your Honor, I think you have to

distinguish here between the facts that

were in dispute and

called for the district, court to resolve them, and the facts
which were not disputed and which, during this lengthy trial
that’s been referred to, were not contested in. any way» There
was no evidence offered to th© contrary»

21

And if I may just: quickly summarize —QUESTION;

May I just ask quickly , Mr, Lucas;
%

Dayton doesn't object to the filing of this brief amicus
by the Uni toad States; do you?
MR. LUC/vS;

Mo, Your Honor, wa do not.

In Dayton in 1954 you had five schools, which we re
100 percent black.

There was the Garfield school, which we

detailed its establishment, and which was not controverted at
the trial, Garfield started off with the black students in a
back room and then in an annex in back»

When the black

population grew, the Garfield school was converted, whites
were assigned out, and the faculty was flip-flopped in
classic style, so that it was all black»
During that period of time, while there were black
students in separate rooms in the Garfield school, or in
the annex in back, black teachers were not permitted to
teach white children.

That was the express. stated policy

which was a change from the previous policy of the Dayton
Board, which was not to hire blacks.

That,-too, is not in

dispute.
QUESTION;
MR» LUCAS:

What year was this?.
That, school was established in 1912,

1 believe, and it continued forward, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. LUCAS:

But you're speaking as of 1954.
As of 1954, that's correct.

22

QUESTION: So your response to Mr0 Justice Powell
is 854, isn't it?
MR. LUCAS:

In '54 it was 100 percent black.

Dut

its origins obviously go forward.
The Willard school is again another school where the
black population increased, where black teachers wer© not
permitted to teach white children, and whan a sufficient
number of black students was in that school, so that it became
crowded in terms of black enrollment, the white students were
assigned out.
QUESTION: Can you give us some focus as to time,
counsel?

As to when these particular events took placa?
MR. LUCAS:

Garfield and Willard, they are in the

brief, Your Honor, and I'm sorry I don't have the handle on
that, as I should.
QUESTION:

Are you speaking of 1954 or 1975?

MR. LUCAS:

I am saying these schools existed in

1954, but how they got to be black schools is detailed in the
record and not controverted.
There was no testimony that the flip-flop of faculty
did not take place.

Thera was no testimony that the black

annex out in back did not exist, and the testimony by live
witnesses who were in those schools when, as Mrs. Louise Troy
testified, she had been in the system as a teacher for forty
years and never permitted to teach a white child.

There's no

23
contradiction of that.
QUESTIONS

How many opinions of how many courts

have intervened since then?

That is, in this case.

had three district court opinions?
MR. LUCAS:

You’ve

Have there been?

Well, if you include all the orders,

I suppose tliere are four or five orders that are in the record.
There are two, really, opinions, and the third ruling on
remedy after the second remand from the Court of Appeals»
What I’m saying to the Court is that these matters
were not in dispute»

As counsel states, at the time of

Brown, there were the black schools»
Now, in Wogaman, this school in 1945 was built in
conjunction with the DeSoto Bass housing project, which was
a black housing project»
The Dunbar school, which has been discussed, was in
existence as a high school through 1962»

Nov/, it served more

than the traditional high school grades» At various times it
served grades 7 through 12»

That school had a black faculty

assigned to it, and under Dayton’s rules, black teachers could
not teach white children? so it was a city wide dual over»
lapping zone» And again that’s not contested, and it’s set
forth in the opinion of the district court,
QUESTION s

And was that true at the time this lawsuit,

was brought?
MR, LUCASs

That was true at the time the lawsuit

was brought: v/ith respect to a new school named Dunbar? that
the old Dunbar school was closed in 1962? changed its name
and became McFarlane.

And at that time two of the previous

black elementary schools in that area were closedc When those
two schools were closed? they were assigned to the McFarlane,
which was the old Dunbar high school? a new Dunbar -QUESTION;

This suit was brought when?

1971?

MR. LUCAS;

Yes? that's correct.

QUESTION;

And at that time — I ju3t want to be

sure — are you telling us that at the time this suit was
initiated Dayton was operating a dual school system in terms
of racial segregation?
MR. LUCAS;

That is clearly our position? Your

Honor.
QUESTION;

And the district court found that it was

not, didn*t i t?
MR. LUCAS;

I think as the district court used the

term "dual85 in terms of mandated segregation? you have to
consider the position taken by -the defendants ? and I think
the understanding of the district court of that word "dualism”»
The defendants argued in the Court of Appeals in
the first appeal that the Brown I duly applied only to those
school districts where a dual system was compelled or
authorised by statute? and has no applicability where a
statutory dual system has never existed.

That was the context

25

that the district court was talking about dualism.
QUESTION: Well, was. it — are you tailing us that
in 1971, at the time this litigation was commenced, that black
teachers were not allowed to teach white children?
MR. LUCAS:

No, Your Honor, that was changed as a

result of action taken by HEW, where it advised the district
that they had racially motivated assignment of teachers and
staff, and an agreement was ultimately worked out that
resulted in the reassignment of the faculty.
QUESTION:

In nineteen —

But here, as we've been told, and as I

understood it in reading the briefs, that there were three facto
found as cumulative constitutional violations.
One, racial imbalance in the schools as da facto?
two, the rescision of a resolution by the school board? and
%

three, certain optional attendance zones in soma of the high
schools.

Period.

That those were th© three.

You're telling to, or do I misunderstand you, that
there were really in fact many, many more?
MR. LUCAS:

I think there were many more facto

found, and I think some of those facts go to make up the
pattern of racially identifiable schools

.that the district

court noted end the Court of Appeals noted.
QUESTION:

Well, -there were racially identifiable

schools in terms of sens of them being maybe all-black

03:

predominantly blade, and others all-whit© or predominantly

26

whit®»

That’s not argued about# I understand,
MR, LUCAS:

Well# it’s our position# I think the

record is undisputed# that those schools# as of 1954 —
QUESTIONS

No# we9re talking about the commencement

of this litigation,
MR, LUCAS;

-- as of the time of trial.

Your Honor# I think both in 1954 and at the time of
trial,
QUESTION: Well# let's just confine ourselves to this
lawsuit,

Lots of things went on in the past,
MR, LUCAS:

I think this lawsuit — at the time

of trial we had unremedied pre-1954 violations# and a dual
system which imposed a duty on the school, board from that
point forward to disestablish the segregation that was extant
at teat time«>

We have continuing —

QUESTION:

But the district court did find# and

Justice Stewart has asked you this twice and I still don't
have your answer to it — the district court did find that
Dayton did not have a dual system# did it not?
MR, LUCAS:
QUESTION:

The district court —
You are perfectly free to qualify your

answer, or raspond in any way# but surely you can give a yes
or no answer,
MR, LUCAS:

Yes# Your Honor# the district court did

use those words# and I think that that's what it meant# as I

27

have already explained to Hr, Justice Stewart» And I didn't
mean to avoid your question»
QUESTION;

Well, what I understood you to say

befor€3r what was meant was a statutorily required dual
system»
MR» LUCAS;
QUESTION;

I think that ™~
That when they said there was no dual

system, that's what they were talking about»
MR» LUCAS;
QUESTION;
MR» LUCAS;

That's correct, Your Honor»
Is that what you -- is that your answer?
That's exactly what I mean, and I

think that's exactly what the district court was talking about,
because that was the dispute ~~
QUESTION;

That it was in fact a dual, you're

saying —
MR» LUCAS;
QUESTION;

That is correct»
— a segregated dual school system, but

it was not required by any statute or any lav/ of Ohio»

Is

the,t it?
MR» LUCAS;
QUESTION s

That is precisely our position»
There was no law in Ohio, if ever,

and certainly not since before the Civil War»
MR» LUCAS;

That has been our position, and that

is why we did not understand the argument that was constantly
presented by the defendants that Brown standards did not apply

28

and could not

refer to any of the Brown cases in analysing

the facts in Dayton and applying the legal standard to those
facts,, because there was no statutory dual system»

We do

not seas that that is the law or correct application of it»
If I may* the 1954 — in addition to Dunbar as a
cit.ywi.ds school, you had the Miami Chapel school, which was
established in 1953»

It is undisputed in this record that

in 1953 the Miami Chapel school was an all-black school»
So that you had a discreet uncontradicted policy of
racial assignment of faculty that applied to every school
in the system»

That was systemwide segregation» We had a

systemwide high school,dual overlapping high school zone in
the classic tradition, ex* blacks at Dunbar.
We had also in 1952 a reorganization, which is
characterized in this record as the West Side Reorganization.
%

There you had an expanding black population»

In order to

provide school space for that population, the defendants
contracted the boundaries of the original black

,

They made them tighter boxes

schools.

locked them into those boxes

and expanded the bouzidari.es of the periphery schools, which
already had substantial black enrollments, inward to give
them a larger share of that black population.
At the same time they cancelled their open transfer
policy, which had permitted whites to get out of any
situation where they did not want to stay, but instead

29

substitutted fox it. a series of optional attendance zones
around the West Side schools on the white side of the periphery,
allowing whites to get out of those schools.
Simultaneously with that? and in the context of their
policy on faculty , they began assigning black teachers to those
schools f so that those schools eventually became identified
as the new black schools0
QUESTION:

Wien was this?

MR, LUCAS:

This happened in 1952, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Aren't we really concerned with what the

facts were in 1971 when this lawsuit was brought?
MR. LUCAS:

Your Honor, the facts in 1971 are a

product of what happened in the establishment of the central
black board •—
QUESTION: Well, each of us a product of his heritage
and of his enrivonment, whether he be a human being or a
societal entity.

But we're concerned here with what the

facts were in 1971 when this litigation was initiated, are we
not?
MR, LUCAS:

That’s correct, and at the time of trial,

Your Honor, the Dayton Board had just ended as of '71, the
racial assignment, the racially motivated assignment of
faculty to schools.
However, the effects of that racially motivated
assignment still persisted, because schools were still

30

identified as white or black0
At the time of trial we had 69 schools, 49 of those
schools were 90 percent or more black or white? they had 21
black schools and 2 8 white schools,,
QUESTION: Well, doesn’t your black and white school
argument depend on an underlying finding that there was a
dual school system?
MR* LUCAS:

I think what is required is a finding

that there was a pattern of de jure segregation at the time of
Brown or thereafter, or that the segregation that existed
pre-Brown, at the time of Brown, and throughout this period,
as detailed in far more detail than I can in this argument -whether or not that —
QUESTION:
MR. LUCAS:

Is fiiere any
— affected substantially the district

so as to shift the burden to it to go forward and demonstrate
that the segregation is not. its responsibility, and I don’t
think it met that burden in —
QUESTION:

Was there anything unconstitutional, as

such, say, in 1926, about a .school board segregating on the
basis of race?
MR* LUCAS:

Yes, Your Honor, there is.

Because if

it were not, then in 1954 no school district in the South,
which had segregated its schools pursuant to State law or,
in the North, pursuant to its own will, it would not be

31
faulted if that same school remained an all-black school in
1971„ as it did when this case was brought0
QUESTIONS

V/ell, but the laws requiring attendance

of only one race at a school would certainly be struck down
by Brown?
MR. LUCAS;

That8 s correcto

But the fact that

it was done in 1929, whether it was done by the action of the
school board in segregating that school, in assigning students
in a manner which created foreseeably the segregation in that
school, would not be excused by -the fact it was done in 1929,
if the effects of the original assignment persisted today.
QUESTION:

But you say then the Act in 1929 was

illegal and -that the school board, in effect, should have
foreseen that 25 years later Brown would have overruled Plessy
MR, LUCAS:

I think that the actions of a school

board iti segregating students is illegal, whether it was done
in 1929 or 1971 or 1977.
Brown.

I think that is the teaching of

I think that is the application of the Fourteenth

Amendments

Otherwise, everybody who acted before Brown is

excused.
I'd like to detail, if I can,because I think it's
particularly important and affects the district in a system­
wide way, the facts with respect to faculty in the changing
policy.
In 1952 the board changed its policy only slightly,

32
but did so in. such a way? I think, to further maximise the
racial insult of that policy,,
What it said was that soma whites ba assigned to
Negro schools, where there previously were only Negro teachers,
but there would be no assignments of whites to those schools
against their will0

And said that Negro teachers would

be

mixed in white schools only where the whites evidence that they
are ”ready to accept Negro teachers”»
That policy persisted in Dayton effectively until
the 1969 agreement with HEN, which went into effect in 19 71»
That sort, of systemwide historic policy,that is not disputed waj
intentional, affects the racial identifiability of every
school in the system, it affects the kinds of decisions that
were made and is the exact environment for segregation that
this Court has talked about in Swann»
The government argues, and I think it tracks the
argument in our brief, that there are a number of undisputed
facts in the record»

In addition to the three specifics,

whether they be stated in summary form or be limited to just
the words as they appear» And I ‘think you can, I think thedistrict judge was talking cumulatively, and I think the
Court of Appeals was speaking in general terms *

Not as

precise as this Court might like or we might like, but,
nevertheless, plainly»
QUESTION;

Do you agree with the government's brief?

33

MRe LUCAS;

Yes, we do.

QUESTION:

So you disagree with the Court of Appeals?

MRo LUCAS;

We think that the Court of Appeals was

not as precise as it might have been, and all we think the
Court of ?vppaa.ls —
QUESTION:

Well now, what do you mean by that?

Do you agree with it or don't you?
MR.

LUCAS:

Well, I think that the Court of Appeals'

decision is not —
QUESTION; Well, I'll put it this way:

do you dis­

agree with the Court of Appeals as much as the government
does?
MR. LUCAS:

Mot as much, Your Honor, because we

don’t read that as —
QUESTION:

Well, then, you don't agree with the

government.
MR. LUCAS:
Your Honor.

I think it's a matter

of emphasis,

We agree basically with the government’s position.

What we don't agree with is that the Sixth Circuit misunder­
stood the facts; in the record that was before them, the
arguments it was presented, and thought that they ware only
ruling on racial imbalance.
QUESTION:

Well, for you to win here, do you have to

convince us that the Court of Appeals misunderstood the facts?
MR. LUCAS:

No, I don’t think I have to convince

34
this Court that the Court of Appeals misunderstood the facts Q
I think for us feo prevail, we have to show that the judgments
and not all of the language or all of the reasoning of the
Court of Appeals, hut that the judgment they made are supported
by the record, the undisputed evidence, and the facts that were
found by all of the courts below.
I think the Court of Appeals has reversed the district
court in so far as the district court thought that "dual" meant
State-imposed, or that there was not da jure segregation;
because the Court of Appeals spelled it out.
They thought
V
clearly enough when i^ said, "Look, when we were talking about
segregation, we meant de jure segregation."

They said that

on the second appeal.
QUESTION:

Well, what are your — you disagree with

the Court of Appeals to some extent; you think they applied a
wrong legal standard?
MR. LUCAS:

1 think they did not articulate -the

legal standard or the full basis for their opinion, as clearly
as they might, and I think that’s what the government is
saying.
QUESTION: Well, let’s assume for the moment that the
Court of Appeals did not articulate the right legal standard,
or view the facts in the light of the right legal standard.
Wouldn’t normally we

if we agreed with you, wouldn’t

normally we say what the right legal standard is and remand?

35
MR, LOCAS;

I think that if the district -- if the

Court of —
QUESTION;

Well, wouldn’t we normally do that.?

MR, LUCAS;

I think that normally this Court, if the

Court of Appeals has applied the wrong legal standard, does
vacate and remand it for application to the correct legal
standard,

I don't think that's what happened,

I think what

the Court of Appeals did was fail to spell out in detail all
of tli© bases for its conclusions,
QUESTION;

You say they did apply the right

legal standard, but they didn't spell out how they did
MR, LUCAS:

it?

They didn't articulate it as clearly as

it might or —
QUESTION:

And they didn’t understand the facts very

well, I take it?
MR, LUCAS:
well,

I think they understood the facts vary

I think they felt that it was not necessary to spall

out everything that was admitted in the request for admissions,
or everything that the par-ti.es were not in dispute about, and
therefore required no adversary findings by any court,
I think that the record overwhelmingly supports it, and,
as the government points out, you5 re not going to get a stronger
set of facts in a non-de jure state, if you will, upon which
a district court can base a judgment.

I think that the

Court of Appeals has rendered the right decision, and I think

36

that any arguments t
plans

this sort of plan is a racial balance

falls on the face of the facts»

Whatever terminology

problems the district court or the Court of Appeals may have
had- they do not support a finding that there was a racial
balance argued0
It seems to be a problem if a district judge puts
in his opinion a number today, other than the page numbers at
the bottom of the page,, then he's accused of ordering racial
balance? and I don't know what they can do because a balance,
is between 1 and 100 percent»

And if they don't give some

guidance to the school boards, the school boards come back and
ask for them» They ask for some outlines, some perimeters»
And this, the figures used here, are not pulled out
of the air» They are not some professor's theory, they are
based on the facts in the system»

And, incidentally, the plan

actually ultimately ordered by the district court is quite
similar to the plan adopted by the original board before the
new board cams in and cancelled it»
It just took five years of litigation to get the
plan that the Dayton Board, after studying itself, — and the
Board members admitted the violations ? and their admissions
are not out of whole cloth, there's a basis in fact for those
admissions»

And for us to say that has no effect and no

probative value is to say that because a new board comas in,
then whatever the old board admitted, whatever statements they

37
made# whatever policies they declare# have no effect? and I
think this Court’s opinions teach us otherwise*
QUESTION; And# Mr* Lucas# this decree of the district
court — who was it# Judge Rubin?
MR* LUCAS;
QUESTION s

Judge Rubin? yes# sir*
-- provided that there not be more

than# what# a 15 percent deviation in any school?
MR* LUCAS; Plus or minus*

It’s really one™third/two-

thirds range# and the actual operation of the plan ended up
with a broader range; and we specify the statistics# I think
it’s 44 percent either way*
But# as I say# 1 to 100 is a range# too*
QUESTION;

Yes# certainly it is*

But basically it

was a 15 percent plus or minus in any school?
MR* LUCAS:

Thatwas the target# the guidelines to

start with# to work from.
QUESTION; And as of a particular precise date or
time# there was no continuing
MR* LUCAS;

That is correct.

As a matter of fact# —

QUESTION;

— jurisdiction# was there?

You make

that point# I think# in your brief,
MR* LUCAS;

— the Court of Appeals

cautioned

against any such interpretation# even though -they found no
basis for the defendant's suggestion that the court had
ordered sort® sort of annual adjustments or constant super™

38

vision by a federal course
And Judge Rubin was very careful to tell the boards
"If you've got any changes you want to make, if you've got any
problems, if you've got any schools you think should not be
included in this plan, if you have any practical problems,
you come in and show me»'’
There was no such motion since the
are recited in the record,

motions that

most of which the court went

along with» The only thing he didn’t go along with was allowing
the board to delay desegregation another three years, to phase
it in, and I think that’s entirely proper, consistent with
the record»
QUESTION: The decree did not provide or envision
periodic review to maintain this sort of school population *
in issue, did it?
MR« LUCAS:

1 would say that the district court in

this case was extraordinarily careful to say he didn't want
to be the Superintendent»
defendants that

He went out of his way to tell the

they were going to run the schools, and

that he specifically said that he did not require them to
maintain something now and forever, or for his lifetime»
There's no such problem in this case, and I think any
suggestion based on this record is just out of order, it just
doesn’t fit the facts»
QUESTION:

Do you think the racial balance, 15 per-

39

cent plus or minus* is compatible with the standax'ds laid
down in Swann and reasserted in the first Milliken v„ Bradley
case?
MR® LUCASs

I think the starting point* which is all

it is* is appropriate* it's no differant, as we compare it,
to the starting point in Swann,

And actually it permits and

resulted in a broader ranger of the assignments.
What I would -QUESTION; Well, when you say "racial balance", 15
percent plus or minus, that doesn't sound like the starting
point that was dealt with in Swann; that sounds like the
target, does it not?
MR* LUCAS;
question of semantics.

Well, I think we have basically a
The district court did not say, "if

it ever gets beyond tills point you have to come back to 15
percent"; he just said, "Look, this is a guideline, this is a
starting point"; and, as a matter of fact, in his last two
opinion, he specifically refers to the Swann language.
not a case where he simply wasn't aware of it.

It's

He specifically

referred to the Swann language, and cites it in a lengthy
footnote, I believe, in his second opinion.
So he knew this Court's rule, and I think he faith­
fully adhered to it, and the working out of the plan is really
the best proof, and I think that’s what this Court says in
Swann,

40

I think this Court said,, ”if we thought that the
court had ordered an exact ratio, then w@ would strike it
downo"

And I think that that's proper,

"But we'll look and

see what happened,a^d what the district judge has done, and
let's look at reality."

It's a desegregated school system,

it's by no means racially balanced, the facts are before the
court? and I think that the district judge has not in any
way suggested some sort of annual reviews or fixed adherence
to a rigid racial ratio,
QUESTION: Well, let's go back to Swann a minuta.
In Swann, as I recall the figures, it was 71/29, and at the
early stages of the litigation this was identified as the
problem.

In the Swann opinion, the Court said that if wa

thought that he had set as a target to achieve 71/29, that
being the ratio of the population of the entire school
system, we would reverse if there's no constitutional require­
ment to do that.
Now, is that relieved when you say, with 71/29, that
you can deviate 15 percent, or —
MR, LUCAS:

I think all Idle district judge was

really saying, Your Honor, and in as candid a v/ay as possible,
and I think the parties understood it this way, is:

Look, if

you. get in that range, you're going to be presumptively okay.
If you get outside of that, you've got a problem, what-haveyou? what he was trying to do was eliminate a pattern of

41
substantially disproportionate schools, and if you're talking
about disproportionate schools arising out of a constitutional
violation*, then you have to have some measuring stick»
And every school board*. I might add, Your Honor, wants one»
So they can have a target for their planning,,
And when you talk about 'working it out with buildings,
with different capacities, with different enrollments at
different grade levels, it never comes out that way»
As we say in our brief, what we have here is not
racial balance, we have typical desegregation, and it's working
in Dayton, there are no headlines about Dayton»

I think the

school board has done a good job in trying to make it work,
and there are an awful lot of people in that community with a
commitment to making it work»

And that's why you didn't read

about it in -the headlines, you didn’thav© a lot of political
posturing imposing it®
And I think there's enough criticism of school boards,
and when they do it wrong it ought to be said, and it ought to
%

be said by plaintiffs when they do it right»

They finally did

here»

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C„ GREER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GREER:
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

Thank you.
May I ask a question before you commence?
Certainly, Mr. Justice Powello

QUESTION: The optional zones have sometimes bean
referred to as a freedom of choice policy»

In the early years

after Brown, as I recall, that policy was ’thought to be
compatible with the Constitution»
Do you recall when a Court of Appeals held for the
first time that the policy was not valid? and if you do, can
you relate that to th® creation of the optional zones involved
in this case?
MR, GREER:
I can't*

I wish that I could, and specifically

It has baen a factor that's been involved in a

number of cases, -die Detroit case comas to mind, although it
was merely one, there were much more serious situations found

there»
QUESTIONs

While you're speaking -- I thought we

made the first announcement there.
MR. GREER:

I think you're correct.

QUESTION:

That wasn't in any Court of Appeals, was

MR,., GREER:

Right.

it?

QUESTION:

I think you're correct.

I think Green was the first case in this

43
Courts but my question was directed to the Court of Appeals
level»
MR» GREER:

I can51 take you back past Green* I'm

sorry,
QUESTION: Do you know whether any of these optional
sones were created after Green was handed down in 1968?
MR» GREER:

No* these were all prior to that time»

A few points that I would like to touch upon* that
I think are responsive to points that were raised in Mr»
Lucas * s argument»
First of all* so it will be precise* the date this
suit was filed was in April of 1972* rather than in 1971»
In fairness to the finder of the facts in this case*
I would like to have it clear on the record as to what his
finding was with regard to a dual system»

I think there was

soma question raised as to whether he had some mental confusion
and was thinking of dual systems solely in the context of a
statutory mandated dual system.

I think you will find that

that's clearly not the esse* and I would refer you to pages 75
and 77 of the Appendix* where he specifically talks in one
paragraph about a mandated dual system in the statutory sense*
and then goes on in another paragraph to talk about what we're
talking about is activities that were segregative* and that
at

no time was there a dual system of education maintained»
Them again on page 77 he again distinguishes:

we

44
don't; deal with a mandated dual system and we don't deal with
actions taken, on a school-*by-school basis, i.e., a Keyes type
dual system.
QUESTION :
MR. GREERi

Where are we now?

77 and 78?

Page 77 of the First Volume of the

Appendix, in the third paragraph.
QUESTION:
MR. GREER:

Yes. Third paragraph.
Now, as to the situations that were

cited as to Garfield and Willard, you’ll find that the dates
there are 1926 and 1933, I believe it is.
As far as assignment of black staffs, those events
did occur at these schools after the schools had become black
in their composition, as far as the student composition was
concerned; those events were 1936 for Garfield, 1936 for Willard,
and 1945 to Wogaman.

Long, long before this.

And, as far as

the assignment of faculty is concerned, that had nothing at
all to do, as the plaintiffs’ own expert, Dr. Green testified,
with the community perception of these schools; and of course
all occurred several generations prior to the filing of this
suit.
Tile policy as to teachers changed in 1950, and black
teachers began — or white teachers began to be assigned to
black or mixed schools. Ther® was a whole change in this
policy until a year before this suit was filed.

The faculty

in the entire Dayton school system was balanced in a system-

45
wide ratio basis in all of the schools , a year before this
suit was filed,
I don't have time, I realize, to go step-by-3tap
through the intent,

I would encapsulate it with Voltaire®s

axiom that "history can be defined as a bag of tricks played
by the dead upon the living,"
There was no trace of any of these practices at the
time this suit was filed, nor, if we go back and inquire into
intent, as far as these various practices were concerned, was
there any insidious intent at the time the practices occurred.
Nor did any of them result in the exclusion of any children
from any school because of their race,
QUESTION;

Mr, Greer, the district court's decree

has been effectuated and is now operative, is it?
MR, GREER;
QUESTION;

It is in effect, yes,
In other words, there was no stay in this

case?
MR, GREER;

No stay was granted,

QUESTION: And what was the date of the decree?
MR, GREER:

The decree was dated last March, I

believe is the data, and then affirmed by the Sixth Circuit
in June,

QUESTION!

Well# it’s certainly not a reason for

you to lose your case# I suppose®
QUESTION!

Mr. Greer# precisely what relief do you

ask?
MR. GREER:

The relief that. I ask in this case# as

I think I've stated on the last page of ray brief# is that# at
this point# this case should be dismissed.

That the violations

that were found to have been occurred have been corrected#
there are no optional zones in this system? the schools that
were affected by those zones have either bean eliminated or
they have begin structured so that they reflect the system­
wide racial balance.

to decide what additional programs they should retain# reject#
or modify in their attempt to make this a fine school system.
