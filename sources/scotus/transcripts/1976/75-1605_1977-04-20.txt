MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 75“1605, Nixon against the Administrator
of General Services Administration.
Mr. Miller, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT J. MILLER, JR., ES0o,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
This case involves the first time in the 200-year
history of our republic that Congress has seen fit to enact
legislation seising the papers, five and a half years of the
Administration of a former President of the Uni-feed States.
The core of this case, if the Court please, involves
tapes, some 5.000 hours of tapes which contain conversations
by the former President, which deal with a broad spectrum.
They range from political discussion to discussion with his
aides as to what steps, decisions should be made by the
presidency; it also deals with matters highly personal, such
as conversations with his wife, conversations with his daughter
immediately prior to her marriage, and also conversations with
his counsel, with his physician, and with his clergyman.
One problem with this case, in realising the impact
and th& effect of the legislation, is that involved is 42
million documents, as an estimate.

But, really, the core of

5
tills case are the tapes which were seised by Section 101 of
the Act in question, and the balance of the presidential
materials ,
I would like at the outset to emphasize to the Court
that Section 101(a), which seizes the tape recordings, has
no qualifying language which indicates that the seizure is
directed solely to presidential materials or the like»

There

is a wholesale seizure of those tapes0
Section 101(b) talks in terras of seizing all of the
balance of the presidential materials.

These materials which

represent the actions, both personal and private, of the
foamier President over a five and a half year period, are
currently in the control of the United States,
When Mr, Nixon left the White House, he left direc­
tions that these materials were to be forwarded to him.

This

direction was countermanded at the request of the Special
Prosecutor and subsequently the legislation in question was
enacted®
And I emphasize that this legislation, which was
an&cfced, and which seized the tapes, which seized all other
presidential materials, was enacted in haste and was enacted
without congressional hearing.
The impact of this statute on ‘die former President
and, indeed, on the presidency itself is very clear.
First, under Section 102(d) of the Act, access is

6

given to any agency or department of the United States, to
have access to the tap® recordings, to have access to any of
the presidential materials of the former President# for any
lawful government purpose.
Secondly # —QUESTION; Well# subject to the regulations which
the Administrator shall issue»
MR. MILLER;

Subject to the regulations which have

been enacted and have been in force sines January of 1975,
if the Court please.
QUESTION:

Mr. Miller# at this point you are just

factually describing the effect of the congressional legis la­
tiori; right?
MR. MILLER:

Yes# sir.

The regulations which have been adopted permit and
confirm that -the agencies or departments of the United States
do have access to these tapes for any lawful government purpose.
QUESTION;

Are the regulations in the material

that’s been submitted to us# Mr. Miller?
MR. MILLER;
if the Court please.

I believe that they are in the Appendix#
If not# I can supply the Court with

the citations.
The regulations are Part 105-63 et sag. of Title
41 Cods of Federal Regulations.
The additional impact of this statute is very clear

7
First, of all,, it directs, and it has been accomplished,
a seizure of five and one-half years of a man's entire
materials, whether they deal with the actions as President,
whether they deal with his actions as political leader of his
party, or whether they deal with actions as a father and as a
%

husband*

These records have been seized, and they have stayed

seised ever since the statute was enacted.
Mr. Nixon has not had access to these records,
m.. 0 [sic]

except as he has sent someone 3,000 miles to his home to have
access to these particular records.
The purpose, if the Court please, of Section 104 of
the Presidential Materials Act is that these documents, or
specified portions thereof, will be made public. That is what
Congress enacted. That is what Congress intended. And that is
subject only to the adoption of regulations by the Administra­
tor of General Services, which must be approved; which must be
approved or can be disapproved, if I may correct myself, by
one house of the Congress.
Those regulations are not in effect.-. One of the
reasons being that they have been proposed, that they have
been disapproved, they have been withdrawn.
And,, if the Court please, the status of those
regulations Is in a very confused state at the moment.
But the ultimate purpose, in addition to seizing
these records, was that those certain matters in those records

8
would be extracted by the United States and be made public,,
The most intrusive part of the statute in question
is that it will **■“ has authorised the Archivist of the United
States — sortie hundred is what the plans are — to go through
all of these records , word by word, all of the tape recordings,
whether they involve conversations with his wife, with his
daughter, whether they involve conversations dealing with his
political decisions, whether they involve decisions dealing
with foreign affairs, whether they involve his decisions with
respect to domestic matters»

It is a wholesale and grand

seax*ch, in any sense of the word»
That is the immediate impact of this statute,
The Constitution of the United States vests in a
President of the United States the executive power of the
United States,
impacts directly»

It is that executive power which this Act
Because it permits access to, review of,

and ultimately publication of matters which are totally
privileged, presumptively privileged under the decision of
this Court in United States vs, Nixon,
Without the confidentiality 'that a President of the
United States has and expects, and has expected for over 200
years until this legislation, tills Court has ruled that the
President and his aides cannot

the President cannot receive

the plain, unvarnished and candid advice that he has a right to
expect to rec- ive scad must receive for the proper operation

9
of the presidency of the United States 0
QUESTION; Well, in so far as that’s a separation of
powers argument, Nr» Miller, the Act applies only to former
President Nixon? there’s no reason to think that Congress is
going to pass an Act that is generally applicable to the
Presidents in the future, is there?
MR0 MILLER;

I know of no reason to expect that to

happen, except that, as a second half of the statute in
question, a presidential or a governmental materials commission
has been formed and is about to render a report in which they
will make recommendations as to whether Congress should enact
legislation which deals with the records and materials of
future presidencies; and also with the third branch, the
Judiciary.
QUESTION;

But it would be -time enough, I taka it,

to confront anything Congress does in response to that report
when it does it.
MR» MILLER;

It would be 'time enough as to the

impact on existing presidencies, but this Act has an impact
on the operation of the presidency already, because the people
in the Whit© House, whether it be 'die White House of President
Ford or President Carter, recognize that it is possible, if.
this law is sustained on a constitutional basis, that a statute
will be enacted which will deprive them of their private
papers, and the papers of their presidencies.

10

Because if you can do it in on© instance, there’s no
reason why you can’t do it in another„
If the separation of powers principle permits
Congress to enact legislation seising every scrap of material
of five end a half years, or six months, or three months as
the case is now, of the operations of a President of the
United States, I say that that Act is totally unconstitutional,
because

But there isn’t any impairment of any

I say that the principle is a restraining

successive presidencies, because when they, those

Presidents, are conferring with their aides, they are doing so
with the understanding that possibly all of those delibera**
tions end conversations may .be made public by subsequent
legislative Acts.
So I say there is an immediate impact.
QUESTION: Well, would you still object to this Act
if, on its face, it simply says — and maybe this on© does -that anything that would threaten the executive privilege or

11

anything that would threaten to reveal the kinds of papers
that might inhibit free and open discussion between the
President and his aides will be destroyed, or that they will
never been made public?
MR. MILLERs

If I understand your question, the

legislation would simply say that the records would never be
made public?
I would say —*
QUESTION s

Not the records, but that they will be

sorted out. Surely you don't say that every piece of paper
out of this entire straws tack of papers is privileged?
MR. MILLER:

I do not, absolutely not.

A substantial

portion cf these records ----QUESTION: Well, let's assume, then, you could
divide them into two parts, end. without any idea of what the
relative volume of each part might be. But assume you can
divide them into two parts, —
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

Fine.
-- end one part is privileged. And suppose;

the Act said, once you get them divided into two parts and
you know what the privileged information is, that will not be
mad©

public.

Would that satisfy you or not?

MF. MILLER:
QUESTION;
argument?

That - mid satisfy -Satis f.'j ystir separation of powers

12
MR. MILLERs

It: would satisfy the separation of

powers to this extents

it would stop the intrusion by

Archivists and others into these papers, because, as privileged,
they could not be reviewed by third parties.
QUESTION:

Well, if -things are intermixed, some­

body is going to have to review them, and divide them.
MR. MILLER:

If somebody has to review them or

divide them, that is one of the very issues that goes to the
basis of the Fourth Amendment argument, if the Court please.
But let’s assume, arguendo,
QUESTION:

Well, why doesn’t it go to — why

doesn’t it go to your separation of powers argument, that
not only are some things privileged, but only the President
should decide which are?
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

Only the —
Or the former President.
Well, the former President can deter­

mine which are privileged.

This Court has already decided it

would determine what are privileged occasions, and has so
decided.
QUESTION: Well, is the — is anything contemplated
under this Act necessarily going to prevent the former

Rrc ;;5.d --at from giving — from examining these papers and giving
his opinion as to which ar® privileged?
MR. MILLER;

Nothing will prevent the former

13

President from doing that»

He is given a right of access,

from 3,000 miles away, if he desires to come here to review
them»

He is — the thing that would prevent him from

reviewing and determining all of them would be the substantial
burden involved.

Because it does represent five and a half

years of the presidency of the United States»
But, if I understand ‘the decisions of this Court in
the past, in terms of the concept of separation of powers, the
deliberation of each Branch, whether it be the Judiciary,
whether it be the Congress of the United States, or whether
it be the presidency of the United States, the deliberations
of each Branch are for 'the sole — within the sole domain and
the determination of the, each of those Branches.
The reason being stated very simply:

that if one

Branch of government can intervene into the deliberative
process of the other,- then truly the function — then truly
there has been

interference and a breach of the concept of

separation of powers.
Because the ultimante decision-making — how you
make decisions is solely within the discretion and the
determination of each of the Branches *
QUESTION:

Congress cannot pass —

Supposing you had a congressional

committee thinking about legislating about this subject, and
it. subpoenaed son© of these papers, do you think those,
objections on the part of the Executive Branch, even assuming

14
it was an incumbent President* would just be uniformly
sustained?
MRo MILLERs
would say this s

I would say — Justice Rehnquist* I

if the documents subpoenaed were documents

which dealt with* or tape recordings which revealed* the
decision-making process* the conferences that were had* the
positions put forth by the aides to the President* that those
documents are presumptively privileged.
And* in fact* you may recall that the Senate of the
United States* or a committee thereof* did in fact attempt to
subpoena several of the tape recordings* and the Court of
Appeals below held that no sufficient showing had been made
to breach the presumptive privilege.
QUESTION:

Have not the Presidents * all the way

back to President Washington* declined to give to Congress*
as distinguished from the courts* declined to give to Congress
certain papers under the doctrine of executive privilege?
MR, MILLER;

There has* if the Court please* bean a

long history and tradition. The first instance that I know
of where the President of

the United States refused to grant

information requested by Congress was George Washington.
Congress strongly requested that he supply information as to
what his presidential instructions were to the advisors that
were in the process of negotiating the Jay Treaty.
Washington refused to do so.

President

15

QUESTION: And you would be making -the same argument,
and. are making it, with respect to a subpoena directed to
our Conference notes?
MR» MILLER:
Absolutely.

Absolutely, if the Court please.

The deliberative process cannot be invaded by

one Branch of either of the

other too,

That has to be an

established bases of the entire concept of the separation of
pothers.
Because if you can invade the deliberative process,
you can control its result,
And the reason it’s important, particularly in terms
of the presidency, it5s very difficult to understand how the
office of the President works.

It is not

people assume, an office of records.

it is not, as most

All of the presidential

final decisions, upon which this Court will act, upon which
congressional action can be taken, are filed in various
departments.

Treaties are filed with the State Department.

Pardons are filed with the Department of Justice.
You go through the various presidential decisions,
and those become a part of the permanent files of the various
dspax tenants of government which is involved in the decision.
The record — the presidential office is not an
office of records, it is an office whereby it is determined
how decisions are to be made, and then those decisions are
forwarded, on.

16

A second broad reason for attack on this statute,
and one which I don't think there can be any justifiable
defense to, and that is that this congressional action is as
clear and as grand and as wholesale a violation of the
protected privacy of the Fourth Amendment of the United
States as can be envisioned.
To enact legislation, as Congress has done, which
directs that, five and a half years of a man's papers, personal
and private as well as presidential, be seized by a government
agent, or government agency, that those records be made
available forthwith to any agency or department of the federal
government, that, -they be made available immediately subject
to arty rights or privileges which may bs raised for a judicial
subpoena, and that while ever era hundred archivists,
accompanied by lawyers, technicians and secretaries, will
have a right to review word-by-word five and one-half years
of a man's life is, to me, an absolute clear, as clear as
violation of the Fourth Amendment as one can imagine.
QUESTIONS

You wouldn't suggest, would you, that,

this stands on the sam© footing as if Congress had decided to
take five and ah&lf years of your papers, you being a private
citizen?
MR. MILLERs The distinction with respect to Mr.
Nixon’s personal papers, does not exist.

His papers, his

personal papers are as personal to him as mine are to me.

17
And I say that; the Congress does not have a right to enact
legislation directing the head of GSA to take five years or,
indeed, six months of my personal records, and they had no
such right with respect to the personal records of the former
President.
The cases of this Court which -QUESTION: Does this Act How authorise any other
government official who wants to look at any part of this
collection of papers, give him the right to do so?
MR. MILLER:

Under Section 102(d) of the" Act, "Any

agency or department of the Federal Government'1 has the right
*

to immediate access to any part of these papers, be they fch©
tape recordings, be they presidential papers, or ~
QUESTION: Even if anyone who is halfway fairminded
would concede that this is a purely private piece of paper,
he may sea it?
MR. MILLER:

Even if —- the only caveat is that

the intrusion must be for lawful government use.
QUESTION: Well, what does that mean?
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION;

It means that the —
How can something purely private and

personal be of lawful government use?
MR. MILLER:

It cannot be, if the Court please.

It absolutely cannot be.
And yet this is what the statute directs, that these

18

QUESTION:

But doesn’t the statute say "subject

to the regulations”?
MR. MILLER:

No, sir.

Well# subject to the

regulations in Section — to be enacted by Section 10 3.
Those regulations, if the Court please# those regulations have
been adopted, and were adopted in January of 1975.
QUESTION: And they are not in the record before us?
MR. MILLER:

I assume that they were# but perhaps

they are not.
QUESTION.:

Well# those have been adopted# and those

are not the ones that were rejected by Congress?
MR. MILLER:

They were not# no. The ones rejected

by Congress —
QUESTION:

All right, but# so they're not rejected,

so they must be in the Federal Register?
MR. MILLER:

Oh# they are.

Absolutely.

QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

MR. MILLER:

Th© regulations rejected by Congress

were pursuant to Section 104(a) of th© Act# which required
that the Administrator adopt regulations to make public ~~
to make public —
QUESTION: Wall, what about the regulations permitting
access by other government officials# do they have restrictions
in them?

19

MR, MILLER:

They have sections permitting

what

/

these regulations do is they track the exact language of the
statute»

They give access to any agency or department of the

United States, to have access to these records»
QUESTION:

Does Mr. Nixon, or his representatives,

get notice any time any government official wants to look at
any part of it, or not?
MR. MILLER:

Under the regulations in the Federal

Register, promulgated pursuant to Section 103, any archival
intrusion, i»e», any time an archivist goes in, there is a
provision that the counsel to the President of the United
States — in this instance President Carter — will be
notified and given a right to review what happened, and notice
is given to the former President; notice»
QUESTION: So that if a government official — if
sene other department of the government wanted to, supposedly
for a lawful purpose, examine some of the papers, Mr. Nixon
would have notice of it?
MR. MILLER:

He would have notice under Section 103

of the regulations, yes.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

I see.
tod whether he would

be given notice

under tbw regulations ultimately to be adopted under Section
104, we would have to await for those regulations»
QUESTION:

Does the Act contain any penalties for

20
disclosure by any employee of the many employees who would
have access to this?
MR. MILLER;

None whatsoever, if the Court please.

None whatsoever.
In fact, with respect to archival intrusion, if thesis
archivists, these hundred archivists with lawyers and what--haveyou, go through these personal tape recordings and other
conversations without a warrant, making a search, they have an
obligation to turn over to time Department of Justice, if they
find anything that might warrant further investigation.
So that this is, in truth, an absolute truth, a
search followed by a seizure, which I strongly submit is
totally violative of the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION;
QUESTION:

Mr. Miller, —
Do the regulations deal with the question

of impermissible disclosures?

Suppose some clerk or any one

of the many people dealing with this screening process makes
a Xerox copy and sails it to someone, do you say there's no
penalty at all on that?
MR. MILLER;

There are general regulations adopted

which apply to members of the — employees of the General
Services Administration, if the Court please, and those
regulations generally forbid making available to the public *»there are also standard statutes in Title 18 which prohib.it
government officers from making available certain types of

21
information»
QUESTION: But no criminal penalties?
MR. MILLER:

In those, there would be.

But not

under the GSA regulations which have broad applicability here.
At this time, if the Court please, Mr. Lev;in will
present the balance of the argument.
QUESTION:

Mr. Miller, before you sit down, could I

ask one question?
Is there any issue presented with respect to the
materials that Mr. Nixon took out of government custody —
the footnote in the government's brief points out that some
materials have bean, are in his custody? and I would think
Section 101(b) (1) may read on those materials.

Is there «my

issue with respect to that?
MR. MILLER:

Yes.

In fact, there is — there has

been no issue raised yet, because the Administrator of GSA
has not undertaken the reasonable efforts required of him by
Section 102 to reach out and take those records•
QUESTION:

That's what X really wanted to ask.

There

has been no attempt to enforce 3.01(b) (1) yet?
MR. MILLER:

Not as to documents in Mr. Nixon's

possession. But, if they are, then they are going to reach
the Dictabelts and his oral diaries that he dictated at the
end of every day, most of which are also a part of the tape
recordings I mentioned. Because when he dictated his diaries

22

at the end of the day, as to what transpired, how his day went,,
his most personal thoughts, those, too, become a part of the
tape recordings that I mentioned here, as well as being on
the DietabsIts»
QUESTION: Does the record tell us why there's been
no effort to enforce that, section?
MR. MILLER:

The record -tails that there has been

no record because, in effect, there's been a stay of any
action as to this*
QUESTION:

I see.

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lewin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN, ESQ0,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. LEWIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I would like, in the time available to me, to speak
to The constitutional standards for evaluating of the statute
under the three arguments that w© have presented in our brief,
because w© think that the standards are different, and the
district court really applied a balancing test, which is
inappropriate to two of the three separate arguments that are
made in our brief.
But, just momentarily, before going to that, question,
and I think in sonte way it does relate to the application of a
balancing test to the question of separation of powers, I

23
believe Justices White and Rshnquist did raise the question of
vine the r this statute is not in some way constitutionally
sufficient^ because it either applies only retrospectively
to one President or because it might; by its application,
really be read to give President Nixon an opportunity to
challenge whenever there is some violation of presidential
confidentiality.
And we think that that overlooks the basic presumption that underlies our separation of powers argument? which
is, that the notion of separation of powers, as applied to
statements and advice given to a President in confidence,is
really a proposition that acts in futuro»
In other words, only if a presumption of confiden­
tiality exists do existing advisors speak frankly, just as
existing law clerks will speak frankly to Justices of this
Court, because they know that their advice is given in
confidence; in the same way, the mere possibility that a
statute may be enacted retrospectively to apply to PresidentFord or Carter, or the possibility that a President may be
put — with regard to every individual piece of paper or every
advice — to the burden of litigating it at some future time,
and asserting his presidential privilege, is sufficient to
impede the fret, flow of communi cation • And that.*s precisely
why we think this

Court adopted the rule of presumption of

confidentiality and stated it as' strongly as it did in United

24
States vs. Nixon.
QUESTION:

But the analogy here# Mr. Lewin# is a

former Justice of this Court comes in and objects to a law
that Congress has passed# and all the present Justices say#
"We don * t see any problem with it".
MR. LEWXN: Well# I think that the present Justices”
'law clerks# even if all the present Justices said there was
no problem# I think that the Justices would agree that the
present law clerks and their own relations with their law
clerks would be substantially affected by the existence and#
indeed, by the judicial imprimatur put upon such a statute.
It would mean# with regard to your own law clerks#
that after you left the Court# a similar statute might be
enacted.

And even though you might think# today# that it

does not concern# or it dees not relate to the way you operate,
your office# the successor to that seat might differ with
that view.
And# consequently # we have argued in our brief and
wa believe that no present occupant•of a position such as the

P cesidehcy or such as an Article III position on -this Court,
or on any federal district court# or# indeed# any Congressman
may not permanently waive those elements which are
necessarily incident to the proper functioning of that office#
even if he agrees with it today.
!
/

And that# we think# is the basic deficiency in the

25
argument: that is mad® both by the Solicitor General and by
the private appellees, when they say that this is not a
separation of pothers case. Indeed,, it is, in every sense,
because the issue of confidentiality of presidential
communications, irrespective of what the present incumbent
may think of that confidentiality, is a question which is
decided in this case for all time»

And will therefore bind

future Presidents, who may disagree with what Mr. Carter
believes or what Mr. Ford believed, if indeed Mr. Ford did
be lie v© that it made no difference.
G@ submit that to the extent that there was really
any indication of what presidential policy was, the agreement,
which is in the record, the Nixon-Sampson Depository Agreement
indicates that President Ford believed that for purposes of
on-going government business, which is really, I think, the
principal thing that the appellees are relying on in this case
which is not so much historical interest, although that is
talked about in the legislation, but in the briefs before this
Court, heavy emphasis

is placed on on-going government

business.
And President Ford was entirely satisfied with an
arrangement between himself and his predecessor under which
h-nt wculd h : given access.

And we think that's what 200 years

of history have shown? that that is satisfied by arrangements
b:;; tween

3 n coeeding

P re si den 13.

26
The Congress had before it no record of extensive
disagreement or of extensive situations which presented
problems with regard to future Presidents obtaining records
that their predecessors may have had,
And* indeed* the appellees have only plucked out*
out of an entire 200-year history* basically* I think* one*
two* or at most three instances where there was a request —
which was honored* and indeed only one situation where there
was a request* a lower level request* which was not honored,
as between successor Presidents; and that was not by the
President in office but fcv a very low-ranking individual who
had made a call to John Eisenhower and asked whether he might
have a paper.

And when Mr. Eisenhower said* Well * have that

request made by the President himself; the request was never
made.
QUESTION;

I'm a little puzzled by your

repeated

reference to the judicial area* the communications between
law clerks and Justices and judges; what about communications
as among the Justices and judges themselves?

Would you

think they are of less or greater privilege?
MR. LEWINs

I think the privilege is — in terns

of policy reasons* I think it is certainly even greater.
I have only analogized it in terms of law clerics* because*
with this Court — and I believe with every individual judge
who site ~~ the analog. I would think* to the President* who

27
is at the vary top of the Executive structure# who is The
Chief Executive# are the subordinates to that President# and
consequently# in order to provide the closest analogy# I
tried to compare it to those who work for Justices of the
Court.
But certainly to the extent that there are internal
Judicial Branch discussions which# by approving this kind of
statute# this Court would b@ saying Congress might very well
reach those kinds of papers# I think the very same problem
exists. And# indeed# that very report which Mr. Miller was
referring to# I think was suggesting that there would be
restraints placed on the ability of Justices to destroy
papers.

Which the leading Justices in the history of this

c6urt down to vary modern times ha.vs assumed they had certainly
the right to do# in terms of internal papers.
QUESTION:
substantial tax

Wall# previous Presidents have received

benefits by virtue of claimed ownership#

have they not# of their papers?
MR. LEWIN;

Yes# Mr. Chief Justice# and we think

that that* s a totally separato, problem.

W© are not hers today

arguing anything, really# that gees to what ownership rights
may b@# except to the extant that they bear on Mr. Nixon’s
expectations,on what toe proper constitutional rule is, on
how the country is operated.
QUESTION:

Does it. bear on your bill of attainder

28

arguments ?
MR. LEWINs

Yes.

And if I could, just in the very

few minutes I have, I would like to speak to that bill of
attainder argument.
Because I think that here, too, the court below
has mistaken the proper constitutional standard.
Congress could have enacted a law, if it 'thought,
on the basis of its various investigations and the discussions
/

on

Floor of the Senate, that Mr. Nixon was an unreliable

custodian of documents, it could have enacted a law that
said any unreliable custodian of documents, b® he President,
Vice President, or any other federal officer, may have those
documents taken away from him if it is shewn, in & judicial
forum, that h® is an unreliable custodian.
And there could be temporary restraining orders, and
preliminary injunctions, every remedy that this statute
provides.
What doss this statute do, more than that statute
dovs?

I makes Congress the 'act-finder.

And that's exactly

what this Court has said in a series of cases, culminating
with United States vs. Brown, that Congress may not be the
fact-finder.
And why may not Congress be -the fact-finder?

Because

in that case th© party against whom it finds the facts has
«

no judicial trial, no counsel to

represent him, no opportunity

29

to cross-examine witnesses or present witnesses in his defense,
The entire range of what judicial trial is all about is
obviated„
In this ease, Congress held not a single hearing on
this statuteo

It did hold hearings on a predecessor statute,

looking to the question of federal officials8 records
generally, but not on this statute.
There was no opportunity, other than statements made
on the Floor of -the Senate, just assertions, which were picked
up by the district court in this case, to the notion that
Mr, Nixon is an unreliable custodian for historical purposes.
And we submit that the bill ©f attainder clause
says is that you may not, Congress may not make that ultimate
factual finding.

And here it has done it, it has mentioned

Richard Nixon by name — Congress didn't even dare do anything
like that in the Brown case.

And this Court mentioned that

certainly if "Archie Brown'* a ad been mentioned by name as
someone who could not occupy a union office, that would be a
bill of attainder. And here Congress has said "Richard Nixon"
is the person who cannot decide which papers are con fidential
and which papers are not.
That aspect of the presidency and what carries on
with it after the 'President leaves office is taken away from
him.
Nov?, Mr, Chief Justice, I suppose your suggestion was

30

that there was in effect a bill of attainder, because he has
also been deprived of ownership of these papers.

I think thfec

may very well be true*
In. addition to that* he has been deprived of custody,
of access* of any meaningful opportunity to have those
documents in the. way that former Presidents have, and the
Archie Brown case also says that even preventive purposes*
even entirely preventive purposes are punishment within the
meaning of the bill of attainder.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WADE H. McCREE, ESQ.*
OH BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL APPELLEES
MR. McCREE:

Mr. Chief Justice* and may it please

the Courts
This appeal requires the Court to determine whether
th-a Presidential Recordings anc! Materials Preservation Act?
that provides for the impoundment and classification by
officials of the Executive Branch of certain materials
generated during the Administration of a former President,
and left by him temporarily in the White House following his
resignation* facially offendis the Constitution.

We emphasize Kfacially" because the Act became
effective on December 19 * 1974* and tills action for declaratory

31
judgment and other relief was filed December 20th, before
any action was taken under the statutes
QUESTION:

Mr, Solicitor General, I taka it, the

question as you put it, you could mean the entire Act — is
*

that the question?

Or is it legitimate to ask whether any

section of it is facially unconstitutional?
MR. McCREE:

I believe my answer to that, Mr.

Justice Willte, is the plaintiff contends — the appellant
contends that the Act is invalid in many respects 0

But our

response is that there is a severability clause, and in the
event this Court should find a provision of it invalid, it
would not invalidate the entire legislation»
Appellant contends that the Act violates the principle
of the separation of powers, the prohibition against bills of
attainder, and his right to privacy and liberty of political
expression and association.

The government submits that the

Congress acted constitutionally, and that the judgment of
the district court should be affirmed.
As my brother has pointed out, the Act requires the
Administrator of General Services to take possession and
complete control of the materials, to prevent their destruction,
except as required by law- to makes there, available for uses in
any judicial proceeding or otherwise subject to legal process,
subject to any rights, defense or privileges that anyone,
including the former President, might raise.

32

The Act also requires the Administrator of General
Services to afford former President Richard Nixon access at
all times, consistent with the Act, and to afford access to
the Executive Branch — and I stress Executive Branch

for

lawful governmental use„
And then, of course, it requires the issuance of
regulations, to prevent loss and destruction, and ultimately
to submit to the Congress regulations relating to public
access — and I stress the distinction between the two sets
of regulationsy taking into account seven enumerated factors
denominated as needs, which I suggest we need not discuss in
detail, because these regulations had not been promulgated at
the time the attack on the statute was. made, have not yet
taken place because they require congressional acquiescence to
become effective; and that acquiescence, in the two efforts
that were attempted, was not forthcoming.
Finally, the Act provides for the appropriation of
money if a court should determine that a provision of the?
legislation should deprive an individual of private property
without just compensation.
And so, at this point, I reiterate, since there are
no

regulations providing for public access, and only

regulations, for safekeeping, which are not before the Court,
as my brother indicated, and are not part of the record here,
because, indeed, the appellant dens not claim that they abridge

33

any rights of his, we suggest respectfully that this Court
should linit its inquiry to the face of the statute, and should
not foe concerned with the many hypothetical horrors, as the
district court characterized then, that appellant suggests
night occur at sons future -tineo
We suggest the proper time to consider these hob­
goblins nay foe when the public access regulations will have
been promulgated and will have become effective, and there
will have been decisions with respect to particular materials0
QUESTION;

Mr, Solicitor General, do you — I'm not

sura this bears directly — would you think Congress could
enact a statute impounding the papers of federal judges
generally, or judges of one particular category or level,
circuit judges, Supreme Court Justices, or a particular
Supreme Court or other judge or Justice?
MR, McCREEs

I believe if the Congress apprehended

some great harm to the republic, it could prevent the destruc­
tion of records in the custody of any public officer.
Now, there would be restrictions on its power to do
it, but I would think the Congress would have that power9 to
prevent the destruction of public records by any public
custodian thereof,
QUESTION;

What kind of proceeding would be necessary

to rack.© that determination?

Presumably, your response indicates

there would first be a finding or a determination.

By what

34
process would the Congress make that?

I don't assume you

mean it would be just die ipse dixit of the legislative
process»
MR. McCREEs

Well, I think the Congress, if the

Court please, has the power and even the duty to protect
government property, and that’s a specific Charge that the
Congress must accept.

And I think the Congress, if it

apprehends the destruction of public property, has the
res pons ibility to provide for it.

But it must provide for

means adequate to protect the integrity of the branch of
government that’s concerned, to protect personal rights,
executive privilege, judicial rights, judical privileges; but,
in response to the Chief Justice's inquiry, yes, I think the
Congress has the power to protect the papers from destruction.
Now, what it can do with it after that is quite a
different matter.
QUESTION: General McCrae, do you think this case
would stand on any different footing if the congressional
statute had been directed at presidential papers teat were
located in Key Biscayne rather than in the White House, where,
presumably., the government did not own the building they w..nn
located in, but the papers might be of the same general
caliber?
MR. McCREEs

1 don’t believe that, would make any

difference, ?Ir. Justice Rehnquist. ' I believe if these are

35

public papers# if they belong to the government, or if the
government has a substantial interest in them, and there is
apprehension about their destruction, before this can be
ascertained# I think the Congress has that power»
QUESTION:

Is it necessary»for you to sustain your

proposition# for us to find that the government in fact owns
the papers in question?
MR. McCREE:

I submit it is not»

I think if the

government has a sufficient interest in them# the government

may have an interest that would require it to copy the papers»
I suggest, to the Court that 'the papers might indicate
material useful in the SALT talks that have just bean recently
pursued. They might have information that would be necessary
in matters of national security# that the Executive Branch
should have access to.

And if these papers were in danger of

destruction# I would think the Congress would have the power
to provide for their protection until their contents could be
v.vcde available to the appropriate persons.
vlBTTGN j

You vmu-Mn’t carry that over to papers

in the bonds of a privato individual# I take it?
MR. McCREE s
Ant. I’m

I don’t believe I have to# at thin time.

i {•;•-.is© that, tic. Congress has that power*

But I just

don’t think I have to reach that question at this time.
And I don’t think this Act does.
QUESTION: Wall# Mr. Solicitor General, you do have

36

to reach the question# though, of private papers.

You mentioned

only public papers# and Congress's power over public papers.
Now, apparently no one suggests that all the papers
that are seised, that have bsen seised here are public papers.
MR. McCREE:

1 concede, Mr. Justice White# —

QUESTION:

And let's just assume that# as this Court

read this statute# the statute would empower the empcwerer#
the regulator# to withhold papers that anyone in his right
mind would say are private papers.
Now# would you suggest that# then# that statute is
unconstitutional on its face to that extent?
MR. McCREE:

On its face# if it instructed or

authorised the impoundment of purely private papers# —

MR. McCREEs

QUESTION; V7eil, I may as well make my point —
MR„ McCREE;

And the procedure has been established

to classify them.
QUESTION:
specific.

Yes.

Now, 1511 make ray question very

I would like to know where, in ‘She criteria that

feh© regulator must use in preparing his regulations, where in
those criteria is any assurance given that purely private
papers will be returned to Mr. Nixon?
And, even more precisely, suppose that someone like

a regulator claims that, this piece of paper, even though
purely prive, is of general historical interest?

Do you

think those two categories are mutually exclusive?
MR. McCREE;

I think it may be difficult to separate

them, but, if the Court please, Section 104 provides, as th©
seventh of the enumerated needs, on page 4a of Appellant's
brief one finds that, —

QUESTION;
MR. McCREE;

Yes.
— that the regulations shall take

into account, among other fellings, the "need to give to
.Richard M. Nixon, or his heirs, for his sole custody and us©,
tape recordings and other materials which are not. likely to
be- related to the need described in" the foregoing paragraphs Q

And so -iiiirrv: is no. inoenfcic/i - —

QUESTION:

Now,

rait a minute, just finish the —

38

just finish the provision.
MR. McCREE:

"and are not otherwise of general

historical significance.R
QUESTION: Well now, suppose Mr. Nixon has prepared a
diary ©very day and put down what, exactly what he did, and
let’s suppose that someone thought that was a purely personal
account.

Now, I can just imagine that someone might think

that it nevertheless is of general historical significance.
MR. McCREE;

May I refer the Court to need No. 5?

"The need -to protect any party's opportunity to assert any
legally or constitutionally based right or privilege which
/

would prevent or otherwise limit access to such recordings and
materials" .
And I submit that this Act affords Richard M. Nixon
the opportunity to assert the contention that this diary of
his is personal and has act the kind of general historical
significance that will permit his deprivation? and that would
then have to be-adjudicated in a court.
QUESTION: Well, do —
MR. McCREE:

And ultimately this Court will answer

that question.
QUESTION:

Well, how do you -- so you would agree,

then, that 104 must be construed — must be construed to soonai
or later return te Mr. Nixon what we might call purely private
papers?

39

MR. McCREH;

Indeed I do.

QUESTION; Can you imagine any diary —- thinking of
Mr. Truman's diary, which, it is reported, was a result of
being dictated every evening, after the day's work — can you
conceive of any such material that would not be of general
historical interest?
MR. McCREEs

I must concede, being acquainted with

some historians, that it's difficult to conceive of any tiling
that might not b© of historical interest»

But —

[Laughter.]
QUESTION:

Yes.

Archivists and historians, like

j s>umalisfcs, *—
MR. McCREEs
QUESTION:

Indeed they are.
— think that everything is.

[Laughter. 3
MR. McCREEs

But Shis legislation recognizes that

a claim of privacy, a claim of privilege must be protected,
and if the regulations are insufficient to do that, again a
court will have an opportunity to address itself to a particu­
lar item such as the diary before it can be turned over.
And for that reason, w@ suggest that the attack at
Ls premature because the statute, in recognizing the
right*, of privacy, is facially adaquate. And the attack that
was macd? the day after it: became effective brought to this
unity to speculate about what might

40

happen, but. tiis regulations haven't even bean promulgated
and acquiesced in so that they have become effective.
Now, this Court is asked to speculate about any
number of horrors, as the distinguished court below says.
QUESTION;
place

But the specific procedure has taken

for want of a better word, yes.
MR. KcCREEs

Yes, Mr» Justice Rehnquist, it has,

and it has been done for the purpose of safekeeping and
preventing destruction,, But. the sorting and sifting has not
even been begun.
QUESTION; And I take it, from your answer to the
Chief Justice’s question, that Congress could,immediately
upon the retirement of Chief Justice Warren from this Court,
have passed a statute similar, sequestering all the papers tha^
he had in this building?
MR. McCREE:

I believe it might, for safekeeping.

But it would have to set up reasons for doing it, indicating
why, and provisions for returning to him everything that it
could not appropriately take from him.
» '
purports to do that. And we submit -~
QUESTION;

And this statute

But why would it. have to set up reasons

for so doing?
MR. McCREE;

I'm not certain

41
because of a perceived need to act.
Now, it doesn’t have to recite in the statuta, if
this is what Hr, Justice Blackmmi is inquiring, why it so
acted.
QUESTION:

Mr, Solicitor General, are you saying

— you emphasised the danger of destruction as an important
justification, as I understand, for this kind of legislation:
are we to assume that Congress has made a finding of fact
that there was a danger of destruction and that Mr, Nixon was
an unreliable custodian?
And, if so, does that have any bearing on the bill
of attainder argument?
MR, McCREE:

If the Court please, I would like to

refer the Court to the House Report, House Committee Report,
it’s House of Representatives Report, on page 3, where we
find two significant items,
QUESTION:

Is that in your brief, Mr. Solicitor

General, or not?
MR, McCREE:

I’m not certain that this specific

reference is, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, then, excuse me? go ahead with

your citation,
MR. McCREE:

If 7. just might ba permitted to read &

In speaking of the agreement which former President

Nixon enacted with Mr. Sampson, the Administrator of General

Servicest which agreement: was abrogated by this statutes
"Thus the agreement gives Mre Mixon total control over all
the materials and records of his Administration,,

It allows

him to have access to the materials , but excludes others from
reviewing these records»

Than? by allowing Mr» Nixon to

destroy all the materials, the agreement ignores the public
interest in preserving them»58
And so we have some evidence of congressional
apprehension.
QUESTIONS

Mr» Solicitor General, could that

was that talking about destruction at a future date?
MR» McCREE:
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

I'm unable to —
Did it allow Mr* Nixon to —
I'm unable to differentiate»

I must

concede that it follows a paragraph that provides for the
destruction of the tapes at a stated date, September 1, '79,
or his death at a sooner date.
QUESTION: Certainly that, agreement didn't contemplate
the immediate- destruction of any of these materials?
MR. McCREE:

Except, if the Court please, it

permitted him sola access -QUESTION:

In fact, it would seem to me that

perhaps — the sole -access-.
MR. McCREE:

- and opportunity»

43

QUESTION:

But you're saying this statute may

be justified because of the danger of destruction. And it
seems to m© that agreement prevented the very danger that
you're describing* for a limited period of time.

And therefor a

would have permitted a careful deliberation of an appropriate
statute applying to all Presidents.
MR. McCREEs

If the Court please* the Committee

Report contains this characterization of the agreement, and
I quote again from page 3;

-'This agreement would permit Mr.

Nixon to remove and destroy any of these documents if he
wishes to do so."

And that certainly appears to evidence

concern* apprehension that it might indeed happen.
QUESTION:

Well* isn't that a statement of fact

that would apply to every employee of the United States
Government* from the President down to the lowliest door­
keeper?-

That it affords the opportunity.

Is that a

finding of apprehension?
MR. McCREE:

Well* coupled with historical facte*

including the unexplained erasure of 18 and a half minutes
c ' a taut recording* it would appear to be more than just a
platitude.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

Did Congress recite that factor?
I'm not aware that that recital appears

in fry Committee Report* but reference is made to it in.both
briefs* and there is a record reference to it* that I'm -unable

44
to furnish right now»
QUESTION'S

Mr. Solicitor General, I don't know

whether we can take judicial notice of the biographical
writings of former Presidents or other public officials, but,
if we can, it’s quite clear from what Mr» Lyndon Johnson
wrote and what Mr. Harry Truman wrote, that when they left the
White House they had, with their own resources plus the
resources furnished by Acts of Congress, a completely private
screening under tbs exclusive control of the former President,
of all the papers, to separate the personal from the truly
public or even some of the historical matter.
And the biographical material of former Justices of
this Court indicates that's generally the process they followed.
Do you see a difference between having that screening
process under -the sole-; control of -the individual and the
process provided by Congress?

And, if so, whether there are

any constitutional implications in the difference?
MR. McCREE:

Well, there are similarities and

differences, if the Court please.

The same people, essentially,

are doing the screening as accomplish it under the
Presidential Libraries legislation.

The archival section

of the General Services Administration.And, indeed, this
Act provides that those archivisisi, who are professional
persons, as the; Court of.course knows, with ethical standards
to which, to adb-uza and so forth, will also screen the material

And, I submit; also,, it3s with.in. the saim Branch of

Government, it is not outside of the Executive Branch of
Government,
So, in. that res pact, it's the santa»
‘The difference is under the Presidential Libraries

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, before you move

on, do you have any idea approximately as to how many
archivists, secretaries, lawyers, and other staff personnel
have or will have access to these documents?
I think Mr. Miller mentioned a hundred archivists.
Would it be one hundred?
MR. McCREE:

Thera is a statement in the record,

and I regret, Mr. Justice Powell, that I cannot refer to it
specifically.

I don't think the number is that high, but it

could be, when one considers that there are 42 million

46

documents and 80Q hours of tape»

But a hundred sounds quite

high; and I would just have to find that for the Court and
furnish it to

the Court.

QUESTION;

That number was identified in connection

with the archivists.

A good many other personnel would see

the papers.
I now ask you a question that may sound frivolous ,
but do you think if a hundred people know anything of great
interest in the City of Washington, it will remain a secret?
[Laughter.]
MR. McCREE:

Mr. Justice Powell, I have heard that

if two people have heard it, it will not.
[Laughter. ]
QUESTION::

You're probably righti

QUESTION:
that, did it not?

The Pentagon Papers case illustrated
Not two, but very few.

MR. McCREE:

Well, if the Court please, we submit

that there is no violation of the principle of separation of
powers.

Viewed on its face, as wo suggest the statute must

'a' viewed, instead of being an encroachment on powers reserved
to the Executive Branch, the Act entrusts the material to the
custody of the Administrator of General Services, an
executive official appointed by the President and responsible
to him? and so the suggestion that there would be any
compromise of the integrity of the Executive Branch appears

4?
not to have force, because the parson who will supervise the
archivists who will do the classifications is responsible to
the President.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General* may I return for

a moment to the question — I didn’t really follow through
enough on it — about -the question of danger of destruction.
I suppose there’s always a possibility of destruction.

If

that’s enough* why* then* that would justify legislation of
this kind with respect to any retiring official.
But are we to take it that the view of the government
is that the House Committee in the legislation is predicated
on a finding that there was soma abnormal danger of destruction
that does not always exist with respect to any retiring
official?
MR. McCREE:

If the Court please* may I refer -die

Court to the government’s brief* the bottom of page 50 and
•the top of page 51* where there is a reference to specific
Kovs© determinations of a specific fear of distrust.
QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General* I want to be sure

you get. the full import of my question.

I assume you could

find S'.rpy.orfc for the view that -there is such a finding* but
what I wanted to know is what the government’s position is*
because if you say the Legislature made such a finding* that
ir-iy undermine your position on the bill of attainder point.
It seems to me you must take a position one way or

48

the other. And the postion must: be —- is relevant to two
different arguments that your opponents make.
MR. McCREE:

If -the Court please, —

QUESTION; And I’m just curious to know what your
position is.
MR. McCREE:

— the government does not suggest

that there must be such a finding.
QUESTION;

No.

My question is;

does the government

suggest there was such a finding?
MR. McCREE;

The government acknowledges that there

was such a finding.
QUESTION:
MR. McCREE:

I see.
But suggests that since no punishment

was imposed, or is imposed by -the Act, that the prohibition
against a bill of attainder is not violated.

That is our

response to the attainder argument..
QUESTION:

Do you think that — can there be a

violation of a protected interest by the impact of such a
finding on a person’s reputation?
MR, McCREE:

Indeed there can be.

Indeed there can

b©, but that ~~
QUESTION:

And would you take the view that this

finding that you describe has had no impact on this man’s
reputation?
MR. McCREE:

I certainly do not.

But —

49
QUESTION;
MR. McCREE s

Then., why is it apt a bill of attainder?
Well, our unders tanding is that the

prohibition against a bill of attainder is a prohibition
against something more traditionally associated with punish­
ment than injury to a person's reputation.
In facts? w® would submit that going through a
congressional investigation is not likely to assist a person
in maintaining a good reputation, but no one suggests, I think?
that that violates the attainder prohibition.
If the Court please, in the few minutes remaining,
we would like to touch on one or two other matters.
We submit that facially .the Act does not invade
the President's right of privacy or any executive prive lege.
The

Act specifically provides that these are concerns with

which the General Services Administrator is to be aware in
r

the promulgation of his regulations, 'and his determination of
allowing access, public or private, to these papers.
And the right of former President Nixon to assert
these privileges is given to him by the statute, and we submit
p. court, perhaps this -Court, will have to determine- Whether
an-assertive right exists, and whether it must yield to an
©v rridiog interest, as it did in United Statas vs_a Hlxor;.
And so, facially, the Act protects these interests
that my brother — about which' ray brother expressed so much
concern

50
Finally, w© suggest that the comingling of these
papers was the act of the former President, and for him to
suggest that- the Fourth Amendment prevents the sifting of these
papers to determine what are clearly his private papers, and
what are papers pertaining to matters in the public interest,
to which the Executive Branch should have access, is something
of his doing, and that he should not fo© heard to complain
about it*.
The Fourth Amendment bars unreasonable searches,
and the government submits that the imperatives of national
security and other aspects of the public interest makes such
an inspection eminently reasonable.
Professor Paul Freund wrote:

History is a way of

itH - rising those spectres of disaster forecast from judicial
decisions.
The government believes that so long as the courts
retain their resourcefulness in applying precedents, their

authority to reconsider doctrines in the light of the lessons
of experience and the force of better reasoning, that the
fears of irreparable harm, which we have heard here today,

am likely to prove exaggerated.
We submit that on its face this statute is
c. nntitutional, end we respectfully submit that the judgment
should be affirmed.
Thank you

QUESTION:

General McCree, the national government

is of course one of delegated powers, 1 suppose»

Which

delegated power was Congress exercising, do you think, as far
as under Article I, when it passed this legislation?
MR» McCREEs
exact language

There is a power- — I can’t giv© you the

to preserve and protect public property s

and I certainly think that one, and I think the necessary
and proper powers»
QUESTION:

Would the power to preserve government

property depend on a finding by this Court that it was
government property?
MR. McCREE:

Perhaps for some purpose, as this

Court has pointed out, the concept of property has many
aspects.

Perhaps the government might have, an interest, not

a proprietary interest, but the kind of interest that would
be entitled to protection of the Congress.
QUESTION: General McCree, you mentioned national
defense as on© of the justifications for the Act.

Would you

elaborate on that a bit?
MR. McCREE:

If the Court please, some of these

papers may contain information furnished to the negotiators
for our nation in the SALT talks, information perhaps
concerning the number of nuclear submarines that we possess
capable of launching missiles, subsurface missiles.

These

arc matters that tie ©: -going AIrnlnistrati.on, whatever it is,

52
must have access to if it is adequately to protect our
security.
QUESTION s

Is there oas word in the record anywhere

that suggests any danger that a former President of the United
States would destroy records related to national defense?
MR. McCREE:

There are 42 million —- no, if the

Court please,, the answer is no, there is no word to that.
QUESTION;

You are not representing to this Court

that there was any danger known to your office or, so far as
the record is concerned, known to the Congress that documents
pertaining to national defense would have been destroyed?
MR. McCREH;

I am not suggesting that.

I can advise

the Court that I am aware that there has been retrieval of
certain documents of the type I have — of the type generally
relating to national security from these papers, since they
have been in the custody of the Administrator of the General
Services Administration, and with 42 million comingled documents,
soma method of retrieval must be established if a critical
dooument is to ba found within ■?. time within which it can be
useful to our nation.
And this also is provided for by the Act.

Access

and contrary to what my brother says — to members of any
department or agency of the Executive Branch' — he neglected
to emphasise that —• and there has been that access.
QUESTION:

Kay I ask you a question?

Excuse me for

53

interrupting you»
How many agencies and departments are there in the
Executive Branch, Mr. Solicitor General?
MR« McCREE:

I do not have that figure at my finger-

tips, if the Court please»
QUESTION:

There*s a great big —

MR. McCREE:

More than I think, I suspect.

[Laughter. ]
QUESTION:

I suspect you' re right.

And there are a couple of million people in the
Executive Branch.

I think.

Butr put that aside for the moment, I have another
question I’d like to ask.

If you were a foreign diplomat,

and this Act is sustained, would you feel as free to divulge
State secrets to the President of the United States as you
would have felt prior to the enactment of this statute?
MR. McCREEs
bacauo

I can honestly say that I would,

this statute mandates protecting any information

relating to the nation’s security, and any legal or
constituti ri&lly based rights or. privileges.

And I would

expect —
QUESTION:

What are the penalties?
*—• executive privilege to be protected

from any unauthorised invasion,
-QUESTIONs

But those several hundred people reading

54
or listening to what the Ambassador from this country or that
country said to the President of the United States, do you
really think that that information will be kept confidential?
MR. McCREE:
to that can be this;

If the Court pleas©, my only response
that previous Presidents have taken

their papers, subject to no restrictions whatsoever, which
means that an Ambassador would have to believe that anything
that he spoke to another President might be discovered by
persons not even under the restrictions that these
responsible government archivists submit to,
QUESTION: But this is after this former President
that you hypothesise has gone -through the process of selecting
and segregating, which each of the former Presidents, according
to his own account, has don©.
MR® McCREE:

if the Court please, the life of

John F. Kennedy terminated in office, and h@ did
not have that privilege, his estate, his executors were the
ones to make that decision, not having the sensitivity,
perhaps, about soma of these matters that the archivists
might.
So it d-.vir-n*t necessarily follow, if the Court

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Herzstein.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. HERZSTEIN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC APPELLEES
MR. HERZSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it

please the Court:
As you know, we’re appearing on behalf of distinguished
national organizations of historians, political scientists,
reporters, and various prominent members thereof? also a
separate group of interveners , the Committee for Public
Justice, and prominent members 'thereof, and a .separate group,
reporter Jack Anderson.
The national organizations include the American
Historical Association and the American Political Science
Association.
Now, I would, like to: make one thing very clear, and
that is that there lias been no question in this case raised
by any of the interveners or the government concerning Mr.
Nixon’s entitlement to the return of his personal materials.
This includes diaries, it includes conversations with his
fentdly, any privileged cenv&rsation, any personal property
of any kind not involving the actual transaction of government
business.
No issue of this sort was raised in the previous
case before this statute was adopted.

The groups I represented

brought suit against the Administrator to enjoin enforcement

56
of -the Nixon-Samps021 agreement.

In the very initial complaint

that was filed in that case* it was made clear that all
parties acknowledged the personal records should go back to
Mr. Nixon.
QUESTION; But,* as a result of this legislation,
there*s been almost a three-year delay so far in his getting
possession of what are concededly entirely personal property,
and
MR. HERZSTEIN;
QUESTION;

That’s right, Your Honor.

— and personally confidential documents

and property, and the delay is not ever yet.
And that’s the reason —
QUESTION;

And anything that’s of historical

interest never will be given over.
MR. HERZSTEIN; All right.
question of delay?
QUESTION;

May I address first the

I think that’s —
Either way.

MR. HERZSTEIN;

—* that’s been very regrettable for

us also, Your Honor, There’s also been a delay in, of course,
getting access to the governmental materials that might other­
wise have been made available for public access under normal
ci rcums tances *
For instance, if these wear© treated as other govern­
ment materials.
The delay, I think, has been caused by the fact that

57

the statute — the other litigation was well along and
actually resulted in a decision by Judge Richey,

but that

was stayed in favor of the litigation concerning this statute0
So it's simply on® of the costs of litigation, which we regret,,
tOOo
But there °s just no question about the return of
personal diaries, Dictabelts, so long as they are not the
materials involved in the transaction of government business0
Now, the statuta, I

agree, could have been drafted

a little more clearly, but w© think there are several points
which make it quite clear that his personal materials are to
be returned to him»
One is the fact that statute refers to the presi­
dential historical materials of Richard Nixon, not to the
person or private materials»,
The second is that, as Judge McCree mentioned,
criterion 7 calls for a return of materials to him, and if
you read those two in conjunction with the legislative
history, there ara statements on the Ploor of the Senate,
on the Floor of the House, and in the Committes Reports,
indicating the expectation that Nixon’s personal records would
be returned to him.
QUESTION: Could you give us a capsule summary of the
difference between what you. have just referred . to as Nixon's
personal records, which will be returned, and the matter which

58
will not: bs returned?
MRo HERZSTEIN; Well, yes. Certainly any personal
letters, among his family or friends , certainly a diary mad®
at the end of the day, as it were,, after the event
QUESTION: Even though the DietabaIt was paid for
out of Whit© House appropriations?
MRo HERZSTEIN:
us.

That’s right.

That doesn’t bother

I think it’s incidental now. But we do have a different

view on the tapes, which actually recorded the transaction of
government business by government employees on government time
and so on.

The normal tapes that we’ve all heard so much

about.
The Dict&balfcs, Mr. Nixon has said, are his personal
diary.

Instead of writing it down, in other words, he dictated

it at the end of the day. And we think that’s —
QUESTIONs

I went to be sura about that concession,

because this certainly is of historical interest.
MR. HERZSTEIN:

That’s right, it is, but we do not

f el it’s covered by the statute.

We have acknowledged that

from the start.
QUESTION;

Is this concession shared by the

Solicitor General, do you think?
MR.- HERZSTEINi We believe it is.
QUESTION; Whafc about that?
MR. McCREE: About the fact that the paper belongs

59
to the government: and so forth, we don’t believe that makes
a document a government documents0

We certainly agree with

that»
Beyond that, if the Court please, ~QUESTION; What about the Dictebelts representing his
daily diary?
MR. McCREE;

I would think that* s a personal mat-tar

that would be — should b@ returned to him once it was
identified.
QUESTION;

Well, is there any problem about,right

this very minute, of picking those up and giving them back
to Mr. Nixon?
MR. McCREE:

I know of no problem. Whether it would

have to await the adoption of the regulation, which has been
stymied by Mr. Nixon*s lawsuit, which has been delayed for
three years,
QUESTION:

How has that stymied the issuance of

regulations'* Mr, Solicitor General?
MR. McCREE:

One of the dispositions of the district

court was to stay the effectiveness of regulations•

Now, I

think it held up principally the regulations for public
access.

The other regulations are not part of this record,

and I cannot speak to the Court with any knowledge about them.
QUESTIONs

Well, that would not have prevented,

would it, Mr. Solicitor Qfwxnfl, the development, of regulations»,

60

the proposal of publication of all 'the regulations that were
contemplated, would it?
Unless they have already done that and contemplate
no other regulations.
MR. McCREEs

Of course, as the Court knows, two

sots of regulations were sent to the Congress and were
disapproved. These were regulations for public access and not
the 103 regulations „
And 'ihe 10 3 regulations are to assure the protection
of the tape recordings and other materials., and to prevent
access by unauthorised persons and so forth.

So 1 just

can’t answer that, except to way that certainly the private
diaries should be returned, no one would dispute that.
MR. HERZSTEIN;

May I say also on that point that

we* do not understand the regulations to be here under attack,
including fchss* Section 103 regulations.

Mr. Nixon has not

made any audible complaint, so far as we've known, about the
fact that those regulations should have been redrafted.
He had an opportunity, X thinx, to litigate those — has had
an, -pportunifcy, and still does •— to litigate those Section
103 rsgulations.
QUESTION; Wall, ifere aren't any 104 regulations,
though f are there?
MR. IIERS5STEXN:

No.

But the 103 regulations are

the ones which pertain to Mr. Nixon's continuing access, which

61
ha's allowed to do right now, and ■-*"
QUESTIONi Well, do you know what th© present status
is of regulations — th© preparation of regulations for 104?
MRo IIERZSTEINs Well, it's a very long story.

Two

—• I believe they've been submitted to Congress on two
occasions, and certain portions were objected to the first
time* They came back, A certain smaller portion was objected
to,
QUESTION!

Well, would you suggest that the Act

becomes more suspect th© longer it goes on, ~
HR, IIERZSTEINs
QUESTION:

Well, there has been —

~~ without any provision whatsoever for

implementing sorting out and return?
MR, HERZSTE1N: Frankly, Your Honor, I think th®
implementation of the regulations has been held up, or at
least has gone slower, because 'this litigation was pending,
and they <~~

Wall, I know that's what you keep saying,

MR,

JRZSTEIR;

Ch , I think that's —

62

QUESTION: Well, how could the litigation have held
them up?
MR. HERZSTEIN: All I meant to say was I'm
speculating that the General Services Administrator has been
abiding the decision in this cas®.
QUESTION: Well, 1*11 ask yoti again:
goes on for tan years , doss th©

Suppose that

Act become more suspect or

not?
MR. HERZSTEIN:

oh, of course it does, yes, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, there's nothing in Section 103

to authorise th© return of t ie private diaries to Mr. Mixon,
is there?
MR. HERZSTEIN:
sorting.

Ho, except there is a problem of

Mr. Mixon has objected to the Administrator going

through and sorting ©von anything, and th© courts, at his
request, have enjoined any archival sorting of these materials
at all,
QUESTION;

Because, I suppose, the steam of the

statute is that before any private material is returned, some
third party must read the material to be sure it’s private.
MR. HERZSTEIN:‘
Arid sine? Nr. Nixon h

That's right.

That's the problem.

said •— hti hasn't gone in and said,
i

“look, please sort out my Die tabsIts and my personal diaries
and so

ok

«tad return thru, to me”? he's gone in and said, "No,

63
no on© may see, those things" f and he's asked the court to
enjoin that* And we have not objected.

No on© has objected.

In other words, there’s been a frees© on the thing
at Mr. Nixon’s requestr pending -this litigation.
Now, as I say, there's not really a dispute about
the fact that Mr* Nixon should have back his personal papers.
The fact is — the dispute is caused by the fact -that the
personal records ar© a tiny fragment of this vast archive,
which includes many papers of great public importance,
importance both to the continuing needs of the government,
which is documented in the record quite amply, and in the
decision of the court below? .and the needs - of the —
QUESTION:

May I ask ones other question about the

vast quantity of material?
MR. HERZSTEIN:
QNi; 3TI0N:

Yes, sir*

Sorae of that material was Watergate

related, I suppose, .and that was the material which was most
likely to be destroyed, I suppose, if we were to read the
congressional material*

Is 'there any evidence of a danger of

destruction of anything other than Watergate related material?
MR, EIJRZSTEINs

Not that I know of. Your Honor,

I would have to check through the legislative history on that
and see.
I think there corl -inly is evidence of a lack of
confidence that, the de facto practice that's existed in the

64
case of past: Presidents perhaps might not work so well this
time.

I think that appears amply —
QUESTION:

is there any such evidence respecting

anything except material related to Watergate?
MR. HERZSTEINs

Not that I know of, Your Honor.

There certainly ware -- there has been a need for access to,
I think, some 25 boxes of the material since Mr. Nixon left
office, for national security purposes.
That came out in a deposition of the Secretary of
the National Security Council.

In other words, the Ford

Administration has had to go in there and use soma of these
things.
Now, whether they would h&v© been able to do it as
wall or as readily if they ware in Mr.

Nixon's possession is,

of course, hard to say. Thera is also evidence in the record,
however, of difficulties in past Administrations getting
access to national security material of prior Administrations.
A <

I think this, quite apart from Watergate, there was a

justification for Congress to say, "Loofc, the presidency is
important nowadays, it generates vast amounts of material
ii.s.t the President never sees, which are needed for th©
government? it's'time that we continue this evolution that
has been going on sines* th© days of Hoover, presidential
libraries and so on, it’s tiro© we continue this and set up an
orderly regime which takes these materials and puts them into

35

government custody.55
We think that there’s no problem about, the power of
Congress to do that. The only problem in this case is caused
by the intermingling that occurred with some of Mr. Nixon’s
records during his Administrahion.

And the problems Mr. Nixon

is raising# concerning executive privilege and concerning
privacy# really have to do —- they really come down to the
question of how do we segregate these tilings# protecting the
interests of both sides.
Basically# his position is# "Because a small fragment
of my materials ax® in there# I should be able to taka the
whol'fe thingp and it. should be my sol® judgment what is
personal and what is public.”
QUESTION:

How do you know it*s a small fragment

tli at * s pa rs on al ?
MR. HEEZSTEIN: Well# Your Honor# Mr. Nixon testified
tk;-;.t of the 42 million he could not have — in his deposition
in this case — he could not have seen possibly more than
200.000 during his Administration.
And of course most of those 200#000 that h© saw would
have bean in tb.es course of government business.

So that that

fragment of that would be personal.

MR. HER23TEXN :
QUESTION z

¥©3 o

— is net premised at all upon the fact

that these are personal papers, but almost the opposite» that
they are presidential, official papers»
MR. HERSSTEIN:

That’s right»

right, basically, he has tern points»
saying they are personal?
QUESTION:

I think — that's

As to the privacy, he's

as to the executive privilege, —

It's quite the opposite®

MR® HERESTEIN:

— he's saying, "The presidency will

founder unless I can do this,"
I would like to comment on that,
QUESTION:

No, not necessarily founder, but

MR. HERESTSIN:
QUESTION:

Well, at least it will impair it.

— it will impair 'the protection of the

separation of powers that's found in our Constitution*
MR. HERZSTEIN:

Yes, that's right.

I think that basically what we face her© on that
quartion, the separation of powers, is -the situation in which
the incumbent executive, both the Ford Administration and the
Carter Administration, are satisfied that there is no impair• >»
mant of executive powers.
Congress is satisfied. So w© have two branches of
the government entirely satisfied, in fact, aiming at working
out these; problems of continuity of government in a certain way.
Mr. Nixon, a person who is no longer in the govern-

67

meat, who no longer is subject to public accountability , is
seeking the assistance of this Court to intercede with the
Executive Branch and tall the Executive Branch that the way
it is planning on handling Executive Branch records, with
concurrence of Congress, is a separation of powers»
We believe, Your Honor, that itcs a violation of the
separation of powers to do what Mr» Nixon is requesting.
QUESTIONj Do you share the view that Congress could
constitutionally provide that, on the termination of office of
any federal judge or Justice, all his papers then located
in any public building or under his control, relating to his
tenure of office, could be impounded until the archivists have
decided which were the personal items and which were those
relating to the decision-making process?
ME» HERSSTEIN: VM believe, Your Honor, and needless
to say this case its not before us, but w® have given attention
to that, and we address it in our brief. We believe that,
quite apart from the segregation, there probably is a grave —
there is certainly a b,?-sis for distinguishing judicial
records from Executive Brandi records.

There may be even

grave doubt as to the power of Congress to say that the
unpublished record's of members of the Judicial Branch are
subject to congressional power.
The reason I say that, without meaning to show any
lack of reverence for

Court, is that I think frankly the

68

public interest in having access to the unpublished records
of the Court is simply not nearly as great as that relating

J

to the President.
The President is part of a political process.

The

effectiveness of his regime and the legitimacy of what he
does depends on his following procedures that are designed to
maximize public information about what he's doing.

The

Court is insulated from the political process.
Every tiling the Court does is on the public record
already, the materials -that, it can use in reaching its
decision are only those on the record, and the decisions it
w

reaches are on the record.
In the case of the President, because he's part of
a political process and because of his vast powers, ha can
draw on any information he wants, it’s not on the public
record when he uses it, and many of the decisions he makes
are never on the public record.
QUESTION;

So w@ think —

Are you suggesting that we limit oar-

selves to ihe briefs when we reach a decision in the case,
and the record?
MR. HERZSTEIN:

w

Yes, I am, Your Honor.

[Laughter.3
QUESTION:

MR. RSRZSiTEIN:

that you don't want government agents, in -the dozens or maybe
a hundred, rummaging through these things.

That is one of

your constitutional challenges.
MR* MILLER:
right*

That’s right.

Yes,

That is precisely

And that is precisely what —
QUESTION:

To decide what’s personal and what

MR. MILLER:

That; is precisely what —*

isn’t.

QUESTION:

But you asked for your own man to go in

there and pick them out?
MR. MILLER:

No, sir? and the. reason is is because

the statute prohibited it.
QUESTION; Did you ask for it?
MR, MILLER:

No, sir.

QUESTION: The court: can — the court could have
given you that relief, despite —*
MR. MILLER:

If it was —

QUESTION: I;-;, you agre-a fis court could have given you

74
that relief* despite the statute?
MR. MILLER?

No.

I don't believe -r no* you cannot*
i

I don’t believe.
QUESTION:

Oh* you don’t think- the court could have

enjoined that part of the statute?
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

I don’t think it’s possible.
I see.

Not until the sorting-out process is

completed* I tak© it.
MR. MILLER:

No.

And * furthermore* if the Court

pleas©* with respect to the tape recordings themselves * we
have to remember that -there are two provisions of this
particular statute.

101{a)* which applies directly to the tape

recordings.* and that is a severable, disid.net and separate
suction from Section 101(b) * which seises all of the other
material.
QUESTION:

Mr. Miller* I think Mr. Herzstein

suggested that* of. the 42 million, total* there are about
200*000 or less that would qualify as personal documents„
Is that right?
MR. MILLER:

That may

that is what Mr. Herzstein

said.
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

tod do you agree with that?
No* I do not.

QUESTION: Thors are more; than. 200*000?

75
MR. MILLER;
QUESTION:

J

I think there are more than 200,000.
In the category of the Dictabelts and

other personal letters and things?
MR. MILLER;

Yes, I do. And the reason I say that

is —
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER;

Well, what does the record suggest?
The record shows that when Mr. Nixon

was asked during his deposition how many documents he had
seen in the course of his function as President of the
United States, he finally estimated approximately 200,000.
The-; record further shows that that has no relation­
ship whatsoever to the tapes, which is 5,000 hours of
w

conversations.

And he has — the evidence in the record shows

that he talked to his wife or his daughter one or maybe several
times a day.
QUESTION;

And recorded those also?

MR. MILLER; And that these ware recorded.

That he

had discussions with his lawyer, with his friends, he
discussed poll ideal matters as the head of the political
party. All of. - he-se political personal matters are on these
ipes, and there is no limitation in the statute that these

P

trp.SE: are “presidential material”.
QUESTION; .fell, what do you • think the — if it
suggests- anything

the record shows as to how many- would

fall into what you would define a: personal?

MR.

QUESTION;

J

There is —
As agcinst what otherwise would be

official?
MR, MlLLERs

There is no way to make a proper

estimate of the number of papers that are personal.

You take

the record which shows that Mr. Nixon resided in the white
House for five and a half years# that there ar© some 800
reels of taps that covered not only the Oval Office, the EOB
office, but; also the telephone in the residential part of the
White House,
QUESTION:

Incidentally, do fch© 42 million include,

ray-''brother Rehnquist suggested earlier — what about
papers or whatever they may constitute, at San Clemente or
in Florida?

Do these 42 million items include any of those,

or are we talking only about Whites House recordings?
MR, MILLER:

This 42 million, I don't know whether

it would include these or not. The statute, as the Court will
recall, empowers the Administrator of General Services to
take steps to retrieve any presidential materials which are
not at the White House, which would include those at San
Clemente, and —
QUESTION: Well, has that bean done?
MR. MILLER:

Ko# it has not, because the implementa­

tion of the statute was, in effect, stayed xvhen we filed our
lew&udt.

QUESTIONs

Well, I suggest that the 42 million

ara only White House originated documents.
MR. MILLER;

The White House, and frankly, maybe

20 million of those are government publications, anniversary
greetings, birthday greetings; I mean they have no bearing
whatsoever on this lawsuit.
But we* re talking here

the guts of this lawsuit

are the tapes and the presidential discussions and decision­
making process, and the political aspects of the President of
the United States for a five and a half year period.
I mean, this 42 million papers is a nother, it's a
makeway, it has no bearing on this case whatsoever.
What we’ra talking about is a man’s life for five and
a half years, acting as the President of the United States,
meeting with his associates and his subordinates, obtaining
advice from them, mseting with foreign officials, determining
the conduct of the foreign policy of -'die United States,
talking with hie wife, talking with his daughter the day
befor© she was married, and what discussions those were.
I mean, these are ska sum and substance of what we’re
talking about.

It’s not 42 million documents, that’s & figure

that shouldn't ©van be a part; of the record in terms of what
the gut issues of this case are.
Because- ws*re talking about a gross violation of the
Fourth Amendment that will take effect forthwith, because the

78
Section 102(b) gives access to agencies or departments of tfea
United States, they can review these records»

And let me

disabuse the Court, if I may, of one thing, and that is
the comingling argument.

Those records were comingling —

comingled because, for 200 years, the Presidents cf

the

United States had a right to expect the right to control and
the privacy of their papers.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Miller, before you sit down, Isd

like to ask you the-same question I asked your opponent.
Do you construe the legislative history as being
tantamount ‘to a finding that Mr. Nixon was an unreliable
custodian.?
MR. MILLER:

Listening to the argument of

my

esteemed opponent, that*a the only basis upon which you can
justify the legislation, that there was such a finding? and
that such % finding, existing as it does, turns this^Act
into a bill of attainder.

That’s our argument.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
Sttfharsupon, at 11:17 o’clock, a.ra., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted. 3
