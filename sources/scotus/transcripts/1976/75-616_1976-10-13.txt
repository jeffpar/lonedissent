MR6 CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 75~616, Village of Arlington Heights
against Metropolitan

Housing Development Corporation,

Mr6 Siegel, you may proceed whenever you’re ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK Ma SIEGEL, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR* SIEGELs Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please the
Courts
This cause is her© on certiorari, to the Court of
Appeals of the Seventh Circuit»
the district court»

The Court of Appeals reversed

This is a atoning case, in which the

Circuit Court held that the refusal to resone certain property
classified for single*family use, in the Village of Arlington
Heights, violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment»
In so doing, the Court of Appeals recognised that the
zoning ordinance of the Village of Arlington Heights, as applied
to the subject property, was not administered in a discriminatory
manner»

■

It found that the Village was attempting to protect
neighboring property values and to preserve fie integrity of its
zoning ordinance.
Nevertheless, the Court, based upon its findings that
the Chicago Metropolitan Area had a segregated housing market,

4
applied the compelling interest test* and held, in substance,
that the Village had an affirmative duty to rezone the property
in light of the fact that Arlington Heights, in 1970, had a
population of approximately 64,000, only 21 of whom were
Negroes.
The plaintiff in the case below, the respondent
her©, is the Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation»

It

is a not-for-profit corporation, established for the purpose
of building low and moderate-income housing in the Chicago
Metropolitan Area»
It has a 99-year lease and purchase agreement with
the Clerics of St» Viator, who are the owners of the 15-acre
tract which is the subject matter of this litigation»
The 15-acre tract is part of an 30-acre tract owned
by St» Viator, which is presently improved with a boys high
school, a novitiate and an old single-family dwelling»
The property has been zoned as part of the 80-acre tract since th© beginning of zoning in Arlington Heights for
single-family development»

Under the 1959 Comprehensive Plan

of the Village of Arlington Heights, the subject property was
shown for single-family purposes»
The portion of the property which is subject to the
39-year lease and the option to purchase consists of approxi­
mately 1,100 feet in a north and south direction, and approxi­
mately 600 feet in an east and west direction»

5

Ii*, is surrounded on all sides by the R-3 zoning
classifieafcion, and,with the exception of the property also
owned by St. Viator, surrounded on all sides by a single"family,
well-established, residential districto
Under the provisions of the Arlington Heights R-3
zoning classification, approximately 50 single-family homes
could be placed upon fee subject property.
The respondent sought rezoning to the R-5, which is
the multiple-family classification, for the purpose of
establishing 190 dwelling units.

Their contract to purchase

was conditioned upon reasoning and was also conditioned upon
sth@ securing of a 236 mortgage commitment;; under the prior
Federal Housing Act, 236 provided for federal assistance with
respect to the construction of multiple-family dwelling units.
I would draw the Court’s attention to page 115 of
the exhibit volume of the Appendix, in which we have a land
us© and zoning map indicating th@ physical characteristics of
the surrounding area.
I would also point out that Exhibits 11 and 14,
found at pages 121 and 123, contain photographs of the
surrounding area.
Under the provisions of the Arlington Heights Zoning
Ordinances, high schools, such as the high school on the site,
churches and monasteries or, in this instance, a novitiate,
are permitted uses under the R-3 classification.

QUESTION £

Where is Arlington Heights vis-a-vis the

City of Chicago?
MRo SIEGELs Arlington Heights lies in the northwest
suburban area, approximately 23 miles iron th® center of the
City of Chicago.,

It has a population, in 1970, of 64,000? at

th© present time we've recently had a Federal Census, Your
Honor, our population is now approximately 71,000«,
As I indicated, in 1970 there were 27 blacks? our
most recent Census shows there are now 200 blacks in Arlington
«

Heights, and 648 other non-white persons«
QUESTIONi

MRo SIEGELt

Is this west of Evanston?
Yes, sir„

It is almost directly due

west of Evanstono
QUESTION: All right-,
MRo SIEGEL;

Now, at the time of trial in 1973, and

this matter commenced with the denial of •she application for
rezoning in 1971, Arlington Heights had over 14,000 owneroccupied single-family dwellings-

It also had more than 6,000

multiple-family units in Arlington Heights*

So this is not a

case involving an effort to screen out rental units *
The zoning in Arlington Heights provided for an
4

additional 9,000 multiple-family units* That was on property
which was already zoned to permit multiple-family dwelling
units*

Vacancy rates for apartments in IS70, under the 1970

Census, which was before the Board when the decision was made.

7
was ever 11 percent.vacancy in the R-5 or the multiple»family
districts.

At 'the time of trial at least seven vacant R~5

parcels were for sale.
Now, the evidence shows that the Village policy was
to use R-5 classification as a buffer between the single-family
and commercial or industrial uses.
The Village denied the zoning, the Planning Commission
found in its report that the subject property would not
constitute such a buffer, because there was nothing to buffer.
The evidence in the record showed clearly 'that the
proposed development would have an adverse effect on additional
property values, in the neighborhood of ten percent.
Th© property on Drury Lane, the single-family homes
which back up, as indicated on our land use exhibit, range
in value from 50 to 70 thousand dollars.

The property south

of Euclid Avenue, which is the southern boundary, all single­
family, range in the area of from 40 to 50 thousand dollars.
The property west of Dryden is also in the 50 to 60 thousand
dollar class. And the property north of Oakton, which is the
northern boundary across from th© high school, are relatively
new homes, built within five years of the trial, some homes
still under construction, they also range in the 60 to 70
thousand dollar class.
Th© evidence shows also that the subject property
could be economically developed for single-family homes at a

8
pric© range comparable or higher than the existing single-family
homes in the area.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Kane, who was the Real
Estate Manager of th© plaintiff, testified that except for the
fact that the Clerics of St. Viator wished to get $300,000,
which was the purchase price, for the property, the property
could have been developed for low and moderate singla-family
homes, which were then eligible under the so-called 235
program.

Except that they couldn't afford to pay more than

$200,000 for the price — for single-family purposes„
So

that there’s no question that, this property was

properly zoned in terms of its suitability, the surrounding
land uses, all the criteria which I indicate in my brief were
the criteria normally applied to zoning matters.
The trial court found that the Village was motivated
by a legitimate desire to protect property values and the
integrity of the Zoning Plan.

It found that low-income

workers do not have a constitutional right to low-income
housing, either where they work or elsewhere.

There was no

evidence proving discrimination against racial minorities
from the low-income persons generally.

And the trial court

found that there were no specific violations of ‘the Fair Housing
Act, or the Civil Rights Act, and that thore was no violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Court of Appeals, as I have indicated, found that

9

the findings of th© trial court should not b@ disturbed, and,,
in essense, said that the Village's reasons for rezoning were
th® protection of property values, were for th© preservation of
the integrity of the Zoning Ordinance.
Tli® Court specifically found that th© evidence did
not support a finding that th© Village was administering its
buffer policy in a discriminatory manner, found that the
trial court’s dstermination was not clearly erroneous.
The Court of Appeals also recognized that merely
because racial minorities constituted a higher percentage of
low and moderate-”income category did not n©an that the refusal
to rezone have th© type of racially discriminatory effect that
required the implication of the compelling interest test.
But, to my mind, illogically it then proceeded to rely upon
what it judicially determined was the segregated housing
market in a Chicago Metropolitan Area* and compelled

and

applied the compelling interest test.
Now, the Village’s position in fliis matter is very
simple. We take th© position ‘that the fact that the Zoning
Ordinance may have a greater impact upon the poor or a minority
group does not thereby invalidate it, or cause it to be a
violation of th© equal protection clause of th® Fourteenth
Amendment*
Th® evidence indicated that, in the Standard
Metropolitan Area, that’s a six™county area around Chicago,

10

approximately 40 percent of fcha blacks who resided in that
area would b® eligible for the housing which was proposed here,
low and moderate-income housing, in the so-called Lincoln Green
Project.
There is no evidence that anyone has ever been
denied housing in Arlington Heights because of their race.
As a matter of fact, the answers to interrogatorias indicated
Arlington Heights was the first community in a northwest
suburban area to adopt the Fair Housing ordinance.
Mr. devise, a demographer, who testified for MHDC,
testified that based upon the economics of the situation,
approximately five percent of the housing units in Arlington
Heights were available to blacks in the Chicago Metropolitan
Area, and that if housing was determined solely for economic
j

reasons there would be a black population in excess of 3,200
blacks in Arlington Heights.
This indicates, to our mind at least, that it was
the economics of the situation, not the zoning, nothing that
the Village of Arlington Heights has done by way of zoning,
which has in any way impaired the rights of blacks to live in
Arlington Heights.
We believe, therefore, that what, the Court of
Appeals has dona is applied one set of zoning criteria for socalled whit© housing and another set of criteria for housing
which may contain black or poor people.

11
We believe that under the decisions of this Court? in
Lindsey vs. Normet? Rodriguez ? and the other cases which I have
cited in my brief? there is no fundamental constitutional right
to housing? and that the Court erred in applying the compelling
interest test.
The proper test? w© believe? following Bell© Terr©
and Euclid? is the test of rational relationship to a permissible
Stateobjactive.

And we believe that the Zoning Ordinance bears

such a rational relationship.
We also believe that under the criteria which have
been established for the decision of zoning cases ? the surround­
ing land use and zoning? suitability of the property for the
purposes zoned? the presumption of validiiy?that the MHDC
failed to overcome the presumption of validity? we believe
■Uiat the Court should not substitute its judgment for that of
the legislative body? or that a federal court should sit as a
super Zoning Board.
The Ordinance is patently reasonable.

I think that

Your Ho no is will determine by simply looking at the land use
map and at the photographs indicating the actual uses in place?
the ordinance is not? on its face or in feet? aimed at a
racial or economic minority.

It is a valid exercise of

legislative discretion? and it should not b© set aside.
QUESTION; What ordinance are you talking about?
MR. SIEGEL;

I’m talking about tee Arlington —

12
QUESTION?
MR» SIEGEL;
QUESTION;
MR» SIEGELs

I thought 'this was a failure to rezone»
A failure to resone»
So what ordinance are you talking about?
I’m talking about the Village of

Arlington Heights Zoning Ordinance and specifically the
classification of the subject property for R-3 single-family
purposes»

This zoning has bean in existence since, as I

indicated the first zoning in Arlington Heights# this is not
a failure to rezone, this is not the Dailey case, this is not
Kennedy Homes case, where there was a r©zoning to keep out»
QUESTION; Well, this is a failure to rezone, this
case, -that’s what the —
MR» SIEGEL;
QUESTION;
MR» SIEGEL;

It!s a failure to rezone.
Yes »
Yes, sir» But it w«is a continuation of

existing zoning»
QUESTION;
MR» SIEGEL;

Of existing zoning»

Right.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

Right»

QUESTION;

Well, that’s what a refusal to rezone is,

almost by definition, isn’t it, a continuation of existing
zoning?
MR» SIEGEL;

It’s a continuation of the prior zoning»

QUESTION; So when you speak of the ordinance, you mean
t

the status as it existed before.

13

MR» SIEGEL:

As it existed then and as it existed

at the time of the trial.
Now# we also believe that the respondents in this
case lack standing.

The trial court held that the two blacks

who actually testified did not have standing to represent a
proper class. They were a Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Ransom, who were
employed at Honeywell.
in Arlington Heights.
QUESTION:

Neither of whom had ever sought housing
One of them had looked at want ads.

Mr. Siegel, I want to b® sure.

Was there

an objection on standing grounds made in the trial court?
MR. SIEGEL:

Yes# sir, I filed a motion originally

to have the case dismissed for lack of standing.

My motion

is found in the first volume of the Appendix, on pages 20 and
21, paragraph 4, I raise the question of standing.
QUESTION:

Let me be sure about -- is it Maldonado?

MR. SIEGEL: Mrs. Maldonado was an intervener.
QUESTION:
MR. SIEGEL:

Is she still living in the Village?
She lived in the Village at the time

of the trial; to the best of my knowledge she still lives
in the Village.
QUESTION:

Have any of the other individuals, named

individual plain-tiffs, demonstrated any interest in housing in
Arlington Heights , —
MR. SIEGEL:
QUESTION:

No, sir# not to my -- pardon me# sir.
on the record?

14
MR» SIEGELs

Mot on the record»

One of them lives

in Evanston, which is another suburban community»

He testified

he lived there with his mother and his son in a five-room
house.

His mother also had a £ull“*time job, and there is no

indication that they even qualified with respect to income.
And he commuted 45 minutes to Arlington Heights,
The other gentleman lived in the City of Chicago,
had moved further away in order to buy a two™flat in Chicago,
he was renting out one apartment for $160 a month, I believe,
and he resied -there with his wife and child, his wife was
also employed. There is no evidence that €iither of them had
aver indicated any interest in housing in Arlington Heights,
except, I believe, Mr, Guthrie said that he had read the
want ads,
QUESTION;

Mr, Siegel, you say the district court

held there was no standing,

I read its opinion otherwise,

MR» SIEGEL; No, sir.

No, sir, they didn’t hold

there was no standing, they held it was not a class action,
QUESTION;
MR, SIEGEL;
QUESTION;
MR, SIEGEL;
QUESTION;
MR, SIEGEL;

Yes,
Yes, sir,
Dut you raised the standing question»
I raised the standing question —
In the district court.?
— initially in a motion to strike and

dismiss. The predecessor judge, not Judge McMillan, Judge

15

Lynch, who had the case originally, denied my motion.
QUESTIONS

How about in the Court of Appeals?

MR. SIEGELs The Court of Appeals didn't talk about
it at all.
QUESTION; Did you talk about it to the Court of
Appeals?
MR. SIEGEL;

I talked about it in my brief, I

raised it in my brief, I argued it orally.
QUESTION s

Unh-hunh.

MR. SIEGELs

And I also argued the fact that MIIDC

had a contract to purchase conditioned on zoning, conditioned
on a 236 commitment.
the trial.

The 236 program was dead at the time of

But under Illinois law, the so-called Clark vs.

City of Evanston case, a mere contract purchaser does not have
standing because he isn't damaged.

If he doesn't get the

zoning, he walks away.
QUES TION;
MR. SIEGEL;

Unh-hunh.
So I argued that, and that was clearly

before the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION;

They did not touch on it.

Had the case of Warth v. Seldln been

decided here at the time of the Court of Appeals decision?
MR. SIEGEL;

Yes, sir, I believe it was decided

before the Court of Appeals decision, it was not decided at
the time of Judge Lynch's decision.
And I rely, of course, on Warth vs. Seldln.

16
It’s our position that the failure to grant the
rezoning request did not violate the Civil Rights Act or the
Fair Housing law or the

Fourteenth Amendment.

Any other

decision would have been spot zoning and would have destroyed
the integrity of our zoning plan»
The property is clearly suitable for single-family
purposes.

The trial court so found.

The trial court also found

that -there was no discrimination involved in this case*, and the
Court of Appeals refused to set aside that finding of fact.
We believe that the Fourteenth JUnendment and the
CimX.Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act does not protect —
purport to discrimination based upon economics.

This is

essentially a garden variety zoning case, in which the argument
is made that because of single-family zoning, poor people
cannot reside on that property, and that there is a higher
percentage of poor people who are black, and therefor*©,
according to the respondents, this is a violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment.
Nov;, this argument has been raised in this Court in
other connections.

The San Antonio School District case, the

Rodriquez case, Lindsey vs. Nonnet, James vs. Vaitierra, Palmer
vs. Thompson, and in the Court of Appeals of the various
districts, including Acevedo and Mahaley Housing^ Authority casse.
We believe that the Court of Appeals held that lowincome persons have special privileges to have low-income

17
housing if there is a possibility that a higher percentage of
minorities will be in their number.

We do not believe there

is any basis in the Fourteenth Amendment for this position.
The fact that a zoning ordinance may have a greater
impact upon the poor or a minority group clearly does not
invalidate it.

The most recent, case, which I’ve cited in my

supplemental brief, is Washington vs. Davis.
There is no affirmative duty, wcs believe, under the
Fourteenth Amendment to change a valid zoning ordinance, absent
a showing of purposeful discrimination, simply to accommodate
low-income people.

We believe that Milliken vs. Bradley and

Washington vs. Davis clearly establishes this fact.
The'fact that, as I said, that enforcement of an
ordinance may have a greater impact upon the poor does not
render it invalid under the equal protection clause, under
the teachings of this Court in James vsValtierra.
As a matter of fact, in Warfch vs. Seldin, which we
rely on on the standing case, I believe tit is Court, specifically
said that the failure of low-income people to reside in that
suburban community was based on their economic situation and
not upon ~ could be based upon their economic situation and
not upon any zoning pattern.
QUESTION:

But th© position of Metropolitan Housing

Development Corporation her®, as an actual applicant for
rezoning with a contingent contract, makes it a little bit

18

different than any of the parties in Warth v. Seldln.
MR» SIEGEL;

Yes.

QUESTION; Doesn’t it?
MR» SIEGEL;

Yes

„ sir,

I believe it does.

Except

that they are a purchaser subject to coning, subject to a 236
commitment.

And, at least under the Illinois lav?, such a

party does not have a right to challenge, because they have no
property interest.
I would point out, of course, that the owners of the
property have never been a party to this .'Lawsuit, the Clerics
of St. Viator, who would lose, presumably, $300,000, fchsir
purchase price, if the zoning was not granted or the commitment
was not received.
QUESTION; Well, it’s fairly typical in this kind of
litigation, isn't it, to have the potential purchaser have *—
conduct the zoning litigation rather than the seller?
MR» SIEGEL;

Yes, sir.

But, at least in Illinois,

it is typical to have the property owner join»

And, as I

indicated, the Illinois Supreme Court, in the Clark case, had
the situation where only the contract purchaser
on the litigation, and not the owner»

was carrying

They specifically held

that since the contract purchaser really had nothing to lose
by way of the failure to receive zoning, that they had no
standing.
Also, I think the trial court pointed out that merely

19

because MUDC was organized for the purpose of low and moderate»income housing, it didn't have any special racial character­
istics under the Fourteenth Amendment, and it should be treated
the same as any other corporation»
QUESTIONs

Mr® Siegel, in some places a zoning

application like this requires a pledge of & commifemanfc to
execute the project»

That is not required, I take it, under

Illinois law?
MR® SIEGELs
practice, Your Hon or»

It is not required as a matter of
Normally when property is rezoned, it

is rezoned to permit a specific use, in this instance it would
have been a so-called planned development, and the property
could only be developed in accordance with the specific plan®
But there is no statutory or case requirement in
Illinois, the commitment for the developer to go ahead®

And

the trial court indicated, after reaching the decision on the
merits, it would have been reluctant, to grant any relief because
of the fact that 236 program was dead, and this would simply have
rezoned . property and opened it up to any of the uses permitted
under the R-5 classification.
We believe that the ordinance is presumed valid®
The party assailing itmu^t overcome it by clear and convincing

And if the decision of the legislative body is

fairly debatable, -the Court will not substitute a judgment®
And there# of course, Euclid vs» Ambler, eind Belle Terr®

case

20
are hornbook law.

That proposition»

We believe, as X*v@ indicated, that the respondents
lack the standing to bring this action for the reason that these
are non-residents, not residing in Arlington Heights, no
showing that, this was a class action, that the intervenor, Mrs»
Maldonado, resided in Arlington Heights.

The other intervenor,

the Northwest Opportunity Center, is a welfare organization
funded in part by the Village of Arlington Heights and part
by the federal government, who are there to take care of lowincome people in the Chicago Metropolitan Area.
The testimony of Mr. Newton, who was their director,
was that at the time of trial there were 188 low-income families
in Arlington Heights, that there were approximately 1500 in
the Arlington Heights area, many of them were Spanish sumamed,
and Mexican — originally migratory workers who have settled
there.
Mrs. Maldonado clearly was not zoned out of the
Village, because Mrs. Maldonado lives in the Village.
Therefore, Your Honors, it is our hope that this
Court will not ©levate or degrade th© Fourteenth Amendment
into the proposition that there is one set of zoning laws for
all people except th© poor or the minoriti.es»

The Village of

Arlington Heights, let ms emphasize, has not discriminated,
this trial court so found, but, as a mattesr of fact, th© ferial
court was correct? there was no evidence of discrimination

21
and -fab© Village of Arlington Heights does not discriminate»
I would lik© to reserve my last five minutes for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Siegel.

Mr. Caruso.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF F. WILLIS CARUSO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONEENTS
MR. CARUSOj

Mr» Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
This is not a garden variety zoning case. This is a
case of racial discrimination.
Mr. Ransom and Mr. Guthrie do desire to live near
where they work, and they don't want to drive 40 and 50
minutes a day to get there in Chicago's bitter cold weather,
and sometimes —
QUESTION:

Well, does the record demonstrate that

statement?
MR. CARUSO:

Yes, it does, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Where?
MR. CARUSO:

The testimony, and I will give you the

the testimony of both Guthrie and Ransom show that they
went out and looked.

What counsel is referring to is that he

is saying that because they did not go and confront whit©
people, that they did not know that they could confront white
people, that they looked, but they could not find what they

22

wanted, and,.perhaps because of their fear of whites and their
fear of this location, did not pursue it, that is not looking,
that can’t be the case,
QUESTIONS

IIow does your statement. about discrimina*

tion square with the Court of Appeals finding?
MR. CARUSO:

I think the Court of Appeals finding,

Your Honor, squares with the standard set by Washington vs.
Pavisa

I think, though it may not fall completely in the

Washington vs, Davis format, the Court in looking at Valfcierra
and analyzing tfe situation, said that the impact alone was not
sufficiente

But taking into account the 'totality of the

situation, and then they went through the totality, the high
segregation of the Chicago Metropolitan Area»
QUESTION: Well, that isn’t what Washington v. Davis
says,

Washington v, Davis says you must have a fact which

certainly was found by the Court of Appeal.s here, and you must
have intent»

The district court found no ^intent# and the

Court of Appeals upheld that finding»

There’s no totality

of the circumstances involved in that test,
MR. CARUSO:

I think that there clearly is, there’s
!

two aspects of that.

First, both at the discovery level and

again at the trial level, the Court precluded us from going
into the question of motivation, purpose and intent, when we
started.
QUESTION:

Then you’re arguing that the Court of

23
Appeals* ruling that the district court's finding was not
totally erroneous should, be set aside by this Court?
MR. CARUSO;

No.

The Court of Appeals did not

directly go to all of the questions as clearly erroneous *
QUUSTIONs

Well, but it said, it specifically said

it would not s©t*side the district court’s finding that there
had been no discriminatory intento
MR, CARUSO;

Based on the buffer zone applicatione

I would also agree, however, that, they didn't set aside any thing
as clearly erroneous»
But there's 'two aspects of it.

On© is that we were

not allowed to go into intent and motive, because of Palmer vs»
Thompson and O'Brien at that time, and the» Court said that
that is Judge McMillan said that his perception of this case
was that motive and intent was not important, and that if the
impact could be shown that that was sufficient»
Based on his perception of the case, then, h®
prevented us from asking Mrs. Harms and other people what
happened at the meetings, what was discussed, what was the
intent, what was the purpose? we couldn’t go into that.
In addition to that, however, we believe that the
record shows, from the bitter statements in the papers, the
letters, the nature of these meetings, that the intent and
purpose, the racial discrimination, and the statement by
Mayor Walsh at the end, -that this

was a mandate from the

24
people»
QUESTION;

Well, then, you are asking us fco set aside

the Court of Appeals’ affirmance of the district court’s
finding that there was no purposeful intent?
MR. CARUSO;

No, I think that the Washington vs.

Davis standard allows the termination of purpose and intent
from the totality of the facts, and that the totality of the
facts here shows the racial purpose for denying this development.
The whole totality of the situation, the fact that
•there is no real reason for turning it down, there is no
integrity to this zoning ordinance, the Court of Appeals said
that the decline in the budding property owners, those 17 homes,
was not the kind of substantial reason that would allow this
kind

of a discriminatory effect.
And so we believe that within i±ie Washington vs» Davis

framework, purpose and intent can be shown.
In addition to Ransom and Guthrie, who worked and
have been moved to Arlington Heights — and that is in the
transcript, and it starts with page 220 of the transcript, with
Guthrie’s testimony — Ml!DC has standing and desires to build
and can build.

AT the time of the trial, 236 was not dead,

President Nixon at that time had a moratorium on 236$ and
later a Court of Appeals held that -that would not stand.
Since that time, the Community Development Act has
been passed, and under Section 8 this development can be built

25

with a very similar type of financing and provisions for low and
moderate-income people.
So if there was a period of moratorium, that has
passed, and it can now be constructed, and MIIDC is prepared to
go ahead»

It has a definite important, stake in this case,

and would like to get on with building this low and moderateincome housing»
Mrs» Maldonado also testified, although it is not
directly testimony as to her present location, and there was
testimony in the record about the low standard of housing that
Spanish-Americans ar© allowed to live in in Arlington Heights»
There is a pledge by MIIDC to continuis to control
this» This is a not-for-profit corporation, with an outstanding
board of directors, which is concerned with equal opportunity
in housing throughout the Chicago Metropolitan Area, they
gave letters to th© municipality, they committed to sticking
with this development forever, to see that it was wellconstructed, well-managed by this not-for-profit corporation»
So the commitment and the stake fully provides for
the question of Warfch vs» Seldin, and a stake in th© develop­
ment»
All of these people have standing»
Th© zoning —
QUESTION; All you need is one, isn't it?
MR» CARUSO;

That's right, Your Honor, and the

sufficient standing# and I don’t b-aliev© -they — they said
Guthrie# that is# Judge McMillan said Guthrie and Ransom did

The — one of the statements that was made by counsel
was that seven other parcels were for sale at the time.

parcels were not for sale, and they could not b© used for low
and moderata~income housing, because there is a limit of $2,003
per unit in each of the homes.

Wall, why does Arlington have to have it?
Arlington Heights is a unique situation.

A tremendous growth from 1950 of 8,000 people to now 64,884
people. The growth in jobs, which is set forth, of 100,000
jobs in that area? the movement of jobs from Chicago to that

area.
There are probably six communities like Arlington

31

Heights in the Chicago Metropolitan Area that would be in the
category that we are here showing.
The exclusion of blacks.

The tremendous growth.

The exploitation of that situation.

And the lack of any evidence that any good»*faith effort is any­
where involved in this municipality to deal with the situation
or to responsibly assist in solving the problem.
Here a not-for-profit developer of the highest
quality has offered the town an opportunity* with 190 units*
to solve this situation* and all we're asking is that -fch© town
stand aside and allow the purpose of Congress to provide for
fair housing throughout the United States * and the Department
of Housing and Urban Development*to creata opportunities out­
side the traditional ghettoes.
For Arlington Haights to stand aside and allow us to
do that.
And it isn't the parade of horribles* of striking
down zoning„

There may be six of these communities out of

157 in the Chicago Metropolitan Area* and there may b© six around
other large metropolitan areas* where the business has moved to
fch© suburbs* the jobs are moving out to wherever* but the
minorities cannot follow the jobs * and are required either to
give up the opportunity to work * or to drive these tremendous
distances to and from fch® job.
In addition* fch© soning around the — this piece of
15-acre parcel* is vacant at the present time to the north and

32
to the west.

To the east are 17 single-fcunily homes which

actually abut toe property.

To the north is an open space

which is toe play field, c football practice field for the
high school* and to the west is a communal living facility
in which the various clerics live, it’s a three-story, very
large building, which is in the nature of a living facility
for the people working for and participating in the training
of to® high school and other St, Viator institutions.
To the south is a highly travel€;d street, Euclid
Avenue, that runs to the Arlington Heights. Race Track, and
there is testimony that it is a very highly traveled business
street.

To toe south of that are single-family homes.
And to toe south and to the west of the «30-acre

parcel are some single-family homes, which are of the lesser
price, of 30 to 40 thousand dollars.
We are not asking the town to do any affirmative
duty.

In the cases that counsel cites do not relate to this

case, this is not a Lindsey vs, Hormet case.
through the cases he cited in the brief,

We have gone

This is not that kind

of a case.
This is a case where there is nc requirement on the
Village,

The tax impact study, which is in toe record, shows

that the per-pupil income from this development will be higher
than if it 'were single-family, per pupil.
The income to the Village would be higher than if it

were a single-family»
development»

So the Village will make money on this

There is no problem with water, sewer» The

traffic problem is slight and the Village «—
QUESTIONs

Presumably the zoning decision was mad©

with all that -— with an awareness of all those .factors, was
it not?
MR» CARUSO:

Yes, Your Honor, it was, and that's one

of the things that’s extraordinary in the totality of facts»
All of the evidence presented by all these.* experts, BartonAshman, a leading traffic study? tax impact people? experts
on housing and urban development.

All of these range of

experts were all in the record, and all showed that it was a
good zoning, valuable.

There was no objection by any of the

*—■ the engineer of the Village, the police! chief, the fire
chief, any one in the Village, they approved it. There is a
sheet where they approved this development.
QUESTIONS Well, of course, if there had bean an
application here for high-rise, a cluster of high-rise apart­
ments, they night have been able to show that there would have
been three or four times the tax revenues that would be
produced either by present zoning or by your proposed zoning»
But would that be determinative?
MR»CARUSO:

I think that that's a different,

completely different thing»
QUESTION:

And there is —

You are emphasizing the benefits, but the

34

zoning authority was obviously aware that there were benefits,
and then they concluded there were detriments, and they weighed
them and made their decision ,
MR0 CARUSOs

Is that not so?

I think that the point I am trying to

make is that all of the information before! them showed the
benefits.

They didn't have any information before them to

show that anything but this was a good development.

They

have a planner-, who is a professional planner, who is employed
by the municipality, and he testified that; no on© ever asked
him his opinion.

He reviewed it, he testi.fiad he reviewed it.

This is the professional planner, whose responsibility is to
review these plans.
it.

He reviewed it, he testified he reviewed

They never asked him his opinion.

And there's no evidence

■they ever asked anybody else.
So that all the evidence here shows it was a good
development, it met all the criteria.

And in 60 other cases,

Your Honor, they had approved other zoning.

And if you —

counsel has referred to the maps, these zonings are all over
Arlington Heights.

And 53 of those abut single-family homes.

And in some cases they abut much fancier single-family
homes than are involved here.
The process in Arlington Heights is to approve all
these sonings everywhere, except where ouxs is.

And, although

?

‘Che Court found that there wasn't a YITWO type violation, the
Court did find that their process of approving was not

35

uniformly followed*

And to compare it# let’s say# to Washington

vs* Davis # this would be like giving a police test whenever
you thought you should# and whenever whites failed it# allowing
them to be on the force# but when blacks failed it# not
allowing them to be on the force*

That's the situation here*

Sometimes they apply the test to white developments#
sometimes they turn down whit© developments for certain
reasonsi but whenever a development comes in that would be
racially integrated# then this test is used to keep them out*
And that's the process of what is sometimes referred to as a
holding pattern zoning*

Everything is held as R-3.

When

comeone comes in on R-5# like these 60 other cases# they then
approve them after looking at who the developer is# whether
they can be assured that that developer will bring in the
right kind of people# and whether or not it should be
approved.

But in 53 of those cases# the argument that's

mad® here# that it would abut single-»families # was disregarded
completely*
QUESTION;

You still think you don’t have any

trouble with Washington v* Davis?
MR* CARUSO;

Your Honor# we think that the Court of

Appeals# in analyzing the totality of facts *— and the record
her® is mostly documentary# all of the documents were stipulated
to before the case was brought to trial# and the record builds
on that documentary evidence*

In reviewing that documentary

36
evidences, the Court of Appeals analysed Valtierra and*
although maybe it didn't completely anticipate Washington vs0
Davis t did talk in terms of the fact that 'die racial impact
alone was not enough to create a constitutional violation*
and then went on to talk about the racial hostility* to talk
about th© fact that the Village board recognized that the
people had this animus* and that they had a mandate from the
people not to approve this type of project,.
And I think in the totality* Washington vs „ Davis *
it seems to ms * recognized that the police force had tried to
find people to fill these positions* and when they didn't
show up* after they passed -the test* they went out and tried
to get them* tried to bring them in* to get them on th® forcec
Under th® totality of facts in Washington vs „ Davis *
there's a completely different atmosphere* attitude* background
than there is in this all-white community* which has developed
in a way to exclude blacks from that municipality.
QUESTIONS Well* Mr. Caruso* did you press your
statutory claim as a separate issue in the lower court?
MR, CARUSO:

Yes* we did* Your Honor.

In both the

district court and the Court of Appeals * we urged the violation
of the 1968 Fair Housing Act.
QUESTION:
MR. CARUSO:

Did you ever specify a section?
Your Honor* in the

district court*

th® discussion was not brought up where we had an opportunity

37

to explain fco the judge the operation of 3604, that is, to make
housing otherwise unavailable, or 3617 violation.
QUESTION:

And is that one of your issues you

pressed in the Court of Appeals?
MRo CARUSO s
QUESTION;

We did — we did — our
Well, is there anything in the Court of

Appeals' opinion about it?
MR. CARUSO;

No, there isn't, Your Honor.

QUESTION; Well, how did tlie Court of Appeals move
directly to the constitutional issue without dealing with the
statutory question first?
MR. CARUSO;

Your Honor, I don't: think I can answer

that.
QUESTION; Well, do you think the Court of Appeals
then dealt with your statutory issue or not?
MR. CARUSO;

Your Honor, I just cannot say whether

or not they did.
QUESTION; Well, do you think you raised — do you
think you named the statutory issue as one of your questions
in your petition for certiorari?

Are you pressing it here?
Yes, Your Honor, we are.

MR» CARUSO;

We believe that the constitutional judgment below
may be sustained» We also believe that the violation of the 196 8
Fair Housing Act -QUESTIOIJ ; But the Court of Appeals has never dealt
with th© statutory issue»
MR» CARUSO;

That's right*. Your Honor»

But we believe that the — this Court could determine#
on the statutory basis*, a violation of the 1968 Fair Housing
law*, under 3617 or under 3604o
QUESTIONi And all you have to say about that is in
your brief?
MR» CARUSO:

Yes# Your Honor»

QUESTION: Well, can't it be inferred that the Court
of Appeals did deal with the statutory claims?

It certainly

mentioned them# on A3 — I'm reading from its opinion on A3
of the Appendix — and then moved right or to the constitutional
question»

And if it was doing anything like what an appellate

court ought to do# or any court ought to do# it was,by moving
onto the constitutional question# it was holding that there was
nothing to the statutory claims# wasn't it?
MR» CARUSO;

I have not read it that way# Your Honor.,

I cannot explain# as Justice White has indicated# I cannot
explain what was in the minds of the Court of Appeals»
QUESTION;

No# I can't# either»

But that — applying

39

normal standards of what courts are supposed to do, that would
be the logical inference, wouldn’t it?
MRo CARUSO;
QUESTION?

Well, Your Honor, I —
They don’t reach a constitutional question

unless it's absolutely necessary to do so,
MR0 CARUSOs

—» I would believe that that is correcto

And I would argue, however, that we believe that the Court
could rule with respect to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, and
we would urge the Court to consider that .as well as the
constitutional issue? and we are continuing to urge that.
One of the reasons that we continue to urge that is
that the Congress has, in applying and accepting its
responsibility, interpreted the problem of fair housing, and
discrimination with respect to housing is one of the most
important and, as in -the frafficanti, •. it was stated, a
matter of the highest priority.
And, as interpreted, the discrimination in housing
issue, in a content of 1968, and indicated

how complicated and

sophisticated the discrimination is, by going into refusing
to sell, making otherwise unavailable, denying housing when
in fact the housing is available,
QUESTION;

Do you think that a municipal corporation

like Arlington Haights can be — it's covered by the provision
that you’re talking about of the 196 8 Act, that it’s a person?
MR, CARUSO;

I would — yes, I believe — no, I

40

believe it is a person and also a corporation, as mentioned by
the Act, Your Honor,,
QUESTION'S Do you think that applies to a public
municipal corporation?
MR» CARUSO;

Yes, I think it is, because this is a

municipal corporation of Illinois.
QUESTIONS

The Court of Appeals® opinion begins

the discussion of the legal issue by saying that the first
contention that you raised was the equal protection»
don’t say the only contention.

They

That surely implies that, as

you suggested, that you argued the statutory issue which they
had referred to.

And, as Justice Stewart suggested, by all

standards of reading an opinion, that means they denied your
statutory ground, rejected it.
MR. CARUSOs

Do you agree with that?

We just do not feel that they did that,

Your Honor. We cannot explain why.

We did present what we

thought was a good definition of what the 1968 Act was meant
to do, and that it did apply, and we did urge it. And we —
all I can say is I would continue to urge that the 1968 Act be
considered in considering this case.

And I believe this

Court could consider it, even in light of what may be some
indication in the Court of Appeals.
The situation with respect to the zoning and the
preparation of the Arlington Heights development indicates that,
in comparison to the other developments which were approved,

41
it would meet the general requirements of the municipality.
And that the zoning could have been approved in accordance
with the procedures that were followed by the municipality.
We believe that the evidence does show that there was
substantial purpose on the part of the municipality, and that
the evidence shows further that -they did not present any
facts or reasonable explanation as to why the development had
been turned down, and that that is part of 'the totality of
facts o
We also, in connection with the dissent, we have
reviewed the record and the record indicates that non© of the
seven or nine parcels were available.

Both in Mr. Kane’s

testimony, where he indicates the prices of these, some of them
$50,000 an acre, some of them $42,000 an acre, indicates
there were no other R-5 parcels zoned9 that could have been
used because of the $2,000 limit per uni under HUD.
Mr. Opelka, their own appraiser, indicated that
$20,000 was the only parcel ha knew for single-family in.
Arlington Heights, and the multiple-family would all be
higher than that, and therefore priced out of our market.
Several of the seven parcels were too small, there
were five or six units, others had flooding problems, and the
others were not for sal® or war© over-priced.

Thera just

was no other opportunity.
And bsides that, the only way this kind of a develop-

42
rnant can b@ built: is where the opportunity comes along that a
religious order* such as the Clerics of S1:„ Viator* makes
this kind of property available to a particular developer*
and with, -that property available to the developer* the oppor­
tunity to make this kind of housing avail^ibl© on an equal
opportunity basis arises *
MHDC built a similar project for low and moderateincome people* 212 units„

They have bean involved in other

developments o They have a record of showing that they can
bring in minorities and whites to provide a truly integrated
development? and that’s what would be dona hare. ■That is the purpose of MHDC»

That is why

these

people on the boards of directors of the Leadership Council
and MHDC are working so hard on this*
We urge feha Court to affirm the decision of the
Court of Appeals as being in accordance with Washington vs.
Davis * and meeting the general framework there required»
Th© question of motivation and purpose needs further
inquiry»

One opportunity x-?ould be to go back and to go into

that* but we feel that's not necessary on this record»
We urge the Court to allow that Court of Appeals*
opinion to stand* so that w© can get on with building what we
believe will be a very fin© and healthful development in th©
Village of Arlington Heights*
Thank you.

43

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, Mr. Caruso.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Siegel?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JACK M. SIEGEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
*

MR. SIEGELs

Yes, sir.

If the Court pleasess

I would point out, first of all, that the Village of
Arlington Heights rejected 34 applications for multiple housing,
which did not involve lav? or mo derate-in com® housing, simply
because they did not mast the criteria of our planning
principles, including the buffer son®, which the trial court
and the Court of Appeals found wa were applying in a nondiscriminatory manner.
As a matter of fact, when Mr. Caruso says you will
find that some of those 60 approvals were contiguous to
single-family zoning, there's no question about it, that's
the whole idea.

You use multiple-family as a buffer between

more intense mid single-family development.
I would point out that their own witness, Mr. devise,
characterised Arlington Heights as a dormitory suburb, and
it had the least industry, the least commerce of the communities
around it.
So when Mr. Caruso says all the jobs are moving to
Arlington Heights, his own witness doesn't believe that.
Nov/, the fact of the matter is that the record showed
that Mr. Hanson, the Village manager, and Mr. Kessler, the

44
Village planner, were prepared and offered to find ether sites
for MHDC in Arlington Heights 0

The 212-unit project, which

is the only new project they've ever built- is located threequarters of a mile away from Arlington Heights, much closer
to our industrial area than Lincoln Green is.

So that they

are in tee Arlington Heights area now, and they have no
problems .
Mow, when Mr. Caru3© says that there has been an
effort to son© out blacks her©, this is jtsb not the fact.
We have permitted over 6,000 apartment units.

Mr. Kessler

testified that those apartments ranged from $160 a month up.
There were over 6,000 apartments, and an additional 9,000
zoned at the time of trial.
So to say teat we are trying to zone out —
QUESTION?

You have 6,000, how many Negroes?

MR. SIEGEL? There are 200, Your Honor, according to
the —
QUESTION:
MR. SIEGEL?

Of tee 6,000?
No, sir.

Two hundred out of 71,000

people. There are 200 blacks —
QUESTION?

Well, you’re talking about all these

apartments..
MR. SIEGEL?
QUESTION?
MR. SIEGEL?

Yes, sir.
How many Negroes are in these apartments?
I cannot answer that, Your Honor.

I

45
do have a copy of our latest —
QUESTIONi Well, ifc would b® less than 20Q, wouldn’t
it?
MR. SIEGEL:

Yes, sir, it would. Some of them are in

s ingle-» fami. ly homes .
But the Village is zoned —
QUESTION:

I'm

talking about apartments, not single-

fami ly homes.
MR. SIEGEL:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

But the Village’s zoning hasn’t done this.

What

Mr. Caruso is really arguing is that we have a different set
of zoning lav/s for poor people.

VThat he's saying is that

Arlington Heights land is too expensive for conventional,
multipla-family development.

Except for ■— pardon me, is too

expensive for 235 or 236? but that isn’t -irhe test of a
zoning ordinance, how expensive land is.
Thank you very much, Your Honors!.

I ask that the

Court of Appeals be reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:59 o’clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.}
