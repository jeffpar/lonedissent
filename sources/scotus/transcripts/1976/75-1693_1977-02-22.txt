MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. League, you may proceed whenever you' re
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD N. LEAGUE f ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. LEAGUE:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:
I’m Richard League from Raleigh, North Carolina,
to argue this case for the petitioners.
This is a case that hopefully involves the long
shot in the criminal justice: process, the possibility of
a broken plea bargain.
The case began back in January of 1972 in
Alamance County,. North Carolina.

At that time, Gary

Darrell Allison entered a plea of guilty to a charge of
"safecracking", or attempted safecracking.
In accordance with our state procedure, he ’-’as
examined to determine whether or not his plea was a voluntary
and intelligent act, and as a part of that proceeding, he
was asked several questions, one of which determined that
he knew the maximum punishment for his crime.

Another

was designed to determine whether or not there had been any
promises made to him in order to secure his plea.

He said

4
there had been none.
At the conclusion of this proceeding, the trial
judge accepted his plea and entered sentence of 17 to 21
years for the offense.
Some time after that he began post conviction
proceedings in the state court, and ultimately, in March,
'73, filed a writ of habeas corpus, or an application for
a writ of habeas corpus with the United States Middle
District — United States District Court for the Middle
District of Worth Carolina.
In that writ, he alleged that his plea had been
induced by a promise of ten years by his lawyer.

This

of course was the opposite of what he told the trial
judge.

He told him that no promises had been made to him

to secure his plea.
At first the District Court dismissed the writ.
Then it reopened the case.

And after some correspondence

with the petitioner about substantiating his claim ~~ he
claimed he had a witness to his lawyer's offer to him of
this ten year sentence — the District Court

again

dismissed his claim for failure to supply an affidavit with
regard to this.
On appeal the Fourth Circuit reversed the District
Court and held that the form of inquiry that was used,
addressing the accused to determine whether or not any

5
promises had been made him was an unreliable way to go about
this.

It also condemned the District Court’s attempt iso

have the matter substantiated by way of affidavit.
We are here before you todc'iy to assert as the
simple thrust of our araument that Townsend v. Sain
authorized the

District Court to accept the state court

findings on this matter? that there were promises made for
petitioner’s plea? and to adjudicate his habeas corpus
petition on the basis of it.
As far as reliability goes, there hasn't been
much law developing this aspect of the decision in Townsend
v. Sain or the statute that declares the law with regard
to it.

But it was a sworn proceeding.

That somewhat

differentiates it from most ^ule 11 inquiries, as I under­
stand them.

It was a proceeding in which the petitioner

himself testified — it was the sole testimony.

It was

also a proceeding that covered the matter involved, whether
or not there had been a promise for his plea.
j

With regard to the attacks on this type of inquiry
I hope that the Court will understand them to be largely
a matter of folklore z-ather than fact.

W

It developed from

impressions made, I believe, in the metropolitan Northeast
in the mid-fifties, early sixties.

To some extent they’re

based on a study done in the Midwest in the IhSO’s; I
think a misinterpretation of that study.

A gentleman

t

named Mr. Newman who is frequently quoted with regard to
the matter of guilty pleas observed a.series of arraignments
at that time and found that in none of them did any one,
in answer to a response about promises, say that the District
Attorney promised him a sentence.
That, of course, I don't believe is a remarkable
observation.

Because you would not

expect that.

Certainly

you wouldn't expect it in North Carolina.
I would say to you that whatever validity that
these observations and attacks on this type of proceeding
that we use had at one time, it’s pretty far removed in
time and space from North Carolina in 1972, the time, of
course, when, Allison entered his plea.
Since that time, or between the time, ten to

fifteen years time difference, you had the Brady decision
by this Honorable Court, which specifically incorporated
as a part of the definition of the voluntariness of a plea
knowledge of the actual value of commitments made to an
accused by the state.

And of course that was picked up

in some of our own cases well before Allison's plea.
One of the reasons asserted for finding that
the inquiry was not reliable, made by Mr. Goldsmith, was
that the word "promises" was one that was capable of being
very narrowly construed by a lawyer with regard to his
client, or in advising his client.

And the client would

7
i

therefore say there were no promises to him.

Although

he was aware of a deal, he would not consider that as a
promise.
But I believe that’s incorrect.

I believe that

ordinarily you would expect a man, no matter how the matter
was phrased, no matter whether the word promise was used to
him or not, to conceive of a deal as a sure thing, and to
conceive of it in terms of a promise, whether or not that
word was used.
Also another reason given for not accepting the
state’s proceeding in this case was the fact that the
man might not speak up, might not admit in court that
either there was a bargain, or that after it was breached,
that it was breached? that he would, for some reason, stay
silent.
But again, I would ask your Honors to recall that
the men,you're dealing with are not specially unassertive
people.

They are, after all, men who will rob you or

kill you, assault you.

You can certainly expect that a

fair number of them would speak up.

And certainly we were

able to find a few instances of that, and included them in
our brief.
With regard to this particular matter, I think
that if the Court were to depart from Townsend v, Bain, and
were not to allow the District Court to accept state court

8
findings in this context, .it would significantly undercut
one of the basic reasons for two of its subsequent cases,
the McCarthy case and the Boykin case.

Certainly one of

the hopes behind each of those cases was to cut down
post conviction work, or to

expeditiously handle it.

That would, of course, go by the board, and would do so
for a type of claim that I don't think a lot of people
give much credence to.
In Machibroda v. United

States this Court did

not describe this type of claim in very high terms.

The

Courts ofAppeal who have looked at it, and a number of them
even in remanding for a hearing, have indicated that they
did not think there was a very high likelihood of success
with regard to the matter below, at least from the
petitioner's point of view.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lecigue, can I just a'sk one

question?
MR, LEAGUE;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Is it your position that if the

record doss contain a statement by the defendant that no
promises were made, that's completely the end of the
matter?

He may not ever come in later and say, the reason

he said that was because his lawyer told him to do it?
MR. LEAGUE;

Your Honor, largely, unless he can

come forth with some new evidence, that's our position.

That’s comprehended by the Townsend v. Sain,

MR. LEAGUE:

substantial indication of it.
QUESTION:

required to — who makes a valid allegation, which if he
proves, he’ll win, and he's required to bring in an affidavit:

MR. LEAGUE:

Well, in any other case that might

be where he claimed he had a new witness.
that would be the standard way of doing :Lt.

I would think
Something

that wasn’t developed previously, something that wasn’t
before the Court.
QUESTION:

He just alleged that here.

Didn’t

he allege he had a new witness?
MR. LEAGUE:

Yes, sir, but he failed to come

across with any indicia of it, as directed by the
District Court.
QUESTION:

He has to bring in proof before he

gets a hearing?
MR. LEAGUE;

Indicia of proof, indicia of proof.

Of course, at hearing he could introduce the affidavit.

If in this very case he had filed the

exact same paper, but he had not said that somebody else
was a witness, wrmld that have required a hearing?
MR. LEAGUE:
QUESTION:
MR. LEAGUE:

No, sir.

Because the state had determined it,

and the district court could use the state’s findings.

MR. LEAGUE:

Well, they could have dismissed it

out of hand, or they could have required us to show cause.
Of course, they wouldn’t have had the state finding without
asking us to show cause.
QUESTION:
MR. LEAGUE:
QUESTION:

Mr. League?
Yes, sir,
Let me back up a little bit.

Now in

the federal court this is a civil case, is it not?
MR. LEAGUE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Governed by the federal rules of

civil procedure, even though it arises in a criminal
situation?
MR.LEAGUE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Under the federal rules of civil

procedure, could a — could the court direct a pre-trial
hearing to explore the claims of the — of a plaintiff in
a civil case before setting it for trial?
MR. LEAGUE:

As far as I know, yes, sir. it*s

happened in one case.
QUESTION:

Are you analogizing what the District
N-

judge did here with the magistrate to what a District judge
can do in a civil case, a damage case or any ordinary law­
suit, breach of contract, in the way of pre-trial explora­
tion by the pre-trial examiner, if they have one, or by
the magistrate, if they do not?
MR. LEAGUE:
your Honor.

That would be an acceptable analogy,

I thought of it really in terms of a hearing

without the witness present, a hearing on the basis of
records alone.

It8s sometimes described as a hearing

though it isn’t a hearing in the same sense that you have
live testimony.

I believe that in some of the decisions of

this Court a hearing has also been described in terras off a

15
review without live witnesses , perhaps the earlier habeas
hearings.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that this is con-

parable to the authority of a District judge to require a
plaintiff in a civil case to produce documents in advance
of trial for purposes of expediting the trial when it
occurred?
MR. LEAGUE:

I believe it is.

It's based in part,

like I say, your Honor, on the Townsend v. Sain situation
where a matter that’s been determined once before may be
reopened if there's an offer of newly discovered evidence
in a broader sense than that.
QUESTlOU:

Would you agree that in a criminal

case, as distinguished from a civil case, a District judge
would have no right to require a criminal defendant to
j

make some prima facie showing of his case, showing his hand
as it were and his defense theory?
MR. LEAGUE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Will you give me the case, please, where

in a civil case a man was ordered to bring an affidavit of
a xtfitness before he could file his lawsuit?

MR. LEAGUE:

No, I cannot.

I would speak just a little bit further, your
Honor, in that regard.

was vested in him by Townsend vc Sain.

I think it

Or at least I hope

it was.
And a somewhat comparable situation has been
developed by Congress with regard to habeas generally in
an authorization to allow affidavits on the merits.

Con­

ceivably the judge could have called affidavits from all
parties and decided the case on that basis.

No, he didn't.

No, he didn't.

wasn't faced in a previously -— statement by any other
person contrary to what he had said in court, like it was
with regard to the petitioner.
Going ahead then, and in conclusion of -- to my
argument, I'd just say that the District Court's discretion
in this type of case is any less advised than in any other.
Certainly the District Courts have practiced with some of
these men,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. FRANK GOLDSMITH, JR. r ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.
MR. GOLDSMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
My name is Frank Goldsmith, Jr., and I represent
the respondent prisoner in this matter, Gary Darrell Allison.
If it please the Court, I would like to go over
several additional facts to those which counsel for the
petitioner has stated.
QUESTION:

Mr. Goldsmith, were you in this at the

trial level?
MR. GOLDSMITH:

No, sir, I was appointed at the

Fourth Circuit level.
QUESTION:

Well, do you agree that that record

that got in there about that plea, how it got into the
record?
MR. GOLDSMITH:

I agree that that8s an accurate

transcript of the plea proceedings.
\

QUESTION:

No,/but. how did it get in the record?

You don't know?
MR. GOLDSMITH:
was put in the record.

Well, I wasn’t present when it

I think Mr. League is correct, that

it was furnished as an answer to the state’s — as an
attachment to the state's answer to the petition for a.writ
of habeas corpus.

And I believe it was certified to be an

23

accurate record by the clerk of the Superior Court of
Alamance County.
I don’t have any quarrel with the accuracy of
the record itself.

I have a great deal of quarrel with the

sufficiency of that record as a basis ttpon which the federal
District Court could deny this man a hearing in this matter.
I think it must be remembered that this is the
only record — the

record actually occurs in this form,

which is reproduced in the appendix at page 11.

It’s a

simple form on which the clerk of court merely records
the answers, yes or no answers, to the questions posed to
the defendant by the judge.
The only question that we’re concerned with, and
the only one that could possibly have any relevance to the
issue of a plea bargain or the existence of a plea bargain
in this case, is question number eleven: has a solicitor
or your lawyer or any policeman, law enforcement or lav?
officer or anyone els© made any promise or threat to you
to influence you to plead guilty in this case?

And the

only space provided is for a yes or no answer.

There is

no space provided for the terms of a plea bargain if one
existed.

And furthermore, on the reverse of the form, the

trial judge is required to find — because it’s printed on
the form that he find — that the plea was entered voluntarily
and without promise of leniency.

24

So, impliedly, on the very form itself, under the
old ■— and I stress this is the old North Carolina procedure
— there could have been no finding of any promise of
leniency.

The plea would have been stricken.
And therefore it’s not unreasonable to suppose

that a defendant would be expected to answer no to this
/

question of whether there'd been any promises or threats
made to induce him to plead guilty.
And I think it5s significant, the wording of
"promises or threats".

The two are coupled together, as

though that is an impropriety that could be expected to
be denied.

And I think that's in fact how the North Carolina

procedure was conducted during this period of time prior to
the Fourth Circuit decisions and the later legislation which
changed our proceeding.
It's not unreasonable at all to expect a
defendant in that situation to answer no to that question.
This is not simply a matter of my speculation on this part.
•Thera is authority cited in our brief -- there is authority
in fact cited in the petitioner's brief in this case — to
support the proposition that an answer like that is routinely
given, and even counseled to be given, by a defense attorney
in order to have a plea accepted.
It's been substantiated, X believe, in two
articles, at least two articles, which include empirical

25
research,, interviews with judges and lawyers, one in the
318

Yale Law Journal, a 1975 article by Professor Alschuler
entitled "The Defense Attorney's Role in Plea Bargaining",
at 84 Yale Law Journal 1179.

Another one in the 1970

Washington Law Quarterly, page 289, "The Trial Judge's
Satisfaction as to Voluntariness and Understanding of
Guilty Pleas"„
In both of these articles, evidence is cited
tending to support what is well known, to any practitioner
at that time in North Carolina that plea bargains were
never disclosed in response to such a question on such a
fora.

Plea bargains ware routinely raade and entered into.

Thera was nothing improper about plea bargains.
simply did not ever appear on the record.

But they

They were never

disclosed, in response to that question.
There is another fact that I think is significant
in this case, and that is the fact that this plea colloquy
and the sentencing of the defendant occurred only 37 days
after this Court's decision in Santobello.

And to the extent

that Santobello legitimized plea bargaining, or was viewed
by the

defense bar and by -- well, by the bar in general

as having legitimated plea bc*rgaining, then I think it's
not unreasonable to assume that Santobello had not had time
to take effect in North Carolina, and that these plea bargains
were not normally made a part of the record.

26
I would further point out that the only record
of this matter, the state of the record now, is simply this
sheet of paper, and that that is simply not an adequate
compliance with the requirement, not necessarily of Town send
v. Sain but also of the congressional requirement that there
exist an adequate record to permit review,
QUESTION:

Go back to the question 1 put to your

friend —
MR, GOLDSMITHS
QUESTION;

Yes, sir,

— for the state: in a civil case, x

not a habeas corpus civil case but any kind of a civil
case, which has been tried, has gone to judgment, whether
by a jury or the judge as the sole fact finder, and the
losing party comes in with a motion for a new trial on the
grounds of newly discovered evidence.

Would it be

appropriate for the District Judge to require the moving
party

seeking a new trial on these grounds to state what,

that newly discovered evidence is before he determines
he's going to go — whether the judge is going to proceed
with it?

»
MR, GOLDSMITH:

X certainly agree that he would

be entitled to do that,
QUESTION:

Now, I take it that your friend was

analogizing that situation tc this; whether it is or not,
you may disagree.

Where do you think the analogy

is faulty?

27
MR. GOLDSMITH ?

I think the analogy is misplaced

primarily in the fact that in the situation posed by your
Honor, there has already been a trial on the merits.

There

has been — I’ll bite at the apple — an opportunity to
offer proof.
QUESTION:

Has there not been a determination —

a determination as distinguished from a trial —■

on the

merits on the submission of the guilty plea?
MR. GOLDSMITH?

1 would argue not, that this —

the only thing that could be
QUESTION':

How could the judge accept the guilty

plea if ha didn’t make a determination on the merits of the
plea?
MR. GOLDSMITH:

Well, I think the judge makes the

determination generally that it’s a voluntary plea.
QUESTION:

You’re speaking now of course of the

state court judge.

I

MR. GOLDSMITH? Yes, sir, I am speaking of the
••
state court judge. But I would submit that under this priorprocedure , unlike current procedure, the state judge does
not make any determination, or even any inquiry, into the
existence of a plea bargain or not.

And that is the hearing

which under 2254, the federal habeas corpus statute, that
is the claim that must be determined in state court at. some
point if a hearing in federal habeas corpus is to be avoided.

28

And there's been no such hearing in any state court, or in
federal District Court.
The criteria established by Townsend v. Sain
incorporated into the statute by Congress have not been met.
There's bean no full and fair hearing pursuant to an adequate
fact finding procedure that -found the material facts and
determined the issues tendered by the defendant.
To say that at the arraignment itself the Cotirfc
did all those things I think would be to stretch unrealistically
the purpose of the arraignment procedure under form North
Carolina law.
And so we submit that Townsend, far from being
authority for the position of the petitioner in this case,
is authority for our position, particularly insofar as it
has been incorporated into a statute.
QUESTION;

What, if any, impact does the new

North Carolina have on this case?
MR. GOLDSMITH;

On this particular case it has
o*

none, I would say, your Honor.

On the issue presented by

this case, I would submit that it has a great deal of
potential impact.

Because if, as this Court

has previously

said, if there is a flushing out of these claims at the
trial level, and an attempt made to resolve them there, to
the extent that that is successful, there should be fewer
of these claims arising on appeal later on.

29

But as to Allison's own facts, of course, that
occurred prior to this change.

And I would submit that he is

entitled to a hearing,
I think the real issue here is whether the North
Carolina procedure embodied in this particular question
is a full satisfaction of the* requirement that there be
an adequate state court determination.

And we would submit

that that is not the case,
QUESTION:

But you say it’s just a special

situation in this particular case and cases like them?

Or

could today there be an adequate inquiry at the time of
accepting the plea so that there would be no need for a
hearing whan a later habeas corpus is brought?
MR, GOLDSMITH:

I would say that today there

would be certainly a fuller inquiry under the North Carolina
procedure,
QUESTION:

No, that isn't what I asked you,

I

/

just asked you, can you make the kind of an inquiry and
have the kind of determination at the time of accepting the
plea that would insulate, the plea against a habeas corpus
attack?
MR, GOLDSMITH:
Honor,

I don't believes you can, your

I believe that no matter what, the fullness of the

inquiry
QUESTION:

Well, then, are you expanding the

Townsend test for when you get a hearing?

QUESTION;
law.

Correct.

Unless there’s been some mistake of

Isn’t that right?
MR. GOLDSMITH;

That’s correct» your Honor.

I think there are several problems to Townsend.
One is that there be an adequate fact finding procedure.
QUESTION;

Yes, yes.

MR. GOLDSMITH;

This reform would take care of

that element of Townsend,
QUESTIONs

Yes f yes.

MR. GOLDSMITH;

But there also in Townsend is

a requirement that the issue tendered by the defendant
actually had been determined in the state court.
QUESTION;

Well, the judge determines.

He

tells the defendant, here are the issues, voluntariness, and
whether there’s a basis ir>. fact for your plea.

No, if you've

had any plea bargains, we want to knew it now,

And if

there haven’t, I want you to tell me there haven't.

It gives

him every opportunity to make any kind of a claim that he
wants to claim.

And they hear everything he’s got to say.

Now» what’s inadequate about that?

Well, I submit that would be a

harder case, if that had happened, >to develop his case.
QUESTIONs

Well, that's what I'm asking you about.

MR. GOLDSMITHS
QUESTION'S

I understand that.

I just want to know.what your basis,

what your position is.
MR. GOLDSMITHS

My only position — Mr. Justice

White, my only position is that there ought to always be a
continuing availability of a mechanism for relief, which is
what the Court said in Kaufman v. United States.
QUESTION:

Well, so you would like to put a

number five on Townsend v. Sain, or seven or eight, another
situation in which a hearing would be required?
MR. GOLDSMITH!

1* think what I would prefer is

that there be such a mechanism, because I think there are
situations conceivably
QUESTION:

Well, aren't you going •— in taking

this position, aren’t you going beyond Sain?
/

MR. GOLDSMITH:
right.

Yes, sir, I think that’s probably

I think it could ba viewed that way.

Of course, we

also have the congressional statute in addition to Townsend
v. Sain.

I don’t know whether I’m going beyond the statute

or not, and it’s speculative on this case.
QUESTION:
Sain?

Oh, you think the statute goes beyond

32
MR, GOLDSMITH s

It dossil3t — I think it incorporates

most of the criteria of Sain,
some respects,

If does go beyond it in

I just simply think that there are situations

where a defendant might be able to show that he was, in fact,
coerced into entering his plea despite such an inquiry.

And

if he can show that —- and I think that would be a much
harder burden to show — and perhaps then a District Court
judge would be justified in requiring him to furnish some
additional proof.
QUESTION s

You say this case is different in any

event —
MR. GOLDSMITH;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

— because at the time everybody had

the notion that you shouldn’t confess to plea bargains in
open court?
MR. GOLDSMITH;

That’s correct, your Honor.

I

believe that to be the fact, and I think that’s been demon­
strated by some empirical studies to have been the fact at
that time,
QUESTION;

Mr. Goldsmith, can I just ask one

question analogizing this to normal civil cases?
Did the state file anything comparable to a
motion for summary judgment supported by any affidavit in this
case, denying a plea bargain?
MR. GOLDSMITH;

NO, your Honor, I would submit

33

they did not.

They verified their answer to the habeas

corpus petition.

But it i*?as verified simply by the attorney

representing the state in that matter.

There was no affidavit

by the prosecuting attorney in the trial court or the defense
attorney or any other witness that knew anything about the
facts in this particular matter.

There was no motion made

for summary judgment.
And 1 would submit that on the issue of affidavits
that, in any event, it's improper to resolve what's essentially
a question of credibility on the submission of affidavits.
That's why we
QUESTION:

But by filing an affidavit, the state

could have put the burden on the plaintiff to come forward
with a countervailing affidavit.
MR. GOLDSMITH:
that could have been done.

Yes, sir.

In a normal situation,

I think the Fourth Circuit found

**- and we submit that it's correct to find -- that to put
that burden on an indigent prisoner confined in the prison
unit apart from his codefendant from whan he seeks the
affidavit is an unrealistic burden.
QUESTIONs

Well, I don't think the fact of

indigency would make any difference if the state had filed
its own affidavit, which would require response in the
normal summary judgment procedure.

But as I understand it,

the wrinkle here is that the state didn't file a motion for

34

summary.

They rather said that yon6ve got to deny in

advance, which is, of course
MR, GOLDSMITH;
QUESTION:

— an unusual practice.

MR. GGLDSMITH:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, your Honor.

It is unusual.

But you would not question the fact

that if the state had filed an appropriate motion for
summary judgment supported by appropriate affidavits, then
your client would have had the burden of coming forward with
an affidavit, even though indigent and difficult and all the
rest of it?
MR, GOLDSMITH:

Yes, your honos:, although I submit

that his own affidavit would have been sufficient to rebut -to raise the issue of material fact sufficient to rebut a
summary judgment.

I don't think it would be proper to

require him to get an affidavit from a possibly hostile
witness in another prison unit upon penalty of having his
claim dismissed.
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR, GOLDSMITH:

Well, simply because in a normal

setting of a plaintiff in summary judgment procedure his own
affidavit is sufficient.
QUESTION:

No, but he’s in the position of

contradicting a statement he made in open court to a judge
in response to a very relevant question which comas about

35
as close to perjury on his present situation as you can come
without having perjury.
MR. GOLDSMITHz

Yes, sir, I'll admit, it coraes

close to perjury, yes, sir.
unrealistic requirement.
QUESTION:

I simply submit that it's an

This codefendant —

Why unrealistic?

MR. GOLDSMITH:

Well, because this codefendant

is the one who had changed his plea originally to induce
Allison to plead guilty.

There's evidence in the file

from letters from Allison and so on that the codefendant
was very reluctant to make any statement at all because he
was trying to get work release privileges and other benefits
in the penal system, and he feared he may be*penalized for
that. „
I think it's simply unrealistic forthe magistrate
to have assumed that their interests were identical, and that
this would be a willing witness who would willingly furnish
an affidavit for the plaintiff in this case, the petitioner.
QUESTIONS

Well, he's going to have to furnish

something some day if you prevail in this case, isn't he?
MR. GOLDSMITH;

He certainly is, and of course

compulsory process is available to require him to come into
court and be examined under oath and cross-examined by the
state,
resolved

We feel that's the way this matter ought to be

36
QUESTION3

Taking the statutes, the federal

statute, on its literal meaning, would you say that on
the face of the record — bearing in mind the implications
of those terms — on the face of the record, it conclusively
appeared that the petitioner was entitled to no relief?
MR. GOLDSMITH;

Well, of course, your Honor,

that’s the standard for federal motions to vacate sentence
under 2255»
QUESTION;

That's why I emphasise, for the federal

MR. GOLDSMITH;

I would submit that in essence,

they are — they boil down tc the same standard.

And that

this record would not conclusively show that he’s entitled
to no relief for the same reasons that it’s not an adequate
state court determination on the merits of his claim.
To say that it's conclusive, and forbid any
further attempt by him to ever impeach it I think would
simply be an unrealistic position in light of the practicali­
ties of our plea taking procedure.
QUESTION;

Well, if the federal judge believed

what this gentleman had stated to the state court judge at
the sentencing plea, then it would conclusively appear on
the face of the record, would it not?
MR. GOLDSMITH;

If the word "promise" in the

context of this sentence were construed to have meant a
plea bargain, yes, it would.

Wa submit that it was not in™

37

tended that way* it was coupled

with threat* and that it

was not ever understood by any party to the proceeding to
contemplata the disclosure of plea bargains.
QUESTION ;

I take it you concede that if this had

been a federal case purely --- not state habeas corpus in a
federal court* or federal habeas corpus on a state case —
that the judge would have been justified in saying that on
the face of the record it conclusively appears he is entitled
to no relief* if the District Judge* in so doing* were relying
on the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing1?
MR. GOLDSMITH;

On these facts * presented by this

case* I would respectfully disagree.

I would say that were

this a federal prisoner* and this were the only question
that were asked him at the Rule 11 proceeding, that that would
not conclusively establish that no plea bargain had been made.
And there are* I think* federal cases — I know — federal
cases cited in the briefs for both sides supporting that
proposition.

Just as Machibroda was able to bring his

allegation despite its incredibility* so we submit that any
federal prisoner who’s simply asked whether any promises
or threats were made to influence you to plead guilty is
not thereby precluded from ever asserting that there was a
plea bargain* and under the cover plea bargain.
QUESTION;

What, else should the federal District

judge at sentencing proceeding do* what should he ask* to

38
comply with Rule 11, which you say this record would not
meet Rule 11 standards?
>

MR. GOLDSMITKs
has been amended in 1975.

It would not.

Rule 11, of course,

And now, I think, inquiry is

made, specifically in the Fourth Circuit, the Third Circuit,
the Fifth Circuit, by direction of those circuits.

Federal

District judges are specifically required to inquire into the
matter of plea bargaining, much as the North Carolina statute
now requires that inquiry to be made.
In addition, the new federal Rule 11 requires that
pleading negotiations be disclosed in. open court to the
judge —he can accept or reject them ~ and that they be
spread on the record.

Arid I think that that is a very

t

salutary development, and to the extent that that’s followed
H'

in federal courts and in states like North Carolina that
have their own procedure, these claims shouldn’t arise any
more.

I think it's unlikely that they will.
As I said in response to Mr. Justice White's

could be heard if they did arise.

Would it also subject the lawyer?

MR. GOLDSMITH:

I suppose it would — certainly

if it subjected him to anything, it

ought to subject the

lawyer to the carae penalty.
QUESTION:

Depending on the court's determination,

he might subject the lawyer to some disciplinary proceeding
if he found one way —
MR. GOLDSMITH:

Yes, sir.

41
QUESTION :

if he found the other way he could

subject Allison to some —
MR. GOLDSMITHS
QUESTION:

— sanction.

MR. GOLDSMITH:

In fact, I think in McAleney v»

United States in the First, Circuit the court did instruct,
or strongly suggest, that disciplinary proceedings be
instituted in just such a case against the attorney.
QUESTION:

Just focusing on the lawyer for a

moment, would you tell me, with respect to the practice
that prevailed at the time of this plea, and also with
respect to the practice in North Carolina today, was it
than or is it now customary to make any inquiry of counsel
for the prosecution or counsel for the defense as to
whether there was a plea bargain?
MR. GOLDSMITH:

It is not; it was not then.

The new plea transcript form requires the attorney
to sign and to make a statement that he thinks that the
plea is voluntary himself.

It's not nearly as detailed a

disclosure as that required by the defendant personally.
There is no — usually, no colloquy between the court and
the defense counsel.

It’s simply a case of the defense

counsel signing the statement.
The practice, however, varies.

Some judges may

inquire of counsel whether there is any plea bargain.

And

42
normally when that question is reached on today*s form,
whether there have been any plea negotiations, it's counsel
who speaks.
QUESTION;

And at the time of this plea, counsel

didn’t sign the form, did he?
MR. GOLDSMITH;

It was just signed by the --

That's right, your Honor.

Just

the defendant and the judge.
QUESTION;

And is the form — was the form at

that time customarily executed and filled out in open court
or in the clerk's office?
MR. GOLDSMITH:

How was it handled?
It was customarily done in open

court.
QUESTION;

It was?

MR. GOLDSMITH;
court varied.

The manner for doing it in open

Sometimes the defense counsel would sit by

tha defendant and write the answers into the blanks.
Sometimes the clerk of court would write the answers into
tha blanks.

Very rarely, if ever, did the defendant actually

write the answers.

But his oral answers would be put down
/

in the appropriate blanks.
QUESTION:

It was done in open court.

Without any representation by counsel

as to the existence or non-existence of a plea bargain?
MR. GOLDSMITH;
QUESTION;
occurred?

That's correct.

But counsel was present when this

43
MR. GOLDSMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Defense counsel.

MR. GOLDSMITH:

In this particular case, yes, sir.

And any time that the client was represented, of course
he would be present.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. GOLDSMITH:

The problem here, I think, is

that there is no record apart from this form.

We don’t have

the verbatim transcript, if one was made, of the plea
proceeding.

So we don’t know what else might have been said

by anyone at the proceeding.

We have absolutely no record

of what happened at the sentencing three days later.

And

it’s conceivable that the defendant may have raised some
objection then.

And that’s, we submit, properly brought out

— should be properly brought out as relating to his credib ility at a hearing, an evidentiary hearing.
But I submit that the state of the record presently
is simply insufficient to ascertain that that was determined

i

irrevocably that there would be no plea bargain.
/

1 think one other fact that I want to call the
Court's attention that I did not cite in my brief, and that
is the official commentary to the North Carolina General
Statutes; the statutes themselves are set out in my brief.
The amendment to Chapter 15A of the North Carolina
Criminal Procedure Act, which required an open court disclosure

44
plsa bargain.

I think it's significant to note the official

commentary which is reprinted with those statutes.

And that

is , the purpose of this statute was to legitimate plea
negotiations and, quote, to bring plea negotiations out of
the back room.

And further on, the writers of the official

commentary say that the purpose is now intended to allow the
defendant to tell the truth in plea proceedings, implying
that perhaps in former times the defendant was not always
expected to tell the truth in response to that type of question
in plea proceedings.
The same type of comments, I think, are found
in the amendments to Rule 11(e) of the federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure.

I think it simply points out that this is

a new day, this is taking pleas out of the dark ages, and
that this plea arose in the dark ages of plea bargaining
when these things were not brought out in open court, and
cere not explicitly recognised as being constitutionally sound.
If it please the Court, we submit that unless
this Court can honestly say that this procedure was a
full and fair hearing in fulfillment of the requirement in
Townsend. ■/.. Sain, then it’s bound to affirm the Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeals.

Arid it must bs kept in mind that

the only relief sought is a hearing at which witnesses who
haven't

previously testified will be able to be heard.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

We Ml resume there at

Is00 o'clock.

At that time you can decide if you wish

whether you want to use the four minutes remaining to you.
MR. GOLDSMITH;

Thank you, your Honor.

[Whereupon, the Court recessed until 1:00 o'clock,
p .rn. ]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You may continue,

counsel.
MR. GOLDSMITH;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

If it please the Court, I would like to take just
a moment to explore the suggestion made that affidavits
would be appropriate in this kind of case if the appropriate
procedure were followed, that is, a motion for summary judg­
ment. .
I vrould hope that the Court would not restrict
those claim sthat may be heard in federal habeas corpus
to those cases where the plea bargain is witnessed by some
outside party.

I think that th© hypothetical situation

.1
posed by Mr. Justice Marshall is appropriate, it's
appropriate to ask that question.

If Allison had not been

so fortunate as to have his bargain witnessed by his co-defen
danfc, then it

to me thr-t it would be inappropriate to

try to resolve his claim on a basis of requiring him to
submit further evidence of his claim, and that affidavits
don't go very far toward resolving that type of issue where
it does resolve on credibility.

46
QUESTION s

I got some intimation from what you

said that the gentleman from whom he hoped to get these
statements is now in prison somewhere, and it might be
difficult for him to get an affidavit, but that he could
be compelled to testify*
MR. GOLDSMITHS
QUESTIONs

That’s exactly right, your honor*

That’s what you’re standing on, is it?

MR* GOLDSMITH %

That’s what I’m standing on.

And

I’m stating further that it would be inappropriate to
fashion a general requirement of other evidence of the claim,
because there are situations where maybe only the attorney
and his client discussed the plea.
QUESTION:

They may have to take his deposition

in prison if you prevail in this case in any event.
MR. GOLDSMITH:

Yes, sir, they may.

be called to testify at a hearing*

Or he may

I think that would be

an option of the District Court judge.

But I think soma

compulsory process must exist for obtaining his testimony
and subjecting him to cross-examination by both parties.
QUESTION:

Was there any explanation in the

record, counsel, for the absence of any affidavit from either
attorney?
MR. GOLDSMITH:

The only explanation, your Honor,

that I can offer is that the case didn’t progress far enough
to obtain such evidence.

I think,

'

in any event, had an

47
affidavit been obtained , that might not have resolved the
issue either.

Because if the affidavit from the defense counsel,,

for instance, denied any suggestion of a plea bargain, there
still remains the question of credibility.

And I don't

think we can be so cynical, as I said in my brief,

to

suppose that every time there's a contradiction between the
client and his lawyer, that the lawyer is invariably right.
It's a question, I think, that has to be resolved
by the trier of fact in an evidentiary hearing where
credibility can be tested.

But no one, to date, has

approached, as far as I know, either the defense lawyer or
the prosecator or any other party to the case to ascertain
what their version of the facts is.

QUESTION %

Your position really is, that an

expanded or a full employment of a Rule 11, federal Rule 11,
approach will wash this kind of problem out.
MR. GOLDSMITH:

I think it will far toward

washing the problem out, in that the claims won't be made
in the first instance, because they'll be flushed out.

And

if made, there would be very — the burden would be hard to
sustain, I think, as to why someone ought to be heard to
contradict his earlier statement after full inquiry.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr.

Goldsmith.
MR. GOLDSMITH:

Thank you, your Honor.

48

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You have anything

further, Mr, League?
MR, LEAGUE?

Yes, sir, I would make a couple of

comments in rebuttal, if I might,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD Ni LEAGUE, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, LEAGUES

With regard to the new procedure, the

expanded inquiry, I can speak of personal knowledge as to
whether or not that has stayed the post-conviction applications
on the basis of this type of claim.

It has not.

Maybe it

has made them somewhat easier to deal with, but that’s
speculative too, at this time.
With regard to the question Mr, Justice Stevens
posed about the absence of an affidavit from the attorney
or from the district attorney in this case, at the time
these cases — or this case came through, the case was
handled to the extent it needed to be handled.

Except in the

Charlotte division of the Western District, the matters were
routinely dismissed on the basis of a showing by the state
that this transcript of plea had been gone into -- or, rather,
the inquiries made in the transcript had gone into, and the
man had said that no promises were made for him.
To be candid, it wasn't expressed, the dismissals
weren't expressed in terms of taking a state court finding.
I think they were expressed more in terms of being belied

I would be here today, the case would be handled quite a
bit differently.
With regard to the matter of the form that was
used, the fact that it had no place to include on it any
promises that had been made, of course that form was not
a maximum inquiry.

That form was a minimum inquiry.

see on forms coming through attached to writs sometimes a
question which dictates that more questions were asked by
the judge.

that’s good enough to get his plea overturned if it’s
between him and his attorney; that it’s not for stata action.
QUESTIONS

Yes, but what if he alleged that his

lawyer had advised him — ha alleged that the lawyer advised
me as follows, and it turns out that that’s wholly false
legal advice, and that no competent attorney would give
that advice?

And the petitioner for habeas corpus makes

these allegations, and claims that there*s a counsel claim,
that he was not represented by competent counsel.

QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. LEAGUE:

With regard to the fact that threats

or premises are linked together, I don't think that that
is something that should have such a sinister cast as Mr.
Goldsmith suggests.

In the new form they're still linked

together: other than the promises above, has anyone made
any threats or promises to you.

I think originally they

were joined because they had the same propensity for wrong.
i

There are some, things that a man might be considered — or
that a man might consider a threat or a promise that would
be incorrect and couldn't be done legally.

There would be

some things he'd consider a threat or a promise which would
be permissible legally.

Typically, he might feel threatened

that the state was going to indict him.

He might feel

coerced because his people came around and tries to talk
him into pleading guilty.

There's nothing wrong with these.

Yet a map could conceive of them as a threat.
And I think it's because of the possibility that
both of these things have the same possibilities for affecting
a plea that they were joined together.
With regard to plea bargaining and its non-disclo­

state.

As far as judges not liking it; that varied from

And again, that's a good reason why you

should leave it to the discretion of the District Court.

That would be my remarks in rebuttal.

Thank you

so much.
