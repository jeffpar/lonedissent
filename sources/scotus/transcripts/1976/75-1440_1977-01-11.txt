MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Walsh, I think you may proceed when you are
ready„
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND C. WALSH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR, WALSH:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The facts in this cas@--.in this case the plaintiffs
challenge Connecticut's Medicaid policy on payment for
abortion under the Titi® XIX Medicaid program, the same as in
the previous case.

The challenge was made on both statutory

and constitutional grounds.
The Connecticut policy, which is Section 275 of the
Welfare Department Manual, provided that in order for the state
to pay for ;m abortion under the Title XIX program, the
patient's attending physician, the physician of her own choice,
was required to submit a certificate of medical necessity,
which is set forth at page 47 of the appendix,
Q

Does it differ much from a Permsy.lva.nia require­

ment?
MR, WALSH:

The attending physician merely has t©

state that in his opinion the abortion is medically necessary
for the patient's health.

That is all.

And that is not

4
challenged*
Q

No, but is that much different from the one

we have just been discussing in Pennsylvania?
MR. WALSH:

I think it is even more liberal, Your

Honor.
In addition to that certificate of medical necessity,
the doctor must also submit a form W-601, which is at page 45
of the appendix, requesting prior approval for payment for
the abortion.

And in that form he must indicate what the

medical need for the abortion is.

As 1 just stated a moment

ago, in answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question, the
attending physician’s medical judgment as to the need for the
abortion is never questioned by Connecticut.
Q

I suppose there are provisions to detect and

imply sanctions against fraud on the part of physicians under
the Medicaid program, not only in this area but throughout
the program, I think.
MR. WALSH:

There are, Your Honor.

But if the

current press is correct, the country is quit© remiss in that
area, at the present time.

It is a difficult program to

police.
Q

I can understand why it would be.

But that

program would be applicable here as ?ell as applicable in
other parts of Medicaid, would it not?
MR. WALSH:

Yes, Your Honor.

5

Q

If they found a physician was consistently

lying-MR. WALSH:
Q

In this particular area-—

--getting public funds that nobody v/as entitled

tOc
MR. WALSH:
fraudulent.
Q

There is no question.

That would be

And the stats does have a quality control system.
So, t© that extent,. I suppose, his certificate

is subject to question, is it not?
MR. WALSH:
subject to question.

Yes.

Theoretically the veracity is

But I think under Ro® v. Wade the

appropriate disciplinary action in this ©vent might be through
the professional societies because of th© sensitivity of this
particular medical service.
Q

If a physician ware consistently prescribing

drugs that were not needed, not medically necessary, just in
order to get public monies that neither he nor the patient
were entitled to, would he not be subject to sanctions?
MR. WALSH:

He would, Your Honor, and I believe that

at a certain point he would no longer be accepted for
participation in the Title XIX program.
The plaintiffs then brought this action after the
refusal--fch® two original plaintiffs.

Their physicians would

not submit the statement of medical necessity.

There were

several subsequent intervening plaintiffs for which temporary

6
restraining orders were granted.

But in no case did the

attending physician submit the certificate of medical
necessity.

And this action was then brought, challenging the

state policy on both statutory and constitutional grounds.
The single-judge District Court,

on the plaintiffs'

motion for a summary judgment, disposed of the case initially
on the pendant statutory claim, holding that the Federal
Title XIX statute required payment for elective abortion.
The defendant commissioner then appealed, and the
Second Circuit reversed and remanded, holding in effect that
while Title XIX permits payment for abortion, it does not
require payment for elective abortion.

And one judge, Judge

Mulligan of the Second Circuit, dissented in part from that
decision.
The Second Circuit Court, when it remanded, instructed
th® District Court to determine if Connecticut would continue
to refuse to pay for elective abortion since the Second
Circuit had now decided that it was permissible to pay for
elective abortions.

The state's? position originally had b@©n

that the Federal statute prevented payment.

The stats informed

th© court that it elected not to change its policy, that it
would not pay for elective abortion.
Then one® again a three-judge court, was convened
and one® again on the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment,
th© three-judge court, after oral argument, held that

7
Connecticut's medical abortion policy was invalid in so far
as it required certification that an abortion is medically
or psychiatrically necessary and in so far as it requires
prior to the performance of an abort:.on any form of approval
or consent or any other condition or requirement for the
reimbursement of the expenses of an abortion performed during
the first trimester of the pregnancy.

This case was limited

to first trimester abortions by the three-judge court since
there were not second semes'ter abortions performed.
There is a second semester abortion form in the
appendix at page 46 or 47, 1 believe,, which is a little
different, but it apparently is not at issue her©»
Prior to the entry of that judgment by the threejudge court, the defendant commissioner had made a motion to
strike certain affidavits which had been attached to the
plaintiff's memorandum in support of its motion for summary
judgment.

And at the oral argument the defendant requested

the court to rule on the motion to strike, and the three-judge
court said it would rule on that motion, but it never did so.
In striking down Connecticut's Medicaid policy, the
District Court held essentially that the Constitution does not
require the state to pay for any medical services.

But,

nevertheless, one© a state chooses to establish a program to
pay for the medical expenses of the indigent and as part, of
that program it pays for therapeutic abortions and it pays for

8

pregnancy, child birth, prenatal and postnatal care, but it
does not pay for elective abortions, then in that event, the
three-judge court held, the state was not acting strictly
neutral and so it was infringing thereby on the plaintiff’s
constitutionally elected . right to have an abortion, as
announced in Roe v. Wade.

And it cited Dunn v. Blumstein in

support of its decision, and Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa
County

and Shapiro v. Thompson, the residency case.
Q

Do you understand the District Court’s judgment,

to have been based upon the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment ©r upon something else in the Fourteenth
Amendment?
MR. WALSH:

It is not absolutely clear, Your Honor.

My argument will be that it was upon the Equal Protection
But thex*@ is this bit about infringing on the right

Argument.

to am abortion which conceivably could be based upon another
amendment.
Q

Or another part of that same amendment.

MR. WALSH:
Q

Another part of the same amendment.

Do you think it was both, then?

MR. WALSH:

I think it may well hav® been both. Your

Honor.
Q

So, a little bit. like the Shapiro case in this

Court, which also I think involved your state?
MR. WALSH:

Yes, Your Honor, the Shapiro case always

9
comes up in any discussion of this case.
We believe that the fallacy of the District Court*s
reasoning in this case was that Connecticut has no program
for funding the medical expenses of pregnancy as such or
prenatal or postnatal car®.

What it does have is a program to
/

pay for medical expenses which are medically necessary for
the patient’s health.

That is the fc;sfc, whether it is

necessary for the patient's health.
for.

If it is, it will be paid

If it is not, they will be excluded, except for some

medically necessary services which are excluded because of
their prohibitive cost.
Dental expenses, particularly periodontia and
orthodontia are two that are very costly that are excluded,
although they are medically necessary for the patient's
health.
Under Connecticut's program, pregnancy and abortion
are treated alike.

They must both be medically necessary for

the patient's health in order to be paid for under the program.
I think that the plaintiff's make much of the fact that if
you pay for the expenses of pregnancy, you should pay for
abortion.

But it is the medical community that has determined'

really that the expenses of childbirth are medically
\
\

necessary, and there was no medical testimony—and indeed th@ :
plaintiffs have admitted in their brisf that the expenses of
childbirth and pregnancy are medicali/ necessary to the

•

10

patient’s health.»

That test of medical necessity has been

Connecticut’s test since the inception of its program in 1965»
That was nearly eight years before this Court announced the
constitutionally protected right of a woman, in consultation
with her physician, to choose to have an abortion, in Roe v.
Wade.
The District Court did not dispute that this test
of medical necessity for the patient’s health was the test
for

payment under Connecticut’s program.

A lower court

simply refused to judge whether this classification

offended

the Equal Protection Clause, and instead the lower court
set forth its own proceed classification by narrowly focusing
on how elective abortion was treated as compared to pregnancy.
Th© lower court, we believe, thereby lost sight of the fact
that the test for payment was whether the service was medically
necessary for the patient's health.

And the whole purpose

of th® program was to provide necessary health care, and thatpregnancy or abortion or whatever were merely incidental
treatments under the program of providing necessary health
care.
We think there would be validity to the District
Court's opinion if Connecticut had done either one of
things:

two

If Connecticut had a separate program just for payment

of expenses of childbirth and pregnancy, or if abortions which
were admittedly medically necessary for the patient's health

11
wore excluded from Connecticut's program, which they are not.
In either of those events, we believe that the rationale of
the District Court would be valid.

But Connecticut has no

such programs and"it has never had such programs.
Q

Do you think that Connecticut could exclude the

expenses of childbirth either under -the statute or constitu­
tionally?
MR. WALSH:

I believe they could.

According to

HEW1s amicus brief that was submitted to the Second Circuit on
the statutory question, Your Honor, HEW says that the states
have very broad latitude.
Q

Including paying for childbirth?

MR. WALSH:
Q
HEW?

Yes, Your Honor, I believe so»

Do we have an amicus brief in this case from

W@ had one in the case that was just argued.

We do not,

do we?
MR. WALSH:

No, Your Honor, we do not.

Q

I wanted to be sure I was not missing anything.

Q

Mr. Walsh, if wa analyze the case as an Equal

Protection case for a moment, the three-judge District Court
seemed to say that whether it is a compelling state interest
or a rational basis test, Connecticut has not advanced any state
interest whatsoever for discriminating between pregnant women
who elect an abortion as opposed to pregnant women who elect
to bear the child.

They say the fiscal interest cuts the other

12
way and that, there is no other interest involved.

Do you rely

on any state interest for that, this die, and if so, what?
MR.. WALSH:

First of all, Your Honor, we rely very

heavily on ‘the fiscal interest because we think it is a very
important interest to the state to be able to control its
medical expenditures in the public health field.

But what we

are also afraid of is that the District Court's order forces
Connecticut to include a service in the state's program which
is admittedly noi; medically necessary fox" the patient's health,
and I say admittedly because the determination is left to the
patient's own attending physician.
Q

Let me just take the two parts to your answer.

First, on the fiscal point, if a trial should establish and
there*, should be findings of facfc“-tho District Court just
stated the concluslon--that it actually would save the state
money because it would eliminate certain welfare costs and
eliminate the expense of childbirth for people in -this
category to alio»; the abortions, would that not be a complete
answer to your f:.scal argument?
MR. WALSH:

No, Your Honor.

That would be, in. my

judgment, an indication that the state legislature or, in
this case, the administrative agency was guilty of enacting
foolish legislation.

That would be a challenge to the wisdom

of the legislation because it is somewhat speculative, although
i. think it probably is true, that by not granting electiv©

13
abortions, the state will eventually pay more for these
people, to the raising of these children, who may end up on
welfare.

But that is somewhat speculative.
But that is a decision, in our view, that is up to

the Xegislat ure or by its delegation to the administrative
agency because w® think it is a perfectly rational basis for
the state to set up a program whose purpose is to provide
necessary health care.

And that implies that it will exclude

unnecessary health care.
An elective abortion, as Judge Mulligan said in his
dissenting opinion in the Second Circuit, is really—starkly
put—unnecessary medical care.

That determination is not.

made by the state; it is made by the patient's attending
physician.

Because if it is necessary, all he has to do is

sign the certificate and the abortion will be paid for.
Q

What you are saying, let me just see if I can

it in my own language because I am not quite sura I have it.
But you ar© saying the state could rationally establish a
program that differentiated between necessary and unnecessary
medical care.

Having established such a program, this

distinction just falls into place.
MR. WALSH:
Q

That is what you are saying?

That is correct, Your Honor, yes.

And some of the categories might be wise and some

might be unwise, but you say the legislature has a. right to
make its own mistakes.

14
MR. WALSH;

Yes, indeed, Your Honor»

The other part, of the answer I was going to say was
that when a state is compelled to include a non-necessary
medical service in its program and at the same time because of
fiscal necessity must exclude services like orthodontia and
periodontia—and we have two cases right now in Connecticut
challenging the Federal statute for excluding those things—■
we think that it will be almost impossible to defend those
cases once an unnecessary medical service has been included in
the program.
Q

Mr. Walsh, what other medical service do you

have to file all of these explanations?
MR. WALSH;

I think, Your Honor, they are all listed

on page 2 of appellees' brief in a footnote.

They are

reasons, X believe-—dental services, except for emergency
dental services; chiropractic services, I believe; psychiatric
services; physical therapy.
Honor.

There is 19 all together, Your

There is a great many.
Q

Is chiropractic medical?

MR. WALSH;

HEW has amended -this statuto some time

ago to—
Q

X am not talking about HEW.

I am talking about

Connecticut.

MR. WALSH;

Connecticut attempted to cut back its

15
medical-Q

You do admit that you do put special emphasis

on abortions.
MR. WALSH:
Q

No, prior—

You put a little more than you do on

appendectomies.
MR. WALSH:

Yes, Your Honor.

But the reason for

that-Q

That is what I want to know.

MR. WALSII:

One of the reasons for the seeking of

prior approval is that if it were not done that way, the
hospital would not know whether they were going to receive
payment for the treatment until after they had submitted their
request for payment to the state.

That ±3 one of the

administrative reasons for the prior approval.
Q

Mr. Walsh, I suppose there may be larger

concerns on both sides surrounding the question of abortion
than there are to the question of appendectomy or orthodontia.
In defending your statute against a strictly Equal Protection
attack, do you think the state can make any argument that at
least it can advance as a rational consideration a policy to
prefer births to abortions?
MR. WALSH:

As I said earlier, Your Honor, it does

not prefer births to abortions.

That only comes about

incidentally as these services are either medically or not

16
medically necessary.

When the program was established, its

purpose was to provide medically necessary health care, and
it really is up to the medical community and the individual
physician to determine whether the given service is or is not
medically necessary.

And so it is not really that the state

is consciously favoring childbirth over abortion.

That is

the state of the medical art, that childbirth is universally
regarded as requiring necessary medical care, 1 believe,
whereas in abortion it is not the case because there are
several physicians in -this action that have submitted
affidavits distinguishing—
Q

What if in Connecticut, for soma reason or

other, 'the entire medical profession took the view that
abortions were very much to be preferred to births so that the
result was that even though women might not initially choose
that course, Connecticut's birthrate simply declined to zero.
Do you think that the state would have no interest in
legislating to prevent that result if the legislature chose
to do so?
MR. WALSH:
Q

Legislating to prevent--

Follow the birthrate to zero.

MR. WALSH:

I believe that they would have an

interest, yes, Your Honor.

That would be for the legislature

to determine, of course, 1 think.

But 1 think there would

. certainly b© a state interest to bo debated in the legislature

17
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Suppose it was in that

broad reach that you argue that the state legislature could
say, ,fWe will pay for cosmetic surgery in order fco make our
people more beautiful/' if they wanted to.

You can respond fco

that after lunch at Is00 o'clock,
MR, WALSIl:

Thank you,

[A luncheon recess was taken at 12:00 o’clock noon,]

18
AFTERNOON SESSION - 1:00 o'clock
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continue,

Mr. Walsh.
MR. WALSH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court:
As we were saying before luncheon, it is the state5s
contention that there is no invidious discrimination on the
basis of its classification of necessary versus unnecessary
medical expenses.

Therefore, there is no denial of equal

protection.
I believe, as Mr. Justice Stewart in a separate
opinion in Antonio v. Rodriguez summarised the puroose of the
Equal Protection Clause, it was to measure the validity of
the classifications made by fch© state.

This classification

withstands that validity, we believe,
Of course, the fact that there is no invidious
discrimination is not all.

Th© state; must of course prove

that Connecticut’s action is not a mere pretext

or a subter­

fuge or, as a counsel in a previous case stated, a smokescreen
for the state to discriminate against abortion.

There is no

evidence in the record to support such a charge.
The District Court rejected Connecticut’s purpose
of preserving its fiscal integrity out of hand, and

it

thereupon attributed to the State of Connecticut—it imputed
a reason.

It called it an unarticulated reason for avoiding

19

■the expenditure of public funds for
morally objectionable.

purpose the state found

There was nothing in the record to

support that, and that was imputed to the state despite the
fact that Connecticut's program included payment for no other
medical service which was not necessary for the patient's
health despite the fact that other medical services which were
medically necessary-some were excluded because of their
prohibitive costs.

And another factor is that the very day

after this decision was announced, December 31, 1975, the very
next day Connecticut was forced to implement cutbacks in its
Medicaid program of medically necessary services because of
its fiscal crisis.

As it turned out, that was preliminarily

enjoined about two weeks later, and that is the status of that
matter now,

The state has not pursued that.

The fiscal

picture has brightened somewhat.
So, all of these factors attest to the legitimacy
of th@ classification made by Connecticut’s program.

When

this is considered in addition to the fact that the medical
judgment of medical necessity is left soley to the attending
I

physician of the plaintiff's own choice and the further fact,
as indicated in the answers to the interrogatories that prior
the single-judge District Court’s entry of the first
injunction, some 1,410 abortions were performed

under the

state's program in an 11-1/2 month period.
So, w® feel that the imputation of the unarticulated

20
morally objectionable purpose was unfounded.

Q

Do you think it would be constitutionally

impermissible for part of the motivation, of the State of
Connecticut in tills case to be its moral objection?
MR. WALSH;

I think, Your Honor, that as long as

‘the Court is satisfied that the state has a valid purpose and
that its primary motive is not deceit or subterfuge, that the
Court should then uphold -the regulation because otherwise you
wonid get into an extremely nebulous area of trying to
ascertain subjective intentions of the legislature.
Q

Let us assume that all those problems of

proof have been surmounted and that it were established that
at least part of the purpose of Connecticut in denying public
funds for abortion on demand, or whatever you wish to call it,
/

were moral.

VTould that make Connecticut's action invalid,

in your view?
MR. WALSH:

I believe it would not, Your Honor,

unless to© Court established that was fch© overriding purpose.
I believe to© Chief Justice in a dissent in Eisensfcadt v. Baird
in which this Court had discredited Massachusett5s reasons
for not permitting sal® of contraceptives—the Chief Justice
said that in the absence of clear and convincing proof as to
motivation, then th© Court should not rule.

I think that

that, is what is the situation in this case.
Q

My question assumes that there has been clear

21

and convincing proof, and that it has been shown that part of
Connecticut's reason for doing this is moral objection to
abortion on demand.

Do you concede that would be constitu­

tionally impermissible for Connecticut to do?
MR. WALSH:
reason.

Ho, Your Honor, because I said part

I say if it is partly?

if it is a secondary reason—

because after all, all legislators and executives, for that
matter, have their private views on abortion, and that does
not mean that their private views tire necessarily implanted.
It is very difficult to determine what percentage of their
motivation is a factor in influencing their decisions.
Q

But yon do concede that if it were the

sole

reason, it would be constitutionally impermissible?
MR. WALSH:

I think if it were the hole reason,

Your Honor, that would certainly be a very -terrible thing.

I

believe there is an article in 79 Yale Law Journal by
Professor Ely who says, however, that his test is as long as
the state has power to do it, then the motivation should not
b® the factor because if the succeeding administration then
has a different view, why should not the classification stand?
Q

It carries out the same program but. for quite

a different reason.
MR. WALSH:
Q

That is right, Your Honor.

What would fos the constitutional basis, in your

view, for saying that if the Connecticut statute—the primary

22

reason for passing it, as Justice Stewart’s question, was
the moral objection to abortion, why would that make it
constitutionally invalid if there is not any other constitu­
tional objection to it?
MR. WALSH:

Of course, when you say Connecticut,

that is of course some three million citizens.

And I think

if in fact the Court is convinced that there is a valid fiscal
purpose for—
Q

But v?@ ar© assuming that there is no valid

fiscal purpose, that the State of Connecticut in its
legislature, in the legislative history of the bill, says,
"We will go as far as we have to under the Supreme Court's
decision and under the Constitution, and we will not
criminally punish any doctor who provides an abortion.

But

we morally object to abortions, and we will not go any
further than the Supreme Court requires us to go. and w®
think this is permissible.

We arcs going to limit abortion in

every way that w© constitutionally can."
MR. WALSK;

If I understand Your Honor's question,

if you say it is permissible, that, is the answer to the
question.

However, if the

sole motivation of tie state’s

leaders is to impose their own views on the populace, that is
not—
Q

Is that not the motivation of every single

legislative act that is ever passed by a legislature, to
i

23
impose the views of feh© legislature on the populace?
Q

Presumably representing the majority of the

populace when it does so*
MR. WALSH:

Yes, when it represents the majority,

except that there are certain constitutional protections
against the tyranny of the majority, which this Court has
often fought to preserve.
Q
trial.

We can analogize this, I suppose, to a jury

There is a constitutional right that every criminal

has to a jury trial.
to have a jury trial.

There is also a constitutional right not
I suppose this Court has held there

is a constitutional right of a woman to have an abortion, and
there is also, I presume, a constitutional right for her to
have a child.

But a state can certainly take the view that

it would absolutely disrupt its criminal justice system if
everybody had a jury ferial.

Could not a state legitimately

take the view that it would disrupt the public policy, the
welfare of its state, if nobody ever had a child, if every
pregnant woman had an abortion?
MR. WALSH:

Oh, I think, yes, that would be a

legitimate purpose because the state then would clearly have
an obligation, I think, to assure that it has a sufficient
number of citizens coming up, so to speak, to run its functions.
Q

And the legislature could take that, moral view,

could it not, legitimately?

24
MR. WALSH:
Q

I believe it could, Your Honor,, yes.

Miller v. California and related cases say

affirmatively by a majority of the Court that a. state has a
responsibility, an affirmative responsibility, for the moral
environment and atmosphere of a community in
MR. WALSH:

the state.

I believe that is correct, Your Honor,

yes.
Q

Does that not really answer Justice Rehnquist’s

question?
MR. WALSH:
Q

I believe it would, Your Honor.

But you are not urging it, are you?

MR. WALSH:

That was not my prime motivation.

I was,

maybe mistakenly, trying to be neutral in the question of the
morality of this case because that is a very inflammatory
issue.
Q

And it is not necessarily here.

MR. WALSH:

That is correct, Your Honor, it is not
%

her®, I do not believe.
Q

Except that the District Court did find that

that was on® of the motivating reasons why Connecticut did
what it did.

So, it is here, is it not?

MR. WALSH:

It is her®, Your Honor.

Q

Unless we say they ware just wrong factually.

Q

What evidence did the distinguished district

judge cite for this conclusion?

25
MR, WALSH;

Th® District Court cited no evidence

whatever because—
Q

What was his own opinion of the matter?

MR. WALSH;

The only evidence, if you could call it

that, Your Honor, was a newspaper clipping attached to the
plaintiff’s memorandum in support of her motion for summary
judgment, purporting to convey the views of the Governor of
the State of Connecticut on abortion, and we made & motion to
strike that.
Q

That was not admissible evidence.
Was your motion granted?

MR. WALSH;

The motion was never ruled on, although

the court said it would rule on it.
So, in summary, Your Honor, we believe that was is
involved here is not an interference by a state to a woman"s
right to an abortion.

The issue is rather the right to

receive public welfare benefits, and in that case we believe
this case should be controlled by the test enunciated in
Dandridge v. Williams.

And I would like to reserve any time

I have left. Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

I think you have consumed

your time, Mr. Walsh.
Mrs. Kate.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. LUCY V. KATZ
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MRS. KATZ;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

26

this Court:
I represent, the plaintiff-appellees in this
action.

This argument is being held today because the State

of Connecticut denies Medicaid assistance to women who choose
to terminate their pregnancies by abortion, while at the same
time it provide payment for any and all forms of obsetrical
care involved in fch© birth of a child.
We have a basic factual dispute with the state's
assertion that this is simply a requirement that is part
and parcel of the entire Medicaid program, and throughout my
argument I will refer to the reasons for that dispute.
We also disagree with his assertion that Connecticut
has a more liberal policy than this Court heard about in
Pennsylvania.

There is no requirement in Pennsylvania that

I know about that a doctor must specially certify that an
abortion is necessary for the health of the patient, nor is
there a requirement in that state that the state give prior
authorization for ©very abortion under Medicaid.

The state

is denying this assistance in a way which is directly contrary
to this Court's recognition that a woman has a fundamental
right, with her physician, to decide whether or not to bear
a child.

And, as I will show, the regulations main thrust is

to impose upon poor women the moral and religious opinions of
various state officials.

Connecticut has asserted no state

interest whatsoever which justifies this manipulation of a

27
public benefit program in favor of childbirth and against
abortion.
1 would like to preface my replies to the attorneygeneral by invoking the framework used by this Court in
considering the landmark case of Roe v. Wade.

That framework

noted that there are two facets to any consideration of state
action regarding abortion.

One is our awareness of the very

deep moral and religious and philosophical objections which
many persons hold regarding abortion.
The other facet, however, is that in resolving
these questions, wa must b@ guided by the Constitution, and
we must make an effort to £r©@ ourselves of the ©motions and
prejudices of the past.

And the state, in particular, is

obligated to act free of such prejudices.
Q

Is this an Equal Protection case, in your view?

MRS. KATZ:

I see this case as rather heavily a

due process case because of the fundamental right asserted •
and as well an Equal Protection case.

And the class under the

Equal Protection standard is made up of persons who ace
assarting their fundamental right to make th© abortion choice.
Q

If it is a Du® Process case, do we have to pay

any attention to th© question'of whether benefits are provided
in th© event that th© child is born?

In Du® Process terms,

would your case be just as strong-”! am inclined to think it
would—even if the state had no welfare program at all?

28
MRS. KATZ:

I thought your first question was, if it

did not pay for birth at all»
Q

Right.

MRS. KATZ j

I did limit it to that.
Then I believe if fch® state provided no

benefits for childbirth whatsoever, then the case would
certainly bs very different in Due Process terms.
Q

Why would it be different in Due Process terms?

I can see why it would be different in Equal Protection terms.
In Du© Process it would seem to me it would b© exactly the
sam© case.
MRS. KATZ:

That may well be a Due Process case.

In fact, I conceive of the right to welfare benefits for
maternity car© as a Due Process question.
Q

Everybody has a right to publish a free press,

but that dees not impose an obligation on the state to
subsidize your free press, does it?
MRS. KATZ:

Absolutely not, and we are not asserting

her© that th© state has an obligation to pay for an abortion
for indigent women.

Just as in Shapi.ro v, Thompson, where

the right to travel was th© question, no on® suggested that
th© state had to in fact buy a bus ticket for an indigent
person.

We are ralying on the fact that when the state

provides a comprehensive program for obstetrical care, then
it must provide for abortion.
Q

Is that not an Equal Protection argument though?

29
MRS. KATZ:
Q

I think it is both, Your Honor.

Would you state your Due Process argument in

sort of simplified form for me»
MRS. KATZ:

Yes.

The right to terminate a pregnancy

is a right of personal privacy and personal liberty which is
incorporated in the kinds of liberty in the Fourteenth
Amendment and which may not be deprived without due process
of law.
By the same token, a classification cannot ba
created which imposes a deprivation of that sort of liberty,
and the questions under the Equal Protection test then'—
Q

You are going into Equal Protection of course

now.
MRS. KATZ:
Q

I added

that, yes.

I would like to think through the two different

arguments separately because one may be stronger than the
other.

In the case involving the teaching of German in

schools, it was held to be a denial of due process to deprive
th© parents of the right to send children to school where
German was taught.
Could the parents have insisted that the schools
provide the teaching of German in public schools?
MRS. KATZ;
Q

I d© not believe it could have.

Does that not refute your Due Process argument?

MRS1.. KATZ:

I do not believe it does.

30
Q

Your Due Process argument is that the state

cannot stop you from getting an abortion.

Well, the state is

not stopping you.
MRS. KATZ:

The Du© Process argument I make is a

little bit different from that.

I an making the argument

that under Due Process the state cannot condition -the choice
towards childbirth* that it cannot intrude into the decisionmaking process.

And that is what Connecticut is doing.

Whether the state has to provide medical services for
pregnancy may include Due Process questions about just what the
state is obligated t© provide under a system of medical
benefits to the poor.

But I believe that is a different

question which would not be resolved by the Court's decision
in this case.
0

What would happen if the state says* "W© will

pay for a natural birth but not a Caesarean'6?
Due Process?

Of course not.

MRS. KATZ S
Q

Would that be

Yes, it would.

At best it would b© Equal Protection, would it

not?
MRS. KATZ:

Mo, Your Honor, I believe that, it might

be a Due Process argument in terns of the kind of . judgments
the state is making in this protected area.
Q

Would it be a denial of either constitutional

right for the state t© subsidise an educational program urging

31
women to bear children and to make; the choice one way rather
than another?
MRS. KATZ;

It might, and that would raise different

kinds of questions.
Q
'

How would they be different?

MRS. KATZ:

The state’s interests would be different.

The program we ®r® discussing would b© different.

And the

impact on the woman's choice would be different.
Q

The motivation of the state would be precisely

the same as what you say the motivation of the state was
her®, to exercise th© influence of its moral view.
MRS. KATZ;

What the state does all the time in the -

educational process is certainly to assert its moral views.
What I am saying is this is

such a direct and immediate

impingement that evokes somewhat different considerations.
Q

Take my jury trial case.

A person, we both

agree, has an absolute constitutional right to a trial by
jury in a criminal case in a state or Federal court.

And yet

is it not true that a defendant who is convicted is charged
with the costs of a jury, whereas if he had waived a jury trial,
he would not have been charged with the costs of the judge*3
time?
Mils. KATZ;
Q

That is true.

Is that not the same point as you have her©?

MRS. KATZ;

I do not believe it is exactly th© same,

32

Mr. Justice Stewart, '.because—
Q

It is not exactly the same.

Being tried in a

criminal case is not exactly the same as having an abortion.
But is that not the point constitutionally?
MRS. KATZ:

As I see it, the opportunity for a. jury

trial is absolutely afforded to the defendant.
Q

But he is going to have to pay for it. himself

in many states if he is convicted.

Ha has to work it off in

prison.
MRS. KATZ:
Q

That is correct.

Whereas if he exercises his equal right not to

have a jury trial, he does not have to pay for the costs of
the txyer of the facts.
MRS. KATZ:

In the case we are discussing there is

virtually an absolute prohibition on the opportunity of the
woman to have this service.
Q

Only an indigent woman, is it not?

MRS. KATZ:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, only an

indigent woman. But'in fact as this Court has recognized in
its remarks in the Singleton v. Wulff case, in this context,
that impact on an indigent woman is virtually identical to
the criminal penalty at issue.

By the same token, Mr. Justice

Stewart, a woman receiving public assistance in the State of
Connecticut has an obligation in some cases to repay that
assistance.

But I do not think that justifies denial of

33

assistance to one who
Q

.asserts a substantial Federal right.

You do not suggest-r-as implied in my Brother

Marshall's question, it is clear that any woman in Connecticut
continues to have a constitutional right to have an abortion,
b© she rich or poor.

The question is she may or may not be able

to find a doctor who is willing to do that gratis, if she
cannot pay his bill.
MRS. KATZ:

Yes.

I would like to make it clear,

just as a start, that there has bean no question that a ciasc
of abortions, which are clearly within the protection of
Rq© v. Wade, is available to Medicaid eligible women, and this
includes the large majority of abortions, which are in fact
chosen for economic reasons or for social

or educational

reasons or for other family demands, ant that under the prior
authorization requirement, the physician must state that th®
abortion is medically necessary for the patient's health, and
he must state the specific reasons for th© medical necessity,
and h® must demonstrate that the patient has consented in
advance.
Q

Is that a separate question here?

MRS. KATZ:

Yas, it is a separate question,

Mr. Justice Whit©.
Q

The jurisdictional statement did not rais® that

issue separately as to whefehsr independently tine necessity to
certify in detail was unconstitutional.

34
MRS o KATZ:

I believe the prior authorization and

certification of necessity is part and parcel—is the msdical
necessity requirement because that requirement is not imposed
in any other way.

This is the difference, I believe,

between Pennsylvania and Connecticut's policies.

This is not

something that the department has stated that it will review
in its mind, but the department has directly asked the
physician to certify in advance
Q

bf treatment»

Mrs. Katz, did Connecticut say that all medical

procedures require a certificate of the same type?
MRS. KATZ:

Absolutely not, Mr. Justice Marshall.

This is the only service1—■
Q

Why not.

MRS. KATZ:
Q

I said, could Connecticut do that?

Could it?

Perhaps it could.

Would you have any complaint?

MRS. KATZ:

If every service had to have a certificate

of medical necessity?
Q

Yes.

MRS. KATZ:

Any statement that an abortion must be

medically necessary for the health of the patient I would
have a complaint about.
Q

If they said that any medical procedure

requiring payment must first have the same.type of certificate,
would that bs okay?
MRS. KATZ:

I do not believe it would.

35
Q

Why not?

MRS . KATZ:

Because it is impossible to conceive of

an unnecessary abortion unless the woman is not pregnant.

If

this standard were applied equally, truly equally, to all
forms of pregnancy care, that would acceptable.
Q

I did not say pregnancy,

MRS, KATZ:
Q
cetera.

I understand that.

I said appendicitis, ingrown toe nails, et

You have to file a certificate saying that this is

medically necessary before you get paid.
MRS. KATZ:

The reason I would object to that is

that any suggestion, as this record well shows, that an
abortion must be medically necessary works to immediately
exclude abortions which are necessary for the end desired by
the patient and the doctor but which may not—
Q

Then your answer is that the state could not
<

do that?
MRS. KATZ:
Q

No.

That is my answer.

It could do it for everything but abortions.

MRS. KATZ;

The state could require that every

service be necessary.
Q

Other than abortions?

MRS. KATZ:

1 am sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall, the

state could require that every service, including abortion,
be necessary.

That is required under Do© v. BoItem.

36
Q

That is the question 1 asked you.

MRS. KATE:

1 differentiate between medically

necessary and necessary.
Q

So, if it is necessary, that would be all right?

Q

In whose judgment, then, if it is not the

judgment of the doctor?
MRS. KATZ:

If the service had to be necessary, only

that were necessary in the judgment of the doctor would be
valid.
Q

You have me confused.

Q

Then you are now arguing Equal Protection,

which is what I thought you were arguing all along.
MRS. KATZ:

I think we are arguing both,

Mr. Justice Marshall.
Q

You mean, you will settle for either.

MRS. KATZ:

Certainly.

We have a situation where

pregnancy is a condition which virtually every court has held
to require some form of medical care.

If we are truly to lay

aside the emotions of the past, then abortion and full-term
delivery become equally necessary, depending on the choice of
the woman.

Or, looked at another way, either service is

unnecessary because the other could have been chosen.
Connecticut in fact does not limit obstetrical care
to necessary services in this sense because in many obstetrical
cases there are choices which may be harmful to the health of

37
the patient, but Connecticut will totally support the
decision to continue the pregnancy and bear the child even if
that continuation becomes in fact life threatening»

In other

cases the pregnancy may not be a threat to the health but.
there may be, for example, a danger of miscarriage.

Yet

Connecticut supports all services necessary to bring about
birth.

And that is true even though had the woman naturally

miscarried there would be no

danger to her health.

It is

tlie abortion choice here that is eliminated from coverage
fehough, as with all of the above procedures, it is clearly a
medical procedure necessary to the treatment of the condition
of the patient.
Moreover, statements

to the contrary notwithstanding,

on its face the regulation requires review of the particular
abortion by persons within the Department of Social Services.
It is said that they must review the application and make a
decision, and this becomes a veto of the abortion decision in
many cases which this Court has most recently affirmed its
objections to.
Q

Mrs. Katz, what if your client were at the

other end of the spectrum her©, so to speak; she were in a
state which had, under its Medicaid policies, said, "We are
very concerned about too much population.
abortions but not childbirth.

So, we will fund

We will not interfere with

childbirths but w© simply will not fund them."

Your client

38
wanted to have a full-term delivery and not an abortion.

Do

you think your constitutional argument that the stats program
was invalid would stand on the same footing as the one you are
now making?
MRS. KATZ:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, 1 believe

it would in that case.
Abortion, I would like to stress again, is the only
service subject t© this statement of medical necessity, and
I base that, on answers to our interrogatories which were
provided by the defendants,.

It is the only service covered by

Medicaid which requires that consent be demonstrated in
advance to the—Q

Mrs. Katz, let me take Mr. Justice Rehnquist's

question one step further.

Assume a state concerned with

overpopulation were to adopt a statute that provided for
everyone, tha rich as well as the poor—that the price of an
abortion will b® paid, plus a $50 bonus.

Would that be

constitutional, the reason being they want to control popula­
tion?
MRS. KATZ:

I think that there would be definite

constitutional objections to that sort of program.

That is

not to say that there are no steps the state can take which
encourage or discourage population growth or population
planning.
Q

I assume in my example that they continue to

39

pay for childbirth for the indigent, but they just try to
tip the scales in favor of abortion in the desire to control
population.
tion o

You say there would be a constitutional objec­

If so, what would be the constitutional objection?
MRS. KATZ:

That would again be a program which

was weighting the choice.
Q

Then you say the states has no legitimate

interest in th© rate of population within its borders?
MRS. KATZ:
Q

It may.

Then if it has an interest, why can it not tip

the scales one way or another or seek to?
MRS. KATZ:

Because that interest does not rise to

the level of justification for an infringement in this area
under this Court's prior decisions.
Q

Which prior decision says you cannot pay a

bonus for one choice rather than another?
MRS o KATZ s
Q
choice.

Roe—

Th© prior decision deals with preventing the

That is quit© different, it seems to me, from urging

one choice rather than another and being willing to pay a
bonus for it.
MRS. KATZ:

Ths prior decisions in Ros and Bolton

do deal with preventing the choice.

But the decisions on

public benefit programs that consider this sort of interference
go directly to weighting the choice.

There may be a different

40

balancing process when the state asserts and demonstrates an
interest in limiting population or increasing population»
That is, the way that interest is asserted is different from
the issues that are before the Court at this point»
Q

What I am trying to identify in my own mind is

whether it is critical to your case that we treat this as
something like a deprivation as opposed to a subsidy»

Is it

critical for you to regard this as something that deters the
woman from making one choice rather than the other?
MRS» KATZ s

W@ do not argue that we have to prove

that the woman was totally prohibited from making one choice
rather than the other»

Under Maricopa County and under

Shapiro v» Thompson and past cases, a penalty is sufficient.
I think that is the best answer I can give to that question.
Q

There is no penalty here.

There is a loss of

an opportunity to get a benefit if you made the other choice.
That is not quite the same as a penalty.
MRS» KATZ:
it was

Except that under Shapiro v. Thompson

specifically stated that that is the same as a penalty.

And under Memorial Hospital it was stated that that is the
same as a penalty, that it is enough if -there is an imping®"
ment, as this Court said in Singleton, an interdiction of the
choice of the abortion.
Q

Economic disincentive.

MRS. KATZ2

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

41
The Court has determined already that a woman has
a right, with her physician, to choose to terminate her
pregnancy, and this is a component of her right to personal
privacy, and it is a fundamental personal right which is
implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and which extends
to matters relating to marriage, th® family, procreation,
child rearing, and to the decision whether or not'to bear a
child.

What we are arguing is that whenever the state

denies an important government benefit to a person who asserts
such a fundamental right, it is violating th® Fourteenth
Amendment.

Th© fundamental right is mad® the operative

factor in the determination of eligibility for this benefit
and, as a consequence, as I have stated, there is a substan­
tial penalty imposed upon these plaintiffs.
The Court, I should not®, in both Shapiro and in
Memorial Hospital took into account the nature of the benefit
w® are discussing

and th© fact that this is the only way

indigent women can get medical care.

While there is no

right to subsidies.of medical care for anyone in this country,
that does not mean the Court must close its eyes 'io the
fact that this is a crucial benefit to recipients thereof.
G

Could I ask you, suppose in the case that went

before we were to construe th® Federal statute as the Second
Circuit did in this case—
MRS. KATZ t

As optional?

42
Q

Yes.

I take it then that Connecticut, if it

wanted to, could pay for elective abortions and it would not
cost them any money,
MRS. KATZ:

That is correct.

It would still cost

them their share of the Federal program.
Q

What is their share, how much?

MRS. KATZ:
Q

Fifty percent.

It is 50 percent.

But their fiscal interest

then is limited to that 50 percent.
MRS. KATS;
Q

Y@s.

As compared with carrying the birth to term,

which they pay for?
MRS. KATZ:
Q

That is 50 percent too.

MRS. KATZ;
Q

No.

Yes, that is correct.

They are matching funds.

It is a

50 percent

matching program all the \^ay across the board, is it not?
MRS. KATZ;

Yes, sir.

The Federal Government for

all Medicaid services —
Q

It is all 50 percent.

MRS. KATZ:

In Connecticut it is all 50 percent.

There are certain provisions for administrative costs—
Q

Family planning

MRS. KATZ:

90 percent.

Family planning is 90 percent.

Administration, I believe, is 75? I could be incorrect.

The

43
basic physician service is 50 percent for all cases.
The state, when it is creating such a burden or
penalty upon the exercise of a fundamental right, we argue,
is obligated to show a compelling interest for the way it
does that.

And this Court has consistently applied this test

to cases in the abortion area.

And, in addition, the

statement showed that this regulation is narrowly drawn to
accomplish that purpose.
Connecticut, as the District Court found, has shown
no interests which can be termed compelling or which even
meet the more limited rational basis test.

Connecticut in

fact has never been very consistent in demonstrating exactly
what its interest is.

When th® litigation first began,

Connecticut asserted that the only reason it limited payments
for these abortions was because the Social Security Act
compelled it to do so, and that it would become ineligible
for its matching funds if it paid for these services.
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals indicated that
that was not so, that Connecticut had the option under the
Federal statute to provide 'these services and it would be
reimbursed for them, and the Cotart in affect urged Connecticut
therefore to drop the regulations and to pay for the services
for which plaintiffs were asking.
Connecticut chose instead, however, to continue its
ban on payments for abortions, and then asserted that it had a

44
right- to limit its program to necessary services and that it
had a strong fiscal interest»
The fiscal interest, as noted by the District Court,
is really non-existent in that case because it was in the
record in fact that abortion is only a fraction as costly , as
is normal childbirth, and that it is many times less costly
than any complication of childbirth such as a Caesarean
section.
Moreover, by definition, the new-born child with its
mother will be eligible for aid to families with dependent
children, which at the time of this litigation for a family
consisting of an adult and a child, was $209 per month at a
minimum, not including eligibility for other other* services
which may have been available.
Q

Mrs. Katz, I am not sure that completely meets

your opponent’s argument.

As I understand him, h® is saying

that if we eliminate the line between necessary and unnecessary,
you will have to have a whole host of additional services
which will impose costs over and above just the abortion
cost, and that that is what you have to measure on both sides
©f the scale.
MRS. KATZ:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, but that is

logically not a persuasi'1/© argument because Connecticut would
not in fact have to pay for a whole host of services.
arguing that abortion is a necessary service.

We are

Q

The District Court---they talked about cosmetic

surgery, and the District Court said that is different because
it is not a constitutionally protected right.
wonder if that is valid.

But 1 just

Do you suppose a state could

constitutionally pass a statute that said nobody shall have
cosmetic surgery?
MRS o KATZ:
Q

Correct,

MRS. KATZ:
Q

Nobody in the entire state?

Perhaps not.

Then do you have a constitutional right to

cosmetic surgery?
MRS. KATZ:

But it would not be a fundamental right

in this area of privacy.
Q

Nothing could be morefundamental

than a

constitutional right, a constitutionally guaranteed right,
which my Brother Stevens is hypothesizing.
MRS. KATZ:
Q

It is simply—

Suppose a person isseriouslydisfigured

as

a result of an accident and wanted to have plastic surgery to
correct his appearance, and the state said, "No, w@ have a
statute that prohibits that."

You would say that is not a

constitutionally protected right?
MRS. KATZ:
Q

It may be constitutionally protected—

But not as well protected as the right to

make the abortion decision?

46
MRS. KATZ:

Well*. I think that may be correct* and

that may also be a necessary service and in fact is paid
for by the State of Connecticut in those circumstances.
Q

But if the Second Circuit is correct in the

way it construes th© statute* Connecticut could pick and
choose among the, quota f necessary * unquote, services that
ought to--is that right?
MRS. KATZ :

That is right except that there has to

be seme limitation on the constitutionality of its choices.
It could pick and choose among-Q

That may be so, that may be so.

But you would

say that it would have to choose to fund the abortions
because of the natur® of the interest involved?
MRS * KATZ:
Q

Yes, sir, I would.

And the statute would permit that.

But just

0

because the statute would permit it would not mean that it
would require therefore to pay for cosmetic surgery?
MRS. KATZ:
Q

Yes, sir.

Would it be equally wrong or less unconstitu­

tional in your hierarchy of constitutional rights for a state
to say, "We will pay for appendicitis operations but not for
gall stone operations"?
MRS. KATZ s
Q

Within the Medicaid program?

Yes.

MRS. KATZs

It would b® less wrong.

47
Q

Less what?

MRS. KATZ:
Q

Wrong.

.

Why?

MRS. KATZ:

Because this country just has not

enunciated a right to free medical care for all forms of
services.
Q

Have we enunciated a right to it for any forms

of surgery?
MRS. KATZ;

I believe that once a woman is pregnant

there is a right which does not come into play for & person—
Q

Where has that ever been enunciated, a right

to be subsidized?
MRS. KATZ:

No, a right to be free from an

imposition on the choice, whereas there are many forms of
medical care which involve choices both by the patient and by
the physician, and there is no right, absolute right, to make
one choice or the other.
Q

You are saying then that the state has to have

a program of free medical services for indigents as a matter
of constitutional law because there is a choice—-if I have a.
bad stomach ache, I have got a choice of going to the doctor
and not going to the doctor.

And if I do not have any money,

I do not have & choice of going to a doctor unless there is
some assistance program available to me.
Q

I believe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that I was

48
saying the opposite, that there is no right, to free medical '
f

car© for the indigent.

Connecticut could perhaps have no

program of Medicaid, and Connecticut could perhaps limit its
program to life-threatening procedures.
•that.

But it has not done

It has a very comprehensive program which pays for

many services which, by this definition, are not particularly
necessary.

And in the context of that program there cannot

be a weighting of the choice of the pregnant woman on® way
or the other.
