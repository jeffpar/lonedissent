ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL J. RABIN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, RABIN:

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice.

May it please the Court:
This litigation began almost six years ago and has
been before the Court on two previous occasions.

Despite its

complex courses through the federal judicial system, there is
only on© clearcut issue now facing the Court at this time.
And that is:

whether the present version of the regulation

of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, 45 C.F.R.
233.100(a)(1) is valid under the grant of rule-making authority
contained in Section 407(a) of the Social Security Act.
So what w© are arguing today is an administrative law
case.

One concerning the proper scope of agency rule-making.
By its petition for certiorari, Maryland seeks

reversal of an order by a three-judge district court, affirmed
by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, denying
Maryland's motion to vacate an injunction previously entered
by the district court.
That denial was based on the holding that the HEW
regulation was invalid under Section 407(a).

4
Before stating the facts, it might be helpful to
briefly outline the statutory framework»

The AFDOUF program,

unlike the regular AFDC program, authorises benefits to twoparent households where the need or deprivation of the children
in the

family arise from the unemployment of the father.

The program was first enacted in 1961 as the Unemployed Parent
Program, and covered need or deprivation arising from the
unemployment of either parent.
In its original form, Section 407 provided for
coverage of children who are needy as the result of the
unemployment of a parent "as defined by the State".
In 1968, substantial amendments were made in the
program, and the language of Section 407 was changed from
unemployment as defined by the State to "unemployment as
determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the
Secretary. ”
After passage of these amendments, HEW prescribed
the predecessor version of 233.100(a)(1), which mandated an
hours-worked criterion for State definitions of unemployment.
All persons who worked less than 30 hours per week.
The regulation also permitted coverage for persons
who worked up to 35 hours per week.

That was the regulation

which was in effect when this litigation began in 1971.
The claimants in this case all applied for Maryland
AFDOUF benefits after applying for and being denied Maryland

5
Unemployment Corapens ation benefits.
Claimant Robert Francis , a laboratory technician, was
denied unemployment insurance because he was participating in
a strike which resulted in a work stoppage at his plant.
Claimant Edward Wright, who intervened in the Francis
case, was disqualified because he was fired from his job as a
carpenter for excessive absenteeism, and the Maryland
Unemployment Insurance Agency determined that that conduct
constituted gross misconduct.
Claimant Barry Bethea, who filed a separate action
which was consolidated with the Francis case on appeal, was
disqualified from Unemployment Compensation when it was
determined that he had voluntarily left his job as a truck
driver/delivory man without good cause.
All these claimants were then denied AFDC-UF benefits
in Maryland, pursuant to the Maryland Social Service Regula­
tion 7.02.09.1GA(2) , which provides that ,!A grant may not be
paid from AFDC-E" — which is the Maryland label for AFDC-UF —
”to meet need due to being disqualified for unemployment
insurance.”
The three-judge district court, which was convened
in idle Francis case, determined in its first decision — which
w© describe in our brief as Francis I — that this Maryland
regulation did not violate 'the Equal Protection Clause, as
claimants had alleged, but that it did violate tire predecessor

6

version of 233» 100 (a) (1) in that, in the court's view# that
regulation did not permit the States to considar any factors
other than hours worked in determining unemployment»

As a

result, the district court subsequently enjoined the enforcement
of the Maryland regulation»
When that injunction was appealed by the State to
this Court, the Solicitor General advised the Court that HEW
had always infeerpreted the statute and its own regulation to
permit other State eligibility factors, such as contained
in the Maryland rule.»
However, since HEW had decided to amend its regula­
tion, to expressly permit regulations such as that of Maryland,
the Solicitor General recommended summary affirmance, and this
Court took that action.
Thereafter, IIEW did amend the regulation as the
Solicitor General

had indicated, and 'the regulation now

requires that States pay benefits to those persons who worked
less tlian. 100 hours per month, except that States are
permitted to deny benefits to persons engaged in a labor
dispute or engaged in conduct resulting, or which would result,
in disqualification under the State's Unemployment Compensation,
laws.
After that regulation was amended in that manner,
Maryland filed a motion to dissolve the injunction in Francis 3,
but the district court in the Francis II decision held that

7
the Maryland regulation was still invalid on the ground that
the amended HEW regulation now violated Section 407(a)®
The decision in Francis II not to vacate the
previously entered injunction was based on the theory that
Section 407 relates to unemployment of a father, and a father
who is discharged for cause is unemployed•, and HEW, by
regulation* cannot permit States to deny benefits to persons
who fall within this ordinary meaning of the term®
With regard to persons out of work as a result of a
labor dispute * the district court held the amended regulation
did not establish any standards for the States, it did not
prescribe standards as the statute provided* since it granted
discretion to the States to deny or to pay such benefits»
The separate district court decision in the Bethea
case adopted the same reasoning as the Francis II decision did,,
with regard to misconduct® The Be thea was was the on© which
involved persons who had voluntarily quit without good cause®
Th© court there held* as in Francis II* with regard to mis­
conduct* that such persons were in fact unemployed and* under
the statute* the federal agency had no authority to deny
benefits to such persons»
The Court of Appeals affirmed those two district
court decisions in a per curiam decision* adopting th©
reasoning and conclusions and not offering any rationale of
its own

8
As I indicated earlier, the State believes that the
basic issue in this case is the scope of HEW * s rule-making
authority.
We contend that the issue is not whether AFDC-UF
benefits should be paid to misconducts, to strikers, or to
persons who have voluntarily quit their jobs? rather, the
question is whether the statute gives HEW the authority to
allow States to choose to pay such benefits.
Our position, stated vary briefly, is that the
statute constitutes a very broad grant of legislative type of
rule-making authority to HEW, and that the regulation
constitutes a reasonable exercise of that authority.
There obviously can be no question that the language
of the statute expressly grants broad rule-making authority.
We believe that those statutory words falls within the label
that Professors Jaffe and Davis have devised, namely legis­
lative type of rule-making? other commentators refer to them
as prescriptive or substantive rules.
And it is well-established that such rule-making is
to be given substantial deference by the courts.

As this

Court stated in Cltizens to Preserve Overton Park, the ultimate
standard of review is a narrow one, the Court is not empowered

to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.
Thus, the HEW regulation, we contend, is valid and
should be upheld, if it is reasonable under the statute, even

9
if the Court favors a different result.
Claimants and the district court avoided the issue
of the broad scope of rule-making authority contained in
Section 407 in two ways:
First, as I indicated, they argue that the regulation
was invalud because it excluded from 'die persons ~ from the
program certain persons who fell within the ordinary meaning
of that term.
While we respectfully contend that that reasoning
begs the question, the purpose of the statutory words was to
give the rule*-making authority -to HEW, and for HEW to give
content to the term "unemployment”.
self-defining in the statute.

The term has never been

It was not self-defining in

1961, and it is not self-defining after 1968.
Reliance on a dictionary meaning cannot answer such
a question, as this Court has so recognised in the Burns v,
Alcala case, which concerned the meaning of the term "dependent,
child".
While the district court and the claimants choose to
rely on the dictionary meaning of the term "unemployment”,
of course they choose to ignore totally the dictionary meaning
of the words "in accordance with standards prescribed by the
Secretary"»
The district court also avoided the question of the
scope of rule-making authority contained in 407 by holding,

10

with regard to persons who are participating in a labor
dispute# that the section mandated a uniform national definition
of "unemployraent”®
Therefore# the district court reasoned that the
limited grant of discretion to the States with regard to such
persons disqualified for participation in labor disputes was
improper0
I do want, to mention at this point that Maryland
agrees with 'the point raised by the Solicitor General in
his memorandum that the Court does not have to get to the
question of the validity of the regulation in connection with
persons participating in a labor dispute# because# in Maryland#
all the claimants and -the Maryland rule only operates against
persons who are disqualified from unemployment insurance®
It sc happened that the leading named plaintiff was a person
who was participating in a strike# but he was denied benefits
because of -- under the Maryland rule he was disqualified from
unemployment insurance.
QUESTION:

Now# you told us that the dictionary

meaning of ‘’unemployment'® is basically irrelevant? is that it?
MR® RABIN:

We think it’s not the test for

determining ~*»
QUESTION:

Yon mean it’s not dispositive?

MR® RABIN:

That's correct# Your Honor®

QUESTION: But you would concede# I suppose# -that it’s

11
relevant if it said — in looking at the regulations you have
to have some rational relationship to the word "unemployment"#
do you not?
MR. RABIN:

That's correct# Your Honor,

That's correct. And it’s our contention that the HEVJ
regulation and the Maryland rule thereunder are reasonable under
that word# under this -—
QUESTION:

The "unemployment"?

MR, RABIN:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

But# I just want to be sure# you don't

say that the statutory phrase is irrelevant# —
MR. RABIN:
QUESTION:

No# I don't think —
— it all depends on what the regulations

say.
MR. RABIN:

And we would not contend that HEW

could not look at the dictionary meaning when it —
QUESTION:

Well# it must not look at the ordinary

meaning of the word# then defining by regulation what it means,,
in giving it precise regulatory definition.
MR. RABIN:

That’s correct.

The legislative history with regard to Section 407
has been set. out at great length in our brief# in claimants'
brief# the Appendix# and the decisions below# and I will not
try to repeat it.
It is true that there are phrases in the Committee

12
Reports that talk about a national definition of unemployment.,
On the other hand, it is also true that other reports
talk about the statute as "authorizing" a national definition?
and sometimes it's the sane report that uses the phrase, "a
national definition". And it is also true that those reports
at some points us a the actual statutory words? namely, "as
determined in accordance with standards prescribed by HEW".
It would have bean very easy for the Congress to
mandate a national definition with regard to a uniform national
definition. All they would have had to do in 1968 would have
been to substitute the word "Secretary" for the word "State"
in the statute.

This fact was recognised by the district

court in its Francis I decision.

But, as that decision points

out. Congress chose instead to use new words which do not
mandatorily require the Secretary to require each State to
adopt the same meaning of the word "unemployment", but
instead merely authorise the Secretary to prescribe a national
meaning if the Secretary so desires.
The many statements, as to the intent of the 196S3
change must be considered in connection with the actual
words used in the statute.

As this Court has recognized, the

most persuasive evidence for the purpose of a statute is the
words by which the Legislature chooses to give expression to
its wishes.
We think that when one considers the legislative

13

history behind the 1961 statute, behind the 196 8 amendments#
and looks at the words or the statute themselves# it is clear
that Congress contemplated that the Secretary of HEW was free
to allow tii© Statas limited discretion —- limited discretion —
to vary the coverage in response to their differing needs in
policies.
Thus t under the broad authority granted by this
section# the federally prescribed standards could take the
form of a national definition# but they could also grant the
States some discretion in specific areas „ as in fact the
regulation has done.
Assuming that to be the case# HEW's regulations still
must meet the test of reasonableness under the statute or the
courts must set it aside.

We think it is clear thet 233,100 (a)

(1) does meet that test in connection with the purposes of the
APDC-UF program as set out in the statute and the legislative
his tory,
When the program was first adopted# President
Kennedy indicated that it was intended for unemployed workers t
and h© gave the example of a person who had exhausted his
unemployment compensation,

Wa have quoted at length in our

brief from the statements by Congressman Byrnes# one of the
co-sponsors of the original legislation# which makes clear
that Congress did not intend that the program provide benefits
to persons who w@r© voluntarily unemployed.

14
And, as originally adopted in 1961 and as amended
in 1968, Congress made clear that the program was intended to
provide assistance to persons in connection with employment
not covered by the existing unemployment compensation program,
that the program was not designed to substitute for that
already existing nationwide program.
Furthermore, as amended, the program is very similar
in operation to unemployment compensation, in that it9s an
income maintenance program designed to assist those who are
unemployed not as a result of their own conduct.
In light of the similarity of these purposes, namely
to pay persons who are involuntarily unemployed, we think it is
clearly not unreasonable to attempt by regulation or to permit
by regulation a state to harmonise the operation of these two
income

maintenance programs; namely, not to pay benefits under

one scheme for conduct which results in a disqualification under
the other.
We note that the district court, in dismissing the
claimants9 constitutional claim, recognized this harmonization
purpose as a rational basis for the regulation. And the court
held that; — the court upheld the argument that rationalization,
of these two programs, which are both part of the scheme of
cooperative federalism described by this Court in the King case,
established by the Social Security Act, was a proper rational
basis, although the district court did not necessarily agree

15
with that basis»
It is certainly not unreasonable to grant States
limited discretion contained in 233,100(a)(1) in one of th©
public assistance programs created by the Social Security Act,
when the statute permits such a grant of limited discretion.
The basic purpose of the statute is to extend assistance to a
group of needy persons

and this is true of all the public

assistance programs — by making partial federal reimbursement
available to those States which meet certain substantive
federal requirements.
Now, unlike the other public assistance programs,
24 States have not joined the AFDC-UF program? although, as
indicated in our brief, three States have joined in the last
two years, and one State has dropped out of the program.
As shown by the Solicitor General’s memorandum, a
significant number of States —* nine if you include Maryland —•
have restrictions -- actually -there’s more' than nine, because
the Solicitor General classified eight States with regard to
cause and then eight States with regard to strikers? so that
\

the total number of States who might be interested in this type
of a restriction would be greater than nine.
It’s difficult for

Maryland to see hew the

prohibition against such State discretion will encourage the
general purpose of the program — of the statute, through
State participation in this program which

is designed to

16

assist needy, laid-off workers, and unemployed through no fault
©f their own»
We think that perhaps the best proof of the reason­
ableness of the grant of discretion found in the regulation
is the approach taken by the federal government itself in
connection with —
QUESTION: But the statute doesn't induce that
element which you just mentioned, "through no fault of their
own”f the neediest people may be the children in the homes of
unemployed people who are unemployed because of fault of their
own.
MR,, RABIN: Well, you’re correct, Mr. Justice Stewart,
■that it doesn't use that phrase, —*
QUESTION: The statute.
MR. RABIN;

The statute.

But it does in other ways

make clear that parsons who, through their own conduct, are
not active — for example, not actively seeking employment,
are not entitled to benefits.
QUESTION:

But there are other forms of welfare

benefits to fcak® car© of needy children, needy people, besides
just the ones we’re talking about 'here.
MR. RABIN: That's correct, if you're talking about
the medical assistance program.
In addressing Mr. Justice —
QUESTION; But this is APDC-UF

17
MR* RABIN: Right,
We think the legislative history shows that the
program was not designed to assist those who were voluntarily
unemployed®
QUESTION: Well, it was designed to assist children*
was it not?
MRa RABINs That's correct®
And we don't

But we

that's right®

contend — it's not Maryland's position — that

the States that have chosen not to adopt the restrictions that
Maryland has chosen are doing something illegal —
QUESTION:

No, I understand that® The question is

whether this regulation is permissible.
MR® RABIN:

That's correct® And we think that when

you look at the total statutory framework, there is a require­
ment for job registration.

There's a denial of benefits for

refusal to accept a suitable job offer®
QUESTION:

Now, this is statutory?

Or ~

MR, RABIN: These are all statutory, and they are
contained in Section 407,
We think, taking those requirements with the
legislative history, it seems clear that the thrust, of the
program was to help those who are involuntarily unemployed®
QUESTION:

But the States are not compelled to

participate in this program, are they?
MR® RABIN:

That’s correct, Your Honor, and 24 States

18

have not participated, although a few have because of the
recent economic conditions in the last few years, that three
have joined the program.
QUESTION; But in those States the families and the
children of those families in these circumstances must depend
upon other —
MR. RABIN;

That’s correct, Your Honor. They receive

no assistance of this type at all.

And it’s our contention

that it's reasonable for the Secretary of HEW to look at
what he can do to encourage those States to participate in
the program in prescribing his regulations. And that, we
think, in fact supports this particular regulation, which
gives States the choice, it doesn't mandate that they make
the payments, and it doesn't prohibit that they make the
payments.
•QUESTION:

Yes. And the flsixibility to permit

variations from State to State were contemplated by Congress
to take into account different forms of industry and occupation
among other things, were they not?
MR. RABIN; We think so. And we think that this Court
?
made clear in the Dableno decision that in connection with
the welfare cases, the welfare programs, the courts are to
give considerable latitude to the differing State interests,
so that the programs can be developed in a flexible manner
to meet the needs in particular States.

19

The Congress is clearly aware of the issue of
coverage of strikers in this particular program. That3s shown,
by the colloquy between Congressman Byrnes and -- excuse

me ,

Congressman Mills and Dominick, which is cited in claimants'
brief.
So Congress knew, when this program was originally
adopted in 1961, that it was not mandating or not prohibiting
~ in fact, the colloquy goes to the effect, Congressman Mills
indicates that if S-bates chose, they could make the payments
to strikers.
We think that, as I was saying, the example by the
federal government in connection with the State-administered
Unemployment Compensation program, we think is a good example
of the reasonableness of the Secretary's regulation. Congress
has. been aware for years, and the federal agencies have been
aware for years, of the fact that some States paid unemployment.
■— a few States pay unemployment compensati.on benefits to
strikers, and many States do not pay unemployment compensation
to strikers.
However, with regard to that particular program,
which is administered by the States, and is financed through
State taxes, Congress has decided to leave that discretion to
tij© States.
W© think that that approach is no less reasonable
when taken by the Administrator of a program who is charged with

20

broad authority , to imp lenient and supervise the program, no
less reasonable than it is when it's taken by the Congress.
Claimants contend that the IIEW regulation is invalid
under the State eligibility decisions by this Court in
recent years in the welfare field, including the most recent
formulation in Burns v. Alcala,

the 1975 decision I referred

to previously, concerning whether unborn children are
necessarily covered under the AFDC program.
However, contrary to their contention, it's our
view that that decision really supports the validity of the
HEW regulation.
In Bums, tdie Court stated that a participating state
may not deny aid to persons who come within the statute, in
the absence of a clear intent that the Congress meant the
coverage to b© optional.
Well, there is such an indication in this case? it’s
right in the statute.

Congress provided that the Secretary of

Health, Education, and Welfare had the option to extend or
restrict the coverage of the statute and also to grant a
limited discretion to th© States.
We think that even more appropriate in support of
?
the HEW regulation is the reasoning of the Dableno decision,
to which I referred to previously.

We also think that the.

Lewis v, Martin case, which upheld HEW*s broad rule-making
authority with regard to th® AFDC program, supports this case

21

And we think that the decision by tills Coijrt recently in
?
?
Abel v. Hein, which upheld the regulation by the Secretary of
Agriculture# also supports the regulation*, That decision
cautioned the courts to defer to the informed experience and
the judgment of responsible administrative agencies # even if
they might .favor a different result.
The decisions below interpret the statutory language#
"unemployment as determined in accordance with standards
prescribed by the Secretary”# which is an express grant of
very broad rule-making authority# to mandate coverage for
persons disqualified from unamployment compensation because
they were fired for misconduct or because they voluntarily
quit their jobs.
And also to bar any grant of discretion to the
States# as to payments to strikers.
In effect# they say -that HEW has no broad authority
with regard to that first category; and that with regard to
the second category# HEW must either mandate a national —*
mandate, payments on- a nationwide basis or prohibit payments
on a national basis,
VI®' respectfully contend that that is not a reasonable

interpretation of the statutory

.language or of the legislative

his texy.
As Maryland toe Solicitor General have demonstrated#
toe regulation which HEW has promulgated under these statutory

22
words, we think, is a reasonable regulation, and the Maryland
regulation which authorises it, are valid and the decisions
below should be reversed.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Brown.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. CHRISTOPHER BROWN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case basically involves a question of whether
or not tiie Secretary of HEW has followed the power that he
was given by Congress in a specific statute, 42 U.S.C.
Section 607.
The statute reads, as is pertinent to this case,
in defining who can get this certain kind of welfares benefit
for families that do have children, feat it must go to needy
chi ldren whose 51 father® s unemployment, as determined in
accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary", then
so forth and so on, with other preconditions.
So we’re talking about unemployment* in accordance
with standards prescribed by fee Secretary.
The Secretary, in attempting to define "unemployment*,
has done so in various ways.

23
First of all, the Secretary has defined unemployment
in terms of hours worked, which we have no quarrel with whatso­
ever.

That is the most common-sensical way in which to define

whether or not a person is unemployed or not.
other ways.

There may be

It may be whether or not he has a contractual

duty or right with respect to an employer.

It could also

perhaps be defined with respect to the rights that he has,
seniority rights perhaps, to an old job.

Very many other

aspects of what an employee might have to expect in a specific
case.
But the Secretary of HEW hasn't defined the terra
•’unemployment” in that way.

Instead, the Secretary has

basically defined the terra by the legal consequences of the way
in which a person lost his last job.
So, in addition to defining employment in terms of
hours worked, the Secretary also allows the States, at their
option, if they so choose, to choose a definition of unemploy­
ment which turns on two things:

one, whether or net that

parson is eligible for unemployment insurancey and, secondly,
whether or not. that person has been involved in a labor
dispute.
It's our contention, Your Honors, that the latter
definitions or attempted definitions by HEW are null and void,
as the judges that have heard this case thus far have found.
As a prelude, I'd like to say that we agree with the

24
Stateo

The issue in this case is that part of the HEW

regulation dealing with giving the States the power to dis­
qualify people from AFDC-UF, this welfare program, v/ho have
in turn been disqualified by those States for unemployment
insurance.
I don't think, the Solicitor General doesn't think,
and the State has conceded

it does not think, that we are

talking about the part of the HEW statute dealing with striker
disqualification.

Tli® State hasn't acted on that basis.

It merely

disqualifies people v/ho are disqualified in turn for unemploy­
ment insurance, and, as a consequence, I cannot see how there's!
a case or controversy before this Court on that second part
of the HEW statute, dealing with striker disqualification.
QUESTION:

Is your quarrel v;ith the mechanism or

with the substance of it?
HR. BROWN:

I'm not —

QUESTION: Suppose the State of Maryland had enacted
its eligibility qualifications in precisely the same terras, but;
in a separate statute or regulation.

I'm trying to get at just;

the focus of your objection to it.
MR. BROWN:

Objection to the definition itself, or

my objection to what's at issue in this case?
I was saying tliat the —
QUESTION;

Well, 1 think the two are quite similar

25

MR. BROUN; Well* I don’t think that the issue in this
case is that part of the HEW regulation dealing with strikers*
per se* labor disputes* per sa.

I think* and Maryland

concedes and the Solicitor General states* that what is at
issue here is that portion of the reg* the HEW reg* which
deals with disqualification from unemployment benefits.
Now* it so happens that Maryland* unlike other
States*

few other States* admittedly — happens to also

disqualify strikers from unemployment insurance. So* in that
sense* it is relevant* but it’s very indirectly relevant.
Now* the case seemingly can be resolved without
specifically asking ‘the question of whether the Secretary has
the power to define unemployment in terms of people who are
involved in labor disputes or aren't involved in labor
disputes.
Now, there seem to be two separate* different kinds
of questions.

And I don't think — I can't see* another party

seemed to come up with a way to see it can be a case or
controversy with respect to the labor dispute portion.
We all admit that there is with respect to the
unemployment insurance disqualification'portion.
Our major controversy* Your Honors* with the
Secretary's definition* allowing States to disqualify people
if they in turn have been disqualified for unemployment
insurance, is this:

The statute gives the Secretary the

26

power to define "unemployment”, not the way in which you lost
your last job — a person can be unemployed now for various
different reasons that brought him into that position.
Unemployment., in the common-sensicai term, means your status
right now:

do you have a job or don’t you have a job?

Are

you getting money or aren’t you getting money?
QUESTION: But the statute in question was enacted to
give the Secretary authority to make rules relating to
supplementing State unemployment compensafcion plans, wasn’t
it?

MR, BROWN:

Your Honor, I remember nothing in the

legislative history which has that, concept —
QUESTION:

In other words, you don't think that any

of this statutory language can be related to disqualifications
in State plans by virtue of the fact that the federal legisla­
tion had in mind the State plan?
MRc BROWN: State welfare plan or unemployment
insurance?
QUESTION:

No, State — yes, State unemployment

compensation plan.
MR. BROWN: The Act did have in mind the State
unemployment compensation plan to a very large extent, and
mentioned —
QUEST' ON:
MR. BROWN:

Well, might not ~
those five or six times in the

27

specific section of the Act.
QUESTION;

Well* as you®re aware* and as I’m sure

your colleagues, your opponents are aware, the typical State
unemployment compensation plan provides four or five
disqualifications and that sort of thing* the kind of labor
dispute type? of thing you've been talking about.
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
Isn’t it at least inferable that Congress*

whan it used the term "unemployment”* was using it in the
sense of unemployment as that term would be used to define
eligibility for State unemployment compensation?
MR. BROWN:

Well* tliat is a possible explanation.

There is not one word in the legislative history that I have
found
QUESTION:

Well* if that’s a possible explanation*

isn’t that enough for the Secretary to go forward on and
promulgate a regulation?
MR. BROWN:

I don’t think so* Your Honor* because

it’s such an unusual . explanation.

"Unemployment"* the first

tiling that pops to my mind in trying to define an unemployed
person is not to define the legal consequences that he may
b® suffering from another benefit program.

That doesn't

necessarily — let’s take this case for example.

A person

who has allegedly committed misconduct in a job* and therefore
is now out of work.

The Secretary in essence is trying to

28
make that person# who has no employer# who has no money and
who is out of work# somehow not be unemployed.
Nov;# it seems to me the Secretary is standing the
definition on its head.
Nov;# you can do that .in certain situations.
Certain Acts# for instance# the NLRA# which has been talked
about her©# it defines "employee” in ways in which the common
person wouldn't really define "employee”; and there are many
statutes which do that.
But there's

no indication whatsoever in this case

that the Congress intended the Secretary to come up with a
term of art kind of definition as opposed to the commonsensical definition of what an unemployed parson is.
And. indeed# if there's any hint to be had from
hew the Congress interrelated this program, into the unemploy­
ment insurance schemes that went on in the private States# in
each State# it would be# I think# that they didn't intend to
disqualify this sub class of people; otherwise they would
have said so.
QUESTION:

Why did. they leave the — why did thesy

authorize the Secretary# -then# to make regulations defining
the term?
MR. BROWN:

It's

my guess# Your Honor# that the

primary motivation'was — the legislative history shows# for
example# Arizona, at one point in time# had 16 families on

29
this program; neighboring Utah or Colorado, I forget which,
had 1200 or 1600, something like that»
own different terms»

Each State had its

Congress wanted to unify things»

Legislative history is replete with comments about a national
uniform standard across the country»
QUESTION:

You mean that in an absolute sense?

MR» BROWN: Well, I'm sure not in an absolute sense,
but in a much better sense than what existed at that point»
QUESTION: Well, if Congress wanted to have it
absolutely uniform, it would have defined ~ done all the
defining itself, would it not?
MR» BROWN: That would have been one way of
accomplishing the task»
QUESTION:

My guess is this
Well, they very carefully refrained from

doing that and explained that they wanted to leave the States
some flexibility.
MR» BROWN: Well, not that they wanted to leave the
States flexibility, but that they wanted to leave the
definition of ’'unemployment” to the Secretary» who would be in
a better position to define normally, we would think, what
"unemployment83 actuali means»

And my guess is that, they

would want the Secretary to define it in terms of hours, as
the Secretary originally did*
The Secretary has come.up with his new way of
defining "unemployment" as a result of this lawsuit»

30

Now, this is a way to get around this, the earlier
victory that plaintiffs had in this lawsuit»
But my guess would be that Congress said;
you pick the hour number»

Secretary,

And the Secretary had two different

--- originally it was 30 hours a week, now it’s 100 hours a
month, which is the cutoff limit.
no AFDC.

If you work more than that,

You are not unemployed.
Congress most rationally could have thought;

the Secretary pick the hour amount.

Let

Or perhaps let the Secre­

tary define another way, in terms of existing contract with
an employer, the amount of money the person earns as opposed
to ‘the amount of hours a person works. There are many other
ways to do it.
There is no indication in the legislative history
whatsoever that Congress contemplated the Secretary doing this.
If anything, Congressman Hills, at one point in the
i

legislative history, has said, in response to a question asked
on the Floor — and Mills, of course, is sort of the father of
this legislation — he said that labor, that strikers could be
given AFDC-UP benefits', if tie States so desired.
This was back in the days when the States had full
definitional ability, and the federal government, HEW, did not.
Now, I think in all but two States strikers are
ineligible for unemployment insurance.

It would be very

strange if Congressman Mills felt that unemployment insurance

31

dis quali fi cants couldn’t, gat this program benefit, and he
would say something like that about strikers»

It’s totally

inconsis tent.
Another thing which was very inconsistent with that
is that the Act mentions unemployment insurance five or six
different times in one section of the Act.

It talks about

how it interrelates with the AFDC program, and, for example,
it used to be feat if you we re receiving unemployment insurance
you couldn’t get this program; Congress has recently amended
that Act to slightly change your Glodgett v. Phi lb rook case of
a couple of years ago.

But still they talk about unemployment

insurance time and time again in the statute, but they don't
say what the State is trying to get this Court to say, namely,
that Congress intended that those who could not get unemployment
insurance a fortiori then could not get this 'welfare program.
QUESTION: Well, that's — you're overstating it.
Not that Congress intended that those who could not get
unemployment insurance could not get this welfare, but whether
or not a State was permitted to so determine,
MR. BROWN:

I think that's correct.

QUESTION:

Or, more accurately, whether the

Secretary was —
MR. BROWN:

Well, what the Secretary is permitted

to give the State.
QUESTION:

was entitled to put in a definition

32
that would permit the State their option to do it»
MR» BROWN;

That's correct,

I see nothing in the

legislative history which points in that direction.
Another thing which points against that direction
is this very significant concern that* if you acquainted yourself with the legislative history, you’d see is very sparse *—
the* legislative history almost says nothing in this case.
But one thing that it does say is that we want uniform
national definitions, set by the Secretary. We want the
Secretary to say what you can do, States, and what you can’t
do.
What the Secretary has done in this case, in
essence, is to say that if you want to, you don’t have to but
if you vrant to, you can disqualify people who can’t get
unemployment insurance.
Now, each State has its own different system of
unemployment insurance.

This book, a publication by the

U. S» Department of Labor, talks about all -the differences
rt

-r •

in all the State programs on unemployment insurance.

If the

State is correct, and the Secretary properly can allow States
to exclude people who can’t get unemployment insurance
compensation, you’re going to have a different AFDC-OF program
in every single State, almost by definition.
that would be the case.

I would think

Because each State has a different

unemployment insurance system.

33

And then, also# the States don't necessarily have
to disqualify people who can't get unemployment insurance#
the Secretary gives them the option of doing that or not doing
f

that»
It's sort of confusing» The Secretary is allowing us
to define these people as unemployed if we want to# or as not
unemployed if we- a State for instance# don't, want to.
You can't have it both ways.

It's got to be one way or it's

got to be the other way.
I think that's one of the problems»
Secretary

If the

the Secretary would not be in as much danger in

terms of invalidity of his regulation if he had saids
to be this.

It has

States# you do this and you do this and you do

this.
And that's what you have to do.

The Secretary# for

various reasons# I think# tried to play it both ways.

And a

person in this category# these people in this class are either
unemployed or they're not unemployed.

But they can’t be both

ways.
Another aspect which I think makes it very

I think

it's reasonable to assume that the kind of people who get
AFDOUF# tills class of people here# are in many ways very
different than the class of people who get unemployment
insurance.

And, as a consequence# it's not at all unusual

for Congress to allow the children of these parents to get this

34
kind of benefit;* whereas they will allow the States to dis~
qualify their parents from getting unemployment insurance.
Now, they are two different kinds of programs, they
are very much interrelated, but this welfare program primarily
is for children.

You can't get this kind of welfare unless

you have a child.
On the other hand, 'unemployment insurance is for
parents.

The fact that you have children or don't have

children really makes little difference as to what kind of
benefit amount you can get.
Unemployment insurance is for parents; AFDC is for
children, basically.
Unemployment insurance gives money based upon
employers' contributions; welfare, AFDC, gives it based upon
tax revenues.
I can vary well see a rational Congress sayings

If

this man committed misconduct, his employer shouldn't have to
pay his keep on unemployment insurance for 13 weeks or 26
weeks or whatever, after he has been kicked off the job.
That makes sens©.
Welfare program, though, is for children.
Incidentally, also, welfare programs have very few
fault concepts in them.

Normally speaking, we don't try to

blame the child for something his father did.

It may be that

the fathers .in this case are bad fathers, because they didn’t

35
handle fcheir work jab in a correct fashion.

But, typically,

the welfare programs in this country and the federal program
specifically haven't been concerned with fault in that sense.
Unemployment insurance programs has — have.
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t it true that unemployment

insurance programs are not based upon proof of need -MR. BROWNs

That's correct.

QUESTION:

— a person is eligible if he’s unemployed.

No matter if he has ten million dollars in the stock market.
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

That's absolutely correct.
Whereas, welfare programs are based upon

need, alone upon need? isn’t that correct?
MR. BROWN: That’s true. That's true, Mr. Justice
Stewart®
QUESTION:

?
Didn't we hold in the Java case

that it's a partial substitute for the earnings that have:
terminated?
MR. BROWN:

In essence, that’s what it is. And the

typical case, somebody gets laid off their job, there's a
3G~d©y waiting period in this case, incidentally, -~
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

Yes.
— you have to wait thirty days before

you can apply to tills program. And most States also require
you to go to the unemployment line first, to get unemployment
compensation.

Once you’ve gotten that, you can come back and

36

try to get AFDC, if you're eligible fox' it.
But there are very different —-

there ax'© similar

programs, but they have significant differences,
QUESTION: But there are limitations even on the
unemployment insurance* are there not?
MR. BROWN: There are time limitations* —
QUESTION:

That is* you must accept *— you must

report regularly, you must accept employment if it meets the
standard.
MR. BROWN:

That's correct.

And those same — those

limitations on unemployment insurance are the same in this
program also®

The men in this class have to report regularly*

have to take jobs if they are offered jobs, and have to,
in essence, be willing to work.
There’s a little bit of legislative history that
says this is not for the involuntarily unemployed. And I think
that the brief points it out quite clearly, that* in essence,
what they're saying is that they have a bona fide — you cannot
reject a job, bona fide job offer, and still stay in this
program. To reject it, there's a 30-day disqualification
pex~iod.
So if on© of the fathers in this'case, Mr. Francis,
the striker, for example, if he rejected another job that the
State offered him, he will be disqualified from receiving —
having his children receive these benefits for thirty days.

37

QUESTION: But not after that?
MR. BROWN: But not after that, unless he rejects
another one.
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

Unless he does it again.
Unless he does it again.

Sorae argument was made in essence by, I think, the
Chamber of Commerce that somebody who is on strike is in
essence rejecting a job.

Well, he may — even assume that

he did reject the job, but there's a 30-day waiting period
anyway. So there would be an overlap between the disqualifica­
tion period and tee 30-day wait.
If there are no further questions, I have nothing
further to suggest.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

MR. BROWN: Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Do you have anything
further, Mr. Rabin?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL J. RABIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RABIN:

Just a few remarks, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think I should point out to the Court that,
although the Solicitor General is correct that the Maryland
rule operate on tee basis of disqualification of unemployment
insurance, it's also true that the reasoning teat applies to
that part of the regulation would probably have an impact as

38

to the validity of the second part of the HEW regulation on
disqualification, namely, participation in labor disputes.
And, in fact, if the Court upheld the HEW regulation, that
would, I think, would dispose of the issue entirely.
There was a pending regulation by HEW which, in
light of the lower court's decision, proposed mandating
payments to persons who are disqualified from unemployment
compensation, except those persons who were participating in
a labor dispute.

But the Secretary chose to hold up action

on that regulation, pending the outcome of this case,
I do want to indicate my agreement with the major
thrust of Justice Relinquish's question, and point out that in
the legislative history it's quite clear that Congress was
thinking about the unemployment compensation scheme because,
in fact, President Kennedy, in his statement proposing the
program, used as an example a person who had exhausted his
unemployment compensation benefits0
It is true that there are certain differences between
these two -types of programs. But it is also true that the
programs are very interrelated, and there is a substantial,
overlap.
For example, there is a substantial work experience
requirement in the AFDC-UF program, which, in most cases, under
many State laws, would make the person eligible for unemploy"
ment insurance

39

It's also true that in many States, including
Maryland, the benefits you receive under unemployment compensa­
tion are affected by the number of children in your family?
that is v;hat is called a dependency allowance.

So I don't

think that you can say that the programs are unrelated, or
that they are totally different.

They are both income

maintenance programs designed to assist persons who have a
substantial connection with tine work force and who are now
unemployed, and it's our contention that their major thrust
is to assist those persons who are unemployed as a result of
no fault of theii own * involuntarily unemployed as the Java
decision itself pointed out.
Therefore, we contend it is reasonable to permit the
States to do, in the similar program, what the States have
already done in the other program; namely, decided not to
encourage or not to at least pay benefits to certain persons
for conduct which they considered operates contrary to the
basic thrust of the program.
I do also want to mention that I think that word of
art is a good phrase, used by my colleague, which is exactly
what the Congress had in mind when they passed the statute.
That is why they gave legislative type of rule-making authority
to the Secretary.
In fact, the rule-making authority given to the
Secretary under Section 407, it is my understanding, is much

40

broader than the authority that the National Labor Relations
Board has under the National Labor Relations Act to define
employees»
But the opinions of this Court make clear that he
*

does have broad authority to define the word "employee” in
that scheme.

And we think that with a much more direct

grant of authority in this case, the Secretary — the agency
woudl have even greater authority and even greater deference
should be paid to his judgment,, unless it is arbitrary and
capricious and beyond the bounds of the regulation.
I have no further remarks, unless there are any
questions.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2s50 o’clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
