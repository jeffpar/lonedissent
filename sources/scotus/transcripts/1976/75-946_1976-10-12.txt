MRa CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-946, City of Madison against Wisconsin Employment
Relations Commission»
Mr» Kops, you may proceed when you are ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD CHARLES KOPS, ESQ 0,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR» KOPS:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I appear here on behalf of the City of Madison, Joint
School District Number 8, and the City of Madison Board of
Education, the Appellants in this action»
This case is on appeal from a judgment of the
Wisconsin Supreme Court»
The Appellants drew into question the validity of a
State statute as applied and interpreted»

The Wisconsin

Supreme Court upheld the statute after specifically considering
the Appellants ' constitutional challenge»
Thus, this Court's jurisdiction is invoked under
Section — under Title 28, Section 1257, Subsection 2,of the
United States Code»
This case presents the question of whether a State
labor statute, as interpreted and applied, nay constitutionally
mandate that certain individuals be excluded from speaking at a
public forum, solely on the basis of the content of a proposed

4

speech*
The facts may be briefly stated as follows»

The City

of Madison Board of Education is a duly elected public body
charged with the possession, care and control of the school
affairs of the City of Madison School District.

The Board

holds regular meetings on the first and third Monday of every
month.

The Board has determined that a portion of each of

its regular meetings will be devoted to the: receipt of public
comment.

This portion of the agenda is denoted in the agenda

as "public appearances,”
At its regular meeting of December 6S 1971# a number
of people were allowed to address the Boaro»

Among those was

the president of Madison Teachers, Incorporateds the teacher
union.
The president spoke and presentee a petition to the
Board asking for a quick resolution in the current bargaining
talks that were occurring»

After the president of the teactiers c

union spoke, Albert Holmquist, another teacher, was allowed to
address the Board.
He spoke about an item that was being negotiated
between the Board and MTI and presented the results of a survey
of the teaching staff that had been circulated within the
schools.
After completion of its regular meeting, the Board
retired into executive session and discussed the status of the

5

then current negotiations with the exclusive bargaining repre­
sentative of the teachers 0
At that executive session, they prepared directions
for their negotiators, the Superintendent and adjourned»
The following day a negotiation session occurred»
The Assistant Superintendent and Superintendent gave the
directions or proposal of the Board to the teachers" represen­
tatives and discussion ensued»
Discussion concluded with tentative agreement when the
teachers accepted the Boardcs proposal*
Formal agreement was finally ratified between the
parties about a week later, on December 14, 1971»
Approximately one month later, Madison Teachers,
Incorporated, filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Employment
Relations Commission»

It alleged the Board of Education

committed an unfair labor practice when it allowed Albert
Holmquist to speak at its public meeting»
The Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission con­
cluded that the Board"s activity at its public meeting con­
stituted a prohibited labor practice and Issued the following
ord er:
"The Board shall Immediately cease; and desist from,
permitting employees, other than representatives of Madison
Teachers, Incorporated, to appear and speak at meetings of the
Board of Education on matters subject to collective bargaining

6

between :it and Madison Teachers, Incorporated»"
The Commission decision and order were affirmed by
the Circuit Court in Wisconsin»

On appeal to the Wisconsin

Supreme Court, Justice Day, writing the majority decision and
noting specifically that "all; the-.parties involved in this case
had conceded that speaking in the form of negotiating or bar­
gaining could be constitutionally restricted to the exclusive
representative of the teachers»"
QUESTION;

In that connection, then, Mr» Kops, the

Board here is not asserting any claim of its own, is it?

It's

simply asserting the rights of Mr, Holmquist?
MR» KOPS;

1 believe that the Board is able to assert

the claim not only on behalf of Mr„ Holmquist but also on its
own behalf»
QUESTION:

Have any of our cases ever sustained any

constitutional claim that was asserted by a political sub­
division of the State against the State?
MR, KOPS;

I am not aware of any decision like that»

However, Your Honor, in this particular case, the order itself
runs against the members of the Board of Education as a subdivision of the State.

I don't know of any other case 'where

that has occurred»
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting, then, that usually this

problem arises when they are on the plaintiff side?
MR» KOPS:

Yes»

That's correct»

7

This case is unusual in that the Board of Education,
as the public body, is asserting its right to listen and, indeed,
its obligation to listen to not only its employees but other
citizens.

That was the primary reason for adopting the public

appearance section of its own agenda, that it could insure
that it would receive or provide -QUESTION:

What Federal right are you asserting?

MR* KQPS:

The Federal right of free speech., First

QUESTION:

Of the School Board?

Amendment *

You are representing the School Board?
MR* KQPS: That's correct*
QUESTION:

The School Board Employment is here*

MR„ KQPS:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Now, what Federal right is the School

Board asserting?
MR* KOPS:

We are asserting the right of Mr, Holmquist

to speak and our right also to receive the information regarding;
a matter of public policy, from the citizenry*
In that sense, it is the individual right of
Mr* Holmquist —
QUESTION:

And which amendment is this you are

talking about?
MR, KQPS:

That's the First Amendment,

QUESTION:

The First Amendment, that you have a right

8

to listen,,
MR„ KOPS:

That5 s c orrec t„

QUESTION:

You have a right to hear.

MRo KOPS:

That's correcto

In fact.* a public body* under these circumstances*
almost has an obligation to listen.

They have created a public

forum by the creation of a public hearing section -tv > ’

. f, ■

QUESTION:

Who made it a public' forum*, the State of

MR. KOPS:

No* the Board of Education created the

Wisconsin?

public forum here toy setting aside a part of its meeting to
receive public comment* setting up a public hearing at each of
its regular meetings.
QUESTION:

Well* do you question that the State of

Wisconsin* through its Legislature* could have said to every
Board of Education in the State* "You will have no public
hearing section of your meeting*’?
MRa KOPS:

I think that the Board of Education can

close its meetings„
QUESTION:

Well* what if the members of the Board

wanted to open it but the State Legislature has said* "You
will not have this particular type of agenda on your meeting"?
MR. KOPS:

I think that the State-! Legislature could

mandate that* but they haven't done that in this case.
QUESTION:

But the Supreme Court of Wisconsin has* in

9

effect* construed the Wisconsin Labor Relations statute to that
effect in this case* hasn't It?
MR® KOPS:

Well* yes* but without real* as we suggest*

without real substance or backing to the rationale of their
decision®
QUESTION:

As I understand it* your claim is that

assuming that the highest court of Wisconsin has* indeed*
construed the law in that way* they cannot construe their own
State lax*/ in conflict with the Federal constitution.
MRo KOPS:

That's correct* Your Honor.

QUESTION?

Surely*, the Eoard is subject to the

limitations of the First Amendment.
MR, KOPS:

They are subject to the limitations in

the First Amendment?
QUESTION:

They are bound —

MR, KOPS:

Yes* of course* they are; as public

officials they take an oath.
QUESTION: Does your opposition raise

the question of

standing here?
MR, KOPS:

They raised the question of standing when

we sought jurisdiction of this Court.

However* this Court has

not noted probable jurisdiction and did not reserve the Issue
of standing for consideration,
QUESTION:

Is it argued here now* do you know?

MR, KOPS:

It is not argued In the briefs of the

10

Respondent „
On appeal,, the Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Day,
writing the majority opinion, noted that the parties had
conceded that negotiation or bargaining for a labor agreement
could be constitutionally restricted to the majority representa­
tive of the teachers9 and indicated that the basic question was
whether the activities of the Board at its public meeting
constituted bargaining with a minority group of employees.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kops, could I ask you one more

question?
Suppose the Board had refused permission to
Mr, Holmquist to address it.

Would it have been subject to a

1983 claim?
MR. KGPS:

That is one of the suggestions, I think,

that can be drawn and we have drawn that, or concluded that,
on the basis of your decision in Wood v. Strickland, that that
possibility does arise, although these are not exact facts.
\

In that case, the Court suggested that if the Board of
Education knowingly violated the constitutional rights of
its students, it may be subject to a personal liability action.
QUESTION:

You don’t think that Moore v. Alameda

County would cut across and against that?

MR* KQP3:

I am not certain of that, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

There (is no question but that the Board

can regulate the time, manner and place of presentation of these

11

things.

And if the Board can do it. there is no question but

the State Legislature can tell the Board that it has to do it;
is there?
MR„ KOPS:

This is not a regulation of time# place

and manner# Your Honor,

This is a total and complete pro-

hibition of the exercise of a particular forum on a selective
basis»
QUESTION:

Well# so your answer then#to Mr, Justice

Blackman's question is that on these particular facts the
Board might have been subject to a 1983 action# given the fact
that this agenda had been set aside for public discussion?
MR, K0P3;

Yes,

and every Board meeting,
sir.

Not just this agenda# though.

Each

This was part of its regular meeting#

They were bi-month -»* or twice monthly.
QUESTION!

Twice a month.

QUESTION:

But would you think the Board would be

subject to a 1983

to a claim of constitutional deprivation

if it said we are simply not going to have this as a part of
the meeting in the future?
QUESTION:

No„

MR, KOPS:

But let me suggest in response to that#

sir# that in those circumstances it would like — it would be
something similar to this:

The example of somebody shouting

"fire" in the theater and then passing a restriction closing
the theater# instead of punishing the conduct.

In other words#

12

I am suggesting that if the public forum is going to be closed.*
it must be closed to everybody.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court has not said that.

It

is only closed to a particular group, based on content of what
they might say.
QUESTION:

The School Board has two meetings, one

is public and one is private
MR. KOPS:

No.

QUESTION:

and in this case, they had a public

meeting and they heard both sides on this question involving
employment conditions.
MR, KOPS:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

And then held a private meeting from

which everybody was barred.
MR. KOPS:

A private meeting of which nobody was

I said everybody was barred.

MR, KOPS:

QUESTION:

Was this meeting called in part for

negotiations»
/
MR, KOPS:

Absolutely not. sir»

It was a regular,

publicly held,, Board meeting»
QUESTION:

How did it happen that the president of

the union was there?
MR» KOPS:

The president of the union was there

because of the exigency — exigencies of the current bargaining
situation»

There were about three or .four hundred other

teachers at the meeting*

too

14

QUESTION:

They ivere In there for negotiation and

bargaining*
MR* KOPS:
, QUESTION:

No, they were not there to bargain*
Why were they interested In bargaining?

Yon just said there was a bargaining atmospheres wasn't that
your word?
MR« KOPS:

No, I didn't say there- was a bargaining

atmosphere at that meeting*
QUESTION:

There was a bargaining; what?

MR« KOPS:

What I am -«* at the — The teachers and

the Board had been negotiating since about January of 1971»
This was December and a contract had not been reached*

An

impasse in these private bargaining sessions had occurred0
These private bargaining sessions, or where the Board
sits down with the teachers5 representatives, was not this
particular meeting*

This particular meeting xvas a regular

Board meeting.: and at each meeting, whether it was in 1970 or
'71, there was a part of the meeting set aside for public
appearances*
QUESTION:

Was it part of the meeting ~~ in any other

public meeting, was the contract discussed?
MR* KOPS:

I do not recall if prior to that year

anybody discussed -*»• •
QUESTION:

The interesting thing to me Is that you say

this is not negotiating, but you admit that right immediately

15

after the public meeting there was an executive meeting,
followed the next day by a negotiating meeting»

MR*

KOPSi

QUESTION:

Thatfls correct,
Ancl the public meeting had no connection

with it at alle
MRo KOPSs

No* it didn't*

In fact* the bargaining

session with the teachers was scheduled before the public
meeting*

It i*?as a regularly scheduled bargaining session that

was to occur the following day with the representatives of the
teachers*
1 think the public meeting and the executive session
and then immediately following a private negotiation session
with the exclusive representatives indicate:

the difference

between the forums we had»
At the public meeting* everybody was allowed to
speak and the Board was allowed to listen and did* in fact* in
this case merely listen*
The following day*at the negotiation session*the
Board did not allow Mr* Holmquist there*

The teachers were

there with Board representatives and were dealing -with the
matter —* trying to get to an agreement on collective bargaining;,
on a collective bargaining contract*
So* there is a difference in the forums*
What the State Supreme Court has said is that in a
public regular meeting a Board of Education may only selectively

16

listen to certain people, solely based on content, not even
based on their reaction because they had no reaction whatsoever
during the public appearance portion of Mr., Holmquist's talk»
QUESTION:

Counsel, don't you concede that if the

talk constitutes bargaining or negotiation that it may be
prohibited?
MRc, KOPS:

Yes, I do*

QUESTION:

Wouldn't that be a prohibition based on

the content of what is said?
MRe KOPS:

Yes, but not a unilateral discussion as

the chairman «*»
QUESTION:

But if it were, you would then agree that

some regulation of speech, based on its content, is permissible?
MRe KOPS:

That's correcte

Regulation in a negotiating

setting»
But what occured here and what's so extremely
important is that an individual provided information to a
public body, and simply by listening he has been found to have
negotiated with that individual, doing nothing more.
I think —
QUESTION:

Could Mr* Holmquist have done the same

thing by letter to the Board?
MRS KOPS;

Absolutelyo

That was one of the strange

things about the memorandum that accompanied the Wisconsin
Employment Relations Commission decision suggesting that once

17

the Board found out that Mr, Holmquist was going to talk on a
matter subject to collective bargaining* it required him to
submit that matter to them in writing.
Now* it seems to me that if you receive information
in writing or if you receive it face to face* if you take no
other action* all you are doing is receiving information andlistening* not engaging in prohibited bargaining conduct, t

I am worried about an employer being

MR» KOPS: - A public employer* as a public body* would
- -V' .

be always interested*in anything that would — any information
that would help him develop his position as a public body in
negotiations with the exclusive representative of its employees.
Here* he merely received information and that's all

19

Private sector labor relations indicates that an
employer may receive information from its employees without
violating the labor Relations Act,

In fact* the statutes of

Wisconsin and the United States regarding labor relations
specifically allow employees to present grievances to their
employers and preserve that right.
That kind of communication preserved by statute
certainly cannot be forbidden from a public employer to receive
at a public meeting* during a portion of that meeting devoted
to public hearing,
QUESTION;

But it is being denied by the State*

your State,
MRo KOPS:

Well* the State law* as interpreted and

applied* runs afoul of the First Amendment of this
Constitution* and I think of the United States Constitution,
QUESTION;

If I understand the dissenting opinion in

the Wisconsin Supi‘eme Court correctly* its main thrust is that
the action of the majority* that is* the action of the law of
Wisconsin* denies the right of the School Board to hear all
points of view* that that's the thrust of the First Amendment
claim,
MR, KOPS;

Yes* that is one of the arguments we put

QUESTI®;

But you are also relying on your ability

forward,

to assert the third party claim of Mr, Holnquisfc* I take it.

20

MR* KOPS:

That's correct*

QUESTION:

And he was not named as the respondent in

the Employment Commission case., was he?
MR* KOPS:

He was not named as a respondent*

QUESTION:

So if anybody was to raise his rights in

this proceeding., I take it it would have tc be your client*
MR * KOPS:

Abs olute2y*

QUESTION:

So far as this question goes., your case is

quite like Kllendlenst v„ Hand el., is it not?

Are you familiar

with that case?
MR* KOPS:

No, I don't —

QUESTION:

Never mind*

MR* KOPS:

I believe that this case is probably better

in line with this Court's decisions in Mosely and Grayned and
Tinker
QUESTION:

So far as the substantive constitutional

MR* KOPS:

Yes.

issue* ■

Because it was my feeling that the Wisconsin Supreme
Court decision, in this case, was wrapped up in speech, in the
speech of an employee at a public hearing of a public body,
I felt it would be essential to tell this
Court exactly what the employee said*
and a half minutes*

or read to the

It only took about two

I don't think it is important now, but a

review of those remarks, I submit, indicates that Mr

Holmquist,

21

when he spoke to the Board, was speaking as a citizen and in
a citizenship capacity, as opposed to an employee's capacity»
He was providing information to both parties regarding the
negotiation process, suggesting that there was an impasse that
had occurred and a way to provide a catalyst to get over that
particular impasse«
The peculiar and obnoxious part of the definition
that the Wisconsin Supreme Court applies to negotiation is the
premise that you negotiate with somebody when you listen to
somebody»
This definition, we submit in our brief, has been
rejected as a proper definition in private sector labor
relations»

We cited a number of cases where the private

employers have, indeed, listened or received petitions from
their employees»
It is also contrary to the statutory rights in both
Wisconsin and Federal labor statutes which preserve the right
of employees to present grievances»
Finally, the cases cited by the Appellee, Medo and
the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Medo and Emporium,

these cases

suggest that the character of the underlying conduct in order
to find negotiation is more than merely listening»
The definition, as I suggested, of negotiation as
meaning merely listening is particularly obnoxious in the public
sector because what it does is it forecloses, in this case

a

22

public hearing to a particular individual, simply on the basis
of the content of the speech he wishes to make, nothing more0
Just the speech.
This undercuts the core value of the First Amendment
to free interchange, the unfettered interchange of ideas, ideas
only o
If, indeed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court was to
appropriately define negotiation, we wouldn't run into the
constitutional collision we have in this esse.
I think this Court has been emphatic in relationship
to the kinds of rights that individuals have in public forum.
This was a classic public forum, a school fccard meeting, an
open public hearing at a school board meeting.
In this classic public forum, ceitainly speech should
not be selectively, on the basis of content and the status
supposed status of an individual -« be abridged.
\

We submit that, in conclusion, that the definition of
negotiation adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court must be
rejected as inherently unconstitutional, since it does, Indeed,
undercut our commitment to free and open debate on public
questions, since it rejects this Court's holding that teachers
have certain constitutional rights and public employers
must be responsive to these rights, and finally because it
prohibits expression in a public forum, in the absence of a
substantive, much less a weighty reason, as required in public

23

forum matters *
QUESTION:

If we should hold., Mr* Kops, that you have

no standing — the Board has no standing to assert the rights
of Holmqulst, do you then fall back on the First Amendment right
%

of members of the School Board to hear anyone they "want to hear?
MR* KOPS:

Yes, Your Honor*

Inasmuch as, as public officials, they are charged
and have obligated themselves in taking an oath to respect and
obligate themselves to implementing the rights of the First
Amendments
I would like to reserve the rest of my time*
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Kelly,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C, KELLY, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF' CF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, KELLY:

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case Involves a concept of exclusivity in the
public sector of our economy,

That concept lies at the core of

labor relations in the private sector of the economy and that
concept,simply stated, is the right of the majority of the
employees in appropriate bargaining unit to select an exclusive
representative to deal with their employer as concerns matters
of wages, hours and working conditions, not only for the majority
but for the entire collective bargaining unit.
QUESTION:

Suppose Holmquist had not been a teacher,

24

just another taxpayer, a steamfitter or a carpenter,, or what­
ever, and he had walked into the meeting, having heard that
there was a meeting, and said all of the same things that
Holmquist said*
Do you think the State of Wisconsin can forbid the
Board of Education to hear him?
MR* KELLY:

Ho, sir*

I don't*

Let me say that was not the circumstance here, by a
long shot*

Mr0 Holmquist appeared and announced in specific

words when he did appear that he did not appear as a citizen,
indeed, that he did not appear as a private; employee or an
employee of the Board, but that he's employed as a representative
of an informal committee of seventy-two teachers in forty-nine
schools,

A group of teachers, sir, he had organized into an

informal minority called. "Ecology*"

He appeared as the

representative.and agent of-a dissident minority union*
v.

i.

QUESTION:

Would there be a constitutional difference

between a minority of seventy-two and a minority of one?

Is

that your point?
MR* KELLY: Well, if he was a dissident employee
speaking as a dissident employee or a citisien, sir, 1 assume
thi

case would not be here.

The fact is that if ise approach

this from the totality of Mr* Holmquist*s conduct, he for one
month ahead of this particular School Board meeting, organized
a minority —

25

QUESTION:

It is critical to your position that he

was speaking for persons other than himself,
MR, KELLY:
QUESTION':

Yes, sir,
You would concede that if he was speaking

just for himself that he had a constitutional right to do what
he did,
MR, KELLY: . That 5s right, sir,
QUESTION:

You also agree that the Board is the

proper party to raise Holmquist's constitutional rights,,
MR, KELLY:

They may do that, sir.

We raised’ the

question of the Board ®s standing in their application to this
Court for jurisdiction.

And when this Court took jurisdiction,
t

frankly, we didn't proceed with that any further,
QUESTION: Well, with concession *— even if you win,
we have to limit the order, don't we3
MR, KELLY: Yes, sir.
Let me again speak to that,
QUESTION:
MR, KELLY:

That order, to me, is unbelievable,
That's right, sir.

Let me say that the complaint, our complaint before
the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission appears in the
record.

And the relief we sought in that complaint was as

follows:
"That an order issue requiring the Respondents to
„/•

cease and desist from negotiating now and in the future as

26

concerns questions of wages, hours and conditions of employment
with Individual employees or groups of employees»"
It is our contention, sir, if this Court finds that
Holmquist and the Board were negotiating in a prohibited sense
that the case should be remanded for a proper order based on
negotiating»
QUESTION:

I have great difficulty in finding

negotiation in a one-sided statement of two and a half minutes»
MRo KELLY:

All right, sir»

Let me say what happened
QUESTION:
MR* KELLY:

Do you/'see my problem?
Yes, sir»

What happened here was the Legislature of Wisconsin
saw fit in November, sir, to pexmit a fair share amendment, or
a fair share proposal in collective bargaining agreements»
At that time, Madison teachers submitted its third
proposal at collective bargaining*

There lad been eleven long

months of collective bargaining, sir*

At that same time, was

the same time that Mr, Holmquist organized his campaign to
dispoil or mar the collective bargaining position of the majority
that was to incorporate a collective bargaining agreement,
He prepared some letters.

He circulated those letters to all

of the teachers in Madison public schools*
He prepared anti-fair share and anti-union literature,,
He requested from the school district the pernission to circulate

27

that material to the bargaining unit teachers through the school
mail, even though the collective bargaining agreement then in
existence between the Board and the schools prohibited that.
He asked for and received permission to circulate his
anti-fair share material in the schools without regard to
working or non-working areas.

He furnished the administration

or the principals of those buildings copies of his material8
They were aware of the material that he had «
As a matter of fact* officers of the union spoke to
the Assistant Superintendent of the Schools and asked that they
not cooperate in the anti-fair share compaign.
QUESTION:

It 3tiXl brings me to the point of what

in his two and a half minutes was different from what he had
been saying all along?
MR* KELLY:

Well* his position was that he wanted

fair share deferred for another year and that's what he asked
the Board to do and that's what they did,, sir.

They went from*

immediately from —
QUESTION:

Hadn't the Board been told that was his

position?
MRS KILLY:
QUESTION:

Well* let me say -«
Didn't they read this material?

MR* KELLY:

No* he stated it to them* sir.

In a very

charged atmosphere -«

Yes, sir.

Well, you didn't get any relief on that

and you didn't appeal, so -«
MR» KELLY:

We didn't ask relief.

That was part of

the totality of conduct that the Board —
QUESTION:

I am still having trouble with this two

and a half minutes being negotiating»
MR» KELLY:

Well, I think, sir, that listening --

negotiations is, I suppose, synonymous -«
QUESTION:

Do you say the School Board can't listen

to it?
MR* KELLY:

Well, not to the extent that they allow

themselves to foe influenced to change their bargaining position...
sir®

29

QUESTION:

If a stranger* had made the same remarks

that Holmqulsfc did, a Madison taxpayer said, "I just don't
believe in this fair share proposition.n
Now, you concede the Board could have changed its
posture and reliance on that sort of —
MR, KELLY:

Yes, sir,

I doubt they would, sir.

What happened here was we had *»«*
QUESTION:
issue.

What they would have done isn't the

The question of Justice Rehnquist is:

Could this

taxpayer, as I tried to discuss before, just any other person
come in and say these things and could any law of Wisconsin
stop that utterance and stop the right of the Board to listen
to it?
MR, KELLY:

No, sir.

They could not.

If the Board heard that at a public meeting and they
were interested in that they could hear it*
QUESTION:

What is the Board comp lair ing about?

Are they not complaining that they have been forbidden
to hear?
MR. KELLY:

We take the position, sir, that they

did more than hear, that they negotiated.
QUESTION:

Mr, Kelly, does not paragraph 1 of the

order prohibit more than negotiation?
MR, KELLY:
and that's unfortunate

The order of the Commission does, sir.

30

QUESTION:

Do you concede it is too broad to-be

constitutional, then?

MR,

KELLY;

Yes, sir* I doc

And that Es why we asked

that and I am-asking now that if this Court finds that there
was, indeed* negotiation and that Holmquisffe conducts therefore*
lias negotiating and was hot entitled to full First Amendment
protection, that the remedy, be to remand the ease with instruefelons to enter an order consistent, for example, with what we
asked for in our complaint, that the Board not negotiate with
the minority, sir,
QUESTION; But in your brief you ask that the Judgment
of the Wisconsin Supreme Court be affirmed
You are retracting from that *
MRo KELLY:

Yes, sir.

To that extent, if the Court would find that there
was, indeed, bargaining, that that be the remedy, sir0
QUESTION;

Well, does your position now mean that

terms such as "bargaining" and "negotiation" become issues of
Federal constitutional law?

That this Court must find that

either there was or there was not bargaining?
MR, KELLY:

Yes, sir.

It is my understanding that the

exclusivity doctrine, at least in the negotiating and bargaining
areas, as I understand it, sir*
QUESTION;

Mr, Kelly, maybe I don8t correctly under-

stand what your Supreme Court held, but as I read the opinion of

31

majority, the majority found that there was, indeed,, an invasion
of First Amendment rights here,
MR, KELLY:
QUESTI OH:

Yes* sir,
— They found there

vse.s

but they said

that this order was justified — perhaps, it is overbroad, as
you now concede ~~ on the ground under the clear and present
danger test.

There was involved a State interest, namely, that

bargaining should be limited to the majority representative,
MRo KELLY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
Arid to that extent, this order was
/

Justified to prevent that invasion of the State interest,
MR, KELLY:
QUESTION:

Wasn't that it?

MR, KELLY:
QUESTION:

Yes* sir.
Applying the clear and present danger test,

MR. KELLY:
QUESTION:
there and said,

That's right, sir,

Yes, sir.

Dennis v, United States test,

Now, if an ordinary taxpayer walked in

"I don't like," as Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc was

suggesting to you,

!!X don't like these kinds of contracts and

I am speaking for myself and 142 or 232 other citizens who
signed this petition and we are just telling you* the Board,
you shouldn't make this kind of a contract,"
Do you regard that as negotiating?
MR, KELLY:

No, sir,

I do regard it as negotiating*

sir* when a minority is organized just as any minority union

32

would be# with the purpose of upsetting or disturbing the
majority position# which they successfully did here9
As I have said# or would say# whet happened here was
Mr, Holmquist asked — Let me say this# that after eleven
months of negotiating here# sir# there were thirteen issues
left unresolved*

Just eleven hard months of negotiating*

One of the issues# a major issue# was fair share# and a second
major issue was the binding arbitration of teacher dismissals
and non-renewals*

They were both key issues„

And the Board had been firm on both of those for
eleven months*

The Board at one time had unofficially indi­

cated that they would consider granting fair share# but that
they would in no way grant binding arbitration*
Mi'» Holmquist specifically asked# in his remarks#
that the fair share be deferred for a year*

Immediately after

hearing him in public session and asking to receive his
petitions# the Board went into executive session*

And in that

executive session, they discussed ongoing negotiations with
the Madison teachers# that which had been going on for eleven
months.
And during that discussion they passed a resolution*
And that resolution was that we will now giant, for the first
time# binding arbitration# but we will not grant fair share*
It is our position that listening# in that extent#
allowing themselves to be influenced by the minority# those

33

people interested in wages* hours and conditions in that school
district* was, indeed, bargaining»
QUESTION;

VJhat if the Wisconsin Legislature, instead

of passing a little NLRB in effect for public workers had
passed a law saying that we think stability in labor relations
in the public sector will best be produced by having absolutely
no union and no school board is free to even discuss the matter
of a union with any of its employees«
And Mr» Holmquist, or his counterpart, had gotten up
at a meeting like this and said, "I think we ought to have a
union in this schoolAnd then action was taken against him
for making this sort of a speech»

Jo you think the Supreme Court of Wisconsin would be
upheld here if it said that, true, there was an infringement
on his First Amendment right, but the public policy of this
State is that there aren't going to be any unions, his speech
had a tendency or was in imminent danger of producing a countervalence of that policy and, therefore, we will sanction his
punishment«
MR, KELLY:

No, sir»

I guess what I see in this case and have seen, sir,
is that -«*
QUESTION;

You say, "No, sir»1’

Actually the issue before us is whether this was the
proper case for the application of the clear and present danger

34

test, isn't it?
MR» KELLY:
QUESTION:
MR, KELLY:
QUESTION:

Thafc5 s right, sir„
That?s-all it ls«
That is rights sir,
Weil, isn't that the Issue that would be

presented by the hypothetical my brother

Relinquish, has just

posed to you?
MR, KELLY:

Not as I understood him.

Maybe I didn't

understand him»
QUESTION:

I intended the way Mr„ Justice Brennan

understood it.
Supposing the clear and present clanger to stability
of labor relations in Mr* Hoimquistfe remarks arose not from
the fact that he was negating the idea of only majority
representative bargaining, but that he was coming at it from
quite a different point of view*

He was urging unions

*

where the State had said there will be no unions,
bo you think that kind of a decision, suppressing
him for that reason, could foe upheld?
MRa KELLY:

In the balance, I don't think that that

would foe a violation of the clear and present danger test.
What I feel **“■ In other words, what I am saying is, sir, that
exclusivity has recognized the right of the majority and the
reason that is permitted, an invasion of free speech, at all,
is to prevent the dangers of relative chaos in labor relations.

35

It is my feeling* and it is our position* that when
there is a majority union present in. this kind of circumstance
and a minority union or a minority group, is allowed to organize
and to -work against its position* and undermine its position*
that would lead to chaos in the labor relations sector,, sir0
QUESTION:

Mr0 Kelly* suppose that Mr. Holmquist*

rather than appearing before the Board* had published an
advertisement in the morning paper the same day of the Board
meeting., the advertisement being specifically addressed to the
Board and consisting of precisely what was said in the two and
a half minute statement to the Board.

o..:

r :

Could your Commission have moved against
Mr. Holmquist?

Could it have enjoined further

advertising?
\

Would this be analogous to the statement before the Board
itself?
MR. KELLY:
in the balance.

No* sir.

There* again* I think it, is

The fact is that —

QUESTION:
MR. KELLY:

No* sir* what?
No* sir* they could not move against

Mr. Holmquist.
QUESTION:

In other words* he could advertise all he

wanted in the newspaper?
MR. KELLY:
QUESTION:
teachers?

Yes* sir.
Even on behalf of a group of minority

36

MR* KELLY:
QUESTION;

That is correct* sir,
Mr, Kelly* I have some difficulty under»

standing what we are saying when we talk about clear and
present danger.
Speech may be prohibited if there is a clear and
present danger of what?

Is it clear and present danger that

the Board might not accept the union's demands* or is it
clear and present danger that the union may no longer be in a
position to speak for the majority?
MR» KELLY:

That's one* sir.

The other thing I

could see* for instance —
QUESTION:
a lot of examples.

Well* which is it here?

I don't want

What is your position here?

Curtailment of speech is justified because there was
a clear and present danger of something.
MR. KELLY: Of chaos in the labor relations in
Madison* Wisconsin* because in the collective bargaining process
the majority union was not going to obtain a collective bar­
gaining agreement.
QUESTION:

By chaos* you mean the Beard would not

accept the union's demand.
MR. KELLY:

Yes* sir* and that might lead to* as it

has in some —
QUESTION:

So any time that speech might persuade the

Board not to accept a demand* that could be prohibited?

37

MRe KELLY:

Well, sir, 1 think it's «— not from

the citizenry, but from a dissident union, a dissident union
group, yes, sir»
QUESTION;

Well, what difference does it make if it

is a dissident union?

If any individual creates a clear and

present danger of the evil that you describe, why can't the
speech be prohibited?
MR» KELLY;

Well, I expect, sir, that in a practical

sense, It is the minority union that creat€is the clear and
present danger rather than some Individual citizen.

It is

the minority union working within the majority that has the
clout to do that, sir„
QUESTION:

By clout

No,you simply mean that they

may persuade the Board not to go along with the majority's
request.
MRo KELLY;

Whatever that causes by undermining the

relationship that that minority has with the majority and the
inability of —- to have peaceful labor relations in that
community, sir.
QUESTION:

It seems to me you are saying that any

argument can be prohibited if it is apt to be successful.

MR* KELLY; No, sir, I am not.

I guess I am saying

that I feel that the conduct of these folks in their totality
was bargaining and that collective bargaining is restricted to
the majority representative.

QUESTION:

his record that he represented anybody„

Well, he filed a petition or —
Said he dido
He proposed to file a petition that night-,

that he had 417 signatures»
QUESTION:

It might have just been nonsense»

QUESTION:

As a matter of law, he could not speak

for these people if there was another exclusive bargaining
representative.

Isn't that perfectly clear?

He could not bind anyone in the union»
MR* KELLY:

No, sir, he couldn't bind them but he

could spoil a union's position, any more than in the private
sector of a union working with the employer can undemine and
upset the union's collective bargaining position,
QUESTION:

He can do anything but speak at that

Board meeting®
MR, KELLY:

I beg your pardon, sir®
He can do anything except speak at the

doesn't it?

It doesn't run against him,

MR, KELLY;
QUESTION:

Yes,

And that's —

That's the reason all these hypothetical

questions about what could you do to Mr, Holmquist —
MR0 KELLY:

Our position was, sir, that the Board In

listening to him and in aiding and abetting him was collective
bargaining with the minority,
QUESTION:

If you want to redraw the Board's order,

how would you redraw it?
MR, KELLY:

Pretty much in the terms that we

originally asked for it, that the Board cease negotiating with
the minority union, sir,
QUESTION:
they negotiated,

I have great difficulty In finding that

I still — let me put it this way — I am

not saying — I learned long ago not to say it never happened
— but I have never heard of a negotiating session of two and
a half minutes,
MR, KELLY:
QUESTION:

No, sir,
It takes that long to say how do you do,

(laughter)
MR, KELLY:
QUESTION:
MR, KELLY;

Negotiating «Well, that's what you called negotiating.
No, sir,

I am calling the totality of

40

the conduct negotiating0
I think negotiating is a very sophisticated and very
subtle process that is influenced by many things, by what people
see, by what they hear as well as by what they say, indeed by
body language»

I take the position that negotiating can take

place not only at the collective bargaining table but that it
can take place In the hall or on the street, wherever people
see each other, and particularly in negotiations as I know them;i
in Madison, Wisconsin, that take a year to achieve a collective
*

bargaining agreement, sir»
QUESTION:

Well, then, you say the School Board can

negotiate every place except the public meeting*

That's where

I get all confused»
MR, KELLY:

No, sir*.

I say they can't negotiate

with the minority union at any place or time*

MRe KELLY:

Well, they can read the newspaper»
I don't think putting that in the news­

paper is negotiating, sir»
QUESTION:

What Is negotiating?

That's what I am

I got the two and a half minutes»

Now, what

other negotiating did the School Board do with this man?

And that, I submit, is all that :1s before us,
MR„ KELLY:
QUESTION:
MR» KELLY:

Well, I —
Do you agree?
No, sir, I feel that what8s before you is

whether the conduct of the parties, the Board, in its totality,
was collective bargaining.

If it was, then we are entitled to

have it limited to the majority representative.

If it was not,

sir, then it was First Amendment area and there could be an

Mr„ Kops, you have four

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD CHARLES KOPS, ESQ0,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRo KOPS:
Doints

Mr, Chief Justice, I just have about three

42

One* I believe Mr. Justice Marshall is correcto
totality of the conduct is not before this Court,,

The

What is

before this Court is the Wisconsin Supreme Court's definition
of negotiation*

That definition of negotiation creates an

unconstitutional Intrusion, in our view, with the First
Amendment rights*

And, in that sense, a mere remand of the

order, without instructions that such a definition creates
that constitutional intrusion, would be unfortunate in the
Appellant's view.
Mr* Kelly, apparently, has retreated from the position
that the order ought to be. affirmed.

Let rae suggest that the

totality of the bargaining conduct, the totality of the conduct
that Mr, Kelly suggests is bargaining cannot be sustained.
What occurred was a circulation of a petition in non-working
areas on non-working times in the school.

This was found by

Jusfc5.ce Day in the opinion.
If we take a look at your decision in the NRLB v„
Magnavox, this Court has recognized that communication between
employees at the work place in non-working areas in non^-working
times is something that is permissible under Federal labor
statutes.

That communication is important in order to prevent

Intrenchmenfc of the majority representative.

So that aspect

of the totality of the conduct is inappropriate for considera­
tion here.
QUESTION:

But the fact that it is permissible under

Federal labor statutes doesn't mean that the State of Wisconsin
has. to allow it under State labor statutes# does it?
MR, KOPS:

That's correct* but to suggest that to

allow it was before the Court* or that issiie was before the
Court*is not correct.

The only issue before the Wisconsin

Supreme Court was the issue of negotiation «
The other way* supposedly* that the Board aided and
abetted Mr, Holmquist, was to allow the use of mailboxes,
I suggest the Board of ~~
QUESTION:

May I ask you a question?

Even if you are all wrong about whether this was
bargaining or not -« or put it another way -® even if we are
concluded by that holding of your Supreme Court that this
constitutes bargaining* isn't there still a question here
whether the First Amendment would permit that kind of pro­
hibition at a public meeting?
MR, KOPS:

Yes,

And I think --

QUESTION:

Are you arguing that# too?

MR, KOPS;

Yes# we are arguing that and I didn't get

a chance to devote any time to it in the oral argument but I

believe we adequately cover it in our brief# or attempt to.
One final word,
Mr, Kelly and myself have been accorded by this Court
an opportunity for now almost an hour to engage in colloquy and
question and answers and yet I don't believe there is any member

of this Court or anyone in the courtroom who would believe
that what Mr 0 Kelly and I were doing was negotiating with
this Court with regard to the order or its decision»
That's essentially what Mr# Holmquist did*

He talked

to the Board of Education and nothing more#
