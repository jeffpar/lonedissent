P R O CE E DI S G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

W© will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 75-929, Estelle against Gamble.
Mr. Pluymen, you may proceed whenever you ar© ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT W. PLUYMEN ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PLUYMEN:
th© Court:

Mr. Chief- Justic®, and may it please

This case arose when the respondent- J. W. Gamble,

filed an action under 42 U.S.C.

sac. 1983 in th© United States

District Court for th© Southern District of Tessas alleging
inadequate medical treatment for a back injury which he has
sustained

and filing suit against th© Director of the Texas

Department of Corrections , th© warden of his unit, the medical
director, who was also th© chief medical officer of

th®

prison hospital-,
Th® district court, without requiring the State to
file a response, without asking for any response, summarily
dismissed the .complaint for failure to stats a claim on which
relief could b® granted.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit subsequently reversed and remanded 'the case with
instructions to reinstate th© complaint, appoint counsel, and
permit amendment.
Your Honors, the crux of this case is whether th©
Federal district courts will in th© future in the Fifth

4
circuit sit as a medical review board to review the diagnosis
and treatment by doctors in correctional institutions or
whether the Federal courts in the Fifth Circuit will operate
within the confines of the limitations imposed by the
Constitution and by the jurisdictional part of section 1983#
which is 28 U.S.C. 1343.
In looking at a complaint# it is established law by
this Court that a complaint should not be dismissed summarily
unless it is beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no facts
in support of his claim which will entitle him to relief°
In the area of prisoner medical car© there are only two places
in the Constitution where a claim could possibly bs stated.
%

One is underneath the Eighth Amendment cruel and. unusual
punishment clauses the other is under the Fourteenth Amendment
dua process clause# a section relating to life.
QUESTION?

Your brief# I believe# indicates that

because of changes in the creation of administrati'?e procedures,
this kind of problem will tend to go away in the future.

Is

that —
MR. PLUYMEN:
brief.

No# your Honor# 'that is in respondent's

I fail to see how the creation of administration

procedures will be helpful in terms of an issue whether a
complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted.
QUESTIONi

You don't question ~ or do you question

his outline of the administrative procedures that have now

5
been established to deal with these problems?
MR. PLUYMRNj

No, your Honor, I do not, except for

one instance, and that is that at the time when 'this complaint
was filed in 1973, fell© grievance procedure which was subsequently
written into the rules and regulations, in other words, the
appeal to the warden, then to the director, and the director
sending someone down from his staff to investigate the
complaint, those were in effect in 1973 and have been for
quite a while.
regulations.

They were merely made written rules and
They went through the formal procedure of passing

it through the board.
I do not see how, when the question comes up as to
whether a claim has been stated, how the existence or non­
existence of a grievance, procedure would help in any matter.
As a matter of fact, under both the grievance procedure and
that inmate legal assistance project which was cited in
respondent’s brief, the inmate does not have to utilize either
on®.

He can go directly into Federal court, and file a complaint.

And the established law in that area right now is that no
exhaustion is required, under section 1983, the latest ruling,
as the Court knows, being McCray v. Burrell toy the Fourth Circuit»
QUESTION:

If this Court should decide that his

• administrative remedies had to be exhausted and utilised first,
to.what extent do you think that would solve this problem?
MR. PLUYMEN:

As far as a flood of litigation in

6
Federal courts- is concerned, which the district courts have
experienced over th© last fives .or six years, I think it. would
help tremendously«

Minnesota has had experience with it»

Maryland has had experience with it.

An independent grievance

type of procedure has helped tremendously in reducing 'the
burden on the Federal courts, and also the States.
But as an alternative, your Honor, th® Stat® of
Texas has a Tort Claimp Act which inmates are presently
utilizing to sue th® State,

It's Article 6252-19.

In addition

to being able to su® th© State itself and obtain money out of
the coffers of the State, th® inmate has( the regular common
law tort remedy to sue th© doctor individually.
So it is petitioners5 position that th© respondent in
fact has State remedies and that, th© Constitution itself, and
Federal courts should not under the Eighth Amendment or 14th
Amendment hear ordinary negligence or medical malpractice or
tort claims.
QUESTION?

Would th® physician6 s claim of privilege

in tills sort of action or defense b© any different by virtue
of th® fact that h© was employed by th© Stat® of Texas?
MR. PLUYMEN:

The only thing th® Tort Claims Act

does, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is it establishes liability on
the part of th® State itself.

Th@r@ is an alternative.

You

can either try to take the money out; of th© doctor’s pocket, or
under th® Tort Claims Act take it; out

oS

th® State coffers.

7
QUESTIONS

But if th© physician would be liable on
#

the facts, then that liability is assumed by the State the same
way it is under the Federal Tort Claims Act?
MR. PLUYMEN:
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor, that is correct.

Mr. Attorney General, while you are

interrupted, would you help me on the procedure hers.

The

complaint was filed, as I read the record, I think February,
and the magistrate mad® a recommendation in June, and them - the
district judge dismissed the complaint.

What happened between

February and June as to why the State didn't file a motion of
any kind, or didn't answer?
MR. PLUYMEN:

Mr. Justice Stevens, apparently th©

complaint was never sent by the district court to our office.
The first time that w© ©v@r saw anything about the cas© or
heard anything about the cas© was whan an appeal was filed.
■ QUESTION;
Texas?

What is the practice in this district in

Does 'the complaint just get filed,

or is it somehow or

other screened by a magistrate for leave to file in' soars© way?
It was a little pussling to m® to try to figure out what
happened.
MR. PLUYMENs
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

Is 'there an automatic provision in the

rules down there for you to be served when something is filed
against —
MR. PLUYMEN:

Your Honor, the practice in the Texas

8
courts is to refer the case to a magistrate, both the habea
corpus cases and th© 1983 cas®s»
QUESTION;

For what purpose?

MR. PLUYMEN;
QUESTION;

For screening.

And supposing they find no merit, them

do they deny leave to file, or —
MR. PLUYMEN;

Th© magistrate will recommend either

to deny relief to file or to grant relief to file.

What

usually occurs is that th© magistrate will recommend to the
court — give a list of recommendations and conclusions, and
h© will recommend generally — I have never seen one other­
wise — that the petition be filed, and there is an in forma
pauperis

question in almost all of these things that has

to be decided one way or the other.

There is some determina-

tio'ri mad© as to whether an inmate in fact happens to be a
pauper.

We hav© had some problems with that»

to b@ decided.

So that has

Also, th© question as to whether counsel

should be appointed in the case ©v@n though, you know, there* is
no Federal statute which provides for reimbursement.
QUESTION;

But that is all don© in advance of any

service or notice to fch® defendants?
MR. PLUYMEN;
across the board.

I cannot honestly answer that question

I know it happened in this case.

We did

not receive anything.
QUESTION;

This is not, a sport? I mean, this is th©

9
way it is don® frequently in tills district, is it?
MR. PLUYMENs
really not answer -that.
QUESTION:

I aia not sur®, your Honor.

1 could

I just don2t —

Th® reason I raise it,this practice had

bean followed in the Seventh Circuit and was challenged at on®
time.

I was just wondering if it had ©ver -been challenged ir

that district.
MR. PLUYMENs

Ho, it .has not.

the question, but I cannot.

I wish 1 could answer

We received the complaint, and

generally in both habeas corpus eases and section 1983 cases ~»
I know in habeas corpus cases you get the recommendafcion, you
are served before the magistrate ever gets into the act.

In

th© northern districts —- all tb.e cases I have aver handled,
you go ahead and receive th® complaint without ever hearing
anything from the court, and you. go ahead and answer it.

In

this case I don’t know what happened, whether it got sent
elsewhere or what.
QUESTION:

The magistrate s@®ms to have corresponded

with the prisoner without corresponding with th© defendants.
In other words, h© asked him if he had any other information,
but he didn’t ask fell® defendants if they wanted to file the
medical records or anything lik® that.
MR. PLUYMENs
QUESTION:

Your Honor, my

Which saems a little bit unusual.

MR. PLUYMENs

My oc^ceunsel just passed mm a note — I

10

am a little nervous this morning ~
QUESTION?

I am not being critical»

I am just

trying to figure out what happened.
MR. PLUYMEN:

My mind is not working too clearly.

Hopsfuliy it will be better as I go along.

But in 1983 cases

the defendant has to h© served, the defendants themselves.
And the way w© operate is that in habeas corpus cases —
QUESTION;

This was a 1983 casi«

MR. PLUYMEN;

Tills was a 1983 cas© , right.

trying to make a distinction.

I was

But in 1983 casas the defendant

has to be served, and we don't automatically represent the
defendants who

are sued.

In other words, they have to request

our office for representation.
QUESTION;

Sc th© defendant ~

Even the Director of the Department of

Corrections?
MR. PLUYMEN;

Right, even th© Director has to request

representation, because there are numerous cases where they
will retain private counsel, in 1983 casesf th© number of
defendants that we represent, like the Highway Patrol.
QUESTION;

I see.

QUESTION;

So you don’t have any complaint.

You were

served.
MR. PLUYMEN;

I don’t even know whether we were

served with th© complaint or not.
QUESTION;

Who do you represent here?

11
MR. PLUYMEN:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I represent the

petitioners, the Director —
QUESTIONS

Well, you don"t have a complaint that the

petitioner wasn't served.
MR. PLUYMEN?
about that.

The petitioner was served.

That is correct.

I had no complaint

Mr. Justice Stevens was inquiring as to the

procedure that occurred in ‘this case, and I just frankly don't
know.
QUESTION s

Mow I am confused.

Is there some procedure

requiring the grant by a magistrate of leave to file a 1983
complaint?
MR. PLUYMEN;
QUESTION;

No, your Honor.

In other words, the plaintiff — this

was a handwritten one, wasn't it?
MR. PLUYMEN;
QUESTION;

Yes, vcur Honor, it was.

2\nd it was — doubtless it had to be

served on these petitioners.
MR. PLUYMEN;
QUESTION:

That is correct.

But what you are tailing us is whether or

not your office gets it to defend the petitioners depends on
your being requested to represent the defendants, is that it?
MR. PLUYMEN:
QUESTIONs

That is correct, your Honor.

And you never head of this ease until

there was an appeal?
MR. PLUYMEN;

That’s correct.

12
QUESTION •

Who represented the petitioners in the

district court?
MR. PLUYMENs

Apparently ther© was no need t©

represent the petitioners in the district court because«the
district court summarily dismissed without requiring a response.
QUESTION;

And it was when the appeal was taken to

the Court of Appeals that you first heard of it, is that it?
MR. PLUYMEM:
QUESTION :

That is correct, your Honor.

And does your office always represent

defendants in cases like this in the Court of Appeals at least?
MR. PLUYMEN:

Not necessarily.

As a practical

matter, most of idle defendants will request our representation
in the vast majority of cases.

There are some who retain

private counsel.
Even if the Stats had been required to ~
QUESTION?

Can you give u.s any case her© where the

Attorney General didn21 represent Mr. Estelle?

Any on© I have

seen the Attorney General represented him.
MR. PLUYMEN:

Mr. Estel.1© is sued thousands of times.

He is the named defendant in every habeas corpus and ©very
civil rights case filed in the institution.
QUESTION:

Who else represents him if th® Attorney

General does not?
MR. PLUYMEN:

Private counsel would.

I know of no

case, Mr. Justice Marshall, where Mr.*. Estelle has requested

13
anyon© other than our office to represent him,
QUESTION;

I thought so»

QUESTION:

what you are suggesting is perhaps that

other .defendants than Estes lie, like the Board of Regents or
other people who might ba party to 1983 actions —
MFu PLUYMENs
QUESTION:

That's correct.

— under Texas law might have other

counsel.
MR. PLUYMEN:

For example, the highway patrolmen

frequently have private counsel.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney Saneral, I don't mean to

belabor the point, but you assume that Mr. Estelle was served.
I wonder if that's a valid assumption.

This is an in forma

I assum® th© parshal wouldn't go out

with a summons unless he-got his fees. And the recommendation
that h© b® given permission to proceed in forma pauperis by
th® magistrate is in th® same order in which h® recommended
that th® proceeding b® dismissed, which may explain why your
f

clients never heard of the case until it was on appeal.
,

MR. PLUYMEN:

curious about it.

It may explain it. I was really

I know our office never heard of to® case

until it was on appeal.
QUESTION:

But I am just wondering if they are

following rule 4 th@r© about automatically issuing summons
or what they do.

And it seams to me, as I read this case, it

14
is a pleading ease* and her® w@ are. arguing the substance afid
a lot of facts and all, and I was wondering why there was
nothing at all filed by th© State .

It seems to rne that may

be significant.
But th© answer is you didn't know about th® case.
MR. PLUYMENs
th© reason.

VI© didn't know about th© case.

That53

It wouldn't make any difference as far as

suhstanc® is concerned whether the State were required to fil®
a response or not.

If th© State cam© back and filed a’motion

to dismiss for failure to state a claim, we would end up with
the same result.
QUESTION?

You would, but perhaps you would have

filed the medical records.

You might have had a differant

record before us, instead of just having prisoner allegations.
W© don't know what you would have filed.
MR. PLUYMENs
QUESTION;

That's true.

You might have investigated and find,

well, there is something here.

W© don’t have any way of knowing

what you would hav© done had you been served in th© normal
course.
QUESTION %

I take it th® court of appeals just took

it as if there had been a motion to dismiss filed; all the
allegations in th© complaint were taken as true, and they
nonetheless held that that stated s claim for relief.
MR. PLUYMENs

That's correct.

15
Petitioner's position is that when a district court
gets a coraplaint which on its face clearly fails to state a,
claim upon which relief could be granted, it has the power to
dismiss it without waiting for a motion to dismiss..
QUESTIONS

You disagree with th© result reached by

the court of appeals on th© lav;?
MR» PLUYMEN:

That's correct,

And the court of

appeals9 opinion, and also the respondent's brief, it's very
difficult for anyone arguing that there is a claim stated here
to get away from a difference of opinion and a disagreement as
far as diagnosis and treatment is concerned,

Th© petitioners*

brief outlines th© general rule stated by eight circuit
courts of appeals when a motion to dismiss is filed or when a
claim is filed

and th© court looks at it and decides to go

ahead and dismiss it for failure to state a claim, a summary
dismissal, in other words.

That, particular test to get under­

neath either the Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment
or th® 14th Amendment is, number one, if there is a total failure
or refusal to provida medical car®, that presumably would be
an Eighth Amendment violation.

It might also be a 14th

Amendment violation,
QUESTIONS

Do you agree with that or not?

on at least eight different occasions? they responded very
quickly.

h® requested a hospital pass, they gave him one immediately,
they didn’t make him work any longer.

H® went to the hospital,

he was checked for a hernia, h© was sent to his cell.

QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General, what if the Fifth

Circuit's opinion said th® rule in this circuit is that you
state a 1983 cause of action when there has been a total
failure to treat, you don't states on© when you allege only
negligent failure, and w© construe this complaint to allege .a
total failure.

Now, would you petition for c@rt on that

ground?
MR. PLUYMENs
QUESTION;

Y@s, your Honor.

Incidentally, I not® at A-31 that the

court of appeals apparently read this as reading “general

we hav© two or three of them, in which the Justice Department
is involved - in extensive discovery , that would be relevant,
and it would be tried at the district court level.

by respondent to th© Fifth Circuit.

report to a committee in th© prison reform —

That is referred to, I gather, in footnote 1?

QUESTION:

MR. PLUYMENs

The issue in 'this case is whether a

petitioners just fail to see hem it is any way possible to

You say that is impossible with th&

MR. PLUYMEMi

Well, in petitioners9 statement of

facts w@ set out some of it.

In respondent's statement of

facts, some other parts of it are sat out.
QUESTION:

Neither is complete.

Material submitted to the court of appeals

by appendix that wasn't in the pleadings is that Citizens
Advisory Committee report, isn't it, not the sequence of
treatment, which is — the sequence of treatment is in the
complaint.
MR, PLUYMEN:
QUESTION:

It's in the complaint.

What you are saying, aren't you, is that

even if the medical car© in Texas prisons generally is
inadequate, teat on the complaint filed here there is no
showing, no allegation that the court can act upon.

22
MR» PLUYMENs

That's correct., your Honor,

It is

complet®ly irrelevant.
QUESTION:

I thought also your claim was it is a

legal matter that an allegation of inadequate car© was
insufficient to state a claim under the Federal Civil Rights
Act,

Ai allegation of either- inadequate-care or negligent car®

was insufficient to state a Federal claim, wasn't that your
point?
MR, PLUYMENs

That -s the point.

Eight courts of

civil appeals —
QUESTION:

Is that your position?

MR, PLUYMENs

That's the position,

QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

QUESTION:

Mr, Attorney General, is there any way

that you and the respondent can get us a translation of this
that you will agree on?
MR, PLUYMENs

I th'ink w@ could probably have it typed

up, your Honor.
QUESTION:

That you both agree is what was said.

MR. PLUYMENs

We* of course* ax© dealing with the facts* but under

Conley v. Gibson I guess the test that is sufficient is whether
under any state.of facts which can be conceived th@r© might b©
a valid claim proved* or words to that effect.

And then the

court of appeals seams to adopt an even more liberal standard.
At page 31 they say that a situation calls for even greater
liberality on the part of the district court where the State
has not been required to file any pleading whatsoever — that's
the point w© w@re talking about earlier.

Do you think fell®

standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the complaint should
b© the same or differant when there has been no response* no
motion* no nothing by tea State?

MR. PLUYMEN:

That's correct, although X couldn't

done.

If I had handled the case?, I would have filed a motion

to dismiss for failure to state a claim, period.
QUESTION;

Certainly there is no hint in the Federal

Rules of Civil Procedure that the standard is any different
when the State has responded by way of a one-line motion to
dismiss or by some other pleading when the question of
sufficiency of the complaint to state a claim is raised, is
there?
MR, PLUYMEN;

No, there is not, your Honor.

I doubt

that by answering the State could somehow salvage the complaint.
QUESTION;

Well, conceivably, if the Stat® answers

and then there is a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the
plaintiff is entitled to rely on the State's admissions in the
answer as wall as on th© plaintiff's complaint.

That's true, your Honor.

If the Court would consider all the cases decided by
the circuit court, w© would submit, that on the facts there is
no case that we have any substantial disagreement with as far
as granting or dismissing a complaint.

The facts in those cases, when you compare

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Hedges.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL K. HEDGES ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HEDGES:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas® th®

My nam© is Daniel Hedges, counsel for the respondent,

J. W. Gamble.

Th© respondent would like to make just three

basic points before th© Court today.
The first of those is that a pro se petition by an
illiterate prisoner alleging a violation of his constitutional
right to medical car® should never h® dismissed without
requiring

a

responsive pleading, or at least examining th®

relevant medical records.
.v

Second, that a petition which sets forth a pattern of

conduct which establishes deliberate indifference by prison
officials to th© rights of prisoners to accurate medical car®
or to medical car© at all statos a cause of action.
And, third, turning from th® procedural point to th®
substantive point to th© complaint itself, under whatever
standard th® Court chooses to apply, Mr. Gambless complaint
does stat® a cause of action.

In reference to th® question by

Mr,, Justice White just a few moments ago, in the opening pages
of the Fifth Circuit opinion,- they state,

"W© find the complaint

sufficient in alleging that th® action of th© authorities was
tantamount to a refusal of medical treatment.”
the opinion they do state that it was inadequate

La tar on in
I would

27
probably find myself in agreement with my colleague from the;
Attorney General's office it is not entirely certain just
which of the standards the Fifth Circuit did apply in this
case.
QUESTION;

Well, if you accept the allegations of

the complaint as true* obviously you can't conclude that there
was a total failure to provide treatment.
MR. HEDGES;
QUESTION;

We would not
He saw a doctor and the doctor did some

Mow, you could say h© did the wrong things

or it wasn’t adequate.
MR. HEDGES;

But h© had medical car© of som© kind.
H© saw doctors, your Honor, but we would

certainly say that wa can argue that there was a refusal of
medical care.

I cite the Court an example from a Fifth

Circuit case, Robinson v. Jordan, where the individual was
*

complaining of severe rectal pain, saw doctors on several
occasions, the doctors prescribed suppositorias of som® sort
to treat this person's pain, the pain persisted, ha continued
to complain.

They wouldn't do X rays, they wouldn't do further

tests, and they wouldn't change the prescription.
the person finally got another examination.
rectal cancer, had to have a colostomy.

Months later

He had advanced

That person stated a

claim.
I would say that if a diagnosis is conducted,
treatment is prescribed in accordance with -that diagnosis, but

28
the symptoms persist, ‘there is certainly a medical possibility
that the doctor's diagnosis was wrong»

And refusal to conduct

a subsequent diagnosis, and if necessary change the treatment,
you are not really talking about just diagreement with the
diagnosis, you are talking about a refusal to conduct a
subsequent diagnosis in the fac® of persisting symptoms.
QUESTION %

You think -that is an assertion that the

doctors refused to provide car® that they knew should be
provided?
MR. HEDGES:

I think if it is clear to them that th©

care which they ware providing was having no effect whatsoever,
then th© logical conclusion would be that their diagnosis was
wrong.
QUESTION:
isn't it?

That is basically a malpractice claim,

And in th® other cas® you told us about, that was

a malpractice claim„
MR. HEDGES:
QUESTION:

That was a 1983 case.
Y®s, but what it boils down to is a

malpractice claim, isn't it?
MR. HEDGES:

It is very similar, and v?@ don't need to

rely on that in this case, and I would hate to spend my time
before the Court dealing with that because

. .

we have all

the- —
QUESTION :

It is quit® different from a claim of

total failure or refusal to give any medical care whatsoever

29

to somebody in an illness or accident=
MR. HEDGES;

It is definitely different from a total

absence of medical care.
QUESTION;

And th® two claims are different, not

in degree, but in kind, ar© they not?
MR. HEDGES;

Yes, they ar®.

And we f®@l that w@

can come under the total refusal test as well in the
circumstances of this case.
QUESTION:

On the basis of the man's own complaint he

saw not on®, but two, doctors and saw them more than once.
MR. HEDGES;

I would like to call the Court’s atten­

tion to certain other allegations in tee complaint in which
on certain occasions, not overall, but on certain occasions
this individual suffered from th® deliberate indifference of
prison authorities to his medical needs.

This is the standard

we would urge before th© Court today, and not th® total refusal
standard.

This standard is set forth in our brief and explained,

in some detail.

This is the standard w® would set forte before

the Court and urge is that an allegation of deliberate
indifference by prison authorities to tee medical needs of a
prisoner states a claim.

This test has several advantages, one

of them being you aren't looking at medical car©, you aren't
disagreeing with doctors? you ar® looking at th® actions of
th© prison

authorities.

And I have cited nine examples in

the brief of where tee prison authorities denied adequate

30

-

medical care to this individual on an administrative basis.
I would like to just bring back to the Court three of those
which give a very good example of what I am talking about her®.
Mr. Pluymen pointed out that this individual was

some sort of medical personnel when h© was in pain»

This is

On February 7 and 8 of 1374, when he was in

solitary confinement, h© asked to go on sick call.

He was

refused permission to go on sick call by prison guards, not
by medical authorities, but by administrative individuals, by
prison guards.

The Law Enforcement Assistance Association,

a branch of the Justice Department, has stated in on® of its
recent reports that denial to access to sick call is an open
invitation to inmates to sue the institution for it is prima
faci® evidence of denial of medical car®.

Was it even

Or was it ora of th©s@ inmat© nurses?

34
We get; back to the questions that the Court asked at
the very outset, and those go to this procedural points
Without the medical records themselves , without aver having
seen the medical records, it's really impossible to tell ju; t
what did happen to this individual, just what car® was
received.

We have a great danger when w® allow the district

courts to dismiss these cases, which are so very difficult
to interpret and in sections difficult to believe admittedly,
and -there are so very many of them, when we allow teem to

bm

summarily dismissed without a responsive pleading and without
any discovery, w© run a tremendous risk teat tee very few
valid cases, or tee valid cases that do come along will simply
be thrown out with tha invalid ones because there are just too
many cases to consider and consider carefully.
What should be don© here is that the State or the
defendants in this case, Mi'. Estelle, Mr. Gray, and Mr.
Husbands, should b© required to assist the courts,

This

isn't a question of whether Federal courts will sit as medical
review boards.

The question in this case before the Court is

should the defendantsbe required to play their role in the
litigation of helping th© courts to decide whether or not there
is a valid claim.

And tha tools are there • in th.© Federal Rules

of Civil Procedures summary

judgment with affidavits,

a 12(b)(6) motion with the medical records simply attached.
None of this was don®

in

this case.

35
Another solution which is there,which was discussed
earlier, is the administrative grievance procedures.
are there in th© Tessas courts now.

Those

In the Federal courts, in

MR. HEDGESs
Corrections.

In the Texas courts or
I am sorry, in ‘th© Texas Department of

Those administrative procedures are now evallabis.

In the Federal Bureau of Prisons 35 percent of fell® complaints
receive favorable action.

Those are complaints which never had

to go to court because they received favorable action in the
t

prison within tine grievance procedures.

And furthermore, those

which go through these grievance procedures and then get into
the courts are going to have documentation attached, they are
going to have a record attached.

It's not going to b® like

the case here.
So there is no excuse for th© district; courts
dismissing these cases without requiring some sort of responsive pleading or some sort of discovery.

It's very dangerous, and

th® few good cases, th® few valid cases, will b© thrown out
because of th® great flood of litigation, and furthermore there
are other procedures available.
QUESTIONS

How do you deal with this -- as I read

this appendix, th© magistrate ruled that it couldn't b© filed.
But he said, "I p@rmit it, to b© filed."
MR. HEDGES;

I believ© it was filed and an immediate

36
dismissal recommended, your Honor.
QUESTION;

No, h® said, ”1 permit it to be filed.11

Isn't that what h© said?
MR. HEDGESs

Permission to file in forma pauperis

h@ granted, th© clerk b© required to file the petition.
QUESTION:

So h@ allowed it to bs filed.

QUESTION:

In forma pauperis.

MR. HEDGES: In forma pauperis, that’s correct.
QUESTION:

That's not what I asked.

Is this that

he allowed it to be filed?
MR. HEDGES: I do not know any provision undsr which
h© could dany th© permission to file it, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, to get back to what w© w@r@ asking

the Attorney General, was Mr. Estelle served?
MR. HEDGES:

There is no summons or indication whet"

soever of service in the record, your Honor.

Therefore, on

the record we have to .assume he was not.
QUESTION:

How can you complain about th® State not

filing something if they didn't know about it?
MR. HEDGES:

Th© blame does not 11® with -the State

there, your Honor? the blame lies with th© district court and,
the magistrate for not requiring that th© State be served and
file something.

Wherever the blame lias, the end result is

that th© district court did dismiss a petition without any
responsive pleading.

Th© effect on my client is the same

3?
whichever place it started out.
QUESTION;

What you are arguing then is an @xception

to the normal provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure where
a defendant can simply com© in and file a one-sentenca motion
to dismiss and argue th© insufficiency of ‘the complaint.

You

say that a defendant in a 1983 action is not able to do that.
MR. HEDGES; H© could do it.

I think it should not

b© granted, your Honor, unless he — all h@ would have to do
is attach a xerox copy of th® medical records and an affidavit
from th© doctor.
QUESTION;

Supposing he doesn't attach anything.

Th© Rules of Civil Procedure don9t require you attach anything
in fell© way of evidence to a motion feo dismiss.

Are you saying

there is a special exception to th® Rules of Civil Procedure
for a defendant in a 1983 action?
MR. HEDGES :

I think for a pro se petition in a

1983 action such as the on© here, the courts should not dismiss
those cases without at least looking at the medical records
and requiring some responsive pleading.

It is not in th© Rules

of Civil Procedure, your Honor is absolutely correct.

This is

th® position that several of the circuits have taken, and I
would urge before this Court that it is a very sound position
for the reasons that I have already stated.
I would like to move on very briefly from the questions
of procedure? feo th© questions of what is a proper standard one©

38

a district court has one of th©s© petitions for reviewing it
and would urge upon the Court the standard which I have already
touched upon, that deliberate indifference by prison officials
to .the medical needs of prisoners, allegations of this state
a claim under 1983.

Before looking at that test, it is really

essential that the Court, keep in mind that whatever test the
Attorney General's office advocates,

and they advocate this

exceptional circumstances test, whatever test I advocate, to©
improper test was used in the present case, and that was the
so-called prison deference rule or hands-off doctrine.
was at to® district court level.

This

A magistrate used this test.

And this is on® which is simply saying, "We aren't going to
interfere with to.® decisions of prison officials," which is
probably an adequate test in matters of administration of
i

prisons, in matters of discipline, but the circuits have
uniformly held that this is a totally inappropriate test when
you are talking about th© medical needs of prisoners, the
constitutional rights of prisoners.
Th© proper test is that of deliberate indifference,
and I have already dealt with th© cas© which best exemplifies
it, Bishop v. Stoneman, in which th® court looked at all of
the circumstances involved, th© Second Circuit did, and said
based on this cumulation of incidents w© se© a pattern of
conduct here which indicates a deliberate indifference to the
needs of prisoners

39
QUESTION:

In all these eases it would b® essential,

in a case such as this, for fch® court to come to some judgment

urge that the Court look at fch® actions of fch® nonmedical
prison persona©!, fell© nine separate instances which I have set
out in th© brief, and three of which I have discussed with the
Court just a minute ago, and I think you will find those,

Wall, what I am not quite clear about is

I'understand fch© suggestion that at least a. standard ought to

treatment under your summation?

I

41
QUESTION:

Would that be relevant only in a class

action?
MR. HEDGES:

It would certainly be more relevant

in a class action, your Honor, but it wouldnst b© totally
irrelevant in a cas© such as this.

I would ilk© to call to

tha Court's attention on this point that in their brief the
Attorney General's office does not allege there? was any real
prejudice or that tha outcome of the decision by the Fifth
Circuit was in any way influenced substantially by their
reference to this appendix.

Therefor®, this is not a matter

that the Court should even really considar, and furthermore,
it was clearly a proper matter for judicial notice since it was
the report of a working paper which ended up being a report
from a legislative committe©.

It was perfectly proper for them

to consider it, and it was relevant to the medical car®.
QUESTION:

Talking about the standard that you would

have us apply, in your brief you state that allegations of

medical condition means tills man can go out in fields and go
back to work on the 600-pound balas of cotton or whatever heavy
labor there is.
Immediately following this he was put into solitary
confinement, there was no medical examination of him before
he was put into solitary confinement.

This is a textbook

example of deliberate indifference by prison officials to the
medical needs of this individual.
To briefly summarize, this is a case where th© wrong
procedure was used.

There was no responsive pleading required.

The medical records have naver been s©@n.

And all that might

be required her© is to take a look at these medical records..
Furthermore, very simple, streamlined procedures are available,
both through the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and through
these administrative grievance procedures which Mr. Chief
Justice Burger has called for in his 1973 speech on th® state of

45
the judiciary# which Mr. Justice Powell has touched upon in
his Froeunier decision.

Taxas now has them.

It’s too late

for Mr. Gamble to utilize them# but they are available now#
and this Court should not be seeing any more cases coming out
of Texas like this.

Mr. Gamble simply asks to be accorded

the same rights that other prisoners in Texas now have.
Second# th® standard of care.

Whatever the Court

decides is the proper standard# the wrong standard was applied
here, and that was this hands-off doctrine, w@ just won’t
interfere with th© prison officials’ decisions,
And third, completely aside from questions of
diagnosis and treatment, Mr. Gamble’s complaint does stat® e
cause of action, a case of deliberate indifference to his
medical needs by the prison administrative officials,
QUESTION?

Mr. Hedges# is it really fair to Judge Bu@

to say that he applied a hands-off in prison matters approach?
I was under the impression that h® was presiding in some major
piece of litigation involving a review of all th© medical
practices within the Texas system.
MR. HEDGES?
QUESTION?
MR. HEDGES;

Judge Sue?
Isn’t that correct, or am I misinformed?
Your Honor, we can’t tell from this case

whether Judge Sue really even reviewed the magistrate’s
decision or not.

The Lawrence v. Wainwright case which is th©

hands-off doctrine case was in th© magistrate's decision.

QUESTIONS

I see.

NR. HEDGES;

Th©r© .is ftp indication whatsoever 1». tbo

by Judge Bue.

MR. HEDGES;

That is correct.

Honor.
QUESTION;

QUESTION;

May I ask a question?

The magistrate's

report states that h© requested the plaintiff, the than
plaintiff, to clarify and particularise the allegations of
deprivation.

The magistrate then, gees on to say that his

response was negative; it did not do that.

Is the response

MR. HEDGES;

It is not — there must not have been
There was no response.

MR. HEDGES:

It is not in the record which I received

when I was appointed by the Fifth Circuit,, your Honor.
QUESTION:

I was also puzzled by the last comment

you mad© that Judge Bu© signed a final judgment and h@ says
for .the reasons set forth in the magistrate's memorandum.
Are you suggesting he did not look at the memorandum?
MR. HEDGES:

No.

It9s impossible to tell from th®

records, your Honor, what d@gr@© of review there was.

But

there is a great danger — it's helpful to utilize the .
magistrates,

but as the Court is very well aware, the enormous

volume of fchss® cases, wm run the great danger of th© courts
abdicating their, responsibilities to th© magistrates and
letting th® magistrates make these recommendations.

no indication whatsoever that teat occurred in this case.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Pluymen, you have

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERT W. PLUYMEN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. PLUYMEN;

Your Honors, it. would be apparent from

our arguments today and more apparent from the two briefs
that counsel and I had no disagreement as to tk@ law to b©
applied.
test,

I have no disagreement with th© deliberate indifference

of course, if you decide to us© that test under

constitutional standards.
The only disagreement that we have comes to the
application of the law to the facts.

Th© deliberate indifference

particular occurrences cited by counsel in his brief are
taken completely out of context.

The failure of the building

department to issue him a lower bunk

for on® week during a

course of medical treatment by Dr* Aston© for four weeks? I
fail to see how that stands out.

His medical prescription

for 30 days given by Dr. Gray which was lost for four and then
given to him? I fail to see how that alleges any constitutional
claim.

His being threatened by the lieutenant and a sergeant

49
60 days after he was injured, and h<® was asked, "Do you want
.to go to work," h© said, HHo,B and they threatened to sand
him to th® farm, quote, unquote.

That was soma 34 days after

Dr , Aston© had ordered him to do light work and he had rcsfus ,k’,
; to do it.
He. was taken before a Disciplinary Committee twice.
Th® first time after having been cared for by Dr. Aston® for
three weeks, h© said, "1 still hurt.

Dr. Aston© has had ma for

26 days under his car@j h© didn’t ©van notic© my high blood
pressure."

Th© Disciplinary Committee did not say, "Go to

work or w® are sending you to solitary.®
going, to send you to sea another doctor."
he saw Dr. Gray.

They said, "We are
The very next day

He remained under Dr. Gray’s car© for two

weeks after that.

It wasn't until 86 days, or 40 days after'

that first Disciplinary Committee hearing, 86 days after the
injury, teat he was taken before th® Disciplinary Committed the
»

second time, and that’s when h© was sent to solitary for
refusing to work.

It had been a long time, he had been under

doctor's car© twice.

Th® doctor already had ordered him to do

light work months before.

He had refused to do it then.

They

finally cracked down on him and sent him to solitary.
So tear® is really no deliberate indifference in
this case as far as a constitutional standard or claim is
concerned.
Bishop v. Stonaman, which is cited by counsel as th©

50
best evidence or the best example of deliberate indifference#
th© allegations contained in that case ar© horrendous.

Back

not seeing doctors for 7 or 8 days after that»

The facts ar© just — it's not only a difference in. degree
in that case but in kind.
If your Honors war® sarious about us typing up a
verbatim transcript of this complaint, sine® w® have agreed on
the law, your Honors can determine for yourselves the application
of the lav/ to the facts.
QUESTION:

There is no sensa in us arguing

it might be useful.

Will you do. that

and have counsel her® agree with you that it is a correct
reading.
MR. PLUYMEN:

As far as the medical records ar©

concerned, should the court call up the medical record in
every case?

Our office will submit, the medical record

generally to th© court-along with a motion to dismiss or
whatever pleading for th® benefit of th® court.

In this

particular case, what difference doss it make in terms of
whether h® stated a complaint or not?

Upon reading the

complaint, he names the analgesics, Robaxin,Febridyn©, Sodium
Solicylate.

The EKG, I spent two days in a county medical

library trying to figure out the terminology that h® cites in
his complaint.

He obviously copied it.

W© don't even have to

assume he copied it out of his own medical record.

But taking

51
a look at the — if the court called up the madical record,
what difference would it male®?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think your tiros is up

now, counsel.
Thank you^ gentlemen.
Th® cas© is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the arguments in the
above-entitled matter war© concluded.]
