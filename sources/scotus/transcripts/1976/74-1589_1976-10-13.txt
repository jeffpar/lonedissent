PROCE E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

Gilbert against General Electric.
Mr. Kammholz, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIIEOPHIL C. KAMMHOLZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY
MR. KAMMHOLZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and. may it please

the Court z
The issue here on reargument, as it was the issue
last January, is whether the exclusion of pregnancy-related
disabilities fomr an employer5s disability income protection
plan is violative of the sex proscription of Title VII of
the Civil Rights Act.
General Electric, in its comprehensive insurance
program, has an income protection plan,in effect since prior
to 1950, which provides benefits to employees who, on account
of sickness or accident, non-occupafcionally incurred, are
absent from work.
The benefits continue for a maximum of 25 weeks,
end commence on the 8th day in the event of sickness, the
fir* k day in the event of accident? the maximum is 60 percent

of earnings, with a ceiling of $150 per week.
This plan, incidentally, dovetails with a long-term.

4
disability plan for the catastrophic kind of accident or
illness.
The plan excludes pregnancy-related disabilities ,
and the reasons, the historical reasons therefor, and which
apply today, can be summarized in this fashion:
Sickness and accident involves the unforeseen, the
unexpected.

Pregnancy, basically, is a planned event, neither

sickness nor accident.
At General Electric, 'the return rate of employees
absent because of sickness or illness is in the 90 percentplus percentile, except for pregnancy, where the return rate
is about 40 percent.

•So, in a sense, to provide this kind of

disability payment for pregnancy disability would be providing
a kind of severance pay to women only.
Additionally, and the statistics are basically -the
(

same- at General Electric as across tlie land under insurance
plans, -the cost of S&A coverage for females on the industrial
scene, with exclusion of pregnancy-related disabilities,
runs about 17.0 percent of male costs j or, to put it another
way, for every $100 expended for male S&A coverage, $170 is
expended for female coverage.
If, as the undisputed actuarial testimony at trie
trial indicates, if this pregnancy exclusion were extended to
six v-eaks *

coverage, the percentage total would run about

210 percent, or $2.10 expended for every female on the average,

5
as contrasted with the male; and if there were unlimited
ceiling on pregnancy disability coverage, the total would
run between 300 and 330 percent.
Again, at trial, the undisputed testimony indicated
that to strike down the kind of elimination that we are talking
abort here would add annually to the plans currently in effectin the country $1,353,000,000 in cost.
QUESTION:

What do you understand unlimited

coverage for pregnancy disability to be?
MR. KAMMHOLZs

Mo ceiling, as contrasted with any

other sickness or illness.

Under GE, for example, 26 weeks

of coverage.
QUESTION: Well, that's not unlimited, that's limited
to 26 weeks.
MR. KAMMHOLZ:

Perhaps the characterization is

inaccurate, but it would be in the same category as other
benefits underlie plan.
Currently, the coverage of S&A applies to perhaps
40 percent of the American industrial work force, according to
the record.

We are talking only about -those plans, because

there is no requirement that. General Electric or any other
employer impose a plan, with or without pregnancy disability.
low, of the 40 percent plan coverage, the record
again demonstrates that only 40 percent of those plans,
40 percent of the 40 percent, provides some kind of maternity,

6

pregnavicy disability coverage»

And, almost v/ithout exception,

the ceiling on it is six weeks.
.

How, if th© EOC is right, in this situation, that
six-week ceiling falls by the wayside.

There can be no

distinction as to total amount available. And this is on® of
the difficult cost implications that give rise to deep concern,
The insurance industry practice, with respect to
individual insurance policies, S&A policies, is a very

it excludes pregnancy-related disabilities.

simple

On the

simple theory that if such an individual plan were available,
to females, the insurance would b© procured after marriage
or when the pregnancy was planned, and this would obliterate
the underlying concept of what insurance in this area is all
about, to protect against tie unforeseen, the unplanned, the
unexpected,

The general standard is six weeks *
QUESTIONS

Is there any other medical condition that

is generally eliminated?

MR. KAMMHQL2:

Generally speaking, no»

As a practical

matter, and 1 don't want to encumber the record here with
cosmetic surgery, for example, where there is no coverage
under the GE policy with respect to the hospital surgical
aspect of it.
QUESTION? There is no coverage under the GE policy
for cosmetic surgery?
MR. KAMMH0L21 For cosmetic surgery as far as
hospital medical expense is concerned.
There is coverage for the in-and-out of th® hospital,
but with respect to cosmetic surgery, this runs a day or two.
Th® heavy cost is what the physicians charge, th© surgeons
charge in that regard.
The decision for exclusion of this kind of coverage
is, as I noted, further buttressed by the unique nature of
pregnancy.

Essentially it*s a voluntary thing.

As the record

©gain points out without dispute, and as an expert for the
union testified, it would be a strange

commentary, indeed,

if the survival of the human race depended upon sickness.
j

Contraceptive contraception in this society, which
hi® Nrw Uo::vc Timas recently characterised as cna having
reached almost a 100 percent level of/Contraceptive control of

e
birlh, in such that it's the planned pregnancy that almost
invar!ably applies.
Tc equate then the pregnancy'-’related situation with
sickness and accident generally, would be a non sequitur»

And

nov: wa. come to Geduldig v. _Aiello, this Court's decision in
1974 in the California insurance case where, under the
Fourteenth Amendment, the Court held that pregnancy is unique ,
and that there was involved not a situation of dissimilar treat*»
meat «.'if persons similarly situated, but, rather, the dealing
with a unique situation, a sui generis situation, pregnancy
with respect to which there can bs no discrimination, vis-a-vis
males»
X should like to com® back to Geduldig in a moment» .
I’d like to touch now on why we ar® here.

Whether the Congress,

>

in 1944, in the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, contemplated
tho obliteration of this kind of exclusion.
Your Honors recall, I am sure, that the sex
prescription surfaced for the first time in the House of
Representatives the day before the House adopted Title VII.
Ironically, the sex amendment came about as the result of the
proposal by Representative Howard Smith of Virginia, who was
an opponent of the Civil Rights Act.
j

And, finally, all of the mala Representatives who
voted for she sex amendment ultimately voted against Title VII,
The legislative history is vary sparse, indeed, as

9

th© Fifth Circuit pointed out in Willingham» and,, if I may»
I think I ceh. put in focus sor® precisely th® point I am trying
to make her® by giving this quote.
Last year» Willingham» in a sex-plus case, a hair
length esse» th® Court said:
*W® find th® legislative history regarding sex
discrimination inconclusive at best”

and may I say this

appeal's at page 13 of our Supplemental Briaf dated September
15» 1976 — "W® find th© legislative history regarding sax
discrimination inconclusive at best and draw but on© con­
clusions, and that by way of negative inference.

Without

more cuctenaive consideration» Congress in all probability did
not intend to its proscription of sexual discrimination to have
sicuific xfc end sweeping implications.

Wo should not therefore

extend th® coverage of th® Act. to situations of questionable
application without some stronger congressional mandate•"
'Upon th® adoption of Title VII r the Equal Employment
Opportunities Commission, beginning in 1965» and continuing
for six and one-half years, articulated th© precise view that
we are aspousing her© this mornings

the view that because

pregnancy is different, the proscriptions of Title VII on th®
i

sex subject war© not intended to reach pregnancy exclusions.
Now, I submit that that contsmporaneous interprota­
tion fey EEOC should be given great weight» and the ohsag©
which occurred in 1972 with a 180-degres reversal in the

QUESTIONS

Mr. Kammholz.

MR. KAMMHOLZ:
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor?

Would there be any impediment that you

can suggest, to having the collective bargaining agreement
between the parties, General Electric and its bargaining agents ,
provide for all these things explicitly?
getting the

In other words,

respondents everything they ere seeking in this

litigation?
MR. KAMMIIOLZs

No, indeed not.

The parties could

so bargain? indeed, as I am sure you will hear from my
distinguished opponent, the.union has asked for such a change
during the course of bargaining over the years.

And the

union, of course, has asked for many other things, their
demands have been innovative, to say the least.
No, I think clearly this is a matter for collective
bargaining, if the parties elect to distribute a portion,

21

larger portion of the benefit dollar to this area, they could
so do.

But. this would be on the basis of consideration as to

what.is appropriate in terms of dividing the benefit dollar.
If I may return briefly now to Geduldig v. Aiello.
Footnote 20 in that decision, which articulates' the sui generis
nature of pregnancy and pregnancy-related disabilities, has

11
been the subject of a great deal of consideration and writing,
not, only by th.® courts but in the law schools.

And very

recently# also, Arthur Larson# a former Under Secretary of
Commerce # and now James B. Duke Professor of Law at Duke
University# has published a book# not available at the time
of. the original argument# in which he expresses# 1 think
expresses-vary succinctly# the considerations that are involved
her®.
As he puts it# a Supreme Court adoption of the EEOC
rule would# on the strength of a statute aimed at

aimed not

at social or private insurance reform, but at employment
discrimination# would change all this# rearrange insurance
priorities and categories and markedly alter 'the allocation
of the limited resources available for wag© loss# hospital
and medical benefits# away from both the creators and the
beneficiaries of those plans.
Vary often the view is suggested that in amok©?-filled
rooms decisions are made which discriminate# the fact of the
matter is in collective bargaining and in decision-making
on th© part of management in unorganized operations# what
is th© appropriate allocation of the benefit dollar?

Indeed#

how does one divide th® pie# if you will, in terms of fringe
benefits# wag® increases# cost of living adjustments# ®t
cetera?

T%nd these decisions are arrived at in this sector as

12

the result of careful consideration, no effort at discrimina­
tion, but a desire to do what’s best for the largest number»
And, as Professor Larsen points out, the ultimate
decision her©, the non-extension of pregnancy benefits to
women, really relates to the family unit»

There is a father

for every child,'tin© head of the household perhaps, and it’s
the allocation of -that money applied for the greatest benefit
for all involved, that’s the underlying decision.

And because

•the family unit is in the majority, obviously, any decision
that can be characterised as discriminatory is —
QUESTION;

Mr. Kammholz, does the collective

bargaining representative of the entire work force have a
position on how this money should be distributed?
MR. KAMMHOLZ;

No, this is hammered out on a case-

by- case, cor;.tract-by- contract b as is , s i r.
QUESTION;

Haven’t they made a demand that these

benefits be included?

• ;•

MR, KAMMHOLZ:

In this instance?

In this case?

QUESTION; Well, isn't that the position of the union
in this?
MR. KAMMHOLZ:

Oh, sure. This demand has been made

.over th© years, along with many other demands.

.As I noted,

the union is mostly the one —
QUESTION;

Aren't they the one who is most directly

interested in the proper allocation throughout the work force?

.13

MR» KAMMHOLZ:

And they have participated in these

decisions, because ultimately the panoply of what is asked for
*

is so broad and all-encompassing, it is what finally is
hammered out that really counts.

And with respect to what is

finally hammered out, the union’s signature is on -the line»
QUESTION:

But it seamed to me the argument you were

making was that what you are doing is for the benefit of the
work force as a whole, but -~
MR» KAMMHOLZ:
QUESTION:

Precisely, yes»
But the union takes the contrary

position on that»
MR» KAMMHOLZx

Yes, sir»

I might add, finally, that under the Equal Pay Act
and under Executive Order 11246, the rule that EEOC here
strives for is not recognized®

to pregnancy disability, it's not only a matter of equal

substantially exceeds thee which is available to malas»

if the collective bargaining agreement

on actuarial studies, would that violate any federal statute

people who are benefitted bear the —

MR. KAMMHOLZ:
QUESTION:

MR. KAMMHOLZ:

I suspect the argument would surface

very swiftly that this was discriminatory.
I should add that earlier this year — and again
not available at the time of the original argument — the New
York State Department of Insurance issued an in-depth report,
on insurance costs.

„

We have lodged it with the Court

it’s

available hare, and it demonstrates several things.
No. 1, it supports clearly and precisely thr position
we initially articulated,, that female cost is much higher.
This the report finds.
It notes also, for example, that because of the
longer life of females on the average, pension costs, annuity
costs run about 25 percent higher for females than for males.
Thank you very much.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kammholz, you haven’t mentioned an

intervening decision since you last argued here.

Washington

v. Davis.
MR. KAMMHOLZ:
QUESTION:

I wondered what you had to say about that.

MR. KAMMHOLZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Washington v. Davis was a race case.

But the statute treats race and sex the

same.
MR. KAMMHOLZ:

Right. But this Court has never held

15
sex as a suspect classification.
QUESTION s

No, no.

But I'm talking about -- this

is a statutory case, isn’t it?
MR. KAMMHOLZ;

Yes.

We think that footnote 20 clearly points out. that
there is no discrimination, no sex discrimination in our
case? therefore, the reach of Washington v*_Davis simply could
not apply*

And again I note that there

w® suggest, as I

am sure is in the minds of Your Honors, the proposition that
sex is not inherently suspect.
QUESTIONs But that really doesn't, have much to do
with this statutory case, doss it?
MR. KAMMHOLZ;

It doesn't? if you agree with our

initial concept, there is no discrimination involved.
Thank you.
QUESTION;

Mr. Kammholz, before you sit down, let

m© ask you to help me a little bit.
Could a plan, such as GE*s, exclude generally
sickle call anemia?
MR. KAMMHOLZ;

1 think sickle call anemia would be

in a different category from what I know about the medical
writings on the subject.

This is a disease suffered only by

blacks.
QUESTION;

Could it^exclud© such a disease as

?

pemphigus, which, as I understand it, is more observant among

16

Jewish people than others?
MR. KAMMIIOLZ:

I am not familiar with that one, but

I think the same answer would apply»
QUESTION: Could it exclude circumcision?
MR. KAMMIIOLZ:
QUESTION:

Oh, I 'think it could, yes.

You would put that in the same category

as pregnancy?
MR. KAMMIIOLZ:

I will give the short answer:

Yes»

[Laughter.]
QUESTION;

Mr. Kammholz, I didn't hear the answer.

Could you tell me, what was your answer with respect to
sickle cell anemia?

You said it was a disease that could

only be suffered by blacks.
MR. KAMMIIOLZ:
QUESTION:

..By blacks.

But, therefore, could it be excluded

or could it. not be?
MR. KAMMIIOLZ:
QUESTION:

Could not.

Could not be excluded?

MR. KAMMIIOLZ:

Could not.

And we —

QUESTION: Then why do you coma to a different
conclusion on pregnancy, which can only be suffered by women?
MR. KAMMIIOLZ:

Because we are dealing, on the one

hand, with race and on the other with sex.
QUESTION: But does the statute draw a difference
between sex discrimination and race discrimination?

MR. KAMMHOLZ:

The Court has.

Your Honors have

found sex to be a suspect classification,
QUESTION: But those are constitutional cases.

And

under the statute,, is that —
MR. KAMMHOLZ:

In the light of legislative history.

Title VII, I suggest that the identical rule should apply,
QUESTION:

Also, one is an illness and the other

is not. Isn’t, 'that it?
MR. KAMMHOLZs
QUESTIONs

Yes.

That’s what you told us in the earlier

part of your argument.
MR, KAMMHOLZ:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Isn’t, that, your basic position?

MR, KAMMHOLZ;

That’s the underlying position,

that childbirth, pregnancy is a natural thing.

Medical

testimony on the record indicated that in most instances it
contributes to the well-being cf the mother.

It's not a

disease, as Dr. Heliegers pointed out, because it would be
sad, indeed, if we all survived on the basis of sickness.
It's a sui generis, unique,different unto itself kind of
condition.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION:

Very well.

Mr. Kammholz, one last question:

has the burden of proof in this case?

Who

In your estimation.

18

MR. KAMMHOLZ•

In my view, we have —• there is no

prima facie burden, we est.alxl.ish a rational relationship,
we establish the sex aspect of it, and there is no burden of
proof on us.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE IiURQERs

Very well, Mr. Kammholz.

Miss Weyand.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS RUTH WEYAND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF GILBERT, ET AL.
MISS WEYAND;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I want to address myself first to the question which
has been raised as to the relationship of collective bargaining
to the issue of inclusion or exclusion.
This Court, as a matter of law, has recognized in
cases involving collective bargaining agreements, which
discriminate because of race, way before the enactment of
Title VII , that in

_____

o

vs. Louisville-Nashvilie,

that unions sometimes do enter into discriminatory contracts,
and that they violate their constitutional duty when they do
so.
More recently-under Title VII, Title VII is
directed at the fact that both with regards to race and sex
many unions have not, in dealing with employers, acted in a
non-discriminatory matter.

And the existence of a collective

bargaining agreement, is no excuse.

Furthermore, as the record here shows , since, the
time that fringe benefits became, by law, a bargaining subject
with the Inman vs. NLRB decision of the Seventh Circuit in
1948, was affirmed on another point here.

The next bargaining

session, the first one was IUE, between GE and the IUE, was
in 1950.

The record here shows without dispute that 1950,

the union pointed out that General Motors paid six weeks ,
which is usually enough to take care of it, in fact with
changing medical practices, many of the women get back in less
time. We have two, the first witness-;./ in our case, from
Tyler, Texas, was<
*not take her

certified back in four weeks.

GE would

back.

Mary Williams went back in four weeks -- another
witness here, six weeks.

And my estimation on cost is that

the companies that now pay six weeks, if they begin letting
employees come back when they are physically certified back
are going tc have a reduction in cost, not an increase in cost
But the IUE went to the employer in 1950, 1955,
I960, 1963, 1966, repeatedly, and asked that they bargain and
include the six-weeks* benefit which is traditional, which
is present in 40 percent of the industry, in fact, Bailey,.:
the company’s actuary, fixas it at 60 percent of the industry
pays six weeks* benefits.
QUESTIONS

Miss Weyand, would you consider that a

six-week benefit would comply with the statute if all other

20
illnesses had a benefit of up to 26 weeks?
MISS WEYAND:

No# I do not.

have pending a case against General

And w® have cases# I
I just wanted to say

costwise —
QUESTION: They would not have solved their problem
then# would they?
MISS WEYAND:

They would not# because we think that

the individual who has a complication# she really has a
disease# no question of illness# she needs the more? and
it is discriminatory to limit this one area to six weeks#
no question about it.
3But I was just saying# in terms of the union’s
effort here over the years# to get something for these women#
as the union has wanted to spend it# and the union# of
course# in the last two rounds of negotiations# has asked that
it be treated exactly the same.

You have the record here#

that there be no limit whatsoever, that it. not only go on
for 26 weeks, but it go on under the permanent.

And we

have -the IUE as a plaintiff in a suit against General
Motors involving the six weeks' plan# which I mentioned#
has filed suits and had findings 'that that is discriminatory.
But I just wanted to say that the union has triad
to get -this.

And there is an assumption that seems to be

if
implied in some people's minds# that/the union asked for
something like this# the company is going to be willing to

give ito
In fact, this demand was on the bargaining table
during the long strike.

There are certain things that

companies have principles about.

GE had a principle about

job posting for years and years.

It has recently changed

because cf Title VII. They bought a new plant, had a job
posting agreement, we had a 15-week strike when they took it
out of that plant, they wouldn't.
GE has a principle about not paying sickness and
accident benefits.
afraid the record
made it clear.

Nov;, it pays for everything, and I'm
the answers to the questions may not have

It pays for the tame that a man is disabled

by cosmetic s urgery.
Mr. Kammholz was merely making the point that they
don’t pay Idle medical expense of it.
There is not a single thing that a man gets disabled
by -that GE does not cover fully.

But GE, and it appears in

this record with the testimony, in the testimony insurance,
is firmly of the view that when you pay disability benefits
for pregnancy you're not paying for the period a woman is
disabled, its figures are rot based on the period she’s
disabled.

This Court upset a statute that had a six-week —

Turner vs. Utah, that had a six-week return date as against
•*•** we know people are able to come back earlier than that.
In Cleveland vs. LeFlaur, you agreed they could

22
come back then*
QUESTION:

But that involved a government*,

MISS WE YAND:

A government*

But you took judicial

notice of the fact that many women are not physically
disabled for six- weeks.
And GE has never portended here, their doctor,, the
medicEil testimony, their doctor, Dr. Hellegers, Dr. Forrest,
nc dispute *

That most women, in fact the numerical majority,

come cut of the hospital in two or three days now, and within
two weeks, within two weeks their doctor

Dr. Wilbanks

The entire 'time, from the

she went: into labor until she was back on the job.
Testimony of both their doctors was that two weeks

today is the majority of women are back at home, doing their
homework, taking care of their children, which is harder work
than their job in the office.
That the medical position has changed.

And I’ve

cited the point.
But the reason their actuary, when he figures this
billion, he figures that every woman under the 13-week plan
is going to be out 13 weeks, every woman under the 26-week
plan is going to be out 23 weeks, every woman under the
52~v:-eek,'.ls going to be out 30 weeks.

And he says, why,

not because they are disabled, -they have never made a
pretense it*3 because they are disabled, because women

23

malinger.

And you will find in the findings here,, the court

found they don’t malinger»

But their actuary, who explains

the insurance position of why this isn’t covered by insurance,
is that women have a natural desire to take it easy, they
may have heard that someone had a miscarriage, and therefore
they are going to want to sit at home.

And they have a

natural desire# after the child is bom, to stay home with
him.
Now# if you knew these women that, have to have that
paycheck# they don’t want to sit home# they want a baby sitter
there who establishes the routine, the day they ccme back, and
they want that check to pay it, because they have got to get
back.
There are 37 million women working in the United
States today# and# as the figures of the Eiepartment of Labor#
as of April# the last figures came out in July of 1976 for
the quarter ending April 1975, 21 million woman either were

MR. POTTIHGER:

Certainly it is,, if not by

direction, by indirection, yes, sir.
Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Courts
What we have presented today is the following fact
situation, against which Titia VII must be measured.
We have a disability plan by General Electri c,
which seeks to cover virtually all disabilities for men and
women except one.

A great deal has bean said about the

voluntariness of pregnancy.
Let us examine for a moment, however, the coverage
of voluntary as well as involtunary disabilities for men.
Virtually every disability, including voluntary disability,
as they affect man, are covered by tills plan. That includes
everything from cosmetic surgery, as noted, to suicide, to
felonies, or the results of felonies, to voluntary sports
activities, to falling off ladders -*«»

)

QUESTION;

Well, most of that is covered for women,

too, isn't it?
MR. POTTINGER;

Yes, it is. There's no distinction,

32
in other words, as to voluntariness or involuntariness in
tills plan.

With the exception — and, therefore, I think bo

say that the plan is directed toward — misdirected toward
voluntariness of pregnancy is clearly misleading.
The purpose of Title VII, however, is to provide
equal opportunity in the job market by excluding invidious
forms of discrimination, including sex.

And we believe that,

given the legislative history and interpretations of the
Court, clearly two different theories would sustain a prima
facie case of sex discrimination in this case.
First, ‘the exclusion in 'this particular case is not
neutral on its face, it does single out a condition which
is so inextricably sex linked to women that it is tantamount
to a policy of excluding women from tills otherwise total
coverage.

QUESTION:

Wasn’t the actuarial element an

important factor in that holding?
MR. POTTINGERs

Definitely. And I would like to

address that same.issue in this case, if I may.
The actuarial issue in Aiello, however, was set in
the context of a State social welfare program, where the
Court found that it was rational.

No, I don’t — I believe that Aiello

it is rational under Griggs.

regulations?
MR, POTTINGER;

Yes, it is.

QUESTION: And not just: guidelines?
MR. POTTINGER:

Well, pardon me, guidelines in this

particular case,
However, the Co’art has held that deference should
be paid to the guidelines,, and we think that that is sensible.
Either under a theory which would state that, there
is an inextricable relationship between race and the exclu-

36

sionary factor, or sex and the exclusionary factor.

For

instance, sickle cell anemia.
Or under the impact, theory of Griggs.

In either

case-5 a prima facie case has bean made out.
Now, I notice that counsel concedes before you today
that if sickle cell anemia were before the Court, that could
not be excluded.

I would submit that there is no logical

or rational distinction under Title VII, not under Aiello,
not under the Fourteenth Amendment, but under Title VII,
between an exclusion of sickle cell anemia, which we admit
could not lawfully take place, and the exclusion of sexrelated practices or disabilities, such as pregnancy.
I fail to see the distinction.
Therefore, we have — we are faced with only two
defense, or, rather, arguments in defense.
One is Aiello, which we have just — I have
attempted to deal with here.
•The other is the business necessity or cost factor.
.And, if I may, I would like to point out that in this
particular case cost cannot ba a controlling factor in this
decision,
First of all, in the courts below, General Electric
refused to present a business necessity defense, either in the
district court or in the Court of Appeals.

It presented cost,

factors, not for purposes of showing that toe cost would be

37
too high, and, indeed, the admission that 40 percent of those
industries that do provide these benefits have not gone
broke, have not shut down their plants, seems to me to give
•the lie to the theory -that they ever could be too high»
So that business necessity defense is not even
presented to the Court*
However, it comes in the back door right now, it
seems to me, by arguing in -this fashion that cost, by raising
the horrors of cost*

Yet, clearly, we do not need -to find

that this program, in order to be sustained, must provide a
cost that would literally shut down the plant*

That is not

an issue, if5s a red herring here*
As for the notion that the six-week coverage would
have to be extended, clearly what we are talking about and
what counsel for appellees is talking about is a coverage
that arises from sickness or an involuntary disability
arising after a normal pregnancy*
No one is suggesting, nor is counsel for General
Electric suggesting, that there would be up to 26 weeks of
benefits for a normal pregnancy.

Yet, under the General

Electric plan, even an involuntary illness, an unpredictable
illness, that is pregn@ncy~rej.ated, would not be covered at
all, much less would it be covered on a basis that is similar
to that which men have under the disability program.
They are excluding both' the voluntary, if you will,

38

aspects of pregnancy and the normal aspects ? and the
involuntary or abnormal aspects of pregnancy alike.

Yet it

presents no cost figures whatsoever on how often abnormalities
would arise and how much they would cost.

Instead it refers

to industrywide figures,, that we would submit are in aposite
to the problems faced by GE or? indeed? by the 40 percent of
companies -that have done this successfully.
There are ways? in fact? of dealing with the coset
issue. The courts have held that cost itself is not a
defense to discrimination? where a case is made out. We
agree with that. We also agree that the cost, factors could
be raised only in the event -chat a business necessity defense
could be raised? and again? that has not either been tendered
before this Court this morning or in either of the courts
below? despite ample opportunity to do so.
What we are faced with is a situation where General
Electric has provided? has sought to provide an umbrella of
coverage? and yat it has plucked out cn© single activity
from ‘that urn!)re 11 a and placed it in the rain.
What we are talking about here is an activity which
is not — or? rather, a disability which is not shown to be
more expensive? for instance? than one that males face? and?
indeed? -the record will indicate that in the insurance area?
as opposed to disability coverage? men in GE cost the
company much more than women-

The insurance program costs

39

tliem more.
If we were to find that respiratory diseases or
heart diseases or other specific diseases were actuarily.
defined, and -the company wanted to take those into account
to keep the integrity of cost factors at a minimum, that would
be another issue.

But that is not what they propose to do in

this case.
And we believe that once the company undertakes, as
General Electric has, to create a broad umbrella of coverage
QUESTION;

Mr„ Attorney General, whan you said men

cost more, did you mean in the life insuran.ce program as
opposed to the medical insurance program?
MR. POTTINGERs
QUESTIONS

Yes. That is correcto

Yes.

MR. POTTINGERs

However, I ‘think that counsel's

use of the 170 percent figure is itself a bit of a. red herring.
The male coverage figures that he presents are not related
directly to the cost factors that would arise in GE on a
comparative basis with pregnancy "that was normally judged, as
opposed to ‘this 26 or open“ended judgment.
QUESTIONS But your basic position is that the cost
really doesn't make any difference, anyway?
MR. POTTINGERs

No, I think the cost could

difference, but clearly in this case it does not make a
difference, and has not made a difference.

r

40

QUESTION: When would cost make a difference?
MR* POTTINGER:

I would use the LoriHard test

that states that in a business necessity way if the safety
or efficiency of the company were at stake —
QUESTION:

It’s just different if it was a matter

of bankrupting the company?
MR* POTTINGER:
QUESTION:

Well, but --

And if a business necessity defense is

interposed*
MR* POTTINGER: And if it's interposed, which it
was not interposed in this case.
QUESTION:

It wasn't here*

MR* POTTINGER:

Even though there was ample

opportunity to do so*
QUESTION: What's the statutory basis for a
business necessity defense?
MR* POTTINGER:

In, I believe it's 703(e) and (j),

I believe the statute allows for what amounts to a business
necessity result, or, rather, argument*
But may I simply say that with regard to the cost
factor, the business n-cessity defense itself makes clear
that only if it's necessary to

— only if the one cost

interposed is necessary, and would result in the disabling
of the company, would this factor arise*
Here there are other ways in which the company

4.1

could cover normal and even abnormal pregnancies without the
necessity for eliminating this entire program»

It could, for

instance, reduce the amount of payments elsewhere, it could,

j

for instance, eliminate coverage that runs across sex lines,
such as respiratory diseases arising from smoking of men and
women alike, it could reduce the amount of payment in terns
\

of the time it pays, it could take any number of innovative
approaches to cover pregnancies,
QUESTIONs

How realistic do you think those

alternative proposals are, in the face of the realities of
collective bargaining, if there’s going to be any reduction
in the benefits?
MR, POTTINGERs Well, I 'think that in light of —
as long as this Court sits, and as long as this Court is
\

able to recognise or will, if it does recognize that this
form of discrimination cannot go forward, I think they are
realistic»
I think, in the absence of a ruling,
QUESTIONs

We can’t — 13m talking about the

realities of collective bargaining.
MR. POTTINGERs But the collective bargaining —
QUESTION s Do you think -the union is going to agree
to reduction in the benefits?
MR. POTTINGERs
QUESTIONS

No, I'm saying that —

They already have?

42
MR» POTTINGER;

— ifc seems to me that if — yes,

I think so if the company car; show that -the absence of such a
reduction is to close down the plant or otherwise disable
the company, I would say that that's a possibility that
is reasonable,
And what I am saying further is ’that that is, in
fact, in law, the only basis upon which the company can go,
either to court or to the union in the collective bargaining
system, and say, we must make a change in order to accommodate
pregnancy disability programs.
In the absence of showing that high standard of
need, it seems to ms that the chances are not great, but,
on the other hand, they need not be great, because the company
will not be faced with a disabling cost factor.
Thank you.

Finally, a very brief reference, Mr, Justice

This is an area that we

have net covered in any of our briefs, and I should like to
note again that pregnancy is the only physical condition
which is unique to one sex.

And, as I understand the

sicle cell situation, it's inaposite, because most blacks
are immune to it, and finally, its sickness, as 1 understand
it, is not a unique condition like pregnancy.
