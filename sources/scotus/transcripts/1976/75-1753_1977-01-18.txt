MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 1753, 1660, 1782, Santa Fe Industries against Green.
Mr. Glendon, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. GLENDON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GLENDON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is William R. Glendon.

I represent the

Santa Fe parties who are defendants below and are petitioners
her®.
In this proceeding there ar® raised some very
troublesome and even startling problems by the decision below
in reference to the scone of the securities laws, particularly
10(b) of the '34 act, and further the entire relationship
between federal and state governments.
The case arises out of the fact that the plaintiffs
are suing, claiming that in a short form merger, pursuant to
the

Delaware statute, the price that they were given of $153

was grossly undervalued and that this constitutes a violation
of scheme and contrivance under Rule lOb-5 because it was
given without notice, although the Delaware statute does not
require any notice.
In fact, all the Delaware statutes were complied
with.

And in this action under a statute requiring manipulation

4
and deceit, it is clear that there was no deceit, and there
was no non-disclosure.

Nonetheless, two members of the

Court of Appeals said that the conduct pursuant to this
statute was a fiduciary breach, and they said that this was
a scheme to defraud.
The dissenting opinion, Judge Moore, said:
that the facts her®

To say

presented a scenario of fraud was a

patent distortion of the term.

There was no fraud at all.

The facts very quickly are

that Santa Fa acquired

60 percent of the Kirby Lumber Company 1933 under a
reorganisation.

In 1967 they acquired another 25 percent

at a price—and I will remind Your Honors the price claimed •
here to be grossly undervalued is $125'—in 1967 the remaining
25 percent, to get them up to 90 percent, was acquired at a
price of $65.

There ware additional purchases of the stock

in between '67 and '74 at prices of $65 to $92, to bring them
up to th© number of 90 percent under Delaware lax*/.

You may

enter into a short-form merger if you have 90 percent.
Santa Fe decided to invoke the provisions of th®
Delaware short-form statute and have a short-form merger.
do this it did a number of things.

To

It first of all caused

appraisals to be made of the physical properties, and this
physical appraisal of the properties showed © value—asset
value—of $320 million.

It also had an appraisal made of th©

mineral properties, and this too was submitted to Morgan

5

Stanley along with the asset appraisal, whom Santa Fe had
engaged to giv© it an independent advice as to the fair
market value of the stock of the minority, the fractional
shareholders.
Morgan Stanley did an appraisal of the market value
of the stock and came up with a figure—after considering a
variety of factors, .including the appraisals which were
submitted to them—-of $125»
Q

Was the Kirby stock traded over the counter?

MR. GLENDGN:
Mr. Justice.
counter.

They are very thin market,

I think that it was not even 'traded over the

There just was not much trading in it.

The record

reflects the buys by Santa Fe during the period '67 on and,
as you will see there, they are very small numbers of shares.
Santa Fe took the Morgan Stanley recommendation,
$125, increased it

to $150»

Parenthetically this would be

12-1/2 times earnings for th© previous year.

It set un

&

corporation called Forest Products, Inc. to implement the
merger.

It gave Forest Products $3.8 million to have the

money to buy in the minority stock.

And I mention this

because the lower court was under tine misapprehension that
Kirby itself paid for the stock, that the stock was paid for
out of Kirby’s funds.

This simply was not so.

The parent

provided the money.
The merger pursuant t© the statute was effected on—

6

Q

Mr. Glendon, is that really a significant point

because did not Kirby incur an indebtedness to get the inoriay
from the parent?
MR. GLENDON:
Q

No.

You mean it was just a capital contribution?

MR. GLENDON;

Yes.

I stress it because Your Honors

will probably read the Marshall case along with this case,
which is another case that came out of the Second Circuit.
And there was great stress laid in that case that a merger
without a corporate purpose where the company’s funds were
used was a violation of 10(b).

And I just want to make the

distinction her© that that did not happen here.
The merger occurred on July 31st, and on August 1st,
'the next day, as provided by the statute, notice was sent to
the fractional, the minority■, shareholders.

Along with the

notice--and this is very important to our case—-along with
the notice went a ream of material describing the background
of the merger, describing the merger, describing the appraisals,
including the appraisals 5 every single bit of relevant
information that could possibly be put out was put out.

And

in fact there is no claim that any of that material was
misleading, that it misrepresented anything, that it said
that something was only a half-truth or that it failed to
disclose anything.
material.

There is no claim with reference to this

7
Indeed, the claim itself““in fact, the claim of
undervaluation is based on the figures disclosed by the
information w@ gave them which is, in passing, strange in a
X0b-5 non-disclosure case»
W® moved to dismiss in the District Court.

The

District Court, it seemed to us—and of course we are
pr@judiced--.it seemed to us, took a realistic and rather
straightforward view of this case.
deception in the case.
claim of non-disclosure.

It said there is no

It is a 10b-5 case.

There is no

Therefore, it is not a 10b-5 case,

and dismissed it.
To the claim that there was no corporate purpose,
it said you do not need a corporate purpose in Delaware.
To the claim that there should have been prior
notice, it said the statute provides for post-merger notice.
And I might just say there that that we think is the relevant
time because that is the time the minority stockholder needs
the information in order to make an investment decision.'

He

wants to know at that time, Do I accept $150 ox* do I seek the
appraisal rights which I have under the Delaware statute?
So, we say and Judge Brleant in the lower court said that
this was proper and adequate notice under the statute.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we will resume

there at 10:00 o'clock in the morning, Mr. (Hendon.
[thereupon, at 3:00 o'clock p.m., the Court was
adjourned until the following day, Wednesday, January 19,
1977, at 10:00 o'clock a.m.l
