Revenue against Standard Life & Accident.
Mr. Smith, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

This Federal income tax cas© comes here on a writ

©£

certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit.

It presents a question of major fiscal

importance involving the taxation of practically every life
insurance ccmpany.
The tax statute that w© will be dealing with ibis
morning imposes a unique preferential system of taxation, on
Ufa insurance companies.

It recognizes that life insurance

companies are required, to add amounts of both premium ia.com©
and investment income to an account called "Policyholder
Reserves" la order to be able to have sufficient funds to meet
future claims.

What the statute dc@s in brief is to permit a

deduction from premium income for additions to reserve and
to provide a computation by which investment income is broken
down into two segments — that is, the portion of investment
incoma added to policyholder reserves is excluded from the tax
baso and the portion of inv-astraent income which is allocable

4
to company surplus is subject to currant tax.
Th® case involves a particular kind of premium,
cailisd deferred and uncollected premiums, which. I will shortly
defin®.

But suffice it to say at th© outset that until the

decision of fcho Court of Appsa.ls in this case* four circuits,
th© Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Sixth, and the nax court had
upheld the Commissioner^ position, that, such premiums, that
id, deferred and uncollected premiums, had to be consistently
taken into account in computing tars© statutory categories
assets, premium income {although the statute .refers to it as
gross amount of premiums), and reserves.
Sere th© Tenth Circuit has reached what vm believe
is an extraordinary and surprising result.

It has held that

these; deferred and uncollected premiums are to be included
in reserves but nevertheless ©^eluded from th® corresponding
tax compx;-ti:lions of assets and premium income.

W@ believe

the decision is unprecedented* sad 'its unprecedented and
peculiar quality is underscored by th© fact, that as bha briefs
disclos® and th® arguments this morning will doubtless
confirm, the life insurance industry itself has disavowed tin©
approach taken by th® Court of Appeals.
Before 1 describe the facts of the case, I think
it would be helpful and it would put th® issue in proper
focus if I set forth to th® Court three elements before moving
on, and. they are —

I

I would like to sat out three elements to th® Court
bmom

describing th© facts and to© holdings of th© lower court.

1 would like to define deferred and uncollected premiums.

I

would then like to describe th® nature of th® lif® insurance
reserve, which is toe central component of this tax computation,
and to© relationship of that reserve to premiums.

And them I

would like to describo in detail th© mechanics of to® tax
statute*
Deferred and uncollected premiums ar© a particular

6
kind of premiums used in selling lif© iasuranca.

Now, a

policyholder has th© option to pay his premium in. full as of
the anniversary dafc® or h® can pay it in installments.

If he

pays it in installments, which are typically monthly, quarterly,
or semi-annually, th® amount

which is du© to fos paid after

th© close of th© calendar year, j>@cau3© insurance companies
by statute ar® required to report their income on a calendar

There is another kind of premium here called ’due
and uncoil* ted premiums."

And those premiums -ar® amounts

which rho policyholder ox,as right new but for on© reason or
another hat-, not paid.

Ttey are called premiums due and payable.

Thay are also known as uncollected premiums.

MR. SMI®!:

But what I am speaking of essentially is two types of

premiums: those which

your quarterly payment is not due yet,

that is deferred premium, and then if the date passes when it

uncollected premium.

And tees© two 'typos are known in the

aggregata as deferred, and uncollected premiums.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith * let me just ask you a question

on uncollected premiums.

If a premium has been uncollected

for, say, 45 days, there is a normal 30-dav period during
which ha can pay, is it still classed as an uncollected
premium, or ar© we only talking about on the year-end business

It would no longer b© an uncollected

I think th® policy would lapse and then other

mechanics would take over.
Tbs question presented in this case involves the
proper tax treatment under tea current statute which cassa in
is 1959 for teesa deferred and uncollected premiums under tea

two principal computations under the statute — tee computation
for premium income, which is colloquially referred to as
phases II, and th© computation of taxable investment income
*

which is commonly referred to as Phase I.
Let me now turn, if I can, to the nature ©f the life
insurance rassrva and its relationship to premium.
Th© business of life insurances, I think w© all know.

8

is essentially the shifting of the risk of debt from th©
Xns.ur&d to tli© insurer for a price.
called the premium.

And that consideration is

And th© amount of th® premium is calculated

on a particular assumption# and that assumption is that th®
insurance company will set asid© certain portions of its
premiums that it receives and it will invest those premiums
and those premiums will earn interest and th© whole accumulated
fund will be sufficient to meet claims of policyholders as they
die.
New, th® gross premium is th© amount that the policyholder actually pays.

And that is divided in turn, into two

subordinate, elements: th® net valuation premium and another
element called loading.
Th® net valuation premium is th® amount computed
tti.-.'isr

particular mortality and interest rat® assumptions that

■th® company assumes that it must take into account in order
that these funds will accumulate a particular interest rate

ah-l that it will have a sufficient amount to pay claims as
they arise.

So th® net valuation portion of any particular

.mix™ would be th© amount that th© company has to set aside

and invest in order to meat -the future claims.
QUESTIONs
MR. SMITKs

Da©3 that depend on state law# Mr. Smith?

‘fell# state.law sets up, Mr. Justice

Rahnquist, th© minimum reserve valuati.cn standard in order to
mak® sura that insurance comp scales will be able to pay off their

s
claims, and States might impose certain assumptions, or
whatever.

To that extent it. does depend on stats law.
>■

QUESTION z

• - ** ■

Do most States impose minimum requirements

of that sort?
HR. SMITH:

Yes, because the States have an interest

in making sure that when people pay premiums over a lifetime
that, they are not going to be faced with an insolvent insurance
company which won't, be able to pay off on their claims.
Now, the life insurance reserve is the amount teat
the company must set aside to mast its future claims.

So the

reserve is defined universally by tee life insurance texts as
the sum of these not valuation premiums taken in year by year
pin:.; tbs interest at the assumed rate minus tee debt claims

all defio® a life insurance reserve as derived from premiums.
This is undisputed,

And the tax statute. Section 801(b) CD (B),

uses the term in defining reserves as *amounts set aside to
reset future claims."

It is essential that there be this

set aside notion that the company has this amounts to cover
its reserve liabilities.
So I think that it's fair to say that th@r® is a
direct and fundamental relationship between reserves sad
Pr%aiums.

Indeed, th© decisions of this Court, the early tax

decisions of this Court, like MeCoach y. Insurance Company of
North America, few York Life Insurance Company v. Edwards,
speak in th@se terras.
premiums.

They talk about amounts reserved from

So I think that aspect of the case is fairly well

undisputed.
Turning now to the particular details of th® Life
Instance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 which the Court last
considered in tfc.s Atlas Lifo Insurance 'kymgany casu, this
statute recognises thet lif© insurance companies, unlire the
ordinary taxpayer, don't have unfettered discretion as'to Show
to deal with their gross receipts, and -they must set aside
amounts.

So it permits certain exclusions and deductions of

amounts from two separate k

. station in order to

cover .the reserve liability.
This concept of reserve, which as I said is 'derived from
premiums, j,3

central ■ componant of the statutory system.

11

And the statutory computations which ar® indead complicated
ar© essentially designed to measure the amounts the company
has to add to its reserves and to exclude

them from tax

or to provide for deductions.
There ar® two primary categories of computations.
There is a computation of taxable investment income, because,
as 1 said, the company sets aside these amounts and they arcs
going to earn interest and dividends on investments.

Indeed,

as the Court said in Atlas, thay must invest because if they
don't, they ar© not going to have enough

under their

assumptions to pay off claims.
Then there is a second category which the statute
refers-to as gain from operations, which is essentially income
from all sources, including total taxable investment income
plus also some other income th© company has, for example,
underwriting gains.

In other words, the amount of premiums

&hat it takes in less th® amount of claims that it has to pay
out.

■
Now, th© statute imposes a tax on the company's

taxable investment income plus one-half of the amount by which
its total gain from operations, that is, the second category,
exceeds its taxable investment income.
So essentially the whole statutory mechanics axm
designed to make these computations in order to determine what
amounts have to be set aside from reserves and thereby excluded

12
from 'tax.
Wow, tli© Phase I computations, which we set forth
in formula form, I think the most graphic way to understand
it is to look at pag© 6 of our brief which sets forth a series
of equations.

Although they seem rather onerous, they ara

really not when w© sort of strip it away from detail, because
what you have essentially, you are trying to take the company's;
total investment income and break it down between the amounts
that ar® allocable to reserves and thereby owned by the
policyholders, so to speak, and should be free of tax, and the
amounts that the company

earns for itself which it 4.<*»sn' t

have to set aside and it. has to pay a tax' on that.
So essentially, looking at page 6, we see essentially
tbxr.:: formulas and then a variation of the third formula.

But

what essentially th® statute prescribes is that the first thing
that tho company has to do is compute its earnings rate, and
that simply is its investment income divided by its assets,
and then it multiplies that earnings rate times its reserves
and that yields its tax exclusion.

And you can see that the

third formula essentially substitutes for earnings rate; its
equivalent in the first formula, which is investment yield
over assets.

So you have a formula -that is investment yield

divided by assets times reserves equals the tax exclusion.
And to r-33te.te fct. formula, iris essentially, you can see from
the last way the ‘equation is described that investment yield

13
is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
reserves and th® denominator of which is assets.
One significant thing from this Phase I computation
or expressions as w® hav® set it out in the brief is that the
amount of the exclusion, that is, th® amount of the taxable
investment incoma which is free of tax, is based upon a
proportionate relationship of total reserves to total assets.
Now, tli© Phase II computation is a much mar©
traditional net incoma computation which the Court is
doubtless familiar with from other income tax casas.

That is,

it essentially says take in your gross amount of premiums
and you subtract certain deductions.
in 009 of the Cod®.

That, statute is set cut

Essentially, the unique deduction that,

the life insurance companies are entitled to is set out in
section 809(d)(2), that is, it gets a deduction with
additions to'reservest because that amount of the premium
incoma is supposed to be sot aside in order to meet policy™
holder claims.
1 think with these sort of basics in mind I can now
turn to the facts of this case and put the matter in clear
feeds.

The respondent in this case is a life insurance

company in Oklahoma.

It had deferred and uncollected premiumsf

as most life insurance companies do, and it also had due and
unpaid or uncollected premiums, because it had a typical
grace period of 31 days.

14
Now, there are certain tilings that the courts below
set. forth which ar® plain and undisputed.

Th© policyholder,

of course, as the Chief Justice pointed out, has no obligation,
to pay deferred or uncollected premiums, but — and this is
important — respondent, the life insurance company, has no
°bligation to continua the insurance coverage beyond the point,
for which th© premiums had been, paid, because nonpayment of
the premiums — it’s not like the note at the bank — result
in th© laps® of th® policy.

Th® only thing th© policyholder

is going to gat is his cash surrender value on an ordinary
whoIs life policy.
Question:

Mr. Smith, what happens if I were to

take out a $10,000 policy today to be paid quarterly and I
pay th® first quarterly installment and died tomorrow.
MR. SMITH:

You pay the first quarterly installment

and Qia tomorrow, Mr. Justice Powell, th© company would pay

off '.:h© $1C . 009, but State statutes permit it to deduct from
tost $10,000 the amount of the three quarters- that you should
haw.: paid had you paid it at the beginning.

t.

So in effect

company zusver loses, it is always going to get its premium

on© way or another.
QUESTION:

But th© company would have to sat up the

f ill reserve today.
MR. SMITH:

That, is what 1 am about to get to.

‘11© company would indulge in th© assumption that th® full

15
premium was paid in advance.

That is a.computational assumption

that ail lif© insurance companies —QUESTIONS

But. that is required by Stato law; it's

not just a company assumption.
....

MR. SMITH;

Right.

$

.

It's a computational mode, which

is required by Stata law, but our essential position is that
that is only on® element of the statutory definition of reserve,
The other element of the statutory definition in Section
801(b) (1) (B) is that 'there ba an amount set aside to meet
future clciims.
I think th® important thing about this case is that
the reserves that it sets up, th® full premium received
assumption, so to speak, is simply that, an assumption.

It's

don® as we point out in th® brief and I will just describe in
greater detail later, it: 3 based, on a historical financial
re■orbing practice in which insurance companies for th® last
hundred years have b@®a engaged in a full premium receipt
assumption.
But the important thing is that there is nothing
set aside, and th© assumption, th© fact that the company is
making this assumption, doesn't upset its actual liability to
th® policyholders.

It only is going to have to pay out. with

respect to covering for which it has received premiums.
QUESTIONs

Let*s mak® another hypothetical a little

more favorable to Mr. Justice Powell.

He pays a $100,000

16
premium and pays the first quarter, $25,000, and doesn't die
but lives.

Th© policy lapses after the grace period, doesn’t

it?
MR. SMITH:

The policy lapsos after the grac© period,

that’s right.
QUESTIONs

How does Internal Revenue treat the

$75,000 premium which he has never paid?
MR. SMITH:

It’s not premium income.

It wouldn’t

be premium income, and it. wouldn’t enter into the computation.
Essentially that is the point.
elaborate fiction.

And this whole thing is an

Essentially, th® fact that the company

engages in a full premium receipt assumption doesn't affect
its actual liabilities.

And ©ur point simply is that if it is

going to engage in this assumption, the Commissioner insists
that it apply that assumption to the other elements of the
statutory computation, that is, that it also consistently
asmuaa

that it has these premiums for purposes of assets and

gross amount, of premiums.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, is your answer to Mr. Justice

Powell' entirely correct?

I understood you to say that, when

te?; reserve is set up on a deferred or uncollected premium,
nothing is set aside.

Of course, that is true in the ssase

tht the premium itself has not been collected.

Thar© must be

an offsetting assat on the balance sheet, must there, not?
MR. SMITH:

Yes,

And as w@ point out in the brief,

17
there is an offsetting net valuation of premium assets, but,
you know, the insurance texts uniformly state that this is a
fictional asset, this is a quasi-asset.
1871 convention referred to it.

That’s the way the

And the fact that that gcas on

fch© balance sheet is simply a device that the companies use
in order to snsur® that they are projacting an accurat® pietur®
of their solvency, because otherwise they would haves to commit
real assets to covar these written up liabilities and it would
impair their surplus.
QUESTIONS

I suppose if a policyholder dies, real

assets will have to be used to pay the claim, won’t they?
MR. SMITH:

That is true, and that simply goes into

the actuarial computations that a. policyholder would die.
But the fundamental point is that these reserves,
although they are written up on the full net valuation portion
of the premium, they ar© not really reserves in a real sens®,
th€y are simply don© that way to avoid the burdensome actuarial
work of computing reserves on a policy-by-policy basis.

In

other words, if the company didn't do that, they would have
to compute each reserve on a policy-by-policy basis.
i

It's

/

much easier for the companies to indulge in the assumption,
"ok, we have received all the premiums as of the anniversary
date-."

But once having don© so, the Commissioner says that

yon have to engage in the corresponding consistent assumptions
and take th® full amount of the premiums into assets and gross

18

amount, of premiums.
QUESTION %

2a a sansa they are an overstatement,

bscaus© the premium hasn't bean paid, but aren't they as of
the December 31 date an accurate statement of the contingent
liability that the company has on outstanding policies?
MR. SMITH;

Aren't they an accurate statement?

No, I -QUESTIONs

You can use the term in two senses, I

suppose, on© it’s a measure of how much has been collected in
the way of net valuation portion of premiums, and secondly,
you can use it as a measure of the contingent liability on
policies which ar-s in force.

And it is an accurate statement

of the latter, is it- not?
.MR. SMITH;

No, I don't think so, Mr. Justice Stevens.

The insurance texts uniformly say it is not a real liability.
The reason it's not a real liability is the fact that the
state -statutes, if you die after the first installment —
QUESTION s

But if you die on the date the - statement

is jfeapared, it's a real
MR. SMITH:

liability to that 'extent, isn't it?

Well, no: , because the state statutes

permit the company to deduct the full amount, the other three
quarters.
QUESTIONs

Th© risk includes tea risk of death during

th® ensuing six months or so.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

And the- insurances texts make

19
that clear.

It’s act really a real liability.

QUESTION:

In requiring the maintenance of certain

ratios,, particularly with respect to surplus, don’t state
regulatory' commissions treat the reserves as a full liability?
f

MR. SMITH:

It."s written up as a liability, but th@

point is it's cancelled out by virtus of the fact of this
quasi-asset which is not a real asset, because policyholders
don’t pay c net valuation premium» they pay the full premium.
That "is put on the left side of the balance sheet.

And on

the income statement, they have this elaborate —
QUESTION:
- W>

But doesn’t an insurance company have to

•

maintain a ratio between its reserves and surplus?
MR. SMITH:
yes.

It probably doss for state law purposes,

So this fiction or assumption may be in the Statu

reserve requirement, so to speak.

But our essential point is

that that has nothing to do with the tax computations.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Just fictions.
Just fiction, exactly.

Now, I think as the colloquy has indicated, what, we
are talking about here is computing your reserves on. the
assumption that the full annual premium has been paid as of
the anniversary dates, whether in fact this was the case,
that is what respondent did here.

And

What it also did was to

compute its reserves for Federal income tax purposes on the
basis of the same assumption.

So what it did was it included

20

the net valuation portion of its deferred and uncollected
pr@xii2.mns as if they were amounts sat. aside from premiums
under section 801(b) (1) even though there was in fact, no
amounts set aside and it correspondingly increased reserves
for purposes of the tax computation.
But respondent did not consistently apply that
assumption in making the other required computations.

For

example, on its 1958 return it abandoned that assumption of full
annual premium receipt in connection with computing its;
assets under section 805(b)(4).

So essentially what it did

was say, "W© got these premiums, we will assume we got them in
full for purposes of computing our reserves, but then £ turn
•»

<

around and say that we did not get these- premiums for purposes
of computing its assets."
Now, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on audit
accepted respondeat* s full premium receipt assumption with
respect to reserves, because pursuant to r@gulati.ons which
have been outstanding for 17 years and were promulgated in
temporary form almost at the very outset of th© 1959 Act, the
Co.mrtissionssr applied this full premium receipt assumption as
wall to the other tax computations of assets and gross amount
of premiums.
Now, the Tax Court, upheld the Commissioner

Barkers Union Life case, and it insisted on full inclusion

has ths life insurance? industry itself disavowed this decision,;
but the decision of th© court of appeals gave respondent tha

thorn entirely.

It didn't exclude

And in so holding, as I said at tha outset, th©

court of appeals rejected a uniform line of decisions of th®
Fourth Circuit and also invalidated the Treasury regulations.
Now, essentially this case involved whether and to
what extent these deferred and uncollected premiums are; taken
into account for tax purposes in connection with these threa
major statutory elements — reserves, assets, and gross amount
of premium.

There were several tilings I think that th®

foregoing discussion has demonstrated is undisputed.

On®, it

is undisputed that tha company does not have deferred and
uncollected premiums on hand.

It doesn't have any right to

compel their payment from th® insured, and that nonpayment
of the policy results in lapse.

And th© company essentially

insures, it doesn't do anything for nothing, it doesn't assume

22

any insurance risk for periods for which premiums have not
been.paid, and essentially so given the direct relationship,
fundamental relationship which the Court’s decisions and the
life insurance texts universally describe between reserves
and premiums, it seems to be clear that actual life insurance
reserves in a real sense are completely unaffected by deferred
and uncollected premiums.
So in light of all of this it would seem, as we point
out in our brief, that the treatment of deferred and uncollected
pramiums is a relatively simple matter.

They don’t exist, there

is no premium , there is no liability, there is no set-aside
within the meaning of 801(b) (1) (B) , and it would seem that
logic would dictate that they should be totally ignored for
all purposes, and in fact the Treasury regulations provide,
and that is our alternative position, and. it's set out in
' ^

•

section 801-4(f) of the regulations.
But essentially inclusion of deferred and uncollected
premiums for purposes of all computation, as provided by our
primary position, and which is also set forth in the regulations,
wu- believe is grounded also on internal logic.

Moreover, as

w© sat out in detail and I alluded to earlier, it is traced to
thi-

historical practice of companies

to assume the receipt

of these daferred and uncollected premiums when computing its

reserves.
As the Court, may recall from our brief, the companies

23
in 1871 got togatfcar at. the first annual life insurance
convention and they grappled with the problem of how to computet
their reserves, what to do with these deferred and
uncollected premiums.

And sine® -the actuarial work was then

burdensome because it was before computers, it was then
burdensome to compute reserves on. a policy-by-policy basis,
the reports said that the companies — th© companies said that
they could indulge in ’this assumption of full premium receipt.
In other words, that all the premiums ware received as of the
anniversary data of all th© polici.es in fore®.
But in so providing for that financial reporting
device, the report acknowledged that this assumption, resulted
in an overstatement, of the company reserves, to the extant that
th

net valuation portion was deferred and uncollected

premiums, because they haven't been paid and th© company doesn't
have any insurance liability.
So th® convention had to deal with th® problem sine©
th y had an ov©rstat©m©nt on the right side of the balance
■h

what to do.

I mean, it was an unbalanced balance; sheet,

and it would project an. unfavorable picture of th© company8 s
solvency.

So what th® convention did was to devise some way

of assuring that th® balance sheet would be balanced, and the
solution was to create a fictitious asset on th© left side
of th'? balance sheat, and that asset is called — well, it's
a fancy name — premiums deferred and annuity considerations

24
deferred arid uncollected.

But for these purposes th© statute

used ‘deferred and uncollected premiumsAnd that was an asset
©qual exactly in amount to the overstatement on the right
sids of th® balance sheet.
Now,- essentially what happened was th© accounts
balanced, and more importantly, th© company didn't have to
cover this overstatement with actual assets and thereby, as
I said, impair its surplus.
QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, do I correctly understand that

this original decision by th® industry, then, was to include
th© net valuation portion of the premium on the asset side?
v

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION;

That’s right.
In other words, they took the position

that the industry now takes?
MR. SMITH:
now takes.

They took th© position that th® Industry

But if I may digress just for a momant — the

logical exposition would have it coma later —.but essentially
this is a fictitious assat and in our view the error of th®
industry’s position, is that it actually believes, it 1:; now
*

believed in the fiction that there really is this net
valuation premium or assets.
QUESTION:

X wasn't trying to get to the merits, but

I am correct, am I not, that apparently th® industry's
/

position has been consistent for about a hundred years..
MR. SMITH:

Y@a.

But the important thing, Mr.

25

Justice Stevens, is that: that: industry position is purely for
financial reporting purposes.
QUESTION?
MR. SMITH:

I mad®rstand.
And what we ara involved with here is

trying to grapple with th© problem of how these deferred and
uncollected premiums should ba taken into account for tax
purposes.

I mean* it's on®, thing to set up an ©quatior for

solvency and it's another thing whan you have to start
figuring out what the ratio of total reserves to total assets
is.

QUESTIONS

You speak of that as though these two

things were quits alien and incompatible.

MR. SMITH:
Justica.

Qh„ lh®y ara.

Th®y are, Mr. Chief

And I think in fact th© iif© insurance industry

itself recognizes th© incompatibility of their financial reporting
conventions and th® tax! computations.

Because about 10 years

ago “T- I think we set it out in our reply brief — th® Joint
Committee on Blanks — sort of a peculiar naxae; I suppose it
xEsauriS their forms — met to try to figure out whether they could
r&c.ch some reconciliation.
was impossible.

And they finally concluded that it

They were basically dealing with — you know,,

they had very different goals.

On® is th© goal of measuring

th", amounts of income -that &r© properly includable in the tax
base t aad th© second idling is essentially to make sure that
the company's solvency is accurately portrayed.

26
Th® particular thing 1 was referring to is on page 23

of our raply brief whs re tha committee concluded that "the
basic objectives of the annual statement and of the tax return
are so different in concept as to praelude revision of the annual
statement blank solely to conform to tax accounting concepts."
QUESTION?

It is one thing to recognize that careful

business practice may lend to larger depreciation than the
government would allow for tax purposes.

It is quit® another

to say that these two things are totally separate compartments
and have no relationship to on® another.
Practic©,

It is normal business

Do you suggest normal business practice is to b©

totally ignored in th© taxing area?
MR. SMITH:

No, I don’t suggest that.

I think the

important tiding her-3 is that* Congress has set out a very
ala.borat© computational system for taxing life; insurance
company incona, and they specifically relegated the industry
financial reporting practice to a subordinate and interstitial
role,

i mean, they could have dons-it the other*way, but-they

just, didn't.

And I think the important, thing is that the goals

of these two things are different.

In one sense you try to

just-make sure that the books balance and that your state
d®p::xtment8 don't think you are insolvent.

And in the other

instance you ar® trying to do two things — measure a

proportionate amount of- taxable investment income that has to
b-V sil located -to

serves, and taesa reserves are computed on the

2?
assumption of full premium payment.

And. our submissiori is

that the dsnominator of that fraction , sine© th© fracti.on is
reserves over assets, similarly must fca computed on the same
assumption.
compute the •

You can;t take a formula which has a fraction and
numerator one way and th© denominator fch® other

way and @xp©ct to reach a result which th© fellow who made; up
the formula contemplated.

I think that is really all there is

to it.
Wall, essentially our fundamental submission in this
case is that a life insurance company can't first treat
deferred and uncollected premiums as paid for purposes of its
reserves, and when it increases its reserves it essentially
decreases its tax liability, and than turn around and assert
that they haven't been paid, th© same premiums, for purposes
of computing its assets and gross amount of premiums, the two
statutory computations.
Now, X think the need for consistency in this area
is- graphically demonstrated, and. probably more easily demonstrated,
by reference to th© Phase II, net income computation, because
the Phase II net incoma computation says essentially, "OK,
let's take all your gross amount of premiums and put them in
income and then we will subtract out your additions to your

reserves. H
Now, th® point of th© matter is, as I said earlier,
■this is an overstatement of reserve.

It's not really!a

28

reserva.

But feha Commissioner of Internal Revenue in his

primary position on the regulations is willing to say to the
life insurance Industry, "OK, you have been doing it that way
for a hundred years.

w@ will acknowledge the fact that you want

to indulge in this full premium receipt assumption.

But

essentially if you ar© going to get a deduction from income
for reserves -- and that's what 809(d)(2) provides is a
then I think there would h® no rational basis for

deduction

saying that you could ignora the income on which the deduction
is based.

Essentially you have got to make the same

assumptions in connection with computations of income and
deductions.
And ’the same thing, I think, is true with respect
to the Phase I computations.
multiplies

As I said earlier, that essentially

your investment income: times the fraction of

reserves" over assets.

And if you are going to inflate your

reserves at th© expense» of your assets, you are going to have
essentially a distorted, you are going to have an inflated
tax exclusion.

And essentially it is going to be based on

a sat of inconsistent assumptions.
Essentially we think that is really where th® court
of appeals went awry, because it sort of assumed that the.
r@ssrw.s ware off to th® side.

Reserves are on® thing end then

wa turn around and say the premiums really haven’t been received.
But the fact is that the computation of reserves is based on an

29

assumptio» of full premium receipt, and therefore that sera©
assumption, if the formula is going to hava any meaning, has
to b® consistently applied to the other ®l©r(©nts of the
statutory equation.
QUESTION?

Mr. Smith, just let ma throw a thought out

and be sur© you address it in due cours®,

Ar@ you going to

address the problem of v;hat portion of the premium income is
properly includable?

In other words, is it the antir© loading

charge or just —
MR. SMITH;

Yes, that’s right.

That's what I planned

to turn t© now, and I would actually like to save about 4 minutes
for rebuttal.
Essentially — I think that what I said indicates
an imbalance.

The Court of Appeals decision just makes no sense:

under the statute.

There is another erroneous position advanced

that of the American Council of Life Insurance.

And they

say oss@at5.ally, nWa agree that a certain amount of deferred.
and uncollected premiums hav® to b© taken into account, but
w© think it really should only be the net valuation portion."
Essentially what they are saying is, tfe© assumption that they
ar© willing to agree exists, is that the company receives the
net valuation portion of the deferred and uncollected premiums,
that is, the amount

which, as I referred to ©arlier, is the

fictional quasi-asset which is put on the left side of the
balance sheet simply to balance the statement.

30
Now, as we point. out in our reply brief, •this
completely mischaract@ria;©s the full premium receipt assumption,
because the assumption underlying the reserve computation is
that the policyholders have paid the full amount of the premium
and not some lesser amount.

As I said earlier, policholders

pay the full amount of premiums and not seme lesser amount.
Essentially, their reliance on theNAIC balance
shv at. essentially, as I said earlier,

kind of indulges in a

belief that, this is a real asset, and it isn't the real asset.
QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, my question really related to

how m^ch of the loading would the government*s position include
in income on that assumption.
MR. SMITH:

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very w@ll, Mr. Smith.

Mr. Hughes.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF VESTER T. HUGHES, JR.
i

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HUGHES:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

This is indeed a close case, but I don't think in
/

the seas® that on® would understand a close case as it has
been presented thus far.
It's a close case, I think, growing out of the
problems that people have confused actuarial, assumptions with
accounting assumptions.

Historically reserves have been, a

matter required to se© what the solvency of a company is.

One

of tii© earlier Chief Justices of this Court in New York in
1905 and 1906 worked very hard to try to clear up insurance
scandals, because people had paid money to life insurance
companies and had not. been paid upon death.
Whfsn the 1959 Act cams along — actually it applies
to the year 1958 — an attempt was made to change the general
formal*, that had been followed since 1921 in the taxation of
lif-s insurance companies.
tax investment inco-v®.

Since IS21 the format had been to

The way the taxation of investment

income had bssn worked was to apply a percentage, an arbitrary
percentage at on© period of time, and a percentage related to
industry averages to reserves., to what we aro talking about in
th© first part of this case, to the reserves of to© company, to

34
determiaj© what: warnings should be there to ensure that a
policyholder would receive th® £ac® amount of his policy upon
death.

Once that amount had been calculated, ©arnings in

excess of that aiaount were taxed at a given rate.
Smith pointed out, in 1958 — actually

But as Mr.

bill was signed by

President Eisenhower in 1959, but it does apply to 1958 and
years after that tins© — the determination was mad© to take a
total income approach in two stages, actually in thr©e stages.
The third stag© is not in question here.
The investment income approach of the past was
reiterated.

That's Phase I.

Th© definitions of reserves that

had obtained since 1871 were left intact.

The committi®

rev-orts indicated there was no intention to change this.

The

early case, the Heroic?, case, a district court case in K'ew
Jersey, Hcarold v. Prudential Life, had exactly this question
before, it. in 1917.

This Court said, yes, premiums arising

from the liability on policies with respect to, which there
are deferred and uncollected premiums will be taken in full,

r;’ill ba accounted in full.

It's a liability.

But the income

not received will not fo© so taken.
Th© go^nmak has argued her® today, and it's a
fact that four circuits have gone against us on th© basic

re and th#?:.

ara lor® today because the Tante

fe a. . la :d that -the item

and uncollected

premiums arc not income, axe not assets, but policies with

35
respect to which th© liability is determined actuarily on an
annual basis will b® taken into account .in full, that is, tha
re8©rv©s with respect to such policies will b® taken into
account in full.
The government didn't quit© answer th© Chief Justice's
question on what would happen if fir. Justice Powell had taken
out th© $100,000 life insurance annual premium policy and the
first $25,000 was paid in th© last quarter of the year.
$75,000 remains unpaid.

It's not due.

So

It will be due

quarterly, th© remaining $75,000.
-gw, the liability for th© policy is th© full
liability when it’s taken out.

If Justice Powell were to die

in. the maaatima, the government's position is that at that
year end. Standard Life would have had $75,000 of income,
although of course what it really had was a loss.

That is

prosupposing th® death after year end and before the payment
°f th© second premium.
QUESTION;

Hr. Hughes, wouldn't you concede that

thar© is at least a superficial plausability to th© government* :3
approach that if a figure goes into th® numerator, it ought
s

to go into the denominator, too?
MR. HUGHES;

Mr. Justice Rahnquist, 1 would say that

But in tha ©sample w® have given, if the government

Even though w® did not gat that

income, we would never gat that income, the policy liability

to which the $25,000 was generated did in fact

occur.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hughes, on that assumption

wouldn’t

the $75,000 premium be deducted from the payoffv and therefore
you would have received the income.
MR. HUGHES:
Question:
MR. HUGHES:

We would receive it in the next year.,
well.
And that’s the timing matter.

This

Court iuis often said that timing depends on accounting concepts.
That’s why I wanted to differentiate, between actuarial concepts
and accounting concepts.

In the early case of Burnet v.

Sanford & Brooks, you recall, the dredging contract expanses
ha& bean realized in earlier years, and when the taxpayer wanted
to match those earlier deductions against fell© later income,
this Court said no, it’s on an annual basis.
QUESTION;

Mr. Hughes, maybe I am not following you,

but suppos® you are on a calendar year basis and the death
occurs on the 30th of March.

Why do you say fell© $75,000 comes

in a later taxable year, as I understood you to say?
MR. HUGHES:

All right, sir, let’s take soma specific

because it will com© in the income.
Th© entire question her© —
QUESTION?

I think you confuse when you speak of

taxable years and it isn't necessarily so.
MR. HUGHES?

Mr. Justice, I believe that this may b©

on® •-.•£ th© problems with the casa, then, because deferred and
uncollected premiums refer only to premiums which on December 31
all life insurance companies are on a calendar year — refers
only to premiums that on December 31 are going to be paid in

tha next year if th® policy remains in force.

In other words,

if there is a quarterly paid policy and on November 1 th®
first premium is paid, what w© are talking about are the three
premiums that th®n will be paid February 1 and May 1 and in th®
remaining quarters.
It is only when the premium payments ar@ split over
year and that there is a question hear®.

And let me suggest

39
that th© Court might considar that when this matter was first
considered in the Western national case by the Tax Court,
Judge Drennan, Chi<a£ Judge of the Tax Court at that time,
speaking for th© Tax Court# held exactly what- the Tenth
Circuit held in Standard iif©«

Thera was a re argument of the

case in 6 69, and th® Tax Court changed to the view that the
American Council of Life Insurance is going to propound today,
and indeed th© view which w® think is th© alternative view that
the Court could reach.
if strict accrual accounting is followed, than
prsmuns deferred and uncollected ar® neither income no:r assets.
If this Court determines that Congress intended that there be
i

an- overlay on accrual accounting resulting from the section
318 (a) ,which refers to the National Association of Insu3ran.ce
Commissioners,

then the position of th® industry is supportable.
*

Th?:; way that comes about is to say that there is a modification,
a modification, of accrual accounting insofar as the accounting
■ h:

is incident# that has been fostered

. ever since 1951

wh'-i there was first promulgated an approach of operations

th® Tax Court continued to hold.

But the- circuits than# as th©

is a

Wa are going to follow

And I think it is by saying what

act is not & fact, ©r what is not a fact is a fact, -that

the courts have com® up with the situation w@ have today where
we first have th© vour courts saying you us® gross incom©,
and as Mr. Justice Stevens pointed out in Federal and the
earlier Fifth Circuit case of Great Commonwealth what had
happened was that, is not quit® fair.

The expanses incidant

to the collection of that, premium, the sac® thing that gives
rise to the fantasy in the first place,is also a proper
deduction from it.

So agents' commissions war© allowed.

Th® next stag© was a logical extension of that
Particular proposition.

State premium taxes would also serve

to be a reduction, because if the premium was collected, th®
prerid.urn tax would be. due.

Xf th© premium was not collected,

tho premium tax would not b© due..

But under all accrual

accounting, all accrual accounting theory, th@r© is no basis
for saying that that income has been realized.
Mow, thsrsi is a basis for saying that 818, where it
refers to th® National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
is an overlay which would take you back to th© alternate
position.
The government has mad© a great deal, of the argument
of consistency, and Mr. Justice Rahnquist noted this, that at
least prime facie it has a lot of appeal.

But part of that

41

appeal goes to assuming that, there is a simple equation»

In,

Phase I, for example, it's either the investment, yield of the
year in question or the average of the preceding five years„
So it’s already out of balance if it’s the average of the five
years.

The reserve figure is not merely the stata reserve

figure, it’s adjusted reserves.

Congress explicitly stated

that it was going to follow the state reserving process
except in a number of instances which were carefully delineated.
The first of these is deficiency reserves and pension reserves.
Deficiency reserve is the kind of reserve set up if tins
premium is not enough to take care of th© net valuation
portion.

The stated reason for that exception is that a number

of companies in 1958 and 1S59 had large deficiency reserves
that would flow back into income.

And the then Secretary of

the Treasury, Robert Anderson, in his presentation to Congress
said that it was not deemed fair to.cause income to be
generated in that fashion.
■This* next is reserve strengthening.

Reserve

strengthening occurs when a company determines that it is going
to increase voluntarily the amount of reserves held.
s ■

Now,

'

Congress put a limitation on this, as indeed you would
anticipat©, because if a company could happily decide it had
unneeded surplus funds at th© end of the year and strengthen
V

reserves and thus have that kind of impact on the year in
question and perhaps eliminate its tax, then this might become

42
a vehicle for avoidance that; would not be tolerable to the
revenues.
So in order to tak© care of that, Congress said
this takes effect in ths next year in the Phas© I computation.
In the Phas© II computation, it followed the general
accounting practice of a 10-year period of taking it into
account as a deduction.

And it's, of course, there that this

increase in reserves ar© taken into account in Phase II.

I

don't believe that was clear in the government!s argument.
It’s not th« amount of reservas that you get a deduction for,
it's the increase in reserves.

And the contrary is true, of

course, if you mak® money and there is a decrease in reserves,
you have income from the reserve computation in Phas® II.
I'

So

depends on whether your reserves are going up or your

reserves are going down.
The third variation in arriving at tills adjusted
reserves that Congress saw fit to put into effect is what is
known as the 818(c) election.

The 818(c) election says -chat

a company that computes its reserves on a preliminary term
^asis has the option of treating the deduction as level for
Phase IX purposes.

This means this was of particular benefit

to new and growing companies because it meant that in their
first year of a policy where many times the commissions will
exceed the premium, they did not have to establish a reserve.
But then, in tee succeeding years, they would talc© into account,

43
as, for example, on a 20--y©ar pay,

fch@y would take into

account the reserve computations for the succeeding 19 years
for state law purposes, but for Federal income tax.purposes
it was for a 20~yaar

period.

Finally, Congress said, in what was called tee
IG-for-i rule, popularly known as tee "Mange Formula"

— Mr.

Menge was a distinguished actuary, president of Lincoln. National
Life

that we need to tali® into account what earnings

actually occur.

We need to sea what happens, in fact, to one

of these companies.

5 percent, 2 percent? — and adjust their reserves accordingly.
Simply stated, the Mehge Formula would have the effect if,

fcr example, the interest assumption ware 3 percent, the
actual return wars 4 pardent, it meant that the earnings were
better than anticipated.
reserves.

So you would reduce by 10 percent

You wouldn't have 100 percent of the reserve figure,

you would have only 90 percent.

Contrariwise, if the earnings

wore 2 percent instead of the 3 percent assumption, it meant
that you should have had more reserves, at least in a taxing
sens©, if you are going to cover what is necessary to pay off
tee policies.

Therefor®, it. would be 110 percent.

Mow, I submit that these four adjustments to reserves
decimate entirely any notion that you can plug figures in in
equation fashion, that, there is some symmetry, that there is

44
some balance.

&ad as has been said in the earlier questions

a^d been noted by the earlier questions, solvency is terribly
important, terribly important, to the Federal government as
wall as to th® State governments.
I call th® Court’s attention in this regard to th©
very interesting exchanges that ware on th© floor, and I -think
they are best stated perhaps in th© amicus brief on pages 16
and 17, when th® matter was being discussed, and in response
to various questions, Mr. Mills, in response to questions from
Mr-, Simpson, who was minority leader, and others:
"The committee has no intention of placing jurisdic­
tion of the management of insurance company reserves within
th -j hands of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue."
"We ar® trying to preserve as best we can in this
bill the management of the industry in th© hands of the State
ulatory a«

a not to change in any way that situation,

so as to turn over to th© Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the.
Secretary of tin Treasury, or anyone else in Washington the

45
regulatory authority.
"We arcs not saying that a company may not accumulat®
reserves if th® State regulatory body tells it to accumulata
reserves.

We ara not levying a tax on. th© accumulation of

those reserves.”
The inviolate character of reserves as determined
for State law purposes, modified» however» by the four
exceptions which Congress spalled out very carefully, it
seams to me, causes th© conclusion that the only result that
really can b@ supported ifex terms of the legislative history
is that the reserves as stated for State law purposes, as
modified by the four specific exceptions that Congress
©n-actod and enacted very carefully, must stand.
1 was amazed and maybe mildly appalled at the?

government's suggestion in its reply brief that both th©
Commissioner's primary and alternative positions represent
different but squally valid methods of dealing with th®
overstatement of reserves caused by the inclusion of the net
valuation portion of deferred and uncollected premiums in
reserves.

But there was no deduction.

Th© same thing in th®

.jerrican .Automobile case, the deduction and th© income items
do rot have to be matched.

They do not have to be matched.

And whether it is th® deduction first or the income first.
Burnst v- Sanford s Brooks, a classic cas© from this Court
many years ago, th© taxpayer was out. of luck.

His deductions

had run out, and when h© got his money later, it was taxed.
Now th© government has this feel that somehow or
another Congress did not mean what, it said.,

In 810 it says

"accrual method of accounting shall be applied."

Soma way they

say, they say under all known accrual methods of accounting
there, is no income because th® taxpayer has no right; to th©

47
premi tans, may or may not collect them.

All that happens to

the policyholder is that his policy is cancelled.
QUESTION;

On. that point I wish you would pursue for

me the hypothetical question I put to Mr. Smith about Justice
Powell's $100,000 premium.

He has paid th© first quarter and

doas not die, but lives, but declines to pay the second quarter,
just lets th® policy lapsa.

Nov/, what happens with respect

to that $75,000 of unpaid premium?
MR. HUGHES;
QUESTION:

Mr. Chief Justice —
Before you start# would you reduc?' that

premium to $100, please?
(Laughter.)
MR. HUGHES;

with the Chief Justice's permission,

I will reduce it to $100.
QUESTION;

Mr. Smith wouldn't agree to that.

He

wants a larger tax,
MR. HUGHES;

But the novelty of th® government's

position shows up there, because under the taxpayer's position,
assuming that Justice Powell survives, th© $75 would come into
incerne in the succeeding year if paid.

Under th© government's

position, the $100 would coma into income and the $75 would
never foe paid.
QUESTION;

Mr. Smith disagreed.

He said there would

never be. any tax levied on that,
MR. HUGHES:

Oh- under the government's primary

48
positio»., at the sad of th© year the deferred and uncollected
and under the position of 'the four circuits ■— the gross
premiums, not the net premiums, except as modified then by
Federal and Great CarMitonwealth, but th© gross premiums would be

under th© government9 s position th® entire $100 would b?s
included in income and there would, be no deductions attached,
to that $100 in income under Phase II and no reduction in
a'ssats under Phas© I.
N-*

What it boils down to is the very bizarre position
that if a year premium is paid in advance because on that basis
th© taxpayer at least gets th© deductions incident to it, -the
taxpayer is batter off than if it isn’t paid, because h& may
or may not gat it in the succeeding year.
bizarre result.

It’s a very, very

And 2 submit it comes about by reason of th®

Tax Court* s having had its second thought.

I think that initial

Tax Court opinion is worthy of consideration in Western
National, because it is very much like th© Tenth Circuit.

It

took a number of years of dealing with imagination and fantasy
and th® Alic® in Wonderland world of taxation of life insurance
companies and language like this that gees all through th©
opinions to com© back to th© point that th® Tenth Circuit was
right, and it was right in th® same way th© Tax Court was
right in its initial opinion.
Now, our second position is that at least th© industry

49
position is correct, and that would com© about depending on a
reading— now, 1 have difficulty reading 818 this way — but on
a reading of 818,,to go back into th© preceding paragraphs, if
you will look at the government's brief in the appendix.,

I

guess it is on pag© 19A, "All computations entering into th®
determination of th© taxes imposed by -this part shall be made—
”

(1) und©r an accrual method of accounting.3

If we stop there and nothing else was said, th©
taxpayer clearly wins, there is no income, there are no
assets.

But then at th© end there is a paragraph that says,

"Except as provided in th© preceding sentence, all such
computations shall ba made in a manner consistent with th®
manner required for th© purposes of th© annual statement
approved by th© National Association of Insurance Commissioners."
Now, if that means that accrual accounting is
modified to the extent of the annual statement procedures,
a net valuation portion of ' th© premium would be included in
assets and bs included in income.

If what this paragraph or

sentence really means is rather that th® taxpayer,, if he is,
for example, accruing discount bn a bond, he must do it in £hs
same way that'he accrues for annual statement purposes. If that
l!?* what it means and you apply it to strict accrual accounting,
the Tenth Circuit is right, and the 16 judges of th® Tax: Court
were right the first tiro© they considered the matter.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. SINN ON BEHALF
OF THE AMERICAN COUNCIL OF LIFE INSURANCE,
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MS. 2INNs
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas© th©

Th® American Council of Life Insurance wishes to

express its appreciation to Mr. Hughes for ceding a portion
of his time to the Council so that th® views of th© industry
may b® presented to this Court.
As the Court is aware, the Council occupies th®
middle ground between th© primary position of th© govsmnvant
in this case and th© primary position of the taxpayer.

Our

view is that only the rmt valuation portion of deferred and
uncollected premiums is properly included in assets and income

53
and that there is no basis for reducing reserves on account
of deferred and uncollected premiums.
In the few minutes available to m, I would like to
outline for the Court the four considerations which we believe
should guide decision in this cases.

Thm first of these relates to reserves.

Much of

the ground has already been covered, and I will simply sum
up.

Reserves have been handled the way w® say they should be

handled since 1871, long before there was an income tax.

The

precise issue that is raised hare was raised and decided
adversely to the government in 1918, and the government didn't
prosecute an appeal of that case.

Mors significant, in 1921

thii then Bureau of Internal Revenue acquiesced in the 1918
decision.

From 1921 to 1951 everyone proceeded on the

understanding that reserves ware not to be reduced on account
of deferred and uncollected premiums.

In 1959 Congress looked

at reserves very carefully, and as Mr. Hughes points out, it
na: .3 four specific exceptions to the rul<*t of State law
:;p.-•llcablc to reservas, but it made no exception for deferred
collected premiums.

Indeed, in the government's -own

regulation which it relics upon to reduce reserves, section
1.101-4, which appears ©a page 19A of ths appendix to the
gc ^arnroant* s brief, the caption of that, regulation is
rMjvnfenafc to Life Insurance Reserves."

And in the body of

tf.afc regulation, it is stated that if assets and income are

54
not; stated the way the government says they should be seated,
then we will reduce your life insurance reserves.
Tha point I am trying to make is that th© government's
own regulation in force for 1? years presupposes that there
is to ba no reduction in reserves on account of deferred and
uncollected premiums.

As far as th© regulation itself, we

think w@ have covered it adequately in our brief.

There is

not a word in the legislative history which authorises a
regulation of this sort, and whilo Mr. Smith has objected to
our characterization of the regulation as strong-arm and
pernicious, fee has not objected to the characterization of it
being unique.

I know of no other situation in th® tax law

wh:;r© the government says if you don't report one item th© way
wa say you should report it, we will take something away from
you that you are otherwise entitled to.

So much for reserves.

let m® turn to my second point.

Mr. Justice Bshnquist asked a question about consistency, why
is it that we don't do the numerator and denominator th© sane
way.

My answer is because th© Cod© says so, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
s@cti.o.n 801.

Th® reserve computation is determined under
Th© method of accounting applicable to assets

and income is determined under s@cti.oa 818.

Section 813 is

also set cut. on page 19A of the appendix to the government's
brief, and if the Court will turn to it, it will see that
insofar as relevant her®, w® are talking about section 818(a)(1)

55
which refers to the accrual method of accounting, and wa ar@
talking about in th© flush language at th© end of -that provision
the NAIC method of accounting.
Now, what th® government is asking this Court: to do,
we think, is to read an additional sentence into section 818(a)
that is not there which would say, in effect, in applying
>»

this provision, or notwithstanding the foregoing provisions,
^ shall ha assumed that deferred and uncollected premiums
ha -a been received in cash.

Now, if that sentence was in 'there,

I don't, think we would, be here now.

But it's not in there.

The government, it seams to us, is taking a position exactly
contrary to the position it took in th© Foster Lumber case.
There it told th© Court, "Don't read in additional words into
section 172, the net operating loss provision.

Read the Cod©

y.‘,i way it was written," th® government told this court.
Now, we think if that was the standard that was
applicable in th© Foster Lumber case, which involved the
oo;r.svfhat complicated provisions of net operating' loss and
capital gain, a fortiori that standard should apply in th©
interpretation of th© arcane life insurance company taxing
provisions.
QUESTION:

Of course, the government prevailed in

the Foster Lumber didn't it?
MR. ZXNNs

Yes.

had that's exactly our point.

The

government prevailed and the Court, didn't read th© language in.

So
And we think that , as I say, regardless of th© differences in
that case, this is an a fortiori case, given th© more
difficult provisions that are involved here.
This brings m® to mv third point, and that is how
choos© between the accrual method of accounting that is
specified in section 818 and th© NAIC method.

Th® lower courts!

have simply read out of section 818(a) th® last sentence of
that provision.

They have looked at it, and they havs said,

well, it's accrual, and they have ©ith®r held for th® Standard
Life

position her©, because as Mr. Hughes has pointed but, if

you apply strict accrual accounting, the judgment of th.®
court below should be affirmed, or if they had read in' th@
assumption, sentence that the government tails us should b©
re..-:id into this provision, they have held that it, is accruable,
which is also right.

If the'-ambunt was received in cash, under

th® accrual method it8s read in.
QUESTIONi

Just precisely what sentence were you

referring to in 118 that th® government is reading out?
MR. ZXHN:

Th® government is reading in, not reading

QUESTION:

You just said that they were reading out.

MR. SI HIT:

Ho.

out.

Th® courts below in interpreting

813(a) have read out hhs last sentence, th© "except" sentence,
which refers to the NAIC position.

They have either said, as

the court below did, under strict accrual accounting, with no

57
government s@at.Qnc© in there, what th© Tanth Circuit said
here, nothing is includable in assets or income.

Or they have

said that the accrual language of the statute simply takes
precedence over the NAIC reference in the last paragraph.
Now, wa think that this provision should be inter­
preted in a way to give play to both provisions, and I would
like to suggest to th® Court the way in which w© think this
should be done.
applied.

W@ think that th© two-step process should b©

Th© first step is to determine whether a particular

item of income or expense is to be accounted for currently under
th© accrual method specified in 318(a)(1).

If it is to be

accounted for currently under th© accrual method, we think that
is the end of the inquiry.

That overrides the "except”

language at th© end of section 818(a).

If, on th® other hand,

as is. this case, accrual accounting dees not r@qu.ir® an item
of income or expense to be taken into account, -than it seems to
us that it’s appropriate to go forward and s@© if that item is
to be accounted for currently under the KMC method of
accounting, th© result in this case would be to adopt th©
NAIC method ©f accounting that we urge upon the Court.
way

In this

w© believe both sentences of -she statutory provision can

be given meaning without reading one or th© other out.
Finally, let me deal briefly with consistency, and
let. res reduce the numbers we used before to just $1 if I may,
Mr. Jus-tie© Powell.

What the government is. saying here essentially

58
in fch© Phas© I computation is this s

If you add a dollar to

th© numerator of the fraction, a dollar to the denominator
of the fraction, in most situations that is going to increase
the fraction and increase the exclusion.
add- a dollar to each.

That is our position,

So th® government says add a. dollar to

the numerator, but add $1.25 to th© denominator because that is
th© gross premium.

It says we should do this because we want

to maintain the proportional relationship.
The difficulty with th® government’s position is that
xt is not uncommon for 80 or 90 percent of that 25 cents of
loading to consist of expenses, and what we are talking about,
her® is a problem as familiar to this Court as any in the tax
law where you cut off the accounting cycle.

If you cut th®

accounting cycle off after th© receipt of th® $1.25 but before
the. payment of th® expanses , that is going to produc® a result
that is disproportionately high, both under th© fraction and
'S t .17! Phase IX computation, -because you will have th© same
imbalance there.

Th® $1.25 will com© into income currently,

but. th®, let’s say, 20 cents won’t com® into expense until the
subseqtier.t period.
rev, our solution to th© problem of adding a dollar
to the numerator and a dollar to th© denominator is not a
perfect solution.

I suppos® th© perfect solution would b© add

a dollar to the numerator and let’s say $1.05 to th© denominatos*,
if

that is what you are really going to have left after

59
you pay the expans®.

But in this area I don’t think w@ can

strive for perfection.

I think the method that we urge upon tins

Court comes closest to that.

The government’s method, on the

other hand, overstates income in the Phase II computation by
not allowing for expenses and overstates it in Phase I by not
reducing the assets by the amounts that would be paid out in
recognition of these expenses.
There have been references this rooming to the
Great. CcKsmoawea 1 th line of cases, and v@ think those cases
were correctly decided.

But we think they don't nearly go far

enough. • With one exception they have been limited to the
Phase II computation and have not bean carried over into
Phas© X.

w® think they should be.

The government truly seeks

proportionality, and it seems to us that assets ought to be
reduced on the assumption that the expenses war© paid in cash,
if w© are going to assume w© received the premiums in cash,
\m see no reason why it; is not equally fair and seasonal'1© to

assuror the payment of expenses in cash.
Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH OH
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITHs

I will quickly just make a few points.

X think the taxpayer’s position and the industry*s

60
position on. th® question of reserves stem

from the notion

that if State law says it’s OK to write up the reservas this
way, well., that is th® @nd of th© matter.

Th© point is simply

that tills Court in its decision in Mew York Life Insurance
cerapany v. Edwards specifically rejected a contention like that.
It said the fact that a State official calls something a reserve
dossn't mean it's a life insurance reserve, teat it's a reserve
from premium.

And th© Federal statute, the definition,

801(b)(1)(B)„ uses th® term "set aside."
have something to set asid®.

tod you have got to

If there is nothing to set aside,

th@r© is no res@rv@.
Our position simply is that th© Commissioner is
willing to accept tea assumption ©f full premium payment, but
th® taxpayer can't simply say, "OK, we will accept it for
purposes of r©s©rvss but not accept it for purposes of assets
and pram!urn income.B
2 went to say something about tea difference between
th-fi Phasa I and Phase II computation in response to something
Mr. Sian just said, which I think is important,

tod that is

th©r® is no warrant, no matter how th© Great Commonwealth

is ultimately resolved on expensas,

there, is absolutely no warrant in the statute for providing for
an offset from assets for any expenses at all.

61
has' a building which it paid $1 million for, and that building
is mortgaged for $500,-000, that building goes in tha asset
computation as $1 million and not at somathing ©Is©.

And

simply to put th® matter another way, if a lif© insurance
company has accrued expenses which in fact it is allowed to
take deductions for oa the Phase II computation, those deductions
don't reduce its assets until it actually pays them out.

And

our position her© is simply that there is no deduction for any
expenses from assets in the Phase I computation until there is
an actual disbursement from the life insurance company’s assets,

That is not an answer to Mr. Zinn's argument

that you first .look at th® accrual and see that it does not

doesn't, you ara then within the "©xcept" language and now you

Doer on© aver land in th® "except” sentence?
I think you will land in the "except"

sa ttenc© to th© extent that the NAIC method is recognized in
the statute.
That leads mf.s to th® last point I want to make, which
is, you know, w@ are talking about these expenses.

thing is the NAIC method has a deduction for loading to offset
th© overstatement.

But the Seventh Circuit said that loading

is simply not an ©xpans®.

I think the important thing for

us is to look at th© statute.

Congress was aware of the NAIC

m-athod and it didn't provide for a deduction for loading.

The

Xsiportaat thing is first to look at the statute, and to -the
extent that fch© NAIC method is not inconsistent with an
accrual method of accounting, I think that can supply guidance
here.
