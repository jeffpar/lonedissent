Z122.ESDINGS

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

'We will hear arguments

first this morning in Number 75-1221, United States against
Consumer Life Insurance Company and the two other cases con-?
solidated with that case.
Mr0 Smith,
ORAL ARGUMENT OP STUART Aa SMITH, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR„ SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
These three Federal income tax cases are here on
writs of certiorari from the United States Court of Claims
and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit„
Tvjo cases, Consumer Life and Penn Security, are

from the Court of Claims and the First f&ilroad case is from
the Fifth Circuit,
They present a common questlon\ Whether these tax­
payer insurance companies meet the.definition of a life insur­
ance company under the Internal Revenue Code.
Our tax system provides a marked preference for
life insurance companies insofar as it grants them a narrow
tax base.
The Court has previously considered the effect of
that narrow tax base about ten years ago in the Atlas Life
Insurance Company case.

4

Now, other stock insurance companies, such as those
engaged, in the sale of non-life insurance, such as cancelable
accident and health or casualty insurance, are taxable on
••

i,

their total annual net income as any other corporation*
But life insurance companies have this preference,
so it is to their decided advantage to qualify as a life
insurance company*
But like most taxpayers —- that is, like most
insurance companies, the taxpayers in these cases do not
feel exclusively in either life or non-life insurance, but in
a combination of those two types of insurance*
The Congress, since 1921, has provided a mathematical
test in the statute designed to limit the preferential life
insurance company tax treatment to those companies whose pre­
dominant business is the assumption of life .Insurance risks*
It is done so by — in Section 801(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code \\ihieh represents, essentially, the same
statute that has existed for some fifty-five years.

Essentially,

the statute provides that reserves are the appropriate measur­
ing rod for determining whether an insurance company is a life
insurance company.
The statute provides a fraction, the numerator of
which is life insurance reserves, for purposes of this case,
and the denominator of which is total reserves.
In order to be a life insurance company, to qualify

5
for this preferential treatment, that fraction has to be
more than 50$ * so that your life insurance reserves have to be.
more than one-half of your total reserves*
QUESTION:

That could.be a matter of statutory

definition of whatever the life insurance —
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Exactly *
Basically, a life insurance company is

an insurance company that — more than half of whose business
is life insurance measured by its reserves*
MR* SMITH: That is correct, Mr* Justice Stewart*
QUESTION:
MR, SMITH:

Is that it?
Now, the question in this case, in these

cases, that is, focuses on the quantity of the denominator in
the fraction, that is, total reserves*
These cases present the question as to whether certain
cancelable accident and health insurance reserves, which are
•*
reserves on what is undisputably non-life business, are
includable in these taxpayers' total reserves*
It is also undisputed that if it is includable ~.
these health and accident reserves are Includable, as we
submit — these taxpayers fail to qualify as life insurance
companies.

If they are excluded, as the Court of Claims held

and as the taxpayers submit, then they do qualify.
The case focuses on the effect of two different types
of transactions which are presented in combination in all three

cases
For purposes of convenience, we have referred in
our brief to these transactions as Treaty I and Treaty I!„
This is the nomenclature of the Consumer Life Insurance
Company case which presents both of those types of reinsurance
transactions„
Consumer, as I said,, presents both kinds of trans­
actions .

Penn Security presents a Treaty I type arrangement

and the First Railroad case presents only a Treaty II type
arrangement <,
We submit that the facts demonstrate with abundant
clarity that the accident and health insurance business was
attributable to the taxpayers so that the accident and health
insurance reserves are includable in the total reserves of
these taxpayers, so that their denominator is increased and
the fraction falls below fifty percent*
The end result of our submission is that the Court
of Claims was incorrect in holding that these companies
qualify as life insurance companies and the Fifth Circuit was
correct in holding that the taxpayer in that case did not
qualify*
I think it probably would — instead of stating the
facts of each case, seriatim., since they are essentially
similar, it probably would be helpful to put the facts before
the Court in terms of the Treaty I and Treaty II generic type

o
r
transactions, because, as I said, the arrangements in all
three cases are essentially the same*
In the Treaty I type transaction, the taxpayer
insurance companies, that is, Consumer Life and Penn Security,
are subsidiaries of corporations engaged in the consumer loan
business.
This accident and health insurance that we are
involved with here is credit accident and health insurance
because when these people borrow money from a consumer loan
business they generally are encouraged by life Insurance and
accident and health insurance.
QUESTION:

May I interrupt?

There is no question here about the term life
insurance that a borrower takes out.
MR, SMITH:

No, Justice Stewart.

I think that was

resolved in the Alineo case but that is life insurance and we
are not disputing the correctness of that decision of the
Court of Claims.
QUESTION:

This is also term accident and health

insurance, single premium, isnEt it?
MR. SMITH:

Exactly*

Thafcfs what is involved here.

When the borrower, let us say, borrows $1,000, he is:
encouraged to purchase a life insurance contract which will
pay off the outstanding loan balance.

So it is decreasing tern

life Insurance in the event he should die, or in the event that

7
he should become disabled, the insurance is designed to
continue to pay the loan payments during the period of his
disability.
It is a single premium, as Mr, Justice Stewart
indicated, that is paid in advance.
In most states, finance companies are prohibited
to issue such credit life insurance.

So, prior to the Treaty

I type arrangements in these cases, the consumer finance
companies essentially acted as sales agents for independent
insurance companies.

Usually they received a commission, which

is a substantial commission, usually in the neighborhood of
about 50$.
The Treaty I type arrangements were organized by
the Consumer Finance Companies.

They organised these tax­

payer insurance companies as subsidiaries in order to command
a larger percentage of the profits from this credit insurance
business.
As the facts in Consumer Life Insurance indicate,
at first, these newly formed insurance companies, these subsidiaries — and in the case of Consumer Life it was the
Consumer Life Company — did not have sufficient capital to
act as a direct insurer under the state law, under the state
of the, you know, of the — of incorporation of the Consumer
Finance Company.
rather

So what it did was they acted as reinsurers

than direct insurers

s
Under Treaty X* the way the transaction worked was
as follows:

The Independent Insurance company issued the

policy to the borrower and collected the premiums in full just
as it had previously done before the taxpayer insurance company
was organized,
The taxpayer* by contract* by reinsurance contract*
which in the parlance of the industry is called a treaty*
agreed to reinsure the risk and agreed to reimburse the
independent insurer for all losses — and 31% quoting —
"actually paid on both life policies and health, and accident
policies ,
So* for purposes of this case* Consumer Life* that
Is* that's really one type ease* there really is no dispute
between the parties* although Consumer Life has argued to the
contrary.

But there really is no dispute that under the

Treaty I type arrangement these taxpayer subsidiary insurance
companies assume the entire insurance risk for this coverage,
because they* by contract* agree to reimburse the independent
insurer for all claims paid,
Penn Security doesn®t contend to the contrary and
Consumer Life* while they do dispute this assumption of risk*
the Court of Claims found that they freely conceded that they
assumed the risk below* and* as we point out in our brief*
I don't think there really is any question that they did so
concede and that they have assumed the risk by contract.

9
In exchange for the assumption of this risk under
the Treaty I reinsurance arrangement, the taxpayers, Consumer
Life and Penn Security, received substantial percentages of
the commissions,,much more substantial than they had, you know,
when they were just — when the taxpayers didn't exist and the
finance companies were dealing with independent insurance
companies.
In Consumer, the percentage was 90«.5$ of premiums
and In Penn Security, lb 'was 93$ of premiums.
Under the Treaty I arrangement, the independent
company, as I said, collected premiums in full*

It also paid

all claims under the policy, as any direct insurer would.
Each month, the independent company remitted to the
taxpayer insurance companies their full share of the life
insurance premiums that had been paid by the borrowers.

But

with respect to the accident and health insurance premiums,
the Independent company remitted these taxpayers only that
portion of the premiums that was ratably allocable to the ;
prior month's coverage.
So, for example, assume a $120 accident *and health
single premium that the borrower pays, That would mean,
essentially, that the independent company would hold that
$120 until the end of January and then on February 1st, or
shortly thereafter, would pay over $10 a month In February
which was allocable to January's coverage, and so forth„

10
In March, It would pay over another $10 which was allocable
to February's coverage,
QUESTION:

The way you describe it, the initial’, or

sometimes It is referred to as the direct insurer, it is
essentially like a general agent in the field who receives a
commission for initiating the business, whereas, the risk
taking is by the reinsurer,
MR, SMITH;

Essentially, that is our submission,

Mr, Chief Justice, that, for purposes of Treaty I, the
independent insurer is really nothing more than a commission
agent because when the smoke cleared it only held its 9§$ of
premiums.

Everything — you know, it paid the claims out of

this fund that was about to drop down, and essentially that
the taxpayers agreed by contract to assume the risk and
everything that was left over, less its commission, was paid
over back to these taxpayer insurance companies,
QUESTION:

Mr, Smith, you argued Foster Luraber here

a few weeks ago, didn't you? And you prevailed by a narrowly
divided vote over a strong dissent.

It struck me there that

the Government position was that we read the statute as written
and don't make any allowance for equities or substance, or
that sort of thing,
But here, it seems to me, the Government is talking
out of the other side of its mouth and saying, in effect, while
we can't read it quite the way its written, we've got to make

11

sure that substance rather than form prevails.
MR» SMITH:

I don't think so, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

The reason I don't think so is because I think /chat the
statutory term,* as I will develop at greater length in a few
minutes, the statutory term "unearned premiums" in Section 801
C(2) does not, as the Court of Claims held, and these tax- rs
•4,,:

payers submit, although I must say they submit it with
varying-degrees of differences among themselves.
We claim that the term "unearned premiums" refers
to .unearned premium reserves and not premium dollars and that
the literal words of the statute, we think, support our
submission here that the unearned premium reserves are
attributable to these taxpayer insurance companies which
were on the risk of this insurance.
I don't think that the positions in the two cases
are inconsistent.
QUESTION;

Would you have to take that position

in view of your position in Poster Lumber?
MR. SMITH;

Well, we try to be consistent,

Mr. Justice Blackmun.
QUESTION:

The Internal Revenue Service hasn't

prided itself on consistency in the past
(laughter)
\

QUESTION:
this Court.

—

and has conceded in briefs ,'and in

We are not being critical.

A case is a case.

12

MR. SMITH:

Surely, we would be consistent within

a single term of this Court.
(laughter)
QUESTION:

But you do consistently try to collect

taxes *
MR* SMITH:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.
To follow up what Justice Rehnquist

said, you. would read the words "unearned premium’1 in the
statute as saying unearned premium reserve.
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:

Is that right?

That is correct.
And you acknowledge the unearned premiums

are in a different place than the unearned premium reserve.
MR. SMITH:

The unearned premium dollars are in a

different place.
QUESTION:
MR0 SMITH:

But you say unearned premium —
I think, as we point out in our brief,

and I'll be happy to go into it at greater length during my
argument, I think that the words "unearned premiums" in the
statute necessarily refer to unearned premium reserves.
can't refer to dollars.

They

It just doesn't make any sense for

the qualification of life insurance to turn on where particular
dollars are located in an economy like ours where everything is
put in terms of intangible bank claims.

You know, claims on

time deposits, or whatever.
I mean the physical location of the money, I don't

13

think, makes any difference*
QUESTION:

-.1 think Congress omitted a word

it is perfectly clear it intended to include.
MR* SMITH:

The word was —

I think I saw — I think the structure,

as I will point out ~~
QUESTION:

Then you are, to a certain extent, asking

us to change the language of the statute*
MR* SMITH:

I am not asking you to change the

language of the statute*

I am asking you to be construe --

to be consistent with what I think is the appropriate «—
QUESTION:
MR* SMITH:

Equitable way.
I think it is the correct way.

I‘d like to turn now to a description of Treaty II
before I go into our argument.
Under Treaty II, the roles of the taxpayer
insurance companies and the Independent company —
QUESTION:

Let me just cover one other thing with

you before you get into Treaty II.
In response to the Chief Justice, you said that the
insurance company, the independent insurance company, is in the
nature of a general agent performing a bookkeeping function.
But isnct it correct that had they been merely a bookkeeper
the reinsurer couldnst have qualified for the insurance
coverage.

Weren't they
MR. SMITH:

■

They had the status of a direct insurer.

14

in that sense, yesc

I think for state purposes they were a

direct insurer* but I think that the substance of the arrange­
ment was simply that they weren't insuring anything,
QUESTION:

But did they not, by qualifying as an

insurance company, provide something to the transaction which
a general agent or a bookkeeper —
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:

I think that's right,
-- If that were not true, they would not

have been in the picture at all.
MR, SMITH: I think that's right.

But, essentially,

I would suggest that if the — to use the analogy I used a
few moments ago, had an insurance company taken unearned A&H,
accident and health premiums, and put them in a time deposit
in a bank and was not permitted to withdraw them except at
stated intervals, I don't think anybody would say that the
bank had the reserves on the insurance company.
I mean, essentially, I think that the function of
this insurance company, this direct insurer, under the Treaty
I arrangement, was little more than that.

The functions it

performed —»
QUESTION:

Mr, Smith, is that quite fair, because

isn't the purpose of the state law to be sure that a company
of a certain capital structure is able to assume the risks that
all the policy holders rely on when they take out their
insurance?

15
And Isn't it performing a function in the whole
risk-taking picture that is essential for a large company to
perform?
MR0 SMITH:

I suppose it was performing a function

under state law because# in this particular case# for example#
in Consumer Life# Georgia had minimum capitalization require­
ments .
'

i

QUESTION;

The purpose of those requirements is to

be sure there is a company there with sufficient substance to
assume these risks#
MR# SMITH:

That's right#

But I think it is comon

knowledge what happened in this case was that they shopped
around for the minimum capitalization state# which was Arizona.,
and they set up this reinsurer#
I think# as a practical matter# the reinsurercontracted to take# you know# to bear the risk and it did bear
the.risko

And there really wasn't any way that the direct

insurer was going to lose anything„

You know# it was going

to perform these functions which vjere —
QUESTION: In a way which would not have fatisfled
state law requirements without this other company in the
pictureo
MR* SMITH:

That's right#

Because the st te law

requirements of Georgia would insist that & company issuing
.insurance in Georgia have a# you know, a minimum capitalization*

%

16

And that was the direct insurer.
But we don't think that should make any difference
for purposes of qualification for tax purposes»
QUESTION:

The only purpose in my questioning was

to test the importance of your point that they are nothing
more than a bookkeeper.

They also perfoamied an essential

function as a matter of state law, the independent company did.
MR. SMITH:

I think that's right.

Now, to describe, briefly, what happened under the
Treaty II arrangement, the roles of the taxpayer and the
independent company were purportedly reversed.

So the tax-

payer becomes the direct insurer and the independent company,
under this contract, is characterised as a reinsurer.
In the Consumer Life case, 80$ of the accident and
health business was purportedly reinsured with the independent
company and in First Railroad it was 60$ and then 70$.
Well, what kind of reinsurance really was this
arrangement?

The way it worked was the taxpayer paid these

quarterly accident and health premiums to the independent
insurer, keeping back a tentative commission of 50$.
The independent company then paid a quarterly
rebate,' or called it an experienced refund, and that rebate
is equal to the premiums,less the 5Q$ tentative commission,
which had already been received, less a 3 or 4$ commission
— well, 3$ in Consumer Life —- and then less all claims paid.

17

And if the sued of these three things exceeded the losses
under the insurance — losses for the payment of insurance
claims

then those losses would be carried forward and the

independent company would be able to charge it against the
next quarter*s experienced refund.
Now, in point of fact, in the Consumer case, the
loss experienced was something like 18$ of premiums paid, so
there really was no way that the independent company was going
to get more than its 3$ commission or get less than its 3$
commission.
In fact, in the Consumer Life case, the trial judge
found, in the Court of Claims, that the likelihood that the
loss experience would run so high that the 3$ commission xnould
be jeopardized was so remote as to be neglible, and that the
parties knew this to be the fact.
QUESTION:

Let me just interject here because I want

to be sure you cover it.
What is.

Your conception of the independent company in

Treaty I situation is kind of a bookkeeping function.
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
In Treaty II, what is your conception of

the contribution to the total arrangement which the independent
company made?
MR, SMITH;
QUESTION:

It is also a bookkeeping function.
Well, why did they need them at all, if

18
you are correct?
MR» SMITH:

Why did they need them at all?

They needed them because — What happened was after
Consumer Life reached the maximum capitalisation, it needed
them because it could earn more profit, essentially»
QUESTION:

Then if there were no reinsurance

arrangement at all, why wouldn't they .just completely cancel
the reinsurance arrangement?

If there really is no risk if

they have to reinsure again»

Why wouldn't they make more

money by just taking them out of the picture completely»
MR» SMITH:

QUESTION:

I presume they could have done that', but

You must have a theory as to why they

didn't»
MR* SMITH:

The theory has to be, essentially, that

they did this in order to qualify as a life insurance company»
\

Because if they issued this A&H insurance directly then there
would be no question — nobody would be here arguing »- that
the reserves t^ere not attributable to these taxpayers*

And

they would flunk the 50$ test*
So they needed them, essentially, to say, "Well,
look, we've put our ASH reserves somewhere else and we don't
have them any more, so, therefore, we are a life insurance
company."
QUESTION:

That would explain why they would reinsure

19

the A&H, but why would they reinsure the life?
MR, SMITH;
QUESTION;
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION;
MR, SMITH:

They didn't.
They did not reinsure the life at all?
No.
The whole purpose of it Is to qualify —
Right,

In fact* what happened was, you

know, in the Treaty I arrangement, they paid the life insurance
premiums to the taxpayers right away.

There was no delayed

timing of that payment, because for their purposes they
wanted to increase their life insurance reserves to qualify
under the fraction.
QUESTION:

One legitimate purpose of any business is

the avoidance of taxes, Isn’t it?
MR, SMITH:

Absolutely, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I

would not quarrel with that proposition, but I think that a
transaction has to have some independent substance.

And here,

where you have a situation where these premiums are just being
held back and paid on a monthly dribble — I mean, that’s
really the only way to describe it -- I think that it sort of
blinks at reality to say that this A&H business was not the
taxpayers' business, Because they ran the risk, they got all
the profits from it.

There was no way that the other company

could lose and the other company was not really insuring
anything.

I mean, it was performing

a

function, but It was

20

performing a function in the one case to qualify under state,
you know, to qualify these transactions for state purposes.
In the other case, it was .-si',.ply a bald-face attempt
to qualify as a life insurance company under the statutory
fractional formula ,
In respect to the Treaty II arrangement, the Fifth
Circuit correctly held, in our view, that there was no
substance to this agreement as reinsurance and it was,
essentially, the other company was simply earning a commission
and doing a small set .of tasks, receiving the payment, paying
out the claim and getting no more than 3$ and getting no less
than
We agree that we don't think that's insurance,,
Wow, the proposition that we urge in these cases
is a very simple one.
It Is that for purposes of the Section 801(a)
reserve ratio test, insurance reserves must follow the
insurance risk, since, as I think is abundantly clear from,
the description of the facts, the taxpayers bore this
accident and health Insurance risk under both the Treaty I
and Treaty II type arrangements, the accident and health
insurance reserves are includable in their total reserve,
that is the denominator of the statutory fraction, and they
do not qualify as a life insurance company.
Now, we think, the proposition that reserves must

21
follow the risk can be demonstrated in three different ways.
Firsts we think the rule comports with the funda­
mental characteristics of insurance and the essential nature
of what an insurance reserve is»
Seconds we think that the language of the reserve
ratio test of Section 801(a) and (c) supports our submissiori
that reserves follow the risk»
And finally* we submit that the legislative history
of the reserve ratio test, which dates back to 1921, supports
our submission that the insurance reserves must follow the
insurance risk»
With respect to the first point* I think it is
fairly undisputed and this Court so recognized it about forty
years ago in the LaGerc e ease* that the essense of insurance
is risk shifting* and the essential characteristic of re­
insurance is the transfer of risk from one company to another.
QUESTION:

What would be your vie*** Mr. Smith* on a

contract of risk-sharing* where* hypothetically half of the
risk was reinsured?
MR9 SMITH:

Well*, then* I suppose half the reserves

would be allocable to one and half to the other.
i

But in this

case* the risk 'was borne completely* Mr. Chief Justice, by
the taxpayers*
QUESTION:

But then the initial insurer* concerning

which I inquired before* would be something more than a general

22

agent, wouldn't he?
ME, SMITH:

That's correct.

To the extent that they

bear the risk, reserves corresponding to that risk ought to
be Included in their total reserve,
When they don't bear any risk at all, as we submit
these independent companies did, in these two different kinds
of arrangements, I don't think that they ought to have those
reserves chargeable to its —- to their total reserves»
QUESTION:
would pay the claim?
MR, SMITH:

Did you say that the reinsuring company
I think you did, under type II,
Under Type XI, the way it seems to have

worked, although the record is not entirely clear, the
independent company paid the claim,
QUESTION:

By independent, you mean the company that

issued the policy?
MR, SMITH:

Yes,

In the Treaty II arrangement,

the independent company Is the purported reinsurer, although
we would say it's not really a reinsurer at all.
But the company that was called the reinsurer under
the Treaty II type arrangement, that is, the non-taxpayer
would pay the claims.

Essentially, what would happen Is,

you know, the taxpayer would issue the policy and ~«
QUESTION:

The taxpayer Is the company that qualifies

as an insurance company.,
MR* SMITH:

Right.

These taxpayers, here, whose

23

qualification is at issue.

They would issue the insurance

policy and then pay out the premiums on a quarterly basis,
but take back a tentative 5o$ commission.

And then the

independent company would pay out all the claims out of the
r ema ind er.
QUESTION;

You put me off a bit when you say

independent,
Could we speak in terms of the Insurer and the
reinsurer?
MR. SMITH:

We could, Mr. Justice Powell, but my

only hesitance to adopt that nomenclature is that we don"t
think that the Treaty II arrangement was reinsurance.
QUESTION:

Well, your not going to influence

QUESTION:

Taxpayer.

MR. SMITH:

Okay.

Yes, the taxpayer and the other

company.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

What is the other company, the reinsurer?
The other company is called the reinsure-r.
We are not going to decide the case on the

basis of your nomenclature.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

Okay.

The reinsurer paid out

the cla xms,
QUESTION:

The reinsurer pays out the claim.

And

how is it reimbursed by the insurance company?
MR. SMITH:

It is reimbursed out of, essentially, it

24

is reimbursed out of the claim ■— out of the — It reimburses
itself»

How is It reimbursed?

It is reimbursed ~~ it pays

these claims out of the premium dollars it has and then it
pays back to the taxpayer what*s left over»

And if there should

ever be any excess of losses over money left over which is,
in these cases,, almost impossible,and the parties apparently
knew this to be the fact so the trial court in the Court of
Claims found, then the taxpayer would pay it back out of the
next quarter's premium dollars.
QUESTION:

So, in that situation, the reimbursement

would be delayed?
MR, SMITH:

Yes*

But, essentially, you know, there

was no way that the independent company or, quote, "reinsurer,"
quote, could lose under the arrangement»

It wasn't going to

get more than 3% and it wasn't going to get less than 3$.
QUESTION:

In the event of that delay, would interest

be paid?
MRo SMITH:

I don't know, but I would suggest that

that simply — that could be arranged between the parties in
a way that — it's just another bargaining point»
QUESTION:

You regard, the whole thing as a sham, as

your brief states»
MR„ SMITH:

I think that's right»

I mean it is not

reinsurance»
QUESTION:

Right»

But is it also a sham where there

25

Is no parent subsidiary relationship and this is a contract
of reinsurance negotiated at arm's length?
MR» EMITH:

When I use the word "sham,H one tends to

think* you know* that there is no substance and that there is
sort of a tax avoidance motive* which I think is the case
here* but I don't think it would matter whether it was
negotiated at arm's length because we examine the figures
and when you strip away all the technicality — you know*
all the contract provisions

I think* for tax purposes*

this was not ~~ reinsurance.
QUESTION:

May I ask this question?

If it is a sham* what would be the business reason
for an independent reinsurer to enter into a sham arrangement*
just to be nice?
MRo SMITH:

Earn a 3$ commission, for doing a

relatively small amount of work.
When we say sham* I don't want to — I don't think
that you have to go that far and knock out the agreement as
some sort of sham.

I think that* essentially* when we are

talking about reinsurance* at page •=- the Examiner's Handbook
which was introduced in evidence in the First Railroad case —
at page 211 of that Appendix it defines reinsurance.

It says*

"The essential element of every true reinsurance contract is
the undertaking by the reinsurer to indemnify the seeding
insurer* not only in form but in feet* against loss or liability

26

by reason of the original insurance.

Unless the so-called

reinsurance contract contains this essential element* no credit
whatsoever shall be allowed*’1 etcetera* etcetera*
You know the insurance industry wouldn’t recognize
this as reinsurance and we don't think it is reinsurance.
Insurance is taking on a risk.
a risk,

Reinsurance is transferring of

There was no risk transferred in the Treaty II type

arrangement.
QUESTION:

But the state agencies do recognize it

as reinsurance.
MRc SMITH:

The state agency recognized it* but we

don't think that really matters for purposes of Section 801(c)
(2)* as I think we pointed out in our reply brief.

The regu­

lations there say whatever is regarded ~~ whatever might be
the case under local law.

But the point of the matter is that

the state agencies really approached this thing from an
entirely different point of view.
’Whether you believe they were smart people or not
smart people* their essential purpose was to make sure that
some company was solvent and that the policy holder was not
going to lose.

They weren't interested in —

QUESTION:

On that very point* Mr. Smith* supposing

in the Treaty II situation* the taxpayer became insolvent.
That's* I suppose* theoretically possible* although* as you
say* in the fact of the matter* it is unlikely to happen.

27

In that event* the risk would fall squarely on the
reinsurer* would it not?
MR* SMITH:

That Is correct»

And that is the only

case —»
QUESTION;

Isn't there a second case?

Supposing

you had a very serious epidemic and an unpredictable number
of claims accrued that were far above what anybody anticipated.
Is it not possible that the reinsurer would assume that risk?
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:

That is also correct.
So there are two risks that the reinsurer1

assumes that are both very unlikely but yet are risks —
MR, SMITH:

I think that the ease has to be

examined in terms of what is likely.

We are talking about

claims of 18% or 22$.
QUESTION:

So we look at the likelihood and proba­

bility rather than the literal language of the contracts and
statute.
MR, SMITH:

Yes,

I think that is right.

I want to talk a little bit about what a reserve is*
simply because I think that's critical to what this case is
all about.

An insurance reserve Is not* as I think the Court

of Claims held*and as one of the taxpayers here argues and
the other taxpayers argue in sort of slight variation — it is
not anything one keeps in one's pocket.

It is not an asset.

It is simply a projected liability for* you know* a kind of

28

unaccrued liability, for an event that might occur in the
future and which an insurance company, basically, has to bear
in mind 0
QUESTION:

Is the reserve

A reserve is a liability.

Does the balance sheet require that there be an offsetting
asset for that liability?
MR, SMITH:

I don't think so.

The way to look at this case is to say if an insur­
ance company assumes a risk and has to know the reserve for
this — Let us say, it buys stock at $100 and the stock goes
down to zero, and it has made a bad investment.
say that its reserves are depleted.
$100,

Nobody would

It still has a reserve of

It just will have to use other assets to cover that

reserve, but it still has a reserve.
The reserve is keyed to the liability, to the risk
an insurance company assumes under a policy.

There really is

no matching principle, as such, when we talk about that the
premium dollars have to follow the reserve.

Essentially, what

are talking about is when the liability is assumed to the
policyholder, that triggers the creation of the reserve.
And the fact that these premium dollars happen to
oe in another pocket, so to speak, you know, for a delayed
reaction of about a month or so, shouldn't make a difference
iii this case, because it is not really physical location of
an asset, because a reserve is not anything physical that you

29

can sort of grab onto it*

An insurance company doesn't

segregate assets and say, "These are our reserve funds."
There is no such thing as a reserve fund, as such.

The re­

serve is the projected liability.
QUESTION:

In the case of health and accident

insurance, do you also have a reserve, the unearned premium,
as distinguished from the reserve

representing the risk on the

claim?
MR, SMITH:

Mr. Justice Powell, in health and

accident insurance, there is no accepted table, the way there
is in life insurance, to measure the risk.
As a result, the insurance parlance is to the
effect that the unearned premiums equal the reserve,
mathematically.
QUESTION:

Is that the way itfs recorded on the

b ooks ?
MR, SMITH:
the books.

That's the way it would be recorded on

But that doesn't mean, as I think we point out in

our brief in greater detail, that the unearned premium dollars
are the reserve.

The reserve represents this projected

liability to the policyholders.
QUESTION:

To take your $120 example, you start

out putting $120, if you. had the entire right to the premium,
on the reserve side of your balance sheet as a liability.
Would you?

30

MR. SMITH:

It is not really a balance sheet asset
l

like a liability, but it would go in summary of operations, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, a reserve is on the liability side

of the balance sheet.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes,. that5 s right.
And, at the end of the first month,

that reserve would be reduced by one-twelfth,
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Thatfe right.
Now, that would be taken into ineome at

that point, the one-twelfth of the premium,
MR. SMITH:
I suppose.

Well, it would be sort of unrestricted,

You know, in that sense.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION;

But it would be income
Yes,
— on which the taxpayes? would pay a tax.

Do you put anything on the asset side of the balance sheet to
reflect the fact that you have earned one-twelfth of the
premium?
MR,, SMITH:
always existed.

I don't think so„

The assets have

It's just one insurance company and doesn't

have any more assets.
QUESTION:

Do you put a claim —

MR. SMITH:

It has essentially reduced your

QUESTION:

What do you put on the asset side of the

liability,

31

balance sheet at the beginning* $120?
MR, SMITH:

At the beginning* I suppose it would be

—*■ it would be put in as an asset of premiums received* I
suppose,

And then —
QUESTION:
MRo SMITH:

Before it is collected?
I see your point.

Well, I think, as we

point out in our brief, standard general accounting
treatment for this kind of transaction is that it is an asset.
It’s, you know, the texts refer to it as funds held by seeding
insurer or reinsurer, so to speak.

So it is an asset,

I

don't really think there has to be this matching,
QUESTION:

Carry on, Mr, Smith,

to visualize the balance sheet transactions

I was just trying
indicated by

what you are talking about, but I don't know that that is
necessarily ~~
MR» SMITH:

Yes,

I think our essential point here

is that the — and I want to save the remaining time for
rebuttal -- is that the unearned premiums referred to in the
statute does not refer to the physical dollars, but refers to
the reserve.

And the reserve has to be attributable to the

company that assumes the risk because the reserve represents
this projected liability.
Since I think it is plain and it really can't be
seriously disputed that these companies — these taxpayercompanies ***» were all on the risk, I think that it is their

32

business and I think that their insurance business necessarily
has to be put in the denominator o:f total reserves»
QUESTION:
the statute;

What you ask us is to make two changes in

One we add the word ’’reserve” to the word

’'premium," and then we attribute the reserve to the insurer»
MR, SMITH:

I don't think those are changes in the

statute, Mr, Justice —
QUESTION:

Well, additions to the language that

Congress —MR, SMITH:

I think when you look at the structure

of the statute, it talks about, you know, there are three
kinds of reserves: one, life insurance reserves, two, unearned
premiums and unpaid losses not included in life insurance
reserves, and three, all other insurance reserves required
by law.
The first thing you notice is that one and three
are plainly reserves.

Unpaid losses, not included in life

insurance reserves, also strike one as a reserve and, in fact
it is a reserve,

Unearned premiums, the insurance texts all

refer to it as a reserve,
for a reserve,

I mean, it is a shorthand expression
. • ■

I think that the calculation of accident and health
insurance, casualty insurance, is put in terms of unearned
premiums, and it's either unearned premiums or unearned premiums
are reserves

33
1 don't think that., you know, Congress had to add
that word ‘’reserve»”

I think they were writing a statute for

a very sophisticated industry that knew what it wanted and
wanted to measure this, you know, make this qualification on
the basis of reserves»

I don't think these companies make

it because they bore this risk under this casualty insurance.
That's not life insurance and they flunked the 50$ test.
QUESTIONi

Mr* Smith, I do want to ask one other

question because, under your theory, the unearned premium
reserves on the accident and health business remains with the
taxpayer because it ultimately takes the risk, as you analyze
it, whereas, the unearned premium dollars would be with the re­
insurer, in the Treaty II situation.
Would you say that there is an unearned premium
reserve matching the unearned premium dollars in the reinsurer
as well as in the taxpayer?

In other words, is the reserve in

two places at once?
MR. SMITH:

It possibly could be.

For state-county

purposes —
QUESTION:

No, no.

For Federal tax purposes,

assuming that the reinsurer was also a company —
MR. SMITH:

No.

The Internal Revenue would never

put a reserve in both places.

It would either, be in one or

the other and we say it is with the taxpayer.
QUESTION:

Even if It was the difference between

34

qualifying as a life company for the reinsurer?
MR, SMITH:

I think: that we ~~ You know, our rule

that the reserves follow the risk •»- We would, obviously, you
know, possibly, lose some cases under this rule.

We would not

inconsistently put reserves in a place where the risk was just
to disqualify a company.
QUESTION:

But the fact that you say the risk is in

the taxpayer does not necessarily negate the possibility that
it is also in the reinsurer.
MR. SMITH:

There may be slight risk, as you pointed

out, with insolvency, and so forth and so on, but that's a
negligible risk and we don't require attribution of the
reserve.
QUESTION:

What if the risk were just a little more

probable in the other company? There is a legal risk.under
the terms of the contract and they also have the premium
dollars.

Would that ever require them to be considered also

have —>
MR. SMITH;

That could be sort of, you know, there

is a type of reinsurance known as excess loss reinsurance
which probably could be calculated.

There might be a small

fraction of a reserve left for the other side, you know,
with the independent companies, for tax purposes.
But I think when we are talking about what happened
in the Treaty II case, the risk was neglig5.bXe and I think the

35

reserve belongs fco the company that realistically bore the
risk, here the taxpayers, and they have to include that in
their total reserve„
QUESTION;

So the issue really turns on a kind of

finding of fact as to which company, realistically, takes the
greater share of the risk
MR. SMITH:

And we think in both cases —

QUESTION: — rather than the terns of the contracto
MRo SMITH:

And we think In both cases, First

Railroad and Consumer, the findings of fact, you know, even
the District Court in First Railroad which held against the
Government, acknowledged that it was almost remote and
negligible that the other company bore any risk.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. JONES, JR., ESQ.
FOR THE RESPONDENT
MR, JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I am counsel for Penn Security in No. 1285«
Just fco remind the Court, our ease presents solely
a Treaty I situation, because I think must of what Mr. Smith
has just said has no bearing on a Treaty I situation.
I will be followed by Mr. Harper for the First
Railroad.
«

He will be representing a taxpayer with a Treaty II

36

situation,

Mr, Masinter will conclude and his case includes

both the Treaty I and the Treaty II issues <>
I am sure the Court is aware, from its questions,
what the statutory test says and that Penn Security meets the
statutory test in terms of reserves which it has on its books
and which it reports to state authorities and which they have
approved 9
I think it is also -- I've heard nothing suggested
by the Government that there is any way you can read the
Code or the regulation which would suggest to you that some
other reserves may be attributed.
Rather, as 1 see,the reserves follow the risk test
which lias been expounded here this morning, it is sort of a
touchstone. which is offered by the Government to better
carry out the statutory purpose.

And the argument is really

whether that new touchstone test can be reconciled with the
statute and the regulations»
QUESTION:

In your situation, Penn Security, is

there any privity between the insured person, policyholder
and the beneficiary, on the one hand, and the reinsurer?
MR* JONES: No,
QUESTION:

The privity is between the initial

insurer and the insured and stops there»
MR0 JONES:

That is correct*

Of course, the initial insurer is also not related

37
to the reinsurer# in our case *
at all.

Mo relationship between them

It is an outside company.
We feel that applying this test to Penn Security

shows that it is a very unwise grasp on the statute,

Penn

Security which meets the statutory reserve test# actually
reinsures more life risks than accident and health risks.
That arises because they never sell accident and health
without life.

They sometimes sell life without accident and

health.
In terms of what it cdst them to carry the insurance#
we have findings in our ease that it requires the company#
in order to meet the claims under the policies# it will cost
them more to meet their life claims than to meet their
aceident and health claims,
Penn Security has no interest in the reserve funds
which are held by this Independent outside insurer,

There is

no x*iay in the world that you can use the word "shifting" in
talking about the reserves applied to this Treaty I situation.
Those funds come in from the policyholders to the direct
Insurer and the question is on accident and health insurance
when they come over to the direct insurance company.
In fact# the eccentricities of the Government rule
are shown here by the fact that we do qualify for 19^5#
no matter what this Court says here.
Indeed# we have some arguments which are in our

38
brief, that maybe Is 11 get to, which show why, even if they
attribute here, wecd still qualify as a life insurance
company»
And we don't think that fifteen years after the
event this kind of game should be played with somebody who
is in clear coaiplianee with the statute»
Perhaps, if this had been adopted as a regulation
at an earlier date, a case could be made for it»
Now, the Government does not, despite the use of
the word "sham” earlier, does not have any element of sham
in our reinsurance agreement»

This is an outside company

which reinsures and, indeed, if they sham, we are not in the
case and we don't get the income»

It is only the reinsurance

which gets it in the income.
The Government makes much of the point that under
this reinsurance agreement all of the risk shifts to Penn
Security,

But that, I suppose, is always true —< Excuse me,

that is not always true, but the normal pattern of reinsurance,
an insurance company would like to get rid of all risk under
a policy.

It is quite natural,that if it reinsures, it will

be taken off the policies entirely»

It does not want to have

the residual risk of the catastrophe which was mentioned here
earlier.
Reinsurance has been around a long tiliae»

These

arguments the Government now proposes would throw a great

39
monkey wrench into the reinsurance business* if every time
you reinsured 100$, you had to talk about shifting the
reserves*
We submit and we think one of the key elements that
tells the Government that it's really trying to make new law
here is this Revenue Ruling 7508*

That's a life insurance

case and it isn't directly involved here# but you will see
there that where the direct insurer actually paid over the
income on the retaining funds to the reinsurer — so it is
e stronger case,

It is sort of like Economy Finance — Where

it did that5 they still did not require attribution of the
reserves there* And, as we pointed out in our brief, . there is
a regulation which would have given them license.to*
We think this is an ad hoc argument to try* as a
last gaff, to get at these credit life insurance companies*
The terms of the reinsurance treaties

at least

In this Treaty I situation — are an arm's length deal
between the reinsuring company and the direct insurer.

The

direct insurer has to make terms that will let him‘keep in
the business by paying the right amount to the reinsurer*
he gets too greedys then they will go somewhere else*

If

So

there Is free bargaining*
I don't believe there can be suggested any reason
why, once you go into this reinsurance business,you should not
be allowed to cast it in terns which qualify you for the

40

taxation which Congress has specified for life insurance
companies,
As Mr, Smith stated earlier,* it is not argued here
that somehow Credit Life doesn ®t fit within the 1959 statute
and that Is settled by the Alineo case and by the Superior Life
case in the lower court.
Some focus is made* and rightly so, on the manner m
which the premiums of accident and health are paid.

They are

done on an as-earned basis, while life is done on a — paid
over directly.
This is a term reached by the party.
effects.

It has several

One which will be discussed more by my following

counsel is what that does on the ability of the insuring
company to sell more insurance.
It is important to them to have their reserves
adjusted, as has always been the ease, on the handling of
reinsurance.
There is a tax impact and that Is what brings us
here.

But between the parties, this is perhaps the most

important term of the deal.

If you look at the accident and

health insurance, and you can work this out on paper and
pencil, if you have A&H policies that last three years, and
you get yrur premium in advance from the Insured and you keep
that money and you only have to pay it out — one-thirty-sixth
for each month — you will find that the calculation builds up

41

a fund one and one-half times the annual premium rate.
That one and one-half times the annual premium rate
belongs to the direct Insurer and he can invest that* and if
his rate of investment is* say* 5$, you will see that 5$ on
one and one-half times the annual rate is a great deal more
than 2$ commission which appears on the face of the contract.
So* I submit to the Court that this provision for
retaining the reserves on accident and health is one of the
most important provisions between the parties.

It has

tremendous economic substance and could certainly not be
disregarded under any standards that vie have seen In the
past.
Our position is that this reserve follows the risk
has no authority under the statute.

It is to be contrasted

with Section 482 which does give the Commissioner license to
do that.

We think it runs to the extent the Code speaks at

all on the subject of attribution of reserves.
other way in Section 820.

It goes the

It is not involved here., but it

seems a little odd that if the rule were, as the Government
claims here, that the reserves follow the risk, that Section
820 would be written just the way it is.
We find that the Government{s attempt here runs
afoul of four regulations requirements.

One, that the premium

— in order to create an unearned premium reserve* the premiums
must be paid in advance.

That's one of the requirements.

The

42

second is that it must toe actually held.
there are two aspects to it
state law.

The third has to do

with being required toy

And finally, whether if youdo go to an attribution

of this, you really want to use the gross A Mi premium.
Now, in terms of paid in advance, we don't have any
dispute that that language in the regulations applies.
The Government suggests in its reply brief that
this is satisfied as to Penn Security toy the fact that the
insured paid their premiums in advance to the direct insurer.
Well, I think that is an extraordinary stretching of
language.
Those premiums which were paid in advance had no
relation to any liability of Penn Security.
Its liability to the direct insurer arose only when
the premiums were paid monthly by the direct insurer to Penn
Security.

If the direct insurer did not pay those amounts,

there would be no liability in Penn Security.
And if you are looking in terms of the regulations,
the insurance risk which is referred to in the regulation,
about paid in advance, very clearly refers to the reinsurance
risk which is assumed by Penn Security, not the risk which
the direct insurer assumed.
Now, we come to the language which says that the
reserves must be actually held, and that is discussed quite a
bit in the brief

43

The Government says reserves are sometimes described,
in colloquial manner, as funds set aside, but that's not the
appropriate interpretation, and we've heard that this morning,
that they should be treated as liabilities»
Vie agree that if you look through the- insurance
texts around the country, you can find some terms which speak
this way, but we think that the very use of the words "actually
held" in the regulations meant that the — in drafting the
terms of the regulations, it was not suggested that anything
other than funds actually held would be involved*
In other words, they adopted what has been described
as a colloquial description and insisted on it.
If additional authority is needed, we would suggest
that the Court look at Revenue Ruling 67180, which makes it
very clear that the IRS has continued to apply under the 1959
Act all those early cases which talked about funding and
reserve, Maryland Casualty being one of the leading cases.
»

I would also point out the Atlas Life case which
was mentioned here earlier this morning.

Atlas Life makes it

very clear that they are talking about a funding of a reserve.
And, indeed, if you don't fund a reserve, you are
going to get in a very difficult situation where you create
a liability that will be a very distorted picture of the
company's position unless some assets are brought in.
Let's just go back to the statutory language.

Even

44

if we concede that somehow you can hold a liability, as opposed
to holding an asset, within the meaning of the regulation,
what about the xsord, "actually/5

If the word, "actually,means

anything, it must mean that the company actually holds it,
not that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue can corae along
ten years later and create a liability that you didn't have *
We would think that the word,"actually," even if he
is right about what it means, reserves or funded or not, the
word, "actually," alone is enough to keep the Government from
proceeding on this ease*
There are two aspects to being required by state
law.

One of them arises under 801(c)(2) where the Government

correctly points out you can read the statute and regulations
as not requiring Government approval under (c)(2).
But we don't really conclude as the Government does
that here, alone, among all the rules of insurance taxation
in this very complicated section of the Code, in this one
place, Congress intended the Commissioner of the Internal
Revenue to have a free hand to go around and make rules which
improve on what the state authorities have done and give him
a chance to make a better tax law than what would come from
following the state regulations.

That is just too contrary
f

to the rest of the Code,
We would submit to the Court that a better reading is
to say that the difference in language about state requirements

45
is to accommodate the decision in' Mationa'X irotective Xnsuranc.<g
Ccmpam which is cited in the briefs* There the taxpayer held
a brief which was at least arguably not required by state
authority and that case held that it should be included in the
reserve*

We can see removing the requirement that it be

required by state law* in order to say if* in fact* you have
a reserve* you are going to have to include it in the computa­
tion* whether or not it is required by state law.
But it is a far cry to go from that to say that
•\

this particular language choice gives the Commissioner^ power to
do his own creating of reserves.
As is apparent from our briefs and discussion* there
is a difference between gross and net premiums a

Accident and

health insurance is judged on the basis of — traditionally in
the industry on gross premiums * and that includes the morbidity
risk which* I would beg to differ

with Government counsel* is

just as well established as mortality risk* plus expenses*
plus profit*
In the type of insurance we are talking about here*
the risk of carrying the insurance is only one-third*

And if

you.are going to attribute the risk* if that's what the
Government is really after* then I think you should depart
from the statutory adoption of the industry practice and only
attribute that part of the risk which corresponds to the
mortality risk in life insurance* because then* as we have

46

demonstrated here, it would be seen by this company as a life
insurance company by that method, as well.
The point is that if you depart from the statute,
./

,

then it seems to me you are not bound by the fact that states,
for many purposes, require using gross premium,

One particular

reason that would apply here is that the direct insurer has
the obligation to refund the premiums in the event the
insurance is canceled.

That is one of the reasons for main»*

taining the gross reserve.
Here, in our case, Penn Security is not

Once that

policy is canceled, Penn Security never sees it and the
refund comes from the direct insurer.

So there would be a

very strong reason, if you. are really looking for improving or
the statutory test, to use net premiums in this situation.
Just let me conclude and remind the Court just how
predominantly this company is an insurance company, because of
the fact that it meets the 50$ test, it sold more life insur­
ance than accident and health, had more life risks than
accident and health risks and those reserves which are being
attributed to it are clearly held by the direct insurer as an
important part of the arrangement which was made.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R, HARPER. ESQ.
FOR THE PETITIONER
MR0 HARPER:

M?0 Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Government is correct in pointing out that the
Government provided a mathematical test, a ratio^, but I
believe it is subject to criticism for not pointing out to you
that the Congress has also passed a statutory framework for
the analysis of these, problems,,
Not only has the Congress enacted lav;, but the
Treasury, itself, has explained many of the terns„
Without proceeding to the more orderly part of my
discussion, I would like to point out that It is quite painful
to me that the Government would come in and tell you that the
statute said unearned premiums and- meant reserves, because I
point out to you, in Section 801(3)(e), the Treasury, itself,
defines unearned premiums.

Unearned premiums are those

amounts which will cover the cost of carrying the insurance
risk.
Now, if it is, in fact, a liability, I don't see how
it is going to cover the Insurance risk.
I think they have avoided their own regulations and
tried to ignore them.
I will point out many other differences, but before
1 do, I would like to discuss, for a moment, risks „

43

It was pointed out by Mr. Justice Stevens chat
there are two risks.

I'd like to point out a third.

There, is

a distinct third risk and that is in having too small an
insurance base to adequately determine premiums.
For example, in our case., here., there was evidence
that a number of the agents had loss experiences that were
above the 96%,

1 point out to you that one of the risks is that
you do not have a broad enough base, to have a determinable
premium.
Let's talk for a moment about premiums?and may I
distinguish, because it must be done —» May I distinguish the
risks of life insurance and the risks of accident and health?
It has, over the many years, been clear that the
life of a group of people was predictable, the mortality tables
would so advise you —> not as to one individual man -— but
that death is a predictable thing.
The amount of a reserve for life insurance becomes
an obligation because each day that inevitable death approaches,
the risk then is greater as time passes and man gets older.
It is entirely the opposite for accident and health.,
Every month you get by, I think, we are all happy, "Well, we
made another month and we are not sick.

I'm glad I'm not like

old George."
Every month that's true of the accident and health

49
insurance business.

This is a risk not predictable upon the

basis of actuarial certainty* a risk which is so indeterminanfc
that the law requires that the entire unearned premium be set
aside at the moment of sale.
When you sell life 5.nsurance# you can look at the
premium yousve got, look at the mortality table, and you have
earned some income at that moment.
In the case of accident and health, not so,
QUESTION:

Mr, Harper, is it critical to your

position that there be a difference in the predictability of
the morbidity risk as opposed to the mortality risk?
MR, HARPER:

No, 1 think not, only insofar as the

reasons which would justify the undertaking.
QUESTION:

For example —

Is the bate charged for the life

insurance in this credit business different, depending on
age of the borrower?

I thought it x>:as all term insurance,

MR, HARPER:
QUESTION:

It is all term insurance,
And the rates vary with the age of the

borrower?
MR, HARPER:

QUESTION:

It does not vary with the age.

However

Well, how does your argument about

mortality, and all, play in because, as far as we are concerned

MR, HARPER;

Well, it plays in here, very definitely,

50

because you cannot take any portion of this accident and
health risk insurance into income»

It is reserved and set

aside,
*

You earn money when you sell life insurance.

There

is no money earned when accident and health insurance is sold,
QUESTI®:

As each month passes* it earns* doesn't

it?
MR, HARPER:
QUESTION:

It is earned in a pro rata amount,
Pro rata amount* yes.

Aren't the morbidity tables just about as reliable
as the mortality tables?
MR, HARPER:

I think these are different names for

the same — as I understood it —
This is just the reciprocal —* It does not predict
the risk of going to the hospital, for example, or being
disabled»
I must point out another reason actually held -- I
think it was actually covered in the preceding statement —
But let me point out that the problem of state authority is
to be sure that there are funds there to pay the insured when
he is entitled to indemnification,
YJe then find that-there is a clear requirement first
that the amount be actually held.

That means that there must

be a funded reserve.
There are two types of reserves.

There are those

51

reserves that a bond holder might Insist upon, merely ear­
marking a portion of surplus„

But if that bond holder

wants

to toe certain that bonds are going to be paid at the appointed
time, he requires that funds toe allocated.
We know the terra "sinking fund."
they wanted here.

‘
I say that's what

When the state authorities set out the

requirement of actually held, they did mean that it was a
funded reserve.

We submit that premiums were the fund.

In the regulations, which they have ignored completely,
there is the very Interesting requirement of Section 1805(b).
Reserve required toy law means those reserves which are reported
on the annual statement.
state authorities.

This annual statement goes to the

They don't just want a funded reserve.

They want it reported to the state as to what the reserite is.
There are some differences here between the parties,
tout I would like to point out that, at the time these people
in Georgia undertook to go into accident and health insurance,
they went into it because of a clamor of their agents to have
a single policy, a single insurance company that would cover
it.
They also undertook it with what we describe- as
minimum capital.

But let me point out to you that minimum

capital, under our statute, was $400,000.

By the time they

undertook the accident and health insurance business, the
insurance reserves, or what we know as the surplus funds, were

52

well over $400,000»

And by this agreement, we brought into

play and into risk reserves that were well over $400,000 in
the reinsuring company.
QUESTION:

It was real»

It was real in that —

Let me just interrupt because there is

something running through my mind I am not sure I understand.
You have a Treaty II situation, Is that correct?
Your client is the direct insurer and you reinsure the A&H
business tout not the life business.
ME. HARPER:
QUESTION:

Is that correct?

Our company originally acted as a —
Is that correct?

MR„ HARPER:

— reinsurance business for life

insurance.
QUESTION:

With respect to the years in issue, Is it

correct that you reinsure the accident and health business and
not the life business?
MR.HARPER:

I think that's correct.

I would not be

e erfcain.
QUESTION:

Is there a business reason for that,

other than favorable tax consequences?
MR„ HARPER:
need a broader base.

There is a business reason in that we
Although we had over $400,000 in reserves,

the authorities who testified and the college professor who
testified recognized that the ability to take on new business
was limited to those x?ho had policy premiums —
QUESTION:

low what was It that broadened your base?

53
The reinsurance of the A&H business.

Did that broaden your

base?
MR* HARPERi
QUESTION:

It did broaden the base.
Why wouldn't it have broadened it even

more to reinsure the life business, as well?
MR8 HARPER: Well* of course* the life business is
a little more profitable, among other things.

Credit life is

a much better deal than accident and health, and I think that
that was undertaken for business reasons, to make more money.
I think it was also undertaken, probably, because
of tax reasons.
I'd like to point out, though, that we took it «*“*
QUESTION:

In other words, on the A&H business,

your primary motivation was to broaden the base at the
sacrifice of some profit.

In the life business, you were more1

interested in making profit and not interested in broadening
your base.
MRe HARPER:

Well, this made it possible to broaden

— or to sell more insurance across-the-board, very definitely.
And it was very critical to broaden the base because you have
to set premiums,,

it has to be a reliable standard.

We want

to make some money.
The big thing about reinsurance, and they fail to
note this — the biggest thing about reinsurance is that it
tends to stabilize results.

The actuary xvho testified In our

54

case testified that the basic purpose is really to spread the
fluctuation of a company's earnings, to sort of level out
their claims experience.

And this is the kind of a transaction

that would have been undertaken with third parties just as
qv ickly as it would have been undertaken by people 'with enough
money in Georgia to bear the reinsurance risks.
Now, there are sound reasons for it.

The Government

complains that there was a carry-over provision.
too, spreads fluctuation from year to year.

Bit this,

It tends to

insulate you from shock losses, from catastrophic amounts
which could wipe you out.
X{d like to point out that, to some extent, this
risk test must depend on hindsight.

It is easy for Mr. Smith

to say there is not much risk of insolvency, but insurance
companies do go insolvent.

This very company, here, after it

went into accident and health

— and Exhibit 23 will show it

-- there were four years in which they lost money.
When they increased their sales by three-fold, they
then began to realize a profit on accident and health.

They

had to go into accident and health in order to meet the clamor
of their agents*
I think I must develop, to some extent, the business;
purpose.

I would like to go back to the rules of this Court

ano particularly to the Helvering v. Gregory case which we
quote all the time.

Everybody says you don't have to arrange

55

your affairs to pay the most tax»
Mro Justice Hand went on to say that the underlying
presumption is plain, that the Act was undertaken for reasons
germane to the business.

We do not proceed upon any business

purpose here that was not germane to and did not forward the
insurance business.
The reinsurer was required, and Judge Roney said;
"The reinsurer is required to commit its assets to reserve
status for reinsurance purposes and to pay tax on the reserve
for tax purposes."
They bore all the legal consequences of the required
reserves.

They reported the reserves as required by law and

there was no exception taken to it.

The reinsured bore none

of these risks.
The statement of requirement has an economic impact

56
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E, MICHAEL MAS INTER, ESQ,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT'
MR, MASINTER:

Mr, Chief Justice* and may it please

the Court:
I am counsel for Respondent Consumer Life Insurance
Company,
In this case* the Government seeks to reverse the
holding of the Court of Claims and asked this Coiirt to hold
that certain unearned premium reserves* relating to accident
and health Insurance* should be attributed* or imputed may
actually be a better xvord* to Respondent* reserves which
Respondent did not hold but were held by an unrelated insur­
ance company* reserves which Respondent was not required to
maintain pursuant to state law or state regulatory purposes*
reserves which Respondent vjas not required to maintain pursuayst
>

to standard accounting and actuarial principles applicable to
this industry.
This ease involves both the Treaty I and the Treaty
II situations.

In the Treaty I situation* American Bankers

Life Insurance Company was the unrelated company and It wrote
the insurance and Respondent was the reinsurer.
In the Treaty II situation* Respondent was the
insurer and the unrelated company was the reinsurer.
The facts are uncontreverted that the reserves were
actually held by American Bankers* the unrelated company* and

that American Bankers earned the investment income on these
reserves and included these reserves in their reports for
state reporting purposes0
Both Respondent and American Bankers were subject
to regular triennial examinations by the state authorites of
Arizona, Georgia, Florida, and other states»

During the years

at issue, none of these state insurance commissions required
either Respondent or American Bankers to change their method
of reporting these reserves.,.

,

As all the counsel seem to agree, the central issue
here is the definition of reserves as set forth in Section 801
of the Code, as to which we believe there are two overriding
principles.
Firstly, that the test for qualifIcafcion as a life
insurance company is clearly set forth in the Code as the re­
serve ratio test, . That is, to qualify as a life insurance
company, a company's life insurance reserves must comprise
more than 50$ of its total .reserves.
And, secondly, the Congressional intent is clear
that state law shall control in matters relating to the
substantive definition of insurance companies,

A

h

Nevertheless, in the face of these clear principles,
the Government seeks attribution of these reserves on a very
novel theory.

This theory is that reserves follow the risk,

- a theory which we would submit goes beyond the clear wording of

58

\

the statute and the intent of Congress, because this theory
maintains that the legal definition of reserves is:

Who bears

the ultimate insurance risk?
The terms "reserve," "total reserves," and "reserves
required by law,” are all used in the statute* but the statute
does not define them technically*
However, the cases in this Court have consistently
held — and this goes back to the Maryland Casualty case ■—
that these terms are deemed to have a technical meaning,
that is to say, a meaning consistent with that used by the
state law, by the state regulatory authorities, and a meaning
consistent with the common and prudent business practice in
the insurance industry.
Nonetheless, the Government argues, that state law
is irrelevant, and the Government also says today that the
state insurance regulatory authorities don't care about these
reserves as they are before the Court in the cases today.
We would suggest that the state regulatory authori­
ties, who have the primary responsibility for looking for the
safety of the policyholders and, therefore, looking for the
safety and importance of the solvency of these companies,
would not respond very favorably to the Government’s comments,
Now, the reserve ratio test, in Section 801, has bee.n
in the Code for a long time.
1921»

It was originally enacted in

The present statutory definition was enacted as part of

59

the Revenue Act of 1942, and during this long history never
has there been one suggestion, in any ease, or in the legis­
lative history before Congress that the test should be reserves
follow the risk.
Another thing that is important is that the cases
have always used the tern, “funds held*"

In fact, the

Treasury{s own regulations require that funds must be held*
In the pi'esent case, it is important to note that
in both Treaty I and Treaty II situations the accident and
health reserves covered by these reinsurance treaties were not
held by Respondent*

Pursuant to the terms of the treaties

themselves and pursuant to the requirements of state law,
these unearned premiums did not constitute the assets of
Respondent on its balance sheet.

Therefore, there was no

requirement that it maintain the corresponding reserve.
The "court below placed very heavy emphasis on the
requirement of the statutory provisions of the states of
Georgia and Arizona, in recognition, we would submit, of the
clear Congressional intent that state law must apply in matters
relating to substantive definitions of insurance companies*
The Government 8s argument In this case today ignores
the requirements of the state law as interpreted by the
regulatory authorities of both Georgia and Arizona*
The Court of Claims stressed the generally accepted
principle that where a statute is ambiguous or doubtful, and

60

In the absence of judicial authority to the contrary, the
uniform and consistent interpretation of that statute by the
regulatory body charged with the responsibility of administer»
ing the statute, is entitled to great weight»
This principle is clearly applicable in the present
case, and this Court should give great weight to the fact
that the state regulatory authorities of both Arizona and
Georgia made no change in the reporting of the reserves of
Respondent,
This was the ease even after there were two tri­
ennial examinations during the taxable years in issue»

This

was the case when special attention was given to these re­
insurance treaties and the reserves by the examiner from the
state of Arizona.
Even after these two examinations and this special
attention was given, no change was made in the reporting of
the reserves by Respondent.
Therefore, we would submit that a departure from
such a time-honored principle,as we have referred to, is not
warranted by the facts in this case.
As each of these consolidated cases clearly
indicate, we are swallowed up in a sea of complex terms and
equally complex contractual arrangements which are perplexing
to lawyers and laymen alike.
The depth of this complexity, it seems to me,

61
demonstrates even more clearly the Congressional wisdom of
leaving substantive definitions to the state regulatory
authorities who have a vested interest in regulating the
industry and who have the necessary training and expertise
to comprehend these complex reinsurance arrangements*
Indeed

<

QUESTION:

Counsel, could I just Interrupt on one

factual question?
Does the record tell us in the Treaty II situation
who does the administration, who actually pays the claim?
The reinsurer or the direct insurer?
MR, MASINTER:

Your Honor, I believe, under the

terms of the contract, the claim would have to actually be
paid by the direct insurer, because the contract provides
that the reinsurer shall reimburse the direct insurer*
Other than the contract, I don't think there is any
specific evidence on that point*
I would have to go further and explain that it is
common and customary in this industry for a company like
American Bankers, for example, to assist in maintaining the
books and the records because it is clear that they do have
the staff and the machinery and the computers, and that type
of thing, whereas the companies like Consumer do not have the
adequate personnel to perform the record-keeping*
Vie would submit, Your Honor, that these comple?:

62
reinsurance arrangements are the results of highly creative
people, actuaries and businessmen alike, and that once their
efforts have come together to produce a complex and sophisti­
cated reinsurance arrangement such as we have in these cases
today, that the Federal income tax consequences should flow
from the regulatory Interpretation of these arrangements and
not otherwise,,
Vie think it is very important that Federal income
tax consequences look to the substantive law of the state»
This is clearly the most efficient and effective method of
imposing our Federal income tax system on this industry and
will permit a greater certainty in the planning of the tax
and financial affairs of these companies»
The Government has argued on brief that the issues
and the cases dealing with the issue of sub-stance versus
form should be applicable in this case»
The Government cannot be heard to say that these
issues are applicable here»

These treaties cannot be dis­

regarded for lack of economic substance

or business«purpose»

The court below clearly found that these reinsurance
treaties had a business purpose, but moreover and more impor­
tantly* this theory should have no application to the reinsur­
ance transaction in this ease»
Out of the multitude of cases that have dealt with
the question of substance versus form* for this Court and other

63
lower Federal courts, one very clear common thread or common
principle has developed, the principle conceived by Judge
Learned Hand in his dissent in the case of Gilbert v.
Commlsaloner and which was followed by this Court in the
Knetseh ease*
Judge Hand{s test was if the taxpayer enters into
a transaction that does not appreciably effect his beneficial
Interest, except to reduce- his tax,-, the law will disregard it.
Stated conversely, this test would recognize business
transactions for tax purposes if they were treated consistently
for material non~fcax purposes„
Furthermore, we would submit that this test would
have fch$ effect of recognizing for tax purposes transactions
between unrelated parties dealing at arm's length, except
transactions which have no economic purpose apart from tax
aids, as clearly was the situation in the Knetchfc ease*
Since the transactions in the present case possessed
material business motives apart from tax deferment motives,
the appreciable effect test, as applied to the facts in this
case, would compel a result that these reinsurance transactions
should not be disregarded for lack of economic substance or
business purpose*
In this case, we see a factual situation where the
Respondent and an unrelated insurance company carefully arranged
their business relationship in a sophisticated business-like

64
manner, totally In compliance with state law. and state regula­
tory law and totally In compliance with the income tax
statute when it was permitted to qualify as a life insurance
c cmpany,
The challenge, it would seem to me, if any is to be
made., to this reinsurance arrangement which is so common in
the credit insurance industry, properly lies in the Congress,
where statutory provisions may be studied with care and
precision and where statutes may be written to apply in a
consistent fashion to the entire industry*
A result

that we:would submit is paramount in this

complex area of the law *
Sophisticated business arrangements that have been in
effect for many years in a particular industry, as is the
case here, should not be overturned on the basis of legal
theories which find no support in the case law, the legislative
history or in fact among the regulatory bodies who have the
responsibility for regulating the Industry and to whom the
Federal taxing law looks for substantive guidance*
We would strongly urge this Court to affirm the
decision of the Court of Claims*
Thank you*

Mr. Smith, you have about

65
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A0 SMITH, ESQ*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR . SMITH:

Yes*

I just have a few points to make*

Mr* Chief Justice.
Counsel for Penn Security* Mr. Jones* attempted to
characterize that Treaty I arrangement as one in which the
company, that is the taxpayer* assumed the risk as it received
the premiums on a monthly basis.
I think if the Court examines the agreement which
is set forth at page 40A of the Appendix* Article 2 contra­
dicts that assertion.

It says* "The liability of taxpayer on

all reinsurances shall begin simultaneously with that of
Pilot Life"

— that6s the other company «- "and in no event

shall the reinsurance of taxpayer be in force and binding
unless the policy issued by Pilot Life is in force."
I think it is plain that the purport of this
agreement was that at the very beginning* once the policy­
holder paid the premium* Perm Security and Consumer Life in
the Treaty I arrangement were on the risk.
And if they were on the risk* they had to project
that liability and they have to — those insurance reserves
are includable in its total reserves.
I would think that the tax law and the insurance
law is not that primitive that it cannot recognize that these
contractual assumptions of risk* in exchange for a receipt of

66
premiums -which are going to drop down to these taxpayers,
should not be attributed to it, as its accident and health
insurance business has to be includable in the total reserves,
the denominator of the statutory fraction»
1 have one last point to make and that Is with
respect to business purpose»

There has been a lot of talk,

this morning,from counsel for the taxpayers, about that there
were business purposes to these agreements, that they were
very sophisticated.

That may well be the ease, but there

was no insurance purpose to these Treaty II arrangements.
The risk .in the Treaty II arrangement stayed with
the taxpayers.

In the Treaty I arrangement it was real

reinsurance that was assumed by the taxpayers.
That, to us, means that It was insurance business,
accident and health insurance, which has to be attributed to
the taxpayers»
Thank you,
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
