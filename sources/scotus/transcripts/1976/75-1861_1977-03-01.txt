ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR J. RUBINQ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. RUB IN 0 s

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Courts
This is an appeal from a 4-to-3 decision of the
Nev? York Court of Appeals affirming appellant's conviction for
murder and specifically rejecting his claim that the New York
statutes, pursuant to which he was convicted of murder,
violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment*,
and that the New York statutes required him to bear the
persuasion burden at his trial for murder on the issue of
provocation, which, in Mew York, is the model penal cod©
formulation:

extreme ©motional disturbance.

The. issue on this appeal is whether, placing that
persuasion burden on appellant at his trial, in order to allow
him to exonerate himself of murder and be convicted only of
manslaughter, in fact violates his due process rights,
specifically in light of this Court's decisions in In Re Winship
and Mull&ney vs» Wilbur.
It is appellant's contention on this appeal that a
reversal of his conviction is required, because there is a

4
functional identity between the. challenged rule here of New
York Stata and the rule invalidated by this Court unanimously
in Mullaney.
And, furthermore, that in Mullaney the State of Maine.'
argued that in fact there was only one generic crime:
felonious homicide«

And that the provocation issue only

distinguished two punishment categories called murder and
mans laughter«,
It is clear in New York there are two distinct
crimes of murder and manslaughter, and therefore it is a more
clear violation of Winship.
I would like to stress at the outset that this appeal
presents a challenge to on® rule, the provocation rule, as
formulated by the model penal code, extreme ©motional
disturbance? and I think now it would only affect two States:
New York and Connecticut»
In Appendix A to our brief, we have listed the States
which have adopted the extrema emotional disturbance defense
and shown which States have placed the burden of persuasion
on th© defendant»
Currently it is only New York and Connecticut.

In

Connecticut there are now two lower court opinions applying
Mullaney, to place the burden on th© State.

That is, in two

trial courts, in two counties out of the six in Connecticut»
So th© issue on this appeal is, we argP®? very-narrow.

5

On rule arguably affecting two States,
QUESTION: Would you distinguish "extreme emotional
disturbance" from the various ranges of mental disease or
defect within the spectrum of so-called insanity?
MR, RUB IIJO:

Yes, Your Honor»

I think the starting

point is to understand that extreme emotional disturbance was
a formulation to expand the concept of provocation;, and that
it carried with it the requirement that there be a reasonable
explanation or excuse for the defendant's conduct»

I guess

the only way I can state the difference is to say ites
difficult to imagine that insanity, one would have to not only
show a certain state of insanity or certain disease, but then
say "I have a reasonable excuse for that»"
I think the very concept of insanity leaves aside that
kind of objective standard that ultimately anchors each of the
two concepts.

In other words, provocation must be explained.

It also goes less — insanity goes to the intellect,
and knowing right from wrong, and there is no such question
posed in the extreme emotional disturbance,
QUESTION: There is not?
MR, RUBINO:
QUESTION:

No,
Well, then what is the impact of the extreme

emotional disturbance on the volition of the actor, of the
defendant?
MR, RUBINO: The impact is that at 'the time at which

6

he has lost his self control*
know right from wrong.

It doesn’t mean he doesn’t

It is not a test — in other words, he

need have no disease or defect.

In fact, it assumes basically

that he’s a rational man who has then lost self control, just
as provocation was described by this Court in Hullaney.
QUESTION:

Would you equate it to the older vernacular

of SJin the heat of passion"?
MR. RUBINO:

I thin!-; it’s broader, Your Honor.

I

think, when you say equate, I would equate it only in the sense
that it performs the same function.

That that function is to

distinguish between the crime of murder and the crime of
manslaugh ter.
I would further say that it is clear, in J.aF&ve and
Scott, for instance, they do use the term interchangeably when
they speak of heat of passion, they -them say extreme emotional
disturbance.
QUESTION:
MR. ROBING:

Who does?

Who says this?

LaFave and Scott, Your Honor, in the

section starting at page 572 to 582, in discussing heat of
passion doctrines.
It is also interesting to look at those ten pages in
LaFave and Scott, and compare them.

We have, in Appendix B,

put together the comments un the Model Penal Code concerning
tiie revised formulation of heat of passion.

And of not only

the Model Penal Code but the Revisors in New York, the staff

7
notes»
And if we compare the various ways in which it; was
believed extreme emotional disturbance would expand the
provocation concept, we can see that it is still anchored in
provocation but it simply opens up more .situations and I8d
like, Your Honor, to go through those.
The point being that in each of the situations that
extreme emotional disturbance expands, or so-called expands,
tiie provocation concept of heat of passion, if we examine
LaFave and Scott, we see that there are already some States,
under the heat of passion concept, that had arrived there0
And so that ultimately what: w® are dealing with, we have a
label, the new label entails a more liberal scope of
provocation, but it is not different conceptually or function­
ally*,
I nay just take one example, because the New York
Court of Appeals stressed this particular liberalisation in
its opinion, and that is cooling time.
Under some heat of passion rules cooling time was
fairly restricted, and that the provocation had to spontaneously
cause loss of control and lead to the killing, and it was within
a very limited timeframe»
coaled down.

So that the defendant couldn't have

In other words. if he was provoked last month

by someone, he couldn’t go a month later and just shoot him and
claim provocation»

8

Th© point is that the extrema emotional disturbance
formulation allows a longer cooling time* allows* as the
Court of Appeals put it* a certain amount of brooding. This is*
1 think* Professor Wechsler's concept* that in fact heat of
passion or provocation and deliberation are not really
mutually exclusive* that if you think abut it* you can* by
deliberating* get more exercised about something rather than
less* and the extrema emotional disturbance concept was to
allow for a period of time0
But the point is that now you have a longer cooling
time* so to speak* allowed* what does that difference mean
constitutionally?

Why should that require a less reliable

verdict of murder in New York as opposed to Maine?
And if it went to hardship* that might be an argument,
but the facts of this case show that a longer cooling time here,
as* for instance, in self defense* where you deal with
antecedent circumstances* where you claim that the ~ you were
afraid of the victim and that’s why you shot* may go back a.
year, a year and a half.

But the time period is filled with

specific tangible facts and events.

Nothing special.

The

facts of this case are not exotic in teritis of provocation.
It’s a fairly classic provocation situation* in the
over-all context.

That is* the love triangle and the adultery

situation.
So that we have tried to show* in our brief* that

9
when w© say functional identity between the New York and Maine
rules, we are saying that these rules exist to distinguish
murder from mails laughter, that they are significant punishment
differentials.

In New York, extreme emotional disturbance

distinguishes between murder in the first degree, as well as
murder in the second degree, and manslaughter»
And, in fact, in murder in the first degree, the
reduction is not to murder in the second degree but to
manslaughter, which clearly shows not simply a dropping down
when you prove extreme emotional disturbance issue, but shows
the distinction

clearly between the crime of murder in New

York and the crime of manslaughter»
Winship was the germinal case in this area»

It

explicitly established that the Fourteenth Amendment due process
clause requires, and in the

words of Winship, proof of every

fact which goes to constitute the crime»
I think the problem that Mullaney presented in terras
of interpretation was that in fact the State of Maine said
we only have the crime of felonious homicide, and we have
proved it, we have proved an intentional killing»
The response of this Court was that we will look to
the substance of your law, and not to the formal designation
which you give»

And decide whether the due process clause

applies or the reasonable doubt standard applies»
And that has caused some comment that in fact MuHaney

10
has led to a rather broad view of what is required to be proved
by the State,, and might possibly lead to striking down a number
of affirmative defenses»

On this appeal we claim we are

within the four corners of Hu Haney , in that this does not reach
the issue of other affirmative defenses , and only the one
before us.
New York, as I said, does not have -- does not
present the problem that was presented by the State of Maine»
New York clearly has two crimes and clearly the provocation
issue, extreme emotional disturbance, here distinguishes them.
Now. what can be the distinctions?

The New York

Court of Appeals, 4 to 3 decision, really dealt with two
separate approaches to distinguishing Patterson from Mu Haney.
One is they look to the State law itself, of Maine,
and said that Maine, first of all, really didn’t require the
State to prove intent, and we say that is simply not true,
that the opinion of this Court in Mu Haney, the State of Maine
cases, indeed, the brief of the Attorney General in Maine
make it clear that intent has to be proved by the State of
Maine.
QUESTIONS
MR. RUBINO:

How about malic®? .
Malice had to be proved by the defendant,

Your Honor.

QUESTION:
crime

Well — yet it was an element of the

11
HR. RUB INO:

Your Honor, as I understand Hu Haney —

QUESTIONj And the State never had to prove it, never
had to prove it, it was presumed.
HR. RUBINOt

Yes.

That is true. This Court, in Mr.

Justice Powell's opinion, dealt with the concept of malice,
and said that it has two meanings in law.

One is it can be a

substantive element of intent, and really just stand in the
place of the word "intent" and be proved by the State.
The other is — the term was used, "policy presumption",
Perkins, who was cited at that point, describes malice in some
cases as really being a hollow concept, that really it's
defined by what it is not rather than what it is.
And one of the fellings it is not is provocation.
And the Maine courts themselves said that malice and provoca­
tion are indistinguishable, they are not separate issues.

We

have described this as being two sides of the same coin.
The Attorney general, in his brief in Mu Haney, argued
that in fact all malice did was to, in essence, trigger the
provocation issue to be proved by the defendant.
QUESTION;

But the fact is -- wasn't it the fact

that malice was an element of the crime but the State would
never have to prove ifc?
Let's assume the defendant put on no evidence whatso­
ever, and was found guilty by the jury.
MR. RUBINO;

If the defendant put no evidence in, or

12

if evidence of provocation didn't arise in the course of the
prosecution’s case, then there would be no instruction at all
concerning provocation or the ability to reduce to manslaughter
the crime»
QUESTION:

But, nevertheless, the malice would have

been presumed?
MR. RUBINO:

Only because, if we’re dealing with

burden of proof, malice is only relevant to the proof by the
State of intent, nothing else.

It simply ~ it was described

aptly by this Court in two footnotes.
and secondly, as surplus in the law.

One, as wholly unnecessary?
Because, what I’ve just

said about the distinctions in the way malice is used as a term,
that* it can actually stand for something to be proved, or it can
be merely a policy presumption that flews from proof of intent
by the State.
And the

as I said, the attorney general argued

this, that malice itself had no separate meaning in terms of
proof.

We’ve described this in terras of proving malice.

In Mains it’s a vesti gal organ, it simply is there.

It was

described, as I said, as wholly unnecessary and surplus.
And provocation is the other side of malice.
This Court, in MuHaney, said it would look to the
substance of the law, not the form.
In New York and in Maine, intentional killing is
murder unless provocation is proved by a persuasion burden,

13

preponderance of the. evidence by the defendant*

And it is this

that is the crucial distinction, and it is this that goes to
the violation of the defendant’s due process rights, Your
Honor*
QUESTION:

Hr* Rubino, may I ask you a question there?

You’ve suggested in your argument that Mu Haney might — even
if Mu Haney is read quite narrowly, you come within it, because
you come within the category of provocation, your —
MR* RUBINO:

Yes, Your Honor*

QUESTION: Would the same argument apply to self
defense? Would that be a form of provocation which logically
Mu Haney must apply to if it applies toyour case?
MR* RUBINO;
answer.

It could be*

I would — yes is the

I would argue separately on that*

I would argue that

self defense negates unlawfulness, which is an element of the
crime *
Also, it’s a question of what the other side of
malice is*

Perkins goes back and talks about malice as being

things that are defined by what it is not:

not justification,

mitigation or excuse*
Nov;, it’s possible to go back to that view of malice
and say that in fact where you have justification defense,
self defense, that whether or not the statute talks about it,
that what in effect you are asking tee defendant to do is to
negate malice in essence*

14
So, on self defense, I — ray answers are twofold»
I think, arguably, it can come specifically within HuHaney»
Furthermore, I think it might be a stronger case under Winship,
without necessary regard to Mullaney, because it really goes
to unlawfulnesso
QUESTIONS So you*re suggesting that probably —
although I realize that we need not necessarily

but probably

the same rule would apply to both kinds of provocation, even
though we don't have to do that to decide your case?
MR. RUBINOs

I believe

at least with respect to

self defense, I would argue that, yes.
QUESTION s

Yes.

MR. RUBINO:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION? Thank you.
MR. RUBINO;

Finally, tie New York Court of Appeals,

in addition to saying that, well, in Maine, all that had to be
-- the State didn't have to prove intent, we’ve said that that
is just not so, and that we’ve dealt with malice. The Court
of Appeals also said, Well, extreme ©motional disturbance is
really only mitigati.on.
Now, this Court, in Mu llaney,, dealt with that, in
Mr. Justice Powell’s opinion at pages 697 and 698, said that
tiie label was not dispositive, and that the degree of
criminal culpability in Maine, as elsewhere, at least where
murder and manslaughter are involved, at least in -that

15

situation, there's a protected interest»

So we are talking

also about degree of culpability# involved in Mu Haney and
involved here in Patterson»
The other approach of the Court of Appeals was one
I discuss in answer to a question»

I will just label it here.

And that is that the fact that the formulation of New York's
provocation rule was broader# and we say it is broader9
requires a distinction from Mu Haney»
And we’ve argued that# first of all# why it is
broader# the** ’*=# p**r <*e- no reason to allow less reliable
vejrdict# because the reasonable doubt standard is
vehicle which goes to reliability.

a procedural

It is not a reason to

allow a less reliable verdict of murder in New York than in
Maine.
Also# that the differences# if we look at liberal
rules under the heat of passion concept# and what the Model
Penal Code revisers # or what -the Model Penal Code was trying
to do# and what New York was trying to do# did not make that
great a distinction# and the distinctions don’t create an
unnecessary or unique hardship.

And that if they do# there’s

a less onerous means of dealing with a hardship question»
And that is to put the production burden on the defendant.
In this case the defendant clearly met a production
burden# the issue was as fairly in the case as stated in
Mu Haney.

In fact# in Mullaney # the defendant didn’t take the

16
stand or present any witnesses»

The

issue was raised in his

statement to the police»
So that the production burden is a less onerous means
of dealing with possible hardship if, indeed, that is a relevant,
criteria»
And, finally, I would like to say that Chief Judge
Breitel, in a separate concurring opinion, did, in a more
general way, react to Mullaney, and what he was saying is that
where we have newer defenses and more ameliorative defenses,
we ought to possibly allow the Legislature to. compromise a
little bit»

And, in order to get a new defense in, or a new

rule in, they should be allowed some leeway»
And our answer is the same:

that, in fact, when we

are dealing with a procedural vehicle, a neutral principle
that goes to reliability, that is, the reasonable doubt
standard, that we really shouldn’t look to the substance of
the State law, that the State should work it out»

And that

they can. work it out, we’ve shown in our Appendix, that -this
has been no bar at all to the adoption of extreme emotional
distress view of provocationi in Appendix A we show the States
that have done it, we show that today only New York and
Connecticut require the burden on the defendant»

And, in fact,

on two of the six counties in Connecticut, that’s — at least
at the trial court; it hasn’t reached the appellate court
no longer tru©

17
So I would just stress that we do try to narrow the
issue to provocation, and that we stress that we're talking
about a procedural vehicle, a neutral principle that doesn't
ask about something about extreme emotional disturbances

is

it good or is it bad, is it old or new, is it more liberal or
more conservative?
have it proved?

We just says

should we have to reliably

Because, otherwise, we will have murder

convictions in the State of New York that are less reliable
and less reliable than in Maine,
Your Honor, I would like to reserve whatever time I
have for rebuttal,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS Very well,
Mr, Finnerfcy,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. FINNERTY, ESQ, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. FINNERTYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I would, at the outset, like to point out that in the
State of New York, provocation does not have the connotation
that counsel has given it,
I would like to return to that, and also point out
factually that this was not, by any stretch of Idle imagination,
a classic love triangle situation.

The parties had been

separated some five to six months before this crime occurred.
The wife had started an action for divorce in the S'£afce of

18
New York at. that tiros. They had what were called a conciliation
proceeding.

A conciliator met with the parties, decided there

was no further necessity of those proceedings.

The defendant

himself had brought out a counterclaim for divorce.
Their attorneys were really , at that point,
negotiating a property settlement.
In October, some — over two months before the crime
occurred, the wife, Roberta, had told the defendant, that she
was going to marry the deceased after their divorce became
final.

He knew they were together.

He lived some 200 miles

away, himself? he had seen them together earlier in December,
and, in fact, had assaulted both the deceased and his

wife

and, on another occasion, her father.
Now, on the day of the murder, he came these over-200
miles, stopping along the way to see a friend and borrowed a
gun, and the friend*s car.

That was about 25 miles away from

the village of Bath, where this occurred.
He came to Bath, attempted to borrow another gun,
the first gun being a .22 weapon, introduced as the murder
v7eapon.

He attempted to borrow a shotgun in Bath.

Having

borrowed -that, he went out five miles to his wife's parents*
house, drove by there a quarter of a mile.

On December 27th,

it was dark out, h© saw the deceased’s car there.

He walked

back, loaded the gun on the way, -then looked in, cams through
the back door, shot the deceased twice in the head, attempted

19

to choke his wife, did choke her, released her before she lost
consciousness, forced the wife, without a coat, to take her
child, her infant, from the house and accompany him to the car»
Now, I submit to you that the provocation aspect, if
it depends on this being the classic love triangle of the
situation which appeared to him at that time, was not in the
case, the jury could not have found it because the defendant
knew

”•* , anything he might have seen through that window.
Now, in Pat tars on, the Court of Appeals basically

said:

As long as the prosecution must prove ©very element of

the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, specifically
that he intended to kill the victim beyond a reasonable doubt,
it's

not a violation of due process to require or permit,

may I say, the defendant to establish that he formed that
intent under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance.
We do know that in New York the common law developed
differently, and in New York heat of passion, those words, was
an affirmative element of a- form of manslaughter, rather than
a mitigating factor to a charge of murder.
And I think importantly, in any analysis of
Mu Haney, is to understand that in New York, since 1829, as
Judge Jasen stated, New York has not allowed malice to be
implied merely from the fact of a killing.
Now, this Court, in Mullaney, said that malice afore­
thought and heat of passion in ‘the Maine statute were mutually

20

inconsistent:e

Therefore, I would submit, if malice is con­

clusively presumed, which the ST&fee of Maine allowed, there
could be no heat of passion.,
This presumption means that the prosecution does not
have to prove an element of that crime beyond a reasonable
doubt, and this Court in Mu Haney, by requiring the prosecution
to prove that, really —- prove the absence of heat of passion,
is really requiring the prosecution to prove the presence of
malice, which could no longer be implied.
Thus, VJinship

or Mu Haney was a clear case for

the application of Winship,
In New York, as the Court of Appeals pointed out,
extreme emotional disturbance comes into the case only after
all of the elements of the crime have been proved.
Specifically, they talked at great length about the
intent to kill, rather than a .situation

pointed out that

having proved, let us say, in Maine, conduct sufficient to
cause serious physical injury.
that in the Mu Haney case.

I believe there was a charge of

That would amount to manslaughter

in New York, but in the State of Maine, given the benefit of
the presumption, that would rise to the level of

murder.

In New York, the defendant is permitted to avail
himself of extreme emotional disturbance only after all of the
elements, that is, the intent to cause the death and the
causing of death, have been found.

21

In a footnote in MuHaney, this Court speculated that
since the elements

excuse me, the facts of intent are not

general elements to the crime of felonious homicide, that one
generic category? instead they bear only on the appropriate
punishment category.
Under petitioner’s argument, that being the State of
Maine, a sentence, life sentence for any felonious homicide
could have been imposed unless the defendant was able to
prove that his act was not intentional or criminally reckless.
I think very importantly, and not as has been argued
by appellant here, Judge Jasen defined, rather than the Model
Penal Code or the drafters, he defined what extreme emotional
disturbance is in New York. And he said specifically that
the purpose is to permit the defendant to show that his actions
were caused by a mental infirmity, not rising to the level of
insanity.
And he continued speculating that there may have
been a significant mental trauma which has affected the
defendant’s mind for a substantial period of time, simmering
in the unknowing subconscious and then coming to the fore.
Well, provocation is not in that statute.

Provoca”

ticm, I would submit, at the same time this statute was drafted,
oame into the self defense statute, which the people are
required to disprove, as they are insanity in the State of
New York

MR. FINNERTYs

convict of murder.
Her© it would only h@ —
QUESTIONS Since malice was presumed.
MR. FINNERTYs

Since malice was presumed.

That would only be proof sufficient for manslaughter
in the State of New York, not with relation to extreme
emotional disturbance, but intending to cause -the deceased
serious physical injury, and death results, rather than an
intent to kill.
So, as conceded, there is separate criminal structure
all -the way down for different crimes in the State of New York.
In -

QUESTION:

Do you think — in New York, does extreme
<•

emotional distress — do judges instruct on what bearing it
does have on intent?

If any.
?

MR. FINNERTY:

I tliink# as Judge McDowell did in

this case, if the instruction is given it must properly be
given, that the intent to kill, if you find it# was formed
while under the influence of extreme emotional distress# as it
was charged in this case,
QUESTION:

But is the effect of proving extreme

emotional distress to destroy the necessary intent element?
MR. FINNERTY:
QUESTION:

Not at all# in New York,

I see.

MR. FINNERTY:

And I believe the statute and

certainly the majority in Patterson in the Court of Appeals in
the State of New York specifically stated it is not# intention
carries all the way through, intention to cause death.
This Court has not held that Winship requires that
any shifting of the burden of proof violates due process.
Basically from the Laland v. Oregon cited in the concurring
opinion of Mullaney and, indeed# in Rivera

Delaware decided

recently# where the State of Delaware does require the defendant,
to bear the burden of proof in an insanity case.
QUESTION:

But Leland v. Oregon was cited in the

Court’s opinion in MuIlaney —
MR. FINNERTY:

It was cited in a footnote in

25
Mu Haney»
QUESTION:

~ without any indication that it was

being undermined.
MR. FINNERTY; And specifically it was stated in the
concurring opinion that it was not.

Sq, therefore, if the

appellant's argument is that. Winship requires any concept of
shifting — and I would note that soma of the latrer courts,
at least in New York, before -the Patterson opinion, rather than
going further and in an analysis did decide that, that any
shifting violates due process, that is just what winship was
trying to avoid, I submit, a triumph of form over substance®
Because it locked the same, therefore a shifting, and
Winship controls.
QUESTIONS Well, you’re just saying that as long as
the shift doesn’t take place, if a defendant can exonerate
himself by proving soma facts, that doesn’t violate Winship?
MR. FINNERTYs

Precisely.

The mere fact of a shift

does not violate Winship.
QUESTION; But if you can reduce the degree of the
crime or exonerate yourself entirely by proving a fact, why
isn’t the 'absence of that fact, operatively and funtionally,
the same as making it an element of the crime?
MR. FINNERTY%

Because, I think perhaps referring

.•to a question you asked earlier, intent to cause death end
extreme emotional disturbance are not mutually consistent

26
factors# inconsistent factors„
QUESTION: Wall# that may be so# but# nevertheless#
the State says if you can prove X# the degree of crime is going
to be reduced# or you’re going to be found innocent# be
necessarily found innocent®

tod therefore# why# functionally#

isn’t that the same as saying — why shouldn’t the State have
to prove the absence of X# why doesn’t that make the absence
of X an element of the crime?
MR» FINNERTYs

The absence of X is not the element

of the crime# but the addition of X changes the crime of which
the proof originally sustained»
I see what you’re talking about# what we’re into:
if any fact is involved in a crime, the State

must prove or

disprove it to sustain the conviction of any crime»

But# as

Judge Breital pointed out# this -- because of the advances in
psychiatric findings and testimony — gives a benefit to a
defendant; and since this is. as the Court of Appeals said# a
mental infirmity not rising to the level of insanity# the facts
of that are not reload to provocation# they are not objective
thlnos that a iurv can look at# what happened at the time# they
are really something that, is in the defendant’s mind»
Since Winship does not require due process violated
every time -there's a shifting# I would submit to you that
mitigation itself# that concept#
required»

is not constitutionally

And Judge Breital spoke to this in his concurring

27
opinion*
The example might be:

what reaction would a State

Legislature have to make if it were faced with a choice between
requiring the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
a fact which is not required by du© process, or eliminating
that defense altogether?
I think the aspects of the affirmative defense
statutes in New York# and there are several of them appended
to our brief, show that in many cases the defendant possesses
unique knowledge which the State has decided to allow him to
us© in mitigation of his — in mitigation of the charge for
which the

evidence would convict him*
If mitigation is not constitutionally required, then,

rather than violating the du© process clause, Hew York Lae
merely gone beyond th© Constitution, beyond what is required
of th© .State to do*
It strikes m© tlsfc the appellant's argument is to
require

is to ask this Court to hold that winship requires

any shifting violates du© process*

If that is the case, we

.are then into the situation of what type of scheme:

Is it that

heat of passion on sudden provocation, which was not known in
!Sew York, the penal lav? in New York developed entirely
differently, or is it extreme emotional disturbance in some
other form than a mental infirmity not rising to the level of
insanity?

28
tod Mew York has the persuasion burden, but what is
then the burden of production or a persuasion burden?
Appellant is really asking the Court to redraft the mitigation
concept which I believe the State of New York has tried to do
so to grant benefits to persons who would otherwise stand
convicted of criminal offenses„
Very briefly, the points made in appellant’s argument,
which I would disagree with:
No. 1 is that these two defenses are functionally the
same? they ara not»
tod provocation now being a part of self defense in
New York is not 'the question here; the question is, does
Winship require that shifting violates due process, and d^es
Winship require that the defendant have no benefit from
*

mitigation or that the State can require him to bear a rather
unique burden of proof her©0
Thank you®
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Do you have anything
further, Mr. Rubino?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR Jc RUBXNQ, ESQ0,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRo ROBINGs

Yes0

I would like to point out, on this business of Intent
in New York and Maine, it operate the same.

In New York you

must prove intent, and in. Maine the district attorney must prove

29
intente
That provocation factor does not negate intent*
*

neither in New York nor Maine0
I find it .ironic* if you look at the briefs in
MuHaney, it was the State arguing that malice was really of
no meaning in that that provocation distinguished punishment
categories.

The State said that malice operated solely to

trigger the provocation issue.
The brief of the Attorney General in Maine just says
vary clearly that a specific subjective intent to kill is
required.

And so that there are no differences in the way

that the cases of murder have to be proved in either New York
or Maine,
Finally, I'd like to stress that we are not talking
about the substance of State laws * that we are not saying that
Mullaney or Winship require the State to make any particular
facts germane.

Just as in heland* one other issue was not to

make the irresistible impulse test a test of insanity.
We are not trying to argue that a State must make
a particular factor germane* but if it does make that factor
german© to a distinction between murder and manslaughter* with
significant ~~ significant penalty differentials* and
significant differential of stigma, that was discussed in
Mullaney* then it must prove -that fact.
QUESTION %

Would you say -the same is true about any

30
fact that determines whether there is any crime at all or not?
MR. RUB I NO s
Your Honor.

I don't think Mu Haney reaches that#

I would say that an argument

QUESTION? But you seem to.
MR. RUBINOs
QUESTION?
MR. RUBINOs

I mean, you —

I believe that, yes,
Your approach seems to encompass that®
If my approach encompasses it, it's

because I believe that Mnilaney encompasses it. Your Honor.
All I’m saying is that, for the provocation issue, particularly,
we don’t have to decide whether Mu Haney goes beyond* it might.
I feel it does in certain defenses.
I think, however, that each defense and each factor
must be. looked at independently, just as the question was asked
about self defense.

There are an enormous number of issues *—

this case, in preparing for it, is a course in criminal law.
And on© must examine each concept for its effect on stigma, on
sentencing differential, and on peculiar, let’s s&y, hardship
of proof, and whether or not it’s really a policy defense,
like the minority view of entrapment is, and 'whether, if it’s
simply a policy -that we're talking about,-whether that would
have to be proved by the State.
*

QUESTIONs Well, ©very — all criminal law represents
State policy, doesn't it?

It’s all policy, in ©very State.

MR. RUBINOs What I meant — let me just distinguish.
QUESTION:

A State can decide, I suppose, not to

31

have any criminal law.
MR. RUB I NO s

It’s just policy.
Yes , I believe that’s true.

When I said “policy” I mean — I'll give an example;
In entrapment, a minority view says that we’re only looking to
police conduct, and that, therefor®, it really does not go to
the defendant’s -» whether tha defendant was predisposed, it
doesn't go to whether the defendant intentionally committed
the crime? it's a policy that we have superimposed, and that
naed not be dealt with in the trial phase at all.

It could be

a pretrial hearing.
That’s what I meant by the term "policy”.
also an abandonment.

There is

Possibly a policy that really what we

want to do is encourage abandonment, that it’s

really not

excusing the defendant, and that you might make a distinction,
depending on what the State itself said about abandonment, not
what this Court would in any way tell the State what to do.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2;30 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.3
