Mr. Watkins, vou may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN J. NATKTNE, ESO.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. WATKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1965, Congress enacted Title XIX of the Social
Security Act which has commonly been referred to as MedicAid.
The general purpose of that statute was to provide necessary
medical services for the indicent and near-indigent as they may
be determined by the states.
It is an optional program on the states.

The pri­

mary or premium -judgment -- the medical judcment of the physi­
cian was, of course, the primary factor to determine which
services

should be reimbursed and which should not.
It was left up to the states whether or not the

recipient or the provider would be reimbursed for the services.
There are general requirements in the statute that require
equality of treatment for the various croups that are covered
within a program and there are general descriptions of the types
of services that are required.
There are five basic categories of services which
cover such thincrs as in-patient services, out-patient services,

skilled nursing services, physician services and the like,
Pennsylvania opted to participate in this program
and accordingly, drew up a plan, a Medicaid plan which was
submitted to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare
and approved by the Department.
The plan, again, consistent wit Title XIX, places
primary reliance on the physician's judgment as to which
services in the covered categories would be necessary and
required.

As required also by the federal statute, Pennsylvania

has a utilization review program which reviews the use of
services to make sure that unnecessary services are not being
spent and reimbursed under the program.
,As part of the program, Pennsylvania covers
pregnancy-related services including abortion.

However, each

sxich service must be medically necessary at the time of its
utilization.

This is where the controversy arises in Pennsyl­

vania in this case.
Pennsylvania's abortion policy basically requires
that at the time the abortion service is rendered, it be
medically necessary in the judgment of the physician.

That is,

that the condition for which the abortion is prescribed threaten
the health or the life of the mother.
There is also a two-doctor concxsrrence and a require­
ment that the abortion be performed in the JCAH-accredited hos­
pital .

Those two requiregents were never liticated in
earnest in this case and it is quite reasonable with respect to
the two-doctor concurrence because that, I am told, in practice
is rather a rubber stamp.
In any event —
OURRTION;
in earnest"?

what do you mean,"was never litiqated

Was it liticated at all?
MR. WATKINR:

Tt was raised — it was challenged in

the oriqinal complaint, Mr. Justice Rlackmm.

However, it was

the decision of the district court and the decisions*d: the court
of appeals do not discuss these issues and their compliance or
lack of compliance with respect to Title XIX nr the Constitu­
tion .
The Plaintiffs in this case were all precnant
women with preanancies rancinc, I believe, from seven to 17
weeks te>*m.
By their own admission, some — at least some of the
Plaintiffs in affidavits filed and contained in the Joint
Appendix ----- some of the women soimht their abortions for reasons
totally unrelated to health.

In fact, the stipulation of

counsel filed in this case so states.
Accordingly, these women were not able to nrocure
the required certification of medical necessity from the
attending physician or two other physicians and therefore, they
were unable to receive the abortion because they were indicent,

6

they wprp unable to provide the funds for the abortion on their
own.

Thus this lawsuit was filed challenainq these Medicaid

regulations on both the statutory basis and the constitutional
basis.
The district court held that Pennsylvania's medical
necessity requirement as applied to abortion does not violate
Title XIX but that rather, the court went on quite properly
and decided that under the Constitution, in its view, with one
iudrre dissentincr, the recralation ■violated the 14th Amendment
Equal Protection Clause.
The court of appeals en banc effectively reversed
that holdina of the lower and found that Pennsylvania *s
Medicaid reoulations, as applied, violate Title XIX of the
Social Security Act.
QUESTION:

what did it do about the constitutional

question?
ME. WATKINS:

It did not no to the constitutional

question under this Court's teachina in hanans v. Lavine.
There are, in my view, at least seven compelling
reasons why this holdincr of the court of appeals en banc must
be reversed.
First, as the Court was well-aware, in 1P65 when
Title X.lX was enacted, non-therapeutic —- and T mia'nt say at the
outset that I am usino the terrs non—therapeutic and medically
unnecessary interchangeably.

I do not see any distinction

7
between the two, nor did the court of appeals, nor did —
QUESTION;

Mr. Catkins, are you tyinc that defini­

tion, however, into what was said here in Doe against Bolton?
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

I am, Mr. Justice Blackmun.

So that you are conceding that medical

necessity, under the Pennsylvania statute, means what was
spelled out here in Doe against Dolton?
MR. TtfATKINS:

Absolutely, and there is nothing in

the record in this case to indicate to the contrary.
QUESTION:

In fact —-

Well, that is a substantial concession

on your part, isn't it?
MR. WATKINS:
Mr. Justice Blackmun.

Well, it is not a concession at all,

The 1970 policy of the Pennsylvania

Medical Society which formed the basis for our reoulations in
fact points out that both psychological or physical health
reasons certainly should be taken into account by the physician
in determining the necessity of an abortion and, as well, I
might say, the physicians in Pennsylvania, like every other
state, are certainly bound by the pronouncements of this Court
and the teachings of this Court.
Pennsylvania certainly realizes that it couldn't
restrict the physicians' judgment to any more narrow a scope
than this Court pronounced in those cases.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather from some of your prior

remarks you were equating it to almost an abortion on demand,

but 1 am accepting your concession, then.
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

I am —

And I want no misunderstanding about it.

MR. WATKINS:
my concession.

That is correct.

Let me -- lot me make perfectly clear

That is, that a physician, in examining a

patient, may take psychological, physical, emotional, familial
considerations into mind and in the light of those considera­
tions, may determine if those factors affect the health of the
mother to such an extent as he would deem an abortion necessary.
I think the key in the Bolton lancruaae, and the
key in the Vu.tt.ch language is the fact that the physician,
using all of these facts — and there are probably more that he
should use — must determine if the woman's health — that is,
her physical or psychological health is jeopardised by the
condition of pregnancy.
That is not to say, obviously, as I believe the
Plaintiffs are asserting, that the fact that the family is
croing to increase makes an abortion medically necessary.
If that were the case and if that is what thi3
Court meant, then I would say that what we are really saying
is that the only medically unnecessary abortion is when the
woman is not pregnant and I don't believe that this Court, was
reaching that result in Vuitch or Bolton.
C>UESTION:

Certainly —

Possibly the subjective psychological or

emotional problem caused by the expectant mother, by her concern

9

about the increase in the family miqht be a health problem
such as would lead a physician to certify that an abortion was
medically necessary.

You would concede that?

MR. WATKINS:

Absolutely.

don’t consider these concessions.

MR. WATKINS:

— in fact, until the filinq of

Respondent's brief in this case, the use of the term "health"
in Pennsylvania has never even been raised.
The fact of the matter is, in Pennsylvania, it is
the physician who determines whether or not an abortion is
medically necessary.
QUESTION:

Now, what —- apart from the certifica­

tion by the two other physicians —

loner as it is legal and as loner as their professional organiza­
tion says that they are practicing medicine within the proper

the portent of this plan.
QUESTION:

Association or some other such authority might step in on that

Well, they are — and I — this is a

Now, if a certification of medical necessity came

and I am telling you now what the

department tells me, although, again, the record doesn't con­
tain this because it was never challenged — if, on the face of
it, It is apparent that, say, that physician never treated this
individual, then there would be a review.

But if

there is

would be --- there is no different treatment of an abortion

QUESTION:

I take it, though, that in the state's

view there will be a substantial number of cases in which a
physician would not certify medical necessity but nevertheless
it would be an abortion that the woman would have a constitu­
tional right to obtain under this Court's decisions»
MR» WATKINS:

Well, that is ~ if this Court

analyses the constitutional problem on the basis of reasonable­
ness, which I think is the appropriate standard, then I would
say that these requirements also ?neet constitutional muster
because they are entirely reasonable as a medical services
program, a medical services program»

We are talking about that segment ~~

12
MR. WATKINS:

1 misunderstood your question.

QUESTION:—argued by my brother White, of women
who would have a constitutional right to have an abortion
performed but who no reasonable- qualified physician could
certify that it was necessary for her health.
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Unless there is such a segment, this

case shouldnst be here.
MR. WATKINS:

That is absolutely correct.

In fact,

that is what -- that is the situation these plaintiffs were in.
They were unable to obtain that certification of medical
necessity.
QUESTION:

General Watkins, before you leave that

point, the court of appeals listed five things, five conditions
that had to be met, each one of the five before an abortion
would be performed.

It seemed to me they described the right

to an abortion in Pennsylvania as narrower than you describe it.
Am I —- are you describing a nontherapeutic abortion
in the same terms that the court of appeals found it?
MR. WATKINS:

I believe so.

In other words, when

I say — the bottom line of those regulations, other than the
physical deformity provision, the bottom line is whether or not
the pregnancy creates a condition that jeopardizes, threatens,
the health or life of a mother and my point is that when the
physician examines the mother, he, of course, applies this

13
Court's teachincrs in Vuifcch and Bolton to determine whether or
not there is a health-threatening condition.

Anything to the

contrary would clearly violate the holdings in these cases.
QUESTION:

Is that made clear to the physicians in

Pennsylvania?
MR. WATKINS:

Well, I assume that it is by virtue

of the fact that the Pennsylvania Medical Society, which I
assume represents a good segment of them, issued the policy
statement from which we adopted these regulations and, in
fact, contained in the brief in the section "statutes involved,"
there is a hypothetical that the Medical Society used to point
out that psychological and emotional as well as physical
considerations may well be taken into account.
I might add that that —
QUESTION:

That is in the record.

MR. WATKINS:
record, your Honor.
of my brief.

That is in the — that is not in the

That is in fche"statutes involved" section

I think it was, in fact, a published Medical

Society position.
Returning to the other reasons why I feel that the
court of appeals opinion must be reversed — and I'll try to
move more rapidly -— as 1 pointed out, a nontherapeutic abortion
in 31 states at least in 1965 was, in fact, illegal.
It is difficult for me to imagine that Congress
would have mandated **- and. we have got to keep that in mind —

14

•fchnt the Respondents in this case are areruino that not only
does Title XIX allow reimbursement for non-therapeutic abortions
but in fact, it requires it.
It is difficult for me to conceive that Congress
would have required states to fund a procedure that wasf in
fact, illegal in a vast majority of them.
Secondly, Title XIX itself makes no mention whatso­
ever of abortion.

Couple that with the fact that every time,

save one, every time that Congress has addressed this issue, it
has in one way or another expressed its clear displeasure with
non-therapeutic abortions.

The save one is the possible re­

moval of the prohibition against funding of abortions as a
family-planning device.
But there has never been an affirmative expression
or approval by Congress of non-tharapeutic abortions or funding
thereof.
Next, and fourth, I believe this is, every other
circuit court that I am aware of that has addressed this issue
has gone contrary to the Third Circuit on this point.
Fifth, Pennsylvania's medical necessity requirement,
and I have already alluded to this, is entirely reasonable.
There can be nothing more reasonable, in my view, than in a
medical services program relying on the judgment of the physi­
cian to determine which services are reasonable, which services
are necessary and which services are not.

15

Sixth? the lower court’s reasoning? which basically
relies on two points? is faulty.

First? they — the court held

that the medical necessity requirement interferes with the
judgment of the physician.
Well? we have discussed this already but again I'll
reiterate it so that there is no confusion about Pennsylvania’s
position.
QUESTION:

Do you regard that as somewhat a contra­

diction in terms?
MR. WATKINS:

I certainly do.

The lower court's

holding? in fact? I found a little bit curious in the sense
that it says that we interfere with the physician's choice of
nontherapeutic abortion.

To me? that is a contradiction.

Physicians, exercising their medical judgment?
don't choose non-therapeutic services.

The exercise of medical

judgment? a fortiorari to me?means that when the physician
determines the services necessary he is determining that it is
necessary for medical reasons.
QUESTION:

Well? some physicians perform profes -

sional services for purely cosmetic reasons.
MR. WATKINS:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

Pennsylvania

does not pay for those as part of its medical proaram.
QUESTION:

No? but in other words, why is it a

contradiction in terms?
MR. WATKINS:

Because

16

QUESTION:

Physicians do other thinas besides

therapeutic thincrs.
MR. WATKINS:

That is correct but it would see!" to

me that a nose repair, say, tor purely cosmetic reasons, would
not be a therapeutic procedure.

It would be a medical service?

there is no question that a physician would be required to
perform it.
QUESTION:

Properly and legitimately performed by

a physician.
MR. CATKINS:

There is no question about it and a

physician probably would be required to perform it but that
does not make it medically necessary.
QUESTION:

No.

MR. WATKINS:

In other words, when the physician

examines this individual, his diagnosis

would not be, you need

The physician in that instance that you

raised, Mr. Justice Stewart, is really a technician.

He per­

forms a service requested by the patient.
The motivational factor is probably key in this
case,

who requests the service?

requests the abortion?

Is it the physician that

If it is, we pay.

Is it the woman that requests the abortion?

If it

is, then we want to know from the physician, despite this
request, in your judgment, is this procedure necessary?
That is why I say I think the Court's holding in the

1?
first instance is probably a contradiction in terms,-, at least
to my mind.

I have yet been unable to understand the distinc­

tion between non-therapeutic and medically unnecessary.
Secondly, the court held that our medical necessity
requirement violates the aeneral broad equality provision of
Title XIX.
Now, T have examined that reasoning very closely
and all that can be said for it is that they pointed to no
instance in Pennsylvania xvhere the medical necessity requirement
is not applied and in fact, if the lower court's opinion
stands, what will be created is a situation where the wonan who
requires an abortion for nonmedical reasons will be treated
differently than all other medical assistance recipients in
Pennsylvania because she will be entitled to reimbursement for
a procedure nonmedically necessary where no others would.
The final reason that I am convinced that the lover
court's opinion must be reversed is the fact that the Res­
pondents themselves have conceded that a medical necessity
requirement is, in fact, permissible under Title XIX.
I have addressed this in ny reply brief.

Unfor­

tunately I was informed this morninq that my opposinq counsel
had not yet received it.

I furnished, him a copy.

certain what the problem was there.

I am not

Service was made.

The problem with this position of the Respondents
is, first, that it is a little late.

They have never

18
questioned the use of the tern ’’health" in Pennsylvania before.
There has been no discussion of it in either of the opinions
below.

The fact of the natter is, and we have discussed

this

quite at length, Pennsylvania as early as 1970 recognized that—
and, in fact, nakes no — has no intention to interfere with
the exercise of that physician's judgment.
T,Te just want to nake sure, we want to insure that
that step is not onitted.

It is a medical services program.

Therefore, we want the physician to tell us if these services
are required, not the woman.
Now, there have been some fairly sophisticated
definitions and syllogisms urged upon this

Court by amici and

the Respondents; one being that it is the condition of preg­
nancy that determines whether

a service is medically necessary.

1 would submit to you first that Pennsylvania does
not fund conditions.

It funds services and again, it is the

physician —
QUESTION:

Hut it does fund pregnancy at some time,

doesn't it?
MR. WATKINS:

No question about it.

Yes, Mr. Justic<

Blackmun.
QUESTION:

And isn't that a pretty good argunent

that, it does fund conditions?
MR. WATKINS;

No, T would only say that the condi­

tions or pregnancy —- for instance, one physician may treat

prermancv with a series of services, A, R, C.

Pennsylvania

pays for those.
Another physician may treat preonancy with services

I am sorry , Mr. Justice Blackmun.

The arqument can be made and has been made.

I don't see the

time, quite frankly.
The second step of this rationale is that medical
necessity must be defined as that type of procedure, that
procedure which is a safe and efficacious response to the
problem.
First, what is the problem?

OUESTION:

T,7ell, by hypothesis, thouoh, these

oeople have qone to some doctor, have they not, who would
perform an abortion.

I mean, they have not qone to a midwife.

MR. WATKINS:

Jell, no, a temporary restraining

order was issued.

Is that —?

QUESTION:

Well, hut isn't the crist of their com­

plaint that they can find a doctor who would perform an abor­
tion but that Pennsylvania would not nav for it under the
circumstances

if they perform it.

MR. WATKINS:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, they

can't find a doctor that would say the abortion is medically
necessary to preserve or to stave off a threat to their health.
They certainly could find a doctor who would per­
form the abortion, iust as I could certainly find a doctor to
perform cosmetic suraerv.
The distinction is that one is a consumer service,
albeit medical.

The other is a medical prescription for treat­

ment and that is what Pennsylvania •—
QUESTION:

Related to health.

MR. WATKINS:

Related to health.

That is what

Pennsylvania intends to fund with its limited Medicaid resources
and if this Court would reverse the lower court, that is what
Pennsylvania will be permitted to fund.
QUESTION:

General Watkins, in Pennsylvania, is it

lawful for anyone except a doctor to perform an abortion?
MR. WATKINS:

I don't believe that it is but I am

not 100 percent certain.
QUESTION:

Well, it is not a consumer service that

just anybody could perform.

21
MR. WATKINS:

That if? correct.

It if? a medical

service but the distinction to me is very real and very clear.
That is, if I rro to a physician because T an dissatisfied with
my appearance, 1 know that I have to no to a physician because
I can't net that service anywhere else, so it is a medical
service, no question about that.
But the physician isn’t tellincr me that I need that
service to preserve my health.

I am tellinc the physician I

want it because my solcial life is at an impasse.
QUESTION:

Well, but I take it when the preqnant

person qoes to the doctor, sooner or later she is croinq to
require some kind of service by that doctor or some other
doctor.

QUESTION:

Well, now, if the physician makes a

reason.

MP. T'TATKINA:

well, no.

Well, Pennsylvania does

not place a premium on a physician's choice of an abortion for
non-medical reasons.

The reason to me is entirely reasonable.

Physicians are trained in the skill of diannosinc medical
needs.

Pennsylvania places a premium on that.
Pennsylvania does not place a premium on a physician's

recommendations of how to provide a better economic or social
environment for that particular family,

'f’hat is entirely

reasonable in my view.
Thus, if the physician at any stane in the preo—
nancy says,"abortion is necessary.” it is oaid for, or any
other service.

It is paid for.

If the woman — in fact, if the woman came in and
demanded delivery services before the physician said they were
necessary, they would not be paid for, either.

It is the

question of who is requestina the service, who determines
whether it is necessary.
The problem with the lower court's analysis is
that if it is extrapolated it would be very difficult to cap.
If von determine that it is a condition that determines medical
necessity you really have taken the physician out of it.

You

have taken the physician out of the proqram, thus Pennsylvania
can list 30 or 40 conditions and that is it.
Anv service that any physician will perform for

23

that condition, beit an accurate dispensation of services or
not, Pennsylvania must be required to oav.

The Court has today before it in Title XIX what the
Second Circuit has otherwise described as a Iona and complicated
statute.
Given the complexity of the statute, Respondents
submit that the statute is certainly capable of various
■judicial approaches.

The approach which Respondents have

for the delivery of pedicel services to the indicent.
That is, the state, the provider of services and
the recipient of the services,
Keepincr that distinction in rand, as we rro through
the araument I think it is important to keep in rand the

tion and state attempts to limit a physician's choice of
alternative treatments for a oiven condition because as we see
with the situation of nrermancv and the alternative treatment
for that condition, that the realm of the physician's discre­
tion which my brother at the bar, Mr. Watkins, suacested he was
not trvino to interfere with, is, in fact, beinq interfered
with.
what Respondents have done is look to Section 1396
(A al7) of the act which requires, mandates upon the state that
they include reasonable standards for determining the extent of
medical assistance and that those standards must be consistent
with the purposes of the act,
T,That Respondents extrapolate from that lannuaae is
that the state must have some rational reason when they Herrin
to eliminate services from coveraae under the Medicaid proaran.
OiipcTIOW:

Mr. Crosby, I am interested in one

preliminary matter and I should have asked Mr. Watkins, maybe.

26
Do we have today funding for these abortions that
your clients want?
MR. CROSBV:

My clients, of course, your Honor, the

11 Respondents have already received their abortions pursuant
to the temporary restraining order back in 1973.
The state instituted a temporary revised policy
where they eliminated the distinctions between medicallynecessary and other abortions and that is in effect today.
DURATION:

As a result of this litigation and this

injunction?
MR. CROSBY:

Well, yes, the Third Circuit's

declarators judgment, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

But are funds available?

MR. CROSBY:

Honor,

To the best of my knowledge, your

yes.
QUESTION:

In the light of the Hyde Amendment, are

funds available?
MR. CROSBY:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
I want to he sure we have a live

controversy here.
MR. CROSBY:

I think we do.

I don't think, if we

are talking about a mootness issue in terms of the Hyde

Amend­

ment, I don't think, given the fact that it was enjoined and it
is still enjoined, that it is still the state policy, the old

27
state policy, but for the temporary Bayh’s policy that we would
be functioning under.
Continuing then, what Respondents assert is that
we must look at what interests the state might sugcrest are
being furthered by the restrictive Medicaid abortion policy
which is consistent with what the lower court did.
Initially we looked to a fiscal interest and
Respondents submit, as the lo^tfer court found, that given the
cost of prenatal obstetrical and post-parturn car®, that there
is simply no fiscal interest being furthered by the state8s
restrictive Medicaid abortion policy.
QUESTION:

Are you arguing the constitutional

question or the statutory question?
MR. CROSBY:

Only the statutory question,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

And why do you look to these particular

interests in arguing the statutory question?
MR, CROSBY:

I think that the fiscal interest, for

example, that there is — that the statute — Congress ^•^as
concerned about the state's concern for its limited financial
resources to distribute limited Medicaid resources and that is
why we would submit that the state could in some cases rely on
the saving of money as an interest to eliminate particular
services.
QUESTION:

Well, don't you have to start from the

28
other end* though, and show why the 1965 Act of Congress pre­
vents Pennsylvania from doing this unless it can show these
interests you are talking about?
MR, CROSBY;

I think, your Honor, if you are talking

about a standard for inclusion, then what what we are saying is
what the attorney for the state said in his argument.
That is, that he is going to look to the physician’s
discretion.

To the extent that a particular service is within

the legitimate practice of medicine within the state, then it
is included because of the emphasis that the

statute puts on

the physician’s discretion and that works to the best interest
of the recipient.
QUESTION;

When you sav ’’the statute," do you mean

the Pennsylvania statute?
MR. CROSBY;
QUESTION:

No, your Honor, the Social Security Act.
What is your authority for that last

statement?
MR, CROSBY;

The emphasis that the statute places

on the physician's discretion is found in several places, as we
have analyzed in our brief.
First we looked to the simplicity of administration
and the best interest requirements, specific statutory require­
ments and say that within those two provisions is found the
notxon that the recipient’s best interest can only be furthered
when the doctor is making the decision as to alternative

29
treatment for a given condition but to the extent that the
state becomes involved in those medical determinations, as this
Court realized in Doe v. Bolton, that the best interests of the
recipient are not being served.
We would also point to the precedent of — excuse
me, not precedent but the lower court decisiors in Roe v.
Ferguson and Roe v. Morton indicating that the statute places
great emphasis on physicians5 discretion and also we point to
page 8 of the brief for the state where they have agreed that
the statute places great emphasis on physicians' discretion,
QUESTION:

Well, what if the state excluded

appendectomies?

interests.

it?

%

MR. CROSBY:

Correct, your Honor,

what we are

sayina basically is that what that means is that, given that
the particular service

is within the legitimate practice of

medicine, then the state is croing to have to show some specific
interest as being furthered by thair exclusion of that

31

acceptable practice and this is particularly important when you
are talking — when the state is not eliminating broad condi­
tions, as the lower court recognised.

It is particularly

important when the state is directly interfering with the
choice of the physician.
QUESTION:

Does the record show that doctors would

have performed these abortions in these people here?
MR, CROSBY:

Yes, your Honor,

If they had been —

if they were going to be reimbursed, they would have, with the
stipulation, the affidavit of Attorney R. Stanton Wetfcick.

believe it is at page 31 of the Appendix.
QUESTION:

Even though it was not medically

required?
MR. CROSBY:

No, the physicians refused to perform

the abortions and that is why the

Pennsylvania at least claims that it’s program provides for?
MR. CROSBY:

HR. CROSBY;
QUESTION;

Correct, your Honor, but we submit —
And that the department that adminis­

tered the act says that this is what the act aims at, namely,
just necessary medical services and that Pennsylvania's program
is consistent with the act.
MR. CROSBY;

what we submit, your Honor, is that

the state could look to considerations of medical necessity
in certain cases, especially when eliminating broad conditions.
Normally when they are doing that, it is going to
be accompanied by the interest in terms of saving money.
QUESTION;

Well, anyway, that language is in the

act and it is relevant and it does bear on the case.
MR. CROSBY;

It bears on the case, so far, your

Honor, as to what Respondents are saying, is that under the
particular issue before the Court today, the state's overall
interest in terms of saving money, preserving maternal health
and safety, they are not going to be defeated by affirming the
circuit court's decision.
Proceeding to the second interest which, as I just
mentioned, was maternal health and safety, I would refer the

34

Court to an article not mentioned in Respondent’s brief which
is the morbidity and mortality report of HEW, Volume 24, number
3 dated January 18th, 1975 simply substantiating the notion
that abortion in any trimester ■— abortion services in any tri­
mester are safer in terms of mortality and morbidity than
childbirth.
And I would also refer the Court to the statement
to that effect in the affidavit of Dr, Douvlass S. Thompson in
the Appendix at page 36a„
The final potential
QUESTION:

Before you ero on, let me return to the

appendectomy.
MR. CROSBY;
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Hypothetical.

There was a period in

medical practice, as these things go, when appendectomies were
a fad and doctors were doing them and surgeons were doing them
in a preventive way so that you don’t have an attack of appen­
dicitis while you are out on a hunting trip or some such thing.
Now, suppose you had an appendectomy which is
performed but where there was no medically-indicated acute
condition or necessity for it —
MR. CROSBY;
QUESTION •
perform it.

Well —
-- for which a surgeon could be found to

Pennsylvania should

pay for an elective appen­

dectomy which is not medically indicated?

35

MR. CROSBY:

In a situation like that, your Honor,

given the utilization review, we would submit, no.

We would

distinguish that situation very clearly from the situation
where a woman is pregnant, and the question Mr. Justice Stevens
brought out, and Mr. Watkins agreed, that when a woman is
pregnant, she requires medical services and the only question
is, are the medical services going to result in termination of
the pregnancy or are they going to be addressed to the woman’s
condition at childbirth?
Again, in terms of that medical necessity thing,
I’ll bring out quickly at this time that we are talking about a
condition that does require medical services and that is
distinguishable, I think, from your situation.
Clearly, if the woman is not pregnant, then we are
not maintaining that the state would have to reimburse for the
abortion services.
QUESTION:

Mr. Crosby, could I just infcerTupt?

I am still troubled by the same problem I think Mr. Justice
Rehnquist was concerned about.

You are arguing about state

interests that are not necessarily served here.

You argue the

fiscal interest and the maternal health interest but neither
of those is an argument made by your opponent and we basically
have a statutory

question and you haven't met any of the seven

points he makes and I assume you are going to meet those rather
than arguing what sounds to me like a constitutional argument.

36

MR. CROSBY:

Two points then, your Honor.

I think

it is very important, given the section of the act that we are
going under to understand that what we submit the state is
putting up a smoke screen, almost, in terms of the language,
"medical necessity," and they cannot — as we argued in the
brief, chat medical necessity in a vacuum is not sufficient
under the act.
That is, normally medical necessity considerations
will further in other interests, such as the fiscal interest»
I can, very quickly at this time, perhaps, diverge
from a normal pattern here and get back and take a quick look
,at some of the considerations that Mr. Watkins raised.
For example, he talked about the illegality of
abortions ir 1965»

I would refer the Court, in terms of

legislative history, to the House Report number 213 of the 89th
Congress, 1965, page 24»

That House Report was talking about

Title XVIII, Medicare, but as many other
nized, the legislative history
collectively

courts have recog­

can fce read somewhat

and there they specifically stated that in terms
-V-

of the extent of services that they intended to include new
services as they were adopted in the future, indicating the
breadth of what Congress intended in 1965.
I would also refer the Court to the drug example of
the lower court when they were talking about the — clearly as
new drugs became marketable — that they could not read the

37
statute as requiring them to be prohibited.
Also, I would suggest that in 1972, not 1965, when
Congress amended the Social Security Act to include family
planninq services, that they were aware at that time that HEW
considered abortion to be part of comprehensive system of family
planninq services there again, so when they were specific,
usinq the term "family planning services” as indication of their
intent to include the abortion and finally * I would refer the
Court to the case of the United^States versus Southeast
Underwriters .Association 322 U.S. 533 where the Court realised
the expansive nature of the Sherman Antitrust Act and that is
exactly what we are saying is involved here in terms of
allowing for new services as they are developed in the future,
meaning, of course, whether or not they are legally developed
in the future or medically developed in the future, as they
become an accepted, legitimate professional service.
QUESTION:

You say “‘allowing," Mr. Crosby when

what you mean, really, is "requiring," isn't it?
MR. CROSBY:

Correct, your Honor.

What Mr. Watkins

raised in terms of the lack of any specific language

in Title

XIX, Respondents would submit that, as we pointed out before,
that the Second Circuit described it as a long and complicated
statute and they really didn't mention any specific service and
there is no reason to have expected them to specifically refer
to abortion services.

38
However, we would also submit that in terms of the
specificity armament that, again, the term "family planning
services," when it was added to the act in 1972, it is narrow
enouqh in terms of what Congress was attempting to accomplish
through family planning services, that is, to permit indigent
women to limit

and/or space their children.

But the very

alternative to the doctors available to meet that purpose for
the woman, the alternatives are so narrow that Congress must
have meant for the states to include all those alternatives,
QUESTION:

Mr. Crosby, let me just — you perhaps

‘si mentioned it in your brief, but I am just trying to be sure I
I understand.
Is it your position that abortion on demand is
jjj
"necessary" within the applicable standard or that the state
'

1 may not impose a standard of necessity?
MR. CROSBY:

The latter.

i

QUESTION:
:j

'

It may not impose a standard.
-

Then, in
■

my example about anesthesia where the patient wants a more
expensive anesthesia than the doctor could in good conscience
say was necessary.

Is she entitled to

MR. CROSBY:

it?

I would submit, your Honor, no.

I

assume that the doctor is making that determination because of
alternative anesthetics available,

what we are saying is

when the doctor and the woman are faced with condition of
pregnancy, they have two alternatives, childbirth services or

39

abortion services and in that context» neither service can be
considered more or less necessary than the other services so
it is distinguishable from a situation where a doctor» for very
obvious reasons, might say something is not medically necessary
and we do admit that the state can consider notions of medical
necessity, again, such as the example we used in our brief which
was the physical examination»
They could say physical examinations the state will
determine are not medically necessary»

Now, some doctors may

disaaree with that but to the extent that they say that and
use that to exclude that service, they are also sayina that the
money that we are going to save by not providing those services
can be addressed to more urgent needs but when the state says
"medical necessity," in terms of the issue before the Court
today, there is no money saving.

There is no one else to be

serving? there is no interest to be furthered when they say
"medical necessity at the time of utilisation of the service."
Turning quickly to the family planning services
argument, again, and trying to be brief, focusing in on the HEW
regulations„

Respondents submit that the regulation contained

i.n 45CFR24910 (AS) , namely, that HEW requires that the services
provided must be sufficient in amount, scope and duration to
reasonably achieve their purpose and what we are saying here, as
2 indicated before is, the purpose, the: specific Congressional
purpose of the family planning services was to limit — to permit

40
the indigent woman to limit or space her children, that that
goal is so narrow that if you eliminate what has been profes­
sionally accepted as a part of a comprehensive system of
family planning services, namely, contraceptive, abortion,
sterilization and treatment for infertility, that the state5s
discretion becomes much more narrow and in fact, they cannot
restrict: services of any of those four major components of a
comprehensive system of family planning services»
Secondly, as to the categorically needy individuals,
we focus on the HEW requirement that the state cannot, arbit­
rarily deny or reduce the amount, scope or duration of a
service because of the type of illness or condition.
What we submit for the categorically needy women
is that to the extent that a woman's previous family planning
services die not work, chat is, a method of contraception failed
and she is now pregnant, she is totally being excluded by the
state's restrictive policy.
And secondly, for those women who never sought
family planrirtg services until they became pregnant, she, too —
we have two

classes of individuals who are totally being

excluded by the state’s policy,
Returning quickly to the medical necessity issue,
our position here is that, again, medical necessity in a
vacuum • •• that is, where the state can't show some other
interest that is going to be furthered is not permitted under

41
the act because the act requires a rational connection between
the exclusion and the furthering of some leqitimate state
purpose.
QUESTION:

Mr. Crosby, are you going to get to the

cosmetic point which they put a lot of reliance on?
MR. CROSBY:

Your Honor, I think the cosmetic

point is disposed of simply by saying that, as Mr. Watkins
indicated, that at the point where a doctor — it is not a
doctor’s decision.

In other words, a doctor dees not address

him or herself to a twisted nose.
Nothing else is going to happen.
continue to have a twisted nose.

The person will

Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. CROSBY:

And you see no connection.
I see the connection to the extent

that they are trying to use that example to limit the abortion
that they will cover under their Medicaid program by saying it

42
has to be necessary at the tine of utilization and this is why
X referred it

earliet as a smokescreen in terms of the require­

ment of medical necessity.
The state has no legitimate reason, especially
given the Court's position in Roe v, Wade, Poe v. Bolton to
assert that an abortion service is any more or lens necessary
or

childbirth services is any more or less necessary than

the other,
QUESTION:

Because once a woman is more or less

pregnant, it is clear that the services of the physician are
going to be medically necessary, either by reason of a mis­
carriage, a live birth or an abortion.
MR„ CROSBY:

Correct, your Honor, and that this

statute has to be interpreted in terms of what the state can do
under the guise of medical necessity with that in mind.
QUESTION:

Does the fact that medical services are

necessary mean that any particular medical service, namely, an
abortion, is in that category?
MR. CROSBY:

Not — depending on how we look at

medical necessity, your Honor.

What we are saying is that at

that point is that it is a particular service, that is, an
alternative treatment for a condition that at point, when the
state begins to draw the guidelines, as they have, that they
are impermissibly interfering with that physician's discretion.
Now, if you are out of the area of where you are

43
talking about your —
QUESTION:

How do they interfere with a physician °s

discussion whan ? as the state has suggested, that if the
physician informs the state that it is medically necessary for
the protection of health or life, that the state doesn't
challenge that»

It is the affirmatae policy of the state to

reimburse for those services»
MR» CROSBY:

I had never heard that before today,

your Honor.
QUESTION:

I think it is the state's program.

MR» CROSBY:

I would point out that many of the

things that we heard today I was hearing for the first time in
terms.of what the state program will cover.

I would submit to

the Court that if the state program was as all-encompassing as
it was presented to the Court today, that I would see no
reason why they had contested the temporary restraining order
in the first instance.
Clearly, there are grave restrictions.

They did

not admit that any of the women, any of the Respondents, were
entitled to an abortion.

They fought reimbursement for the

abortion in every single case.

I would submit in terms of the

issue of necessity as it relates back to the Court’s announce­
ments in Doe v. Bolton that, in fact, under that analysis, the
only abortion services that could be classified as unnecessary
would be those where the woman was not pregnant or where the

44
abortion services were not going to operate to the best in­
terests of the woman, that is, where she perhaps did not consent
or was not aware of what was going on in terms of the medical
services»
QUESTION:

Well, do we have a live case here?

How

about the particular Plaintiff that filed this action in the
district court?
Would they meet the Pennsylvania requirements or
would they not?
MR. CROSBY:

I don't believe they would have, your

»

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, then, I take it the state was

justified on the terms it now argues in contesting the tem­
porary restraining order.
It may not have done it; on those grounds but
certainly it was justified, if its policy would have been — as
now announced •— would have been infringed by the temporary
restraining order.
MR. CROSBY:
QUESTION:

Correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
Are you not arguing that the state is

required to reimburse for every abortion on demand?

Isn't that

what your argument comes down to?
MR. CROSBY:

I don't believe so, your Honor.

Keep

in mind that under the medical assistance program, no one is
guaranteed services.

What we are doing is analysing — in

45
other words, the state doesn't ensure that I» as a potential
recipient, am going to have a doctor.

They can't be sure that

the doctor or doctors in my community are even going to partici­
pate so we are not, in that sense, talking about abortion on
demand.
The final point is that Respondents are still
talking about services performed by physicians to the extent
that —
QUESTION;

Well, let's change the question to

elective abortion, then.
MR. CROSBY;
QUESTION;

Perhaps that is a little less loaded.
Call it elective abortion, your Honor.

Elective- abortions, you say the state

must pay for.
MR. CROSBY;

and any other abortion.

MR. CROSBY:

I could concede,, your Honor, of a

physician where a doctor did not —- excuse me, a patient, where
[patient]
a doctor did not elect to have the abortion but because of very
obvious factors to the doctor, that he would advise the patient
to qo through with an abortion and they can include many, many
factors, as the Court recognised.
It could be that, four years into the future that
the existence of the unwanted child is just going to totally
disrupt the woman's existence so we are still saying that it is
a joint decision.
QUESTION:

Mr. Crosby, you indicate that the

necessity issue should be decided against

a

background of

some state interest supporting necessity.
Would you say that a state interest in saving the
lives of the unborn fetus is totally illegitimate?
MR. CROSBY:

I would submit, your Honor, that

legitimate statutory purposes have to be defined in the context
of the

Constitution.

To the extent that that interest is

unconstitutional -QUESTION:

Well, it is not a compelling interest to

undergo, but is it a totally illegitimate interest that should
be entirely ignored?

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr, Watkins?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN J, WATKINS, ESQ,
MR„ WATKINS:

Three points, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it please the Court:
First, the reason that my brother opponent is
hearing a lot of this for the first time.is, of course, because
he has raised a lot of it for the first time at this late date,
I might point out in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's
question, we, indeed, do have a lot of controversy because
Plaintiffs themselves admitted -- and I am quoting from pages
one and two of my reply brief — "In a stipulation filed with

48

the Court,

*Continuance of the pregnancy did not threaten the

health or life of the mother —’ referring to some of the
Plaintiffs in this case»

So there is no question but that the

Plaintiffs in this case were seeking an elective, non-medically
necessary abortion, however that term is defined.
Obviously, these stipulations were of Plaintiffs'
counsel.

There can be no question at this point that we have

a live controversy.
Secondly, counsel asserts that the family planning
services requirement of Title XIX is broad enough to cover
abortions.

It may well be.

The question is not whether it is

broad enough to cover abortions.

The question is, does it

mandate abortions?
In fact, I would inform the Court that HEW •— which
by the way, has taken a position supporting the Commonwealth to
the Solicitor General in this case -- HEW will not reimburse
abortions as a family planning device — logically, because the
reimbursement rate is quite higher, 90 percent for a family
planning device and it is substantially lower in the other
portions of the act.
Respondents are arguing that pregnancy requires
medical services’*and I quote my opponent, and the only question
is whether or not the pregnancy is going to be terminated.
That is not the only question.

The question is

whether or not the services are sought by the physician or

49

sought by the patient, whether or not they are elective or
whether or not they are medically required.
If they are the latter, we pay.
If they are the former, we don't and this is
consistent throughout the entire program with the exception of
family planning, which is by definition a preventive medical
care program.
QUESTION:

It would be awful hard for a physician

to operate on anybody if he didn't come to him.
MR. WATKINS:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Marshall.

So I don't understand your point.

MR. WATKINS:

The point is that a pregnant woman

going to a physician for examination of pregnancy, she has the
option, clearly, to say, "I want to terminate this pregnancy.”
QUESTION:

Or, to go throvigh to childbirth.

MR. WATKINS:

Or to go through the childbirth.

But

the physician —■
QUESTION:

That is also medical.

MR, WATKINS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is why she went to the physician.

MR. WATKINS:

That is correct.

But the physician,

under Pennsylvania’s Medicaid program, has the option of
choosing all the pregnancy-related services

that he, in his

medical judgment, determine are necessary for the preservation
of that woman’s health.

In this case, the physicians and the Plaintiffs by
their own admission did not need an abortion for the preserva­
tion of their health.
QUESTION;

Mr. Watkins, how do you respond to his

argument that the whole purpose of the medical necessity require­
ment is fiscal and that in order to avoid the unnecessary
expenditure of funds and that here, the abortion would be the
less-expensive of the alternatives?
MR. WATKINS:

Well, first I would say that we are

bound by the equality requirements that I mentioned at the out­
set of my argument and that if we made an exception in the
abortion case because abortion happened to be cheaper than fullterm delivery services, that we would probably be violating
those very provisions of the act.
We must have a consistent program and consistency
in this case is medical necessity.
QUESTION:

Mr. Watkins, let me ask you one other

question about the liveness of the controversy.

The stipulation

you referred to certainly shows you have a controversy between
the lawyers on both sides.
I still have a reservation in my mind as to whether
you have a controversy between the clients.

Did you try this

case in the district court?
MR. WATKINS:

No, I did not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

However, the Plaintiffs in this case filed affidavits of their

51
own in which they -- at least in — and I point out in a foot­
note in my brief, my main one — at least two of them affirma­
tively stated that they did not seek abortions for health
reasons»
QUESTION:

Well, why would a plaintiff who wanted

to obtain an abortion funded with federal and state funds
affirmatively state that she couldn't meet one of the qualifi­
cations?
MR. WATKINS:

I can only assume — one, I assume it

was true and two, I assume that
QUESTION:

She wanted to test --

MR, WATKINS:

She wanted to test the statutory and

the constitutional fabric of her contention»

But first and

foremost I submit, and I certainly hope it was true..
QUESTION:

Perhaps it might be more accurate to

say that she didn't give the legal questions any thought one
way or the other, but that her attorneys did,
MR, WATKINS:

That, I couldn't say, your Honor.

That I couldn’t say.

All we can do is deal with the

facts as they are put before us and here the facts are very
clear.

Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:37 o'clock am., the case was
submitted„j
