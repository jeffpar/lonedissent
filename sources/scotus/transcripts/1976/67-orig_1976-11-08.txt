HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'll hear arguments

first this morning in Ho. 67, Original, the Gtrte of Idaho
and others against the States of Oregon and. Washington.
Mr. Attorney General, vou ruiv proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGIETHTIT OF WAVWE L. KIDWELL, EGO.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PLATOWIFF
MR. KI DWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and nav it please

the Court:
Attorney General Gorton, Attorney General Johnson,
gentlemen:
We're asking this Court to grant our motion for
leave to file our complaint under the provision of the
Constitution granting original iurisdiction, because we
are facing what vre consider in the Horthwest a problem of
monumental importance, of nationwide importance.
We're talking about the anadromous fish runs, the
anadromous fish, a migratory fish that is born in fresh
i

water, eventually makes it way to the sea, living from one
to four years in the sea, and then, if possible, returns to
the place of its birth to spawn.
The problem is, that the nine hundred miles that
hese fish may travel has many hazards.

We re coemisse there

are other hazards than we're going to address ourselves to
here today.

Obviously, we have dams — there are eiaht of

4
them over the part of the Columbia River basin that we’re
talking about today.

They certainly take their toll.

The

nitrogen supersaturation, the slack water, the pollution,
and there are some other factor's: heavy sports fishing and
commercial fishing.
The problem is that the anadromous fish, after
they

leave the ocean, go through two states,

half of them spawn in the State of Idaho.

but over

And the anadromous

fish are governed by a compact that was passed by the States
of Oregon and Washington in 1915, ratified by the United
States Concress in 1918, of which only the two states are
members.

Idaho has not had a voice.

It's not because the

State of Idaho has not attempted to have a voice.
As far back as 1937, the United Ftates Fishery
Commission recommended then that Idaho be made a member of
the Columbia River Fish Compact.

Negotiations were started.

They continued for many, many years.

As recently as I960,

the governors of the three states convened a meeting to
discuss the anadromous fish in the Pacific Northwest.

And

the governors of these three states did recommend that
Idaho become a member.
However, nearly forty years now have elapsed since
the compact was first entered into, and Idaho is still not
a member.

The problem is, if Idaho were a member, we feel

that the problem would not be as acute and critical as it

is.

If we're all own d to file our oomolaint, we can show by

competent evidence, and in many instances, the fish runs
themselves have been depleted by as much as 8 0?,.
This anadromous fish cycle is a unique —
QUESTION:

Is there some reason whv membership has

not been achieved?
?"R„ KinUELL:
blame politics.

Your honor, T guess I would have to

Many of the leaders of the

states have expressed their desire and willinemens to have
Idaho made a member, but the state legislatures have never
gotten around to admitting the State of Idaho.
OUEETIOTI:

Mr. Attorney General, if you are admitted ,

is that the- end of your problem?
MR. KIDTTELL:

Mo, sir, it is not.

If we are admitted

to the Columbia River Fish Compact., that's only step one.
There would he three states, then.

If we were given an

equal voice, the problem would arise that Idaho would have
interests that are somewhat different than Oregon and Wash­
ington, and there is certainlv the dancer of our

being

out-voted two to one, and we would maintain the status quo,
and nothing would change.
to we are asking this Court to grant us admission
to the Columbia River Fish Compact.
OUESTIOTT:

Mow, I recognize —

What authority do you have, Attorney

General Kidwell, for this Court's power to grant you what you

fi

want?
MR. KIDT-TRLL:

Justice Rehnquist, T was qoinq to

point out that I recognize that there has been no case, at
least that we have been able to find, whereby this Court
could say directly that we would be entitled to become a
member.
However, there is considerable authority, your honor,
that this Court is the final say so on the validity and
operation and fairness of interstate compacts.

Ho we

would urge either that this Court take the unprecedented
step of saying that Idaho should be a member, or achieve the
same result by saying that those portions of the Compact
that deny Idaho its fair share, itsapportionment, of the
anadronous fish be declared invalid so far as the operation
of the Compact is concerned.
QUHSTIOH:

What authority do you rely on for this

Court's power to review what you call the fairness of a compact
that has been entered into by the two states and

iratified

by Congress?
MR. KIDWELL:

Your honor, probably the most clear

expression by this Court would be a fairly recent case,
Mobraska v. Iowa at 406 U.S., your honor, where the Court
then was not reviewing a fish compact, but it was a compact
between two states concerning itself with the river
boundary between the two states.

7
QUESTION:

And had that been ratified by Congress,

that compact?
HR. KIDT7ELL:
QUESTIOH:

Yes, your honor, it had been.

You're asserting right now no more right

than you would assert if there had been no contract at all,
namely, you suggest that this Court apportion the anadromous
fish in the river among the states, just as though we were
#222

operating on a stream.
MR. KIDMELL:

That's essentially correct, your

honor.
QUESTION:

And if you're right, if you’re entitled

to a portion of those fish runs, if Idaho is, an agreement
between two other states isn't about to deprive you of it.
That's your position, isn't it?
MR. KIDHELL;

Yes, your honor.

The problem is

that the fish, when they’re attempting to return to Idaho
to spawn, are taken fromthe Columbia River through many
other factors.

Rut commercial fishing is one way that we 'feel

if Idaho were in that we could attempt to cut back.

■■''hat

we're asking for is, one, to become a member of the Compact,
and secondly, for this Court to apply — for want of a better
word I'll call it equitable apportionment — reconnizing
that this Court has applied that in water cases, and
applying it. to -fJEETIOII:

MR. KIDWELL:

a compact could be construed by this Court.
MR. K IDT JELL :

That's all.

Is that it?

But how can tha —

that requires, I thought, the voluntary consent of the states
and the approval by the Congress.
MR. KIDWELL:

Justice Brennan, the reason I cited

Nebraska v. Iowa is only to point out that this Court has
said that they are the final arbiter, that you are QUESTION: As to the meaning of a compact.
MR. KIDWELL:

As to the meaning of a compact.

And

if this compact, if it were determined by the proof, that the
compact itself was depriving Idaho of substantive rights in
this natural resource, then the Court could declare it invalid

insofar as it takes these rights from the State of Idaho.
QUESTION:

anything more than a declaration of — if you haveit — a
declaration of your rights to this fish run.
MR. KIDWELL:
QUESTION:

MR. KIDWELL:

That's

correct.
QUESTION:

Is there in the *— anywhere that xtfould

prevent you now, the State of Idaho, frombringing an oriqinal
jurisdiction suit against the other states.

Does the

compact bar you?
MR. KIDWELL:
bar us.

No, your honor,

The compact does not

And at this point we felt that the most

appropriate remedy

and after much discussion —would be to

come to this Court with this type of original jurisdiction
case.
QUESTION:

What if Congress does not approve it?

Where would you be?
MR. KIDT7ELL:

Your honor, there's always that hazard

We do feel, however, that II.R. 200, which was passed by che
Congress, which regulated the fishing three miles out out to
two hundred miles out, specifically recognized the state of
Idaho as having a voice.

And the Congressional discussion

then concerning anadromous fish indicated that if there
were the question of ratification up now of the

original

compact, that it’s very likely they would not approve it with
out Idaho being made a member, because of the danger of the
extinction of these fish, of the anadromous fish themselves.
QUESTION:

Now the — Solicitor General has

10
represented that the State of Oregon has agreed to your
joining the compact, and that the State of Washington was
on its way to agreeing to it, one of its houses having enacted
the necessary legislation, or passed the necessary resolutions,
and then the term of the legislature ended.

But that there’s

every possibility that the State of Washington will do so
early next year.

Is that — do you agree with

that?

As a matter of fact?
MR. KIDWELL:

Justice Stewart,.if, in fact, thd

problem would become moot sometime in the future, Idaho
would be first in line to ask to dismiss this case.
we've been looking at it for forty years.

But

rr'he State of

Oregon, finally, through their legislature, did pass a version
of a compact after we had filed this motion for leave to
file our complaint .

And even with this pending, the State

of Washington was not able to pass both houses — the compact
itself.
So if both states would admit Idaho as a voting member
of the compact, and if there were some way that the Compact
would give Idaho a say so in the anadromoiiB r ms, or in the
fish that are produced in our state, then the problem could,
become moot.
But the argument now has been going on in this
view, your honor, for about forty years, and. nothing has happene
QUESTION:

Well, something has happened recently.

11
Oregon has acted, and one house of the Washington legislature
has acted.

And it's represented that there's every prospect

that both houses of the Washington legislature will act soon
after it convenes in January — next January.
MR. KIDV7ELL:
problem however.

Your honor, there' s an additional

The compact, as passed by the State of

Oregon, is not in the same form as proposed by the State
of Washington, and would purport to regulate all fishing even
on the headwaters in streams

in the State of Idaho.

My

point being, is, that even now there is no agreement between
the two states as to what form a new compact should state —
should take.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, what has prompted this

activity finally in Oregon and Washington?

The filinc? of

this complaint?
MR. KIDWELL:

Your honor, I think it would be unfair

to completely characterize it as that.

But from my standpoint

there was no compact passed by the legislature until after
we had filed this motion, and after about forty years of
discussion.

It's almost ten years since the governors of the

three states themselves agreed that Idaho jSiould be made a
member of this before anything has happened.
QUESTION:

Attorney General Kidwell, as I understand

it, you want two things.

You want Idaho to be written in

as a member of the compact, and

to rewrite the compact.

12

And I assrne f to ccmpal Congress to approve it.

You want

to do that too?

problem.

That’s my

You say, this Court can compel a state, a sovereign

state, to make a compact with you.
MR. KIDWELL:

Your honor, that’s — Justice Marshall,

that’s why I pointed out that I believed that this Court
could achieve that by invalidating that portion of the
Columbia River compact that would deny Idaho its say so and —
QUESTION:

just have some type of action which would say that these
two states cannot interfere with Idaho's fish*

QUESTion:

May I ask one more question about the

first part of the case, the compact part?

Is there any

assurance that if Oregon and Washington both pass
legislation inviting you in, that you'll necessarily go in?
Maybe the terms are not acceptable to you.

I take it there's

a variety of forms the compact would take.
MR. KIDWELL:

That's why the second

Idaho would be guaranteed a right to its share of the
anadromous fish, that they would not interfere with the
share of the fish, this, in effect, would

w?e'd feel —

forcethe three states to sit down and agree.
QUEST TO’!:

Well, just to dispose of the first part

of your case in my own mind if I may, first.

TVm I correct

in concluding, you're not merely asking to be let in, but
you're asking to be let in on the terms that you would
specify?
MR. KIDWELL:

four honor, I think that would be

putting it a little harsher than we would like to have it
recognized.

We're asking to have asay so in the anadromcus

fish runs, over 50% of which originate in the State of
Idaho.
QUESTIOTT:

Me, but you have to decide what kind of

say so, wouldn't you, in order to formulate a meaningful
decree on the contract issue?
MR, KIDWELL:

Your honor., wa feel that if there was

an order entered that Idaho was entitled to its share of the
fish, that this would then force the states to agree.
QUESTION:

Well, you're in effect saying all you

need is a second branch of your argument.
MR. KIDWELL:

Your honor, I'm saying if the second

part of our argument were granted, if that relie fwere
granted, it would take care of the first.
QUESTION:

And the first

p?'rt can't really do

anything all by itself anyway without this Court, in effect,
writing the compact for the three states.
MR. KIDWELL:

Your honor, we feel that if even

we had a voice or a say so in the compact, the first part,
which would not give us our total relief, even having a say
so as one third of the compact would be more than we've had
for the last forty years.

The second part is the essential

part to what we're asking this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, I would suggest

you get to the second part.

And let's hope we don't question

you further on the first.
MR. KIDWELL:
QUESTION:
before you move on

Thank you, your honor.

Mr. Kidwell, may I ask you a question

15

If, for example, we agreed with your basic proposition
that Idaho is entitled to an equitable share, how would you
determine that share, and if you determined it in some
mathematical way, how would you get the fish to Idaho?
MR. KIDWELL:
QUESTION:

Your honor, it is —

In the face of the eight dams.

MR. KXDWELL:

Your honor, it is capable of determining

the amount of fish that are going into the headwaters with
almost mathematical precision.

OUr fish and game department

is prepared to show, as I say, with mathematical precision,
theamount of fish that should be allowed to escape -- the
figuras they use — into the state of Idaho.
these dams, there’s a counting process.

Over eachi of

One of these dams

on the Columbia River — the last dam before the fish go
into Idaho is lea Harbor Dam.

And the count going over

there, at this point, is so low that, it can be determined
with precision how much, or what efforts should be made down
below to allow more escapement.
There are a couple of other factors that I want —
QUESTION:

By the limitation of both sport fishing

and commercial fishing?
MR. KIDWELL:

The other problems you

mentioned at the beginning of your argument cannot really
be overcome.

MR. KI DWELL:

Yes, your, honor.

We do feel that if

Idaho had a say so in the compact, that additional efforts
could ba made in putting what they call certain types of
lips on the dams to stop the supersaturation, the turbine
damage, and some of those things.

QUESTION:

What are we, are we talking about

in nature, these fish returning to where they spawn.

MR. KIDWELL:

Your honor, the Chinook salmon

The Steelhead theoretically can go

back to the ocean.

Figures and statistics of how many

make it back are rather slight.

But they do not automatically

die.

They attempt to.
A couple of other points that I was going to bring

out.

Idaho, along with the other states, has attempted to

minimize the impact of the loss of our anadromous fish by
artxfiea! spawning, planting of these fish.
I would point out, one problem that we have con­
tinually run into is that Idaho being a very small state we
spend well over a million dollars a year in these efforts.
But all of the fish that we transplant or artificially spawn
in the State of Idaho, then to go to the ocean and come back,
of course a portion of them £ire taken by the States of Oregon
and Washington.
Oregon and Washington also spend considerable sums
of money, but we do not have the same benefit from the money
they spend, because the fish return to where they're put into
the water, and do not pass through the state of Idaho.
QUESTION:

Is there any fishing — legal fishing —

The equitable apportionment argument, T feel,
although I can't cite this Court any actual case riaht in
point, I feel that the water cases are analgous, the pol­
lution casesj certainly this Court has demonstrated many
times that under the right factual situation it can stop
pollution above a state. If we can stop a state from nutting
something into the water before the water gets there, certainly
it would seem obvious that the Court would have the sane
jurisdiction to stop them from taking something out of the
water that was unique and a part of the natural ecological
cycle.
I think it's also important to mention the reason we
need this Court to invoke its original and exclusive juris-

diction.

This is the only form that we have.

As the Court

is well aware under 'f’itle 28 of the United States Code,
Section 1251(a)(1), on this type of dispute, between the
two states — and I would emphasize there is no reason for
the United States to be a party to this,
with the Indian rights.

"here is no problem

We recognize that they have certain

treaty-guaranteed rights. It's been adjudicated rather fullv.
This would not diminish or interfere with the treaty rights,
or the rights that the Indians have been granted under
existing case law.
Wa have no other place to go.

We have attempted

diplomacy, as this Court has nointed out in controversies
of this kind.

As the Court has said many times, there are

three ways to settle disputes of this nature: diplomacy, war
or by coming to this Court.

QUESTION:
Kidwell»

I put a question to you first, General

Was there any barrier to your bringing a

traditional, original jurisdiction case, making a claim
that you would with reference to pollution of the stream
or whatever, which is really what you have embraced within
paragraph number.2 of your prayer for relief, I would take
it?

Is that not so?
UR. KIDWELL:
QUESTION:

Yes, your honor, although —

That ignores — if you had asked for

that relief alone, would the existence of the compact be
a barrier to the Qourt's granting that relief alone?
HR. KIDWELL:

Your honor, the comraact would rear

its head in that, and would be headlong in conflict with
our asking for this

remedy.

Therefore it was my decision

early — maybe erroneously — to ask that this Court give
us a say so in the compact, because of the forty year
history that we have —
QUESTION:

Nell, if you — I don’t understand why

you think that if Idaho has the right you claim, that an
agreement between two other states can really eliminate
it.

I don't understand that.
HR. KIDWELL: I do not feel it can.

And that is

the equitable apportionment -—
OUESTION:

Well, then, why do you need any remedy

against the compact?
MR. KIDWELL:

I mean, as such?
Your honor, we do not, oer se, have

to have the remedy of the compact.

Since the comnact has

existed sines the turn of the century, since the early days
of statehood, we did feel that if the Court would grant that
order, it would minimize the difficulty of relations with the
other states.

Rut the significant remedy is the equitable

apportionment part of our complaint.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

General Johnson.
ORAL ARGiriENT OF LEE JOHNSON, ESO. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS.
MR. JOHNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think, very simply, the State of Oregon’s

25

position in this case is that the complaint,, or the motion
to file a complaint, should be dismissed because the cosplaint fails to state any claim upon which leqal relief can
be granted.
In other words, it fails to state a justiciable
controversy.
QUESTION:

What if the State of Idaho had come in

to pursue the question I just put to your friend, and asked
for nothing except essentially what they pray for in paragraph
21

And do you think the compact bars this Court's jurisdiction

to grant relief in that limited area?
MR. JOHNSON:

No, I do not.

But I think that is

definitely not what the State of Idaho is requesting.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't it true that sometimes

when people ask for 5 or 7 paragraphs of relief, the Court
grants one or two?
MR. JOHNSON:

No, I — well, my point is, Mr. Chief

Justice,is that is not what the State of Idaho is asking,
Indeed, that is the last thing the State of Idaho wants.
I think maybe I can

explain this.

And simply first maybe

describing the regulatory scheme that exists in Oregon and
Washington, and pointing out that what Idaho wants — it
doesn't want to strike down that regulatory scheme.

They

just don't like the way we're doing it.
That regulatory scheme is a —- provides,

both

And

26

states have similar statutes, provides for a regulatory
I

commission.

The commission sets the time of fishing, sets

the manner of fishing, and sets the place of fishing.

The

commission — and this is strictly in the area of commercial
fishing that we're talking about today, according to Idaho's
complaint„
New, the Commission --- one, there is an established
area for commercial fishing.

It is from the mouth of the

Columbia Fiver up to approximately 140 miles just short
of Bonneville Dam, which is the first major dam on the
Columbia.
The fishing days, or the season, is open on the
basis of an escapement level.

That is the rationale or

the terminology that is used in this regulatory scheme.
And the escapement level, basically, is to get enough fish
over this commercial fishing area — and understand there
is a second commercial fishery above Bonneville, which is
the Indian commercial fishery regulated by the treaties.
There is, of course, a game fishery that goes all the way
through Oregon and Washington, and on into Idaho.
#588

The

escapement level is, prime most; to try to use the existing
spawning bed, to fully utilise those existing spawning beds
that exist throughout the Columbia and its tributaries,
both in Oregon, Washington and Idaho.

There is a limitation

on those spawning beds, because of the industrialization that

27
has occurred.
the run.

But it is to utilise those beds, to preserve

And once that escapement — and it is estimated

by taking the number of fish that come, and also they have to
allow for how many fish are going to be taken by the Indians,
and how many are going to be taken by game fishermen in all
three statas and stiliget the proper spawning level — once
that escapement is accomplished, then we open that fishing
up for commercial fishing.

The season is open.

And until

that escapement is accomplished, the season is closed»
And what Idaho is contending — and this is one of
things, one of their analogies, one of their arguments; they
rely on the case of Pennsylvania v. Hast Virginia.

But the

whole problem Idaho has in this case is that the only effect
of the State of Oregon and the State of Washington's
regulation has got to be positive as far as the State of
Idaho is concerned, because every day that that fishing is
closed means that fish do get to Idaho.

If the states had

chosen not to regulate it, or if this Court should declare
that statute, for example, as an undue interference with
interstate commerce, Idaho would be left terribly out in the
cold, as well as would our state, because what would happen
would be the destruction of the fishery.
QUESTION:
General.

I'm not sure I follow that, Hr. Attorney

MR» JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

Nell, all right.

Nothing else but that in the case.

MR. JOHNSON:

If you want to go to the equitable

proportionraent argument, I think our answer is — our
question, we still think, is the main issue in this

case,

is that the State of Idaho has got to state some basis on
which — for which they’re going to get equitable relief.
There's got to be some legal basis for it.

represent that they spawn the fish originally.

What

Because this is what Idaho is

As if somebody in Idaho raises a bird, and he

releases that bird out into the sky.

Now, presumably

this bird is a bird that does migrate all over the world.
Does that, mean that this Court is then to order each state
in the United States to adopt regulations to protect that

29
particular bird, because Idaho wants to protect that bird2
QUESTION:

You’re now going to the remedy»

Perhaps

it would be correct that the Court would find what you suggest.
But would the Court have jurisdiction if that was the only
relief sought?
MR.

JOHNSON:

Nell? 1 don’t see how the Court can

take jurisdiction unless there is some legal interest that
Idaho alleges that's being violated.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s one of the questions in the

case.
MR. JOHNSON:

All right.

The only cases that Idaho

cites to support this proposition — Idaho concedes there
is no authority for this whatsoever.

The only cases they

cite for it are those cases in which this Court has exercised
jurisdiction adjudicating water rights between states.

What

That is based upon long-established

common law riparian rights to water.

Everyone of those

cases rests on that common law premises.
QUESTION:

Wall, suppose —

MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

There is no comparable -—- pardon me.

Suppose that the lower states simply

established a barrier in the river and let no fish through
whatsoever into Idaho.

They just — that was just — they

just decided to take them all.

Just announce one day that

we are now taking all the fish, not letting any of them

30

escape into Idaho.

You would have the same answer, that

Idaho would have no remedy, no right, to any of those fish.
MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

No, I would disagree there.

Well, what right would they have?

What

right would they have?
MR. JOHNSON:

On the grounds — on the grounds there -

there, I think, if the state’s regulatory scheme —■ if the
state did nothing, that's another question.

But if the

state’s regulatory scheme — basically, that was the effect
of the State's regulatory scheme, then I think Idaho has a
contention — would have a very legitimate contention —
that the

Where do you find that right?

with interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

Undue interference

But that’s the whole point.

Idaho asserts that the other state is

interfering with interstate commerce in fish?
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes.

If the State of Oregon passed

a law that said that no fish will pass through the State of
Oregon into Idaho, I think that law would be — at least
it certainly is very arguable that that is an undue inter­
ference with interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

Well, in any event, whatever the source

of the right, you would concede Idaho would have a right?
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, premised on the constitution.

But Idaho in this case, on the face of its complaint, cannot
make that contention about the Oregon-Washington regulatory
scheme.

Because the only possible effe ct of that scheme is

to guarantee that fish

do get to Idaho.

It's not enough, they say,

MRo JOHNSON:

Hot enough,

I mean, what Idaho is

asking this Court —- this is the whole point.

Idaho is

asking this Court —-it's not asking this Court for a judicial
decree that our statutory and regulatory scheme is
unconstitutional.

It is asking that you not give judicial

review to that, but that you would administer it.

It's

asking you to become the fish master —QUESTION:

You concedethat Idaho is entitled to

And you just say

you're giving them an equitable portion.

That seems to be
i

what you’re saying here.
MR. JOHNSON:

No.

I think we go back and forth.

I think — there are two arguments by analogy that Idaho
uses.

One is resting on a constitutional argument, a

contention of interstate commerce.

And my point is there,

there is no undue interference with interstate commerce on
the face of it.

The only effect the regulatory scheme can

have is a positive effect on interstate commerce.

It

QUESTION:

Wall, where do you draw, the line?

You've conceded that if you bumped them all off, that this
could not be done.

But if you let one out of ten million

MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

No, I'm not saying that, your honor.

The thing is, as I understand it, Hr.
.

»

Attorney General, that if there ware no compact between
Washington and Oregon, and if indeed the states, eitherin
cooperation with each other, or individually, did nothing,
then no fish would get to Idaho.
MR. JOHNSON:

Right, right.

What he is saying

here — this is the most extraordinary remedy —- what he is
saying, he wants the states — he does not like the way
we regulate.

He doesn't disagree with the theory of our

regulation —
QUESTION:

Because if you had none, no fish would

get up to the state river.
MR. JOHNSON:

And I should also point out one thing,

because this is how they.turn the — when you get to the
question of irreparable

injury — and I know Hr. Gorton

is going to point out this — the regulations, the existing
regulations today, for one thing, they talk about steelhead.
\

The states said, well, Oregon and Washington have prohibited
commercial fishing of steelhead for years.

is strictly a conservation point.

And the reason is,

The runs going to Idaho

are in dangerous shape from a conservation viewpoint.

And

as a consequence, the states have had to regulate them.
So any idea of irreparable injury here is ridiculous,
because the fact is, that for the last two years the States
of Oregon and Washington have not prohibited — or have
not permitted any commercial fishing over those fish.
QUESTION:

If it were physically feasible — and I

have no idea whether it is — could Oregon put

Idaho put nets up at its border and keep all these fish in
Idaho, and never let them get out?
MR. JOHNSON:
QUESTION:

I think they can.

whether they are, in effect, by their state action, unduly
interfering with interstate commerce.

And that would be the

only contention we could lean on.
QUESTION:

You said it would be an interference if

that happened on the upstream side.

Why wouldn't it be on

the downstream side?
MR. JOHNSON:

I do not think that that is stating

a justiciable controversy.

Wall, why is that different than —

supposing that Idaho had no —■ water flows toward the ocean,

And assume Idaho had absolutely no pollution

On water rights, I think there is a

The appropriate place for the State of Oregon to
go to solve that problem, and my point here, the appropriate
place for Idaho, is, one, to try to work out a compact*

And

Idaho — I think this should be made clear to the Court —

ON BEHALF OP THE DEFENDANTS
MR. GORTON:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Chief Justice, you asked the question as to
whether or not absent of attempt to get into the compact,
this Court would have jurisdiction.

My answer to that question

is., that it clearly would.
The question is, whether or not you should exercise
that jurisdiction, given the burden and standards of proof,
for you to take an original jurisdiction case; or

whether

or not there are not ofc'ner forms of governmental entities
which are better able to handle the questions.
Mr. Chief Justice Marshall was entirely correct —
excuse ms, Mr. Justice Marshall — was entirely correct in
saying that the United States is clearly an indispensable
party in this case, not only from the point of view of its
protection of the Indians, but — and not only from the
point of view of the requirement that Congress ratify any
compact — but because there are eight dams on the Columbia

my point to'the Chief Justice is, that I do not believe
that you should exercise your jurisdiction, which is discretional
in any event in a case of this sort.

you that you will be involved in it forever.

with only one tiny aspect of the problem, which also involves
irrigation, use of water which hurts fish, which also

QUESTION:

General Gorton, is that really a basis

on which we can decline an original jurisdiction case, that
it’s going to get us into a morass?
MR. GORTON:

It's a way — it’s one on which you have

historically declined such.

You've said in New York v.

New Jersey that you ware convinced after looking at it that
a problem which was the problem of both of those states
would be solved, in fact, by the work of those two states.

No,

To return to —■ simply to return to the final point
that I was making: in Varment v. New York, this Court refused
to enter a consent decree to which both states agreed, because
it would involve the Court in the continuing supervision over
a matter relating to waters not totally dissimilar to this.
Unlike your cases involving the rivers in the western
part of the country, where you had an order that could be
specifically entered as to how much water had to pass
the border between Colorado and Kansas, for example, after
which state regulation was perfectly appropriate.
In this case, the disputes as to the proper number
of fish to be let go simply for replenishment purposes, as
to a proper division between sportsmen in Idaho and commercial
fishermen in Oregon and Washington, are literally unending.
Every single season is different from every single one of
its predecessors.

In fact, the reason for this lawsuit is

that we are in a period of very low runs which coincide
with the runs which could not get over the newest of these
dams.

Several of these dams have bean completed just

xn the. last three or four years.

And they have simply

48
decimated the Idaho fish runs going down , at the point where
they're not fished by anyone at all.
And so.- consequently, in these years they are not
able to come back up.

And this has created a problem for

the State of Idaho which it did not envisage when it refused
to fight against the dams, or fight for better escapement
over those dams.

And we end up being victimized.

QUESTION:

They decimated the smolts going out to

sea?
MR. GORTON:

Ninety five percent of the 1973

smolts going downstream were killed by the dams.
QUESTION:

And this is whatf in your view, in your

submission,- basically accounted for the gross deterioration
of the fishery in 1973?
MR. GORTON:

Exactly.

And why we

were unable —•

and why had simply to ban any commercial or recreational
fishing at all on fish going to Idaho.

Because we agree

with them that too few fish are going back there for any one
