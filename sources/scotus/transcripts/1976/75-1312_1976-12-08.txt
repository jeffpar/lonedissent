MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We5il hear arguments

first tliis morning in Williams Company against the Commissioneir
of Internal Revenue, Mo. 1312»
Mr. Schrager, you nay proceed whenever you5re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN L. SCHRAGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHRAGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
My name is Marvin L. Schrager, and this is Durward J.
/

Long, co-counsel for the Don'

E. Williams Company.

The Don R. Williams Company is located in Moline,
Illinois, and engages in the sale of small tools.

The

corporation maintains its books on an accrual basis method of
accounting, and also has an employees' profit-sharing plan for
the benefit of its company employees.
The company has a fiscal year ending April 30th, and,
according to the accrual method of accounting, must file its
tax return on or before July 15th of each year.
For the years April 30 th, 196 7, 9 68 and '69, the
board of directors of the corporation, before the end of 'the
year, accrued a liability for the employees9 profit-sharing
plan.

Subsequent to the end of the corporation fiscal year,

but prior to the time for the filing of the tax return, the
company transferred to the trustees of the profit-sharing plan

4
a secured demand interest-bearing note of the corporation,
guaranteed by the president* vice president and treasurer of
the company»
It has been stipulated that the value of the collateral
and net worth of one of the guarantors exceeded the value of
the note* which was the amount of the claimed deduction»
QUESTION:

Mr» Schrager* am I correct in my impres­

sion* -the not© actually was paid within tan or eleven months
later?
MR» SCI I PAGER;

Yes* sir»

QUESTION; Was there a -- perhaps you will cover it as
you go along? was there a business reason for the deferral of
actual payment when it followed so closely upon the issuance
of the note?
MR» SCIIRAGER: Well* I think the note was paid within
approximately* as you say* ten or eleven months* and at that
time there were several reasons* one of which was that the
company was an expanding company and its capital intents* and
needs a lot of inventory* and also they felt that the company
was a good place to invest the money and could pay as good a
return as they would be getting in investing the stocks or
some other investment.
QUESTION;

I talc© it that, on the Commissioner’s

computations anyway* the deduction was allowed for the year in
which payment was made?

5
MR. SCHRAGERs

That; is correct.

QUESTION: So that we come down really to which year
that you end up getting your deduction?
MR. SCHRAGER:

Right. As sat forth in our factual

situation, you will note that the first year is the largest
denial of the deduction, and it becomes correspondingly
less, because he allowed the deduction for the cash that was
paid the following year.
QUESTION: And did they in fact invest in — what —
Treasury bills or something?

Didn’t you indicate one reason

was because of better return than other investments?
MR. SCIIRAGERs Well, the corporation paid interest tc
■the profit-sharing plan, and they felt, in the years in
question, this would be as good a return as they would get
by investing elsewhere.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, upon
examination, disallowed the claimed deduction, contending that
the transfer of the note in satisfaction of the accrued
liability did not constitute payment under Section 404 (a) of
the Internal Revenue Cede.
After the denial, the petitioner filed a case in the
Tax Court, and after all of the facts were stipulated to,
arguments and briefs submitted, -the Tax Court, as it has
consistently done, reaffirmed the Commissioner and denied the
deduction.

6

An appeal was then taken to the U, S. Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit# and# after arguments# the
Court of Appeals held for the Commissioner.

But# by doing

so# they declined to follow decisions of the Third# Ninth and
Tenth Circuits# which had previously held that the transfer of
a note by an accrual basis taxpayer did constitute payment
under Section 404(a) of the Internal Revenue Code if the
transfer was made and the delivery was mad© within two and a
half months after the close of the taxpayer’s fiscal year»
•This created a split in the Circuits# and we filed
a petition for a writ of certiorari# which was granted by this
Court? and that's the basic issue,
The issue before fh@ Court is whether or not# as I
have stated# the transfer — the delivery of a note by an
accrual basis taxpayer constitutes payment of an accrued
liability to a profit-sharing plan# if made within two and a
half months after fell© close of the taxpayer’s fiscal year,
QUESTION:

Is this an interest-bearing note# did

you say?
MR, SCHRAGER:
QUESTION;

It was,

MR, SCHRAGER:
QUESTION:

Yes# Your Honor,

It was an interest-bearing note,

At what rata?

MR, SCHRAGER:

Different rates that corresponded to

the rates that ware being charged by banks in our local

7
community.

And the rates would differ from the larger money

centers? they don't fluctuate quite as much in our area.
In dealing with the issue? I believe that we have to
talk about three sections of the Internal Revenue Cod®.
First? Section 162 ? which provides for the deductior,
of ordinary and necessary business expenses? which are paid or
incurred by the taxpayer.
We also must deal with Section 267? which refers to
deductions which are allowed when paid? and Section 267 deals
with related taxpayers.
We also are dealing with Section 404? which deals
with contributions to an employee's pension or profit-sharing
plan? and which also contains the language that the deduction
is allowed when paid.
The reason that we have to take into consideration
these -three sections is that? were it not for the express
establishment of these sections? the deduction would have been,
allowable under Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code.
We maintain that contributions to an employees* pension or
profit-sharing plan are considered as additional employee
compensation and would b© covered under 162? were it not for
Section 404.
Now? prior to the Court of Appeals decision below?
twenty years of case lav; have treated Section 404 and Section
267 and their predecessors? which 23Cp) is the predecessor to

8

and Section 24(c) is the predecessor to Section

Section 404
267 „

k
7md case lav; has treated them synonymously,

And we

feel that this is important in following the evolution of the
point where we are today»
Petitioner maintains that, first, Section 267 was
established by Congress, and then Section 404 was established
by Congress, to stop tax avoidance and to close a tax loophole
that existed under the Internal Revenue Cod® for the following
reasons
Suppose that I am the president and stockholder of
a closed corporation? the corporation is on a fiscal-year and
on an accrual basis method of accounting»
would be on a cash basis»

I, as the president.,

Under Section 162» the corpora­

tion could have accrued a liability to me, say I got a salary
and a bonus, they could have paid me the salary and accrued
the bonus, but never paid it»
entitled to a deduction,

And therefore they would be

I, as a cash-basis taxpayer, not

having received the money, would not have to report that on
my income tax return until the year that it was paid.
If I never took the money out of the corporation,
I would never have to show it.

They would just keep it as an

accrued liability, but would have taken the deduction,
QUESTION: But isn't this the natural state of
affairs in the overlapping of a cash basis and an accrual basis

s
taxpayer?
MR® SCKRAGER;
QUESTIONi

It would --

It isn't peculiar to this pension

plan

kind of thing# is it?
MR„ SCHRhGERs

It was# Justice Blackmun# until such

time as Section 267 was established# at which time they stated
that certain related taxpayers# if you accrued it# it must
foe paid within two and a half months after the end of the year?
and I must take it into income at that time.
If you were an independent creditor of the company
or a non-owner employee# they could have accrued the liability#
taken the deduction# but you would not have to report it until
received»

But I, as a related taxpayer — and that's what

w©5re talking about —• must show it in income within two and a
half months after the end of the year# it must be paid "within
that time»
This was the reason that 267# we feel# was enacted by
Congress# to close that tax loophole between

related tax­

payers o
Subsequently# we feel that Section 404 was also
enacted to do the same thing with employee profit-sharing
■plans» Me feel that Congress felt that because of -the possible
closeness and relations!,ip between the owner and maybe the
trustees of the plan# that they felt that something must be
paid within two and a half months# that you must transfer#

10
something of value must ba transferred and delivered to the
trustees of the profit-sharing plan.
QUESTION: The profit-sharing plan is not a taxpayer,
though, is it?
MR. SCIIRAGERs
grace of Congress.

It is not a taxpayer because of the

However, —

QUESTION: So the reason that you explained was
behind the enactment of 267 is it does not exist here?
MR. SCIIRAGERs

Vie feel it is, Your Honor, because

it’s quite conceivable that I, as an owner of a corporation,
could have accrued a liability to the employees5 profitsharing plan. But if I never paid it, but took the deduction,
when the employees went, to retire, there may be nothing in
there but just an accrual on the books of the corporation.
And prior to the enactment of ERISA, many corpora­
tions, small corporations, the shareholder was -the sole trustee
of the plan. And I -think that there was this type of related
taxpayer basis between the owner and the corporation that they
were trying to stop potential misdealings, and they wanted
something actually delivered to the trustees of the plan.
So that an employee, in seeing the plan, could know that
something was there.
And also, under the Internal Revenue Code, the
corporate — the trustees of the plan are

obligated to file

annual reports showing the assets of -the plan.

11
In this area there has been much litigation, and the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, star-ting with Section
26 7 and following through with Section 404, has always main­
tained, in the beginning, that "paid" meant paid in cash.
You had to liquidate the obligation in cash.
QUESTION: Well, it could be in other tangible
property, too, couldn't it?
MR. SCI!RACER;

Their wording was '’cash" or "cash

value".
In 1943, the case of Musselman Hub-Brake Company vs.
Commissioner dealt with an accrual basis corporation owing
its controlling stockholder a debt for royalties and. interest
which were accrued at the end of the year, and notes were
transferred within two and a half months after the end of
each year.
The corporation took a deduction, and the Commissioner
disallowed it, stating that notes paid, "notes'” did not
constitute payment under ~ and that was Section 24(c) , which
was the predecessor to Section 267,in that case.
The Tax Court affirmed, and the Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit overturned, and ruled that "paid" included
the transfer of a note, the delivery of a note; that a note
constituted payment under Section 24(c)

for an accrual basis

taxpayer.
In that case they talked about the things which I

12

have talked about today* the tax avoidance and the history of
why they wanted to establish this section.

And they also*

in addition* stated that were it not for 24(c) this would
have been deductible under 24(a).
In holding for the taxpayer* flusselman Hub™Brake
Company* the Court explicitly rejected the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue Service’s position that accrual basis and
cash basis taxpayers were on equal footing under Section 24(c).
And this is one of the main themes of our argument* that there
is a difference between a cash basis taxpayer and an accrual
basis taxpayer.

They are not on equal footing* and they are

not so treated by the Internal Revenue Code.
In fch© flusselman case* they rejected the argument*
refused to follow the cases of Eckert v. Burnet and Helvering
vs„ Prics* which is the basis for the Commissioner’s argument
in those cases and also in the case before you today.
FoXloxtfing the Musselman Hub-Brake Company case* the
Court* in Anthony P. Miller vs. Commissioner* which is a case
following the example that I gave to you before* held that a
corporation which transferred notes to its president within
two and a half months after the close of the fiscal year of
the corporation* constituted payment under Section 24(c) which
is th© predecessor to Section 267.
They felt that the delivery of the not© completed
th© transaction and relationships between the parties changed

13
as of that time.
They also felt# in that case*, that a not© was similar
to a check; and they again rejected the Eckert and the Price
line of cases.
QUESTION;

There’s some dispute in tie briefs f I

gather^ as to what the Uniform Commercial Code provides in
this area.
MR. SCHRAGERs

,

exactly a dispute

Yes. Well; I don’t know if there’s

Your Honor# we maintain --

QUESTION;

I guess the Illinois version of the Code

provides that a note is equivalent to a check? that is your
submission# isn’t it?
MR. SCHRAGERs
QUESTION s

„

Yes Your Honor.

*

But in other States and in the proposed

Uniform Commercial Code# it is not? is that correct?
MR. SCHRAGERs Well# I think ~ I think that we’re
dealing here# first of all# we think that the Uniform Commerc­
ial Code argument is very miniscule.

I think we’re dealing

here with a matter of federal law and the practice ~
QUESTIONS Well. I just wondered if you agreed as to
what the state of the law was.
MR. SCHRAGERs

We maintain that if we’re going to

get into the Uniform Commercial Cade# then the Illinois Code
should be the one 'that’s applicable# and they define both
checks and negotiable notes as negotiable instruments.

And

14

that they both suspend the underlying debt* pro tanto, until
the time of payment.
Finally, after the Musaelman and the Miller cases,
in Revenue Ruling 55-608, the Commissioner acquiesced to the
decisions and the line of reasoning in those cases„ And they
state;

Where a solvent taxpayer on the accrual basis issued

its notes or other evidence of indebtedness, it constituted a
valid deduction,,
We feel that at that point in time the Commissloner,
in not also acquiescing in idle Section 404 line of cases,
created an inconsistent position and a conflict which w® feel
was wrong and untenable. We feel that if it constitutes 0,paid*
under Section 267, to have consistency it should be '’paid"
under Section 404{a), and a taxpayer should know what he’s
dealing with in reading th©

language of the Cod®.

We do not feel that — and we also feel that when
they acquiesced in that Section, in talking about an accrual
basis taxpayer, that they can’t argue that accrual basis means
on© thing under 267, but in Section 404 accrual and cash basis
are identical.

We don’t feel that 'that's a valid argument.

After the decisions and the acquiescence, we then
get into felis
404.

.area of casas dealing specifically with Section

Th® first case to come before the Court of Appeals was

really a consolidation of two cases, th© Sachs case and the
Sl&ymaker Lock Company case.

15
In both of these cases,, the corporation transferred
to the trustees demand notes of 'the corporation, in satisfaction
of its accrued liability to its pension trust»

The Tax Court,

after hearing arguments by both parties, disallowed the
deduction and affirmed the Commissioner’s ruling»
However, the Court of Appeals reversed the decisions
and felt that transfer of the note did constitute payment
within the meaning of Section 23(p) , the predecessor to
Section 404»
They felt
QUESTION; Do you think, Mr» Schragar, and do you care
to comment on the use of the word "paid" only four lines
apart;

"if contributions are paid by an employer" said then

four lines down there is a reference, “or if compensation is
paid”»

Do you think the word "paid" means the same thing

in an operative sense in each of those lines?
MR» SCHRAGER;

I think you’re dealing — one is

paying it in the plan, the other is paying a bonus to
QUESTION;

Paying compensation»

MR» SCHRAGER;
QUESTION;

Paying compensation»

Yes»

MR, SCHRAGER;

I think that, yes, whan they’re

talking about paying compensation to somebody, I think it’s
clear that if I give an employee a note that they must report
it as income, and that’s paid.

16

QUESTIONs Well,, if that's the case, what difference
does it male© whether or not you're an accrual or a cash basis
%

taxpayer?
MR, SCHRAGERs

As the tax

the cash basis taxpayer,

if you are the payor, you are not allowed a deduction under
the Code until you pay in cash*
QUESTIONs

A check is the same, isn't it?

MRo SCHRAGERs
QUESTION s

Right»

You told us that a check and a note are

'the sara-a o
MRo SCHRAGERs

We have not dealt with — and there

have been no cases decided, Your Honor, wherein a cash basis
taxpayer* —
QUESTION?

Has delivered a note,

MR» SCHRAGERs — has delivered a note and taken a
claimed deduction in -this area of cases.
QUESTIONS

Well, as I understand your argument,

the same argument, basically the same argument could be made
in the cas© of a cash basis taxpayer,
MRo SCHRAGERs

Well, maybe it could, we’re not

making that argument, Your Honor, we’re limiting it to ~~
QUESTION:

Because, on the other hand, you do not

claim that a mere accrual is sufficient»
MR, SCHRAGERs
QUESTION;

Do you?

A mere accrual of what?

On the books of your client.

17
MR. SCHRAGERs

A m2 re "accrual of the profit-sharing

contribution?
QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR» SCHRAGERs
QUESTION?

That is corrects

We —

You don't claim that?

MRo SCHRAGERs

No, we feel that ~

QUESTIONs And normally that would be sufficient for
an accrual basis taxpayer»
MR» SCHRAGERs

Under Section 162 deduction, yes, it

would.
QUESTIONS

Than on rule?

MR. SCHRAGERs
QUESTIONS

Right.

But you concede that you must at least

have transferred a note?
V

MR. SCHRAGERs

We concede, yes.

QUESTION? And why should that be, if you are an
accrual basis taxpayer?
MR. SCHRAGERs

Well, we can get into the — we feel

that the word "paid" means delivery of something.
QUESTIONs So —~ to go back to my original question,
couldn't — isn't this same argument applicable in full force
to a cash basis taxpayer?
MR. SCHRAGERs

The Courts, in Eckert and Price have

held ~ of course that was dealing with a bad debt deduction, —
QUESTION:

Yes

18
MR» SCHRAGER;

— but they held in that case, no?

and there has been some — there have been some cash basis
cases,. I think mainly in the gift area, where they have held
that a cash basis taxpayer —» no, I don't know

* I think some

of those are on appeal now? but to date they have never held
that it qualified a cash basis taxpayer to give a note,
but they have for an accrual basis,,
QUESTION:

I'm not saying your argument will

prevail, but your argument didn't prevail in idle Court of
Appeals, either»

For an accrual basis taxpayer»

MR» SCHRAGER:
Your Honor*

In three Courts of Appeals, it did.

In 'three Courts of Appeals, it has prevailed*

And also wgUSSglQMhat under their acquiescence in Section 267,
the Commissioner has acknowledged the difference between cash
and accrual basis taxpayers»
QUESTIONS Well, certainly -there's a difference, but
the basic difference has always been that an accrual basis
taxpayer can accrue a liability- or accrue — or, on the other
side of the ledger, income on his books, and that that's
sufficient»
MR. SCHRAGER: Correct»
QUESTION; With or without payment»
MR. SCHRAGERs

Correct»

QUESTION: But here you concede that an accrual of the
liability to the fund would not b© sufficient to give you a

,

deduction

19

if I understand your argument,
MR. SCHRAGER;
QURSTION :

Yes.

That is ~

That there must be a note# and the re as or

there must be a not® is you concede there must be payment.
And you say the note is equivalent to payment# and that would
be equally true for a cash basis taxpayer# I should think.
MR. SCHRAGER:

Right.

Yes.

There is — there has been some discussion about#
in the regulations# talking about the word# or it was in the
Congressional Report prior to the time that the final draft
of tile section came out# talking about the word "actually
paid”.

And the Commissioner has maintained that "actually”

means paid in cash.
We contend that if the word "actually” has any
significant meaning at all# that it means that you actually
delivered something of value.
QUESTION:

Well# but your basic argument is that

"actually paid” doesn’t add anything to the word "paid”.
MR. SCHRAGER:
QUESTION:

Right.

It's like a sign# whether it says

"no smoking” or "positively no smoking"# it means -the same
thing.
MR. SCHRAGER:
you’ve paid it.
to that.

That's correct.

If you’ve paid it#

And "actually paid" has really no significance

Your Honor, that was a misinterpreta­

attention by counsel»

QUESTION:

MR» SCHRAGER:

No»

That was an error, Your Honor,

in our brief»
QUESTION: Well, I*m not concerned about the error
in the brief, I'm concerned about the ultimate fact»
MR» SCHEAGER;

Right»

QUESTION; The record —- there really is no support
in the record for what I assume to be, must be your ultimate
contention, teat you paid by property having value at least
equal to the obligation?

21

MR® SCHRAGERs

Equal to the obligation, and it was

in on© of the ~~ and this has been decided in, I believe it
was, one of the, either the Sacha or the SI ay mater case, and
in the several cases that follows, they were remanded for a
hearing on th© value of th© notes in those cases. So that is
one of th® points that has been covered, and one of the
arguments that is made by counsel that it places a burden
on the Commissioner to have to make valuations®
We contend that the Internal Revenue

Service is

making valuations every day on corporate stock, on the
valuations of gifts.

In the Colorado Rational Bank case they

transferred real estate and they found a way to value that,
QUESTIONs

No, but thatcs, I suppose, to be opposed

to the notion that you could have avoided the whale problem
by giving them the cash and then letting them come back and
buy a not© from you, which would have been payment, and then
a reinvestment of toe paid funds®
MR® SCHRAGERs

Yes,

QUESTIONS But you say that3s too much trouble®
MR, SCHRAGERs

Well, yes, we feel that they3 re

making it tougher and tougher on the small companies to do this,
and I think after they --* I don’t want to get into philosophy
— but after

they enacted ERISA, which was supposed to solve

all the problems, while it solved many of them because a lot
of the small corporations cancelled their plans®

Three officers of the company, plus

There was an independent trustee.
QUESTION:

But only one?

MR. SCHRAGERs

Only one, yes.

The other cases that supported the petitioner*s
position were the Wasatch Chemical Company case , another case

"payment" does not necessarily mean in cash.
when the not© was delivered.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Schrager.

Mr. Jones.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please idle

Court:
As Mr. Schrager has indicated, -the issue in this
case is whether an accrual basis taxpayer, who delivers its
promissory note to an employees5 profit-sharing trust, is
entitled to a deduction under Section 404 of the Internal
Revenue. Code.

That statutory provision allows for a deduction

for contributions to such trusis in -the year in which such
contributions are paid.

Thus, the narrow issue in this case

is whether the delivery of the note constitutes payment.Consideration of tills issue is assisted by two
limiting propositions, on which there can be little basis for

27

dis agreement.
The first of thass is the normal accrual basis rules
do not apply in determining whether there has been a payment
under Section 404.
And the second , is that under the cash basis method
of accounting, the delivery of a promissory note does not
constitute payment.
These two propositions, taken together, do not
completely dispose of this case, but they do considerably
narrow the range of permissible debate.

I will therefore

briefly explain why these propositions are sound, and then
turn to a discussion of the area of disagreement that remains.
The first proposition, as I have indicated, is that
normal accrual basis rules do not apply in determining whether
a contribution has been paid for purposes of Section 404.
The statute provides, and 1 quote, "a taxpayer on the accrual
basis shall be deemed to have made a payment on the last day
of the year of accrual if the payment is not made" — excusems

C!is made not later than the time, prescribed by law for

filing the return for such year.5’
QUESTIONS

Where do we find the statute in these

papers, in your brief?
MR. JONESs

In the Appendix to our brief, Mr.

Justice Stewart.
QUESTION: Appendix to your brief; thank you.

28
MR* JONES s

Page 33 of our brief.

If accrual basis rules had applied, the deduction
would always have been available for the year of accrual.
No provision, such as the one I have just quoted, would have
been necessary.
But Congress understood 'that such a provision was
necessary to permit an accrual basis taxpayer to take a
deduction for the year of accrual if payment was not in feet
made during that year.
And the provision applies, it should be noted, only
with respect to payments made shortly after the end of the
year, in a two and a half month grace period.
Thus, it*c plain that Congress understood and
intended that the normal accrual basis rules do not apply.
The second proposition is that the issuance and
delivery of a promissory note by a cash basis taxpayer would
not constitute payment.

This Court so held in Eckert v.

Burnet, and Iielvering v. Price, and the lower federal courts
have uniformly followed those decisions.
The rationale of Eckert and Price is straightforward.
A cash basis method of accounting focuses upon movements,
inflows and outflows of cash or its equivalent.

And the giving

of a promissory not© or an I.O.U. does not affect an outflow
of property, an outflow of cash or its equivalent.
QUESTION :

MR. JONES %
QUESTION?

Yes. Basically, Eckert and Price —
There can be bad checks just as there

can be bad notes.
MR. JONESg

That's true, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Basically, Eckert and Price rejected the argument
that checks ar© to be treated — that notes are to be treated
as equivalents to checks.

The reasoning, it seems to me, is

that as a practical accommodation to the everyday business
realities of — everyday realities of business life, -the
payment of a check is considered to be equivalent to the
payment of cash.

And it has long been for tax purposes.

QUESTIONs

Well, I know it is, but that is to beg

the question.
MR. JONES %
QUESTIONs
MR. JONES;
Stewart.

Well, it's -It's a sight draft is what it is.
That's ray first step, Mr. Justice

It's — a check is an order to a payment — excuse me

-- an order to a bank to make immediate payment —
QUESTION:

To pay to -the order of the endorser of

30
th© —
MR. JONES:

That’s right.

It's an order directing

a bank to make immediate payment.
A note is not like that at all.

When a maker issues

a note, the maker himself, or itself, still has something left,
to do before the basic obligation is going to be satisfied,
Th© maker himself must pay the note.
QUESTION :

Mr. JOnes , I thought the
truth of the
r

matter with feh@ check is that the bank is ordered to pay the
money if there’s anything in there, in that account.
MR. JONESs

Well, that’s true, Mr. Justice Marshall,

and if there’s no bank —* excuse me -— if there’s no money in
the bank account, and the check, bounces, then of course th©
check does not constitute payment.
There’s a common-law doctrine known as constructive
payment in relation back, or conditional payment in relation \
back, under which th© check is taken as payment.

But the

note is not a direct payment, a note is just a mere promise
that the maker himself, not th© bank, is going to make,
payment in -th© future.
And they have always been treated by this Court and
th© lower courts as different for cash basis taxpayers.
QUESTION:

But sometimes it’s not all that easy to

make the distinction.
MR, JONES: Well, it’s really —

QUESTION;

On

MR, JONES;

That's correct# Mr» Stewart# it’s

really a practical distinction,
QUESTION;

That's what it is,

MR, JONES;

A note

I mean a check is the

conventional mode of effecting payment; a not® is not. And
the courts have drawn the distinction really on a practical
rather than on a theoretical basis,
QUESTION;

But a note is a promise to pay in the

future; the check is a direction to pay on presentation,
MR, JONES;

That's correct# Mr, Chief Justice,

QUESTION;

But if you have a demand note# it's a

promise to pay right now,
MR, JONES;

A promise that the maker will pay# not

a direction to the bank to pay. The maker still has to pay it
by check. In fact# in this case# the maker paid the note by
check# which indicatas that there is a difference# a very real
practical difference between the two transactions,
QUESTION;

On which side of the line would a 30-day

draft on a bank fall?
MR, JONES;

Well# I would think that — let m© make

sure I understand you.

Is a 30-day draft a draft that's

payable within 30 days or at the expiration of 30 days?
QUESTION;

No# at the expiration of 30 days.

32

QUESTION: Any time after the expiration,
MR, JONES:

I would think that that would only be

payment at the time of the expiration of the 30“day period,
QUESTION:

Because if it came after the taxable year,

it would be out —it would be in the same category as this

payment to a pension fund,
Or if it were a payment

by a cash basis taxpayer,
QUESTION:
MR, JONES:

Yes,
And really I was, at this point,

advancing the proposition -that the delivery of a not© is not
payment by a cash basis taxpayer under any circumstances,
whether it’s to the pension trust or to any other creditor,
QUESTION: And that’s th© Eckert holding,
MR, JONES?

Eckert and Price, Helvering v. Price,

Petitioner has argued this similarity between checks
and notes, and also in its brief it’s argued that delivery of
a note should be treated as equivalent to the payment of cash,
followed by a receipt of the cash back in exchange for the
note,
And it seems to us that Eckert and Price foreclose

33

this argument as well*

In those cases, litis Court treated

the delivery of a not© as the delivery of a note and not as
the end result of some series of hypothetical transactions
that never took place*
QUESTION;

Of course, the statute doesn't say that

payors will be treated as cash basis taxpayers*
MRo JONES;

That's correct, Mr* Justice Brennan*

It's something else —
QUESTION;

Well, I gather that's anticipating the

rest of your argument,
MR. JONES;

That's right.

I said at the outset

teat I'm really advancing two limiting propositions.
QUESTION;
MR* JONES;

Right.
Well, as Mr. Justice Blackmun recently

observed on behalf of the Court in the National Alfalfa case,
and I quote, "While a taxpayer is free to organize his affairs
as he chooses, nevertheless, once having dona so, h© must
accept the tax consequences of his choice, whether contemplated
or not."

Had they not enjoyed the benefit of some other

route he might have chosen to follow, but did not.
And because of the multiplicity and the imperfection
of possible analogies between different transactions, the
Courts have long followed the doctrine stated by Mr. Justice
Blackmun, that a taxpayer must accept the adverse tax conse­
quences of tee form in which he casts his transaction.

And

34
that th® courts will not recast that transaction to mitigate
the tax liability -that h© has incurred.
And the trans action hare was the mere giving of a
acts* not 'the payment of cash followed by a loan, and it.
should be treated as what it was and not as what it was not.
QUESTION:

What effect did the guarantors on tee

note have* did it make any difference?
MR. JONES s

I think that the fact -that the net worth,

of the guarantors exceeded the face value of th© note provided
adequate security.

Under Section 503 of tee Code* if the

note had not been adequately secured* it might have been a
prohibited transaction teat would have resulted in th© loss
of taxes.

I think that?s the only effect* from our point of

view.
QUESTIONS
MR. JONESs

What was the security for this note?

MR. JONES s

QUESTIONS Right.
MR. JONESs

On© was the interest of certain of tee

officers in their share in the pension trust.

But the third

security, which we think is most relevant* was th© personal
liability of th® wife of Mr. Williams -- tea personal liability

35
of Mrs. Williams and her net worth apparently was about four
tames that of the value of the not©.
QUESTIONS

Let’s assume that the stock of this

company was listed*, so that you had the market value readily
ascertainable* and that instead of giving a promissory note*

by delivering the appropriate number of shares of its own
stock from its treasury.

36

MR* JONES?

Well* as long as the pension trust has

to look to the assets of the company* If the company goes
bankrupt* the stock is not going to be very helpful* because
it is subordinate even to the unsecured liability of a
creditor.
However* if the taxpayer corporation actually
transfers the stock to the pension trust* then* it seems to

facts that the principal beneficiaries and the trustees of the

MR. JONES;
Justice Stevens.

Yes, we do think teat's important, Mr.

And I think if I can develop our affirmative

arguments under Section 404, the relevance of that will become

40

clearer*
Well* to summarize my argument up to this point*
w® think petitioner finds itself between Scylla and Charybdis;
that is* the accrual basis method of accounting is not
available under Section 404* but under the cash basis method
of accounting* petitioner is not entitled^to the deductions
it claims.
Now* petitioner* perforce* must argue* as it has*
that Congress intended to permit accrual basis taxpayers to
utilise a hybrid or intermediate method of accounting for
purposes of Section 404.

Our position* to fch© contrary* is

that Congress intended to place all taxpayers on -the same
footing* for purposes of this provision* and that cash basis
rules govern.
W® rely upon the legislative history* the language
of the statute* the statute’s overriding purpose* and considerations of administaxability.
QUESTION;
MR. JONES;

And what?

Considerations of what?

Adrainisterability.

Now* the legislative history and the statutory,
language admittedly are not conclusive.

But they are* we

submit* highly suggestive.
A witness before the Senate Finance Committee
■testified* apparently without contradiction* that* and I
quote* "the law has been drafted in such a way that all

41
corporations ara put on a cash basis on the payment to trusts*,
end quote.
The Sanate and House Committee Reports refer to a
requirement of actual payment, which is a cash basis concept.
The statute itself refers to -the requirement of a payment.
Now, the construction of this term "payment69, which
at least alludas to cash basis rules, must be informed by an.
inquiry into the underlying legislative objective.
In enacting Section 404, —- I think this point, is
crucial —■ Congress was not principally concerned with providing
a precise measure of the taxpayer’s economic net income.
Section 404 predominantly reflects non-tax concerns related
to the general social welfare.

Congress understood that

millions of workers depend on their employer's pension plans
for a large portion of their retirement income.

And we submit

that Congress sought to insure the financial viability of
those plans by encouraging employers to make their contribu­
tions in cash or its equivalent.
QUESTION;

And that it did so —

Well, there's a 1974 law that takes care

of those concerns, isn’t there?
MR. JONES;
Stewart.

That's true as to the future, Mr. Justice

We have about 116 cases pending for the past, and

we're talking about what interpretation should properly b©
given such a statute* in prior cases.
QUESTION;

In other words, when Congress wanted to

42
deal with and meet those concerns» it directly did so, —
MR. JONES;
QUESTIONS

Well, it has now don© so
— it did it through the Internal Revenue:

Cod®,
MR. JONESs

It has now done so more fully.

But

ERISA does constitute an 'amendment to the Internal Revenue
code.
QUESTIONS

I see.

QUESTION;

Mr. Jones, is there any other Court of

Appeals opinion in the pipeline now that favors the government,
on this issue?
MR. JONES;

To mv knowledge, this case has not been

decided in a Court of Appeals sine© the Williams case.
But there are a lot of cases pending* either in the
Tax Court or in an administrative stag®.

But, so far as I

know, there has been no subsequent Court of Appeals action.
QUESTION;

Well, the Tax Court is always kind of

hopeless for the taxpayer, isn*'t it?
MR. JONES;

Yes, but, nevertheless, this taxpayer

and many others have continued -to go there.

There is an

advantage, as you know.
In other words, we believe that Congress0 purpose
in requiring a payment was to insure that the employees0 trust
would secure the full advantage of any contribution for which
a tax benefit in the form of a deduction was made available

43

to the employero
New, petitioner argues, and I take it that this is
part of the essence of his argument, that that purpose is
sufficiently served by the delivery to the trust of a note
having value.
But that argument, and this is responsive, Mr.
Justice Stevens, to your question, that argument, it seems to
us, overlooks the fact that the trust and the employer are
ordinarily not dealing at arm's length in situations such as
■this.

Often, as is true heir©, a majority of the trustees ar®

also officers of the corporation, and 'there can be no
assurance that such trustees will treat' the note in its hands
as salable property.

It's far more likely, we submit, that

they will, as the trustees here did, hold the note until
the corporation itself is willing and able to make payment.
But this cause of action jeopardises the interests
of the affected employees that Congress sought to protect.
QUESTION:

But surely your argument today doesn't

— isn't limited to cases in which it may depend upon the
identify of the trustees, doss it?
MR. JONES:
Stewart.

No.

That's correct, Mr. Justice

But, as a practical matter, it's frequently true that

the trust, which, after all, is established by the corporation,
will have trustees that ar® also officers of the corporati.on.
Indeed, it would b© surprising if that were not 'the case.

QUESTION?

On tliat same analysis, in light of some

of your prior responses, the bond of a third party could
constitute the transfer of property.
MR, JONES:

Oh, there's no question about that, Mr,

Chief Justice. When a taxpayer holds the bond of a third party,
that's property in his hands; and when he gives it over to the
trust, he’s actually giving up property.
We -think that Congress' purpose in this provision
can be fully served only by requiring an actual outlay or
transfer of cash or property from the employer to the trust.
But when the employer holds the property in the form of a
not© of a third person, and transfeis it over,

that would b@

sufficient, in our vi©v?.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Jones, you keep arguing about

the investment, the fund holding the money; what about them

46

holding the check for e. year without cashing it?
That would he all right?
MR. JONES;

Well, again, Mr. Justice Marshall, the

only reason the check is treated as equivalent as cash, are
practical reasons. Theoretically, I mean if you only adhered
fc© theory, you would treat a check not as cash but like a
note.

But as a practical matter, to accommodate what actually

goes on in the marketplace, the Commissioner doss what the
taxpayers do, which is to treat a check as cash until it's
proved otherwise.
Well, finally, I want to —

MR. JONESs

To my knowledge, it does not.

I think

that the only prohibited transaction with which we're concerned

bacic to the employer.

And the new law treats the payment of

We submit that this long-standing interpretation by
the agency charged with the administration of the statute
should be sustained.
Now* petitioner's argument for a different treatment*,
for special treatment for accrual basis taxpayers rests almost,
exclusively upon an analogy to Section 267*, a section which we
believe is not relevant here.
Broadly speaking# that provision deals with trans­
actions between related taxpayers.

And the most familiar

example may be the wage expense incurred by an accrual basis
corporation in hiring on® of its cash basis shareholders.
And Section 267 provides that the corporation is entitled to
a deduction on account of the wages only if they are paid.
Now# early in the history of the predecessor of this
provision# -the lower federal courts# in these circumstances#
held that the delivery of a note to the shareholder constituted
payment# because the note was income to the cash basis share­
holder.
And in 1953. Congress amended the statute to insure
that the deduction would be available only if the income was
in fact realized by the cash basis recipient.

And after that

amendment# th® Commissioner acquiesced in the earlier
decisions# but in doing so explicitly distinguished between
Section 267 and Section 404.

49

Now, this history does not support toe petitioner*s
construction of Section 404«

The meaning of toe term npaid"

in Section 267 turns on the specific purpose of creating
symmetry in the treatment of related taxpayers;, and that is
the result that has been achieved»
QUESTION?

Do you think the symmetry isn't there

because the plan is exempt?
MR» JONESi

That's true, Mr. Justice Blackmon»

Now, the petitioner, in its reply brief, says, well,
Section 267 and 404 really are similar, because sub-section
(b)(9) of 267 applies to certain charitable organizations»
But toe history, or toe purp©s© of Section 267(b)(9) ,
as its legislative history plainly shows, is to prevent the
deduction of losses on the sal© of property to a charitable
organization controlled by the sailer»

And the rationale of

that provision is that since toe seller attains effective
control of the property, h@ should not b© entitled to toe
benefit of a loss deduction»
But that consideration lands nothing, sheds no light
on the meaning of to© term ''paid” in either Section 267 or
404»
My final point is that the proper analogy here is
not to Section 267 but to Section 170, which allows, in
t

language virtually identical to that of Section 404, a
deduction for contributions paid to charitable organizations»

50

The terra "paid3 is used in Section 170 as it is in
■Section 40 4 to insure that the tax-exempt recipient of the
contribution will attain a substantial present benefit# not
just the promise of a future benefit#as a result of the trans­
action giving ris© to the tax deductions
And for that reason Section 170 has always been
interpreted as requiring more than the giving of a promissory
note*
And the same result# for the same .reason# is appro­
priate here*
Congress intended that the taxpayer should part
with something more than its bare promise to part with some­
thing in the future, for obtaining the benefit of a deduction.
But Petitioner gave only its promise# not its
property.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals denying the
deduction should therefor© be affirmed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you# gentlemen.
