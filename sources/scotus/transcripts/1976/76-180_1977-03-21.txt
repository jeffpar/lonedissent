MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

g

s

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 76-180, Henry Smith against the
Organization of Foster Families, and the related casas.
Mrs» Gans, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. LOUISE GRUNER GANS,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS RODRIGUEZ, ET AL,
MRS. GANS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent Appellants’ natural parents, who
entrusted their children to New York Social Service officials
for interim foster care and not for adoption.
The-over-«ill question raised by the order of the
three-judge court below is whether the Federal Constitution
requires New York State to provide automatic hearings before
a child in a foster herns may return to its own home, or be
transferred to another fos tar home or adoptive home.
QUESTION:

Due process to whom, Mrs. Cans?

MRS. GANS;

Due process to the child.

The specific question raised with respect to natural
parents is whether- the Federal Constitution permits such
hearings to be held when children are returning home to them.
QUESTION;

Your clients voluntarily turned over their

children for temporary foster care?
MRS. GANS;

That is correct.

5
QUESTION:
MRS. GAN'S:

li: was not tiis result of a court order or No, it was not the result of a court

order.
QUESTION:

— because the children were delinquent

or neglected or —
MRS. CANS:

No, there was no adjudication of neglect.

On the contrary, New York has neglect proceedings.
The purpose of this kind of placement, which follows a separate
legal track, is to enable parents who, through no d&ult of
their own, are unable to care for their children, because of
poverty and soma other crisis,
QUESTION':
MRS c GAN’S:
QUESTION:

Or illness or something?
That is correct.
So this is voluntary on their part.

And

when they did so, what was the understanding ae to their
conditions under which the children ’would return to them?
MRS. GAN'S:

The essential understanding, as far as

they were concerned, were two:

they were willing to entrust

their children fco the State, they needed help? they were
assured that they had a right to have the children returned.
QUESTION:
MRS. CANS:

Assured by statutory law?
By statutory law.

And by actual

representations of Social Service officials.
Now, the form they signed don’t always say that.
And since -this action has commenced, there have been about

6

four different forms the parents have signed.

The first one,

which says nothing? the last one* which is in Special Procedure
No. 29 of the New York City Department of Social Services* says
you have a right ho have your child returned.
QUESTION:

When you are fit.

MRS. CANS;
QUESTION:

Is that it?

That is right.
Excuse me, I don't want to get ahead of

you.
MRS. G7\NS;
legally fit.

Not when you are fit.

We consider you

It's not unfitness to be ill* in the same way as

the neglect of a child.
QUESTION: Well* when you are ready and prepared.
MRS. GANG:

When you are ready.

You are entitled to

the return of your child* and we can unilaterally return the
child* subject to our power* as -the State of New York* always
to take you to court if we think you would be abusive or
neglectful.

So that that is the basic understanding.

There are additional understandings.
expected to visit the child.
arily hospitalized, she can’t.

The parent is

Again* if the parent is tempor­
But when she is able to* she

is expected to visit -the child and she is expected to make
efforts to deal with whatever the condition that required the
placement* so that, the child can come home.
But —
QUESTION:

The foster parent relationship* then* is

7
not an insipient adoption at all, where the natural parent has
signed off?
MRS. GAMS:

That is correct, it is not an adoption.

It is only if the parent's rights can subsequently be terminated
in a proceeding which New York provides for termination of
parental rights.

For example, a parent places a child, and

she recovers, but never comas to see the child,. New York, after
a certain point, can bring a proceeding to terminate that
parent's parental rights, and then the child is available for
adoption.
But it is not anticipated that any voluntary foster
care placement with the foster parent is an adoptive placement;'
not at all.
QUESTION: Who or what triggers the hearing in New
York State under the conditions that you just described to
terminate the parent's — permanent terminate the parent's
parental right?
MRS. CANS:

The way the present New York scheme works,

until the first eight — basically during the first eighteen
months of placement, the way the scheme is drawn, the relationship of parent and agency involving the child is insulated from
competing claims of foster parents.
During this period — for example, if the parent
places the child and is never heard from again, then, unless
the parent is hospitalised and unable to come, then sometime

8

around the one-year point, the State could file this proceeding
and it’s up to the State,
QUESTION: Well, who would draw the State's attention
to the situation?
MRS. CANS:

Well, the State monitors all placements,,

The State, at all times — the Department of Social Services
has extensive bureaucracy of social workers, whose responsibility
it is to keep in touch with the parent, to have a special
social worker for the child and to have someone who supervises
the foster home.
QUESTION:
MRS. CANS:

Basically to monitor the situation.
To monitor the situation, correcto

And they keep agency case records, both as a matter of social
work practice end as a matte?: of requirement of State
regulations.

So they must document at all times what they

are doing in the case.
But during the first eighteen months, the agency7 can
see, well, is this mother dealing with her situation?

' And

by the eighteen-month point or sooner — the earliest point is
six months, if the parent disappears, has never bean heard
from again, they can bring the proceeding.
QUESTION: Well, let me asks

In this case, haven’t

some of them been there four years and more?
MRS. GANS:

That is correct.

QUESTION: Well, how did that happen?

9

MRS. GAMS:
good question".

Well - I'm tempted to say "that is a

It requires this explanation:

Until 'the New York -- until about six years ago, this
whole system was an administrative system without any kind of
legal checks for the parent, for the chiId, for the foster
parent.

Okay.
So, for example, if a parent who wanted a child

returned, there was no mechanism which would insure that the
child was returned.
QUESTION:
MRS. CANS:

No habeas corpus?
Well, if the parent knew about it.

One of my clients, Mrs. Rodriguez, was a person who placed
her child, wanted her child three months later, although the
law does provide habeas corpus, no one advised her that it
exists.
So she just kept going to the agency and saying,
"I want my child”, and I tried to document in the record as
much as I could and in my brief how that could cause time to
pass, even though the mother wen bad 'the child and even though
the mother was not unfit.
So that was one problem.
The other problem is the agency had no accountability
independently, aside from -the parent.
Now, the. purpose of the foster care review, which was
enacted in, well, roughly, 1972 and has gone through serious

10

trans formations, was to provide an accountability mechanism so
that this does not happen. And in 1975 New York passed a
Social Services Law, Section 334(a), which provides:

when a

parent asks for a child, the State must return the child or
go to court.

And there has. to be an immediate hearing showing

why the child should not be returned.
How, what, wo have in the foster care system now are
children who are still, you might say, the residue of the old
system.
In Mrs. Wallace's case, those children who were in
placement for four years, she had six children, after two years
the agency returned two children to her* with the idea that
if she managed with the two, in a while the others would come
home.
Mow, this is not an unusual approach where there are
many children and there is a mother who has gone through a
depression.

So that’s the explanation.

QUESTION:
MRS. GAN’S:

I hear what you said.
The effect of the decision of the district

court for a parent, who wants her children and asks for them,
under present law, is that, although the State finds nothing
wrong with the parent, if the child has been in foster care for
one year, not four years, the four-year case will now be taken
care of in 'the foster care review proceeding, the agency cannot
return the. child, and the. parent’s right is conditioned on

IX
prevailing in an enforced custody contest with the foster parent„
QUESTION:

What was the standard?

Was the standard

imposed by the district court?
MRS. CANS;

No, there was no standard imposed by the

district court.
QUESTION: Then why do you say he must prevail in a
custody proceeding — -the parent.
MRS. GANS:

Well, if it is a contest, whatever the

standard, that the parent has to prevail.
QUESTION: Well, if it’s a contest, it may not be.
MRS. GAITS:

Well, the district court ordered hearings

to be held in every case.
QUESTION:
MRS. CANS:

To find out what?
To provide a forum.

What the district

court said —•
QUESTION:

Well, I know; to provide a forum to find

out what?
MRS. GAITS:

That is exactly our question:

to find

cut what?
We submit that if there is information which a foster
parent has which would suggest that a child that, is about to
be returned home might in some way be neglected or harmed by
the parent, that there are existing procedures available that
the foster parent can resort

to, or, of course, that the

Social Services Agency can resort to.

12
QUESTION: Well, it may be the only thing the district
court might want the hearing to provide is, as you say, a
forum where the agency can coma in and say "yes, we" — I mean
formally say, "Yes, we don't think there's anything wrong with
the children going back to the parents"e
MRS0 GANS: That hardly seems to be a reason for a
hearing in which the foster parent, who has —
QUESTIONs

I take it, then, you think the standard

really would be, at the hearing, what are the best
MRS c GANS :
QUESTION:

I f you mean
-»* what are the best — you just ask

one questions What are the best interests of the child?
MRS. CANS:

No.

QUESTION:

Nb?

MRS. GARS:

Why?

If the case is of a child in a foster

home for one year, then the standard is, Is the parent unfit?
QUESTION: Did the district court say that?
MRS. GAR'S:

Th© district court said that it was

leaving the New York standards in place«

And that is the

standard in one-year cases„
As interpreted by the New York Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought you said a minute ago that

it didn’t provide a standard at all.
MRS. GARS: Well, the district court said it wasn’t
creating a new standard.

What happened is that when the foster

13

parents brought the action, they challenged the removal
hearings, and they also challenged the standards,,
QUESTION;

You think the foster parent has

the

burden, then, of proving unfitness on the part of the parent?
MRS. GANS:

The foster parent and the State, yes.

The foster parent and the State.
QUESTION" The parent hasn't got any burden, I don’t
MRS. GANSs

No. Well, the parent has to defend a

right which he has .
QUESTION:
MRS. GANS;
fit.

Yes?
Because, under State law, she's legally

And she has to defend her right without there being an

accusation.

Because the foster parent comes —

QUESTION: Well, if the foster parent has the burden,
why, the foster parent is going to have to put on sons
evidence, I suppose.
MRS. GANS:

Well, but shouldn't — ovir point is this

if the foster parent has evidence, then Article 10 of the
Family Court Act provides a proceeding which is instantly
available to the foster parant, and anyone else, to protect
the child from being returned to a neglectful

parent.

Section 1031 of fee New York Family Court Act
specifically provides that neglect proceedings are applicable
with respect to children in foster care, who may be returned
to a home where they may be neglected.

14
So there is that forum.
In addition, if the foster parent has information
about possible neglect and tells it to the social worker,
New York child protective laws mandate an immediate 24-hour
investigation.

And a social worker who doesn't follow up on

the information is subject to civil and criminal liability.
QUESTION:

What tiie district court holding, then,

says is, even though the foster parent has presented that
evidence

to the social worker and the social worker has gone

through the investigation and found nothing to it, nonetheless
there must still be a due process hearing.
MRS. GAN'S;

That is correct.

We say that -that is a

hearing without a purpose; a fishing expedition against the
parent, tc find out about parent's failings.

And we believe

that, to require every parent with a child in foster care,
though they are legally fit, if they have had their child in
foster care for one year, to submit to that kind of hearing
is an impermissible burden on the parent.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Your time has expired now,

Mrs. Cans.
QUESTION;

Let me ask just one question;

What is

the requirement of notice to the foster parent before the
child is returned to the natural parent?
What does the State require?
Is there any requirement on that?

15
MRS „ CANS: There is a requirement of a ten-day
notice before any child is moved out of the foster home.
We have raised in our brief a question -— well, I
think the notice requirement applies in all cases.

We have

raised in our brief a question as to whether any of the
subsequent hearing procedures were intended to apply to the
case of children going home, as opposed to situations where
children were going to other foster placements.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mrs. Buttenwieser.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. HELEN L. BUTTENWIESER,
ON BEHALF OF INFANT APPELLANTS GANDY, ET AL„
MRS. BUTTENWIESER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Courts
I am the attorney appointed by the court to represent
the children, and I want to discuss this case from the point of
view of the. rights of the children.

In fact, ay principal

objection on behalf of the children is that I am reluctant to
see any more adults being given any more rights from which
they have to be disentangled before one can consider the best
interests of the child.
This case was, to start -*■QUESTION:

Well, your position doesn’t require you

to disparage the rights of the natural parents or attack those
rights.

16

MRSo BUTTENWIESER:

We don31 attack anybody *s rights»

We don't attack the rights of the foster parents, the natural
parents , or anybody .
questions

Do you concede that the foster parents

have soma constitutional rights?
MRS» BUTTENWI ES E R s
QUESTIONS

Mo, sir, we do not concede that»

I didn't think so,

MRS. BUTTENWIESER: But I didn't assume that we had
to attack it, because the court below found that they didn't
or didn't reach that question, and did not grant them
constitutional rights.
And when I!m talking about the children, I am not
talking about delinquent children, I am talking about all of
the children who come into cares of the State because the
parents are not able to take care of them.
Once I got into the case, I examined the complaint
and decided that, on behalf of the children, the relief that
was being requested was really bene fitting the foster parents
and not the children* And I have submitted an answer, in which
I have stated that none of the relief requested -will be of
benefit to the children.

And I have asked that it be dismissed.

However, the issue as to whether or not there is, as
a result, a case or controversy has already been briefed, and
I

unless -the Court wishes an answer -- I do not propose to

answer that question

17

We are opposed to the mandated hearings, in the first
place, because we do not see the advantage to anyone; as it is,a
foster parent has r right to ask for at least to be heard, not
a hearing, but to be heard, if it wishes to,

And the number of

foster parents that have requested to be heard in New York
City, since this statute went in, since a change went in in the
regulations permitting an actual hearing, has been, I think,
six or seven cases, or, at most, ten cases in one year.
Whereas, if we have a hearing here, we will have
upwards of thousands of cases, two or three thousand cases,
because that is the number of children who either return home
or go to another facility, or are placed for adoption out of
the foster home.

Of course, a number of foster families adopt

the children, if they become free for adoption, and that is
desirable; but where it is not desirable, and the children
have to b® moved into an adoptive home.
You take the little boy who is involved as a
plaintiff in this proceeding, Rafael Serrano, the parents
claimed that they had a right to consider that -this child
would stay with them, but whan they separated they left the
child.

Ths child is now back in an institution, because they

did not. keep the child.

There was no ceunter-obligation on

the part of the foster family to keep the child.
The issue as to whether or not these proceedings,
which have been, provided by the State of New York, for

18

determining whether or not the child should be returned, have,
up until now, not only adequately, as far as anybody can see,
determined when a child should go back, but there is actually
no evidence in -the record that they are unsatis factory, and
there is no evidence in the record that a hearing would add to
anything that would be helpful.
As a matter of fact, in the opinion, the majority of
the court writes:

A hearing perform the salutery function of

providing the agency with an organized forum in which to
gather information.
I'm afraid one doesn't "gather information” in a
forum.

And that information is already available to the agency,,
QUESTION:

Do you think the State has adequate

facilities to do this without the assistance of the federal
courts?
MRS, BUTTENWIESER:

Yes, very d©finitely.

These children are all under the care: of authorised
agencies, either the City Commissioner, Stata County Commissioner
or private agencies.

In New York City they are private agencies.

They are, by statute, visited regularly.

They are required by

the laws of the State of New York to encourage parental
visiting, so that the children can be returned home? and they
are required, at very short, intervals, to report to the City or
State as to what they have.
All of the

material which the opinion refers to as

19
the function of gathering information has already been gathered,
is already before the decision maker on behalf of the child.
And the only time that hearings have been required in the past
is where the foster parent has decided that the foster parent
wants to keep the children.
I feele in making the children who were under the care
o£ these foster parents plaintiffs in this proceeding was an
unreasonable usurpation of ’the rights of the children. The
children were under the care of public departments by contract
with the* parents. They had guardians. They were not — did not
require next friends.

And they certainly did not require next

friends who were looking to the joining of the children with
themf to obtain a right, that foster parents not. only don't have
now, but, by contract, don’t have now.
The contract with trie foster parents requires them
to return the children at any time that the agency docides
that it is in the best, interest of the child tc be returned.
QUESTION:

Well7 do you think it

excuse me?

QUESTION;

That is upon ten days' notice, isn't it?

go ahead.

MRS. BUTTENWIESERj The ten days’ notice is the
official notice.
QUESTION:

They can have no less than ten days.
That’s a statutory notice.

MRS. BUTTENWIESER:

That's a statutory notice.

However, when children ought to b© returned to their

20
natural parents or to go to another facility, it is customary
I cannot say that it occurs in every case, because I haven’t
examined ©very case.

But I represent a number of social

agencies, and I know that those social agencies at least, and
many, many others, work with the children and with the foster
family to enable the child to move from that foster
facility.

And, as a matter of fact, the only evidence on the

procedures for removing children i3 in the record, it's the
evidence testified by Mrs, Creech and Mrs. Edwards, both of
them executive directors of agencies with children, and they
describe a procedure whereby -She child is facilitated in
making ‘the change.
If you have a hearing," what you have is litigation,
you have the child th© subject of warring parti.es, acid then,
at the time of the decision, when it has already been made,
you then have a far more precipitous move of tits children.
QUESTION: But the statute itself, the New 'fork law,
doss provide, as I understood it from reading idles© briefs,
that if th:> child has bean in a foster home for eighteen months
cr longer, the foster parents are given an opportunity to try
;o explain why the child should not leave the foster home.? is
feh at co r re efc?
MRS„ BUTTENUIESER:

It’s not exactly that.

This is

called a. foster care review, and the objec&ve of that review
is the child’s welfare, not the right of the foster parent to

21
say why th© child should remain»
And* actually* the emphasis —
QUESTION: Well* why* in the interest of the child's
welfare* the child should not be in the foster home? that's
the ~~
MRS. BUTTENWIESER;

No. Why* in the interest of the

child's welfare* it should stay in the foster home. Because it
is presumed that the welfare of the child will require its
return horns* if there is a home to return to? or be placed
in an adoptive horre.
QUESTION:

Yes. Sometimes it's returned to the

nature;! parents* sometimes it is a transfer to either another
foster family or to an institution* and sometimes it’s a
transfer for purposes of adoption? isn't that it?
MRS» BUTTENWIESER:.

Yes, But the actual statute is

called foster care review* and it is to review why the child
should not be in a permanent setting, whether it's his own
home or an adoptive heme* or -the foster family adopt? whichever
it is.
QUESTION: And that New York law does* after a child
has been eighteen months or .more in a

MRS. BUTTENWIESER:

Yes.

It*s by contract.

It’s not

The foster parent enters into a contract with the

QUESTION:

Is it fundamentally different from the

arrangement made when they put people — people take their
children and put them in a summer camp for three months, except
that it’s a longer arrangement?
MRSo BUTTENWIESER:

In all fairness to the foster

family arrangement, I think it’s a closer arrangement than
that»

But it’s very much like that»

It’s like a boarding

school, with all the attributas of home..

It's a contract with

them.
Now, a contract which neither binds them not binds the
Commissioner.

The element which is binding is the best interest

of the child.
Tow, sometimes people do make mistakes, as to the best
interest of the child, but then so do 'the courts.
adversary proceedings.

Sort of

Otherwise we wouldn't have any appellate

procedures,if courts never made a mistake.
But — and there are procedures whereby, if it is
in the child's best interest to remain in the foster home, the

MRS. MARCUS:

but I am representing today ‘the State of New York and the City
of New York.

And? if the Court pleas©, I would like to reserve

five minutes for rebuttal,
I -think Mr. Justice White's questions illustrata the
drastic overkill in the decision below, in which we have- in
the year 1975, 16 requests for hearings, 26 in the entire
period that this hearing procedure of New York City has been
in operation. And just to summarize what that procedure would
offer to anybody who wants it, counsel, cross-examination, it's
a full-dress adversary hearing,
QUESTION:

That's in New York City,

MRS, MARCUS: That is correct.

And, of course, the

vast majority of focter children are in the New York City
population,
QUESTION:

Outside of New York City, it's a ten-day

notice, but then the sit-down sort of disoussion if the foster
parent wants to talk about it,
MRS c MA,.CUC «

it«s . i-u'ici a„. course the rsnto j’di xs not

done. The ten-day notice simply is to set the date of the
removal, it is not, by any means, the parameters of ’"she
process.

The process goes on over a period of months,
QUESTION: But if the foster parent wants to coma in

end talk about it, they will listen?
MRS. MARCUS:

That is correct.

And also, of course, at tit© eighteen-month point.
New York State has- a statute in which a full judicial hearing

MRS. MARCUS:

In the 392, they can present a variety

of information if they have information of neglect or abuse,
that can of course; be brought forward.

They

also bring

forward any other reason that they feel that the child should

MRS. MARCUS: Right.

offers.
QUESTION:

However short or long a time fcha child

has been in a foster home.
MRS. MARCUS: That is correct.
QUESTION:

Is that just from tee one* foster parent

to another foster parent, or is it also from a foster parent
back to the natural parent?
MRS. MARCUS:

No, it does not include the return to

the natural parent, it includes any other foster placement
which would be to a foster parent

or to an institution, to

something other than the natural parent»
QUESTION:

How about or for adoption?

MRS. MARCUS;

The adoption, I til ink, would be

inappropriate in a case where the child would be adopted.
QUESTION:

Well, whatever ’''ou think, I think I am

asking if tee law provides.
MRSo MARCUS:

It is not available in the case the

child is being moreti for adoption.
It is for another foster placement.
QUESTION: Right

v'

29
MRS. MARCUS;

Mow, the district court ordered these

automatic hearings because children cannot; speak for themselves ,
and because the court assumed that the foster parent would not
speak for them for a continuation of the fester car© relation­
ship in asking for tills hearing.
This assumption, it seems to me, is totally incon­
sistent with the argument of appellees that after a year the
foster care relationship is the

equivalent of the biological

relationship, becst.se it*s inconceivable to assume that a
biological parent is going to allow their child to bo taken
away and .lot bother to ask far a hearing.
Now, if the foster parents have the feeling of
natural parents for the

child, and they feel he should remain

in the home, they will request a hearing, and since only 26
foster parents have don© so in Naw York City ir the past two and
a half years, this means that the transfers that have been
involved h ive not involved any dispute

between -the parties,

and as this Court held last month, in Code? sm Verger,
dm? process doesn't require a hearing where there are no
factual disputes to be resolved.
Now, what is another result of the decision below,
in addition to the costly hearings find the hearings which
nobody really wants -QUESTION:
MRS. MARCUS:

Well, you’re saying no one wants them.
Nobody except: 'those few that have

30

requested them.
QUESTION :

Yes.

MRS. MARCUS:

One of the things also ~ by tha way,

I*m advisad her© that the hearings ar© available if the move
is fee an adoptive home. So I stand corrected on the point.
The city hearings.
QUESTION:

Now, tell us that again.

MRS . MARCUS j

Pardon?

QUESTION: Tell us -that again, will you, please?
MRSe MARCUS:

I am advised that the hearing process

available under the city procedure is available if a child is
being moved to an adoptive

home. The only exception is if it's

being moved to its natural parent.
QUESTION: Right.
MRS. MARCUS:

Now, another —

QUESTION: But the ten-day notice and the sitdown
discussion is available?
MRS. MARCUS:

That’s required regardless of what

the child is being
QUESTION:
MRS. MARCUS:

That’s the statute now.
Yes.

Now, Mr. Justice White asked the question earlier of
what is the standard going to be in these hearings which are
going to com© up, what is the standard now, what is going to
happen under tha district court’s mandate.

31

Wall# we have to first emphasis© that New York law
seeks to effectuate the reunion of the child with the natural
parent or adoption# it does not seek to maintain the child’s
relationship to a foster parent whoc is taking care of that
child by virtue of a contract and providing him with temporary
care rather than an adoptive home.
QUESTION? Supposing that over the span of several
years there is — it’s deemed by the social service agencies
neither desirable to reunite the child with the natural parent#
nor to place it. for its adaption# would it be normal in that
situation for the child to remain with only one foster parent
or might there be more than one foster parent involved?
MRS. MARCUS: Well# the 384(b)# which is a new statute#
what has been passed# doesn’t contemplate the situation -that
you’re asking about.
of this type.

It contemplates that there be no limbo

That, either the natural parent will be returned

the child# or# if: it appears that the natural parent is not
going to be fit to do that# that the parent's right should be
terminated and the child be freed for adoption.

And the

legislature states there that it is contrary to the legislative
purpose to allow this extended limbo to continue to occur.
QUESTIONs But don’t situations arise where there is

disharmony betwen e. particular foster child and a particular
fo'-tvur parent# rr.:> that there is a change, in foster placement
even though there is no adoption?

32

MRS» MARCUSs

Yes.

note that, of the foster

Actually, it's interesting to

- the removals from foster homes,

one-third are at the request of the foster parent themselves.
So that, of the movements within foster care, one-third of them
are attributable to the foster parent, and the foster parent’s
request.
Now, —
QUESTION: Well, as a practical mattes', if you know,
is that because -the foster parents find that this child is a
problem child and they are not able to cope with- it? is that
generally the'
MRSo MARCUS: Well, I think that is certainly a major
reason. Another season would be that I think some foster parents
art;’, suited, for example, to a younger child who is more
sedentary ? when the child becomes mote active and more
physically active and engaging in more different kinds of things,
the foster parent finds it more difficult to exercise super­
vision.
Now, what would the affect of the district court’s
decisions be, that there are now going to be automatic hearings
in virtually every case where a child has been in a foster home
for one year or more.

Obviously, that decision would require a

stay of removal during the period where the hearing is
scheduled, takes place, and a decision is rendered.

And such

stays would probably be issued during the course of appellate

33
reviews that are available under New York’s Civil Practice Law
and Rules,
And what happens with the substantive decisions that
are ultimately rendered in these administrative hearings, in
the review and in the judicial hearings which are presently
available under New York Law.
If the district court*s decision is affirmed by this
Court, New York judges will read it as a mandate to put a new
weight in the scales

The child's liberty interest in the

foster care relationship.
And since this liberty interest would be of
constitutional magnitude, judges would ultimately give the
natural parent's claim less weight than it presently has, even
where such parents are neither neglectful nor abusive.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MARCIA ROBINSON LOWRY,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MRS. LOWRY:

Mr. - Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I represent the foster parents who were plaintiffs

34
below and who are appellees today»

And I would like to address

myself specifically to some of the statements that have been
mads by the appellants, and I5d like to try and give the Court
some understanding of the factual context in which the district
court decided this decision.,
We have heard about the natural parents.

Indeed,

natural parent relationships have always been nccord«2d primary
protection by this Court, and we have no quarrel with that»
The record below shows that 00 percent of the children
who were removed from foster homes in New York State, after
living in -the foster home for a year or more, were removed for
placement in another foster care setting.
were going to be moved

That is, children

either to another foster home or they

were going to be moved to an institution of some sort; they
were not going back to their biological families.
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:
MRS c LOWRY:

What percentage?
Over 80 percent.
Over 80, ves.
Yes, Your Honorj 13 percent of those

children went back to biological family, 7 percent went into
adoption.

That’s v?hat is going on in the foster care system,

anu that .ts the csystem with which the New York District Court
was dealing.
The length of time of children in foster care in
New York State has, unfortunately, increased.

At the time that

35
the district court reached .its decision* it found that children
were in care an average of four and a half years; it's now over
five years,
QUESTION: But not necessarily with the same family,
is it?
MRS, L0V7RY:

That's right, Your Honor,

That's

right.
The only statistics with regard to children being
removed from foster homes in which they have lived for a year
or more were furnished in the course of this litigation, and
from the State defendants in response to interrogatories.
Those are the only statistics, and it shows that most of these
children, BO percent of these children are going elsewhere in
the foster care system.
QUESTION:

Mrs, Lowry, does the record show why the

State decided, in a typical case or in a certain percentage
cf cases, however it might show it, to remove a foster child
from one foster caresstting to another?
MRS, LOWRY:

Your Honor, the record does not show

that, but I v/ould like to describe to the Court the situation
of the foster family that initially brought this lawsuit,
I think it's very illustrative.
Mrs. Madeline Smith is a widow who has been a foster
family with a New York City agency now since 1970. The two
children who ware placed with her were two and four years old

36

when they were placed with her in 19 70,, They had not been
placed as a result of a court adjudication against the natural
parent. The natural parent had in fact left the children with ei
neighbor.

So that was considered a voluntary placement.
Those children were with Mrs. Smith for four years,

and Mrs. Smith repeatedly expressed her desire to adopt those
children. She, in fact, thought they were free for adoption
because the natural parent had never visited those children.
After four years, the agency workers changed, as is
the case usually in New York City; typically, the record shows
three or four or five workers will be involved in one foster
care situation.

All of the named foster parents had several

workers, never the same worker.
The new worker carae on the case, and the now worker
decided that these two children should be removed from Mrs.
Smith’s home because Mrs. Smith had arthritis which interfered ~
QUESTION:

Does New York have a policy with respect

to adoptions by unmarried people?

That is, this woman is a

widow, you said.
MRSo LOWRY: She is a widow, yes.
QUESTION:

Does New York have a policy about allowing

individuals to adopt?
MRS. LOWRY:

The policy is that *s ingle parents can

adopt in New York City, and single parent adoptions do take
place even with unmarried people.

Mrs. Smith, as you know, is

37

a widowo
And Mrs, Smith has been trying repeatedly to adopt
these children,

Mrs, Smith’s is the only permanent home these

children are ever going to have.
Nevertheless, an agency worker decided that the
children should be removed,

Mrs. Smith had no kind of right to

a hearing, nor did these children. These children faced the
loss of the only family they had ever known, and -QUESTION:
help me.

Mrs. Lowry, I have a problem, maybe you can

We have a child who is in Poster Family A, who is

about to be transferred to Poster Family Bj how can you
represent both family A and family B?
MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:
MRSo LOWRY:

Your Honor, -Who are both foster parents.
Your Honor, what we are representing in

this case is that there should be a hearing that the decisionmaking process should be constitutionally adequate.

At the

hearing itself, surely counsel for Foster Parent A could not
represent Foster Family B.

But what the Foster Families —•

QUESTION:

Well, do you represent both?

MRS, LOWRY:

Your Honor, wo are representing the

foster families1 interest in a constitutionally adequate
decision-making process,
QUESTION:
MRSe LOWRY:

So you’re representing A and B?
We are representing the principle that

38
there should be a decision-making process that is constifcutian­
ally adequate* and I don't believe that there is any conflict
between Foster Family A and

Foster Family B»

Surely Foster

Family B has no interest in having the child that is coining to
them unnecessarily traumatized by a removal from the home that
is a valuable home to that child,

I don't believe that there

is any conflicting interest there at all.
All this case is about and all the foster parents
are interest in is that the child's interest, be protected in
the decision-making process by a constitutionally adaquate
procedure,
QUESTION:

Adequate procedure* yes. but who is going

to fashion the --- who is going to draw up the standards or the
rules?

Is teat going to be a federal rule that the courts

should impose?
MRS, LOWRY:

No, Your Honor, The district court

below specifically said that tee federal court was only setting
forth the need for a procedure at which State standards could
be effectively applied,
QUESTION:

Well. the State standard has already been

enforced in these cases. The agencies have decided that the
children are to be; returned to tee home with respect to —
under the State rules,
MRS. LOWRY;

No* Your Honor. The State standard

with? and —■
QUESTION: But, in any event, in any of these
situations, by the tiro® the child has — they have decided the
child is to be returned, the State standard presumably has been
satisfied in the eyes of the agency.
MRS. LOWRY;
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:

Well, we're talking —
Is that right or not?
The agency thinks it has applied the

Stata standard, presumably.
QUESTION:

All right.

Now, is all the federal court

is going to do, or is all the trial type hearing is going to
do is to make sure that that standard has been applied? is that
all?
MRS. LOWRY;

The federal court ordered that a

decision be made with all of the information before it, and it
found that the procedure that presently exists was not adequate.
QUESTION:

Sc the hearing is going to —* the

controlling standard is going to remain the State standard?
is -that it?
MRS * LOWRY:

That's right, Your Honor. There was

absolutely no tampering with the State standard.

QUESTION:

So if there is a proposed transfer

from Foster Home A to Foster Horae Bf the procedure which you
contemplate means that Foster Horn©

&

would be represented by

40

counsel;. Foster Horae B would be represented by a different
counsel, the children would be represented by a third counsel,
and the State by a fourth counsel?
MRSo LOWRYj

No, Your Honor.

What the district

court ordered was simply that there be soma sort of a hearing
held so that all information that v/as relevant could be
presented to an administrative decision-maker.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't there be lawyers at -these

hearings?
MRS. LOWRY:

Not necessarily. The district court

specifically did not deal with that and said, in fact, there
is no requirement that counsel be available to represent these
parties.
«>

QUESTION:

Then why is the hearing the district

court ordered any different from the one that -die State
conducts now?
MRS. LOWRY;

Your Honor, are you referring to the

New York City procedure or the conference that the district
court found unconstitutional?
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:

Take -them both.
All right.

With regard to the conference that the district court,
found unconstitutional, the problem with that conference was,
No. 1, the decision maker had been involved in the decision
fco begin with; No. 2, the agency, as in the case of New York

41
City, that had made the decision need not be present? No. 3,
the foster parent who was coming in to contest the decision
did not necessarily know the reason for removal.

The record

shows that in some instances the foster parent isn’t even
told, because the agency may consider it wise to withhold the
information; and, No. 2, it’s undisputed that the notice that
the foster parent receives under the statute, under the
procedure declared unconstitutional, contained no information
whatsoever? and, No. 3, the foster parents had no right to
present any kind of ’witnesses, all they had was the opportunity
to come in and explain to the decision maker already

involved

in the decision why the decision was wrong, without knowing
the basis for the decision.
In addition, if the agency had based the decision on
any kind of documentary information, the foster parent who
came in to contest that had no right to know what that was.
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:

How about the New York City one?
All right.

The? New York City procedure

is a substantial improvement over that.

It applies only to

New York City, as the Court is aware, and it does not apply to
the return-home situation.
The court below found that the New York City procedure
was inadequate .because it was dependent upon the foster parent
triggering the hearing, when it was the child's interest that
the court was concerned with protecting.

42

QUESTION:

And the court below, as I understand it,

held that the foster parents, themselves, whom you represent,
did not have a constitutionally protected interest,
They found that -- they reached only one

MRS. LOWRY;

of the foster parents' claims„

They found that the foster

parents had no constitutionally protected property interest in
the foster parent relationship. They did not reach the foster
parent's liberty interest or equal protection claim. They found
it. unnecessary because they gave the hearing that the foster
parents were concerned with? and, in fact, the foster parents
got the relief they asked for.
QUESTION:

But they gave it, purportedly, at the

behest of the children.
MRS. LOWRY:

That’s correct.

It was based solely

c-n the children's constitutional right, and the foster —
QUESTION:

Yes, but based upon an identification of

a deprivation of the children's liberty, because, as we all
knew, the Fourteenth Amendment isn’t even invoked until or
unless a State deprives somebody of life, liberty or property.
MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:

That's correct1., Your Honor.
And the primary inquiry, therefore,

is:

Has somebody bean deprived by the State of life, liberty or
property?
And 'Chat primary inquiry was answered here by the
three-judge district court:

Yes, the children have been

43

deprived of liberty by the State, isn't that correct?
MRS. LOWRY:

That's correct, Your Honor» That was

indeed their answer»
QUESTION: And then, and only then, do we look to see
what procedural -- the guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment,
the due process clause, of procedural protection, what does it
require in this case.

And that's the question that the district

court answered.
MRS. LOWRY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That was

what it was limited to.
QUESTION: And there is, arguably, a property interest;
that’s been deprived of the foster parents here, since they do
get paid, don’ t they?

They have a statutory entitlement to

pay so long as — to be paid by the State, so long as the
child is in their home; isn’t that correct?
MRS. LOWRY: That is correct.

The district court

rejected that.
QUESTION:

But that was defeasible as a matter of

contract, is that what the
MRS. LOWRY:

Well, the district court rejected that

and found that there was no expectation of the continuation
of tee relationship.
QUESTION:

Because there was no

it was

contractually defeasible, that’s the will of tee State; is that
it?

44

MRS. LOWRY;

That's right.

That's right, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Lowry, when these children were put

into foster homes, there was no hearing, was there?
MRS. LOWRY:

The foster -- the natural parent had

a right to a hearing.

The natural parent either consented to

the child coning into the foster home or could object, and
there was a full hearing available in the Family Court. That’s
right, there was no —
QUESTION:

But they didn’t, automatically get a

hearing, did they?
MRS. LOWRY:

They did if they didn’t consent. They

either had a hearing —
QUESTION:

Well, automatically, I mean without

consent or anything.
MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:

That’s right.
Well, let me put it another way:

They

didn't force a hearing on them, did they?
MRS. LOWRY:

No, they did not.

They consented.

They,

unlike the children, —
QUESTION: So the children lost that liberty then,
didn't they?

Without a hearing.

MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:

They certainly did.
And then when they get under a foster

parent, they get more rights than they had when they were with

45

fcheir biological parents»
MRS. LOWRYs
QUESTION:

Well, either —
Is that right?

MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:

Not exactly»

It sounds the same to me.

MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION;

Not exactly»

Well, I911 explain to you why it9s not»
First, they took them away from their

own parents, without a hearing for the children. The children
didn't get any hearing- did they?
MRS. LOWRY:

Your Honor, they did not take them

away from their own parents. Their parents either gave them up
or, if there was a hearing, the children were represented at
the hearing by counsel.
QUESTION; Well, so far as the children were concerned,
nobody paid

anything about that at all, so far as a full**

blown hearing was concerned.
Now you’re going to give the foster parents; more
rights than the biological parents had.
MRS. LOWRY;

Your Honor, we are only concerned

*

QUESTION: Where am I wrong on that?
MRS. LOWRY:

Where you are wrong is that if the State

-- the State has an obligation not to agree to have Che parents
give up the children unless the parent has a reason for doing
that.

If a parent comes in to the State and says, "I don’t

like my child today, please take my child," the State; will not

46

take that child»

If the parent wants to put the child in,

and there is no reason for it, then the child cannot he put in®
On the other hand ■— so the parent has to affirma­
tively say, 5,I can't deal with my child", and the State has
to look and see that the parent in fact cannot. And if the
parent then agrees to put the child in, then there is no
hearing.
However, if the State comes to the parent and says,
"I want to taka your child" aaid the parent says "I'd rather you
didn't", then there is a full-blown hearing at which the
child is separately represented in New York by a law guardian,
who may say —
QUESTION:
wrong?

Am I correct, or do I read the opinion

Under this opinion, I think if the foster parent says,

811 think the child ought to be transferred", you still have to
have a hearing,

Any hearings.

The children are generally not
If there is a court hearing of soma sort,

the judge may often question the child in chambers; but the

QUESTION;

Mrs. Lowry, what about the hearings

ordered by'the district court?

Is the interest of the child

to be represented, at that hearing, and, if so, by whom?
MRS. LOWRY;

The child — the district court

contemplated that the child's interest would be represented

MRS. LOWRY;
from the order

By whom?
I must say, it’s not exactly clear

48

QUESTION;

Well, isn5t that: critical?

MRS. LOWRY;
QUESTION;

I believe that —
Isn’t it the child's liberty interest

that triggers the whole process?
MRS. LOWRY;

I believe that it is, and,, as I read

the opinion, the court contemplated that either the child would
participate in the hearing if the child were old enough, or
that an adult representative would be appointed to represent
the child’s interest at the hearing»
QUESTION;

So if you have a child three or four

years old, as some, at least, when these started, you'd have
to appoint an adult representative in every case»
MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
I take it, it could also mean that no one

could waive the right to a hearing, so that we would have to
have a hearing before every transfer?
MRSo LOWRY;
QUESTION;

That’s right.
Do you think -that's the correct decision

that we should reach?
'.IRS• LOWRY:

1 think that it’s the correct decision

under the circumstances that the district court limited in its
order. That is, I think that there should be a hearing when
the child has been in for a year or more and is going any
place.

I think that some — and the foster parent has not

requested -the removal.

I think that some hearings can be —

49

QUESTION; Why should it matter if the foster parent
requested the removal?
MRS6 LOWRY:

Well, I think that that was simply a

practical consideration®

I don31 think that ~~ I think that if

a foster parent feels that the child cannot stay with the
foster parent any longer, it doesn't make sense to try and
impose that®
On the other hand, for —
QUESTION:

Well, what if it’s in the best interest

of the child, though?
MRS® LOWRY:

Well, it's hard to contemplate a

situation in which it would be in the best interest of a child
to stay with people that had asked -that the child be taken®
But I believe that's why

your concern is why the court

required a hearing in all other situations®

That is, the foster

parent may be silent, and it may be in the best interest of
the child to stay there® And so the district court in those
situations directed that a hearing b© held.
It's quit® obvious that at some of these hearings,
the hearing may be very, very brief and f&irlv pro forma if
there’s a very good reason for the hearing and for —
QUESTION: But if you must locate an adult to
represent the interest of the child, what kind of delay do you
think will always b© involved?
MRSo LOWRY:

I think that the district court directed

50
that procedures be formulated, and I think the proce (hares can
easily be formulated which will allow this to go forward within
a ten-day time period.

I think that there is no problem with

that, and I think also the Court should be aware of «die fact
that, despite the fact we've heard about thousands and
thousands of hearings, in fact that is not the case. The
record shows that the number of transfers is not as great -—
at which the hearing would apply, is not as great and we —•
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:

How great is it?
Well, there were 1500 transfers from

1973 to 1974 of those children who had been in a foster home
for a year or more.

The city estimates that approximately one™

third of those transfers are at the foster parent's request?
therefore, they would be exempted.
So what we’re talking about, at best, is a thousand
hearings a year. And I think, in addition to —
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:

A thousand transfers?
We're talking about a thousand transfers

that have not been at the foster parent’s request.
QUESTION:

This is —

Under the district court's judgment., a

thousand hearings.

MRS. LOWRY:

That’s right. Your Honor.

That's what

we’re talking about.
We don’t know exactly how many of 'these transfers
.would take place if there were some sort of procedure, that

51
required the agencies to justify the hearings,
QUESTION;

Mrs, Lowry, your argument, which, I

gather, was accepted by the district court, was that the foster
family relationship is akin, in its protected status under the
Fourteenth Amendment, to the biological family, was it not?
MRS, LOWRY:
QUESTION;

That it was akin to it.

The district ~~

Not that it was identical, but that that

was the basis for it,
MRS, LOWRY;
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
Now, if you had a biological family, where

the father and mother said, "We’re tired of having this
natural kid around, we’re going to take him over to the local
A

institution and dump him there," would you think that the mere
fact of that dumping was to occur at the initiative of the
parents eliminated any requirement for a hearing?
MRS. LOWRY;

No, I wouldn’t necessarily think that,

Your Honor,
QUESTION; Well, it’s not a State action, the due
process clause isn’t applicable, is it?
MRS. LOWRY;

Well, if the agency that’s tailing -the

child is taking the child to
QUESTION:

It’s just the recipient.

It’s not the

government that’s dumping the child, it’s the natural — it’s
private people. The due process clause is inapplicable,
MRS. LOWRY; Well, then, that's the answer to the

52

quasfcion. perhaps 0
[Laughter»]
QUESTION: Well, then, why is it different in the case
of foster parents?

Why, if they initiate the dumping — that

may be an inartful word, but I think it conveys the expression
— should there be no hearing, but if they object to it there
is a hearing?
MRS, LOWRY:

I think that that is simply grounded

in the reality of the fact that it is very hard to —- first of
all, the State is interfering here, the State is sanctioning
fch® removal, and this child is in the custody of the State»
This child remains in the custody of the State.

And so the

State has a continuing concern in this child’s life.
However, if the facility, the home that the Stats
has provided for the child, no longer wants to take care of
the child, it. is very hard to imagine that the State can
require that.
Someone asked a question about whether or not this
was the same as putting your child in summer camp or a
boarding school.

I think that it's quite clear that it is not,

and I don’t think that that analogy can b® made.
The foster family is the best substitute that there
is for a natural family home.

I think everyone agrees that

it’s best for a child, to remain in a natural family where the
relationship is a viable one and the child is not being harmed»

53
I think there’s no dispute about that.
These are children who have been out for a year or
more, and the reason that the State has put the child in a
foster home is because the State expects not just that the child
is going to be housed and fed and not left to roam the
streets at night,, but because the child is going to have a
family relationship.. And, in fact, the foster family is the
most likely family to adopt a child, if the child later is
adoptedc
For example, Mrs. Smith is now in the process of
trying to adopt the foster children that have been with her
since 1970.
Most of the adoptions in New York State are foster
families

of foster children are done by foster families»

So it's not merely a custodial relationship.

The State has,

therefore, a very great interest, contrary to simply disrupting
the relationship arbitrarily, a great interest in mailing sure
that the decision to remove the child is made under
constitutionally adequate, procedures, where everyone, including
the child, has an opportunity to be heard»
QUESTION; But the State isn’t asserting any claim to
a special hearing.

It's satisfied with what it had before

your lawsuit was brought, isn't it?
MRS» LOWRY;

Indeed it is, Your Honor»

Indeed it is»

And, in fact, if: raises as support for its position Me a chum vy

54

Fano, a situation in which the right of the State to transfer
a person from one prison facility to another was uphold.
And we are saying that there is a conflict here
between the interest of the child and the State8s assertion,
because we believe that the State should be concerned about
whether these decisions are being made with all of the informa­
tion available»
QUESTION:

Well, it xnay be so as a matter of policy,

but. getting back to the first preliminary inquiry in any
procedural dus process case, there must be an effort to
identify whether or not there has been a deprivation of life,
liberty or property*
Now, here the district

certainly there was no

deprivation of life in this case, you can set -that aside.
The district court found no deprivation of property»

The

district court did find deprivation of the child's liberty?
the foster child's liberty.

And how would you identify the

foster child's liberty that is being deprived in -this case?
MRS. LOWRY;

All right.

I think it stems from

several sources, and I'll tell you what they are.
QUESTIONs

What I am interested in is a description

of what it is.
MRS. LOWRY; All right.

The child is being condemned

to suffer grievous loss without, being heard.
QUESTION:

Now, let's talk about liberty.

Because

55

— let’s talk about, what Idle Fourteenth Amendment talks about®
MRS. LOWRY:

All right.

The Fourteenth Amendment talks about certain areas
in which the State may not interfere arbitrarily -QUESTION:

Life# liberty or property.

MRS. LOWRY:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

We have eliminated two of them and we

are left with liberty.

Now# what liberty of the child is being

taken sway?
MRS. LOWRY:

All right.

We're talking about the

liberty of the child in the foster family relationship.

One

of tee zones of privacy that the Fourteenth Amendment has been
held to protect
QUESTTON:

It doesn’t talk about — try to answer

my question first and then you can explain all you want.
MRS. LOWRY:

It is the child's interest in tee

family relationship, Your Honor. That's a liberty interest.
QUESTION:

Has that ever been identified as a

liberty before# in any other case anywhere?
MRS. LOWRY:

The fa.xoi.ly relationship has repeatedly

keen identified as a liberty interest.
QUESTION:

The child’s liberty# or has it been the

parents, the natural parents?
MRS. LOWRY;

There has never been a conflict between

parent and child before# but in Stanley v. Illinois# the Court

56

spoke about the family relationship, both from the s tandpoint
of the father and from the standpoint of the child*
QUESTION:

Well, there's Armstrong v. Manxo, too*

But that involves a parent’s interest, the natural parent's
interest*

This is a foster child’s liberty interest, and I am

interested in how you would describe it.
MRS. LOWRY:

Well, there is no — has not been a

case in which this has specifically been held. There’s no
question about, that, and I’m not suggesting that. But the child
has a liberty interest in the relationship which this Court
has repeatedly found to be a protected relationship.
QUESTION: Well, where has this Court ever identified
any such liberty?
MRS. LOWRY:

Well, this Court has identified the

liberty interest ~~
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:

Or any court.
— in family relationships, from the

standpoint,as you say, of the natural family.
QUESTION: The natural parents! interest.
MRS, LOWRY:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

That’s in Stanley v. Illinois ? Armstrong

v« Manssc* —
MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:

That’s right.
— and,I’m sure, other cases.
That’s right.

57

I find it hard to believe that the court would limit
that only to the natural parent and not have the right flow
two ways. Children have been held to have liberty interests in
other situations. That is, —
QUESTION :

Certainly.

If they’re put in jail, they

have an interest in not being put in jail.

A child can have

all kinds of liberty interests.
MRS. LOWRY:

They also have an interest in not being

arbitrarily suspended from school.
QUESTION;
MRS. LOWRY:

Y@S.
Both based on their property interest

snd their liberty interest.
And, in addition to that, Your Honor, I’d like to
point out that the Fifth Circuit, just a month ago, in a
decision yet unreported, found a liberty interest both in the
foster family — in the foster parent and in the foster child
in an analogous situation, citing this case.
QUESTION: Well, if, as my brother Stevens suggested
in a question a few moments ago, the child does, the foster
child doss have this liberty interest which is constitutionally
protected by ‘the procedural due process accorded by tee
Fourteenth Amendment, why isn't teat interest protected if
the foster parents don’t want him in the ho-:
MRS. LOWRY: Well, I think that, as a reasonable
matter, ----

58
QUESTION:

.Weil,,

it's still the same liberty

interest, if it's the child’s interest, isn't it?
MRS„ LOWRY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, and —
Why on earth did the district court say

that no hearing is required if the foster parents don't want
him in the home?
MRS» LOWRY:

Well, Your Honor, this Court could of

course modify the decision in that respecto
QUESTION: Well,, why do you think it did?

Why do

you think the district court did, if the liberty interest was
the kind of interest you're describing?
MRSa LOWRY:

The district court did it after sub­

mission of affidavits by the city defendants, in which they
made a policy argument that there was no need to have a hearing,
and it would be counter-productive to have

a hearing in a

situation in which foster parents were requesting the removal?
that, in fad;, it might be destructive to a child to require
the child to stay there during the hearing process when the
fostrr family had affirmatively asked that the child leave.
That was the basis for th© district court exempting
that»
QUESTION: Well, then, the liberty interest, I guess
cur description -ought to be narrowed somewhat.

It’s an

interest in remaining in a willing foster parent’s home? is
that it,?

59

MRS, LOWRYj

That's right# Your Honor»

In which

there is a relationship that could be protected there»
And Isd like to also address myself to another
question that you raised earlier# and that is whether or not
the State Court review process is in effect when a child is
being removed from a foster home.

It is not» The State Court

review process is a review of status# which takes place
periodically,
Mrs, Smith had had a review of foster care status
with regard to these children only two weeks before the
children were to be removed from her home. And the record
shows that the agencies do not require the court to order that
the children be removed before the children actually are
removed.
The foster care review status is a hearing in which
the child is determined to remain in public care# in foster
car® generally # and in which the agency is free then -to move
the child any place# as -they were preparing to do in Mrs,
Smith's case.
So that there
are nother other available ways in
..
j

which the liberty interest could be protected,
QUESTION: Well# what need do you think is defective
about the present procedure of ten days5 notice and then a
sitdown conference — isn't there an opportunity for a sitdown#
at least a conversation with the agency?

60

MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:

Yes, there is the —
And can the foster parents being any

information they have there?
MRS * LOWRY:
don’t know the

They can bring information, b at they

reason that the child is going to be removed,

so they are somewhat handicapped.
QUESTION: Are they ever told, at the time?
MRS. LOWRY;

They may or they may not be, and it

may ox* may not be the reason for which the child is going to
be removed. The record is very clear on this.

They don’t know

the reason for the child being removed in many cases,,
If the reason for the child being removed is based
cn a report in the record, they do not have access for that,
they have a hearing —

e.

person who is conducting the

conference who has already presented .
QUESTION: Well, do you agree that under State law
iihafc when a parent voluntarily turns over his child to the
State to place in a foster homo, do you agree that the under­
standing is, or the State law is that the parent has the
right to have the child back, upon request?
MRS. LOWRY: The State lav; says that, that's right.
But there are, certain exceptions.

I think that the situations

vary enormous ly.
The Gandy children’s mother voluntarily placed these
children with the State

61
We are talking about situations in which at least a
year has passed, often much more time has passed»

I don’t

believe that the State lav; says that the natural parent has an
absolute right, in fact the State law has changed since this
decision and has been modified somewhat. So now a hearing
that might be directed by this Court could look into a few
other things, depending on the length of time the child had
been there,
QUESTION;

By the way, what standard do you think

the agency in New York applies now when, after a year, there
is a removal from a foster home proposed, and they give the
f os tier parent notice, what standard do you think the agency
is applying in deciding to remove the child, to return it
to the parant?
MRS, LOWRY;

I think the standard varies, I think

that the standard that would be articulated -—
QUESTION;

Well, is it applied in — do you find it

in the statute or in a regulation, or where do you find it?
MRS, LOWRY;

The statute says that an agency

383(2) says that an agency may remove a child from a foster
home at the agency's discretion.

That’s the standard in the

statute,
hgencies generally operate under the rubric that
they are acting in the best interest of the child.
agency's decision-making process is —

But the

62
QUESTIONs

Well, as far as a standard is concerned,

that’s all right with you, I taka it?
MRS. LOWRY:

That certainly is.

But it's obviously

a sufficiently vague and subjective standard, at which a lot of
subjective information is relevent —
QUESTIONS Well, it may be, but you wouldn’t suggest
that the standard be changed?
MRS. LOWRY:

No»

No, Your Honor.

All we’re

suggesting is that there has to be some sort of an adequate
procedure to determine whether the standard has been correctly
applied.

I don’t think that anyone at this point will assert

that the standard was correctly applied with regard to the
removal of Eric and Danielle Gandy from Mrs. Smith’s home;
and, in fact, the agency itself changed workers and reversed
itself.
QUESTION:

Is the agency decision, in New York,

subject to any kind of judicial review?
MRS. LOWRY;

No. The agency decision is subject to

the conference -that 'the district court declared unconstitu­
tional t and then the child may be removed.

After the child

is removed, there is a full administrative fair hearing
provided by Section 400 of the Social Services Law.
QUESTION:

And than that is subject to judicial

review?
MRS. LOWRY:

And then that is subject to judicial

63
review * perhaps many, many months and years down the road,
after the child has been subjected to an incorrect decision.
After Eric and Danielle, for example, could have
been out of Mrs. Smith’s home for a year and a half by the time
this case could have gotten into State Court to review whether
or not Mrs. Smith indeed had arthritis that mads her incapable
of caring for the children.
QUESTIONs Do you think the district court would
require that trial type hearing, the full trial type hearing
prior to removal be subject to judicial review?
MRS. LOWRYs Well, I don’t think that: they required a
full trial type hearing, but I think it was their intent and
I think the opinion specifically says that they contemplate
this to be a final administrative decision, so that judicial
review could be obtained immediately, and if any stay was
going to be granted, that of course would be up to a court.
It hardly would be automati.ce
But I think that they were trying to make -bhis
decision-making process as speedy as possible, rather than
allowing the present procedure, which contemplates a conference:
first, the removal, and then full-scale review after the harm
has already been done; so -that, in a sense, the harm is really
irrevocable, because the child has already been subjected to a
removal, which may have not been necessary and which
constitutional standards, we believe, could require «and make

64

much more adequate in terms of making a decision for these
children.
We're talking about children who are being separated
from what may be the only horns they know, talking about
QUESTION:

Mrs. Lowry, could I just put this other

side of the problem to you for a moment?
Supposing the agency adopted a rule that in a single
foster parent situation -- and Mrs. Smith was a 53-year-old
widow — a single parent over 52 or 53 years old, suffering
from a severe illness of some kind, such as arthritis, should
not, in the normal case retain custody of the child such as
this; would such a rule be arbitrary?
MRS. LOWRY:

I think it would not be subject to

judicial —- to federal court jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Well, if that were adopted as agency

policy and you imposed the hearing, then who shall decide
whether or not,the policy should apply in the given case?
It's going to be an employee of the agency, isn't it?
MRS. LOWRY:

No. The person who would decide

whether the decision was arbitrary would be a public official.
QUESTION:
maker?

Now, who is this independent decision

That's the question I was getting to.
MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:

All right.
What does the Constitution require with

respect to the identity of the parson who shall decide whether

65
or not to apply the policy?
MRS» LOWRY:

I think that the only thing that the

Constitution requires here is that the decision maker not be
previously involved in the decision.
QUESTION: But where
that?

does the Constitution require

Why isn't it perhaps wiser to have a person who has

some background with the family and the child and all the rest
making the decision?
MRS. LOWRY:

Well, I think that — first of all,

there's nothing to require that this decision maker not be
someone with some background in social services.
But, because —
QUESTION:
this particular case»

No, but with knowledge of the facts of
Why does that disqualify a person,

otherwise independent, having no financial interest, no
interest other than the well-being of the child?
MRS. LOWRY:

Because the people who then appear

before the decision maker, who want to present the information
to the decision maker, are burdened by the fact that the
decision maker has knowledge of a great deal of information
that the other people may not know of and may not have an
opportunity to refute»
If the social services official has been involved in
tiie decision, as the record shows many of them were, then they
may have access to a great deal of information that in fact is

66

not; accurate.

And when the family and the child’s representa­

tive or the child comes in to explain why the decision is
incorrect# that the people 'who come in to explain that will
not know about what, information the decision maker has in
his or her head# and -they can’t refute it.
That’s why it is important that the decision maker
make a decision based on information that93 presented then# that
each side can have an attempt# an opportunity to refute.
This doesn’t require lawyers # it can be as informal
ss people sitting down and talking.

But the decision cannot

bs made-’ fairly unless all parties know what the other side has
to say# and have an opportunity to say# "This fact is wrong#
but this fact is right;1' or ;1 the fact is half right and half
wrong.”
QUESTION:

Mrs* Lowry# I’m still in trouble.

Is

this person a person outside of the agency?
MRS» LOWRY:

The person is an employee of Idxe

Social Service District, and if the child is in care with the
Social Service District# —
QUESTION: Well# I mean# I’m talking about the one
you want.

Will you settle for that?
MRS. LOWRY:

Yes# Your Honor.

1 think we’re talking

about the same kind of a decision maker —
QUESTION: Well# the only one you want is somebody
who didn’t handle this particular case.

67

MRS. LOWRYs We want someone who is not involved in
this particular case* who will make a decision based on the
information presented to them at the time everybody lias an
opportunity to hear the information,
QUESTION:

Well, is the man at the conference, the

man or woman at the conference such a person?
MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:

I beg your pardon?
When the conference is held.
At the conference.

No.

The person

at the conference, the record shows, usually was involved in
the decision making at the initial stages,
QUESTION: But you would settle if it were .another
equivalent person, but just didn't -— for example, somebody
who had another authorised case but didn't have this one.
MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:

That's right.

But we would ~

You would be satisfied.
Yes, but we would say that it cannot

be someone from the private agency, it has to be the public
official as the conference now requires.
These arcs private agencies that are publicly funded
and are delegated with the responsibility of taking care of
these, children.

It’s a public function, and we would say that

an in-agency conference would not be adequate.

But a Social

Service agency conference, just as was contemplated in Goldberg
v. Kelly, would be adaquate»

68

QUESTIONS Well, you don't want to overhaul the
whole Social Services, do you?
MRSo LOWRY:

Not at ail»

We’re asking only for the

same kind of decision maker as is presently provided in the
revised city procedure»

We'r© not asking for a different

kind of decision maker.
QUESTION: Well, all these arguments

go to what

kind of piece of legislation the State of New York ought to
have dealing with this sensitive subject.
MRS. LOWRY: Well, Your Honor, I believe not. The
district court said that the exact details of the procedure
should be worked out by New York, but the question of whether
or not there should b® a procedure and whether or not it should
satisfy minimal due process, with the right of everyone to be
heard, I believe is a federal issue and is a constitutional
issue? and I believe that; these children have been condemned
tc suffer* grievous loss, they do have a constitutionally
protected interest in the relationship, in this family
relationship, which may be their only family relationship and
their only hope for permanence»
QUESTION:

Are you here representing the interest

of the children or of the foster parents?
MRSo LOWRY:
the foster familye
foster parents»

I am here representing the interast. of

As you know, Your Honor, I represent the

QUESTION:
children's rights»

Well# you were just speaking about the
I thought your friend was representing

their interest# and the State»
MRS» LOWRY: Well# it is our position that we repre­
sent the foster children’s rights as articulated by die
disrtrict court»

Mrs» Buttanwieser# as you know# has not

requested such relief.

The foster parents have requested such

relief# and we believe w@ have standing to raise the children’s
interest with regard to tills right,
Mr, Justice Rehnquist# I’m sorry# I didn’t hear your
question»
QUESTION:

You have a problem common to many

counsel, of being peppered by more than one Member of the Court;
at a time»
What is the issue that this hearing is supposed to
resolve?
MRS * LOWRY:

All right. With regard to the situation#

the most common situation# 80 percent of the situations# in
which the child is being removed from the foster home and to
be transferred some place else# the hearing is to decide
whether the transfer is in the child’s best interest.
QUESTION:

And is the reason that that is the issue

is because Now York says that is what the issue is?
MRS. LOWRY;

New York says that the children can be

70
removed at the agency’s discretion*
I believe that New York also takes, as a matter of
legislative policy,, that decisions made with regard to children
should be made in their best interest.
QUESTION £ But now, is this question to be answered
e.t the hearing one that has its direct source in New York lav;,
or is it superimposed as part of the constitutional guarantee
by the district court?
MRS. LOWRY:

No.

The district court —■

QUESTION: Which?
MRS. LOWRY:

I'm sorry. The district court did not

deal with standards at all. The district court was very
explicit. The questions to be answered at the hearing, about
what's in the best interest of the 'Children, are matters
solely of State policy. There is not federal policy that is
imposed by the district court decision.
The district court says teat tee hearing is only to
adequately effectuate State policy, and that it’s constitution­
ally required but to effectuate Stats policy and not to impose
any kinds of federal policy.
The question to be answered when the child is going

to be returned to a natural parent is a question that is
detailed by State law, it's a Stata lav; standard that has to be
applied then, and it’s a different standard than when the child
is going to go to another foster family, but it is determined

71

by State law.
QUESTION:

Each of these standards are now applied

by various New York public agencies# but just not in the same
manner as the district court thinks they ought to be applied?
MRS. LOWRY:

They are not applied in a constitution»

ally adequate maimer# and the decision is not reviewed in any
kind of a constitutionally required manner until after the
child is out of the home.

It is reviewed after the child is

out of the heme, and not. before.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Lowry # could I ask you another

ques tion?
The foster parent status# as having authority to
receive foster children# is something that is renewed
periodically# is it?
MRS. LOWRY:

Yes . it is.

QUESTION: Does the child hav© any right to protest
the withdrawal of a license of a foster home?
MRS. LOWRY: The child does not under New York law#
but that would be •— that would likely —
QUESTION:

It could happen# could it not?

For

«sixamplc.., that they might adopt a rule that no one over 50
years of age# with arthritis# can be a foster parent,
MRS. LOWRY:

The. State could do that# that's right.

QUESTION: And without any notice or hearing to &
child who might be affected by such a decision?

72

MRS, LOWRY;

Well, I think that if a child were in a

foster home and there was such a relationship, then the fact
that the license was going to be withdrawn would be an issue
at the hearing,, And I believe under the district court decision
that would require a hearing# and I believe even under the
existing procedures.

There is presently a procedure where

that foster parent could challenge the determination of
withdraw^, of the license,
QUESTION;

I see,

MRS0 LOWRY:
child is removed.

But that would be# again# after the

Section 400# I believe# contemplates that.

That again is after the harm has been done# the
unnecessary harm.
QUESTION:

The logic of the district court’s

opinion would seem to require that the child, whose liberty was
going to be deprived by the loss of license by fch© foster
family, would be the party at interest in such a hearing.
MRS. LOWRY:
QUESTION:
MRS. LOWRY:
QUKSTIQN:

Yes,
Constitutionally,
Yes, and ~
So that he or she would have a right to

procedural due process accorded by the Fourteenth Amendment
before New York could cancel the license of a foster parent,
of his or her foster parent,.
MRS. LOWRY:

That’s right. And I believe that’s a

73

situation covered by the district court's order# because#
in that case# the reason for removal would be the

cancellation

of the license# and then there would be a hearing at which it
could be determined whether it was in the bast interest, of
the child# then# tc be removed from that foster home,
QUESTION:

Mrs„ Lowry# suppose the district court#

in. another case# says that before the child# surrendered by
its own parents, can be accepted by the State there must ba

Would you complain about that?
MRS„ LOWRY:

You would want that?

MRS» LOWRY: We would want that»

QUESTION: Wall# I mean — in other words # you say
that nothing can be dona concerning the child without a hearing?
MRS * LOWRY:

No# we're not saying nothing can ba

QUESTION:

Well# can the foster parent paddle the

child without a hearing?
MRS. LOWRY;
QUESTION:

Yes# as long as it's not excessive.
That doesn't have anything to do with

liberty at all# does it?
MSS. LOWRY:

No# Your Honor# I don't think it. does.

QUESTION : Did you get a hearing?
QUESTIONs

I didn't get a hearing, no.

MRS. LOWRY:

No, Your Honor, I think that "die only

time a hearing is required is when there is going to be a
substantial deprivation to the children. And we think the
children should not com© into foster car© unnecessarily.
We think that the best thing for a child is to stay v/ith the
natural family under most: circumstances. We have no quarrel
with that.
All we're saying is that after time has passed,
and after a child has been in a relationship for a year or more,
the child then has an interest in the relationship and has an
interest in not being subjected fco arbitrary deprivation of
that relationship.

WeJr@ not talking at all about substantive

standards when we're talking about the natural family.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mrs. Marcus.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MARIA L. MARCUS,
ON BEHALF OF STATE APPELLANTS SMITH, SHAPIRO, ET AL.
MRS. MARCUSs

Your Honor, let me just point to the

record and correct a few errors that war® made in appellees'
argument.
So far as the statistics are concerned, page 90a of
the Appendix contains a projection based on '75 and early * 76

75

figures,, which state that as to New York City there would be
4,200 removals or changes of status s half of those would be
children discharged from foster car©»

So that we've got half

being transferred within, half being discharged out.
Now. in figures by the Child Welfare Information
Service, which is a computerised service that keeps records
on this for the agencies and for the city, 1975 figures were
attached to Int@rvenor9s Reply Brief, and that showed that
of the discharges — and now we*re talking about half of the
transfers, half are within the system and half out — of the
half that goes out, in the year 1975:

of the group of

children in foster care for more than a year, 43.1 percent
returned to the natural parents,
So those arc tie statistical facts as shown by th©
record.
QUESTION;

Is tiie State's argument that there is no

liberty interest, or -that if there is on®, all the process
that's due is being afforded?
MRS. MARCUS:

Both, Your Honor.

There can51, be a

liberty interest because if there ware one it would collide
head-on with th® one already declared by this Court to th©
natural family. First, for 'the reason that I stated before,
that 'the standard has

Wall, what about — does this case only

involve cases where the natural parent wants the children back?

MRS» MARCUS:

No, But the point is that once you

going to change the -QUESTION:

That may be. What if the natural parent

isn’t involved?
MRS. MARCUS:
QUESTION:

Well# —
And it5s just that the Stata has

decided to change the custody?
MRS. MARCUS:

The State cannot guarantee a liberty

interest in a relationship out of which one party can walk
at any time.

The natural parent --

QUESTION:

Well# would you say anybody could complain

— anybody could complain at all if New York decided, Well#
we'va bean giving too much due process here# we*re going to

discretion of agencies# without any hearing, without any

MRS. MARCUS:

Well# that would abrogate 392# of

QUESTION:

MRS, MARCUS:

That it decides to abrogate its

constitutional obligation to provide any foster care services 0
This is —
QUESTION: That isn't what I asked you.

They are

providing it, and they are going to transfer — make, say,
2,000 transfers a year in New York City, from one foster family
to another, and without any hearing, without any notice, with­
out explaining anything at all, and without any judicial review,
Now, you would say they could do that because there is no
liberty interest whatsoever.,
MRS. MARCUS;

Yes, I would say that, although, as a

matter of policy that would be obviously undesirable and would
not be done under New York law.

You cannot have a liberty

interest in a relationship in which on® party has no obliga­
tion whatever to remain with it.

Imagine what would happen

if a natural parent or an adoptive parent, decided to walk out
of a relationship?

They would be jailed, and they would b®

publicly stigmatized.

There is a great difference between an

adoptive and natural parent, and the foster parent here.
There is no obligation.

Mrs. Goldberg was obligated only sc

QUESTION:

Would yax think the State could, without

any notice whatsoever and without any hearing, terminate the
parents* rights once -~
MRS. MARCUS: The natural parents' rights?

QUESTION:

Yes,

78

MRS * MARCUS:

No.

QUESTION: And that is because why?
MRS. MARCUS:

Because this Court has declared that

there is a constitutional right for a natural family to be
together.

And under this Court*s decision, it would not be

possible to abrogat® the rights of the natural parents.
QUESTION:

Do you think the child himself would

have an interest in that interest?

That the child would have

standing
MRS. MARCUS:

As a member of the natural family,

he would partake of that interest. But that does not occur
here.
And I might add, as to the second part of your
question, **QUESTION:

So you agree that the child certainly

has a liberty interest in remaining with his natural family?
MRSe MARCUS:

Yas. This Court has ao declared, and
i

we are under this Court's mandate.
Nov?, in so far as —
QUESTION:

but not with respect to remaining with

any foster family?
MRS. MARCUS:

The fostar family, because of the

complet® difference in that kind of relationship.
QUESTION:

State has custody ©f the child, and —

79

MRS e MARCUS:

The State always has custody in the

case where the child is in foster care» And then# of course#
•the foster parents# by statute# have a mandatory statutory
preference to become the adoptive parents in New York State®
QUESTION: Well# does anyone have standing — would
anybody have any kind of standing whatsoever to —- or any
interest that you would recognise — to question the State's
decision .in terminating a particular foster parent?
MRS. MARCUS:

Well# under tine ~ I want to correct

also a misconception about 392# which came up in appellees'
argument# 392 of the Social Services Law.

It does not have to wait until years and years

This is a pre-removal judicial hearing which is

available.
QUESTION:

And in what court?

MRS. MARCUS: And that is in the Family Court of the
State of New York.
QUESTION:

Well# it's not the United States

District Court?
MRS. MARCUS:

No. This is in the Family Court of the

State of Now York# and of course with the usual appeals and

80

Now* Justice Stevens brought up the question of
whether the decision below contempla'ted the child having some
role—

The decision below didn't say so* but under 392* this

judicial proceeding that we have under the Family Court Act*
the child is there and it's presumed that he will be,
because there’s a stat.ut.ory section in that* 392(6)* which says
that the court may dispense with the presence of the child»
So that, obviously* it’s contemplated that the child will be
there and will be

heard unless the court feels that it’s not

necessary,
