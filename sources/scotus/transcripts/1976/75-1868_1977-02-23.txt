Equalization.
Mr» Hanson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR B» HANSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» HANSON:

Mr* Justice Brennan, distinguished

Associate Justices, and may it please the Court:
National Geographic Society appears before the
Court today to ask that this Court reverse the decision of
the Supereme Court of California, handed down April 1, 1976.
That decision represents the farthest reach in
asserted

use tax collection liability by any state supreme

court since this Court struck down the decision of the
Supreme Court of Illinois in National Bellas Hess v.
Department of Revenue In 1967.
The test for asserted use tax collection liability
set forth in the Supreme Court of California opinion is that
the slightest presence within such taxing state, without
regard to the nature of such presence, is enough for liability
to attach.
This proffered testsjuridically created in
California, has no genesis in the jurisprudence relating to
this subject, nor has any state legislature nor the Federal

4
Congress ever attempted to assert legislatively such a clear-*
cut violation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, as
set forth in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3, of the Constitution
of the United States.
Likewise, the California decision is an egregious
violation of the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution,
as set forth in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution„
This Court has specifically addressed the subject
in this field in Wisconsin v« J. C. Penney Co., referred to
at pages 3, 4 and 8 of the Society's reply brief, in saying
"A state is free to pursue its own fiscal policies, unembar­
rassed by the Constitution, if by the practical operation of
a tax the state has exerted its power in relation to oppor­
tunities which it has given,to protection it has afforded,
the benefits which it has conferred by the fact of being an
orderly, civilized society."
In all cases decided by this Court upholding the
/

sales-related taxing authority of the states, there has been
meaningful in-state exploitation of that state's resident
customers,

duch in-state customer exploitation is clearly a

benefit which satisfies the uue Process requirements of the
Constitution.
The California Court of Appeals, First District,
also stated the relationship requirement succinctly in 1969,
in the case of Montgomery Ward and Company v. State Board of

5
Equalization, referred to at pages 16 and 22 of the Society's
jurisdictional statement, page 22 of the Society's brief, and
page 3 of the Society's reply brief, where the California
Appeals Court said, "The protection afforded and the benefits
conferred must have some relationship to the transaction which
the state seeks to burden,,"
It is interesting to note that the Supreme Court
of California refused to hear this case in 1969 and this
Court denied certiorari in this very case in 1970.
This same question was raised in the Instant case
and most properly answered by the California Court of Appeals,
First district, where in 1975 it stated in pertinent part:
"What did the State of California give in relation to the outof-state sales that the state can ask a return by way of
requiring the Society to collect the use taxes?"
The answer is that the state provided no protections
or benefits which were related to the out-of-state sales,,
All parts of the transactions were conducted through the
Federal mail with the state playing no part and providing no
benefits or protections,
QUfioTICNd:

The magazines that came through the

mails to the customers carried advertising, I suppose, some
of which was sold in California,
MR, HANSON:

No, no advertising was sold in

California, Mr, Justice White,

All advertising that is

solicited -QUESTION:
MRo HANSON:
QUESTION:

I‘ll put it solicited in California,.
Some may have been,
Well, they had two offices for that.,

didn't they?
MR, HANSON:
QUESTION:

That is correct,
They just didn't keep them there for

nothing,
MR, HANSON:
advertising.

No, of course not.

They solicited

The record is clear on that,

QUESTION:

Do you have any idea of what the total

volume of advertising was from California?
MR, HANSON:

It is not in the record, but it Is,

in a total volume in a given year in the period of this case,
which ran about $16 million, California supplied about $1
million,
QUESTION:

If you took the magazine's return from

its advertising and compared it with its magazine sales, the
take from California might be rather substantial,
MR, HANoON:

Not at all.

There were over 800,000

members of the Society in California, and at $8£ the arith­
metic Isn’t very difficult to figure out,
QUESTION:

What did you say the volume of

advertising was?
MR, HANSON:

About $1 million is the most --

QUESTION:
MR.HANSON:

About eight to one?
No, no.

It is much more than that.

Eight hundred thousand times eight gives you a figure of
about — I am not very good on arithmetic today, Mr. Justice
White -- eight hundred thousand times six would be —
QUESTION:

Six million, four hundred thousand.

MR. HANSON:

Six million, four hundred thousand,

right.
QUESTION:

More:,than six to one.

MR0 HANSON:

It's more than six to one, but I

would like to point out another thing while we are on that
subject.
QUESTION:

It is not insignificant, the advertising

return from California.
MR. HANSON:

We didn't say it was insignificant.

It is not significant in the —
QUESTION:

You had two offices in the State of

California to solicit advertising.
MR. HANSON:
else.

The state also furnished something

They furnished a statute which specifically exempted

the magazine and its related offices to an exempt position
within the state from any tax burden,
QUESTION:
MR. HANoUN:
QUESTION:

Well, apparently, it doesn't,
Sir?
Apparently, it doesn't.

8
MR» HANSON:

No* it now asserts that it doesn't

but ~~
QUESTION:

That's the way it has been construed,

isn't it?
MR» HANSON:

The Supreme Court of California has

construed it that way.
QUESTION:
MR» HANSON:
QUESTION:
MR» HANSON:
QUESTION:

Actually what the law is then?
In California, until this Court -We are bound by it, too»
No, you are not, sir.
Well, we are bound by what the California

law discovers.
MR, HANSON:

I would say not If the California law,

as stated by the Supreme Court of California, is clearly
contrary to the Constitution of the United States.
QUESTION:
MR» HANSON:
QUESTION:

That's a different question»
That's why we are here»
I know, but you said that. California

furnished the law which exempted this.

The California

Supreme Court said it didn't.
QUESTION: That was its interpretation of that law.
/

We respectfully disagree with them and that, again,
is one of the reasons we are here.
Now, the complete opinion of the Court of Appeals
that I referred to

9
QUESTION:

You really don't ask us to differ, with

the California Supreme Court on construing its own statute,
do you?
MR, HA No ON:

I don't think that that statute is

going to be determinative of what's decided in this case.
The complete opinion of that bourt is set forth as
Appendix B to the Society's jurisdictional statement,
beginning at page 17(a):

"As admitted by the State Board of

Equalization on page 10 of Its brief, the only benefits
afforded the Society by the State of California relate to
the Society's advertising solicitation activities,"
QUESTION:

Mr, Hanson, does the record tell us

whether these sales are made on credit or does the customer
send a check in when he places the order?
MR* HANSON:
QUESTION:

You mean the advertising sales?
No, I am talking about the sales *-

the taxes imposed on globes and maps and things like that.
MR, HANSON:

On that subject, Mr, Justice Stevens,

the record states very clearly that they are either cash
with order or they are on credit.
QUESTION:

So there can be credit sales and,

presumably, it would be possible for collection activities
thereafter to take place within the state of California?
MR, HANSON:

That subject was covered very

thoroughly in National Bellas Hess, and it was not determinative

10

there, as we know»
Clearly, If California chose to impose a tax on
services, the Due Process test set forth in Wisconsin v.
J. C„ Penney, referred to earlier, would be satisfied»
The State of California, however, has chosen not to
impose a tax on such activities.

And its election to not so

tax those activities does not entitle the state constitutionally
to tax as a more convenient alternative other totally un­
related out~of-state activities of the Society for which the
State of California has clearly given nothing for.which it
can ask return.
The questions and positions of the parties in this
case have been thoroughly briefed by both parties.

The

National Geographic Society will not reargue those papers.
Rather, having stated the two constitutional questions at the
outset, the Society will endeavor to outline the basic
fallacy of the State Board *s case and point out the effect
that an affirmation of the California decision would have
throughout this country.
As has been ably pointed out In the amicus curiae
brief of the Direct Mail Marketing Association, Inc», urging
reversal of the California court’s decision, beginning on
page 3;

"Some forty-five states and the District of Columbia

require out-of-state sellers to collect use taxes on sales
made to residents of the state,"

11
As has also been pointed out, there has been no
uniformity in the state statutes on this subject, and the
Federal Congress has not yet enacted a uniform sales and use
tax act, although extensive hearings have been held*
Both the state and we have referred to those
hearings in parts of our brieffe and in parts of our reply
brief.
Thus, the only protection for the Society and others
similarly affected, is to rely on the Federal Constitution
and this, the highest Court of our land.
The exact language of the test California would
have this Court adopt is as follows:

"Where an out-of-state

seller conducts a substantial mail order business with
residents of a state, imposing a use tax on such purchasers
and the seller's connection with the taxing state is not
exclusively by means of the instruments of interstate
commerce, the slightest presence within such taxing state,
independent of any connection through interstate commerce

J

will permit the state constitutionally to impose on the
seller the duty of collecting the use tax from such mail
order purchasers and the liability for failure to do so,"
To us, this proposed test is little short of
ludicrous.

Does this mean that if the Society sends a writer

and a photographer to California, that the state can impose
use tax collection liability, based on their presence in the

12
state?
Suppose a writer is a resident of California and
submits a story to the Society which is accepted for publica­
tion,

Does that make the Society liable?
The answer should be, resoundingly, no.

Yet. the

state might well argue to the contrary were this proposed
test be permitted to stand.
We used an example in our reply brief of the
Society owning a parking lot in California; not operating it,
merely owning it.

Under the state's view of this case, that

would immediately attach us to use tax liability, although
there is absolutely no connection between that and the sales
that are discussed in this case.
This Court must face the real test of use tax
collection liability.

This is the first case before this

Court where a state court has asserted that a non-sales
related presence in state, that is, one tjhat has no connection
with, or relationship to, any sales whatsoever will justify
imposition of use tax collection liability on interstate
sales,
Neither the state, nor anyone else, can point to a
single case where such liability has attached, absent some
direct retail sales-related activity in state,
QUESTION:

Mr, Hanson., you haven't yet mentioned

or conceded or covered the fact in this case that there were,

13
In fact, retail sales related activities in the state during
part of the taxable period.
MR0 HANSON:
QUESTION:
MR. HANSON:

During a period of about nine months
Yes.
-- which the California Court of

Appeals regarded as de minimis.
QUESTION:
MR. HANSON:

Maybe so.
And the California Supreme Court said

that it wasn't necessary to even consider that.
QUESTION:

No.

The California Supreme Court

didn't find it necessary even to consider that in order to
rule against you, but even if we disagree with you

even

though we fully agreed with you on the argument you are now
making, that unless there is a sales-related activity within
the state, then Bellas Hess controls this.

Nonetheless, in

this case, there xvas a sales-related activity.
MR. HANSON:
QUESTION:
MR. HANSON:

Let me approach —
I trust you are going to get to that.
I am coming to it, but let me address

it for a moment now.
There is a reason as to why the state board and
we agreed to set up two periods for the courts to consider.
We set up one period where there were sales activities,
minor as they were, In the San Francisco and Los Angeles
offices

14
QUESTION:

Of the very same kind of items that are

sold here by mail order»
MR. HANSON: That is correct»
And, in turn, we set up the second period, beginning
with the quarter that ended in September, where those
activities had ceased»

They actually ceased on May the 6th,

and we paid the tax on the period where we had sales-related
activities and did not ask for a refund.
refund of the tax assessed

We asked for a

for the period in which the sales»

related activities had ceased.
There was only a period from the 1st of August,
1963, to May 6, 1964, in which there were any sales-related
activities in this.

There were never any before and there

have never been any since,

but I'll cover that further as we

go along»
In every case where liability has attached, there
have been either retail sales outlets in state or sales
persons soliciting orders In state, or, as in the case of
Standard Steel Co. v. Washington Revenue Dept., referred to at
page 21 of the Society's jurisdictional statement, page 28 of
the Society's brief, and page 17 of the Society's reply brief,
In a case which we think was rightly decided, an in-state
resident employee, someone who Is living in the state,who has
something to do with the sales involved.
was an engineer.

In this case, he

He consulted with the end user of his

15
Company's products and he also worked with his company's
engineers, at least three cays every six weeks on the very
subject of the sales which involved the Boeing Aircraft
Company. Guiding both the end user and his company's
engineers on the needed technical requirements, he also acted
as a trouble-shooter if something went wrong with their
materials,

He was —
QUESTION:

I want to be sure about that.

You do concede the correctness, then of Press Steel?
MR, HANSON:

We do, indeed.

We do not think it

applicable in this case.
The Society's advertising solicitors made no retail
sales -- I might say, Mr, Justice Blackmun, we stated that in
our reply brief, in the concluding part of it where we
discuss the State of New York's amicus, which made much of
Washington-»Press Steelg and we stated there we felt it was
rightly d ecid ed «‘
QUESTION:

That case was vigorously argued here

and I just want to be sure -MR, HANSON:

I know it was, sir, but we think,

based on the factual statement that the record shows, it was
rightly d ecid ed,
The Society's advertising solicitors made no retail
sales cf goods in California or anywhere else,

The Society's

advertising officers in California were restricted in authority

16

and function solely to the solicitation of national
advertising copy for the exempt magazine* except for the
brief period of August 1* 1963* to May 6* 1964»
As noted on page 7 and 8 of the Society's
jurisdictional statement* and page 26 of the Society's brief*
"The California Court of Appeals found the few sales in this
t

period to be deminimis- and the Supreme Court of California
disregarded these sales for purposes of its decision,"
I think it might be well to note just what the
percentage involved in the period at that time was.
In the reply brief of the Appellant, if you look
at page 11* you will find a discussion of the Miller Brothers*
sales* which were rather interesting* where in Miller Brothers
v, Maryland, there were $12*000 worth of sales* of which eight
were delivered in Maryland by a Miller Brothers' truck.
That x^as a five to four decision.
When we come to the Society's picture* the San
Francisco office sold the sum of $679*20 worth of goods,
The Los Angeles office was $2,161,85; while during that
period from August 1* 1963; to May 6* '64* the Society sold,
through interstate commerce* to California* $452*470 worth
of goods.

That's on the bottom of page 13 of the reply brief.

That figure was „63$ of the volume of mail order sales* the
amount that x^as actually sold in two offices.

One of those

offices was on the 10th story of an 18-story building* and the

17
other was, at that time, on the second story of a two-story
building, and is now on about the 15th or 20th floor of a
28-story building.

They aren't designed for retail sales*

and never have been.
The California Court of Appeals — the Society took
no mail orders in California.

The Society had no door-to -

door solicitors in California seeking mail orders to be filled
outside California,

The Society had no local advertising* by

either written or electronic media, advertising its products
in California.

The Society made use of no local flyers or

handbills for the solicitation of mail orders from California
res id ents,
In this connection, the California Court of Appeal
expressly stated the solicitation of advertisements.to
appear in the magazine had no effect upon whether California
residents would purchase products of the Society which they
saw advertised in the magazine or in mailed circulars.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hanson, suppose throughout this

period the magazine had been sold on newsstands or over the
counter in the state, although there was no in-state activity
with respect to the mail order sales,
MR. HANSON:

I think, again, it would depend on

how they got to the newsstands, as you, perhaps, know,
QUESTION:

Let's assume that National Geographic

sold them out of their own establishment.

13
MR» HANSON:

Well, you mean that they would have

newsstands that they maintained in California?
QUESTION:

Yes*

MR® HANSON:

I think It would be a completely

different case*
QUESTION:

I know it would be different, but how

what would be the result?
MR, HANSON:

I think that in all probability that

a use tax would apply,
QUESTION:

Even though there was no in-state

activity with respect to the specific sales to be taxed?
MR, HANSON:

No, but we would have had to at that

point been licensed to do business in the state.

They would

be operating under the protection of the state on a substantlal business.
magazine,

We are advertising the goods in the

And at that point, I think that -QUESTION:

Even though there needn't be in-state

activity with respect to the specific sales to be taxed,
as long as there is some other retail activity.
MR, HANSON:

Well, let's take a look at Nelson v.

Sears Roebuck,
QUESTION:
MR., HANSON:

You accept that decision, I gather?
We do accept it.

We do not accept its

application by the Supreme Court of California.
QUESTION:

I understand.

19
MR, HANSON:

In Nelson, also the records in this

Court, which we went through very thoroughly, point out that
Sears Roebuck maintain twelve stores in the state and that
their volume of sales which appears, I think, about page
12 of our brief, showed that Sears Roebuck, in our reply
brief, the volume of sales with the in-state stores was
$5*040,000 and the sales by mail — it's at the top of page
14

$5,080,000 in the sales in the stores and $5,900,000

in the mail order sales, and they were selling exactly the
same goods in both,
And, in addition to that, the records show that
a number of those sales were actually processed in the retail
stores»

So they were obviously involved in that, and

in

addition, in Nelson, they of course, were licensed by the
state to do business in the state, the state had jurisdiction
over them4
QUESTION:

So you would reach the same result, I

suppose, if geographic — Well, let us assume in Nelson the
local retail sales made by Sears Roebuck never was of the
same goods that were on the mail order.

I suppose you would

get the same result.
MR* HANSON:
really differ

I don't see how the result would

because of the involvement of the organization,

or the company, in -QUESTION:

Would you call the local sale of

20
advertising retail, or not?
MRo HANSON:
it is not a 3ale.

No, I would not*

It is solicitation,»

In the first place,
I am sorry»

I am not

quibbling with you,
QUESTION:

That's all right»

I understand what you

mean»
MR* HANSON:
Washington*
here*

The advertising is all sent to

It cannot go in the magazine until it's approved

There is no contract made there*

A man goes and tries

to interest these people ~QUESTXON:

But it is a solicitation for a sale at

retail»
MR* HANSON:

It Is the solicitation for the sale
*

of services., and this is not the sale of retail goods*
There Is a recent case that is not pertinent here
today, but I think the Virginia Pharmacy case in which we
finally got to what I hoped was my view of how advertising
matters should be treated by the Court, was treated by It,
as opposed to the way the Pittsburgh Press case was treated,
QUESTION:

I suppose if the advertising transactions

had been completed within California, that would have been
subject to a California sales tax?
MR* HANSON:

No, again, because it Is a sale

of services and California has not
QUESTION:

Well, Is there an exemption —

21
MR. HANSON:

There is,

That's Section

6362 of the

California Code, specifically —
QUESTION:

They don't treat it like' a laundry?

MRo HANSON:

No.

Not a bit.

It is not a can of

beans„
The Society made no use of local handbills or
flyers and were it not for the existence of the two
advertising offices, this case would be factually on all
fours with National Bellas Hess.

It would appear to lie

between Miller Brothers and National Bellas Hess, but much
closer to the latter.
The solicitations made by the society for the sale
of its products or through its magazine and circulars in the
Interstate mails.

In effect, the magazine was the Society's

catalogue, and the difference between it and Bellas Hess is
that Bellas Hess had a catalogue with about 5,000 items
advertised in it and a typical mail order house.
In the two exhibits in the record here, the Society
had a three-quarter page ad in one issue and a quarter page
ad in another, and they do not advertise these goods in each
one of the magazines that is put out.
In light of these facts, It is difficult to under­
stand how the State of California reached the conclusion it
did unless it believed that the need for revenue at the state
level is assumed to be as all important as alluded to by the

22
State of New York as amicus curiae in support of the State
of California,
The main point in that brief centers on the need of
states for revenue and, in effect, asks that the California
Supreme Court’s test be accepted for that helps the state's
revenue needs.
Certainly, no revenue measure can b.e set solely on
need, disregarding constitutional principles.
The states have many ways to obtain revenues, with­
out violating the Constitution of the United States,
The other major hurdle that this -~
QUESTION:
completely clear,

Mr, Hanson, just so I've got it
Are you relying entirely on the Commerce

Clause or do you also rely on the Due Process Clause?
MR. HANSON:

We rely on them together, and the

reason for that is that every case involving this subject
which this Court has addressed has’ combined the two together,
«

QUESTION-:
MR .HANSON:

So.,you rely on them both,
Yes, sir.

The other major hurdle that the state must overcome
to place use tax collection liability on any retailer is to
show that the in-state activities of the retailer are related
to the retail sales sought to be taxed.
Stated another way, California must show that the
in-state activities are not dissociated from the operations

23
which generate the alleged use-tax collection liability.
It must be remembered that the California decision
is grounded entirely on non-sales related activities.
No clearer case for dissociation exists than here.
Starting with Connecticut General Life Insurance
Company In 1928, cited by the amicus In support on pages 8 and

9 of its brief, Norton Company in 1951 and American Oil
Company in 1965* this Court has consistently refused to
assess tax liability where the in~state activities were held
to be dissociated from the activities generating the asserted
tax liability.
The basic flaw in the Supreme Court of California's
opinion was pointed out on pages 27 and 28 of the Society's
brief.

The California court tried to justify its holding

by misstating the language of National Bellas Hess.

That

case clearly stands for the proposition that there must be
in-state contact with customers before there can be a usetax collection liability for mail order sales, and that a
totally non-sales related contac/b by the out of state seller
with the state will not suffice.
QUESTION:

You mean an in-state connection with

the customers to whom the sales sought to be taxed are made?
MR9 HANSON:
QUESTION:
MR9 HANSON:

Yes, Your Honor,
How about Nelson?
No problem with Nelson,

There was an

24
in-state contact,
QUESTION:

Well, not with the customers to whom the

mail orders were made,
MR, HANSON:

Well, there was, indeed, according to

the record,
QUESTION:

Not with the customers to whom the

mail order sales were made,
MR0 HANSON:' There was an in-state contact, as
justified in the court's view, and I think rightly so ~~
Local advertising was carried on by Sears Roebuck of the
exact same product that was involved in the mail order sales,
They were carried on both radio and written media advertising
and, in addition, they processed many of these orders in the
local retail stores in Iowa,
QUESTION:
MR, HANSON:
QUESTION:

Well, they taxed those, all right,
They taxed them both,
There wasn't any argument about, those,

but the mail order sales
MR, HANSON:

But the mail order sales contact was

held to be the advertising and the fact that the same
articles were being sold in the retail stores that were being
sold by mail order and that the presence of Sears Roebuck in
Iowa and the understanding of the citizenry of Iowa, that
made that the final concluding item,
QUESTION:

You give emphasis to the selling of the

25

same products.

Suppose that factor were absent?

MR. HANSON:

What then?

I would say that under the Nelson v.

Sears doctrine, with twelve stores in-state, and a national
organization heavily flooding the state with other products,
realistically you know it doesn't work that way.
Were it to work that way, as you posed it,
Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think that there would be certainly
a tax that could be — a use-tax collection liability could
be assessed.
QUESTION:

So that that factor is not Important,

QUESTION:

No,

I

If you read pages 27 and 28 of our brief,

they very beautifully elided a sentence out of it, and we
put the right sentence back in the way Mr, Justice Stewart

27
wrote that opinion»
It is clear that under the prior decisions of this
Court no taxing nexus has been found to exist in the absence
of meaningful, in-state sales related activity.

Under the

facts of this case, no such in “-state sales related activity
exists which would permit California to make the National
Geographical Society a tax collector.
Accordingly, it is most respectfully urged that
the decision of the Supreme Court of California be reversed
and the decision of the California Court of Appeals be
reinstated with whatever reinforcement this honorable Court
deems appropriate.
Thank you very much.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

Mr. Plant.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP M. PLANT, ESQ.,
FOR THE RESPONDENT
MR. PLANT:

Mr. Justice Brennan, and may it please

the Court :
The Appellant has referred repeatedly to the opinion
of the California State Supreme Court.
I respectfully submit that we are here before this
Court on the facts of this case, and it should be viewed In
that context.
On the facts of this case, the issue before this
Court pertains to the constitutionality of a California statute!

23

which imposes a use tax collection requirement on a foreign
retailer having a place of business within the taxing juris­
diction .
This is not unusual.

The 1969 Special Subcommittee

on State Taxation of Interstate Commerce found that from seven
to thirty-three of the thirty-six sales tax states then
reporting to its survey had similar provisions.
Also following this 1965 report there were re­
peated attempts in introductions of bills into Congress to
regulate the state taxation of commerce, among the several
states, none of which passes, but al3 of which bills provided
that the ownership or leasing of property within the taxing
jurisdiction would support the imposition of a use tax
collection requirement.
As Mr» Hanson has said, there are two constitutional
challenges to the statute, hue Process ,and the Commerce
Clause.

Both of these provisions are based on principles of

fairness.
The Interstate Commerce Clause is satisfied if
the state tax in question does not constitute an undue burden
upon the commerce among the several states.
The hue Process Clause is satisfied if the state has
given something for which it can ask return, that is, if the
benefits given and the opportunities conferred bear a fiscal
ielation ko the exercion of the taxing power by the state

29

We subruit that the requirement of the presence of a
business office within the taxing jurisdiction as a condition
precedent to the requirement of a foreign retailer collecting
a use tax satisfies both of these tests.
Firstly, it does not constitute an undue burden on
interstate commerce.

At the outset, it is appropriate to note

that the purpose of the use tax is not to discriminate against
the foreign retailer, but rather to place the foreign retailer
under a tax, equal in amount, to that borne by the local
retailer who is subject to the sales tax.
QUESTION:

If these two offices were in Arizona,

I take it you would concede that the California use tax does
not apply?
MR. PLANT:

That is correct, Your Honor, that

would be National Bellas Hess.
QUESTION:

Suppose the Society, from its office in

Arizona, sent a salesman to solicit advertising into
California?
MR. PLANT:

In that situation, the ■'••elationship is

such that under analogy to Scripto we might well assert a
tax.

We might say that the solicitation of the advertising

supports the magazine, which in turn is the primary vehicle
through which the society advertised its offerings of maps,
atlases, globes and books, moreover, it constituted the
mailing list used bjr the society in soliciting these mail

30

order sales to California residents.

And, finally, the

good will established by the prestige of the Society's name
carried over to enhance its sales of these maps, atlases,
globes and books.
QUESTION:

That would be an extension of Scripto,

however, which would only directly support the taxation of
the advertising.
MR. PLANT:
QUESTION:

Thatb correct. Your Honor.
Is there any significance in the fact
i

that you don't require them a license to do business in
California ?
MR0 PLANT:
QUESTION:
MR, PLANT:

Well, Your Honor -Is there any?
We submit it does not.

There are

several cases, notable among them, Sears Roebuck, and its
companion case of Nelson v. Montgomery Ward, which make
reference to retailers being registered to do business.
Now, on the other hand, this Court has decided in
such cases as General Trading and Felt & Tarrant that there
is sufficient nexus to support such a tax in the absence of
registration to do business.
Our position with regard to that -QUESTION:

Mr. Deputy Attorney General, while I

have you interrupted, I take it from what you said that the
solicitation of retail sales and the accomplishment of those

31
sales for the nine months

period that has been mentioned

is of no importance to your case.
MR, PLANT:
QUESTION:
MR» PLANT:

The —
The sales of articles -There were solicitation of advertise­

ments to be placed in the magazine»
QUESTION:

I am drawing a distinction between

solicitation for advertisements, on the one hand, and the
0

sale.of goods within California, on the other»
The California Supreme Court said the sales of
goods for the nine months period were de minimis, as .1
understand it»
MR» PLANT:

The Supreme Court held that it need

not consider them because it found taxation independent of
that ground»
QUESTION:

What I am asking you is whether you

consider those sales of goods relevant to your position?
MR» PLANT:

I would consider them relevant in two

particular's, Your Honor.

In the first instance, we consider

them relevant because we feel they are not de minimis»

We

feel that to the extent they overlap the first taxable
quarter, they constitute approximately 2»3% °f the taxes
during that particular time when the over-the-counter sales
overlapped with the mail order sales here disputed»
2,3$ which we think more than

That's

32

Furthermore, we notice that in the second quarter,
after they discontinued over-the-counter sales their mail
order sales dropped off from $45*000 to $38,000*
do we say there might be some significance to that
and we take the position there should be.
Secondly, the fact that they made over-the-counter
sales is very material to the question of whether or not they
were registered to do business*
Vie submit, as one of our arguments, that they did,
in fact, by stipulation, do business in California, and that
they should not be rewarded for their failure to register by
having a more restrictive liability in regard to use tax
collection.
QUfioTUN:

Even if you are correct on both those

points and even if, further, the fact that Intrastate retail
sales were made of these same items during the period, even
though a fairly small percentage of the total, should bring
this case within Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck, that would
still be true only for that taxable period during which the
intrastate retail sales vjere made*

It wouldn't continue

forever, would it?
MR. PLANT:

That would be correct, Your Honor*

But, as we will further develop our argument, we
don't feel, that the presence of a local retail operation is
essential to the concept

33
QUESTION:

No, but if it is., it would give your

state power to tax the, impose this use tax only for a
specific taxable period, wouldn't it?
MR, PLANT:
QUESTION:

That's correct. Your Honor,
You can see that, that it doesn't damn

these people forever,
MR, PLANT:

To the extent that it is essential that

they have a retail activity in the state, that is correct,
Your Honor,
The Lue Process Clause is satisfied if the state
has given something for which it can ask return, if the
benefits given and the opportunities conferred bear fiscal
relation to the taxing power exerted by the jurisdiction.
Now, under the Commerce Clause, it does not
constitute an undue burden.

As I earlier noted, the purpose

of the use tax is that of competitive parity.
Next, I think we should consider the holding of
this Court In Nationa1 Bellas Hess g

In that Court, they

found violation of Cue Process and a violation of the
Commerce Clause in a purely mail order situation, that is to
say, where the foreign retailers only contacts with the
taxing jurisdiction were through the use of the U,d0 mails
and common carriers.
Now, the Court in considering the Commerce Clause
ground, made reference to the fact that if an interstate

34
mail order retailer had to file a separate return and a
different rate under different administrative requirements in
every state, political subdivision, local county and school
district, that there would result an administrative entangle­
ment which would constitute an undue burden on interstate
commerce.
In the instant situation, we are only seeking to
impose a use tax requirement on a foreign retailer maintaining
a place of business within our state.
Now, the 1965 opecial subcommittee on state Taxation
of Interstate Commerce specifically concluded that the vast
majority of mail order retailers have business offices only
in two or fewer states.
For this reason, there would.not result the
administrative entanglement productive of the undue burden
condemned in National Bellas Hess.
Moreover, we should note that California has a
centralized collection procedure whereby its local use taxes
are collected by the state, so there is only one collector.
Turning to the Due Process Clause, as noted earlier,
it asked no more than a fair return.

We feel' that conditioning

the imposition of the use tax collection liability upon the
maintenance of a place of business within California meets
that test, because by maintaining places of business the
foreign retailer necessarily substantially draws upon the

35
benefits conferred and the opportunities given by the state»
In this regard., it is interesting to compare the
Standard Press Steel, case»

In the Standard Press Steel case,

they found sufficient nexus to support the collection of a
$33,000 tax liability on the basis of one engineering con­
sultant who worked out of his home»
If that meets the Due Process text, with regard to
the question of state opportunities and benefits conferred,
then surely the maintenance of two employee staffed advertising;
offices In California would do likewise»
There are also benefits that do accrue to a foreign
retailer purely by virtue of mail order sales»
Now, while it is true, that National Belias Hess
held that that alone is Insufficient, It nevertheless is
noteworthy

that the Court, in General Trading Company, did

observe that the foreign retailers doing a mail order business
benefits by virtue of the fact that the state protection makes
possible the California purchaser's use of the product, which
is a sine qua non of the sale itself.

Therefore, there is that

benefit.
Further, there is a benefit that California
facilities are available to the foreign retailer if, as here,
there is a possible credit sale problem where they need to
collect delinquent accounts.
do even in a mail, order business, there are benefits„

36
albeit insufficient in and of themselves, we feel that it is
one leg up toward supporting taxation.
The other thing that we would like to observe is that
the Society did, indeed, exploit the California market in
substantial manner with their mail order sales, and this is
a factor to be considered.
The Court, in Miller Brothers v„ Maryland, held
that where there is no intentional, continuous,systematic
exploitation of the market of the jurisdiction attempting to
impose a tax, there is insufficient nexus.

However, it is

also recognized that where there is exploitation that is an
important factor.
We feel that the society, as a matter of stipulation,
had $452,470.00 worth of mail order sales from the period
August 1, 1963, to May 6, 1964.
There is pending, as reflected in the pleadings,
a determination by the State of California for subsequent
periods that covers a nine-year period and the board has been
assessed for mail order sales exceeding $3,500,000.
QUESTION:

How much of that came to either of these

two offices?
MR. PLANT:

As regards the assessment I just referred

to, none.
As regards the amount over-the-counter from those
offices

37
QUESTION:

Well, what you are saying is that but

for the offices you wouldn't have any case.
MR. PLANT:
QUESTION:
MR» PLANT:

Well, Your Honor —
Yes or no?
I am saying that the advertising

soliciting activities support the tax»

I am saying that we

don't need those over-the-counter —
QUESTION:

Could you advertise and solicit through

the mail to get that tack?
MR. PLANT:

As long as you don't maintain a place

of business within the taxing jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Even though the business has nothing to

do with the subscription.
MR, PLANT:

Well, that's correct, Your Honor.

We

don't feel the need of a relational requirement.
QUESTION:
Brothers.

Mr. Plant, you have referred to Miller

So you think that the result below in this case is

entirely compatible with the result in Miller Brothers?
MR. PLANT:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

I think that

Miller Brothers only stands for the proposition that where
there is no intentional exploitation of the local market,
that there cannot be nexus.

*

Miller Brothers and National Bellas Hess, together,
can be read as conveying the message that nexus to support
taxation is a mix of physical presence in a jurisdiction and

38
exploitation of the local market0
Bellas Hess says you have to have some physical
presence and Miller Brothers says you have to'have intentional
exploitation.
QUESTION:

Well, they sent their truck over into

Maryland and serviced their product over there, didn’t they?
MR» PLANT:

That's true, but that was for

deliveries that, according to the Court, were resultant from
the residents of Maryland going across the border to the
store In the other 3tate and ordering material, and then they
delivered it with their truck.
But, as the Court in Scripto v, Carson clarified
Miller Brothers v. Maryland, they said that Miller Brothers
did not go to Maryland, the Marylanders went to Miller
Brothers, and that was emphasized»
QUESTION:

I am not being critical, I am just

wondering whether the decisions up here have been entirely
consistent.

That’s really what I.am saying, I guess»

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, if Geographic

takes those two offices out right now, it's the end?
MR# PLANT:

If they take their advertising soliciting

offices right now, they are not liable for use tax collection
liability, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Unless,! thought you 3aid a while ago,

they sent advertising solicitors into the state.

39
MR» PLANT:

That's correct.

That was in response

to a hypothetical that they pulled them out and they put
somebody else in.

But if they pull out their advertising

soliciting offices now, they have nothing»
Now, I would like to touch upon the reason
we feel that qualification to do business should not
Influence the result in this.
First of all, as I mentioned, it is stipulated
that the Society did do business and they shouldn't be heard
to benefit because of the fact that they did not register
as they should have done.
Secondly, as a matter of- logic, the benefits
accruing to the foreign retailer or the burdens, if any,
imposed on interstate commerce will remain the same whether
or not they went through the formality of registering to do
business.
QUESTION:

Whether or not a company needs to

qualify to do business is a matter of local statutory law.
It has nothing to do with the constitutional issue.
MR. PLANT:

Thatfs correct, Your Honor, but there

are references,like in the Sears Roebuck case, to the fact
that the foreign retailer there had -- was registered to do
business.
I feel that the formal act of qualifying to do
business should be irrelevant.

40
I'd like to make one further comment on that point,
and that is, as a matter of policy, the 1965 Special
Subcommittee noted that there is a severe compliance problem
with foreign retailers not registering to do business in
/

states at that time»
I think that if this Court were to increase a
foreign retailer’s susceptibility to taxation, by virtue of
the fact that he voluntarily had registered to pay state
taxes, that would only encourage evasion of the state
requirement,

So we feel it is inadvisable on that ground.

Now, addressing, briefly, the relation point, that
is, the Appellant's position that the local activity must be
related to the transaction tax.
QUESTION:

Well, no, that the local activity must

be retail sales activity, that's the extent of the submission,
as I understood it,
MR. PLANT:

If there is no requirement that the

local activity bear a relationship to the transaction tax,
then the question becomes:

What possible difference could it

make what the local activity is?
QUESTION:

It doesn't seem in terms --

Retail sales activity.

Because that's the

subject of this tax,
MR0 PLANT:

That's right, but we are taxing these

mail order sales.
QUESTION:

Take the hypothetical case that the

41

local activity was the writing of an article in California by
a California author for National Geographic,

That would be

clearly local activity, he writing the article, a resident
of California writing an article for submission and publication
in National Geographic.

That would clearly be local activity,

and that under the phraseology of the Supreme Court of
California's opinion, would be enough to constitutionally
permit the state to impose use tax on these mail order sales,
MR. PLANT:

Well, X think the language of the

California State Supreme Court decision has to be read in
context of the statute which it was applying. And the statute
which it was applying, would not, I don't believe, allow
taxation in an instance such as that.
The statute in question said that the tax could be
imposed on a retailer doing business within the state, and
went on to define doing business within the state to mean
a retailer who established a sales office, warehouse, several
other things, or any other place of business in the state.
And, so, therefore, what we are really looking at
here is not how you could hypothetically expand ad infinitum
the dicta of the California Supreme Court decision, but the
validity of the California statute.
QUESTION:

It is not the dicta, it is the test that

it framed.
MR. PLANT:

It is the test that it framed but

42
framed it whether or not the statute -~
QUESTION:

MR. PLANT:
position.

That's right# Your Honor.

That's our

We should just look to the facts of this case.
QUESTION:

Your statement at the very outset cf

your argument -- You are not necessarily defending all the
language of the Supreme Court of California.

Lid I misunder­

stand you?
MR. PLANT:

No# you did not# Your Honor.

We just feel on the facts of this particular case
that it is correctly decided.
With regard to the question of whether or not the

43
local activity need be related to the transaction tax, our
position is, in essence, that physical presence within the
taxing jurisdiction should be enough, and we can draw an
analogy to the area of in personam jurisdiction over foreign
corporations, whether or not they can be sutjected to suit.
And we note that in Perkins v. Ben Gay Mining
Company in 342 U.S., it was held that a foreign corporation,
having administrative activities within a taxing jurisdiction,
was held subject to suit for a cause of action arising outside
the state, which cause of action bore no relationship,
whatsoever, to the in-state activity.
Several commentators have recognized the similarity
of the Due Process requirements in the area of taxation, on
the one hand, and in the area of In personam jurisdiction,
on the other hand„
QUESTION:

Don't you have to find some nexus?

For example, if Survey'Graphic set up a rest home
and golf club for its employees in Palm Springs, you wouldn't
put a sales tax on them, would you?
MR. PLANT:

Well, under our statute, I don't think

we'would, but I would think
QUESTION:
MR. PLANT:

-

It has to have some nexus, doesn't it?
I don't know that it constitutionally

is required to relate to the transaction.

I think if you can

show that you are in the state and that you are deriving

44
benefits -~
QUESTION:

Why do you want to take on that big load?

You don’t need it.
MR0 PLANT:

Well, it's not a matter of taking on a

big load, as much as it is trying to equalise the position of
our local retailers, vis-a-vis our foreign retailers, and the
ones most affected by this decision are the big ones.
When you limit the requirement to just having tax,
use tax collection liabilities upon a foreign retailer with
a business office in the state, you are looking only at the
rather large foreign retailers who are the biggest competitive
threat that the intent of the use tax was to neutralize.
We wish to argue that the dissociation test which, as.
set forth in American Oil Company v, Neill, should not be
applied in this case, and that involved an excise tax, the
incidence of which fell on the foreign retailer, whereas, In
this case, the incidence of the tax is on the local user, and
the foreign retailer is required to collect the tax.
Now, this Court has, in several cases, recognized
this distinction, particularly in McLeod y. uilworth and the
Norton Company case.

It Is a logical distinction because, in

one case, the foreign retailer bears the brunt of the tax and
he is neither authorized nor required, as a matter of law, to
pass that burden on to his purchaser.
In the instance of a use tax collection situation,

however, the foreign retailer is but a conduit and he is to
pass the tax on to the local user,
QUESTION:

He is ultimately liable, though, isn't

he?
MR, PLANT:

If he defaults in his performance, as

such, he is ultimately liable, that's correct, Your Honor.
I have only two matters to touch upon, before closing.
Comments were made regarding the periodical
exemption.

The periodical exemption is set forth at page 3

of the Appendix to the Brief of Appellee, and it merely
provides that the magazines or all the materials that go into
make up the magazines, as a periodical, are exempt from
sales and use tax.

And it has always been our consistent

position that where, by state legislative grace, we exempt
a particular activity from sales and use tax, It does not
mean that we blindfold ourselves to consider that as a
factor in supporting the use tax collection liability that's
appropriate on the mail order sales.
We noted that the Society conceded that if the
magazine were sold from its own newsstands in California that
the disputed tax on the mail order sales would be proper.
We say, then, why not extend it to this situation where there
are advertising soliciting offices?

Both activities would

equally draitf upon the benefits conferred by the state.

There

would, in either event, be no greater burden on interstate

commerce
It would then seem that the character of the local
contact* if it need not be related to the transaction taxed,
is fairly irrelevant, so long as it substantially draws upon
the benefits that the state has conferred.
In summary, we feel that the requirement of a use
tax collection liability on foreign retailers maintaining a
place of business within the taxing jurisdiction, meets the
requirements of the Due Process and Commerce Clause test.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN:

Thank you, gentlemen,,

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:42 o’clock, p.m„, the case in the
above~entitled matter was submitted.)
