ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY?

Mr. Chief Justice* iind may it pleas® the

Courti
This case is here on the government's petition for
writ of certiorari to the United STates Court of Appeals for
th® Sixth Circuit, which affirmed an order of the district
court suppressing certain evidence obtained during wire
interceptions as to the five respondents in this case.
There are two separate issues * one of which relates
to three of the respondents, and concerns the obligations of
the government to identify certain persons in the application*
and of the court to identify them in th® order authorizing the
wire interception.
Th© second concerns the obligation of -the government
to supply names to the district court for purposes of discre­
tionary service of inventory notice after an interception has
terminated.
And underlying both these issues, assuming th©
government did not live up to its responsibilities under th©
statute, is the question whether suppression of th© evidence

4
is an appropriate remedy.
In November 1972, a federal district judge in
Cleveland authorized the interception of wire communications
relating to gambling offenses over four telephones,

The

application for this authorisation was supported by an
extensive affidavit, which takes up 48 pages of the Appendix
in tills Court.
The principal targets of the investigation were three
suspected bookmakers, Kotoch, Spaganlo and Florea.

And both

the application and the court order named them, as well as
three ether individuals ,who were expected to be overheard
during tee interceptions, discussing the gambling enterprises.
Several weeks after the termination of the initial
interception, application was made to the court for author!sation for an extension of the interception on two of tee four
original phones, and also for monitoring of a third phone.
Th© application and order named two new persons and
deleted the names of three individuals who had been identified
in the first go-round.
Respondents Donovan, Robbins and Buzsacco were not
specifically identified in either the application or order,
the original or extension.
The district court, in the suppression hearing, upon
review of various items of information in the government’s
possession at the time the renewal application was filed,

5
determined that there was, in fact, probable cause to believe
that these respondents would b@ overheard discussing illegal
gambling conversations during the second interception .

And

because they had not been identified in the application and
order, th© district court suppressed their conversation from
us® in evidence against them.

The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Now, as to respondents Meric and Lauar, there is no
question about the initial propriety of the overhearing of
their conversations.

However, after the interception was

completed, the government supplied the authorizing judge with
the names of 37 persons who had been identified as being
overheard during the surveillance.
Service of inventories on these persons was ordered
by the court and was carried out.
Subsequently, the government realized that it had
omitted to inform the judge of -the identities of two other
persons, and it obtained an amended order and served additional
inventories.
However, Merlo and Lauer were net named to the judge,
and did not receive a service of inventory.

They were,

thereafter, indicted; and after the indictment they, as well .
as all the other defendants, were given access to the orders,
the application, and the transcripts of the intercepted con»
versations.

Everybody had access at the same time.

Th© district court ordered suppression of the inter-”

6

cepted conversations of Mario and Lauer because - of the
government's failure to supply their names to the judge, so
that the judge could determine whether discretionary notice of
the taps should b© served upon them.
The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Neither court below found that Che failure to supply
the names for inventory purposes was anything other -than
inadvertent.

Or that these respondents did not in fact know,

long before they were indicted, that they had been overheard,
or that there was any prejudice to them as a result of delay
in official notification of the overhearings.
Decision of the Court of Appeals stands, rather, for
an absolute rule requiring suppression, regardless of lack of
governmental misconduct or prejudice to the defense.
Now, of th© two issues before the Court, the one
concerning th© identification of parsons in the application and
order is by far th® most important to the future administration
of the Act, and it is to that issue that 1* plan to devote the
bulk of my argument.
The inventory issue was less important.

It is now

the government's policy, even though we don't believe the Act
compels us to do so, to su-ply th© supervising judge with th©
names of all overheard persons as to whom we believe there is
any reasonable prospect of indictment.
Perhaps th© approach of the Court of Appeals for the

7
Ninth Circuit, which suggested that rather than submitting
specific names we should submit categories of persons who had
been overheard, is a better policy, would b© more helpful to
the district court in exercising its discretion, and wa would
have

no objection to following any reasonable policy that -the

district courts determine would b@ useful to them in this
area®
QUESTIONS As to -the inventory notice?
MR® FREYs

As to the inventory notice, that's right®

However, whatever the rules may be, suppression of
the ©vidanca is an inappropriate and unauthorized responso in
these casas, and. it’s on 'that point that I want to make a few
brief observations before I turn to the identification question*
First of all, Section 2513(10) (a), which is the
suppression provision, and which is set forth, I believe, at
page 5a of the Appendix to our brief -— authorized the
district courts to suppress on one of three grounds?

that

the communication, was unlawfully intercepted; that the order of
authorization or approval is insufficient on its face; or that
the interception was not made in conformity with the order*
How, none of these three grounds is applicable to a
post-intercept failure to comply with the procedures that
follow® And it’s our argument that you cannot suppress under
the statute for a failure to comply with cost-intercept pro­
cedures

8

Now, 3E point out in this connection that where Congress
wished to exclude evidence for post-intercept defects, it
specifically so provided®

For example, Section 2518(8} (a) ,

which is not in the Appendix, concerns the sealing, and it
provides that after the interception is terminated, the tapes
must be turned over promptly to the district court for sealing»
And it further provides that the absence of the seal called for
in that section, or a satisfactory explanation for the absence,
means that the evidence is to be excluded»
That is a specific exclusionary rule dealing with a
post-intercept failure»
Similarly, and more dLrectly in point in this case,
Section 2518(9) of the statute»

That is the provision that

sets forth the congressional requirement of noti.ce antecedent
to the admission of evidence in a case»

That is, notice to the

defendant of the fact that he!s been intercepted»
That provision says that the contents of any inter­
cepted wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom
shall not be received in evidence, or otherwise disclosed,
unless each party, not less than ten days before the trial,
hearing or proceeding, has bean furnished with a copy of the
court order, accompanying application, et cetera»
That is, Congress has said what is necessary.
Respondents Merlo and Lauer have gotten the information that's
necessary»

It's still more than ten days before their trial.

9
We think there’s no ground, therefore, for excluding it»
QUESTION? And this never did go to trial, that is
to a district court trial?
MR„ FREY s

Not as to these respondents „

They were

severedo
On© final point»

In discussing the Giordano~Chfevaz

analysis here, of course the courts have focused on the question
of centralityo
Now, we don’t deny that the inventory notice concept
is a central part of the statute? but that, to us, doesn't
answer the question that must b© answered before determining
whether to suppress0

And that is, whether the particular kind

of defect in the procedures is itself so central to the
statuteo

That is, here, whether the fact that only 39 people

rather than 41 people were named is so central to ‘She statute,
in the absence of prejudice to the defendfints, that suppression
is an appropriate remedy»

We say it clearly is not.,

Now, turning to the naming issue:

The Court of

appeals held that the government’s obligation to identify
extends to all persons whom the government has probable cause
to believes it will overhear talking over the monitored
telephones about the criminal activities under investigatione
We submit that the language and structure of the Act,
its legislative history, and substantial policy considerations
dictate a much narrower interpretation of that requirement»

10

I'd like to begin by saying a word about the dictum
in. Kahn, because several Courts of Appeals that have examined
this question have really stopped their inquiry after they
looked at the dictum in Kahn,
Kahn was a vary different case,

Kahn concerned the

question of who,among th® people whose phon© was being monitored,
had to b© named in -th© order.

And Kahn held that only where

you had probable cause did you hav© to name somebody whose
phone was being intercepted0

Kahn did not; concern th© question

of your responsibilities to name people who were calling in to
th© intercepted phone from phones teat are not themselves being
monitored.

It wasn't briefed, it wasn't argued, it wasn't

necessary to the court's decision, and I don't think a fair
reading of the Kahn dicturi suggests that the issue is in any
way foreclosed,
QUESTIONs

But, Hr, Frey, in Kahn, Mrs, Kahn's phone

wasn't being monitored,
MR, FREY;

Oh, yes, it was„

QUESTIONt

It was Mr, Kahn’s phone, tee phone was

point of our position is that '*■•••
QUESTION: Th© daughter, too, as I remember it,
MR, FREY:

Well, that's right.

And what we’re saying

11
is that the naming obligation extends to people who are users

MR» FREY;

The difference is on which end of the

And I intend to **-

All right, let me ~—
QUESTION;

Mr» Frey, just to make one more point

clear, Mr» Kahn was away from wherever it was that the phone
was, and Mrs» Kahn was the one that was home.

He was not in the

12

place where the -MR* FKSYs But it was —• it was -fjhe phone of the faroily*
That is, these phones were the phones of the Kahn family, and *—
QUESTIONS
MR* FREYs

Found to be the Kahn household*
It was the Kahn household telephone, and

our position would b© that it's not unreasonable to require
the government to identify those people whose phone is being
intercepted*

And I ‘think ‘the statute focuses, as I will get

to in just a moment,, on whose telephone is being intercepted*
That's th© person that Congress was talking about in th©
statute*
Now, Section 2518(1)(b) says that th© application
must state, quote, t!th@ identity of the person, if known,
committing the offense and whose communications are to be
intercepted5' *
Now, we submit that in this case that requirement was
fully mat when the application named Kotosh, Spaganlo and
Florea*

These were th© targets, these were the persons who w@ r©

expected to be overheard talking from th© phones that were being
monitored about th© illegal activities*
Now, th© first thing to note, as I've stressed, is
the singular word 83th© person" in th© statute*

Now, m the

New York statute, which was the model for this particular
provision in the federal statute, and which is quoted, cited
at Berger, in the opinion in Berger, the New York statute

13

provided the parson or persons had to he identified»

Congress

dropped "or persons" out of the federal statute# only 55the
person" need he identified»
And we think that the congressional notion was that
there would be one target in these cases., that it would be the
target's phone that, would be monitored# and that that was the
person who should b© named» if that person was known»
The critical distinction# and it's one we believe is
clearly built into the statute# and it's on© we urg© the Court
to recognize in its decision# is between lih© users of the
talc:!phone that is being monitored on the cm© hand# and all
other persons throughout the world who may converse from
unmonitored phones on the other hand»
The naming requirement applies to the former# in
our view# and not to the latter»
Now# there is internal evidence in the statute# I
think# that supports this quit© clearly.

If you will look at

page 2® of the Appendix to our brief# and 3a, w® set forth
there stabs action 2518(3) # which talks about what the judge
must find in determining to issue an authorization»
Nov;# subsection (a) says that the judge must find
that "there is probable cause for belief that an individual is
committing# has committed, or is about to commit a particular
offense”„
Subsection (d) # which ties in with this# says that

14
and I am going to edit it slightly **«• "there is probable cause
for belief that the facilities from which, or the place where,
the wire communications are to be intercepted'5, that those
facilities"are being used or about to be used in connection
with fch® commission of 3uch offensa , or are leased to, listed
in the name of, or commonly used by such person»"
Now, the "such person" that Congress was talking
about there was the individual who has committed the offense.
The structure of this statute ties a particular individual,
a particular telephone, a particular offense? and we think that
that is further reinforced by subsection (4), which deals with
what the contents of the court authorizing order shall include,
QUESTIONS

Mr. Frey, you briefed that — it's in

your brief -« that somebody who regularly uses the phone,
they should be named.
MR» FREYs Well, that's right»

I think if w® expect

•bo overhear — that is, if, let's say, as may have been the
case in this case, one of the targets uses his girl friend's
telephone to receive bets or line information, or something
like that, we would agree that that may be a case where he
should be named» But that's because he is a user of the phone
that’s being intercepted»
QUESTIONs So you're putting it not on the person,
but 'the instrument, the phone?
MR» FREY: We think that the identification requirement

15

is tied to the instrument, and to the people who are likely to
be using that instrument and not to everybody in the world,,
And I'll get, in a little bit, to some of the practical
reasons for thato
QUESTIONS

Yes, but, counsel, you're talking about

"everybody in th© world”, 'there's no claim you have to name
everybody, it's Gnly those who are believed to be committing
•the offense,
MR, FREYs

Well, I understand, but that could be —

I’m not suggesting that w© have to —
QUESTIONS

Well, it would b© limited to those that

the government has reason to believe are committing the
offense,
MR» FREYs

But, whan I'm talking about everybody in

the world, I am making a distinction between the users of the
phone ~ I mean, I understand that probable cause is a require­
ment, in any event? if w'e don't have probeibie cause, we don't
have to name
QUESTIONS

Let

m© make it specific»

Supposing in the

Kahn case, the government had known, which they did not, in
advance that Minnie Kahn was a partner in the gambling venture,
You said she would not have had to be named»
MR» FREY;

No, I think w© would say that she should

have, been named»
You can argue about whether

when you name —

IS

QUESTION?

Tell IRQ this , just so I understand, why

would you concede that?
MRo PREY t Because it was her telephone that was being
monitored.,

The tap was put on
QUESTION s

By her telephone, you mean she was a

regular user of the phone?
MRo FREYs

It was not listed in her name*

Yes, but what we expected when we over­

heard —» assuming we had probable cause, we would have expected
to overhear her engaging in criminal conversations from that
phone, rather than calling in from an outside — in the Kahn
case there was another person, a lay-off bookie in Indiana, —
QUESTION? Righto

MR« FREY s

who was one of the; people who was in

this "rest of the world" category that I'm talking about, and
there was no briefing or argument in Kahn, he was not indicted,
and there was no question as to whether he should have been
named? although, arguably, there was probable cause to name
him»
'

But we think that ha is in a different position from
Mrs* Kahnc
QUESTIONS Well, let me just be sure I understand0
Why do you concede she would be properly named?

Is it because

she lived there or she was a regular laser of the phone?
MR, PREYs Because she’s a user of the phonee

Because

we — because, on the hypothetical, vie have probable cause to

17
believe that we will overhear her engaging in conversations
about the criminal activity from the phone* that's being
monitored.
QUESTION:
”from tli© phono”?

Now, what in the statute talks about the
That’s what you ~* you seem to emphasise

which instrument is used*
MR. FREYs Well, the statute says the person.
Arguably, ~
QUESTIONs

Yes, but you’ve just conceded that it can

bo two persons.
MR. FREYs

Wall, I

for purposes of our construction,

I mean, in another case, the question of what would happen if
we named only one of two people, which is an issue, for instance,
in the Doolittle case, where there was Doolittle, who was the
principal target, and then there was a fellow named Sanders,
who was an employe© of Doolittle’s, who worked in Doolittle’s
club.

That poses different questions that aren’t presented

here.
Qur policy normally now is to name such persons.
QUESTIONs

All right. But we’re* trying to — I'm

trying to understand what you think the statute means. And I
think you'*ve conceded that the singular aspect of it is really
not controlling.
MR. FREY;

Well, it’s — I’m suggesting that the

Court could conclude that it's not absolutely controlling? but

18

I still think it’s v©rv significant, because the statute ties
th© person to the facility that's being intercepted.
In subsection (4), at the concluding paragraph, at
2518(4), it says that ”An order authorising th© interception
of a wire or oral communication shall ... direct that a
communication common carrier ... furnish necessary assistance* ”
If you look- at page 4a — 55to accomplish the interception
unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the
services that such carrier, landlord ... is according the
person whose Communications are to be intercepted.51
Now, the telephone company -~
QUESTIONS

I don't take it to h@ — maybe I'm

confused, but I take your argument to be that the government
can't anticipate, and Congress didn't intend

that th®

government anticipate,everyone who is going to make a call to
a monitored phone.
MR. FREYs

Well, but there are problems with that,

of that nature.
QUESTION s

Unless you have probable cause with

respect to certain persons, to believe that they are regularly
communicating with the primary monitored phone.
MR. FREYs Well, Mr. Chief Justice, our first
position is wholly aside from practical considerations, which
we think are substantial and which I will get to if I have time?
the question is, What does the statute require us to do?

19

Now, our position is that the statute focuses on the
person whose telephone is being intercepted»

Now, her©, the

person whose communications ar© to be intercepted here, th©
■telephone company was not providing services to Donovan or
Buzzacco or Robbins in this case, of a kind that would b®
interrupted, of a kind for which you would need a court
order, court assistance, to direct their facilitation»

The

telephone company was providing the services to Kotosh, to
Spaganlo, to Florea, for th© persons whose telephones were
being intercepted»
So that this distinction between callers~in from
outside and callers-out from th© monitored phone is, I think,
built into th® statute,
It is also, I believe, built into the

-- reflected

in th® legislative history.
For instance, in th® Senate Report, which is the
principal document in the legislative history, where they talk
about the inventory notice provision, the report says at page
105s

through its operation, that is the inventory notice

provision, all authorized interceptions must eventually become
known at least to the subject.

He can then seek appropriate

civil redress, et cetera»
Now, again, the concept that Congress had, and
perhaps it was unsophisticated in terms of the reality of
investigations that are taking place, but the concept that

20
Congress had was that there would be one target,, and if we
knew who that target was, as w© normally would, that target
would b® named.
QUESTIONs But the inventory provision says "persons",
with an ”s"«
MR. FREYs

Well, --

QUESTIONS

2518(8)(d) does.

The inventory provision,

"to the persons named in the order.15
MR. FREYs

Well, it's perfectly clear 'that in practice

more than on© person is ordinarily named. What w© are inquiring
into her® is the obligation to in fact name people who are —
who we have probable cause to believe will be calling in from
outside phones. And I just don't think that that obligation
is contained in the statute, or was ©ver intended by Congress.
Now, I'd just like to say a word or two about the
policy consideration, because the broad interpretation of the
Court of Appeals accomplishes very little by way of protecting
against unjustified intrusions into the privacy of persons
who

may b© overheard.
The statutory schema does not limit the

scop© of

permissible court**authorised overhearings in terms of the
identities of the persons who may be overheard, but rather in
terms of the kinds of conversations that may be overheard.
Persons who are not previously know to b© involved in the
criminal enterprise may be overheard, nevertheless, as Kahn

21
plain ly demons trates»
On the other hand, overhearings of all innocent
conversations, even those of the named target, are supposed to
be minimised»
So the primary interest os these respondents would
not have gained, in any significant respect, they would not
have gained on® ounce of additional pro-taction had they been
named in the order, as they claim they should have been»
This is not a great honor to be named in an order of this sort»
Th@ Court of Appeals broad naming requirement not only
doesn’t accomplish anything in terms of protecting the privacy
interests that Congress was legitimately concerned with when it
enacted Title III, but it also imposes significant administra­

tive burdens

on the

government

in preparing applications,

significant burdens on the court in weighing and approving
them, all to no useful purpose»
QUESTIONs

Let me just asks

Why do you suppose

Congress put in any naming requirement?
MR» PSEYs Well, Congress explained why they did it,
at page 101 of the Senate Report»

Congress said ~ -they listed

the requirements contained in subparagraph (h) of 2518(1) , and
they said "each of -these requirements reflects the constitutional
command of parti culari z ation^

And they cited Berger»

And Berger had this to say about the naming require­
ments

They said — and the court said, at page 59 of the

22
opiniosi in Bagger, 388 U»S»:
"It is true that the statute requires the naming
of * the person or persons whose communications 3a» are to be
overheard or recorded .

But this does, no more than-identify

the person whose constitutionally protected area is to be
invaded rather than ‘particularly describing5 the communications *
conversations, or discussions to b© seized»M
And in Kahn again the Court recognized that there is
not

Congress was wrong, there is not a constitutional

obligation to narae —
QUESTION? But the point is they wanted to identify
the person whose constitutionally protected privacy is to be
invaded»

And you're saying that the owner of the phone has

such a privacy interest, but the other person, the person on
the other end of the line has no such privacy interest»

MR» FREY: Well, I'm not suggesting that he has no
such privacy interest»

What I'm suggesting is that the naming

requirement *— after all, the naming requirement is not tied
to th© kinds of conversations that can be overheard, or the
ex-tent of the permissible overhearing»
QUESTIONi Well, what I'm trying to understand is why
does the reason apply to one and not to fee other?

That's the

heart of my question, I guess»
MR. FREY:

Well, I ~ well, fee reason why it shouldn't

is a. practical reason»

I mean, it's several practical reasons»

23

You have a case like this, which is a complex gambling
conspiracy

ease, with people actually all over the country

transmitting line information, laying off bets.

You overheard

many, many persons, it’s a fast-moving investigation, and then
you’re telling the government that it has to engage in what
essentially is a quite metaphysical evaluation of all the
information in its possession, so that it can -tell the district
court that it has or hasn’t probable cause to believe that it
will overhear certain persons, and when it. tells the district
court that, what is the district court to do with that
information?
If it has no probable —» if the government has no
probable cause, if the district court disagrees with the
government, then it strikes the name from the order, and then
we can overhear that person as a person unknown.
So it gives the person no protection to be stricken
from., the orders

it does nothing, except it adds a lot of

work, .for the district court.
And if w© name someone who is in a borderline case,
and w® will be forced to a policy of over-inclusion if we lose
this case, w@ will be naming

boss®

people who will not b®

overheard, and then, when a suppression motion comes about,
and the intercept order and application are opened up, these
people will have, in effect, defamatory information, unsupported
by the actual result of the tap, made public, that they were

24
suspected by the government of particip&ting in criminal
gambling enterprises, narcotics, and so or..
So, even in tarns of — I mean, the naming just does
not serve a substantial interest of the individual, nor does it
further the policy of -the Act»
And I think I had batter reserve the balance of my
■time»
QUESTION %

Mr o Prey, let me ask you one question.

Do you have any doubt that Congress could have drafted a
statute that provided only for -the naming, upon a showing of
probable cause, of the owner of the phone, in view of United
States v. White?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD A. BERKMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS MERLO AND LAUER
MR. BERKMANs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s

My colleague, Mr. Policy, and I represent five
defendants in a gambling indictment, whose telephone conversa-*
tions were intercepted by the government for use as evidence
at their trial.
The district court suppressed these intercepts,

25
faeceus® they were obtained in violation of Title 111 of the
Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968.

My clients, Mr. Merlo and

Mr. Lenar, because they never received im^entory notice of the
intercepts, as required by 18 United States Cod®, Section 2518
(8) £d) , which I shall refer to as

(8) (d) of the Act.

And Mr. Policy's clients, becausse they were not
identified in the application for authorisation, for the tap,
even thought they were known to the government, as required
by 18 United States Cods Section 2518(1)(b)(4), which, if I
has occasion to refer to again, will be ass

(1) (b) (4) ,

Both of these suppressions were affirmed by the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I intend to urge, in my
portion of the argument, that the suppression of wiretap
evidence against my clients was appropriate, proper and
necessary because of the governments violation of Title III
(8)(d).
And after that, my colleague will argue for
affirmance of the suppression as to his clients, because of the
government's Title III violation of (1)(b)(4)c
It seems to me that at the outset it is important
to identify a couple of facts, which have become obscured or
muddied as a result of th© briefs and the dissenting opinion
in th© Court of Appeals below.
One of the things that I think must b© clarified is
that there never was any actual notice to defendants Merlo and

26

L&uer»
The trial court who heard the evidence and had an
opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses mad® a
speedfic finding, that no inventory notice: was ever served upon
Mario and Lauar, nor did they receive notice in any other way,
and that finding by the trial court was commented upon by the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the majority opinion took
th® view that 37 other people were notified would at least give
these defendants th® feeling that they hac. not ba@n intercepted,
because they had failed to receive any inventory notice, as
required by Section (8)(d)0
So that so far as this case is concerned, it is clear
•that this is not a situation in which only a technical violation,
th® failure to serve an inventory notice, was — occurred in
the record, but, in fact, up until th© time they were indicted,
some eleven months later, and until they actually received th©
information

as a result of their discovery applications, they

had no such actual notic®.
QUESTION s What was the masoning of th® Court of
Appeals that your clients would know that 37 other peopl© had
been intercepted, but that they would have received no notices
•themselves, so 'they would assume they hadn't been intercepted?
MR. BERKMANs

Well, th© Court of Appeals, with

respect to the majority, did not take such a position, but
th® — I'm sorry, the majority opinion did comment on the

21
finding by the trial court that 'they had not received actual

,

notice

and further speculated in their opinion that far from

the suggestion that because 37 other people had been notified,
somehow, by word of mouth, they must have had actual notice
in some way of the interception? said that it is ambiguous and
that it is just as likely that because the* others had received
.i

actual notice and they had not, that they were entitled to
assume that they were not intercepted»
QUESTIGNs Well, how did the Coujrt of Appeals think
that they had learned of the receipt of actual notice by the
other 37 people?
MR» BERKMANs

Well, I think they were just refuting

an argument that had been mad© by the government, that somehow
or other, through the grapevine or whatever, they must have
received notice, because 37 other people had received inventor/
notices*
QUESTIONs

Isn’t it just as reasonable to assume, if

they had received that kind of notice by the grapevine, they
itfould have received notice of the fact that they had been
overheard?
MR» BERKMANs Well, that is the argument that was being
refuted by the Court of Appeals as to the government's argu­
ment. That is what the government argued, and tee Court of
Appeals decided that the finding by the trial court, that
there was in fact no actual notice in this case, was sound.

28

And that is the basis upon which they did so.
The second fact that I think needs to b© dealt with
her©
QUESTION:

On actual notice, now, you mean the

formal notice contemplated by the statute?
MR» BERKMANs

No, ism going beyond that»

It is clear there is the ~ fchei’© is no question
whatever, Your Honor, that no inventory notice was ever served
upon these people»

Never*

The first information that they received came in th©
process after — after they were indicted and after discovery
proceedings were instituted,
Th© question that was on the table, so to speak, so
far as the Court of Appeals was concerned and the trial court,
was whether or not, in conceding that they had received no
inventory notice as required by the statute, whether they had
received actual notice that might somehow serve'to mitigate
the violation of the statute*
And in dealing with, teat problem, *—
QUESTION? That is, from on© of their friends?
MR» BERKMAN:

Yes,

Or colleagues»

And that problem was what the Court was addressing
when they concluded teat no actual notice had been shown on
this record.

Neither any inventory notice»

Th® second fact that I believ® needs to b@ dealt with

29

is the question of when it was that Mr, Merlo and Mr. Lauer's
identity were known to the government sufficient to cause
them to be required to serve an inventory notice, upon these
particular defendants.
And I believe, in th© dissenting opinion of the
Court of Appeals, that judge indicated that somehow or other
that information did not com© until August — about two months,
two or three months prior to th® tint© that the second inventory,
adding a couple more people, was actually filed.
I believe that that represents a misreading of the
record, with all due respect.
QUESTIONS Well, isn}t that what the testimony was,
that the time was placed as th© late summctr of 1973, perhaps
late August?
MR. BERKMANs

That does appearg Mr. Gale, a Special

Agent for the FBI, did so testi.fy.

And in the next few lines

it becomes abundantly clear that th® reason that he — the
question was put as to when he became cognizant of th© fact
•that these people were identified, not only as individuals who
had been on the telephone but also individuals who were
perhaps involved in the crime that they wcsre investigating.
The reason that he became awar® of it in August of 1973
was becaus© of the fact that h© had just lean assigned that case,
at that time, and he conceded, in the next; couple of pages
and this appears at approximately 160 to 165 of th© Appendix —

30

he conceded that the —» that in fact, by January the 13th,
a physical search and salsura was made of the premises on which
Mr„ Lauer and Mr* Merlo were found.

That is a. part of the

probable cause that was assigned in that affidavit in support
of that warrant.

The telephone information which had bean

obtained was employed,,

That at -that time physical evidence was

seised, which was going to b© Introduced, and some vary
critical admissions were obtained from Mr. Merlo and Lauer with
respect to the fact that they were the people who were on the
telephone.
And that they were the people who had rented the
telephone in another nara®0
And he conceded, I think quite honestly, that as of
that time and certainly by the 18th of January, all of the
reports of the raid, all of the evidence seised, all of the
reports of the admissions of these people, were in the hands of
responsible people in the government, particularly FBI agents
who were working with the strike force.
And so it seams to me that there is no way to read this
record except to find that at least by January the 18th th©
government had full knowledge of the identity and participa­
tion of these two individuals,
And yet, from then until December — from January to
December, and after the time of indictment, these people were
never served -with inventory notice, nor received notice of any

31
kind»

And that’s what the record suggeste»
And so I think that when the Court in the Sixth

Circuit# the dissenting judge found that there was no knowledge
i

until August# I think he wasn’t reading th© rest of th© record#
and 1 think it’s very clear that — and I think Mr* Gales makes
clear — that the reason that he just lem-nad ©bout it was
because he was a young lawyer who had just been assigned to the
case*

And that the government did have this information»
In addition to that# there is seme talk about the

inadvertence of -th© failure to serve inventory notify© upon
Mr. Merle and Mr. Lauer# and X think that there is nothing in
th© record to indicate that the failure to do so was inadvertent.
On© of the difficulties of attempting to find out
from the government# so far as th© defendente * standpoint is
concerned# as to the reasons for what occurred# is of course
that all of the facts ar® within the control of the government.
What we know from the record is that from January th®
13th or January 'the 18th of 1973 until December# there was
never any notice.

That when they combed the record in

September of 1973# to find other people# they found a couple
of other people# but did not identify Merlo and Lauer.
And it seems to me that the best; face that can be
put upon this record is to suggest that as a result of
sloppiness# as a result of negligence; of the government# these
two people were not identified.

That’s the best fact 'that can

32
be put on it*
It seems to me, under those, circumstances, to allow
an absolute and total failure to perform the duties that are
required under (8) (d) of the statute puts a burden upon the
defense, in terms of finding out why it wtis that it was not
done, which I think Congress never intended with fee strict
responsibilities that are necessary in implementing the
limitation provisions of the Act»
QUESTIONS

You are not taking the position that there

was bad faith demonstrated by this record, then, I take it?
MRo BERKMANs
It seemsi

I can’t say that there was bad faith*

to me that there certainly was a complete and total

failure, which is unexplained by the govesmment, and which, I
think, must be explained on the basis of, at least, negligence
or sloppy performance,.
QUESTIONs

But you would say that if there was

negligence, then it should follow that suppression is in
order?
MR» BERKMAN;

That’s one of the branches of our

position, Your Honor»
The other

branch would be to say that if we read

Giordano and Chaves correctly, that if we are dealing with a
central issue or a central subject of the Act, which was
designed to limit the inappropriate use of interception of
communications, as we think this clearly is, that under that

33
case, as explained by Chavez, whether or not the government
has been guilty of any wrongdoing, either negligent

or

deliberat®, that because of its centrality and because of
the importance involved in making sure that the government
follows, in a strict way, every limitation that has been put
upon them by the statute, that, regardless of any wrongdoing
or negligence by the government, feat suppression would be
an appropriate and necessary remedy0
So our positions are two-pronged, in that directions
QUESTIONs

Mr* Berkman, how do you meet the

government’s argument that there — that the references to
post-interception conduct -- there are a coupl® of specific
references, but they don’t apply to this situation?
MR» BERKMANs

Yes,

It seems to ma to be quite

#

clear, if we analyse the statute itself, and if we analyze
the legislative history of the statute, that because of the
necessity of surreptitious entry or surreptitious search and
seizure, as that term is applied to wiretaps, it is impossible
to give the advance notice that the invasion of the client’s
privacy *—> the invasion of the defendant’s privacy is involved,
As a consequence, the post*»intercept procedures have
been clearly set out to make sure that ultimately disclosure
of fch®s® secret intrusions is mad©, and to be mad© in a
reasonable time thereafter, not immediately necessarily but at
a reasonable time thereafter

34
It seems to me that in the government's discussion
of the whole problem of suprression there was no mention at all
of Section 2515, which very clearly indicates that suppression
is appropriate when there has been a viol fit ion of this chapter»
It seems to me that that and 'the legislative history surrounding
that, which is reported in detail in the c-telbard decision,
make quit® c3.ear that it was important, so far as the government
was concerned, -«> so far as Congress was concerned, to make
sure that a number of remedies were availeible, in the event
that there was a violation of the limitations of the Act»
Criminal provisions ware provided, 2511? civil — a
civil suit was provided, 2520? and, if you review the legis­
lative history, it makes clear that that, coupled with the
requirement that the government not be able to use the fruits
of its violations, makes 'vary clear that that was the intent
of Congress»
QUESTIONS

Mr» Berkman, —

MR» BERKMANs
QUESTIONs

Y®S, sir?

— help me on one point»

As I understand

your argument, if the government does what; it did in this case,
and they overhear the testimony of an unknown criminal, he can
be prosecuted on the basis of that information? but if they
overhear the conversation of a known criminal, they can't use

it?
MR, BERKMAN:

It is my understanding that the words

35
‘'if known" in the statute indicate either that the individual
is known who was intercepted, or that he is known to be
involved in the criminal activity»
QUESTIONs

That’s what I said»

Wella if it’s not

known, *»“
MR» BERKMAN £
QUESTIONs

Y©S, sir,

— and ha’s a very clever man, than you

can use that»
MR» BERKMANs So the statute —
QUESTIONg

But if he’s stupid and ha’s known, you

can* fe us© it*
MR» BERKMANs
QUESTION?

Well, —

Yes a That’s what you said»

MR» BERKMANs

Persons who are overheard but not

known,—
QUESTIONS Righto
MR» BERKMANs

— come within another section of (8) (3)

rather than th® one to which the Court is referring»
It seems to m® that what'the statute says, in {8) (d) ,
is that anybody who is overheard and known has got to receive
an inventory»

Anybody who is overheard and not known must have

that information at least transmitted to the court, so it can
exercise its discretion in 'th® interest of justice, to sake a
determination as to whether or not to require an inventory»
And the failure in this case, Your Honor, is that there was no

36

such information transmitted to th© court? so that the court
could exercise its discretion to make a determination as to
whether persons who were overheard but not: known? which is the
category into which my clients fall? whether or not those
persons should have been issued an inventory notice in th©
interest of justice*
QUESTIONs Do you admit that they weren't known?
That your clients weren't known?
MR* BERKMAKs

We think they were known as early as

January «“
QUESTION £

I thought you said they were? and you

spent about five minutas explaining it*
MR* BHRKMAN2

Yes? Your Honor*

We think that these people were known at least by
January of 1973*

W@ are not making th© ccntention that they

were known at the time of the application for an authorisation
for the interception*

But we do claim that since January of

1973, until the time that they actually discovered th©
information, after they were indicted, they war® entitled to
that inventory information, and that they never received it*
That is our position*
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr* Berkman, your time is

running short, and you haven't covered all your -MR* BERKMAN: We would like to — I would like to just
male® one other observation, and that is this;

That with

37

respect to the exclusionary rule* get-ting back to Mr. Justice
Stevens’ question —- getting back to the exclusionary rule*
although there are specific provisions in. 2518(8) (a) regarding
sealing# which do express an exclusionary rule# and 2518(9)#
the ten-day notice provision# it seems to ma to be quite clear
that 2515 provides the exclusionary rule on a statutory basis
for all of the other violations of the chapter»
And# furthermore# with respect to 2518(3)# I think
it’s important to not© that the Congress# when it required a
showing of prejudice# was able to draft such language and us®
it in 2518(9)»
The balance of my tim© I would 31k© to reserve for
my colleague to argue the question under (1)(b)(4).
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Policy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARMEN A. POLICY# ESQ.#
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT Bt 2 SACCO
MR. POLICYs

Mr. Chief Justice# if it please the

Courts
I shall address myself to the issue of identification#
as it relates to tha respondents Dominic Eussacc© and Robbins.
QUESTION:

Could I ask you about that?

Suppos®

there’s an application to tap or to intercept conversations of
Jones's phone ■»*» over Jones’s phone# and there's probable
cause to believe Jones is engaged in some conspiracy.

There

38

is also probable cause to believe that he is engaged in
a criminal conspiracy with Brown.

But Brown isn't named.

But there's no probable cause to believe that he’s engaged
in a conspiracy with Smith.
Now, over the — when the tap g€>@s in, they hear
conversations with both of these other people, both Brown ©nd
Smith.

Now, is it your position that Brown’s conversations are

excludable and Smith’s are admissible?
MR. POLICYs That’s exactly our position^ Justice
Whit©.
QUESTIONS

And Smith —« I just went to make sure.

Smith's conversation, the unknown person, is -- are admissible
against an indictment in © criminal case against him.
MR. POLICYs

Assuming no probable cause existed, —

QUESTION? Right.
MR. POLICY 5

—“ and they did not. anticipate the

interception of his conversations.

That's exactly our

position, sir.
QUESTIONS And there doesn't seem to be any argument
about that, in the cases, that the conversations between the
*

target and Smith are admissible against them both?
MR. POLICY;

I believe that's correct, Your Honor.

Your Honor, I might say that there's no question but
that the government had probable cause, that 'these three
respondente were in fact engaging in this fcypa of activity

39

that was uri der investigation, and that th«dr conversations
would in fact b® intercepted,, And they had this knowledge
prior to th© application of December, December 26, 1972,
when th© government applied for an extension of the original
wiretap.
It's our position that failure to list these known
individuals in said application for the extension was in fast
■a statutory violation of 2518(1)(b)(4)? which, in fact,
resulted in an additional violation of 2518(4)(a), which
requires the judge, of course, to list the i danti fey of the
person, if known, whose communications are to b© intercepted»
We can in no way accept th© government's position
that the statute in question was designed to cover the patron
of a telephone company, and was designed to cover only the
conversation of that patron, or the man they know to us© that
particular phone, located at -that particular service.
QUESTION: Would you pl©as© tell me why a known
criminal is entitled to more protection than an unknown
criminal?
MR» POLICY:

Mr» Justice Marshall, one might say that

when the government is seeking a course of search and seizure,
which this is, th©y were searching and seising th© conversa­
tions of Buzzacco, Donovan and Robbins, and they have probable
cause to believe that these man will be intercepted, and they
ar® violating the law, they have such an obligation of at

40
l®ast naming them* by way of statute and by way of —
QUESTIONz

And that would go to a man who is calling

from Paris?
MR. POLICY;

If they had the probable cause to

believe that he would b® calling,
QUESTIONs
MR, POLICYs

Or Kenya* Africa?
If they sought to bring him with,in the

process of the laws of th© United States,
QUESTION;
MR, POLICYs
QUESTIONS
MR, POLICYs

Any place in the world?
I believe so* sir,
If he*s a known criminal,
If they have

probable cause to believe

that h@ was engaging in this activity,
QUESTIONS So the best way to get the protection of
our government is tc be known as a criminal?
MR, POLICYs

Quito th© contrary* sir,

I compare this

to © situation where th© police would ©ccidentally come upon
a mem* in to® course of s lawful search or a lawful arrest* and
find him in th© commissim of a crime g in that situation they
had no foreknowledge of his involvement* or the fact that they
would com© upon him in the commission of this crime.

But this

doesn’t relieve them of to© obligation to elicit a search
warrant or an arrest warrant for to© individuals that they have
for© knowledge of* in terms of their search and arrest.
QUESTION;

Do you mean that anybody that writes a

41

-

letter to the government and says, "X am a bookmaker” , h© then
is protected from then on?
MR, POLICY:

Quite .the contrary, sir» What I think

he’s doing is saying to the government, aH$<s?e, I’m giving you
some probable cause for you to go ahead and solicit a court
and show a court that you'r© following due process and th©
statute, and bug my phone,"
QUESTION: But if you send that letter and they don't
name you, and they intercept your message, you go free,
MR, POLICY: So long as the -QUESTION:
MR0 POLICY:

So long as you send the letter?
Wall, Your Honor, I think it would have

t© b@ somewhat more descriptive than “I’m a bookmaker",
QUESTION:

Well, yes, I guess you’d have to send it

by Certified Mail,
[Laughtero 3
QUESTION:

Do I understand you correctly as saying

that the test is whether, at the time,- the government had
probable cause to believe that a particular person, who is
not named, was involved in the criminal activity?
MR, POLICY: That’s correct, Mr„ Chief Justice,
QUESTION: Whether he was a well-known or totally
unknown person before that, it would make no difference? it’s
probable cause that is the key, is that right?
MR„ POLICY: That is correct, sir.

42

Probable cause that that particular individual —
QUESTION: At that time„
MR» POLICY:

*— at that time-* at the time that they

w€?re seeking the application to be approved, was in fact
probably engaging in this type of activity* and his conversa­
tion would be intercepted»
Both of those keys»
And I feel that the reading of Kahn tell us* and
logic would dictate, that where Minnie Kahn* in fact known
prior to the application being sought to have been engaging
in this activity* and probably using her husband's phone*
I feel that this honorable Court would have gone further on
the decision and would have stated that the statute would have
required

her

being listed in said application»

I feel, Mr» Chief Justice and Justices* that w© have
a definite statutory violation here* and when we look to
Giordano* we are told -that a statutory violation shall result
in suppression when it hits that central aspect of th©
statute* and when it hits an aspect of the statute which was
designed by Congress to limit the use of this tool»
Now * I submit th at in Berger and Kats* two of the key
cases in this situation* the courts ware concerned with
interjecting in between lew enforcement, and its us© of this
wiretapping tool some judicial restraint* or at least judicial
review»

And I feel this is obvious in Congress’ intent»

43
And by allowing the government; no com© forward and
go t© a district court judge without providing him with the
information as to the identity of those people » that it has
probable cause to believe will be intercepted and are probably
committing this crime» they are bypassing — utilitising their
own judgment in terms of that decision-making process, and
taking away what Berger» Katz and Congress had intended to be
some judicial review®
I further submit;» Mr® Chief Justice and Mr® Justices»
that there is a practical affect to not being named in this
particular application®

As w® read-on in the Section 2518 —

I believe it’s (8) requires inventory notice to b© served upon
all those named in the application®
Now, this is regardless of whether or not the
application is denied®
By placing this man’s name» who is a suspect

on

whom probable cause exists» in the application» he is guaranteed
receipt of th© inventory notice» and is not subjected to th©
arbitrariness or to th© discretionary activity that could go
into effect otherwise.
I submit that if an innocent man were the subject
of an investigation» he would prefer to know this» even
thought he’s exonerated» rather than have the entire process
kept secret throughout» and only in the hands and only in the
files of -the government®

44
I would say, further, that recognizing the existence
of Chavez, and comparing it to the doctrine of Giordano, we
certainly have a situation with the identification issue, which
is closer to suppression than th® Chavez situation.
I would even submit to this honorable Court that th©
identification issue is as key and as central as the Giordano
issue.

Because her® we’re dealing with the situation that goes

to th© merits of the probable cause aspects of these applica­
tions .
Her© we're getting again to th© heart of what Berger,
Katz and Congress had sought in the form cf judicial review,
judicial restraint.
QUESTION;

Well, you refer to Berger and Katz,

those are constitutional cases.

You don't have any doubt,

from reading that footnote 15 in Kahn, do you, that what you’re
saying is a statutory requirement is not a constitutional
requirement?
MR. POLICYz Without addressing myself to whether or
not it’s a constitutional requirement, I submit that the
statute in question, Your Honor, has been based upon th®
rulings of Berger and Katz? and I'm submitting that the
reference in Berger that was mads by Mr. Frey, at page 59,
relating to th© naming of a person as being th© requirement,
was a reference that the government, in effect, or th© State ©::
New York was attempting to say, "Look, we have a naming require-

45
ment, that should be enough to save the statute»”
I “Slink it was the state of New York's opinion at
that pointy an effort at that point to say, '"This is such an
important key issue, tills naming requirement; it's there, the
statute should survive
Whereas , 1 believe this honorable Court indicated
til at that wasn't; in and of itself; enough,»
QUESTIONs

Well; but than you're not arguing that

•this is a constitutionally required rule that you* re contending
for here?
MR» POLICY;

I would submit that.; as a secondary

argument, it would be a constitutionally required rule to have
a man who the government knows in advance will b© searched,
whose conversations will b© seised, named in an application for
a warrant for a wiretap»

and that the failure, t© failure to

go so far as to simply name this individue1, and provide the
aspects of psfebabl© cause to 'fch© judicial officer who would
review same, would be actually a violation of constitutional
standards, as well as a violation of the statutory standard»
QUESTION; Well, don’t you think that Kahn language
is quite to th© contrary?
MR„ POLICY;

Your Honor, as I recall th© Kahn language,

I felt that Kahn was saying, and did say, that th© requirement
was statutory, or the fact, that she was not known, there was
no probable cause to know that she was committing these

46
offenses, therefor©, a statutory violation did not com© into
effect, and X believe -that 'this covered the constitutional
aspect and did not allow it to coma into play.
I would submit that in Kahn again, had the government
known of Mrs» Kahn5s identity and the fact that aha engaged
in tills illegal activity, statutory and constitutional considera­
tions would have com© into play»
Thank you very ranch „
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Frey, do you have

anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY;

I have a couple of things, Your Honor.
i

First of all, I want to com© back to a point that was
apparently troubling you, Mr. Justice Stevens, about why
Congress would want to make a distinction between the people
whose phone was being monitored and the pcsopl© calling in from
outside.
One of the important reasons is that the impact of a
wire interception differs greatly on the people whose phone is
being intercepted, whose every conversation is subject to
being overheard, and th® people who may occasionally, one© or
twice during the course of a surveillance that involves several
hundred telephone calls being listened to, may b® overheard.
There is &

much

greater impact upon th© person whose

47

phon® is being intercepted* and for that reason it’s logical
for Congress to have made the distinction that we submit it
did make.
QUESTIONS

Doesn't the distinction tend to disappear

as the second person's us© of the.phone becomes more and more
regular end frequent?
MR. FREYs

Yes.

I mean, if we had a case where the

primary target of our investigation was somebody who we knew,
every day, was calling in from outside, you might have an
issue. But th©s® — Donovan, Buzzacco, Rotbins were very
tangentially —
QUESTION;

Well, or a case where you’re trying to

prove the five-man crime, and you know all five people us© the
same phon® over and over again.

Wouldn't you there — even

there you wouldn't say you had to name more than one?
MR. FREYs Well, I would first say that you didn't
have to nam© more than one? but second I would say that if you
did have to nam© more than on®, if they all five use the
phone that was being monitored, you might have to name them,
but the people with whom they were doing business, the
people from Las Vegas sending them the line information,
would not have to be named, even though we expected to overhear’
them.
Now, as far a® the point that Mr. Policy was just
making, w© don't need, either under th© Constitution or under

48

the statute # probable cause as to any person in order to have
the interception# all we need is probable cause to believe
that an offense is being committed# and that this telephone
is being used# and -that conversations relating thereto will b©
intercepted»
There can b© no person# the statute doesn't require
us to name

&

parson if we don't know one# it's neither

constitutional or a statutory requirement, and it’s

&

plainly#

I think# for that reason# not central»
QUESTION %

But on the reverse side of that# as soon

as you do have probable causa# then you should name him#
should you not# under the statute?
MR» FREY?
y@s»

Wall# the statute requires us to identify#

We concede that we have to identify a person whose phone

is being tapped»
QUESTIONz

Mo# no»

After the phone is — the tap is

on# and then some calls are coming in# as soon as it appears
that this man is calling and saying "Who's going to win the
-third race tomorrow afternoon?" because it*s all fixed# and
you get repeated calls? have you not then probable cause to
believe that person —
MR» FREYs Well# we may have probable cause# but it's
our contention that we don't have to name him.

W© certainly

wouldnt half© to nam© him unless we sought a renewal applica™
tion

49
QUESTIONs

Well, no, but you can’t even name him,

because you may not know his name0

But don’t you have to take

some steps to identify him then, tinder the statute?
MR„ PREYs

No, I don’t — I even think Kahn said w©

didn’t have to investigate to find out. That would be
terribly burdensome in these investigations„ W@ couldn’t do
it» We hav® too many people„

W© would be spending all our time

on something that’s really a total irrelevancy to the
administration of the Aetc
l8m not saying that the naming of the target is an
irrelevancy, the naming of —
QUESTIONS

Well, is it irr©l©V£iRt if you ultimately

— if you then go ahead and indict him?
MR» PREY: Well, it’s not ~ it’s not irrelevant to
him that h@’s baen overheard, and that evidence will b©
introduced against him*. And of course the conversations are
not irrelevant to the trial«
But in terms of the privacy concerns that Title III
is concerned with, since we can overheard, as Justice Marshall
pointed out, people of whom we hav© no suspicion, the privacy
concerns are not — it’s not relevant to protecting people’s
privacy» And if it’s not relevant fox' that, reason, we say it’s
not central to the Act, and the Court should not go out of its
way to construe the statute to impose what: is an administra­
tively burdensom requirement, which will makes life also very

50
difficult for judges who already have 46-page applications to
read over, and will have 146-page applications, if we have to
show all the probable cause w© have wife the far-flung
conspiracy, as to ©very person around the country®
Thank you,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS Very well.
