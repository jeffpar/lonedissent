ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
V

This case is here under certiorari to review the
judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, reversing Respondents' conviction for first degree
murder on Equal Protection grounds.
This case began when Respondents broke into the home
of Emma Johnson,, an 84-year-old non-Indian woman who lived on
the Coeur d’Alene Indian Reservation in Idaho.
They robbed her and then they kicked and beat her
to death.
Because

Respondents are Indians and the crime

occurred in Indian country and because the offenses were among
those enumerated in the so-called "Major Crimes Act," the
crimes came-within the jurisdiction of the Federal District
Court.
Respondents were indicted, tried and convicted of
burglary, robbery and felony murder.

And I talk here about

Respondents Antelope and Leonard Davison.

4
Actually, Respondent William Davison was convicted
only of second degree murder and the reversal of his conviction
appears to he inadvertent ana not based on any of the reasons
given by tile Court of Appeals.
respondents appealed rheii first degree felony
murder convictions to the Ninth Circuit.

the identity of the victim and I will outline the jurisdiction
possibilities as I proceed with the argumentThe Court of Appeals perceived in the situation that
I have described a racial discrimination against Indians which
it found not supported by any compelling governmental interest.
I think it is best to begin the discussion of the
legal issues in this case by outlining the current status of
jurisdiction with respect to crimes committed in Indian
country.
If an Indian commits a crime against a person or
property of another Indian, jurisdiction over the offense is
within the tribal courts unless the offense is one of the
major crimes enumerated in 18 U.S.C. 1153 in which case juris­
diction is in federal court under federal law.
. if an Indian commits a crime against a non-Indian,
essentially tie same st-v.has applies except that if it is not a
major crime and he has beer: punished by the Tribe, there would
be no Federal Court jurisdiction.

If ha has not been punished

by the Tribe, there would be Federal Court jurisdiction under
Section 1152.
'how, if a non-Indian commits a crime against a nonIndian, Section 1152 appears on its face to grant federal
jurisdiction over that offpnse,
However, in ? long line of decisions beginning with
United States against ’,ghrat; .ey in 1881 and going through the

6
Draper case arid New York ax re I. kay in 1945, this Court has
held that the states have exclusive jurisdiction over this
category of offenses.
QUESTION:

Even if it is a so-called "major crime“

and even, if it is committed on an Indian Reservation?
MR. FaEY:

it is treated as t cough it were committed

elsewhere in the state and n< c within .* adian country for pur­
poses of jurisdiction..

so the situation is, if an Indian is

involved, either as peipeaa’or or victim, there is either
federal or tribal jurisdiction,

If only non-Indians are

involved in the: transaction, there is state jurisdiction
'vhat thus emerges is a coherent overall structure

and tribal responsibility for regulation when Indians ex

stroAigly rooted in tin presence or absence

of impact on the interests of tribal Indians.
Now, along comes the Ninth Circuit and holds that
guide and principle developed by this Court is unconstitutional

7
in its application to a

arge category of cases»

That is, all

cases involving crimes against a person or property of nonIndians .
Mow, let’s consider carefully,

chen, what this dis­

crimination, as the Ninth Circuit found, is and perhaps more
importantly, what it is not.
The Federal Murder Statute under which Respondents
were convicted is plainly not racially discriminatory on its
face and for purposes of this argument I assume that the term
"Indian”

in the jurisdictional statutes is a racial term,

although we actually dispute that proposition.
Any person committing felony murder within an area
of federal jurisdiction, Indian or not, is guilty of first
degree murder.

This applies to a non-Indian who murders an

Indian in Indian country.

This applies to a non-Indian who

commits felony murder in a. federal enc.ls.ve such as a military
reservation or who commits felony murder in a vessel on the
high seas.
Indeed, the application of the Felony Murder Statute
to Indians by virtue of Section 1153 reflects, not a dis­
crimination

with regard to Indians, but an affirmative deter­

mination by Congress to treat Indians the same way as all other
persons within federal criminal jurisdiction are treated.
The discrimination comes about, then, not because
Congress has decreed chat Indians and non-Indians who commit

8

felony murder shall be treated differently in any respect but
simply because it has allowed the state to assert jurisdiction
when no Indian is involved in a crime, either as victim or
perpetrator.
Now, inevitably, when some cases are allocated to
the jurisdiction of one Sovereign and others to a different
Sovereign, there will be differences in the definition of
Offense, differences in the procedural and evidentiary rules
governing the trial of the case and differences in the punishment provided.
It is these differences that are the product of this
jurisdictional allocation that the Court of Appeals found
invidiously discriminatory.
This case is thus entirely different from the Cleve­
land line of cases relied upon by the Court of Appeals and
heavily relied upon by Respondents here.

Cleveland involved

the situation in which an Indian is the victim of an assault
and in thinking about this case it can be very confusing and I
think one point to keep in mind is what we might call the
"’Antelope" category of cases all involve non-Indian victims.
What we might call the "Cleveland” category of cases all involve
Indian victims.
Now, under the provisions of Section 1153 as they
were in effect at the time of the Cleveland decision, if an
Indian assaulted an Indian, state law was referred to to provide

9

substantive law and punishment.
However, if a non-Indian assaulted an Indian, 1152
applied and federal law governed and there were differences
which resulted in — for instance, in the Cleveland case, a
larger punishment being inflicted on an Indian defendant than
could have been on a non-Indian defendant but. the key factor
in the Cleveland cases is that both groups of defendants were
tried in federal court and that Congress had established the
standards by which both groups should ba judged and the status
of the defendant as Indian or non-Indian

the critical

factor that activated either state law or federal law applying
as a matter of affirmative Congressional enactment.
Now, this kind of direct discrimination would pose a
difficult case and it would be legitimately subject to some of
the objections wrongly made to the procedures in the present
case.
In the present case, the discrimination derives, as
I have said, solely from the division of jurisdiction between
the states and the Federal Government.
In order for this Court to sustain the result reached
by the Court of Appeals, it must conclude that this eminently
sensible division of responsibility which has so often been
endorsed by this Court, which allows the states to apply their
law in their courts when no federal interest is importantly
implicated but retains the Federal Government for situations

10
whex-e trust responsibilities for the Indian tribes are involved,
that this sensible allocation of jurisdiction is impermissible
because state lav? is different from federal law.
We submit, of course, that this wholly non-invidious
allocation of jurisdiction by Congress and by this Court is
fully consistent with the Equal Protection obligations imposed
upon Congress.
Wow, I think it is plain that we need not carry the
burden that Respondents would thrust upon us of showing a com™
polling governmental Interest to sustain the allocation of
jurisdiction that exists in this case bat I would like to outline for the Court the choices that would be available to
Congress if the Court of Appeals rejection of the present
system for administering criminal justice in Indian country is
upheld by this Court.
First of all, Congress could do nothing.

In such a

case, each prosecution for a crime against a non-Indian in
Indian country would be governed by a patchwork assortment of
the most lenient features of state and federal lav;.
For example, if a peace officer is murdered in the
course of a felony in the State of Idaho in Indian country,
the defendant could not be convicted of first degree felony
murder because Idaho has no such provision, only the federal
lav? does.
Presumably, however, the

defendant, if an Indian,

11
could not be convicted of murder of a peace officer, which is
first degree murder under Idaho law, because federal law has
no such provision.
QUESTION:

Now —
Mr. Frey, what is the rule if a Reservation

Indian is killed off the Reservation?
MR. FREY:

Well, the federal laws state —

at all.

Possibly Congress could adopt a statute.
QUESTION:

And how about an Indian committincr a

crime off the Reservation?

The same?

MR. FREY:

The same thing goes.

QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. FREY:

And, of course, the only Indians in our

view who are subject to jurisdiction on the Reservation under
the definition of "Indian" in 1152 and 1153 are Tribal
Indians, not Canadian Indians, not Indians from terminated
tribes, only — so we suggest that it is not really basically
a racial but more a political definition, although we recognize
there is a racial component to this.
QUESTION:

So that if a non-Tribal Indian commits a

12
crime or has a crime committed .against him on a Reservation —?
M'R„ FREY:

He would be treated as a non-Indian for

purposes of the statute.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

That is why you say it is a blend of geo­

graphical, political area and the identity of the -MR. FREY:

And, of course, race is relevant.

I mean,

the existence of Indian blood or non-Indian blood is a rele­
vant factor but it is not necessarily a determining factor in
deciding who is an Indian and who is not.
But in our view, it doesn't matter.

Even if "Indian"

is a racial term, v;e think it is plain that the arrangement
that Congress and this Court have evolved over the years is
completely justifiable and does not work any kind of invidious
discrimination.
Now, I would like to give another example of what
happens under the Court of Appeals decision as we understand it
and that is the situation in which an insanity defense is
available and let us say that the state definition of insanity
is more lenient or liberal than the federal definition of
insanity.
Yet, on the other hand,, let us say that the state has,
as

had, at least at one time, a requirement that the

defendant prove sanity rather than the federal requirement
that the government — that the defendant prove insanity, excuse

13

me, rather than the federal requirement that the government
bear the burden of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.
Presumably, again, under the Court of Appeals
opinion, you would have to pick the state's definition of
insanity and the federal burden of proof.
QUESTION:

In this very case, one might be rather

hard put to it to decide which was; the more lenient rule
because, as I think I heard you say earlier in your argument,
that while Idaho does not have felony murder, it does have
first degree murder punishable by death.
MR. FREY:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

And the evidence in this case —

MR. FREY:

The evidence was cited in this case

that possibly -QUESTION:

— might well have supported a first

degree, an ordinary, commonlaw first-degree murder conviction
and that would have been —•
MR. FREY:

Yes, sir.

That wouldn't have been more

lenient, in our view.
QUESTION:

Certainly, the punishment would not have

been more difficult.

14
MR. PREY:

Yes, in order to convict of fir3t-degree

murder and prior deliberation —
QUESTION:

You'd have to show deliberation and pre­

meditation and wilfulness, that's all.
MR. FREY:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

I suppose it is even clearer that if the

death penalty was available in that state and had been imposed,
we would not be here at. all.
MR. FREY:

If it was imposed,

QUESTION:

Yes, imposed.

MR. FREY:

I doubt that the Idaho statute, in fact,

Imposed.

could survive the North Carolina decisions last year but in
principle — I mean, we are talking theoretically now and the
fact is that we point out in our brief, for instance, the
Manslaughter statutes, the federal statute has two degrees of
manslaughter with certain punishments prescribed.

The Idaho

statute has four degrees of manslaughter, rangincr from punish­
ments considerably less than the federal punishment up to
punishments considerably more than the maximum federal punish­
ment. .
Now, I don't know how you compare these two systems
to determine which is more lenient.
In any event, it seems to me plain that the result
of the Ninth Circuit’s holding is that no coherent system of
legal rules is applied and the potential for spawning litigation

15
over choice of law is virtually endless,
Hew, Congress would have two alternatives to
chaotic system.

this

The first is to abandon federal supremacy in

the area and to trust responsibility to the Indian Tribes by
either, one, turning all prosecutions over to the state courts
under state law, which is what has been done in the so-called
■'PL 2 80" states.
Now, there was a time at the time PL 280 was adopted
when the sentiment in Congress was very much in favor of
assimilation of Indians and PL 280 was a product of that and
in five or six states there is, in fact, state jurisdiction.
There since was a reaction to that and in the Indian
Civil Rights Act in 1968 , Congress drew back from that approach
and determined -hat the tribes should have a say in the turn­
over of jurisdiction to the states because many of the tribes
were extremely reluctant to see their members subject to state
court jurisdiction and state law and preferred to maintain the
existing system.
Also, of course, Congress could adopt an assimilative
crimes approach under which all Indian defendants — and now
we are talking about the category of cases in which nonInoians are victims — under which all Indian defendants would
be governed by state law.
Now, this involves — if this is what is required
by the so-called

'Equal Protection violation" that we have in

16

this case, it is a strange principle because it basically says
that, yes, the Court has recognized over and over again, and
the Court of Appeals did not dispute that there exists a ward™
ship or trust responsibility toward the Tribal Indians, but
the only way Congress can exercise this responsibility is to
abdicate its own law-making functions and simply say, whatever
the states do will govern the Indians.
'Sow, there is a second alternative approach and that
is to federalize everything.

That is, to bring to — either

for this Court to overrule the McBratney, Draper line of cases
or for Congress to overrule it by statute and bring all wholly
non-Indian transactions in Indian country within federal court
jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

The statute looks fairly clear the way it

is written., doesn’t it?
MR. PREY:

That is true, but in McBratney what the

Court said was that the statute was implicitly repealed by the
Colorado Enabling Act which admitted the state on equal footing
and there has been a lot of criticism of this line of cases
but it is fairly well-embedded in our jurisprudence now and I
think it makes a lot of sense and I would think that this
Court should only as a last resort. — only if it finds that it
cannot escape the result reached by the Ninth Circuit, should
it consider the possibility of overruling the McBratney line
of cases.

17
Now, with regard to the federalizing results, there
are some practical problems that I think make it an unsatis­
factory course although possibly one that Congress would decide
to adopt.
One is that many reservations have a large percentage
of non-Indian population.

In fact, the Coeur d’Alene Reserva­

tion on which this murder occurred has 2,500 non-Indian
residents and only 450 Indians so it is over 80 percent nonIndian.
That is true of a number of other Reservations.
The result is that matters in which there is no
serious federal interest would be thrust upon the federal
courts system, thrust upon the United States Attorneys and the
Marshal Service to deal with.
It would foe a substantial added burden that is
difficult, in my view as a practical matter, to justify in
terms of the kind of federal interest involved.
At the same time, X think it has an unjustified
effect

0*1

the states, one that Congress would be reluctant as f.l

h tving >.n the Enabling Act admitted the states with juris­
diction over wholly non-Indian transactions, there is something
to be said for the proposition that this should not be taken
away from the states unless Congress or perhaps this Court
finds a compelling federal interest for altering that alloca­
tion of responsibilities.

18

.Slow, what we come down to, then, is what I think the
Court of Appeals has done is,, it has

picked some concepts which

have merit in other context, the notion that there should not
be racial discrimination in the administration of criminal
law and that where statutes discriminate between individuals
on the basis of race, that discrimination could only be justi­
fied, if at all, by showing a compelling governmental interest,
then it has imported those considerations into an area where
they really don’t fit, where they really don’t belong and
where they really have most unfortunate and unnecessary results.
X don’t believe that the Indians are treated unfairly
under the present allocation of jurisdiction.

They are treated

the same way in this case that non-Indians any place within
federal criminal jurisdiction in the United States are treated
and I believe there is no ground for a finding of an Equal
Protection violation.

v
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, please.
MR.-CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Frey.

Mr. Walker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. WALKER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS DAVISONS
MR. WALKER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
It is the Respondents Davisons position that the
statutory framework of L8 USC 1151, 1152 and 1153, when read

19

together, provide an impermissible racial discrimination in
that when certain conduct is perpetrated within the exterior
boundaries of an Indian Reservation, that prohibited conduct
treats the perpetrator differently depending upon the race of
the victim and the race of the perpetrator.
In this instance, for example, the victim was nonIndian and the defendant was Indian and as a consequence, under
10 USC 1153, the Major Crimes Act, these Indian defendants were
in federal court facing 18 USC 1111, which is the Federal
Homicide statute.
QUESTION:

What if the defendant were the white man

and he had killed an Indian?

And the white man came to you.

Would you be here making the same argument?
MR. WALKER:

Under 1152, Mr, Justice, that would

still be a matter for federal court determination.
QUESTION:

I know, but he would not have the advan­

tage of the state law.
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:

I believe that is correct.
So would you be making a racial discrimin­

ation claim here?
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:

I don't believe that I would be able to,
Well, it is because he is white, is it?

Or is it or not?

Or because he killed an Indian?

Or because he committed a crime against an Indian?
MR» WALKER:

Well, it is possible that the

20

hypothetical position that you pose, or situation that you
pose might also be subject to the same argument that we are
adopting here.
dered that.

I haven’t •— and possibly I should have consi­

It seems to me that in reaching the question, this

statutory framework differs from any other that I am aware of
in the federal system in that', not only are you considering
the territory involved, but you are also, in conjunction with
that, considering the race of the individuals involved — more
specifically, the race of the defendant.
Actually, in trying to decide which form you are
going to be in — and there are three possibilities, there can
be tribal court.

There can be state court.

federal district court.

And there can be

It is a matter of original juris-

ciefcion.
And there are four things that need to be considered
in order to make the determination.

One is the location of the

offense, whether it was within the exterior boundaries of an
Indian Reservation that is covered; secondly, the race of the
victim and race of the defendant.

And thirdly, the conduct

that is being considered, whether it comes within 1153 or not.
Fourthly, you have to determine whether or not the stats in
which the conduct was perpetrated is a state which is affected
by Public Law 280.
How, this is another matter that further goes to
complicate the question and that is, that Public Law 280

21
allowed six

states at the inception to have full jurisdiction

over all offenses committed on Indian Reservations.
For example, in California, I don't believe there
t

ware any excluded Reservations in California.

In Minnesota I

believe there was one excluded.
But in California, for example, under these same
facts, since California

a Public Law 280 state, this entire

trial would ha%7e been in California State Court as opposed to
Federal Court because it is a Public Law 280 state.
QUESTION;

Is that any different than the United

States ceding jurisdiction to Puerto Rico to have its own
crime system rather than having the federal statute decide
what should be crimes
MR. WALKER:

in Puerto Rico?
Well, the significance of Public Law

280, in our view, is that one of the justifications for this
racial consideration that is posed by the government is the
fact that the United States Government has a wardship or trust
responsibility toward Indians and the contention is that this
car only be furthered by having trial in federal district
court to protect them from the capriciousness or the dis­
crimination that might exist in the state courts and by Congress
then enacting Public Law 280, they have more or less abandoned,
in our view, this justification.
QUESTION:

But doesn't Public Law 280 require the

states that take advantage of it to make certain commitments

22

to treat the Indians equally or favorably?

I mean, it isn't

just a cession by its own terms.
MR. WALKER:

Well, there is not a different criminal

justice standard in the State of California for Indians that
differs from that for non-Indians.

If there is, I assume that

it is subject to some kind of constitutional attack.
QUESTION:

But haven't a number of states that could

have qualified under Public Law 280 declined to do so because
they didn't want to perform the other side of the bargain?
MR. WALKER:

Yes, Mr. Justice, that is correct.

Now,

as Public Law 230 is amended, it requires the legislature and
the tribe in the state to both consent to this.
I think the import of Public Law 280, however, is
that it rejects, in my mind, the contention that the only way
to further the trust responsibility that the Federal Govern­
ment has or the Wardship Doctrine, is by having a federal
district court the court of original jurisdiction.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Walker, under Idaho state law there is

a death penalty possibility, i3 there not?
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Do you want to subject, your clients to

that?
HR. WALKER:

The answer to that question, Mr. Justice,

is that under the decisions rendered in the Ninth Circuit, the
Ninth Circuit has looked at two phases of the substantive

23

crime.

One is the burden of proof that the prosecution must

meet and secondly, they look at the severity of the punishment
and when they have found a discrimination based upon race, they
have opted to give the Indians the benefit of the doubt so in
this instance, if the Court, were to adopt the Ninth Circuit
standard or opinion, in effect, the Respondents in this
instance would be given the benefit of the burden of the Idaho
Homicide Statute and I would assume, then, the benefit of the
punishment provision contained within "the Federal Homicide
Statute,
I understand, the question that you pose and I under­
stand the difficulties that it would present.
QUESTION:

However —

Then I take it you wouldn't be happy if

we were to decide in the interest of equality that all Indians
and non-Indians are to be tried in the .state courts?
You want the benefit of either one.
MR. WALKER:

The — naturally.

The problem is if you

assume a conviction, then we would not want the death penalty,
naturally, but what the effect of this district court decision
\

was before the Ninth Circuit reversed it, was that it made
conviction easier and, in effect, it was easier because of
the race of the defendants.
Naturally, if you assume that there could be a
conviction had under either one of the statutes, then we wouldn't
be happy with the death penalty situation.

But hare, the

24
Standard that the government had to meet was a lesser standard
and as a consequence, they did not have to prove premeditation
in order to obtain the convictions.
I don’t think there can be any question but that the
classification here is racial.

There has been, in the brief,

a contention made by the government that there is a politicalsocial status or relationship here and they have cited the
Mancari case.

It seems to me that the Mancari case was vary

limited in its holding in that, first of all, it applied only
to civil Bureau of Indian Affairs hiring preferences.

It did

not go to the criminal situation and additionally, it conferred
a benefit as opposed to a detriment.
It seems to me, then, that if you do agree that the
statute on its face -QUESTION:

Well, in Mancari, the statute conferred a

benefit or. the Indians, but it conferred a detriment on the
whites.

If you are arguing race or racial, I mean, certainly

the thing upheld in Morton against Mancari, in Mr. Justice
Blackmun5s opinion, was something that favored the Indians and
disfavored the whites.
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:

Correct.
Are you suggesting that the fact that it.

benefited whites?
MR. WALKER:

No, I am suggesting that the holding of

trying to take this political-social theory and take it from
the civil realm and from the employment-preference realm and
apply it to the criminal realm as well,
QUESTION:

But I thought one of your arguments was

that it conferred a benefit rather than a detriment»
MR, WALKER:

That is correct and in instances where

a benefit has been conferred? the cases coming from the Ninth
Circuit have held that there is no standing for the Indian to
complain when there is discrimination when he is benefited by
the discrimination.
For example, there was a case where there was a
difference between, the federal and state definition for the
rape statute and the Indian defendant filed an appeal on Equal
Protection grounds and the court held, yes, there is a.
difference but the difference is to your benefit and if it is
to your benefit, you have no cause to complain.
QUESTION:

Mr. Walker, there in the Ninth Circuit,

wouldn't it be possible in the future for a white man to raise
the same question and holler for a little bit of equal pro­
tection?
MR. WALKER:
possible.

I would say that it would certainly be

It would depend upon what Congress' reply to the

decision was.
QUESTION:

And if we agreed with that, wouldn't the

26
whole criminal law be sort of confused?
MR. WALKER:

I would say that there would be one way

for- the Court to rule in which there would be no difference in
the substantive definition and that has already been done in
part.

In 1153, the substantive definition of the crime is

relegated to the state definition in certain instances.

It is

now 13 major crimes in 1153,
Some of those are relegated to the state definition.
QUESTION:

Then it would have to be done by Congress.

We couldn't do that„
Is that right?
MR. WALKER:

The situation that you pose is certainly

a possibility, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

If you assume —

Now, going back, if you will, for a

moment, Mr. Walker, to your colloquy with my brother Rehnquist
about whether or not this is racial, as I understood Mr. Prey,
ar-d perhaps I misunderstood him, he said that — let's assume
a Mohican Indian who lives up in New York State and goes on his
vacation out here in the Coeur d'Alene Reservation, just as any
other tourist, and he committed this offense.

He would be

ureaten not as an Indian, wouldn’t he?
MR. WALKER;
QUESTION:
I misapprehend it,
that Reservation.

He would be tried in the state court,
So it isn't racial.

Indian, as I — unless

means a member of the Tribe who operates
Doesn’t it?

27
MR. WALKER:

Well, the cases have held that you can­

not become enrolled unless you are Indian.
QUESTION:

Well, I know that.

To be eligible to ba

a member of the Tribe you have to be an "Indian."
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:
MR. WALKER:
QUESTION:

Right,

So maybe it is racial in part.

It is not all Indians, is it?
That would ba correct.
I mean, my visiting New Yorker wouldn't

be an Indian within this definition even though he is, in fact,
an Indian.
MR. WALKER:

As I understand it, that would be correct.

You would have to be an enrolled Indian.
QUESTION:

So it is not as though you were talking

about all people of a certain race.

It is only people who were

politically members of this Tribe, isn't it?
MR. WALKER:

It might be, if you will excuse the

expression, an elite racial classification.
QUESTION:
MR. WALKER:

Or at least a segment of the whole group.
Right.

Right.

It would not apply to

the entire group.
QUESTION:

And if a member of this Tribe were visiting

a Reservation in South Carolina, he would not be an Indian if
he committed this offense on that Reservation, would he?
MR. WALKER:
would be correct

As I understand the case decisions, that

your colleague’s time, Counsel.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bowles.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN V, BOWLES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT ANTELOPE
MR. BOWLES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The one comment I might make before starting and that,
really, is not determinative of this case as far as the Idaho
death penalty itself is concerned.- that is presently on appeal
and expected to be overturned, so
The question of —. I would like to address just a
moment this “Indian" matter.

The one essential element that

must be present for an individual to come within this federal
jurisdiction is the fact that he be an Indian, that in addition
to being enrolled.
You could be adopted by the Tribe and still not come
within the jurisdiction.

And as has been stated by the U.S.

Government here, that the Indian who comes within this federal
jurisdiction here is treated no differently than anyone else
who comes within federal jurisdiction.
But I think the point we have to make is that the
reason that that person is within the federal jurisdiction is

29

because of his Indian blood.

Add that to his enrollment in the

Tribe and the locationf but there is that one essential element
that is necessary and which brings him within the federal
jurisdictional statute.
QUESTION:

There is another factor in it.

If he

committed murder in the City of Chicago, he would foe tried
in the state court.
MR. BOWLES:
QUESTIONs
MR. BOWLES:

The other reason is, he is on a Reservation.
That is correct.

There is a situs.

It is not just race.
Yes, but you have to have the race

before you get into that
QUESTION:
MR. BOWLES:
QUESTION:

And the Reservation.
Right.
Well, under the old cliche, having

Indian blood is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.
MR. BOWLES:

That is correct.

Yes.

It is absolutely

necessary.
Wow, the decisions, of course, and as the development
of the law down through the time.we started dealing with the
Indians has assumed this Wardship Doctrine and the purpose of
that, of course, was to assist and benefit the Indian.
C thin}?:, as the Court stated in the U.S. versus

Kagama case in .1886, that from the weakness and helplessness
so largely due to the course of dealing of the Federal Govern­
ment with them and the treaties that have bean promised to them.

30

there arises a duty of protection and I think from that duty
of protection — of course, it says, and with that also is the
power for the legislation»

But from that duty of protection,

under the — I think it is the Mancarl case, wherein they were
given the advantage in the employment, their duty of protection
to promote the Indian's ability to function on their own is
promoted by that and is a legitimate purpose under the duty of
protection which came out of the Kagama case and was later,
however, in the United States versus the Klamath case in 1938,
we find that the Wardship Doctrine and the duty that the
Federal Government has to the Indians is, however, subject to
constitutional limitations.
So what we are saying in essence is that it is
necessary to have this Indian blood which puts you into the
federal jurisdiction, applies a standard to you which does not
apply to any other defendants in that, state, assuming a nonIndian victim, non-Indian defendant.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bowles, could I ask you a question

about your basic theory?

As I understand it, there ara three

possible jurisdictions that might try the men, the state, the
Federal Government or the Tribe.
DR. BOWLES:
QUESTIONS

Or the Tribe.

That is correct.

Would you make the same argument if the

jurisdiction were committed to the Tribe and the Tribe had a
more severe penalty than the state?

31
MS. BOWLES

i

I think there we would be going along

with the entire policy in dealing with Indians, of trying to
recognise what we term their "independent sovereignty."

And

you would be getting into an area which was not only race but
was more emphatically this political subdivision type of
situation, where —
QUESTION:

So the answer is, you say that would be

a different case?
MR. BOYfLES:

I would view it as a different case, yes.

Now, in a recent case in 1973 of Keeble versus the
United States,, language within that decision says Congress
extended federal jurisdiction to crimes committed by Indians
on Indian land out of a conviction that many Indians would be
civilized a great deal sooner by being under the federal
criminal laws and taught to regard the life and personal
property of others.
Then a quotation from — I don't seem to have the
Con gr® a amain here but this is emphatically not to say, however,
that Congress intended to bribe Indian defendants of procedural
rights guaranteed to other defendants.

Of course, by this

comment it doesn’t exclude just defendants in federal court or
to make it easier to convict an Indian than any other defendant
and I think this is a justification for the type of application
that we have in the Antelope case,

We have to show that this

type of treatment is beneficial to the Indian under our duty of

32
protection to the Indian and by making it easier to convict
the Indian than you do any other citizen within the State of
Idaho, are we protecting the Indian?

Are we benefiting the

Indian to make it easier for him to, eventually, we hope, melt
into society and take his place there as all other citisens of
the State of Idaho or any other state.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bowles, if political reasons could

justify ceding jurisdiction to the Tribe, why canEt political
reasons justify ceding jurisdiction to the Federal Government
as opposed to the state government?
MR. BOWLES:

Well, I think it can but it is still

subject to our constitutional limitations,
QUESTION;

Political considerations must be those

which favor the Indians.
•MR. BOWLES %

I think it has

t® benefit the Indian

12 our purpose in having power and authority over the Indian
is to protect them and to benefit them.
QUESTION:

If the

transfer is to the Federal

Government but not if it was transferred to a Tribal authority.
«•»

There, that need not have to be beneficial.
MR. BOWLES:

They would be self-governing at that

point rather than the Federal Government having the power and
the authority over them.
QUESTION:

No, but it would all be subject to the

ultimate federal statutory scheme that, I suppose, would be

33
dependent on that in the last analysis,
Even if there were a transfer of jurisdiction to a
Tribe, is what I am saying?
MR. BOWLES:
QUESTIONS

Yes, as far as constitutional language,
You seem to find that acceptable, even

though it might prejudice a particular Indian defendant —
MR. BOWLESs
QUESTION:

Well —
— but you do not find it acceptable if

it fcransfera from the state to the government.
MR. BOWLES:

Well, I think it depends on what way we

are going to go and there seems to be a lot of fluctuation,
throughout the years as far as dealing with the Indians is
concerned.

Are we going to recognize their sovereignty as

much as possible?

Or are we going to continue the wardship

doctrine and, to their benefit, take more rights away from
them by furthering legislation such as expanding 18 1153 from
the original seven major crimes to a larger number that we now
have so we keep eroding their sovereignty by assuming more
jurisdiction over thorn and actually taking away their sovereig­
nty whereby our process and what is recognised in Williams
versus Lee, a 1959 case, that Congress has followed a policy
calculated eventually to make all Indians full-fledged particiPants in American society and it contemplates criminal and
civil jurisdiction over Indians by a state ready to assume
those burdens, as soon as the educational and economic status

34
of Indians permit the change without disadvantage to them»
QUESTION:

So

Well, I think the Congress has. over the

years, followed a variety of quite different and inconsistent
policies in different eras, hasn't it?

Sometimes of very sharp

changes,
MR. BOWLES:
QUESTION:
assimilation.

That is correct, Mr. Justice.
Back in the 15Q9s there was a policy of

By the 'SO's there was a policy of protecting

the identity of and the separateness of the Indians, wasn't
there?
MR. BOWLES:

Yes.

But whether or not it is acceptabl

as questioned earlier, for the jurisdiction to be left to the
Tribal Council, I think depends on how we are going to go,
on:: way or the other, in recognising the sovereignty or taking
away further jurisdiction from the Indians.
QUESTION*

And there certainly is quite an inconsis­

tency in the concepts of treating an Indian Tribe as a quasisoveralgn nation like England or Prance on the one hand and
treating Indians as wards of the state 'who need protection, on
the other.

They are quite inconsistent policies and yet each

has been reflected in the actions of Congress and the decisions
of this Court over the years.
MR. BOWLES:

That is correct:

I would agree with

that.
One other case I would like to mention here is the

35
U.,S. versus Cleveland case, which was a Ninth Circuit case
decided in 1974 and in that case, there was a difference in
treatment between Indian and non-Indian defendants based on
whether he was an Indian or non-Indian and also, both parties,
whether Indian or non-Indian defendants, were tried under
federal jurisdiction,
\nd as the Ninth Circuit has held in this case, the
government should not be allowed to do through a procedural
matter what they are not allowed to do through a substantive
matter such as was the case in the United States versus Cleve­
land case in the Ninth Circuit and it is, of course, again
pointed out the one essential element is being of the Indian
blood in order to fit into the jurisdictional scheme which
applies a.

Lifferent standard to the defendant in this case than

it would have been bed that defendant been a ncn-Indian so that
if we had asked that the Court in this case affirm the Ninth
Circuit's opinion, finding that this is a racial classification
and that the guardianship interest that the U.S. Government
has in the Indian and the Indian Nation, especially in the
State of Idaho and the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and Coeur d'Alene
Reservation, is not benefited by the 18 1153 statutory scheme
which brings the Indian under federal jurisdiction in the
feloiiy murder rule,,

Thank you. Counsel,

Do you have anything further, Mr. Prey?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.
MR. FREYs

A couple of pointrs, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think X should say with respect to the question
that Mr. Justice Stewart asked, if I left a misimpression, I
apologise but it is our view that the Mohican Indian, if he is
a member of the Tribe, if he is a Tribal Indian
QUESTION:

Of the Mohican Tribe in New York.

MR. FREYs

Of the Mohican Tribe, would be subject to

federal Indian country jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

But if he is a non-Tribal Indian living

in Chicago —
MR. FREY j

If he is not a Tribal Indian --

QUESTION:

Then he would not be an Indian within

the meaning —
MR. PREY:

Wherever he lives, if he is a member of

a terminated Tribe — I think, the Klamath Indians, for instance,
were terminated by Congress.
more.

It doesn’t exist as a Tribe any

He is racially an Indian but he is not an Indian for

purposes of this statute but the case is not quite as easy
for us as your questions would indicate.
QUESTION:

The Mohican Indians in New York building

those high skyscrapers, they don't need any help from the
Federal Govemment.
MR. FREY:

Well, they are not necessarily Indians.

3?

I mean, the question is not simply whether the Tribe
exists but whether these people continua to be members of the
Tribe.
QUESTION;

They are living right in New York City.

MR. PREYs

Well —

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FREY:

But Congress has made a judgment which

involves some, you know, when you draw a line there are going
to be some individual instances on one side of the line where
you might feel it is unnecessary.
QUESTION:

But they are not on the Reservation.

MR. FREY:

They don't have to live on the Reservation.

I mean, the fact is that they can live off the Reservation but
they may still be getting benefits from allotments, trust
payments, other kinds of

benefits that derive from their

status as Tribal Indians.
They may still be Tribal Indians even if they don't
live on the Reservation.
QUESTION:

The offense has to be in Indian country.

MR. FREY:

It has to be in Indian country.

QUESTION:

But that is a separate matter.

MR. FREY:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, I have to confess, I don't quite

understand the importance of the fact that there are some
Indians against whom that"— if you call it a discrimination —

38

doesn’t apply.

Would your case really be any different if all

Indians were subject to the same definition?

You x-rould have

the same argument,
MR. FREY:
argument.

Well, we would still make all but one

One argument -QUESTION:

Well, you can’t say that discrimination

on race, which would normally be bad — would be saved by the
fact that there v,are some members of the race who ware not
victimised by the discrimination.
MR. FREY:

Well, but it is a question of whether you

characterize it as truly being a racial discrimination and the
Court has recognised in Mancarl, for instance, that it is a
political not a racial

although it overlaps with a racial

group and I think it is important because I think what has
happened in this case — the reason we lost in the Ninth
Circuit is that the Ninth Circuit was engaging in this kind of
characterization by label.
They classified the case as a racial discrimination
case.
Now, we say, well, it doesn’t matter even if it is
but we also say that it is not a racial discrimination case.
QUESTION:

Of course, it is true.

Someone has to

face the fact that if this defendant were of any other race,
he would be subject to different jurisdiction.
MR. FREY:

If he committed this particular offense.

39

QUESTION :

If yon just change one — change his

race and you get a different restalfc.
MR. FREY:

Well, change his status.

I —•

QUESTION:

But you change the victim’s race and you

come back to this result.
MR. FREY:

Well, that is true, but —

QUESTION:

If you changed — if you just iaade one

change, namely, the race of the defendant —
MR. FREY:

But you don’t have to change his r

All you have to do is change his status.
QUESTION;

Well, you can make other changes but if

you make that change and no other —
MR. FREY:

I know, but you could take a person who

is still an Indian but who is a Canadian Indian —
QUESTION:

I understand that, but as to this defen­

dant, this defendant with a different race, the result would
have been different.
And all other facts the same.
MR. FREY:

Well, but that doesn’t necessarily near;

that it is a racial discrimination.
QUESTION:

I know that, but you must acknowledge

that to be true.
MR. FREY:

I agree that, if this defendant were a non-

Indian — whether that is racial or political, I don't know but
if he were a non-Indian, he would have been tried in the state

40
court.

Now, with respect to a point —
QUESTIONi

Mr. Frey, you never have disputed that.

MR. FREY:

No, no, we don't dispute that.

We don't

think there is anything wrong with that.
QUESTION;

You said awhile ago that there was a

racial overtone here hut I take it your position' is that, if
there is a racial discrimination, it is benign.
MR. FREY:

Well, it. certainly is at least neutral.

I don't think it has to be benign.

It is neutral and it is

in furtherance of Congress' responsibility and I find the
notion, in referring to the Cleveland case, Mr. Bowles talked
about what the Court of Appeals said and I find the language
of the Court of Appeals quite extraordinary.
The Court of Appeals said the government should not
be permitted to accomplish through discriminatory jurisdiction
what it cannot do through discriminatory statutory coverage.
To hold otherwise would allow the government to run
roughshod over the Fifth Amendment in the name of jurisdic­
tional sacrosanctity employing jurisdiction as an inviolate
tool.
Wall, the Ninth Circuit is talking as though Congress
set about to decide how it could discriminate against Indians
and impose burdens on them that are not imposed on nonIndians and decided to use the mechanism of jurisdiction.
Nothing could be further from the truth in this case

41
and I think that concept that the Ninth Circuit apparently
has just has no place in this area.
Now, Mr. Justice Marshall raised a point when
Mr. Walker was arguing about the effect of the decision on
state proceedings and I would like to emphasize that in my
view, the same rule would apply if you had a non-Indian
defendant and he were tried in state court for an offense
committed in Indian country against a non-Indian victim.
don't see why he wouldn't have the same argument»

I

Any lenient

features of federal law, he would be entitled to so that the
decision impacts not only on the administration

of federal

criminal justice but also on the administration of state
criminal justice.
We also don't say, as Mr. Walker suggested, that the
only way that the congressional responsibility toward the
Tribes can be furthered is by federal jurisdiction.
What we say is what this Court said in the Seber
case.

It rests with Congress to determine when the guardian­

ship relation shall cease.
Hero, Congress has determined that on the Coeur
d'Alene Reservation it shan't cease and federal jurisdiction
shall be maintained.
One other point.

We

don't believe that, the ward­

ship or trust doctrine requires leniency.

This notion that a

benefit to the Indians is to select out the most lenient

42
features of two legal systems, the notion that you cannot —that Congress cannot benefit the Indian interest by applying
a coherent body of federally-established law seems to be
mistaken and there are, after all, Indians living on the
Reservation besides these Respondents and their rights and
interests are also affected by the disposition that is made of
the Respondents criminal activity.
Thank you very much.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:59 o'clock a.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
