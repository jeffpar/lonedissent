PROCEEDINGS
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-1261, Secretary of Agriculture against Karen Hein*
and 75~1355^ Kevin J. Burns against Karen Hein,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN L„ URBANCZYK. ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, URBANCZYK:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
These consolidated appeals are taken by the Secretary
of Agriculture and the Commissioner for the Iowa State
Department of Social Services from an order of the Three«Judge
District Court from the Southern District of Iowa.
That order enjoins, on constitutional and statutory
grounds, parallel State and Federal regulations that have
bearing upon the amount of benefit appellees may receive under
the Food Stamp Act.
We have described the operation of the Food Stamp
Program in our opening brief.

It is necessary here only to

reiterate that benefits are provided under the Food Stamp
Program by permitting eligible households to purchase an
allotment

of food stamps for less than their face value, and

that the amount of the discount is a function of the household
Income,
Congress provided explicitly that the income of the
household was to be the eligibility criterion for participation

4

in the food stamp program, as well as the standard for determiring what amount the household is required to pay for an allot­
ment of food stamps.
QUESTION:

Household or householder?

MR. URBANCZYK:
QUESTION:

Household.

Household.

MR. URBANCZYK:

So it is a total picture.

Yes.

Congress, however, left to the Secretary the task of
*

defining income.

Income is not defined in the Act.

The

Secretary has defined income in regulations that are set out
in the Appendix to our opening brief.
This case principally concerns the reasonableness of
one of those regulations, as well as the regulation of the
State of Iowa that is similar, since the States are required
to conform their administration of the food stamp program in
conformity with the Secretary's standards.
Now, let me describe the Secretary's regulations

I “

briefly and explain how they apply to the appellee class in
this case.
In general, the Secretary has provided that all monies
received shall be Included In Income.
tions,

There are a few excep­

Tor example, for items of income that are non-recurring;

or extraordinary, but otherwise all monies received are
generally Included in income.
Now, included within the Secretary's definition,

5

explicitly, are payments received from Federal assistance
programs that were not specifically exempted by Congress.
Appellees in this case are individuals who received
such assistance in the form of an allowance that the State of
Iowa provides to welfare recipients that are attending a work
and training program.

That State program is Federally funded

under Title XX of the Social Security Act.
Now, the regulation under which the appellees received
this allowance provides for a monthly $60 flat allowance for
full-time trainees.

type of grant.

It was $44 at the time this lawsuit was

Part-time trainees receive a somewhat different
They are provided a travel allowance for

actual expenses computed on a rate-per-mile basis up to a
maximum allowable amount of $45 a month.
These allowances, like all other forms of Government
assistance not specifically exempted by Congress, were included
in the Secretary's regulatory definition of income„
Now, the Secretary's regulations also allow that
certain expenses are allowable as deductions from income.

In

part pertinent here the Secretary allows an itemized deduction
for tuition and other mandatory educational fees and a standard­
ized monthly 10$ deduction of all travel allowances, or $30*
whichever is less, to cover incidental expenses.
But the Secretary expressly has disallowed an
itemized deduction for the commutation or other incidental

6

expenses incurred by one who is attending school or attending a
training program.
X hasten to point out that the Secretary has not
singled out students who are trainees for special treatment in
this regard.

No individual, be he a student, a worker or

whatever is allowed an itemized deduction for transportation
costs.
Indeed, if you will take a glance at the regulations,
I think you will conclude that ordinary household expenses,
such as transportation costs, generally are not deductible
under the Secretary's regulations,

regulations are not treated any differently from transportation

important endeavors, like work or some other —
QUESTION:

Well, why do you draw the line between

MR. URBANCZYK:

Tuition and travel, I think, is a form

QUESTION:

It is on household income, is it not?

8

MR, URBANCZYK:
QUESTION:

It Is on household income*

When the normal person who Is not on

relief pays his tuition to college* you don't put that in your
household money.
MR, URBANCZYK:

Well., It would be included under the

Secretaryf,s regulations.
QUESTION:

But I mean anybody other than the

Secretary* does he draw a line like that?
MR. URBANCZYK:

Well* I think that It does accord

with the common sense understanding of the term "income."

Those

people that receive a scholarship* for example* are better off
than people who incur tuition expenses but don't receive a
scholarship.
I think a scholarship* for example* Is Income in
every meaningful sense of that term.
QUESTION:

Well* suppose the Government said every­

body that's beioitf a certain income* we will give you all of your
tuition* all of your books and everything else* provided you
get there on your own.
MR. URBANCZYK:

Would that be okay?
Well* certainly that would be all

right

Because that8s what you8ve done.

MR. URBANCZYK:

QUESTION:

You get there on your own.

Vie are not

9

going to give you any credit for that,
MR» (JKBANCZYK:

Well* when you say credit — The

point I am trying to make* 1 think, is that the Secretary has
a uniform and general approach to deduct from income as opposed
to inclusion in income»

I think it is very important that we

keep those two regulatory provisions analytically distinct from
one another*
The Appellees in this case receive, all receive, a
training allowance.

1 think the question then Is, or initially

is, regardless of how it Is spent:

Is that reasonably included

within the income of these recipients?
Then we must confront the fact, or the reasonable
assumption, since the record is not clear, that the Appellees
spent some or all of their, of this allowance on transportation.
And then the question is whether the Secretary is
required by the Act or the Constitution to permit an itemised
deduction for such transportation costs.

And I think the issue

in this case really focuses on the second of those two questions.
As we mentioned in our reply brief, I think, there is
now little or no dispute — I may be wrong —•that the
Secretaryls inclusion of this allowance was reasonable*

As I

pointed out, the inclusion of the allowance, separate and apart
from how it is spent, accords with a common understanding of
income.

It is income in every sense of the word.

Those who

receive the allowance are better off by its amount than

10

otherwise similarly situated individuals who do not receive
the allowance.
Indeed# the District Court focused on the deduction
provision# not the inclusion provision# and it was the State
and Federal regulations that denied a — or disallowed an
itemized deduction that was expressly invalidated by the Court.
QUESTION:

Do you have any idea# Mr. Urbanczyk# why

the District Court# after having found on the statutory grounds
that the regulation wasn't authorized5

went on to decide the

constitutional questions?
MR. URBANCZYK:

Well, I don't have an exact Idea.

I assume that# as the parties in this case have stated# the
issues upon which the statutory and the constitutional issues
turn are very similar In this case.

They are interwoven and

the whole concept of reasonableness#which is the appropriate
inquiry In the statutory issue# also bears upon the constitu­
tional issue but I am not exactly sure why the Court proceeded
onward,
I note In the Court's first opinion# the opinion that
was vacated by this Court in the first instance#when the Federal
regulation was amended,expressly did not rely upon constitutional
grounds but only on the statutory ground.
Now# this lawsuit# as I said# I think# focuses on the
allowance of —- the reasonableness of the Secretary's dis­
allowance of an itemized deduction.

11

I think the reasonableness of that regulation rests
upon two general propositions.

One, the disallowance of

ordinary expenses such as transportation costs is fully con­
sistent with the Act and is an effective and efficient method
of administering the food stamp program.
The second proposition, assuming that that general
approach at transportation costs is reasonable, is that there
is nothing in the Act or Constitution which requires a
Secretary to treat Appellee's training costs any differently
from the analogous expenditures in other households.
For the first of these propositions. I think, we can
start with the Act itself.

As I mentioned, Congress provided

explicitly that it was income that was to determine the amount
that a household is required to pay for food stamps.

Congress

provided explicitly that the amount a household be required to
pay is a reasonable investment, but in no event more than 30$
of household income.

Now, that left 70$ of household income

that Congress anticipated would be used for the household cs
other ncn-food expenses.
Thus, it seems plainly consistent, as a general
manner, for the Secretary to disallow itemized deductions for
non-food expenses,
I note, by the way, that the food stamp program, in
this regard, is different from other programs, such as AFDC,
for example, which seems to be based on actually available

12

income.
It is not actually available income that is the key
here • whereas* I pointed out that Congress anticipated that
much of the Income would not be actually available for food*
but would be not considered as part of the — but* none the
less* would be considered in the Secretarycs determination of
inc cane <,
I think an income standard in addition to being
consistent with the Act is also an effective and efficient
way of administering the food stamp program.
this at length in our brief.

We have described

And I use the terms "effective”

and "efficient" purposefully here because those are the exact
terms that Congress used in instructing the Secretary on how
to administer the food stamp program.
An income standard* again* as we described in our
brief* is certainly more effective and efficient than a standard
which requires the Secretary to determine each month the
amount of food or the amount of household income actually
available for food«,
That is a standard which requires the Secretary to
allow a deduction for all expenses that reduced food purchasing
power* and it seems to be the approach that is impl5.cit In much
of what the District Court said in this case.
Transportation costs are a prime candidate for dis­
allowance under these general principles that I have talked

13

about..

Transportation costs are incurred by many households

in the pursuit of a wide variety of endeavors.

At the same

time, such costs could be reasonably expected to vary widely
among households and to depend to a large extent on personal
consumption choices.
For these reasons, it seems especially appropriate
for the Secretary to simply let these expenses fall where thejr
lie and to disallow an itemized deduction for such transporta*»
tion costs.
Appellees, in their brief, do not appear to express
serious disagreement with the foregoing.

They do not suggest

that non-food expenses, generally, or even commutation costs,
should be deducted from household income.
Instead, the principal burden of Appellee!s brief
appears to be that their transportation costs should be treated
differently.

But, as I stated earlier, I think the second

proposition, under which the reasonableness of the SecretarySs
regulation rests, is that there is nothing in the Act — and
certainly nothing in the Constitution —«* which requires the
Secretary to treat these transportation costs any differently.
Certainly, the concept of food purchasing power which
so occupied the District Court, in this case, does not sustain
that distinction.
Appellee Karen Hein, i*/e know from the record,
traveled from Muscatine to Davenport, Iowa, to attend a training

14

program* Bit certainly there is nothing in the concept of food
purchasing power which requires that those expenses be treated
any differently than a similarly situated individual who
travels from Muscatine to Davenport because the only job
available to them is there, or a person who travels to
Muscatine to Davenport to attend a training program without
the aid of an allowance,.
The District Court, however, found that a subsidiary
purpose in the Act was to encourage education, and, as an
alternative ground of holding it, held that, the regulation was
invalid to that subsidiary purpose»
In this respect, the Court read the Act for far more
than it was worth in this regard 0

The regulation — or the

provision that the Secretary relies upon — that the Court
relied upon,does nothing more than require as a criterion for
eligibility that able-bodied individuals be either employed,
be ready and willing to find employment, be a mother or care­
taker of children or be a student»
Able-bodied individuals in any of those categories
are equally eligible under the food stamp program and the Act
appears to be neutral with respect to those expenses»
There, thus, appears to be nothing in that provision
which supports a favoring of transportation, training trans­
portation expenses, over, say, the transportation expenses of
a worker»

35

QUESTION:

Supppse the employer of an individual

allowed $50 a month to any employee in the one city who
attended extension courses at the university 25 miles away,
and that was a standard allowance to employees,

Would that be

treated by the Internal Revenue Service as income for tax
purposes?
MR, UKBANCZYK:

I hate to give a legal opinion on

that matter since it is a while since I took tax, but I believe
it would be, yes,
QUESTION:

Well, Is it not a reasonable analogy?

MRo UKBANCZYK:

I think it is,

I think that the

Secretary's definition of income does resemble the Tax Code's
definition of income, although there are some exceptions, as I
pointed out, for extraordinary and non-recurring items of
income,
QUESTION:

This would be quite different from an

automobile allowance of 10 cents a mile or a flat amount for
the purposes of carrying on the daily occupation of the
employee,
MR0 URBANCZYK:

I believe that is correct.

Yes, that

would be a specialized kind of expense, although I should point
out that part-time trainees under the Iowa program do receive
an allowance that is designated as a travel allowance.
It Is our position that, again, you must analyze the
Inclusion of that allowance and the question of whether there

16

should be a deduction from that allowance,, as analytically
separate questions0
These regulations, as wq have shown, I think, or as
we have tried to show, are consistent under the Act — with
the Act — are reasonable and therefore should foe sustained
under this Food Stamp Act as well as the Due Process Clause.
We, therefore, respectfully submit that the judgment
of the District Court should be reversed.
Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve the
remainder of my time, if I may.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mrso Williams.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LORNA XAWHEAD WILLIAMS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS (No. 75-1355)
MRS„ WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

/
I am Lorna Williams and I am one of the Assistant
Attorneys General from the State of Iowa.
There is a little irony in this particular lawsuit
for the reason that the very people that Iowa would like to
help, under this modification of the regulation, prevents
them from doing so because they are trying to protect the
rights of the trainees in Iowa's Individual programs.
It means that, first, there are not unlimited sources
to draw upon, but Iowa is proud that It Is ranked in giving ADC

17

benefits eighth or eleventh, depending on how you figure it*
from the top on ADC®
Iowa has this individual training program which most
States don't have*

It has had the program since 19^9®

It can

continue to provide this kind of thing for the people in Iowa
or anyone itfho comes there and can qualify and it is not
limited to a bread and butter course*

It even offers a

Bachelor or Arts degree if someone is in need and eligible to
do that kind of work*
The particular regulation here in the retroactive
aspect is particularly harsh on Iowa*

For here* Iowa all these:

years has been passing on to the beneficiaries , the trainees,
the amount of money it thought it would take in administrative
time and cost.

They have already passed the saving on and

instead of making a day-by-day calculation of how much did each
food stamp individual trainee in that course spend for commuting,
/

it just gave them across-the-board allowance.
That's not unlike the way the WIN program treats
people there also.

The WIN people give a $30 a month allowance,

unaccountable, no restrictions on it, plus $1 for lunch a day,
$1 for travel a day whether it is used or not.

So that, it's

want to .

They can save it if they

They .can move to the location of their school if they

18

want to.

None of their rights or benefits will be taken ai^ay

from them8

They can., perhaps, use it even on household items

if they need fco0

Maybe they moved to the college campus and

the rent is going to be $10 a month more because they moved to
Davenport*

There is nothing in Title 19, or excuse me, Title

20 program,which is where Iowa gets part of its funds for its
individual training program, that says it cannot be used on
that, because it is beyond the expectation oft the ordinary
household item*

Meals at school are included in that if they
xl^

need them*

The WIN program., There is one checking that is
required of our people who administer that program also*

They

must check at the school to see if someone was in attendance,
but they do not make the people say, "Oh, I skipped lunch today
and used the dollar for something else," or "I hitched a ride
to school today and saved the dollar/'
that if they want to.

They have a right to do

They don't have to account for the

money.
And it could very well discourage people from coming
i»1s<A the food stamp program if they had to account for how much
money they ere going to get, how they spend it.
it can hurt our trainees if they had to„

The same way

Vie don't require it

of them.
Yet now this law, this regulation as set out by the

19

Court, the modification to the regulation would so require.

So

that the people may then become discouraged and not want to come;
into either program.
The trainees at our Area 11 school right there in
Ankeny

came to our State House and complained because they

felt as though they had been singled out by having to have them
be checked at the school for their school attendance, days in
attendance.
Iowa wants to help the people and not hinder them.
And it is not uncommon now for people in one program to be
recipients and beneficiaries in another welfare program, and one*
should not curtail the activities of the other.
The Federal Court, under the Eleventh Amendment,
really shouldn't be spending Iowa's money that way when Iowa
has determined it would rather give it to the beneficiary, and
has given it to them,

.

i

Now to be called back and spend -- we figured
/

'

-

3,400 who have gone through our program since the complaint
has been filed, to review month by month, every single food
stamp calculation, recalculated month by month

it would take

one person, Your Honor, at eight hours a day, if you average
it, once you identify them, it would take between 10 and 13
years

one staff person —- if we would have to go back now to

carry out the Court order, if it took an average of eight
to identify the people, locate them, have them go from their

20

records or recollections, because the Pood Stamp law says you
have to verify everything.
So they have placed upon the State of Iowa an almost
impossible burden, to say nothing of the amount of money that
would have to be spent on staff time to do it at the expense
of the very people in the class who are bringing the action
against the state of Iowa,
I notice you asked a question a while ago as to why
the Court went ahead and gave its opinion on the constitutional
questions.

It is kind of interesting,

The Federal Government,

once we got them into the Court, took over in the trial at the
law court, but the briefs of the Appellee in both the first
trial before it was remanded and in this trial had contained
the constitutional question.
It could well be the Court wasn't quite sure about
why it should have put it on a statutory basis.

To me, I

really think that Congress in no way intended to encourage the
people in the food stamp program to go into education, nor did
it intend to discourage them.

It just said, ’’You just don't

have to — you just don't have to come to work, you don't have
to — you can get your food stamps without going to work or
without applying or trying to get a job if you are a bona
fide student,”
I think that's all that they did,

I think it was in

deference to the ~~ Iowa's program which most States don't have,

21

Iowa's program and some of the other Federal programs*
were fourteen in Iowa within the last few years*
them.

There

I listed

I couldn't believe there had been fourteen training

programs in Iowa»
But anyhow, I think it was in deference to those
training programs, all of which give us unrestricted allowance,
just as an incentive for people that take the programs, that
the Secretary wanted to include them, then gave across-the-board
disallowance*

It said, "We just take off 10$*

Some of you

don't spend one penny of it, some of you may spend all of it,
but we'll just take 10$ for everyone*"
And the people, somehow, Including Ms. Hein, were

Mr, Bartels,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D, BARTELS, ESQ.
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR, BARTELS':

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As the Appellants have indicated, the District Court
did decide this case on both statutory and constitutional
grounds, but I think as, perhaps, both of us have agreed, that
this Court need not reach the constitutional issues.
I would, therefore, like to focus my own remarks on
the statutory issues in the case.

I think it is fair to say

that the statutory and constitutional issues are interwoven,
although I think they stand independently of one another.
QUESTION:

Of course, if the District Court hadn't

reached the constitutional ground, the case wouldn't be here at
alls would it?
MR. BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor —

I think that would be the Court of

Appeals,
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think that would have

24

been an interesting issue.
This Court has in the past, I believe* taken appeals
from three-judge courts on which the grounds were purely
statutory and I believe there has been some dictum* I believe*
in Higgins v, Levine* Your Honor* that that would be permissible*
if it were decided by three judges.

But I think that under

1253 there would have been question whether this was a case
that had to be decided by three judges and there would have
been -QUESTION:

Were some of those cases backed with a

protective appeal that required them to go to the Court of
Appeals?
MR. BARTELS:
Court's normal practice.

Your Honor, I am not aware of the
I believe, though, that in Poe v„

Connecticut, the Court did take a case such as this, but in
any event*I think the fact that the constitutional issues were
addressed removes that particular problem in .this case.
I think, probably, the reason the District Court did
that was more or less as a matter of judicial economy, that
it would present to this Court all of the issues for disposition
of the case, so that if the Court disagreed with it on these
statutory issues there would be no need for a second remand in
the case.
I think Mr. Urbanczyk has described adequately the
operation of the food stamp program and the importance in the

25

program of the concept of income»
Appellee Hein’s case* in effect, illustrates the
importance of income because her training allowance was in­
cluded in income, her food stamp benefits, correspondingly,
were decreased»
Now, the District Court's order in this case enjoined
the Appellants from including in income for food stamp purposes
any allowances received for necessary commuting in connection
with individual education and training plans.
This decision was proper on two separate statutory
grounds.

First, although the Secretary, clearly, does
QUESTION:

Mr, Bartels, before you get into the

explanation of it, I'd like to get one thing sorted out in my
own mind.

Your
Your client received $220 from the AFDC, $28*75 rent

allowance and $44 training allowance, $272*75 total,
MR* BARTELS;
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor,

Supposing she had a next door neighbor

who worked as a «*- did household work of s/ome kind and earned
$272,75# and also took training at the university to become a
nurse, just did everything else exactly the same except her
income was from private sources rather than public sources.
Under the District Court cs order, do you understand
that there 'would be a differential between those two people
and what food stamps they might receive?

26

MR« BARTELS:

That's correct, Your Honor, and 1 think

the reason for that, although there would appear to be some
inequality there, the real inequality is in the Title 20 program,
that the one neighbor was not getting the assistancee
Now, the difference here is that the neighbor, as I
understand it, has $44 of earned income, as opposed to
QUESTION:

She just has a net of $272«75 that she has

earned«
i

MR, BARTELS:

Right, that all of her income is earned

inc ome.
Now, what that means is that she legitimately has
the choice of how to spend that money„

She may choose to

spend it on educational commuting, but she doesn't —
QUESTION:

She decided to go to school, just like

your client has»
MR» BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

What different choices does she have,

having made that decision?
MR, BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, if I may persist

with that, the crucial factor here is the choice that she has
not to take the education»

If she were to choose, let's say,

to spend that $44 on normal household expenses, she would still
get the same amount of incomec

Her total income and food

stamp allowance would not be effected»
However, if a person in Ms« Hein's situation decides

27

to divert the $44 away from educational expenses * she's going
to lose ito
The Secretary, here, has correctly pointed out that «
QUESTION:

Supposing she is able to hitchhike to

work?
MR» BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, I suppose that then

we are talking about whether the $44 allowance was really
necessary, and then it wouldn't be covered by the District
Court's order»

Then we've got the administrators of the

individual education and training plans who happen to be the
same as the administrators of the food stamp program in Iowa
in the rather peculiar position of sort of giving away this
$44 to someone who ddesn't need it»

And, Your Honor, that

would mean that they are expecting that money would be
divertible to normal living costs that are covered by AFDC.
And that would be in direct contravention of 42 USC 1397 C2(h),
which says that the benefits under Title 20 may not be used for
the same sorts of things that are covered by AFDC»
QUESTION:

Isn't it true, or have I misapprehended

the situation, Mr» Bartels, that this is a lump sum monthly
payment for which no accounting of any kind need be made?
MR» BARTELS:

That's not clear at all from the

record, and I, frankly, have not been able to determine whether
Ms» Hein was on a full-time or a part-time plan.

But I think

it is reallyvnot particularly important either way here, Your

28

Honor.
On the record of this case —
QUESTION:

Well, the Secretary has said, for example,

that if your client had moved to the campus where her onlytransportation was walking, she would still get the allowance.
Do you disagree with that?
MRo BARTELS:
Mso Hein's case.

Well, Your Honor, I am not sure in

Clearly —

QUESTION:

How about the general program?

We are

deciding more than one case here»
MRo BARTELS:

With regard to the general program,

Y'our Honor, we have to talk about two groups, part-time trainees
and full-time trainees.
Part-time trainees receive a mileage allowance, so
that if such a recipient moved from Muscateen to Davenport,,
the travel allowance would go down and the person would only
receive that amount of money that really was for necessary

\
commuting.
Now, the full-time
QUESTION:

This is for what, part-time students?

MR, BARTELS:
QUESTION:

—

This is for part-time —

Trainees, rather?

MR0 BARTELS:

It is called a participant in a

part-time individual education and training program.
QUESTION:

If she were full-time?

29

MR, BARTELS:
problem.

Okay*

Now a somewhat more complex

It seems to me that there is absolutely no problem

with the District Court 6s rationale or order with regard to
these part-time students.
With regard to the full-time students, it is more
complex*

What would happen here is that — I think the order

is not perfectly clear what would happen with a full-time
student who, let's say, moved to Davenport,
If we assume that not all of the «$44 or $60 a month
was needed for educational travel, then it seems to me there
are two possibilities under the order.
One is that the order doesn't apply at all because
the allowance is not for necessary travel expenses,
QUESTION:

Whose order?

Is that the District

Court order?
MR, BARTELS:

That's right, Your Honor,
I

Now, I think that it could be interpreted —
QUESTION:

But under the program, she would still

get the money; would she not?
MR, BARTELS:

QUESTION:

Well, that's right, Your Honor, but the

If she were a full-time trainee?

MR, BARTELS:

That's right, Your Honor, but the

District Court's order then, if it were interpreted in that
way, would allow the reduction of food stamp assistance.

30

QUESTION:

The District Court didn't make any such

distinction, did it?
MR* BARTELS:

No, Your Honor, it was never presented

as a distinction In the District Court, and that's, I think,
perhaps, why it doesn't cover it very clearly.

I think that

under the District Court's rationale and under a fair inter­
pretation of the order, what ought to happen there is that
there should be a determination of what portion of the $60 a
month really was for necessary educational commuting expenses.
And that portion would not be Includible in income*
Now, that does require, If that system were adopted,
that would require —
QUESTION:

It would be an administrative nightmare,
j

wouldn't it?
MR* BARTELS:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe it

would be that at all.
First of all, one could adopt exactly the same
system that the Appellants have already adopted with regard
to part-time students*

Namely, use mileage as the measure*

Secondly, Your Honor, this is no more difficult a
task than accounting for child care expenses which are deducted
out, in fact, under the administrative regulations*
And, finally, Your Honor —
QUESTION:

Is the child care on a so much per child

or is it actual money spent?

31

MR, BARTELS:

Your Honor, I believe it is the actual

charge by the vendor, so to speak, of the child care.
The other thing that, frankly, I neglected to point
out in the brief that may have some impact on this administra­
tive convenience argument is that all participants in individual
education and training programs in Iowa are AFDC recipients0
Now, with regard to such recipients, Federal regula­
tions require that income from loans and grants not be included
in AFDC income for purposes of determining eligibility and
levels of benefits to the extent that those grants are not
useable for current living costs.
And that is, essentially, the identical determination
of necessity.

So we are not talking about any additional

burden here.
I might add, Your Honor, that in terms of the

State

of Iowa6s purported interest here in this administrative
convenience,the statute under which this program is authorized
in Iowa, itself requires that in determining the need for
public assistance that the expenses, and so on, related to the
individual education and training programs be taken into
account„
So, again, Icwa^ itself, has indicated this kind of
consideration ought to be taken into account.

That8s Iowa Code

Section 249 C.ll.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bartels, if we come back a minute to

32

the $44 allowance.

Was that tailor-made for this particular

Appellee on the basis of her distance from the school?
MR. BARTELS:

Your Honor, I donEt believe it

probably was, although I really canEt tell.

It was not tailor-

made in the sense that there was clearly a maximum amount.
It could not have been tailor-made above $44.
QUESTION:

But if she had had a friend who lived half

the distance who applied for the same program and the other
facts were the same, would the $44 have been allowed the friend
also?
MR. BARTELS:

If the friend ’were on a full-time

training program, yes, Your Honor, the friend would also have
received $44,

Now, again, I believe the record does not

reflect — it was never raised as a question, and the materials
that I have outside the record are sort of conflicting on
whether Ms. Hein was regarded as a full-time or a part-time
student.
Again, insofar as some portion of the $44 might not
be necessary for the transportation of the friend — and I
think under the District Court cs order, as fairly interpreted,
only that portion that was necessary-for commuting would be
required to be excludable from this amount of income.
I might add. Your Honor, that this is essentially the
same kind of problem that this Court faced, although I donft
recall any real articulation of the administrative convenience

33

problem, In Shea va Vial pondo.,

Again, there had to be an

individ ualized d etermination„
QUESTION:

What was her actual travel expense?

Is

that in the record?
MRo BARTELS:

No, Your Honor,,

The only indication

of it is the — that the allowance was for necessary commuting
and that she did the commuting»

And from that, I think, the

District Court properly found that all of the money had been
spent and -*•
QUESTION:

Let me ask you this*

If she got $40 a

month and her actual travel expenses were $20, would the
Secretary be right in not deducting twenty of those dollars?
MR0 BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think that under the

District Court's order and rationale that it would be proper to
not include only $20 worth of that.
QUESTION:

Now, that doesn't ~~

Well, what's the difference between that

case and this case, because we don't knoxv how much she spent?
We don't even know that she spent any0
MR„ BARTELS:

No, Your Honor, I think the District

Court found that it ’was all spent and that that was a proper
inference from the materials that x^ere given»
QUESTION:

Where did it get that information from,

where in the record is that?
MR» BARTELS:
Paragraph

Your Honor, it's in the stipulation.

I guess the easiest way is Paragraph 6 of the

34

stipulation which is on page 24 of the Joint Appendix —
QUESTION:

Twenty-four?

MR. BARTELS:

— indicates that the transportation

allowance was for necessary commuting expenses in connection
with the individual education and training plan,

and then

Paragraph 12 of the same stipulation on the same page.
QUESTION:

I see one stipulation here that doesn't

go that far.
QUESTION:

Mr. Bartels, you said the problems here

are no different than Shea v. Vialpondo, but we didn't have
the difficulties with the District Court order in Shea v.
Vialpondo that we have here, do we?
MR„ BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, I think that what's

happened here is that the District Court was being very careful
to make a very narrow order that didn't bind in the USDA or the
Secretary of Agriculture.
It would certainly be permissible here for the
Secretary to respond to this holding by accounting for these
expenses.

In other words, doing exactly.what was required in

Shea v,. vialpondo, but the District Court's order does not
require the Secretary to go quite that far and would permit
some administratively more convenient system than that.

In

other words, assuming that the, for example, that the allowance
was necessary on the basis of the administrative judgment made
by individual education training plan administrators.

35

And, of course, there is a difference in this case
because we are talking here about allowances and the Court's
orders clearly restrict it to that, the extent of the allowance„
QUESTION:

But what risk of contempt do the

Governmental parties face under the kind of order the District
Court entered here, if they misjudge on some of the things the
District Court talked about?
MR» BARTELS:

Your Honor, if it is a matter of mis-

judgment, I don't think that they really have any legitimate
fear for contempt and there is still the opportunity for them
to ask for clarification of the order and what it requires, or
this Court could clarify the order and order that it be amended»
QUESTION:
question to you»

I'd like to return to Justice Marshall's

The stipulation on page 24 states that she

was allowed this amount of money and that she continued going
to classes.

It doesn't give any hint of whether she actually

spent it0
If, as Justice Marshall suggested, she got a ride
every day from a classmate or a teacher, she'd still get the
money without having spent it»

She'd still get the allowance,

wouldn't she?
MR» BARTELS:

Your Honor, she would still get the

allowance, but there was no evidence on that basis and I think
everybody

e» es»

QUESTION:

Yes, but the stipulation doesn't quite say

36

what you suggested —
MR, BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think there may be a

small loophole there in the allowance.

On the other hand, unless

one is an awfully good hitch-hiker or has a friend, there are
going to be those kinds of expenses associated with commuting
that distance, particularly if she is, in fact, a full-time
student,
QUESTION:

How many days a week does she go to

school?
MR, BARTELS:
*
QUESTION:

That's not here?

MR, BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, again

The record is not clear on that, no,

What is in the record that we can use?

MR, BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think that the main

problem at this point that the Court ought to address is the
people in the future, and it is clear that however Karen Hein
was treated and however her actual expenses broke down, that we
do have left in this case two basic groups of people, part-time
IETP students and full-time IETP students,
And with regard to the full-time ones. Your Honor,
there is no question but what they would get the allowance, the
full $60 a month, regardless of whether it was —
QUESTION:

Was this a class action?

MR, BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

Was Mrs, Hein a full-time or a part-time?

37

MR., BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, we don't know.

Well, how do we know whether she can

represent both full-time or part-time students if we don't
even know which one she was?
MR» BARTELS:

Your Honor, I would think that she

can certainly represent the group of people who received these
individual education and training allowances,,
QUESTION:

But you said a moment ago that you thought

part-time should be treated differently from full-time»
MR» BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, it is really just

a matter of sort of the administration and not the theory of
the thing,
QUESTION:

Well, but ordinarily a District Court

doesn't sit to decide matters of pure theory»

They are

supposed to decide cases and controversies between concrete
litigants.
MR0 BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think that if one assumes

that Karen Hein were a full-time student here, which seems to
be the assumption that the Secretary wants to make and which I
am perfectly willing to accept, then —
QUESTION:

Can we accept it?

You can't come here

with a record that you pull out of the thin air»
by the record in this case.

We are bound

And as I understand, the record

in this case doesn't show whether she is part-time or full-time,
doesn't show when she went to school, how many days she went to

38

school, how far she went*
MR0 BARTELS:

Your Honor* the stipulation was that

it was an allowance for necessary commuting expenses.

And the

■district Court regarded that as sufficient, together with the
other facts — I might add that there was an affidavit that
was totally unopposed from Ms, Hein saying that this was
reimbursement for necessary commuting expenses.
I think, certainly* the understanding of the work
"reimbursement*' would be that the money was actually expendedj
and I think that the .district Court's findings of that are
supported.

Perhaps* the loop-hole that exists in the stipu­

lation has to be taken care of by the additional record that's
supplied by the affidavit which is on, begins on page IB of
the Appellee's brief.
QUESTION:

This case has already been here once and

was sent back to the same three judges who have dealt with it
now,
MR, BARTELS:

Your Honor, I think, in fact, that's a

good point because when it went back down, Your Honor, the
District Court had made its findings of fact which included the
fact that this was for necessary commuting expenses and that,
in fact, the money was spent.

There was no effort at all by

the Appellants to dispute that.

There was never any dispute

about, those findings of fact in ohe District Court despite
ample opportunity to do so.

I think that's an

39

QUESTION;

Who initiated the litigation?

MR, BARTELS:

Your Honor, the plaintiff did.

Nevertheless, Your Honor, I think when the District
Court makes a finding that is supportable by the affidavits
and materials in the record, that If you disagree with it the
time to do it is at the District Court.
QUESTION:
statutory issue?

Mr, Bartels, what, precisely, is the

The statute doesn't use the work "income”;

does it?
MR, BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, it does.

Well, except — it authorises the

Secretary to prescribe the amounts of household income and
other financial resources, including both liquid and non­
liquid assets, to be used as criteria of eligibility.
It Is no more than an authorizing statute; is that
right?

The statute doesn't define the word "Income,” is

what I mean.
MR, BARTELS:

No, it doesn't Your Honor, although

there are, I think, clear Indications in the entire structure
of the Act and its purpose that this must because that's what
determines the level of benefits»
QUESTION:

Are you talking about the preamble or

7 USC 2011?
MR» BARTELS:

2011 shows the purpose and I think

also quite important In terms of showing the connection that

40

Congress saw between income and food purchasing power*
Section 2014(a) which says* "The program is to be limited to
those households whose income and other resources are found to
be a limiting factor on ability to purchase «*-"
QUESTION:

It authorizes the Secretary* then* in

rather broad authorizing language* to prescribe the amounts of
household income and other financial resources* and so on*
doesn't it?
MR, BARTELS:

That's correct* Your Honor»

QUESTION: And the precise statutory question* then*
is* what* as you see it?
MR, BARTELS:

Whether the Secretary has exceeded his

authority or has exercised* in terms of -*» I believe it would be
2013(c)* Your Honor* whether the Secretary has authorize
has exercised his authority in a manner inconsistent with the
Pood Stamp Act,
QUESTION:

Well* the Act purports to give him very

broad authority to ~~ I won't read It again -- to prescribe the
amounts of income; does it not?
MR, BARTELS:

There is no question but what the

Secretary has very broad authority and that this basic purchase
price level

that he sets for particular levels of income, and

so on* is almost to a total extent within the Secretary's
authority* but -'QUESTION:

In other -words* there cannot be any claim

here that the administrative definition of income is contrary
to some statutory definition of income., because the latter
doesn't exist in this statute; isn't that right?
MRoBARTEIB: Your Honor, it is not directly contrary
to any clear definition of income.

It is contrary, though,

I think, to the clear intent of the Act that income, because
it determines level of benefits, mustn't be related to the
household's food purchasing power,
QUESTION:

Where do you find this conflict?

What

language of the statute do you find to be in conflict with the
Secretary's regulation?
MR, BARTEXS:

Your Honor, the language of the statute

indicates that this — the purpose of this Act is to increase
food purchasing poi^er and that income is to be related to food
purchasing power.
Again, I think, 2014(a) is the —
QUESTION:
is there?

Nothing here about food purchasing power,

That's a phrase that —
MR, BARTELS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I believe that the

»« has become current in this lawsuit

because nothing in either the statute or the regulation has
used that phrase,
MR, BARTELS:

I believe "food purchasing power" is

used in 2011, Your Honor, but you are right that for the most
part it has become a means of speaking about —»

42

QUESTION;

In this litigation,

MR, BARTELS:

— the ability of a household to

purchase food* to make food purchases,
QUESTION:

2011 just — "The food stamp program is

herein authorized which will permit low income households to
purchase a nutritionally adequate diet through normal channels
of trade,"

That's it, isn't it?
And your claim is that the Secretary who is -« under

2014 — expressly authorized to prescribe these standards has
somehow violated the statute?

That is your — that issue of

the claim — that's the issue?
MR, BARTELS:

That is one of the issues, Your Honor,

The other problem in this case is that both the food stamp.—
QUESTION:

The second one is the constitutional

issue which you told us you weren't going to really talk about,
MR,, BARTELS:

No, Your Honor, I think the second

statutory issue has to do with 2014(c) and Title 20,

2014(c)

indicates that the Secretary's — or the operation of the
Food Stamp Act should not act as a disincentive to education.
Now, I think the District Court overstated it by
saying that there was to be an encouragement, but —
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR, BARTELS:

— but I think to not provide dis­

incentives is clearly there, and that's very strongly supported
by Title 20 which funded the individual education and training

43

program and the allowances Involved,
QUESTION;

The purpose —

Title 20 is not part of the Food Stamp Act,

right?
MRa BARTELS;
QUESTION;

No,, Your Honor, ltcs not, but —-

Well, the claim here, however, is that

the Secretary's regulation violates the statute — or is in
conflict with the statute under whose authority he made the
regulation,,
MR» BARTELS;

That's right, Your Honor»

And then,

I think, we have to look at 2014(c) —
QUESTION:

It is not the claim that it violates

some other statute that didn't authorize him to —
MR» BARTELS;

Your Honor, the District Court found

that it violated the Food Stamp Act because of the disincentive
to education, but I think It also is fair to say that the
Secretary of Agriculture cannot, because he is only the
Secretary of Agriculture, violate Title 20 of the Social
Security Act or defeat the purposes of Congress that are
expressed in that particular title, particularly, when the
Food Stamp Act Itself indicates a Congressional intent that
the Food Stamp Act should not operate to be a disincentive to
these kind of educational training programs.
QUESTION:

You say that's in 2014(c)?

MR» BARTELS:

Your Honor, that's a reference.

Students are exempted from the work registration requirement.

44

The practical effect of that is that you may be a student in
one of these programs and still receive food stamps.,, otherwise
you would not be able to do that unless you happen to foe
particularly unemployable.

In other words, there is no chance

that you :<?ould actually find a job through work registration»
QUESTION:

Mr* Bartels, is there anything in the

statute that would prevent Iowa from terminating the $44
allowance?
MR» BARTELS:
so,

Your Honor, in Title 20, I donct believe

Certainly, Iowa is perfectly free not to participate in

it at all.
QUESTION:

So that, of course, wouldnf't raise any

question under the Food Stamp Act?
MR.BARTELS:

No, Your Honor, that would raise the

question if there is this training program and there is not
sufficient allowances to allow, say, an AFDC recipient to
participate, that might raise a problem under Title 20, but
not under the Food Stamp Act.
QUESTION:

Not under the Food Stamp Act»

MR. BARTELS:

No, Your Honor, because then there is

no impact on food purchasing power and there is no disincentive
to education from the Food Stamp Act.

It then becomes disincen­

tive from Title 20 and certainly the State of Iowa is not —
QUESTION:

What you are saying, if I understand you,

is the more travel allowance she gets the greater the

45

disincentive because it reduces the food stamp *»- you. know, a
percentage of that is taken away from the food stamp
MR» BARTELS:• No, Your Honor, to the extent that the
allowance exceeds the needs, that may be taken into account in
food stamp calculations and reduce the benefits, so that there
would be no greater disincentive at the amounts that are above
what's necessary for the educational travel.

It is only up

to -the point at which it is necessary,
QUESTION:

Was there a stipulation in this case that

said the $40 was necessary for travel in this case?
MR« BARTELS:

The stipulation it was for necessary

commuting in connection with the individual education and
training plan,
QUESTION:

Ancl the District Court accepted that?

That is a fact in the case that the. $40 was necessary for
commuting expenses?
MR, BARTELS:

Your Honor, that's the way the

District Court has read the stipulations and affidavits in
this case,
QUESTION:

It washsfc that way, though»

a stipulation that it

necessary»

It wasn't ■

The stipulation Is that

it was granted -—
MR» BARTELS:
QUESTION:

For necessary «—

-no determination of necessity, except

by the administrative decision to grant it which would presuppose

46

that someone had made the decision0
MR, BARTELS:

Well, Your Honor, I think if we were

talking about a full-time student, one couldn't even say that
it was for necessary commuting,

I think that the way in which

the District Court interpreted that» in combination with the
rest of the stipulation and the affidavits that were submitted
in this case, -was that the grant was for necessary commuting
and that, in fact, it was all spent to defray those expenses,
QUESTION:

In order to sustain your position and the

District Court's position, we have to conclude that the $44,
that it was either a violation of the statute or a violation of
the Constitution for the Secretary to include the $44 as one of
the financial resources of this recipient; isn't that right?
MR, BARTEIS:

That's correct, Your Honor, at least

insofar as the allowance was for necessary commuting.

What

the Secretary's policy, in effect, does, Your Honor, is it
presumes for every recipient that all of the training-related
expense allowance is necess — is unnecessary for travel and
is freely available for food and living costs.

That's just an

irrational policy that doesn't give the recipient any oppor­
tunity to challenge or rebut that particular presumption,
