MRe CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 75-746, Atlas Roofing against the
Occupational Safety and Health Commission and the related
case, Irey against the Commission,
Mr, Stokes, you may proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OP MeNEXLL STOKES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRa STOKES:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in these cases involves whether our
ConsitutIon allows the Federal Government to issue fines
against its citizens without the right to jury trial of their
peers„
We submit that the clear command of the Seventh
Amendment of the United States Constitution expressly.forbids

it e
More fundamentally at issue is also the very bedrock
of judicial power under Article III of the Constitution,
These cases take on particular importance because
they are the first cases to come before this Court of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and its enforcement
structure which is unique.
The most obvious consequence of the Occupational Safety
and Health Actcs enforcement structure is the United States

4

Government seeks fines against its citizens administratively
without the right to jury trial during any stage in the
proceedings»
Under this most unusual enforcement structure of
penalty, the inspector issues citations and fines, turns
civil penalties,
A citizens recourse is to another administrative
agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission,
which is still part of the Executive Branch of Government,
Unlike other penalty statutes, there is only limited
judicial review in the Court of Appeals and all facts which are
determined administratively are conclusive if supported by
substantial evidence.
We submit that this Executive agency, the delegation
of power to this agency, violates the Constitution in its
relationships, first, to its citizens, and that is providing
a right to jury trial, and second, in its relationship

to the

Judicial Branch0
A ruling in the Petitioner's favor will do no more
than uphold the Constitution, as we have traditionally and
historically known it,
We submit that a ruling in the Government's favor
will ..effect the most profound redistribution of power among the
three branches of Government»
We are not asking the Court to expand on constitutional

5

rights c.

We are merely asking the Court to recognize the

traditional and historical right recognised by our forefathers
in the Seventh Amendments that a citizen has a right to jury
trial when the Federal Government seeks a fine against him
in whatever manner and whatever form it takes0
We ask no more than that and we submit the
Constitution will tolerate nothing less»
Now* under OSHA* the Executive Branch of Government
has been vested with plenary powers to determine and assess
fines administratively* without the right to jury trial and in
violation of the Seventh Amendment* which provides that a
citizen has a right to jury trial in suits at common law,
where the amount at controversy exceeds $20»
This particular provision is extremely ciearo - And.athe
history is extremely clear that a suit at common law, totally
and imequivoeably embraces a fine sought by the United States
Government„
At the time of the passage of the Seventh Amendment,
both in England and the United States, a citizen would have been
afforded a right to jury trial when the Government sought a
fine against him»
In England and, at the time cf the passage of the
Seventh Amendment and for years before, a suit, a fine would
have been brought on the judicial si.de of the Court of
Exchequer»

And there, they would have gotten a right to jury

6

trial under the common law side»
As we have briefed in our brief* all the States *
virtually, all the States*

would have granted jury trial for

fines and forfeitures at the time of the enactment of the
Seventh Amendment.
The history of this amendment* in England* was
preserved in America under the Seventh Amendment in 3791.
Only in America did England ever attempt to deny citizens jury
ferial* and that was under the Americas Trade Act in the Courts
of Vice Admiralty which* historians tell us is one of the
sparks that ignited the Revolution and directly led to that
provision in the Declaration of Independence that said that
King George has denied us jury trial in many cases.
Well* when Hancock's ship* the sloop Liberty* was
seised in Boston Harbor in 1767* along with its cargo, England
also brought a case against him for an -in .personam fine of
triple the amount of the goods.
Well* he hired a young lawyer to defend him in those
days* a Boston lawyer, John Adams®

And Adams® argument is just

as valid before this Court today as it was 200 years ago* when
he said* "The legislative authority by which this act is passed
is grievous enough* but the way it is enforced with these
Executive tribunals* makes it more penal than any other
statute in the realm."
He said* "My client is not" — and I am paraphrasing

7

a little bit — He said, "My client is not tried by the law of
the land* by jury trial, but by single judge,"

And he says,

"No matter hov? fair that judge is, it makes this act extremely
penal and my client has lest a precious right, the right to
jury trial,"
Well, in 1791, this right was imbedded in the
Constitution for all Americans to come, as it was passed and
codified in the Seventh Amendment™ In response to a call and
one of the foremost cries against the Constitution as originally
drafted was the want of preservation of the right to jury trial..
It is now in grave jeopardy because now, 200 years
later, the Federal Government is seeking fines against its
citizens in Executive tribunals with much similar procedures
as those Courts of Vice Admiralty,
But more fundamentally at issue in this ease is the
very bedrock of judicial power.

The Third Circuit opinion

,

in the case of Frank Irey, basically held that the United
States Government can vest. Congress can vest an administrative;
tribunal with enforcement powers — in this case penalties —
and thereby eliminate the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial.
Implicit in this holding is that Congress and not the
Courts has the power to determine when and if a provision of
the Constitution applies, merely by vesting it in an administra­
tive agency,
Judge Gibbons and the other three dissenters in that

8
case* as they so astutely pointed out, that if Congress can
determine by legislative fiat when and if a provision of the
Constitution applies and thereby define the meaning of the
words ’'suits at common law, " what role do the Article III
courts play?
He also pointed out that it would be an absurd
spectacle if the only branch of Government bound by the Bill of
Rights would be the Article III courts„
And in commenting on the majority's holding of their
interpretation of Jones and laughlin v, the national Labor
Relations Board, he pointed out that if that case is
interpreted for the breadth that the majority gave it,
unbeknownst to the world of legal scholarship, that case
effected the most profound and enormous redistribution of
power of any case in the history of the united States,
QUESTION;
MR, STOKES;

What's your interpretation of the case?
Mr, Justice, our interpretation of

Jones & Laughlin merely stands for this doctrine that Congress
can vest an administrative agency with traditional equitable
roles, that is the cease and desist power x^hich is an equitable
injunction remedy and an incidental back pay remedy which is the
classic restitutionary remedy.
But beyond that, they cannot vest an administrative
agency with powers that are judicial suits at common law,
QUESTION:

What if the NLRB, in that case, had

9

ordered only back pay?

Would you say that it would have had

to go to court and be tried to a jury?
MR, STOKES:
type of remedy,

If the

» the back pay Is a restitutionary

I would say that would be permissible in that

ease.
It arose in a situation where the NLRB had a cease
and desist power coupled with back pay.
But in 08HA you are dealing with a naked vengeance
penalty, where the Government is putting a penalty on its
citizens for past violation.

It is the devoid of any

equitable consideration, devoid of any restitutionary element
and devoid of any compensatory element,
QUESTION:

Do you limit your argument to cases

where the sanction Is a money sanction?
MR, STOKES;

In this case, we are not trying to

invalidate any abatement powers of the courts.

We are merely

saying, in the posture of these cases, they arise in a posture
where, in these cases, they are monetary penalties, $5,000
sought against Irey and $600 sought against Atlas Roofing
Company,
We submit it Is that violation that offends the
Constitution, the collection of monetary penalties, which are
not at all incidental,

Of course, they could not be equitable

remedies under the classic doctrines that equity will not
enforce a penalty and will not enforce criminal sanction,

10

particularly the criminal provisions.
We submit* as we have briefed* that they are in
no sense ancillary and that in this case they are primary.
As a matter of fact* thafch all that is being sought in these
esses0
QUESTION:

You recognize that the administrative

regulatory agencies can sometimes decide questions that
involve not $5*000 but millions of dollars without the inter­
vention of a jury trial?
MR, STOKES.:

Yes* sir* we do recognize that,

And*

as I cited Professor Davis in his treatise* he said
they can involve regulatory orders involving millions
of dollars* but they cannot assess $20 in a penalty. In
Professor Davis* treatise that we have cited to
There is a great distinction, because if these
cases arise on $5*000* but the sa^me principle applies* no
matter how it is* if it is in excess of $20, we submit to
the Court,
QUESTION:

At what stage in this procedure do you.

think a jury trial attaches?
You haven!t really told us about the procedure and*
as you say* it is novel* and I wondered “«do you think the
Constitution would foe satisfied if it provided a jury trial at
any stage?
MR» STOKES:

Yes* sir

QUESTION:

Could you describe it a little bit?

MR. STOKES:

At any stage.* either under the normal

regulatory penal powers, they either have to bring the
penalties originally in court, or they have de novo review.

!
1

In this case, neither is provided5 as a matter of
fact* it is expressly stated that it will not be provided and
it even has conclusions that the facts of the Commission are
supported on substantial evidence.
1

In this case, it is not provided at any stage.
QUESTION:

By your submission* the Seventh Amendment

would be satisfied, would it, if a jury trial were provided
either to try the original assessment of the penalty or by
de novo review later, at the end of the proceeding,
MR. STOKES:

Precisely, Mr, Justice Stewart, that

is our position*
QUESTI®!:

The Seventh Amendment, in your submission

would be satisfied in either event, is that it?
MR. STOKES:
QUESTION:
MR. STOKES:
QUESTION:
MRo STOKES:

Yes, sir.
Before whom, a. court?
Before a court, an Article III court.
And a jury,
And a jury.

It doesn't stipulate,

of course, as to whether the locus of it would be in an Article
III court.

We would submit it

QUESTION:

isn't there?
MR* STOKES:

There is a limited Court of Appeals

review,, where they have a substantial evidence test —
QUESTION:

Universal Camera.

MR* STOKES;

But in Universal
No* of course* that

was a National Labor Relations Board case*
In this ease* there is a raw penalty* as,.arises in
this particular ease* $5*000* and another one* $600*
In support of its position —
QUESTION:

Mr, Stokes* going to your broad position

that you can't commit this power to the Executive* supposing
there was a two-stage procedure where there was first a
determination of a violation and an order to comply* and then
a refusal to comply with that order?

Could the Executive

Branch then impose penalties for that by analogy

to contempt

for violation of an injunction?
MR* STOKES:
separate proceedings*
under this Act*

Yes* sir*

And that would be in a

There is a similar proceedings to that

It has a most unusual thing in which a

decision to contest can* in fact* subject you to cumulative
penalties on top of that?if the inspector comes back and says*

13

"I don't think you contested in good faith," or if he says,
"You didn't abate," then it can attach up to $3.,000«
QUESTION;

I understand.

That's not directly involved

and I am wondering if your argument would cover that situation,
as well,
MRe STOKES:

That would be a separate proceedings,,

You see, that is backing up the equitable remedies,
QUESTION;

Do you contend there would be a Jury trial

required in that procedure?
MR, STOKES:

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice Stevens, that

would be very similar to the Federal Trade Commission enforce­
ment power, where they have to go to court for the failure to
abate or the failure to comply with its orders.
QUESTION;

Why wouldn't the answer to the jury trial

requirement be that that's analogous to an equitable proceeding
where there has never been a requirement of a jury trial and
contempt for violation of an injunction?
MR. STOKES; Again, they are seeking a monetary
penalty.
Now, you may say that you get a back pay award,which
is an incidental restitutionary award and that the penalty is
still money, but it is compensatory, restoring the status quo.
It was never a suit at common law, but when you get to a penalty,
it was always a suit at common law, a classic suit at common law
which we have submitted in our briefs and we noted that the

14

Government did not contest
QUESTION:

A violation of an Injunction

— a suit

for money for violating an injunction would not be a classic
suit at common law, would it?
MR» STOKES:

That could very well

Yes, sir, that

could be that it is not In that'. Depending on the penality, it
I'jould be in the nature of a contempt-type case.
QUESTION:

Well then, your PTC enforcement proceedings,

they go to the Court of Appeals and if you disobey an order of
the Court of Appeals in force in the administrative order, you
are subject to contempt and you don't have a jury trial In the
Court of Appeals, do you?
MR* STOKES :

On the contempt issue

It is my

understanding that procedure Is correct, that you do not have
a jury trial.

But If you do not comply x^ith the order of the

Commission, you then face, I believe, it Is up to $5,000 a day
penalty which Is brought in directly in court.
QUESTION:
MR0 STOKES:

In the District Court, in the PTC

That is my understanding.

QUESTION: In your case, if the ruling is that you

order, stop killing people and. Incidentally, pay $5,-000 fine,
you are not contesting the whole first part, you are only

15

contesting the last part*
MR, STOKES:
QUESTION:

It cs the $5,*OOO which we —
The rest is okay without a jury*

MR9. STOKES:

In this case, there was no contention

that there was not abatement when the ditch was closed up
immediately and it was never an issue in this case, in the
Frank Irey case*
QUESTION:

And in the old, traditional case where

you get an injunction and damages, you say in the second part
you have to have a jury, in-the first part, you don't»
MR» STOKES:

That would be our interpretation,

Mr. Justice Marshall,
In support of its position, the Government cites the
tax and immigration cases with the doctrine that they can bypass
the Seventh Amendment,

But in these tax and immigration cases,

they are unique areas where the plenary power of Congress has
been recognized as complete and exclusive.

This power has been

traditionally limited, even in those cases, to only these unique
areas,
Now, the Government urges that these cases be expanded.
QUESTION:

Why is the power of the Government under

the Commerce Clause so much less than its power under the tax
laws or under the immigration laws?

MRo STOKES:

If there is an immigration

Mr, Justice Rehnquist, under ~~

16

Traditionally, the Government has always had — the Legislative
part of the Government, the Executive part of the Government,
albeit all governments, have had the power to control its
borders, free from the interference of courts,
Also, in taxation cases, they have always had this
power»
In England, at the time of the passage of the Seventh
Amendment, a revenue case would have been brought on the
revenue side of the Court of Exchequer, but a fine and penalty
case would have been brought on the judicial side of the
Exchequer»
In these cases, particularly, the courts, as they
have stated in these particular unique areas, have been
careful to say this is only confined to these unique areas»
Similarly with the legislative line of court cases,,
where Congress has plenary powers to deal with the District of
Columbia and other territories, in which that power has been
upheld because the Congress is then acting as a State, with a
concurrent jurisdiction of State and Federal»
QUESTION:
question:
Court?

Going back to my Brother Marshall's

What kind of trial would you have in the District

What would be the issue?
MR* STOKES:

It would be de novo review on the facts,

very similar to the other statutes which we are familiar with»
What comes to mind is de novo review ~~

17

QUESTION:
MR. STOKES:

No res judicata

afc all?

Not on the penalty cases.

It would be

very similar to other de novo reviews, such as the Coal Mine
Safety Act, as we Interpret the Coal Mine Safety Act to be.
QUESTION:

Even though the administrative finding has

been sustained on appeal?
MR. STOKES:
QUESTION:

That would be opposition*
Well, let's suppose that it is then tried

out before the administrative agency and it goes to the Court
of Appeals on the record, is that right?
MR. STOKES:
QUESTION:
MR. STOKES:
QUESTION:

It goes on the record, sir.
And it is sustained?
It is sustained.
And then you would say that the Government

wants to sue you for a fine.

It*s de novo in the District

Court?
MR. STOKES:

If you do not give de novo view on the

facts in the District Court —
QUESTION:

/

That's right, because you don't have a

right to jury trial.
MRo STOKES:

That's right, you have no right to jury

trial, and there is nothing left.
QUESTION:

Following up my Brother Brennan's

question, the issues would be at least two, in your submission,
whether or not there was a violation, and then assuming there

18

was a finding

there was a violation- what the amount of the

penalty should be, both?
MR. STOKES:

That would be our position.

Of course,

fines could be determined judicially, since fines are
traditionally determined judiciallya
QUESTION:

Normally, a jury assesses damages and

normally a judge imposes — it is in his discretion to impose
punishment.

Which would it be here?

MR. STOKES:

It would be the fact of the violation.

QUESTION: Simply the fact of the violation, not
whether or not the monetary award was — not what the penalty
should be?
MR. STOKES:

Yes,

And Mr. Justice Stewart, these

are within the traditional realm of juries.

QUESTION;

The typical facts

Usually, the jury determines the amount,

too, except when it is criminal punishment, then with seme
exceptions, in some States — in most of the States, I think,
the judge determines what the sentence shall be.
Which would it be here> in your submission?
MR. STOKES:

Well, in our original brief, in our

original petition for certiorari which xvas not granted on this
issue, we took the position that a civil penalty is nothing
more than a penal fine.

Certainly to a corporation, there is

no difference in a $10,000 fine to a corporation, criminal fine,

19

than

b.

$10>000 civil penalty.

We are dealing with semantics,

but the effect is the same,
QUESTION:

The Court found against you on that and

we did not grant certiorari on that question.
MR* STOKES:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
But, in any event, on this question,

the Seventh Amendment question, would it be open to the jury to
decide hoi>j much the penalty should be, in your view?
MR0 STOKES:

We would say that that would be up to

Congress to determine.

Congress, within its power, could say

that would foe up to the judge, but as to the facts, the
Seventh Amendment, we say, is quite —
QUESTION: Whether or not there was a violation?
MR, STOKES:
QUESTION:

That's right,
At least that much, you think, is trial

by jury under the Seventh Amendment,
MR, STOKES:

That is our entire position.

And if not,

you are left with a device that circumvents the Seventh
Amendment, in a nice, neat, little package that says, "Well,
initially, we go to this administrative agency and then we go
to the Court of Appeals," and somehow the right to jury trial
just evanesces.
And, if it is going to be done in this statute, then
I submit, and we have briefed in our papers, the Administrative
Conference of the United States in its recommendations

20

to all other agencies , that all other agencies get this power.
QUESTION:

Mr» Stokes, you keep saying be realistic.

If you go before a District Judge and the District
Judge, without a jury, puts a $5,000 fine on your client, that
would be bad, right?
Yet If you go before a jury and the jury says that
you should be fined something and the same judge gives you
$5,000 fine, you wouldn't complain,.
MR-. ■ STOKES :

Something wrong.

That is precisely our point,

Mr» Justice Marshall,
QUESTION:
still get $5,000. .
MR» STGKES:
guilty.

Well, there is something wrong.

You would

,
That presupposes that the jury finds us

And we have a right to a jury of our peers and the

interposing of a jury between the Judiciary, albeit in this
case, It's not judges with life tenure.

It's administrators,

hearing officers,
QUESTION:

I thought my Brother Stewart was trying

to get you to say the jury ought to set the amount, too.

You5d

be better off if the jury — I mean speaking realistically,
as you like to say,
MR, STOKES:
QUESTION:

That would be our position, sir.
You wouldn't think you would have any

right to enjoin the administrative proceeding pending some
jury trial?

21

MR4 STOKES:

There is some — In the Beacon Theatres,,

Dairy Queen trilogy, there is language that would indicate that
there Is a possibility that —
..QUESTION:
MR* STOKES:

What's your position?
We would say that that would be in the

discretion of the judge handling It, but in this case, we would
say that the abatement would go on.

There is some language

that says that the equitable side is then stayed until the
Judicial side, but we are saying if Congress did provide, which.,,
of course, it is not provided in here, which is a fatal flaw —
We are saying that that would be, the whole realm would be
deferred until after the administrative action is completed.
QUESTION:

With the statute silent like this one

you would think that the administrative proceeding should abate
until the jury trial.
MR* STOKES:

Correct.

No, we would say the

administrative proceedings would go on and you would have
de novo review *—
QUESTION:

I am sorry.

So, you wouldn't say in

this case you would have any right to enjoin an administrative
proceeding until there is a jury trial.

MR. STOKES:

I tvould not think that that would be

a right.
QUESTION:

Is it your claim that because of the

failure to provide a jury trial at some stage of the proceeding;

22

here* this legislation is simply constitutionally invalid?
Or* is it your position that judicial decisions can scmehovj
patch it up?

In other words —

MRS STOKES:

Mr*.Justice Stewart, there is no

provision in here —
QUESTION:

Under your submission, should the court

hold this legislation to be invalid constitutionally and then
leave it to Congress to enact some nex-* law, providing at some
stage of the game a jury trial?
MR« STOKES:

The penalty provision should be held

unconstitutional, unless and until a jury trial is provided
at some stage in the proceedings —
QUESTION:
MKo STOKES;
QUESTION:

By Congress*
By Congress,
That would leave the abatement and all

the other kind of orders perfectly constitutional, I take It*
MR» STOKES:

Just like the National Labor Relations

Board type of proceedings, cease and desist type of proceedings,
and many others *
Now, the Government has cited cases, such as Katehen
v, Landry, which arises under the Bankruptcy Act, in vihich a
preference can be determined without jury trial*

But there, a

litigant has to voluntarily submit himself to that jurisdiction.
Similar reasoning Is on the sovereign immunity cases
where you go before the Court of Claims*

There, a litigant has

QUESTION:

We say that these

Do you suggest there is a right to a jury

trial in connection with an involuntary proceeding in
bankruptcy?
MR, STOKES:

Yes, sir. in a preference — in a plenari­

ae tion, where —
QUESTION:

Yes, but how about just the matter of

declaring a person bankrupt?
MR, STOKES:

Well, there, you voluntarily submit,

you are declaring bankruptcy.
QUESTION:

Oh, involuntary?

I said involuntary,

MR, STOKESj

In Involuntary preference, where you

are seeking *—
QUESTION:

Just when all of a sudden you. find that

creditors have filed a petition to have you declared bankrupt*
and you say, ”1 demand a jury trial because the net effect of
this will be to transfer all my property 'co the trustee, so
I demand a jury trial,”
Do you think you could have a jury trial for that?
MR, STOKES*.

You don't have a jury trial for that.

These have been upheld, as I understand it, because of the
equitable nature of an accounting of the race in bankruptcy.
It's an equitable type proceedings, sir.
QUESTION:

It is a historic test, is it not?

24

MR» STOKES:
QUESTION:

It is, yes, sir,
Mr. Stokes, is it part of your position

that this kind of proceeding must be committed to an Article
III court?
MR, STOKES:

Yes, sir.

We would like to reserve.? Mr, Chief Justice, the
rest of my time for rebuttal.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr, Solicitor General,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H „ BORK, ESQ»
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR, BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
It is apparent that the acceptance of Petitioners'
contention that a jury trial is required by the Seventh
Amendment before any civil penalty may be imposed under the
Act would go a long way towards collapsing this program.
It should be remembered that we are dealing with an
act that covers over five million work places and sixty-five
million employees,

A jury trial requirement would make it

effectively impassible to administer GSHA effectively and
uniformly, as cases -would back up, jury trial cases would back
up before more than four hundred District Court judges.
I should correct one statement.

This tribunal we are

dealing with here, the Review Commission, is not an Executive

25

Branch tribunal»

It is an independent agency»

Now, there is very good reason -QUESTION:

You are not suggesting that the abatement

provisions are not valuable in the enforcement —
MR, BOSK:

They are valuable* but I think they are

not as valuable as they* not nearly as valuable as they are
with this penalty proceeding.
Now* with 1300 compliance inspectors and five million
work places' in the country* it is quite obvious that it would
be — the abatement procedures alone would not be terribly
effective in achieving a national standard of health and
safety in work places.
The employer has no incentive whatsoever to comply,
no monetary incentive, no private incentive to comply with
this statute and these regulations beforehand.
QUESTION:

He can wait.

In addition to the penalties that

Mr. Stokes was talking about, that is, .just the imposition of
$2,000, $3,500, whatever

and that's what he is talking about,

that that requires a jury trial, as I understand it.
But then, in addition to that, aren't there sanctions
for failure of the employer to obey an abatement order which
would be much more in the nature of a contempt and, therefore,
perhaps, not trial by jury?
MR, BORIC;

There are other sanctions.

Once the

order has been enforced by the Court of Appeals, it is then

26

enforced and there is a sanction in the nature of contempt,
just as there is in a Federal Trade Commission order,
QUESTION:

Yes,

And they would he left untouched,

MR. BORK:

They would be left untouched by this and,

indeed, they might be much more severe than any penalty provided
here.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BORK:

My point, Mr, Justice Stewart, in response

to Mr. Justice Brennan, simply is that the existence of a civil
penalty gives employers an incentive to comply before an
inspector comes around and' finds a violation and issues an
abatement order.
Absent the penalty, the Act would be much less
effective because you only wait and nothing happens to you
until you have an abatement order and the Court of Appeals
enforces it and then you comply.
So the civil penalty feature is an integral part
of this statute and that *s why I say that acceptance of
petitioner's argument would go a long way towards collapsing
*

this program as an effective national program,
QUESTION:

I suppose as a matter of practical

operation and administration of this statute, nothing really
happens until, in most cases at least, until an employee is
injured or killed.
cases,

That seems to be the case in these two

27

MR, BORK:

I think ’.that probably is the case,

although I cannot speak with authority to that*
QUESTION:

I mean with that many shops, as you say —

MR * BORK:

That would draw the attention of a program

which has a relatively small number of inspectors.
QUESTION:

Maybe it comes out of an —- from an

informer, or something.
MRe BORK:

Are there,any just routine inspections?

Yes, there are.

There are some routine

inspections, but obviously where there has been an injury, it
is likely to draw the attention of —
QUESTION:

Yes.

And that's, I think, what happened

in both of these cases*
MR, BORK;

Both of these cases*

QUESTION:

Mr,Solicitor, is there any history of

unions in various plants acting the role of informer?
MR, BORK:

I do not know, but I assume — I am

certain that there are.

I do not have an example at my

command, but I am certain that that takes place,
QUESTION:

Mr, Solicitor General, my understanding is

that routine inspections are routine.

They are regularly

conducted on a fairly extensive basis,
MR, BORIC:

Well, there are, Mr, Justice Powell.

I

was just suggesting that you would get to an employer faster
if there has been a serious accident, and the —
QUESTION;

Right

28

May I ask this question:

After there has been an

evidentiary hearing before the law judge, and let's assume the
employer wishes to appeal to the Commission* may it appeal as
a matter of right?
MR* BORK:

No* as I understand the scheme* the

Commission may review or may not*

But then if the Commission

does not review* I understand the employer has an appeal to the
Court of Appeals*
QUESTION:

Yes* but he then appeals from the decision

of the law judge*
MR» BORK:

That{s as X understand it, Mr* Justice

QUESTION:

Mr* Solicitor General, in National

Powell,

Independent Coal Operators case last year against the Secretary
of the Interior -— X don't recall if you argued that or not* but
there was no question raised in thLt case here about the right
to a jury trial where there was an administrative penalty*
only the question of whether explicit findings were required*
I notice you cite that case* but jour friend does not*
How do you think that bears on this ease?
MR* BORK:

Well* I think

there is another case

like that* the Turner-Alcorn case where the same lack of a
.challenge to a scheme of this sort was present*

X don't think

that the Court addressed it directly and* therefore* I think
we have been assuming that the Seventh Amendment poses no bar

29

in these eases»

But those cases don't directly assess it, they

just assume it.
I would like to say that there is in this case, it
seems to me* tooth history — I think there is a square conflict
betttfeen. the Petitioners and ourselves about what history shows»
And there is also a long line of decisions in this
Court which i^e think squarely governs this case»
QUESTION:

May I interrupt you once more* Mr. Solicitor

General.
If your friend prevails here* then someone in the
future could certainly raise this question of the jury trial
with reference to the Coal Mining Safety Act.
MR. BORK:

1 think it's entirely true that a number

of regulatory schemes will
QUESTION:
year's opinion.

I was. just scanning the opinion —* last

It has no reference to it because obviously

the parties didn't raise it.
MR. BORK:

As we know* the Eastern District of

Kentucky now is* I think* very backed up with penalty eases.
Acceptance of this contention in a society which intends to
regulate the environment and safety and health and other
matters*, would really* I think* pose an impossible problem
for the courts in the future*
If all civil penalties had to move through Jury
trials* I don't think the Federal Judicial system could handle it*

30

QUESTION:

Assume that your position is correct as

applied to the limits of the penalty In this ease., under this
statute, do you think that would be true without reference to
the amount of the penalty?
MR» BORK:

Yes, Mr* Chief Justice,

amount of the penalty is the crucial factor*

I don't think the
I think the

crucial factors here are the -« this is a public right ease,
rather than a private right case.

It is not litigation

between two individuals — which is somebody attempted to
move into an administrative agency.

You can do seme of that,

I think, under the Constitution, but there may be limits as to
how far Congress can go there.
But this is a public right case.
Secondly- I think «- I will advance what I think is
a solid, although perhaps somewhat novel proposition, but I
think it is solid in history, that the Seventh Amendment was
never intended to apply to a case in which the Government was
a party.
And thirdly, I think it is also true that the
penalties here are intertwined with equitable remedies, and
in themselves there is great discretion over the size of the
penalty.

It is intertwined with the abatement action and

supports the abatement action.
So, 1 think that under the Jones and laughlin
case or under the Kafcchen case, I think that line of cases, too,

31

support this.
Those are three reasons why I think;

I don't offer

any of those propositions, that is, that it is a public right
case, the Government is a party and that it is intertwined
with an equitable remedy.
Perhaps those three propositions do not completely
exhaust the field of the Seventh Amendment and explain all
practices, but we offer them as analytical factors.

And when

you look at them, I think they are the major analytical factors
that come out of the history and out of the cases, and I think
when you look at them you discover that this case lies right
at the core of the kind of case that may be moved by Congress
into administrative adjudication.
QUESTION:

Your public right analogy seems to me to

create a rather strange hiatus because you have a — when the
Government proceeds against a person criminally, they clearly,
the defendant clearly has a right to jury trial under the Sixth
Amendment.
When a private individual pursues another private
individual for damages in the Federal Courts, you concede that
the Seventh Amendment guarantees the jury trial.
And yet, you are having this kind of intermediate
classification, no jury trial.
MR, BQRK:
Rehnquist.

That's quite right, Mr„ Justice

32

I think if we look — one reason for that la
historical and the other reason is a policy reason.
We are flatly in conflict with Petitioners on the
history and we would refer the Court to the history developed
in the article by Frankfurter and Corcoran which is cited at
page 81 of our brief, among other places, which shows that
historically* in this country both civil and criminal penalties
were administered by magistrates and by non-jury means before
the Revolution and after the Revolution* often with fines up
to 500 pounds which was quite a good deal of money in that
time.
So* historically, I think, we have recognized a
public policy area, a public right area, where no jury trial
was required»
And the reason for that, historically, and today,

1 think, is quite plain.

And that reason is that we want speed

of administration, we want informality, we want expertise in
the tribunal, which we have developed here in this Review
Commission, and we want uniformity of decisions when we are
administering a public right policy across the nation»
QUESTION:

Mr* Solicitor General, if your argument is

valid, I think it would follow, would it not, that the Federal
Trade Commission could be given the power to impose penalties
for price fixing?
MR» BQRK:

Penalties — the Federal Trade Commission

33

a civil penalty?
QUESTION:

Yes.

$10 million.

MR. BOSK:

I beg your pardon.

QUESTION:

$10 million* because the amount is

irrelevant.
MR. BQRK;
Mr. Justice Stevens.

I think amount probably is irrelevant,
At least, I've never seen a case in

which amount was thought to be relevant.

For example,

v. Mitchell, a tax assessment, and then an additional assess­
ment for fraud at 50$, which amounted to about $365,000, which
this Court held was a civil penalty, and it was administratively
imposed through a tribunal of the Board of Tax Appeals which
has an adjudicative structure just like the OSEA structure.
QUESTION:

So you do agree that your argument above

would apply with equal force to the Federal Trade Commission
imposing a penalty for price fixing?
MR. BGRKi

I think it would, Mr. Justice Stevens.

QUESTION:

As far as you know, Mr. Solicitor General,

has the Government ever before taken the position, even
argumentatively, that the Seventh Amendment doesn't apply to
any civil action in which the United States is one of the
parties?
MR. BQRK:

No, as far as I know, that position,

Mr. Justice Stewart was evolved in my office, primarily *-»
QUESTION;

Somebody got a bright idea over in your

34

offlce and then you just pursued It,
MR0 BORK:

He got a very bright idea and then left

for England with me to argue the case,

QUESTION:

Because that's a very extreme position and

a fascinating one* I must say* but it is contrary to at least
a good deal of dicta in this Court —~ and contrary to a good
many assumptions that we've made, isn't it?
MR0 BORK:

I think It is, Mr* Justice Stewart, but

I think that the demonstration — our case does not rise or
fall -«
QUESTION:

I know, but you spend about half your

brief on that proposition and it is an extraordinary one0
MR, BORK:

It is extraordinary, but I think,

Mre Justice Stewart, if one looks at the way the Seventh
Amendment was framed, the preceding guarantees of jury trials,
it obviously applied to private litigation in the States*
The proposals from the States for the Seventh
Amendment only applied to private litigation.
Thomas Jefferson — we rely heavily upon the Virginia
Declaration of Rights which is confined to private litigation,
Thomas Jefferson proposed, as we note in our brief, a jury
trial for every tax, every immers ement, every penalty that
was rejected,
I think the history is fairly clear.

In fact, I

35

think it is unambiguous *
QUESTION:

We don*fc need to accept your bread*

sweeping argument In order to sustain .your position* do we?
MR, BORK:

No* Mr, Chief Justice,

That8s why I

pointed out that we have three propositions* all of which
point in the direction of sustaining the judgments below,
QUESTION:

Mr, Solicitor General* one other point*

If we have to have a jury trial* do you agree that
it has to be an Article III judge?
MR, BORK:

I don’t think so* Mr, Justice Marshall*

because I would hate to see the law develop in a way that is*
that there must be a jury and It must be an Article III judge*
because I think with the regulation that exists in this
society* and the one we fairly predict will come to exist in
this society* that would be a terrible blow to the Federal
Judiciary,
It would make it impossible*for example* for
alternative types of tribunals to be devised to deal with
repetitive factual claims of a relatively simple nature.
And I don’t think the Federal Judiciary could handle the flow
of litigation that regulation would then generate,
QUESTION:

Mr, Solicitor General* it would only be

impossible to the extent that penalties were Imposed In the
0

first instance.

Isn't that true?

MR, BORIC:

But I think* Mr, Justice Stevens* that's

36

going to be a fairly useful feature.
Unless we multiply the number of enforcement
personnel enormously* it is simply impossible to deal with
these wide-ranging factual problems, as I say, in five
million work places, unless there is some incentive to comply,
other than the fact that an agent showed up and issued an
abatement order»
QUESTION:
develop in this way»

You say you would hate to see the law
But what we are talking about is a

historical provision adopted in 1791a and it is not a broad
general provision, at all»
Clause»

It is not like the Sue Broeess

It is really a question of is it or isn't it, isn't it?

Rather than something we had a great deal of discretion in
deciding whether it should or should not apply»;
MR» BORK;

Quite right, Mr*Justice Rehnquist»

I didn't mean to suggest that»

I was replying to

Mr» Justice Marshall's question of whether if a jury trial were
provided, it would have to be provided in Article III form»
I was simply saying that I hoped the law would not develop in
that way because I don't think; the Federal Judiciary can
handle it»

But I quite agree with you that the history in

the case is controlled -«
QUESTION;

Are you suggesting in response to

Mr* Justice Marshall's question that we could say a jury trial
is required and you would nonetheless have the Administrative

37

Law Judge summa non venire?
MR@ BORK:

I would hope. Mr,. Justice Rehnquist, that

that position could he sustained ;Ln another case, because of
the reason I gave to Mr* Justice Marshall, but that isn't a
case we have before us today»
I think it is rather clear in terms of history and
in terms of the prior cases that no jury is required in this
ease,,
Now the Petitioners' contentions, I must say, are
kind of like a loose cannon, because they don't really draw
out the implications of their arguments»

And the acceptance

of their arguments, really, have extraordinary results»
For example, there is in their brief the contention
that somehow the Commerce Clause is not a very plenary power»
It is a plenary power, but it is not as plenary as other powers
A metaphysical argument that I don't follow with
great facility *•*»

but that under other powers Congress may

delegate to administrative adjudication factual determinations
just like this»

But they, may not under the Commerce Clause

because the Commerce Clause simply isn't strong enough to do
it „
And then they argue that if it is something that
could be an Article III case or controversy, and it is a
commerce power, not only do you need a jury, but you need an
Article III forum, which I think is quite wrong»

33

And I should point out that not only is it quite
wrong* but everybody has been overlooking that argument for
all these years because If it is true then all of the agencies
based on the commerce power are unconstitutional and have been
for years*

That is* you couldn*t have the ICC* the SEC* the

FTC* the CAB* the FCC and so forth* all of the Commerce Clause
agencies,
QUESTION:

You couldn't have them impose civil

penalty*
MR, BORK: No0 Their argument* I believe* Mr* Justice
Rehnquist is broader®

They say if it is a case or controversy*

then you can't take it out of an Article III tribunal unless
you are using a power other than the Commerce Clause,
It is a complicated argument and one does not follow
all of its steps* but nevertheless that's the way it comes out*
which means jury or no* all of these factual determinations
being made by all of these agencies under the Commerce Clause
are being unconstitutionally made if they look like a case or
controversy*
QUESTION:

Why was it the agencies could do anything

that an equity court could do* but couldn't do what a law
court could do?
MR, BORK;
be their point*

Well* Mr, Justice Marshall* I — that may

Maybe they, have two points* but it seems to me

at one point in their reply brief* beginning about page 33* I

39
think, they are really arguing that factual determinations of
a case and controversy nature must be made in Article III
tribunals, and may not be removed under the Camerce Clause,
although they could be removed for reasons which are not
apparent under the revenue power or under the immigration
power -QUESTION:

Well, if they say that, that closes up all

the agencies *
MR* BORK:

I think that’s what they have loosed upon

us in that argument*
QUESTION:

Well, it didn’t sound like the argument he

*- your colleague was making this morning*
MR* BCSRK:

That is quite true, Mr» Justice White, but

I think it is in the brief and I thought I ought to mention
the fact that the arguments are somewhat diffuse and X think
they have implications that haven’t been analyzed fully*
But, in any event, I — on the history point, I
must -- if there is no time to argue it orally, I must ask that
the Court refer to the Frankfurter and Corcoran article which
establishes, I think, beyond a doubt ; that civil penalties
much larger than this in the real money of the time were
regularly and routinely administered without juries in
Colonial times and after the Revolution*
QUESTION:

Did that article apply to in personam

judgments as well as -

40

MR» BORIC:

Oh* yes*

I understand* Mr» Justice

Stevens* but the fines and penalties, and so forth* being
administered were in personam and they were regulatory*
regulating hunting and fishing* liquor and a variety of other
fields of endeavor»
So I think the history is quite clear»
1 think it is also quite clear that the case law is
against the Petitioners»

Jones and Laughlin., of course* is a

ease which I think is directly on point here because* as I've
suggested, the money penalty here is as intertwined with the
equitable remedies here as was the case in Jones and laughlin»
So that the rationale of Jones and Laughlin directly applies
here»
In addition* Jones and laughlin suggests, as was said
in Southa11 Rea1ty and in Curtis v. Loether that if it is a
•

i

public right case, an administrative agency case, you simply
don*i need a Jury»
And that is true here also and Jones and Laughlin,
of course, is an administrative determination made by a tribuna
or by an agency set up under the Commerce Clause»
So it is not at all one of these other powers which
Petitioners find so much more powerful than they find the
Commerce Clause,,
Helvering v, Mitchell, I would suggest is directly in
point also»

It has an administrative structure and a procedure

41

for fact finding which is almost identical to that here* and
for that reason* 1 think* the history and the policy and the
case law all suggest affirmance of this case.
Petitioners have largely ignored that*

Their reply

to our argument about American legal:history is to ignore the
Goldschmidt Report and to ignore -- which was cited in our
brief

and to ignore Frankfurter and Corcoran ~~ and to

discuss instead of American legal history the practice in the
English Court of Exchequer»
Their reply to our policy arguments* I think* is
essentially to declare that practical matters are unworthy of
discussion in a constitutional context»

1 think they are not»

And their argument on the law* insofar as it proceeds
from Article III* is unique and would have devastating results
to administrative agencies insofar as it proceeds by dis«
iinguishing the cases»

I suggest that the distinction has not

been made* that this case is identical to any number of cases,
QUESTION:

I can't think

of its name and I don't see

it cited in any of the briefs*
What's the case in which we held that a petty offense*
subject to not more than six months in prison* may be tried
without a jury?
MR* BORK:

Well* that's a case* Mr* Justice Brennan*

which escapes my memory* but that was a case that came up in
argument in the Muniz v, Hoffman case, which was the question

42

of criminal contempt,
QUESTION:

Can yon help me out?

Can you remember

another *—

MRo BORK:

Well* I think I am about to be able to

help you out* sir*
It says here that the last name is Hamlin* Mr, Justice
Brennan,
QUESTION:

Hamlin?

MR, BORK:

Hamlin,

I remember we discussed that in the Muniz v, Hoffman
case.
That raises an additional point I think that ought
to be made.

There really ought to be some congruence between

the Sixth Amendment and the Seventh,
It is quite clear here that if Congress had decided
to be really Draconian about these matters* it could have
provided for six months imprisonment and no jury would have
been required,
Muniz. Vo .Hoffman suggests where a $10*000 contempt
sanction* criminal contempt sanction against a union was
upheld as not requiring a jury trial under the Constitution,
That case suggests that had these penalties* $600
and $5*000* against corporations been assessed criminally*
there probably would not have been a need for a jury trial.
So it surely cannot be that vie have the paradox that

43

a Congress decides to proceed with a civil action rather than
a criminal action, thereby, finding itself hampered and the
greater procedural protections are required because they decided
to use a civil action instead of a criminal action.,
QUESTION:

Well, the law is full of paradoxes and

the fact is that the Seventh Amendment guarantees a jury trial
in civil actions and other provisions of the Constitution
guarantee a jury trial in criminal eases and other provisions
of the Constitution, at least implicitly, based upon historic
reasons, do not provide for a jury trial in a contempt action»
Now, the Court has subsequently said that if the
imprisonment is longer than six months, there is a jury trial
in a contempt actions but generally speaking, historically,
there never was a jury trial in an action for contempt of
court»

And this is just history»

paradoxical, but it is history.

Not logic, maybe,and maybe
And also it involves the

specific provisions of the Constitution of the United States,
for better or for worse.

Maybe they are paradoxical.

Maybe

they are inconsistent, but there they are.
MR» BOKK: My point, Mr* Justice Stewart, was that
it would be paradoxical and that the paradox need not be
created*

It need not be created not because of the Sixth

Amendment, but it need not be created because of the history
i

of the Seventh, which, aside from our argument that the
amendment never applies when the Government is a party, clearly.

I think* the history shows that where public right is concerned
these kinds of penalties have been imposed without a jury trial
throughout our history.

And my primary reliance is upon history

and upon the decisions of this Court* Mr. Justice Stewart*
rather than upon inference from the Sixth Amendment,,
I don't believe in multiplying paradoxes needlessly
and I was merely pointing out that I think this paradox need
not be created6
QUESTION:

Mr* Solicitor General* with your emphasis

on history* I wonder if —- because it is really not discussed
in the briefs and I am not sufficiently familiar to know*
does the history of the Seventh Amendment .indicate* perhaps*
that one of the concerns of that Amendment was the relationship
between the Federal Government and the States?

And one thing

the drafters of the Amendment were concerned with was the
problem of excess of Federal power* and might that be relevant
to our problem' here?
MRe BORK:

It might be*.

There is no discussion

anywhere* so far as I am aware* Mr* Justice Stevens*

There

is no discussion in the drafting or the framing or the
proposals that go into the Seventh Amendment* nor in the
ratification debates of the Seventh Amendment.

There is no

discussion of anybody's fear of the Government as litigant and
that this is in any way designed to cure or to safeguard that.
All of the discussion is about proposals which purport

45

to save the jury trial in suits between man and man, which we
think Is a phrase that only means private litigation, or in
suits respecting property.
How, of course, the suits respecting property dropped
out.

It was never proposed by Madison when he drafted the

beginning of the Seventh Amendment.

So that this idea that

somehow the Seventh Amendment was to protect the citizen
against the Federal Government, I think is quite wrong.
There is no suggestion in the debates about that and, in fact,
as Frankfurter and Corcoran point out

I hate to keep coming

back to that article, but it is the mine of information on
this subject — the colonists were entirely used to Government
litigation in which fines and penalties were imposed for
regulatory purposes without a jury, because they wanted speed,
they wanted uniformity,
QUESTION:

Mere these matters of speed and con­

venience underlying the decision of Congress when they passed
the Tucker Act and the Federal Tort Claims Act to have no
juries in those cases which, of course, are strictly civil
eases, arenEt they?
MR. BGKK:

They are, indeed.

The argument is made,

Mr. Chief Justice, that those were not suits at common law
because the Government had sovereign Immunity. I am not
entirely persuaded by that argument, but, for example, if you
sue the Government in the Court of Claims and the Government

46

counterclaims for an amount much, much larger than your
original claim, nevertheless, no jury is required*
counterclaim

And that

has nothing to do with sovereign immunity*

QUESTION; But that, again, is justified on the quite
independent grounds that frequently when you counterclaim > in
a suit you can be treated as if you had brought the suit in the
first Instance, that you may be subject to many rules that you
wouldn't be subject to if the counterclaim

were entirely

independent of the original suit»
MR* BGRK;

I think, Mr* Justice Rehnquisfc, that that

would probably not be the case, one suit in equity and somebody
came back with a damage action*

And the first party wanted a

trial as to the damage action» But in any event, my real point
can be illustrated another way, which is, for example, the
renegotiation litigation comes from the Renegotiation Board into
the Court of Claims*

It is only a question of whether the

Government, :as a contractor, is paying too much, or not„

No

jury trial*
I don't know that that kind of thing can be explained.
We've got lots of practices of that sort*
QUESTION;

But that isn't a practical action for

MR* BOKK;

Well, I don’t know, Mr* Justice Rehnquist,

damages*

in what sense that is not a classical action for damages

—

Certainly, if that is not a classical action for damages and

4-7

therefore not a suit at common law, as the Seventh Amendment
requires, Mr* Justice Rehnqulsfc, then I think it is quite clear
that these penalties here are also not actions for damages, and
are not suits at common law,
QUESTION;

It should be treated as an actual

affirmation of the contract, the Renegotiation Board thing,
MR, BORK;

Well, one can,

I suppose, apply that term

to it, but the fact is that the Government is going for money
from a contractor and no jury is required,
in the Government's counterclaim* .

No jury is required

There are lots of these

things whieh I think are best explained by the fact that the
Government is a party.
But this Court need not accept that principle in its
totality to decide this case because, I think, all of the three
principles discussed here point to the fact that this ease is
at the core of Congress' power to move a dispute into
administrative adjudication *

actual cases in which that occurred»
As for the policy* X think the majority said it best
in the Third Circuit opinion in Footnote 11* X believe* it was*
when they said they couldn't understand why de novo review
was not provided because it is the de novo review* far from
using it* it is the availability of the remedy»

And there*

they analogize it to a local fire department* that a citizen
would hope he would never have to use it but he takes comfort
in knowing it's there»
Mow* we have cited that there are only less than 50

everything in the world went wrong»

Then eventually the Court

of Appeals got around to it, He would he put under an order*
and the Government's position that the first tends to make the
employer follow the Act»
MR® STOKES:
QUESTION:

Mr® Justice Marshall, so does
You agree with that, don't you?

MB.® STOKES:

Yes, sir®

So does every other criminal

penalty for which Jury trial is provided®
QUESTION:

This isn't criminal, now, —-

MR® STOKES:
QUESTION:

Well, any other penalty, sir.
What's your understanding of the law in

a criminal case where the only authorised penalty is a fine?
MR® STOKES:
QUESTIGM:

$500, is that ~
What's the constitutional rule?

Suppose

there is a statute that says that the only penalty for this
crime is a fine, but you can foe fined up to $1 million?
MR® STOKES:

We would take the position that that is

unconstitutional, that is certainly more than a petty fine,
which is my understanding of the case as it has been defined
at the $500 range®

I could foe wrong, Mr® Justice White, on

that.
QUESTION:

The test is whether or not it is a petty

offense.
MR. STOKES:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Mr® Stokes, you called our attention to a

50

case called People v, Chevrolet, or Plymouth, or something
1 don't find it —•
MR* STOKES:
QUESTIONS
MRe STOKES:

It is In our reply brief, sir„
In your reply brief»
When the Government cites that this

would collapse the penalty structure of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970, but more fundamentally it may
very well collapse a realistic Seventh Amendment right against
«"* when the Government seeks fines against its citizens»
You know, we are not dealing here with a balancing,
as Mr6 Justice Rehnquist pointed out»

We are dealing with jury

trials»
When all is said and done, it gets down to this.

You

either have a right to a jury trial when the Government seeks
a fine against you or you don't have one»
I really believe that this case is going to stand as
a high water mark beyond which the Executive police power of
Government cannot go without providing jury trial»

Or it will

be the breach of the dike that creates a virtual tidal wave of
similar legislation»
We submit that OSHA is the breach of the dike»
We would hope that dike tsould be plugged in this
case»
Thank you very much*
It is at page 7 in our brieff
