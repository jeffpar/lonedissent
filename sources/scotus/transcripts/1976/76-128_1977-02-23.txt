MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Mr. Wilson, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE A. WILSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. WILSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
My name is George Wilson.

I am Deputy Attorney

General for the State of Maryland, and I am her® on behalf of
■the appellants to argue in favor of the constitutionality of
Maryland’s filing deadline for independent candidates seeking
a place on Maryland's general election ballot.
Appellee Bruce Bradley, an unsuccessful independent
candidate for the United States Senate,and his supporters con­
tend that the deadline is so far ahead of the election that it
impinges on their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amend­
ments to the United States Constitution.

The three-judge court

agreed, feeling bound by this Court's summary affirmance of
the three-judge court decision in Sal©ra v. Tucker, out of
Pennsy Iva ni a.
As in most, other states, the bulk of the candidates
who appear on Maryland's general election ballot do so ©s a
consequence of their success in th© party primary elections.
Priirtary elections are held by each political party with which

4

ten percent or more of the state's registered voters are
affiliated.

Other candidates who wish to have their names

appear on the general ©lection ballot must file nominating
petitions in accordance with the requirements set forth in
section 7-1 of Article 33 of the Maryland Code.

Those require­

ments can be summarised as follows:
First# the petitions must be signed by three percent
of the registered voters eligible to vote for the office in
question determined as of four months prior to the primary
election»
Second — and this is the element upon which the
court below focused — the nominating petitions must be filed
by the same date on which party primary candidates must file
their certificates of candidacy.
the primary election.

That is seventy days before

This results in an early March deadline

in presidential election years# when the primaries are held in
May# and an early July deadline in other years when the pri­
maries ar© held in September.
Next# the nominating petitions may be circulated and
signed at any time prior to the deadline.

There is no gather­

ing period restriction like those, which have been present in
other cases in this area previously considered by this Court#
nor is there a gathering period restriction similar to the one
•that was present in the Salera case.
Next# persons who wish to vote in the primary

5
©lection are not precluded from doing so or having signed a
nominating petition on behalf of an independent candidate.
And petition signers need not state thair intention to vote
for the candidate whose petition they sign.
And, finally, unlike the case in the situation in
some other states, petitions may be circulated by nonresidents
and persons not registered in Maryland, and the individual
voters® signatures need not be notarized.
The challenge in this case, and the opinion of the
lower court which we seek to reverse, focused entirely on the
filing deadline of 70 days before the primary election, and
particularly on the

deadline as it operates in a presidential!

election year where it occurs in early March.
In this case, on the March 8, 1976 deadline estab­
lished by the Maryland statute, Mr. Bradley filed a number of
signatures which, if they had all been valid signatures of
registered voters, would have been sufficient to satisfy
Maryland's three percent requirement within the statutory dead­
line.

However, more than 20 percent of those signatures proved

to be invalid.

And when Mr. Bradley was thus denied a place

on the Maryland ballot, he filed suit in the United States
District Court.
He argued below and he argues to this Court that
Maryland's early filing deadline, as he characterizes it, de­
nies him equal protection of the lav; as aid unreasonably

6
impinges upon his First Amendment rights and those of th©
voters who would support him»
H© succeeded in persuading the three-judge court
below that Maryland's deadline falls too far in advance of the
general election and lacks sufficient supporting state inter­
est and therefore impinges upon his constitutional rights»

In

essence, he persuaded the lower court that its decision in
this case was controlled, absolutely controlled by the decision
of th® three-judge court in the Pennsylvania case of S a lei: a v.
Tucker, which was summarily affirmed by this Court earlier
this year»
Based upon its reading of the summary affirmance in
Salera v. Tucker, the three-judge court below granted Mr.
Bradley injunctive and declaratory relief.
With the benefit of the additional time allowed him
by the lower court, he went on to become a candidate, albeit an
unsuccessful one, in the general ©lection of 1976.

This appeal

followed the granting of relief by the lower court and this
Court noted probable jurisdiction in October.
While th© case is now before the Court for plenary
consideration on its merits, and while this Court thus need not
concern itself with th© significance of its prior summary
affirmances to quite the same degree as the lower courts must,
we have argued in our briefs that the lower court here sub­
stantially misapplied the teachings of Hicks v. Miranda and its

7
proginy with respect to the significance of prior summary dis­
positions by the Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

It did —

Hicks v. Miranda dealt with the signifi­

cance of prior dismissals for want of a substantial federal
question, didn't it?
MR. NILSQN:

That's correct, it did.

But I believe

the Tally case subsequent to Hicks v, Miranda, strongly indi­
cates, if not clearly holds that summary affirmances from threejudge court decisions would be treated the same way and ac­
corded the same weight that —
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:
MR. NILSQN:
QUESTION:
was there?

At least «as much weight.
At least as much weight.
There is nothing new about that —
That’s correct.
— with respect to summary affirmances,

In Hicks v. Miranda, the new ground it broke, if

it was new ground, was it had to do with dismissals for want of
a substantial federal question, wasn't it?
MR. NILSON:

That’s correct.

But I don't believe

prior to Hicks v. Miranda it. had been clearly established just
*

what the import of summary affirmances was either, and I think
even after Hicks v. Miranda there were same commentators who
argued that there was still a distinction and that perhaps
summary affirmances were not entitled to quite as much weight
as the Hicks kind of summary disposition.

But I think that the

8
Tully decision of this Court places the two on equal footing»
The lower court, we submit, the error that it mads was
to adopt a particular reading of the lower court's decision in
Salera v. Tucker.

And assume ‘that this Court summarily affirmed

the decision in that case, in the Salera case, on precisely the
same analytical grounds which the court below thought had been
applied by the lower court in Salera.
The Pennsylvania stata tor y scheme dealt with in Salera
required independent candidates to gather their nominating pe­
tition signatures within a three-week period ending 49 days
before the primary election and either 218 or 244 days before
th© general election, depending on whether it was a presidential
election year or not.
Th© Salera court felt bound to uphold the three-week
gathering period in light of the opinion of this Court in Storer
v. Brown, upholding on its face a 24-day gathering period in
California.
I would submit that the Salera court was wrong in that
respect, particularly insofar as it examined th© gathering period
by itself.

Having thus upheld that short gathering period,

feeling compelled to do so, the Salera court then went on to
invalidate the Pennsylvania requirement that signatur® gathering
stop and all petitions b® filed 49 days before the primary elecV

tlon.
The lower court her© chose to read Salera as treating

9
these two requirements, gathering period and deadline, as
separate and distinct from one another, ami assumed that this
Court likewise viewed them as separate and distinct in summarily
affirming.
We would submit that such a reading of Salera is not
correct and would be clearly contrary to the analytical approach
establish®! for thes© kinds of constitutional questions by this
Court's written opinions in Williams v. Rhodes, Jenness v.
Portson, American Party of Texas v. White, and Storer v„ Brown.
We believe that the jurisdictional statement in Salera, thin as
it was, properly presented to this Court the question of whether
a three-week signature gathering period in conjunction with an
early deadline was unconstitutional.
We further submit that the proper way to read this
Court’s summary affirmance in Salera is as a holding that the
combination of such a limit®! signature gathering period and an
early filing deadline is'unconstitutional.

AFTERNOON SESSION — 1:00 P.M.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?
MR. NILSON:

Mr. Nilson, you may resum©.

Prior to the luncheon break*.

I was dis­

cussing Sal era v. Tucker and the summary affirmance and noted
that the jurisdictional statement in that case, thin as it was,
had properly presented to this Court the question of whether a
three-week signature gathering period, taken in conjunction with
an early deadline, was unconstitutional.
Me further submit that the proper

way to read this

Court's summary affirmance in Salera is as a holding that the
combination of such a limited signature gathering period and an
early filing -deadline is unconstitutional.
with this result.

We have no quarrel

W© believe that it is consistent with the

prior written opinions of this Court to which I have referred
prior to the break.
However, such a result in no way compels or ever, sug­
gests a conclusion that Maryland's filing deadline, unaccompanied
as it is by any limitation on the period during which signatures
may be gathered or by any other significant restriction, is un­
constitutional .
QUESTION:

Mr. Nilson, let me interrupt you.

Has Mr.

Bradley made any noises about running again?
MR. WILSON:
QUESTION:

About running again?
Yes.
;

MR. WILSON:

To the extent that he continues to desire

11
to seek the United States Sanate, there are no present election
campaigns.

I don't believe he has made any statement that I am

aware of, certainly not in the record in this case, as to whether
he will or will not.

I believe hs did indicate during the cam­

paign that he was — that this was not just a ons-shot foray,
that hs was into politics.
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON:

You don't think th© case is moot?
Pardon me?
You don't think the case is moot?
I do not believe the case is moot.

I

think this Court's opinions on mootnass, especially on th® con­
text of ©lection cases, make it clear that th© case is not moot.
W© have a statute that has bean declared unconstitutional,
admittedly the elation is over, but Mr. Bradley as far as we
know, and the record indicates nothing to th© contrary, is in
politics' to stay and will again b@ an independent candidate.

If

hs is a candidate again, he would be an independent.
I think, as I say, Storer v. Brown discusses the moot­
ness question.

The mootness principles are also discussed in

the lower court opinion in Salara.

I think all of those cases

ar@ —
♦

QUESTION:

Why isn't it moot,?

You say it is likely —

it is difficult —
MR. NILSON:

It is the kind of situation which is likely

fc© occur again with the filing deadline and yet will be

12
susceptible of evading review.

And I think the opinion in

Stcrer indicates clearly the reasons v?hy in these kinds of

cases they should not be considered moot.

It will resolve the

challenges and the questions prior to the next election so that
we don’t have last-minute cases brought up again on the eve of
the election,, as this case here.
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:

And I think —

Well, they always are.
Pardon me?

I say they always are.
That’s correct.
Whatever we do, whatever you do with this

case.
MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:

There will b® another case, I am sure.
There will be many of them in the next

election year.
MR. NILSON:

But I think at least it is important to

resolve the constitutional status by this Court now that we are
here with respect to the filing deadline under Maryland law.
I might add that the lower* court’s opinion added an
element of uncertainty even beyond the particular holding in that
case by indicating or suggesting that perhaps Mr. Bradley was
entitled to even more relief than effectively a primary date
deadline.

In addition, the analysis of the lower court that was

applied to our statute raises serious questions even about the
modification of the statute that Mr. Bradley has suggested in

13

his brief.
An examination of the primary written opinions of this
Court which control the outcome of this case, to wit, Williams
v. Rhodes, Jexmess v. Fortson, American Party of Texas v. Whit®,
and Storor v. Brown, enables us to identify certain basic prin­
ciples which are to be applied.
First, generally speaking, where state ballot access
laws are challenged, they should b® considered in their totality.
And individual provisions, at least where they interact with one
another and relate to one another, should not be singled out and
treated in isolation.

The exception for an individual or a

single factor which does not interact is discussed in this
Court’s opinion in Storer v. Brown and clearly is not applicable
in the present situation.
Secondly, the First Amendment and equal protection
analyses merge, and in the context of requirements imposed upon
independent candidates boil down to two related tests.

First,

do ballot access requirements constitute —- and I am quoting
from this Court’s prior opinions ~ insurmountable obstacles or
suffocating restrictions which make it impossible or impractical
for an independent to gain a place on the ballot? or do they
provide a feasible opportunity for reasonably diligent inde­
pendence to run.
Secondly, do they promote a substantial imbalance in
the relative difficulty for independents and primary candidates.

14
In other words, are they inherently or invidiously more burden­
some as to independents.
In resolving the issue of the substantiality or dis­
criminatory natura of the ballot access requirements, this
Court’s opinions instruct us to examine actual experience in the
state in question as a principal guide.

Substantial burdens and

discriminations may be justified even if they exist if they
serve compelling state interests, if they are — and again, I am
quoting from American Party of Texas v. White — reasonably im­
posed in pursuit of vital state objectives that cannot be served
squally well in significantly less burdensome ways.
With respect to compelling interests, this Court has
established that the states have a compelling interest in pre­
serving the integrity of the electoral process and regulating
the number of candidates on the ballot to avoid undue voter con­
fusion and are free to assure -themselves that a candidate is a
serious contender with a significant level of community support.
This Court’s opinions also establish that it is a
legitimate and compelling interest on the part of the' state to
provide parity of treatment and to fix identical deadlines for
primary aad independent candidates respectively.
And finally, it is clearly permissible to provide dif­
ferent routes to the printed ballot so long as they are not
substantially unequal in their difficulty.
In applying these principles, this Court has only once

15
invalidated a state ballot access regulatory scheme in a written
opinion, and that was Williams v. Rhodes, where this Court invalidated the Ohio scheme calling for 15 percent of the voters
to sign petitions on behalf of parties by February 7th in the
©lection year and required these parties, these lesser parties,
to develop an extensive party organisation and engage in other
organizational activities prior to this February 7th deadline.
Conversely, in Storer v. Brown, a 24-day gathering
period was facially upheld, coupled with a five parcent signa­
tur® requirement, although the case was remanded for reconsider­
ation in light of the number of voters — the question involving
the number of voter's who would be disqualified from signing
nominating petitions by their participation in primary elections.
In the American Party case, a deadline of 120 days
before the general election was upheld, coupled with a 55-day
gathering period and requirements as high as 5 percent, depend­
ing on the office, together with a disqualification of primary
voters from signing nominating petitions.
And finally and perhaps most importantly, in Jennass
v. Fortson, a deadline of S9 days before the primary, 150 days
before the general election was upheld, even though coupled with
a six-month gathering period and a five percent requirement.
The Georgia law upheld in Jenness was either the same as or more
stringent than the Mary lassi law here at issue in every single
respect except that here the deadline occurs approximately three

16
months earlier in a presidential ©lection year, -three months
more prior to the general election.
This Court's summary affirmances of lower court de­
cisions upholding valid access restrictions are entirely con­
sistent with these written opinions.

In Socialist Labor Party

v. Rhodes, which was summarily affirmed by this Court, as
Sweetenham v. Gilligan, the issue was squarely presented to this
Court as to the validity of what was then Ohio's nine-month
deadline, nine months before the general and SO days before the
primary.

That case was summarily affirmed.
In Pratt v. Begley, another summary affirmance, this

Court was squarely presented with the issue of whether — of the
validity of a 55-day pre-primary, seven-month pre-general dead­
line.

Again, Pratt v. Begley was summarily affirmed.
Jackson v. Cgilvie, also involving a pre-primary deadline

and a five percent requirement, again summarily affirmed.
Auerbach v. MandeX, Maryland People's Party v. Mandel,
and Wood v. Putterman, all dealing to on© degree or another with
the precise nominating requirements now before this Court, with
all thro© lower court opinions upholding the law in the early
seventies and being summarily affirmed by this Court.

Notwith­

standing the lower court's dismissal here of these three summary
affirmances involving the precis® same statote we are now pre­
sented with, we submit that those cases did raise th© constitu­
tional questions now presented.

They were clearly posed in the

17
jurisdictional statements,, at least in Auerbach and People’s
Party, and Auerbach was later cited in Storer v. Brown, in
Footnote 10, as constituting a prior approval by this Court of
Maryland's three percent nominating requirement.
Against this array of authority, the sole

aberration

is Salara v. Tucker as construed by the lower court her® ami the
opinion of the lower court hsr©.

While w© have no quarrel -with

the result in Salara, as I hav© indicated earlier, we believe
that its reasoning as perceived by the lower court was clearly
wrong and inconsistent with the analytical framework previously
established by this Court.

Never before has a filing deadline

been stricken in isolation and standing by itself.
QUESTION;

Auerbach was written also by Judge Winter,

wasn't it?
MR. NILSON:

That is correct.

The lower court's

opinion —
QUESTION::
MR. NILSON;

So he was familiar with it?
He was indeed familiar with it.

H© was

not, of course, familiar with precisely, ©accept in harms of
reading the jurisdictional statement, with precisely what was
presented to this Court, and what the deliberations of this Court
involved in dealing with Auerbach.

But I think an examination

of the opinion, even though it may hav© been authored by Judge
Winter, of the opinion in Auerbach and the papers presented to
this Court reflect a clear presentation of the constitutional

18

issue to this Court Ik Auerbach.

And I think our view of that

is enhanced or supported by the citation of Auerbach as a case
on the merits upholding the three percent requirement, and such
a citation was mad© in Storer v. Brown, in the written opinion
of this Court in Storer.
Insofar as Salera was relevant to the lower court
her© and is relevant to this Court now, it should be viewed only
as standing for the proposition that the combination of a limited
three-week gathering period and a relatively early filing dead­
line pass too substantial a barrier to independent candidacies
and that this combination is not sufficiently supported by the
state interests which ware discussed in Salera which were more
limited than the ones presented here and discussed in this case.
Regardless of the alternative way in which one could
read the lov/er court’s opinion in Salera, the view just
described of the consequence of this Court’s summary affirmance
there is the only way to avoid a fundamental conflict between
the Salera case and this Court’s prior written opinions and
summary affirmancas.
This Court’s ©pinion in Fusari v, Steinberg, as well
as the Chief Justice's concurring opinion in that case, the
dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan in Colorado Spring
Amusements, and the dissenting opinions of Justices Brennan and
Marshall in Sidle v. Majors, clearly indicate that the lower
courts have an obligation to construe summary affirmances in a

19
way Ik which to the ext,safe possible they are consistent with one
another and not contrary to this Court’s prior written decisions.
Ofoat obligation was not fulfilled by the court below.
Viewed as a whole? the Maryland petition nominating
system is substantially more liberal than that of many states
and does not place insurmountable restrictions in the way of an
independent candidat©.

I summarized the features of our law at

the beginning of our argument.

It is summarized at pages 23 to

24 of our brief and I think does not merit further comment f
other than to again reemphasize that there is no limitation on
the gathering period and there are no significant disqualifica­
tions in terms of who may sign the petitions.
We also submit that when viewed in relative terms? the
record below indicates that there is no substantial imbalance
as to the route available in Maryland for independent candidates
and the route available to party primary candidates.
When we turn to actual experience in Maryland? as we
are told by this Court’s decisions we should, we find that inde­
pendent candidates have qualified for a place on the ballot with
sufficient regularity to indicate that the obstacles are not in­
surmountable. .
In 1974? the record demonstrates that eight, candidates
qualified for state legislative contests? and in 1976 two candi­
dates qualified for congressional contests by the March 8th
deadline? aid Mr. Bradley himself would have qualified but for

20

the invalidation.
Even if this Court should determine that the obstacles
imposed ar© substantial, either in absolute or relative terms,
and that th© actual experience is not sufficient to indicate
the feasibility of a reasonably diligent candidate’s qualifying,
th® statute must b© upheld if it is based upon compelling state
interests which cannot be served equally well in significantly
less burdensome ways.
There are significant and compelling state interests
at stake here and they go beyond, as I have, indicat®! above,
thoss discussed in Salsra.

Th® prevention of frivolous and

fraudulent independent candidacies maturing only after th© con­
clusion of th© primary ©lections has foaen recognised as a sub­
stantial interest, and I would submit it is further enhanced by
the filing deadline established under Maryland lav/.
Relate! interest is the elimination of voter confusion
caused by late blooming candidacies, a consideration which may
be ©specially important in a presidential year when political
activity is both more intense and more long lasting.
The need to insure that both party primary candidates
and independent candidates, including those who obtain general
election ballot access after all of th® validation and primary
election procedures ar© over, to insure that they ar© afforded
relatively comparable 'treatment and that, neither is given an
unfair advantage by establishing th® same filing deadline and

21
providing for a system when at about the time of the primary
election the voters and all candidates will know who is going
to b© ©a the general election ballot.

A system not requiring

the filings to take place until on or after the primary elec­
tion would leave up in the air the status of independent can­
didates in terms of their position on th® general election
ballot.
Th© fostering of public discussion of campaign issues
among all candidates when voter interest is at its peak during
the primary election, rather than allowing independent candi­
dacies to remain embryonic or dormant until the primaries have
s

ended,
Th© prevention or alleviation of administrative prob­
lems that might surface if the petition verification process

y

and likely challenges such as this one were telescoped into a
shorter and later period of time.
And finally, th® primotion of ail of these interests,
while still preserving the right of Maryland voters to express
themselves early in a presidential election year as to their
choice for presidential nominees.
Th© testimony of Professor Smolka, which is summarized
at pages 8 to 9 and 28 to 29 of our brief, indicate I believe an!
illustrate the fairness of the system and highlight the fact that
independent candidates are not treated unfairly relative to pri­
mary candidates.

22
With respect to the earliness of the deadline and the
contention that it hampers the independent candidate? X think it
is well known? of course? to take the presidential primary
elections as an example ? -that the presidential primary is held
in New Hampshire in February of the election year.

If the de­

cision below stands and if this kind of analysis stands? it is
entirely conceivable that the next time around in a presidential
©lection year someone will ba arguing that it is unconstitution­
al to provide such an early primary in New Hampshire? which in
fact even forces the candidates to ba actively campaigning in
the year prior to the ©lection.
I think right now Mr. Bradley has contended in his
brief and in argument below that it is unfair to make him start
before the period immediately preceding the primary on the
grounds that the primary election candidates ar© not required to
start so early but only have to begin during those last 70 days
before the primary.

That is not the way politics are run, that

is not the way elections ar© run.
In the State of Maryland now? we have almost on®
article a day on the gubernatorial candidates for the 1973
©lection? and we are in 1977 and early 1977.

Campaigns must

start early.
QUESTION?

Mr. Nilson? did I understand you to agree

as to what standard is applicable to this case?
MR. NILSONs

Well? I have gone through the standards.

23
I believe 'they are fairly clearly emerged from th® Court's
©pinions, and I believe that they were not properly applied by
th® lower court.
QUESTION?

I am not talking about were they applied.

Do you think: there is a compelling interest?
MR. WILSON?

That is only if you only reach the com­

pelling interest question, and you only look at this Court’s
opinions, identify in them what are compelling interests.

If

you find that the relative access routes for the independents
and the primary candidates are so disparate as to giv© a sever®
advantage to the primary candidate or that they impose such a
heavy burden —
QUESTION?

Well, you don’t reach that problem unless

you find a discrimination?
MR. NIL SO!-I:

That’s correct, or the excessively heavy

nature of the burden placed ©n independents.

And only when yo-

find thosea do you get to the compelling interests,
)

QUESTION?

Well, assume we did and then the question

might, become whether you could serve your ends by some other
less,burdensome way.

What is the state’s reason for having the

particular early filing date?
MR. NILSON:

it establishes a filing deadline — there

are a number of interests which I have outlined, but basically
it establishes a filing deadline which is the same for primary
candidates and independent candidates.

24
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON:

Well, what is so good about that?
it brings ail of the candidates out at

the same time so that everybody knows who his potential opposi­
tion is.

That’s true, but ~
And so th® fellow who is asked to circulate

ent kind of a campaign, isn't he?
MR. WILSON:

Well, he is in a different kind of campaign

with the same objective.

Butt what the law requiras is that he

do what he is required to do to establish the substantiality of
his support by the same filing deadline -as everyone else, and
that enables the state election officials to us® the next 35
days to validate those petitions and determine whether he will
truly be on the ballot, so that you then come down to the period
in time immediately prior to the primary ©lection when it is
basically known that you have a set of primary candidates for on©

If the independent candidates file on the

MR. NILSON2

That's correct.

But take the voters of a

major party who are trying to consider who they want their party
to nominate.

One vary important factor in their making that de­

cision at the primary election is who is the opposition going to
be, what kind of a chance in the general election is our party's
candidate going to have.

If there is a strong independent who

is going to be cm that general ©lection ballot, the presence of
that candidate can be a very important factor to voters who ar©
voting in the primary ©lection, because the primary voter in,
say, the Democratic or Republican Party may say, look, we know
that Candidate X is going to be on that ballot as an independent,,
he has a very strong appeal of this type, and that means that

Well, I don’t believe that is the only
I have also mentioned to the Court the

prevention of late-blooming or frivolous candidates.

We have

29
had situations in Maryland, for example, where a same name
candidata has developed, where other candidates have emerged
when they have been allowed to emerge lata in the process who
have a particular political appeal and can siphon off votes.
QUESTION;

So for that reason, Mr. Bradley can't go?

MR. NIL SON;

TIi® early deadline prevents that from

happening, and that is a legitimate interest of the state.

But yet it showed that the little time that

QUESTION;

Well, has the state made any move to change

it to comply with that?
MR. NXL SON;

There is pending before the General'

Assembly a bill now which would alter the present scheme.
is pending.

It has not bean enacted or acted upon.

It

That bill

would require a portion of the three percent signatures to be
filed on the present filing date with the r@maiss3.sr, I think it
is on® percent the first time and two percent the second time,
the remainder to be filed on the primary date in presidential
©lection years and thirty days after the original filing in
other ©lection years.

But I would strongly urge this Court

that there is nothing in this Court's written opinions that
establish that such a change is constitutionally necessary.

30

We have had candidates get on the ballot with sen®
regularity in the last two elections under th© present schema.
That demonstratas that it is a reasonable and possible and
feasible ballot access method.
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON:

For statewide office?
We have not had candidates other than Mr.

Bradley make a serious effort for statewide office as an inde­
pendent that I know of in th® two ©lections that I a», dealing
with.
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:

Your figures don’t help too much.
Pardon me?
Your figures on th© men running for Congress

and local candidates don't help too much.

MR. NILSON:
help.

Oh* I think th© local candidate figures

It is th© same three percent requirement * and I think

this Court made it very clear in storer, for example, that when
the higher up th© office is* it is a harder job and you have
got to expend more effort.

I think in Storer th© Court in­

dicated —

Th® man running for state legislature has

MR. NILSON:
QUESTION:
MR. NILSON;
QUESTION:

No* no, of his area.
Well —
He is running a lower level —
— it is a smaller number of votes.

31
MR. NILSON:

That's correct, but h@ is running a

different level of campaign.

This Court indicated in Storer

that for a presidential candidate in California, that it was
not unreasonable to require him to gather 14,000 signatures
a day.

And the Court essentially said when you are running for

a big office in a big area, you've got to have the campaign
organization that is going to b© necessary and it is going to
allow you to undertake that kind of an effort.
He was running for statewide office or for a state­
wide nomination or ballot position.

Mr. Bradley was running

for an important position here and I think he is required to
undertake a significant effort to amply with the law.

I

don't think the law imposes unreasonable requirements on him.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Nilson.

Mr. Brown.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JON T. BROWN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
.MR. BROWN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please "fell©

Court:
My name is Jon T. Brown, and I am representing the
appelles Bruca Bradley in this proceedings.

Just as a brief

preliminary matter, with respect to the jurisdictional state1
ment to which Mr. Nilson referred in the ease of Auerbach v.
Maude! and that reference to what was in the jurisdictional

statement, I think it might bs helpful for the record to point
cut that it was not indeed the state’s position that a con­
stitutional issue was raised in Auerbach v. Mandel.

Quite the

contrary, it was the state's position in their motion to
affirm that no constitutional issue was raised in Auerbach v.
Mandel.

They indicate quit© specifically in their motion to

affirm that the entire matter was decided as a matter of
statutory construction, and that of course is precisely what
Judge Winter determined initially in Auerbach v. Mandel and
determined one© again in the decision of the three-judge
district court in these proceedings.
With respect to the matter of the substantiality of
the burden and tha parity among the various candidates, both
independent and primary party candidates or principal party
candidates, I believe that there is another matter which has
pervaded these proceedings and that is the question of parity,
the question of whether or not ineed independent candidates
are treated the same in the State of Maryland as are partisan
party candidates.

And it is a matter which was raised before

the three-judge district court and is a matter which is raised,
which has been raised her© today.

And I think the conclusion

is inescapable, that there is no parity, there is no fairness
between the way tha parties, the various candidatas are
treated.
In affect, the independent candidate's primary

33
election ©ads 70 days prior to the partisan party candidate's
primary.
QUESTION;
MR. BROWNs
QUESTION:

He is a sure winner.
Beg pardon?
He is a sure winner, he is not in a pri­

mary contest then, it is not. a primary election, h© is on the
ballot.
MR, BROWNs

He is on the ballot providing that, b©

has been able to obtain the three percent which in 197 6 was
51,000 votes.
QUESTION:

Right, contrast with somebody who goes

into a primary ©lection, he is competing for votes against on©
or mare other people in the party primary, he might get 40
percent of the votes.
MR. BROWNs
QUESTIONS
MR. BROWN:

That's correct.
And still lose,
And hs is competing, I might suggest, in

a climate in which the political aspects of the campaign are
very much heightened, madia attention is heightened, and he is
competing in an arena which he has chosen to compete in.
QUESTION:

I thought that Jenness v. Portson, if it

stood for anything, stood for the proposition that the
Constitution does not require a state to treat candidates,
independent candidates and those who enter a primary election
the same.

34
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:

I think that's correct.
I thought it said that sometimes nothing

can be more unfair than treating things that are not the same
as though they ware the same.
MR. BROWN:

I think that is correct, Your Honor.

However, in this instance there is a question that goes far
beyond the question of parity among the candidates but rather
that in addition th© question of substantiality of the burden
upon the independent candidate, which goes precisely to that
synergistic effect between the amount of signatures which are
required 'to be obtained by the independent candidata and the
remoteness from both th® primary filing deadline and the
general election deadline which an independent candidate

•

must raach.
Contrary to th® situation in Jennass, th© situation
in the Stato of Maryland provides that, as was indicated' in the
record below, a primary filing deadline —* pardon me — an in­
dependent candidate filing deadline which is on March 8th
provides very, very substantial burdens for a party seeking
access to th® ballot by the independent•process route.

The

record is replete with uncantradicted testimony that th© in­
dependent candidate faced insurmountable difficulties at that
stage of the process in getting his name upon the ballot.
Under such a circumstance, this Court has held on
numerous occasions — Buckley v, Valeo, in Storor v* Brown —

35

that the exacting scrutiny test is that feast which must be
applied, and under those circumstances the exacting scrutiny
test being applied, if that is applied in these instances than
the question of compelling state interest becomes immediately
before the Court,
Compelling state interest here have been found by
the court below to b® insubstantial.

Those which have been

raised subsequent to the decision of the court below we have
treated with on brief.

And while they are indeed raised by
✓

the state as compelling state interests, there does not appear
V

to be anything in those which have been raised which are com­
pelling in the true sense of the word, that they could not be
dealt with in lass restrictive means which this Court has
mandated in Dunn v. Blumstein and similar cases.
For example, as this Court recognised

the plan which

m have submitted or which we have, suggested to the Court and
which was in effect adopted by the court below deals we believe
with all of the issues which,/the state has raised in raising
the issue of compelling state interests, and also provides
parity of access for independent candidates and removes the
substantiality of th® burdens which independent candidates
face, particularly in presidential election years,

it was

adopted essentially by simply providing that on th® filing date,
that mutual filing date which all the candidates have, which
in this instance was March 8th, that all of th© candidates
t

36
file their petitions and our suggestion was and as adopted by
the court that with a nominal but not insubstantial number of
petitions, petition signatures, and between the time of the
filing data and the primary date, that all of the party can­
didates and all the independent candidates engage in the same
kind of open discussion of the issues which the state has
suggested are necessary in order to provide each with access
to the ballot in a comparable fashion.
So that during that period when the media interest
is heightened, when weather conditions are far substantially
improved in most instances, whan the issues of the campaign
are beginning to crystallize, and whan, voter interest is
reaching its peak, that each of the candidates, both partisan
candidates and independent candidates, will have an oppor­
tunity of access to th® ballot.
We believe tills is a way or perhaps the best way in
this instance in which the Court can create — can alleviate
the substantial barriers which exist in th© State of Maryland
because of the remoteness of the filing deadline and still
maintain and protect "whatever compelling state interests truly
exist in these situations.
QUESTION:

You are not suggesting that a state has

an obligation to do it th© best way, are you?
MR. BROWN:

No, Your Honor, I'm not.

I'm suggesting

that in this instance the burdens placed upon independent

37
candidatas because of -fell© remoteness of the deadline as found
in Salara and as summarily affirmed by this Court were found
to be so substantial that they were found to be contrary to
the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

And I would not suggest

that —
QUESTION:

What part of the First and Fourteenth

Amendments?
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION:
Amendments?

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?
What part of the First and Fourteenth

Each one of those amendments contain a good many

subjects.
MR. BROWN:

Yes.

The First Amendment, Your Honor,

with respect primarily to the issue of freedom of -association,
tli© question of — and the right to vote as that is main­
tained and encompassed within freedom of association which is
guaranteed by. the First Amendment.
The Fourteenth Amendment, that of equal protection
which to some extent focuses more directly upon the candidate
rather than upon his supporters, but the right of equal pro­
tection of the laws, that he not be discriminated against as
far as access to the ballot is concerned.
QUESTION:

Vis-a-vis those, .who enter the party pri­

maries?
MR. BROWN:

vis-a-vis those who enter the party pri­

maries, yes, Your Honor

38

QUESTIONS

And the association or the First Amend­

ment *s associations! right is the right of his supporters to
effectively associate in order to try to elect him, is that
it?
MR.

brown?

Yes, Your Honor, effectively associate

at a time which is meaningful, at a time which they can bee one
aware of the fact that h© is a candidat©, that they can become
aware and participate in the process of getting additional
supporters to support -that candidate, at a time which does not
discriminate against their ability to permit him access to the
ballot just as a primary candidat® is not discriminated against
at

the time that the heavy media coverage is occurring during

a primary campaign.
With respect to the matter of Hicks v. Miranda, we
would strongly disagree with the state that the court below
misapplied Hicks v. Miranda.

Indeed, quite the contrary, w©

think that the court below has applied Hicks v. Miranda in
precisely the way which this Court has mandated in that de­
cision and in Tuliy.
QUESTION?

Well, whether the court did or didn’t;

give too much weight to the summary affirmance in the
Pennsylvania case is of little moment now that the case is
hare, this cas© is here, isn’t it?
MR. BROWN:
QUESTION?

That is correct, Your Honor, but —
It is her® to be decided on the merits'?

39
MR. BROWN2

Yes, it is, Your Honor, that is correct.

And wa would certainly concede that it is here to ba decided
on the merits, however, with respect —- if the Court has
concerns with respect to Hicks at this point,

we

would suggest

that the court below properly applied Hicks, and indeed that
as an adjunct to that proposition, the court below made th©
extensive findings of fact which were necessary in order to
determine that the burdensome nature of an independent candi­
date's race war® processed to the ballot in Maryland, and also
made without, it indicated, without extensive findings of fact,
mad© th© finding independent of Hicks, independent of Salera,
that those substantial burdens were sufficient in and of them­
selves to be violative of -the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
QUESTION:

In any event, the three-judge court in

this case held that the summary affirmance in the Salera case
was of controlling authority, and whether it was right or
wrong, it is now to ba decided here as an independent matter,
isn't it?
MR. BROWN:

yes, that is correct.

It is an independent matter, Your Honor,

However, there are conflicting state­

ments in the statement of th© court below.

At on© point it

indicates that legally they felt bound by Salera? at another
point it indicated that they had made an independent finding
independent of Salera.
But regardless of Hicks, as Your Honor has pointed

40

out, the case is here to be decided upon the merits and, as
a part of the consequence and as a part of those factual
matters which must fca taken into consideration are th© find­
ings we believe of th© court below with respect to the uncontradicted testimony of the individuals who participated in
the process of attempting to get Mr. Bradley on th® ballot.
And

as Mr. Hi Is on has indicated, those findings were us. con­

tradicted with respect to 'the burdens which were faced by th©
campaign organization at that time of remoteness from the
general ©lection deadline and the primary deadline.

And the

standing by themselves, th© court b©lcw has indicated, provide
th© substantiality of burden which then makes it incumbent
upon the state to determine whether or not it has a compelling
state interest and, of course, incumbent upon this Court to
determine whether that compelling state interest is sufficiant.
with respect to the question of whether or not as
on© of th© compelling stat© interests which were raised by the
court — by the stats, pardon me, was the matter of validation
and the matter that all primary candidates or all candidates
should be known at the same tin®.
The state statute, th® State of Maryland has a
statute which requires that that time be determined within 35
days.

However, the experience is quit® tin© contrary in par­

ticular instances.

In some instances, for example, in

Baltimore City, that determination of validation of signatures

41
can be made as rapidly as five days and was in fact mad© as
rapidly as five days.

And certainly when it comes to the

constitutional rights of an individual and of his supporters
for association, whatever burdam th© state may fac© with re­
spect to its administrative burdens for validating signatures
is no greater than whatever administrative burdens it may face
for counting ©lection ballots, certain ©lection ballots in a
contested ©lection.
In summary, w© would suggest that the court below
was absolutely correct in its finding of the substantiality of
the burden to the ballot faced by the independent candidat© in
Maryland, that the history of that balloting, of that polling
in the State of Maryland has determined precisely that it is
vary difficult indeed for a statewide candidat© to achieve
access to the ballot, and that in order for, if there ars com­
pelling state interests, in order for those compelling stat©
interests to be given whatever recognition,they must be given
in the least possible restrictive way.

And the plan which was

suggested by Mr. Bradley to fcha court below and which was
adopt©! by the court below is precisely that plan which best
©ffeats th© compelling state interests.
The test of experience is perhaps as important as
any.

Mr. Bradley was afforded access to the ballot.

He was

defeated in the general election, but nevertheless none of the
nine proffered -state compelling interests ware in any way

42

threatened or impinged upon by the process which was devised
by the court below and the process by which Mr. Bradley was
afforded access to the ballot and participated in the general
election process.
QUESTION:
MR. BROWN:

Are you suggesting that was a test?
I would not, Your Honor, suggest a test

of experience, .but we have in this case the unique opportunity
of hindsight to determine whether or not the compelling state
interests which are proffered by the state are indeed compell­
ing state interests, whether or not they are interests which
can be accommodated by less restrictiva means.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
gentlemen.

Very well.

Thank you,

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:42 o'clock p.m«, the cas© in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
