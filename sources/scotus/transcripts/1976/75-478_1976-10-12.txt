ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR» BECKER:

Thank you. Mr„ Chief Justice* and may \

it please the Court:
This case arises on a writ of certiorari to the Court

10

of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit.,

11

tion and validity of two parallel provisions of Federal law*

12

At issue are the interpreta­

The first is a guideline of the Equal Employment

13

Opportunities Commission which was promulgated in 196?«

14

is a 1972 amendment to Title VIX of the Civil Rights Act of

15

1964 which adds to that statute a definition of the term

16

"religion"

17

Second*

These provisions require the employer to accommodate

18

all aspects of the religious observance and practice of his

IS

employees* unless the employer can demonstrate that to do so

20

would work an undue hardship to the conduct of his business*

21

The facts of the case may be briefly summarizede

22

The Respondent* Paul Cummins* worked for a period of approximately

23

12 years at the Berea* Kentucky, plant of the Petitioner, Parker

24

Seal Company, and rose to the level of departmental supervisor*

25

In 197O, he joined the World Wide Church of God which

7

on each and every Saturday that his department was scheduled

to operate*

9

He;* thereupon* advised his immediate superior that
He

To the contrary* he was granted Saturdays
During that period of time* management

In or about August of 1971* when an increasing work­

10

load at the plant had given rise to difficulties with this

11

arrangement* Cummins was requested by his superior to undertake*

12

voluntarily* to approach his fellow supervisors and* on his own

13

initiative* to offer to relieve them during; their respective

14

overtime shifts during the middle of the week*

15

Cummins did not do this*

He was then requested to

16

reconsider his position with respect to Saturday work*

17

declined to do so and he was discharged*

18

Cummins instituted two proceedings»

He

First* under

19

Kentucky law* before the Commission on Human Rights^ that

20

Commission applied a State civil rights statute which followed

22

the Federal law in all pertinent respects* including the accom­

22

modation provision which is at issue here*

23

After a full-dress evidentiary hearing* the State

24

■ Commission determined that the employer* Parker Seal* had made

25

a reasonable attempt to accommodate Cummins and dismissed

p
I

Cummins * complaint
Cummins also instituted a Fed era 3. proceeding.

2

First,

3

by filing a complaint with the EEOC and then, upon receipt of

4

his statutory right to sue letter^ a Federal complaint was filed

5

in District Court of the Eastern District of Kentucky,
Cummins agreed that that Court could decide his claim

6

7

on the basis of the evidentiary record that had been compiled

8

before the State Commission,

9

again, held in favor of Parker Seal,

On that basis, the District Court,

The Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit reversed

10
11

that judgment.

It did so largely on the basis of its conclu­

12

sion that Parker Seal had failed to demonstrate why the accom­

13

modation which was supposedly reasonable for over a year had

14

suddenly become unreasonable.
We submit that this judgment was erroneous for three

15

16

reasons.

17

below, in effect, penalizes the company for having attempted

18

for over a year to work out an accommodation of Cummins,

19

the court below has flung that effort at accommodation in the

20

face of the company as an admission against the company's

21

interest,

22

The first reason is that the decision of the Court

QUESTION:

Mr, Becker, I take it there is no question

23

as to the employee's sincerity of his belief.

24

questioning this in any way?

25

MR, BECKER:

Indeec,

You are not

That's correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

\

6
1

No issue* as such* is presented on this record,

2

A second reason that the judgment below was erroneous,

3

we submit* is that it is flatly inconsistent with other decisior

4

both of the Sixth Circuit and of other courts of appeals which

5

indicate that the employer stands on firmer ground when he

6

shows he has made some attempt at accommodation* and then can

7

point to that effort in support of his position that the effort

8

is unsuccessful0

9

We believe that that line of decisions better com­

1©

ports with the statutory objective here which must be one of

II

voluntarism of efforts on the part of both employer and employee

12

to arrive at some mutually acceptable arrangement* given the

13

employee's views,
QUESTION:

14

When you say voluntarism* Mr. Becker*

15

there is really nothing voluntary about what the employer is

16

doing.

He is being required to do it by an act of Congress.
MR. BECKER:

17

I quite agree.

And I would say*

18

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc* that that is a point of great force for

19

us on both the statutory and constitutional planes in this

20

case..

21

Recognizing that* though* in addressing myself at

22

this juncture exclusively to the statutory argument* I would

23

say that if the thrust of Congress is to achieve an accommoda­

24

tion by the employer of the employee's religious needs* then

25

that overall objective — putting the establishment clause to

*3

7
1

one side — that overall objective is better satisfied if the

2

employer can make an attempt at accommodation without subjecting

3

himself to the risk of what happened in this case which was that

4

that attempt was then used against him when he got to court»
QUESTION:

5
6

In that connection* who has the burden of

proof to come up with alternative solutions?
MR. BECKER:

7

Under the regulation and under the

0

statute, both* the courts have held that the burden rests with

9

the employer to show the prima-facie issue of the reasonableness

10

of the accommodation or the undueness of the hardship.
We think we met that burden here and we think we

11
12

did so by demonstrating the unrealistic nature of the various

13

alternatives i»ihieh were proposed.
I might note* in passing* in response to your questior

14
15

Mr. Justice Blackmun* that none of the alternatives proposed

16

were advanced before the Kentucky Commission or* indeed* before

il

the District Court.

18

level.

19

They seem to have arisen at the appellate

it is suggested* for instance* below* that an

20

alternative arrangement might have been for Mr. Cummins to

21

work on Sundays.

22

rarely* if ever* operated on Sundays.

23

we submit* in having Mr. Cummins come in to supervise a depart­

24

ment where his men were not working.

25

We submit this was unrealistic.

The plant

There was no point*

Another suggestion which i*/as advanced by the Court of

j

8-9

Appeals and which, to our surprise, has been adopted by the
United States as amicus, is that Cummins 1 pay might have been
cut,

Novi, Commins was not an hourly employee.

required.

He was paid an

He was required to work whenever circumstances

The plant operated on what was known as a five-plus

day schedule, that is, it ran Mondays through Fridays on a
regular basis and then worked over on Saturdays when the work­
load required.
We fail to understand how cutting Mr, Cummins 8 pay
in response to his request to be relieved on Saturdays would,
on the Respondent's theory of this ease, any more pass statutory
muster than the discharge which actually resulted.
Now, the third point which I wish to make with
respect to the judgment of the District Court and why we submit
that that judgment was erroneous is this?

We think that the

overall approach of the Court of Appeals was erroneous.
assumed that the initial arrangement was satisfactory.

It
On the

record, that was not so.
It is clear that other supervisors were forced to
work overtime on account of Cummins 8 religion.
no extra compensation for their efforts.

They received

Moreover, to the

extent that supervisory personnel were forced to split their
time on Saturday mornings, as between the department from which
Cummins was absent and the departments which his fellow supervi sors were .required to operate, there was a necessary doubling

10

up.
The plant manager testified at the hearing that that
was absolutely not a satisfactory operating procedure.
QUESTION:

Don't you think this Court would be apt

to take the judgment of the Court of Appeals on a kind of a
ad hoe factual basis in an individual case where the test is
reasonably accommodate, rather than second-guess the Court of
Appeals on the facts of the case?
MR. BECKER;

Well* I would assume, Mr. Justice

Relinquish that this Court would not wish to be put in the
position of second-guessing facts.
The difficulty we have here is the Court of Appeals,
itself, has put itself in the posture of second-guessing facts.
And we have a question in the on-going administration of the
Act as to the manner in which the Court of Appeals should
subject to review the judgment of the District Court.
We agree that the test under the statute is one of
reasonableness.

In essence, the question is whether the

employer has acted reasonably under all the circumstances.
And, so far as the statute is concerned, putting aside the
constitutional question, that is a factual issue which we agi.ee
must be decided on a case by case basis.
The problem here is twofold.

First, the Court of

Appeals has injected an undue improper consideration into the
case..

It has escalated one element of the case to a dispositive

11

level*

And that element is the fact that this employer made

an attempt to accommodate and decided after a year that it
didn't work.
Now that* we think, presents a question of law which
is appropriately submitted to this Court for its review»
The second problem we have with the manner in which
the Court of Appeals disposed of this case is that the Court
of Appeals itself put itself in the position of reviewing t\e
record de novo«
Despite the protestations of the majority opinion., we
submit that the court below essentially retried the case.

And

we think that is an improper ^'^ay for Courts of Appeals to
proceed in cases of this sort,
QUESTION:

It was submitted on a written record,

though, to the District Court, wasn't it?
MR, BECKER:

That's correct»

The District Court had

before it the evidentiary-record that was compiled before the
Kentucky Commission,

And the District Court also had before it

Cummins' agreement that the case could be disposed of on that
rec ord »
QUESTION:

But you don't have, in this case, then,

any question of the Federal District Judge's evaluation of
credibility of oral testimony,
MR, BECKER:

I agree, !4r. Justice Rehnquist, the

District Court did not have the demeanor of the witnesses before

12

:tt8

It did have the record that was compiled before the

Kentucky Commission which consisted of a panel of several
members who did have the benefit of such demeanor and who did
observe the witnesses as

they

appeared before that Commission,:.

Now, in explaining why we think the decision below
is incorrect, I wish to revert one last time to the point that
we think the Court of Appeals has improperly elevated :one factor
which is the effort of this employer to accommodate.
We think the Court of Appeals erroneously concluded
that that effort at accommodation was reasonable at the outset.
We think it was an extension of activity on the part of the
employer that went far beyond a satisfactory arrangement, so
far as that employer was concerned.
Moreover, we think the Court of Appeals erred when it
concluded that Farker Seal failed to show why that arrangement
\

suddenly became unreasonable.

We think the reason it became

unreasonable is perfectly clear on this record.
As I indicated, at the outset., the problem was that
Cummins was failing on his own initiative to volunteer to assist
his fellow supervisors.

The fact is that at the outset of this

arrangement in July of 1970 Cummins expressed great willingness
to be cooperative and assist wherever assistance was asked for.
But his attitude changed and by the time he was discharged it
is clear from the testimony of his fellow supervisors and of
his plant managers that he had not fulfilled his share of the

13

bargain,,
We think it merits emphasis in this case that this is
not a case of discrimination,.

Indeed. there was never any sug­

gestion at any level of these proceedings that this company had
intentionally discriminated against Cummins because of his
religion»
The facts of the case belie any such suggestion»

The

accommodation which was extended Cummins for over a year shows
that this company bent over backwards to avoid discriminating
against him because of his religion»
The question here is very different.

It is, on the

statutory levels whether a company has satisfactorily performed
a very different obligation which is to accommodate an employee
on account of his religious needs.
Now* in underscoring the difference* I wish to point
*

out that it is virtually conceded here by parties that if this
case did arise under the basic anti-discrimination provision
of Title VII* Parker Seal would be home free.
I think It is abundantly clear* for example, that
this company complied with the requirements which were laid down
in the Griggs decision.

If I may quote for Just a moment from

that opinion* the court there said that "discriminatory prefer­
ence for any group* minority or majority* Is precisely and only
what Congress has proscribed0"
Now, the impact of this particular statutory provision

14

is to require a preference which I submit worked a discriminator/
effect, not against Cummins who benefited from the arrangement
for over a year, but against the fellow supervisors who were
required to come in and substitute for Cummins on each and every

Saturday that his department was operating<,
QUESTION:

Is this a statutory argument you are making

or a constitutional argument?
MR0 BECKER:

This is part of my statutory argument,

Mr» Justice Rehnquist, and I am stressing the difference between
the basic anti-discrimination provision of Title VII with which
this Court has previously dealt, and the very different accom­
modation provision which the definitional section added in 1972
and the EEOC guideline required„
QUESTION:

But just because they are different,

doesn't that suggest that there is going to be an element of
discrimination against the people who observe the Sabbath on
Sunday, and that type of thing, people who practice the religion
of the majority?
MR. BECKER:

That's a point which I will address and

develop on my constitutional argument.

Yon are, of course,

absolutely right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Then, it doesn't seem to me it helps your

statutory argument very much.
■MRo BECKER:

I am merely explaining — all I intend

to do by this argument, at this level, is to explain the

15

difference which we see between a discrimination case and a case
arising under this statute,

I am pointing to the fact that had

this case arisen under the basic provision of Title VII, this
employer would surely have been free of liability.

And I am

merely explaining the added burden which this statute imposes
on the employer,
met.

A burden which, I hasten to add, I think we

And we met it by relieving this fellow of his obligations

for over a year.
Now, in that regard, we have developed in our main
brief a list of the factors which we think will be pertinent
on the statutory level In assessing the reasonableness of an
employer's efforts to accommodate on a case by case basis.
We think this case is an appropriate vehicle for the
Court to consider some of those factors anc perhaps to advise
the lower court, whose opinions are in some disarray, on this
subject,what factors may and may not properljr be considered.
One factor, as I previously Indicated, which we think
should not be accorded dispositive significance Is the sugges­
tion that because the employer has made an effort at accommoda­
ting the employee he is somehow subject to a heightened obliga­
tion to explain why the accommodation Is no longer possible.
Let rae turn now, if I may, to the constitutional side
of our case.
In the event that the statutory question is resolved
adversely to us, we challenge the Federal constitutionality of

16

both the guideline ancl the statutory amendment»

We say that

those provisions, in tandem, violate the Establishment Clause
of the First Amendment,
Now, the Court is fully familiar with the three-part
test or guideline which has developed in the context of the
various school aid cases which have been before it over the
years ,
Those principles are discussed in full in our briefs
and 1 shall not belabor them here»
1 wish to make only the following few points:
First, this statute undoubtedly,indisputably aids
religion.

That is its whole point and purpose,
Senator Randolph said so when he introduced it on the

floor of the Senate,
The language of the statute and the guideline, itself,
make it clear that that is all the statue and guideline are
concerned with,
QUESTION:

Isn't 4(b) concerned with aiding the free

exercise —
MR* BECKER:

It is an attempt by Congress to force

the employer to make accommodations or to permit the employee tc
engage in one kind of activity which is religious activity.

I

do not, in any sense, Mr, Chief Justice, denigrate the motives
of Congress in passing this statute.
instinct was highest purity.

It is clear that its

The objective was to assist in the

17

ability of certain employees to enjoy their religious activities»
Nox<r* 1 note that immediately a question is presented
under the Establishment Clause because of the narrow focus of
this statute.

It is devoted solely to the assistance of

religionists.

Moreover* we submit that the statute is devoted

solely to the assistance of certain religionists,namely*, those
who wish to observe their Sabbath on a Saturday,

That was the

precise purpose for xxfhieh Senator Randolph said he was intro­
ducing this legislation,
QUESTION:

The statutory language is certainly

broader than that* and supposing you get somebody who doesn't
want to eat meat on Friday,

He will have some sort of an

argument that maybe fish ought to be served in the cafeteria on
Friday* won’t he?
MR, BECKER:
That % quite right.

That's correct* under the statute.
The statute reaches all aspects of

observance and practice of religion.

But I note that the

guideline*which antedated the statute* is called* "Observance
of Sabbath and Other Religious Holidays,"
The introductory section of that guideline says that
several complaints filed with the Commission have raised the
question concerning employees who regularly observe Friday
evening and Saturday* or some other day of the week* as the
sabbath.
The guideline was directed to the problem of the

13

Saturday observing religionist.

And that means it was directed

to one particular sub-group of religaous practic loners.
We submit that that further points to the constitutional
Impropriety of this legislation.
X want to stress the difference between this case and
the Sherbert y* Verner decision of this Court.

That was the

case in which the Court dealt with the Seventh Day Adventist
-who was apprised of Unemployment Compensation benefits under a
South Carolina statutory scheme which denied benefits to those
who are unavailable for work.
Now, the. argument that has been developed on the
other side in this case is that as part of a statutory scheme
that deals with discrimination, Title VXX, Congress could pick
up the notion of discrimination that was developed in Sherbert
and simply apply that

passu to private people.

We think that argument is -wrong.
The first point is that Sherbert was not a case of
discrimination.

The appellant in that case presented a claim

of denial of equal protection which was rot passed upon.

What

was presented there was the problem arising from the State's
even-handed application of a facially neutral Unemployment
Compensation scheme which resulted in Governmental pressure
on the appellant because of her religion.

And that introduced

an improper infringement on her free exercise.
Thatg I submit, is very different itself from a

19

discrimlnation caseo
Now* there is another point on which the Sherbert
precedent is different»

In that case* the Court noted that a

. separate State statute expressly saved out the Sunday worshiper»
The State laws then laid together clearly separated the Saturday
from the Sunday observing worshiper.
That is not true here.

Parker Seal* on rare occasions*

operated its plant on Sunday and one of the witnesses at the
hearing* Webb* testified that as a supervisor he x*»as* on
occasion, required to come in on Sundays* even though to do so
violated his religion»
It is clear* then* that this company did not dis­
criminate between Saturday and Sundary observers as did the
South Carolina statutory scheme considered as a whole in
Sherbert.
Now* both the Sherbert precedent and the other
precedents which were relied upon by the Respondent* go to the
notion that where the Government Infringes or is about to
infringe on the free exercise rights of citizens* then relief
may* and in some cases* must be in order* even though the
result might abstractly be deemed to give rise to some
establishment question.
To rephrase the proposition* an Establishment Clause
objection will be overridden where* in order to satisfy it*
the Government would be required to infringe upon the free

20

exercise rights of the affected persons*
This Court's decision in the Yoder case, the Amish
school children case, is a conspicuous example of — or a
conspicuous illustration of that proposition*
This is not that case*

This is a case in which the

Government is saying to one private person,. "You have got to
change the vsaj you do business, " in order that another private
person may enjoy his religious rights*
Now, once again, the purpose may be thoroughly under­
standable*

But the problem is that it amounts to something

which goes to the core on the Establishment Clause*
It is Governmental pressure, coercion, being leveled
against one person on account -of another person's religion*
QUESTION;

What do you do with cases like McGowan

v* Maryland «— uphold Sunday closing laws?
MR» BECKER;
difficulties»

Well, those cases present their own

Candidly,- I am not sure that they can be easily

reconciled with the Yoder decision, but they certainly rested,
themselves, on the proposition that an overriding non-sectarian,
secular purpose had no debate at the State legislatures*
The interest in engendering a uniform day of rest
and, the Court said, although those statutes may once have had
their origins in religious notions those religious notions had
eviscerated and there was now a secular purpose which overrode the objection of the Orthodox Jew who was forced to choose

21

between his religion and his livelihood*
That's not this case,,
purpose to this statute.

There is no nonsectarian

The statute* on its face* is directed

to the protection and enhancement of certain religious groups,
And* Indeed* the language of Senator Randolph makes
it clear that he was sponsoring it because Saturday observing
groups* of -which he was a member* were having difficulty in
keeping up their congregations because some of the members had
to work on Saturdays,
QUESTION:

But* Senator Randolph's comment* I don't

think* can be attributed to all the other ninety-nine Senators
and however many members of Congress it is who voted on the
thing *
MR* BECKER:

It certainly can't be imputed to them

all* Mr* Justice Rehnquist.

However* it makes up virtually all

of the legislative history on this statute*
Now* the Court has indicated that one branch of the
three-part test under the Establishment Clause will be to
consider the purpose of the Legislature in enacting the
challenged statute.
It seems to me that it is appropriate, assuming that
the purpose branch is different from the primary effect branch*
to look at what the Legislature said when it enacted the
statute,
QUESTION:

What the Legislature said is contained in

22

the law that it passed, sometimes in the Committee reportsa

It

certainly isn't contained in the comments of one member of the
Legislature®
MR® BECKER:

I agree with that completely, of course®

But If we look to the words of both the guideline and the
statute, there, again, the problem is presented®

The primary

effect of this statutory scheme is to enhance religious
activity®

That is its whole point and purpose®

And if we

divine the purpose of the Legislature from the necessary effect
of the statutory words, we reach the same result®
I reserve the balance®
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr® Becker.

Mr® Hogan®
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L® HOGAN, ESQ®,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HOGAN:

Mr® Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I8d like to begin by clarifying one factual error,
I think, that has been made®

And this is the question of

whether or not the company did, in fact, accommodate Mr® Cummins
for a year®
On page 173 of the record, when the question was
directed to Mr. Haddock, who was the plant manager, and he
was asked, "When did you become aware of Paul's religion?’5
his answer was, "Not until the summer of 1971 when we were

And

23

having our vacation period,"
Later on, on page 178* the answer to a question was;
"I asked him, I think it was two weeks before he left, I asked
him if there was any

I knew he had adopted this religion a

year and a half — and L asked him if there; was any possibility
of his being able to change his ideas or anything like that and
he told me that he was firmly fixed with his religion,
"Is that when you decided to fire him?
• -

"It was after that,"
So the company did not accommodate Mr, Cummins for a

year.

The fact of the matter is, Mr* Haddock, the plant

manager, was there for a year before he was even aware of the
fact that Mr, Cummins was not coming in to work.
Mr, Cummins, of course, had been told by previous
supervisors that as long as it did not pose any problems he
would not have to come in and work on the shift on Saturday.
This was based on the past practice of the company, that the
particular department that Mr. Cummins worked in, the Banbury
Department, historically operated second shifts and they never
did have a supervisor.
I think the record amply shows that most of Mr. Cummins
work involved scheduling production and physical presence wasn’t
always necessary because the company had determined that due to
the financial situation they never did have a supervisor on the
second shift

And, over the years, the fact that when they did

24

■i

have one because production was low —- and any problems* any
deficiencies in production started back in 1968 and actually
reached their peak in 1970 and were totally unrelated to any
problems or any difficulties that came about because of
Mr* Cummins 5 adoption of his religionI think* secondly* more importantly* is the question
of what Congress intended by the enactment of this Amendment
and that was to put a burden on the company to attempt to
reasonably accommodate the religious needs of the employee*
I do not accept counsels argument that under —
without this Amendment* Mr* Cummins would not have been protected*
1 think the argument can be made that under the Griggs doctrine*
as applied to religions cases* that this is a policy* a Saturday
work policy that as applied to everyone uniformly does have a
disparate effect on Sabbatarians* since* historically* this
company* as does most of our society, schedules any additional
work on the Saturdays rather than the Sundays*

And* In this

particular instance* in fact* it is even reflected In the
contract* since the company has to pay time and a half for
Saturday work and double time on Sunday*

3o* obviously* Sunday

s

work is only achieved as a last resort*
QUESTION:

That is uniformly true everywhere* fchase

rates of one and a half ar:d double,
MR* HOGAN:

Bivfc* in this particular factual situation*

I say it is uniformly chat most businesses operate on Saturday

25

versus Sunday, if they've got the choice between the two.
QUESTION:

Well, this Is a society in which that's

been the overwhelming tradition for more tiian three hundred
years# has it not?
MR. HOGAN:

Yes# Mr. Chief Justice»

And I think

that's why Congress passed this statute,to protect the minority
Sabbatarians of this country because of the fact that without
this amendment# or without the application of Griggs, to the
original Title VII presciption, there really is no benefit to
Sabbatarians or to people who practice a religion that is not
of the majority.
QUESTION:

Must the employer accommodate every

religion, every religionist# including those who have Monday,
Tuesday# Wednesday or Thursday as their daj?
MR, HOGAN:

Well# I think the important thing is,

and the amendment# of course# does not apply just to Sabbath
worship.

It applies to other instances# also# of particular

needs of religions.
I think that°s why what Congress has created Is a
balancing factor.

In fact# I think they have, in effect,

weakened the Griggs doctrine of a business necessity doctrine
of saying now there is a lesser standard# that all an employer
has to show is that it causes an undue hardship that is directly
related to the fact that they are trying to accommodate
reasonably the religious needs of their employee.

26

I think it boils down to, foasica!3.y, that each case has
to be looked at in its own particular fact situation.

I don't

think that this Court could write a broad, general policy that
a particular thing for a company to do will always be sufficient*
It would depend on what the total work force is.
on what type of industry it is.

In the Albuquerque

case where it involved the firemen it was impossible to do so.

If there

small operation — but I think these are the issues that are
going to have to be determined by the EEOC or by District
Courts„
The main thing that the Court of Appeals did in this
instance, and the important thing, I think,

is that the

Commission on Human Rights, who is 'the actual trier of facts,
misapplied the law because they reasoned that as long as this
policy was applied uniformly that it was, therefore, legal and
that the company was able to do that.
The only problems and the only undue hardship that
is reflected in the record and that was testified to is the
fact that there was consternation among the other employees,
which I think is probably going to foe true in most instances.

27

particularly here where the company did nothing to try to
eliminate that problem*

The fact is that other employees were

working more hours than Mr, Cummins,

Mr, Cummins was making as

much money as the other supervisors and in some instances more
money than some of the supervisors*

However, the company seems

to say that Mr* Cummins didn't volunteer to do anything.
Well* the obvious answer is-the other employees didn't volunteer
to work 72 hours.

The company opened then to work 72 hours.

Mr, Cummins went to the company at the very beginning
and said*

"I'll do what's ever necessaryTell me what to do,"

They asked 'him to volunteer* so he did on instances.
•A

Now the question is all the company —
QUESTION:

Isn't there testimony that he did not

live up to his promise?
t

MR, HOGAN: Weil* the question was — he volunteered
on numerous instances.

The question has arisen now,and I think
V
it has mainly arisen in the briefs of the petitioner, is that
at one point he stopped volunteering.

And I don't think the

record does reflect that.
Counsel stated that Mr. Cummins volunteered In 1970.?
but he did not volunteer in 1971, and on page 153 of the record
the question was:

"Did Paul ever volunteer to work for you at

any other days besides Saturday?"
And the answer, from Mr. Fain:

"Well, now when we

were in vacation schedule he came over and said,

'I'll help you

28

out when yon need me,,®"
Well* vacation schedule was the summer of 1971«

The

obvious problem Mr» Cummins had is where he had three other
supervisors and the company gave him no direction*
him to prepare his own work schedule*
because of his beliefs»

They expected

They singled him out

They didn't require the other super­

visors to prepare their work schedules,
QUESTION:

Didn't they also single out the others

because of their beliefs in telling them they had to work
overtime?

,
MR» HOGAN:

Yes* sir»

And, of course, they separated

Paul from the group of the other three»
QUESTION:
MR» HOGAN:
QUESTION:
the church*

The obvious solu —

Who separated them?
The company did.
I thought he did»

The company didn't join

He joined the church»

MR» HOGAN:

No, but — what I am saying — when it

came to scheduling hours* they scheduled them for 72»
plant manager even testified:

And the

"Yes. we could have scheduled

Paul to work four hours in the afternoon, to work twelve-hour
shifts during the week to take away from the other supervisors»"
But he didn't schedule him to do that because the
plant manager felt that the way to solve the problem was for
Paul to be a volunteer, for him to go over and offer.

And the

other supervisors were in the same position and they testified

29

that they didn't think it was their position to have to go over
to another supervisor»

They were all looking to the company for

some direction»
The company simply had to sit down all four super­
visors and say* "Mr0 pummins will not work on his Sabbath*
because we are obligated under the lav» to accommodate him,,
therefore*, let's prepare a schedule to equalize as much as
possible»"

,
QUESTION:

I thought the Court of Appeals said that

he did try »«• and as a matter of fact he did for a year, the
4

employer, to accommodate»
MR» HOGAN:

Well, this is the argument what the

employer did if the supervisors -~
QUESTION:

No, no, no»

Didn't the Court of Appeals

say that?
MRe HOGAN:

That he was allowed off on Saturdays,

yes»
QUESTION:

Didn't the Court of Appeals say that the

company tried to accommodate themselves to this problem for a
year?
MR * HOGAN:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir»

Hevas allowed off»

Well, you are saying that they didn't»

You don't want to disagree with the Court of Appeals, do you?
MR» HOGAN:

No,

Certainly not»

But, what I am saying as far as now that the company

30

Is saying that this accommodation caused problems, it is
difficult to believe that it would have caused problems if the
supervisor who was running the plant wasn't even aware of the
accommodation.
So, there is testimony In the record “•»
QUESTION:

I think you want us to say that he never

accommodated — the company never did, never tried.
MR. HOGAN:

What I am saying is any accommodation

the fact that Mr. Cummins was not there on Saturday had
absolutely no effect on the business operation of this company,
that It caused no undue hardship.

The only undue hardship in

the record at all is the fact that it caused dissension among
some of the employees.
And I think that under the statute, that the obligation
on the company is to deal with the dissension and not, as they
did here ask Mr» Cummins to change his religion.
QUESTION:

How can you separate the dissension and

the morale problem of the employees, from the accommodation
process?
MRo HOGAN:

Well, because one of the problems you

had with morale was one of the supervisors had formerly been an
hourly employee, he was then promoted to supervision and then
told to work 72 hours a week.

And his objection was not to the

fact of what Mr, Cummins was doing, his objection was that he
was no longer being paid overtime.

31

We had a situation here

and I think this is very

important* too — that was a temporary situation»

There was a

strike at the other plant t^hich caused increased production.,
Obviously* the company testified they only worked Saturday
when they have to»

You had a vacation situation which required

the other employees to work additional hours»
X think it is only natural that if one employee is
working 72 hours and the other one is working 40 and making the
same amount of money* that the one who is working 72 is going tc
have a little bit of dissension»
QUESTION:

What you are saying suggests that this

gentleman expected the whole stablishment to revolve around him*
to accommodate him* that other employees would have to be
imposed upon* one way or another* in order to grant him total
freedom from Saturday work»

And you say that an employer must

simply continue to tolerate that?
MR» HOGAN:
factor»

Well* that's what I say»

\
It's a balancing

You can't just — you know* there are extremes as to

what an employee

you know* if an employee said*

"My religion

says X have to have a three-hour lunch period*" then an
employer can say* you know* "We can't do that»"
Here* Mr. Cummins just said he could not work from
his Friday sundown to Saturday sundown* but he would do what­
ever was necessary to make up the additional hours to equalize
it»

And then the company could have come forthwith and said*

32

"All right, this is the reasonable accommodation we are
offering you»"
And, of course, then, if he rejected that then
perhaps they would have had a legitimate reason for firing»
What they did, they went back to him and they told him,

"You work

something out»"
I don't think that's what Congress intended*
accommodation is on the employer*

The

It is not on the employee»

That's where the burden has been put»

The company keeps trying

to say that this is an equal type of partnership.

It only is

once the company comes forth, then the burden shifts back to
the employee to either accept or reject whatever the accommoda­
tion is»
Then, of course, it all has to be viewed in light of
the reasonableness and the fact of what undue hardship it will
have on the company»
QUESTION:

Is that what will bring you up to the

constitutional problem?
MR» HOGAN:

Yes, Mr» Chief Justice,

Since I have

yielded ten minutes of my time to the United States, I would
just like to touch very briefly on the constitutional issue
and let him devote the majority of his time —
And the one important- point that I would like to make
is that it would seem to me that the company is arguing both
sides, that I don't think you can argue that the accommodation

33

statute is unconstitutional

and at the same time say that the

basic prohibition of discrimination against religion is
constitutional *
I base that on the argument that I think that a
proper interpretation of Griggs

and the disparate effect

eases compel a finding that a reasonable accommodation would
have had to have been made*
If a person is in a particular position because of
their religion* then I think under Griggs * and assuming that
position has no basis to their qualifications to perform the
job or to the job requirements* then Griggs would dictate that
their religion would have to be accommodated to some extent,
And with that* I will yield to the United States»
Thank you»
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, Hogan,

Mr, Wallace,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE* ESQ,*
AS AMICUS CURIAE* SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MB* WALLACE:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court: _•
The United States does not agree with the Petitioner
that the duty to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious
practices*so long as it doesn't cause an undue hardship on the
operation of the business* is really a totally separate duty
from the basic obligation under Title VII of the Civil Rights

3

Law to avoid discrimination on the basis of religion.

^-

Indeed,

the reasonable accommodation requirement was first adopted by
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 196?* as an
interpretation of the basic obligation five years before
Congress amended the statute to indicate its agreement with the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on this subject.
Under this Court»s decision in Griggs, the basic
prohibition is directed not merely to thd motivation of
employment discrimination, but to the consequences of practices
on persons because of their race, religion* etcetera, regardless
of how urell motivated* and even«handedly applied the particular
employment practices might be,
QUESTION:

Griggs was dealing with employment tests*

wasn8t it?
MR, WALLACE:

It was dealing with employment tests

that had a disparate impact* in that case, on the basis of race*
and the question was whether the tests were sufficiently related
to the business needs of the employer to be a fair measure of
employment opportunities or whether the disparate consequences
were a violation of the basic prohibition,

Similarly* a facially

neutral, across-the-board rule that when called upon to do so
every employee must work on Saturday, has a grossly disparate
impact on certain employees because of their religion,
A similar approach should be taken, under the Griggs
tesu, itself, whether there are sufficient

reasons related to

35

bhs business needs of the employer to require an employee to be
put into the position of having to choose between the dictates
of his religion or possibly forfeiting his livelihood,,
QUESTION:

Well* your case would be more difficult*

wouldn't it* Mr0 Wallace, if you didn't have the '72 amendment?
Aren't you better off to argue on the statute based on the '72
amendment rather than trying to argue something that doesn't
help —
MK® WALLACE:

Well, our point is that the '72

amendment really represents a reasonable legislative solution
to the question of:

How.do you determine when- a practice has

the forbidden consequence of an employment practice that
discriminates on the basis of religion?

It's not simply a

motivational question®
And Congress recognized that in adopting the 1972
amendment in light of EEOC's experience in trying to make that
determination in these cases where persons complained that
they were being forced to the choice between the dictates of
their conscience and the employer's demands that they observe
a facially neutral employment requirement®
So, it is an outgrowth and a reasonable legislative
drawing of the line to determine when an employment practice
is justified in terms of the needs of the business, or when it
has the forbidden consequence because of its disparate impact
on the persons —-

36

QUESTION;

What's your idea of whose burden this

accommodating business is?

Don't you. think an employer — the

man has been working for years on Saturday, then he comes in and
says«. "I'm sorry, I've joined the church arid I can't work on
Saturday any more,"

Now, does he have some job, some respon­

sibility of suggesting how this can be done?

MRo WALLACE;

Well, he is not managing the plant»

If you say «■•»»
QUESTION:

But he's the one who joined the church»

MR» WALLACE;
QUESTION;

That is correct, but —

He brought the issue up»

MRe WALLACE;

to make a reasonable accommodation to the religious practices

QUESTION:

So the burden is on the employer.

MR. WALLACE: — of the employees,,

And, quite properly so, because it is manage­

ment that makes the decision as to how working hours can be

employees or how they cannot be0
And that. is the approach

That is not what the statute requires

It could be the result that the employer

could accept In a particular case, but the statute does not —
QUESTION:

What else could the employer do?

MR, WALLACE:
QUESTION:

Well, in this case,

In my case, what else could the employer

do?
MR, WALLACE:

If there was no possibility of sub­

stituting additional longer working hours because of the nature
of the business, on other days, then, the only other possibility
would be to negotiate an appropriate reduction in salary, based
on the reduced work hours of the particular employee.
The circumstances of the case will dictate what can
be a reasonable accommodation, and there cam be several
possibilities for reasonable accommodation.-,
As I read the record in this case, I think the
company did, to the extent it was aware of the problem, make a
reasonable accommodation for the initial period in which the
Respondent here started to observe Saturday as his Sabbath,
It was only during the summer of 1971 when the
increased workload came along due to a strike in the Lexington

38

plant and vacation schedules in the plant that the company
really didn't fulfill its obligation by making further adjust­
ments to utilize the Respondent and have him carry his full
share of the extra workload, along with the other supervisors»
As Mr* Hogan said, the other supervisors were assigned
the duties that they had and were told when they would have to
work on Saturday to cover for Mr» Cummins, etcetera»

Yet the

company refused to assign Mr* Cummins to extra work during the
week to cover for the other employees, where it could very well
have equalized the assignments out by giving Mr* Cummins extra
hours during the week and if those extra hours x«jere on the
second shift, then have the second shift supervisor sometimes
relieve the first shift supervisor*

So that all of them could

have had some relief*
QUESTION;

It is a great deal easier, Mr* Wallace, to

say that in an appellate argument than it is to adjust the
functioning of a plant and the work on a floor with numerous
employees*

It isn't all that easy, the way you describe it*
MR* WALLACE;

There could have been difficulty

existing there but if there

were it was up to the company to

bring them to the attention

of the finders of fact in the case,

and it did not do so*

appears on the record is that

What

was common practice in that

it

companyfor the Banbury Department,

of which Mr* Cummins was the supervisor, to operate without a
supervisor of its own,, to have that job covered by others and

39

that it was common practice for supervisors to substitute for
each other* on occasion,
QUESTION:

What did the District Court find in this

case?
MRo WALLACE;
findings of fact*

Well, the District Court made no

The case was submitted to the District Court

on the record that had been developed before the State
Commission, and the District Court read a very short opinion
which merely says that on that record it found that the company
had made a reasonable accommodation and no more should be
required of itc
And so, the Court of Appeals, quite properly, had to
look to the underlying facts to determine whether applying
proper legal standards to those undisputed facts, that result
was correct or not, and reached the conclusion that the District
Court erred in that regard»
The only findings that we have are reflected in the
Court of Appeals opinion»

But nothing was brought out in the

hearing as to any reasons why the company could not have made
assignments of that sort.
In the limited time remaining, I'd like to say a few
words about the constitutionality of the 1972 Amendment to
Title VII.
There is no general principle under this Court's
decisions that it is necessarily a violation of the Establishment

40

Clause for one person to be required to adjust his conduct in
some way because of the religious practices or observances of
another #
In fact, this Court's decisions hold precisely
the opposite, that it is appropriate as an exercise of legisla­
tive power in particular circumstances to require individuals
to adjust their conduct in a way that will further in a neutral
way the free exercise of religion and avoid unnecessary clashes
with religious conscience.
One example of that, a rather simple one, is
Gallieher v. Crown Kosher Markets, one of the Sunday closing
law cases in which eight justices upheld against an Establish­
ment Clause attack the constitutionality of provisions of that
particular Sunday closing law which forbad the carrying on of
certain activities within a prescribed distance of the place
of worship on Sunday,

This affected where people could parade.

It affected where people could conduct athletic events, all
in deferance to furthering the free exercise of religious
observances at the churches that were being protected,
This Court held that this does not force anyone else
to attend those services, to adopt any kind of religious
beliefs or practice and that it was a permissible exercise of
State power to reach other persons in this way in order to
protect the free exercise of reli-gion,
Another example of that which we develop in our brief

41

at some length* is Zorak vtt Clausen* in which those school
children who did not choose to attend the religious instruction
given outside of the schoolroom were kept in school* the
regular attendance* even though the State forbad continued
Instruction during that period which would cause educational
problems and cause those who stayed behind to forge ahead of
their classmatese
In dissent* Mr* Justice Jackson went so far as to
say the school is being used as a jail for those students ivho
chose not to go to church in those circumstances„
-' ,

Nonetheless* that was upheld-.

And probably the most

extreme example is the Court's upholding of the constitutionality
of the conscientious objector provisions of the Selective
Serv5.ce laws* even through * they necessarily mean that some
people will be conscripted into military service in place of
those who are the conscientious objectors* or will be sent into
eamfoat in place of those who object to that kind of military
service* based on their religious scruples,.
This kind of accommodation has been called in
opinions of this Court "among our finest traditions*" and is
not really different in kind from the adjustments that were
made by the clerk in the argument schedule of the Court last
week and this week because of "religious holidays* in rearranging
some of the oral arguments of the Court,,
QUESTION:

Doing that once in four or five or* perhaps*

42

more years is quite different from having to adjust work
schedules day by day and week by week., is it not?
MR. WALLACE:

These are ail matters of degree,

Mr» «Justice, and I do want to say that the Courts of Appeals
have upheld the undue hardship in the operation of the business
defense in a number of instances in the context of this kind of
claim.

I don8t think the facts, of this case come close, to

the difficulties that were shown there0

into account.

There was no extra

Cost is a factor that is taken

The availability of substitute employees, the

affect on other employees, the possibility of having to be on
call for emergency service, factors of that sort have been
reviewed in the opinions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, in this case, however, we are

dealing with a statute providing for equal employment, and the
cases vie usually have, of course, involve alleged discrimination
with respect to pay or'promotions.
Now, the Petitioner here has not discriminated
against Mr. CumminsWhat the Petitioner wants is not equal
treatment.

He wants preferred treatment.

And it is a little

curious to find the provision of the Statute,701, that uses
the term "discrimination" in a context that results in the
argument being made here that because the employer accords
equal treatment to Mr. Cummins the company that employs the
employee is charged with discriminatory practice.

^3

The question I lead up to ask is ►. Whether or not
in connection with your constitutional argument the employer is
really not being compelled by law to accord a privilege* a
benefit* to an employee because of his religious choice or
preference,?
MRo WALLACE;

Well* the treatment; that has been

accorded is facially equal treatment* just as Mrs» Sherbert
was afforded facially equal treatment by South Carolina in
refusing her Unemployment Compensation benefits* along with
anyone else who refused to take a job that required work on
Saturday,,

Some people might have preferred to be at heme with
'*

their school-age children* etcetera„

■ *

•

•• f

There may have been

substantial reasons why they refused to take such employment»
But* if the dictates of one's conscience* one's
religion* forbid working on that day and leave the person with
no conscientious choice* you are into a situation where the
facially equal treatment has grossly dispai’ate effects on
individuals and causes a great hardship of having to choose
between the dictates of one's most deeply held beliefs and one's
livelihood c
There is an area where the legislature* I think*
quite properly* can go behind facially equal treatment to see
if there aren't ways of accommodating people so that they can
carry their full share of the work responsibility and still not
have their beliefs compromised in this way* in comparison with

44

others who might be observing their Sabbath on a day when the
company ordinarily does not require them to work»

They may not

be faced with the same problem at all*
It's an area that has required difficulties in
adjustment before the 1964 law was enacteda

Those difficulties

were faced in the collective bargaining process*and as part of
the 1964 concern with equality of employment opportunities*
Congress has stepped into this field in exercising its commerce

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: I think you have completed
your answer to Justice Powell* Mr» Wallacee
Your time is u.p0
Thank you»
Mr» Becker* do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD H. BECKER* ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MRe BECKER:

If it please the Court* unless there are

questions by the Court* I have nothing to edd to my prior
statement»
QUESTION:

What if the Civil Service Commission had

adopted precisely this sort of a regulation to be applicable
to Government agencies?

Would you say that violated the

Establishment Clause?

MR, BECKER;

There* I think* once again* Mru Justice

45

Rehnquist, we would be in the posture that the Government, in
order to avoid infringement upon free exercise would have to
make allowances,

But that's because it's the Government

which is the employer in that ease,
QUESTION:

Your client certainly has no Establishment

Clause or Free Exercise clause,,

It is a corporation„

All

they can do is raise the free exercise claims of the other
employees,

And I would think the other Government employees

would have just the same kind of a claim that the other
employees of Parker Seal do if the Civil Service Commission
made that sort of a regulation,
MR. BECKER:

There are several points to be made in

response.
First is, that the company does have a right to
challenge the statute under the Establishment clause.

Of

course, the company does not have an independent free exercise
claim, nor are we here today asserting* on behalf of some third
person, any free exercise claim.
But the company is coerced by Government to undertake
activity with respect to and in favoritism of a private
person's religious activities.

And that gives rise to an

Establishment clause objection here.
The second point is that the Government is a much
larger employer than the Berea, Kentucky, plant of Parker Seal.
And to the extent that we deal on the statutory plane, at least

46

each of these cases must turn on the number of fundable
employees who may possibly be substituting for one another*
That was not a possibility here where we dealt with a limited
number of supervisory personnel*
On the constitutional plane, I adhere to my answer
that the Government must make allowances as it did in the
conscientious objector eases where a failure to make such
allowance would give rise to a substantial problem under the
Free Exercise clause.
This was the point Mr* Justice White made in his
dissent in the Welch case*

It is the essence of the Yoder

decision of this Court*
There is a difference when the Government is the
employer,
QUESTION:

Mr* Becker, have any cf the eases in this

area Involved situations where the accommodation required a
violation of a collective bargaining agreement?
MR* BECKER: Yes, Mr, Justice Powell, there are cases
which, I believe,

are now pending in this Court on certiorari

which involve questions arising in such circumstances,
QUESTI®:

There is one I recall in the Circuit which

raised the question, but I don91 think it was involved in the
case directly.

Has there been a square holding anywhere?

MR* BECKER:
reserved*

TWA case does -- the question is

I hesitate for this reason, Mr, Justice Powell*

47

The question is ostensibly reserved by the Court of Appeals in
TWA* although you have before the Court a petition from the
union which says that the question can't possibly be reserved
because in order to carry out the mandate of the Court of
Appeals, it would be necessary to alter the seniority agreement
which the company has with the union»
In TWA, the fellow transfers from the night shift to
the day shift, loses seniority,as a result

is forced to take

on Saturday work and objects and the question presented there
is whether the union can be required to modify the collective
bargaining agreement in order to accommodate this employee»
QUESTION:

This question was reserved in Yott v,.

North American Rockwell Company»
MR* BECKER;

Well, in Yott, I believe, the case was

returned to the District Court, if I recall correctly, to
consider whether it is possible that an employee who declines
to pay his union dues can, nonetheless, somehow or other, be
accommodated»
The Court of Appeals said that it didn't have any
Idea of how this fellow might be accommodated, but sent the
case back to the District Court to see if they could figure
out a way»
QUESTION;
MR» BECKER:
QUESTION;

MR, BECKER:

Yes* that's correct»

There Is a similar case» a recent decision by the
Fifth Circuit., Cooper v« General Dynamics, where a similar
problem is presented*
QUESTION:

Mr* Becker, if this law is bad * why

wouldn 't the law be bad which simply said that the employer
could not discriminate on the grounds of religion?
MR * BECKER:

There, I think, Congress can justifiably

purge the channels of Interstate commerce of an obstruction*
The same reasoning that applied In Griggs would seem to me to
carry forward there*
QUESTION:

I know, but let's talk about it on the

Establishment clause grounds*
I suppose you would argue that the statute requires
the employer to avoid firing a person or refusing to hire him
on account of his religion, and the aim of it, the purpose of
it, surely is to aid religion*
MR9 BECKER:

No, I wouldn't say it was,

it's for a different purpose*

I would say

There is an overriding secular

purpose in a statute which seeks to purge channels of Inter­
state commerce of Irrational acts of employment which tend to
cut out of the job market certain people on the basis of

Irrational

and irrelevant considerations*

That's at the heart of the Griggs decision »«
QUESTION:

And you don't think that would reach this

49

case?

They Just want to clear Interstate commerce of religious

discrimination which can reasonably be avoided?
MR. BECKER:

There isn;t a scintilla of evidence in

the record here or before Congress that Congress had that
purpose in mind*
Mow# if Congress came back with s, statute which
said:

Me have conducted hearings and we have found that there

is —
QUESTION:

On my other example, if you couldn’t find

a scintilla of evidence as to what the purpose was* you would
strike it down* Just like you would this one.
MR* BECKER:

No* I don’t believe I would*

I would

say that a statute which seeks to purge channels of Interstate
commerce of discriminatory conduct —»
QUESTION:

' '

I heard you the first time*

I-don’t know

why that doesn’t reach this case* too*,
MR. BECKER:
QUESTION:
MR* BECKER:

Because* there is no indication —
Because there is no evidence* you said*
Well* also because the language of the

statute itself makes it clear that Congress was not concerned
about discrimination here*

It was not concerned that it needed

to tighten up or toughen up the basic anti-discrimination
provision of Title VII because it had uncovered a weakness in
the original statute.

The purpose of this statute is to help

certain people out precisely and solely because of their

50

particular religious circumstances*
QUESTION:

How do you explain the EEOC guideline in

1967 which was promulgated under the basic statute and then
Congress ultimately adopted?

That sounds like evolution

rather than a brand new thought coming into Congress5 mind*
MRe BECKER:

There is no question, Mr* Justice

Rehnquisfc, but that Congress was inspired by the 1967 guideline*
The problem was that; the guideline itself had been challenged
repeatedly in the courts as not properly promulgated under the
original statute.
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 3*00 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
