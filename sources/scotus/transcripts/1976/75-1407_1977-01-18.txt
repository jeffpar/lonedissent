ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. DINNER, III, ESQ.,
ON. BEHALF OF APPELLANTS FINLEY AND ELROD

;

MR, DIENNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
My name is John A. Dienner, III.
State's Attorney here

I am an Assistant

representing the defendants below,

Morgan Finley, the Circuit Court clerk, and Richard J. Elrod,
the sheriff of Cook County.

Mr. Bargiel, also with me here,

is from the Attorney General's Office and will be speaking
for defendants Trainer and O'Malley.
This suit originated as a consequence of the
Illinois Department of Public Aid having filed an action in
the Circuit Court of Cook County wherein the federal plaintiff
was the then state defendant, and he was charged with having
fraudulently concealed certain monies which he and his wife
had in a credit union from the Illinois Department of Public
Aid when they, the Hernandezes, applied for public assistance.
The amount that the Illinois Department of Public Aid
asserted that they received that they were not entitled to

4
was $720.

The complaint in the appendix, starting at page

15, sets forth the facts of this cause of action, and the
allegations and facts in support thereof may be found
starting at page 15.
Mr. Hernandez, with his counsel, came to the
Circuit Court of Cook County and filed his appearance.

When

he found that the attachment action had been continued for a
period of time, pursuant to local Circuit Court of Cook
County practice, they immediately came and filed the instant
federal action in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.

Their

jurisdiction was based upon 42 USC 1983, and they sought
declaratory and injunctive relief from the Illinois Attachment
Act.
A three-judge panel was convened, and the defend­
ants filed—all defendants, filed motions to dismiss, and the
plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment.

The classes

were certified, both plaintiff and defendant classes.

And

the three-judge panel ultimately declared the operative
sections of the Illinois Attachment Act to be unconstitutional
as violative of Due Process rights.
The defendants whom I represent, defendants Finley
and Elrod—the sheriff and court clerk—-were enjoined from
issuing and attaching pursuant to that act.
stay was denied.

A motion for a

Notices of appeal were filed.

5
A jurisdictional statement was likewise filed,

The

case was docketed, and here we shall proceed.
Initially I would like to speak briefly to the
proppriety of the class that was certified by District
Judge Kirkland,

My defendants allege and assert that the

plaintiff has failed to plead compliance with Rule 23(a)(3)
in establishing the propriety of the plaintiff class.

Their

allegations in that regard are defective on two counts.

First

of all, while there is a conclusory allegation of irreparableinjury as to all plaintiffs, none is asserted factually in
support of the class members.

Ther© is no fact upon which

the District Court could conclude that the class members,
excluding Mr. Hernandas, suffered any irreparable injury.
The second defect is that some potential class
members of the plaintiff class are also creditors; in other
words, any person, corporation, or business entity could be
an attaches as well as a person attempting to attach a debtor’s
property.

And they, therefore, would have no particular

interest in the relief sought by the plaintiffs herein.
In fact, their interest would be quite to the
contrary.
Q

Mr. Dienner, in your questions presented in

your jurisdictional statement did you raise any question
about the. class?
MR. DIENNER:

We did mention in our briefs, both our

6
original brief and our reply brief—
Q

In your defects presented in the jurisdictional

statement, did you raise these questions?

I do not think you

did.
MR. DXENNER;

I do not believe that the defect of

the class was mentioned in the jurisdictional statement, no,
Mr. Justice Stevens.
As a consequence, I believe that the class with
relief was erroneously granted, and because the entry of that
order certifying the class was of course an interlocutory
order, it is not mad© final until the final order that is
presently before this Court.
I would like to speak briefly to the issue of
abstention as well, this being of particular concern to my
clients.

My clients believe that the federal courts ar©

undoubtedly the ultimate guarantors of all persons' federal
rights.

They do, however, assert that the state courts are

the primary guarantors, and this must be so for obvious
reasons«.

Otherwise ©very federal issue conceivably could

b© .raised by any plaintiff or defendant in any typical state
action. Tort, contract and the like would have to first core©
to the federal district court, be decided on the consfcituiona 1
issues, remanded to the Circuit Court of Cook County or any
other state court for further trial on the issues.

Now, this

of course relegates the state courts, in my opinion, to the

7
role of perhaps masters in chancery to the federal district
courts, and this is quite antagonistic to our obviously
alleged violations of comity and federalism in this case.
As a matter of fact, the Illinois Supreme Court within the
last month, decided a case-—it was a tax injunction suit.

And

in that case the court made query as to whether or not they
were not in fact becoming masters in chancery to the local
district court but of course made that observation only in
passing.
The two exceptions that will allow a court to
override the basic premises of comity and federalism is when
there is either a bad faith enforcement of state laws—'not
at issue here and never alleged—or when the new statute is
violative of expressed constitutional provisions in every
clause, paragraph, and sentence.
There were no such allegations of bad faith
enforcement, and of course the three-judge court did not find
the violation in every clause, sentence, and paragraph.
As a consequence, fch© District Court in its failure
to properly take account of comity and federalism as raised
and specified more accurately in fch® Huffman and Younger
decisions, the consequence; of that action results in 204
State of Illinois officials being enjoined from acting
pursuant feo a lawfully enacted state statute; 102 of those
state officials are county sheriffs, ©ach of whom is charged

8

with the duty of maintaining the peace.

We submit that the

creditors, as a result of being denied the opportunity to
use the court systems in the Attachment Act, will resort to
self-help, available both under common lav? and the Uniform
Commercial Cod©., and contract provisions also that may permit
self-help, thereby establishing a far greater risk of
breaches of the peace.

To this, of course, the sheriffs

have a particular interest.
This federal action by our local District Court
was made prior to any state court determinations or interpeti­
tions of the lav?.
Q

Mr. Dienner—

MR. DXENNER:
Q

Yes, sir.

—are the sheriffs of every county in

Illinois, in addition to the sheriff of Cook County, bound by
this decree of the District Court, or ar© you just suggesting
they will probably obey it as a precedent?
MR. DXENNER:

Defendant classes were certified,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and Sheriff Richard J. Elrod of Cook
County was a class representative on bahalf of all similarly
situated sheriffs throughout the state.

So, all 102 of the

sheriffs of Cook County were class defendants.
Q

If you look at page A2 in the appendix to the

jurisdictional statement, it clearly appears that th© threejudge District Court thought it was at least ordering the

9
sheriff of every county in Illinois and every court clerk.
MR. DXENNER:

They certainly had that expectation.

That amounts, as I said, to over 200 state officials who have
been enjoined as a result.

This leaves creditors with a

lack of full and complete remedies.

And of course this Court

in the other prejudgment garnishment tyo® actions has
recognized the creditors have no fewer rights certainly than
debtors, and a balance must be struck between the two.

And

we assert of course that that balance was struck in the
situation and that the action of the federal District Court
was totally unwarranted in this regard and has unnecessarily
interfered with matters of special state concern.
As to issues of state remedies available and the
like, I at this point, if it please the Court, will defer to
Mr. Bargiei, who will speak for the Attorney General's
Office.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Bargiei.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BARGIEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS TRAINOR
MR. BARGIEL:

AND O’MALLEY

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
My name is Paul Bargiei.

I am an Assistant, Attorney

General from the State of Illinois, and I represent the
Appellants Trainer and Hernandez in this matter.

Appellant

Trainor is the Director or Acting Director of the Illinois

10

Department, of Public Aid*

And Appellant O’Malley is an

employee of the Illinois Department of Public Aid»

And it.

was at the behest of Appellants O'Malley and Trainor that the
writ of attachment, which is the subject of this appeal, was
sued out in the lower court.
In the brief time allotted to me I would like to
take a very simple and straightforward position on behalf of
my clientsc

We suggest or content to the Court that any time

a plaintiff comes into a federal court and seeks an injunction
intervening in a pending state court proceeding, where the
state is bringing the action in the state court and where the
state is doing so in aid of a valid and legitimate state
purpose, that the federal court ought to refrain from issuing
such an injunction in the absence of exceptional circumstances.
Q

Where the state or a state agent is plaintiff

in the state court?
MR. 8ARGIEL:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

You are limiting your proposed rule to that.

MR. BARGIEL;

Those are the facts which the record

presents in this case.
Q

Have you got any better reason for limiting it

t© that, that those just happen to be the facts in this case?
MR. BARGIEL;

No, not that they just happen to be

the facts in this case,but where the state is bringing the
cause of action and doing so in support of a valid and

10 ~ A

legitimate state purpose, it seems to me that the principles
which underlie comity and federalism are obviously more
appropriate than were the plaintiff in the lower court action,
a private citizen bringing an action against another private
citizen.

And I think that that is a fair statement of soma

of the decisions of this Court in recent times.
The exceptional circumstances under which a plaintiff
in a federal District Court can ask for an injunction, this
Court has indicated that as being a demonstration or showing
that there is some sort of bad faith on behalf of the state
in bringing the action.

I suppose one example of bad faith

is a demonstration that the purpose of bringing the action on
behalf of the state is to harass the individual defendant.
There has been no allegation in the plaintiff’s complaint,
seeking injunctive relief that there is any bad. faith purpose
on behalf of the State of Illinois, that its purpose is to
harass.

There was no finding by the three-judge court in its

order or memorandum opinion that the state was acting in
bad faith or that its purpose was to harass.

And, in fact,

no such showing can be made because the purpose which the
state was actuated by in this cas© was to recover welfare
funds which war© disbursed to the federal court plaintiff
pursuant to a request for funds wherein he lied and secreted
certain assets which he had.
There are two affidavits in the record, in the

11
appendix, 1 should say, I think which demonstrate reasonably
clearly that the federal court plaintiff here was in fact in
all probability, or the reasonable inference is that he was
guilty in fact of welfare fraud.

These affidavits appear at,

if 1 am correct, page 15 and 17 of the record-appendix,
I am sorry.
record.

X apologise.

The pages are 52 and 53 of the

On page 52 there is an affidavit of an employee of

the company at which the federal court plaintiff had his
credit union wherein he says that the federal court plaintiff,
Mr. Hernandez here, has accumulated a certain amount ©f
money in the credit union, and he has an account which has
bean open from January 3, 1972, and that he had a balance on
hand of $1,193 on November 30, 1974.
three of the affidavit at page 52.

This is in paragraph
There is an affidavit at

page 53 of an employee of the Illinois Department of Public
Aid wherein the employee of the department indicates that
Mr. Hernandez received public assistance for the same period
end in fact said in his application that he was unemployed and
had no assets.
So, it appears to m® quite clear that the state was
actuated by a valid and legitimate state purpose in this
particular case, which is that of combatting welfare fraud.
The other circumstance, exceptional circumstance,
under which a plaintiff might be entitled t© injunctive
relief to restrain a pending state court proceeding from going

12
forward is, as Mr. Dienner pointed out, then a situation
where the plaintiff can show that the statute in question is
patently and flagrantly violative of constitutional
prohibitions in every clause, sentence, phrase, and against
whomever it may possibly be applied.
I would suggest first that the statute here, the
Illinois Attachment Act, has never—-at least its validity
has never been construed by the Illinois Stats Supreme Court.
And we would submit to this Court that there are saving
constructions and applications which would result in its
validity.

One suggested application of this statute, which

w@ submit would result in a finding that it would be
constitutional, involves on page 29 ©£ the appendix the
application of Section 2, which talks about an affidavit and
a statement.

It says in all actions sounding in tort where

the underlying obligation sounds in tort that before an
attachment shall issue upon the affidavit of the attachment
creditor, that the attachment creditor has to appear before
a judge.
says;

I am reading from page 30 of the appendix.

It

"Before the writ of attachment shall be issued, the

plaintiff, his agent or attorney shall apply to a judge of the
circuit ©f the county in which the suit is to be brought or
is pending and be examined under oath by such judge concerning
the cause of action."

So„ it is clear that even though there

is no notice before the attachment takes place where the

13
underlying action sounds in tort that the attachment creditor
would have to appear before a judge and be examined concerning
the cause of action.
Q

That did not happen in this case* did it?

MR. BARGIEL:

In this particular case, no, Your

Honor, because the department apparently took a position when
they filed that--they did not take the position that the
underlying action sounded in tort.

That may have been a

mistake.
Q

But this goes to your argument that the

statute is not unconstitutional in every letter, comma, and
so forth?
MR. BARGIEL:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is, there may be one or two parts that

sure constitutional; that is what your argument is?
MR. BARGIEL:

I am suggesting with regard to the

question of abstention—
Q

Yes, I see.

MR. BARGIEL:

—that that at the very least is one

easy example of how the statute might be constitutionally
applied.

I am not saying that it is limited to that.

But

for that purpose, I am suggesting that.
Q

Do you not get some suggestion from th® District

Court's opinion, however, and is it not also true generally
that the state distinctions between contract attachments and

14
tort attachments , that, the reason for requiring a hearing in
a tort attachment is to fix the probable amount of recovery,
whereas in a contract claim like yours

you really do not

have that.
MR. BARGIEL:

I frankly do not get that impression.

I know that the three-judge District Court in its opinion
apparently construed that provision of the statute as limiting
it to a determination of the amount of damages in a tort
action.

However, the literal

language of the statute itself,

which has not been construed by the Illinois Supreme Court,
indicates that the attachment creditor shall appear before
a judge and be examined concerning the cause of action.
I would submit

And

to Your Honor that that is a very limiting

construction which was indulged by the federal District Court
and not one which would necessarily be indulged by the
Illinois Supreme Court, and that the Illinois Supreme Court
ought to have an opportunity or at least the courts of
Illinois ought to have an opportunity to construe that section.
That would be my position with regard to that.

I think that

the language itself is broad enough to incorporate-Q

But how could they construe it in this case?

MR. BARGIEL:
Q

Eow could they construe it in this case?

MR. BARGIEL:
G

Pardon?

I do not. say that they could.

So, the federal court should abstain until

15
somebody els© files some other lawsuit raising this issue?
MR. BARGIEL:
Q

Mo.

This procedure is very seldom used, is it not?

MR. BARGIEL2

That is not my position at all.

Again

with regard to this one particular provision, what 'I am saying
is that this is an application of the statute which will result
in a finding of its constitutionality.

What I think is, with

regard to these plaintiffs and the facts which were presented
here, I think that these plaintiffs had an opportunity—and I
must, say too, before I leave that point, I would like to

say

that th© federal District Court never did make a finding that
the statute was patently and flagrantly violative of the
Constitution in every clause, phrase, and so on.

While they

make some reference to that in their memorandum—
Q

They said it was patently and flagrantly

violative of th© Constitution.
MR. BARGXEL;

They did find that,

They said it. was unconstitutional on

its face, and it appears t© me that there is some question
as to whether or not—
Q

They also use the words "patently and flagrantly"

on page B5 of the jurisdictional statement.
MR. BARGIEL;

That is true too.

I believe it says

patently and flagrantly violative on its face.
Q

They are taking about two or three pages to

analyze decisions of this Court to make up their mind.

16
Q

They may have been wrong, but at least they said

it, is all I am saying,
MR. BARGIEI,:

Yes, I will agree to that.

It is not

exactly clear to me which standard they were applying at that
particular time.
I would like to, if I may, in the very few minutes
that I have left address myself to the other aspect of this,
the question of abstention, whenever a plaintiff comes into a
federal court and requests an injunction to stop a state court
proceeding.

The second prerequisite—and I submit that the

first was not met here, that is, that there was no demonstra™
tion of clear and immediate irreparable injury as required by
this Court's decisions—the second prerequisite is that the
plaintiff has to demonstrate to the federal court that he has
no opportunity to timely raise and have adjudicated by
competent state tribunal with federal Questions or issues
which are presented.
Our position here today, that the plaintiffs in this
particular case had an opportunity to raise all these questions
in a timely fashion before a competent state tribunal and
conceivably could have had their action and the relief that
they requested before the 13 months that it. took for the federal
District Court to enter its injunction.
Q

So, is it your point that quite apart from

Younger v, Harris or anything else, just as a matter of the

17
issuance of an injunction, that there as an adequate remedy
at law?
MR, BARGIEL:

I would certainly take the position

that they had a remedy available to them, yes.
Q

Because quite apart from dual jurisdictions or

federalism or anything else, equity chancellor should not
ever issue an injunction under ordinary equitable principles
if there is an adequate remedy at lav/.
MR. BARGIEL:

Yes, I think that that is true; I

would agree with Your Honor.
Q

I am asking you what you are saying, not

whether—is that your point?
MR. BARGIEL:

My point is that Younger and Huffman v.

Pursue reflect the idea that, in my reading, as an indispensable
prerequisite to obtaining relief in a federal court by way of
an injunction, plaintiff has to show that he has no opportunity
to raise these questions and have them timely decided in a
state court.
I am saying yes, he has an adequate remedy, but I
am also saying that Huffman and Younger reflect that kind of
philosophy, and X think preclude this kind of relief here.
Our position is that the plaintiff could at any time after
the writ of attachment was issued have come into state court,
filed a motion to quash the writ; ha could have contested the
facts upon which the writ was issued.

He could have tested

18

the legal sufficiency of the writ.

He could have raised the

constitutional objection that he wanted to or that he ultimately
raised in the federal court; and he could have motioned this
up for hearing at a time convenient to him, upon proper notice,,
in this case to the Illinois Department of Public Aid.
Q

Can you give me a citation or some rule or

some statutory provision that contemplates this kind of motion?
MR. BARGIEL:

On page 43 of the appendix, Section

26 of the Illinois Attachment Act indicates that the provisions
of the Civil Practice Act—Q

Forty-three?

MR. BARGIEL:
Q

under, except as otherwise provided.
And Section 70 of the Civil Practice Act--G

19

Q

Just give me the citation»

MR. BARGIEL:

Section 70 of the Illinois Civil

Practice Act.
Q

What does that permit: a person to do?

MR. BARG1EL:
quash.

It says:

A Section 70 motion is a motion to

"A party intervening to move to set aside

or quash any execution, bond, or other proceeding may apply
to the quarter to adjudge it as chamber for certificate that
there is probable cause for staying further proceedings until
tiie order of the court on the motion.'’
I am saying that he could have filed a motion to
quash the writ of attachment with the judge of the Circuit
Court of Cook County, contesting the legal facts upon which
the writ was issued-—
Q

Just contesting his right to an attachment or

the facts underlying the basis—
MR. BARGIEL:

No, I am saying I think he could have

raised anything in that writ.
Q

That is my position.

Have you got some basis for that?

Have you got

some Illinois cases illustrating a fellow whose bank account
has been attached, coming in and putting the—

On what grounds?

MR. BARGIEL:

is true.

Section 27, which is on the following cage of the

Illinois Attachment Act, says that the defendant can answer
traversing the facts stated in the affidavit upon which the
attachment is issued and that the answer has to be verified.
It says he can file a counterclaim.
It seems to me that the plaintiff can file because
toe Civil Practice Act applies to this procedure, that the
plaintiff can file any motion which he could file in any civil
proceeding, and he could call that motion up for a hearing on
proper notice to the other parties—in this particular* case

No, you have some

That is the signal for your rebuttal.
MR. BARGIEL:

Oh, I see.

At any rate, if it has

not expired, I think I have at least attempted to make my
point, which is that the federal District Court in this case
should have abstained because there was no showing of clear
and immediate irreparable injury, and I think that there was
an adequate remedy in the state court available to the plaintiff
for adjudication of his federal claims.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED L. LIEB, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. LIEB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
At the outset X would like to emphasize that the
propriety of the injunction against Apnellees Finley and
Elrod and the class of county court clerks and sheriffs that
they represent has not properly been presented to this Court
for review.

Appellees Finley and Elrod did not file any

22
jurisdictional statement raising any questions for review.
The jurisdictional statement of the appellants did not
challenge the class, nor did it challenge the propriety of
the injunction against defendant classes of clerks and
sheriffs.

It merely raised the question of the propriety of

the injunction against the appellees, the appellants proceeding
against the appellees in the state court.
Appellees submit that in light of this, the
injunction against the class of county court clerks and
sheriffs cannot be vacated on the appeal of the appellant since
that issue has not been properly presented to this Court for
review.
Q
an appellant.

You are not saying that Elrod was not himself
You are just saying he did not preserve this

issue; is that right?
MR. LISB:
an appellant.

Under the rules of this Court he is not

In fact, their brief is submitted as appellees

in support of appellants' position.
Q

The jurisdictional statement, on the face of it,

lists EJ.rod as an appellant, does it not?
MR. LXER;

Yes, but I believe that was mistaken.

It says, "Jurisdictional Statement for Appellants Trainer and
O'Malley," and this Court was docketed as the case of Trainer v.
Hernandez.
Q

Trainer was the only named appellant on the

23
docket?
MR. LIEB;
Q

Trainor and O'Malley.

Does not our rule ten cover it?

I may be wrong

as to number.
MR. LIEB;

Ten-one states—I believe it is ten-one--

that all parties in the proceeding below shall be parties in
the Supreme Court.
Q

But it also permits them to adopt the co-

appellants’ position, and I thought they had done that here.
MR. LIEB;

Precisely.

However, the jurisdictional

statement of the appellant does not raise the propriety of the
injunction against the appellees,
throughout Illinois.

the clerks and the sheriffs

Therefore, this injunction cannot be

challenged on appeal, and that injunction must remain in full
force and effect regardless ©f how the Court rules on the
appeal of appellants Trainor and O’Malley.
Q

You are not suggesting that we say that the

District Court should have abstained in the case brought

War® they members of the class?

And are they class representatives hare?

MR., LIES:

That is right, Your Honor.

They are representatives of the class.

So, if it were held that, the court should have

abstained, the injunction against the entire class would be sat
aside-

Is that right or not?

I do not believe that the court could—

The attachment creditors.

Everybody else is an appellee, every other

party to this case?
MR. LIEB:

That is right.

All the other named

parties and the class parties.
In light of this fact alone, we submit that either
the appellants’ appeal must be dismissed or the judgment
affirmed since there is absolutely no effective relief that
the Court can give the appellants.

If the injunction remains

in effect, no creditors, including the appellants, can obtain
pr©judgment attachments in Illinois.
The appellants have emphasised the fact—
Q

What are

MR. LIEB;

we hare for?

We are hare because the appellants filed

a jurisdictional statement, and this Court noted its probable
jurisdiction.

However, I submit that the issues raised in

their appeal do not. allow the Court to vacate the injunction
against appellees, class representatives who have not appealed,

And where did you raise that point?

We raised that point—-first of ailf we

raised it in our motion to dismiss and, secondly, we raised it
as point one in our brief..

That
In

that case state officials were bringing a quasicriminal action
pursuant to a specific statute which gave those officials the
exclusive right to bring that action.

In the instant case, the

appellants utilised a general creditor's remedy which can be

27

utilised by any creditor in the State of Illinois.

And, as

the District Court noted, it was mere happenstance that the
creditor in this case happened to be the state.
Furthermore, the District Court did not enjoin
appellants from proceeding against appellees in the state
court on their claim against the appellees.
In spite of the District Court's injunction against
the pr©judgment seizure of property under the Illinois
Attachment Act, the appellants were always free to proceed
against the appelles in the state court on their money claim.
However, it should be pointed out that the appellants
voluntarily chose to dismiss those proceedings.

They stayed

those proceedings and ultimately dismissed those proceedings
although nothing in the federal court injunction recmired them
to do so.
Thus any claim of interference with their attempts
to sue the appellees simply cannot be taken seriously.

Might they not have felt that in the absence

of some sort of garnishment or attachment the judgment would
just be worthless?

While the District. Court proceedings ware

pending, the appellants stayed the state court proceedings.
Ones the federal District Court enjoined the attachment,
enjoined the appellees from proceeding to

utilise the

Attachment Act any further , the appellants dismissed their
case on the merits against the apoellees.

Therefore, any

claim that they make that the federal District Court inter­
fered with their attempts to sue the appellees in the state
court or to interfere with the litigation at all in the state
court simply does not have any merit because they just dis­
missed that suit sua sponte.
Q

But they dismissed it after they were told

they could not attach in connection with it, did they not?
MR, LlEBs

That is correct, Your Honor.

the appellees were working.

However,

They could have possibly obtained

a judgment here.

I do not think that the record shows that

they could have.

But had they obtained in a judgment, they

could have utilized a whole variety of postjudgment procedures
t© execute upon that judgment.
Q

Why did you go to the federal court?

Why did

29
you not take your constitutional challenges to the state
court in the attachment proceeding or in the-MR. LIEBs

There are a number of reasons, Hr. Justice

White, why we went to the federal court»

First of all, we were

raising a constitutional claim—
Q

Are the state courts in Illinois incapable of

dealing with constitutional claims anymore?
MR. LIEBs

Yes, Your Honor.

However, this was a

federal claim under 1983 for an injunction against state
officials charged with the execution of the act.
Q

Could you have gone to the state in this

proceeding--in the very proceeding that is pendinq—could you
have presented your claim in a timely manner?
MR» LIEB:
Q

Not in a timely manner.

That is what I want, to know.

What could you

have done in this pending state action and when?
MR. LIEB;

First of all, it has to be emohasized

that whenever the issue is raised in the state court, it is
always after the injury has occurred.

The property is seized

without, as we allege, due process of law.
Q

I understand that.

Could you at the moment you

heard about it have gone into the court with a motion and
challenged not only the grounds for -the attachment but ask
that probable cause on the underlying debt be established?
MR. LIEB;

W© could have tried, Your Honor.

30

Q

Is there a procedure available for that?

MR. LIES;
act.

There is no express provision in the

That is not quite what I ‘am asking you.

Could you or

not?
MR. LIEB:

We could have attempted to do so.

There

is no precedent which would have allowed us to have done that.
Q

You mean no one that has ever been attached has

ever gone into court trying to gat it released?

Is the only

way you can release it by putting up a bond?
MR. LIEBs
putting up a bond.

No, there

is a number of ways.

One is

Th® other is by answering the affidavit on

the merits, that is, denying the grounds.
Q

That is Section 27.

MR. LIEB:

That is right.

And then ultimately there will b© a trial in that
issue.
Q

But that does not release the attachment.

MR. LIEB:

If you win on the merits of the attachment

At the end of the lawsuit.

Q

No, at the and of the hearing on the attachment.

MR. LIEB:

That is right, the hearing on the

The act provides

that the debtor may file a. counter affidavit.
Q

It is all spelled out on the top of page 44

of the appendix.

31

Q

Yes, I have read it.

MR. L1EBz

'

And that there will be a hearing on the

factual issue as to whether or not an attachment was justified.
There is no provision in the act for moving for any other type
of hearing.
Q

Could you have filed an action for an injunction

against the enforcement of the act on the ground that it was
a violation of the United States Constitution?
MR. L1EB;

We could have filed a separate suit in

state court.
Q

This one is a separate suit.

MR. LIES2

We could have filed a separate suit in

state court.
Q

Just like the one in the federal court?

MR. LIES:
Q

Exactly.

Under 19 83 .

MR. LIES:

Exactly.

However, I do not believe that'

Younger v. Harris requires an exhaustion of all state
remedies.
Q

My question was, You could have?

MR. LIES;
Q

Y@gB Your Honor.

And theoretically you could have gotten full

relief.
MR. LXEBs

The 1aw in Illinois is unsettled on that,

on the question as to whether you can get plaintiff class and

32
defendant class relief.

We might have gotten an injunction

in this instant case.
Q

Is there anything in the law that says you could

not?
MR. LIEB%

Q

The answer is no, Your Honor.

So, there is a possibility you could have?

MR. LIEB:

That is right.

We could have gone into

state court in a separate proceeding and filed a 1983 act.
Appellees submit that three decisions of this Court
are clear authority for affirming the District Court5s
decision'

to proceed to the merits of this case.

Those

decisions are Lynch v. Househould Finance, Fuentes v. Shevin,
and Gerstain v. Pugh.

Lynch and Fuentes concern summary

creditor remedies almost identical to the Illinois Attachment
Act under review.

The Lynch case concerned prejudgment

garnishment, and in effect this case is a garnishment since
the property was held in the hands of a third party.

And I

might add that Lynch was also a garnishment ©f a credit union
•i ••

account.
In Lynch and in Fuentes the Court found the proceed- .
ing, the prejudgment seizure, not to be a proceeding in state
court.

In Lynch the Court considered the question of the

applicability of the Ante Injunction Act.

And in Fuentes

the Court directly considered the question as to whether
Younger was a bar to this proceeding.

And I would like to

33
quote from Fmant.es because I believe that this quote is
directly-Q

Puentes was there an available and 'immediate

hearing on the attachment?
MR. LIESi

In Fnenf.es there would have been an

eventual hearing.
Q

Eventual.

You seem to indicate that under

these proceedings you could have gone right into court and
challenged the attachment, including any allegations about the
underlying debt.
MR. LIEB:

Yes, under Section 26 we could have.

Yes, under Section 26 we could have.
However, the statute does not provide for an
immediate postseizure hearing.

You can answer the affidavit

by filing a counter-affidavit, and there shall be a trial
thereon„
Q

That is separate though from the main trial?

MR. LIEB:

The trial on the merits.

an attachment is different from a replevin.

But, you see,
In a replevin the

question of possession pendente lite is almost identical to
the question of ultimate right to possession.
Q

What sort ©f calendar delay are you talking about

in the Circuit Court of Cook County with that kind of minitrial?

Do you know or d© you not know?
MR. LIEB;

The way the procedure works is this.

The

34
writ of attachment which is served upon the debtor indicates
at the bottom that the hearings on attachment will be disposed
©n the return date.
Q

That is from 10 to 60 days.

MR. LIEB;

After the date of the writ.

In this

instant case we did appear on the return date ? and we asked
for a hearing.

We were denied a hearing, and we were told

that these cases are routinely heard 30 days later.

So, there

could be a 9G-day period before you have the opportunity for
that hearing.
Q

Does that not suggest that perhaps the class

©f sheriffs of 102 counties in Illinois may not have bean a
little broad because you would not suggest that there is that
same delay in every one of the 101 counties besides Cook
County?
MR. LXEB:

The delay is possible under the statute.

There is no right to move for an earlier hearing, so that the
statute is unconstitutional on its face since there is
possibility for a delay of that long or greater.

The act does

not even say you have to have the hearing on the return date.
The act just says, "There shall be a trial thereon."
Q
its face

if

Are you saying a statute is unconstitutional on
an

unconstitutional delay is possible under its

terms?
MR. LIEB;

This has to be seen in terms of the

35
Mitchell decision where the Court found that one of the saving
aspects of the Louisiana prejudgment sequestration statute was
that there was an express provision for an immediate postseizure hearing»

And what we are saying is that the Illinois

Attachment Act does not, have an express provision for an
immediate postseizure

You mean it just does not have the word

And the creditor can amend the writ- and continue

attachment.

the

The hearing is provided for only in Section 26,

which says you are entitled t© a trial on the attachment
issue.

It does not say when.
Q

That is Section 27?

MR. LIEB:
Q

Section 27.

I am sorry.

At least the District Co-art said that the

statute makes it, puts it within the power of the creditor to
defer the hearing for at least 60 days.
MR. LIEB:
Q

That is right.

Because under the statute the return day he must

36
make no less than ten and no more than 60 days.

So, the

hearing is not going to be before the return day, and he can
defer that—
MR. LIEB:
Q

That is correct.

—for 60 days.

MR. LIES:

It is up to the discretion of the court.

And, I would add, any time that the debtor comes in and asks
for an earlier hearing, the creditor could object to that on
the grounds that he is not prepared, and he would ordinarily
have the right to that later hearing.
Q

On what date did you begin the action in

federal court approximately?
MR. LXEB:
Q

1974.

MR. LIEB:
Q

I believe that was December 3, 1974.

That is right.

And you could not have gotten this state

proceeding moved along before the lapse of two years and now
almost two months?
MR. LIEB:

First of all, w© got the District Court

decision a year later.

We are talking now about an appeal to

this Court, which has taken further time.
Q

It is now 25 months approximately—

MR. LIEB:
Q
60 days.

Yes.

First of all—

-“Since you could have sought some relief within

We

And that was not

decided, but it was settled so that we did get half of the
funds.

The Due Process issue was briefed, and we would have

gotten a decision in June.

But during this time the Huffman

decision came down, and we were asked to rebrief that issue.
That is only something that would happen once.

If this Court

would resolve that issue in our favor, that issue would not
come up again.
Q

You think that if the District Court had

abstained in this case, not necessarily under any command of
the doctrine of Younger v. Harris but had just abstained

to

allow the Illinois courts to construe their statute, do you
•think that it is at least arguably possible that the Illinois
courts, having read the Mitchell v„ Grant case, would have
said that Section 27 requires a prompt hearing, at least as
prompt as was accorded in Mitchell?
MR. LIEB:
Your Honor.
0

I think that would be rewriting the statute,

I think that—
That is not contrary to the statute.

MR. LIEB:

That has to be read in pari materia with

the return date provision, that the return date can be set
anywhere from 10 to 60 days, and the common understanding of
the return date is when—
Q

The hearing cannot be before the return date.

38

MR- LIER:

That is right*

And X would like to add

too on this point that these procedural protections have to
b© seen working together, not separately*

A major defect in

this case, as w® have pointed out, is the lack of the
requirement to plead facts in the affidavit which would support
the grounds for the attachment, and the requirement of having
to appear before a judge to establish with these factual
grounds the need.

So, even if there were an eventual hearing,

even with the right to move for a hearing, the initial seizure
does not have adequate safeguards to protect the debtor from
unconstitutional deprivation of his property*
On that point on the possibility of a wrongful
deprivation, I would like to turn to a point raised by the
appellants, that is, that they had a meritorious claim here
and that they were justified in the attachment.

While it is

not the role of this Court to determine that issue, 1 think
that, an examination of what really happened points up the
great possibility in this case of a wrongful attachment.
The papers filed by the appellants In the federal
District Court-G

Mr. Lieb, before you get too far in this, you

could litigate that in the state courts, could you not?
MR. LIEB;
Q

The merits of the state court claim?

Yes.

MR. LIEB;

Certainly.

And we were well prepared to

39
litigat® that in the state courts, and nothing in the federal
court injunction prevented any of the parties from litigating
that in the state courts.
The affidavits that the appellants have referred to
actually establish that there was no grounds for

fraud.

Unfortunately in their printing of the appendix, the affidavit
which appears on page 52 , there is an insert, an attachment
regarding how much money was in the account at the time the
alleged fraud took place.
item five.

That does appear in the record at

Their affidavit indicates that Mr. Hernandez

applied for public assistance March 24, 1972.

The itemized

statement ©f his account indicates that on that date he had
$55 in his credit union account.

Mow, under Illinois law,

fraud cannot be alleged in a conclusory fashion except in the
Illinois Attachment Act.

When you file a complaint for fraud,

you have to allege specifically factual allegations.

You have

to allege misrepresentation of a specific fact, intent to
deceive, materiality of the allegation, reliance, and damages.
If the attachment creditor had been required to allege those
specific facts and to present that to a judge or any other
officer who knows what the lav; is in Illinois, this attachment
would never have been issued because a person who applies for
public aid can have more than $55 in assets at the time he
applies; so that if they had alleged -the specific allegation
that he said he did not have anything and he really has $55,

40
they could not allege materiality because he would have
gotten the money anyway.

The record also shows that

Mrs. Hernandez did not even have a credit union account at
tli© time and, furthermore, that she was not the person who
applied to public aid.
tions.

Therefore, she made no misrepresenta­

So, therefor®, if the specific facts would have had

to have been pled in the state court to & judge, based on
their own evidence in the record, there would not have been
an attachment.
Yet, because of the fact that you can get an
attachment by filing an affidavit with conelusory allegation
of fraud, presented to a court clerk who merely stamps that
affidavit and sends it summarily on to the sheriff, they were
able to deprive -these persons and all other creditors are
able to deprive all other persons similarly situated of their
property without due process of law.
Q

Is that in the record, that this was done

ministerially by some official in the court?
MR. LIESs
Q

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

Who knows that?

MR. LIES:

Who testified to that?

The statements were made in our allegations

in the complaint which were not denied.
Q

Is th@r© anything els© in the record? is there

positive testimony by a live witness?
MR. LIES:

There was no testimony.

This was all

Is there an affidavit that says that?

No»

I do not think there is any dispute as

I believe that all attorneys who practice in

Illinois—
Q

Is it admitted by the state?

MR. LIEB:

We alleged it in our complaint and it was

not denied.
Q

I thought the state said that you appeared

before a judge and presented an affidavit.

Is that not what

the state argued here?
MR. LIEB:
Q

Did they not argue that?

MR. LIEB:
Q

Only in tort cases.

Yes, only in tort cases.

And you say that is not true?

MR. LIEB:

In contract cases it is presented to a

court clerk.
Q

Who <3© we believe, you or the state?

MR. LIEB;

I believe we' ©re both making the same

allegation.
Q

Oh, I see.

MR. LIEB:

Q

We agree on this.

This was decided on a motion to dismiss by the

42

defendants and on your motion for summary judgment»
MR» LIEBs
Q

Summary judgment, that is right»

A motion fe© dismiss admits all pleaded

allegations in the complaint,), does it not?
MR» LXEB%
Q

That is right.

Mr. Li@b, I understand from what you said that

you think there t^as no probable cause for the filing of this
attachment.
MR. LIEBs
Q

That is

correct, Your Honor.

Do you agree with the Attorney General of

Illinois that a tort action lies against an attachment
creditor who files an attachment without probable cause?
MR. LIES:
Q

And is he entitled also to punitive damages?

MR. LXEB:
Q

That is correct, under the statute.

That is true.

Have you filed any such suit?

MR. LXEB:

No, we have not.

First of all, this is

the state, and in order to sue the state, you would have to
go into the Court of Claims, and it is a very difficult
procedure with no right of appeal.

The initial problem we

confronted was the constitutional problem for the appellees
and the members of the class.
that resolved first.

So, therefore we tried to get

There is a damage claim pending in the

federal courts right now, though under this 1983 action, and
that will be reconsidered and we intend to pursue that.

43
Q

That is before Judge Kirkland?

MR. LISE;
Q

That is right.

1 am having some difficulty in keeping the

various state and federal forums straight.

In response to a

question from Justice Stewart a moment ago, you answer® that
something was disposed of on a motion to dismiss.

Which piece

of litigation is that?
MR. LIEBs
Q

The federal court suit, this case.

You mean it granted your injunction on a motion

to dismiss?
MR. LIES:
Q

Cross-motion, motion to dismiss.

And your cross-motion for summary judgment.

MR. LIESs
Q

And cross-motion for summary judgment.

So, it resolved all disputed facts in favor of

■fell© appellants?
MR. LIES:

That, is correct.

I would like to go back to the Huffman issue and poit
out that the Gerstein v. Pugh case I believe disposes of this
issue in our favor.

In that case a unanimous court concluded

that Younger v. Harris was not a bar to a federal injunction
against pretrial detention of arrestees, charged by a prosecutor
on information without a preliminary hearing.
quote briefly from
this case.

And I would like to

that statute because it bears directly on

The Court noted:

at the state prosecution

The injunction was not directed

as such but only at the legality of

44
pre-trial detention without & judicial hearing, an issue that
could not, be raised in defense of the criminal prosecution.
The order to hold preliminary hearings could not prejudice the
conduct of the trial on the. merits.

In this case the District

Court injunction was not directed at the state court pro­
ceedings as such—-that is, at the merits of the underlying
claim-—but only at the legality of pre-trial detention of
property which had been carried out without du© process of law.
That issue could not be raised as a defense to the main claim
of the creditor.

And finally and most importantly, I believe,

for purposes of Younger, the resolution of the constitutional
issue in the federal court did not prejudice in any way the
litigation of the conduct of the merits in the state court.
I believe in light of tee Gerstein case and the
Puentes and Lynch case, which I mentioned previously, that tee
District Court's decision to proceed to the merits of the
constitutional claim and to enjoin the county officials from
carrying out the provisions of the Illinois Attachment Act was
clearly correct.
Therefore, we respectably as this Court to affirm
the judgment below.
Q

Before you sit down, Mr. Lieb, I want to be sure

I understand the points you made at the outset of your argument.
In this case ©very clerk' of every judicial circuit court in
Illinois in every county in Illinois has been enjoined ever in

45
the future, under a permanent injunction, from ever issuing a
writ of attachment under this law.

And every sheriff in every

county of Illinois has been similarly permanently enjoined
from ever executing any such writ.

It is your point, as I get

it, that that is the way it is and that is the way it is
going to be from now on and that no court has any power to
correct that, even if it is terribly wrong in the judgment of
some court or another? is that it?
MR. LIEBs
Q

That is what. I thought, it was.

MR. LIES:
Q

Y©s, Your Honor, that is correct.

Parties must properly appeal.

A notice of appeal was filed here, but it was

never followed through on.
MR. LIES:
Q

That is correct,

Do you think these appellants ar® qualified or

have, standing t© raise the abstention point?
MR. LIEB:

Against them but not against the other

partias.
Q
not abstain.

I know, but the court cannot both abstain and
What if it war® held that the court should have

abstained, as these appellants say it should?
MR. LIEB %

I believe the only decision the court

could reach is that the. District Court should not have reached
the question of the injunction ©gainst the appellants.

There

may have been other considerations and I submit there were-—

46
Q

If the court should have abstained, it means it

should not have proceeded with judgment»
Q

You have a bifurcated abstention.

Q

It should not have considered the merits of

your lawsuit, if it should have abstained.
MR. LIEBs

I believe that under Younger one could

consider the various circumstances concerning each one of the
appellants or each one of th© defendants in federal court.
And sine© the sheriffs and clerks were not parties fc© the
state court proceedings, there would be different considerations
going t© whether ©r not th® injunction against them was proper.
Q

But if you enjoin the sheriff and the clerk-—

but you say that you should never have gotten into the case
of th© plaintiff-—in affect, th© plaintiff does not get any
benefit from th® abstention because what he is trying to
utilize is a state court procedure that you are allowing to
be used against somebody else.
MR. LIES;

I believe that the appellant could have

rectified that problem by,number one, appealing the class so
that th© issue would have bean limited to--had they succeeded
in overturning the. class, then the sole question would be the
injunction against them in favor of this particular plaintiff.
And I believe -that they could have presented to this Court the
precise issue of whether or not th© injunction was proper
against th® other parties.

I assume you would object to having it remanded

so this could be straightened out.

I assume you would object

to that.
MR. LIEB;

Absolutely, Your Honor.

It is not a

matter that needs to be straightened out by the District Court.
It is a matter that the partias should have straightened out
before they appealed.
Q

Mr. Li©b, did any defendant aver file an

appearance or a pleading on behalf of the defendant class as
a group and purport to represent the defendant class?
MR. LIEB;

Finley and Elrod filed an appearance when

they were first served.
Q

For themselves or for the class?

This was before th® class was certified.

Before it was certified.

MR. LIEB;

Right.

We then moved for certification

Th© appellants Tr&inor and O'Malley filed

a memorand inn in opposition to the certification of the
plaintiff class.

They never even raised the question of the

defendant class.

No.

in or out or anything like that?
This is a 23(b)(2) class.

So, I

believe under the federal rules there is no necessity.

Q

Does the record show whether the members of the

class who are not individually before the court ever received
actual notice of any of the proceedings?
MR. LIES:

The record does not show that.

However,

it is my understanding that after the -judgment was issued,
notices were sent out to the various sheriffs and clerks
informing them—
Q

Was it pursuant to court order, or was this

something informal?
MR. LIES;

This was an agreement between the

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
anything further?

Mr. Diermer,do you have

You have about two minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. DIENNER, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES FINLEY AND ELROD
IN SUPPORT OF APPELLANTS
MR. DIENNER;

Yes, if it please the Court,

Mr. Chief Justice;
Two quick points.

First as to our appeal as

representatives of the defendant classes, defendants Finley
and Elrod, we filed our notice of appeal.

That is the manner

in which an appeal is taken pursuant to Supreme Court rule
tan-one„

Pursuant to ten-four, all parties below are parties

before this Court.

Rule fifteen-threes

Related cases from

49
the sanie court can file a single jurisdictional statement.
In this case all issues as to all defendants, state
defendants, county defendants, and class defendants were raised
in a single jurisdictional statement.
Rule 46 of the Supreme Court also permits of course
joint appeals where parties who are jointly or severally
interested may join in an appeal.
a motion to

In the court below we filed

adopt all pleadings that have been filed by the

state defendants and that will be filed by the state
defendants.

As I pointed out, all issues as to all defendants

were properly preserved in the jurisdictional statement.

We

designated ourselves as appellants in the designation of
portions of the record and also in the jurisdictional
statement.

We filed a notice of appeal, we filed briefs, and

we filed appearance in this Supreme Court.

We assert that

under the Court's own rules there is no question ©f the fact
that the representatives of the class and the class themselves
a.r© before this Court and have properly preserved all issues
raised below.
Q

Do you think the other people on your side

should have filed a brief as appellants?
MR. DIEMNER:

We filed a brief.

We entitled it and

designated it as a brief of appellees in support
position of the appellants.

of the

I think that was an erroneous

caption, but it is by no means jurisdictional.

W@ are

50

appellants.
Q

We assert—
So, you would like to change that designation?

MR. DIENNER:

W® would indeed.

We assert that we

are unequivocally appellants in this position.

We ware misled

initially by an interpretation of -Supreme Court rule ten-four
as requiring that result.

Further thought and reflection on

the matter convinced us it is otherwise.
One other thing—
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. DIENNER;

Make it very brief.

■—that is of ultimate importance in

this cas©, under the Civil Practice Act attachment debtors
have an unequivocal right under the Civil Practice Act of
Illinois on two days notice to motion up a motion to quash,
dismiss, file a counterclaim for summary judgment—
Q

You are speaking of rule 27 then?

MR. DIENNER;

Under rule 26, adopting the Civil

Practice Act into the Attachment Act.

They had possibility

of filing motion to dismiss, summary judgment, declaratory
relief, third party action.

I could cite you the sections if

Your Honors were interested.
One last matter, and that is that you will recall
that the plaintiffs are in forma pauperis before this Court,
thereby rendering nugatory ranch benefit of proceeding with
fch© attachment action in the state court when they in fact
are apparently judgment proof, thereby giving explanation for

51
the dismissal of that case once we were enjoined from attaching
their assets.

I assert that they had various remedies under

the Civil Practice Act and under the Illinois Supreme Court
rules.

On two days notice they could have been in court

presenting and preserving all of their constitutional issues»
Thank you, Your Honor»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2;50 o* clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
