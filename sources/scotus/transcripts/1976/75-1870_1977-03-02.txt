MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in Nos. 75-1870 and 75-1872, E. I. du Pont against
Collins and Securities and Exchange Commission against Collins.
Mr. F@rb©r, I think you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FERBER ON BEHALF
OF THE PETITIONER SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION
MR. FERBER:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

Aa this Court knows, a closed-end investment

company, like a mutual fund,which is an open-end investment
company, consists of a portfolio of securities that is managed
in the interest of its stockholders.

Unlike a mutual fund,

the outstanding stock of a closed-end investment company is
not redeemable at the instance of the shareholder.

\

Over

the years the stock of closed-end companies is usually traded
on th® market at a significant difference from the value of
the asset portfolio, usually substantially lower.

It is

this disparity between the asset value,-that is, the market
value of the portfolio held by a closed-snd investment
company, in this case Christiana Securities Company, and the
lower value in the market of its own stock, th© Christiana
stocky that gives ris® to the difference in this case between
th® Securities and Exchange Commission and th© Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

4
The casa involves the reasonableness of th©
*

Commission's determination that the terns of a proposed
merger of Christiana Securities Company and E. I. Du Pont d©
Nemours and Company are,within th® meaning of section 17(b)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, reasonable and fair
and do not involve overreaching.

As the Court knows, Du Pont,

of course, is a giant industrial company, having some 47
million shareholders, and its stock is considered to be of
prim© investment quality.

Christiana is a closed~@nd company

with some 8,000 shareholders.
over-the-counter market.

Its stock is traded on th®

Ninety-eight percent of its assets

consist of Du Pont common stock, and ‘that adds up to som®
28 percent of all of Du Pont's stock outstanding.
Now, the merger that is involved here essentially
provides that Christiana is to turn over all its assets
consisting almost entirely of its Du Pont stock, and will
than disappear.

Du Pont will issue its common stock in a

slightly small®r amount than th® amount turned in by
Christiana to Christiana's shareholders.
QUESTION;

Mr. Ferher, I suppos® it isn't relevant,

but how long has Christiana been in existence?
in th® pre-P©rsonal Holding
MR. FEKBER:
believe, your Honor.
the sana time

Yes.

Was it formed

Company Act days?
It was formed around 1915, I

And I believe Du Pont was formed about

5

In all, th©r© ars

13.4, roughly, million shares of

Du Pont: stock that Christiana is turning in to Du Pont, and
it is about 13.2 million 3har©s that Du Pont is putting back.
So th® -affect of the transaction is really a liquidation of
Christiana that will cost its shareholders approximately
1.8 parcant of its assets.

Now, that comes to lass than th©

2.5 parcant, th® difference ■— because, of course, the sams
Christiana stockholders will become Du Pont shareholders, and
that accounts for th© difference b@tw©@n th© 2.5 percent,
which would be about $55.6 million, and the cost of tha merger
to th® Christiana stockholders.
Th® great advantage, of course, or on® of th©
advantages to the Christiana stockholders by this kind of a
mergar is that it permits the elimination of Christiana
without th® heavy tax consequences that would bo required
either by Christiana liquidating by distributing its Du Pont
stock to its Christiana shareholders or by somehow sailing
that stock and distributing th® money to the shareholders.
Th® advantage -—
QUESTION:

I talc® it there is no question

about the qualification as a tax-free transaction within the
r

Internal R®venue Cod®.
MR. FERBER:

As I understand it, the Internal

Revenue people have approved th© proposed transaction.
What it would do particularly for any Christiana

*

6

shareholder

which would want to sell his shares is h© will

presumably get somewhere between 20 to 25 percent more than
he would get if he just want out on the market and sold his
Christiana stock, because that has been 20 to 25 percent,
the discount over the past few years prior to th® announcement
of this merger.
Th© amount cumulatively, as of the figuras in 1972
on which th© record was based, would be a saving, if you
totaled it all up and if everyone were going to sell their
stock, which of course is not going to occur, of soma
$450 million for th© Christiana Securities holders.
Th© merger is subject to the Commission approval
because 17(a) of th® Act provides that an affiliate of an
investment company,which Du Pont is by definition, may not
purchase, and I quote, "any security or other property from"
such investment company unless the Commission finds under
Section 17(b) of th© Act that th® -- and I quota again -"terms including consideration to b© paid or received are
reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching."
Th.@ Commission made this fairness finding on the
ground that th© transaction was based primarily, almost
entirely, upon an exchange of equivalents, Du Pont stock for
Du Pont, stock.

Using the market value of the Christiana

stock, as the Court of Appeals indicated should have been used
at least to some degree, would, of course, deprive th©

7
Christiana shareholders of a significant portion of th© vain©
of th©ir company’s assets.
Th© Commission also specifically found that th©
Du Pont stockholders would be in no way injured.

They would

b© benefited, in fact, to th© ©xt©nt that each share would
represent th® somewhat greater interest in Du Pont, there
being

188,500 fewer Du Pont shares outstanding after the

merger than before, and in addition th® Du Pont Company would
get som© $34 million, th© remaining 2 percent of Christiana's
assets.
Th® Commission must approve any application under
Section 17(b) if it can make the requisite findings.

There is

no public interest consideration that is spalled into idle
statute at this point.

But the Commission did indicate that

th® elimination of th© unnecessary holding company was sound
and salutary, pointing to the provisions of Section 11(b) of
■tii® Holding Company Act where th® Commission, of course, has
been instructed to get rid of, and has over th© years don®
so, many of th® unnecessary holding companies in the electric
and gas holding company systems.
The majority of the Court of Appeals held that the
Commission erred in establishing, and I quote, "a rul© of law
that closed-end investment companies should be presumably
worth the value of their net assets."
held, the majority, two judges,

Th© Court of Appeals

that fairness required th©

8

Commission to give substantial weight to the market price
of Christiana’s stock.

It stated also that th© Commission had

to find, and again I quote, "that th© transaction carries th®
earmarks of an arm’s length bargain.'5

So in effect it h@ld

th® Commission could not find th© proposed

it®rgar

fair unless

Du Pont should hav® exerted its strategic bargaining position
to extract probably as much as several hundred rail lions
dollars worth of Christiana’s assets as consideration for
Du Pont going along.
Now, I propose to deal in th© rest of my feiitse with
the justification of the Commission’s us© of asset value,
essentially th® value of Christiana's Du Pont holdings, and
th® court’s error in holding, first, that th® market value
of Christiana's stock was to b© given substantial weight, and,
second, that th© transaction must hav® th© indicia of Arm’s
length bargaining, as th© court interpreted that term.
QUESTION;

Christiana's stock wasn't raaliy involved

in this merger, was it, except insofar as determining what
amount of Du Pont stock after th® merger th® various Christiana
stockholders would receive?
MR. FERBER;

Exactly.

Christiana will disappear.

The stock will disappear;

Th© stock is in effect merely th®

measure of what each of th® — in other words, if you want —
QUESTION:

— ox-mars of fch@ stock will receive in

terms of Du Font's shares after the merger.

9
MR. FERBER:

That's exactly right, your Honor.

So thus Christiana peopl© are being permitted to own directly
a little less of what they owned indirectly through Christiana»
1 was about to say that Mr. Gribbon will deal with
suggestions of the Court of Appeals and of petitioners that
even if the Commission would otherwise have been right, it
could not

approve

the merger because them was an

insufficient sharing of the benefits and because of the alleged
detrimental market impact

'th© merger would have on

s

Du Font's stock.
Contrary to the Court of Appeals, it is our position
on ©ach of the subjects that the Court of Appeals dealt with,
statutory language, legislative history, prior Commission
decisions, practice under comparable statutory provisions,
that, th© Commission did act in accordance with ©ach of these.
Th® us© of th© net asset value, the value of Christiana's
portfolio, is certainly in accord with the statutory language.
The words "reasonable," ’’fair," "not involving overreaching,"
describing th® terms, including th© consideration to be paid
or received, describe, exactly what the Commission found to b©
an exchanges of equivalents,

Du Pont stock for Du Pont stock.

Du Pont is not buying, as th® Court of Appeals
indicated, Christiana stock.

It is buying Du Pont stock and

that is tlia consideration to be paid within th© statutory
language.

10
An investment company, unlik® an operating company,
has no going concern value — that is, a full investment
company.

There ar@ some that ara so-called hybrid companies

that might have some business operation as well as h©ing an
investment company.

But in th® company that has only

securities which have a market, the way the value has always
been determined by the Commission and generally in most
instances is you measure the value of its assets, its
portfolio.
As the Commission, noted, it said, "Investment
companies are as a general rule media for long-term investment.
That makes n®fe asset, value the touchstone, and the Act is
based on that premise."

-

Th© use of net asset value also is in accord with
the legislative history.

Th® Commission stated, "Congress

chose to protect closed-end stockholders against dilution of
intrinsic value." The 1939 study of the Commission that, led
to th© Investment Company Act showed that security holders
ware often in need of protection against their affiliates.
Tbs report is filled with numerous examples of unscrupulous
managers who are entering into transactions with their investment
company and diluting the net asset value.
.That

many shareholders of Christiana may b© sophisticated,

unlike perhaps the more usual situation with investment
companies, does not mean that they aren't to be accorded the

11
same protections that Congress provided for all shareholders
of investment companies.

And section 17 was the means

Congress set up for that protection»
Now, the court cites numerous opinions to suggest
that the Commission has not always found that net asset value
is the appropriate test.

The Commission has always said that

that is the starting point where you have an investment
company that does consist., like Christiana, solely of
securities.

Most of fch© other cases-

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Wa will resume 'there, Mr.

F©rfo©r, at 1 o’clock.
(Whereupon, at 12 noon, fch® oral argument was
recessed, to reconvene at 1 p.m. the same day.)

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FERBER ON BEHALF
OF THE PETITIONER SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION (RESUMED)
MR. FERBER:

Mr. Chief Justic®.

When the br®ak

cam® „ I was just about to point out that th@ Court of Appeals,
w© think, misread th© Commission's opinions in stating that
the Commission did not always give great weight to the net
asset value, that is, the portfolio value test.

Son® of the

cases which the Court of Appeals cited were situations where
l

the investment company involved was what I described before
as a hybrid company, a company that had enough securities for
investment purposes that it £@11 within the Act, but also
was operating a business.

And in those situations th©

business would, of course, be valued as businesses normally
are in accordance with its income and expenses, and so forth.
Th© oth@r type, of casas, and there were 3®v@ral,
particularly th© Talley case, which involved the TalleyGenaral Timas merger, where neither company was an investment
company; because 17 is broad enough to catch mergers between
affiliates of an investment company, you had -feliat situation
where. there was a machinery company and a great many other

13
things and General Timasawhich was a watch company,merging.
So the net. asset; value, th® portfolio value of 1:1*® stock, was
not involved.
Th© fourth area in which th® court disagreed with
the Commission was that th© court suggested that th© net
asset value test of the Commission was not consistent with
som® of the reorganization statutes.

But certainly th©

Public Utility Holding Company Act under which th® Commission
for faany years,in th© forties and fifties particularly, was
conducting reorganizations of ©l@ct.ric and gas utility holding
companies, in those cases tin® on® thing that goes through all
the cases is that the security holder is to receive th®
equitable equivalent of what he is giving up.

And, of course,

that seems to b® completely consistent here. Th© Christiana
people ar© giving up Du Pont stock and they are getting Du Pont
stock.

Similarly, th© reorganizations under Chapter 10 of

the Bankruptcy Act have that same -test of equitable equivalent.
1

And on© of th© cases under Chapter 10, the Central States
Electric Corporation cas®, is very, vary much in point.
Central States at that time had as its two principal assets
tv/c closed-end investment companies.

Arid in th© advisory

report of th© Commission, they went into this question of how
should thsy b© valued, according to what th® stock of th@s©
subsidiary companies ware selling for in th© market or
according to what their holdings war© selling for, and it mad©

14
a difference of closes to $4 million.

And the Commission

determined that it was what their portfolio securities sold
for in working out the value of -this company for reorganisation
purposes.

?h© district court accepted the Commission’s

recommendation, and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit affirmed, quoting much of the language of the
Commission’s report.
It said, and I quote, "The proper method of valuing
the assets of an investment company such as -this is the
presently realizable market values of the securities on hand.”
And it was referring to the holdings of these subsidiary
investment companies, almost $4 million more 'than the market
value of their own stocks.
Similarly hare, of course, it is the market value
°f Christiana's holdings that is basic.
I would lik© finally to

zmf&x

to the case of

Papper v. Litton which our opponents and the court below cited
against us, which is sort, of odd sine© that is on© of the cases
that I think in most of our bri@fs w@ were r@lyi.ng on.

If s

cited for Mr. Justice Douglas' language about arm's length
bargaining.

But in the Pepper case, a person who owned his

one-man corporation, was using it to defraud creditors, and
in fact did so greatly to th® cr®ditorss injury.

Uni Ik© the

Pepper case, as we h&v© seen here, no on® has been injured
by this merger.

15
More importantly, th® P@pp®r case was a protest
against a fiduciary utilising what Mr. Justice Douglas
r@far.red to as his strategic position for his own preferment.
Section 17 treats affiliates of an investment company as
in a position that is certainly comparable to that of a
fiduciary relationship to the investment company.

So here

we have th® respondents claiming that there should have been
arm's length bargaining so that they can in effect hold up
Christiana's shareholders and require them to hand over
something approaching $200 million of their company's Du Pont
stock.

As th© Commission pointed out, a principal reason

why Section 17 of th© Investment Company Act requires us to
pass upon th© fairness of transactions such as this is to
prevent persons in th© strategic position from using that
position to ©££©ct transactions for other than fair value.
Sur@ly it was not unreasonable for th© Commission to conclude
that fairness doas not require that Du Pont us© its strategic
position to deprive Christiana's shareholders of several
hundred million dollars of their company's assets..
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Gribbon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. GRIBBON ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER E» I. DU PONT DE
NEMOURS AND COMPANY ET AL
MR. GRIBBON.

y

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

16
th© Court;

As th© members of th® Court have already

perceived, this case presents non© of the tantalizing
constitutional issues that ar@ th® Court5s usual far©» Indeed,
th© transaction under question is a direct response to the
vagaries of th© Internal Revenue Cod®.

If th© liquidation

of Christiana could b© accomplished with the same simplicity
and lack of tax consequences that attended its arantion 60
years ago, there would hm no occasion for this merger.

The

shares of Du Pont stock which Pierre. Du Pont and his five
associates contributed to Christiana would simply be taken
out of th© vault, broken up into denominations appropriate
to ba distributed to their successors in interest, th© 8,000
shareholders of Christiana.

But th® tax consequences, and

particularly th© complexities of determining Christiana's
accumulated earnings and profits rule out a simple liquidation
of its assets.
\

Paradoxically, however, essentially tee same result
can ba accomplished through a merger with Du Pont and not,
I might say, because of any quirk or technicality in tee
merger lav/.

Mergers ar© tax free because they involve only

a change in th® form rather than in th© substance of an
investment, and this fits that and has been ruled to be a
tax-free merger by th® Internal Revenue Service.
Now, the terms of th© merger, as have been stated,
call for Du Pont to issue about 13.2 million shares of its

if
own stock and to receive in turn from Christiana about 13,4
million shares and miscellaneous assets valued at about $26
million net.

Now, thes® terms reflect, as Mr, F®rb®r has

shown, what has been referred to as net asset value.

That is,

the shares of Du Pont stock, which represent 98 percent of
Christiana, ars valued in exactly fch© same way as the shares
of Bu Pont stock which Du Pont is going to issu®.
It is my understanding that the respondents contend
that even if, as Mr. Ferber has shown, -the Commission is
justified in saying that presumptively net asset value should
h® used in determining the terms of merger between an investmanl
company and its operating affiliate, that nonetheless feher®
are two special considerations in this cas© that dictat® a
different result.

Thos® two considerations are, first,a

sharing-of”b®nafits contention.

It is clear from the terms

and has been recognised that Christiana shareholders will
receive greater benefits than the Du Pont people.
The second reason why it is said that th® net assat
value should not control is an apprehension that th® merger
will causa a significant adverse market, impact in the value
of tii© Du Pont stock.

These ar© the two contentions I propose

to daal with, and I believe that an understanding of a little
of the background of this transaction may be helpful in viewing
those two contentions.
When Christiana proposed a merger, th© Du Pont

18
management: considered it. and concluded that; such a transaction
would cause no detriment to the Du Pont Company or stockholders
and would bring about certain significant benefits»

Now, the

principal benefit that the management saw was the dispersion
of the block of Du Pont stock, some 28 percent of Du Pont,
presently in the hands of Christiana,

That dispersion, in the

view of the management, would remove that block as a target
for people, unlik© Christiana, who war© inexperienced in the
chemical business and who might do harm or threaten to do
harm to Du Pont.
Now, I recognize that the Commission was lass than

greatly impressed by the magnitude of that benefit, but that
benefit, as far as felt® Du Pont management is concerned, was
and r@ma.ins the basic reason for this transaction from
Du Font’s viewpoint.
The Commission did agree completely that the
transaction would have no detriment to Du Pont or its share­
holders, and the Court of Appeals took no exception to that.
And both the Commission and the court agreed that in general
the elimination of companies such as Christiana was in the
public interest in terms of corporate democracy and elimination
of proli, fa ration of holding companies.
Now, in connection with the merger,both Christiana
and Du Posit sought outside. legal and financial guidance as
to th® terms upon which a merger would be appropriate.

Both

19
of thorn war© advised independently that the established
practice in the raergar of investment companies into their
operating affiliates was that the terms represent net asset,
vain© with paxhaps a discount of premium of modest amount,
depending upon individual circumstances.
Now, an exhibit prepared by one of the advisers,
which appears at 68? of the record, collects in short form
the 10 most comparable transactions that had occurred.

Six

of them had been approved by the Commission; four of thsra had
not been approved by the Commission.
and it is unchallenged

The important thing,

that this is an accurate statement

of prior practice in this area, every one of those transactions
was don® at net asset value.
Now, what this background suggests, indeed shows, I
submit, is that the merger terms were developed with the
assistance of outside financial legal guidance in an effort
by both sides to arrive at what terms would,first,reflect
established financial practice, and second, refloat the
decision of the Commission under Section 17.

The ultimate

authority of the Commission to find out whether these terms
were fair, reasonable, or reflected overreaching was recognized
from the outset of negotiations.

Thar® was never any attempt

to put anything ovsr on anybody.
How, the fact that these merger negotiations were
carried out in this manner may not necessarily be the ©nd of

20

th© inquiry, and I don't suggest it is.

1 do say it is

the complete answer to th© charge that respondents make, which
was accepted in part by th© Court of Appeals, that Massrs.
McCoy and Shapiro on to© Du Pont side laid down and played
dead for their Christiana masters.

Th© fact is that the terms

that they obtained for Du Pont turned out to be th® most
favorable terms for Du Pont that the Commission would have
approved.

Th® Commission specifically said it would not have

allowed anything to to© significantly batter than th® terms
that Messrs. McCoy and Shapiro got for Du Pont in th@s©
negotiations.
Let raa turn now to th® benefits.

Th© benefits that

we are talking about her© •—
QUESTION:

Mr. Gribbon, could you tell m© where

th® Commission said that.

I liras under to® impression they

said there was a rang® that was OK and toat this fell within
to© range.
MR. GRIBBON s

They said it was at to® upper part of

th© rang®, that something lower would have been satisfactory
but nothing significantly higher.
opinion.

I don't have th© opinion.

It8 a at th® very end of its
I can get it.

It’s at the bottom of pag© 35 and th® top of page 36
in th® Appendix on petition.
These benefits are of two kinds

%

First, th© 7

percent intercorporate dividend tar that Christiana now pays

21
as a corporatiori is obviously going to ba eliminated when it
ceases to te a corporation.

In addition, the market value

of th© Du Pont stock which Christiana’s shareholders receive
vrill he higher than th® present market valu© of th©
Christiana stock which they hold, the reason, being that they
are permitted, by going through a merger, to get that stock
in their hands and defer tea tares that would be payable had
they received that steak through a liquidation at this time.
So w© have a combination of a saving of the 7 percent tax
and a deferral of the tax that might b© payable war© tills
don® through a liquidation r.athsr than ’through a merger.
Th© Commission refused to direct a sharing of these
benefits essentially for th© sam© reason that it felt that
tli® Investment Company Act required it to look to net asset
valu® in these transactions.

Sharing of benefits her® is

really a euphemism for dividing what belongs to Christiana,
and they said, th© Commission, the objective of th© Investment
Company Act was to protect investment company shareholders
and net to taka things away from them.

And therefore, we do

not regard it as fair to have any significant division of th©
property val.u®s of the Christiana shareholders.

In substance,

th© shareholders of all investment companies when they corns
to dispose of their assets arc in essence wards of th®
Commission.

It is th® Commission that makes th© final

determination as to tlm terms on which 'they are going to b©

22
able to sell, and the Commission, had very much in mind that
it was the protection of investment company shareholders even
though some of them may be wealthy and even though they may
carry the name Du Pont, they are the ones to h® protected under
th® Investment Company Act.
QUESTION t

Would you carry that argument to the

point at which if th@r© had been overreaching in th© sense
that Christiana had a benefit that was 30 large there was
som© detriment to Du Pont, that the Commission couldn't have
disapproved feh®re?
MR. GRIBBON s

Th©y could h&v© disapproved it.

The

Commission went out. of its way to —
QUESTION?

Even though the impact were not on the

investment company shareholders.
MR. GRIBBON::

Th© Commission took the view, and I

think quit® properly, in on® of these transactions to look
out for the shareholders of both companies, not just th©
investment company, but for th© shareholders of the affiliate
and for th® management of both companies.
QUESTION s

Do you attach any independent significance

to th® word "overreaching” as opposed to th© words '’fair™
and '’reasonable"?

In other words, I take it your opponents

argue that that requires something

equivalent to firm's length

bargaining.
MR. GRIBBON:

1 cannot, your Honor, attach any

23
precise significance to the use of that.

I think it is fairly

common drafting of legislation to us® a lot of words, and I
think this just may have occurred to somebody as being a
stopgap.

It’s hard for me to see a transaction that is fair

and reasonable but is set aside because th©r© is overreaching.
Thera may he..

1 should think they ar® substantial equivalents.
/

QUESTION?

Your view on tha legal question, then, is

as long as there is no detriment to either sid®, it would b@
fair and reasonable within the statute.
MR. GRIBBQN:

Yes.

Well, to put it tli® other way,

it would be unfair and unreasonable to take from the
Christiana shareholders any significant part of their
property.
QUESTION:

Evan if you assume, as -the Commission

did for purposes of decision, that arm’s length bargaining
might have resulted in a transaction between willing parties ,
it would have been somewhat, different.
MR. GRIBBQN:

I think that’s right.

If, in fact, •

as the Commission was prepared to assume, there might have
been a different transaction, and this is highly speculative ,
whether there would have bssen different terms.
QUESTION:

I think th©y assumed that.

MR. GRIBBON:

They assumed it would.

And if that

is the case, then I think the Investment Company Act creates
an entirely new standard, one of fair and reasonable and lack

24
of overreaching.
Now, a second rasas on why the Commission declined
to ©ngag© in this sharing of benefits was that it £©lfe that it

I would say might have had a different

I think that's what the Commission was saying.

And I think, yes, the answer is that if you can conceive that
an arm's length transaction might have had it, then the
question is do the terms of Section 17, which the Commission
found to be fully carried out her©, fall by the wayside,
because somebody thinks that at arm's lenoth —

This Court would be —-

MR. GRIBBONz

it would ha justified, I think, in

doing 'that.
QUESTION:

Then it could go back to 1b® Commission

perhaps.
MR. GRIBBOMs

But let m® suggest to you that in

Niagara Hudson this court said that th© judgment of th®
Commission has been designated by Congress as the appropriate
gurdo to fairness under the Public utility Holding Company
Act.

I suggest that similarly, in th© Investment Company Act

it is th© judgment of the Commission that is the appropriate
guide -to fairness that has been designated by the .Congress,
and the Commission has mad® that determination.
But, in urging deference to th© Commission's informed
judgment under the Niagara Hudson principle, I don't need to
concede in the slightest that any genuine doubt has been
raised on this record as to th© correctness of that judgment.

26
Considar first th© 10 similar mergers of investment companies,
all that could be found by anybody involved in this transaction»
And every single on© of them was don© on the same principle.
How, are we to conclude that all the people involved in those
transactions and all of the members of the Commission who
approved them from time to time were either misguided or venal
as the respondents charge Du Pont to Christiana.
Next, throe experienced investment bankers, each
independently, looked at these terras and approved them, and
doing so, they put their integrity and their reputations on
th® line.

And I suggest it is significant that in the five

years that this transaction has bean in gestation, not a single
msrobar of th© financial community has come forward and
suggested that, there was any flaw in these terms.

I think

one can be assured that a transaction of this size has had
considerable scrutiny throughout th© financial community.
QUESTION:

The price was related to th© actual

market price of Du Pont shares?
MR. GRIBBON:

Yes; at th® time of th© merger.

But as Du Pont shares go down in value, up in value —
QUESTION:

I understand.

MR. GRIBBON:
QUESTION:

It floats.

But no consideration was given to the

fact that this block of Du Pont stock had any potential for
control?

27

MR. GRIB BON:

Control premium?

No.

Du Pont would

not — there was some discussion by the Christiana negotiators
that instead of a discount from that value f they were entitled
to a premium, but Du Pont refused to do anything like that.
QUESTION:

Did th© FCC talk about that at all?

MR. GRIBBQN:
QUESTION:

Did not address itself to that point.

Did they make any finding as to whether

there was a potential for control?
MR. GRIBBON:

They said there was under their Act,

there was a presumption of control under the Investment
Company Act with an ownership of more than 25 percent.
QUESTION:

But in arriving at their judgment of

value they didn't, mention this factor.
MR. GRIBBON:
Now,

lto, your Honor.

what' of the Commission's unanimous approval

after an evidentiary hearing and 15 months of deliberation,
I ask whether there is any rational basis for believing that
this public, nonpartisan body with -the full support, of its
extensive staff, with full knowledge of Christiana’s long
relationship with Du Pont, failed either wittingly or unwittingly
to balance the interests of tha 225,000 public Du Pont stock­
holders against the interests of tha many few Christiana
stockholders.

On tha contrary, th@.r@ is every reason to

conclude that the Commissi.cn gave tha transaction the very
unbiased scrutiny which the Court of Appeals said was intended

28

by Congress.

And, finally, a Federal district court, after

an. extended evidentiary hearing, has given the transaction
its blessing.
What, then, is there on the other side that suggests
doubt as to th© correctness of the Commission9 s informed
judgment?

Two things:

First, th© unsupported claims of

two out of Du Pout’s 225,000 stockholders with no particularly
relevant experience that Du Pont should exact a heavy price
for cooperation in th© termination of Christiana’s existence.
And, second, concurrence in that view by two members of -cue
reviewing court who found it highly significant and important
enough to observe that th© "du Pont family”, not Christiana,
the "du Pont family” had for many years retained the economic,
political, and social advantages that accompany control of
on® of America's largest enterprises.

To what extent that

entered into the opinion is not tlear, but it was important
enough that they mad© specific mention, something like a
bill of attainder.
I submit that weighed against, these two considerations,
the Commission’s informed judgment stands clean and untarnished
and is wholly acceptable.
I should now like to turn to the contention of the
respondent Murtaugh.

lie alone assorts, as a reason for

rejecting th© merger terms or, indeed, for prohibiting th©
merger, an apprehension that ‘the merger will have a s@ri.ous

29
adverse impact o:a the market value of Du Pont stock.

The

Commission gav© this contention the most, careful consideration.
Th© entire evidentiary hearing in substance was taken up with
it.

What that hearing disclosed was that the Murtaugh conten­

tion rests upon market impact concerns that were ©^pressed
with respect to certain plans having to do with Du Pont's
divestiture of General Motors stock pursuant to the order of
this Court in the early 1960s.

The Commission correctly

found -that this mar gar and the General Motors divestiture
have nothing in common.

Thera were two essential characteris­

tics of the General Motors merger that gave rise to the
apprehension that it would hav® an adverse impact on the
value of the General Motors stock.

The first of these was

that substantial sales of the General Motors stock each year
over a period of 10 years were ordered by the court, creating
a very substantial overhang for a 10-year period.

The

second essential characteristic was that there was bound to
be substantial unorganised selling by the individual share­
holders of Du Pont who would be receiving the General Motors
stock as a dividend, taxable at ordinary income tax rates
that the record showed would average at about 60 percent.
It. was, thus, ‘these two characteristics for selling
and tax soiling which did give rise to reasonable apprehension
of market impact and was on® of the factors that led to
legislation.

30

This transaction is entirely tax free.

Nobody has

to pay any taxes, nobody has to sell any stock to raise any
money to pay taxes, and there is no required selling by court
order or otherwise.

Indeed, the record shows and the

Commission found that there are strong reasons her© for
suggesting that holdings for investment rather 'than selling
will he the course followed by the former Christiana share­
holders.

Du Pont is an issues of prim© investment.

They have

been holding it in substance for many years, and they have
no occasion to consider a change in their investments.

The

owners of about 70 percent, of the stock, th© record shows,
have no intention of selling.

Over half of the Christiana

stock is, for all practical purposes, locked in because the
holders have either no basis or zero basis as a result of
the distribution of the General Motors stock,

that locked-in

position being a substantial disincentive to any kind of
selling.

And about 75 percent of the Christiana stock is

held by affiliates of Du Pont who can dispose of substantial
amounts only in carefully regulated transactions.
The Commission went on to say, "Even if wa assume,
with Murtaugh, that there will be soma substantial selling,
we nonetheless feel -chat it. is inappropriate for us at the
Commission to attempt to predict what 'the stock market
behavior is going to be.”
reasons:

And it did that for basically two

31

First, the merger would not altar Du Font's
investment quality in the slightest,have no effect on its
earnings, its assets, or on its prospects»

So there would b®

no effect there.
Th© second was that, everybody would be free to follow
his own personal interests because there would b© no uneconomic
factors that would cause either buying or selling.

Under

these, circumstances the Commission concluded that it should
not attempt to speculate on stock market behavior in
determining the fairness of this transaction.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gribbon, before you sit down, could

you answer on® question for me?

I noticed in the appendix

the report of Professor Upson and a series of questions that
h© answered.
for him?

Could you tell m© who drafted those questions

Does th© record tall us?
MR. GRIBBON:

Th© record discloses only that the

court drafted those questions.
QUESTION:

And th® order indicates that there was a

5-day period in which you could respond to th® report.

Did

you so respond?
MR. GRIBBON:
Commission so responded.

We did so respond.

I think th©

But I believe, now that your Honor

has raised that, that th© Eighth Circuit going to Profsssor
Upson really reflects tin© complexities of these problems and
the reason why it is the Commission rather than either the

32

reviewing court or a professor of business history who ought
to be passing on them.

Professor Upson produced for the

court what is really a whole new record.
about 45 pages.

It's in hare.

The Commission never saw that.

It's

And it

isn't the lawyers who were supposed to look at the evidence?
it's the Commission that is supposed to look at the evidence.
To some extent, and we will never know how much, Professor
Upson and the data he produced did influence two members of
that court to substitui® their views for that of the
Commission.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Collins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. COLLINS, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COLLINS:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The first point that I would like to make is that

the question before this Court is whether th® Commission
should have given significant notice to both the market value
and th® net. asset value of Christiana.

Repeatedly in the

briefs that have been filed by my opponents, the question is
presented as though the Caramission should have made a choice
between either the net asset, value or th® market value.

.And

I beHave that the question is a choic© of using both of
them and arriving at a verdict.

And I go back to my letter

of October 27, I believe, 1972, which appears at th® end of
the appendix.

And I ’wrote to th.® Commission in. answer to
*

33

t.heir request for any objections to fch© transaction, and I
said that in my opinion after considering the fact that
Christiana had consistently sold at a 20 to 25 percent
discount, that I believed fch© terms should b© don© on a 10
percent basis.

And that to m© is saying that both th© net

asset value and -th© market value have a material meaning.
Now, this cas© involves both economics and law, and
I believe that we should have an understanding of th©
different types of economic systems that th© country can
operata under.

You have first a capitalist system vrhich is

laisses fair© and money counts exclusively and the man with
th© most money has power cind the ownership or the means of
production are in privat® hands.
Another system completely opposed to that, would h@
a socialist system where all of fch© means of production arc®
owned by the state.

In either of these two systems I submit

that this cas© v/culd not have arisen.

But there is a third

system, which I believe prevails today in -this country, and
that is a middle-of-the-road system whereby there is
government intervention to balance the powers that ar®
controlled by private people, and that generally sp@ak.ing
v

the government intervention that has taken place in this
country has been, intervention on th® part of the weak as
opposed to the strong.

You have the antitrust laws, you have

the public utility holding company laws that arcs generally,

34
I believe, written with the philosophy of putting restraints
on individual powers.
Mow, getting down to the specific Act of 1940, one
provision of the Investment Company Act says that the ownership
of 25 percent or more of the voting stock is control, it is
presumed to b© control unless the Commission, finds to th©
contrary.
Mow, I submit that, forgetting about the Act, that
where you have 28 percent owned by on© corporation and the
other 72 percent of the voting stock scattered among 225,000
stockholders, that Act or no Act., it would be presumed that
the man with 28 percent of the votes controls.
Wow, th© second part of the Act says that if there
is a transaction between the man in control and his controlled
corporation, there should b@ no overreaching.

Another part

of the Act. says that th® Commission's findings of fact shall
be conclusive if supported by th© evidence.

And there is a

general lav;, I believe, that says that the administrative
agency, the Commission, should h® upheld unless it has an
erroneous view of th® law or unless its findings are based
on factual findings not supported by th® evidence.

And I

believe that it. is my burden to show either that the Commission
has an erroneous view of th© law or else that its findings of
fact are not supported by the ©videnea.
Now, I believe, first, w© should now have a picture

35
of Christiana, and Christiana is a control device. It is a
i

control device, and when you are talking about th© positions
of Du Pont and Christiana, to say that Du Pont is in the
strategic position, I believe, is somewhat out of order.

I

would say that the person on top, th© parson in control, as
between the two parties, th® person on top is in th©
strategic position if anyone is in a strategic position.
Now, there is a factual finding by th© Commission
at page A49 of the Appendix, and tha Commission says that
Christiana stock and Du Pont stock ar® economically equivalent,
and I challenge that finding.

I say that th® Commission has

raad© a mistake, because it has not realized the meaning of a
holding company, and for simplification purposes? what I would
like to point out. is this: -that if you have an operating
company with, say, 100 shares of stock outstanding scattered
among 20 people., that each share of stock is a share of stock
with an equal value.
Now, the minute that th® owners of 28 of thos©
shares, 28 percent, of those shares, get together find exchange
their shares of operating stock and out it into a holding
company and issue holding company stock against it, th®y have
owned something differant, they have created a different
animal.
Let’s say that, one man with 15 shares and another
man with 13 shares get together and they say we ar© going to

36
have a holding company.

Th© man with the 15 shares out of

to© 28 in toe holding company immediately has control of 28
shares.

He has a different stock.

He has something that is

not economically equivalent to what he had the day before,
his 15 shares of toe operating company.
'Mow, that is to© inherent natur® of a holding
company.

The purpose, fch® sol® purpose, of the holding

company, p@opl@ talk about it as dominating the operating
company, but first and foremost the sol® purpose of that
holding company is to dominate toe other stockholders»
QUESTION:

Was there a controlling shareholder of

Christiana?
MR. COLLINS;
QUESTION:

I do not know, your Honor.

I thought your theory was that if there

were, then that: single centre xx mg shareholder of Christiana
would become th© controlling shareholder of Du Pont.
MR. COLLINS;

I was saying, your Honor, that the

ownership of stock, that the stock itself of the holding
company is different, from th® stock of to® operating company.
QUESTION;

I see.

MR. COLLINS;

Now, I used th© analogy of 15 and 13.

If you brok© it down that there were 28 shareholders of the
holding company, I say that 15 of those 28 have control.

I

am saying that one share of Christiana i.s inherently different
than on© share of Du Pont.

It has to® potential voting power

37
that is greater than th@ operating company.
QUESTION:

And yet that might be expected, at least

in some circumstances, to command a premium.
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

And yet in answer to ray brother White’s

statement, there was no value accorded at all, no control
premium accorded at all in this cas®.
MR. COLLINS:

No.

But the Commission made the

mistake in saying that they are the same, that they are
economically the same.

And you get this strange situation, strange

on th© surface,that fch© stock, of Christiana, the control
stock,is sailing at a discount.
Now, I submit to th© Court that it is sailing at a
discount made up of two factors.

It is mad® up that ordinarily

without any taxes, if you eliminata th© tax situation, that
Christiana stock would be worth more than Du Pont stock on a
share-par--share basis.

But along comes Congress, not the

minority stockholders of Du Pont, but along comes Congress
and says hare a.rc^ certain tax laws and those tax . laws knock
down the price of th© holding company.
for th© stock of the operating company.

They don't: do anything
All they do is knock

down th© price of th© holding company.
QUESTION:

That is the tax on intercorporat®

dividends of, what, 7.2 percent, and a potential capital gains
tax.

38
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

On the appreciation of Christiana.

MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

And an unknown tremendous capital gains.

Yes, your Honor.

And that is just a threat hanging there.

It's not a tax that is imposed
MR. COLLINS:

It's not a tax that is rmposed, but

it exists.
QUESTION:

— until there is recognition of the gain.

MR. COLLINS:

Now, the Commission's view at first

glance is a very simple and a very fair view that these people
started the holding company, in my example 'with the 28 shares,
or to translate it into Christiana, they put in 13 million
shares of Du Pont.

And now they ara in a jam and they ar®

tired — they don't say this.
the other stockholders.

They are tired of dominating

I say that.

Now they ar© in a jam

and they don't want to control any more.
usefulness.

It's outlived its

They say we, fch© minority stockholders, the

public stockholders, should cooperate with these people at
essentially no cost, give it th® 2.5 percent, but at essentially
the no-cost idea, w® should agree that, they should have a merger
and avoid their taxes.
Now, an important distinction, I submit, lies
between the Public Utility Holding Company Act and th©
Investment Company Act.

In the public utility holding company

situation, the general idea was to break up- these holding

39

companies and they could not be born tomorrow or sometime
in the future.

But with the Inv@stm.ent Company Act, the

Commission its©If says that these people had ©vary right to
form Christiana, and I have* no quarrel with that, every legal
right in the world to form Christiana.

But they d© not go

on to say that tomorrow or five years from now -another group
can form another holding company. But the Public Utility
Holding Company Act, which says that you have got t© disband
fch@s© things, says they are not going to be resurrected again.
So her© we are.

This particular group is tired, for

on® reason or another, of its position and it wants to get out.
Judge Learned Hand said people are entitled to arrange their
affairs to avoid taxes, and X am in the tax business, that’s
my general field of work, and I believe that's true.

But

no ons, as a matter of principis, as a matter of general
principle, ever said people ar© allowed to arrange their tax
affairs or their business affairs so as to avoid taxas without
paying anything for it.

X don’t think anyon® ever said

©specially that the people who have been in control, who have
taken the control out of the majority holders’ hands are
entitled to arrange th©ir business affairs by calling on the
people they control to . help them and who have bean dominated
for 50 years.
Now, 1 believe it was Mr. Gribbon who described this
holding company as a ward of the Investment Company Act, that

40
the Investment Company Act was created to protect holding
companies or investment companies.
company."

I like the word "holding

But protect it against whom?

If Christiana is the

ward of th© Investment Company Act, what is Du Pont, what is
the party controlled by the investment company?
the ward?

I don't know.

Th© ward of

I don't know.

Nov/, I submit that th© Commission did not realize
that by its net asset value you ar© really writing an insurance
policy to th© people who want to control an operating company.
And as I say, there is nothing illegal or morally wrong,
perhaps, even, in creating a holding company.

It's just a

fact of th© way of our life. This is the v/ay th® rules of the
gam® are played, that th© owners of 28 percent of th® stock
can get together and dominato th© other 72 percent.

But I

say this, that if they ara going to do so, they should not b©
given a guarantee against loss. If they a re going to do this,
they do it with th® idea of gain.

In a capitalist society w@

operate on the idea of individual gain.

It may not sound very

nice, but I believe that is th© way th© gam© is played.
Now, if they are allowed to do this, to create this
holding company » I believe that they have the right to the
profit, if any, they can gain from it.

Th@y create a holding

company, they take th® control of an operating company,.

If

they could find a buyer, if they could find a buyer at a
premium, at. a 20 percent premium, they could go over and sell

41
it. and put it in their pocket and walk away with it and they
would not have to share it with fch® other 72 parcant of the
stockholders.

And that is perfectly legal and perfectly

justified as far as I am concerned.

But if that is their right

to put tii© profit in their pocket, they should not be allowed
to coins along and say, "We are in a jam,, and now our stock
•i*

instead of selling at a premium, for whatever reason, it. is
selling at a discount, that w© want you, the people whom w®
have dominated for 50 years, w@ want you to agree to let us
out of our tax jam.

We are not going to guarantee that you

won't be dominated tomorrow by a different group, but w® want
you to let. us out of our tax jam.”

Wow, if that is fair, if

that is fair, I am completely wrong and my case is lost.
My cas© is that when people set out for a gain, for
a profit in tills society, they hav© to he prepared to take a
loss.

It5s elementary.

I don't hav® any cases to cite, but

I believe that that's the way the gam© is played.
I think that old cas© in 1922, the International
Radio Telegraph case, I believe that that sets forth in simple
terms and common sons® toms what should b® th© measure of
fairness.

If two strangers war© to agree to a deal where

neither one of them is compelled to make a deal, I believe
that's a fair deal.

This is hot th® case of the man’ sitting

in th© middle of th© Sahara Desert with a jug of water and some

poor guy comes along and

Im

is dying of this st and th©..man with

42
tli© jug of waiter says, 851 want §10,000 for a glass of water.”
Mr. Shapiro, Mr. Edward du Pont, both of them testified that
there was no compulsion, no compulsion on Christiana to merge.
It could go on.

It has gone on for many years, and it can

continue to go on.

It®s not something that has to b© done.

It's not 'that we th® public stockholders of Du Pont ar@ sitting
and these people are grasping for water or economic lif© and
that w© caii simply sit hero and say, "Meet our pries or else

you die.”

They have admitted that they can go on.

So to

say that we are in the strategic bargaining position, w@ could
grab 10 pounds of flesh, I think is unrealistic.

It's

unrealistic.
I think what is more to the point is that th©
Christiana peopl® have been in the driver's seat for 50
years and w© have bean in the rumble seat, and we have been
taken for a rid©.
or a good rid®.

How, I am not saying that it's a bad rid©
But I am saying that her© is an. opportunity

that no one ever dreamed of.

It's an opportunity for us to

get cut of that rumble seat into the front seat# not to talc©
command, not to push Christiana out of th© drivsr's seat, but
simply to be there as an equal and say, "There is plenty in
it for you in this deal, there is tremendous opportunities
for you, Christiana, there are tremendous opportunities for us.
Th© Commission says that Christiana should not have
to pay a high price.

But how do you measure a high pries?

43

I say you measure it by what th©y have had.

They havs had

the control of this corporation for 50 years»
tremendous tax savings.

They are getting

So that just to say it's a high price,

th© high price has to h® related to something.
Thank you, your Honors.
QUESTION

%

May I ask you a question?

Your argument

has focused on th® control relationship between Christiana
and Du Pont.

Let's assume for th© moment that you have a

situation, a merger situation, involving no control element.
Let’s assume that Christiana, instead of owning Du Pont stock,
had owned IBM stock.

The SEC wouldn't hav® any jurisdiction

ov@r th© merger, but you as a stockholder of Du Pont would b©
interested in th© terms of th© merger from th® standpoint of
fairness to Du Pont stockholders.

Let’s assume that th© terms

of th® merger contemplated net asset value as a basis for
th© exchange.

What would you say to that?

Th® only difference would

an exchange determined solely by the net asset value of the
other company’s shares?
MR. COLLINS;
QUESTION:

With Christiana owning some IBM --

IBM# for example.

Everything fch© same

except you don't have a control relationship.
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

No# I probably wouldn't.

You would not.

45
MR. COLLINS:
QUESTION:

I would not.

You would think it a fair merger under

those circumstances.
MR. COLLINS:

I vrould say this, that what, is th©

advaatag© to me in voting for the merger, if I am paying
net asset value?

If Christiana has IBM stock worth so many

dollars, what is there in it for us?

Why should I vote for

it if I am only getting it at net ass©t value?

Why should I

giv© them a deal that I can accomplish by writing a ch@ck
and buying it on th® New York Stock Exchange?

Why should I

do it?
QUESTION:

So you are now saying it would b® unfair

even if there were no holding company situation..
MR. COLLINS:

I can't say that it would be unfair.

I can’t say that it would bs unfair, but I would ask th©
question why should I do it?

I would say this, that as an

economic man, guided by the principles of salf-pr@sarvatl.on
or self-aggrandisement, as you call it, I would say, "What’s
in it for m©?M
QUESTION?

I can understand on® asking that

question, but th© question th® Court would have to answer if
a stockholder brought, a suit, challenging the fairness of the
measure, is whether or not th® terms were fair, not whether
a stockholder should say, "Why should I do it?"
MR. COLLINS:

Let m® answer it this way, your Honor.

46
I go back and I would say, yes, it. would b© fair.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS C. MURTAUGH ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MURTAUGH:
the Courts

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

On the back page cf my brief, almost back,page 70,

is a list of who gets what out of this merger.

There ara

about seven advantages that Christiana shareholders get.

Some

of them are money advantages right on the face of the table;
som® of them ar© tax advantages, tax delay advantages, or
tax avoidance of a billion dollars, as I calculat® it.

But

if you knocked out that tax-free liquidation result, I would
/

still b© against this merger because of the fact that they ar®
getting $41.25, a 37 parcant markup in the value of their
holdings, and because of the fact that we are loosing on
the. floating supply of Du Pont 13 million shams on th@
present 34 million-share floating supply.
against the merger regardless of the terms.

And I would be
In fact, X am

still against the merger regardless of the terms.

But I

don't see the tool by which I can block the merger if they
have the votes

47
Now., th© only thing that w@ can do in that ©vent
is to corns and say., "Compensate us for our coop©ration in
letting you avoid a billion dollars in taxes at th® present
time, letting you have a half-billion markup in the presence
of your holdings, giving you greater liquidity." That is worth
over a billion dollars right them.

What is th® advantage for

Du Pont?
Th® distinct disadvantage, th© detriment which I
fear and which I attempted to get time to put in evidence
was th© market impact argument.

Fifty-six percent of -th®

stock of Christiana is held in on® fiduciary capacity or
another by Wilmington Trust Company as trustee.

Mow, I would

have fo@@n able — in fact, I am able now — to show th®
natur® of those holdings. Some of tham ar© just exclusively
Christiana.

And it just stands to reason under general

trust diversification principles, when they get into a stock
of th© liquidity that Du Pont has, they are going to taka
advantage of that liquidity or they are going to be sued fo>r
lack of diversification.
}

Mow, I participated in the 7-day hearing.

At the

conclusion I asked for a continuance to hav© an opportunity
to put in evidence that would bear on th© question of th®
aptness of my 'contention.

Th® Commission denied that on the

grounds it wasn't relevant, what would happen to th© price
of Du Pont stock was not relevant, and therefor® they

40
disregarded any evidence that was in the record or that might
com© in the record on the question of market impact because
of lack of relevance.

I claim that was pur® error.

But regardless of that, this table of advantages
is just fabulous.

I was da lighted to hear Mr. Fssrber say that

Pspper v. Litton is one of the favorita references of the SEC
because I believe strongly that it not only was a question of
detriment, but it went on to say that the controlling power —
on page 311 — is at all times subject to the equitable
limitation that it may not b© exercised for the aggrandizement,
preference, or advantage of th® fiduciary to the exclusion
or detriment of th© cestui.
Mow, exclusion, or detriment, that's two categories.
W@

are all familiar with th© fact that a fiduciary -makes a

profit out of dealing with his cestui que trust even if it could be
shown that the cestui wasn't disadvantaged as under grave
suspicion of having to kick it back into th© pot.
Mow , the detriment -that is involved here on th®
issue of market impact affects Du Pont as a company.

If

Du Pont wants to acquire a company with -th© us© of its shares
and if th© market has been damag©d by a turnover of these
magnificent holdings ©f Du Pont which will now become marketable,
why, it's going to have to give more shares than it would if
the market was stable as it is now.
really against the merger.

That is on© reason I am

But all 1 can do is take it out in

49
terms .of the merger tarms.

And it's perfectly fair if w@ change

these terms so that w© split the benefit, just «1© cash benefit,
of $450,000, why, we still l©av® them with all these other
benefits.

Their dividend would be neutralised by that.

There

added.

Th© liquidity would ba

Th© tax-free liquidation result would still ba there.

So there is a possibility of damage to Du Pont and to Du Font's
shareholders, but w© can’t explore that unless we hava th©
record complete.
Now, if th® Commission is right that as a matter of
law th© market impact is immaterial, then that point of
detriment can't fo© gone into; then'we only have th© sharing of
benefits.

Th© Commission went, a long way her®.

It said th@r©

is absolutely no benefit to Du Pont except the 1.75 parcent
discount.

They said the dispersion is of no value.

They said

that th© witnesses of prestigious Wall Street houses was of no
value.

They said that they would be better off probably if

Du Pont was controlled by Christiana who would have stockholder
responsibility for making it productive.
Now, I certainly don't want to knock th© stock of
Du Pont, but. it has gone down to 50 percent of what it was 13
years ago, and it’s not a bulwark of th© market, and there is
no reason to assume that it could stand a vast increase in the
potential supply, which is, I mean,the supply actually brought.
to market.

50

Thos® are the principal factors in ray thing.
Now f as a continued argument that the Commission
said that this was an exchange of equivalents, I have treated
that in ray brief, but it's perfectly clear that the Commission
was only paraphrasing their contention, because it says at
first blush there is no problem for Christiana stock is really
already Du Pont stock under another narae.

statement.

So this in essence
That’s merely a

I am reading from Petition, page 9a and 10a.

That is merely a statement.

In fact the whole Commission's

opinion goes to the fact that it isn't the same, that there are
striking disparities with the result that Christiana is
utterly incommensurate and that there is no reason for the
roarger at all except the advantage that Du Pont gets is that
4 cents per share will bs earned on the basis of $7.,33.

That's

the only advantage teat Du Pont gats out of this magnificent
transaction, which is, in my opinion, inexcusable, very damaging,
and so on.
. Now, this is not a liquidation.
free to liquidate.

The parties ar©

They can’t deny that, and they don't have

to com© to the Commission for it.

But the Commission is bound

to follow th© statute under which it operates.

That statute

includes in its preamble, upon the basis of facts disclosed
by the record and th® reports
Section 79 z

Gf

th® SEC mad® pursuant to

of this title — that's found in Appendix A of

51
my brief — such companies, namely,, investment companies,
commonly, customarily invest and trad® in securities issued
by,

and may dominata and control

or otherwise ©ngage in

business in interstate commerce, hav® management of companies
engaged in business and interstate commerce.

In other words,

on® of the features in the preamble was to control investment
companies from taking advantage of affiliates.
Furthermore, section 17(a) — there is no us© going
into the history or picking little bits and pieces from remarks
and cases that weren't contested.

Most of the cases that ar@

referred to generally her© ar© without examination.
that

It says

—• there ar© five, maybe six, categories — the terms of

the proposed transaction, if th® evidence establishes that —
first we hav® to have evidence ; th©

SEC said evidence is

immaterial here bacause net assat value controls —* th© terms
of .the'proposed transaction, including the consideration to bs
paid or received —that indicates a sens© of balance; people
ordinarily pay for som@thi.ng what it is worth — arcs reasonable
and fair and dc not involve everreaching on the part of any
person concerned.
Now, Du Pont is a parson concerned h@r@, and if
Du Pont enters into a deal where it should be getting more money
than it does, more of a consideration than it doss, then it
has been overreached.

Now, that is exactly what the terms of

th© statute says, and th® SEC said.

We will disregard -the

i

52
concept of overreaching th© stockholders of Du Pont because
the entire flavor of th© Act: is so protective of investment
compahy shareholders.

But that flies right in the face of

•the terms of th® statuta as it is written.

There is no need

to go back to a bankruptcy reorganization advisory opinion
years ago to be concerned about this.

Of all the language,

in feh@ bankruptcy reorganization case of about 30 years ago
is the only place that th© principle is stated.

In fact, as

the Court pointed out in footnote 12, X think, to th® opinion,
Covington & Burling stated in its advice to th© financial
advisers, ”Xn general the Commission examines proposed
transactions and merger terms affecting common stock.

Passing

on merger terms affecting common stock, the Commission has
looked to such factors as

comparative earnings, dividends,

market values, and net asset values, including cidjustments
for potential taxes arising from unrealized capital gains in
portfolio securities and tha tax benefits resulting from tax
loss carried forward."

No singl© factor has been considered

determinatives.
Now th® SEC took a different view, says you donst
have to have any facts, just show us that you are getting th©
net asset value, and we will forget whether it is fair and
reasonable or overreaching.

Now, it is overreaching in any

normal business transaction, it is overreaching if a parson
can get a bigger price than he otherwise could if h© was

53
independent..

Now, there can't be any overreaching by Da Pont

because it is the controlled person.
dominating person.

Christiana is the

It’s utter fantasy to say that it is

somehow exercising control or extracting.

It can't extract.

It's perfectly helpless, and it can't do any harm to
Christiana either.

But it isn't a transaction that is a

business transaction that a businessman would make, even if
he really wanted the merger and h© laid out th@s© advantages.
If Christiana stock war© nonvoting, why, no Du Pont manager
would ever sponsor a transaction like this even if the
equities wsr© the same.
So, getting back to Pappar v. Litton again, which I
hope still remains intact after ©very writing of whatever
opinions ar© written here, th© idea of a merger is a consentual
transaction.

When you deal with consentual transactions, you

deal with things that people have to agree to.

If the

agreement is meaningless because its controlled, then you have
written out the section of the Act -that says there shall be no
overreaching.
QUESTION;

Mr. Murtaugh, this transaction has not.

That is

MR. MURTAUGHs
QUESTIONs

That is correct, yes.

So w® don't know what'views the minority

shareholders might, have with respect to this.

54
MR. MURTAUGH:

Yes, I think we do.

With Christiana

having 28 percent of the stock and with Christiana transferring
control to the managers of the company who are the negotiators
of the transaction and who, by the way, testified before th©
SEC that they felt they represented all th© shareholders of
Du Pont, including th® Christiana shareholders, why, it's
perfectly obvious that they will be able t© swing enough
votes with th© proxy machinery and the 28 percent to control
th© thing.

That is th© reason you have to com® in in protection

of the minority in this forum.

That is th© reason that w© are

here.
