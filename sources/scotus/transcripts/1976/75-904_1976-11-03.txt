MRc

CHIEF JUSTICE

BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-904, Brunswick Corporation against Pueblo.
Mr, Segal, you may proceed whenever you’re ready»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD G, SEGAL, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, SEGAL:

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
I rise to address the Court in a case which has
aptly been called

by the Court of Appeals, a case of first

impression nationally, one which explores largely virgin anti­
trust territory, and one which involves, for the first time
since the Clayton Act was passed, that we have a money damage
verdict under that Act»
I should like to emphasize

initially that what we

are here for is to argue legal issues, not facts? that we are
here to argue the subject of damages, as governed by those
legal issues»
There are just a few uncontroverted facts, salient
facts, that I think are necessary just as background,
Th® plaintiff, the plaintiffs are subsidiaries of Treadway
Companies, which is a chain of bowling centers that operates
in the United States, and each subsidiary operates a different
bowling center,
Brunswick Corporation is one of tee two largest

4

manufacturers and distributors of bowling equipment in the
United States, and is the defendant, the petitioner here»
I should tell Your Honors that the reason the litiga­
tion arose is that prior to 1964 the bowling industry ~
really prior to the early 1960*s — was in a boom period, and
the bottom fell out of it in around 1963, 1964.

There was a

precipitous decline, and the petitioner found itself on the
verge of bankruptcy.

It had borrowed $300 million because,

in selling to the bowling centers, the plaintiffs here, it
did that on conditional sales, with a down payment, but with
a very substantial portion of it, major portion of the money,
being on a not® basis„
And it had $400 million outstanding with these
bowling centers, of which $100 million was more than 90 days5
delinquent.
What it needed was soma way to get cash flow.

It

appraised all of those centers, it selected those which it
thought would give it cash flow.
to pay.

It first tried to get -them

It then tried to dispose of them, dispose of the

equipment, as the Court of Appeals carefully outlines.
Failing all that, it took over these stations to operate
them, where it thought they would create a cash flow.
And what we have involved here are three local
markets, in which it took over stations.

Two of them, it took

over a station that was on© of the smaller bowling stations,

5

one of them it found that — bowling centers, I should say to
Your Honors

it found that it simply couldn’t get the cash

flow* And after a few years it just closed it down and left
the markat» That was Poughkeepsie»
The others , it remained in the market.
The complaint of the plaintiffs is that it should not
have taken over those stations.

That if it had not done so,

those stations — I9m calling them stations, those bowling
centers would have folded.
And, you can tell, Your Honors, I don't do much.
bowling,
Those bowling centers would have folded.

And if they

had folded, the plaintiffs would have shared with the other
centers in each of these three local markets, with the business
that, would thus have been released.
That is the entire theory of the case.
Now, Your Honors, there are just, for some reason —
I guess I know the reason — -the respondente endeavor to
change that theory hare.

And I therefore read Your Honors just

what the Court of Appeals said.

It happens to be at page 25a

of the Petition for toe Writ of Certiorari,
6,The thrust of plaintiff's Section 4 theory was
that damages were to b® computed by first assuming that ©ach
Bruns wick--acquired center would have closed down at the moment
of takeover.”

In other words, no one else could hav® taken

6
over»

They were just closed down,
C1... but for the takeover and then by projecting

what portion of the closed center's business would have been
captured by Treadway's centers.M
Now* I should say to Your Honors that in these three
markets there is no showing of any kind that the plaintiffs
had any less share of the business, or that the defendant got
any more share of the business during the eight years, from
the time of takeover until the time of the second trial.
There's no showing that there was any difference in
facilitieso

Indeed, the only showing was that three of the

independent centers increased their facilities.

No showing

except that the defendant gave up completely the Poughkeepsie
market, gave up one of its bowling centers in the Paramus
market. The three markets are Paramus in Mew Jersey? Poughkeepsie
in New York, and Pueblo in Colorado.
I say there's no showing of any of those because the
case proceeded on the rather simple ground.
Now, at the trial there were two — -there was a charge
of violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and the plaintiff
withdrew that.
There was a charge of a violation of Section 2 of the
Sherman Act, and -this is important, because -the judge, in
charging the jury, took up every bit of evidence of what was
called behavioral evidence, that -the plaintiffs offered? every

7

shred of it? and gave it to the jury arid said:
section 2 Sherman Act charge»

Tills is for the

And if you find these idlings are

true* then you give a verdict to the defendant

to the

plaintiffs»
And the jury brought in a verdict for the defendant
on -the section 2 Sherman Act.
Nov/, when it came to the Clayton Act? Section 7,
there the court restricted his charge to a structural charge.
H© said;

The defendant admits that it's No. 1 in bowling? it's

the largest manufacturer in bowling, and it serves as a banker
for those to whom it sells.
And finally, the court said, that the percentage of
bowling center facilities in a local market that Brunswick
obtained by the mere act of taking over a bowling center, you
find that that was more than an insubstantial share ~ were the
trial court's words — if you find that was more than an
insubstantial share, say, beyond ten percent or fifteen percent,
then you may find a verdict for the plaintiffs.
Now, that was the only thing that was

* that's before

this Court, the only thing on question one, the only tiling that
was given

to the jury, when everything else had found for the

defendant -- my friend on the other side has some 30 pages of
facts.

He talks of findings by the jury.
Well, I can’t understand — if there were findings,

they were for the defendants.

But since -this is a law case,

8
Your Honor, I don't argue anything but the facte,

I hav©

read Your Honors the
QUESTION:

Did the jury give a general verdict,

Mr, Segal, or —
MR, SEGAL:

A general verdict for the defendant in

Section 2, Sherman Act, and a verdict, of something under $7
million after trebling under the Clayton Act,
QUESTION: But there were no special interrogatories?
MR, SEGAL:
QUESTION:

None whatever, Your Honor,
Mr, Segal, how about — was there a

prayer for equitable relief?
MR, SEGAL:

There was, YOur Honor,

QUESTION:

And on the Section 7 case?

MR, SEGAL:

On the -- there was a general prayer for

equitable relief, and —>
QUESTION:

Were there proceedings held by the judge

going to equitable relief?
MR, SEGAL:

Well, he curiously' relied on the jury's

ve rdi ct, and -*»
QUESTION:

Well, but did he give some equitable

relief?
MR, SEGAL:
QUESTION:
MR, SEGAL:

He gave

he granted divestiture,

Yes?
And the Court of Appeals --

QUESTION: And in the process, did he mat© some

9

findings?
MR® SEGAL:

I would

say no* Your Honor- because* says

the Court of Appeals* that one of his errors was that h@ relied
primarily on what he regarded as the finding of the jury* and
the findings of the jury could only ba in Section 2* and Section
2 is decided for the defendants®
QUESTIONS

Well* he said a lot of things about the

MR® SEGAL:

He said a lot of things about the facts0

facts»

QUESTION: So it may be that —
MR® SEGAL;

That9s one of the reasons he was reversed*

Your Honor®
QUESTION:

Yes®

Well* but it's also one of the --

it's also* maybe* on© of the reasons that you just can't
ignore them®
MR® SEGAL: But w© aren't here on that* Your Honor®
QUESTION: All right® All right®
MR® SEGAL:

Your Honors had two petitions®

One

consisted of two solid pages of questions by —
QUESTION:

On the question that you raise here* we

must assume that there has — we judge this ease on the
assumption that there was a violation of Section 7®
MR® SEGAL:

I am willing to assume* for the purposes

of argument* and to proceed
QUESTION;

Yes

10

MR. SEGAL %

— tliat there was a violation of

Section —
QUESTION:

And your arguments take up from that

point.
MR. SEGAL:
QUESTION:
MR. SEGAL:
QUESTION:

Take up from that point.
Right.
Now, it so happens that Your Honors ~
Mr. Segal# you male© that assumption with

respect to the second question as well as the first?
MR* SEGAL:
QUESTION:

I make that assumption —
Th© second question is the failing

company defense argument.
MR. SEGAL:

The second question# Your Honor# we say

there can't be liability because of the failing company.
I am now addressing myself to question one.
QUESTION: For that question only you assume there is
a violation?
MR. SEGAL:

No# no.

Now# my friend objects to -the fact that in making
our concession# sine© the court had said that there was enough
for the jury to find violation# and we're sending it back to
that# we assume that.

My friend seems to think that that makes

a mighty difference and opens up the whole question# and there­
fore my direct answer is the answer I gave Mr. Justice White#
that we are perfectly willing to assume# for purposes of argu-

11
merit in this case, that, the acquisition by the defendant —
the acquisitions — consfcitufeed a violation of Section 7 for
th© purposes of the first Act,
QUESTIONS And I take it you are also willing to
assume that th® Act which was a violation* namely the acquis1™
felon* also caused some damages?
MRa SEGAL:

No»

QUESTION:

Just the very Act,

MR, SEGAL:

No,

Just the very Act ~

And that I should make clear right

now to Your Honor* —
QUESTION:

Well* l know* hut I thought your argument

was that, there wasn't any

that whatever damage was caused

was not, caused by any lessening of competition,
MR, SEGAL: The entire damage theory* the entire damage
theory in this case* a3 said by the Court of Appeals succinctly*
had a single line of damages.
QUESTION:
MR, SEGAL:
that the trial

Right,
Indeed* their testimony was so identical

judge charged:

believe all five,

There were five witnesses,

If you believe one* you

must

Which is a curious charge* but they really

were identical.
And tiie jury took without a dollar change whan
said was the minimum loss of — what?

Of what th© plaintiffs

would have had if* instead of taking over th® station* they
had given up the station.

12
QUESTION:

The bowling alleys *

MR® SEGAL:

Yes, bowling alleys*

QUESTION: This isn’t CBS*
MR* SEGAL:

Bowling alleys — yes*

That's my

next case. Your Honor*
[Laughter* ]
MR* SEGAL:

It proves I prepare in advance, anyway*

The sol© evidence in this cas© is what I have just
said*
QUESTION:

Mr* Segal, just to elaborate on Justice

White's question a little bit, there is at least "but for”
causation here, isn't there?

In the sens© of acquisition by

Brunswick and loss of profits on behalf of the plaintiffs *
. MR* SEGAL:

Mr* Justice Rehnquisfc, tie whole thing

is a Mbut for” *
QUESTION: Well,, but isn't there at least that, so
you argue from there, rather than argue whether there was
"but for” —
MR* SEGAL:

That's what w© are here for*

The court

held that mere presence, mere presence, without any lessening,
let alone substantial lessening of competition, would be
enough *
QUESTION:

But if it's mere presence that was the

violation ~MR* SEGAL:

Mere presence was the violation*

13
QUESTIONS

All right.

But you’re willing to assume

that all the damage — that 'there was damage from mere
presence , but that, that is not. what damage has to flow from.
You’re saying there must: be —
MR, SEGAL:
QUESTION:

Preciselye Your Honor,
— some additional proof of lessening of

competition,
MR, SEGAL:
QUESTION:

Yes,
Do you equate mere presence with mere

survival?
MR, SEGAL:

Yes, Your Honor, in this case,

QUESTION: The survi\ral of these failing alleys,
bowling alleys,
MR, SEGAL:

In this case, the whole case of the

plaintiffs is premised on the fact that 'the bowling centers
would have gone out of business if we had not taken them over,
and therefore, if we had not taken them over, the business
would have been distributed.
In other words, what he is complaining about, Your
Honors, is th© maintenance of comp@ti.tion, not the destruction
of competition,
QUESTION;

Th© question put to you by Mr, Justice

Whit® used the word "damage" resulting from th© fact that ~*
or th© presence of Brunswick,

Is it not possible to say that

damage is an inappropriate word?

It has been suggested in the

14
briefs that the plaintiffs below were seeking a windfall that
would result to them, as a result of the elimination of
competition»

Is there a distinction between -that sort of

economic gain and damages sustained as the result of a wrong?
MR. SEGAL-:

Precisely» Your Honor,,

position,- and there
this positions

We take the

every case one reads is consonant with

that damage has to be something which, under

this Act, flows from either a reduction in competition or a
creation of monopoly»

And -that what is her® called damage is

just the result of ordinary competition*

If any other — if

the original people had stood there, the original operators,
we would have had the same picture.
If we had forgiven the debt, which, here for the first
time, my friend says we could have done,

if w© had said,

"All right, you can owe us $400 million and we won't collect'4,
they would have had the same presence as they have now, they
•

1

would have had the sam® business, because there is not a shred
of evidence, no showing that v?e got any more business after
w© came than our predecessors had.

There is no showing we got

any more business than anyone else would have had.
And the only increases in facilities are by others,
not by us, w© have closed down.

We have not increased.

There

is not a shred of evidence, X say without any question whatever,
no showing of any kind
QUESTION:

that we gained anything.

Mr. Segal, let me put what I understand to

15

be your opponent’s strongest case against you* and see if —
make sure you address it directly»
As 1 understand their theory* it is that the
acquisition was unlawful* which you assume for purposes of
question one* —
MR. SEGAL:
QUESTION:

Right.
— and that* therefor©* the presence in th©

market was unlawful* which you assume —
MR. SEGAL:

May I interrupt Your Honor?

The

presence not of Brunswick* the presence of the station* the
presence of

fcha center.

QUESTION:

Correct.

Which they say would not be

there but for the violation of law.
And that therefore -there's a continuing violation.
They say also that the presence caused injury to them* even
though it may not have caused any adverse impact on competition.
And they then say that the statute provides that they
can recover for an. injury which flow — injury to business or
property flowing from a violation of law.
I understand it* is:

Your response* as

No* you can only recover for an injury if

it is also an injury which causes an adverse impact on
competition.
MR. SEGAL:

Correct.

QUESTION: And what is the support for that?
MR. SEGAL:

The support for that ~ well* this Court

IS

has never had a case involving damages»

But its pronouncements

in the non-damage in the government and fch© equity cases have
been used by cases like Gottesman in the Second Circuit# where
they have now said# and. pretty uniformly — originally there
was a big split — that you can recover.
All of -them say# however# -that the only tiling you can
recover —* and I say with no hesitancy whatever# that there
is not a case that doesn't say this — that the only thing you
can recover for is damages flowing from either the lessening
of competition or the creation of monopoly•

That when the

threat ripens into reality# and you can prove that flowing
out of the reality is a damage to you# then you can recover,.
And that is the only place you can recover»
The difference# Mr. Justice Powell# -that you made is
precisely the difference that the cases make.
QUESTIONs

Mr. Segal# with those cases in which one

could assume# for purpose of decision — and I haven’t read
them all — that there was an injury in fact# but yet no
damage flowing from an injury to competition?
MR. SEGALs Well# that was the ultimate holding#
because this is the first case of a, money damage.
In each case# when it came back# the court said:
Oh# well# you’re just saying you’re injured by the competition?
you're not proving that you’re injured by a lessening of
•competition# or by a creation of monopoly.

So# though we have

17
said th@ rule is you can recover# you have not proved any more
than has been proved here.

You have not given us the prerequisite

for a damage verdict? namely# damage flowing from a lessening
of competition# which I will us® for both terms.
QUESTION*
as I should have.

I*m not sura I made my question as precise
Did they assume, in so saying# 'that there

was an injury flowing from the violation# even though not
flowing from an injury to competition?
MR. SEGALz
QUESTIONs

X can't say that expressly# but ~
You see# that's a vary narrow# narrow

question here#as I understand it.
MR. SEGAL:

«— in ©very case# Your Honor# you had that

as a fact.
QUESTION* That there was injury in fact?
MR. SEGALs Sure# or it wouldn't have arisen.
QUESTION*
QUESTION*

I see.
Well# in this case# do I understand it# Mr.

Segal# that you argue. -- that you concede# at least arguendo#
that had there been a showing here of sales below cost by your
deep pocket client# at the bowling alleys acquired and at issue
in this case# that that would have laid the foundation for
vulnerability for a monetary damage?
MR. SEGAL:

If ‘that resulted in a diminution of

th® level of competition.
QUESTION:

Yes.

And so that your answer would be

18
yes, wouldn't it?
MR. SEGAL:

Yes.

Yes.

On our assumption there

would have to b@ damages, if that were true.
QUESTION: Right.

Was there evidence of sales below

cost here?
MR. SEGAL:

No evidence of sales below cost.

There

was — oh, there ar© 30 or 40 pages — there were things that,
for instance, —
QUESTION: Trips to Europe, and so on?
MR. SEGAL:

Yes.

Now, that was trips of two people

for the whole United States.
QUESTION:
MR. SEGAL:

Unh-hunh.
We demonstrated —

QUESTION: Cutrate for groups and so on?
MR. SEGAL:

No, not cutrate.

There was only one

charge of cutrate in the record, and that was that in order to
attract youngsters in the summer, we gave them a special rate
in tee mornings, when youngsters normally didn’t play.
But our total promotion cost was under three percent,
whereas the plaintiffs’ total promotion cost was three percent.
QUESTION:
MR. SEGAL:

But there was evidence, wasn’t there, ~
Oh, yes, there was evidence -- all

that was under Section —
QUESTION:
people —

— that those four plaintiffs were sales

19

MR. SEGAL;

— all that was Section 2, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

Yes, but tli© jury's verdict on Section 2

might, have been premised upon the proposition that there was
no intenfcr that there were in fact sales below cost* but there
was no intent.
MR. SEGAL; But of course the court said that's not
evidence for you on Section 7.
'file court said;

You. must find these three propositions,

the three -that I've outlined to Your Honor.

And that's said

by the Court of Appeals , and that is categorically the case., as
one" reads the charge of the jury.
QUESTION; But if, as I understand you now concede,
that a case for monetary damages resulting from a violation of
Section 7 in these circumstances, could be based upon sales
below cost by the bowling alleys acquired by your client,
then shouldn't th® plaintiff, ©van if the Court of Appeals
theory is wholly wrong, shouldn't he b® entitled to prove
that on a new trial?
MR. SEGAL:

Provided that the sales below cost have

resulted in what there is no showing of her®, a lessening of
competition.
QUESTION;
isn’t it?

Per se.

Well, that is unfair competition then,
Sales below cost by a monopolist?

MR. SEGAL;
business, Your Honor.

Well, sales below cost may get you no
You’ve got to show it got me something.

20

Sales below cost: will show the violation but not the
damage„
QUESTION: Well, then* shouldn't the plaintiffs be
entitled, on a new trial, even assuming you’re quite right
about how

erroneous the Court of Appeals was, to show sales

below cost and resulting damages?
MR® SEGAL %

Right0

But in this cas© — and I

emphasise this once before I leave it — there is not a shred
of effort by any of the five witnesses on damages to show
that -there was any damage from predatory conduct.

The plaintiffs

decided that -the place where they could get real money here
was millions of dollars, if they could establish that because
the centers were continued in operation instead of closed,
they were entitled to what they lost.
That's what they gambled on.

And I would stake what­

ever reputation I may have that there’s not a shrad of evidence
of damage on any other point in this case.
Now, Your Honor, I think I've said enough about
question on®, as my time runs on, and I will talk, therefore,
about question two,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have seven minutes

left, including your rebuttal, Mr, Segal,
MR, SEGAL:

Then I will be very brief, because I would

like a little,time for rebuttal,
Th© simple question here is:

Obviously the law is,

21
that if what the defendant took over in each case was a failing
company project* then the violation of Si© antitrust law does
not exist* whether it's Section 2 or Section 7®
We proceeded on the postulate that since the entire
theory of the plaintiffs was that if we hadn't- taken over the
centers would hav© had to fold* they would have had to go out
of existence*
I will just quote to you th® testimony of their
witnesses on damages*

One of them said ~ he was asked:

What was th® assumption on which he gave these figures* which
th© jury adopted without change*
He said:
I'm sorry»

Well* that the centers would have — no*

He said: Well* the centers would hav® fallen

of their own economic weight if Brunswick didn’t prop them up*
And I read from the brief of the Respondente in the
Court of Appeals.

He said that these centers were marginal and

sub-marginal bowling centers that i^ould otherwise have folded
if it weren't for what we put into them*
So —
QUESTION:

Mr® Segal* would you comment either ~

you can save it for rebuttal if you want to saw the time —
but X5d be- interested in your response to their argument that
the failing company defense really does not or should not
apply in th® vertical acquisition situation®
MR® SEGAL:

Oh* Your Honor* on that* they ar© just

22

dead wrong,
1 would say to Your Honors that they cite the U»S_»_
Steel case* and* Your Honor,
QUESTIONs
MR» SEGAL:

U*S» Steel case?
Yes»

And in that case it was sent back

for the sol© purpose of whether the facts substantiated the
failing company doctrine, and that was vertical»
In the cases iduat have been ~~ Brown Shoe»

Drown Shoe

gave 4h© entire congressional debate to show that the amendments
of 1950 were intended to apply to vertical companies»
And I say to Your Honors here again there isn’t a cas®
that denies it in a vertical case»
QUESTION: Well, let me try and put the question a
little more forcefully, because I want to be sure I get your
thinking on it*
It seems to me that the theory of -fch© failing company
defense is that in a horizontal acquisition it doesn’t make
much difference whether it goes out of business or it's
acquired by a competitor, because you end up with the same kind
of market» But in the vertical acquisition case, you have
really a kind of a different theory, in the Procter £ Gamble
case in the law, that's a deep pocket getting into a market
and presumably changing things that would otherwise exist»
Now, on© may question the wisdom of Procter s Gamble,
but it's part of -the law*

23
Now, how does the theory of the failing company
defense fit when the vice is adding a deep pocket compatitor
to the market that wouldn't otherwise be there?
MRo SEGAL? Well, Your Honor, again, the question is?
deep pocket may be a violation, it may be that, in a government
suit, it can be enjoined»

It may be that it can be divested»

But the Act is categorically specific in applying to vertical,
■

as the Brown Shoe shows, that the —
QUESTION?

I know -the Act does, but doss the failing

company defense

does the theory of the failing company

defense fit her©?

That's all —

MR» SEGAL?

Oh, both those cases apply it* The

debate is on the failing company in both of them»
QUESTION?
MR. SEGAL?

I seea
And they make it categorically so, and I

think that's so, because whether it's vertical or not the
theory is that they don't want a company which would disappear
from the market to disappear»

And if the only alternative is

for X to take it over. Congress has decided, as a matter of
antitrust policy, that it prefers to have that entity remain
in the market rather than to haw it disappear» And therefor®,
it, says if it's a failing company you can take it over»
Now, the only issue here was ~ not whether it would
apply, actually? the issue was, had we proved it.
And, very simply, this is our belief, there can be

24

no doubt that the theory on which -'this case

was tried and on

which damages were sought was that if we didn't take them over,
they would have withered and died and left the markets
Otherwise there's no damage theory at all»
Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals felt

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM A. HOFFMANN, ESQ.,
ON BEHAI,F OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. HOFFMANNj

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas©

the Courts
Mr. Segal started his remarks by referring to the
uncontroverted facts.

I hop© I may b© allowed to have your

indulgence for, say, five minutes of ray time to controvert
the unconfcroverted facts.
I hop© also that if X fail to controvert some of them,
in the course of this argument before this Court — that ray
failure to do that will not. be considered an admission.
We have a case, Your Honor, of vertical integration.
What has happened is that the largest bowling supplier, the
maker of the equipment used by bowling center operations,
integrated forward into th© bowling operation business.

It

made the pinsatters, which are th® most costly equipment that
a bowling center has to us® and to buy, and it made -the lanes.
It represents, for each center who buys from Brunswick,
perhaps $700,000 of investment, if it’s a 40-lane center, which
is not an uncommon size.
There we start, Your Honor, and comes the 1960's,
and my adversary would have you believe that in the 1960's
Brunswick tottered on the edge of bankruptcy.

Ho such thing,

not even in the worst years which preceded its decision to go
into the bowling center operation business, x^as it anywheres

25

near that»

Indeed, in its worst years, its collections

received from bowling center debtors were $8? million and more?
taking away interest on debts and th© like, and this is even
broken down to the bowling operation, you have a balance
on the plus side of cash flow of $32 million,.
This is the giant which Judge Gibbons referred to
coming into the land of the pygmies , which ar© the bowling
center operators in debt to Brunswick itself»
Now, if we cast th® case into an abstract, theoretical
case, about:
presence?

Is it all right to recover damages for mere

Which is fee language —» and, forgive me, Your

Honor’s, I think it’s somewhat unfortunate language, which is
in the first question's premise®
If you cast it in so general a way, than you discount
the whole factual showing of what this case is about»

A twice-

tried case, a ten-year case, a case in which Judge Whipple
made many findings about predatory practices, a case in which,
unlike my adversary's representation to the Court, there were
independent findings made by Judge Whipple on the equity side,
in addition to the findings made by the jury itself»

Now# we had not only Judga Whipple making findings
of practices which would be not possible for any competitor
of the plaintiffs# other than an integrated supplier and
bowling center operator# but we also had the Third Circuit
endorsing -these findings and

saying that there was sufficient

evidence to present to the jury on the latter part of Section 7C
That is to say# on a substantial lessening of
competition# and a tendency to create a monopoly®
Now, if Your Honor please# facts is facts# as Mrs®

The case is one which bristles with such

QUESTIONs

Mr. Hoffmann# just so I understand what

your position is hare# suppose that the Court of Appeals had
expressly said# or suppose w© read the record as indicating
this f that there was a violation here in the sense that there
might be a lessening of competition in -the future# or a
tendency to create a monopoly# but that the record is barren
of any actual impact on competition®

But# nevertheless# there

is a violation of Section 7®
But -- and -the Court of Appeals sayss

nevertheless#

damages is recoverable from the mere fact of the violation.
MR® HOFFMANN!

My position is that is wisdom* Your

The —
QUESTIONs

You say the damages «—

MR. HOFFMANs

I say that damages may be* and I would

like to explain that if I may* Mr. Justice White.
The presence itself is not something which happened
in one split instant of tint® when Brunswick acquired a bowling
center.

The presence is something which started that way* and

that was illegal on th® premise which Mr. Segal accepts* and
which is in your questions.
And it continues.

The retention* the holding on.

This Court has said* in so many words, in IT&T and Continental
Baking* is equally acquisition.

An acquisition itself is what

is prohibited under Section 7* providing tha whole statute is
satisfied.

Providing also there is the necessary tenancy

effect.
Now* there’s no magic in probability as opposed to
established lessening in competition.

If th© tort is th©

acqusition* and if th® plaintiff can show damages causal from
that tort* then he satisfies* it seems to m®* th® normal test
for damages.
And may I suggest -that here* Your Honor* th®
acquisition itself is contaminated* not just because it is an
acquisition* but because tha trial court and th© Third Circuit
agreed fait that it; was wrong to bring into those small markets

29

the pygmies referred to by Judge Gibbons.» the integrated
strength of the Brunswick Corporation,
That is vividly illustrated by the circumstance that
it is a creditor and all these fellows were its debtors, or
at least half of them,

Brunswick was Ho. 1, but -they had a

sizable competitor in AMP, which, incidentally, the Third
Circuit noted, did not see fit to go forward and integrate in
competition with its own customers.
So this acquisition is wrong because it brings into
this market the power of Brunswick®
QUESTION s Do you know of any cases that would support
a recovery of damages on the premise that you can recover
damages just from the violation itself, without any proof of
injury to competition?
MR. HOFFMANNS
QUESTIONS

Your Honor, this is —
This is a new question.

MR. HOFFMANNs — this is what is called a new question
in this case, but I think we have many analogies to cases
involving status.
I was about to say the status here is an unlawful
status of Brunswick in these three small markets.

It had no

business being -there.
When the fox goes into the hen house, it's bad for
him to be there from the first — we don’t have to wait for -the
fanner to rout him out with a shotgun.

30
So it's this status* Your Honor* which I think is
wrong.

It may not apply to every acquisition* but it seems to

me it applies to -the acquisitions here.
And I’d like to break down what happened* because I
think this is critical to the first question.
Brunswick had many thousands of pinsetters out on the
installment plan, Brunswick

sold them under conditional bills

of sale* and with a right to foreclose on the property in the
©vent of nonpayment.
What Brunswick did was* in most instances* when it was
dissatisfied that it couldn* t get paid* was to repossess both
the pinsetters * which are automatic equipment for setting up
the pins in an alley* and without which* today* there’s almost
no bowling done — both the pinsetters and the lanes* which are
thin veneer wood* sitting on a cement base* and which are
easily removable.
/

They removed them* and resold them.
Thus* Step on© is Brunswick exercised a choice.
Once it decided to repossess those pinsetters and lanes* the
bowling center* as a practical matter, could not. longer functioni
This isn’t a cas© where the market necessarily put
out one of the weak competitors.

Brunswick put out of business

its own customer* by deciding to go this route.
QUESTION:

QUESTION;

Well; but if it were just a bank and not

a manufacturer- would there be something illegal about their
foreclosing?
MRS HOFFMANs

No* if it stayed in the banking business,,

certainly not® But if* as a bank, it decided to foreclose on a
delinquent creditor, in order now to take over its business
and go into a different market, I would submit, yes, there is
something wrong with that®
You see,
QUESTION;

Mr» Hoffmann, along that line, let’s asstime

for the moment that instead of the Brunswick Corporation
acquiring th© bowling centers, they had been acquired by
another great national corporation ~ you name it;
Motors or IBM

General

that had an even deeper pocket, and mak© all

of the other factual assumptions that you make in this case,
would you se© any distinction?
MR® HOFFMANNs

Your Honor, there’s a shifting thSn

of the nature of the power which is brought into th® market®
I could conceive of a situation in which one of the world’s
biggest corporations went into the bowling center operating
business without any potential of impact of lessening of
competition, in which case, if that potential wasn"1 there,
even the subjunctive language of th© statute that it may

32
substantially lessen or tend to create a monopoly, even that
language would not be satisfied, and thus there would be no
— excuse me?
QUESTION:

But if —• if one of these other giants

acquired these centers, it would certainly have the financial
resources to do th® things that you fear, that Brunswick has
dona or will do? would it not?
What difference would it make whether —
MR. HOFFMANN:

Well, it could convert money into

power, and if it converted money into power, then certainly
th® case becomes similar.
QUESTION:

But the point I —

MR0 HOFFMANN:

Your Honor, I evaded your question —

QUESTION: The point I am leading up to make, Mr.
Hoffmann:

Isn’t your complaint really that this is a

conglomerate hyp® merger and not a vertical merger, in th®
normal sens©?

The parties normally in a vertical merger ar©

the competitors of the acquiring company that dries up the
elastomers 0
But here —» what’s the other company in this business?
QUESTION:

AMF.

MR0 HOFFMAN:
QUESTION:
MR. HOFFMANN:

Your Honor, the horizontal impact
Yes, AMF is not complaining.
The horizontal impact is felt th©

moment Brunswick becomes a bowling center proprietor.

Then

33

it is the horisontal competitor of these other bowling
proprietors in the same competitive market,

And it’s then

that this power, of which w® complain, comes into play»
Bat 1 wanted to, if I may, break down this acquisition
into two steps.
foreclosure.

The first I describe as being in effect -the

The second is the choice made by Brunswick,

which was to run the center as a bowling center.

The bowling

center consists of more than just the lanes and the automatic
pinsefcfcars,

There are liquor licenses, restaurants, nurseries

involved, a big parking lot, and a piece of real estate, and
so on, to make a bowling center and good will as well,
Brunswick decided to do it that way.
Now, this isn*t, then, a case where we8re confronted
with what happened in the market,

Brunswick could have for-

born on the debt, and the record has much evidence -that whan
it chose to do so, it did that.
years,

It did that in San Juan for

It did that in Jacksonville, Florida, and elsewhere.

It just made more favorable arrangements with the debtors,
because, I suppose, it thought that in this way it had some
future prospect of being paid in full for what it had sold.
So that was a choice which it didn't make in this
ins fcance,
QUESTIONi

Mr, Hoffmann, in your view, could Bruns­

wick, without actually foreclosing but continuing to be a
larger and larger partner of a particular alley, and perhaps

34

acquiring more and more dominance of its policy? could your
client eventually have had a cause of action against it, even
though it hadn't formally taken over title to the placa?
MR, HOFFMANN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I find that a

difficult question, because, without knowing the methods used
to accomplish that, I wouldn’t know? whether we couldn't find
that it had run afoul of the law.

It might very well, if not

having engaged in an acquisition, run afoul of Section 2 or
Section 1 as i^ell of the Sherman Act.
You know, this is really a clash of policy, it seems
to me.

Mr. HOffmann, my problem is that by taking

QUESTION:

Or forbear? make it easier to pay.
Would you hav© any complaint?

MR. HOFFMANN:

No, we couldn’t hav© a complaint

unless we were in that competitive market, and we were differ©ntly treated.

Then I think we might well have a complaint.

Indeed, we had an aspect of this case that involved that, which
was ultimately — we ultimately lost on.

Well, what's the difference •»»* well now,

just exactly what was the difference?

The same bowling alley

would run — right?
MR* HOFFMANNs

Yes„

QUESTION; And now it's running solely because your
complaint is Brunswick is running it*
MR* HOFFMANNs
QUESTION;

Yes.

And what's the difference?

What happened

when Brunswick took it over?
MR* HOFFMANN;

Most eloquently, if Your Honors

would be good enough to just look at the Appendix to our brief,
it answers, I think, this question as well as a question which
Mr* Segal answered, about selling below cost*
I have an Appendix her©, Appendix A, it's la attached
to this brief of the Respondents, this blue, brief*

This is

taken from toe records of Brunswick, and it shows how these
centers were run.
If you would look at the first line,from '65 through
'68, Belmont, all at a loss each year.

Same from '69 through

36
570* then a small profit in 171 and in 5 72»
We also highlight an. aspect of the case which pointed
to how much it would be in the hands of an independent
proprietor,, using testimony which showed that they had at
least a. differential of $2*000 a lane advantage* because they
didn't pay themselves for their machines.

They didn't

the

cost of annual payment and interest mad® this $2*000 differential.
But* in any case* they ran these centers* as you see*
year after year* at a loss,

Dutchess* they ran it at a loss

until finally they got tired of it* and stopped running it
at all»
Wow. Interstate was run only for the first year at a
loss* and you would have thought that the enemy troops had
%

marched on City Hall* if you read the Reply Brief of my
adversary* about that circumstance* because he says* well* w©
were misrepresenting to the court -that it was run at a loss»
And Fair Lawn is one center* one of a number of
centers in the Parramus market* where in fact a profit yield

took place»
But. as your eye goes down, the page* you see there are
others there* Ten-Pin-on-the-Mall* the one closest to our
center in Parramus * it was run at a loss»

Lodi* run at a loss,

Now* sir* that's an answer to the question about
price* as well»

If

the deep pocket runs centers for five

years at a loss* that means the price wasn’t sufficient to

yield a profit, and it means that, for one reason or another,
— and I’m not trying to argue the Section 2 aspects of the
case —*
QUESTION;

Mr. Hoffmann, I was just trying to recall

the brief, does the record show that these were actual
losses, or are these computed losses based on an assumption
that if they had paid —»
MR» HOFFMAN;

These are losses just simply derived,

QUESTION:

It doesn’t make an assumption as to paying

interest that the independents had to pay, or some tiling like

MR. HOFFMANNs

Yes, sir.

QUESTION? But isn’t it critical to your case, in
proving your damages , that these centers were not healthy

MR. HOFFMANN? Well, if Your Honor please, the thing

to do*

Right.

MR. HOFFMANNs

But we also carried out businesses

QUESTIONS

Nov7* what is the legal significance of

the facts set forth in this Append.tr, namely, as you contendf
that the companies taken over by Brunswick lost money? what
difference does that make?

What's this

I just don’t quits

follow you.
MR. HOFFMANNs

The difference is that in the normal

sours® an independent operator operating a center at a losing
rata is going to go out of business.
QUESTIONi

This is just further evidence of the

fact you consider already

established, that they would have
»

gone out of business instead of being taken over.
MR® HOFFMANNs
QUESTIONS
MR, HOFFMANN;

Precisely so,
That's the only difference there.
It’s also evidence *”«> now, with great

respect, it’s also evidence as to the power to control price.
Because normally
QUESTION:

Is there any evidence that the prices in

the market changed as a result — I didn’t think -there was.
MR. HOFFMANNs

Your Honor, it's diminution. There

is evidence about pries changes here and there. There are all
kinds of evidence under attempts to prove the second part of
Section 7» But it isn’t tied with precision to damages to these
teh re© p1aintif fs,
QUESTION;

Do you contend the price was raised or

41
lowered by reason of the acquisition?
MRa HOFFMANN; We submit the price is necessarily
lowered, because normally in -She market the price would be
enough to reflect at least some income»
QUESTION; So then you started to speak some time ago
about a clash of policies»

Is the clash, on the one hand, the

public interest and low prices, and the other policy the policy
of the small businesses staying in business?

Or what is the

clash of policies here?
MR» HOFFMANN;

Your Honor, those are not the two

antipodal things , I hope.
The two policies are Section 4 of the Clayton Act,
which is designed to create privat® avengers for antitrust
violations in great numbers, to augment feh© forces of the
Department of Justice, and which provides, with no exceptions,
for three-fold damages and for attorneys' fees, wherever the
plaintiff has been injured in his business or property by
reason of a violation of the antitrust laws»
That policy is an important, one, and it applies to
Section 7, as is indicated by legislative history»

Not just

statements of people, which Mr» Justice Jackson said, aren't
read by the President when he signs bills»
the Congress did»

But it's by what

In 1914, the Cleiyfcon Act, Section 7,

prohibition of acquisition of stock, directly or indirectly,
of a competitor»

42
Three bills went through. The first two would have
not put that under Section 4 for three-fold damages,
The final bill that went out did.
In 1950, once more, modification of Section 7, now
to include th© remedy for what had become the lawyer’s device
to escape old Section 7P and that was to throw the acquisition
of assets, as well as stock, into Section 7,

And when that

happened, Congress again had a chance to change Section 4,
It did not do so.
Just this past year, in the antitrust laws, we made
again a change, this time of Section 4, in which, among
other things, a State was given a right to sue for injury done
a citizen.

No effort meide to take out Section 7 from the

thrust of Section 4,
So then that’s the policy.

Is there a policy opposing?

Is there a policy in favor of acquisition by capital?
I suggest, as Mr, Justies Brennan pointed out in
•the Philadelphia Bank case, the policy is the opposite. The
policy is to — not to expand by taking over the businesses
and ingenuity and efforts of other men, but to do it internally.
That’s what the Congress was after.

And it only may be done

under Section 7, when it is done in such a way as to satisfy
the reach of the statute.
Do I have a minute or two?
I have not?

QUESTIONs

Mr, Hoffmann, may I ask this question?

MR. HOFFMANNs
QUESTION:

Certainly.

Dc©s the record show the principal

products sold by Brunswick to your clients, for example?
MRo HOFFMANNs

Yes, it does.

QUESTION: mat are they?
MR. HOFFMANN: The principal products are the automatic
pinsetting equipment# which is far the more costly.
$8500.

That varied some over the years.

It’s ©bout

Par installation#

per lan©. And you sav# in a 40-lane center# that’s vary
sizable.
And then about §4300 for the lane itself, the wood
veneer that goes on the bed.

Those are the principal items.

But there are other things:

balls — there’s continuous, if

your mind is reaching towards commerce, there is continuous
maintenance service and, what’s more, credit relations which
have to be serviced all the time.
QUESTION:

What is tdie depreciable life of fch© pin­

setting equipment and of the bowling alloys?
MR. HOFFMANNs

It wasn’t known at the time of trial.

It was believed to be twenty years.

It wasn’t known then,

because automatic pinsetters were discovered by AMF, invented
by AMF, in about 1956.
QUESTION:

Is there any evidence in the record as to

fch® annual sales of other types of equipment to set up centers?

44
MR. HOFFMANN; Such as the bowling balls,. —
QUESTION:

Th© balls and ~

MR. HOFFMANN; «— and the gloves and other 'things»
Yes, there is such evidence.
QUESTION;- What percent is really of total sales
would that be, say* of fee Brunswick Corporation to bowling
centers?
MR. HOFFMANN;
QUESTION;

If you eliminate the pinsetiers, —

MR, HOFFMANNs
QUESTION;

It*s a small percentage.

-»* it*s a vary small percentage.

MR. HOFFMANN;
QUESTION;

I don’t have that figure in my head.

It is a small percentage.

So* quit© unlike the typical vertical

integrated acquisition, where the purpose, among others* is
to acquire customers who will be buying on a regular basis
from til© acquiring corporation,
MR. HOFFMANN; Well, the regular — the machines
themselves, fee pinsetting machines, Your Honor, needs regular
servicing, which includes repair parts. These things, you know,
are under great pressure, the heavy balls are rolled down the
alley,, and those repair parts com© from Brunswick. The
machines need servicing and so on, so there’s a continuous
aspect of business, which I can’t break cut for you now7, but
it’s in the record, as to price.
My colleague here has the figures® They are in A-1603

45
in our Appendix, and they are set up under the heading of
machines and miscellaneous.

The machines and rais ce 11 an©ous,

servicing aspects of them, are three percent of the gross
income figure.
The pro shop and other things that use supplies add
to that.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Hoffmann, I wonder if you — I see

yotir time is up — -ufc I wonder if you could just, in a word,
tell us your .answer to the dilemma that they feel you are
in under question two? how you can't have it both ways?
MR. HOFFMANNS

Yes, sir.

It's no dilemma. Your Honor,

it seems to me, because this is a matter for defense, failing
business? it's not altogether clear that it's even desirable
to have such a defense. But it has never been held, nor even
suggested, that failing business is a state of nature which
prevents the operation of Section 7.
And in the Buffalo case, and in Citizen; Publishing
and in International Shoe, and all th® historic failing-business
cases, that was made clear.

And what needs to be shown wasn't

even asserted by tee defendant.
Part of this wasn't even in their pleadings, never an
attempt made at the trial, for example, to show teat there was
no viable alternative, but the Brunswick acquisition, which
was part of the showing necessary.
Indeed, as to a couple of the centers which were

46

picked up in a bankruptcy sal©, Brunswick urges, even now,
that they should be separately dealt with? Pair Lawn and
Interstate- they say were profit-making centers.
But even there, sirs, there wer© other peopl© who
wanted to buy.

There was, indeed, a curious episode where

somebody bought a center and within 24 hours® time h© was
given a $5,000 profit by Brunswick.

Indeed, Brunswick called

up the chairman of I*© board at eleven o'clock at.night —
this is all in the evidence — in order to get the approval to
buy back from Mr. Vitola a center which he had taken at that
bankruptcy sale.
So that you don't have the elements of the defense.
You have no consideration given to the alternatives.
business is not an affirmative prescription of law.
malt© a determination:

Failing
You don't

Well, this is a failing business,

therefor© it’s all right to acquire it.
QUESTION:

I take it, under the Court of Appeals

remand that you might lose on the failing company doctrine.
MR. HOFFMANN:
QUESTION:

I didn't so read that, Your Honor.

You didn’t?

MR. HOFFMANN:

No.

QUESTION: But it was —
MR. HOFFMANN:

I was much more concerned about

commerce.
QUESTION:

Y©s»

Are 'there more proceedings to b© had

with respect to whether there were alternatives?
MR* HOFFMANNi

Your Honor, if Brunswick has -the chance,

in a new trial, I am sure they will make some effort to repair
■this mischief*
But I don?t think the remand is to be interpreted that
way? on failing business*
k

The remand essentially is on instructions -*MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think your time is up

now.
MR® HOFFMANN:

— Your Honor®

Thank you vary much*
MR® CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr* Hoffmann*

Mr. Segal, you have something further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD G* SEGAL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER.
MR. SEGAL:

Your Honors having just two minutes, I

do want to correct something.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs
correspond®

We have enlarged yours to

You will have a few more minutes.

MR* SEGAL:

Thank you very

much, Your Honor,

Mr® Chief Just-ice, I do not want to have to© record
stand where I said we were in serious financial condition,
and my friend rises to says
for us*

No, indeed, things were booming

And I therefore read to Your Honors just four

sentences from the opinion of the Court of Appeals, particularly

48
because it is Judge Gibbons, to whom my friend refers

as

having indicated that things were riding very high and handsome
for us*
I read Judge Gibbons:
’’Over the years , Brunswick” -QUESTION:
MR* SEGALs

What page of the- Appendix?
Page 7a, Mr® Justice Stewart*

QUESTION: Thank you.
MR* SEGAL:

"Over the years, Brunswick had borrowed

close to $300 million in order to finance the manufacture and
sale of bowling equipment*

By late 1964 its receivables wer®

in excess of $400 million of which more than $100 million were
over 90 days’ delinquent*

Brunswick was clearly in serious

financial difficulty*
"In an effort to reversa its deteriorating condition,
Brunswick’s management decided on a plan*'5

And it’s that plan

that Your Honors have before you*
So that, as in so much that ray friend has done, he
is simply not arguing this case, Your Honor*
Let me give you another example.

He took Your

Honors' time to say that in cases like the movie cases you
don't have to be precis® in damages.
Your Honors, this is the most precis® case I have
known in my entire experience*

Five witnesses got up end said,

Here’s the minimum, here’s the maximum* And they were identical

43
The jury took the identical figuras, not a, penny
difference, and he argues to Your Honor a theory as -to whether
damages can ba.
What we have here, if Your Honors please, is very
simple.
We have a judge who frankly says, !:I am venturing
into new ground,ts

In my judgment h© relished Your Honors

taking certiorari on, the case.

It rides throughout his opinion

that h® would lovs to have it. determined.
H© has concluded -that if someone is ‘there and
admittedly, as the questions of Your Honors have indicated, if
we had forborn, ther© wouldn't b© a change in the market,
Thor© is not a showing by anybody that fch© market situation
is changed, that anybody has a greater share than before,
that anybody has more equipment, other than three independents
who put in a little more equipment.
What we have her® is a judge who has concluded that
in this limited area of liability, namely, Section 7, where we
are breaking new ground, if you don't deliver what Section 7
says, namely, a lessening of competition, you nevertheless
can have damages.
Now, on® of Your Honors has asked; Ax© ther® any
cases?

And I say this again categorically, ©very cas© I have

read, and we have given the quotations in our brief, that has
pronounced the new theory that you can have damages under

50

Section 7, says only if you can demonstrate feh© damage flows
from a lessening of competition ©r a creation of monopoly.
On th® second points Your Honor, 1 think I have said
enough.

The sol© question that, the Court of Appeals decided

against us, on the failing company doctrine, is that it was
our obligation affirmatively to prove.
And X leave Your Honors with a thought, that if
anything has been demonstrated 'this morning by my friend’s
own argument# it is that thasa were failing companies.
Why would we adduce proof, when it ran throughout the case,
where the case was rampant, where th© whole theory of the case
wasi that if we hadn’t taken over, they would have failed.
No# no ona ©Is© would have taken over.
Why did we?

No on® would.

Why were we willing to operate some of them at a

Because we needed cash flow,

w© would have been
W© needed money, dollars,

not profits.
We didn’t worry about depreciation, which caused
losses? w® needed cash flow. And th© record shows the cash
flow for every canter.
I thank you, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

The cas© is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11s42 a.m., the case in th© above*»
entitled matter was submitted.]
