ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. HAMPTON BOLES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BOLES:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I represent Alabama Power Company in this cause
who is the Appellant.

Alabama Power Company is an electric

public utility engaged in the service of electricity to
consumers in portions of the State of Alabama.
Except for a two and one-half year period of time
in the military and a period off for a union strike, Mr0 Davis
was employed by Alabama'Power Company from 1936 until his-re­
tirement in 1971o
According to the provisions of the pension plan of
Alabama Power Company, Mr* Davis' time in the military was not.
considered as a credit in computing the amount of MrDavis'
retirement income„
Mr. Davis instituted litigation, through the U,,S c
Attorney's office, alleging that Alabama Power Company,

4
notwithstanding the contrary provisions of the pension plan,
was required to count the two and one-half year period as
accredited service

with the company in computing the amount of

retirement income under the pension plan.
The District Court in Alabama ruled in favor of
Mr, Davis, reasoning that since Alabama Power Company's plan
did not have a precise matching of units of work to units of
benefits under the plan, that the benefit was like seniority
and, therefore, his military time must be counted as accredited
service under the plan.
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed
per curiam, with one dissenting opinion, and this Court accepted
cert.
Although the monthly monetary amount involved in
Mr, Davis' claim is not very great, this case presents to this
Court for the first time the precise issue of the proper treat­
ment of military service time under the reemployment provisions
of the Military Selective Service Act.
The facts below would not dispute it and 1 set forth
as agreed statement of facts, beginning at about page 15, in
the Appendix.
Now, we believe that this case is in a posture to be
decided upon three fundamental propositions which we believe
to exist with respect to the reemployment provisions of the
Military Selective Service Act.

5
Now, first of all, we don't contest, nor dispute,
that the Military Selective Service Act, that is,the reemploy­
ment provisions of that Act, were enacted to benefit the
veteran.
Primarily, they were enacted and dictate that a
veteran, that a qualified veteran, upon his return to private
employment, must be employed without loss of seniority, and
must be entitled to participate in insurance and other benefits
that exist in accordance with established rules of the employer
as they relate to employees on leave or furlough of absence.
Now, the second proposition,which we have no contest
about and x<?e do not question it, is if there is an employee
benefit

or any type of employee advancement which accrues

automatically by virtue of continued association with an
employer, alone, by virtue of that time period, then the
*

veteran must have his military service time count towards
accruing that benefit.
The third proposition which we say is well founded
in law and applies to this case is that if the employer
\

agreement has in it a work requirement that is a condition
to that benefit, then that work requirement must be satisfied
by the employee, regardless of whether he is a returned
veteran or just a returning employee from leave of absence,
before the employee can — becomes entitled to that benefit.
Now, it is the Alabama Power Company's position in

6
this case that accredited service under its pension plan can
only be earned when one of its employees works for the company,,
It is our position that that work requirement is real,

It

requires the employee to be present on the job* earning regular
pay °
QUESTION:

Mr» Boles* is the plan clear in its

application to employees who are on furlough or leave of
absence?

I should think if it were then this would be open

and shut, wouldn't it?
MR0 BOLES:

Mr, Justice Stewart* I agree that it

should be open and shut.
should be very simple.

It is our position that the case
It is clear that an employee on leave

of absence* without regular pay* receives no benefit under
the pension plan,

Ke gets no credit for accredited service

under the minimum pay provisions of computed income.

He gets

absolutely not one day of earnings„
/

As I want to go into* there are two provisions in
the plan for computing pension pay and they are set forth in
Section 5 of the pension plan* beginning at about page oO,
QUESTION:

Is that set aside every month* every

quarter or annually?
MR* BOLES:

Mr. Chief Justice* it would' be set-

aside on an actuarial basis* and I don't proclaim to understand
when it is done* but it is set aside on an actuarial basis and
there is no segregation of the fund per employee

7
If that answers your question *»**
QUESTION:

It must be at fairly frequent intervals

to take Into account people who either leave or take long-term
sick leave; must it not?
MR. BOLES:

Yes, sir.

Now, I would like to point out —> You may have *=Yes, sir.

I cannot answer that question with any degree of

certainty, but I do know that it is done as frequent as is
necessary through accounting procedures to maintain the plan
on a sound actuarial basis.

And they do take this into

account.
QUESTION:

There would be tax problems involved

there, too, would there not?
MR. BOLES:

If you are speaking about Section 404 of

the Internal Revenue Code which states that payments into the
pension fund are deductible In the year in which they are
made, it is my understanding, under the theory that they are
a type of compensation to the employee and then the employee
gets them as deferred compensation and they become taxable to
him. in the year received, taxable to the employer in the year
it is given.
Yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Now, when he is on military leave, does

this record show whether the company made any contributions for
this particular man?

8
MR® BOLES:

1 believe in the agreed statement of

facts it does* Your Honor®

It states that the fund was not

funded to account for periods of absence for military leave.
Yes, sir®
QUESTION:

One reason for that* I suppose, among

many others, is that there is no certainty that the particular
employee is going to come back.
MR. BOLES:

Absolutely not®

There is no certainty.

When an employee leaves to go in the military, he does not have
any type of contract which binds him to return to the employer®
That is his free election.

If he returns within the time-

period that's specified in the statute -«* I believe ninety days
— the employer has to accept him.

There is,- further, no

requirement that once he returns that he stay any length of
time.

I mean, he can return, stay a day —
QUESTION:
{9

absence, too.

That's true of someone on leave of

)

Lumhey v, Wagner forbids the specific performance

of contracts for personal service.

No employee, is ever bound

by contract to come back to his employer in the sense of an
enforceable obligation.
MR® BOLES:

That is correct.

If a person goes on

leave of absence, say, to take his own time, without pay, to
go two years of college, we do not fund the plan,, there, either,
for him.
QUESTION:

Now, do you give him seniority for the

9
two years that he has gone to college?

MR» BOLES:

Now, that's -*» Under the collective

bargaining agreement, as straight seniority for time, I cannot
state exactly whether the union allows him to collect seniority»
I can state that with respect to the pension plan he doesn't
earn a red cent»
QUESTION:

But, clearly, an employee who left to go

in the military was entitled to have seniority in the sense of
job-bidding preference,,

If your leave of-absence man got

seniority but nothing else, I would think your man returning
from the military would — rather, if your leave of absence
man got

Now, I've lost my t’ain of thought.
MR» BOLES:

Go ahead»

But, just for the record, I can state

that the record refers to the sollective bargaining agreement»
It is absolutely clear in those agreements that military service
time does count toward seniority for those types of things,
such as layoff and job preference.
QUESTION:

What aboub a sick leave?’

Let us say an

employee has tuberulosis and has a one-year leave of absence
and he is not being paid, is there any contribution paid to
him -«-paid into the fund for his account?
MR. BOLES: It is my understanding. Chief Justice
Burger, that it is not funded to account for prolonged leaves
of absence»

Now, you don't get credit for leaves of absence

for sickness, under the pension plan, in excess of thirty days,

10

except for the one occasion that's mentioned in the stipulated
facts * where, if an individual has over twenty years' service
and he faces that situation that the company can, in its
discretion, grant extended sick-leave.

In that case, if he

is granted sick-leave with pay, it is funded.
QUESTION:

That's a matter of contract, though, is

QUESTION;

This is a non-contributory plan.

it?

MR» BOLES:
QUESTION:

It is a non~contributory plan, but -Do I correctly understand that this

really gets down to the computation of, quote, "accredited1'
service, upon the basis of which you compute the amount of
the pension?

Is that right," according to the plan?

MR. BOLES:
QUESTION:
MR. BOLES:

In Mr. Davis' case -»=•
Under the plan, Is it the basic thing?
No, sir, I don't think so.

Under Section 5> the basic normal retirement income
computation is a percent of earnings, totally a percent of
earnings.

There is nothing else in there, but it is an

extremely long and complicated formula.

They take 1% of

earnings up to a certain step aid then a greater percent of
earnings.
QUESTION:

In that formula, don't you apply a multi­

plier of the total years of acc 'edited service?
MRo BOLES:

You do no'; unless — That is a minimum pay

11

formula 0
Let me try to explain that because that is important
to my case*
QUESTION:

I'd like to ask a questiono

The plan does not include military service and
accredited service; is that right?
MRo BOLES:
QUESTION;

That is correct,
And that’s why we've got the case, Isn't

it?
MR, BOLES:

That is one reason.

You could get it

even under *»»
We don't count it for earnings.

The basic provision,

under the plan, in Section 5* is that for computing the amount
of retirement income you take a percent of earnings and add
them up.

That is all.

Then you have a minimum retirement pay

section which is also in Section 5 that x^/as introduced by
amendment in 1966 that does take Into account accredited
service.

Basically, that section says you take a percent of

his earnings on retirement and multiply It times his accredited
service,
QUESTION:

And you do not include, in that last

element, military?
MR, BOLES:
QUESTION:

That is absolutely correct,
You may not include other things, but in

any event you don't include military, and that's why we have

12

the ease isn't it?
MR. BOLES:
QUESTION:

That's way you have this specific ease*
I understand the case depends upon the

statute and the statute appears on page 3 of the brief for
the Respondent®

And C-X, B, capital B, in parentheses — No,

just C-1 equates this thing to what happens to employees who
are on furlough or leave of absence®
issue in this case.

And that's the critical

And what Joes happen to employees under

your plan who are on furlough or leave of absence?

That's

dispositive of this statutory question.
MR® BOLES j

I agree.

And those persons do not get

credit under the pension plan, not by the way of accredited
service nor by way of earnings under the first section.
QUESTION:
MR. BOLES:
QUESTION:
,

MR. BOLES:

Do they gst credit for lost seniority?
Are you speaking of a veteran?
Two years to go to college.
If it is non-union related- it is my

understanding that they do not.

But the veteran does.

It

is specific that the veteran does.
QUESTION:

So that's why you can't necessarily say

that because you treat other leaves of absence the way you
treat military leaves the same, you are following the statute,
because the statute requires different treatment in some
situations«
MRo BOLES:

Exactly,

With regard to seniority it

13

does require

~~ It can require purpose.

QUESTION:

If a certain benefit Is a function of

seniority, you have to give it to them.
MR* BOLES:

I don't deny that if a benefit is a

function of seniority that you have to give it to the returned
veteran.
QUESTION:

Even though you don't to people who are

on leave,
MR» BOIES:
QUESTION:

We are ii complete agreement.
But your position, I take it, is that the

function of seniority is not to be equated with contributions
by the employer into a fund, during a period when the person
is not present in the establishment.
MR, BOLES:

And earning regular pay, and that is

present under a full-time regular
employee.

As a full-time regular

That's one who works 40 hours a week for an in­

definite period of time.
QUESTION:

The statute entitles the returning

veteran to three separate guarantees.
without loss of seniority.

He shall be restored

He shall be entitled to participate

In insurance or other benefits offered by the employer pursuant
to established rules and practices relating to employees on
furlough or leave of absence.

And he shall not be discharged

from such position without cause within one year after such
restoration

14

Those are three separate guarantees.
are new considering the second one that I read.

X take it we
The test ther

is what the plan provides for employees on leave of absence.,
It seems to me relatively simple»
MR» BOLES:

The plan provides that they will not

receive accredited service when they are on furlough or leave
of absence.
QUESTION:

Mr. Boles, isnlfc there another qualifi­

cation in that language?

It's "in accordance with rules in

effect at the time he went in the service."

And wasn't this

plan adopted after this man went into service?
MRa BOLES:

This plan was adopted after he went

into the service.
As far as the pension benefits that Mr. Davis has
gotten, we have bestowed those upon him, I say, by virtue of
the desire cn the part of the company and not by virtue of
what the Act said.

The pension plan was established in 1944.

He left for the service in '43,

That's right.

It was in

effect when he came back.
QUESTION:

You said you had bestowed them on him.

Does he have his benefits, then?
MR. BOLES:

He absolutely does, except for the two

and one-ha 1? year period that lie was gone.

He has gotten just

the same amount : ? benefits, under the pension plan,, as if he had
never left.

15
QUESTION:

Well* if the pension plan was adopted

after he went into service, then the language Mr. Justice
Stewart read really doesn't apply, does it?
MR. BOLES:

According to the reading of the statute,

it does not apply.
QUESTION:
MR, BOLES:
that statute.

Well, then —
«« situated to give him rights under

I think it is his duty to fit himself Within

that statute.
Now, what the Government Is claiming is that they
go through the first section and they talk about seniority
and they claim that pension benefits, in some sort of a
general or generic sense, constitute seniority.

And that's

where we have a widely divergent view of what the law is.
We say that it is not seniority, that it should fit
within the other benefits section that Mr. Justice Stewart
read.

Yes, sir.
I would like to take a few minutes, if I could, to

look at the Government's position — *
QUESTION:

Is there a $17 difference, as suggested,

between what he has been getting and what he would get if he
were credited with the two and one-half years of military
service?
MR. BOLES:
QUESTION:

That's right, sir.
$17.11 a month.

16

MR. BOLES:

I don't want to leave the impression

that the accredited service under that particular section,
where Mr* Davis' retirement plan was computed, is not directly
related to work and directly related to earnings.
You can only get accredited service if you are a
full-time regular employee, not on leave of absence*
By leave of absence, I don't include the two-week
vacation or the ten days sick leave*

I mean leave of.absence

when you are away, other than those that are listed in the
agreed statement of facts*
QUESTION:

Mr, Boles, would you give me one other

factual bit of information, I am confused on?
In order to qualify for the first dollar of benefits,
is there a minimum service requirement?
MR* BOLES:
QUESTION:
MR0 BOLES:

One year,

And a veteran —

Anything )ver a year?
Yes, Sir,,

And I would point ou ; here the distinction is that
with that one-year qualifying )eriod under the plan, we do not
have a work requirement.

You just have to maintain the status

of an employee for one year.

If a person, or an employee,

leaves the service of the company after six months, and
returns, he gets his six months toward that qualifying year.
Another comparison type example is in the vested
section, Section 7, of the plan which requires a certain number

17

of years of employment prior to retirement you get vested in
order to obtain benefits when you leave.
Recently amended by ERISA,

but under the plan —

that also, specifically, under the plan related only to a time
requirement, the maintenance of an association with the company
for that many years.
There, again, the veteran and the person on leave of
absence can get that time requirement.

It specifically states

in that section that the veteran can accumulate that particular
credit.
QUESTION:

Does what you are saying add up to the

fact that the dispute over the right of the veteran never
affects eligibility?

It may sometimes affect the dollar he

receives, and that Is all.
MR. BOLES:

It would affect the dollars received

and would not affect his eligibility.
QUESTION:

It affects the amount.

It is assumed that he would get the

service, but it is not assumed that he earned any wages during;
that time.
MR. BOLES:

That's correct, sir.

It is assumed that he did the service in those
instances in the plan which depend on — which is conditioned
on an element of time.
I reserve some time for the morning.
am out of today's time

I see that I

18

Thank you.
QUESTION:

May I ask you one question?

Do you characterize the payments under the plan as
deferred compensation?
MR» BOLES:
QUESTION:

I do, sir.

Yes, sir*

Well, then, how do you account for taking

into the plan services rendered prior to July 1944?
Certainly those services were paid for, the books
were closed.

And now you talk about deferred compensation for

those services»
MR. BOLES:

I think you can look at it — You are

talking about past service under the plan.

In that particular

section, it also has an accredited service, part of the
former.
I think that if you Iook at it from the point of
view of the employee, that it is deferred compensation, al­
though It is retroactive.

He is given something on the date

of the pension plan that is for past service, but it is still
there.

It is still, in our plan, related and conditioned

upon individuals, having been v:ith the company, working and
earning earnings, during that fast service.
QUESTION:

Well, it is really a gift, isn't it?

He had no claim, no legal claim, before the plan.
MR» BOLES:

He had no legal claim before the plan

and his only claim is by virtue of the plan.

That's right, sir.

19

QUESTION: Of course, he had no claim to any pension
plan, did he?
MR, BOLES:

That's one of the points here that I

think we've got to look at the plan to determine what benefits
there are that Mr, Davis may have been entitled to.
It is our contention that he got everything that he
earned and we properly excluder his military service time.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Ryan, we will let you get started in view of
the time factor,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A, RYAN, JR,, ESQ,,
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR, RYAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I think it is important to put into some perspective
both the statute and the plan.
Congress, over the years- has provided the veteran
with a number of benefits in return for his service to his
country.
These have been diverse benefits, such things as
educational assistance, under the G.I, Bill, job counseling
and the rights that we have here, in this case, which are
rights to reemployment ,
This statute -

20
QUESTION:

This is more than right to reemployment.

MR. RYAN:

It Is, Mr. Chief Justice.

There are,

actually, three rights or four rights, depending on how you
parse them.
They apply, in the first place, only to employees
who leave the job, serve in the military, are honorably discharged and return to the same employer as they had before
their military service.
QUESTION:

What would you say with respect to a

pension plan that, as to this man, had been established in
I960, long after the war, long after he had returned?

Would

you think that he should get nunc pro tunc -MR. RYAN:
the plan.

I would say jrou would have to look at

If the plan says we will start credit only in

i960, then he would not get credit for his wartime service.
If the plan said we will start counting time in
19^0, then he would.
If the plan said we will count time from the day
you came on the job or from one year from the day you came on
the job, then,in Mr. Davis 8 case, he would.
The date that the plan is adopted is not the
critical factor.

It is how the plan treats the veteran, vis-

a-vis how It treats the non-veteran who was on the job at the
same time.
QUESTION:

How do you interpret the last part of th<

✓

21
Section C«1 on page 3 of your brief, where you are talking
about participating Insurance or other benefits offered by the
employer pursuant to established rules and practice relating
to employees on furlough or leave of absence,.in effect with
the employer at the time such person was inducted Into such
forces?
What meaning do you give to that language I just
quoted?
MR» RYAN:

That language means that while the

employee is in uniform, while he is serving in the military,
the employer is obligated during that time to provide him
with the same benefits as the employer provides to employees
who are on non-military leave of absence.
And the Court, in Accardl, supports that reasoning,
Although it could, perhaps, be said to be dicta In Accardl,
this Court said that it was persuaded by that Interpretation
that that clause speaks only to the time.that the employee is
actually serving.
QUESTION:

And it is quite a distinction —
Well, if It is dicta In Accardl, how do

you reconcile it with the actual language itself?
MR0 RYAN:

It is a very difficult job to reconcile

QUESTION:

It Is impossible, is it not?

MR<, RYAN:

«-’with...the language of the statute.

it with «—

Itself9

22
The statute speaks of persons who are restored.
And the argument* I would think, is that while an employee is
in uniform, he has not yet been restored.
But the Court, in Accardl, looking at the legislative
history, was persuaded by that interpretation.
QUESTION:

Was persuaded to render that dicta.

MR. RYAN:

Yes.

I think it is important also in that respect —
QUESTION: Well, is' it your position:} then, that; this
case isn't to be judged under that provision?
MR. RYAN:

That is absolutely our position,

Mr. Justice.
Our case does not depend on that clause at all and
this case would• be in no different posture if that clause were.1
entirely absent from the statute.
I think it is important to distinguish, and this
refers to a remark- I think, that Mr. Justice Stewart made —
And I would like to clarify the Government's position on it,
that this case cannot be disposed of by saying, "We will look
only at what the Alabama Poi»;er Company granted its employees
on leave of absence in the way of pension benefits."
The statute commands that first you must look to
seniority.

The employer is obligated to restore the veteran

without loss or seniority.
Court must look, we submit.

That's the first place that the

23
If it is determined that the right is not one of
seniority, then the inquiry goes to the second stage,

But,

we contend that the second stage is-not necessary in this case.
QUESTION:

The second stage being very explicit with

respect to, what you call it, insurance or other benefits,
would be the one that would control if it were applicable.
But it has been pointed out there was no plan in effect at
the time this person was inducted into the Armed Forces, so
I suppose in this case it is not applicable.

If so, I should

think it would be the controlling one, because it's the
specific one.
MR. RYAN:

Well, I think we agree that it is not

applicable in this case.
QUESTION:

It doesn't seem to be applicable because

there was no plan at the time he was inducted into the Armed
Forces ,
QUESTION:

Well, then, if you are right, the guy •

gets a much better break if his employer adopts a plan in i960
than if he adopted one in 1940.
MR, RYAN:

He gets no better break than his counter­

part who never went into the Army, and that's what Congress
intend ed.
QUESTION: But he gets a better

The man who went

into the Army in 1940 and his employer had a pension plan then
is limited to the terms of the pension plan that was in effect

24

in 1940o

Whereas, the man who went in in 1940 and the pension

plan isnl't adopted until i960 gets better treatment, even
though he =■» presumably there was no element of reliance there „
MR0 RYAN:

The veteran whose employer adopts a plan

in i960 is to be treated in exactly the same way as any other
employee who has been with the company for an equal length of
time who did not go into the Army.

Now, whether all employees

are better off if the plan was adopted in i960, rather than
1940, that may well be true, but for purposes of this statute
what Congress is saying is, "Don't discriminate between the
veteran and the non-veteran, regardless of what you — "
QUESTION:

But your ~eason for the inapplicability

of that provision we have been talking about is a different
reason, isn't

it?

MR. RYAN:

I mean, there is more than one reason “~
As-Justice Stewart suggests, yes, sir.

I won't quarrel with that reason, Mr. Justice, but
I think, in this case, it is not necessary to reach that point.
I think if I may also clarify a point raised in a
question by Mr. Justice Stevens, it is necessary under this
plan for an employee to work for fifteen years or twenty years
before he is eligible for that first dollar of benefit.
works one year and then enters the plan.

He

Having entered the

plan, he still must, work up to twenty years before he is
