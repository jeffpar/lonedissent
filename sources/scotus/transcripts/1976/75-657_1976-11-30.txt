MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

V7e will hear arguments

first this morning in 75-657, United Steelworkers against
Usery, Secretary of Labor.
Mr. Frank©1, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL B. FRANKEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FRANKEL:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Beginning in 1964, and at each of the biennial
conventions since then, the membership of United Steelworkers
of America has voted to adopt, in its present form, a meeting
attendance requirement applicable by constitution to all of
the 5200 Local Unions, which comprise the Steelworkers
International.
Under that rule, to be eligible for Local Union
office in any of the 5200 Local Unions, a member must have
attended one-half of the regular monthly meetings in the threeyear period preceding the election — the three-year period
being the term, the prior term of office — unless his work
or union activities prevents attendance.
This case arises under Section 401(e) of the Labor
Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. Section
481(e)f which provides for the right of a member to run for
Local Union office, and provides that, -that right is subject, to

4
reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed.
This case began when one of two defeated candidates
for president of Local 3489, in its 1970 ©lection of officers,,
challenged the validity of the meeting attendance requirement,
first; internally within the Union, and then in a complaint
filed with the Secretary of Labor.
The Secretary, within the time allotted by statute,
then filed this lawsuit attacking the meeting attendance rule,
as applied in the 1970 election of Local 3489.
The district court, following the lead of the Sixth
Circuit and four other district courts, all of whom had passed
on the validity of the Steelworkers * meeting attendance rule,
held that our rule was indeed a reasonable qualification under
the Act.
The Secretary appealed to the Seventh Circuit. The
Seventh Circuit, departing from this line of authority, con­
cluded on the contrary that the rule was unreasonable, and
the conflict between the Seventh Circuit and the Sixth Circuit
is what brings this case to this Court.
Your Honors, actually the issue in this case is a
very, very narrow one, much narrower than X had initially
thought.
*

Upon reading the briefs, one gets to appreciate

just how narrow it is.

X want to emphasize that by starting

wrth where we and the Secretary of Labor agree*

The Secretary

©s Labor and the Steelworkers agree, even under the Secretary's?

5
most recent regulation. 'that it is reasonable under the
statute for Onions to have meeting attendance rules.

Point

No. 1» where we agree.
The second point on which we agree is that such rules
serve valid Onion purposes — and now I am quoting the
Secretary — namely, to insure that candidates have a
demonstrated interest in and familiarity with the affairs of
the organization.
QUESTION:
did he say that?

You're quoting the Secretaryt and where

In the brief?

MR. FRANKEL:
brief.

It's in the regulation and in the

It’s in the Secretary's current regulation.
QUESTION:

Current regulation. And it's also in

the brief?
MR. FRANKEL:

Yes.' Pago 15 of the Secretary's brief,

where he paraphrases the regulation.
QUESTION:

Right.

Thank you.

QUESTION:

When you say "regulation” , do you mean

it's part of the interpretative bulletin?
MR. FRANKEL:
regulation.

Well - he issues an interpretative

It’s published in the C„F.R.

Prior to that, there

was a manual which was distributed to Local Unions, where
they could follow what the Secretary's interpretations were.
QUESTION:

Is the Secretary given authority by

Congress to issue regulations the way the SEC is, that it has

6
the force of law, or are these just Interpretations?
MR. FRANKEL: They are interpretations# Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I see®

QUESTION:

What other sanctions# if any# are there

for non-attendance at meetings?
MR® FRANKEL:

There are no sanctions.

All that

non-attendance means is feat the individual — that the member
would not be eligible to run for Local Union office if he
didn’t attend half the meetings.

Or if his work precluded

his attendance# he would not — there would be no sanctions#
of course# and h© would still be eligible.
QUESTION:

Mr. Frank©1# I find some indecision or

difference in the brief and records.

How often did this

Local have its meetings# its regular meetings# every month?
MR. FRANKEL:

Every month# Your Honor.

But there were two meetings # so that — it was a
split meeting# which means feat — there were three shifts at
this plant# so that meant that anybody could attend the
meeting.

Thare was one which was held# as I recall# on a

Wednesday afternoon and the next was on a Thursday morning?
so that everybody could attend.
QUESTION:

Well# what’s — would the same —

MR. FRANKEL:

But it was on© meeting.

It was

considered on® meeting.
QUESTION:

But# would fee same thing b© duplicated

7
cm Thursday rooming as went on Wednesday?
MRo FRANKEL:

Yes, the same business would occur —

would arise, and what they frequently do is cumulate the
votes on any issue on which a vote has to be taken.
QUESTION: Well, I take it the people that came
Thursday morning wouldn’t get the benefit of

the discussion,

at any rate, that took place Wednesday afternoon.
MR. FKANKEL:

They might not, that’s correct.

But the reason for the split shift — excuse me, for
the split meetings is so that everybody can attend the meeting.
And
QUESTION:

Mow, you had some excuses here, didn’t

you, if —
MR. FRANKEL;

Work and meeting -- and union

activities.
QUESTION:

How many people would have qualified who, —

by virtue of the excuses?
MR. FRANKEL:

There’s no way of knowing, Your Honor.

No one made that check, neither — the only way of telling
work excuse is by looking at all of the employment records
which are in the possession of the employer.
I think maybe I ought to explain the way the Steel­
workers operate with respect to the work excuse.

We have no

reason to check work excuse, unless tee members are nominated.
If a member is nominated and falls short of the required number

8

of meetings# then and only then will we check to see if he had
sufficient work excuse to qualify him for office,
QUUSTIONs Can you do that; nine months ago?

I

suppose you have annual elections, don’t you?
MR. FRANKEL:

Every three years.

QUESTION; Every three years.
MR. FRANKELs
QUESTION;

Yes.
So that you have to go back 36 months to

shore up your excuses?
MR. FRANKEL; To determine whether or not the member
worked at the time there was a meeting, yes.
QUESTION; Well, I gather the — the meeting roll
shows, by name, who attended?
MR. FRANKEL; That’s correct.
QUESTION:

And so, if he’s a nominee and you find

his name on the meeting roll only 18 times out of 36 —
MR. FRANKEL; Then there’s no reason to check.
QUESTION; That’s right.

If you find, however, it's

only 12 times, ~
MR. FRANKEL;
QUESTION:

Then there’s reason to check.

— then you have to find out the days

that h® was absent and why; is that it?
MR. FRANKEL;

Well, what we have to find out is

whether he worked on the day on which there was a meeting,
QUESTION: Well, there’s something ©Ise, I gather.

9

You said he might have been on union business,
MR.FRANKSL:

Oh., union business? right,

QUESTION:

For example, he might have been a member

of a grievance committee,
MR, FRANKER: That’s correct,
QUESTION i And a meeting on grievance with the employer
might have coincided with a union meeting,
MR. FRANKER: That’s correct.
QUESTION:

And that would be an adequate excuse,

MR, FRANKER:
QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes, sir.

But that’s the kind of inquiry you have

to make if he falls short; is that it?
MR, FRANKER:
QUESTION:

Who has to bear that proof, the member?

MR. FRANKER:
that.

That’s correct.

No, Your Honor* the tellers would do

The member could cooperate by saying, ”1 think I

worked on such-and-such a day", but it would be the duty of the
election tellers to make a check of -those members who did not
— who were nominated, did not meet the meeting attendance
requirement by virtue of meetings alone, then they would have
a finite number, usually a small number, and
QUESTION:

I don’t quite understand.

If he were —

if his excuse v?as that he was working, I thought you said
this was a split meeting, so that any worker would be able to
attend one or the other sessions of tee meeting.

10

MR. FRANKEL;
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, there is overtime.

Oh, I see.

MR. FRANKEL: And, indeed, in this particular case,
there was one member who qualified by virtue of a combination,
and he had an additional — according to the 'Secretary's
investigator, he had an additional nine credits over 16
meetings which he had attended.
Now, the problem is that the Secretary did not look
for anyone — his investigator did not look to see whether
anybody else would have mat it, knowing that nine —- that
tliis one member received nine credits, and there were three
members — he was provided a list by the Union, the Union
gave the Secretary a list and said, "Here's all -the people
who were eligible by virtu® of meeting attendance, and here
are three people who had between 15 and IS meetings."

And

it was for those three people that the Secretary checked the
employment work records, to see whether or not any of those
three would qualify by virtue of 'She excuses.
He found that one did, and the testimony was he
had nine conflicts.

But he didn't check for anybody else.

Now, if one man had nine conflicts, it's possible that
people who were — who had as many as nine meetings attended,
other people may also qualify.
That’s why I say we don't really know how many
members in tikis Local were eligible.

11
QUESTION:

Who appoints the tellers?

MR. FRANKEL; The tellers are either elected or they

are appointed subject to ratification by the membership.
QUESTION:

At a regular meeting?

MR. FRANKEL: At a regular meeting.
QUESTION:

Is it a stated meeting# in which the

purpose of the meeting is announced in advance?
MR. FRANKEL:

It*s a -— usually it’s not a

denomination meeting., but I don't recall the constitutional
provision that said when it had to be dens.

I know# in

practice.- it's usually done at the nomination meeting,, for
which there is a notice.
QUESTION s And how long in advance of the election
is the nomination meeting?
MR. FRANKEL:

Usually a month, or it could be less,

though# it varies. In 5200 Locals you have •— each has its own
autonomy in this respect.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Because between the stated

nomination and election# there’s a very short period.
do you get all this investigating done?

How

On the nominees as to

whom -there’s any question.
MR, FRANKEL:

Well# Your Honor# because usually there

are only a few people as to whom there is a question# and it
doesn't impose that much of a burden.
By the way# I'd like to contrast that with what would

12
happen under the Secretary's approach, which is, you have to
determine, after all is said and done, how many people were
eligible,to find out whether you can apply the rule.
Well, if that's what you'5re going to do — and we
have Locals from 1,000 to 20,000 members, where there are
rotating shifts, steady night shifts, we would have to engage
in an administrative nightmare to send our Local Union people
— camp them out in the employer's records department, if
they will let us, and determine how many people are eligible,
so that we can decide v?hether or not the rule is valid,
given -the test that the Secretary is urging before this Court»
QUESTION: By what process could the eligibility be
made more stringent, that is, moving from half of the meetings
to three-quarters of the meetings?
MR. FRANKEL: Some Unions have don® that, and we would
not —■ it is our position that such a rule would not ba valid
because it imposes too heavy a burden on the member.
QUESTION;

What about 60 percent?

MR. FRANKEL;

I

don't think 60 — I don't think we

should require more than half, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I think half —

Then what's the basis •*— how do you

arrive at these —
MR. FRANKEL; Well, it’s difficult to do, I agree, but
I think, from the standpoint of our rule, that to ask a
member to spend an . hour and forty-five minutes or an hour and

13
a half,- or tero hours,- every other month is not too difficult a
burden.

That adds up to roughly 32 hours in a -three-year

period.
QUESTION: Well# how many people — how many people
in this Local had qualified?
MR. FRANKEL: By virtue of meeting attendance alone?
Twenty- two.
QUESTION:

Out of how many?

MRo FRANKEL:

Six hundred and sixty.

QUESTION: So# apparently# an enormous proportion
of the membership do find it either difficult or# for some
other reason# do not attend the meetings?
MR. FRANKEL:

I think it’s for some other reason#

other than for it being difficult# Your Honor.

I don’t think

you can just —
QUESTION:
are so dull.
MR. FRANKEL:

Maybe it’s just because the meetings
!
Or because they don’t have the interest

in attending.
For example# Your Honor# I would not say that it was
difficult in the United States for a citizen to vote# but in
the last election only 53 percent voted.

And —

QUESTION: Well, this Union isn’t doing nearly as

wall as the voters of this country# is it?
MR. FRANKEL:

Noj that’s correct# Your Honor. But

14
my point is that I don* t think you can measure -the difficulty
of the requirement by how many choose to fulfill it.
If the eligibility were increased, that is. to 60

,

or two-'thirds or three-fourths what is the process by which
a Local Union would make that change?
MR» FRANKEL:

A Local Union could not make -that

change in the Steelworkers, Your Honor.
QUESTION? Then how would it be made, if it were?
MR. FRANKEL:

It would have to be made at Convention,

at the Steelworkers Convention, which imposes these require­
ments nationwide for all Steelworker Locals.
Steelworker Locals are not — cannot deviate.

And from which
I think that

— by the way. Your Honor, I think it assures some fairness.
QUESTION:

Well, at these National Conventions,

you have -the leadership of the Unions —
MR. FRANKEL:

In some instances, yes. Your Honor;

in other instances, the Delegates are elected, as anybody
els©, and it's —
QUESTION:

But the non-attenders, the people with

poor attendance records, aren't likely to show up at a
National Convention, are they?
MR. FRANKEL:

I would say, having attended five

or four of them, that the dissidents do attend meetings, do
get elected to become Delegatas.
QUESTION: Well, may they be elected Delegates if they

15
don't; attend, if they don't rest this attendance requirement?
MR. FRANKEL:

Yes.

Not this attendance requirement,

there is another one,
QUESTION:
MR. FRANKEL:

What is the other one?
As I recall, it's half of the year, but

I don’t recall exactly, but there is an attendance requirement.
QUESTION:'

But the net of all that is that,

essentially the establishment is in control of the National
Convention?
MR. FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

I —
Using the word H establishment” in

quotation marks, of course.
MR. FRANKEL:
is not true.

Your Honor, my experience is that that

I think that the Steelworkers -«

QUESTION: Well, how could these 660 who didn’t
attend, or the non™attainders of the 660 get to a National
Convention?
MR. FRANKEL:

Well, the non-attenders —

QUESTION: They aren't eligible.
MR» FRANKEL:

would not be — would not be eligible,

that's correct, from within their own Local Union? that’s
correct.
But that's only **- it’s a. much smaller, it is a
smaller term? but there is a meeting — as I say, I believe
there is

16
QUESTIONs
how many?

Well- in this Local there would be —

Twenty-two people?
MRc FRANKEL:

There's no way of knowing, because

nobody did a check for a year»
QUESTION;

But as of ih® tin® you gave m@ the

figure,, 22 members out. of 660?
MR. FRANKEL;
QUESTION;
MR. FRANKEL;

That was on a three-year basis.
Yes.
And it didn't include employees or

members who were eligible by virtus of combination.
know hew many of those members would be eligible.

I don’t
There may

fo© many more. There’s no way of knowing.
So I'm saying there were only 22 qualified by
virtue of meeting attendance alone, but you can also qualify
by the combina felon of meeting attendance and work excuse.
And the salt® thing would b© true for the Delegatas.
QUESTION; Tell me, are there many other Internationals
that have this attendance requirement of eligibility for
office?
MR. FRANKEL:

There are 12 International Unions

representing approximately 25 percent of the membership, trade
union membership, which have meeting attendance rules.
Now, if you use the approach that the Secretary

uses, —
QUESTION;

Well, that suggests that 75 percent

MR, PRANKEL:
QUESTION:

Da naa.

— do not - of organized labor do aofc —

MR, FR&NKEL:

Mo,, it doesn't suggest, that because

— for this reason# 'four Honor:

I was giving you a figure

which represents those Internationals which have constitutions
which prescribe a meeting attendance rule.

But there are

the constitutions of other unions permit local unions to
adopt, meeting attendance rules, and again, there’s no way of
knowing how many of them do.
QUESTION:

Do any have a rule, the counterpart of

this?
MR. FRANKEL:

Three-year rule?

I believe ‘«here is

on© other union that has a three-year rule.
QUESTION: So that means the Steelworkers and the
other union are farthest out?
MR. FRANKEL:

Well, no. Your Honor.

I wouldn't

put it that way, I'm sorry# because if you take the approach
the Secretary uses, which is that you measure the rule# the
validity of th© rule# by how many are eligible# it doesn't
matter whether it's one# two or three years.

We're in the ...

same boat as all other unions# if that's the test.

And that's

the only test he is suggesting,
QUESTION:

Let me emphasize th© other

factor.

The 50 percent rule# plus the three years, is the most
stringant of any International ■—

I mean, why don’t you admit that?

isn’t anything nefarious about it.

There

I just wanted to get it

into focus.
MR. FRANKEL: There is a union that had a 75 percent
rule, the Glass Bottle Blowers had a 75 percent requirement.
And there’s another way of looking at stringency,.
Your Honor.

Some unions require 50 percent attendance in.

each year.

Now - that may be more stringent than 50 percent

over a period of three years.
QUESTION:

I suppose, from the point of view of the

Union, if you averaged 80 or 90 pereant attendance at the
meeting, you could count on the members, when they cast their
ballots at election, to realize that the — one of the
candidates had never come to meetings and wasn’t a very good
bet.

But if you get 10 percent of the candidates — 10 percent

of the enrollment at the meetings, the typical man casting his
ballot for a union officers doesn’t really have any idea
whether anyone else came to meetings, because h® probably
didn't com© himself

19
MR. FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

Well, chat way be. Your Honor.
In fact, doesn’t — one of the purposes

of the rule, as I remember it, was to encourage meeting
\

attendance, is that right?
MR. FRANKEL;

Not only to encourage meeting

attendance, Your Honor, but to encourage those who oppose the
leadership of the Union,
QUESTION;

Well, I understand, but just confining

it to encouraging meeting attendance, it really has not
succeeded in that purpose at all, has it?
MR. FRANKEL:

Well, Your Honor, that’s hard to tell

at what point 'there is success, and at what point there isn’t.
If you compare it percentagewise, the attendance at this
Local Union, it was slightly better than, it is at other Local
Unions.

But —
QUESTION:

And I mean, at most of the Locals there

is less than ten percent?
MR. FRANKEL:

No, I have no way of knowing that.

I’m talking about the Locals which vie know about -QUESTION: Through litigation.
MR. FRANKEL:

— because they were in litigated

cases.
But I would say this, Your Honor, the important
point from our standpoint is not only the number, but, one,
how can you tall at what point you have achieved sufficient

20
attendance so that; your rule is valid in the eyes of hh©
Secretary# No.

1? and, No. 2, the most important feature#

purpose of that rule is to get those people who are opposed
to the leadership to come to the meetings and to do so over
the term.

And that —QUESTION: But they must decide# under the rule# at

least 18 months in advance of the election# they want to
oppose the leadership# must they not?
MR. FRANKEL:

No — they must decide whether they

wish to run for office
QUESTION:

At least 18 months in advance.

MRo FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

— 18 months in advance.

Do you think — just that 18-month time

period is kind of unreasonable,
MR. FRANKEL:

That’s true.

isn’t it?

Your Honor# I have this problem:

Secretary says 18 months is too long in advance.

The

If we had

a one-year rule, he would say that that requires — that the;
member has to make his decision too late.

In our rule# he

says he has to make it too early.
QUESTION:

Why would he have to make it too late?

I donf t unde rs tan d.
MR. FRANKEL:

Well# because* the time would have gone

by for him to qualify.
If you have# for example# a rule in which you had —
in the last year you had to attend half the meetings# teat's

21

all.

A member may have attended every meeting for two years

~ arid I can assure you the Secretary would say that if he
had attended every meeting for two years, and now in the last
year you require him to attend half -the meetings , and he
doesn’t make it, that that would be an invalid rule.
Nowt to continue that, we have a three-year —
QUESTIONS

Well, just *— the only thought that runs

through my mind is -the fact that you can hypothesise a whole
host of invalid rules doesn’t seem to me very persuasive as to
whether this is the reason for the requirement.
MR. FRANKEL:

Well, Your Honor, the problem I9m

getting to is that the Secretary has also rescinded a three —
a two — his original — not his original, but a regulation
which permitted a two-year rule.
QUESTION:

So we have -—

But, counsel, we’re not deciding what

was reasonable or unreasonable that the Secretary has done in
other situations.
is reasonable.

The question is whether this particular rule

Isn’t that the only issue we have?

MR. FRANKEL:

That’s correct. Your Honor. But, in

order to determine what is reasonable, in order to determine
what is reasonable — given the fact that the Secretary says
that a meeting attendance rule is, it self, reasonable, then
there has to be some measuring period.
And what we’re saying is the Secretary hasn’t given
us any way of knowing what that measuring — what an appropriate

22
ii.e as uriny period would i a.
QUESTIONz Well, let me put it this way;

Without

referring to the Secretary at all, it would be helpful if you
could give me some persuasive reason why it*s reasonable to say
that unless a man makes up his mind 18 months in advance of an
election that he wants to be a candidate in that election,
he may not become a candidate •
MR, FRANKS I.:

The. reason I would give, Your Honor,

is that if we didn't do that, then we would remove the incentive
for opponents of the leadership to attend early in the term,
in the first 18 months,
Tli at is the reason,
QUESTION: But what if he doesn't knew, until within
the 18-month period, that he disagrees with the leadership?
MR, FRANKEL:
QUESTION;

Well, —

I mean, persons aren't permanently

opponente or supporters,

Voters change their minds.

You have to become an opponent more than 18 months
in advance under your approach, as I understand it,
MR. FRANKEL;
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

No, that's not true if you've attended

every meeting —
QUESTION:

Unless you attend every meeting otherwise,

QUESTION:
MR, FRANKEL:

That's not true at*all.
Unless you've attended all meetings in

23

the first 18 months —
QUESTION:

Unless you’re within the three percent

or so that attend meetings regularly.
MR. FRANKEL:

Or unless you. have work excuse during

the first 18 months.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. FRANKEL;
QUESTION;

May I ask you this question?

Yes, Your Honor.

Do you ~~ I suppose you would agree that

my brother Stevens has correctly stated the question before us,
but I had rather thought it wasn't whether or not this Union
rule is reasonable, but, rather? whether or not the Secretary
was justified under the statute in finding that it was reason**
able.

And there may be a difference.

It's sort of like a

jury verdict.
MR. FRANKEL:

I don't think the Secretary, in this

ins tance t —QUESTION:

Isn’t that, the question, rather than the

one that’s posed by my brother Stevens?
MR. FRANKEL:

Your Honor? I think the test is whether

the rule is reasonable under the statute? and in -making that
determinati on on® must consider what the Secretary says, and
give it a certain amount of weight.

And that’s why we have

approached it. -QUESTION;

MR. FRANKELs

That's correct.

Our —

QUESTION: And you would agree that some deference ,
at least some deference, must be given, which —~
MR. FRANKED:

I would* agree with that, had the

Secretary com© up with a standard.
QUESTION:

Our ~~

Didn't Dunlop suggest that maybe it's more

than just a little deference?
MR. PRANKED:
QUESTION:

Pardon?
Didn't Dunlop v, Baehowski suggest that

there's more than a little deference has to be given to the
Secretary's determination?
MR. PRANKED:

If the Secretary had issued a

standard, which Unions could understand and determine whether
their rule was valid, I would agree with that, Your Honor.
The problem we have is the Secretary has never articulated
a standard which tells any Union whether its meeting attendance
rule will pass muster or won't.
QUESTION:

We have no way of knowing.

401(e) says nothing about any authority

of the Secretary to decide what's reasonable, does it?
MR. FRANKED:
QUESTION:

No, it does not.

It's all ~

But he does administer the Act, doesn't

he?
MR. PRANKED:

He administers the statute, and —

QUESTION; Surely something must flow from that.

We

25

don’-'r. administer the Act.
MR. FRANKED:

That’s correct.

And I am not saying,

you know,/ that this regards)what the Secretary saysj I’m not
suggesting that.

But I’m saying that -the Secretary has to come

up with a standard which tells labor unions ~~ given the fact
that he says masting attendance rules are all right -- which
tells the labor union whether its rule is reasonable or not.
If you were drafting a meeting attendance rule, with
the Secretary's current standard •— and we fa os that problem —
if you were a Delegate trying to decide whether a meeting
attendance rule was reasonable under the Secretary’s approach
or not, how would you .know?
QUESTION:

Well, does the actual attendance record

have a bearing in evaluating the reasonableness?
MR. FRANKEL:

Not of this rule, Your Honor, because

the member has it within his power to attend or not to attend
and the burden is not an onerous one.
If the member didn’t have it within his power, if,
by some pre-ordained regulation or rule, the incumbents had
control over who came and who didn’t, or how many people were
eligible and how many weren't, then I would agree that the
number who meet the rule, or who choose to comply with it,
that that would b® relevant.
But. if it’s within the member’s free choice, and if
the requirement is not a burdensome one, then we don’t think

26

you should be able' to judge the rule on the basis of whether
the members choose, to comply or not,

That's not a reason,

that's not a basis for determining the validity of a rule,
whether people comply with it.

So long

so long, 1 emphasize

this vary heavily — as 'the meeting hall is accessible and
the burden isn't asking too much of th© member.

That's all

we're saying,
QUESTION:

I talce it this is a direct enforcement

sort of statute, to enforce it the Secretary goes to court,
MR, FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor,
It's not an administrative proceeding.

MR, FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

No,
And so it;!s like the antitrust laws,

the Department of Justice just files a lawsuit.
MR, FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

Upon the complaint of a member, yes.

And so the Secretary in this case, like

the Attorney General, is asserting some construction of the law
in court,
MR. FRANKEL:

That's correct.

QUESTION: But there's no previous administrative
determination he makes that: is binding on you, in the absence
of a court action.

Right?

MR, FRANKEL:

That's correct. Your Honor.

decides to sue, is what he does.
QUESTION;

He

And —

well, then his administrative bulletin

21

is more in the nature of advice as to the kind of cases ha
will initiatef rather than an approval.
MR. FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

That’s essentially it, Your Honor.
Like a speech of the Assistant Attorney

General in charge of Antitrust Division.
MR. FRANKEL:

Well., Your Honor, I hesitate to say

any felling about antitrust.
QUESTION;

All right.

MR. FRANKEL:
point.

Your Honor, I would say one concluding

If we’re going to look at effects, why not look to see

whether in fact the Steelworker rule entrenches Local Union
officers?
The Secretary has never dona that.
And the facts are that
QUESTION;

To see whether it entrenches what?

MR. FRANKEL:

Entrenches incumbent officers,

perpetuates incumbents in office.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. FRANKEL:

The facts are, within the Steelworkers,

that there are always contests.

In this case, the complainants

who lost in — was one of two losing candidates in 1970,
defected an incumbent in 1973.
And we have cited in our brief, there are wholesale
changes in officers in this Local, where .! wholesale changes
throughout the Steelworkers — on© case I tried, Local 1293,

28
an incumbant president had naver won up until the date of
that trial.

And entire slates were — to put it as the

staff representatives put it — were wiped out.
The point is that if there is any measure , any
measure at all, of whether 'the rule is valid in terms of
impact# that would be it, not whether the members choose to
comply.
Thank you. Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rupp.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P, RUPP, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RUPP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court;
Petitioners5 burden has been to convince this Court
that their meeting attendance rule is reasonable under
Section 401(e) of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure
Act.
Despite the fact that during the 1970 election it
disqualified 96.5 percent of the members of Local 3489 from
standing for office, and despite the fact that, it requires
dissident Union members fco plan their candidacies as early as
18 months prior to the election.
QUESTION:

Even that assumes, though, does it not,

•feat they are going to attend all the meetings after that,
but have attended none before?

29
MRc RUPP:

Well, I say "as early as'3»

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. RUPP;

And Is 11 return to that in a moment..

But so long as the person desiring to run for office
has not attended a significant number of meetings in the
early part of the term, the burden that can result from
operation of the rule is a requirement to attend all 18
meetings preceding the election.
QUESTION;

Isn’t there a possibility that there is

one Steelworker who is interested enough in the Union to go
to the meetings without running for office?
MR. RUPP:

Yes . Mr. Jusfci.ce Marshall, there is.

QUESTION: Well, what does that do to your figures?
You don't know how many — how many workers there are like
that, do we?
MR. RUPP:

We don’t know

well, we do have some

indication from fch© record —
QUESTION;

You know, there's some joiners, they

just like to go to meetings.
MR. RUPP;

There are some people, of course, who are

interested in attending union meetings, who see some use —
QUESTION; That's not included in your figure, is it?
MR. RUPP:

Yes. it is.
I

QUESTION;

Well, how many ~~ how many are there?

MR. RUPP;

The register, the meeting attendance

30

register in this case, reflects the number of members who
attended each and every meeting during the three-year period
preceding the 1970 election.

What the teller did in this

case, and in other cases involving Steelworker Locals, is to
compute from that attendance register the number of people who
were qualified to stand for office by virtue of their
attendance, actual attendance at meetings.
In this case, the results of those tabulations were
that 22 members of this local were eligible to stand for
*

office in 1970.
So we do know that the top here, so far as meeting
attendance, actual meeting attendance is concerned, was 22
members.
Now, some of those members obviously went to those
meetings, not having any present or developed intention of
running for office.
QUESTION:

How many went to one less than the

number of meetings?
MR. RUPP: We know that three members went to more
than 15 meetings but fewer than 18.
QUESTION:

Well, how many went to 12 meetings?

MR. RUPP:

The record doesn't, reflect that.

QUESTION:

That's right.

MR. RUPP:

Yes, the record doesn't reflect that

That's all I'm trying to

say.

31

Petitioners have rested their defense of the rule
on three related objectives which, in their view; the rule is
designed to serve:

Assurance that would-be office holders have

an interest in the Union and Union affairs? assurance of
capable Union leadership? and encouragement of attendance at
msstings.
But at no time have petitioners attempted to
demonstrate that these, objectives cannot be met by methods
or requirements that trench less severely on the goals of
the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, and
particularly the ©lection provisions of Titi® IV, than dees
til© rule involved in this ease*
QUESTION:

Didn’t you, Mr, Rupp? have to have the

burden of proof, and wasn’t I mistaken a while ago when I
said that Mr. Justice Stevens had perhaps not stated the issue
correctly?

I think he did stats it correctly.
This is not an administrative proceeding, this is

a lawsuit in "which you had the burden of proof„ isn’t it?
MR.. RUPP:

I believe that the Secretary did have the

burden of proof, that is right.
QUESTION: And the test is whether or not you proved
that these were not reasonable?
MR. RUPP:

That is correct.

Now, I ara not prepared to say, though, that the
Secretary’s determination is not entitled to some weight.

32

Perhaps it is entitled to ~~

No. We are not — the Secretary is

QUESTION:

Is he a plaintiff in the ordinary seas®,

not

or is he a plaintiff in a representative sense?
MR. RUPP: That is a point that I want to male®.

He’s

The Secretary is not entitled to a presumption in his
favor.

H© is not entitled —
QUESTION:

Any more than the Justice Department is

when it brings an antitrust suit; is -that correct?
MR. RUPP:

I think that he is entitled to somewhat

greater weight —
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. RUPP; Because the legislative history of this
Act, as this Court found in the Hotel Employees case, and in
the Glass Bottle Blowers case, the decision to entrust the
administration of this statute to the Secretary of Labor —
QUESTION;

As the administration ©£ the antitrust

33
laws are entrusted to the Justice Department, too, aren't
they?
MR. RUPP;

Yes, they are, but not in quite the same

sense.
This is an administrative official, in this esse,
partaking very largely of prosecutorial functions
QUESTION:

So does the Assistant Attorney General,

the head of the Antitrust Division.
QUESTION:

He sure is.

MR. RUPP:

Well, that is correct.

to make a big point of this.

And I don't want

We — our position, our basic

position is that the case has bean made her© that this rule
is unreasonable.
QUESTION: And you do, then, concede that you would
have the burden of proving that, as the plaintiff in a federal
court?
MR. RUPP: And I do concede that the Secretary has
the burden.
QUESTION:

Isn't the purpose of committing the

enforcement function to the Secretary, and denying the
individual member ths right to sue, wasn't that designed to
screen out frivolous claims and protect the unions from
having to defend too many claims of this kind?
imposes an even harder

Which perhaps

a more severe burden on you.

MR. RUPP: Well, that may have been one of the motive??.

34
Another is that centralized control by an administra­
tive official, an official of the United States Government,
having some expertise in this matter, was thought

to be

benefi cient.
There was also a requirement in the Act, as. you know,
for the exhaustion of internal administrative remedies, within
the rani on.
QUESTION:
MR. RUPP:

And the individual can't sue, himself?
He cannot.

QUESTION:
QUESTION:

No.
He cannot.

And the Secretary is required

to investigate and make a decision as to whether to sue or not.,
MR. RUPP:

That is correct.

QUESTION: And his decision not to sue is reviewable,
MR. RUPP:

I believe that it is.

QUESTION:

And, in that, it's different from the

antitrust situation, where, in the antitrust, there may be
complaints filed in fch© Antitrust Division, but nobody is
about to review the Assistant Attorney General’s decision
not to file & lawsuit.
MR. RUPP:

s

That is correct.

It's also different

tiian a situation QUESTION:

Wall, at any rat©, you can sue under the

antitrust laws.
MR. RUPP:

An individual can sue

35

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. RUPP:

Yes. Yes.

QUESTION:

That’s the difference.

MR. RUPP:

We submit *~~ our basic submission here

is that th© Secretary has shown, by overwhelming evidence,
tii© unreasonableness of -this rule.
QUESTION; What rule would be reasonable?
MRa RUPP;

Well, let me say that th© Secretary*s

regulation — which were promulgated by the Secretary in an
effort to provide some guidance to unions affected by the
Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.., ~~ lists a
number of factors that are to be taken into account in
determining th© reasonableness of a rule.
At on© point the Secretary indulged in a presumption
that a meeting attendance rule, extending over a two-year
period of time and requiring no more than 50 percent
attendance at the meetings that occurred during that period,
would be reasonable absent extraordinary circumstances.
Th© Secretary5s experience under this Act, since
1959, has led him to conclude that an inflexible approach of
that sort is not warranted.
Th© factors that th® Secretary presently considers
are the relationship of the qualifications to the legitimate
needs and interests of ths Union, th® relationship of the
qualification’s to to© demands for Union office, the impact of

36
fch© qualification in percentage terms * and the burden that
this particular qualification entails.
QUESTION:
why?

This is what th© Secretary considered*

As a predicate to whether or not he*s going to bring a

suit?

MR. RUPP:
Now* that
QUESTION:

That's correct.
•
Is that the only reason why he

considers these -things?
MR. RUPP:

He's providing — what he is attempting

to do is provide guidance to unions that are affected by the
statute.
QUESTION;

Yes* but whan a particular case coxn.es up,

he goes through this process that you've described for us,
only to determine whether or not he's going to file a lawsuit,
does he?
MR. RUPP;

Well, he goes through it in the first

instance to decide whether to contact the International Union
or the Local involved, to attempt to convince them to change
the rule.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. RUPP: There is that kind of an administrative
process, if I can call it that, that precedes the filing of a
complaint.

An effort is mad© in every case to try to resolve

differences between the Secretary and th® Union, short of

\

37
litigation.

Only if those efforts have failed, and the

Secretary concludas that the requirement is unreasonable,
does the Secretary go to court.
And while the record here does not show the number
of cases in which an amicable, or somewhat less than amicable,
settlement is achieved, it is achieved in a number of casesc
QUESTION;

Well, that’s true.

I've heard lots of

litigation is settled before it gets to court.
Isn’t it true that the legislative history of this
1959 legislation indicates that the purpose of this provision
was to guard against the unfair or inequitable continuation
in office of incumbent union leadership?
MR. RUPP;
QUESTION;
MR. RUPP;

That is one of -the purposes.
Well, wasn’t that the purpose?
It was not — well, perhaps — simply

stated, perhaps that is the purpose, the overriding purpose.
But Congress also had other kinds of things in mind that are
related to avoiding the perpetuation in office of incumbent
leadership, by incumbent leadership.
QUESTION;

Y®3„

MR, RUPP;

Congress had in mind permitting Union

members to have a free and democratic voice in Union affairs,
QUESTION;

In order to accomplish that basic

legislative purpose, in order to avoid the risk of unfairly
or inequitably continuing incumbent leadership.

Isn't that

38
right?
MRe RUPP:

Yes.

QUESTION:

That was the purposef wasn’t it?

MR, RUPP:

Yes,

Yes, that's the overriding purpose,

QUESTION: And shouldn’t that,, therefore, be the
focus of the Secretary’s inquiry as to any rule in determining
whether or not it's reasonable, to find out whether it would
tend to perpetuate,unfairly perpetuate incumbent Union leader­
ship,

And he could determine feat by normal, rational

predictive, intellectual processes, or — to which would be
contributed the past history, wouldn't that be true?
And not a word of what you read us of that bureau­
cratic gofabledy-gook mentioned anything about the tendency to
perpetuat® in office incumbent Union leadership? did it?
MR, RUPP:

Well, it is fee Secretary’s position

feat if one or two percent of the membership are eligible to
run for office, because of a candidacy restriction, that is
prima facie evidence of a violation of the Act,

I don’t

know what one —
QUESTION:
MR, RUPP:

What has that to do wife respect to -I don't know precisely how on© would

prove that there has been a kind of entrenchment,
QUESTION: By looking at the record, that’s how you
prove it.

That there has been or hasn't been,
MR, RUPP:

One would, never know precisely whether

39

those people were, maintained in office because they happen
to be enlightened leadership and they were able to carry on
the business —
QUESTION:

Well, if they were not maintained in

office, then you would know that, in any event, incumbent
leadership had not been maintained in office,
MR. RUPP: Well, but Congress' purpose here was not
to turn out Union officers t in fact, —
QUESTION:

But if in fact the record showed they

had not been, you wouldn't need to take Step Two, would you?
MR, RUPP:

If the record showed that they had not

been turned out, it would not
QUESTION;

Had not been retained.

Then that would

be the end of it.
MR, RUPP;

No, I do not believe that is the case.

We may well have a situation in which there is a
turnover — in which there is a turnover in the principal
Union offices among a relatively small coterie of people.
QUESTION:

You mean just passing the office back and

MR. RUPP:

Yes, passing the office back and forth,

forth?

We*ve a&en that.
QUESTION:
MR. RUPP;
QUESTION;

Yes.
That's not what Congress had in mind,
No.

40

MR. RUPP:

Congress had in mind that everyone, ev«2y

Union member in good standing should have the opportunity to
run for office subject to reasonable qualifications uniformly
imposed.
Now, the
QUESTION:

But my basic question was simply this ,

and I hope you will direct yourself to it:

If I'm correct,

and you tell me if I am, in ray understanding of the — what
the legislative history shows to be -the purpose of this
legislation, i.e., to prevent the continuation in office of
incumbent leadership by unfair means.

Than why shouldn’t the

focus of the Secretary’s inquiry in determining whether or not
these are reasonable rules be whether or not they have the
tendency to promote that purpose that Congress thought was

undesirable?
MR. RUPP:

Well, the focus of the Secretary’s

inquiry is on whether Union members have had an opportunity
for a free and democratic election, which is perhaps another
way of stating your point.

In the process of determining whether that has
occurred in a particular case, -the Secretary looks at a
variety of factors, including whether -there has been s.
continuation in office of the same people. But -that can never
be conclusive, because the — those people may have been
continued in office for entirely legitimate reasons.

41
But when the Sscre.ta.ry also sees, in addition to or
perhaps even when the entrenchment is not clear , that only a
very small number of people are eligible to run for office in
any given election, that a particular candidacy qualification
imposes substantial burdens on members desiring to run for
office, and those burdens are not justified in fee Secretary's?
view by the objectives of the particular qualification, fee
Secretary believes he has the duty to bring the lawsuit, and
believes that the particular qualification is unreasonable,
QUESTION:

Mr. Hupp, if I can get you back to my

original question, how could a Union lawyer, looking at what
you just read me about ten minutes ago, and draw up a rule
that would be acceptable?
MR* RUPP:

It is difficult, I will concede, to

deal -QUESTION: Would you admit it's impossible?
MR. RUPP:
QUESTION:

No, I will not.
No, I said one that is sure to pass

muster.
MR. RUPP;

No, I —

QUESTION:

Sure I said.

That's impossible.
MR. RUPP:

Well, if "sure" means 100 percent

assurance, than it's impossible.
QUESTION:

In this study you're working with it,

42

I’m not •too sure you could draw one.

Under those rules.

Because they don’t say one month, two months, six
years, eight years, one percent, eleven percent; it has nothing
that you can put your finger on.
QUESTION; Would one way ~-~
MR. RUPP;
QUESTION:

Well, w® have to recall -chat -Would on© way to get at this be to look

at the actual attendance records which, in this case, on this
record, shows that only 22 out of 660 people were eligible
for a number of union offices, and the Secretary might
appropriately, to answer this inquiry, look to what figures
would enable on©-fourth, let us say, of the 660 to be
eligible, and then fix the attendance requirements to fit that
larger number?
MR. RUPP;

Well, —

QUESTION; The only point is
MR. RUPP:

— of course, it would be ideal if we —

if that kind of predictability were possible, and perhaps in
some Unions it is.
QUESTION; And when you do that, would you also
realise that this is an International Union — with how many
Locals?
MR. RUPP:

With 5,200 Locals.

QUESTION:

And

you’re going to get a rule that

this Local, the 5,000 Locals all lose because of this on®

43
Local?
MR a RUPP:

No# that's not the case»

If you. look at the cases cited in the government's
brief# on page 25# I believe# the data cited an page 25 of
the government's brief# you will find that the situation we
have, here# because of the operation of this three-year 50 per­
cent meeting attendance requirement# has been about the same
in all other Locals that, the Secretary has brought suit.
We believe# in most other Locals#
QUESTION:

*

I*m not talking about -that# I'm talking

about — not the ones where he brought suit# I'm talking about
the other 5#000.
MR. RUPP:

Well# —

QUESTION: Because# isn't your position that this
entire provision goes out?
MR. RUPP:

Our position is precisely that.

QUESTION; So that means all 5.000 Locals.
MR. RUPP: But the reason is nbt only because it
happens to eliminate# to disqualify from seeking Union office#
in most cases in which it is applied# 90# 95# 98 percent of
the Union membership.
It is also because it places a very significant#
unjustified burden on people desiring to run for Union office.
The Steelworkers have a relatively easy task# we believe, so
far as the first aspect of the decision# that they have to make»

44

That is, w© believe that that a three-year 50 percent
meeting attendance requirement is unreasonable.

Unreasonable

without snore.
QUESTION;
MR. RUPP;

what is reasonable?

In the Steelworkers.

Well, it’s exceedingly difficult for me

to stand here and say that the Secretary is going to say that
a two-year 50 percent, rule is okay, that a one-year 50 percent
rule is okay? w@ don * t have that experience in the Steelworkers»
Union.
QUESTION; Well, what is reasonable?
Isn’t that important?
MR. RUPP;
QUESTION:

The reasonable rule —
Isn't that what we are to decide,

whether it’s reasonable or not?
MR. RUPP;

Yes,, that is correct,

QUESTION; Right.

Isn't a part of that — could bs,

very well, as to what is reasonable?
MR. RUPP*
QUESTION;
MR. RUPP;

Yes, of course.
Well, what is?
I simply cannot give you a precise rule.

The matter is more complicated than that.

It requires more

knowledge of the dynamics than I have.
QUESTION; Well, is it any more a requirement now to
fix that figure than it was for the judge who was trying this
case originally?

45
The judge trying this case originally was presented
with the negative question;

Is this unreasonable?

MR. RUPP;

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Hot the affirmative: What is reasonable?

If you prevail in this lawsuit; then the Secretary
has the burden of going forward; does he not?
MR. RUPP;

The Steelworkers will then look at the

situation that prevails; and they are now 5,200 Locals, there
were 3700 Locals at the time tills litigation began- will
attempt to structure a rule, either a meeting attendance rule
or some other rule- to serve the objectives that they believe
ought to be served- encouragement of attendance at meetings.
The Secretary will then look at the operation of that rule,
in particular Locals, as many Locals as possible, and try to
reach, a determination concerning its reasonableness.
QUESTION;
saems to me.

Well, that just leaves them at sea, it

If you —

MR. RUPP:
QUESTION:

Well, to some extent, —If you look at it as a question of fact,

the trial judge here found that it was. reasonable., it’s the
kind of thing that you say is like a jury determination.
^-

Now, obviously, you don’t mean that.

And if it’s not a fact

question or a jury determination type of thing, it «fughfc to be
capable of some articulation, if these people, are going to be
guided.

46

: -;lKo RUPP:

Wail* it certainly Is not a fact

question- there are factual disputes involved in this record#
I think, that are minor; it is very largely a question of law.
Again, part of the difficulty here, I think:# stems
from the fact that what Congress did here was to say -that
any meeting# any qualification for candidacy has to be
reasonable.

That terms has content# but it has content — it,

develops specific content in the process of administering the
statute# in the process of the court's looking at the impact
of particular rules# in the context of particular Locals.
Mow# it seems quite unlikely to me that the
Secretary is going to challenge a meeting attendance requirement
that extends for a year and requires attendance at 50 percent
of the meetings.
We know that. a. number of International Unions havesuch rules.

The Secretary has not moved against, such rules.

There are some additional, a few additional unions that have
two~year rules that require 50 percent attendance at those
meetings.
Again# the Secretary has not thus far challenged
those rules because# at this point# they appear to be
operating reasonably.
reasonably.

They appear to be administered

And they are responsive to bona fida union

objectives.
If the Steelworkers are concerned about being caught

■

: 3S" , ilOt

knowing precisely where to turn, one suggestion that i
might pursue is to look at what is occurring among unions
elsewhere.
This rule is virtually unique in trade union
practice; only one other International Union has a three-year
SC percent moating attendance requirement* That Union requires
attendance; at two meetings during the first year# two' meetings
during the second year, and three meetings during the third
year, fox- a total of seven meetings.
The Steelworkers require 18.
We know of no other case involving a- rule that so
uniformly and consistently disqualifies 90, 95, 98 percent
of the membership from standing for office.
QUESTION;

Mr. Rupp, what does

does the record

tall us what would happen in this case, if there were less
people who were eligible to run than there were vacant
offices?
That could happen, I suppose,.
MR. RUPP:

Yes.

We do know what happens in'

Under the long-standing practice of this

Union, if no on© is eligible to seek the office, the Union
permits an otherwise ineligible person to rim unopposed for
this particular office.
QUESTION: Does the record tall us whether that*s a
purely a Local practice or whether that's consistent with
the International constitution?
MR. RUPP:

I don't think the record tells us.

Now, let me also add a ccuple of figures that I think
are illustrative and go to Mr. Justice Stewart's point about
entrenchment.

That is, of -the 13 people who ran in this

Local in 1970, six were incumbents.

Most of those ran to

fill offices, all but on© or two, ran to fill offices and
were -unopposed in the election.
Ml incumbents prevailed in the election.

Which

means that incumbents retained control in this Union in. 1970,
of six of the ten offices.

The only offices for which ther©

was opposition were the offices of president and trustee.
For president, there were three candidates; for trusteeships,
of which there ar® three, there were four candidates.

Of

6SO members, 22 were, found to be eligible .by virtue of having
attended — by virtue of their having attended the requisite
number of meetings.

An additional member was found to be

eligible by a combination of meeting attendance?, credits, and

49
me@ti.ng attendance.
Now, the Steelworkers dispute the Court of Appeals5
finding that there were only 23 eligible members here»

it

seems to us that that challenge comes much too late.
‘There is evidence in the record, there is testimony
in the record involving the Labor Department's investiga*aor,
and the question is, 151 believe this has been asked* ~ it came
at the end of government counsel’s questions of the Labor
Department’s investigator — *1 believe this question has been
asked.

However, to be sure, based on your investigation of

the attendance register and the work credits of Strail Sceel,
the employer, were there any other members of the defendant
Local other than Mr« LaRue eligible by virtue of a combination
of attendance credits and work credits?”
The answer was sa«
QUESTION;

Incidentally, how many of the 23 are

incumbents'?
MR, RUPP;

Are incumbents?

Nine or ten.

So half

of —
QUESTION; Almost half.
MR. RUPP;

That’s right.

Now, that means that of the non-incumbent officers
of this Union in 1970, less than two percent of the membership
were eligible to run for office.
Now, I might bring to the Court's attention a case

50

that was decided by the First Circuit a couple of days ago,
a panel comprised of Mr. Justice Clark and Judges McEntee and
Campbell* involving a rule of the Amalgamated Transit Union,
This was a two-year rule, and it required attendance at six
meetings for each of those years.
The court held that that rule was unreasonable.
Its reasoning, inessence, was that that rule* like this rule*
requires people desiring to run for office to plan, -their
candidacies as early as 18 months prior to the election.
QUESTION:
MR, RUPP:

Is that decision cited?
We don: t have a cite yet* but, I have

given copies to the Clerk of the Court.
QUESTION: What's the name of it?
MR. RUPP:

The name of the case is Usery vs. Local

Division 1205 —
QUESTION:
MR. RUPP:
Transit Union.

Usery?
Usery* yes.

-— of the Amalgamated

And* as I say* —

QUESTION:
MR. RUPP:

You say you circulated copies of it?
I have provided copies to the Clerk* and

he will circulate them, I believe.
So* again* it seems to roe that the principal problems
with this rule are too.
First.- it disqualifies the vast majority of the
members of Local Steelworkers Union from seeking standing for

51
of fica.
Secondly, it places an enormous burden on people
desiring to run for office. That is. it requires them to plan
■

their nominations, their candidacies as early as 18 months
prior to the election.
The justifications 'that have been advanced by the
Steelworkers for the rule ar© basically three:

encouragement

©£ attendance of meetings: assurance that would-be office
holders have an interest in Onion affairs? and assurance of
cap'ab1© union leadership.
While the Secretary doss not. believe that meeting
attendance rules are not responsive to any bona fide Union
objectives,, he does not believe that this meeting attendance
rule is sufficiently related to those objectives to justify
the burdens and the effects of the rule.
There is no showing her©, for examplef that a twoyear 50 percent meeting attendance rul© would not have been
as efficacious in serving the goals that the Steelworkers say
they are attempting to serve her® as does their three-year 50
parcent rule*
QUESTION:

Isn't that putting the burden of proof

on the wrong party, when you make -that argument?
MR. RUPP:

Well, the Secretary's position is that

th© rul© is unreasonable because it disqualifies over 90 percent
of the Union members from seeking office and requires them to

52

plan their candidacies IB months in advance of the election.
QUESTION; And you had the burden of proving that.
MR. RUPP;

We believe ~~ yes, and we believe we

have proved that.
QUESTION;

~~ In a court.

MR. RUPP;

Yes. And we believe we have proved that.

We believe it is unreasonable without more.
At a minimum, however, w® believe that it is
unreasonable unless there are overwhelming justifications.
W® don't think that the Steelworkers have advanced any in this
case.
QUESTION: Wall, is it your position, the government’s",
position that the Secretary in the first instance, and the
district, judge dealing with it in the case, is entitled to
reach, these conclusions on the basis of the tendency of this
kind of an attendance rule to undermine democratic principles
in. the government of the Unions?
MR. RUPP; The-goal is free and democratic elections.
It seems to me incredible.

This Court itself has analogized

Section 401(e) to political elections generally.

!.That is,

that Congress had in mind, when it structured democratic
elections for Unions, elections for the populace at large.
It seams inconceivable to ms that this Court would
long tolerate a qualification on candidacy that disqualified
96 to 98 percent of the eligible American voters for standing

53

for public office.
QUESTION;

We’ve upheld a 15-year residency

raq ui remenfc.
MR. RUPP;

Well, this Union has what is, in essence,

a, residency requirement.

It’s not 15 years, but there was

not — but this Court has never been confronted with data of
this sort, evidence of this sort, —
QUESTION: What do you think a 15-year residency
requirement would do to some place like Florida or Arizona?
How many people —
MR. RUPP:

I do not believe that it would disqualify

96.5 percent or 98 pereant of those people who do not
presently hold office from seeking office in Florida*
It’s inconceivable that it would.
And it’s difficult to believe that if it did it
would b© held to b© constitutional,,
It’s difficult to conceive of a qualification —■ I
think impossible to conceive of a qualification in the political
arena, generally, that would disqualify that kind of people
and place a I8-month burden on their candidacies, and that
this Court would still find that it was constitutional»
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Rupp.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Franks!?
QUESTION: Well, just before you sit down, there's no

54
consfcitufcional

question, involved in tills case.- s.s thex®.'

MR. RUPP:

No, there is no Constitutional question.

QUESTION:

I didn't think so.

MR. RUPP:

The question is one of statute.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARL B. FRANKEL, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FRANKEL:

Mr. Chief Justice# may it please the

Court:
Just a couple of quick points.
One# th© average attendance was 47 —— i didn't; know
whether I had said that at this masting# and although only
22 met th© eligibility requirement# th© average attendance at
meetings was 47.
Counsel for th© Secretary has made a point which I
have never heard the Secretary make in any of th© meeting
attendance cases until now# and that is# that our ruo.e imposed
a burden on members.

He has never taken th© position that

th© requirement of attending on© meeting ©very other month
was a burdensome requirement on members.
QUESTION:

I understood him to say it was a burden

on those who wanted to be candidates.
MR. FRANKEL:
QUESTION:

Well# —

It is a burden on candidacies if only 22

are eligible# would you not agree?
MR. FRANKEL:

Well# we get back to th© other point#

55
Your Honor.

I have difficulty trying to conclude, or

concluding that a rule which is not difficult for a member to
comply with is unreasonable because he chooses not to comply
)

with it.
QUESTIONs And you don’t, think that’s effected by
■fchis enormous number who do not comply with that?
MR» FRANKEL:

They chose not to# Your Honor.

mean that’s a decision they had.

I

So long as we don’t make it

difficult for them, they choose to stay

away*, that’s a

decision -that they have made.
Now, the other point that die Secretary has made is
tliat 'til® regulation is to guide Unions, furnish guidance to
Unions, and, as w® pointed out, it doesn’t furnish any
guidance at all.

No on® could conceivably draft a rule after

looking at that regulation that 'the Secretary has issued.
The other problem with the impact, that is, the
members who are eligible, that would disqualify any meeting
attendance rule, because you wouldn't know.

It would be

possible with the one-year rule, with a two-year rule, to have
96 percent.

You could have the simplest, requirement in the

world —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. FRANKELs

Oh, I’m sorry.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. FRMJKEL:

Your time has expired, —

— Mr. Frank®1.

I thought I had reserved more.

Thank you. Your Honor.
MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

Tfo® case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
