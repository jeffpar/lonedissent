ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. REESE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. REESE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The issue before the Court in this case today con­
cerns the constitutionality of the Delaware sequestration
statute as it was applied to seize the property of some 21 non­
resident defendants in an action having no substantial relation­
ship to the State of Delaware.

This is an appeal from a decision

of the Delaware Supreme Court upholding that application of the
statute.
This is a shareholder's derivative suit brought by
the holder of one share of stock of the Greyhound Corporation
against some 28 individual defendants.

The action is alleged

to be brought on behalf of Greyhound and its subsidiary Grey­
hound Lines, Inc., both of which have their principal places of
business in Phoenix, Arizona.
The Greyhound Corporation is a Delaware corporation.
Greyhound Lines, Inc. is incorporated in California.
Now, the individual defendants are 28 present, or
former officers or directors or in some cases employees of

4
either on® or the other* of those companies,
QUESTION:

Do each one of the 28 fulfill what you

have just stated, either an officer or director or a key em­
ployee?
MR. REESE:

No, Mr. Justice Blackman.

tried to put it in the conjunctive.

That is why I

Some are officers, seme

are directors, some are both —
QUESTION:
MR. REESE:

But all are one or the other?
That's right.

Some of them hold no posi­

tion with the Delaware corporation.

It is worth noting that at

this point.

Seme of the individual defendants have only held,

positions with the. California corporation.
Now, as I said, none of the defendants is a resident
of the State of Delaware.
ly.

Neither is the plaintiff, incidental­

So far as the record in this case shoxvs, no defendant has

ever even been in Delaware or done any act in that state.

The

conduct charged against them in the complaint occurred far
from D©laware.
The essence of those charges is that the individual
defendants ought to be. held liable for the reason that the
companies are found to have violated a court order and because
the companies suffered an adverse verdict in an antitrust case
that is still on appeal and not yet final.

But those charges

aren't before the Court.
Today the issue is whether the Delaware sequestration

5
statute can constitutionally be applied to sequester -the de­
feats 6 stock as a. means for coercing their general appearance
in the action.
Delaware has no long-arm statute applicable to individuaIs.
process.

None of these defendants was personally served with
Instead, the plaintiff obtained an ex parte order

from the Court of Chancery in Delaware seizing any property
that the defendants had in the state.

In this case, the

property seized consisted primarily of capital stock issued by
a Delaware corporation.
The seizure was effected by an order to the corpora­
tion directing it not to effect any transfers of those shares
on its books.

The certificates themselves were not seized and

they couldn’t bs seized because they are not in. Delaware either.
Delaware accomplishes the seizure then -QUESTION;

Under the uniform commercial code, am I

incorrect in my memory that 'the situs of the certificates is
the situs of the stock?
MR. REESE;

Well, under the uniform commercial code

a3 applied in every state except Delaware, Mr. Justice Stewart,
the certificate itself must be seized in order to effect an
attachment.
QUESTION:
MR. REESE;

That is what I thought.
Delaware alone adopted the. contrary rule,

namely that the situs of 'the stock is deemed to be in the state

6
of incorporation of the issuing corporation.
QUESTION;

That has always been the Delaware law,

hasn't it?
MR. REESE;

As far as I know, that has always been

the Delaware rule.
QUESTION;

And that is very much the minority rule,

you say, just as a matter of situs of property?
MR. REESE;
holding that rule.

At this point, Delaware is unique in
Every other jurisdiction has adopted those

provisions of the commercial code that embody the stock in the
certificate.
QUESTION;

Yes.

QUESTION;

Mr, Reese, you don't challenge the consti­

tutional power of the State of Delaware to so locate the situs
of -the stock, or do you?
MR. REESE;

It depends on the purpose for which the

state uses that legal fiction, Mr. Justice Stevens.

We do

challenge the power of the stats to use that fiction for the
purpose of asserting jurisdiction over nonresident defendants
or to adjudicate their rights in that stock.
QUESTION;
MR. REESE:

You mean even to the value of the stock?
It is not necessary to reach that ques­

tion in this case.
QUESTION:
MR. REESE;

Well, you just reached it.
Our position is that a fictional situs

7
for an intangible property is an insufficient basis for
adjudication of personal rights.
QUESTION:

Well, even if Delaware could subject a

property to a judgment, your point is they can’t compel

use

that property to coup©1 personal jurisdiction?
MR. REESE:

Correct.

QUESTION:

That's all you need to decide in this case?

MR. REESE;

That’s all w@ need to decide in this case.

QUESTION:
same coin:

May I ask you this, the other side of the

If the certificates ware in fact in the State of

Delaware, wouldn’t you be making the same argument?
MR. REESE:

Well, wa might be making sane of our same

argument, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't you be making the same

basic argument that my Brother White has just identified, that
you can't us© that in order to obtain personal jurisdiction?
MR. REESE:

W© would still be objecting to the coer­

cive purpose and effect -~
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t your argument be the same?

MR. REESE:

Yes, Your Honor.
%

QUESTION:

It is fiction in any event, because the

certificate is only a certificate.

It isn’t the property; it

i.s just the certificate of ownership — any more -than the situs
of the issuing corporation is the property, wherever you are
going to locate the situs, it is going to fo© something of a

8
fiction, isn’t, it?
MR. REESE:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
And even though Delaware followed, the

majority rule and said that the situs of the certificate is the
situs of the personal property, and if the certificates of the
defendants in this case all happened to be locked up in the
corporation's safe deposit box in Delaware, you would still be
making the same basic constitutional argument, would you not?
MR. REESE:

Yes, Your Honor, we would.

I think that

it is worth noting in that connection that if those certifi­
cates were there, the odds are very much greater than the de­
fendants would have had some substantial relationship with the

stats

o

QUESTION:

Well, they might be residents, but I am

assuming they are not.
MR, REESE:
QUESTION:

Okay.

That’s fine.

Mr. Reese, weald you be making the same

argument if, instead of stock certificates, one of ‘the defendants
had his brother-in-law drive his car through the state and the
car was seized?
MR. REESE:

Well, the same constitutional problems

would exist to some extent in the case of tangible property,
in the case of tangible property that is in the jurisdiction
through no fault, if you will, or without the knowledge or con­
sent of the defendant, I think the arguments would apply with

9

the sarae force.
QUESTION:
■the stock then?

So it doesn’t really turn on the situs of

Your position is basically the same, it is

unfair to seize the property and use it for this purpose of
forcing someone to enter a general appearance?
MR. REESE:

That’s correct.

And our arguments goes

to the sufficiency of the relationship between a defendant and
a jurisdiction before that jurisdiction may assert its power
over the defendant.
Nov/, we should note that the State of Delaware could
not use its sequestration procedure in this case to reach all
of the. defendants that the plaintiff sued, only those which had
something that Delaware considered to be property in the state.
As a result, seven of the named defendants are not before the
court, were not brought into the case, and are not really
parties to this appeal.
Now, there is no real dispute about how the Delaware
procedure works.

It has bean interpreted and applied by the

Delaware courts for many years, and the procedure is well
established.
First of all, it is an ex part procedure.

The order

seising the property is issued without notice or prior oppor­
tunity for hearing.

Second, that order issues automatically

if only two facts are alleged.

And the first fact is that the

defendant is a nonresident, and the second fact is that ha owns

10
property in the State of Delaware.

And if only those two facts

are alleged, -the order must issue and there is no discretion to
deny it.
QUESTION;

That resulted in a nominal bond.

$1,000,

wasn't it?
MR. REESE;

In this case, Your Honor, bond of $1,000

was posted.
QUESTION:

Mr. Reese, on that point, suppose Delaware

amended its statute to require that before the order issued
there be a probable cause hearing, it would be ex parte, maybe
service notice, but the defendant might not crane, would that
cure the defect in the statute, probable cause to show there is
merit to the complaint?
MR. REESE:

That would certainly alleviate the first

problem of lack of prior notice and opportunity for hearing.
QUESTION:
MR, REESE:

Would it make th© statute any less unfair?
It would make it less unfair.

I'm not

prepared to say that that would cur© the other defiofeneias
that exist in the statute
QUESTION:

Well, if Delaware still insisted that he

submit to personal jurisdiction in order to defend th© case,
you would have the same argument in that respect?
MR. REESE:
QUESTION:

Yes, we would.
In effect, the statute eliminates the whole

range of special appearance on the part of the defendant to

11
contest the jurisdiction of the court or for any other purpose?
MR. REESE:

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.

It

eliminates the ability of the defendant to enter a special,
appearance to contest th© jurisdiction of the court or even to
enter a limited appearance to defendant to the extent of his
property.
QUESTION;

On the merits?

MR. REESE:

On the merits.

To get this order issued ‘then, it doesn't matter who
the plaintiff is or where the plaintiff- lives, and it doesn't
matter what the claim is about or where the claim arose or
whether the claim is sound or spurious.
Mr. Justice Stevens, there is no determination what­
ever whether- that claim has any merit at all before that order

issues.
QUESTION:

In this case, nobody was a resident of

Delaware?
MR. REESE:
QUESTION s

That’s correct.
Nobody?

MR. REESE:

Well, th® only connection that Delaxvara

has with any party or anything else in this case is that on©
of the two corporate defendants happens to have been incorpor­
ated in Delaware.

None of the individual defendants nor the

plaintiff who filed th® lawsuit is a resident of Delaware.
QUESTION:

Is this statute applicable to any and all

12
kinds of lawsuits?
MR. REESE:

Auy claim brought by any plaintiff.

QUESTION:

It has to be in the Court of Chancery

though, doesn't it?
MR. REESE:

An equitable claim for the recovery of

money is the way the statute is described.
QUESTION:
not any claim?

It has to bs an equitable claim, so it is

It is any equitable claim, is that it?

MR. REESE:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
It is not applicable therefore to an ordin­

ary tort suit, is that correct, for damages?
MR. REESE:
Honor.

This particular statute is not, Your

Delaware still has a foreign attachment statute which

has some of the same characteristics as the sequestration
statute.
QUESTION:

But this one is only in the Court of

Chancery and Delaware still has the division between chancery
and Is*;, does it?
MR. REESE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Do you suggest that before a state may get

jurisdiction by attaching proparty that there must be a prior
hearing?

You don't suggest that, do you?
MR. REESE:

Well, Mr. Justice White, I think that

that depends on whether Puentes v. Shevin really continua to be
viable.
%

13

QUESTIONS

Well, I know, but getting jurisdiction is

a — a state being able to gat jurisdiction puts a considerable
different interest in the picture than is in Fuentes.
MR. REESE;

The question then, as I see it, would be

whether the purpose to obtain jurisdiction is by itself such a
significant state of interest as to justify postponing notice
and a prior opportunity for hearing.
QUESTION;

Because the state may never ever — they

give up the chance automatically by giving notice, people will
move their property?
MR. REESE:
QUESTION;

That is correct.

That is a possibility.

But in any event, you would say the stata

must give, afford the opportunity for a timely hearing to show
probable cause on the merits?
MR. REESE;

Yes, or at th© very minimum the state must

provide some kind of procedural safeguard to protect the de­
fendant.
QUESTION:
MR. REESE:

Against a mistake or for what?
Against th© seizure of property on th©

basis of a frivolous or baseless claim or whatever.

If there

is not prior notice or opportunity for hearing, then there cer­
te inly must be some kind of protective mechanism.
QUESTION:

So you think you have two independent

grounds for winning here?
MR. REESE:

At least, Your Honor.

14
QUESTION?

At least two then.

On© is that if there

is no opportunity for a hearing at all at any time, the
property must ba released;, even if it was seised to get juris­
diction.

And the second is that even if there was probable

— even if there was a hearing and even if probable cause was
shown,

the state may not condition his right to defend up to

the value of th© property on his submitting to personal juris­
diction.
MR. REESE;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
What would the hearing be directed to?

To what would the hearing be directed?
MR. REESE;

Are we talking now about a pre-seizure

hearing or a post-seizure hearing?
QUESTION;
MR. REESE;

Any hearing.
It would be directed to whether the claim

had any basis or merit..
QUESTION;
MR. REESE;
QUESTION;

vou mean the underlying claim?
The underlying claim.
It wouldn't b© directed to the question, of

whether or not this is the property of the defendants, would
it?

That was conceded.
MR. REESE;

Under Delaware law, it is, isn't it?

Under Delaware law, this is conceded to

ba property —
QUESTION:

Property of the. defendants within the

jurisdiction of Delaware.

15
MR. REESE:

Under Delaware law, that is conceded.

QUESTION:

The hearing therefore -— in other words,

there is no dispute about that, so the hearing would not be
directed to that issue, is that correct?
MR. REESE:
QUESTION:
MR. REESE:

In this case, it would not.
And so to what would it be directed?
It would b© directed to the question of

whether the underlying claim had sufficient merit to justify the
use of the state's seizure powers in the first instance.
QUESTION:

Well, that is the lawsuit.

That is the

basic lawsuit, which is going to follow.
QUESTION:
MR. REESE:

That is the probable cause hearing?
I would agree, to establish the validity

or probable validity in the language used in Guentes and North
Georgia.
QUESTION:

But that, as my brother pointed out, in-

volves different state interests, different interests and
persons and other interests.

In that case, the question was

who was entitled to the property.
MR. REESE:

That interest is not entirely divorced

from the Delaware statute either, Mr. Justice Stewart, because
under- Delawar© law the property may be retained to satisfy an
eventual judgment, if the court determines that that should be
so.

So that the statute doss serve a dual purpose.

to obtain jurisdiction and to secure judgment.

It is both

So it has that

16
aspect.

It is common to the creditor cases.
QUESTION:

But it also has, in your submission, an
jr

additional vice, this system?
MR. REESE:
QUESTION:

It has the coercive vies.
That even if there is a hearing, it has

the coercive vice.
MR. REESE:

If a defendant, in Delaware who has been

subjected to the procedure declines to submit to that coercion
and just stays away -QUESTION:
MR. REESE:

He forfeits the property?
h© forfeits the property, without any

adversary hearing whatever.

It is just gone.

Now, that is a

statute that has potentially enormous impact because, as the
appellee has pointed out, over one-half of the most important
companies in the United States have chosen Delaware as the
place to incorporate, and all of their shareholders are vulner­
able to the use of this procedure on any claim that any plain­
tiff might choose to assert against him.
QUESTION:
MR. REESE:

Any equitable claim?
Any equitable claim that any plaintiff

might choose to assert against him.
QUESTION:
MR. REESE:

Equitable claim for money?
Equitable claim for money.

Now, we sub­

mit that that procedure is not only unfair but that it is
unnecessary and it is obsolete.

It has a whole catalog of

17
defects,

I think most of them we have -touched on already,

There is no prior notice or opportunity for hearing.

There is

no consideration of -the merit either before or after the
seizure takes place.

The defendant is not permitted any right

to defend unless he submits himself to unlimited personal
jurisdiction in the state.

There is no adequate provision for

indemnifying the defendant against wrongful seizure.

The

purpose of the state is to assart personal jurisdiction over
the defendant.

But in this case none of th© defendants nor

the controversy has a substantial relationship with the State
of Delaware, and even to© property that Delaware has purported
to use as a basis for th© proceeding is located there by reason
of a legal fiction that no other state continues to accept.
QUESTION;

But I thought that, as to that last point,

you didn’t question the power of Delaware to say that in this
state the personal property, when it comes to —- we are talking
about shares of stock —- shall be the situs of th© issuing
corporation?

And if the issuing corporation is in Pennsylvania,

even though the certificates are in Delaware,' I gather that
under Delaware law the property is in Pennsylvania, is that
correct?
MR. REESE;
QUESTION;

It is my understanding, that is correct.
And did I misunderstand when I thought I

heard you say that you war® not questioning the power of
Delaware to identify the situs of toe personal property as

18

depending upon the situs of the issuing corporation?
MR. REESE:

I think in answer to Mr. Justice Stevens1

question on that point earlier, I indicated that it depends on
what the state then does with its legal fiction.

And I think

the case does raise a serious question as to whether the state
is not exercising jurisdiction over property that is not truly
within its borders.
QUESTION:

But your argument, I think you said — and

tell me if I have, misunderstood you, because it is some im­
portance — wouldn't your argument be the same if this were a
single defendant who lived in Arizona but whose automobile was
in Delaware?
MR. REESE:

Our argument would be weaker, but it

would basically follow the sama constitutional lines.
QUESTION;

Why would it?

MR. REESE:

I think ~

QUESTIQN:

If it is a constitutional matter, why

would it?
MR. REESE:

I think that the Court has previously

recognized limits on the ability of a state through the use of
fictions to deem property to b® within its borders for the
purpose of asserting jurisdiction.

The case of an intangible

fiction is surely a more questionable one than the case of a
tangible.
QUESTION:

Well, what if the claim though had nothing

19
to do with the car?

What if it was this claim, it had nothing

to do with fen© car?

The cause of action didn’t arise out of

feh© car being there or —
MR. REESE;

We would certainly be here making the

same arguments.
QUESTION;
MR. REESE;

Y©s .
The State of Delaware considers tba de­

fendants contacts or the relationship of the controversy to -the
state to be irrelevant.
QUESTION:

Well, there is nothing new about that.

In

fact, what’s new is International Shoe, if you are aa old as I
am, because back in my law school days there was no such thing
as the International Shoe doctrine and it was equite a usual
thing for every state to provide that if a lawsuit involved
real property than jurisdiction of the court existed wherever
the real property was situated.

If it involved any other kind

of a lawsuit, if there war© personal property within the juris­
diction, you could acquire personal jurisdiction to the extent
of the value of the property by quasi in rem jurisdiction.
There is nothing n®v; about this basic system, is there?
MR. REESE;

No.

The development of intangible

properties, however, calls into serious question whether you
ought to follow that same analysis for jurisdictional purpose.
QUESTION;

I thought that one of your claims was

that now that wa are in the regime of International Shoe, that

20
we should forget all those, previous devices to acquire personal
jurisdiction.
MR. REESE:

Wellr that certainly is our position.

QUESTION:

That is what I thought.

QUESTION:

Mr. Reese.- even in the times to which my

Brother Stewart refers, was it permissible to get jurisdiction
by quasi in rem method and attain a judgment for more than the
value of the property?
MR. REESE:

I'm not aware of a case that holds —•

QUESTION:

You couldn't if h© didn't show up in

QUESTION:

But could he not coma in and enter an ap­

court.

pearance and be permitted to defend without risking a judgment
in excess of the value of the property?
MR. REESE:
QUESTION:

Certainly in many jurisdictions.
Well, were there any where that was not

the case other than Delaware?
MR. REESE:

I'm not abl© to answer that question,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

That was the function of a special appear­

ance , was it not, to guard against that possibility?
MR. REESE?
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
But your position is now and I take it

always would have been that a state may not insist that the
defendant submit himself generally to the jurisdiction of the

21
court as a price for defending his property in the state?
MR. REESE;

In the absence of a relationship between

the defendant and the state.
QUESTION;
MR. REESE;

Other than just having property?
That’s right.

The court below sought to defend this procedure
largely on the basis of two cases.

One was the District Court’s

opinion in U.S. Industries v. Gregg; and the second was th©
District Court’s decision in 1921 in Ownbey v. Morgan.

Since

that time, the Third Circuit reversed the District Court de­
cision in that case, so rather than being support for th© de­
cision below, that case is now another reason for reversal.
We submit that the case of Ownbey v. Morgan does not
support the decision below either, as for several reasons.
First, Ownbey really didn’t address the question that is pre­
sented to tiiis Court.

The validity of the attachment of th©
i

defendant's property was not really in issue in Ownbey.

To the

extent there, that th© court assumed that that attachment was
valid, the appellants submit that the assumption is out of
touch with the procedural due process concepts that this Court
has developed and articulated in fell© approximately sixty years
since Ownbey was decided.
At t!i© time Ownbey was decided, it may well have been,
that an attachment to secure jurisdiction over a nonresident
defendant was the only way yen could get jurisdiction over him.

22
But as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, sine® International
Shoe was decided about thirty years ago, that has no longer
been a valid assumption,

And to put it simply, we think that

Ownbey reflects a time and a stage of analysis of the Consti­
tution that has been superseded.
I would like to reserve the rest of my time for re­
buttal, Mr, Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

In other words, International Shoe didn't

provide an alternative criterion of due process constitution­
ality but provided a new on© that implicitly overruled the old
one?
MR. REESE:

Yes,

QUESTION:

Right?

MR. REESE:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Maschio — did I pro­

nounce your name correctly?
MR. MASCHIO:

Yes, you did.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL F. MASCHIO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. MASCHIO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue before this Court is whether the present
use of til© Delaware sequestration statute in the case at bar
has deprived these appellants of their Fourteenth Amendment
rights under the United States Constitution.

The appellas

23

Arnold Heitner is attempting to secure access to a forum so
that tills case may proceed on the merits«

Jurisdiction is

the appellee’s sole concern, and that is all that this cas© is
about.

In this respect, the seizure in the case at bar is

quit© different from the seizures involved in recent attachment cases decided by this Court.

I am, of course, referring

to Sniadach and Fuentes and the cases which have followed those
very important decisions.
In those cases, in personam jurisdiction over the
defendant already existed.

Here the Delaware statute can only

be used if the defendants ar© nonresidents of th® Stats of
Delaware.

In addition, in those attachment cases, th© purpose

of the attachment was to secure or to obtain property as
security for the underlying judgment.

In the case at bar, th®

appellee® has no interest in the property.

As soon as the

appellants appear, the property will b© released.
Now, -throughout the appellants' argument, they have
I

maintained that the procedures used in this cas© are funda­
mentally unfair and that traditional notions of fair play and
substantial justice have been violated,
QUESTION:

May I ask you this before you proceeds

What if, contrary to the facts in this case, what if there
ware a bona fide issue as to whether or not this was property
of th© defendants?
MR. MASCHIO:

I'm not sure I understand your question.

24
Issue as to who owned the stock?
QUESTION:

As to whose property — contrary to the

facts in this case* in Delaware and under Delaware law, if
Idler® is a serious question or if a question is raised: or po­
tentially being raised as to whose property it really is, is
there any provision in Delaware law for the defendant to cane
in and make a special appearance and say, sorry, this is not
my proper* ty?
MR. MASCHIO:

I could answer that question by saying

that there are procedures in Delaware, bills in equity exist in
Delaware.

That could only take place in the hypothetical situ­

ation which is not before this Court where there has been a
•transfer of the stock -QUESTION:.

Well, let's say it is not even stock.

Let's say it is an automobile.
MR. MASCHIO:

I know the answer with respect, to stock.

I'm not sure with respect to an automobile.

As far as stock

is concerned, it seems to me that the Delaware courts have
recognized that a suit in equity is th© appropriate procedure
whereby all of the claimants who claim that they have interest
in th© stock can b© brought before the court in one particular

.F

proceeding so' that th© own@rsh.ip interests of all the parties
can be resolved.
In addition, it should be pointed out that where stock
is involved, the transfer is really transferring stock in

25
violation of a court order and cannot warrant title to that
stock to the transferee.

The federal courts hav© recognized

the bill in interpleader which also serves the function of
bringing all parties before the court.

This is an equitable

proceeding and I think that it gives sufficient safeguards to
the possible danger that may exist if there is dual situs to
the stock certificate, as exists in the case at bar.
QUESTION?

Well what if in this case one of the de­

fendants had in fact validly transferred his shares of stock
to his nephew who is not a defendant —
MR. MASCHIO;
QUESTION;

Right.

— and had validly done so before this

attachment or sequestration or whatever it is called?
MR. MASCHIO;
QUESTION;

Before the attachment?

Yes.

MR. MASCHIO;

Well, at that point there would be no

stock —
QUESTION;

But on the books of the transfer agent it

still showed the defendant as the owner, would he be given any
opportunity under Delaware law to come in and say you can't
bring me into tills lawsuit because this isn't my stock?
MR, MASCHIO;

I think he could.

I think h© could

bring an equitable suit in Delaware.
QUESTION;

As on® reads the statute, there is no op­

portunity for a hearing on that sort of an issue.

26

MR. MASCHIO:

No, there isn't, but I am referring to

case law in the State of Delaware which does provide for
equitable proceedings to basically resolve the question of
ownership -,QUESTION;

He would have to can© to Delaware?

MR. MASCHIO;
QUESTION;

He could have to con© to Delaware.

MR. MASCHIO;
QUESTION:

Pardon?

Yes, h© would.

which is just what you want and is what he

doesn’t want.
MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

Well, it —

Is there any way that he could protect

his interests without coining to Delaware?
MR. MASCHIO:

In this hypothetical situation, I can't

think of any way.
QUESTION:

So he still would have to come to Delaware?

MR. MASCHIO:

Ha would have to come to Delaware.

Now, I -would like to turn back to the fairness argu­
ment because I think that that is very important in this case.
It should be pointed out, and I will point out, that this is a
derivative action and it is brought against officers and
directors of a Delaware corporation.
The number of shares that the plaintiff owns is
meaningless because he is bringing this suit in a representa­
tive capacity.

The appellants in this case have willfully

27
violated an order of the District Court and have been found to
be in contempt of court.

Civil and criminal sanctions have

beer* imposed upon the corporation and the corporation has been
required to pay a fine of $600„000 as the result of the activi­
ties of certain of these appellants.
It is alleged that these appellants have engaged in
a continuous course of legal conduct.

They have bean in

violation of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the
District Court, and have indicated the fines and sanctions that
have been imposed upon them.

Certainly these losses should be

recovered by th® Delaware corporation.

The corporation share­

holders and the public at-larg© have th© right to rely upon
th® performance of fiduciary duties by officers and directors
of a corporation.

In this sense, this is not a private suit.

It is a public suit.

It is a derivativa action.

Thera is a

policing function involved.
QUESTION:

Mr. Maschio, as I understand the facts,

their® are 28 individual defendants who are responsible for all
of ■fills, and this wrongdoing took place, wasn't it in th®
Northern District of Illinois or —
MR. MASCHIO:

No, th© wrongdoing took place probably

— most probably out on th© coast.

It had to do with discrim­

inatory buslines in the area.
QUESTION:

Couldn’t that jurisdiction have been ob­

tained over the entire group of 28 instead of just 21 if the

28

actio» had been brought where the wrongdoing took place?
MR. MASCHIO:
yes.

That could have been the possibility,

It is —
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t that have been a better pro­

cedure?
MR. MASCHIO:

I’m not sure it is a better procedure.

First of all, as you know, a hearing on minimal contacts is a
very difficult situation.

I mean you have to take the ties

and connections with the additional procedures in the courts
and I think for all practical purposes jurisdiction would have
been much, much more difficult to obtain under that type ©f a
situation.
Moreover, there is nothing inherently wrong with the
fact that under our system of federalism that two jurisdictions
could have sufficient contacts with the proceedings so that
the cas© could go forward in both jurisdictions.

W® feel

that -QUESTION:

Delaware cannot go forward as to seven of

the defendants at all?
MR. MASCHIO:

At this point, but I think that w® have

gotten most of the defendants before the court who ware in­
volved in this situation.
QUESTION:

Well not in this case, have you?

MR. MASCHIO:
four —

Yes, we believe that we have.

Th©

29
QUESTION:

Well,, if the statist© is valid, you have,

but if it is not, you haven't.
MR. MASCHIO;

of course.

I understand.

That is why

we are her®.
QUESTION:
this case.

You have been addressing the merits of

How many shares of stock does your client own?
MR. MASCHIO:

Again, my client owned one share of

stock, but I did point out the fact that this is a derivative
action and is brought on behalf of not only himself but all
other shareholders similarly situated.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. MASCHIO:

So it may well be that there are share­

holders
QUESTION:

Hoi/ long has your client owned that on©

share of stock?
MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

For several years, Your Honor.

How many other stockholders of this cor­

poration have asserted the same claims that you assert in your
complaint?
MR. MASCHIO:

I think this is the only suit of this

nature.
QUESTION:

How many stockholders does the Greyhound

Corporation have?
MR. MASCHIO:
know

They have many shareholders.

I don't

30
QUESTION:

How many?

MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

Hundreds of thousands?

MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

Thousands of shareholders.

Hundreds of thousands.

The merits are really totally irrelevant

to what you are arguing though, aren’t they?
MR. MASCHIO:

I don't think so.

I think the merits

are very important —
QUESTION:

I thought you had a constitutional issue

here?
MR. MASCHIO:

Well, I am arguing -the merits to demon­

strate to the Court that this is a public lawsuit, it is not a
private lawsuit.

You can talk about the fact that Mr.

Heitner has one share of stock until now until doomsday, it is
not going to change the fact that it is a derivativa action
and it is brought on behalf of all shareholders similarly
situated.
Now, either the Court believes in the theory of a
public suit of this nature or it doesn't.

But the point is

that this is a derivative action and that there is a public
function involved her®, and there is a policing function in­
volved hare, and I think that that is an important distinction.
QUESTION: Does the record shed any light on whether
this on® share of stock was acquired as a prelude to this
litigation?

31
MR. MASCHIO:

It. wasn't, Your Honor, that I know.

But the record doesn't shed any light on it.
I would like to continue on fch© fairness argument
and I would like to point out that the appellants' authorities
in this case are regulated, of course, by Delaware law.

It is

certainly appropriate for Delaware to construe its own corpor­
ate laws.

I feel that this is an important public function

which w© must concern ourselves with.
In addition, several states, in particular the States
of South Carolina and Connecticut, have enacted special statutes
subjecting nonresident directors to suit within the state of
incorporation as a result of activities which they have engaged
in in the course of their performance of their duties as direc­
tors of the corporation.

Could you repeat

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Suppose in the State of Delaware there is

an action on a contract and the plaintiff attaches property

the procedures involved in connection with the seizure of the
property.

They can say that too much property was seized and

therefor® a review would have to ba mad-a of the allega-felons
of a complaint to sea whether, based on the merits of the com­
plaint , sufficient property has been seized in order for th©
sequestration statute to be validly used.

QUESTION:

Mr. Maschio, what interest does the state

of Delaware have in this statute?
MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

Well, Delaware has a —

I think I should preface it.

Do you from

New York, and the other side from San Francisco, and nobody is
her® from Delaware

now, how do we know what interests the

State of Delaware have in this statute?
MR. MASCHIO:

Well, we know what interests the State

of Delaware have because the Delaware Supreme Court has felt
that it did have an interest in this proceeding and so stated
in its opinion.
QUESTION:

There is no brief from the State of

Delaware, is there?
MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

No, there isn't.

There is not.

So what is Delaware —• you tell me what

Delaware’s interest is, sine© Delaware is not interested?
MR. MASCHIO:

Well, one of the interests of Delaware

is -that it is in -a unique position to decide issues concerning
its own corporate law.

I feel that it is perfectly appropriate

for Delaware to construe, its own corporata law, particularly
where allegations of wrongdoings of officers and directors of a
corporation incorporated within Delaware are being called to
task for their activities.

That is on© interest which Delaware

has in this proceeding.
In addition, I think that —

MR. MASCH10 t
QUESTION:

But this doesn't.

36
MR. MASCHIO;

Well, this goes back quite a ways.

I

mean —
QUESTION;

But not that far.

MR. MASCHIOs

Not that far, no.

I think it is important to point out that under our
system of federalism the State of Delaware has enacted corpor­
ate laws which contain numerous advantages for incorporating
within that jurisdiction.

These advantages include generous

indemnification and insurance provisions which hav© been en­
acted by the State of Delaware to indue® capable and respon­
sible businessmen to assume the duties and hardships of cor­
porate directorship of a Delaware corporation.
Also consistent with our system of federalism,
Delaware has sought to counterbalance these liberal corporate
provisions in its corporate law by enacting a sequestration
statute which serves the function of in many cases calling
9

corporate officers to account for their activities in connec­
tion with -the operation of and the performance of their duties
in a Delaware corporation.
These defendants, keenly as they are aware of the
benefits of incorporating in Delaware, must b© deemed to hav®
knowledge of the existence of the sequestration statute and in
effect l am suggesting that they have impliedly waived any
objection to the- operation of the statute in the case at bar.
I think that the Court must concern itself with the

37
facts which are before this Court.

The appellants have con­

stantly made reference fco where in other situations the oper­
ation of the statute may possibly have proved a hardship.
Those facts and those circumstances are not before the Court.
Here we review the question of fairness and the con­
tacts which these appellants have with the State of Delaware.
I do not feel that the traditional notions of fair play and
substantial justice have bean violated.

There may bs other

situations where the application ©f the statute is more
onerous, but these appellants lack standing to raise issues
and constitutionality of the statuta based upon facts which are
not before this Court.
I would like to turn to —
QUESTION;
subject:;

Mr. Maschio, before you get on another

Do you have any precedents other than from the

Delaware State courts for quasi in rera jurisdiction where th©
defendant must subject himself to liability above the value of
the property which has be©», attached in any other state?
MR. MASCHIOs

I do not have that in my brief.

I

would like to point out, in response to that, that it is my
understanding — and I may be mistaken here — that only the
State of New York has a provision and in certain federal court
visions where the special appearance is permitted.

I know

for a fact that the State, of New York has a provision for
special appearance.

I have not made a survey of th© laws of

38
all the jurisdictions.
QUESTION;

Wall, I am not so much interested in

statutory provisions.

Has there been any decision by this

Court or any other court that you are aware of that has sus­
tained quasi in rem jurisdiction for an amount in excess of the
value of the property?
MR. MASCHIO:

Not that I know of, but that doesn't

mean that it doesn't exist.
I would like to —■
QUESTION ;

The defendant can limit their liability to

tii© value of the property simply by not appearing, isn't that
right?
MR. MASCHIO;
QUESTION;

Yes, that's right.

They can't both do that and defend the

action on the merits?
MR. MASCHIO:

That is a standard procedure.

It is a

quasi in rem proceeding.
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. MASCHIO;

It doesn't change the character of the

proceeding.
QUESTION;

All the way back to —

MR. MASCHIO;
QUESTION;

That's right.

But in any of those cases, by defending

the action, has he been required to take the risk of the
judgment in excess of the value of the property might be

39
entered against him?
MR. MASCHIO:
have those authorities.
QUESTION

I believe there are cases, but I do not
I'm sorry, I apologize.

You have a special appearance to contest

the procedures under which the quasi in ran attachment: had
taken place or to contest his ownership of the property, and
so on, and if he were ruled against in that, than his option
was to go back to his home state and forfait the property or
to remain there and enter a general appearance and defend the
lawsuit?
MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

And that is the procedure in Delaware.

That was standard operating procedure

back, as I said, in the old days.
MR. MASCHIO:

Right, and that is th© procedure in

Delaware.
QUESTION:

Can you cite any case sustaining that

procedure?
MR, MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

I have good counsel.

You need good counsel.

MR. MASCHIO';'

With respect to the issue of special

appearnce, I would just like to point one thing out.

There are

some benefits in th© procedure which has been enacted by
Delaware.

By requiring a general appearance in order to de­

fend, you do eliminate the possibility of multiple lawsuits,
and I think that that is something to be considered.

Also,

40

Delaware has enacted in its statuta in its case law safeguards
in the sense that if there is a general appearance, the claims
which can be asserted against the appellant cannot go beyond
the four corners of the complaint.

In other words, no new

causes of action can be interjected into the action by virtue
of the fact of the general appearance.

So these are two fac­

tors which I think the Court should b© aware of with respect to
this particular type of procedure.
I would like to 'turn briefly to the recent Supreme
Court cases dealing with requirements of a hearing.
touched upon sane of this in earlier discussions.

I think we
W© maintain

in this case that the procedures involved are consistent with
the Puentes criteria, and that postponing notice in a hearing
is justified.

We base that position basically on the case of

Ownbay v. Morgan and the citation of those cases, Fuentes,
Sniadach and the Calero-Toledo cases before this Court, in
which was —■ those cases wore cited for the proposition that
attachment for the purposes of attaining jurisdiction in state
court has always been a basic and importent public interest
justifying seizure without prior notice in a hearing.

That is

also another interest which the State of Delaware has in this
proceeding.
We feel that the Delaware statute serves this vary
important function.

Public interest is also served because of

QUESTION?

Mr, Maschioe what do you understand th©

holding of the Ownbey cas© to be?
MR. MASCHIO;

I understand that the basic thrust of

the Ownbey case is as I have just quoted it, the attachment for
the purposes of attaining jurisdiction in a state court has
always been a basic and important public interest justifying
seizure without the benefit of prior notice in a hearing.
That is all that I limit the holding in the Ownbey casa.

I do

not condone the requirements of special bond before
QUESTION;

The Ownbey case was whether the defendant

had to post a special bond in order to enter a general appear­
ance in ORDER to release a security.
MR. MASCHIO;

That was the issue in the Ownbey case,

and I don’t, think that that issue would be decided th© same way
today.

However, the Ownbey cas© has been cited by this Court.

How, I don’t know what the Court had in mind when it was
citing the Ownbey casa in Puentes, Sniadach and CalerbToledo.
QUESTION;

Did I understand you — did I hear you cor­

rectly to say you don't think we would decide th© Ownbey case
tha same way today?
MR. MASCHIO;

justifying seizure without prior notice and hearing.
am not really relying on Ownbey.

Now, I

I am really relying upon the

reaffirmation of that principle in Fuentes, in the Sniadach
case, in the Calero-Toledo case.
QUESTION?

They are all different.

MR. MASCHIOs

Your Honor, I think we all need guidance

on this point.
QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. MASCHIOs
on this point.

I really think that we all need guidance

And I can’t tell this Court what it meant when

it cited those cases in its decision, but it has been inter­
preted as being a reaffirmation of the Ownbey case.
QUESTION:

Non© of those deal with a judgment in ex­

cess of the value of the property seized either?
MR, MASCHIOs
QUESTION:

No, I don’t believ© so.

In this case, you are not interested in

property at all, you ar© interested in getting them into- court.
MR. MASCHIOs

That is all we ar© interested in, Your

43

Honori and that is the reason why ~
QUESTION?

Well, doesn’t that differentiate your case

from any other case?
MR. MASCHIO:

Yes, it does.

It is a completely dif­

ferent situation.

I think it is good.

I think it is

good because it goes to the issue of — it goes to many of the

QUESTION?

You mean that a man can be brought in and

get a judgment against him of $100,000 is better than if it is
limited to $1,000?
MR. MASCHIOs
QUESTION?

W© can’t —

It is better for the plaintiff.

MR. MASCHIO:

The plaintiff can get a judgment in

this case only on two methods:

One, if it prevails on the

merits of the case, and that would imply a general appearance?
two, there is a default.

There the judgment would be limited

to the amount of the property sequestered, but it is not an
absolute default judgment.
of an inquest.

We have to go through the procedures

We have to prove that our case has prima facie

merit and we have to show that there have been damages, which
is not unusual in our system of jurisprudence.
QUESTION:
settlement?

And settlement, too, the possibility of

44
MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

Possibility of settlement.

I think you have said two or three times

that once a general appearance is made, the stock that has
been sequestered is released?
MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Does that follow automatically without re­

gard to the circumstances?
MR. MASCHIO:

Well, it follows automatically unless

the party who has seised the stock can show a special need for
the withholding of the stock until the judgment has been
rendered.

Automatically the stock would be released unless a

special application is brought by the party who has sequestered
the stock asking for it to ba withheld during the continuation
of the lawsuit.
QUESTION:

Would that inquire into whether or not
!

the party who has made a general appearance may be judgmentproof if the stock is released?
MR. MASCHIO:

I would rather suspect that that would

ba one of the considerations that the court would have —
QUESTION:
really.

So that there is no automatic release,

It turns on whether or not you can satisfy the —
MR. MASCHIO:

No, it is an automatic release unless a

special application is brought.

A new proceeding has fee b®

brought by the party who has sequestered the stock.

Now, a

sufficient showing has to be mad© that there is reason for

45
withholding the stock further.

But the basic thrust of the

statute is for jurisdictional purposes.
that way.

Xt has been construed

It has been utilised that way in the state of

Delaware*, and X really think that is the basic thrust of the
statute.
Now, we talked briefly about the question of a hear­
ing.

I think, that again it is important to distinguish this

case from ids© recent attachment cases.

Of course, again, Mr.

Heitner, the appellee, has no claim to the squestered property.
There is no danger that this property will be depreciated or
wasted.

There is no wages or consumer goods at issue.

Thar®

are no vendor's liens on the property, all of which were in­
volved in the attachment cases.
I think that this goes to the question of what type
of & hearing is required and what is tha purpose of an immedi­
ate post-.seiaure hearing or a hearing.
at that hearing?

What will be determined

The only point that has to be established

under the terras of tha Delaware statute is the fact that the
appellants are nonresidents of the State of Delaware and that
they have property within the State of Delaware.
Now, the hearing on the merits is not eliminated.
The hearing on the merits, I have touched upon that, how the
merits can be discussed by the court in the event that the
Delaware sequestration procedure itself was contested on the
grounds that too much property had been withheld, and also

there is the trial of the action, which is a hearing.
I think that under the circumstances you have to
look at, what the property interest is and what th© function cf
a hearing would be, and under these circumstances I think that
th© sufficient safeguards exist within the Delaware statuis
to cover this point.
QUESTIONs

Well, going over to th© personal jurisdic­

tion side of the case, suppose there was no property in
Delaware but nevertheless th® suit was brought there and
suppose that Delaware could not get personal jurisdiction over
these nonresident defendants under International Shoe or oases
following International Shoe, they just weren't minimum con­
tacts that Delaware would just exceed its authority to att empt
to serve these people and get personal jurisdiction out of
them.

Suppose that were the case, then your position is, I

take it, that if you had on® single fact in. addition, namely
that one ©£ those defendants does have property in th© state,
you may get personal jurisdiction over them?
MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION3

You ar© asking me to —

Well, the argument in th© case that «except

for this property Delaware could not get jurisdiction.
MR. MASCHIO;

I don't believe that that is — yes,

that's true, but that is th© long-arm statute.
QUESTION:

But th© argument is that without the

property Delaware could not exercise jurisdiction over these

47
defendants.
MR. MASCHIOs
QUESTIONS

That is the —

But with the property,, your position is

you may not only exercise jurisdiction over the property but
personal jurisdiction over them?
MR. MASCHIOs

We are arguing — our argument is that

■filer® is property within the jurisdiction ~
QUESTIONS

Yes.

MR. MASCHIOs

— and that is a valid basis for the

caieraise of quasi in ram jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. MASCHIOs

Our further argument is that if the

doctrine of International Shoe and Hanson v. Denckla is said to
apply in this case, we meat those qualifications.
QUESTION:

Just by the fact of owning property?

MR. MASCHIOs

Oh, no, not just by the fact of owning

property, by the fact of owning property and by the fact that
Delaware has a substantial interest in this controversy, by
the fact that this is a derivative action, by the fact, that
the appellants have ties with this jurisdiction, and that is
why I structured my presentation that way.
QUESTION:

Yes, but only ties with the jurisdiction

as through the corporation,

QUESTION;

That's all.

MR, MASCHIQ:

Yes, that and the property.

Well, that is the property.

No.

I know, but the defendants just own s;fcock,

Directors and officers and employees.

MR. MASCHIO:

Yes, all of those things we are trying

to marshall to show that the exercise of jurisdiction, whether
or not you say the International Shoe doctrine applies or not,
or whether or not you say that this is strictly a quasi in ran
proceeding, we meet the qualifications.

This is not the case

QUESTION;

Counsel, if that is a valid argument, you

have jurisdiction ever the seven non-stockholder defendants as
well and Delaware doesn't sustain that jurisdiction.

That

argument applies equally to the non-stockholder defendants un­
less you rely on the stockholder, stock ownership.

QUESTION;

So you don’t; have a statutory basis for

this other kind of jurisdiction?
MR. MASCHIO;

That is correct.

We do not have a

statutory basis for the interest on the jurisdiction argument
based upon a minimum contact..
QUESTION:

But if your argument, your submission to

my Brother Whit© '.fas that if Delaware® did have a long-arm
statute, its application to all the defendants in this case
would be constitutionally permissible because of their rela­
tionship with the Delaware corporation, quite apart from their
stock ownership, is that right?
MR. MASCHIO:

Yes, probably, if the breadth of the

statute was as broad as the ~

QUESTION:

Well, you just don't need your attachment

statute than to extend the jurisdiction?
MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION;

Are you saying that or not?

MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

I am not sure —

No, I am not saying that.

So you really do need the attachment

statute?
MR. MASCHIO:
QUESTION:

Wall, I don’t know —

statute?
MR. MASCHIO:

Delaware does not have a long-arm

statute, and I think that this statute is more conducive to

securing access to a form»

AM as long as that provision

situation is not unfair, then I think that no du© process
violation has occurred.
Now, it may well b© that the imposing of the minimum
contact theory in a quasi in roan proceeding will be more re­
strictive than that which exists at the present time,, and I
don't know if the Court wants to go that far.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. REESE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL
MR. REESE:
QUESTION:

May it pleas© the Court -How about this finality business, Mr.

Reas©, before you —
MR, REESE:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, we know that

an order has been entered by the highest court in the state of

52
Delaware.
QUESTION;

Interlocutory order?

I mean, this is an

on-going lawsuit, particularly because of the way it decided
the case on the merits.

If nothing had happened, this case

would go back for trial in the state court, wouldn't it, and
idle plaintiff might lose and that would be the end of it and
might that not indicate that this is not a final judgment?
MR. REESE;

Presumably defaults would be taken and

the property of th^ defendants sold, at which point we could
start back up.
QUESTION:

Well, that is one presumption.

The other

presumption is that you would go in and defend the lawsuit
unless you thought that you were — that the plaintiff had a
great deal of fore®, in his claim.

And under that presumption,

if you defended the lawsuit and did so successfully, this case
would be over, wouldn't it, and decided in your favor on the
merits?
MR. REESE:

If we successfully defended on the merits,

the lawsuit would be over.
QUESTION;

And therefore why is this a final order?

And. if it isn't, as you know, we don't have any jurisdiction
ever it.
MR. REESE:

It is a question that I haven't considered

previously, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

It just occurred to me also.

QUESTION;
MR. REESE;

Do you need counsel?
Pardon?
Do you need counsel?
I will take it if I can get it.

[Laughter]
I wanted to correct one —
QUESTION:

Is it your position that you are entitled

to have this issue resolved at th© outset, that you have n
right to due process to have this- issue resolved?
MR. REESE;

Mr. Chief Justice, the property of these

defendants has been tied up for two and a half years.

No

responsible official of the State of Delaware has aver during
that period considered whether there is a baseless or a sound
or any other kind of claim against them to justify that
deprivation of their property.

We think that that is more than

long enough for that condition to ba allowed to continue and
that it is time for it to foe ended.
QUESTION:

tod do you suggest there is no mandamus

remedy available to you to bring that to a head?
MR. REESE;

We have pursued the matter through the

state court system to the end point.

Th® Delaware Supreme

Court has rendered its final judgment on the matter.
QUESTION;

Well, on this basically interlocutory

matter.
MR. REESE:

To the extent that a two and a half year

54
deprivation is interlocutory.
QUESTION:

Under the Delaware judgment, all that it

has decided is that you are properly in the lawsuit, and th©
.lav/suit now can go on on the merits.

That is all the Delaware

judgment holds,
QUESTION:

Doesn’t the judgment hold that your

property has foaen seised and if you don’t submit to their
jurisdiction your property is gone?
MR. REESE:

Certainly, Mr. Justice Marshall, that is

what that judgment holds.
QUESTION:
MR. REESE:

Well, is that interlocutory?
I'm sorry, I missed your question, Mr.

Justice ”~
QUESTION:
tory.

I just wonder how that can be interlocu­

If you don't submit to their jurisdiction, which you

say they don’t have, then, you lose your property.

That has

been decided.
MR. REESE:
QUESTION:
MR. REESE:

That is clear.
That’s clear.
The only step remaining is to conduct th©

final hearing and the. sal© of the property.
QUESTION:

That is if you are going to default in the

lawsuit?
MR. REESE:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Now, let's say this were a case in Delaware!

55

in which there was personal service upon a resident defendant
of Delaware, and his claim was there was something defective
about that service, that as a constitutional matter there was
something defective about the personal service of him in
Delaware.

You brought that up all the way to the Delaware

Supreme Court and the Delaware Supreme Court said no, as a
constitutional matter this — as wall as statutory, this is a
perfectly valid service.

Then this Court wouldn't have juris­

diction in that, would it?

That, would be interlocutory,

wouldn't it?
MR. REESE2
QUESTION:

My understanding *—
All that would have decided was that you,

Mr. Defendant, have to go in and defend the lawsuit.
MR, REESE:

In this ease, the Delaware Supreme Court

has issued a final judgment as to -’die validity of the taking
of th© defendants' property.

The defendants now have only one

choice, which you pointed out, to forfeit ~™

QUESTION:

Defaulting on tha lawsuit or defending it?

MR. REESE:

— or to enter a general appearance and

giving up at that point their rights tinder the Fourteenth
Amendment to having a trial in a proper forum.
QUESTION:

No, because you might win on the merits,
*

and if you lose on the merits you would not have given up your
Fourteenth Amendment claim because there would then be a final
judgment that you could bring to this Court,

56
QUESTION:

I understood your position to be that you

would lose your constitutional right to have the case tried in
a proper forum, and that Delaware is not the proper forum.

Is

that your position?
MR. REESE:
QUESTION:

It is our position, Mr. Chief Justice.
And you are saying that this Hobson's

choice is one that the provisions of due process should
guarantee that you should not have to make?
MR. REESE:

Yes, the defendants stand to los© a lot

by just being forced to the trial on the merits at this point.
That is part of the point of it.
QUESTION:

And that is one of the prices of not

allowing interlocutory appeals, too.
