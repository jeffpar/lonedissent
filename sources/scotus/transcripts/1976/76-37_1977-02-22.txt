MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

against School District of

Philadelphia.
Counsel, you may proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OP SHARON K, WALLIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. WALLIS:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The question presented by this case is whether one
particular public school, the Central High School of
Philadelphia, may exclude academically qualified female
students solely on the basis of their gender.
District Court below applied this Court's analysis
in Reed and examined all the proper justifications for this
policy, and after identifying the school district's goals and
examining its justifications in terms of the particular facts
of this case, determined that the policy had not been shown
to be; fairly and substantially related to any of the
Respondents1 legitimate objectives.
This case presents the clearest and most compelling
case in which sex segregation in public education violates the
Equal Protection clause.
Central High School in a unique Institution for
many reasons.

It was the first high school in Philadelphia.

4
It happens also to be the second in the nation.

Excuse me,

that’s public high school.
It is one of two schools, both of them being single­
sex schools, which are characterized as academic high schools,
in the public school system.
Academic high schools are defined in terms of their
exclusively academic curriculum and also their high admission
standards, which are only met by 7% of the students in the
Philadelphia school system.
Because of these unique characteristics of Central
High*it is particularly difficult to justify the exclusion
of female students from that institution.

It is an exclusion

that dates back, originally, to a time when Central was the
only school — public school in Philadelphia.

Public

high school education was only offered to exceptionally
gifted students and it was not offered to female students
because it was not regarded as appropriate to their abilities
and their needs.
That fs what this Court has referred to as "old
notions" about the role of women and men in society.
Subsequently, Philadelphia High School for Girls
was developed as an a'll-female school which has the same
admission standards, but it does not have the history or
the character of Central High School.
QUESTION:

It obviously hasn’t been in existence as

5
long* but what do you mean by the history and the character?
iMS. WALLIS:

Central has a very unique history, not

only because it was the first high school, but because it
always held a certain position In the school system as the
training ground for leaders .
If you are interested, you might want to look at
Cornog‘s,

School of the Republic,

which goes in some great

detail into the history of Central High School.
QUESTION:

By history and all, are you referring to

its reputation and standing?
MS. WALLIS:

Its reputation, its standing in the

community, and I think, above all, its mission, that is, that
it was always held to be, and was created to be, a special
school for training leaders within the public school system.
QUESTION:

For training leaders or for training

exceptional boys, young men?
MS. WALLIS:

Well, the stated objective, which is

repeated again and again as you. will see in the Cornog book
and some excerpts from that are quoted not only in our
brief but also in the brief of the United States as amicus
curiae.
The goal of the school, the concept of the school
was to train leaders In industry and life.

That's a quote.

To train leaders in all fields of endeavor.
That was an education that was only open to male

6
students,
The definition of the school was one of preparing
people for leadership.
We are relying, obviously, on .Sweat v, Painter,
I am taking that a step further, in a sense.

What I am saying

is the school not only has all the characteristics that make
for greatness in an educational institution, that is, out­
standing alumnae, a great tradition of accomplishment, as
well as particular, you know, high reputation, national
reputation, but in addition to that this is the result of a
conscious effort to maintain such an institution within the
Philadelphia school system.

And that institution has

traditionally been exclusively open to male students.
The Trial Court here did find that the education
available at Philadelphia High School for Girls was equivalent
to that — substantially equivalent to that available at
Central, But if you look at that Finding 3Ckand the surrounding
findings, it becomes very clear that the Trial Court defined
education as level of classroom instruction.
And the Trial Court mentions, for example, Central
is the only high school in Philadelphia with a substantial
private endowment.

That's the Barnwell Foundation,

The

Barnwell Foundation was responsible for bringing to the
school such distinguished speakers -- and this Is just
recently -- as Robert Kennedy when he was Attorney General,

7
Hubert Humphrey when he was Vice President.
More recently — it doesn't happen to be mentioned
in the Court's opinion — Elliot Richardson.
This is not something in the very distant past.
QUESTION:
training at Girls

If the training at Central High and the
High was identical, would you still be

here?
MS. WALLIS:

I think that we have to define our

terms,
I understand the Trial —
QUESTION:
MS. WALLIS:
about.

I said "identical."
That's not the term I am concerned

It's training.
QUESTION:
MS. WALLIS:

Well, that's my question.
Yes.

The question is:

What do you mean by training or

what do you mean by education?
What I mean by education and what I believe this
Court -QUESTION:

Are you arguing that It Is unequal?

That's what I want to know.
MS. WALLIS:

Are you arguing unequal or not?

Well, what I am arguing is that there

Is an important opportunity that is lost by being deprived of
access to Central High School.
That opportunity is the opportunity for a unique

8
preparation for a leadership role in society.
It is not a difference in classroom instruction,
particularly, although there are some differences in the
schools.
QUESTION:

Let me extend Mr, Justice Marshall's

hypothetical a little.
Suppose, as with some of the schools, they decided
that four hours a day was enough class time for the students,
and in the same building, under the same name, with the same
faculty, you had the boys go to school from 8 until 12 and the
girls go to school from 1 until 5*

That would then

I

would think you would agree, or perhaps you wouldn't, that
this is identical.

Would you say -- .What would be the

problem then, in your view?
MS. WALLIS:

Then I think you would have a fairly

clear statutory problem,
QUESTION:
MS, WALLIS:

A what?
Well, there would be a stronger

statutory argument, under Tit1e 20, if you were talking about
the same school with segregated classes.
l*d put that aside for the moment.

That's not what

you are asking me about, obviously.
QUESTION:
MS, WALLIS:
QUESTION:

Well, I thought I was.
Well, let me put it this way -Same building, same curriculum, curricula,

9
all the way through, same teachers, everything identical
except boys in the morning, girls in the afternoon»
MSo VJALLIS:

I think that that would be certainly

a different case than this one.

There are many qualities,

many aspects of Central High School that we are concerned
about here.
If the diploma were the same, then that would make
it — that would be one opportunity the girls were not
denied.

If, by graduating from this institution in a separate

program,they were entitled to be full-fledged manbers of the
Central High School Alumnae Society which the District Court
recognized was an extremely influential and important
organization within Philadelphia, that would be another
opportunity that would not be denied to female students
under your hypothesis which is now —
There is another aspect of this case, and that is
the opportunity for young men and young women to enjoy a free
exchange of ideas which the Court talks about in Sweat v.
Painter and also in its companion case, MeLaurIn —
QUESTION;

Is that what your case is all about?

Areyou arguing for a coeducational education?
MS, WALLIS;

The case is all about all of those

things.
QUESTION:

I think it is of some importance to

identify what this case is about.

10

The Chief Justice’s question was directed to
determining whether this is a separate but equal case and
whether separate but equal violates the Constitution, or
whether, on the other hand, it is a somewhat simpler case,
and that is that the best high school in Philadelphia excludes
girls because they are girls»
MS o W ALLXS :
QUESTION:

This is quite a different case»

Yes, it is the easier case*
Which one?

MS * WALLIS:

What I am saying is that this is the

easiest possible case*
QUESTION:

Why?

MS * WALLIS:

The reason it is the easiest possible

case is because Central does have all of these unique

/
f

features and also because when you are talking about young
women who are academically gifted you are talking about the
young Xtfomen who are most qualified for leadership positions,
both young women and young men ~~
QUESTION:

That isn’t the approach the District

Court took, and it certainly isn’t the approach that the
Court of Appeals took,
MS. WALLIS:
‘ QUESTION:

You are right.

The District Court —

The District Court said separate but

equal isn’t bad and the Court of Appeals said it is okay.
Neither court -aid there was inequality.
MS . Wallis :

No, the District Court —

11
QUESTION:
MS, WALLIS:

And so you want us to find it.
Oh, no.

The District Court — There is a confusion in the
District Court.

In Footnote 1, you will see.

The District

Court, unfortunately, didn't quite understand Sweat y. Painter.
But the District Court made all of the necessary findings.
So I am not asking you —•
QUESTION:

So it would be proper for us to make

the legal conclusion to the effect that you want?
MS o WALLIS:

Yes.

The District Court found that

the level of classroom education was significantly similar,
which this Court assumed in Sweat v. Painter.
The District Court went on to find very significant
differences between the two schools.
QUESTION:

Why should we, contrary to a District

Court that knoxus more about the locality than we do, make a
conclusion different from the District Court as to whether
these were substantially equal, in its words?
MS. WALLDp:

It Is not a question of whether they

are equal or not.
.•

"

, t.

We will — I mean fdr purposes' of ,this record we
have to go on the hypothesis that the level of classroom
instruction is the same, but that —
QUESTION:

In Finding 26, x-jhich says very-specifically

that the scientific facilities at Central are superior.'

12
MS, WALLIS:

I think the Court also found that the

level was generally the same, is what I am saying.
There are differences.
QUESTION:

I thought that your argument pareed down

to the claim that in this public school system Central High
School is the best, and it excludes girls because they are
girls *
MS, WALLIS:

That Is my argument.

Now I am trying

to tell Justice White why you can accept my argument and you
don't have to overrule the District Court, and the reason is
that the District Court found that there were very significant
differences between the schools.

Central was, in fact,

superior in terns of the accomplishments of Its alumnae.
QUESTION:
MS. WALLIS:
findings.

What about the Court of Appeals?
They didn't overturn any of those

The Court of Appeals merely —
QUESTION:

They went on the basis that there was

substantial equality.
MS, WALLIS:

I don't know where they got that.

I mean, seriously, —
QUESTION:

You are asking us to differ with the

Court of Appeals and then on that point —
MS, WALLIS:

No, because they didn’t change

didn’t overrule any of the facts in the record.
in a conelusory sentence that

they

They just say

13
QUESTION:

Nell, you wouldn’t suggest that the

Court of Appeals would have ruled against you if they had
thought the training at these two schools was substantially
unequal, would you?
MS, WALLIS:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, this is -Would you, or not?

MS, WALLIS:

Yes, I think they would have, because

I think the question here is not the facto
is the law.

The question here

The problem in the District — We won in the

District Court,

Let’s get that straight first.

The

District Court’s analysis which I think is-a very good one
was this is obviously a classification based on sex, gender.
QUESTION:

You are coming around to my hypothetical.

You are really answering by inference the question which you
said you didn’t want to answer in my hypothetical, that if
it was the same building, the same books, the same teachers,
everything the same, morning and afternoon, you would still
be here.
MS, WALLIS:

I didn't mean to say that I didn’t

want to answer.
What I was ““
QUESTION:
MS .WALLIS:
is the easiest case.

Well, do you want to answer?
What I am trying to say is that this
All of those factors that you have

excluded in your hypothesis makes this an easier case then

14

your hypothesis, but, even under -QUESTION:

On which hypothesis does the educational

opportunity in the school

not afterwards — in the school

-- was substantially the same?

Is that the hypothesis you

accept?
MS , WALLIS:

The hypothesis that I would — What

I take from the record, is that the District Court found that
the education offered, the classes were not signifleantly
different, but that —
QUESTION:

We are reviewing the Court of Appeals,

now remember»
MS o WALLIS:

Yes, but you are still reviewing it

from the factual record which the Court of Appeals did not
disturb»

They did not find that any of the facts or

findings went against the weight of the evidence.

These are

still the facts and —
QUESTION:

Could we try once again? And I promise

I won’t ask you another question if you answer this one.
Are you standing on separate but equal or not?
MS« WALLIS:
equal.

In addition to that —
QUESTION:

equal?

We are saying the schools are not

Are you standing on separate but

Is that your point, that the schools ere unequal?
MS, WALLIS:

Well, I don’t think that I have to

argue that separate but equal is the law in order to argue the

15
schools are not equal,

I am saying the schools are not

equa 1.
QUESTION:

I respectfully say you have to take one

position or the other,
QUESTION:

Or at least alternatively.

MSo WALLIS:

I think alternatively that the

schools, number one, are not equal, and number two —
QUESTION:

Even If they are, it is unconstitutional

to segregate on the basis of sex.
MS. WALLIS:

No.
0

(laughter)
MS. WALLIS:

Even If they were equal, which I think,

for purposes of legal analysis, was the District Court®s
position, that the school district failed to demonstrate why
females should be excluded from Central High.

That's not to

say that sex. segregation is inherently unequal and, therefore,
unconstitutional.

All I am saying is that this Court decided

Reed, this Court decided Craig, you decided the intervening
cases.
You decided in those cases that classification based
on gender must be justified, and you indicated what type of
just5.flcat.ion must be met.

Most .recently, In Craig, you said

it has to be substantially related,, to an important governmental purpose.
had said in Reed»

You also said there that that was what you
The Trial Court here happened to apply the

16

language in Reed because he didn't have the benefit of Craig,
but I don't think there is any substantial difference there*
The Trial Court said this is a sex classification
case.

School District justify.

certain proffered justification*

School District presented
The Trial Court examined

those and said that they failed to meet the standard the
Supreme Court of the United States has told me in Reed I
must apply, and therefore I find that the exclusion of female
students from Central High School is unconstitutional,
Nov/, that is not nearly as broad as saying that
the exclusion of female students from any school in the entire
country
QUESTION:

I take it It is not your threshold

argument, either.
MS. WALLIS:
QUESTION:

I believe —
You are saying that they are substantially

unequal and only if it were found that they were substantially
equal would you purport to defend the District Court*s position,
Is that it?
MS. WALLIS:

Well, I think the Respondents have to

meest both of those in order to prevail.

They must convince

you that the schools are equal under the standard set forth
in Sweat v. Painter which applies —
QUESTION:

Well, you are the Appellant.

You are

the one who has to convince us that the both courts below were

17

wrong on equality.
MS o VJALLIS;

You are right.

You have to be convinced.—•
QUESTION:
MS .WALLIS :

By somebody —
By somebody that .the schools are* in
f

fact* equal —
QUESTION;

•

,

Contrary to the views of the District

Court „
MS, WALLIS;
QUESTION:

No,
I mean consistent with the views of the

District
MS, WALLIS;

The District Court found that the

schools were equal only in one respect.
In Sweat v, Painter, the Court hypothesized that
the Jim Croitf Law School and the University of Texas would be
equal in that particular way and found that all these other
characteristics, these what they called Intangibles, were
terribly important in determining whether the Equal Protection
standard was met.
We have all those findings.

So I am not asking you

to overrule the findings of the District Court.

I am just

asking you to apply .Sweat to this case.
If you look at Footnote 1, the District Court
confused Brown and Sweat and said in order to apply
you had to show a feeling of inferiority.

Sweat

18
That's just wrong* under the law,

That's why the

District Court didn't make use of the findings.

But the

findings are there,
We are not asking you to make any new findings
that aren’t in the record.
Now* in addition to that* the Court in both Sureat
and Me La ur in was concerned* I believe* with individuals who
were destined for leadership positions in the community,
'.And the Court in both of those cases said that the free
exchange of ideas with members of the dominant society is
a very important interest* in addition to the intangibles
like prestige of the faculty and prestige of graduates*
etcetera* etcetera* that just the opportunity for the free
exchange of ideas is essentially important to those
individuals who are going to take on leadership positions in
the community.
And* to that extent, I am arguing that sexsegregated education is hardest to sustain when you are
talking about the most talented young women in the public
school community* because in' that context you are talking
about girls who are going to be lawyers and doctors and
judges and all of those things.

And it is most important

for them — just as important for them to graduate from a
school where they will have an entre to alumnae who are in
leadership positions in those fields of endeavor.

19

It is also important for them to go to school with
the boys who are likewise going to be the leaders in all of
those fields of endeavor.., perhaps in greater numbers for
some- time to come, that cutting off those contacts does a
great disservice to these particular women*
Now, with the Court's permission, I would like to
reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal*
MR* CHIEF JUSTICE. BURGER:

Very well, Ms* Wallis*

Mr* Gilbert»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN H» GILBERT, ESQ»,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR* GILBERT:

Mr» Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is not a case of an invidious 3ex-based
disc rimination,
1 would point out to the Court the finding which
was made by the District Court, Finding Number 18, on page
43A of the petition, that Girls

High School, the school

which Is available to the Petitioners, quote, ''has fulfilled
the vision of many Nineteenth Century educators, both men and
women, by becoming the equal of Central in preparing its
students for college»"
We are talking about a high school here, Your,Honors,
especially an all-academic senior high school, the function
of which is to prepare students for college. Girls

High School

20
and Central High School are equal in that regard.,
The District Court* apparently* thought there was
a constitutional right to a coeducational academic education*
a right which I do not think this Court has ever found* and
3aid that it did not have to take into account the existence
of Girls

High School and that Petitioner's desire to attend

Central High School was sufficient basis for its ‘decision*
though it did find that under the rational relationship
standard the school district’s policy passed constitutional
muster in the words of the District Court,
Your Honor* essentially* Girls
as good as Central High School.

High School is just

The only finding in the

record -«* and it wasn't a finding that was a basis for the
District Court's decision — concerns the science facilities,
Your Honors* and that finding* apparently* is based cm a
statement by a student who -was a .witness for the Petitioners*
that Central has a student-built cyclotron and a classroom
planetarium.

There is nothing else in the record concerning

the science facilities.

And in the record is the very

extensive science program available for the females at
Girls

High School,

The course list which is in the record

in Exhibit D2 is quite extensive, really more extensive than
that available at Central High School.

Essentially, we are dealing with two institutions
which are equal in preparing students for college.

At one

21
point, the District Judge said they were comparable.

Under

either statement of the comparison between the two schools,
we are satisfied that they are substantially equal.
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals didn't disturb

that. I take it?
MR. GILBERT:
QUESTION:

No sir, it did not, Your Honor,

Did they affirmatively agree with it?

MR. GILBERT:

Yes.

In the statement of the case

by the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals summarized the
party's position that the schools for boys and girls are
comparable in quality, academic standing and prestige.
That's at 5(a) of the petition.
QUESTION:
from identical.

Comparable Is quite a different word

You can compare anything, or any two or

more things,
MR. GILBERT:

We are not arguing that the two

institutions in question are identical.

Obviously, they are

two separate institutions.
QUESTION:

One for women and one for men,

MR. GILBERT:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That really is about the only difference, Your Honor,
in the two schools.
QUESTION:

Well, there is an additional science

teacher at Central, isn't there?
MR, GILBERT:

And there probably are --

22

QUESTION:

The record does show that, doesn't it?

MR. GILBERT:
QUESTION:

I think that was in the interrogatories

And there is no compensatory additional

member of the faculty at Girls?
MR. GILBERT:

I think the record does show that,

Your Honor, but there are additional —
QUESTION:

And there is a finding that, In scientific

facilities, at least, Central is superior.
It still means they are comparable.

One is

superior and the other is inferior, and they are comparable.
MR. GILBERT: Your Honor, as I suggest, that finding
is not of particular relevance in this case because ~~
QUESTION:

Very relevant.

First of all, we have

to know what kind of a case we have here.
MR. GILBERT:

You have a case of equal schools,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

That's not what Finding 26 indicates,

and Finding 26 was left undisturbed, as were all the other
findings, by the Court of Appeals.
MR. GILBERT:

Am I wrong about that?

You are right, Your Honor, except for

Finding 51* which I think was, while not specifically re­
versed by the Court of Appeals, that was the finding on the
academic quality of the other high schools, the comprehensive
high schools, we alleged to the Court of Appeals that the
other high schools have within their programs, academic

23
programs, if you will, along with the general course of
study for students who are not interested in going to college,
but that these programs, these academic programs were the
equal of Central and Girls High School in preparing students
for college.
And the statement of the Court of Appeals was that
the comprehensive schools "provide a wide range of courses,
including those required for college admissions and offer
advanced placement classes for students who are intellectually
able to progress at a faster than average rate."
That’s at 2{a) and 3(a) of the petition.

And it is

pointed out by the petitioner that any petitioner who, upon
not desiring to go to Girls High School went to a comprehen­
sive high school, George Washington High School, and was able,
from that school, ,

to go to the University' of Pennsylvania

and skipped her senior year in high school.
QUESTION:

These terms.

MR. GILBERT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Nov;, the term "comparable" is used

throughout this record.

Is it used In the sense of things

which are subject to being compared, or does it mean

Is

the word used In the sense that the intelligence of women is
comparable to the intelligence of men, that they are
essentially the same, that there is no difference?
MR. GILBERT:

I think they are essentially — Used

24

In that sense, comparable in this case means essentially
equal.
QUESTION:

Is comparable better or less than

separate but equal?
MR. GILBERT:

For purposes of this case, Your Honor,

I think It is the same.
QUESTION:

It is the same as separate but equal.

MR. GILBERT:

Comparable -- I think that perhaps the

Court, having used equal In the one finding, Finding Number 18,
the District Court, that is, Your Honor, probably should have
used it throughout consistently.

However, it did make the

finding that the two schools are equal in preparing students
for college, irrespective of whether Central or Girls may have
one or more teachers in a particular department -- They are
not the Identical school.
QUESTION:

But they did say, specifically, that the

chemistry, physics, etcetera, was below.
MR. GILBERT:
QUESTION:

No, I don't think so, Your Honor.

They said science was below.

MR. GILBERT:

It said scientific facilities.

The

scientific program, Your Honor, is quite a different story.
As a matter of fact, the finding of the District Court was
that the courses at the two schools are comparable and of
equal quality, at that is-QUESTION:

Except, they also said the science

25
department was less.
MR, GILBERT:

I don't mean to be argumentative,

Your Honor, but -QUESTION:

Well, if you are going to take those

findings, you have to take them all.
MR. GILBERT:

That's not the finding, Your Honor.

The finding is that -■*
QUESTION:

Well, what about the library?

MR, GILBERT: ~~ scientific facilities, not science
program or courses.

Science program or courses at Girls

High may be superior to that at Central High School.
QUESTION:

I am not interested in that,

I am

interested in what they found to be Inferior, and they did
find it to be inferior.
MR, GILBERT:

Scientific facilities, Your Honor,

not science program,
QUESTION:

Well, that's inferior.

MR. GILBERT:

The finding was on scientific

facilities.
QUESTION:

Well, why is it separate but equal?

MR. GILBERT:
QUESTION:

Why are the schools equal, Your Honor?

Why are they separate?

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, the school district here

is pursuing a respected pedagogical method, something
has been stipulated to by the petitioner,

It is pursuing a

26
policy In its academic --the high schools are providing an
option for students*

They can either take -- go into the

comprehensive high school and take the academic program there
and they are coeducational,

or they can go to a single-sex

school.
There is evidence in the case, not just stipulations,
Your Honor, of recent studies that were done suggesting and
supporting Dr* James Coleman's study that coeducation may be
inimical to academic achievement and social adjustment.
With that kind of evidence in the case, Your Honor,
1 think it is perfectly reasonable for a school district to
make this option available.
QUESTION:

It is, I think, highly relevant -«

I don't understand the option.

QUESTION;

Why deny it to the boys?

If Girls High

Is so great, why not allow the boys to go there?
MR. GILBERT:

Because, Your Honor, there are

relevant, and I think highly relevant, pedagogical reasons
for making the option available of single-sex education.
It Is something which this record demonstrates is relevant to
the school district's basic purpose of providing educational
opportunities and the best education available to parents
and students and educators who may wish to avail themselves
of that option.
QUESTION:

The entry requirements for the two

schools are quite a bit different from other schools, and
doesn't Philadelphia frankly anticipate a higher grade of
student in the two schools, or not?
MR, GILBERT:

Your Honor, the pertinent comparison

would be between Central and Girls High School and the
academic students at the comprehensive high schools, and no

such study was done.

A study was done and there was

evidence comparing the comprehsive high schools, in toto, to

QUESTION:

Let's put it this way.

If the education

at the boys’ school and the girls' school in Philadelphia,
these two schools we are talking about, if the education at
those two schools is better, generally, than In the compre­
hensive high schools, the only way that a young man or young
girl can get that brand of education Is by going to a single­
gender school,
MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor’s major premise is the one

which I would not agree with.
QUESTION:

I didn’t put it as a premise.

MR0 GILBERT:

I said if.

If that were the case, Your Honor,

then I would agree that there would probably be the two
schools to go to.
QUESTION:

And so that on that, If you want to

call it, a premise

On that premise, the only way a person

can get that level of education is by going to a, school,
either all boys school or all girls school,
MR, GILBERT:
The

That would be correct, Your Honor.

Excuse me, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

I take it that part of the argument

you describe is the freedom of states and their subdivisions
to experiment in educational areas.

29

MR* GILBERT:

Yes, Your Honor, the decisions of

this Court in various cases, as recently as San Antonio
Independent School District v* Rodriguez, stated that it is
important for the local educational bodies to have the
ability to be flexible In its pledge to educational
methodology, as long as there is no Inequality, no invidious
discrimination between Individuals*
QUESTION;

He contend ~~

How long has this experiment of

separate races been going on in Philadelphia?
MR, GILBERT:
QUESTION:

Separate sexes, Your Honor?

Yes, sir*

MR* GILBERT:

These two schools have been in

existence for a number of years,
QUESTION:

So it is not an experiment, is it?

MR* GILBERT:

This particular mode of education,

I think, is being reevaluated and reexamined.
As recently as last month, in a study which I cited
in the brief, educators have come out with a conclusion that
it maj’’ be better for students to be educated at single-sex
schools.

And just because the policy evolved In the Nineteenth

Century, as vie admit that it did, does not mean that educators
cannot reexamine it and experiment again with It*
QUESTION:

I suppose, for example, in the field of

corrections in this country,we've been in the business, now,
for nearly 200 years, the states are still experimenting and

30

there is a widespread view that we haven't discovered the
right solutions yet.

So there is nothing wrong with experi­

ments that go along for 100 years or more, is there?
MR. GILBERT:

I would agree, Your Honor, and that

may be particularly true in education.

Educators have an

ability to reexamine their prior methodologies and say that
they would like to try a different type of education, maybe
this would be better.
QUESTION:

Does the record tell us when the

Philadelphia School Board last reexamined this question of
whether there should be separate schools for the two?
MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, the record doesn't tell

us that, but the School Board, every year, passes on the
budget for the schools,
QUESTION:

But does it tell us whether the Issue

has ever been presented to the Board as to whether or not one
or both of these schools should be made coeducational?
MR. GILBERT:

Well, Your Honor, the Board directed

the defense of this case.
QUESTION:

Other than the fact that they authorized

the defense of the case?

sex schools — "I think we can do well to provide that for
those who want the opportunity,"
So it is something which the educational people in
the school district have been examining throughout,
I am sure there is debate even in the school
district of the merits of coeducation or single-sex.

QUESTION:

I take it you are tacitly conceding that

MR, GILBERT:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your.Honor.

Well, let's suppose there were five one

way and one the other.

Is not the trier of facts totally

free to accept the one and reject the five, if he wants to?

I think what the trier of facts was

this case, not whether there is a preponderance of the

In a criminal matter.

I was just trying to show that we are

I think we did that.

The District Court said we did that by virtue of

proved Dr, James Coleman's hypothesis concerning single sex in coeducation.
QUESTION:

There is a controversy here, Your Honor,

qualify for admission to one of these two schools — Does the

these schools?

How many of those who qualify elect to go to

one of the single-sex schools and how many elect to go to a
coed school?

QUESTION:

From that, we could neither conclude that

some persons were passing up the opportunity, nor that

conclude anything about it,
MR0 GILBERT:

I wouldn’t conclude anything from

that, Your Honor.
I would respectfully submit the.school district’s

questions, and pray that this Court affirm the judgment of the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Gilbert.

Ms. Wallis, do you have anything further?
MS. WALLIS:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHARON K. WALLIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. WALLIS:

For one thing, I would like to

attract the Court's attention, at some point, to the Exhibit
A in our Reply Brief which excerpts all the high school
related information from one of the ~~ from P12.
I think you will find it gives, you some overview and
some information that will be helpful in considering this
case.
Very briefly, the District Court reviewed every ,
single one of the justifications that was proffered here,
and found that they were without merit with respect to this
particular case.
The testimony xvas presentsd of two sorts.

One of

Dr. Jones' studies indicated, at best, that some male students
may to some slight extent benefit from single-sex education.
That was based on a study —
QUESTION:
adversary.

May I ask you the same thing I asked your

Suppose, contrary to your submission, we conclude

that the two schools were identical, or equal or substantially
equal, but nevertheless there is a gender-based classification

36
here and we have to get to the question of separate but equal.
Do you think the city must justify the gender-based classifi­
cation, at all, on the assumption that the two schools are
equal?
MS ® WALLIS:
QUESTION:

I think they must justify it.
At what level, if there is such a thing

as different levels?
MS„ WALLIS:

Well, I think that what this Court

has said, really, is that you must scrutinize the justification.
Let me give you an example.

They purported to

prove -- and there does seem to be some evidence to this
extent — that some female students benefit from single-sex
education, because they are afraid to express themselves in
the presence of boys, or whatever it may be.
Let!s assume for present purposes that that
evidence is valid.

You cannot use that argument to sustain

the continued existence of Central as an all-male institution,
because what you are doing is excluding female students who
may not belorg in that category, like Susan Vorchhelmer who,
obviously, is able to excel in a coeducational atmosphere.
QUESTION:

If the city submits, in good faith,

and it Is their fundamental belief that separate education
gets better educational results, suppose they just submit
that, and they say that’s the reason for it and there are

37
some bases In the literature, among the experts, for that
beliefo

How closely must we scutlnlze that submission?
MS. WALLIS:

You have to examine it.

You have to

examine it first to say is it really relevant to their goals*
now.

And that's what the District Court did.
If it Is true that some female students benefit from

single-sex education, that's a reason for having a school for
female students.

It Is not a reason for refusing to admit

female students to Central High School If they are, in fact,
female students who would benefit from Central.
So, you have to examine that.
Number two.
QUESTION:

They say there are educational -Let me just stop you there.

Could you validly say that those female students
should be given the privilege of attending an all-fema’le
school and yet males might feel the same way and they should
not be given the privilege of attending an all-male school?
How could you do

In other words, you are

suggesting you could have coeducational in female but you
can't have male and female?
MS. WALLIS:

Well, that's another point that I am

getting to,
QUESTION:

Well, it is directly responsive to your

point that that evidence is not relevant,
MS, WALLIS:

The question is:

In what way would --

38
Suppose we are successful in this lawsuit and female students
are admitted to Central High School.

Why would a male student

want to go to Girls High, since he already has a coed academic
school that he can go to?

That's Central High School.

Now, the next issue is, well, should he be able to
go to a single-sex school?

He can also go to a single-sex

school because the school district still has Thomas Edison
which ts a single-sex comprehensive school.

So he.can go to

an alltboys school, too, which is the reason °f their preferred
Justification.

And the District Court said they say it is

freedom of choice.
It canft be freedom of choice.

That can't be the

real reason because they don't offer choice to students who
are interested in academic education, and besides that -QUESTION:
real reason?

How Go you know that that isn't the

Do you psychoanalyze people to find that out?

MS. WALLIS:

No,

I think you have to address your

good Judgment to it,
QUESTION:

Would you allow some good Judgment in

the school board to say that this subject is in dispute,

It

has been in dispute for a couple of hundred years, or at least
one hundred, and we are going to try the general run of
schools coeducational, but we are going to try two special
schools, one for boys, one for girls,
about that?

Anything irrational

39
MSo WALLIS:

I am not suggesting in this argument

that they couldn't do that.

They have two comprehensive

schools, Edison and Kensington.

They may maintain those

schools under what we are asking for here, as single-sex
schools, as options for those students who would choose
single-sex education.
What we are saying is that you can't take, number
one, the best school In the system.

And, number two, jrou can't;

take the only academic schools and make them entirely single­
sex.

That's the problem here, that students who choose

academic schools are not given a choice.

And that's why

you can't say this is a freedom — this is in order to provide
freedom of choice “- that's what the District Court said
because you are only providing freedom of choice for the
people who choose a single-sex academic high school. You don't
have any idea who would choose a coed academic high school
because you don't offer that alternative.
QUESTION:

That statement that you've just made
/

clearly responds to Mr. Justice Marshall's question that
separate but equal is unconstitutional.

The statement youfve

just made.
MS» WALLIS:

In this case, is what I am saying.

But I haven't said, and I don't think I have to say,
in this case, that It would not be permissible for the school
district to maintain single-sex schools, and they do have two

40

others, as well as a female school, if they could justify
those.

And the only way to justify them on the theory that

they are based on freedom of choice is to show that a full
range of choices is generally available, which is not the
case here.
QUESTION:

Ms. Wallis, I notice that you haven't

made your statutory argument, nor, indeed, did Mr. Gilbert.
You waived it, or we didn’t give you an opportunity to, or
the time limitations didn’t?
MS. WALLIS:
QUESTION:
MS. WALLIS:
two reasons.
much narrower.

Do you want me to respond?
No.

I just want you to — Why didn't you?

The reason I didn’t "was — There are

One, I think that the constitutional argument Is
If you decide the case on the statute, in the

only way that would avoid the constitutional argument, then
you must decide that all schools must be coeducational,
because that’s what the statute must say, and I don't believe
v

that ~~ that's broader than wh^t — the relief that we are
asking for in this case, and therefore I wouldn't urge it on
this Court.
And I think there is a Section 5 problem which is
raised by the United States which I think is much more
difficult, again, than the constitutional problem here, so
I think it only creates difficulties.

It is better to decide

it on the narrower constitutional ground.
