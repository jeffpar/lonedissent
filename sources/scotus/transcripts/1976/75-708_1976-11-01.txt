MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

■America,
Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT EUGENE SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a case that arose out of the eastern district
of Kentucky.

7\nd the charges involve the obscenity laws

and conspiracy to violate the federal obscenity laws,. 1462
and 65.

The conduct occurred beginning, I think, in the

period back in 1970 and continued, theoretically, up to
February of 1973.
This Court, in June of 1973, enunciated and changed,
we suggest, what is the prevailing law and practice; and that
is to say, the standard for determining obscenity a la
Roth-Hemoirs.

And the counsel herein has filed in his petitio;

' the argument that certainly this is ex post
facto judicial law making, the change that occurred, and
that the court should not have used the Miller test for
conduct which occurred prior to the Miller test.
It had been, we suggest, the law and practice and
generally understood (although this Court had not articulated

4
it) that there were three elements.

This is what Mr.

Justice Brennan set forth in his Roth-Menoirs decision.

In

fact, even at one point when Justice Rehnquist, who was
appearing before a House committee to testify regarding the
views on some obscenity laws, discussed the fact that there
seemed to be — the obscenity law today had three elements to
it.

Although he did say that the last part of the test,

that is to say, the utterly without social value test, had
only been joined in by Justices Brennan, Fortas and
Chief Justice Warren.

But he suggests that until this Court

said something else, that it was going to be followed by
the lower appellate courts and the lower federal courts of
the country,

tod in fact that was what occurred.

And I think in the Solicitor General's brief in
response, and the seeming suggestion of confession of error,
he indicates

that all the appellate courts that have had

occasion to consider this decision did so in light of the
Rofch-Memoirs test and not — and thus it sort of had become
the law in practice.
The Sixth Circuit, without viewing the film in
question — films in question — found the particular
material obscene, they 3aid, under either test,

tod of

course that was a matter to which Judge McCree dissented.
tod so we start with the proposition that there
was — the Roth-Memolrs test was the law in practice.

It

was assumed to be the law in practice by defendants, by
courts, the lower appellate courts, state courts, federal
courts all across the country, even though this Court had not
so articulated its and that there came a time when this Court
did articulate new standards, and that was of course in
June of 1973.
So all of the conduct for which Mssrs. Marks and
Mohney and the associate members of their group were charged
occurred prior to this Court's enunciation of a new test.

And

we say that, based on the law, the Bouie v. City of Columbia
and the other cases we have cited in our brief, that
obviously this is an expansion, this is a judicial gloss,
this is a change, this i3 a detriment that has occurred to
the defendants, and thus they should not be held accountable
and chargeable under that more severe test — certainly severe
as to the defendants.

And we say that in this context, the

court erred in not allowing us to have the case tried under
the Roth-Memoirs standard, and thus erred in not allowing us
to have expert witnesses or other testimony which would have
elucidated evidence in light of the Roth-Memoirs standard.
We also —
QUESTION:

The statute has always remained the

same, hasn't it, Mr. Smith?
MR. SMITH:

The statute has remained the same.

is correct, the statute has remained the same.

That

It has not

6

changed.

However, as you —- as you had occasion, sir, when

you testified before the House committee, I think, and on
page 430 of the report of the hearing before subcommittee
number three, I think yotir honor opted for the fact that it
was better to have a general definition of obscenity than to
have a more restricted definition.

I think you said, Mr.

Chairman, I think we have the same reservations as Mr.
p?101

Hawley expressed.

The extreme]

detailed definition of

sexualConduct, sexual excitement and sadomasochistic
abuse seems less desirable than the more general phraseology
found in the administration bill.

QUESTION:

Well, I repudiated that testimony first

by joining the Chief Justice's opinion in Miller, and then
I wrote Hamling.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

But I'm saying that before

Miller, this is, of course, the concept that we all had.
And even your honor at that time was expressing a concept
of the department of Justice.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

So I --

It’s not binding on the rest of us, is it?
No, sir, of course not.
And it's not binding on him, is it?
No, sir.
So what are you relying on?
Relying on the fact that the Roth-

Memoirs was in fact the test, and that this was a judicial

7
gloss that changed things.
Well, we think, your honor, we take in essence by
adding up figures we think we can come up with seven justices,
if I may.
First, we have Mr. Justice Brennan, and joined by
Chief Justice Warren and Fortas, who made two significant
modifications in the previous Roth standard.

And that this,

in essence, became the law in practice from 1966 to 1973,
because Justices Black, Douglas and Stewart agreed, and could
be counted upon to reach the same result but for different
reasons.
QUESTION:

Justice Fortas wasn't on the Court from

1966 all the way to 1973, was he?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No, sir, he was not.
So can you count him for all that period

of years?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

But when we took Justice Douglas

and Black who say that there are no laws, and Justice Stewart
who says, only hard core, and Justice Harlan, who says in
federal cases only hard core is applicable, then I think
we're dealing with a majority, a clear majority.
QUESTION:

Oh, I thought you said a seven man

majority.
MR. SMITH:

Well, I say if you added that group,

I think that at the time of the decision; in Roth and Memoirs 9

e
we're talking about adding ths figures up, we're talking
about approximately seven justices.
QUESTION:

Okay.

When was the — what year was

the decision, then?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

1966.
But you're not suggesting that it

subsisted for any given number of years after that?
MR. SMITH:

It has not changed.

It has become the

law in practice as enunciated by every federal appellate
court in the country, and almost every state appellate
court in the country.
law.

Roth-Memoirs was thought to be the

And as I said, your honor even — with the Department

of Justice -- and I agree that it’s not binding, and any
Solicitor General's brief on the matter is not binding —
certainly it appeared to be the law of the land upon which
defendants would rely in governing their conduct so as not
to offend the federal criminal lav;.
An,d we say that what occurred certainly was in the
connection with the Court's enunciation of the standards in
Miller, the Court suggests that this is the first time since
Roth that the Court's majority has been able to agree upon
the formulation of standards.

Mr. Justice Burger refers to

the fact that the Roth-Memoirs test was — at least for the
State of California — was correctly regarded as the
appropriate test at the time the conduct was committed.

And

9

so we again say that defendants
that particular factor.

have the right to rely on

Arid because of the change in the

law in Miller, which occurred after the conduct involved
here, we certainly think that oux* clients, certainly under
procedural due process, are entitled to this aspect of
protection, constitutional protection.
Our second argument primarily directs itself to the
failure of the appellate court to review the movies in
question.

In this instance, they took — two of the justices -

judges -— looked at the affidavits in support of the search
warrants and made their conclusion that this was hard core
*

pornography.
Unfortunately, hard core pornography is not a
talisman that says that anything that is hard core
pornography is, in and of itself, obscene.

Elsewise, it

would not have been necessary for this Court through Justice
Burger’s decision to enunciate three definitive aspects of
ii?hat is to be used to define material that can be condemned
as obscene.
So the appellate court refused to look at the film.
We feel that they should have looked at the film.
responsibility

It is the

— it’s a mixed question of law and fact.

And we suggest that they erred in avoiding their duty to
look at the films, and that they should be required to do so.
QUESTION:

Are you telling us this is constitutionali/

10

required?
MR. SMITH:

Given the fact that it is — we suggest,

your honor, that given the fact it is a mixed question of
law and fact as enunciated by this court, we do feel that
they have the responsibility to look at the material and
determine not just the normal question of whether the
material is — like a finding of fact, it would not
otherwise be reviewed? a jury finding.

I think Justice

Clark took that position in earlier cases, particularly in
the Roth--Memoirs — in the Memoirs case.

But it was never

joined in by other members of this Court.
QUESTION:

What provision of the constitution do you

rely on when you say that it must be viewed by the appellate
court?
MR. SMITH:

We draw our strength, if we may, from

the penumbra of the First Amendment, and say that this is
necessary to avoid a chilling that may occur in a particular
region, because an appelate court — or in a particular
jurisdiction, because a court in that jurisdiction may be
conservative, perhaps, more narrow in its point of view.
I think it's important that, at least within the region,
that the appellate courts be required to assert the
responsibility —
QUESTION;

You mean your clients would be chilled

if we didn't look at these movies?

And

11
MR. SMITH:

Your honor, it's not just our clients

being chilled.
212

QUESTIONi
MR. SMITH:

Well/ isn’t that the supposition?
I'm suggesting that there would be

a chilling effect on other things, not just my clients,
your honor.

I'm arguing for a broader approach.

And I'm

not saying that you should look at them.
QUESTION:

Well, are you arguing for — oh, you

don't think we have to look at them?
MR. SMITH:

I didn't say that in this case, for the

resolution of these issues, that it was necessary for this
Court to look at these films.
QUESTION:

Well, why was it necessary for the court

of appeals to?
MR. SMITH:

Because this is a discretionary review

on the part of your honor, and your honors, as to whether or
not you decide to grant review in a petition for certiorari.
QUESTION:

Well, we granted the review.

Now do we

have to look at it?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

I don't think it"s necessary

for the resolution of the arguments in this ca3e.
I think these are legal arguments.

Because

Now the question of

whether —
QUESTION:
court of appeals?

And it wasn't a legal argument in the

12
MR. SMITH:
to look at it.

We weren't permitted — the court refused

We argued to them* we said, you know, you

must review —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Excuse me.
— yes, sir.
You complain about the fact that they

did not look at it.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Did not look at it.
If we don't look at it, are you going to

complain about us not looking at it?
MR. SMITH:

No, I am not.

Because I don't think

it's necessary to the resolution of these three issues.
QUESTION:

What if you had a judge in the court of

appeals who was blind?

And the'&e- have been judges in state

\

and federal courts who were blind.
that?

What do you think about

Can that vacuum not be filled by having an explicit

description of the materials?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

But an explicit description

of the materials accompanied by the sound track to which he
could listen, and not the — we suggest — the possible
prejudice involved of an FBI agent who's trying to get a
search warrant, and who may not discuss the potential serious
literary, artistice values that may exist.

So I do think,

yes, in a different kind of environment, with a neutral -it's like a translator in a court, your honor.

If someone

13

speaks Greek, and he’s coining up for trial, the court will
arrange certainly through — if possible, to get a witness
or a defendant involved — to get a translator.
approved by the court.

But it’s

Xt8s not somebody who is working in

the prosecutor's office and who says, oh, well, I can come
and do it.

So I am suggesting, your honor, that there are

probably ways that that can be accomplished.

But I don’t

think it's through the affidavit of the FBI agent in this
particular regard.
And so wa feel that it becomes necessary --- and
there is certainly a conflict in the circuit — we think
it is necessary for the Court to resolve this issue; that at
least at the appellate level we should get a complete review
of the law and certainly the facts as are required.
The third point to which I address myself, which is
not — which is a matter that is in controversy between the
Solicitor

General and myself -— relates to the cor capt of

contemporary community standards.
The Court, over and over again in its charge to the
jury, suggests —* or it was said — that the jury was to
take the concept of community standards as the Eastern
District of Kentucky.

Now the Eastern District of Kentucky -

the jurors are not all drawn from the Eastern District.
Those which sit in Covington are drawn from the contiguous
counties around Covington.

Then there’s a court sitting in

14
Frankfurt, they're drawn from around there»

And if they're

sitting in Gatlinsburg, Kentucky, down along the West Virgini .
line, they're drawn from there.

But the court did not

delineate, or limit it, to the area from which the jury
itself came, but to the entire Eastern District, relying in
their concept on the words of Mr. Chief Justice — or Mr.
Justice Rehnquist in the Handing case.
We opted for something different.

We opted for,

primarily, a standard that would encompass the contemporary
community that would include the Cincinnati area.

We

suggested that through the voir dire process, that at least
half the jurors worked —- or their significant other spouses —worked in the Covington area.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that some of the jurors

were from outside the Eastern District of Kentucky?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

I said, some of the — all of

the jurors were from the area contiguous to Covinaton.

Half

/

of the jurors, or their significant others or spouses, worked
in Cincinnati.

They lived in the residency in Kentucky, but

they worked in Cincinnati.

Their whole social intercourse

primarily —
QUESTION:

So the entire jury venire, then, was

drawn from the Eastern District of Kentucky?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No, from the area contiguous to Covington.
Which is not part of the Eastern District

15

of Kentucky?
MR. SMITH:

It is part of -- but not from the

entire Eastern District.
QUESTION:

Well, I didn't say anything —■ I said

the entire jury venire —
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
—• was drawn from the Eastern District

of Kentucky, is that correct?
MR. SMITH:

That’s correct.

And, as I stand, we could stand on the courthouse
steps in Covington, and you could

see Cincinnati across

the river, the newspapers are published in Cincinnati, there
were —
QUESTION:

A good number of your venire came from

metropolitan Cincinnati on the Kentucky side?
MR. SMITH:

That is correct.

they must disregard, in essence

But the judge said

by only using the Eastern

District, they must disregard the Cincinnati area.

And

we felt that that was grossly unfair in view of the —
and we opt, really, more than anything else, for what Mr.
Justice Rehnquist said, in essence, in Jenkins.

And that

is, without a definition of a geographical standard, but
just using community in a general sense — which I think
was one of the imports of the holding in the Jenkins case -—
QUESTION:

Well, on your theory, I take it that if

16
a person lived in Connecticut, spent three days a week there
as so many of them do, and spent four days a week on his
profession or business in New York City, that he could not
divorce himself from the off-Broadway standards — the
off-Broadway show standards *
MR. SMITH:

Is that the general idea?

Sir,..I think it is not from this

standpoint, if I may: Newport, where the film was shown, is
just right across the river from Cincinnati.
QUESTION:
that argument.

1' can understand the prosecution making

Ism a little — I'm not quite so clear about

your making it.
MR. SMITH:

Your honor, this is the only adult

theater in the whole Eastern District of Kentucky.

But there

were adult theaters and there were adult bookstores in
Cincinnati.

And if you're going to talk about the level

of tolerance and the community standard, w7e certainly are opting
to have the larger community, that is to say, the metropolitan
community, included to make it meaningful.

And that's why

I would have preferred, certainly, had the judge given the
charge of the contemporary community standards without
defining a geographical limit so that we could have argued
to the jury about what is the community, what is the definition
of the community, and make it, we suggest, more meaningful.
But when the judge says, you must consider the
standards of the Eastern District of Kentucky, and that's

17
the entire district, not just where the jury's drawn, and
you consider that most of the Eastern District is Appalachia,
we're not dealing with anything that is meaningful in
terms of these defendants in this particular case.
QUESTION:

But you can argue, certainly, to the

jury, can’t you, that Covington and Newport are part of the
Eastern District of Kentucky?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

They are.
And that the people who live there are

as capable of contributing to the standards of the Eastern
District as are people in which — or, what is Appalachia.
MR. SMITH:

That’s true.

But we also opted, as

I said, because Cincinnati did have ■— that was more the
cultural level, the cultural center, the center in terms
of the entertainment industry and such like that, that
that became a relevant part of the standard.

And so we felt

it was extremely important that the jury be allowed to
consider that of which they knew, whatever they knew about
that community standard, to be incorporated intc part of
the whole in this particular regard.

So for that reason,

we move to ask thatthe community be enlarged.
Now there was some evidence that was adduced by
soma of the experts in cross-examination and direct examination
regarding their background, and that they were basing their
opinions in part on what occurred in other places.

But the

18

jury was effectively precluded from considering that by
virtue of the court’s instructions regarding the Eastern
District.

And we ware effectively precluded from presenting

evidence of the materials of the community —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We’ll resume there at'

10:00 o'clock In the morning, connad.
[Whereupon the Court was recessed at 3:00 o'clock
p.m., to be reconvened at 10:00 o'clock a.n„, the next
