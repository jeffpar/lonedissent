MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume arguments

in United States against County of Fresno»
Mr» Waterman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. WATERMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE, COUNTY OF FRESNO ~ Resumed
MR. WATERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I wish to deal this morning with Title 16 of the
United States Code, Section 480, in which Congress did express
its intention that there should be a dual jurisdiction in the
national forests between tie federal government in so far as
crimes against the United States are concerned, which were left
to the United States, and reserving to the State wherein the
national forest is located its jurisdiction, and it did not
deprive the inhabitants thereof of their rights and privileges
as citizens or be absolved from ’their duties as citizens of
the State.
Now, our contention is that one of those duties is the
payment of the local ad valorem real property tax.

And, as has

been ©stressed, sine© we* re talking about property that is in
th® public domain and tax-exempt, the only means by which such
a tax can be paid is through th© possessory interest tax.
In other words, ’the tax on the beneficial us© and
occupation of tax-exempt property.

And that is --

32

QUESTION:

Do fell© States levy a sales tax on trans™

actions within a national park, like Yellows-bone Park?
MR, WATERMAN:

I believe -- I think it's Johnson vs,

Yoseiaite, where that specifically was excluded,

You1 re correct,

Mr, Chief Justice,
However, we do —- the State of California does levy
s sales tax on retail sales in the national forest areas,
S© that has not, been precluded.
However, we're mainly talking about an increment of
local property tax, which benefits those inhabitants, and I5m
speaking specifically now to the increment that goes to the
local school district tax.

That is based, in. California,

primarily on the local real property tax.
Now, there was some testimony, or statement yesterday
that some of -these people have resided in these government;
homes in the national forests for two or -three years. There
is evidence in this record that in one case an employee had
Deen in the same single-family residence for fifteen years.
Now, during that period •— and of course, this would be prior
to 1968, when vre started imposing this tax ~ in effect he
would have paid no increment whatsoever to the local school

tax.
If he had a six-year-old child when he moved into
that home, that child would have gone through the local
school district to the elementary schools, the high school, and

33
two years of the community college,, if that

were the case,

being a hypothetical situation.
QUESTION:

Co\ald the State not charge him tuition as

a non-resident?
MR. WATERMAN:

No, sir.

QUESTION: They couldn’t?
MR. WATERMAN:
QUESTION:

In a public —

What would prevent that?

MR. WATERMAN:

The public school system of

California provides for no direct payment for non-residents.
QUESTION:

Oh. I say could the State

does it,

have legal power to say to someone living in a federal enclave?
MR. WATERMAN:
I think

I would think not, Your Honor»

obviously they are citizens of the United States,

they ar© citizens of the State, I think that 'they could not.
I think it would be a denial of equal protecti.,in if they tried
to impose that type of thing.
Now, it*s different at a higher level of education,
of course, universities do charge an out-of-State —
QUESTION:

I take it you*re not attempting to tax

where the United States reserves exclusive jurisdiction?
MR. WATERMAN:

No, sir.

That is — it is not

allowed in California by regulation, where ~
QUESTION: Well, while I hav® interrupted you, does

California attempt to apply this tax to anyone ©Is® besides

34
Uni tad States Government employees?

What about — are there

other kinds of classes of people in this saras position, like
ministers or —
MR. WATERMAN:

Well, w@ do not — to ray knowledge,

we don't, apply it to ministers, even though they may be
residing in a manse on tax-exempt property.

However, for every

tax-exempt special district, such as irrigation districts,
Corps of Engineers ~ I might just give the Court a couple of
instances as to how -this case is going to affect other
possessory interests.
QUESTION: Well, what about other instances where
property is tax-exempt, besides that which is owned by the
federal government?
MR. WATERMAN:

Right. County property ~~ let me

give you that for instance, if I may.

We charge a possessory

interest tax to our road super-visors in the County of Fresno
who reside in county-owned residence, for —
QUESTION: Do they pay a rent?
MR, WATERMAN:
possessory interest tax.
QUESTION:

Yes, sir. They pay rent and the
Where -there are State forests.rs —

And income tax, too?

MR. WATERMAN:

Well, we don't have a county, they

pay a State income tax.
QUESTION:

I mean a State income tax.

MR» WATERMAN:

Yes, sir.

That's correct.

35
Where there are State, forests. — we do not have any
in Fresno County —• but they also, and this was one of the
original contentions in this ease, was that there was dis­
crimination because we didn't, the State didn't charge its
own employees a possessory interest tax*

That is not true»

It is charged» They pay it on the same basis that we have been
asking the federal employees to pay it»

So it is non-

discriminatory from that, standpoint»
QUESTION;

Does your answer to Justice White's

question about exclusive jurisdiction answer the government’s
suggestion that next time you will be here trying to tax
people in post housing on military bases?
MR» WATE RMAN;

I be Have it does, Justice Rehnquist»

After all, the California regulations — we would have, to
change our regulations, and I think, if we did that, to meet
Congress's expressed intention to b® -She exclusive taxing -~
if there is to be any tax, in an exclusive, military enclave»
Now, I just don't foresee the State of California
ever trying to tax any military in that, situation»
QUESTION:

Counsel, how does the constitutional issue

become any different simply because California has not elected
to try to impose the tax on exclusive federal property?
If your theory is right, you’d have the power to do so, I would
think.»
MR» WATERMAN:

No, I think the

the question was

36

asked yesterday whether Congress would have has power to
exempt this type of property®
QUESTION:

Mo®

But we —

I mean, assuming Congress has not

don© anything on© wav or the other® v Would your theory not
permit you to tax the occupancy of barracks on a military
reservation?
MR® WATERMAN:

Not under the existing definition of

possessory interest, Your Honor, and I
QUESTION:

Not. under your existing regulation, but

MR. WATERMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

-- but constitutionally you could amend

the regulations and do so, if you're right? couldn’t you?
MR® WATERMAN:

We would have to amend our definition

of possessory interest also, Your Honor.
QUESTION: But is there any reason, any constitutional
reason, if you’re correct, whyvou could not do so?
MR® WATERMAN:

Well, I’m sure we could®

I’m sure

we would be right back in court if we did, though, Your Honor®
I think, as far as the case law, and we have, of
course, cited the Michigan cases as authority for this, the
imposition of this tax®

We believe that Graves^ vs ®_ New York,

which allowed the State income taxation of federal employees
to be the closest®

And I could read the language from — there

has been a claim here that somehow this tax burdens the
federal government®

37

One* we do not admit that these employees in their
privata housing which is furnished by the government* for which
they pay a rent* we do not believe -that they are an instru­
mentality of the federal government for that purpose* and
therefore the tax is permissible,,
However,, the government* who is also a party plaintiff
in this matter* alleged that there was a burden against the
United States by reason of the imposition and collection of
this tax»
There was absolutely no evidence in the trial of these
matters of any burden whatsoever»
a tax bill»

The government does not get

The government is not assessed»

goes to the individual employee»

The tax bill

And* aside from 1967* to my

— it's my understanding that these tax bills have been paid
to til© county without protest sine© that time.

I could be in

error on that»
QUESTION:

But* if it ware not for these federal

enclaves* the bill would go to the federal government, wouldn’t
it?

MR» WATERMAN:

No* I don’t think we have any right;

to bill the federal government for taxes on —
QUESTION:

I say* if it were not for the federal

enclave point* the billing would go to the owner of the
building? right?

The landlord,»

MR® WATERMAN:

No* Your Honor* we are taxing the

38

parson in possession in this situation on tax-exempt property,
QUESTION:

But if the building was outside of the

enclave, and was owned by Hr. U.S., —
MR. WATERMAN:

Yes, sir,

QUESTION: — Mr, U.S. would pay the taxas.
MR. WATERMAN:

We would not assess that property if

it was owned by the United States.
QUESTION:

I said Mr. U.S., I didn’t say the United

States.
MR, WATERMAN:

Oh. Iem sorry, I -thought you were

referring to the United States, —
QUESTION:

That’s right.

MR. WATERMAN:
QUESTION:

— as an individual.

But if it was owned by the United States,

then you would tax the tenant.
MR. WATERMAN;

That’s correct, sir.

QUESTION s But you really are shooting for the land-»
lord,
MR. WATERMAN:

That’s —• yes, we don’t divide the

imposition of the tax in California, other than in -the taxexempt properties situation.

The real property' itself is

security for the real property tax in California, and there
is not a separate assessment to a private lessee from a private
lassor,
This is correct.

39

I started to mention that we do have other* federal
land within the County of Fresno# which -» in which we are
imposing this possessory interest tax.

We do have a rather

substantial veterans hospital there, which has private
residences — well# there are single-family residences for
several doctors and the administrator»

They are very nice#

high-valued homes»
If —- we ar© concerned that if this Court does not
uphold the District Court of Appeals# they will feel that they
no longer ha\r@ to pay a possessory interest tax? and I think
that would b© the effect of such a decision»
The Corps of Engineers also has a facility in Fresno
County# at Pine Flat# where they built a rather nice dam»
They maintain maintenance people there in private# like private
homes but on the federal property.
QUESTION:

We charge —

Does Fresno County raise a considerable

sum from this possessory tax?
MR» WATERMAN:

Doilarwis©# no# Your Honor# it does

*

not»

I cannot give you an absolute figure# but it is not a

substantial amount of money# I would have to admit that.
However# the —
QUESTION:

Approximately how much?

MR» WATERMAN:

At the time# in 1968, I think the

total amount at issue here is $178 for 17 individual plaintiff
owners, or residences# yes.

40

QUESTION: An aggregate of $173?
MR. WATERMAN:

That's correct.

But that was based

upon a one-year tenancy at that time, and we are now, because
of the experience that we’vs had, we are now imposing a longer
period to capitalize the income. So it is mors. But I can't
give you an exact figure.
QUESTION;

Sorry.

How about the possessory interest tax

generally?

Well, it just applies to this kind of housing,

doesn't it?

Otherwise it’s a tax imposed on the landlord?

correct?
MR. WATERMAN;

That's correct, Your Honor.

I do have soma figures as to 1976 values in the
forest land.

Now, w© tax other, you know, private business

enterprises who lease from the federal government.

That tax

yield in dollars in 1975 was $89,622.
W© have a tax rate of $7.35 per $100 of assessed
valuation in the Sierra National Forest.

Those are the figures!

that I'm giving you now.
Nov?, all of those, obviously, are not — as a matter
of fact, a very small percentage of that tax yield would be
from federal housing. We hav© a lot of family cabins that are
located on 99-y@ar leases, and there is where -the bulk of
that valuation would come from.
QUESTION;

Tb@ issue 'is the same, the constitutional

issu® is th© same with respect to your taxing commercial

41
enterprises who lease from the federal government,, as it is
here?
MR. WATERMAN:

No, I think it’s differente

1 think

*— and I think this is the contention that the United States
is making, that all the precedent up till now, except for the
Graves case, has been where a private contractor, a corpora­
tion has been using government property for its own beneficial
use and enjoyment*,

I don’t think there’s any real question

there.
QUESTION:

But you do put your possessory interest

tax on those enterprises?
MR. WATERMAN:

Yes, sir, we do.

QUESTION: Does that raise a good deal of money for
the county?
MR. WATERMAN:

I believe — well, commercially, for

land and improvement — these are commercial excises now, it’s
§36,395 as of last year.
QUESTION:

But you think you could lose -this case

and still maintain your right to tax on the commercial
enterprises?
MR. WATERMAN:

Yes, sir, w® do.

Thank you.
QUESTION:

Mr. Waterman, could I ask —

MR. WATERMAN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; —just two very brief questions.

Is this

42

tax unique to California,- -this possessory interest tax?
MR» WATERMAN:

No# I understand that

Michigan had a similar type of tax»

1 th.ink

It’s probably not

I

think -they called it a use tax of a sort there.
15n not aware of any other Statas that have it,- Your
Honor.
QUESTION:

The other question I had,, does the

imposition of the tax depend on the character of the possessory
interest?

In other words# if it had not been a leas© arrange­

ment but# rather# had been some kind of a license just to# like
you go into a hotel room or something like that? would that
be enough to impose the tax?
MR» WATERMAN:

It has to be an exclusive possession

under our definition.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. WATERMAN:

And this is what the Court found it

was here.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. WATERMAN:

Very well# Mr. Waterman.

Thank you# sir.

Service personnel we have here and the many, many more Forest
Service personnel who work in the Stanislaus National Forest
in our County, who reside off federal premises.

They either

purchase homes, and many do, or they rent property.
When they purchase a home they must pay a property
tax as a homeowner; when they rent they are indirectly paying
property tax unless they have a landlord who doesn't want to
recoup his payment of taxes.
And if these particular individuals living in the

Yas. The' Sheriff®s Department provides

QUESTION; Well# would you mind if that doesn't
persuade me# anyway?
MR. DIETRICH;

That's ™- yes# Your Honor.

QUESTION:

All right.

QUESTION;

Mr. Dietrich# I didn’t quite follow you.

Just before we started questioning# you said that those who

46
live on the enclave would get a better deal than those who
lived off.

I tiiought it would be just the reverse.

Because

if they both paid the fair rental value of the property, the
one on the

the Forester would also pay the tax? the other

on© would not.
MR. DIETRICH % But they both would end up paying the
tax, and I think it was testimony in our ease or the County of
Fresno that the federal government really doesn’t take into
consideration taxes — that5s right, I recall that — take
into consideration taxes in their formula. So actually the
Federal Government, I suppose, is turning a profit.
It might, dollarwise, balance out in your case, I
think.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. DIETRICH: But the end result is they wouldn’t
support our services.
The way we look at it is these people are making a
private beneficial us© of this property. They are living there
as a home. They are not. $100,000 houses, but the testimony in
idle case was that people living in the homes found them quite
adequate for themselves and for their families, and they didn’t,
think they were getting that bad of a deal.We believe that these people should help pay for
all those services, excluding welfare, that they may be using
just like I us© and just like all the rest of the Forest

QUESTION: Do you agree with the proposition that what;
you are really doing is, sine© you can't collect the money from
the owner, the landlord, you collect it from the tenant.,
MR. DIETRICH:
yes»

That's what, in effect, we are doing,

W@ could not collect it from feha United States.
QUESTION: And so you are collecting it from the

tenant?
MR. DIETRICH:
QUESTION:

No, it comes from the individual»

From the tenant.

MR. DIETRICH:

From the tenant, right.

QUESTION: And it’s really aimed at the landlord.
MR. DIETRICH:
QUESTION:

No, it's for the individual —

Well, what is the other one?

MR. DIETRICH:

Pardon me?

QUESTION: What is your regular ad valorem tax?
MR. DIETRICH:
QUESTION:

It's on the property itself.

Is that aimed at the tenant?

MR. DIETRICH:

Well, if til a landlord lives there,

it's aimed at him? it's tha owner of -the property.
QUESTION:

That's right.

But you want — you really

want to collect the ad valorem tax on government property.
MR, DIETRICH;

Because of their private beneficial

use of the property.
QUESTION: That's right.

But you want it on the

Mow, for a person who is renting property,

area, you don't worry about putting a use tax on him, because
you have collected real estate tax on the house,

suggestion would appear to be that this is a substitube for

that tax.

MRo CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Dietrich.
You have about three minutes left, Mr» Shapiro»
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR» SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr0 Shapiro, if you have a minute, if we

could get what you think about the exclusive enclave*
MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

I gather, we've been told that at least

Fresno's regulations do not apply this tax to, say, the
military living in housing on an exclusive enclave? but he
*

does say that constitutionally he thinks it can be done.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor.

We are informed by the .Department of the Navy -that
Humboldt County in California is attempting to tax Navy housing.
So that the potential for -.the imposition of this tax on the
military exists.
Now, with respect to this specific case, I should
point out that 16 U.S.C. 430 provides that State civil and

50
criminal juris die felon continuas fco apply in national forest
areas, so -that we’re not dealing with an exclusive federal
enclave when we talk about national forests.
However* 16 U,S,C, 480 is not a waiver of this
immunity of the United States* its instrumentalities or its
officers in connection with their duties, from the imposition
of State taxes,
Now, there's a second major point I*d like to make.
The Counties claim they are simply seeking to mak© up revenues
lost because national forests are non-taxable since it's
United States property,
16 'U,S, Code, Section 500 provides that the counties
shall receive 25 percent of the receipts from the national
forests located in their jurisdiction fco be applied for
roads and schools» so Congress has enacted a kind of "in lieu'5
tax because the national forests are not themselves directly
taxable.
Now, there's one other point.

Because -the tax is

on a federal function, in our view, there is no requirement
that a burden or interference of any other kind be shown than
that, the tax has been imposed. This Court has held that
national banks are not taxable by States, except to the extent
there's been a waiver,

Evan though there3s no burden on the

United States,
QUESTION s

Of course, if a military base were

51

involved,, you would be arguing that the States have absolutely
no jurisdiction inside the borders of the enclave»
MR, SHAPIRO; That would be our contention on any
exclusive military enclave»
QUESTION;

Yes» That's —

MR» SHAPIRO;

Now», there are military bases which

are like national forests# in the sens© that the federal
government hasn't ceded all civil and military — or has not
taken back all civil and military jurisdiction»
In those# again# we would argu® that the tax is like
a tax on the Post Exchange or Military Officers5 Club involved
in the Mississippi liquor case.

We would say it’s still

falling on a federal instrumentality or a federal function»
And once we establish that# then that's the end of any
demonstration# any need to demonstrate burden»

There's no

great burden on the United States# if military personnel pay
a tax on their liquor»

But the Court has held that that is

nonetheless uncons fcifcu tional»
The same is true for national hanks or the Red Cross#
for example»
Thank you# Your Honors»
MS» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you# Mr» Shapiro»
