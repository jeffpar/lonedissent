PROCKEDI N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll hear arguments

first tliis morning in No. 74-6438, Scott against Kentucky.
Mr. Rivkin, I think you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEAN HILL RIVKIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RIVKIN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court;
This case is here on a petition for a writ of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit, which rejected a claim by Kentucky prisoners that the
State Parole Board he required to abide by the minimum
guarantee of procedural due process in determining whether
or not to release prisoners on parole.
Specifically, the issue is twofold.
First, whether the decision to grant or deny parole
implicates an interest in liberty protected by the due process
/

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? and
Secondly, if the parole function is accorded
constitutional protection, what are the minimum safeguards that
apply?
Before addressing these questions, I will discuss
briefly the threshold question of maotness, which consideration
has been deferred until this hearing.

4
The State has suggested that -the release on parole
of the named petitioner has mooted this action.

It is our

position that this occurrence has not deprived -this action of
the necessary adversariness or the present vitality under
Article 3.
Three grounds support our view.
First, we believe that this is a case capable of
repetition between the parties, yet evading the plenary review
of this Court.
QUESTIONS

How do you explain Wernstein v. Bradford

on that basis?
MR. RIVKIHs

In this case, Your Honor, the petitioner

Scott is on parole until 1984.

lie is also required to abide

by a number of stringent, conditions on his liberty.
Bradford, the petitioner was totally

In

released from any

restrictions by the State on parole.
QUESTION:

But he was on parole, was he not?

MR. RIVKIN:

He — when the case was here and the

decision was rendered mooting the case, the petitioner Bradford
was off parole.

There was no

QUESTION:

lie had served his full time and wasn’t

even subject to parole?
MR. RIVKIN:

Yes.

He had served his full sentence,

that’s right.
Secondly, this is a paradox of a case which has evaded

3

the plenary review of tills Court.
QUESTION: Well, Mr, Rivkin, one other* question# if
I

fa ay *

MR. RIVKIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
If,now being on parole# his parole is

sought to be revoked# he would get a Morrissey type hearing#
would he not# on this?
MR. RIVKIN;
would.

Yes# he would# Your Honor.

Yes# he

That’s right.
But he would be returned —
QUESTION;

That’s because he new has a conditional

liberty outside the walls of the institution.

Under fch® terms of Morrissey, that’s

MR. RIVKIN;
right.

He would be returned to the institution# however# and

would likely be eligible for parole after a number of years
again.

As I say, his parole lasts until 1984.
Secondly, *—
QUESTION:
MR. RIVKIN;

His sentence, you mean, lasts until 1984.
His sentence, -that’s right.

Excuse

me.

Secondly, this is a case which has evaded the
plenary review of this Court in three other instances;
Scarpa vs. Board of Parole?

In

Johnson vs. New York Board of

Parole? and Bradford vs0Weinstein.'
The precise issue presented here has been mooted.
QUESTION;

Well, those aren’t two separata groundsj

6

together they are one ground, are they not?
MR. RIVKIN:

That is right. They are one of our three

grounds. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Tliat is, capable of repetition yet evading

review?
MR. RIVKIN:
QUESTION:

That’s right.

That's right.

That's

Up to now you have just spoken about

those -MR. RIVKIN;

Those are the two prongs of our first

ground., yes.
QUESTION; Right.
MR. RIVKIN;

Secondly., we belief's that this case

should be treated and maintained as a class action.

It was

commenced as a class action, but the district court did not
permit the complaint to be filed in forma pauperis, and dis­
missed the case, although it never was officially filed with the
court.
It only became a formal case with a number when the
United States

Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted

the motion to proceed in forma pauperis.
We believe that the district judge, in essence, pre­
cluded our moving for certification in this case.
Secondly, there’s no question that there’s a live
controversy here between the members of the class, the purported
class, the prisoners of Kentucky., and the Parol© Board,

7
Finally, under the intention of Rule 23, there are a
number of lower court cases supporting the proposition that
the justiciability of a case is not affected when the named
petitioner, or the named plaintiff is mooted, or the situation
of -the named plaintiff is mooted»
QUESTION:

That is, if it is a class action?

MR. RIVKIN:

If — regardless cf formal certifica­

tion, these cases hold, and they permit intervention.

And

that is my third point.
We have made a motion to substitute named petitioners
here, and, in the alternative, to intervene.

And we believe

that in the interests of judicial economy and in the important
interest of resolving tills issue which has come to this Court
four times, —
QUESTION; Did you do that in the Court of Appeals?
MR. RIVKIN:

No*

In the Court of Appeals, the named

petitioner Scott was still in prison, he lad not been paroled
yet*
QUESTION:

And did you move to. have it certified as

a class action?
MR. RIVKIN:

No, we did not move: that in the Court of

Appeals c
QUESTION:

You could have had intervention in the

Court of Appeals without any problem.
MR. RIVKIN:

There was no necessity to have it then,

10

QUESTIONs

The Court of Appeals mentioned in passing,

or in describing the case,, as I recall, that it was a class
action,
MR, RIVKINs

That's right.

So did th® district

judge, Your Honor, and I think they, in fact, treated it as a
class action.
Turning to the merits, the initial inquiry, as
established by the cases, is into the nature of the interest at
stake in the parole decision.
An understanding of the paroling process will show
that -this interest has ample substance to be embraced within
A

the concept of liberty protected by the due process clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment.
Parole is a statutory creation of the State, and it. is
an integral part of the sentencing apparatus of the State.
When an individual is sentenced, it is contemplated by the
Legislature, by the sentencing judge, by prison administrators,
and by the Parole Board that most prisoners will spend part of
their time in incarceration and part of their time on the
streetss on parole.
Among the critical decisions made about an individual
involved in the criminal justice system, the parol© decision
is one of the most important.

From arrest to conviction to

sentencing to in-prison deprivations to parole revocation, one
of the major concerns of the system is the length of incarcera-

II
tion tha; an individual will serve.
This concern is magnified in the parol® decision, which,
unlike the other decision points that I have mentioned, is not
accorded constitutional protection or due process protection of
any 3cind6
This conception of parole, as an integral part of the
system of government decision-making, determining the length of
incarceration of an individual, is often obscured by another
notion of parol® as simply another form of correctional treat­
ment that is left to the unbridled discretion of experts who
primarily are involved in predicting recidivism.
However common this conception was in days when
parol® was considered charity or a gift oi grace, it has not
and cannot withstand present-day scrutiny.
QUESTION%

Do you agree that the State could — a

State Legislature could simply abandon parole systems entirely?
MR. RXVKIN;

Yes, 1 do.

If a State abandons a parol®

system and modifies its sentencing system, which it would have
•to do, this case would not. b@ here.
This case does not involve th® constitutional rights
of parole, but only fair consideration in the process of
determining parole.
Today it is commonly accepted that the parol® decision
is based on a variety of factors, unrelated to th© predictive
ability of the board.

Soma of these considerations are the

12
past history of an individual, the offense the individual
committed, the person’s institutional record, the prison
population capacities in the particular State, and others»
To the extent that these factors enter the parol®
decision, which they most certainly do, the absolute claim of
expertise suggested by the State on

behalf of the Board carries

less force»
Our opponents probably would concede that a variety
of factors enter into the decision-making process of the Board,
but they claim that the Board has unfettered discretion to weigh
these factors in any fashion that they will»
I think a look at the Kentucky system will reveal that
the Board's discretion is not as uncahined as the State suggests,
Kentucky has created a scheme of conditional release
where prisoners spend part of their time in prison and part of
their time outside on conditional release»
Tills system is administered by a Board composed of
professional decision.-makers, who make upwards of 1,000 decisions
per year»
Although this Board is within -’die State Department of
Corrections, and relies on die STate Department of Corrections
for information, it is a statutory creature of its own within
the sentencing apparatus, and contemplated to be within the
sentencing apparatus of tee State»
By statute, die Board is required to abide by

13
certain ground rules which evidenced the legislature's concern;,
the Kentucky Legislature's concern with fair and complete
consideration in the parole process,,
The Board is required, mandated by statute, to amass
a good deal of information on an individual, and it’s allowed
to call on the resources of the Department of Corrections, the
State Police, and others, to gather this information®
Secondly, the Board is required by statute to study
•the case history or the record of the individual®
Thirdly, the Board is required ho deliberate on that
record? and
Fourth, to conduct a hearing, which it does, often
lasting five to ten minutes at the most#
Fifth, because the Board is composed of five members,
it is also required to engage in some sort, of collegial
decision-making®

It's not one individual —

QUESTION;

On the hearing, who attends trie five or

ten-minute hearing?
MR® RIVKINs The hearing is attended by normally all
members of the Parol© Board and the prisoner®
QUESTION;
MR® RIVKINs

That's all?
That's all, yes®

Finally, the Board has been requested by the
Legislature, or mandated by the Legislature to promulgate
regulations governing the phases of its operation, I believe

14
the statute says, in accordance with prevailing ideas of
correction and reform.
QUESTION:

Could the Legislature provide for no

hearing,, if they wanted to?
prisoner.

That is , no presence of the

Do you think that —
MR. RIVKIN:

That exists in, I think„ three States:

Georgia, North Carolina, and one other State.

There is no

hearing at all required.
The hearing here, of course, is rather short and what,
goes on inside, nobody is really quite sure.
But if a Legislature wants to dc that — ws don’t
think that that comports with minimum due process, of course,
if a Legislature wanted to do that.

We believe the hearing

is an integral element of the process that, is due.
QUESTION:
MR. RIVKIN:

Defined how?

Hearing defined how?

A meaningful hearing, a hearing in which

the individual is given an opportunity to present evidence, a
statement, meeting whatever adverse evidence is in the file
against the individual, very often there may be, for instance,
letters from people in the community who this person, the
prisoner, has no idea of who they are or why they’re writing
■these letters.
This chance to have a meaningful opportunity to meet
this evidence is one of the ingredients ©f the hearing that we

15

are requestingQUESTION;

What about assistance?

MR, RlVKIM; We believe that assistance by an advocate,
.whether an attorney or a lay advocate, would be essential.
The federal system allows a person's minister, a person's spouser
a person’s — member of the person's family to come in. This
hearing is structured, and we believe it can be structured, to
provide for a short presentationf and, according to some of the
preliminary data that's coming out of those hearings, the
assistance of an advocate is quite helpful.
QUESTION:

And would you allow prior access to the

letters?
MR. RIVKINt We believe

we also believe that that’s

one of the ingredients of due process.
One of the -QUESTION: Before the actual hearing?
MR, RIVKIN:

Before the actual hearing.

Once again, this is also provided by the U* S. Board
of Parole.

And this meets the substantial documentation of the

errors that are contained in parole files.

In fact, the Kentucky

Parole Board was recently scrutinised by a blue ribbon
commission, commissioned by the Governor of Kentucky, and they
found the filekeeping sloppy, and they found mistakes, and they
criticised it quite severely.
And, for this reason, we believe that access to the

16
file is important*
It would not provida much hardship for the State to
do that,, either, sine© there are two files, as I understand it,
maintained.

One at the prison where the individual lives, and

one in the Central Office where the Parole Board meets;.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rivkin, your brief, I notice, was

filed before this Court's decision in Meachum v. Fano.

Are you

going to discuss the application of that case to your conten­
tion?
MR. RIVKIN;

I plan to, Your Honor, yes.

QUESTION; But your oral submission here, in answer
to the questions of -the Chief Justice and of Mr. Justice
Brennan, have not deviated from your brief, as I understand,
Specifically II B 1, 2, 3 and 4, the last 20 pages of your
brief.

Those are -the four —
MR. RIVKIN;

That’s right.

Those are the criteria

that, we believe are required in the process, yes.
QUESTION; Right.
MR. RIVKIN:

That’s what I thought,

That’s right.

In terms of channeling th© discretion of the Board,
■the Board itself has promulgated 15 criteria that it says it
looks at.

The Board has also built up a. body of precedents

in the numbers, the vast numbers, of decisions that they make
each year.
As I say, these are professional decision-makers.

17
They make decisions according to precedents and criteria»

They

have listed the 15 criteria,» and we believe that if an
individual prisoner and his or her

record makes an adequate

showing before this Board, that parole will likely @nsue0
Finally, the statistics, nationwide and in Kentucky,
show that most individuals are p<iroled»

This underscores the

importance, indeed the necessity of parole in the sentencing
apparatus of a State, and demonstrates that a prisoner will in
fact be paroled upon an adequate showing under the criteria
that the Board considers»
The notion that the Board has unlimited discretion
and could not? for instance, parole any prisoner, just does not
comport with the reality of the system»

QUESTION:

And this part of your argument, to the

extent we have allowed you to make it, is directed to the claim
that liberty is involved?
MR» RIVKINs

That's right»

That’s right? Your Honor,

it's directed —*
QUESTION: Well, let's assume that you have persuaded
us that liberty is involved, you've got tc do a little more
than that, don't you, under the language of the Fourteenth
Amendment?

There has to be a deprivation of liberty without due

process of law.
P4R» RIVKINs

Well, we think that the notion of

deprivation in this instance is met, both under the cases of

18
this Court and the realities of the system.
Under the cases of this Court, the notion that a
person must ba vested and therefore deprived of a right has not
found total voice.

Only last terra, in the: Hampton case,

Hampton vs. How Sun Wong, the alien Civil Service case, the
Court clothed individuals who were seeking

federal jobs with the

mantle of due process protection.
Similarly, in Uiliner vs. Board of Bar Examiners, and
Schware vs. Board of Bar Examiners, and Goldsmith vs. Board of
Tax Appeals, the Court did not make the distinction between an
individual who has and possesses a benefit and one who is only
applying.
And, in fact, in the amicus brief filed by the
Solicitor General, in his footnote 23, he seems to concede
that an applicant for benefits — and he mentions unemployment
compensation benefits ~~ that an applicant, for those benefits
will in fact be

clothed with due process protection.

Under the realities of the system, if an individual
is not paroled, based on, perhaps, erronee us information in the
file, or illegitimate criteria, as is contemplated under the
sentencing apparatus and by the sentencing judge-, ev®ry day
that that person stays in parol© he or she is being deprived
of ah interest in liberty.
And as the —

QUESTION *

You. say illegitimate criteria, isn’t —

19
under Kentucky law the decision of tine Board is final?
MR. RIVKIN: There is review available in the Kentucky
courts.

There have been a couple of decisions in the Sixties

by the high court in Kentucky* indicating that -fee court would
review the parole decision on an abuse of discretion standard.
They have never reviewed one successfully on behalf of a
prisoner., but my understanding of those esses is that
if* for instance* an individual were not paroled and could show
that it was done on a racially illegitimate basis* the Kentucky
court, would review.
Otherwise* the discretion is rather broad* though.
QUESTION;

To that extent* 'then* the State has set

up some system within its own jurisdiction for correcting
illegitimate —» what you call the use of illegitimate criteria?
MR. RIVKIN; The Court has indicated on one occasion
that it would review for abuse of discretion.

However* I

should -— as I noted* it has never successfully reviewed one*
first of all.

Secondly* I think it shows that the court

recognizes that there is a palpable interest here* by •»- the
very fact of judicial review indicates that there is something
here* not the ephemeral kind of interest that 'the State suggests*
but. something quite important and to b® protected.
QUESTION;

Did 'tii® state court put it on a Federal

constitutional ground?
MR. RIVKIN;

No* no

It was solely on — it's

20

sounded in administrative law in the State of Kentucky»
QUESTION:

A State lav,» question, then?

MRo RIVKIN:

Yes*

Yes,

There is only one decision

•that I could find like that? and in that decision, of courset
the court did talk about the parole as grc.ee e it was a pre~
Morrissey decision, and that was the only decision I have been
able to find on that point.
But I think the existence of review is a recognition
by the State courts of Kentucky -that parole is a substantial
interest.

That is, —QUESTION:

Where you say parole as grace, and then

you speak about; it as a pre™Morrissey decision, certainly
Morrissey didn't hold that parole was not a matter of grace,
did it?
MR, RIVKIN;

No,

Morrissey rejected the characteriza­

tion of parole as grace,
QUESTION;

I wouldn't have thought so,

I thought the

idea was that if you're once granted parole, and you ©re in
fact free from supervision, then if that’s to b© revoked, you
are entitled to a hearing,
MR, RIVKIN;
Morrissey.

That's right.

That was the holding of

I think —
QUESTION;

Well, that simile doesn’t hold that

parole -** the granting or denial of parole is not a matter of
grace.

21

MR. RIVKIII:

It's a natter of discretion, I -think

more properly characterises it.

The notion of grace, I think,

goes into the notion of parole as a privilege which the court
rejectedv in Morrissey,
The characterisation of the process as a privilege,
QUESTIONS

Well now, why do you say the court

rejected that in Morrissey?
MR. RIVKXNs I believe it explicitly said that ”we
reject the characterization of parol® as either a right or a
privilege, and we will look on it. as liberty that is valuable
to be protected under the Fourteenth Amendment.”
QUESTION:
MR, RIVKINs

Well, that's parole once granted.
That is ~

QUESTIONs

That's a revocation of parole.

QUESTIONs

No, but •—

MR, RIVKIN:
QUESTION:

Right.

That is —

— Morrissey was talking about a revocation

of an existing liberty status.

You're now asking to push that

further and say that before the state has ever granted that
liberty, you nonetheless have a liberty interest.
MR. RIVKINs

That's right, and I think Your Honor's

question fits in directly with Mr. Justice Stewart’s question
concerning whether an applicant for a benefit, as opposed to one
who retains a benefit, is entitled to due process protection.
And I believe, under the cases of this Court, as well as under

22

the notion til at an individual who is not paroled could
conceivably be — characterised as being deprived of his or her
liberty# if parole is not granted as contemplated under the
system.

That# for -those reasons# we believe that the applica­

tion of parole

falls under due process protection.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rivkin# your brief# I think# includes

•the statistics on the percentage of applications for parole
that are actually granted in Kentucky?
MR. RIVKIRs

That's right.

There are 60 percent of

the individuals who are in prison are relased on parole# and.
of those 60 percent, 60 percent are paroled the first time
they appear before the Board.

And those are statistics from

'72 fco '74# approximately.
QUESTION:

Thank you# that's what I wanted.

MR. RIVKXN: With parole viewed j.n the context above#
the nature of the interest at stake becomes apparent.

It is

not an ephemeral# unilateral interest or desire# but# rather#
a claim to freedom legitimised by the Legislature# by the
sentencing apparatus# by prison administrators# and by the
Parole Board itself.
To characterize parole as nothing more than a mere
hop© or anticipation misconceives the dynamics of the system
and the understandings that shape it.
The Court has recognized the palpability of a
prisoner's interest in Morrissey vs. Brewer.

I think that it's

23
interesting to note that in Morrissey vs, Brewer the decisionmaking process that goes on in revocation is very similar to#
if not exactly similar to# the decision-tasking process that
goes on in parol© and release»
First# as the Court's opinion noted# the Board
ascertains certain facts about the individual»
QUESTION s

Which hearing are you talking about?

The hearing on the ground# at the scene# cr the hearing back
at the institution?
MR, RIVKIN: The hearing back at the institution# the
second hearing,
QUESTION.»
MR, RIVKIN;

Well# —
The Board first must ascertain certain

facts# just as it does in parole release.
Second# and as the Court noted# the more complex
decision and the discretionary decision, is the decision as to
whether those facts justify# in that instance# returning the
individual to prison? in our instance# whether the person
should be released on the street.
And it's that discretionary decision and the
discretionary decision-making that adheres in both of those
processes that are the same,
QUESTION;

But by the time he has that hearing# at the

time he has the second hearing back at the institution and
under Morrissey# he still is in a conditional liberty, stag©#

24

ia h® not?

His pa.ro!© has not yet been revoked.
MR. RIVKINs

The prisoner, 1 believe, normally would

be incarcerated during that period.
QUESTIONs
.

MR. RIVKIN:
QUESTIONs

Ye3, but it has not been revoked.
That’s right.
He is incarcerated in the same sense a

person is incarcerated when he is arrested, before he is
charged,
MR, 'RIVKIN:

That’s right.

It has not formally been

revoked until the Board does so at the second final hearing.
That’s not. this case, of course.
Following Morrissey, a number of the — a majority of
the Courts of Appeals have uphold the position that we urge

today, cognizant of the evoling approach to due process
contained in some of the more recent decisions of this Court,
including Meachum, Your Honor.
Under this approach, if a person is able to assert a
legitimate claim of entitlement to a government benefit, due
process ensues.
In parole, such a legitimate claim of entitlement is
a product of -the practices and understandings that have grown
out of the system of rules that govern the parole system.
Very much like in Perry vs. Sindemann, where there was a de
facto system of teacher tenure, an unwritten common law of
parol© also exists

25
This unwritten common law generates a substantial
claim that if a prisoner meets certain criteria or conditions,
parole will be granted»
QUESTION; Well, didn't Meachum reject the idea that
•there could ba any claim for a hearing in connection with, a
transfer, ether than on a statutory basis?
MR. RIVKIN;

I think the difference between Meachum

and this case is two or threefold.
First of all, in Meachum the State had not created any
sort of apparatus or system or statute governing classifications
in prison, whereas in the parole situation# the STate has
created the parole apparatus as an integral part of the
sentencing apparatus.
QUESTION; But it hasn't said you. will be paroled if
such and such a condition is mat, has it?
MR. RIVKIN;

No# the State hasn't said that, but# in

fact# that's what happens»
QUESTION: Well# but then that's a non-statufcory thing.
MR. RIVKINs
QUESTION;

It's a practice.
Yes# but didn't Meachum reject the notion

that a practice» even if it could be shown# was the equivalent
of a statu torn#- entitlement?
*

MR. RIVKINs

I don't think so# Your Honor.

I think

the distinction is between the intention of the State in
creating a system of classification

and the discretion vested#

26
which is vastly different in the classification situation where
the State has not spoken nor has the prison administrator
spoken^ whereas, here, not only the Legislature has spoken, not
only the sentencing judgsis intended, but the Board itself
has promulgated certain criteria.
Th® measure of discretion here, I believe, is much
more bounded»
Secondly, I believe also that, the nature of the
interest involved in Me act, urn is not the kind of clasic funda­
mental bedrock interest in freedom that parole involves.

The

notion of intrastate transfer, I believe, is of a different
order, and should be treated so by the Court.
Thirdly, Meachum also involved considerations of
internal prison security, which are not at; all in the picture
in this case,
I would like to reserve —
QUESTIOH:

Even though there is not an explicit

statutory provision of the kind described in my brother
Rehnquis t's question, there is a kind of a common law entitle-*
ment similar to — or practical, a practical entitlement
similar to that discussed in Perry v, Sindermann, and in the
Rote case.
MR. RIVKIN:

Exactly, Your Honor, a claim of entitle­

ment exactly similar.
I’d like to reserve the remainder of my time for

27
rebuttal, please.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Rivkin.

Mr. Kxmberlin.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK B. KIMBERLIN, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court

pleases
The respondents would first address themselves to the
theshold issue here, which we believe is one of jurisdiction.
As the Court is aware, the petitioner was released on
parole.

We believe that this fact has essentially mooted the

case, and therefore this Court no longer has jurisdiction under
Article

3,

since

there is no

longer an active case of

controversy«
We believe that the fact -that he has been paroled
eliminated any person stake in the outcome which he

may have

had in this case.
Furthermore, we do not believe that the fact that
when the complaint was filed in this action it had allegations
pertaining to a class action, or requesting a class action
under Rule 23.
The fact of the matter is the case was not certified
as a class action, has never been certified as a class action,
and of course there has been no definition of a class in this
case

23

QUESTION:

How do you mean —* first of all* of course,

the district judge. Judge Mac Swinford — the late Mac Swinford
dismissed this without any opportunity to —
ME. KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

— or occasion to certify it as a class.

Although it was requested in the complaint., wasn't it?
MR. KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, that's true.

Than how do you explain the Court of

Appeals reference to this case as a class action, in the fourth
line of their opinion of their short order?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Well,

we do not believe that the

reference to it as a class action, in effect;, establishes that
it is a class action, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Not in the facts.

no explanation for that.

You don't —■> -there's

It wasn’t conceded to be a class

action, then?
MR. KIMBERLIN;

That's correct. Your Honor.

That's

correct.
QUESTION:

It was or was not?

MR. KIMBERLIN;

It was not conceded to be a class

action at any time, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

All right.

MR. KIMBERLIN: Furthermore, we to not believe that
-this particular -QUESTION:

Mr. KirobGrXin, or General Kimberlin,

29

before you go on, I take it the petitioner is still in custody
in a legal sense, in that h© is still under — he is on parole
now?
MR. KXMBERL IN;
QUESTION:

He is on parole now.

And does that mean he's subject to certain

restrictions on his conduct?
MR* KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, he is, Your Honor*

Under the Kentucky procedure, may he apply

Sr a change in the present restrictions, is there a procedure
for a person on parole, seeking to modify the restrictions;
is there?
MR* KIMBERLIN:

Yes, that is possible, Your Honor.

H© may -«*
QUESTION: Would that b® in the nature of a parole
release hearing if he made such an application?
MR* KIMBERLIN;

No, because —~ well, in the parole

release hearing, yes, that would be somewhat similar to that,
but not a parol© consideration hearing.
A parol® consideration would determine the initial
issue, whether to actually grant a parol® as opposed to any
modification of a parole one© it is in fact granted.
QUESTION: Well, if he asked for a modification, would
h© be entitled to any particular kind of procedure that would
b© followed in such a request?
MR. KIMBERLIN: Well, Your Honor, I do not know

30

exactly what the procedure would be, or what he would h®
entitled to in that type of hearing in which he would ask for
a modification# 1 do not know»
QUESTION:

I see.

MR« KIMBERLIN: We do not think that this case falls
within the very narrow doctrine of the case of a reoccurring
nature, yet evading review, because it appears to b© that this
particular doctrine only applies to cases where the same
parties one® again come into conflict at some subsequent
time.
Here w® believe, at best, only a very remote
possibility that the petitioner would, at some future point in
time, violate his parol®, which is what he would have to do to
be —*
QUESTION:

What about the petitioner's figures that

one-third of them do?
MR. KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Well, that figure of course would —

That's a pretty good percentage»

MR» KIMBERLIN:

But that only applies to those who

actually do, and I don’t believe this Court would have to
entertain the presumption that this particular individual would,
in order to —*
QUESTION:
he wouldn't.

But I thought you said you assumed that

I don't think you can assume either one, can you?

MR. KIMBERLINs Well, I think there would foe a presump-»

31
tion that an individual who has bean granted a parols would do
everything he could to sustain

that parole and continue it in

order -that h© may maintain the conditional liberty that that
parol® reflects.
QUESTION:

And you also recognise the fact that one-

third do not?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

On®*»third do not, one-third do violate

their paroles, yes, Your Honor? that's true.
Finally, we do not feel that there ar© any collateral
legal consequences, which the petitioner would show that would
indicate ‘that he would be adversely affected as a consequence
of his having been denied parol© at the first parole considera­
tion hearing, which would bring him within -Hi© purview of -that
particular rule.
And one other consideration so far as —
QUESTION: General, how do you —- I don't want you to

anything, but how could h@ evade all of this?

QUESTION:

32
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Yes, sir.

It would seem to me that 'the first thing to have done
is to try to attempt in every possible way to achieve certifica­
tion of the class at some point in time prior to the case
reaching this stage in the litigation. And secondly, -~

Well, what could he have done?

MR. KIMBERLIN;

suit, who were in the same situation he felt that he was in.
QUESTION; Well —
MR, KIMBERLIN;

In order to insure that -the case would

survive.
QUESTIONt

I thought I limited it to this case.

What could he have done in this case, where h@ had toe people,
he asked for a class action, the judge ignored it? what could
he have done?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

It's a possibility he could have

asked fox* a class action in the United States Sixth Circuit
Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Whether they would have certified the class —
And your authority for that is What?

MR. KIMBERLIN; Well, I would say it is only a
possibility, Your Honor.

I don51 know whether there is

authority that would sustain that proposition.

33

QUESTION:

Do you know of any case that **-

MR. KIMBERLIN:

No, Your Honor, I do not.

QUESTION: So I guess h®?s just stuck, if you -- all
the State has to do is, whan a man files a suit like this, is
to parole him, and that's the end?
MR. KIMBERLIN: Wall, Your Honor, he came up for a
second parol® consideration hearing as a matter of course, at
which time he was granted the parole which he desired.

And

that happened just prior to certification being' — to the
petition Spr

writ of certiorari being granted in this case.

QUESTION:

Then, truthfully, your only suggestion is

that he could have asked the Court of Appeals.
MR. KIMBERLIN: Well, there are any number of cases
that have been before'this Court, Your Honor, where individuals
--- whatever action was coming against them, they consider it
adversely, for which they were seeking protection or relief
no longer existed, or they themselves were no longer within the
purview,
QUESTION:

But this — the case is not against him,

■this is his case.
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Y©s, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, of course, petitioner has gotten
everything he wants- in the —» I mean, he’s gotten parole.
isn't entirely accurate to say that he’s stuck.

It

It's really

his lawyers or the class which he might have wanted to represent

34
that are stuck»
MR. KIMBERLIN: Well# that certainly is correct,
Justice Rehnquis t, because, after all, h@ has in fact been
granted the parols.

And that's why we feel he no longer has

any personal interest at stake.
QUESTIONs

Then the class action is just out?

MR. KIMBERLIN: We believe it is out.

We do not

believe it could survive.
QUESTION:

And you don't know of any way to keep it

in?
MR. KIMBX3RLIN:

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And you don't .know of any way that a group
of prisoners who want this done can get relief, other than all
of them joining as petitioners?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

If I wer© counsel, I would have seen

to it that very many of them would have joined this plaintiff,
to get —QUESTION;

So that is your answer.

Your answer is

the only way is to join in the lawsuit.
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Yes, Youx* Honor, that's true.

QUESTION: So that's the @nd of class action in this
field.
MR. KIMBERLIN:

So it has to **- end any class action?

QUESTION; As. a class action in prisoner cases, where
they can be paroled, there is no way fox* a class action.

35

if
MR. KIMBERLXN: Well,/the district judge would have
granted a class action, that wou33 have resolved the problem;
/

■there have been cases in other circuits where the judge has
granted class action status.
QUESTIONS

Where you have

a

district judge who

refuses -to certify a class, there's no possibility of a class
action?
MR. KIMBERLINj

I do not know that that's true, Your

Honor. That may bo, but I do not know.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kimberlin, just going back to Justice

Rehnquist’s question about the petitioner having been granted
f

all the relief he sought?

He did complain of the fact, he did

not get a hearing, an adequate hearing the first time he came
up for parol©, did h© not?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Yes, Your Honor, that's true.

QUESTION; hud if he should prevail in the litigation,
is it completely inconceivable that -there night be soma remedy
for the failure to grant the hearing, when he says he was
constitutionally entitled to a hearing?

Such as damages or a

statement of the reasons why he was denied the first time.
*

MR. KIMBERLIN;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

Yes.

Is that inconceivable?

MR, KIMBERLIN:

Yes, Your Honor, -that is true, that

is a possibility.
QUESTION: Then how can the case be moot?

MR. KIMBEELIN:
QUESTIONS

Maybe you have me there.

I'm -*-

I think X do.

[Laughter. 3
MR. KXMBERLIN:

Okay.

If they had not granted him a parole, then he could
possibly have sought relief in State courts, but he was granted
a parole«
QUESTION: But he*s seeking relief in a. federal court
now for that very reason, isn't he?
MR. KJKBERLIN% Well, for the same reasons -though, but
he did have — he has been extended relief.

We don't believe —

that he has been extended a parole, that he's entitled to any
relief new, because we don't feel he has eny personal interest,
at stake.
QUESTION: But h® did not get parole th© first time he
asked for it.
MR. KXMBERLIN:

No, he did not, Your Honor, that's

true.
QUESTION:

He served some time in jail as a result

of that.
MR. KXMBERLINs

Yes.

But that would lead us, then,

to the very basic nature of the case itself in parole
consideration, which I think I shall now address myself to,
as to *"~
QUESTION;

Before you do that

37
MR, KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor,

— any idea that there is some retroactive

possible kind of relief presupposes the answer to the question
presented by the entire case, does it not?
MR. KIMBERLIN:
I perhaps now

Yes, Your Honor, this is why X think

should address myself to the very essence of the

case on 'the merits.
QUESTION; Did the complaint ask for damages?
MR, KIMBERLIN;

No, Your Honor, it did not ask for

damages? and, in fact, I do not believe by a perusal of the
complaint would ©van reveal that the petitioner himself ever
alleged that h© was entitled to be parolee at that

first

hearing,
QUESTION:

The last prayer for relief is that the

plaintiffs fo© awarded any and all other relief to which they
or the members of their class may appear to be entitled.
Under that prayer a judge would have -the power to grant broader
relief, would he not?
MR. KIMBERLIN: That would be a possibility, al-though
he did not specifically request it.
QUESTION:

when we talk about mootness, we're

talking about the power of the district court, not the form
of the pleading, ar© we not?
MR. KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And is it your* understanding that th©

38

Court could award damages without a specific prayer for damages?
MR» KIMBERLIN:

No, Your Honor., I believe he would

have to specifically request damages»

It is a possibility,

however»
QUESTIONS That has always been iry thought? yes»
MR, KIMBERLIN; We would now turn to the primary issue
on the merits, which is whether the due process clause does in
fact attach to parole consideration hearings in Kentucky»
And it is the belief of the respondente that it does
not.

The whole predicate upon which constitutional application,

in so far as the due process clause is concerned, in the past,
has been that a liberty interest or property interest is at
s take.
Here we do not feel -that -there is either a liberty or
a property interest at stake.
The thrust of the petitioner's argument is that he
does in fact have an interest in liberty. We believe that that
interest in liberty has bean effectively extinguished as a
consequence of his convictions in the State trial courts in
Kentucky, for robbery and armed robbery,

for which he received

ten and twelve-year sentences to be served concurrently.
We believe that, as a consequence of tills conviction,
he has been — his liberty interest no longer exists within the
sense of what we're talking about here within -the context of
this case„

39

Obviously a person — the fact that a person has been
convicted as a felon and sent to jail does not mean he loses
/

all his constitutional rights, and we certainly are not saying
that.
We are saying that in so far as the context of parole
consideration is concerned, his confictior does extinguish his
liberty interest.
Furthermore, we do not feel he has any property
interest at stake.

An examination of the relevant statutes and

regulations in Kentucky will reveal that there is no entitle­
ment, given to the petitioner in so far as parole is concerned.
QUESTION; General Kixnberlin, let me put a hypothetical
case to you.
Supposing the State of Kentucky had a system of
indeterminate sentences, which provided that, say, the sentence
would be one to -three years, that after the prisoner had served
the first year there would be a hearing before the judge, at
which time the judge would decide whether or not any additional
time should be served, and the judge would have absolute and
total discretion, either to release the man at that time, or
)

to say he should serve another year or two.
Would the due process clause entitle the prisoner to
a fair hearing at that time?
MR. KIMBERLIN;

Well now, we*re dealing with a judge

type situation, and, in the State sense —

40
QUESTION; Well, as soon as you answer that? I'm going
to ask if the case would be any different if the power were
given to a parole board instead of a judge.
MR. KIMBERLIN;

Yes? Your Honor.

I think it would be different then from the situation
we have here? in that the sentencing process has ended? one©
and for all? when the person has left the State trial court
level.

Sentencing then ends.
QUESTION;

Well? their argument? of course? is that

as a practical matter the sentencing process really hasn't
ended? and that's why I am trying to put the hypothetical case
inhere the statute wade it perfectly clear that the decision on
how long 'the man would be incarcerated would be made by a judge
after a third of the statutory period had already been served?
and the judge would then have absolute discretion? either to
prolong the period of incarceration or to :release the man.
How would that be different from the situation we
have?
MR. KIMBERLIN: Well? perhaps it :Ls not different from
the situation we have here.
QUESTION;

Well? then? if it’s not different? would

the due process clause apply to such a hearing?
I think that may be the issue here.
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Well? I think perhaps it would not

apply in that kind of situation coming before a judge? if.he has

41
complete discretion upon a statutory entitlement that, a person
be considered after service of a certain amount of time of his
sentence.
QUESTION; So tii© key to your position really is
the totality of the discretion vested in the Parole Board or
the sentencing judge, is that it?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

I think the key to our position here

is what is his interest here, is it an identifiable interest
that can be clothed in the protections of the due process
clause?

Is it one of liberty or is it one of property?

And

we don't think it's either one.
Counsel, Mr. Rivkim indicated just previously that his
case doesn't depend on the right to parol®.
QUESTION;

Just a minute.

Well, that —

Now, I take it his position

is tliat it's a liberty interest because the question to be
decided in;

How long shall a man stay in jail?

MR. KIMBERLIN; Well, that’s an expectation in so far
as the petitioner himself is concerned.

He hopes to be released.

He has a valid sentence against him, that's been rendered against
him, —
QUESTIONS

And h© hopes to be one of the 60 percent

instead of one of the 40 percent?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Why — I don't knew exactly what the

statistics would mean, because in statistics we're looking at
an end result? and in order to build up those statistics to

42

begin with, tbs Parole Board had to consider each case on a
case-to-case basis, and the parole consideration itself reflects
a very individualistic

treatment of each prisoner.

The Parole Board has an identity of interest with the
prisoner.

If he can possibly be paroled, they will want him to

be paroled, if it's in the best interest cf the individual and
of society.
And we feel that there must be a predicate for due
process applications.

In fie a chum vs. Fane, there was no

predicate for a due process application.

Thera has to be a

liberty or property interest.
And, furthermore, we -think it net only has to be a
liberty or property interest, but it has to be a liberty or
property interest which is presently being enjoyed by -the person
»>

who seeks protection or to which he is presently entitled to.
In

the Morrissey case, --

QUESTION:

He has to be deprived of it.

MR. KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION;

I mean, --

Exactly, he has to be deprived of it.

— in order to trigger the due process

clause.
MR. KXMBERLIN:

In the Johnson case, out of the Second

Circuit Court of Appeals — United Statas_
New York Parole Board.

Johnson vs.

In that case the Second Circuit equated

the expectation of parole with a person's status who has already
been granted parole, and they say -chat ~~ they referred in there

43
to a footnote# footnote 8 in the Morrissey case# referring to
Bey vs , Connecticut» where this Court# Mr» Chief Justice
Burger# who wrote the Morrissey opir»ie,n# used that footnote,
And that .footnote is something to the effect that it is not
sophistic to distinguish between mere anticipation or hope of
being granted parole# as opposed to a person who has already
been granted parole»
And this footnote was used in in 'that part of the
Morrissey decision which dealt with the neture of the interest
that was involved# not the sura weight.

Yet the Johnson case#

in the Second Circuit# distinguished that footnote by saying
•that it makes no difference whether he’s presently enjoined
and presently entitled to it# because all that footnote means
is-that the Supreme Court indicated that more constitutional
protections could be accorded to somebody

who is already on

parole and that right nay be taken away# as opposed to --QUESTIONS

Mr, Kiraberlin, --

MR, KIMM2RLIN;
QUESTIONS

Yes# Your Honor?

supervision", end quote# in Kentucky?
MR, KIMRERLINs

I’m not exactly sure what that would

mean# other than the fact of talking to other respondents
QUESTIONS

Well# don’t we have to know?

I mean# does he have to go to the prison every day?
MR, KIMBERLXN 2

Well# —

44
QUESTION:

Or would he spend nights there, or what

is close supervision?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

I don't know that it's necessary to

know what — exactly what close supervision would be, because
this is the standard we have for someone who is on parole.
QUESTION:

You say that this case is moot because the

man is out on parole under, quote, "close supervision", end
quota? and you tell me that I don’t need to know? what close
supervision is?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Well, we have talked to our clients

about close supervision, about the aspects of this case in the
individual characteristics of Scott? and close supervision would
be checking in with parole officers, being limited in where he
could go, and that sort of thing.

But, no, we do not know.

Thera has never been an opportunity by the respondents to set
forth this specific factual information which would be
pertinent to this case.
QUESTION:

Has the petitioner put anything in the

record in this case as to the nature of
MR. KIMBERLIN:
QUESTION:
MR. KIMBERLIN;

Of close supervision, Your Honor?
close supervision?
No, I do not believe so.

I don’t

think so.
QUESTION: Well, whose job is it on this mootness
point?

It’s your job, isn't it?

45
MR* KIMBERLIN:

Well, I believe it's not my job.

I believe -~
QUESTION:

Well, if he has to report to the prison

three days a week and spends two days in the prison, would you
say the case was moot?
MR* KIMBERLIN:

Yes, Your Honor. Because those kind

of considerations deal specifically with Ihe possibility —
QUESTION:

Well, if he was relecised on parole one

hour a week, would you say this case was moot?
MR* KIMBERLIN:

I do not think that those considsra~

tions would be relevant to the consideration of mootness, to
the determination of mootness, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, what is it? What, makes it moot?

It's

that he is out of prison.,
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, I’m saying if he’s not really out, it
wouldn’t be moot, would it?
MR. KIMBERLIN:

If he were actually back in the

prison again?
QUESTION:

If he wasn’t actually out.

Which is just

as clear to m© as clos© supervision would be.
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Anyone who is on parole, there is

always some limitation as to — it is a conditional liberty,
which was recognised in the Morrissey case..

Yes, Your Honor.

Finally, we would say that the Court, we feel, should

46
give consideration to whether the person is actually enjoying
such an interest or is entitled to such an interest»
An expectation, we feel, is not sufficient to con­
stitute — to extend constitutional due process protection.
And that’s all we believe that the petitioner has here.
QUESTION: General Kimberiin, on that very point,
what do you say about the Goldsmith v. Board of Tax Appeals?
Do you remember the case involving the accountant who wanted to
get admitted to -the —
MR. KIMBERLIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

In so far as that case is concerned, and perhaps the
bar cases, there was an entitlement, a statutory formal policy
set forth in which it established a plan, saying someone —
QUESTION: Well, let me just interrupt you.

13

it a

statutory matter, or was it a policy by practice over and over
that they would admit these people?
MR. KIMBERLIN: Well, I think it. was a rule of court
in the tax case, because it would be the Court of Tax Appeals
that would be in charge of permitting people to come before it.
QUESTION: Did not the rule in the tax case specifically
provide that th© Board had absolute discretion to turn the man
down?
MR. KIMBERLIN: Well, it may have been, Your Honor, but
— now, if someone in that Goldberg [sic]

case, if an

individual fell within the class that would be entitled to

4?
become a member of the Tax Court Bar. then he could not be
denied relief without due process being accorded# I beliefs.
Now# th© thing here is# the State of Kentucky permits
someone — it establishes a class of persons who may be
considered for parole# it does not establish# by policy or
statute or regulation# a class which entitles someone to parole*
And I believe there’s a

great difference in that*

If we had a statute which said that a person# if he
met A# B# C# D and E#is entitled to parols# then we could not
deny him a parole one© he establishes that he meets A# B# C#
D# and E„
QUESTIONS Well# did you read the Goldsmith case as
indicating that any lawyer and any accountant was entitled to
be admitted to practice?
MR. KXMBERLINs

No# Your Honor*

I believe that if an

attorney or an accountant, in that particular case fell within
the.class# that h© would be entitled to b@ admitted# that he
could not subsequently be denied upon a discretionary basis#
without a due process hearing*
Here 'there is no class in which this petitioner or
any other prisoner in Kentucky, would fall within which would
entitle him to be paroled,
If there were# that would establish an entitlement
to a liberty interest; and her© there is no such entitlement to
a liberty interest or a property interest# and there’s obviously

48
nothing that he's

presenting enjoying within the property or

liberty aspecto
We would now turn to — assuming, arguendo, that ‘the
due process does in. fact apply to this case

how much process

is due ®
We would first suggest the possibility of a remand to
■the lower courts to establish an evidentiary basis in order to
determine exactly what the policies and practices of the Parole
Board are, as opposed to how they have been pleaded in this
particular case.
In the ©vent this Court does not. deem a remand
necessary, we would suggest that 'the present policies and
practices, as we have — are able to determine them now, are
sufficient to meet with minimal due process standardsB
After all, the entire Parole Board meets to consider
a parolee at a parole consideration hearing»

If they cannot,

all meet, of course a quorum will meet to consider the
individual»
He has the right to be present, and he has the right
to be heard.

The Parole Board will consider, under present

regulations, some 14 specific factors, and there is one 15th
factor which, in effect, permits the Parole Board to consider
any other possibility.
We feel that in light of all this, the risk of any
possible error is, at best, minimal, and the chance of

49
arbitrariness minimal.

And we feel that these minimal due

process protections are sufficient to accord no change in the
procedures in Kentucky at this time.
Specifically, as to some of the requests that he has
made for relief, in so far as an attorney is concerned, we feel
that this —> the introduction of counsel at a parole considers"
tion hearing, and there are several hundreds of these held every
year by th© Parole Board, would turn the hearing into a
truncated trial-type procedure and change the very nature and
form of tlie consideration in the role of the Board into almost
an adversarial type process.

And we do not feel that that is

at all necessary.
And there has only been one other case in which we
feel, perhaps in Goldberg vsa Kelly, where 'die right to counsel
has been extended in the whole

in the entire -procedure,

administrative procedure, clothed in a trial-type proceeding.
We do not feel that there is any necessity for a
written list of reasons.

It is the actual practice in most

cases now for the Parole Board to extend to th© person being
considered an oral reason why he is being denied parol©.

And

we feel that this is sufficient.
And that would effectively eliminate that argument,
w@ feel, in so far as the due process question is concerned.
On the meaningful hearing and opportunity to rebut
adverse facts, we feel h© has these by his right to be present.

at; the hearing and to address the Board„
And, from talking with the respondents, it is their
position that any time that they feel there is some problem in
the record, in so far as possibly granting the particular
parson a parole, they will discuss it with him at the hearing»
And we feel that this is a sufficiently meaningful hearing,
in so far as minimal due process is concerned.
QUESTION:

Mr» Attorney General, suppose no hearing

were accorded a prison inmate at all, and the Board denied
parole without any hearing. What recourse, if any, would the
prisoner have?
MR. KIMBERLIN: Well, he has an entitlement.

If, under

our rules and regulations and statutes, ha were never accorded
a hearing, he would be entitled, I believe, to pursue relief
in the State Circuit Courts, for the reason that he has, under
our statutes and regulations, an entitlement to be considered
on the basis of whatever his sentence may be after a certain
service of -that sentence, to be considered for parole.
And if 'that would not be extended to him, that
entitlement, we feel, could be protected by going into the
State Circuit Courts in order to seek relief and to have -so the Circuit Court could order the Kentucky Parole Board to
consider him for parole if, in fact, no hearing was ever ■ held
at all.
QUESTION:

In the nature of mandamus

51
MR. KXJiBERLINs Essentially that, yes, Your KOnor,
that would be true.
In conclusion, w® would submit that the due process
clause does not attach to parole consideration hearings in
Kentucky, and -an at, if it does, the current procedures do
comport properly with the minimal aspects of -the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEfc: Thank you, Mr, Kimberlin,
Do you have anything further, Mr, Rivkin?
You have two minutes,
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEAN HILL RIVKIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RIVKINs

Just a few points, Your Honor,

I believe that General Kiraberiir stated our case
when h® noted, in response to questions about Goldsmith, that
an individual — or if an individual becomes a member of the
class, then h© or she is entitled to due process protection,
*

I think that is precisely the nature of the process of parole
release.
The Board, exercising discretion, uses the criteria
that, it has developed over the years.

It reviews the files.

As the statistics note, a large number of individuals meet
•those criteria and, in fact, are paroled.
This is much closer to 'the sentencing analogy that

52
Mr6 Justice Stevens noted, and to the type of discretion that
was exercised in Morrissey vs. Brewer, and the type of process
that existed in Morrissey vs. Brewer than, for instance, in
Meachum vs » Fano.
Parole release is part of this continuum in the
criminal justice process, involving the important interest of
release on parole, as opposed to whatever interest an individual
would have, which is not constitutionally protected under
Meaehum vs. Fano.
Finally, I think that a reading of deprivation under
the due process clause to excluse this case would be an overly
formalistic reading, under this Court’s esses in Goldsmith and
Schwar© and Wiliner and. last term, in Hampton.

And, for

these reasons, w® believe that the judgment of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit should be reversed, and
the case remanded for an evidentiary hearing and further
proceedings D
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, gentlemen.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10;59 o’clock, a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
