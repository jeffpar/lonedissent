MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 76-143, Splawn against California.
Mr. Wells.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR WELLS , JR.,.ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WELLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here because the Petitioner has been
convicted of violation of California obscenity law.

The facts

are quite simple.
In 1969? the Petitioner ran a store in Northern
California from which he sold books and films with sexual
content.

Prior to the events that occurred which led to the

conviction, police had become aware of the store and purchased
material for sale regularly in the store, but apparently none
of this material was the type that they felt was suitable for
prosecution.

Bo, they sent in someone who was a part-time

policeman and otherwise a carpetlayer who was seeking, in his
words,

"hard-core material," by which -QUESTION:

Is there any dispute or issue remaining

about whether this is obscenity in this case?

I thought that

was out of the case.
MR. WELLS:

No, I don't think the issue whether it's

obscenity is out of the case.

I didn't raise the issue of

4
whether the material was obscene or not because, as I understand
Miller,the only question as to the content of the material is
whether or not it is the type that could be found by a properly
instructed jury to be obscene.
The two films here graphically display ultimate sexual
acts,: They are not simulated and, therefore, they are the type
that could be found obscene if the jury were properly instructed.
In this case, we claim that evidence was improperly
introduced and that the jury was not properly instructed and
that's why there was a conviction,.

But it is because of the

holding in Miller that we have not raised at this point a claim
as to the content of the material,
I might also point out that the term, "hard-core,"
as used in this case by the participants was not a concession
that the material was obscene but only that the material
graphically displayed ultimate sex acts.

In other words, in

1969 and 1970, the state-of-the-art was,what was publicly for
sale, was simulated,

That is borne out by the record and I

would refer you to pages 515 through 517* 574, 619, 683 and 68^
and 762, in which all of the people who had anything to do with
the store and Mr, Drivon, the policeman, indicated that they
were talking about material which actually showed sex acts,
rather than which shoi\>ed simulated sexual acts.
In any event, Drivon, in order to accomplish the task
of acquiring some hard-core material, some material which

5
graphically displayed sexual behavior, was required to make six
contacts with the store.

Only one of those contacts was with

the Petitioner, Mr. Splawn.

And I think it is significant that

at that contact the Petitioner told Mr. Drivon that he could go
to San Francisco and get these films himself if he wished and
Mr. Drivon begged off from that invitation.
Finally, then, after six contacts, Drivon purchased
two films for $70 for which Petitioner was convicted.

He had

been tried not only for the crime of displaying and distributing
obscene material, but also on the felony conspiracy charge with
his twin brother and the clerk, and there was an aquittal on the
felony charge.
After trial, certain instructions were given which
were based on Ginzburg v. United States and are commonly
referred to as instructions that are based on the pandering
doctrine.

And there were other instructions which I will

discuss the contents of more specifically later.
In any event, the case presents three issues.

The

first issue arises because the pandering law of California
which was incorporated into instructions was not in effect at
the time that the Petitioner sold films for which he was subs equ ent ly c onv ic t ed »
QUESTION:

I take it your argument about equal

protection is not before us?
.

MR. WELLS:

No.

You did not grant cert on that issue

6
and I did not brief that issue in the brief, and I do not intend
to address myself to that question.
You limited your grant of certiorari to the first
four questions.
Because the law was not in effect at the time, an
ex post facto issue was raised.

Similarly, the California

Supreme Court less than two years before the sale which is the
subject matter of this lawsuit had ruled that pandering was not
part of California law.

• - 1

■

Therefore, question arises under the Due Process
Clause and Boule v. Columbia as to whether there was a new and
novel and unfair application of state law to this defendant
such that he was denied due process.
The behavior engaged in by the Petitioner in this
case displays no more than a simple sale.

The Court of Appeals’

opinion which is here in question refers to no behavior by the
Petitioner except that of a simple sale.
Under the circumstances, a question is raised about
whether the pandering instructions, both based on the law and
as given by the court in this case, should have been given at
all because, in Petitioner's view, these instructions are lop­
sided.

They do not fairly represent the proposition they are

supposed to support.

Instead, they represent only a prosecution

view.
Third, on-the assumption that it was proper to give

7
instructions on the subject of the context and the behavior
rather than just on the subject matter of the material, the
question is presented as to whether these instructions are
proper,
I would like to discuss these matters in reverse
ord er.
I think Miller, if it teaches us one thing, says that
local juries and local jurisdictions are going to have a lot
more to say about what is and what is not obscene.
This Court sits not to find what is obscene, but just
as a check to determine what is not obscene,
I think if you are going to have rules which‘•say that
you are going to have a not completely defined local community
as a community by which to judge what is obscene, and if you are
going to have a rule that requires no evidence at all except the
material itself be introduced to support a conviction, then
what you have to insist on is a properly instructed jury.
I urge this Court to elaborate on and adopt its
recent remarks in Footnote 11 of Marx v. U»S. which is to the
effect that there is no substitute for a properly instructed
jury.
31 think this is especially important in a case like
this because what we are talking about is the content of books
and movies and other material which, by the way, is pure speech.
This is in a picketing case.

This is an O'Brien situation.

8
This isn't anything but pure speech.
And I think what we are talking about is questions of
aesthies, questions of taste and questions of social value.
And we are trying to convey to a group of laymen what it is
that they have to do to make a judgment which could rise.to the
level of a constitutional judgment.
Now, I think then what we need is as much clarity and
precision as we can get.

Otherwise we have no insurance that

the jury, located some place else and without the necessary
guidance of any evidence but the material itself and applying
a local community, is going to do what you nine people want it
to do, or what a larger group than that want it to do.
Therefore, I think it Is very important to stick to
what we have if that's what we have to live with.
Now, the worst, most glaring example of error, I
think, of the instructions, as given, is the instruction that
says that the jury is permitted to look to the sexually provoca­
tive aspects of the matter to determine if the material lacks
value, and that if they find the material is sexually provoca­
tive that fact alone is enough to find that the material lacks
value.
This, to me, is an extremely insidious instruction
for the following reason,

The core thing in the obscenity

field, the thing that has been with us since law is the notion
of prurience.

9
If there is any governmental interest at all in this
field, if there is any reason for the state to be In it at all,
it is only because this material, on some theory or supported
by some set of facts, is hamful, is unhealthy.
what prurience means.

And that's

Prurience indicates this obsessive

compulsion with the unhealthy aspects of sex.
Provocativeness is an entirely different thing.
Provocativeness has to do with arousal, being aroused, being
excited, being provoked, and that is not necessarily unhealthy.
Now, what happens is this:
can see, is a difficult concept.

Prurience, as far as I

It’s a difficult term because

you are dealing in health and lack of health and a. large com­
munity of people who you have to judge it by.

And I don't think

the layman, the common juror, is acquainted with the term
"prurient," uses it or thinks in terms of those notions.
On the other hand, provocativeness, especially
*

sexual provocativeness,is something that we all grow up with.
Chewing gum, cars, there is nothing that is not sold partially
on the basis of provocativeness and usually sexual provocative­
ness .

Cigarettes for years were sold with implied — .and still

are on billboards but not on television — implied sexual
a11ractlveness from .smoking
I, therefore, think that what happens if you permit
the type of instruction given here and what, indeed, probably
did happen here,

is that, the jury says to itself, "Well, we are

10

supposed to deal with this notion of prurience, but I am not
too sure ivhat it is,and under Miller, maybe, we don't have any
evidence regarding it, but the «judge said something about
provocativeness.
is provocative.

Maybe I'll look at It and see if I think it
If It is provocative, then I don't have to

worry about the rest.*'

And so they substitute provocativeness

or a judgment about whether the material is provocative for a
judgment about whether the material is prurient.
That is the worst possible thing that can be done in
this field for the reason that the only reason for having the
rules about obscenity, if there are any reasons, is that the
material is unhealthy.

And if the judgment is made on the

basis of provccativeness rather than prurience, then you are
not making the judgment on the basis that the^material is un­
healthy, but just that it excites or arouses somebody.
And the fact something arouses or excites somebody is
probably one of the reasons why It should h4ve First Amendment
protection, not one of the reasons that it shouldn't»
And, of course, the other thing about the term
"sexual provocativeness" is that It is vague, vague in both
the senses that it is not final enough that we can draw a line
so that we can protect protected speech and not protect not
protected speech, and vague in the sense that you, by using the
term, can't tell me what I am supposed to do, and so I don't
have any real notice about what I am supposed to do and a jury

11
has no real notice about what it is supposed to do.
The other fundamental error in the instructions in
this case was the instruction which permitted the jury to look
again at the material# after it had supposedly applied the three
tests which at that time were applicable, the Memoirs .test, and
judge it in terms of the intent of the creator.
Whatever may be the value of such a test, it has
never been applied by this Court in the case of a retail seller.
Hamling was a producer.

Ginzburg was a producer.

Redhoon, who

in 1940 was the person about whom Learned Hand wrote the
opinion which you said was a good opinion in Ginzburg was the
man who made and mailed out the fliers in that case, and it
has never been applied to a person.

In any event, the man

isn't on trial, that is to say, the publisher is not on trial.
So, what you do is you look again at the material anc
you say, "Well, what is the intent of the person who made this
material?"
Mow, that should never be the judgment about whether
the material is obscene or not because what we are trying to do
is get to an objective standard.

We are trying to apply a

standard which is a standard of lack of health, unhealthiness.
And the motives of the creator are not what we are talking
about when we are talking about prurience.

If you. want to get

the creator of the material, then you use the investigative
facilities to arrest him — and on this type of theory, I

12
suppose you would try him for something like attempt to make a
dirty book or attempt to make obscene books, then you are
talking solely about his motives.
Under this, you have a subjective standard instead of
an objective standard and, once again, it redefines any of the
tests laid down by this Court and because it is easier for the
jury to apply that kind of a test, "Just look, oh, oh, we know
what he was trying to do*'1

And they are going to substitute

that kind of test for the law.
Mow, the next point is the question about whether
these instructions should have been given at all.
To this extent, I think Ginzburg is a confusing case.
What happened in Ginzburg is that there was a holding back.
Context was important, but the context of that case was that a
publisher exploited his material.
The question is whether you are going to have a rule
which permits the context to be considered or not.

In this case,

what California did is, first of all, it passed a statute that
didn’t say consider the whole context.
is misusing the material.

It said see if the guy

And, I admit, that was part of

Ginzburg v.. United States, but that's only because of the
facts of Ginzburg which are entirely different from the facts
here, mainly because you have a publisher in control there and
you don't have one here.
Here, what you have is a retailer and if you don't

13

limit the rules, somehow, and let him know what he can do and
not do, there is no way he is going to have any idea.

And I

think it's really going to lead to a self-censorship thing.
Merely —
QUESTION:

Is there any evidence in the record here,

Mr. Wells, as to whether this retailer ran a totally, what you
might call, adult bookstore, or whether he had an adult section
and non-adult section?
MR, WELLS:

There is no direct evidence In the record

The fact of the matter is he did run an adult bookstore.

The

pictures that were introduced as a matter ~~ Exhibit 4 -- which
were introduced on a pandering theory show the inside of the
store and they show magazines displayed and their covers.
I would urge — I am reading over my brief.

I see

that while I complained a lot that the conviction was Improper,
I did not suggest what would be an appropriate rule.

And I

think the object ~~ the Court's opinion, if it reaches this
issue, should be to limit the application of this rule if you
are going to have it at all to a very finite, definite, set of
circumstances, because, otherwise, in a field where I feel that
you are at your limits of possible use of words to be able to
convey ideas, you just can’t go any further.
I would point out that Ginzburg permitted the use of
this doctrine as a rebuttal tool.

It was strictly a question,

in that case, or it could be read to be, of the integrity of th<

14
process.
Ginzburg had been out In Middlesex and Blue Ball,
Pennsylvania, going crazy with this material.
material itself.

He was exploiting it.

into court and said,

Okay.

It wasn't the
And then he ran

"Oh, this is really pure stuff."

Now, as a mere factual rebuttal to that, the Govern­
ment said,

"Now, -wait a minute.

You said one thing out there.,

just to show that you are not credible, that you are not to be
believed, a different thing should be permitted to be shown
here."
I would urge you to limit the application of the rule
to that.

If you are not going to do that, if you are going

to go further, then I would say that you should limit it to
behavior which is unambiguous exploitation, because vjhat you
have to do is draw the distinction between commercial exploita­
tion and commercial behavior.
If you don't permit some behavior in this field, ther
you are going to cut everything out.

People are not going to

do anything in this field.
Mow, the only good analogy I can think of, and it
isn't really right on point, is to refresh your recollection
about the clear and present danger test.

That is the other

test that !s used to determine if protected speech should not be
protected because of the context in which it is used,,
Here, if you have material which is borderline, or

15
material which is not, which the Government, apparently, doesn't
feel it can be made obscene without refei*ence to the context,
and therefore it is going to use the context, the question
should be whether the behavior of the defendant was such that
it is clear and immediate that there was exploitation of the
unhealthy aspects of the material, rather than support of the
material that has value.
Okay,
You've had these kinds of rules before and to go not
too far afield, that is to say, in the criminal law field,
I point out to you that you have a warrant requirement and
that you require warrants to go into premises unless you have
exceptions.

And the exceptions are only that wide.

The one I think of that's useful here is the exigent
circumstances.

In order to get around a warrant by saying —

a warrant requirement by saying exigent circumstances permitted
us not to get the warrant, the behavior lias to be clear and
unambiguous.
There are a host of Court of Appeals cases that so
hold.

In Hong Sun, for instance, as I recall it, it is a case

where the man knocking on the door, or the policeman knocking on
the door and footsteps are running away, and that is still held
to be ambiguous, and therefore not a sufficient exigent circum­
stance.
Here, you should require a specific unambiguous act

16
which you've had in the eases that have been before you.

You

have had specific advertising which have emphasized the pruriens,
salacious aspects of material.

So to formulate such a rule

doesn't require you to withdraw or cut back or overrule any
cases.
Lastly, I would address myself to the issue of — to
the ex post, facto issue.

I think the key here is the question

of what does this pandering rule do to a natural trial of an
obscenity case.

And I think it is rather clear that it funda­

mentally changes the focus and that it makes a whole different
ball game than you would have when you just looked at the four
corners of the material.
The Government and the Court of Appeals tend to treat
this as a rule'of evidence, and I think that's just putting a
label on something and I don't think it is doing — I don't
think it is solving the problem.
There are lots of different kinds of evidence rules.
There are evidence rules that shift the burden of proof, that
deal with the burden of who has to go forward and knock,that deal
with the quality of evidence.

Some kinds of judgments can be

made, you have to have percipient evidence,

Other kinds you

have to have — I mean hearsay is adequate.

There probably are

a couple where double hearsay would be adequate.
There are rules of evidence that govern who can give
evidence and who can't give evidence.

But a rule that actually

17

defines what is material in a given case is that kind of rule
of evidence that is a substantial contributor to the parameters
of a trial.
For instance, if you changed the rule of evidence to
penult the question — Well, if you use narcotics, that might
fee relevant in a custody case.

If you change the rules of

evidence in a breach of contract case to permit evidence that
someone used narcotics on the theory that people who use nar­
cotics are less likely to perform contracts, that would be a
change in a rule of evidence that would seem to be material
enough that you couldn't apply it retroactively.
Here, I think, there was a clear change which was a
big surprise because of People v. Noroff in which, by my view,
the California Supreme Court clearly said, "We are not going
to have a pandering law unless the legislature passes it.’'
I would like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal,
if there are no questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM D. STEIN, ESQ.,
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR. STEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I am William Stein, representing the people of the

18

State of California In this obscenity prosecution, an area in
the law which, I submit, we}ve all probably written and read
way too much,
I believe that Petitioner’s argument today is based
on an erroneous premise, and that is that he has been convicted,
somehow, of advertising or promoting the sale of obscene matter.
It is true that California recognizes an offense of
that nature, but Petitioner was not charged nor convicted of
that.

He was convicted, simply, of the act of selling obscene

material.
At trial, the prosecution introduced evidence of the
circumstances of the production and dissemination of these two
films as 'material in the question of whether they were obscene
under the then Roth-Memoirs definition of obscenity, a definition under which the prosecution and the juries of California
still labor.
Now, Petitioner has a clever way of phrasing this.
He uses the -- He refers to this evidence of dissemination and
production as evidence of pandering, and then argues that the
instructions relating it to the definition of obscenity resulted
in his conviction for pandering* a crime with which he claimed
he was not charged, coneededly.
I submit that we can establish that the jury was not
confused in this matter, very simply.
charged alone.,

The Petitioner was not

Petitioner had a twin brother Don.who was

19

charged with the same offense.

And, as a matter of fact, on

all of the occasions when Mr, Drivon went to the book store to
talk about purchasing these films, as Petitioner pointed out
a few minutes ago, he talked mainly with Don.
charged with selling obscene material,

And Don was

Don was acquitted.

The evidence that Petitioner refers to as pandering
was mainly the statements of Don,

If the jury was going to be

confused and somehow thought that this evidence made it a crime
to pander, they would have convicted Don along with Roy, But
the twin brother, Don, was acquitted.
Why?
judge told them.

Because the jury understood exactly what the
The evidence only went to the issue of social

value, one of the three definitional elements of obscenity in
California at that time.
Selling obscene material is a simple crime.

It has,

as I see It, only two elements: the knowing sale of obscene
matter.

All of this other evidence goes to the three defini­

tional requirements of obscenity.
So, we submit, the Petitioner was convicted solely of
the act of selling obscene films, and that by using this phrase
"pandering" as a verb he attempts to distract us from this very
simple fact.
I had believed that, after all these years, there i\ras
little confusion between the parties as to what the facts in the
case were.

I think there is general agreement, and I only had

20
one thing 'chat struck me during Petitioner's argument.

That's

when he said that the defendant told Mr. Drivon, the officer
who purchased the film* that if he really wanted these things
he could go to San Francisco and get them.
I refer to the transcript* at page — of trial* page
37* lines 24 through 26.
Question

to Mr. Driven.

Mr. Driven talking about

the conversations he had, states:
"He (referring to the twin brother* Don) did suggest
that if I was in a real hurry to obtain some films that he
could go to San Francisco to get them."
I submit the reference is not that he, Mr. Drivon*
could go to San Francisco., but that if he was in a real big
hurry* Don Splawn would be willing to satisfy him by going to
San Francisco* about thirty miles up the road* and get these
films and bring them right back.
It would have made no sense* of course, for
i

Mr. Drivon to go to San Francisco since the book store here
was in the suburban community of California, our bedroom com­
munity* San Mateo County.

And that's where the prosecution was

attempting to limit the distribution of this material.
Okay.
The brief also states that — and Petitioner makes
point of the fact that Mr. Drivon had to come back again and
again as though he was the moving force in this and was somehow

21
entrapping, if you will, Petitioner.
If you read the record, in every one of those
instances, every time he comes back there is more — the more
pandering is done by Petitioner or his brother and his employee.
I think, in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question,
I wanted to point out there was an additional exhibit here con­
sisting of forty-one photographs that were taken of the interior
of the bookstore,at the time the arrest was made, which
establishes the, sort of, the nature of the place where this
activity was taking place, where the statements as to the
films were being made which was evidence of the distribution -QUESTION:

Am I right In thinking that Redwood City

is the county seat of San Mateo County?
MR. STEIN:

That's correct.

Redwood City is the

c ounty seat.
Okay.
It is Important ~~ Two procedures happened during the
trial which, I think, are vary important to the outcome of the
case.
Before the trial was made — Before the trial was
held, Petitioner made the non-statutory motion, recognizing
California,under People v. Noroff, to have the case dismissed
on the grounds that, as a matter of law, these films were not
obscene.

That motion was denied.
The case went to trial,

At the close of the

22

prosecution ease* defendant made a motion, under our statutory
provision, for a directed verdict of acquittal on the specific
grounds -- and the reference to this is in the transcript at
page 495 — that there had been no evidence introduced that
these films lack social value.

That motion was also denied*

the reason being, of course, that the prosecution had intro­
duced evidence this Court had recognized in Ginzburg as probative
on the definitional elements of obscenity as they were laid down
in Roth-Memolrs.
Because evidence of production and dissemination is
relevant to this definition, the jury was instructed that in
determining t^hether the films were utterly without redeeming
social importance — and as a sidelight I would say most of
this evidence in all these instructions went to social impor­
tance, as opposed to prurient appeal.
Okay.

They could consider the circumstances of sale

and distribution, particularly whether such circumstances
indicated these films were commercially exploited by Petitioner
for the sake of their prurient appeal.

They were informed such

evidence was probative with respect to the nature of the films
and can justify the conclusion that they were utterly without
redeeming social value.
The weight of any of the evidence, of course, was left
to the jury, specifically instructed.
Now, the jury, with respect to social importance of

23

sexual provocativeness * a point Petitioner made during his oral
argument --the jury was further instructed that evidence of the
circumstances of production and dissemination were relevant for
determini whether social importance claimed for the film was in
the circumstances pretense or reality and if they concluded that
the purveyors' sole emphasis* sole emphasis was on the sexual
provocative aspect of these films* that fact would justify the
conclusion that the matter was utterly without redeeming social
importance.
Roy Splawn was not trying to sell lucky Strike
cigarettes or anything else by having a pinup girl.

He was

making — the purveyor was making sole emphasis on the sexual
aspect of these films.

ThatEs recognized as relevant to social

value and that's how the jury was instructed here.
QUESTION:

Mr. Stein* before you leave the instruc­

tions* do you submit the instruction was proper* as given?
MR. STEIN:
QUESTION:

I do* yes.
And the instruction* as I read it, says

that simply on the basis of emphasis* sole emphasis

— you

emphasize that word — of the sexually provocative aspect of
the publication* that fact — and I assume that means that
fact alone — could justify the conclusion that the matter is
utterly without redeeming social value.
That would mean even if he were selling Time Magazine

24

that would justify it.

Would you say that is a correct state­

ment of the law, or do I misread it?
MR. STEIN:

That's correct.

If they concluded that

his sole emphasis was on the sexually provocative aspect of
the film, it could justify the conclusion that it was utterly
without redeeming social value.

That was the way they were

Instructed, yes.
QUESTION:

Do you-'think that's a correct statement?

MR. STEIN.:

think it is in the sense that this

Court by rereading Roth-Memoirs -- but they had to find lack
of social importance beyond a reasonable doubt.

And I think

taken all together in its entire scope,the instructions read
together, I don't think they were allowed, that this allowed
them to just look to nothing else and find lack of social value.

But it says it, doesn't it? It says that's

all they need.
If you conclude that the purveyor's sole emphasis is
in the sexually provocative aspect of the publication.

In other

words, there is a picture on page 37 that is sexually provoca­
tive.

That fact can justify the conclusion that the matter is

utterly without redeeming social Importance.

Sure.

Oh.

Okay. Now I am focusing on your

And that would not be a proper statement of the

We would all agree to that,, but that cannot happen in

California.

And the reason that thatJ cannot happen in California

is Time Magazine, with a single picture in it that may be provoc­
ative, or what else, would never survive a Noroff motion which
was made here.
You see, Time Magazine or many — Most material in
this area falls into one of three categories.

It is either

obscene as a matter of law,and I can't think of an example,
but I am sure there are some, or it's constitutionally pro­
tected which Time Magazine would be.

In which case, the

motion made here under Noroff — that’s why I said that pro­
cedure was important — would block the prosecution and never
get past that first motion,
QUESTION:
material:

I suppose there are three kinds of

obscene as a matter of law -~
MR* STEIN:

Not obscene, clearly protected.

I think

that is important to remember.
QUESTION:

An area in between that’s arguably

protected and arguably obscene.

Is that what we have here?

MR, STEIN: By a definition, that’s what we have here,

26
at least that.
QUESTION:

Do we assume that it is in that area

since the judge said It was —
MR. STEIN:

Not only do you have to assume it, I

think, you are bound to, you have to because under the
California procedure —
QUESTION:

In an arguable area.

We don't have Time

Magazine, but we have Playboy, something that's much closer
to the line, then if there is a mixture there of articles
and pictures, and so forth, would it not be true that this
instruction would justify the finding of at least the third
element of the test of obscenity just on the basis of one
picture?
MR. STEIN:
— that's correct.

That's correct, but as you point out
As to social Importance of the material,

true, but no matter how salacious or hov-j outrageous the pander»
ing of the material is, as you point out, Roth-Memolrs requires
two other elements: that it be beyond customary limits of
candor- in the community and that it appeal to prurient interests,
both of which have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
So, I think, taking the instructions together, it is
an appropriate statement of the law.
QUESTION:

Do you agree with your opponent that there

is a distinction between sexually provocative material and
prurient material?

27

MR* STEIN:
QUESTION;

Oh, sure.
That they are entirely separate elements.

And this instruction only talks about the sexual provocative,
It doesn't talk about prurient.
MR, STEIN:

That'3 correct, and the jury was

specifically instructed.' This instruction only went to the
social value, not to the prurience of the material.
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:

Right.
He can't make it prurient by telling you

it's prurient.
QUESTION:

And, am I also correct In my understanding

that In California thip social importance aspect of the three
-i

parts of the test is a question of fact for the jury?
MR. STEIN:
QUESTION:

That1s c orrect,
Each of the three parts of the test are

questions for the jury,and unlike the federal system —r and before
I came here I tried to read the Instruction given in Hamling.
I couldn't find that from my contacts, but I did talk to

■

a U.S. attorney in Southern California who had an instruction
that they gave in a similar case and he assured me It was close.
And I noticed right away that the issue of close case under the
federal instructions is strictly a jury question.

so, under California.

Not

You have to get past that Noroff motion.

It has to be unprotected»

As a matter of lav;, it has to be

outside the First Amendment, then we go to the jury.
Okay?
In the federal system — and that's the instruction
that was affirmed in Hamling — as I understand It, It goes to
the jury and then you tell them to look at the evidence and
look at the Ginzburg test and if you can't resolve these three
things from the face of the material, itself, then you look at
this evidence of dissemination and production and you come out
with an answer at the end,
QUESTION:

Could you clarify again for me the pre­

saying,

There is quite a difference.

Is he just

”1 will not rule,11 that the case must be dismissed?

Or is he saying there is an issue of fact for the jury to
dec ide?
MR, STEIN:

He has to rule that the material Is

outside the protection of the First — No.

He has to rule,

yes, that it, the matter is -- He hasn't dismissed the pro1

secution, if the material is not obscene as a matter of law.
QUESTION: Right.
MR, STEIN:

As a matter of law.

And, of course, that

test re-comes up ~~
QUESTION: But If he denies the motion, he does not

rule, as a matter of law, that it is unprotected?
MR, STEIN:

No, the defense may be able to shotv that

treat it in a manner which renders It within the Ginzburg — the
Roth-Meraolrs definition of obscenity,
QUESTION:

You go to the jury and, you get this in­

It would be protected as a matter of law,
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:

Well, assuming the judge did —
Well, we go on appeal.

He is entitled

to the same standard as the trial judge has to use under
Noroff ,to review the material on appeal, and, as I understand
It —
QUESTION:

Is he entitled to appeal from the ruling

of the judge at that stage of the hearing?
MR. STEIN:

No, but he is entitled to raise it on

appeal as though he did.
QUESTION:
MR, STEIN:

That’s right.

Entitled to raise it.

And he is entitled to one more before he

gets to appeal which —
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:

Sort of censorship, isn’t it?
Censorship?

30
QUESTION:
MR, STEIN:

Judicial censorship,
We are censoring material that's outside

the First Amendment in California and we ’would intend to continue
to do that.
But it is important to remember he gets another bite
of the apple.

After the prosecution puts all its evidence in*

he made the statutory motion to acquit for failure of the
proof.

And that was denied.and that's reviewable on appeal,
QUESTION:

If this case had arisen before the 19&9

amendment to California law., do you think the instructions
given would have been appropriate at that time?
MR, STEIN:

Yes,

0h? yes,

I don't think — I think

the evidence was relative and it was probative as recognized
in Ginzburg and maybe even before, so that the statute merely
recognizes the relevance of the evidence.

All relevant evidence

was admissible in California prior to that,
QUESTION:
given.

And instructions like this could have been

Do you know whether or not they were given?
MR, STEIN:

No,

I am not aware of any case in which

they X'/ere given prior to this, one way or the other.

I have

not been active In the trial of obscenity cases, only in the
appellate level and after this amendment was introduced,
QUESTION:

Do you read the instructions as merely

identifying evidence that is probative?

MR, STEIN:

Is probative on the definition — the

31
Roth~Memoirs definition of obscenity* yes.
QUESTION:

Mr. Stein, your opponent says the Noroff -

I haven't read the Noroff case.

I suppose I should have by now

but — He says that case held that the pandering evidence would
not have been admissible.

So, if the evidence wasn't even

admissible, how could the instruction have been given?
MR. STEIN:

I disagree with that reading of Noroff

and I'll leave it to your — to read it and analyze it yourself
but basically Ifll tell you what happened.

•. .

It was a matter that was protected as a matter -within the First Amendment, as a matter of law, was prosecuted.
Okay?
And the California prosecutor said the United States
Supreme Court has come down with Ginzburg which allows us to
bootstrap this material out of the First Amendment into the
area of obscenity on the — because of the way this fellow
pandered it.
And California says you might be able to do that In
California if you had the same statute that the Federal
Government has ~~ which you have a statute about advertising
in the mail statute., advertising and pandering a matter as
obscene.
But in California, we didn't have that statute.
They said absent that statute, there Is no way you can get
protected material up into — or out of the First Amendment and

32
down into the area of obscenity* on the use of this evidence.
So they threw it out and the trial judge’s dismissal of the
prosecution was affirmed in People v. Noroff, thus leaning to
the non-statutory motion that is made in every obscenity case
since* that this indictment has to be dismissed because the
matter is protected as a matter of law,
QUESTION:

In other words, this argument assumes

that the pandering evidence was proper in a federal prosecution
because of the federal statute?
MR, STEIN:
QUESTION:

Yes,
But the Memoirs

the last section of the

Memoirs case suggests the contrary, doesn't it?

Are you

familiar with the last section of that opinion in which the
Lady Chatterly’s — whatever the name -- That's not the one,
but anyway the Old English work was held to be, have social
value,, and then there is a section that says if we don't have
any evidence of pandering before us,

That’s the state case.

I don’t understand how you can rely on a federal
statute as the only basis, under Ginaburg and Memoirs, for
pandering evidence being relevant, which I understood you to
argue,
I guess my question is pretty bad,
MR, STEIN:
QUESTION:

I am afraid I —
What I am suggesting*I think the last

part of the Memoirs opinion is contrary to your argument, and if

33
it is then I wonder if we don't have a California ruling that
said* as a matter of state law, this evidence was not then
admissible and, therefore, isn't your opponent correct that
this instruction would have been improper?
MR, STEIN:

No,

The Noroff decision says that if

the matter is within constitutional protection, in the First
Amendment, there can be no prosecution in California, because
there is no statute that allows prosecution for the advertising
of non-obscene matter, as obscene,
QUESTION:
prosecution.

Well, therefore — This is also a state

Wouldn't it follow from that case that the

pandering evidence in this case would also have been inadmis­
sible?
\

MR, STEIN:

\
No, because the predicate of Noroff is
\

\

that the material is non-obseene, entitled to First Amendment
protection.

Okay?

Eera, that is not the fact because —
QUESTION:

And the First Amendment protection cannot

be lost by pandering evidence.
MR. STEIN:

That's right.

And if this material is

within the First Amendment, pandering evidence could not have
been admitted.

We couldn't even have gotten past the motion to

dismiss stage.

But, because it is outside, and I don't believe

Noroff —
QUESTION:

Well, but isn't Noroff then saying that

34
pandering evidence cannot make the difference between material
being protected and being unprotected?
MR, STEIN:
QUESTION:

Sure, that’s the point,
And here it did make the difference, if the

jury followed the instruction.
MR, STEIN:

Pandering evidence can’t convict the

defendant of a crime he didn’t commit.
selling obscene matter.

The only crime here is

The pandering evidence goes to whether

the matter is obscene or not.
Maybe I am not making myself — I realize I am not
getting across.

We didn’t make a crime that didn’t exist.

Selling obscene matter has been a crime in California as far
back as I could trace in the statute.
He knew that selling obscene matter was -- What he
is saying is —
QUESTION:

Why in this prosecution was any evidence

of pandering put in or why did you need the pandering instruc­
tion, then?

What function did it pls.y in this trial?

MR. STEIN:

Oh, the function that it plays is —

You have recognized the difficulty placed on the prosecution by
Roth-Memoirs to prove a negative beyond a reasonable doubt.
The prosecutor has to prove utterly without redeeming social
x^alue, beyond a reasonable doubt.
Vie would all say — and if I was trying 'the. case
again, I might say, "Well, these films are so bad that I don’t

35
need any other evidence.

Roll the projector and I'll make an

argument to the jury,”
But the prosecutor is faced with the problem that
he has lost ten of these in a row and he has got this book­
store down in Redwood City and he says, “Well, I am going to
try the best I can and Ginzburg says this evidence is relevant
on the test of obscenity as to social value.

And I am going

to take the whole shot I can,"

QUESTION:

Pardon me?

It‘s all in the magazine business.
Let me — I am not sure I didn't leave

a subject before I fully understood it.
On this instruction, the one picture in Time
Magazine problem.

Supposing that one picture is clearly,

patently offensive, clearly appeals to unhealthy, prurient
interests and then the question is whether the — the only
remaining issue then is ’whether the work, as a whole, is
utterly without redeeming social value?
And on that issue, that instruction would let that
magazine be found obscene.

MR. STEIN:

They.are instructed, though, that they

would have to find the material — I’ll read the whole thing,

MR, STEIN:

tion, that it was utterly without redeeming social value, and
then could they say, taken as a whole?

That instruction would permit them to.
It goes to social value.

that they could say it was taken as a whole.

I am not sure
But, even if

they could, they have to still find taken as a whole, It
appeals to prurient Interests and taken as a whole goes beyond
the customary limits of candor of the community, acceptable to
the community,
QUESTION:
MR. STEIN:

I see your point.
The Bible cannot be elevated out — It is

a negative we are talking about — It can’t be removed from
the First Amendment and made, somehow, obscene., no matter how
he portrays it, or how he — what he tells me this thing is —
because of the three-part test, and beyond a reasonable doubt
and the work taken as a whole.

And these instructions went

just to the evidence of dissemination and production.

39
How- as far as fche fact that Mr, Splawn was not the
creator, I doubt that Hasling created the photographs that he
put together and assembled in this thing and disseminated.,
Hamling was fche disseminator»

Ginzburg was the disseminator»

Roy ,Splawn is the disseminator.

The creator of fche materials’

That’s important to determining the

social value of fche material, what he was intending to do*
Roy Splawn
He'd seen the movie.

There is testimony he made a phone call*
He knew what was in them.

And so I think

the fact that Roy Splawn didn't create the movies, and there
is no evidence that he did, doesn’t preclude giving these
instructions or preclude the prosecution from using this
evidence,
I think it is important, too, to point out that the
jury was never instructed that they could substitute this
evidence for any of fche definitional requirements of RothMemoirs *

They were instructed that the purveyor’s emphasis was

40

on the sexually provocative aspects of the film, the motive of
the creator was an appeal to sexual curiosity and appetite,

cast.

they were never instructed they could jerk that — You know,

That's not in those instructions fairly read.

They

merely advise the jury that the evidence of the circumstance
of the production and dissemination were probative with respect
to Petitioner's claim of redeeming social value and could justify
the jury's conclusion that his claims were pretense for
litigation, not the way he sold these materials to Araand
Driven.
I would just say the imbalance that — The statute is

The prosecution

But Ginzburg recognizes the probative

value of the evidence and if the defendant hac introduced
evidence that he treated these films seriously, I concede that
he would be entitled to a similar instruction that the jury
could consider the way he considered the film as probative
of social value.
The instructions are weighed in favor of the
prosecution because that's all the evidence there was, and the

41
fact that the statutes weighed in favor of the prosecution
doesn't mean only evidence that they are being treated in a
pandering manner is admissible evidence or those instructions,,

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT- OF ARTHUR WELLS f JR0, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WELIS:

The reference in the record to the

statement where Mr. Splawn told Mr. Driven he could go up and
get them himself is at page 338, and I don't think Don Splawn's.
acquittal means anything because a very large issue in this
case was the issue of entrapment.

Mr. Driven was in constant

contact with Don and I think that provides one reason and the
general rule is one finds all reasons in favor of the judgment.
That should apply in this case.
As I understand California law, there is a case,-- I
think it is Scher v. Municipal Court.

I am sorry I do not have

the citation —- which holds that where a publication has dis»
creet — and I use that to mean separate and not in its other
meaning — items, you can look at any one of the items to
determine whether It fulfills the relevant constitutional tests
or statutory tests for obscenity, and,if so,the material can be

4-2

found obscene,
Scher ran the Berkley Bard and that's ivhy I recall
that's the case.

I could get that citation if you wish*

Therefore, it would be my view that in the Time Magazine case
if there was one obscene picture, one picture that had the
qualifications which you suggested it might have, the magazine
could be found obscene and Nor off motion wouldn't save it*
I think the Moroff motion — These cases arise
mostly in the municipal court.

And what happens is in California

you don't have any preliminary type hearing fco get rid of the
chaff, like you viould with a felony.

You don't have* a pre­

liminary hearing and the Noroff motion is, frankly, a sub­
stitute to get rid of the stuff that shouldn't be going to
trial at all,

___

Now, I don't think you can characterize this rule
fairly, these pandering rules, as merely evidence rules, because
what they are, they are part now of the definition in California.
I will say, however, that under the holding in Marx v.
United States, 1 think that Mr. Splawn will always be entitled
to Roth-Memoirs

standards and I think for him they are

constitutional standards.
Hamling is an entirely, as I read what you quoted inHamling, an entirely different set of instructions
much fairer.

which were

There the court said if it is a close case, look

at all the circumstances, .and didn't say anything about sexual

43
provocafcivene3s and didn't say anything about the motives of
the creator,,
And I will say that while the distinctions between
producers and creators may not be significant., the point was
that Ginzburg was on trial for behavior that he did and Hamling;
was on trial for behavior that he did and Splawn is on trial
for what the creator did, and there is no connection between
them.
QUESTION:

Did you object to all of the instructions

that you are now telling are —
MR. WELLS:

Yes.

There is a general instruction.

What happened, this was covered in the, everything was gone
through in chambers, and then there was a general blanket
instruction.

The matter was covered by the Court of Appeals,

specifically, and I think, therefore, all of these issues are
before you because under Jenkins v. Georgia it hadn't been
raised below and the fact that it was considered by the Court
was deemed adequate.
I would leave you with this point.
reason

For the very

that he suggests, that there is evidence of pandering in

this record, is the very reason why you have to formulate a rule
limiting it.
This is a case where a policeman had asked four or
five times for hard-core material and then because Mr. Splawn
said, "Hey, you know, I can get in trouble for this stuff,"

44
that statement is now being used to say that he pandered the
material, when it was perfectly clear that Driven wanted the
material already, that the sale, in effect, had been consummated,
’ even though the money hadn't changed hands, and it was perfectly
obvious that it was a nervous seller who wasn’t usually doing
this and that what he was doing was just trying to urge the
guy not to spread it around.
It is not evidence of pandering and any set of rules,
that permits it to be used as such is an unfair set of rules.
Thank you, very much.
