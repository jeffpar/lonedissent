Mr. Terrie,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP G. TERRIE, FRO.,
ON BFITALF OF THE
MR. TERRIE:

appellam.

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it please the Court:
This case comes to be heard on appeal from the
Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.

Tt arose in the

first instance in 1868 in the circuit Court of Ranawha Countv,
West Virginia as a suit to remove a cloud on a title.
Briefly, the facts.

In 1817 our storv will start.

At that time, one W.H. Odell acquired one-half -— an undivided
one-half interest in the oil and eras underlying a tract of
68 acres in Union District of Ranawhn County, TTest TTirainia.
I think we can agree that at that time his title
to the one-half undivided interest was a nood title.
fn February of that same vear, Mr. odoll sold
one-half of what he owned, or — a one-fourth undivided
interest in the oil and gas to one, U.C. Pearson, Jr.

He

delivered the deed, and the deed was dulv placed of record.
In the same month, n,c. Pearson, Jr., conveved
his interest, the same one-fourth undivided interest, to his

A

mother, Cede G. Pearson,

And *trs. Pearson was the Plaintiff

below and is the appellant in this case.
The deed from son to mother was dulv delivered
and duly placed of record.

This all took place in February

of 1037.
In 1^39 the assessment came on the land books in
the name of II.C. Pearson, .Tr.
to his mother.

It was never transferred over

Itstayed, unfortunately, in the name of H.r.

Pearson, Jr., as sometimes happens when assessors fail to
pick

up

the second deed.
OTTrcmTO'T:

mho failed, to nick it up?

MP. TFPPTF:

The assessor, the county

assessor,

your honor.
It staved on in the name of

n.r. Pearson, Jr.,

until 1967, when it was transferred to one, rT.P.

Dodd, who

is one of the defendants in this case, one of the appellees
in this Court.
From the time Mrs. Pearson acquired this interest,
from 1938 — '37 it came on

— through 1960, the taxes

were properly paid, the real estate taxes.

In 1961 the taxes

were not paid, for reasons which we do not have.

It was

very likely oversight.
In 1962 it was sold to the state by the
of the county

sheriff

following the procedures in West Virginia.

1964 it was certified by the State Auditor to the Circuit

In

5
Court.

And in 196S a suit was brought by the deputy commissioner

of delinquent and forfeited lands for Kanawha County, West
Virginia, pursuant to statute, to sell delinquent lands.
This parcel was one of the parcels in that suit.

It was

sold to W„P. Dodd, and a deed was delivered and recorded.
that deed, of course, is the cloud

And

that was souahfc to be

removed when this suit was instituted in the first instance.
Thereafter, Mr. Dodd ratified a former lease to
which Mrs. Pearson was never a party.

A well was drilled

on the property, started and completed in March of 1968.
And this suit was started in October of 1968 to remove the
cloud on the title.
And to go back just a little bit more.

starting

in 1967 and continuing up to the time the well was completed,
agents of Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, which is
one of the appellees here, and was the lessee in the former
lease I mentioned, agents of Columbia talked with Mrs.
Pearson, talked with her husband and with her attorney,
Mr. Cullen G. Hall of Charleston, West Virqinia.
Obviously, in making the complete abstract of the
title, as they always do before drilling a well, they ran
across the full story of the tax deed and the possible
outstanding interest in Mrs. Pearson.

They asked Mrs.

Pearson if she and her husband would enter into a lease
with Columbia, the idea, being, of course, that the Pearsons

6

and the Dodds would both be lessors, and Columbia would be
protected.

And then if any trouble developed, any title

problems arose, the Pearsons and the Dodds could fight it
out, and Columbia would simply be a stakeholder.
• V

Mrs. Pearson refused, told Columbia before it
started drilling that her interest was not released, and
that Columbia, if it drilled a well, would proceed at its
peril.
QUESTION;
MR. TERRIE:

All that is in the record, I take it.
Yes, your honor.

Now, I think I should say a word about the general
tax proceedings for real estate property taxes in Nest
Virginia.
QUESTION:

Up to this time Mrs. Pearson had not

asserted any claim, had she, with respect to Dodd?
MR, TERRIE:
fact.

Yes, your honor, as a matter of

I think it's not particularly important here, but it’s

true, she did.

Her attorney took the position that the —•

because — and the lower court ruled against this —- that it
had been forfeited because it was on in the wrong name.

Co

he did go to theauditor and presumed to redeem the land
for forfeiture for non entry.
QUESTION:

Nell, at what stage in this whole process

was that asserted?
MR. TERRIE:

About 1967, just about the time —■

7
QUESTION:

'57., but not in ’61, '62, '63?

MR. TERRIE:

Oh, no your honor.

No, your honor.

She is an older person and didn't honestly kno\<? that her
taces had not been paid.
QUESTION:
think the record

Her husband had been paying them, I

shows, then, didn't he?

MR. TERRIE:
couple.

Yes, your honor.

They're an older

He's now deceased, but at that time, he paid all

the taxes.
QUESTION:

Does the record show why he,stopped

paying them?
MR. TERRIE:
show.

No, your honor, tha record does not

There's no way of telling.
QUESTION:

He didn't die at that time, did he?

MR. TERRIE:
well was drilled.

Oversight, very likely.

Oh, no.

He was living at the time the

But that was much later that he died.

QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that there's

something about being an older person that makes you less
likely to know that your taxes ought to be paid?
MR. TERRIE:

Well, not necessarily, your honor,

but perhaps it could be.

These are — X won't say senile,

but older, and perhaps forgetful.
QUESTION:

It could be argued the other way: you’re

used to it —
QUESTION:

Had a lot of experience.

8

MR. TERRIEs

Well, yes, your honor, of course it

could be argued both ways.

I'in not taking a firm stand

on that.
QUESTION:

Anyway, the record doesn’t tell us why

it wasn’t?
MR. TERRIE:

Ho, sir, no, sir, it does not, your

honor.
QUESTION:

And you represent her?

MR. TERRIE:
her in this Court.

Yes.

Yes, your honor.

I represent

I did not represent her in the Circuit

Court proceedings.
QUESTION:

But in any event, there’s no question of

the fact that the taxes were not paid in the year 1961.
MR. TERRIE:

Ho, no doubt about that at all, your

honor.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, did she live in the area

in which the published notice was made?
MR. TERRIE:

She lived in Kanawha County, West

Virginia, and it was published in a newspaper —• vze’ll get
to that later — but the two newspapers in Charleston, West
Virginia, not far away.
QUESTION:

So we don't have a situation where one

lives out in California, and there's a published notice in
West Virginia?
MR. TERRIE:

No, sir, we have no non-resident

9

problem here.
QUESTION:

Did the son live with Mr. and Mrs.

Pearson, the appellant, do you know?
MR. TERRIE:

Your honor, I really don't know.

I

*

don't think he lived with them, he lived close by them.
QUESTION:

But tax notices continued to be issued

in the name of the son?
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, your honor.
But the father paid the taxes from 1937

until I960?
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So the son must have brought the tax

notice to the attention of his father?
MR.

TERRIE:

Or else he went down to the courthousE

and paid what was —
QUESTION:
MR, TERRIE:
QUESTION:
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Recorded agc^inst the property?
Yes, sir.
The record does not show?
I don’t think it does, your honor.
I thought the record did show that the

father and the husband was the actual person that paid the
taxes.
MR. TERRIE:

Well, the husband paid the taxes, there’s

no doubt about that.
QUESTION:

The father of the son?

10

MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
The father of the record owner?

MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, your honor.
I was asking how the father happened

to know?
MR. TERRIE:

I really don't know whether he lived

with his parents or not.

I just don’t know, sir.

and the Deputy Commissioner of Delinquent and Forfeited Lands

Mow, my case in chief rests on tv;o main points.
I’ll touch that.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we'll begin there

at 1:00 o’clock.
MR. TERRIE:

Thank you, sir.

[Whereupon, the Court was recessed until 1:00 o!clod
p.m., on Monday, December 1, 1976.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Terris, you may

re suae „
MR. TERRIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Just before we broke for the recess, I was
talking about Chapter 11 A of the Code of West Virginia.
Article 4 of that chapter provides for the sale of lands
by the Deputy Commissioner.
Section 12 of Article 4 is where I find my first
major point.

Section 12 provides that in the suit that, is

brought, notice to former owners, interested parties, is
given by publication only.

It makes it clear, makes it

explicit, that it is the intent and the will of the
legislature that publication is all that is required and all

13
that is necessary.
I feel strongly that that is a denial of due
process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States.
My second point is in Article 3, which is the Article
where the sheriff sells»

And if you’ll

recall, after the

sheriff sells to the state , there is a period of 13 months
to redeem.

I say that if that 18 month period for redemption

is used as a statute of limitations to bar the owner from
asserting rights that were denied him by point 1, then that
also is a violation of due process of law»
If I can look at —
QUESTION:

You say there's nothing to trigger the

18 months?
MR. TERRIE:

Exactly, your honor.

The statute

runs before the right has accrued.
QUESTION;

Of course on that theory, then, no

notice by publication is without infirmity, is that true?
MR. TERRIE;
QUESTION;

No notice — beg your pardon, sir?
Notices without — by publication are

then constitutionally doubtful, aren't they?
MR. TERRIE;
QUESTION;
MR. TERRIE;

I agree.
In all cases, in all settings.
Yes, sir, yes, sir, absolutely.

The opinion in the Supreme Court of Appeals of

14
West Virginia, I think shows clearly what I'm driving at.
First of all, he takes up my point one, and talks
about denial of due process because of no personal service
of notice, by publication only.

He cites State against Simmons,

an old West Virginia case —• not so old, 1951, which laid down
the law at that time that in West Virginia personal notice
was not required, that publication was sufficient.
And on that reasoning he quotes Syllabus 1 of
State against Simmons and says that is the lav/ at that time.
Then he goes into the famous case of Mullane
against Central Hanover Bank & Trust Company,
that followed it, and he talks about them.

cases

And he says,

he begins to say, this is tie developing of a new apprQarh
to due process.

And he quotes,

with

approval,

tx&m

the

Mullans case, to the extent, notice reasonably calculated to
apprise interested parties.
At that point, it looks like I'm going to get
somewhere with this opinion.

And then, it deviates.

He

cites Puentes versus Shevin, decided by this case — this
Court, pardon me — in 1972.

Actually, as you'll recall,

that case really held that the Florida and Pennsylvania
replevin statutes were invalid because they provided for
seizure of personal property without notice.
But in the language in that opinion, the Court
stated that not only does due process protect absolute

15
ownership, but it protects -- and here's the key word —
significant property interests and statutory entitlement.
And then — then, the opinion seizes on 11 A-3-8,
which is the 18 month period, and says that since the property
was not redeemed in 18 months, the owner, the former owner,
no longer had a significant property interest, therefore was
not entitled to due process, or personal notice.
He calls this 18 month period a statutory entitlement,
which he says is lost from the time it expires.

And in my

humble opinion, the Court's opinion goes full cycle.

He

uses 11 A.-3--8 as a statute of limitations to bar what he
was about to admit was an unconstitutional denial of due
process.
QUESTION:

You think the State has a right to put

any limitation on it?
MR. TERRIE:

Of course, your honor.

period was a period of redemption.

The 18 month

And that's all.

It was

just a waiting period, in my opinion.
QUESTION:

But do you think that you could come in

50 years later and claim it?
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Well, it depends, your honor, on -Do you?

MR. TERRIE:

In this case, do you think so?

No, sir.

Yes, yes.

If there was a

denial of due process, and it was not cured by some other
means, I would say yes.

16
QUESTION:

Well, then — you just said thatyou can't

publish, right?
FIR, TERRIEs

I said that publication is not good

QUESTION:
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Under any circumstance?
Yes.
Wall, why do you worry about

the 11

months or anything else?
MR. TERRIE:

I don't worry about it, but the

Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, your honor, used
that to bar the right to a sale — the lack of due process.

Well, I don't understand what your

Your complaint is that under no circumstances

QUESTIONi
MR. TERRIE;

What should the state have done?
The state should have started a suit

the way any other suit is started.

By filing a complaint

and having the clerk issue process, deliver it to a deputy
sheriff and have him go out and serve the party.
QUESTION:
in this suit?

Who would the defendants have been

18

MR. TERRIE:

The defendants in the suit as it

is now, are the former property owners.
QUESTION:

Well, if they had no record of Mrs.

Pearson's ownership other than in the deed book.
MR. TERRIE:

Your honor, my answer to that would

be that if process had issued, and if the sheriff had gone
out looking for H.C. Pearson, JR., he might have found out
t hat he was deceived.

He might have found Mrs. Pearson.

But

/

whether he found her or not, the fact that he tried, she
would have had due process.
QUESTION;

That is my feeling.

You don't argue that all the state had

to do was look in the deed records

Yes, sir, I think that’s a valid

I'm not saying they have to do that.

But I think

if they'd looked they could have found it.
QUESTION:
look at the

Well, most purchasers will certainly

—

MR. TERRIE:

Certainly.

QUESTION:

-- the title of the property.

MR. TERRIE:

Yes, your honor.

can't say what.the standard must be.

Yes, your honor.

I

Under Mullane, it says

reasonable notice.
QUESTION:

All the cases you rely on, though, so

far as what kind of notice you get, involve unexpected
potential for deprivation.

That is, condemnation, something

19

like that.

They don't involve the annual recurring payment

of taxes that everybody expects to have to pay on their
property.
HR. TERRIE:

That is true, your honor.

But I

maintain that due process goes to protect the little nan
whose property is lost because he fails to pay his taxes.
QUESTION:

Well, would it be any different if this

were a local bank title?

Are your principles arty different

if the local bank were in the posture of your client?
HR. TERRIE: No, sir.
QUESTION:

Same principle.

Well, you Said, the little people,

and you were talkinq about —
HR. TERRIE.

Because the local bank is probably

going to pay its taxes.
QUESTION:

Well, but probably — in the same posture

they didn't pay their taxes because of the oversight of the
c ierk.
MR. TERRIE:

In that case, no, I don't find any

difference.
QUESTION:
difference.

Or whether they're senile, makes no

Or whether they're 21 years old, or 31 and very

alert, does it really?
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

No, sir, no,

sir, not that I —

Is it possible that your client didn’t

get interested in this whole business until the '55 drilling

20
began?
MR. TERRIE: Certainly, your honor.

But the stakes

have got to be high to enable a little person to come up to
this Court.

It’s no use trying to hide that fact.

She came

to her attorney, and headvised her what to do, that’s true,.
If the: land were of no value, she wouldn’t be here.

"That’s

why it hasn’t come up for tan years.
QUESTION:

How many years without any taxes being

paid?
MR. TERRIE:

Those taxes that failed to be paid in

1961.
QUESTION:

Until when?

MR. TERRIE:

Have they been paid, yet?

In ’67, I believe it was, it was sold

to W.P. Dodd.
QUESTION:

So six years that there was no interest.

MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

That's right.
Nell, there probably wouldn’t have been

any tax bills after the real estate became the property of
the state, would there?
MR. TERRIE:

In West Virginia, the assessor actually

is not required to send out bills.

That he does in Kanawha

County, and I expect he was doing it then.

But .it’s purely

a matter of convenience of the property owner.
QUESTION:

But after the real estate became the

property of the state —

21
MR. TERRIE:

Mo, that’s quite right.

Yes, your

honor.
QUESTION:
to.

-- there was nobody to send the bill

There was no private ovmer.
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Is that right?

Yes, sir.
While I've interrupted you, let me ask

you this: it's far from clear to me.

There were: two — at

least two separate proceedings here.

One was, after the

taxes were not paid in 1961, then, at the sheriff's sals,
th< re being no bidder, the reel estate became the property
of the state.
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And there was no notice of that?

MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Oh, no.
To anybody?

MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

No, sir.
Now is that the -- and then later — and

then later, the state conveyed the property to somebody else,
correct?
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Now which of those two transactions, of

neither of which was notice given, personal notice given,
are you complaining of?
MR. TERRIE:
your honor.

The second one.

The second one,

22
QUESTION:
HR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:
MR. TERRIE:

Hot the first one at all?
No, sir.

Not really.

Why not?
Well, because the Dodd title is

not derived from the sheriff's sale.
QUESTION:

That's where your title was taken

away, was by the sale to the state.

Then you no longer oxmed

it, the state did.
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

We had a right to redeem, your honor.
Yes, but you were given no notice of

that transfer to the state.

You were given no notice of

your 18 month period to'redeem, and you're not complaining
about that, is that right?
MR. TERRIE:

■

I'm complaining about it being used

as a statute of limitations.
QUESTION:

Well, why aren't you complaining about

that substantively, per se?
MR. TERRIE:

Because I don't think it’s an issue

in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, it's a very big part of the proceed

ings that ended up x-7ith the real estate belonging to somebody
else, didn't it?

It vrent first to the state, didn't it?

MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:
MR. TERRIE:

Yes, your honor.
Without any notice?
Right.

23
Aid you8 re not complaining of that?

Well, I could complain about that —

The due process issue, I think, arises out of the

Deputy Commissioner's sale.

The sheriff’s sale simply

started the running of the 18 month period.
QUESTION:

Which is used —

Well, that’s what the Supreme Court

of West Virginia seised upon, that put the nail in your
coffin.
MR. TERRIEs

Yes, sir, the 18 months, they called

MR. TERRIEs

Excuse me.
Go ahead, sir.
Ho, you go ahead.
Well, I finished it.

The 18 month

period had expired before the right to challenge due process
in the Deputy Commissioner’s sale had even accrued.

That is

my position.
QUESTION:

Well, then, is your position, at least

in part, that the privilege of redemption that’s given to
you in the second sale is the kind of entitlement of which
the state has to give you notice if it’s goinci to take it
away from you?

MR. TERRI E:

Your honor, I don’t follow that.

In the second sale, the only redemption possibility
there's no redemption after that second sale.

Well, I mean, at the second sale -— isn't

that the one where the West Virginia Supreme Court talks
about the privilege of redemption?
HR. TERRIE:

It has run out by then.

And therefore,

you're not entitled to due process in the Deputy Commissioner'

But I don't think thcit's an issue in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, if that's not an issue, and if

that's constitutional, then this real estate in question

was the property of the state at the tine it was conveyed
to the other party, and you had no standing to complain about
it.
MR. TERRIE:

I think that — I think I did, your

honor.
QUESTIOR:

And that’s really, in effect, what the

Supreme Court of your state held.

But it didn’t go back

to any denial of notice at the tine the real estate became
the property of the state.
MR. TERRIE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
But you're not attacking that here.

You’re assuming the constitutiomility of that transfer.
MR. TERRIE:

Well, I don’t think — it's not an

issue in the lawsuit that was brought to sell the nroperty.
The only issue there is, the state is selling the property.
Arid, the former owner should have notice.

And he didn't

get it.
QUESTION:

Well, I thought your claim was that the

former owner should have had notice before the property
vested in the state.

And if you concede that that transfer

of property to tries- tate was wholly valid, then I fail to
see why the state couldn't do with the property as it wished,
without any notice to anybody.
MR. TERRIE:
QUESCION:

Any land owner can.

Well -Mr. Terrie, with regard to the first

27

sale, does the record tell us whether or not your client
had notice of that sale?
MR. TERRIE:
OUEG^IOH z

There was no notice of that sale.
Does the record show that?

MR. TERRIE:

I <jon!t know whether it does or not.

But under the law, all the sheriff does is publish.

would be no better than the second one.
QUE STOTT:

But it would be consistent with the

record that she might have read the newspaper, or been told
by somebody, and said, well, I don’t care because the land
is worthless.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WM. ROY RICE, ESQ.,

That's about all I do.

ig a title

And I am astounded that

a title matter of this nature would bring me before this
Court.

Nevertheless, perhaps X can shed soma light on the
subjecte because I have been in it from the very beainnincr.
It is important for this Court to know who IT.C.
Pearson, Sr., was.

That is the man, the husband of the

appellant, now deceased — that is, the husband, is now de­
ceased — and his son was II.C. Pearson, JR.

Rut in the

discovery deposition of H.C. Pearson, Sr. , we asked him to
give us some of his previous job experience,

"hat man was

84 years old at the time, which was 1968.
And he said, I spent almost 16 years with Ohio
Fuel Gas Company, which was a predecessor company to my
present employer.

And the question was, in what capacity?

And the answer was, as engineer and land department man.

I

had charge of both of those departments for at least 12.
years.
He left Ohio Fuel in 1027, and we asked him what
his experience in oil and gas work was from 1927 up until the
present time.

.And he said, I own some property, oil and gas

properties, in Kentucky and some in West Virginia.

And I have

helped drill several wells with your company.
And we asked him, did he own soj^e tracts of land.
And he said, well, a few years ago I expect I had SO or 60
or 70 tracts.

But I sold most of my tracts in Jackson County

to Star Gas Company, et cetera.

They knew* the taxing system for real property

It's helpful to

keep the facts in proner

QUESTION:

Well, those elements would only relate

they not?
MR. RICE:

I think they may impinge on both of

Certainly equitable, at least equitable, yes.
QUESTION:

Would you qive a different due process

for knowledgeable people than you do to less knov/ledqeable

MR. RICE:

No, but I think it's helpful to understand

who the man was.
Nov/ the tax ticket, after II.C. Pearson, Jr., had
cosiveyed the tract of land, the undivided mineral interest,
to his mother in 1937, stayed in the son's name.

And the

mother and father either picked up that tax ticket, or if
it was mailed to them, they paid that tax ticket in the
son's name.
QUESTION:

In what year?

MR. RICE:

In 1937.

that way for 24 years.

'Ahay paid the tax ticket

From 1937, when they bought it —

QUESTION:

To 561«

MR. RICE:

— when they bought it from T7.II. Odell,

up until 1961.
Then in 1961 that tax ticket did not get paid.

And

in 1962 there was a proceeding with two publications in two
1 ocal newspapers that said that that tract of land would
be

sold to the State of Nest Virginia if it were not

redeemed.
And then the sale occurred, and at this sale
individual bidders can come in and bid at least the amount
of the taxes.

And if they do, then that tract of land will

be— or parcel or interest, will be sold to the individual
purchaser.
And there is a notice provision in that statute,
a personal notice provision.

Before you can get a county

clerk's tax deed pursuant to that sale, there is personal
notice,
But if these tracts of land, because of a miniscule
amount of interest and the time and expense that it takes
to check the title to find out who the owners are and
where they are and how to serve them, people won't get them
in at the sheriff’s sale.

They won’t bid on the tracts of

land and own them and pay the

taxes, and the former owner

quite obviously won’t pay the taxes.
So you come up r.o the sale in 196 5.

31

QUESTIO?!:

Mr. Rice, before you get to '65,

does

the record tell us in fact v;hether the appellant got personal
notice in '62?
You said a statute requires it, is that right?
MR. RICE:

The statute would have required it had

there been an individual purchaser who had bid the amount
of the taxes.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

MR. RICE:

In this case, that did not happen, thus

the land went to the state for the amount of the taxes.
QUESTION:

With no personal notice.

MR. RICE:

With

QUESTION:

Either required or given?

QUESTION:

Or published?

MR. RICE:

No, there was publication.

QUESTION:

All right, all right.

no personal notice.
Is that true?

Now, do you defend

if that transaction were here on its merits, would you defend
that?

I take it the Supreme Court of West Virginia did not

say that that transaction would survive due process analysis.

didn’t.

MR. RICE:

I would defend it, your honor.

QUESTION:

But the Supreme Court of West Virginia

It said that it was immune because of the statute

of limitations.
MR. RICE:

Well, you see you have to keep the

sh3riff * s sale first in point of time.

And that one has a

32

publication —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. RICE:

—- and I would defend that from a matter

of due process.
QUESTION:

What, about the Supreme Court of West

MR. RICE:

Sir?

QUESTION:

What about the Supreme Court of West

Virginia?

Virginia would have to hold —
MR. RICE:

Well, they said that 13 months then went

by and cured any defects.

Or, at least it shielded that

transaction.
MR. RICE:

Because that is a constitutional

provision in West Virginia.

The constitution of 1872 says

that if the taxes are not paid, end they remain unredeemed
for 18 months, the title vests in the State of West Virginia.
We may as well face it, that's what the constitution says.
QUESTION:

If there had been a sale to a private

party at the auction, personal notice would have been given,
would have been required, would it not, to the former owner?
MR. RICE:

In order for the purchaser who bid it in,

that would be required, yes.
QUESTION:

Personal notice, and then a period for

an opportunity to redeem, correct?
MR. RICE:

Yes, yes.

33

QUESTIO!1!:

But since there was no private purchaser

and instead the title went to the State, no personal notice
required or given?
MR. .RICE:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

So there wasn’t any judicial proceeding,

MR. RICE:

There was not.

QUESTION:

And the statute doesn't require one.

QUESTION:

Simply a

It’s a forfeiture.

It's a taking of property.

And after 18 months, it's final.

MR. RICE:

That's what the statute said, and that's

what the constitution of 1872 says.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rica, is there any difference in the

character of the title which a private purchaser in 1862 —
I’m still focussing on the first transaction — would have
received after getting personal notice, and the character
of the citle the state got without personal notice?

Are

both of them subject to an 18 month period of redemption by
the former owner?
MR. RICE:

No, no, once the individual — the

individual purchaser has to wait 18 months in order to get
an abstract of title and a survey made, so that the periods

34
cover roughly the same time -—.
QUESTION:

But before the 18 month statute runs,

in the event a private person buys at the auction, then the
former owner gets personal notice?
MR. RICE:

that's right.

QUESTION:

But when the sale is to the state, no

such notice.

Why the difference?

MR. RICE:

Mr. Justice Stevens, the reason is the

The — quite obviously, the tract of land is not

valuable enough, or may not be valuable enough, for the owner
to pay the taxes.

And thus you come to a place whether you're

going to spend $50 an hour for a title examining attorney
to determine who the owners are, who the true owners are,
and where they are.
QUESTION:

I see.

And you presume it’s worth the

trouble if somebody's going to pay for the property.

And if

n ot, it's not worth the money, that' s the thought.

go on.

MR. RICE:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Let me ask one other question before you

The State of West Virginia has filed an amicus brief

in support of your position in which they say, on page 2
in the summary of the argument, that if the appellant had
made any attempt to pay her taxes for a period of almost
4 and 1/2 years, she would have learned of the tax status
of the property, and could have effected redemption.

They

35
seem to assume that she had a four and a half year period in
which to redeem.

Do you agree with that?

Rather than the

13 months.
MR. RICE:

I do not agree with it.

However, I did

not write that amicus brief.
QUESTION:

The State of West Virginia misunderstands

its own statutes, I guess.
QUESTION:

I see.

Well, isn’t it true that even after the

18 months, under Section 11 A-4-18, Mrs. Pearson had a right
to apply to a state court for permission to redeem her
property, and that could have been granted, is that correct?
MR. RICE:

Mr. Justice gfcewart, she was entitled

by grace of the legislature to do so.
QUESTION:

And by grace, in the discretion of a

court, giving her permission.

Correct?

MR. RICE:

Yes.

QUESTION:

So it wasn’t an absolute foreclosure.

I mean, she did have that possibility open to her.
MR. RICE:

By the grace of the legislature.

QUESTION:

And did she in fact make an unsuccessful

attempt to redeem under that section in this case?
MR. RICE:

OH, no, she never attempted to redeem

the property until — you see, ones she discovered that the
property had been sold to N.P. Dodd in late 1967, even then
she didn't go try to pay her taxes.

She waited until the gas

36
well came in and produced an open flow of IDO million cubic
feet a day, and then went to the State of West Virginia and
attempted to get a certificate —
QUESTION:

Waited until the race was over and

then went and bought a ticket on the winner»
MR. RICE:

Yes»

QUESTION:

One more question if I may, Mr. Rice.

APter. the 18 month period runs, and prior to the sale
pursuant to publication, as I understand the West Virginia
Court, there is no right in the former owner to have the
property redeemed.

But there is a provision thatthe court

in its discretion may allow it to be done.

Is there any

guideline whatsoever, or any tradition, that tells the
court what to do if a former owner comes in and says, I'd
like to get my property back, and the state says, well, I'd
rather not, because we've got somebody willing to pay a
million dollars for it?

MR. RICE:

What is the court supposed to do?

Mr. Justice Stevens, if the petition

is made by the former owner to the deputy commissioner's
office in each county, that deputy commissioner has forms
printed up that he will supply to the land owner, and it
doesn't even take a counsel.

Usually, he will get counsel,

because by then he has seen what difficult straits he is in.
But there is a form petition and a form order, and
just as a pro forma proceeding, the former owner is allowed

37

to redeem.

Under the control of the local circuit court.
QUESTION:

Well, then, is this somewhat analogous

to the situation where a discharged school teacher didn’t
have a contract, but had an expectancy that he’d always get
relief if he went in and asked for it?

There’s no statutory

right to recover, but the practice is so clear and definite
that she would always win if she got notice.

So why isn't

there the same need for notice as if she had legal right
to the property?
MR. RICE:

Because the value, the apparent value

of the assets at the time it is sold simply will not bear
the expense of determining the names and the addresses
of the parties that need the notice, if you determine that
they need a notice.
The State of West "Virginia faced up to this,
and between -- during the Depression years, they had a
chancery proceeding in West Virginia where you served in
these suits personal service on the residents and publication
against the non-residents.

But the title searches by the

deputy commissioners were costing so much money that it
obsoleted the value of the sale.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rice, may we go back to the original,

The tax we are talking about was due for the year 1961.

When did the property owner, or the owner of this interest,

HR. RICE:

The 18 months didn't run until 1964,

the middle of 1964.
QUESTION:

Well, I think that even if the —if

when the tax records, the name of the true owner had appeared,
the same thing would have happened here, there would have
been no notice.
MR. RICE:

There would have been publication.

QUESTION:

Wall, then, publication, but there

would have been no personal notice.
MR. RICE:

No personal notice.

QUESTION:

The state's brief tell us that she

could have redeemed up to Hay 27, 1966.

Do you agree with

that date?
MR. RICE:

No, I do not agree with that date.

QUESTION:

What date would — they've taken the

four years and added 18 months to it.
MR. RICE:

May of 1966 , did you say?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. RICE:

Your honor, that date would be accurate

then, because by then the circuit court suit had started in,
which was the State of West Virginia versus all of these
unknown owners, and there was a new statutory entitlement
that we had denominated, where she could redeem it again.
QUESTION s

And that was the second transacction?

40
MR. RICE:

That was the second transaction.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rice, let me give you one more

question that troubles me.
t his now.

I’m learning a great deal about

In 1962, you say that personal notice is justified

if there's a private purchaser but not if the state is doing
it, because the existence of a pra.vate purchaser

kind of

indicates there’s value there and it’s worth spending the
#738

money to get the evidence.
MR. RICE:

And that purchaser will pursue it.

QUESTION:

But why isn't the same rationale applicable

when the sale is made after the 18 months goes by, because
at that time you did have a private purchaser, and you had
a proceeding started.

Why wouldn’t there be the same reason

then to believe there's enough money in the property to
support that kind of investment in giving a fair notice to
the former owner?
MR. RICE:

After the — your honor, after the 18

month period had gone by, that would take you up to roughly
1964 —
QUESTION:

Which would mean there were more back

taxes to pay to acquire title, isn't it?
MR. RICE:

Yes, with interest.

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. RICE:

And then it's only in 1966 that you have

this second suit by the State of West Virginia against the —

41
what 1 say is an interim proceeding.
QUESTION:

By that time, it's your submission,

I suppose, that the State of West Virginia has been the owner
of the fee title for several years?
MR. RICE:

That's what the holding below was.

QUESTION:

That’s what the Supreme Court held.

QUESTION:

But at that time they're willing to spend

the money to have a judicial proceeding, but you!re not
willing to spend that little more amount to get service on
the former owner.
MR. RICE:

I don't understand.
Mr. Justice Stevens, part of the problem

is, there’s a case in West Virginia which says that this
second sale of delinquent land must be a judicial proceeding.
That is referred to in the cases as Sims against Fisher —~
QUESTION:

But isn’t that completely anomalous?

Because at that time, under your theory, nobody has any
interest at all except the state?

Why should they then

make it a judicial proceeding?
MR. RICE:

Your honor, that anomaly has been recognised

in West Virginia by a —• there’s a reference in the briefs
to the law review article in 54 West Virginia Law Review
on the side of the appellant.

Unfortunately — or perhaps

here is my opport'unity to mention to you that Professor Clyde
Colson at West Virginia followed that article with facing up,
in the same law review article, to the thing that has

42
concerned you, and it. is a lengthyartide, but I believe
it satisfactorily answers that question.
QUESTION:

The Sims case was decided under the

state constitution under a matter of the division of powers.
MR. RICE:

That's right, it was.

QUESTIONS

Are those open to public inspection?

MR. RICE:

Oh, yes.

QUESTION:

That's how a great many speculators

In your counsel —

go out and find out what property is available on tax sales,
isn't it?
MR. RICE:

That's right.

But of course the published

list gives a more complete compilation.
QUESTION:

Or engage one of the clerks in the

courthouse to do a little moonlighting and keep them posted.
MR. RICE:

There's a law against that.

QUESTION:

There is now?

In Minnesota, that is

the common practice.
«

MR. RICE:

Yes.

Your honor, I will, a little later on in my
argument, face up to the speculation problem.

What we’re

saying is — and I believe you need to consider the second
issue first, that is, whether the independent state determi­
nation that the title is in the State of West Virginia fore­
closes the constitutional issue.
>

If you will face up to the decision in Paschal!
versus Christie-Stewart , that was a tax deed case that
came out of Oklahoma, and there was a question of whether
the statute of limitations or the constitutional due process
question barred the tax sale.

And the intervening —- there

are three courts in Oklahoma, and the middle court held that

due process was violated»

The highest court in Oklahoma

held that due process was not violated.
When that due process question came to this Court,
it was sent back to Oklahoma to determine whether there was
an independent state ground, that is, the statute of
limitations, that would, under Murdock versus the City of
Memphis, substantiate the decision in the court below.

And

when the case.went back to the Oklahoma Supreme Court,, they
held that the statute of limitations, that is, adverse
possession, under the tax deed, barred the title of the
plaintiff and the appellant on the basis of ap independent

.......

'•

-

state ground.
And I say to this Court that Pearson versus Dodd
is an independent state determination,* that the title was in
the State of West Virginia; and chatthe appellant had no
title.
QUESTION:

The question was, how did the title get

in the State of West Virginia?

It got transferred from the

taxpayer to the State of West Virginia without any notice
to the taxpayer.
MR. RICEs

But Mr. Justice Stewart, if you will

harken back to Paschal! versus Christie-Stewart, the statute
of limitations was running against the plaintiff and the
appellant in that case, and there was no notice except the
red flag of adverse possession to tell the former owner that

45
the statute was running against him.
QUESTION:

Well, here there’s no red flag of

adverse possession.
MR. RICE:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

The state doesn't have arms and legs

and can't walk around the property or build a house there.
MR. RICE:

No.

QUESTION: And live in it.
MR. RICE:

But I believe

you can equate the two

independent state grounds.
QUESTION:

Well, in any event, as I understand it,

your brother is not attacking the transaction by which title
was transferred from his client to the state.
MR. RICE:

I understand that.

All of the cases seem to harken back to the Bell's
Gap case, and I take the position before this Court that
from a matter of taxation — and I don't mean to espouse the
common man test of due process, because quite obviuosly that
is not what determines due process.

But it seeris to me

that there is a built in notice on a recurring tax situation
where the tax recurs once every year, that the landowner
knows that if he hasn't paid his tax ticket within a year,
he'd better look out for what is going to happen.
That is the pre s uirie - to --know- the -1 aw argument.
QUESTION:

Well, in that case you wouldn't nee£j

46

to give notice by publication or personal notice or anything
else?
QUESTION:

Any kind.

MR. RICE:

I believe I would have to go that far,

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. RICE:

When we get to — turning to what is

yes.

stated as the first issue, we come to the Mullane case, and
I'll have to quickly say, I think the Mullane case is the
best case that Columbia Gas Transmission could citeto this
Court.
In -that case, it said accordingly, we overrule
appellant's constitutional objections to published notices
insofar as they are urged on behalf of beneficiaries whose
interests or addresses are unknown to the trustees.
And there is noindication that the Deputy Commissioner
or the State of West Virginia in this proceeding knew of
Cede Pearson, or even had they known of her, known her
address.

There was just nothing to indicate that.
I would like to mention to this Court, as I have

in the brief, that the minerals in West Virginia have been
severed going back to 1850.

Four generations have produced

such a proliferation of names and interests and addresses
and single girls owning property and getting married and
living somewhere else that there-'s just no way to assess the

47
individual — the statute provides for it, if the taxpayer
wil come in, he can get a separate

assessment.

But you

can't look atthe assessment and tell who the owner is.
When we — that reservation, it5s referred to as
Freudenberger versus Simmons in our brief, when that
reservation was made by Squire Jarret just outside of
Charleston in 1850, four generations —- in 1950, when we
tried to condemn the underground storage horizon to store
gas — took 900 defendants, and sfeillhad unknown parties
defendants.
Legally, I think the bast — the second best case
aside from the Mullane case is Stande^rd Oil Company versu?
New Jersey which is a simple

escheat case in 1951 which said,

after 14 years, Standard Oil simply publishes a notice which
says, this stock certificate and di\ridand in this name with
no address are escheated.

And that was upheld by this Court.

X would ask this Court

you know we have touched

on -- if there is anything wrong with due process, if you
find anything wrong with due process, under the case of
Cipriano versus Houma and Phoenix versus Kolodziejski, that
you treat the existing tax deeds in the State of West Virginia
as securities issued under a circuit court order, and in the
hands of parties like my client with valuable investments on
top of that.
Once again, the appellant in this case did not

4e
try to redeem until July of 1968,

And that 100 million

cubic feet of gas well came in in March of 1968.
QUESTION:

On the other hand, he said that you or

your client was fully aware of Pearson's existence and claim.
MR. RICE:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, we were aware.

You see we had a valid oil and gas lease from the other
three-fourths interest.
rapidly depleting.

This was a — newberg gas which is

That well will produce gas so fast in

the first year, it will produce more gas in the first year
than it has produced from the first year until the present.
That well had to be drilled not just to protect
the one-fourth interest.

It had to be produced to protect

the other three-fourths interest.

The well simply had to

be drilled.
QUESTION:

Well, granted that, aren’t you still in

the position of having paid the Dodds at your peril?
MR. RICE:

Your honor — Mr. Justice Blackmun, with

that approach you see — you are going to take the -- any
tax lands out of commerce and out of circulation.

Because

quite obviously, my client has learned —- you know, this
case right here is -- disparages every existing tax title
in the State of West Virginia.
investor to be on guard.

And

You know, it tells an
the conservative investor is

simply not going to make that kind of

capital investment

unless he has to ag WQ had to because of the rapidly depleting

asset.

QUESTION i

Of course I suppose you could say that

Mrs. Pearson had nothing to lose by cooperating.

It might

have to be paid into an escrow fundtor something, and battle
afterwards.
MR. RICE;

We attempted that.

And of course, she

could have enjoined the operation and did not.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. RICE;

Very well, Mr. Rice.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You have just one minute

left, Mr. Terria; do you have anything you want to tell us
in that time?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP G. TERRIE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. TERRIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Just a couple of points.

I think we've

proved

one thing, that the West Virginia tax law is difficult.
Christie-Stewart •— that case —QUESTION:

Just like every other state, they're

all the same.
MR. TERRIE:

Yes, sir.

I don't think the Christie-Stewart case is applicable
to this situation.

There it was sent back to see if it was

barred by a valid statute of limitations.

Our statute —

50

the statute of limitations that was mentioned by the Chief
Justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court is before us, it
was an 13 month period.

If it's valid or invalid — and I

say it’s invalid -— it's clearly before this Court.
He mentioned Dean Colson's article, which supported
the existing situation.

I ask you to read the last paragraph.

Dead Colson was a learned scholar.

After marching bravely

up the hill, he turned around and marched back, in my opinion
by saying, maybe the legislature ought to require a tax sale
purchaser to give notice to the former owner before he's
entitled to his deed.

And I think that's practically saying,

he must have notice.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:51 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted,}
