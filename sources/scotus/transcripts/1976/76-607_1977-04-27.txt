MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 607, 659, 700 and 722, Miree and others against
DeKalb County.
Mr. Mozley, you may proceed when you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. ARTHUR MOZLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MlREE ET AL.
MR. MOZLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
Mr. Heldman and I have a divided argument, pursuant
to the permission of the Court.

And I will speak for

approximately fifteen minutes, and will provide the Court
with a brief outline of the cas<>, and will devote my argument
to the questions of Federal pre-emption and implied private
rights.

Mr. Heldman will argue the issues involving third

party beneficiary status.
Whatever time remains after cur argument, we would
like to reserve for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

When you say, implied private rights, do

you mean an implied cause of action under the Federal Airport
Act?
MR. MOZLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, I do, your Honor.
Will you address yourself somewhere in

your argument to where that was first raised?

I've read the

District Court opinion and the Court of Appeals opinion and

s

4

I find no hint in either of them that that was ever raised.
MR. MOZLEY:

I believe that it was raised through­

out the case, your Honor, in terms of being beneficiaries
of the safety covenants in the grant agreements, and being
able to sue as third-party benefits — to sue for breach of
those grant agreements as third party beneficiaries.
QUESTION:

Well, you’re simply talking then, when

you say, implied right of action, you mean a third party
beneficiary claim; not an implied

Cort versus Ash type of

claim?
MR. MOZLEY:

Yes, sir, I’m speaking of an implied

Port v. Ash type of claim based upon breach of these safety
covenants and the Grant Agreements.

The safety covenants

and the Grant Agreements are also statutorily imposed
safety covenants under the Federal Airport Act.
QUESTION:

Well, are they two different theories

of action?
MR. MOZLEY:

Yes, sir, I believe if we wanted to

possibly split hairs, there would be two different theories,
yes, sir.
'I

QUESTION:

Well, then, if you have time, will you

say when you first raised your Cort v. Ash claim?
MR. MOZLEY:

I believe it was probably in the

5th Circtsit, your Honor, when it became apparent that the
5th Circuit had turned the question on Federal law.

5

These cases, may it please the Court, arise

from

the crash of a Lear Jet airplane at DeKalb Peachtree Airport
caused by ingestion of a large number of starlings in both
jet engines.

The starlings had been attracted to the airport

by an open, raw garbage dump maintained by the county alongside
the only jet runway at the airport.

And this garbage dump had

been in existence for some time, and as the record reflects,
was an attraction to literally huge flocks of tens of thousands
of starlings to the jet runway area.
Prior to the crash and under the aegis of the Federal
Airport Act

and related regulations, the county and the FAA

had entered into a series of six grant agreements, whereby
the county had received Federal funds for airport improvements,
including construction of the very jet runway in question in
this case.

These Grant Agreements imposed upon the county

the following specific safety covenants: one, operation and
maintenance of the airport in a condition, quote, safe for
aeronautical users, end quote; two, restriction of airport
property to uses compatible with normal airport operations
including, quote, landing and takeoff of airplanes; three,
prohibition of any activity at the airport that would inter­
fere with its use for airport purposes; and four, and possibly QUESTION:
MR. MOTLEY:
Honor.

Did you say, air force?
Airport purposes, excuse me, your

6

QUESTION:
HR. MOZLEY:

Not air force.
And possibly the most important is

four, mitigation and removal of existing airport hazards,
an airport hazard being defined by Federal law as anything
that adversely affects safety or flight.
QUESTION:

Now, this — these are cited in the

statute — these are the conditions on which the Federal
government —
HR. MOZLEY:
QUESTION:
MR. MOZLEY:

Yes, sir.
— may give the grants; is that correct?
These were recitals in the Grant

Agreements between the PAL and the County.

And they are also

statutory requirements under the Federal Airport Act.
QUESTION:

Well, they come into the contract because

they’re in the statute, I take it.
MR. MOZLEY:

Yes, sir; they come into the contract

because Congress required them to be there.
The petitioners base their claims against the county
on basic*fly four theories: negligent operation of the airport;
maintenance of a nuisance; maintenance of a Federally pro­
scribed airport hazard, which is the implied private claim,
Hr. Justice Rehnquist, that we claim we have; and breach of the
Grant Agreement safety covenants.
QUESTION:

Well, why does the District Court, then

refer to your claim as a diversity suit, and the 5th Circuit

saying is, the District Court opinion refers to it as

MR. MOZI.EY:

Yes, sir.
— the 5th Circuit refers to it as

MR. MOZLEY:

That is correct, yes, sir.

We don’t have Federal question type

But. we would still remain with complete

diversity jurisdiction.
QUESTION:
MR. MOZLEY:

Completa diversity jurisdiction?
Yes, sir,.

With respect to our argument based on Federal

8
pre-emption, we wish to make these points»

Federal safety

regulation of aeronautical interstate commerce extends to
practically all phases of aviation and it specifically includes
Federally funded airports.

The primary purpose of Federal

regulation of aviation, including the safety covenants involved
here, is to provide for the safety of interstate aeronautical
travellers.
The extensive and pervasive Federal regulation of
aeronautical commerce by necessity must pre-empt and preclude
any conflicting local laws or policies.

This is simply a

logical extension of this Court’s rulings in Northwest Airline;s
v„ Minnesota and City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal.
Application of the local county immunity law to
shield the county for liability for breaches of safety
covenants imposed by Congress certainly does absolutely nothing
to foster or enhance the Federally expressed concern for
airport safety.
To the contrary, shielding the county from liability
can serve only to emasculate and burden the Federally
expressed concern for aeronautical safety, and for safety
at Federally funded airports.
QUESTIONs

If you had' a highway negligently built,
/

but with a Federal grant of money, a joint construction
project of the State and Federal government, would the
states, in these circumstances, be liable in tort, or would

9

it have sovereign immunity for the negligent maintenance or
construction of the highway?
MR. MOZLEY:

A lower court, your Honor, has held that

the state would have sovereign immunity, in a different
factual situation than this case.

We believe that aeronautical

commerce and the: extensive Federal regulation of aeronautical
commerce and the deep concern of the Federal government with
safety, distinguishes this case from the example your Honor
just cited.
However, a lower court has held, as it is cited in
the briefs, that sovereign immunity would exist under the
limited example your Honor just gave.
So we — it is

our position that the doctrine of

Federal pre-emption here must pre-empt the County's immunity,
because otherwise, the safety objectives of the covenants
would be completely thwarted.
QUESTION:

So I take it then your position includes

the notion that Federal law governs this controversy, and you
t hink the Court of Appeals simply made a mistake in saying
that you weren't entitled to sue under Federal law here?
MR. MOZLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
And that's exactly the opposite position

from what you took in the District Court and the Court of
Appeals?
MR. MOZLEY:

Well, no, sir, that's not quite correct,

10

Justice Rehnquist,
1*0

QUESTION:

Well? you won in the District Court on

Georgia law.
MR. MOZLEY:

No, sir, the District Court ruled

against us.
QUESTION:

Oh, that's right.

MR. MOZLEY: The original 5th

Circuit opinion ruled

in our favor.
QUESTION:
MR. MOZLEY:

Yeah, that’s right.
And it was only really until we got

to the 5th Circuit and to the en banc majority opinion that
the question of Federal common law really became involved
in the case, whether the parties had overlooked it, or whesther
the earlier courts had overlooked it, remains to be said.
QUESTION:

Well, I take it ycu wouldn't — if Georgia

would you concede that if Georgia —■ what is your position if
Georgia law applies to this case?
MR. MOZLEY:

Our opinion that Georgia5a law of third

party beneficiaries is exactly the same as the Federal law
should be under Cort. v. Ash and under the original opinion of
the 5th Circuit, that anyone who is an intended beneficiary
of a safety covenant can sue for breach of contract, and that
such principle applies to counties.
QUESTION:

Rut if we disagreed with the Court of

Appeals on which law governs, I suppose we would remand

11
to see what the Georgia law is.
MR. MOZLEY:

No, sir, I believe the Georgia law

has been stated in the 5th Circuit opinion, and is untouched
by any reversal; and that is, that a county has no immunity
with respect to claims arising from contracts it was lawfully
authorised to make.
QUESTION:

So it simply -Judge Morgan took one position, kind of

had a detailed analysis? Judge Dyer took another position
with a much more detailed analysis under Georgia law.
MR. MOZLEY:

Yes, sir, but Judge Dyer did not

disagree with Judge Morgan's comments that a Georgia County
can be sued for breach of any contract that it was lawfully
authorised to make.
QUESTION:

But you think that panel decision !c still

in effect?
MR. MOZLEY:

That aspect of the panel decision is

in effect, because it is in parts one, two and four of the
panel decision that was adopted by the an banc majority.
May it please the Court, 1 would like to turn now
briefly to the subject of our equal protection argument which
was first made to the 5fh Circuit, and it's basically an
argument that application of county immunity here, or any
interpretation of the county immunity statute would work the
denial of equal protection.,

We have this situation.

Under

the classification schema urged by DeKalb County, if the

12
county seat of DeKalb County, the city of Decatur, had
operated this airport, we would not be involved here.

There

would be no immunity issue.
So the result of the classification scheme urged
by the county is simply that some suits against some local
governmental entities can be allowed, but other suits against
a practically identical governmental entities, with "respect
to identical airports, are disallowed.
We believe this is an unconstitutional burden on
the rights of interstate aeronautical travellers, and would
serve to deny them equal protection.
May it please the Court, I would like to reserve
whatever time X have.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Heilman.

I'd like to begin by z'esponding, if I may, to your

asserted below, and whether the notion of an implied Federal

this airport.

It had in mind the
The County owed

The County maintained an open garbage dump

literally adjacent to the runway.

Arid over a period of

years, they were told by the FAA that they were getting reports
of flocks of birds interfering with aerial navigation.

There

were actual reports made from the FAA to the County of
birds striking airplanes, yet not with fatal results.

And

what we have is an apathetic response, not to say a hostile
response, from the County.

Why'?

Simply because the County

deemed itself to be immune, and there was no adequate sanction
to make them take notice of this problem.
So it's my position that the immunity here caused
these deaths.

Immunity created an apathetic attitude with

respect to ignoring these Federal safety standards.

And I

think it’s fair to say that if this County had had to
recognize an absence of immunity, this wouldn't have happened.

15
MR. HELDMAN:

My answer has to be, I don't know.

I can answer you to this extant, Mr. Justice Marshall: after
this sad crash, and after these deaths, the FAA brought a
lawsuit to close it down.
QUESTION:

Which, the airport or the garbage dump?

MR. HELDMAN:

To close the gitrfoage dump down.

I'm having, I'm afraid, to go beyond the record.

compromised.

a reasonable possible result.

With Erie applied State law

the third — the Georgia third-party beneficiary exception
to its general immunity doctrine being at one end of a
reasonable spectrum.

And the implication of a Federal remedy

under Cort v. Ash at the other end of a reasonable spectrum.
And while adopting both of those arguments , I think
it might be more useful if I would devote myself primarily to
the application of Federal common law to some or all of these
issues.
The irony of the case is that the majority of the
panel decision below took the case as an Erie case construed
properly Georgia law to find this narrow contract exception to
the general rule of county immunity, and granted us standing.
Judge Dyer, who dissented from that, said no.
is a case where serious Federal interests are involved.

This
The

United States is a party to the contract; the United States
is a defendant in the lawsuit; this is aviation, which is
Federally pre-empted.

So we've got to try this case under

Federal common law.
And then he went on and found that as a matter of
Federal common law, the old restatement of contracts rule
145 from 1932 would give us a less liberal and a result: we
can't — a standard we can't meet as third party beneficiaries.
He ignored the recent cases, including the Bossier Parish
case which you, Mr. Chief Justice, sat on the panel of with

17
the 5th Circuit*, ten or so years ago where you held that
children had standing to assert rights as third party bene~
ficiaries under an agreement between a county and the
United States with respect to access to schools.

That was

certainly a Federal common law decision.
The Inglewood ™ city of Inglewood case from the
9th Circuit is

airport grant agreement case which held

that not only the City of Inglewood* but individual citizens
there as a class could sue as third party beneficiaries
to enforce aviation grant agreements.
So we assert that very cleeirly Federal common law
is at least as liberal on the third party beneficiary issue
as is Georgia law.

And I think this is

ought to be put to

rest by the fact chat just about ten year? ago the restatement
draftsman offered a new Section 145 which brings doctrinal
third party beneficiary concepts in line with reality* and
says that there could be no significant differences between

QUESTION:

But the breadth — at least the

potential of this issue, these issues, is such that I wonder
that the United States is not in as a friend of the Court to
give their views of the matter?
MR. HELDMAN;

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, the United

States was simply relying upon the fact that it's — the motion
to dismiss its cross claims was not granted, and that as a
matter of clear law — the United STates filed a memorandum,
and I think that’s

those cases are in my reply brief.

And

23
they make it perfectly clear that the county can't assert
sovereign immunity or governmental uimmunity vis a vis the

But the only thing

that’s before you today is the County’s motion to dismiss the

something that hasn’t come up, and I’m not sure I can answer
it adequately.

But off the top of m3' head, I don’t see why.

We feel that we have an adequate remedy against the United
States under the Tort Claims Act.

The fault of the United

24
States would be with respect to the operation of the tower
and the failure to report to this pilot that there had been
bird sightings.
QUESTION:

Would it include the failure of the

United States to close this airport down as a hazardous place,
on your theory of the case?
MR. HELDMAN:
QUESTION:

It could.

Mr. Keldman, I hcite to ask this question,

but is there a case still pending in the District Court
against the United States?

And if there is, was there a

rule —- order entered pursuant to Rule 54(b) making this a
proper appeal?
MR. HELDMAN:

Your Honor, the claims against the

United States are still pending.

The claims of the petitioners

against DeKalb County went up under 1292(b) cn that, as a
certified interlocutory matter.
I'd like to close by bringing beick my emphasis to the
middle of this spectrum, away from an implied Federal remedy
on the one hand, and away from the contract concept on the
other hand, into the notion that the Court can resolve this
matter by applying proper principles of Federal common law
here.

Both a proper principle of Federal common law with

respect to the rights of thirdparty beneficiaries, and also
a principle of Federal common law will not embrace an archaic
doctrine of immunity for a party which contracts with the

25
United States in a pre-empted area, of commerce, specifically
aviation, where the whole thrust of the statutory scheme,
and the whole thrust of the contract, is safety.

If you read

this record, you'll see that it's not a philosophical statement
to say that immunity caused this air crash.
I see that my time is up.
QUESTION:
Parden case.

Thank you.

Just one question:

you mentioned the

Do you consider the operation of a railroad

in Parden as a complete parallel to the Federal regulation of
all airports?
MR. HELDMAN:

In Parden, on the one hand, you had

the State itself deemed to have waived its immunity by
entering — our case is a fortiori from that.

On the other

hand, that was an FELA question in Parden, and I think in that
phase of the case — was easier, then.
QUESTION:

But that was on the old concept of the

proprietary aspect of the railroad, was it not, in part?
MR. HELDMAN:

I don't recall that it went on a

proprietary, governmental distinction? in any event, the
operation of the airport —
QUESTION:

Well, I'm quite sure it did not.

MR. HELDMAN:

I believe you wrote that opinion,

Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

I did.

MR. HELDMAN:

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bush.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF F. CLAY BUSH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BUSH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I'm here on behalf of DeKalb County.

And there are

a multitude of questions that this Court has presented.
let me go ahead with what I've prepared.

But

And it will probably

bring in some of the questions that: you all have raised to the
various opposing counsel.
Let me dwell —
QUESTION:

You do well if you can avoid questions

by a statement like that.
MR. BUSH:

Let me point out that in the initial

panel opinion, as raised by the dissent by Circuit Judge
Dyer, he stated in a footnote that if GcDrgia law applied to
this case, it would not change the result.

And that footnote

along with the dissenting opinion was adopted by eight judges
of the Fifth Circuit.
Now, we are here before this Court today not on any
54(b) certification: we're here becaui^ a judgment was entered
for DeKalb County, and appeal was taken from that judgment in
approximately late September, 1974.
?

Two opinions were entered

by District Judge William C. 0'Kelley, the first one in June o f
'74, and in that first one, he basically stated his opinion that

27
DeKalb County was immune from suit if the diversity law
applied.
QUESTION:

But the case was still pending against

somee other parties?
MR. BUSH:

It was, and Mr. Mosley, who is here to

argue, filed on behalf of Fireman’s Fund, Southeast Machinery
and Machinery Buyers, the various defendants and plaintiffs
he represents in dual positions, a motion for reconsideration.
The court reconsidered, and entered its opinion on I believe
September 25th, 1974; then entered judgment for DeKalb County,
by which an appeal was taken.
There are no cross-claims, we contend, pending against
us right now.

The suit is here upon a proper judgment entered

on behalf of DeKalb County.
QUESTION:

You don't think 54(b) has anything to

do with that?
MR. BUSH:

He did enter, pursuant to 54(b) — but he

directed the clerk to enter judgment on behalf of DeKalb
County, and judgment was entered, and it's in the Appendix,
your Honor.
Now, if I may proceed —
QUESTION:

And did the District Courts say there

wasn't any reason for delay?
MR. BUSH:

I believe he may have, your Honor.

the judgment was entered.

It is our opinion.

But

It was amended

28

subsequently to delete one individual that had been included
in it which should not have been„
If this Court should consider Georgia law, we would
direct this Court's attention to particularly the decisions
that have occurred since Judge William C. 0'Kelley, who we
contend had his pulse upon Georgia Law.

And we

w^uld show

this Court that in January of 1975, the Supreme Court of
Georgia in Azizi and in Sheley had before it the situation
where they were going to review the constitutional immunity
doctrine again.
anaccident

And there, they had situations and occurrences

occurred before the constitutionalization of this

immunity rule.
And here they said that it is no longer open to
abrogation by the Supreme Court of Georgia, because it is a
matter that has become part of 'the constitution of Georgia;
it has been ratified by thepeople; it has been passed by

the

legislature of Georgia; it has been signed by the Executive
Branch of the STate Government of Georgia»

Therefore, it

is

no longer open to judicial abrogation by Georgia courts or
by a court construing Georgia law.
Now, ir the later part of January in 1975, in
Williams v. Georgia Power, it was a matter involving Hancock
County»

And ii that case there had been allegations of

nuisance and allegations of third-party intended beneficiary '
to an agreement between Georgia Power and Hancock County.

And

29
the plaintiffs said that they were third party beneficiaries.
The Supreme Court of Georgia said# no; immunity to both
third party beneficiary and to theories of nuisance.
In October of '75, in Revels v. Tift County# we had
a slip and fall, a simple negligence action, in a County
Courthouse of Tift County,

No; immunity.

In March of 1976

now# this was after the panel

opinion# where we strenuously disagreed with what Judge Morgan
stated as to what he considered to be the law of Georgia on
third party beneficiary; approximately two months after that
panel opinion, in. March of 1976, in a case of Backus v, Chilivis,
there was a situation where a person had contracted with
Glen County, Georgia#

which is down near Brunswick# and in that

case, the plaintiff said# well, I'm a. third party foeneficiary
of that contract.

The Supreme Court said no; that person

was not an intended beneficiary.

And. it said that no citisen

is a third party beneficiary of a government contract.
Then, more recently# in February of this year, the
Supreme Court of Georgia had a State Department of the State
government of Georgia# contracting with the health facilities
services on Medicaid Payment?-

They promulgated certain

regulations wherein they said that there are maximum reimburse­
ment ceilings#

and these maximum reimbursement ceilings

cost them some money.

And a plaintiff sued, and the Supreme

Court of Georgia said, X!m sorry, we have immunity.

You sued

30

the stats in that particular instance; the Stata has not
agreed to pay you. damages or waive its immunity.

And since

it stands before us with immunity, we must apply it.
QUESTION;

Well, are you arguing that if we should

conclude that Georgia law controls, that we should decide
the Georgia law question, or should we send it back to the
Court of Appeals to decide?
MR. BUSH;

I don't really seek to advise the Court

on which position it should take,,

It is clear to me, your

Honor, that Georgia law, if it is applied by this Court or
by the 5th Circuit, would clearly hold DeKalb County immune
from this suit, and — as well as the third party beneficiary
arguments, would find that the County —
questions

Of course, it wasn't clear to the majority

of the panel on the Court of Appeals,
MR. BUSH;

Therewas soma disagreement, and it was —

QUESTION;

Wall, not disagreement; they squarely

held against ym,
MR, BUSH;

Well, they squarely held, on the theory

of applying two cases, which those two cases were subsequently,
two months later, in Backus v. Ch.il i

s, distinguished0

They

applied a case called Smith v. Ledbetter Brothers, which was
a case where they sued a person who had done some roadway
construction, and a highway traveller, as a suggestion of the
Chief Justice, wa3 injured.

And they sued the individual who

31
had actually done the work.

And the Court of Appeals of

Georgia said, that was a proper theory of .recovery.
Now, the Supreme Court of Georgia — that was a
fairly old case ■— the Supreme Court of Georgia, in March of
'76, said that case simply doss not apply to citizens suing
people who have contracted with the government or the
government itself.
QUESTION s

That may be a third party —- those cases

may relate to a third party beneficiary matter, but is that
the same question as immunity?
MR. BUSH:

We contend it’s twofold, you’' Honor.

QUESTION:

Yes, I would think so.

And what about

the Georgia law on immunity of the County?
MR. BUSH:

We contend, your Honor, that we’re still

immune, particularly because of the constitutionalization
of the immunity rule that we’ve referred to in our brief.

It

is now a situation, and as expressed in October, '75, by the
Supreme Court of Georgia, in Revels v. Tift County.

That was

a specific case where there was a slip and fall in the County
courthouse, and a simple negligence action against Tift
County.

And they said, the County is now immune from suit,

and it’s been constitutionalized.
QUESTIONs

The 3th circuit doesn’t seem to agree

with you.
MR. BUSEs

Again, I’m not — there was also a

32
member of the majority opinion who adopted that footnote of
Judge Dyer that

— Judge Hill was also a Georgia judge,

So we have a situation where one Georgia judge from the
5th Circuit was saying one thing, and one Georgia judge was
saying another.
But I will state to you, your Honor,, that that panel
opinion —

Well, what do we non-Georgia judges

MR. BUSH;

I would suggest to your Honor that the

I

Well

,

what if wa decide that Federal

Then what about immunity?

MR. BUSH2

We would contend, your Honor, that there

is no case I have seen from this Court that deals with that
issue.

There is a 5th Circuit case called McCord v, Dixie

Aviation, which says that State sovereignty is unimpaired in
the aviation area.
At this point, I would like to call your Honors
attention to a decision of this —QUESTIONS
this county immunity?

That's state sovereignty;’ what about
That's not state.

33

MR, BUSH:

Well* your Honor, it is our contention

that itis not only a state statutory immunity but it is a
state constitutions:! immunity.

not Eleventh Amendment.
MR, BUSH:

and it's still our position, that the —

QUESTION:

But the county immunity is certainly

an Eleventh Amendment —
MR, BUSH:

Well, we would not completely agree

that the Lincoln County v. Lnninc case is dispositive of
that issue.

In that particular case — and I have reviewed

that Lincoln County — it *?as a particular county in Nevada,
I believe, your Honor.

And that was a county that was

apparently drafted as a municipality as in Georgia.

In

Georgia, counties are considered arms of the state.

We’ve

cited the Supreme Court of Georgia decisions on that
particular point,
QUESTION:

Well, California made that argument in

Moore v, Alameda County, too, and we rejected it.
MR. BUSH:

All right, your Honor.

Well, it is

.my

34

position also, as well, that these are situations where the
allegations multiply, even of these present petitioners,
into the tens of millions of dollars, as far as damage
suits.

And this is simply a situation where the county has

no capability, and v/ould have no capability, under
governmental immunity, to pay for such judgments.

And a plea

would have to be made to the General Assembly of Georgia
to pay these judgments.

And there, on the Edelman v. Jordan,

in your Honors* opinions, we may come into the Eleventh
Amendment.

Because the State may be called upon, through

its general treasury, to pay for these particular judgments.
QUESTION:

Well, but the State could surely just

decline to appropriate the money,,
MR, BUSH:

They certainly could, your Honor,

that would be their decision in that regard.

But,

But I am not

completely agreeing that the Eleventh Amendment does not
apply.

Let me —
QUESTION:

Is the McCord case cited in your brief.

You may not have mine? min® is red colored, your Honor.
QUESTION:

How can anybody get rid of that nuisance

at this airport, if the county is immune?
MR. BUSH:

I do not agree with Mr. Heldman said

that — the suggestion is that the County refused to do
anything about it because they were immune.

The County, all

during this time, was trying to find a place to put its

35
county garbage .

It is a semi-urban county * and it' s a

situation where

no one in the County wants a garbage dump

next door to them.

It’s a situation of placement, disposal

of garbage.
QUESTION;

Well, if the. County had to pay a few

million dollars in damages, they might get interested.
MS. BUSH:

They certainly might, your Honor.

It

has already bean alleviated.
Let me point out to the Court as to the Federal
question that's presented.

This Court, through Justice

Stewart, unanimously held in a case that I, by my own mistake,
have not directed this Court's attention to, a case called
Executive Jet Aviation v. City of Cleveland,

That's at

409 U.S.

That

also was a bird ingestion case.

case

That case was a charter

flight arising out of Cleveland,Ohio.

And it took off and

started toward Lake Erie and it ingested some gulls; crashed
in Lake Erie.
A suit was filed in Ohio Federal Court, not alleging
diversity because there was no diversity.

They filed suit

based upon the theory of admiralty and upon the theory of the
Death of the High Seas Act,

For obvious reasons, there is

no Federal wrongful death action explicit in any of the
aviation statutes.
admiralty questions.

This Court dealt

greatly with the

But at the conclusion of dealing with

36

the admiralty questions, I think Justice Stewart, for a
unanimous Court, made an expression that is completely
applicable to this case and to the Federal issues that are
being raised.
only

In the situation that is before us, which is

fortuitously and incidentally connected to navigable

waters, and which bears no relationship to traditional
maritime activities, the Ohio Cozirts could plainly exercise
jurisdiction over the suit, and could plainly apply familiar
concepts of Ohio tort law without any effect on maritime
endeavors.
It may be, as petitioners argue, that aviation
tort cases should be governed by uniform, substantive and
procedural laws, and that such actions should be heard in the
Federal courts, so as to avoid divergent results and
duplicitous litigation in multi-party cases.

If Federal

uniformity is the desired goal with respect to claims arising
from aviation accidents, Congress, is free, under the Commerce
Clause, to enact legislation applicable to all such accidents
whether occuring on land or water, and adapted to the
specific circumstances of air commerce.
I cite also with regards to that a bill that
was introduced by Senator Tydings in 1969.

X have cited it

, in my brief? Senator Tydings suggested, and in his bill,
thought that there should be exclusive Federal jurisdiction,
a Federal cause of action, and a Federal remedy for aviation

They never

protects us in this respect.

Congress has that

And Congress has not created a private cause of

action, a private remedy,

Private remedy for wrongful

death, which is not recognized.
And we contend this Court should not. imply such a
remedy from silent legislation.

And in the Executive Jet

Aviation case, they refused to, in a bird ingestion case.
The citation of the City of Ingelwood seas , we
contend, is out of the 9th Circuit, and the alleged conflict
in the Federal circuits between the 5th Circuit arid the 9th
Circuit? that City of Ingelwood case i3 an eminent domain
case.

They recite particular facts.

There were no injuries

involved, no wrongful death, nothing such as that.

And they

also distinguish because they say that non~aeronautical
users were involved.
Here, these people contend they are aeronautical

And so they recite as authorities cases that don't

even have the factual basis, really.
Are there any other questions?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. ARTHUR MOSLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS MIREE ET AL.
MR. MOSLEY:

On page 22A of our petition for cert,

we incorporated the decisions in the courts below.

And I want

to call attention of this Court to the fact that in the
initial panel opinion, Judge Morgan, of the 5th Circuit, said,
.in talking about tie Southern Airways v, DeKalb County case
involving this precise airport, the court ruled that since

39
the Georgia Unifom Airport law expressly authorizes a
county to contract, the logical inference of that statute
is that the county may be sued for breach of contracto

This

is consistent with several other Georgia decisions, which
hold that statutory authority to contract, is necessarily a
statutory waiver of inununity to suit for breach,
QUESTION

What contract was hereferring to, do you

j

think?
MR» MOZLEYs

The contract in this case was a contract:

authorised by the Uniform Airports law' which is the same type
of contract we have here, your Honor, PAA grant agreement.
So the Georgia law on immunity is that immunity for a county
does not extend to suits based upon contractual obligations.
And as Justice Brennan pointed out
QUESTIONs

Well, didn't the majority, in a footnote,

disagree with that?
MR. MOZLEYs

No, sir, the majority in the footnote

simply said; we believe that under Georgia, law, the result
V70uld be the same.

Because undet Georgia law, these

petitioners are not intended beneficiaries.

It was a question

of whether we were intended beneficiaries? not an immunity
question.
Thank you, your Honor.
