MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Counsel? you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. KENDALL? ESO.?
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KENDALL:

Mr. Chief Justice? and may it

please the Court:
I'm David Kendall? and I represent petitioner?
Ehrlich Anthony Coker? who has been condemned by the State
of Georgia to be electrocuted for the crime of rape.
This case presents for review a question explicitly
reserved in last term's Gregg v„ Georgia decision? whether
the taking of the criminal's life is a proportionate sanction
where no victim has been deprived of life? for example?
when capital punishment has been imposed for rape that does
not result in the death of any human being.
Now on September the 2nd? 1974? petitioner
Coker was incarcerated for murder? rape? kidnapping and
aggravated assault at the Ware Correctional Institution
in Southern Georgia.

During an Alchoholic's Anonymous

meeting ha was attending that night? a group of prisoners
seised two guards? and in the ensuing disturbance, petitioner
escaped through the roof of the building the meeting was
being held in

About Il'iOO D.ra, that evening, petitioner
appeared at the horae of Allen and Rlnita Carver in nearby
Waycross, Georgia,,

Brandishing a board, he had Allen

Carver tied up in the bathroom, and moved the Carver’s
three weeks old sleeping baby in a bassinet into the
bathroom with Carver.
He secured a kitchen knife with a four inch
blade and took $20.30 from Allen Carver’s billfold which
was lying on a dresser.
He had Mrs. Carver change info her street clothes
in order to show him how to start the family car.

After

she had undressed, he raped her, and then clothed himself
in Allen Carver’s clothes.
During the rape, the knife lay on a nearby dresser
within petitioner’s reach.

He fold Allen Carver that he

was taking Mrs. Carver, that he would release her unharmed,
but if stopped by the police, he would, kill her.
After they left, Allen Carver was able to free
himself and called the police,

Within the hour, police

arrested petitioner, who had parked with Mrs. Carver on
a dirt road to evade a police roadblock.
Mrs. Carver was released, nervous, shaken, but
physically unharmed apart from the rape itself.
Counsel was appointed to represent petitioner,
and he was subsequently indicted for rape, armed robbery.

5
kidnapping, motor vehicle theft, and escape.
A special plea of insanity

was filed, which

under Georgia law sets up present competence to be tried,
and on November 19th, 1974, the jury returned a verdict
finding petitioner competent.

i

Now, the case was tried on all five counts of the
indictment under the procedures that this Court has reviewed
in Gregg versus Georgia.
At the conclusion of the first stage of the trial,
the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all five counts.
At the second stage —■ a proceeding was then held
to determine sentence on the two putative capital counts of
the indictment, the rape and the armed robbery.
Now, at this point the State introduced evidence
of petitioner’s prior capital felony conviction.

This

record consisted of three two-count indictments, involving
crimes against two victims.
With one Phillip Echols, petitioner had been
convicted in the Clayton County Superior Court for the
December 5th, 1971 murder of one Sue Ann wick—-the rape
and murder of Sue

Ann Wick — and had received consecutive

sentences of life imprisonment and twenty years imprisonment.
With one Glenn Harlan Stacy he had been convicted
after trial in the Richmond County Superior Court for the
July 29th, 1972, rape and kidnapping of one Susan Lorrine

6

Jones,

And for these crimes he received consecutive

sentences of life imprisonment and twenty years imprisonment.
Finally,, petitioner had pleaded guilty in the
Taliaferro County Superior Court to another -July 29th,
1972t rape of Susan Lorrine Jones, for which he received
a sentence of life imprisonment.
Now, the State introduced the indictment and
the sentences for these crimes, and presented witnesses
who identified the petitioner as the person named in these
indictments and sentences»

But details of these px’ior

convictions, of the factual circumstances of prior
convictions, were not adduced.
Petitioner presented no evidence.
The trial court instructed the jury that

as to

the rape conviction, it could find two aggravating
circumstances which, under the Georgia statute, justify
the imposition of the death penalty.The court instructed that the jury could find that
the rape was committed by a person with prior capital felony
conviction, and it instructed that it could find — that
the jury could find the rape committed by a person during
the commission of another capital felony, to wit, the
armed robbery of 620.30 from Allen Carver.
Now the trial court didn’t define particular
mitigating circumstances because none are defined in the

7
statute , but It did Instruct that In mitigation the jury
could recognise anything which in fairness or mercy could
justify extenuation of the degree of punishment.
QUESTION;

Do you suggest there aren't some

extenuating circumstances here?
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION;

Well —

On this record?

MR. KENDALL:

~~ Mr. Chief Justice? we believe

that the evidence of petitioner’s sanity, insanity of his
alcoholism

do indeed constitute mitigating circumstances.

Those had been presented to the jury at the first
trial.

This is essentially a trifurcated trial.

of the
There was

atrial on the issue of sanity which proceeded the trial of
guilt/innocence.
The jury found both aggravating circumstances
to exist beyond a reasonable doubt, and sentenced petitioner
to be electrocuted for the rape.
It imposed a sentence of life imprisonment for
the armed robbery conviction.
An appeal was subsequently taken to the Georgia
Supreme Court, and that Court, with one justice dissenting,
affirmed petitioner's sentences and convictions,

h

certiorari

petition was subsequently filed in this Court, and on October
4th of last year, the Court granted certiorari limited to
the single question, whether the death penalty may be

8

constitutionally exacted for a rape where the life of the
victim is not taken.
While the Court’s decision is of literally

"

vital significance to Ehrlich Coker, it won't have much of
an impact on the criminal justice system,, whichever way
the Court decides this case.

Because the death penalty

for non'"homicide crimes has been almost totally repudiated
by this society in fact.
Of the 345 people who are now on death row in
this country, six are on death row for non-homicide crimes,
the crimes that don't involve the death of the victim.
Georgia, is the only state, the only American state, and
virtually the only jurisdiction in the civilized world,
that now authorizes the death penalty for the rape of an
adult woman.
QUESTION s

Georgia also authorizes the death

penaltyp you've already told us, for armed robbery, does
it not?
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

And for kidnapping.

MR, KENDALL:

for kidnapping when the victim is

harmed or ransom secured % it authorizes the death penalty
for six capital offenses — I mean there are six capital offenses
after

Gregg.

It also authorizes the death penalty

for treason, for murder, and for aircraft hijacking.

9

QUESTION:

So the non-homicide •— so in

non-

homicide cases, the death penalty can be imposed tor five
different offenses under Georgia law?
MR. KENDALL:

Four, because the Georgia Supreme

Court, in the Gregg case, held that the death penalty
could not be constitutionally imposed for armed robbery.
QUESTION s

Despite the statute?

MR. KENDALL:

Despite the statute.

It was a statu­

tory holding? it wasn't a constitutional holding.
Indeed, after Furman v. Georgia sixteen — there
wore — the statesenacted sixteen non-homicide death
penalties.

Georgia enacted five of those.
QUESTION:

You say the armed robbery — the Georgia

Supreme Court's ruling that death couldn’t be imposed for
armed robbery was a statutory ruling?
MR. KENDALL:

Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

There

is a cruel and unusual punishments clause in the Georgia
Constitution.
Gregg case.

But that clause was not relied on in the
There is a provision for review of a sentence

that is disproportionate or excessive.

And the Georgia

Supreme Court held that a death penalty for armed robbery
was such an illegal sentence.
QUESTION:

Was it a holding that would apply to

all future convictions for armed robbery?
MR. KENDALL;

Yes, it was.

The Court has vacated,

10

since that time , two other death sentences for armed robbery.
In each case an armed robbery death sentence has been
imposed, it,,!s been imposed with a murder death sentence.

So

the one death sentence was vacated of each defendant.
Even in Georgia, only a small, arbitrarily selected
fraction of eligible defendants are condemned for rape.
Finally, the death penalty for rape comes to
this Court with a notorious and unsavory reputation for
racial discrimination.

Now petitioner Coker is white, and

the Court did not grant an equal protection claim in this case.
But part of our equal — part of our Eighth Amendment
submission, on behalf of petitioner Coker, is that the origin *
of the death penalty for rape, and such continuing acceptance
as it demonstrates, is really founded in invidious racial
discrimination.
Ninety riercent of the people executed for this
crime — the 455 people executed for this crime since 1930 —
have been black.

In Georgia itself in this period, 59 —

58 blacks have been executed, and three whites have been
executed.
Now, our submission on behalf of petitioner Coker
is essentially twofolds first, that the death penalty for
rape constitutes an. excessive and disproportionate punish­
ment for a crime where the life of the victim has not been
taken,.when judged by relevant contemporary standards.

11
And second, quite apart from this first claim,
that the present patternof imposition of the death penalty
for rape in Georgia, shows the same arbitrariness in
frequency and capriciousness of application that this
Court held violated the Eighth Amendment in Furman v.
Georgia»
Now, thatpunishrnent should somehow be proportionate
tothe offense was first recognised by this Court in
United States,

Weems v.

It was again recognised in last term’s ~

last July's capital punishment decision,
3!n those cases the Court held that the death penalty
for homicides intentionally committed by a defendant did not
violate the Eighth Amendment, was not a disproportionate
sanction.

But the Court reserved the constitutionality of

a death penalty where the life of a victim wasn’t taken.
Now, certainly rape is a sericus offense like
aggravated assault, mayhem, child torture, aggravated sodomy
cattempted murder.

The question here, however, is whether

rape will be punished by the ultimate penalty the criminal justice system can dispense.
In Woodson, a plurality recognised that the death
penalty is different in kind from a sentence of imprisonment
however long.

It said that death is qualitatively different

from imprisonment.
Last Tuesday, the plurality in Gardner v. Florida

12
stated that the death penalty is different.from imprisonment
in both severity and finality? that it differs dramatically
from any other leg.itimaie state action.
And the question posed here is not whether rape
will be stringently punished.

Indeed, Georgia authorizes

the sentence of life imprisonment for rape.
The question is really whether it can be punished
by the unique and irreversible punishment of death.
Mow in die Gregg plurality opinion, the Court stated
that to apply the proportionality test, the Court would not
look to subjective standards, but would instead look to what
it called objective indicia of contemporary attitudes toward
the given sanctions.
It recognised three of these objective indicia:
legislative enactments; jury verdicts? and what the Court,
called "history and traditional usage®.
We submit by the unanimous concurrence of these
indicators, the death penalty is cruel and unusual
punishment today.
Wow, as far as legislative enactments go, as I've
mentioned, Georgia coda annotated 26~200i is literally
unique in the United STates.

Mo other American jurisdiction

now authorizes the death penalty for the rape of an adult
woman.
In 1926 there ware 20 United States jurisdictions

13
that authorised a discretionary death penalty for the rape
of an adult woman.
Even before this Court's decision in Furman v.
Georgia, there was a trend toward abolition.

Delaware

abolished the penalty in '58? West Virginia abolished :hi
in ’65? the District of Columbia abolished it in 1970.
On the eve

of Furman, therefore, 17 states had

a discretionary death penalty for the rape of an adult
woman: • the 11 states o ft he confederacy? four border states—
Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Oklahoma, plus Nevada where
there was severe bodily injury? in the United STafces.
Now Furman wiped these statutes off the books,
because all were discretionary.
QUESTION:

But you don’t suggest that — that

this Court’s Furman decision represents a community consensus
that would ba the same as if those 17 states had themselves
repealed the statute, do yea?
MR. KENDALL:

Well, I submit that the Court's

Furman decision does reflect the disuetude into

which the

death penalty had failed in many kinds of cases, both
murder and rape.

We really, as an indicator of contemporary

standards, rely on the legislative reaction to Furman and
to Gregg, for that matter.
Because when the legislators had to take another
look at the crime of rape, only six states enacted any kind

14
of death penalty for rape offense after Furman.
Now three of these states, Tennessee, Florida,

y

and Mississippi, enacted the death penalty for the
rape of a child under 12, or in the case of Florida, under
11.

North Carolina and Louisiana enacted a very narrow

death penalty, mandatory death penalty, for the rape of an
adult woman, where there was serious bodily injury, or where
a weapon was used.
Only Georgia enacted a death penalty that would,
punish any rape of an adult woman with death.
So we think there was

the reaction to Furman

does manifest that legislative repudiation.
there is a further reaction.

And indeed,

Because since Gregg, this

Court’s decision in Roberts and Woodson had the effect of
invalidating mandatory death penalty statutes.

So that

invalidated Tennessee.?s death penalty statute, Louisiana ?«s,
North Carolina's, and Mississippi’s.

QUESTION:

Well, now, how long in time do you give

them to react under your standard of Furman?
MR. KENDALL :

Well, I think probably with those

states it's too short to be sure.

But we do know that,

for example, Louisiana has enacted within a month of this
Court's Roberts decision, enacted a death penalty
for . homicide, for certain kinds of homicide.
a death penalty for aggravated rape.

It defeated

So- I think that

15
Louisiana we can check off.

Tennessee

the only other

legislative activity that I’m aware of is in the State of
Tennesseey where a death penalty for homicide has cleared
the judiciary committee of both houses* and the death
penalty for rape bills have been defeated within those
committees.
So I’m not suggesting that there is enough time
since Gregg to fully assess if.

But we do know that there

have been four death penalty for homicide statutes passed
since Gregg.
for rapa.

Nona of those states have enacted a death penalty

And there are three other states* which we note

in our reply brief* where both houses of the legislature
have enacted a death penalty bill for homicide.

And

those are awaiting the governor's signature* in Maryland*
New Jersey and‘"Virginia»

And the houses of the legislature

have not enacted a death penalty for rape.
QUESTION:

You have mentioned the irreversibility

of the death penalty as one of the bases fox" its infirmity
*

constitutionally.

I wonder if you'd expand a little on

v

that.

How does that enter in this case in any different way

from any other capital case?
MR. KENDALL;

Mr. Chief Justice* I didn’t mean

to suggest that tlxat was the only reason fox its unconstituion-alifcy in this case.

What I did mean to suggest was that it

was a reason whereby an exceptionally high standard of review

16
and justification.
And 1 think that that fact — the death penatly
is different in one respect because it is irreversible; and
I think that that means that this higher standard of
review has to be applied to the justifications advanced by
the states-, and also to the consideration whether a particular
death penalty for a non-homicide case is consonant with
contemporary values.
QUESTIONi
haven ?t you?

You have two concepts there really,

The generality applying to the penalty in

all cases? and the application to the particular case.
Now, irreversibility is usually advanced as an
argument because of the possibility of error in the
judgment.
MR. KENDALLs
QUESTION:

Well —

And do you argue that in this particular

case?
MR.. KENDALL: Yes, we do.

We think that in one

sense, the execution of petitioner Coker, or
...

"

•

i

or Cook's

\

Everfteart

-

or anybody else on death row for rape, would be

error, not in the sense I think error is usually meant,
but in the sense that it is an erroneous execution, because
society has broadly repudiated it.
QUESTION?

Well, I didn't mean error in that sense.

I meant — I was directing my observation about error to

17
the argument visually advanced here that the death penalty
is obviously irreversible, and you might execute the wrong
person, that is, a person not guilty.
MR,, KENDALL;

Well, there are certainly other

collateral claims presented in this case, which the Court
did not grant certiorari on the basis of, that would
be pursued in collateral proceedings, which might demonstrate
that because of insanity or some other reason,

this death

penalty was erroneous.
So in that sense, we do have that claim of factual
error in this case.
The second —
QUESTION;

Mr. Kendall, before you proceed:

If we have a prison inmate who has been convicted
of aggravated rape and sentenced to life, a mandatory
life sentence under a statute that forbids parole, and the
innate escapes and commits another aggravated rape, what punish
menfc do you think would be appropriate?
MR. KENDALL;

That;of course is not the case

presented here, but —
QUESTION;

I understand.

MR. KENDALL;

— it seams to me that in the

circumstances of that case, imprisonment would be an
appropriate punishment when judged by what society does to
all other people who are *— essentially all other people

18
who are convicted of that crime,
QUESTION :

Would that be any punishment for that

1 ndividual?
MR. KENDALL:

It would certainly — certainly

he would have the stigma of another rape conviction.

Society

would be protected since it would have kept him incarcerated —
QUESTION :

The same way it was protected on the

first go-round?
I say, it would be protected to the same extent
that it had been protected after his first conviction for
rape?
MR. KENDALL:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Powell *—

Yet, he escaped.

MR. KENDALL:

That is correct.

Of course,

petitioner Coker was incarcerated ~
QUESTION:

I'm not talking about Coker,.

I was

asking your view as to whether or not there* could ever be a situ­
ation where in the absence of any ether punishment, capital
punishment would be appropriate for repetitive crimes of
rape.
MR. KENDALL:

Well, we think that the

objective

indicators that the Court pointed to in Gregg would indicate
that society — where a life has not been taken, the death
penalty is inappropriate to protect a value other than
life.

19
QUESTION?

What deterrence would exist in the

circumstances I described?
MR. KENDALL s

I think that the deterrent —

deterrence connotes protection for society? it seems to
me ? in that case.

I think that that certainly if there

is a life without parole statute, the

adding the sentence

would not in and of itself impose more punishment.
But insofar as deterrence is a question that
relates to the general public, I think the usual safeguards
that can be applied to prevent, escape would, adequately
protect the public.
Because it’s interesting? in both the Coker and
the CoJjky case, tdiioh are two — the Coley

case is very

similar to this case in many ways — even prisoners who
escaped from a correctional facility, committed rape?
neither of those prisoners was incarcerated in a maximum
security facility*
The State of Georgia can take more steps than it
has taken in these cases to protect society.

Also, the
9-

State of Georgia can enact, as it has not yet enacted? some
.i**

longer term of mandatory imprisonment for repeated crimes,
whatever those crimes are.
In Georgia, under Georgia Code Annotated
77-525, a prisoner comes up forparole in seven years,
regardless of what his sentence is.

Now, Georgia could

20
extend that time if it wished to do so.
The second
QUESTION:

Of course anybody who is serving a

life sentence without hope of pardon or parole, who
escapes, can with practical impunity commit any offense
unless

including whether it be petty larceny or jaywalking

or shoplifting — unless you decide that the only way to give
him additional punishment is to give — is to put. him to
death for jaywalking or shoplifting or

petty larceny;

isn't that correct?
MR. KENDALLs
on a recidivism theory.

Well, this case was really not fried
The jury was instructed that

Coker's repeated crimes could justify imposition of the
,

1

death penalty.

He had capital felonies other than rape.

The Georgia Supreme Court did not review it on a recidivist ,
theory.

In fact, its proportionality review consisted

entirely in the statement that the death penalty here is
not excessive or disproportionate.
As we point out, in comparison with the Coley
case, although Coley was an armed robbery recidivist,
the two factual circumstances are almost identical.

In

fact, if anything, the Coley case is a little more aggravated
on the facts.
But many states have opposed —* or many groups
have opposed life without parole* statutes, because it

deprives the corrections authority of all control over
inmates who hope at some point to be paroled.
QUESTION %

Haven’t any studies been made of what

happened in states thatlong since abolished capital
punishment, like Maine, for example?
MR. KENDALLs

What do they do?

Well, the only study I know of is

a study by Professor Bailey that appears in a 197S book,
Capital Punishment in the United States.

He did a regression

analysis, which indicated that, a, rape rates in abolitionist
states were lower than in retentionist states? and a?so
that the death penalty executions in retentionist states
bore no relation to the raps rates.
That would suggest that there is no deterrent
effect of the death penalty.

But Bailey also, I think in

fairness, observed that the death penalty was simply too
sporadically imposed to really warrant a good regression
analysis.

It's very seldom imposed.

It also constituted

no threat., he said, to the white rapist.

So he didn't

\

really say that his study was at all conclusive.

But

the data is so bad that it's difficult to get a conclusory
study.
So I've mentioned that petitioner with Messrs.
Hooks, Everheart, Shoe, Hughes and Boyer are the members
of an exclusive, but hapless, fraternity.
only people now on death row.

They are the

There are a couple of ways

22
to measure their uniqueness.

First of all the Uniform

Crime Reports indicate that about 1*200 forcible rapes
occur every year in Georgia,

That would be about 4*800

raps offenses committed under the new statute.
The other thing wa point out in our brief and
reply brief is that the Georgia Supreme Court has reviewed
59 cases in which life or less have been imposed as a punish­
ment for crime,

Not all rape convictions certainly were

appealed to the Georgia Suprema Court* but we do know that at
least 59 non-capital rapas have been reviewed*
I think Ifve said enough to indicate what our
Furman submission is,

It is simply that without- reaching

the question of whether the death penalty if disproportionate
for the crime of rape* the pattern of imposition here is
precisely that observed in Furman.

The death penalty is

an extraordinarily rare punishment for the crime of raps.
!*d like* if I may* to reserve the remainder of
my time for rebuttal,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. DEAN GRINDLE,

JR.* ESQ.

ON BEHALF OFTHE RESPONDENT,
MR, GRINDLEs

Mr, Chief Justice* may it please

the Court %
We have essentially

three points that we wish to

23
make this morning.
First is that the constitution does not define
what is and what is not a capital crime.
Secondly, we submit that condemning death for rape
under any and all circumstances would have far reaching
consequences over and beyond this particular case, and over
and beyond the question vis a vis rape, that is capital
punishment vis a vis rape,
Our third point that we would wish to stress
is, recidivism and violent crime.
l

The Court has noted that the wisdom of capital

r
r •

■

.

punishment is generally a matter for the legislative forum.
Wd submit that this reflects the wisdom of the framers of
the constitution, 'and that the legislative judgment is
bound primarily in. this area by the Eighth Amendment.
Now the Court in the Gregg series of opinions
has held that death for murder is not unconstitutional,
regardless of the offense, regardless of the offender, and
regardless of the procedure involved,

it is difficult

for tj.s to fathom how a constitutional distinction can be
*

i

j

drawn between rape and murder,
QUESTION:

You do concede, I suppose, General

QrIndia,do you not, that d^proportionality is one of the
criterion, one of the criteria, one of the ingredients in a
constitutional determination of whether a punishment is

24
cruel and unusual? in other words, you would concede, I
suppose, that the imposition of the penalty of death for
running through a red light would be cruel and unusual
punishment, would you not?
MR, GRINDLE:
QUESTION:

I would concede that,

I would --

So that is conceding that disproporfcion-

ality is a — can bo a dispositive ingredient in a determi-‘
nation of what is cruel and unusual punishment, is
MR, GRINDLE:

it not?

On the basis of the plurality in

Gregg and the concurrences, 1 think that I would be forced
to concede,
QUESTIONi

Well, you would,

wouldn't you?

Wouldn't you — you would concede, wouldn't you, thatthe
death penalty for stealing ten cents is cruel and unusual
punishment?
MR, GRINDLEs

Yes, I would.

And for purposes of

this case -.QUESTION s Regardless of anything this Court has
held, wouldn't you, as a constitutional lawyer, concede
that?
MR, GRINDLEs

Yes.

And for purposes of this

i
case/ We have, in effect, conceded that disproportionality
is a measure of the constitutional review in this type of
case.
The point that 1 wish to draw, in terms of murder

.Jji

25

and rape, is that the statutes are not designed to execute
all murderers«,

For the same reason, the statute is certainly

not designed to execute all rapists.
The point is, that some rapes can be viewed — not
only can be, but are viewed by society as just as serious
and calling for severe sanctions, just as many murders are.
In fact, some rapes, depending on the circumstances
of the offense, the character of the offender, would call
for more public condemnation than many murders, based on
the fact that many, many murders occur among friends,
among family members, and raps, of course, seldom involves
that situation.

That's not to say that it does not occur,

but it's generally a situation where the victim is a
stranger to the offender.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Attorney General, does Georgia draw

a distinction in its law between rape and aggravated rape?
do you have two separate statutes that —
(

MR. GRXNDLE:

The crime of rape is not defined in

terms ofrape and aggravated rape.

We simply have one

definition.
QUESTION?

The statute that's in the briefs is

the only rape statute in Georgia?
MR. GRINDLE:
QUESTION;
"r ■: TI rape?

Yes, defined as —

There's no statutory definition of

26
MR. GRINDLEs

There is not,

We have simple

raps and statutory raps.
However, by virtue of the fact that the General
Assembly authorises death as a permissible penalty for
rape, written into the capital punishment statute, is, in
effect, an aggravating element? and that we have to read both
together.
And to that extent, although we don't have degrees
of rape, just in terms of findings of crime, as a matterof
practice, before a death penalty would be authorized in any
particular rape case, it would be in the nature of some type
of aggravated crime.
QUESTIONs

Does this not leave the jury at large

to impose the death penalty in any rape depending upon their
their own reaction to the evidence?

Unguided by any

instructions on the standards of the kind Justice' Powell
was probing at?
MR. GRINDLEt

To the extant that the jury should

always refuse to return a death verdict, that may well be
true,

tut*- would also be true in a murder case,
The jury is always free to ignore the instructions.

In the general case, the aggravating circumstances would be
charged to the jury, and they would pass on those.
QUESTION s

_

The jury has to find at least on© or

more, statutory aggravating circumstances in order to

27
impose — impose the death penalty in Georgia, isn’t
that correct?
MR. GRINDLE:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

For a rape case or a murder case, or

any other -MR. GRINDLE:
QUESTION:

Any capital case,

But in this case, for example, an

aggravating circumstance would be a previous conviction for
a putative capital felony.

So that would be an aggravating

circumstance, even if the rape found were that of a jilted
boyfirend and his former girlfriend, people who were not
strangers, but who knew each other?
MR. GRINDLE:

That is correct, Mr. Justice

Stewart.
However, I should point out, and it’s important,
that this point be noted: and that is, the mere fact that
a particular aggravating circumstance is present does
not mean that death sentence will be affirmed.

In other

words, the presence of theaggravating circumstance is a
mere prerequisite to even considering the imposition of
the supreme penalty, and not —

Seven is more specific.

For you, isn't it?

MR. GRINDLE;

That one perhaps has been the occasion

for more litigation and argument than the others.

That is

not present in this case.
QUESTIONs

I see.

MR. GRINDLE:

That circumstance was not charged,

and of course it was not found.

Numbers one and two were

charged; they were found.
QUESTION;

And the others weren't even charged?

If you remember?
MR. GRINDLE;

I believe there was a charge on
:

armed robbery, but the jury did not find that.
QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

MR. GRINDLE;

The petitioner has submitted that

this case would not have •— or that is, a decision in his
favor would not have much impact beyond his case.

30
We disagree.
We disagree for this reason.

The recourse

available to society, if society determines that certain
non-homicidal crimes must, be punished and deterred , and
that terms of imprisonment are not sufficient, the alternative!
is to amend the constitution, assuming that the Court has
ruled in the petitioner's favor.

And that would be because

we submit that the case would be construed as having
consequences beyond just the crime of rape.

Specifically,

the exception noted in the Gregg opinion was crimes where
the offender has not taken the life of the victim.
Although opinions here would obviously be concerned with
rape, it would be construed, we submit, much more broadlyg
and that constitutional amendment would be the only
conceivable recourse? and that as a practical matter would
foe very difficult.
And revision, in light of future experience, would
b© very difficult.
How we don't know —
QUESTION;

Let a© asks your argument is that a

decision in favor of the petitioner in this case, holding
that it is constitutionally impermissible to sentence
t

somebody to death for the commission of the offense of
rape not involving a homicide would have broad implications
because it would ha understood as holding that the imposition

31
of the death penalty for any non“homicidal offense would
be constitutional and permissible.
Is that your argument?
MR, GRXNDLE:
QUESTION;

That is my argument,

tod what other non-hornicida1 offense

would you suggest would foe —- or should foe held to be
constitutionally permissible as far as the infliction of
the death penalty is concerned?
MR, GRXNDLE:

I have -two categories in mind,

tod that is* in effect* concerning yourself* that is* society
concerning itself with the violent recidivist, regardless
of the nature of his crime.
QUESTION:

Even though it8 s just repeated cases

of assault and battery, for example?
MR. GRXNDLE s
QUESTION:

Not necessarily for that ~

Well, that's violence.

MR, GRXNDLE;

I think — well, it's hard to foe

drawing a line as to say where who would draw the line,
think that would foe a legislative judgment.

I

But I would

look for the recidivist who has committed prior capital
crimes such as we have in our statute.

If he's killed,

if he's maimed and continues to do so, then society needs to
protect itself from that individual.
QUESTIONs

Well, if he's committed murder, this

Court in the Gregg case has given you the answer on that.

32
MR. GRINDLE:

I5m not responding really to the
kill
particular erinje where he does/the victim. Certainly, if
he has killed before, and he attempts to kill again, if he
commits another armed robbery or has killed or has seriously
maimed a victim,

if he has this type of record, and he commits

another armed robbery, it should be permissible to deter
that specific individual from further such acts.
Now, in terms of general crime -QUESTION5

Well, it would certainly deter him.

Generally, deterrent is considered as having a somewhat
different meaning? that is, to deter others, because of
the example you make of him.
MR. GRINDLEs

I want to move to what I call

specific deterrence as opposed to general deterrence, or
incapacitation.

I was referring to incapacitation in

terms of that individual.
QUESTIONs

Right.

MR. GRINDLEs

Also, before I move on to that

point, other crimes that may come to the forefront in the •
years to come, or_perhaps at this day and time, just in
the formative stages?in the past ten years we have seen
aircraft hijacking become somewhat of an everyday occurrence
inthe newspapers.
Fortunately, it has been curbed in recent years.
But if you have — and also, in a similar vain, hostage

33

taking has become vary popular.

In future years, terrorism

of that sort may continue to increase.

And when we have

hostages taken, if we have injuries to those hostages,
the disruption of the governmental process, that is the
type of thing that wa cannot be sure of.

And of course if

those hostages or the acts engaged in result in death, that
would be permissible to execute them there»
QUESTION:

Whatis your attitude —

MR. GRINDLEs
'QUESTION:

If they are prosecuted fcr murder.

Mr. Grind la, what is your attitude

about espionage and treason?
MS. GRINDLEs

These are older ones and —-

Yes, that, Mr. Justice Blackman,

goes to the integrity of the — of your democracy.

I think

that is a justification, perhaps? we put our freedom and
our form of government on a pedestal,

And although that

is historically been a capital crime, I have not given much
thought to the point, because of its fortunate rarity.
QUESTION;

Has anybody ever been sentenced to deat

in Georgia for espionage or treason?
MR. GRINDLEs
QUESTIONs

Not to ray knowledge.

Well, is espionage.-a crime in Florida?

In Georgi.a?
MR. GRINDLEs

Mr. Chief Justice, to my knowledge

treason is a crime.

I*ra not sure if we have a separata

crime of espionage.

And in my lifetime, I can't recall

34

anyone being tried for treason.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Grindie, what do yon read the

plurality opinion in Gregg as applying to the Rosenberg
case, assuming that the facts were all properly found in that
case and that they were guilty of what they were charged
with?
QUESTION:

In that connection, I asked the other

question not because Garogia might or might not have a
statute relating to espionage or treason, but because a
decision in this case will certainly bear upon federal
V

crimes, or federal treatment of those crimes,

hnd Justice

'v

Rehnquist8s question is similarly directed.,
MR. GRINDLE:

In response to that, your Honors,

the — as I understand the question, what impact the
plurality in Gregg would haveon the ease such as the
Rosenberg spy trial?

Do I understand it. correctly, your

Honor?
The — as I read the plurality in Gregg, there
must be a two-step process? first, is the crime served by —
or is the punishment — does the pnishment serve any
legitimate government interest.
ba: the best p'mlsbsaent.

Not necessarily that this

Snd number two, is it disproportionate.

And if the impact is to say that capital punishsent is unconstitutional if a life is not taken- -reverts
to a contemporary form of the eye for an eye principle.

35
And we submit that society should not be rele­
gated to such a simplistic formula, that in many instances
the need to deter such crimes would go to the very foundations
of your government would be sufficient justification to
permit the taking of a life when none has in fact been taken.
That is, none have been taken directly,
QUESTION:

0 f course, that legislative policy,

the legislative policy reflected in this (Borgia statute,
means that a person can commit murder with impunity, if one
wants to put it that way, if — after committing a rape,
An assailant could think, well, I might as well kill the
victim because the punishment would be no greaters isn't
that correct?
MR, GRINDLEx
Honor.

I would disagree with that, your

I think the logic behind that question would

perhaps be sound if we had a mandatory system, where the
offender would be executed just for comrritting the rape»,
would absolutely be executed ;■—
QUESTION:

Well, it8s not mandatory for either,

is if?
MR, GRtNDLEx

Wall, in the mandatory systems

that Woodson, in effect, threw out, that point would have
more validity.

In the discretionary system, I do not

feel it has ranch validity.

Number one, our statute gives

the rapist the- incentive not to ham.

If he does murder,

36
the likelihood of the chances that he will deceive a
death verdict are increased tremendously.

And if the

fear of capital punishment deters in the sense of saving
victims live?, we submit that it would also have a fall
down effectf in other words, that if life taking is deterred,
then the tendency to harm the victim would also he deterred
somewhat, such as the armed robber who goes into the
convenience store for the stickup.

H» would be deterred

from taking a gun perhaps into the store, fearing that he
would commit murder in the course of the armed robbery.
If he chooses not to take his gun into the store,
perhaps he won't commit the armed robbery at all.
Therefore, in our system, the incentive is not to
harm your rape, victim.

If you do, that still doesn't mean

that you will be executed.
Our third point is recidivism and violent crime,
and I've touched on that, briefly before.

And the question is

simply what is society to do with the incorrigible recidivist
who not only demonstrated that he will rape again

- but has

also demonstrated that he will likely kill or seriously
injure those whom he rapes.
Now, the petitioner has stated that h© was not
tried under a recidivist theory,
completely.

ffiell, we disagree with that

First, the aggravating circumstance under which

he. was found guilty, that we noted' before, is the prior

37
conviction o£ a capital felony.
the basis for such e

And we submit that that is

aggravating circumstance , or that the

theory underlying that specific aggravating circumstance,
*

if specific deterrence, that is, to deter — to preclude
that particular individual from committing further violent
crimes; to incapacitate thatpartieulax criminal.

And that

has bean recognised in many of the so-called mandatory
statutes.

In fact, in Texas, that is — it is required that

it be determined that the offender will likely engage in
further serious violent crime.
That was the basis of this aggravating circumstance.
It was relied upon heavily by the state.

And we submit that

was the primary basis on which he was tried, as a recidivist.

When m look at the

specific crimes involved

hare, we see three prior rapes, two pertaining to the same
victim;,

one victim was severely injured.

The other victim

was killed.
Now, the particular victim in this case was hot
harmed over and beyond the rape itself.

But we submit

that to deter those who have demonstrated their recidivism,
exact as this petitioner, the question of the constitutionality
of punishing death for raise should not hinge on the fact
that he did not harm his most recen t victim.

IN fact the
!

quickness with which hex was apprehended perhaps saved this
v

victim from a fate similar to her predecessors,

QUESTION;

If the death penalty is not imposed

on this man, did I understand you to say he will be eligible
for a statutory release arbitrarily at soma point?
MR» GRIMDLE %

Our parole board will review a

life sentence, or will review one serving a life sentence
after seven years.

And Mr, Coker would be sentenced to

life if his death sentence is vacated,
I would like to conclude with the observation

that Mr, Justice White made in Roberts, and that is, that
death finally forecloses the possibility that a prisoner

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Kendall?
MR. KENDALL:

Yes, Mr, Chief Justice, just a

few points.
Rebuttal argument of bavxd e.. kendall, esq.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KENDALL%
has more than one facet.

The need to protect society really
And I commend to the Court’s attention

the amicus curiae brief, filed by a number of women’s rights
organisations.

They make the point that for their constituents,

the death penalty for rape is counterproductive.

It

discourages prosecutions? may lead to jury nullification? and

35
gives the criminal , in a state where homicide is
punishable by death, an incentive to kill the victcm.

So

as far as they’re concerned, I don’t think anyone can
tax them with insensitivity to rape victims.

The death
i

pe nalty for rape is counterproductive»
Now, the second thing X8d like to say is about
the'use of the death penalty for other crimes.

As I pointed

out earlier, in the four years since Furman, nobody has been
condemned to die for seme non-homicide, and only six people
have been condemned to die for rape.
I think this underlines the wisdom of the Court’s
traditional Ashwander principle in not confronting this
case until it has to.

A decision in the rape case will

not necessarily decide those cases.

And those cases may

simply be moot, because the death sentences under these
other crimes may never come to the Court.
As far as the racial history of the death penalty
in. Georgia goes, I think it’s interesting that in the respondents
brief there is not one syllable of.exculpation of the history
of the death penalty for rape in Georgia.- We've set forth
the legislative history.

It appears to be designed after

the Civil War to punish black defendants who commit the
crime of rape against white victims.

That's what observers

have concluded, and that's what the statistics seem to
show.

So this penalty does not corae to this Court with a

40
a kind of even-handed history of application.
I've mentioned that the case was not tried on a
r eeidivist theory.

What I meant by that was that the jury

was not instructed in any way as to Coker's future dangerousnass,,
Now, we’ve attacked the statute on its face.

But

we also feel that even if there are some rapes which may be
capitally punished , this statute does not draw a defensible
line.
It may be that there is some kind of dahgerousness
test, or harm to the victim test.
