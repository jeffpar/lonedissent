MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments
/

next in 76-321, Stencel Aero Engineering Corporation
against United States of America.
Mr. Whelan, I think you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. WHALEN, ESQ.",
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WHALEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the claim of Stencel Aero
A

Engineering Corporation against the United States under
the Federal Tort Claims Act.
The issue in this case is not whether a corporation
can sue the United States for the government's negligence.
The answer to that is clear.

The United States may be sued.

The issue in this case is rather whether that govern­
ment's claim must be barred simply because the damages to
the corporation include injuries to servicemen.
Now the issue in this case arises in the following
factual context: in 1968 Stencel Aero Engineering
corporation entered into a contract with North American
Rockwell Corporation to upgrade an ejection system in a
F-100 D fighter aircraft being used bv the Air Force.
In 1973 one Captain John Donham, while flying one
of these F-100 fighter aircrafts, had his aircraft catch on

4
fire.

Donharn ejected, using the system of Stencel

Aero

Engineering Corporation? and successfully ejected and
survived»
However, he was injured, and thereupon filed a claim
I

against both the United States and Stencel in the Eastern
District of Missouri,
The Stencel Corporation cross-claimed against the
United States, claiming that the negligence that caused
the _injury was primarily due to the United States
negligence in the provision of raqureraent specifications
and components, which were used by Stencel in manufacturing
4he system which was installed in the Aircraft.
The United States moved to dismiss both the claim
of Denham and the claim of Stencel.

The District Court

granted both motions on the ground that Feres versus the
United States, a decision of this Court, controlled.
Donharn did not appeal; Stencel did.

They

appealed to the United States Court of Appeals, Hicrhth
Circuit.

However, the Circuit Court affirmed the decision of

the District Court.
QUESTION:

Donharn's case against Stencel is still

pending, I take it?
MR. WHALEN:

That is correct, your Honor.

In view of the briefs that have been filed in this
case -

Denham's case against the United States

is permanently terminated?

QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, it is.
He received compensation for his injuries

from the United States directly, did he not?
MR. WHALEN:

Correct, your HOnor.

compensation of about $1,500 a month

He received

under the Military

Compensation Act, and he's still receiving those payments.
The review of the briefs in this case indicate
that the United States does not really dispute that the
claim of Stencel is within the provisions of the Federal Tort
Claims Act.
The government complains about the ramifications of
applying — or rather the ramifications of: permitting
Stencel's claim in this case.

The government, does not dispute

that the language of the Federal Tort Claims Act, in sweeping
and broad terms, includes the claim of Stencel.
QUESTION:

Is that because Missouri law, which is

applicable here, clearly makes it an action in tort rather
than one is quasi contract, which it is in at least some
j u r I sd icfc ion s ?
MR. WHALEN:

Yes, your Honor, in part.

Rut the

language of the Act itself encompasses the claim —QUESTION:

It wouldn't encompass the claim, would it,

if this were a contractual action?

QUESTION:

That's correct, your Honor.
In any of the types of jurisdictions

to which my brother Stewart has just referred, Stencel in

a
their dealings with the government could have bargained for
a contractual indemnity, could it have not?
MR. WHALEN:

Yes, your Honor.

But I must poa.nfc

out that this case does not involved a contract between
Stencel and the government.

This is a contract between

North American Rockwell and the government.

Stencel*s

contract was with the North American Rockwell.
But to answer your question, yes, this could be
a bargained for item between a government contractor and
the United States.
Of course, if Stencel9s claim were denied in this
case, the contractor would make a provision to increase the
contract price to cover the possibility that claims arising
out of injuries to servicemen and government employees
were claims which the government would claim it's been
immune.

So that the contractor would attempt to take care

of that in its contract.
QUESTION:

The subcontractor can always negotiate

that kind of protect ionwith the prime contractor who won .Id
then take it in to account in his bid — in his contract
with the government.
MR. WHELAN: Yes, your Honor, he could.
QUESTION:

In other words, there are mechanisms

readily available for total protection?
MR. WHELAN:

Financial protection, yes, your Honor.

9

But I think —
QUESTION:

Isn't that all you're concerned about

here?
MR. WHELAN:
QUESTION:

Well, this case
what other concern do you have?

MR. WHELAN:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I’m —
Do you have any other concern for your

client except his financial protection?
MR. WHELAN:
protection.

That’s all xny concern, financial

However, I believe that this Court has a

broader concern, and that is, that the government, when it
acts, should not be — should be responsible for the conse­
quences of its acts.

So that the government can't walk away

from its responsibilities to a government contractor,
especially where the results of that negligence axe going
to — the victims of that negligence are going to be government
employees and, more particularly, servicemen.
QUESTION:

Well, but can you really sr-ggest that the

government has walked away here when this man is receiving
$18,000 a year without any showing of negligence, but
merely the showing of the injury?
MR. WHELAN:

Yes, your Honor, it has not walked

away from Donham, but it has walked away from its responsibili­
ties to Stencel.

The government, in it’s —

QUESTION:

Yes, but you’ve conceded that that’s

10

a responsibility which you could have contractually
protected?
MR, WHELAN:

I could have contractually protected

it if I had a contract with the government? but I do not.
QUESTION:

Well, you could have protected through the

primary contractor,
MR. WHELAN:

If, your Honor, I had that sufficient

bargaining power with the general contractor, that could
have been an item of our contract. ^5ra not in any case
dealing with contractual arrangements? we are dealing with
a tort.
Now, the government has not —
QUESTION:

As a matter of Missouri law, could the

indemnity claim be asserted by Stencei after the plaintiff
litigation had ended?

And suppose the plaintiff prevailed

in a separate suit against. Stencei, would Stencei
thereafter have a right to sue an indemnitor?
MR. WHELAN:: Under Missouri law, it depends upon who
the indemnitor would be.

If the indemnitor had no — in

either case under Missouri there was no requirement of under­
lying liability between a third party defendant and a
plaintiff.
After the action were over, under Missouri law, yes,
Stencei could sue the third party defendant or the indemnitor.
QUESTION 3

Is it possible that even if you lose this

11
case, you could reassert your claim at a later — after
judgment?
MR. WHELAN:

If I could sue the United States,, which

is the issue in this case, yes, I could.
QUESTIONs

Well, is it conceivable, at least

theoretically, that you might be able to sue them later
even though yon could not sue them in the same action,
the concern being that if they*re brought into the same action,
the plaintiff’s recovery might be enhanced by the fact that
the United States would be in Court, and its alleged
negligence, if proved in that case, might do something which
would contribute to the plaintiff’s ability to recover.
MR. WHELAN:

Yes, your Honor, I could, if the basic

issue which is before the Court here is decided in my favor?
the answer is yes.

I could bring a separate action against the

United States?
QUESTION:

But couldn’t you — at least — how

much ingenuity should it take, after — after a judgment
was entered against you for

liability to this airman, for

yots to sue the government in the court of claims under
a contractual theory, a quasi contractual theory?
MR. WHELAN: I have no -- if I had that right,
that’s the only place I could go, and that would foe —

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, ti seems to me that it perhaps

wouldn't take a great deal of ingenuity to frame a complaint
stating case of action under those circumstnaces?
MR. WHELAN?

Well, I think it would take more

ingenuity than I have, because we —*
QUESTION:

It may take more ingenuity than either

But -—

[Laughter.]
MR. WHELAN:

The government does not really dispute

that the Stencel claim is within the provisions of the
Federal Tort Claims Act, or that it falls within any of
the exceptions.
And more critically, the government has not found
one piece of legislative history indicating that Congress

12
inteded to exclude a claim such as Stencel's,
The government, rather, says in effect, what about
the ramifications of allowing Stencel's claim?

Essentially,

the ramifications fall into two categories: one, it
would disrupt the military compensation system, which was
set up by the Congress,
Now, let's look at that military compensation
4

system.

The military compensation system is essentially

a quid praquo between the government and the servicemen. A
servicemen gives up his right to the United States for
damages due to United States negligence, and in return
receives an ample and sure remedy.

Of course Stencel is

not part of that bargain? receives no benefit.

And in

this case, if you take the government's position, it is this:
Stencel*s claim is barred, or should be barred, simply because
one party to that bargain, the serviceman, is suing Stencel
for damages.

And the other party to the bargain, the

United States of America, says that that claim should be
barred.
In other words, the government is saying that the
bargain does not hold for Donkasa.

Ha can sue Stencel.

please, our bargain, do not permit anyone to sue us.
is essentially the government's position.
And 1 say to this Court, that the moment that
Denham steps out of his shoes and sues Stencel, he has

That

disrupted the military compensation system.
QUESTIONS
MR.WHELANS

He hasn’t recovered yet, has he?
No, your Honor, this is a third party

claim.
QUESTIONS

And we don’t know whether he will

recover?
MR. WHELAN:

No, your Honor, we do not.

But if

he does, and we claim under the Federal Tort Claims ACt,
that we have a right to indemnity, and in terms of jud5.eial
economy, having one court, one fact-finder — rather, two
fact-finders, in this case, but one litigation, to determine
all the rights of the parties with an interest in litigation,
that is, Stance1, Bonham? and the United States of America,
as well as the other defendants in this case, who we are
not here concerned with.
QUESTION:

Does the fact of privity between

Stencel and the United States in the contractual area
bar the United States from a suit against Stencel, assuming
hypothetically that it could show that the injuries to Denham
were caused by StencelSs negligence?
MR. WHELANs

No, your Honor, it does not.

The

United States could introduce its evidence, and say that
our specifications, our components, are requirements, were
perfect? and we exercised due care in making these decisions.
QUESTION:

I’m afraid I didn’t make my question clear.

14
QUESTION?'

Since the United States is now committed

to paying $18,000 a year, probably for the rest of Bonham’s
life, which will amount to a very substantial sum of money,
is the United States barred from suing Stencel on a claim
that Stencelcs negligence has caused this huge damage to the
United States government for which it must pay Bonham?
MR. WHELAN:
it is barred.

Well, your Honor, I think in part

I think that question, the question of equitable

recoupment, was raised before this Court in the Standard
Oil case many years ago, and I think that this Court found
in that ease, which I believe it is analogous, that the
government could not sue.
But Congress has passed a statute which commits the
government to recover for the expenses of the medical
services which were provided to Donham in this case.
this case, they are considerable.

In

So that in that event, if

all things go badly for Stencel, Donham will collect his
military compensation payment; Stencel will pay damages
to Donham? Donham will recover twice; and the government,
who we claim is the principal culprit in the accident that
is involved in this case, will not only not be sued for damages
by Stencel, but will be permitted to come into court and get
back from Stencel the medical payments that it provided
to Donham under the Congressional statute.
that is 'an outrageous situation.

And we think

position that Donham can't sue the government; he can't
recover; right?

Except where the Feres case says

MR. WHELAN:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, the Feres case —
Are you going to get to the Feres case?

MR. WHELAN:

The Feres case — I'm sorry your

Honor?
QUESTION:

Are you going to get to that case?

MR. WHELAN2

Yes, your Honor? I will address it now.

The Feres case was basically a suit between a
serviceman against the United States for injuries sustained
incident to his service.
This Court found in the military compensation system
a Congressional intent that Congress intended that kind
of claim by a serviceman against the United States was
not contemplated by Congress when

QUESTION:

And he will also get what you give him?

WHELAN:

He will get what we are held responsible

for.
QUESTION:

And which the government will then have

to give you?
MR. WHELAN:

The government, will, if we can prove

our case — and of course the case of Stencel against the
United States is a different case; different facts, different
theories of liability.

The fact of the matter is that we,

the corporation, on our claim against the United States,
is a different, claim, differently in consequence "•*

QUESTION:

Well, if there had not been this accident,

could you have sued the United States?
MR. WHELAN:

If there had not bean this accidant,

we would have no reason to sue the United States?

MR. WHELAN:

Could you?
Yes, your Honor, we could have.

If a civilian — if we had suffered

QUESTION?

If nobody had been injured, could you

MR. WHELANs
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.
So the only way you could sue is

MR. WHELAN:

That's the only grounds.

The only reason we can sue, your

Honor, if your HOnor please, if is we have suffered damage.
It's a different claim -—

That's our claim, your Honor; as a

result of the United States tort.
QUESTION:

Mr. Whelan, in vour cross claim, you

allege that after the equipment was delivered, it was in
the custody of the United States, and I take it you intend
to prove in support of your cross claim that there war
negligence in the government in the care and maintenance
of the system?

Is that correct?

MR. WHELAN:

As a matter of strategy, I probably

will not contend that, your Honor, because I think that
would only lead me into a contribution situation in which
I don't think I'm as sound as I am in indemnity; what I'm
claiming is pre-“delivery —
QUESTION:
was dismissed.

Well, that is in the cross claim that

19

MR. WHELAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, ifc is, your Honor.
You withdraw that allegation?

MR. WHELAN:
QUESTION:

Not yet, your Honor.

I will consider —•

Well, would it be an issue at the

trial if you prevail?

Will evidence be put in as to

Aether or not the government was negligent in the way in
which it took care of!the equipment after it was delivered?
MR. WHELAN:

I may submit evidence if I can establish

that that will support some claim of Stencel against the
United States.
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t a jury interpret such evidence

as supporting a claim by the pilot against the United STates?
MR. WHELAN: I’m sorry, I don’t -—
QUESTION:

The theory would be that the man was

injured because something was defective about the system, and
tie defect was created by the negligent maintenance of
the United States.
MR. WHELAN:

I would — I would — yes, that

would be a defense of my claim to Donham.

I would say that

the cause of this accident was the negligence of the United
States.

That, I believe, would be a defense, it would

be an absolute defense —
QUESTION:

But the jury would be instructed that if

that was the cause, there would be no recovery at all.
MR. WHELAN:

Yes, your honors Donham against

20

Stencel.
QUESTION:

Or Donham against the United States,

either one.
MR. WHELAN: Well, your Honor, Donham has already
been dismissed as far as the United States —
QUESTION:

Under Feres.

QUESTION:

Right, I understand.

But under your

concept of the trial, though, all three parties would be in
court arguing before the jury?
MR. WHELAN:

That's correct, your Honor.

This Court has addressed the problem of workmen's
compensation in two prior cases: the Ryan stevedore case
and the Treadwell Construction case, in which the
compensation system was not deemed to be a bar to a claim
over.
It's exactly the same situation if you accept,
as I believe you must, the military compensation system is a
form of workmen's compensation.
QUESTION:
wasn't it?

That was on a warranty theory however,

Which is quasi contractual;, in any event, it's

not tortious.
HR. WHELAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
With an implied warranty of workmanlike

service, in the stevedoring contract, wasn't it?
MR. WHELAN:

That's correct, your Honor.

But I'm

21
trying to direct the Court* s attention to the existence of
the compensation system, not to the theory of the defense
against a third party defendant.

It is correct that the

t heory of the defendant against the third party defendant
was I believe a breach of workmanlike service, something •—
QUESTION:

Warranty.

MR, WHELAN:
QUESTION:

Warranty, yes your Honor.
Mr. Whelan, let me just go back for a

second to this allegation in the cross claim about the
negligent maintenance.
How does that support a cross claim, as opposed to
being a defense to the main action?
MR. WHELAN:

If I'm able to establish that the

substantive law of Missouri permits contributions, then
I will attempt to shift some of the liability for which we
may be found in our suit involving Denham, we will attempt
to shift some of that responsibility —
QUESTION;

So that allegation is in on a contribution

theory as opposed to an indemnity theory?
MR. WHELAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, that is correct.
But you know in Missouri you're in

trouble on that contribution theory, aren't you?
MR. WHELAN:

Yes, your Honor, if the Missouri

rule applies.
But of course we have not had a full development of

22
the case ~
QUESTION;

No» I see.

But you have a more

doubtful position with respect to it.
MR. WHELAN;

Yesf your Honor? if Missouri law

applies.
QUESTION 5
MR. WHELAN:

Right.
The military discipline is the second

rationale which the government relies upon as a serious
ramification in this case.
First of all, I would like to point out to the Court
that military discipline is not an issue in this case,
and cannot be an issue in this case.

This is a case arising cut

of a government procurement activity.
The government, however, fears that a decision in
favor of Stencel in this case would involve the orders of
a field commander, and place his judgment — and impair his
judgment in the eicerciss of his duties.
However, if a field commander’s order is involved
in a case — it's not involved in this case, but if it”s
involved in another case, and I was defending a defendant,
I would make sure that that field commander would be brought
into court by subpoena deposition as another method, and
I would confront in that suit the plaintiff Donham ,
and his military commander.
So if the government is afraid of the confrontation,

23
as I think this Court was concerned in one of its prior
decisions, if you're afraid of a confrontation between a
field commander

and the plaintiff-serviceman, this

suit won’t -- a decision against Stencel will not stop that.
If the government order is relevant, I will bring
in the field commander.

I will put that order into issue.

And so the situation as it exists today does not — the
denial of Stencel's claim in this case does not change that
situation.
The orders of a military commander can be brought into
question^ and the Congress so intended it.

When the Congress

passed the Federal Tort Claims Act, it clearly clafined
employee to include military serviceman acting in the line
of duty.

It also provided a specific exceptions that is,

if the claim ajrises out of the combatant activities of the
United States in time of war, the United States cannot be
sued and does not waive its sovereign immunity.
We do not dispute that.
QUESTION;

Well, are you familiar with the case

of Brooks against the United States?
MR. WHELAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, I am.
Well, what if

in this case Denham had

simply taken the plane without any instructions from a
superior and gone off on a frolic of his own?

Such that

the Feres rationale would not have protected the government?

1 take it your casa then would be stronger, would
it not?
MR. WHELANs

The Brooks case — yes, your Honor,

there would be no problem.
situation.

The Brooks case would control the

Denham could sue the government, and he could

sue us if he claims that our ejection system did not
work properly.

our
QUESTION:
only issue.

Well, that's the issue.

That's the

I mean, we're not concerned here with the

merits of your claim at all.
MR, WHELAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
But the issue of the government's

suability here is an issue only because of the Feres case,

25
isn’t that correct?
MR. WHELAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Thera's no other reason?

MR. WHELAN:

'No other reason; that's right.

And

we think that the Feres case is simply a case of servicemen
against the United States,,

And even if soma commentators

say that that is really an exception to the Federal Tort
Claims Act, then we should be treated as an exception; and
that is, as this Court has held many, many times, the
broad sweeping language indicates a broad waiver of
sovereign immunity, and the exceptions to that broad
waiver of sovereign

immunity should be narrowly construed.

It’s the philosophy that's been expounded by this
Court many, many times.
If, however, the issue of a field commander's
orders does become an issue in the case, ifit5s that kind
of important decision, we

believe that Congress has

provided for that in the Federal Tort Claim's Act when it
provided an exception for discretionary function.
That is, this is an important kind of decision­
making; and the government is protected in its important
government decisions.

And if a decision, we maintain, is

not important enough to be protected by the discretionary
function, then it's not important enough to bar a claim like
Stencel's against the government, when the government has

26

been negligible and responsible for the damages which
may be sustained by Stencel in this case.
Finally, your Honor, I would like to conclude
on the ramifications which would occur if Stencel's claim
ware denied — Stenceles claim against the United States
were denied.
First of all, there would be a double recovery by
Bonham.

But the government would not worry about a double

recover? it would not suffer the consequences of a double
recovery.

But, as I mentioned earlier, notwithstanding,

the government’s negligence, the government could still,
under that congressional statute, come in and get from
Stencel the expenses of the medical — the medical
expenses it incurred in treating Bonham.
The government in this case is, in effect, saying
that with respect to our negligence, we are not responsible;
we want to be immune from the consequences of our act.

On

page 12 of its brief, in footnote 4, the government quite
candidly states? we owe no duty of care to Stencel.
Your Honors, we maintain that the government owes
a duty of care just as any private person.

Every private

person, every citizen, has an obligation to every other
person to exercise due care.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Whelan, 1 just hate to interrupt, but

your double recovery argument, 1 just don’t understand that.

27
You're not. going to be liable for medical expenses, if
the medical expenses are all paid by the United States,
are you?
MR. WHELAN;

Well, your Honor ~ yes, your Honor,

I am saying that under the Congressional statute, as I read
it —
QEUSTION:

you're not going to have to pay them to the plaintiff.

QUESTION;

Your Honor
There's an entire amount of injury,

part of which is owed to the government, and part of
which is owed to the plaintiff.
MR, WHELAN;
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.
Then you’re not paying for the same

injury twice, are you?
MR. WHELAN;

No, your Honor, but the government •—

the government, whom I'm claiming is responsible for this
accident, is going to be entitled, under this Congressional
statute, to sue Stencel, to pay for the medical costs of treati ng Donham —
QUESTION;

But if you're right on the facts, they

MR. WHELAN;

That's correct, they won’t.

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Martin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS S. MARTIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.
MR. MARTIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court r,
The issue in this case is whether Congress intended
that the same kind of litigation that is barred in Feres
would nevertheless be permitted if brought indirectly by
a third party plaintiff.
In my argument I would hope to touch briefly on
four principal topics.

First, the similarity between the

barred Feres claim and the claim which petitioner seeks to
bring in this case by way of indemnity.
Second, the propriety of applying a Feres immunity
against a third party manufacturer who had not received
compensation.
Third, the limited scope of the immunity that is
claimed here by the government.
And fourth, I'd like to briefly address our
alternative ground for affirming the Court of Appeals'
decision, namely, that indemnity will not be permitted in
the absence of liability running from the United States to
the injured party.
Now, turning to our first point —
QUESTION:

That -- your fourth ground —

29
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
~~ it’s not a matter of Missouri law?

MR. MARTIN:

It8s not a matter of Missouri law,

it's a matter of federal law.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MARTIN:

OUr first point: petitioner’s cause

of action, we believe, is identical

in a practical sense to

the serviceman’s claim that this court considered and
rejected in Feres.
Now, in Feres the executrix of a serviceman who was
killed in a barracks9 fire
from the United States.

sought to recover court damages

And the claim was thatthe military

had negligently quartered troops in a barracks with an
unsafs heating facility.
Now in Griggs and Jefferson, decided with Feres,
the claim was that an army doctor had negligently performed
a medical operation.

Contrary to petitioner’s apparent

understanding, there was no field commander’s order involved
in any of these cases.

In Feres, there was no plaintiff-

serviceman going to point a finger at the — at his commander.
Feres had died in the barracks fire that was the
cause of action.
So Feres, like this case, really involved another
party stepping into the place of the plaintiff and bringing
a particular kind of litigation.

30

Now like petitioners here,, the claimants in
Feres based their cause of action on the general language
of the Tcrt Claims Act and the absence of any specific
exceptions applying tc servicemen.
But in Feres, the Court demonstrated that in
this context, a military context, a causa of action cannot
be assumed from the general language of the 'Port Claims
Act»

To find out Congress' real intent, the Court turned

to the consequences of the proposed cause of action.

The

Court saw adverse effects on military discipline from the
litigation of injuries arising out of injiiries to servicemen
under orders.
It found an additional tort remedy to be inconsistent
with the compensation scheme which covers those injuries.
And lastly, it thought it unlikely that Congress would impose
the varying standards of state law upon the consequences of
Federal military actions.
The Court denied the Feres claim against the
United States, and it did so in very broad language.

It

said, and I quote, the government is not liable under the
Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where
those injuries arise out of activity incident to services,
close quote.
That's exactly the liability that we're talking
about here.

31
Now the Court in Feres appeared to realize it was
making a difficult judgment with respect to Congress’

intent.

So the Court said to the Congress, if we're wrong on this,
then Congress has a remedy; it can change the statute.
But in the 25 years since Feres was decided.
Congress made no changes in the statute.
suggests

And we think that

strongly that the decision to preclude litigation

in this area was, in fact, correct.
Now, the nature of petitioner’s claim is an
indemnity claim for recovery of injuries to servicemen.

And

therefore the subject matter of its claim must be the injury
to Captain Donham.
QUESTION:

Well, I could understand vour argument

if Stencel, if that’s its name, was an assignee, was suing
as an assignee, or an assignee by operation of law by
subrogation, then he would be asserting the serviceman’s
claim.

But here, Stencel is asserting a different claim.

The measure of damages is going to turn out to be the
amount he had to pav to Donham.

But it’s a different claim,

it’s a different theory of recovery.

He’s not an assignee

of Donham, nor is he an assignee by operation of law, bv
subrogation.
MR. MA.RTIN:
QUESTION:
as I understand it.

I agree with you.
It’s something

else under Missouri law,

3?

MR. MARTIN:

I agree.

It is not an assignee, it

is not a subrogation case.
QUFiRTIGH:

If it were, your argument would be,

I would think —
HR. MARTIN:

It would automatically follow.

And

it's a little bit more difficult than that.
Rut we suggest that Reres must have relied upon
the nature of the litigation process that was brought.

In

other words, the Court seemed to he concerned, at least as
interpreted in the Brown case and in Muniz, the Court seemed
to be concerned with the effects of a tort suit challenging
the action of military officers, and injuries to military
personnel under orders.
And it’s the litigation process which we think was
what the Court was concerned about.
Now, that litigation process, we suggest, must
be the same by the nature of an indemnity claim.

Not because

it's subrogation, but it's — it’ll have the same asoects.
Let me speak to that —
OUERmioN:

Rut Rteneel isn’t under any order from

the government, in the sense that it's a part of the Army.
MR. MARTIN:

That’s exactly right.

Rut Stencel's

claim, if we look ^ its cross-complaint, is that the United
\

States was negligent in causing the injury to Captain Bonham.
That’s the only way it can succeed, at least under

33

the theory that it has, in fact, brought.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:

Its theory is passive versus active.
Passive versus active negligence toward

Captain Donham.
QUESTION:

Mot only that, but that the United

States was the primary negligent party.
MR. MARTIN:

Exactly.

And we —- the United States

negligently designed or negligently maintained this ejection
system.

And as a result, we caused Captain

Donham’s injury.

Now, Captain Donham's suit, if he had not been barrec.,
would have been exactly the same.

The United States either

negligently designed or negligently maintained my ejection
system, and therefore it caused me injury.
So that negligent action, in terms of its theory, is
going to be the same, as Justice Stewart pointed out, the
damages are going to be the same.

There is no injury, as

Justice Marshall said, there is no injury to Stencel
independent of those damages to Captain Donham.
QUESTION:

Is it correct that the proof of its case,

Stencel would have to prove every element essentially that
Donham would have had to prove if the ^ort Claims Act had
not been barred —
MR. MARTIN:

I don’t see how he could have avoided

that burden, Mr. Chief Justice.

Donham —- Stencel would

have to show that there was a duty running from the

34

United States toward Captain Denham that somehow we negligent!y
performed, and there was an injury to Captain Donham.
QUESTION:
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

Well they -Causation has to be determined.

prepares

The case started by a suit by Donham.
And they sued the United States.
Sued the United States.
And the case was dismissed.
On exactly these allegations.

And the

And now we’re going to have, if Stencel

prevails — the exactly same litigation, except

now the indemnitee as opposed to the serviceman himself.
QUESTION:

Rut aren’t you going to have some of the

same issues in a litigation between Donham and Stencel,
which can concededly be brought?
MR. ?!ARTIN:

I think it's possible that we could

have some of those issues.

I think it’s also possible that

Stencel may, in the absence of a third party recovery
possibility, settle this kind of suit.

It’s true, as we

recognized in our brief, that there can be seme inroads on
the policies which Feres meant to protect.

In other words

Peres attempted to protect the military from getting into
the business of litigating its decisions.

35

There will be no determination by a Court, as
there would be in a suit by Stencel, that Officer Jackson
negligently failed to do something on a particular day.

It'll

just be a determination, if it comes about at all, that in fact
Stencel did not cause the particular injury here.

And we

think that's significantly different.
If you have the kind of litigation process where
»
you have an advocacy situation, a military officer accused
of negligently performing a duty, I think the Court feared
that after that litigation there's going to be questions about
the impact on the relationship between the officers who testi­
fied, the impact on the confidence of the officer who was
found negligent, impact upon the confidence of theofcher
officers who might have to make similar judgmental decisions,
an impact on those who have to respond, the subordinates
to that officer.
The Court fait that Congress intended to exclude
this kind of litigation.

And again, Congress' failure to

change the rules suggests to me, at least, that the Court
was in fact right.

■-----

So while we recognize that unlike Feres, the
former plaintiff hare is a corporation, we think it does
alter the more fundamental similarities, the subject matter
of the litigation.

In other words, ■ ,an injury to an active

question: who caused that accident?

That’s the same
The theory of liability:

Donham and Stencel both say that it’s the United States
that caused that accident.

7\nd so the litigation would be

the same.

The litigation process would be an attempt to

place that responsibility on the military officers who made
the decision to get that particular ejection system, or maintain
that particular ejection system.
QUESTION:

Mr. Martin, if I could just interrupt.

It seems to me, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested, if their
defense is, it was negligent maintenance, for example, aren’t
they going to put in precisely the same evidence to show it
was the United States’ responsibility, whether or not the
United States is a party?
MR. MARTIN:
that they could.

-

Again 1 say, I think it’s possible

Of course we would not be a party to the

suit, so they -QUESTION:

Well, what reason would they put any

less evidence in?
MR. MARTIN:

Well, first of all, they might settle

the suit.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s not — that can always

happen in any lawsuit.
MR. MARTIN:

Sure.

37
QUESTION:
to go to trial.

But I think we have to assume it's going

And if it goes to trial, then it seems to

me the evidence will be precisely the same whether you’re
a party or not.
MR. MARTIN:

I think that it could be.

Let me

say this, Justice Stevens: X think Congress’ determination,
which this Court found in Peres, was a general determination'
to avoid this kind of action as much as possible.

As

the — what we’re saying, really, is that Stencel can now
bring a suit that would undermine some of the Feres
rationale in precluding DonhaiVs suit.

And it would -

undermine some of the rationale in precluding Stencel's
suit against the United States.
But I think Congress, in establishing the rule which
we think should be unitary as to servicemen and third
parties, was looking to the broad scope of things and
saying

that in general we do not want to encourage people —*

third parties, as to whom — against whom suits are brought —
to join the United States in every case, and to engag e in
an adversary litigation against the United States.
I think Congress was looking to that broad, policy
and it applies here.
QUESTION:

In the suit which Donham brings — will

of the evidence?

QUESTION:

MR. MARTIN;
QUESTION:

No necessary common ground.
— between the proof that would be

in the Donham against the United States if the Peres
case didn't block it, and Donham against the United
States.

Mo one will be concerned in that case about the

negligence of the United States on the plaintiff’s side,
will they?
MR. MARTIN:

Not necessarily.

It’s only a

possibility.
QUESTION;

Well, would it be relevant at all?

MR. MARTIN:

Not in terms of the plaintiff's side,

not at all.
QUESTION;

But you can have factual variations

all over the lot, can't you, in this type of case, where
you’ve got a clearly injured plaintiff and he’s looking for
as many solvent defendants as he can to sue to allege some
claim of negligence against every conceivable person who
he can keep in court.

So that just because your particular

39

factual variant may be quite different from any case that
might he brought against the United States doesn’t mean
that the next case will have that —- will be equally
far distant from it.
HR. MARTIN:

That’s correct.

But again I say,

these are criticisms that really apply to Feres v. the United
States.

In Feres, the Court made a general determination

that Congress intended generally to include these kinds of
litigation.
Now Donhara5 s suit against Sfcencel will in some
way implicate those asme concerns.

But I don’t think that

undermines Congress’ intent, 'which this Court found in Feres,
and which the Congress has sustained.
It would be somewhat bizarre, I would say, to allow
one rule with respect to Captain Donham, that he can’t bring
the suit because it might involve a litigation process
concerning the military, and then let Steneel do the exact
same thing.

As the Court of Appeals said, it would be

simply anomalous to preclude th e serviceman from getting
his recovery for his injury, and then allow a third party
to have that exact same recovery.
QUESTION:

And I suppose your answer would be, if

someone were to make what all of us, I take it, would be
an extreme argument, that Congress’ fear of litigating
military orders was so strong that it actually intended to

40

imply an exception to diversity jurisdiction, so that
a federal court was to be prohibited from entertaining a
suit by Don ham against Stencel, your reply to that would
be, you don’t have to go that far.

At least both of these

exceptions come out of the Federal Tort Claims Act.
HR. MARTIN:

That’s exactly right.

We’re only

talkin g about the Federal Tort Claims Act.
I’d like to speak for a moment about the proprietary;,
the fairness , of applying the Feres rule to a third-party
government contractor.
Now in Fares * and subsequently in United States v.
Demko, this Court found the presence of a compensation
scheme to be an important indicator of Congress5 intent to
preclude tort remedies.

Compensation statutes are almost

always thought of as substitutes for common law tort remedy
by the injured party.
But another function of a compensation scheme is
to limit the liability arising out of a particular activity.
The language of this Court in Cooper Stevedoring v. Kopke
provides a kind of protective mantle for the employer.
Now, like workmen’s compensation, veterans'
compensation laws provide sure compensation to the injured
party and a limited liability for the United States.
this protective function is especially important here,
because this is an enormously dangerous business of

And

41
training and transporting military personnel.
/

The

compensation cheme we think really represents a Congressional
balancing of the necessity to limit costs, bat the duty and
the responsibility to perform — to provide some reparation,
an adequate reparation, for these serviceman.
Now that protective function, that balancing of
Congress, would be just as frustrated by an indirect recovery
by way of

indemnity as it. would be

by a direct recovery.

We think it not likely that Congress intended that the liability
of the United States would: be measured by the compensation
scheme plus whatever additional amount

might be passed

through some third-party manufacturer.
The fact that the scheme would be equally violated
by direct or indirect recovery suggests to us that the fact
that the petitioner is not a serviceman doesn’t make any
difference for the Feres result.
Now, petitioner argues that enforcing immunity
against a party not governed by a compensationscheme is
unfair.

But this Court and other courts have enforced

protection -- the protective mantle of a compensation
scheme — against third parties, to protect what again
Cooper Stevedoring called a result inconsistent with the
balance struck by Congress.
The commercial setting here, of course, we think
especially eliminates any sort of unfairmess claim.

This

a commercial business risk.

But if it is, that’s

And it could have allocated

some part of its price to the purchase of insurance, or to
self insurance.

It may in fact have done so.

So we think that to preclude tort indemnity here
merely means that those kinds of risks that Stencel is
talking about will continue to be resolved through the
contract price or other contract terms, rather than through
the kind of litigation that Congress intended to preclude.
STencel has talked about the reverse situation, the
unfairness of recovery against — that the United States
\

V

could bring some action for recovery against Stencel.

As

Stencel realises, the only action that the United States
\

can bring is for recovery of medical costs under Section
2651 of 42 U.S.C.
It's important to note that this is de minimus
matter.

We're only talking in that statute about medical

costs, only medical costs prior to discharge, VA medical
costs cannot be recovered under that statute, under 2651(c)

And let me

note that the Air Force's policy is not to — not to
recover even medical costs against a government contractor
when the liability of that contractor is based upon a
products liability or non-negligence theory.
Bo we think that the medical cost recovery is
just simply too de minimus and hypothetical to upset the
balance of fairness here.
I!d like to turn to the third point, the limited

45
action to determine whether, in fact, this action merits,
in some way, a congressional immunity.
It's notable that all parties to this litigation
seem to recognize that suits will have an important impact
on federal interest.

In other words, Stencel's claim

really is, in its reply brief, that the advantages of
deterrence will somehow outweigh the disadvantages of an
impact upon the compensation scheme and military discipline.
But that's really a policy kind of decision which we think
should be reserved to Congress.
We think the situation is like United States
v. Gilman.

If you’ll remember in that case, the United

States brought to bring an indemnity action against one
of its government employees.

And the Court said, well,

that kind of action will have results on the relationship
between the government and its employees? it will have
results with respect to fiscal policy.

But it’s very

difficult for a court to determine exactly what those
impacts will be.
And the Court denied a cause of action for indemnity
in favor of the United States.
Here we think we have the reverse situation.
*

Petitioner seeks to bring «a cause of action.

It’s going to

have an impact on fiscal policy, on the compensation scheme,
on the military discipline.

It8s difficult to say precisely

46

what all the impact will be, what all the variations will
be.

But this is really a policy weighing judgment.
If Congress wants to change the rule of Feres and

permit the United States to have liability for injuries
to servicemen, Congress can do it.

But we think this is

not an appropriate kind of rule change for the Court to
make, at least under the teaching of United States v.
Gilman.
I'd like to turn briefly to the alternative
ground for affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal,
aground that does not rest on the military context at all.
A number of courts of appeals have held that
neither indemnity or contribution will be permitted in the
absence of liability running from the United States to the
injured party.
This is the result which was reached by a majority
of the state courts in workmen's compensation schemes.
But where the direct claim of the injured party
is barred by federal law, we think and the courts have said
that the implications of that bar for indemnity or contribution
should also be decided as a matter of federal law.
Now this federal rule of indemnity

would preclude

indemnity here, because the United States is not liable
to the injured party itself.
We believe that this rule is & proper one.

It’s

47
consistent with the purpose of indemnity, because it -indemnity really shifts costs among liable parties.

If

the United States is not liable, no shifting should occur.
It also insures that fcheCourts will not permit a
third-party recovery under an indemnity theory to override
or undermine a Congressional decision to impose a sovereign
immunity bar.

And of course it makes fundamental good sense

here, where recovery would impact on important federal
interests.
QUESTION:

The problem is that the Tort Claims Act

incorporates by reference the state law.
MR. MARTIN:
QUESTION:

That's —
You had a very interesting argument,

but you’re met with that language of the statute, aren't
you?
MR. MARTIN:

I agree.

can see, that where a federal law has barred

a direct

claim of an injured party that the implications of that for
indemnity should be decided by looking at state workmen's

compensation decisions.

That just hardly makes sense.

have required that the matter be decided at the

QUESTION:

Well, the only reason Stencel can sue

you at all is by virtue of the waiver of immunity contained
in the Federal Tort Claims Act, which clearly says — which
clearly makes the United States liable if a private person
