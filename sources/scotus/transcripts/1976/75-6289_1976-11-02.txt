MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 75-6289, Moore v. City of East Cleveland.
Mr. Stage, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD R. STEGE, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. STEGE;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Courts
This is an appeal from a criminal conviction of Mrs.
Inez Moore, in tfca East Cleveland, Ohio Municipal Court.

Mrs.

Moore is a grandmother and she was convicted under a city
ordinance for living in her own horns with her own two sons and
her two grandsons.

She appealed her conviction to the Cuyahoga

County Court of Appeals, which affirmed, on© judge dissenting.
Her conviction was further appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court,
which dismissed the appeal for want of a substantial constitu­
tional question, and the case was further appealed her®.
QUESTION;

Has she had to serve any of that prison

sentence?
MR. STEGEs
QUESTION:

Pardon?

I'm sorry?

Has she had to serve any of that five-day

prison sentence?
MR. STEGE:

She has not.

That five-day prison sen-

taste© was suspended on the condition that she, by July 1? 1974,
which was roughly 45 days after tha conviction was handed down,

4
that she put her grandson, John, Jr., out of her home.

She has

failed to do that, pending the appeal of this Court.
It is the appellant’s position in this cas© that th©
East Cleveland ordinance which prevents many family members
from living together with their families in th© City of East
Cleveland substantially interferes with fundamental rights, privacy and association in matters of family life.

This ordin­

ance is both ever -broad and violative of the equal protection
claus© of the Fourteenth Amendment.
And tli© justifications offered by th© city in support
of this ordinance simply do not support this substantial inter­
ference with constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that there is an over-

breadth test applicable when you get outside of the area of
the First Amendment?
MR. STSGE:
QUESTION:
MR. STEGE:

That is correct.
Well, what do you rely on for that?
Well, I em suggesting that all the cases,

for example, such as Roe v* Wade, the abortion decisions, when
a state passes a statute that interferes — and I think th®
Danforth case of last term — which interferes too seriously
with the fundamental right, such as in that css©, th© right of
privacy, th© right to control, the decision to terminate one’s
pregnancy, that in a sens© th© statute interferes too deeply
with that fundamental right.

It is truly over-broad.

The =term

5
over-broad —
QUESTION:

Well, it is one thing to say that th©

statute» violates th© right is. questio», and therefor© it can't
stand? it is another thing to sayf as I think of th© term overbreadth to mean, that it covers arenas that it shouldn't cover'
so that ©van though it doesn't violata any right in this case,

we are not going to let it apply because it may infringe on
rights in other cases.
MR. STEGE:

QUESTIONS

Which moaning do you adopt?
The former, Your Honor.

i take it the fundamental! right you ar©

talking about or perhaps embraced in that is th® right for a
person to give a home to a near~r@lat.ive who is in need, that

is the grandchildren her© who —
MR. STEGEs
QUESTIOH e
MR. STEGE:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Where do you placa that fundamental right?
Well —
You seam to rule out the First Amendment

rather quickly.
MR. STEGEs

It. was not my intention, Mr. Chief Justice.,

to rule out. the First Amendment.
QUESTION:

Would that be broad enough, right of

association, if you can find that in th© First Amendment in

this contest, would that be broad enough to reach having a
grandmother give a home to her* grandchildren?
MR. STEGE:

I think so.

I think that the fundamental

6
right here does hot arise from any ©us single point in the
Constitution; it arises from several different influences in
the Constitution*

First of all, it arises, from the line of

cases beginning with Skinner v. Oklahoma, which discuss end
afford protection to the right to procreate, the right to
create a family, the right to determine the extent, of one's
own family.

That is on© clearly defined source of constitu­

tional protection.
A second line of cases is that line beginning with
Meyer v. Nebraska, and continuing on through the Yoder case,
the Amish school education case, which gives parents and gives
persons within the family hh© rights to control the very up­
bringing of tha members of the family, particularly the minor
children, to make decisions about the rearing of those children,
the secular, the moral education of those children.
Thirdly, vm have the associational interests involved,
which have bean recognized most specifically in the marital
context in Griswold and in Eisanstadt, which I also think extend
to the relationships among family members.
QUESTION:

When you say family members, how broad

does that term sweep?
MR. STEGE:

It sweeps — it encompasses ties of blood,

marriage and adoption.
QUESTION:
MR. STEGS:

So it. would include presumably cousins?
It would include cousins, yes.

7
■ QUESTION:

Suppes® this ordinance merely said 'that

anyone sot related within the third degree shall not be regarded
as a member of the family, do you think this would b© valid,
just that?
MR. STEGE2

I think that that begins to approach an

area in which the legislative body might step in and determine
a cut-off point, but the purpose of the cut-off point is com­
pletely different.

It is just simply a matter to resolve

controversies, it is a. matter to decide perhaps — perhaps the
third cousin' is too close, but parhaps th® fourth and —QUESTION:

I take it you aren’t, conceding there is a

cut-off point?
MR. STEGE:

I am conceding that there could be a cut­

off point but for a very different purpose than this ordinance
is designed.

The purpose would only be to determine at what

very attenuated point in th© family blood lines do family
members who are related to th© 32rd degree, let’s say, stand
in effect as strangers to one another.

That would be the sol©

function of that, kind of limitation.
I would emphasize that 1 don’t think that that kind
of example has a lot of practical significance for a city like
East Cleveland.

Those problems simply do not coma up.

For

example, in the Bell© Terr© case, the ordinance there said
family members related by blood, marriage or adoption.

QUESTION:

To continue the question of Brother

Blaafcnun» if a family decided, well, we are going to be a
tribal organization ia our particular family, the Jones family,
the Smith family, whatever, we are going to be tribal rather
than think of ourselves as organized in a nuclear family or
anything close t© it, that the state would be constitutionally
required to recognize that?
MR. STEGE:

Well, I am not sure, to be honest about

it, I am not sure what you ar© getting at by th© term "tribal
family.n
QUESTION:

Well, anybody related at all, like most of

the population of the hills of Kentucky, for example.

MR. STEGE;

It seems to me that — well, using that

example, the answeris clearly no, and my response to that, is —
QUESTIONS

Well? why, if they asserted that, this is

the kind of family :m want to belong to and these are the asso­
ciations we are constitutionally entitled to maintain, and the
state of Ohio and the City of East Cleveland has no constitu­
tional right to invade our constitutional right of association
as a tribal organisation?
MR, STEGEs

My response is that if we examine th©

prior decisions of the Court, they build on blood relationships.
QUESTION?

Well, is there anything in the Constitution

about that?
MR, STEGEs

There is nothing specifically in th©

Constitution? on th® other hand, there is nothing specifically
in th© Constitution that creates a fundamental right of a
parent to raise his child, but yet it has been recognized? and
there is nothing specifically in the Constitution that talks
about procreation, yet it has been recognized.

And I focus on

certain areas of decisions and identified three of them, and
th® third I think relates to protection that has bean accorded
to th© family home, and from that w© assert a right to privacy
and freedom of association in matters of family life.
What good is it to have a right to control the up­
bringing of your child if you can't even live with that child?

Yes, that's correct.

QUESTION:

In the family home.

Is. the family heme.

But th© application of this statute, of

this ordinance has what effect upon the father living with his
children in the home of Idle grandmother?

It cuts across that,

does it net?
MR. STSGE:

The application of the statute by its

terms should preclude the father as well from living in the
home, but, as a matter of fact, John Moore, Jr., who is now
age 10, was 7 at the time of the prosecution, was single! out
as the "illegal occupant in the heme."
being asked to leave.

He is the on© who is

It was based on his presence in the

home that Mrs. Moor© was found guilty.
QUESTIONE

Have you and your opposition bean able to

get together as to where John Moor®, Sr. lived?
homa or was h@ not in the home?

Was h® in the

As I read your briefs, you are

at opposite poles on this.
MR. STEGE;

John Moore, Sr. was in the home at the

time of trial, he is in the home now, and he has been there
over since the trial.

The family — th© composition of the

family horns at th© time of trial was Mrs. Moor®, har two sons,

11
John,, Sr. and John, Jr..» and their two respective sons ~ I'm
sorry? the two sons? John?

Sr. and Dale? Sr.? and their two

respective sons? John? Jr* and Dal©? Jr.

Now? that family

composition has remained intact in exactly the same way? those
family members have continued to live in the horn® to this date.
QUESTION:

This is an awfully small point? but is

there any reason why John, Jr. rather than Dale? Jr. is the
villain in the picture?
MR. STEGE:
QUESTION?

It is beyond me.

I cannot explain that.

Did the judge express why?
*

MR. STEGEs

I did not try the case below*

The

Housing Code singled out John? Jr.? as I say? the notice of
violation —
QUESTION?

Does it have to do with schools or some­

thing? is it suggested in the record?
MR. STEGE?

There was a coincidence time-wise? a

peculiar coincidence? time-wise? with John? Jr.'s entry into
the first grade.
QUESTION:
MR. STEGE:

All right.
I would emphasize that this ordinance

interferes in the most substantial and direct way with matters

of family life.

For example? it applies to all dwelling units

in the entire City of Es

•. Cleveland? Ohio.

It applies to

single "family units? it applies to two-family units and
multiple dwelling units.

There is no place in the entire city

12
of East Cleveland that. Mrs. Moors can lives together with her
family.
QUESTION?
MR. STEGE;

Even ar- apartment?
Even an aparlxient.

East Cleveland is a

city of roughly 40,000 people, and it is encompassed within
about a three square-mile area.
severe as well.

And the criminal sanctions are

It is six months in jail for every day that a

violation is a11owed to continue.
QUESTION:

Do you think the City of East Cleveland

could pass an ordinance that said there shall be no more than
three people per room permanently residing in any singlefamily dwelling?
MR. STEGE:
in those terms.

In a sense it has don© ‘that, although not

It has passed two ordinances, one which keys —

it sets" an occupancy limit.
QUESTION:
MR. STEGE:
QUESTION:

For example, based on —

Do you think it. can?
Yes, I do.

The answer is yes.

Such an ordinance though would certainly

have a fairly sharp impact on even a nuclear family, wouldn't
it, that wanted to have a lot of children?
MR. STEGE:

It could conceivably have an impact, al­

though that is clearly not the purpose of the ordinance.

Tha

purpose — I think that as in the — let m® us© th© example

of the ordinance that East Cleveland has already passed.

They

determined in a mathematical way how many people ought to live

13
in how many squar©~f@et of space* hot-? many are required to
support an individual, two individuals* &t cetera.
QUESTION;
MR. STEGE;

Well* would that ba valid?
Yes* I believe that is valid.

In this

case* for example* Mrs. Moor© is entitled by virtue of the
square footage in bar home and by virtue of the number of
bedrooms to have seven people there* and she has always had
less than- seven in her hone.

And it seems to me that that kind

of ordinance has the very precision that this ordinance lacks.
‘Hi® problem that that ordinance is addressing is a problem of
density.
QUESTION;

But couldn't you attack that ordinance on

■the grounds that it could conceivably interfere with the de­
cision as to a nuclear family, mother, familyf children, who
wanted to have a lot of children, and say instead of passing
that kind of an ordinance, the ought to pass the kind of an
ordinance that you are attacking here.

It doesn’t have any

effect on the nuclear family but just cuts it off at the nuclear
family.
MR. SIEGE;

it seems to me that what the Court

focuses on — and this is particularly true in the First amend­
ment over-breadth cases, but I think it should be equally true
here —- is on the substantiality and the degree of impact that
the ordinance has on the particular fundamental right involved,
and that ordinance would have a very minimal impact generally

14
speaking on families, if it is properly tailored.

If indeed

the legislature sits down, as the legislative body did, for
example,, in Young v. American Mini Theaters, and decides that
•this particular measure is keyed to the problem, the impact on
familias would ba very incidental and would be slight.

I

concede that in a particular situation there might ba a rather
severe impact, but that overall it would ba minimal.

AM I

think that the ether key distinguishing factor between that
kind of an ordinance and this ordinance is its very precision.
There is nothing precise about this ordinance.

If

this is an anti-overcrowding ordinance, where is the relation­

that

parent.

Now, that sub-sat might have, several children, where­

as the next sub-set, the married adult child who is separated
from his wife returns to the home, that child is automatically

exit.

There is so precision, there is no logical relationship

batween this particular ordinance and the control of density.
I think the relaiicnship, if it exists, is purely accidental,
and I think that is the distinction between the two kinds of
ordinances.

And I would emphasise that East Cleveland has on

the books her© a par-person occupancy limit .ordinance —

QUESTION:

Well, I assume that a seven-year ■-old child

MR. STEGE:

Wall, I think if John Moor©, Jr. is forced

to leave# I think his father will go with him.
QUESTION:
MR. STEGE:

And he then goes on relief, huh?
And then what happens?

Then the relation­

ship between the grandmother and her own son is disrupted and
severed.
QUESTION:

Well, there is nothing in the record that

shows that h© has an independent income, is there?
MR. STEGE:
QUESTION:

That is correct,
Thera is nothing about income at all# is

there?
MR. STEGE:

About income, either way.

QUESTION:

That is what I mean.

QUESTION:

Wall, would that be relevant to tills issue

here?
MR. STEGE:

I don't believe it would foe.

It is only

relevant, insofar as the statute is applied to — insofar as the

16
dependency question is involved in the application of the
statute.
QUESTION:

Do you mean that if they don’t have any

money at all, the child can be -thrown out in the street?

Is

that correct?
£&. STEGE:

That is absolutely correct in this instance.

Let ma emphasise that the application of this ordinance hare
would not only severe and disrupt the relationship between Mrs.
Moore and her own so a, but it would disrupt the relationship
that is established between young John and young Dale, which
is in essence a sibling type relationship, and it would most
importantly disrupt the relationship between young John and
his grandmother, which is the only maternal influence that he
has had during his entire life.

So the interference here, to

go bach to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question, is very substan­
tial.
QUESTION:

On that argument, would the case be any

different if the grandfather had, say, had his first wife die
and remarried someone who was not actually the maternal grandmother but yet brought up the children?
different case?

Would it, be really a

Does it really depend on the blood relation­

ship or ju.st the fact that these five individuals happen to
live together?
MR. STEGE:

I think that there is something perhaps

sacred as going too far, something very, very significant, in

17
our society and in history about blood ties, the notion of
kinship, th© notion of son©times it is a religious sort of
obligation to look out for your own kin, that is what is at
work her©.
QUESTION:

So you would say that would b© a different

cars, in other words?
MR. ST EG E:

Yes, I would.

I can see that in a given

situation the reality of that situation might approximate the
same kinds of blood relationship, but it truly is different,
and I am nut asking this Court to reach that point.
QUESTION:

Rail, would it be different if John, Sr.

was the adopted son of the grandmother and John, Jr. was in
turn th© adopted son of John, Sr.?

I am puzzled by why you

put so much cm the blood relationship, once the legal relation**
ship is established?
MR. SIEGE:

I'm sorry.

By emphasizing the blood ties,

I did not mean to exclude ties of marriage and ties of adoption.
QUESTION:

Adopted children, for almost ©very purpose

that I can conceive of, are treated th® same as natural issue,
are they not?
MR. STEGE:

Exactly, and there is very clear state

policy along those lines, and it is — if this ordinance were
tailored the way th© Ball© Terre ordinance was tailored,
obviously we would not be here, but also I would hav© no constitutional objections to that ordinance.

It says all persons

IS
related by blood f adoption or marriage , and than it is up to
the family members to decide within their family how they want
to live.

Lnd to prevent the over-crowding, you say

QUESTIONS

that the municipality may put a density, a space requirement

on, and that that you would accept because presumably it re­
lates to health and safety?
MR. SIEGE2

Yes.

And is. fact such a space require­

ment has been passed in this case, it is quoted in part on page
three of appellant’s brief.
QUESTIONS

Counsel, does this ordinance have any pro-

vision for individual variances?

Is there any procedure by

which you could have applied on behalf of the family for a
tolerance of some kind?
MR. STE6E:

Yes, there is a procedure within ten days

aft .r a citation by the housing code official., there is a right
to appeal for a variance.

And the standards that I would

emphasise —
QUESTION?

Does the record show whether that was done

in this case?
MR. SIEGE?

The record doss not show either way, but

the fact is that, no appeal was taken.
ticular
appellee's brief.

I would emphasize that

phasize is reproduced in the appendix to the
I would emphasize that, as a matter of fact,

in the appellee’s brief there is qustatement that had — and I

19
am quoting — "has Mrs. Moor® sought: a variance#" it "probably”
would have beau granted "possibly with some stipulations.”

And

I think that those three qualifiers Jus the statement by the
appellee are borne out by ah examination of. the particular
variance provision.
The provision permits variances provided that th®
granting of the variance will not be inconsistent with the
overall purposes of th© ordinance in question.

It seems to me

that it is vary difficult to expect. East' Cleveland# on th® on®
hand, to grant a variance for Mrs. Moore if it is saying that
th® presence of John Moore# Jr. in the kcme is in fact incon­
sistent with the vary purpose ©f the legislation.
QUESTION:

I don’t follow that.

Any variance# by

definition, assumes fch~-va is a violation of th© literal general
application of the ord er mea, doesn't it?
MR. STEGE;

But there is also a provision in the

variance section that provides that if it is to be grant®!# it
must be granted on th© condition that it is consistent with the
overall purposes of the ordinance, and I think what East
Cleveland doss in granting these things is they give you an
extension of six months or a year and then you have to leave.
We will give you a variance but we will give it to you tempo­
rarily for six months or a year and then you have to go.

I

would emphasize —
QUESTION:

Does th© record support that or is this of

20
a •—
MR. ST EGE;

That Is not in the record.

That is based

on my own examination of the minutes of the appellate review
us.it, that makes these decisions.

I would emphasize that it is

correct; Mrs. Moor© did not seek a variance in this case.

We

contend that that is constitutionally irrelevant.
In essence» the appellee’s argument is that there
was some requirement of exhaustion of the administrative
avenue her©» and it is our position that in a criminal case
it is not a precondition to assarting a defense based on the
unconstitutionality of the ordinance 'that one need to have ex­
hausted a variance or an administrative appellat® procedure.
QUESTI OH:

is there a legislative his-tor y which tells

us the pvrpc.v* of this ordinance?
MR. STEGE;

There is a legislative history» but it

does not illuminate the purposes of this ordinance.
ordinance was passed in 1961.

This

Its precedecessor was passed in

1961» at the time the Housing Cod© was adopted for the City ©f
East Cleveland,

had what the appellee has don© in its brief

is cite the prefatory language to that Housing Cod©, which
talks about upgrading property, control of density» and there
is no provision that zeroes in on by way of explanation of
this particular provision.
QUESTION;

la addition to -the specific density ordin­

ance» this also has a purpose related to density?

21
MR. STEGE:

That, is th© position as I understand it

of the appella©.
QUESTION:

I think you told us they have the seven-

house -- or the house? in any event, could within the density
ordinance accommodat© seven people, is that right?
MR.

STEGE;

QUESTION;
MR. STEGE:
QUESTION:
MR. STEGE;
QUESTION:

That's correct.
And with only six kids?
Five.
Five.
Yes.
I was wondering, is there any law in Ohio

•that says if you are charged with violation of the zoning cod®,
you cannot after that time be given a variance?

Does that pre­

vent you from getting it?
MR. STEGE:

Well, by the terms of the variance of the

'ordinance, you must file an appeal within ten days.
QUESTION:

MR. STEGE:

From th© time -Frau th® time the citation -- the cita­

tion occurred in January “73, roughly a year or so prior to
th© prosecution.
QUESTION:

MR. STEGE:

I see.
I would point out, in further response to

Hr. Justice Stevens' question, that in

Stabb v. City of

Bax lay, 3 55 U.S. 313, this Court considered the question of
whether — reached the constitutional validity of an ordinance,

22

a municipal ordinance that precluded persons from engaging in
certain kinds of organizing activity without first seeking a
permit., and the fact was that th® individual who challenged the
ordinance did not seek a permit in that instance,, and this
Court addressed th© very specific question of whether or not
•«di© individual somehow lost his right to raise the question
before this Court by failure to seek a permit* and th© Court
rejected that position.
QUESTION:

But wasn't the holding in Stabb that th©

very statute that required the permit was bad?
MR. STEGE:

That is correct, but that was not material

to th® exhaustion argument.

The exhaustion argument was that,

look, this whole cases could have been avoided if you simply
would have sought a permit and it might have been granted, and
that point was specifically addressed by the Court and was
rejected.
In fact, th© very language of standing, somehow the
appellant had no standing in th© cas© is adopted by the
appellee in his brief.
QUESTION:

In short,, if the municipality has no

authority to put this kind of a limitation based on other than
density, than the variance falls in th© same category?
MR. STEGE;

Exactly.

At this time I would just like to conclude by saying
that this Court

is presented with an ordinance which on the

23

one hand exhibits no rational, methodology whatsoever, but on
the other cuts ever so deeply into the fabric of family life.
We urge that Mrs. Moore’s conviction be reversed and that she
fas allowed to live together with her sons and grandsons in
East Cleveland, unmolested by this ordinance.
I would like to reserve my remaining few minutes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

Mr. Young.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD YOUNG , ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. YOUNG;

Mr. chief Justice and may it pleas© the

Court;
At this time, the appellee would like to point out
that with respect to John Moore, Sr., the housing code file of
the City of East Cleveland shows that at the time the citation
was made, John Moore, Sr. was living on Central Avenue in the
City of Cleveland, he was not living on the premises in ques­
tion .
Further, we would like to point out again from the
appendix of appellee’s brief that the initial citation occurred
in January 1973.

From that point until April 1974, the Housing

Department of the City of East Cleveland worked with the
appellant in trying to resolve this question of occupancy.
wasn't until April ,1974 that the citation was — that, the
matter was taken to court.

It

QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

—■ get a variance or what?
Your Honor, the procedure with respect to

cod© citations are to notify th© party involved, either ask him
to call the; Housing Department or set up conferences with him,
to find out. what can fca don© to correct the situation, includ­
ing conferences.

There is nothing in the record, but I can

only make this point, in the usual situation like this, the
housing inspector, if there is a possibility of a variance,
would make a verbal response to the person involved in that
situation.

But. again, there is nothing in the record to re­

flect that;

I couldn't find anything in the record of the

housing coda.
QUESTION:

Wall, I am a little puzzled yet.

What

solution could they work out?
MR. YOUNG:
Honor.

All right.

If I may go to that, Your

Whan you look at, this situation, you have to look at

the entire housing cods.

One of th© things that I focus on at

this point is that under th© housing cod© there is this
appellate rout®.

They are, for example —- and I take exception

with regard to hardships.

With regards to a variance, a show­

ing of hardship is made, if it. can be don© with harmony with
the ordinance, that is to maintain the safety, the welfare of

25
the community, variances are granted.

In -this situation, the

record doss not reflect and to my knowledge there was no show­
ing of any need or any hardship as to why the grandson should
remain on the premises.

And again, I go back.

If these

arguments made on bshalf of th© appellant ware made by John
Moor®, Sr. , involving personal rights, I think you have, a dif­
ferent situation,

But her© you have the appellant, a grand­

mother, making these arguments of personal rights which there
is no guardianship, no adoption on h©r part of John Moore, Jr.,
therefore these are the types of things that John Moore, Sr.,
as th© natural parent, has th© right to determine.

QUESTIONs

Mr. Young, why John, Jr. and not Dale, Jr.?

MR. YOUNG;
again to th®

Thank you, Mr. Brennan.

citationf

If we go back

I mean the ordinance in question, the

normal head of th® household — in this case it would be th©
appellant, sfe© is listed as th® owner of the premises — can
have on© unmarried child with her.

Also in th© situation,

sine® he had a son, Dale, Sr. was there, and Dais, Jr. was
there.

In looking at th© total situation, the premises could

accommodate th© three individuals.

Th© Housing Department

would not give a citation on that type of situation.
When you bring in John, Jr,-, who is there at that
point, you have exhausted the ordinance which allows the un­
married son to be there, you are bringing in another family.
In addition to that —

Possibly he is.

But

As far as we can

Now, in addition to

this, John, Jr. was in the process, as counsel for the
appellant has pointed out, of starting to school.

One of the

things in the public school system of East Cleveland, there
must b@ soma person or parent, a person who stands in the posi­
tion of the parent to whom th© school can look to if there is a
need, for example, th© child is injured, a need to give consent
for treatment.

Without -th© appellant having a guardianship,

this meant that they couldn't -turn to that.
QUESTION:
MR, YOUNG:

A grandparent couldn't do that?
Unless she is a parent.
As a grandparent, I would like to think

that I could.
MR. YOUNG:

QUESTION:

Wall, this woman stands convicted of some­

thing, and I want you to tall me what she is convicted of.
MR. YOUNG:

She is convicted, Your Honor, of — th©

conviction is for having more than one family in the promises
in question.
QUESTION:

And who is that “more than one family" as

to parson?
MR, YOUNG:

As to person at the time of the citation

would be John Moor®, Jr.

As of now, sine© then, apparently

John Moor©, Sr. is there, it would be John Moore, Sr. and John
Moore, Jr.
QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

Well, as of the time of conviction?
As of the time of conviction, based upon

the stipulation by the appal lent, John Moor®, Sr. was there
also, so it would be the two of them.
QUESTION:
MR. YOUNG:

QUESTION;
MR. YOUNG;

At th© trial in question, I was present.

Department.
QUESTION;
MR. YOUNG:
QUESTION;

Well, is it in tha record in this case?
No, it was not., Your Honor.
I am not interested — I am interested in

th® record.
MR. YOUNG:

I understand.

30

QUESTION;

And so far the record is concerned? this

young child could go on horns relief or welfare or something?
MR. YOUNGs

Ho? Your Honor,

I would like to expand

on the question that was raised when the appellant was present.
At this point, I se@ the

at this point in time, and even

after the conviction, for the appellant to make application for
a variance.

I think that question was raised, and I would have

to submit that it is possible, even after th© conviction, for
the application for a variance to be made.
QUESTION:

Of course, on this constitutional claim

your friend's position is that th© municipality has no right to
require them to ask fcr a variance, his right exists independent
of that.
MR. YOUNG:

I might address myself to that.

First of

all, with regards to the fundamental rights issue, if w@ look
at all of those cases dealing with that matter, if we look very
closely at dealing with personal rights, th© right, for example,
of a person to vote, this is personal, the right of th® female
to determine whether she would procreat© ■— again, personal
rights.

Thera is no law that counsel knows of in th© State of

Ohio that gives a grandmother a personal right to decide that
her grandson can live with her.
QUESTION:

What is th© right of. association, is that

MR. YOUNG;

The right of association, in th© line of

personal?

31
cases dealing there, again I would focus on the point that they
deal primarily with relationship between what we call the
nuclear familys again personal rights, the right to associat©
in this respect, the appellant is not being refrained from
allowing her son or grandson to stay on weekends or even if she
under the two systems I suggested, hardship or guardianship,
to actually assume full responsibility for him.
1 might point out that under the equal protection
argument that is suggested by counsel, that in equal protection
situations, the ordinance in question must be of a suspect,
character.

There hasn’t even baen any argument to this affect

raised in the briefs in this instance.
The procedural du® process, the ■— no proper notice
was given, conferences vara held

MR. YOUNGs

All right,

with regards to the stata in­

terests , Your. Honor, we are talking here ©£ overcrowding con\

d it ions,

That is only on®.

There is the problem of traffic,

tax burdens with respect to not only the city services '—
QUESTION?

Doesn't the density provision take car© of

the overcrowded aspect, the health conditions?
QUESTION;

You have a separat® ordinance on density,

don’t, you?
MR. YOUNG:

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

The ordinance

with respect to square-footage and density partly covers the
problem.

If I may go back for a moment, the ordinance sequence

was passed initially in 19SI defining “family.”

It was rede­

It would appear that the legislative body at

that point found that they needed something additional, th@ two
ordinances together cooperating or working complementary to"
deal with these throe,actually four problems — overcrowding,
traffic congestion and the tax burden.

So that the safety7 of

the city, the welfare of the city is handled within the income
that tli® city is producing.
QUESTION:

Is there any legislative history that in­

dicatas what the council had in mind when it devised an ordin­
ance that 'prevents a grandmother from living with her children
and grandchildren?
/

MR. YOUNG:

To ray knowledge, Your Honor, there is no

33
legislative history in this respect.
QUESTION s

Thera was i» fact as historical fact, an

abrupt and rather dramatic change in the nature of the popula­
tion ©f East Cleveland, wasn't there, just about the time this
ordinance was passed?
Ml* YOUNG §

’66, that would be the beginning of it,

yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr* Young, is it conceivable that the city

council might have been willing to allow more people per squarefoot in a house if it was a nuclear family than if it was not?
MR. YOUNG:

Yes, certainly, Your Honor*

In fact, the

nuclear family based upon *— would b© the idea or we would sug­
gest, rather, I would suggest that it is the nuclear family that
th© city commissioners had contemplated in passing this ordin­

stances, it would not relate or — if on the proper circumstances
ether members of the family might be allowed to live in a given

Sr. and Dales, Jr. to move out?

MR. YOUNG:

That doesn't stop her from moving out.
No, as long as th© owner I would think it

would be *—
QUESTION:

On your traffic congestion, certainly the

kid didn't have a license, did he?
ME. YOUNG:
ever,

Ycur Honor,

I would agree with that.

How-

I might point out that, based on what has been before th©

Court at this time, you have Dale, Sr. and John Sr., th®
appellant,, who are adults, and there are three automobiles
there.

This is a two-family — at least two adults on the

other side.
QUESTION:

They ar© all legitimate, there is nothing

wrong with that?
MR. YOUNG:

Mien you asked me a question with respect

to traffic, what I am pointing at is that in a home where
there is a two-car garage you might have as many as five auto­
mobiles at this heme, and I am focusing on th© fact, that the
ordinance was aimed at more than just th© question of over­
crowding .

35

QUESTION;

I take it that neither Dale, Sr. nor John,

Sr., if they did not have these two boys. Dal©, Jr. and John,
Jr., there would be no problem, even though the grandmother and
the two sons each hnv® a car?
MR. YOUNG;
QUESTION;

No, I would not —
There would fo© no violation of the ordin­

ance if just the appellant and her two sons lived in the house,
would there?
MR. YOUNG;

You can only have on© married son under .

the ordinance.
QUESTION;

Even though neither had any children?
That is correct.

MR. YOUNG;
QUESTION;

The mother can have only on© of her chil-

dr®a live with heir? is that it?
MR. YOUNG:

She could have — one unmarried son is

considered part, of — may I expand on that — on© unmarried son
considered the family.

The second son, sine© this is

&

two-

family, would bs there as what wa call under the ordinance as
an unlicensed roomer.
QUESTION;

But if they are both unmarried and neither

lias a. child, aren't they all right, can't they stay with their
mother?

As I read the definition of family in 1341,08 —
MR. YOUNG;

I'm sorry, you ar© correct in that, the

unmarrled children.
QUESTION:

If neither Dale, Jr. nor John, Jr. had

36
been born, and John, Sr. and Dale, Sr. lived with their mother,
and each had an automobile, -there would be no violation of the

ordinance notwithstanding the traffic problem that created,

MR. YOUNGs

I would have to., under that factual

situation —
QUESTION:

So it is only because these two seven-year-

old grandchildren are there, the three automobiles become a
traffic problem?

That doesn't answer Mr. Justice Marshall's

is just a factor, isn't it, it isn't the factor?
MR. YOUNG:

In the instant case it is a factor, it. is

Again, I would lik© to go back with regard to

again th® tax situation, with respect to the income generated
to provide services for th© city, the normal services, fire,
police, and so forth.

If we have an overcrowded condition on

going to reduce the ability of the city to properly provide
services for all of the citizens of the community,
I might point out that with regards to —

MR. YOUNG:

in effect multiplying the situation that you get continued
overcrowded conditions throughout the city of East Cleveland.
QUESTION:

Well, as I understand it then, if there

were nothing but a density problem, there would be no over­
crowding , is that right?
MR. YOUNG;

If there was nothing but a density prob­

lem, possibly.
QUESTION:

In this house there would bs no over­

But new the way it is? the two grandchildren, there

is an overcrowding ? and this somehow increases the cost of

39
MR, YCUMGs

With regards to this, I would hav© to

submit that that is the situation because, again, I have to go
back,

John, Sr, initially was living ©Is©where and, assuming

he was employed, he was paying his taxes to another municipality,
y©fe his son is being educated in the East Cleveland School
District.
In the situation before the Court, the appellant
is challenging the state, interests with respect to the passage
of these ordinances.

However, it is submitted on behalf of the

City of East Cleveland 'that these ordinances — this ordinance,
rather, was passed on the prop®: exercise of the police power
that it is rationally related to the purposes for which it was
enacted, therefore in order to raise the challenge the appellant

Ms the obligation; has the burden to show by clear evidence
that there is an infringement on the appellant.

And I submit

that the record below does not show any evidence on the part of
•the appellant that this is a situation, that the ordinance is
not rationally related to its purpose.
In fact, this is a point that is mentioned by the
Ohio Court of Appeals in affirming the decision of the trial
court.
In summation, the appal lee submits that the issue
before this Court is whether when a city, in proparly passing
a municipal ordinance on this police power in the interests of
the welfare, safety of its community, provides in that

40
provides in that ordinance means by which th© appellant, if it
cut harshly, could hav® gotten a variane©, and th© appellant
does not make an effort to apply to th© appellant rout®, then
the appellant has first of all no standing before this Court?
secondly, sine© there is no record to show that th© appellant
presented clear evidence that there has been an arbitrary —
that this ordinance is arbitrary, the Court should sustain th©
judgment of the Ohio Eighth Appellat District, affirmed by th©
Ohio Supreme Court, and we respectfully submit that this Court
affirm the decision below.
QUESTION:

facts, I don’t know the facts available to -the housing inspector

QUESTION:

But they surely war© when the — at the

MR. YOUNG:

At the trial, Your Honor, at th© time of

the trial, the appellant simply stipulated that thes® fiv© in­
