ORAL ARGUMENT OF A, RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR„, ESQ,,
ON behalf of petitioner

MR. RANDOLPH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
First Circuit,

The issue is whether a search warrant is

required before Federal agents may open a locked trunk or
fcotlocker that they properly seized and that they had
/

probable cause to believe contained contraband.
The -District Court suppressed the 200 pounds of
marijuana found inside the trunk on the Government *s appeal.
The Court of Appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting,
:ts are these:

-g ..

On May 8th, about

four rears ago. May 3/ .1973» Amfcrak officials told. Federal
agents in San Diego that defendants Machado and Leary had
loaded a trunk on a train bound for Boston.

They believed

the trunk contained marijuana for three'reasons.
First of all it was leaking talcum powder, which
is often ’used to cover, the odor of marijuana.

The trunk had

an unusual weight for its size, and Machado's description
tallied with a profile used.by the railroad to stop- drug

4
traffickers,
The Federal agents relayed this information to their
counterparts in Boston.
I should describe the footlocker.
in the record as "old and brown,1'

It is described

According to Ms, Leary's

suppression motion, it was 2 feet, 11 inches wide, 1 foot,
nine inches high, and 1 foot, eight inches deep.
QUESTION:

Dees the record show- the source of origin

of the shipment?

Boston on an Amtrak train.

r.
The latch was locked --QUE oTION:

The baggage was accompanying the owners

of the baggage, wasn't it?
MR, RANDOLPH:

Yes

5
QUESTION:

It was checked baggage»

MRo RANDOLPH:

There were two suitcases, and for

the purposes of this case, we don't think the suitcases are
relevant»

We have not brought an issue to the Court —
QUESTION:

I gathered from reading the brief that

the suitcases were not checked and the footlccker was, by the
owners, traveling on the same Amfcrak train»
MR» RANDOLPH:

The footlccker traveled across the

country in the baggage compartment»

Machado and Leary

traveled across the country in the passenger compartment of
the same train»
The footlocker, as I said, was locked, had a padlock
over it and the latch on it was locked, as well»
QUESTION:

So, it was not a question of sending by

freight a container from one point tc another.

It was baggage

accompanying the travelers»
MR» RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

It accompanied the travelers»

Right.

MR, RANDOLPH:

On the evening of May 10th, two days

later, the train arrived at Boston5s South Station.
agents were there to greet it.

Federal

Within the next 15 to 20

minutes, the following events occurred.
It was 8:50 p.m, in the evening.

The agents saw

Machado and Leary leave the train, claim che trunk, move it
against the wall and sit down on it.

Machado left to make a

telephone call and returned.
The agents had a dog with them trained to recognise
the smell of controlled substances *

The dog went to the foot-»

locker and started scratching on it* which is considered an
alert to the presence of such substances.
QUESTION:

While the men were still sitting on it?

MR„ RANDOLPH:

While Msv Leary and Mr» Machado were

sitting on- the footlocker, the dog approached it and started
scratching.
QUESTION:

Does the record show anything else the

dog (inaudible)
(laughter)
MR» RANDOLPH:

Well, what the record does show is

that a car pulled up outside the train station quite1quickly
thereafter, and in the car was Mr» Chadwick.

He opened the

trunk of the car —- He went into the train station,, talked very
quickly with Mr. Machado and Ms. Leary, went outside and
proceeded to open the trunk of the ear.
With the help of^a porter then Ms. Leary and
Mr. Machado, accompanying the footlocker, took it outside of
the train station to Mr. Chadwick's waiting car.
Defendant Leary sat down in the car while Mr. Chadwick,
Mr.. Machado and the porter lifted the footloeker into the car's
trunk.
When the porter left,"the agents moved in.

All three

defendants were arrested.
open trunk of the car.

The footlocker was seized from the

It is now 9:10 p,m.

The agents testified that they decided not to open
the footlocker on the spot for a number of reasons.
it was dark outside.

The area was dimly lit.

Number one*

Many pedestrians

were passing by* and there was heavy automobile traffic on the
street,
The three defendants and the footlocker were taken
to the agents' office in Boston* about five minutes away from
the train station.

The footlocker was still leaking talcum

powder.
At the office* in the presence of the three
defendants* the agents opened the footlocker.

Inside*, as I

said before* they found 200 pounds of marijuana.
According to Ms, Leary's suppression motion* what
they actually found were 83 packages* each wrapped in blue
paper and sealed with a piece of tape* and those 85 packages
tallied 200 pounds of marijuana.
The next morning -«= This is not in the Appendix the
Court hap

The next morning* the defendants* all three of

them, were arraigned before a magistrate on a complaint and an
affadavit of the arresting agent.

Bail was set.- They were

bound over and later there was an indictment.
The Government* in this ease* wants to introduce that
marijuana* and indeed the footlocker itself* into evidence at

8
defendants® trial.

The defendants oppose this.

They oppose

the introduction of the marijuana on the basis that the agents
should not have opened the footlocker without first getting a
search warrant.
Our brief advances a number of reasons why we think
the opening of the footlocker without a warrant was not an
unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment,
As a preliminary matter* I ought to say* that our
purpose in advancing these arguments is to try to provide a
coherent analysis to guide the decisions in these kinds of
cases o
The Courts of Appeals

and the Court will notice

in my brief — have dealt with this type of situation, moveable
objects found outside the home* in countless cases.

The

results* we think, generally support the Government *s position
in this ease, although the rationales are sometimes difficult
to discern,
I might point out that, in fact, Respondents, in
their brief, did not cite a single lower court decision in
their favor,
*

QUEST 1(31:

How long after the leading of the locker

into the trunk of the car did the officers open it, and
where?
MR* RANDOLPH:

The loading took place at 9:10, which

is the time the arrest took place,

The footlocker was searched,

9
the testimony is* shortly after 9*30. Mr« Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

After they arrived.

MR. RANDOLPH:

After they arrived at the office of

the Federal agents in Boston* five minutes away from, the train
station*
QUESTION:

And the argument of the »- of your

friends •»- is that they should have retained possession while
they proceeded to go and get a warrant,
MR. RANDOLPH:

That's right*

Vie think — I might point out that the factual
patterns in all these cases are endless* of course».

And to

make cur position clear, in this case alone* for example*
after the agents had probable cause, Mr, Machado* for instance*
could have been arrested and the footiocker seized while he
was sitting on it in the train station* or while he was moving;
it out to the car* or while Mr* Chadwick's car was pulling
away with the footiocker in the trunk.
Under our view of the case* a search without a
warrant* in all those situations* would be reasonable under
the Fourth Amendment* not unreasonable.
distinction between those*

And so we draw no

We don't think they are constitu­

tional distinctions.
Let me explain why.

First of all* this is not

strictly a search and seizure case.
It is a seizure and search situation.

The sequence is reversed,
Like the eases dealing

10
with automobiles and unlike cases dealing with homes or houses.,
the seizure came first here, and we think it was a lawful
seizure,

And we don't think there can be any doubt whatever

that the agents had probable cause to believe that the foot»
locker was loaded with contraband.
QUESTION:

Is that a controverted issue in this

case, whether or not there was probable cause to seize the
footlccker?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, in the suppression motion filed

by Mr. Chadwick and joined by Mr. Machado, they sought not only
to suppress the contents of the footlccker but also the footlocker, itself.
QUESTION:

I wondered if, in the present posture of

the case, that's a controverted issue.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, they didn't cross-petition

and the Court of Appeals decided that there was probable cause,
QUESTION:

Well, that's a given in this case, isn't

it, that there was
%

MR. RANDOLPH:

It's a given.

QUESTION: — probable cause to seize the footlocker.
MR. RANDOLPH:

It's a given, as the case is presented

to the Court.
QUESTION:

Tha t' s ray und ers fcand ing. •

MR, RANDOLPH:

Ir fact, the conclusion of the probable

cause to seize the footlccker, obviously, was the very reason

11
for example, for Mr, Machado's arrest.

The two were inter­

twined a
We think it is as clear as can he that the agents
didn't need a warrant ~~ the authority of warrant to take that
footlocker into their possession,

And the reason is the same

as in the automobile cases.
Aside from the fact that the footlocker was ev3.dence
in obvious view, it was moveable.
about its moveabilifcy.

And there can be no doubt

The footlocker had just traversed the

entire continent, you will recall, and it appears that it
still hadn't reached its final destination.
Once that footlocker was in the agent's lawful
possession, our position is that they didn't have to treat it
like a child treats a Christmas package on Christmas eve.
They shake it, and everything, but they couldn't open it.
We believe they could open it.

We believe they could open it

on the spot or we believe it was reasonable for them to open
it back at the station house »» or at the office, as occurred
in this case.
It is at this point in the events that the Respondents
in this case invoke the warrant requirement.
QUESTION:

Did 1 understand you to say that your

friends concede that if the footlocker had been taken while
they were

Respondents were sitting on it, around the time

when the dog Identified it, that that would have been

12
without a warrant?

\

MR. RANDOLPH:

I don111 know what they concede*

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

I got some impression that you intimated

that they concede that.
MR« RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

No* I think that they

Or you said that's when it should have

been seised) that was* perhaps* the way you put it.
MR. RANDOLPH:

I am sorry if I misled the Court.

All I intended to state was that under our* the Government's
position* the validity* under the Fourth Amendment, of the
seizure and search of the footlocker in this case, would be
the same, if it were seized at the time — after probable
cause, while the defendants were sitting on the footlocker.
QUESTION:

0?he issue in this case involves the

sesx-ch of the foot — the opening and search of the footlocker.
MR. RAND OLPH:
QUESTION:

Thafc's right *

And not the seizure of the footlocker*

Isn't that correct?
MR. RANDOLPH:

That's right.

But it is important that the seizure occurred and
it is important that 1 — and I have — explain precisely
what led up to that* because at this point «—
QUESTION:

The footlocker was in the lawful

possession, custody, of the Federal agents, and the issue

13
involves the opening and search of it; isn't that it?
MR* RANDOLPH:

It was in the lawful possession of

the Federal agents. not just simply for the moment* or the
time being.

They could have kept that footlocker*

They had

probable cause to believe that that footlocker was being
used to transport contraband.

That made it forfeit.

Beyond

that* it was evidence of the commission of the crime.

They

knew that it was leaking talcum powder and knew that a dog
alerted to it.
It was not a temporary seizure of that footlocker.
They could have kept that footlocker.

They could have kept it

at least through trial.
QUESTION*.

For a long* long time.

Plenty of time

to get a warrant.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes.

We don't believe that's the test.
If this were the search of a home* of course* there
is no question a warrant would be required.
QUESTION:
the leek.

Mr. Randolph, you keep mentioning opening

How did they open it?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Lid they break those locks?

It is not clear in the record.

I

think our brief* or at least our petition said that they used
the keys seized from Mr. Machado.

But* actually* I don't think

that's correct in light of the testimony.

The testimony was

that the keys were seized after the footlocker was opened.

14
So* if that testimony is accurate, from the agent
that testified, then it is not clear on the record how it
was opened*
QUESTION:

Well, there is some information at some

point in the record that they picked the lock*
phrase*

That was the

Maybe used a screwdriver as a substitute for a key,
MR* RANDOLPH:

Perhaps*

I am sorry, Mr, Justice,

The reason we think that this is not to be treated
like a home where a warrant is required is the same reason that
I might say Mr, Justice Black

and this is dictum — stated

for the Court in the Preston case.

He said that 'common sense

dictates that questions involving searches of motor cars, or
other things readily moved, cannot be treated identical to
questions arising out of searches or fixed structures, like
houses,"
QUESTION:

Mr, Randolph, how could it be readily

moved if it was in the FBI office?
MR, RANDOLPH:

Because — The reason for the search

It couldn't be readily moved once it was resting in the
office of the agents, I agree*

Just like the automobile in

’§L could not be readily moved once the police had
possession of it, or the automobile in Texas y. White, but the
seizure itself, bringing it into their lawful possession,
justified, we think, the search, as well.

Because, once an

automobile has been properly seized under the Fourth Amendment,

15
Mr* Justice Marshall# the Court has ruled that it can be
searched# that search of it is not unreasonable, if the police
have probable cause»

And there are other cases where even

when they don’t# when they are taking an inventory, in South
Dakota v, Opper/can, for example.
QUESTION:

The same is true here

Where was the FBI office?

Was it near

the courthouse?
MR, RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Five minutes away,

I said the courthouse,

MR, RANDOLPH:

Oh# the courthouse.

Yes# it was nearby,
QUESTION:

Was the magistrate in the courthouse?

MR, RANDOLPH:

I have no idea.

It was 9:10 at night.

There was a magistrate there the next morning,
QUESTION:

Wouldn’t it be important for us to know

that?
MR, RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

I don’t think so,

I mean where they could have gotten a

s ea rc h wa rra n t,
MR, RANDOLPH:

We will concede that a search warrant

would have anc should have been theirs for the asking# but
we think that the reason a search warrant isn’t required is
the same reason a search warrant wasn’t required in the auto­
mobile cases.

There is# we submit# no rational distinction

between the footloeker# involved in this case and the glove

16
compartment of an automobile, or the trunk of an automobile
which can be opened without a warrant»
QUESTION:
of the footlocker.

Well, that supports the original seizure
It was in an.automobile, and the seizure

of the footlocker took place without a warrant because it
was an automobile and because it was incident to a lawful
arrest„
So, that supports the seizure, but, as I understand
it, the issue is not the seizure of the footlocker but the
opening and the search of it#
MR. RANDOLPH:

And we think that could be opened

back at the agents' office for the same reason that the trunk
of an automobile can be opened back in the police impoundment
lot,

«
The glove compartment,

as in Cooper v, California,

could be opened back at the police station, and so on and so

forth.
On page 38, is it?

No, I am sorry.

We have a list of cases.
QUESTION:

Yes, 38.

Of your brief or your petition?

MR, RANDOLPH:

Of. our brief.

Top of 38, Texas v. White, the search was of the
front seat console.
QUESTION:

It wasn't in (inaudible)?

MR# RANDOLPH:

No, absolutely not •

17

In Cady v» Dombrowski., It was a locked trunk
In ChaIres v. State. It was a locked trunko
In Chambers v. Maroney it was a glove compartment»
One case which isn't listed here* Cooper v,
California, was a glove compartment, as well.
We see no rational distinction between the two. but
we do see a distinction between what happened here and a
search, for example, of a person's bedroom.

In that case, you

would be at the core of the First Amendment where the most
protection is reasonably demanded»
Here, we are not at the core of the privacy
Interest of the Fourth Amendment,

We are on the periphery,

I don't think Respondents reasonably dispute that's
not the same as a house.

The Court has said that and It

said It in Preston,
QUESTION:

Is it important that the locker was seized

incident to arrest?
MR, RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

That's one of our arguments,

But you would be making the same argument,

I take it, if it had been seized in somebody else's possession?
MR, RANDOLPH:
part of cur argument.

That's right.

We would <

The first

We think it adds to the reasonableness,

the fact —
QUESTION:

Are there any cases that you know of —

What is the established rule?

In the event you arrest a man

18

and find a locked small box in his pocket.

Now, you can

search him incident to arrest, I take it, and you find the
locked box.

May you open it?

MR. RANDOLPH:

Are there some cases on that?

I don't know about locked.

Is

Robinson a case where
QUESTION:

How about a sealed envelope in his pocket?

MR. RANDOLPH:

Well, there was a case, and I think it

was Robinson, where they found a crumpled cigarette pack which
was closed and the Court upheld the opening of that.

I think

it contained pills or narcotics.
QUESTION:

On the incident to arrest theory?

MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

Yes, I believe.

Because it was in his possession and

under control.
How about ~~ Let’s say a man carrying a locked
briefcase.

How about that.
MR, RANDOLPH:

that type of situation.
not, I don't know.

Well, Draper is a case that involves
Whether it is a locked briefcase or

It was a brown leather bag that was

zippered closed, and the Court upheld the search of that, as,
I think, incident to arrest.
There is another case that we haven't cited.

The

Court has sited it usually for the proposition it Involves
plain view doctrine.
it Involves

In fact, when you look at the record,

something different.

It is a case called Lee.

19

United States v» Lee,

The Coast Guard shined a light on a

boat and it had —• they saw — the way the case was described
— illicit alcoholic beverages *— bringing alcohol on the boat.
It has always been a question to me how they could
see it0

The search was upheld, the seizure was upheld, be­

cause the alcohol was in cans, not in bottles, and some of the
search took place back at the dock.
So, I think that is probably another example,
Mr. Justice, although it hasn't been used for that proposition.
QUESTION:

With that sound approach, you don't neec

to go any farther than to uphold this as an incident to arrestsearch, do you?

Simply, on the basis that you could have

searched it when you arrested them.
MR. RANDOLPH:

If they would argue that, we would

have to go no further, but they say that it is not incident
to arrest because it wasn't in the immediate control of these
people who were arrested.
Vie think that that's irrelevant.

We think that that

rule was set down so that arrest would not be used as pretext
for general searches, which was the case under the Rabinowltz
rule and was overruled in Chimel.
But these people were caught red-handed, so to speak.
If you talk about expectation of privacy, could
anyone reasonably expect that the content of that footlocker
would not be revealed?

20

They were caught red-handed»
to the station house.

They were taken back

Did they reasonably expect that that

footlocker was going to remain inviolate?
QUESTION:
prophecy.

It could become a self-fulfilling

I mean if FBI agents open it and it is sustained *

I presume the next people have no expectation of privacy.
The concept of privacy must mean something more than that.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes* I think it does.

The Court has

used the phrase "expectation of privacy" in a number of recent
cases«
QUESTION:

But not quite In such a totalogieal way.

MR. RANDOLPH:

A legitimate reason — Would a

reasonable man have an expectation of privacy, that once he
Is arrested — X don't know.

I think that the privacy still

continues and I think the only point we have to sustain is
that he has no more expectation, or the privacy interest Is
no greater than it is in an automobile, or in the trunk of an
automobile or In the glove compartment of an automobile.
And I notice the dissenting opinion, in South Dakota
Vo Qpperman, points out that personal effects and papers are
carried from time to time In the glove compartment of an auto­
mobile,

I suppose that's true of footlockers, as well.
I would like to come back to the question,

Mr. Justice Marshall, that you asked, which is:

If the agents

could have gotten a warrant, why shouldn't we require them to

21

go get one?
QUESTION;

Mot we require them, but the Constitution

requires them.
MR. RANDOLPH:

Me think that the Constitution does

not require them.
The agents could have gotten a warrant, as I said,
in Cooper v0 California, and Texas v. White and Chambers v.
Maroney, or even in regard to the clothing in Edwards, yet
the warrantless searches were upheld in all those cases.
QUESTION:

Which one of those cases is material in

the FBI office?
MR» RANDOLPH:

Edwards would be like that,

Mr. Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

Mas it in the FBI office?

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, I believe.

the station house, or the jail.

It may have been in

I am not sure.

The test the Court has said in Cooper and Eciwards
and South Dakota v„ Opperman is not whether it was reasonable
;

to procure a warrant, but whether the search was reasonable.
That fs, of course, what we think the Fourth Amendment;,
in fact, says.
The Court has also said on numerous occasions that
searches without a warrant- are, per se, unreasonable, under
the Fourth Amendment, subject only to a few established and
well delinlated exceptions.

22

Well* of course* the Court has never had a case like
this before* so it hasn't created an exception.

It has had no

occasion.
QUESTION:

Well* you concede* don't you* that under

that standard that yotTve just quoted* this does not fall
within any of the exceptions, so far established.
MR8 RANDOLPH®

So far.- The Court has never had

occasion to pass on this issue, and if it had established an
exception, it would have been dictum.
QUESTION:

So we agree.

It is not your argument that this case

is governed by any existing exceptions, is it?
MR* RANDOLPH:

If it were, we think the Court of

Appeals would have gone the other way.
QUESTION:

I understood you to say that you thought

this footlocker was analogous to automobile.
MR. RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

That's right.

And, certainly, this Court has not upset

any search, in the past five years, of an automobile where there
has been probable cause, has there?
MR. RANDOLPH:

Vie agree.

It is analogous, but it

is not exactly directly a statement, although the Court has
said, in South Dakota v. Opperman, for example, Mr. Chief
Justice, you. quoted an opinion by Judge Wisdom that talked
about containers, such as automobiles, drawing no line between
what the container was.

23
There are indications in the opinions going our way,
we think, but -QUESTION:

Do you really think a footlocker is

very much like an automobile?
wheels.

It doesn't have motor and

In other words, it's not mobile.
MR. RANDOLPH:

If I may,may I quote your opinion

in Cooliclge v. New Hampshire, which said, ”Ifc is true the
automobile has wheels and its own locomotive power, but given
the virtually universal availability of automobiles In our
society, there is little difference between driving the
container itself away and driving it away in a vehicle brought
to the scene for the purpose."
Yes, we think there is no relevant difference.
QUESTION:

How about the container in an automobile?

This one is out and. in the custody of the FBI.
MR. RANDOLPH:

But it just traversed the entire

continent and it was on its way for another destination.

It

was like a car stopping —
QUESTION:

;

It wasn't at the time it was searched,

was it?
MR. RANDOLPH:

No, and neither were the cars in

Chambera yMaroney, Texas y. White, Cady y. Dombrowski, and so
on.
QUESTION:

Do you think the expectation of privacy - ’>

as great with respect to a footlocker as it might be with

24

respect to, say* the personal suitcase of a traveler?
MR» RANDOLPH:

I would think, as a — And someone

suggested that if I had personal belongings on me, I would
be carrying them»

I4d want them close to me.

a plane, those personal documents accompany me.

When 1 go on
I keep them

close to me.
There is a curious thing about that, because if
that had been the case here, if those people had been arrested
with a suitcase or a briefcase, it would have been a search
Incident to an arrest.

It could have been opened up.

The

courts are fairly unanimous on that, and they wouldn't have
even needed probable cause to open that briefcase.
QUESTION: Do you want us to say that this opinion,
if we go with you, applies only to footlockers and doesn’t
apply to other bags?

You don't want us to do that, do you?

MR. RANDOLPH:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN G, WEINBERG, ESQ. ,
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR* WEINBERG:

'

Mr* Chief Justice;, and may it please

the Court:
The Government on three separate occasions, twice at
the District Court and once at the Circuit Court, has tried to
persuade the courts that this search falls within the established
standards of the presumptive warrant requirement of the Fourth
Amendment.
They have- explicitly conceded 1 today that it does not
and have, ashed this Court to use this case as a, vehicle to
mr.. .e . aji

incur, ions into the Tarrant Clause of the Fourth

Amendment.
There is a coherent standard which prevails on even
warrantless searches, and that's the "cat standard," the
■expectation of privacy standard.

And by admitting; that no

existing exception to the search warrant justifies this search,
•as the law now stands, there are tremendous consequences towards
an individual's expectation of privacy,.
Here there was a seizure, as there frequently is in
automobile cases, and,ipso facto,the Government says you can,
therefore, search*
Well, it is the position of the defendants that
there is a constitutional distinction of grave importance

27
between an automobile and footloeker, and with a footloeker,
a briefcase

and a trunk and all kinds of other containers,

which, unlike a car, are often repository for private property,
which, unlike a car, are not constantly the subject of non­
criminal investigations, of contact with the police, with
regulations, with inspection, with motor vehicle laws, with
all the various indicia which this Court in the Cady case and
in the Opperman case has said reduces one's expectation of
privacy in an automobile.,
But the Government has conceded, as those cases
state, that the mobility of a vehicle, like the arguable
mobility of a trunk, has grounds"for a seizure.

It is grounds

for immobilization of the property.
But the Court has stated, and the Government con­
cedes in their brief on page 35* that mobility, in and of
itself, is not a justification for a search.

The justification

for the search following the seizure, in the automobile cases,
is the reduced expectation of privacy which an individual has
in a vehicle, particularly following the decisions of this
Court in Cady and in Opperman,
Those justifications for the reduced expectation of
privacy in an automobile are not present in the case with the
footloeker, are not present in the case of the briefcase.
QUESTION:
Mr. Randolph,

Let me ask you the same question I asked

28
You say the reduced expectations of privacy aren’t
present after Cady and Cpperman.

Well, if we decide this

case against you and the next case against your counterpart,
presumably, there will be reduced expectations of privacy in
foctlcckers.

That's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy however

you argue.
MR. WEINBERG:

Well, it is true that if this Court

did, in fact, make that decision, that the citizens would,
from here on in, have a reduced expectation of privacy.

The

real question is whether or not the constitutional standards
of the Fourth Amendment justify a decision which, in fact,
reduces the expectation of privacy.
And we would state that the entire body of juris
prudence, starting with Ex parte, Jacks on, through Kate, to
Uu S, y ^ Van Leeuwen, does not justify that kind of decision,
Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But the same kind of argument could have

been and was made to us in Cady and Oggerman, that, you know,
the right of privacy protected searches of automobiles even
though there might be probable cause, if, you didn't have a
warrant.
MR, WEINBERG:

And if I were arguing those cases,

I would make the same argument, but henceforth that argument
can't be made.
There are distinctions why this Court found a lesser

29
expectation of privacy in the automobile.

What I am suggesting

is those distinctions which justify the automobile cases are
not present in this case.

And I would argue that this Court

should not establish a lesser expectation of privacy in a
briefcase, in a footlocker, a trunk, in luggage.
QUESTION:

If the Fourth Amendment x^ere repealed,

there couldn't be a reasonable expectation of privacy by
anybody anywhere, could there?
MR. WEINBERG:

That is correct.

The Fourth Amendment,

at its very basis, up until this time, creates a presumtive
warrant requirement.
In the cases under the Fourth Amendment, particularly,
the Ex parte, Jackson case, the Van Leeuwen case, do not
restrict the Fourth Amendment privacy protections of the

Viarrant Clause to homes.

They very explicitly state that

sealed packages, that mail, that letters can be taken out of
the home; wherever they may be found, people have the justifI»
cation of privacy, have the right to the protection of the
Warrant Clause.
QUESTION:

I'll ask you the same question I asked

your opponent„
What do you think the established rule is in the
lov'/er courts, or ma2/be here, although I don't think we have
settled it, about closed containers In the possession of a
person when he is arrested?

30
MR0 WEINBERG:

To the extent that the lower courts

have developed any coherent philosophy surrounding their
holdings in these cases, that has been generated by the Chlrael
case,, and that has been an immediate control case „
QUESTION:

Let's assume there is no question about

immediate control, but the only thing is the container is
closed *
MR» WEINBERG:

Well, what they've really done is

frozen the situation at the time of the arrest and asked the
question:

Could the defendant put his.hand into a briefcase,

into a suitcase, and take out evidence to destroy or remove,
or could they take out a gun which would ~~
QUESTION:

All it is, that briefcase is just closed.

Nobody knows whether it is locked or not,
look in the briefcase, or not?

May the officer

Is there some established rule:

about that?
MR., WEINBERG:
QUESTION:

I would argue that there is really — •

I know what you would argue, but what

about
MR» WEINBERG:

There is no established rule,,

There

has never been a coherent rule, so there has never been a
decision of this Court,
QUESTION:

How about a sealed envelope?

Are there

some cases about sealed envelopes found on somebody?
MRa WEINBERG:

The Government would argue that*

31
QUESTION:

Are there some cases on it?

MR. WEINBERG:
QUESTION:

.No,

I don8t think there are.

How about when you search a car on the

spot when there has been probable cause to arrest and there
is probable cause to believe that there is some seizable
material in the car, and you open a locked trunk and you find
a closed container*

Is there some established rule about chat

c 1 os ed c onta in e r?
MR. WEINBERG:

There is no established rule.

Some

of the issues are left-open —
QUESTION:

I suppose the issue we have here is

rather relevant to those situations,,
MR. WEINBERG:

It is relevant, by analogy to any kind

of container where there is indicia of privacy.

A double"

locked footlocker would perhaps contain the most drastic
indicia of privacy.
defendant.

It is the least accessible to an arrested

It is the most secure, even If it was in the

trunk of a v er: io 1 e „
QUESTION:

Do you think if the rule were that you

could open a closed container found in the possession of a
person and under his control when he was arrested

If the

rule were that you could open that, would that govern this
case?
MR. WEINBERG:

No, it would not.

If it was in the

person cs control, there is at least accessibility to ir at time

32
of arrest.
QUESTION:

What about -- If you could open a closed

container found in the trunk of a car, and the car was other»
wise searchable, would that rule cover this case?
MR. WEINBERG:

It v^ould not because the auto search,

with reduction of expectation of privacy, could be used as the
basis for that decision.
QUESTION:

So there are distinctions.

In the Draper case, what was the situation?

I am a little cloudy on that.

Wasn't it a zippered bag, like

a briefcase that has a zipper on it?
MR. WEINBERG:

My recollection is that it was being

held by the traveler who was arrested in Draper.
zippered bag.

It was a

It wasn't locked, to the best of my recollection.

QUESTION:

Do you think there is any analogy between

the zippered tag in praper and the box with Mr. Machado, was
it, sitting on It at the depot?
MR, WEINBERG:

The two crucial distinctions are:

here, we have a double-locked, really unportable, foofclocker,
too heavy to move.
QUESTION:
obviously.

The second one is —
Well, it wasn't too heavy to move,

They moved it. You mean too heavy to move for one

ordinary man.
MR. WEINBERG:
distinction.

Right.

That would be the principal

It is a distinction of degree.

QUESTION: How dees the size of it, bear on the right

33
to

Suppose, instead of a lock it had a zipper as some

large lockers do?
MRo WEINBERG:

And we are talking here specifically

of when Mr. Machado was sitting on it, as opposed to where it
was at the time of the seizure and arrest?
QUESTION:

After the dog had identified, they con­

cluded there was probable cause, as the courts below have done,
and that said, "Mr. Machado, you are. under arrest,5' and then
searched it, right then and there.
MR. WEINBERG:

Firstly, this Court could Justify

that search without necessarily justifying the Chadwick
search, because of the location of the search and because of
the double locks.
QUESTION:

You mean they could search it at the

depot, but not after they got back to the FBI office?
MR. WEINBERG:

I would argue they couldn't search

it, but if this Court decided otherwise It doesn't govern the
Chadwick situation.

I would suggest that under the Chime!

situation, you really do need an in fact ability at the time
of the arrest when the positions of the people are frozen
to reach in and get either evidence
QUESTION:

You wouldn't argue that your position

today, if sustained, would necessarily overrule seizing the
overrule a case authorizing the sei «- It wouldn't overrule
Draper, would it?

34
MR* WEINBERG:

That is correct. Your Honor»

There are distinctions both at the time of the
arrest*

the fact that the foofclocker was not being held,

and the fact that the double-locks made it impossible, under
any conceivable circumstances to have the contents of the
trunk accessible.
What the Government has asked for here —
QUESTION:

Could they have picked the lock as

readily as they could at the FBI office?

Is that really a

controlling factor?
MR» WEINBERG:

I think a double-lock Is, Your Honor,

and back at the FBI and the DEA office they already had the
key which had been seised from Mr* Machado and used that key*
QUESTION:

The evidence -- That's not quite clear*

The evidence that I read here is that they picked it with
means other than the key.
MR* WEINBERG:

My recollection is that was the

suitcases, but I could be mistaken*
QUESTION:

What difference does it make, really,

how they opened it?
MR, WEINBERG:

The difference, again, is the

freezing effect under the Chimel case at the time of arrest.
Cou.ld a person go into the container with any kind of likeli­
hood at all and comport with the justifications for the search
incident to arrest theory which now are, which is removal and

35
destruction of evidence., or the protection of the officer.
There is no justification under Chime!* as it now
stands* for a search incident to arrest the immediate control
area.* except those justifications»

It is not a search aimed

necessarily at obtaining evidence for the Government»

It is

a search aimed at preserving evidence from the danger of an
arrested person.
QUESTION:

In Robinson, we said rather clearly that

whatever the reason behind the allowance of a search incident
to arrest, the Government didn't have to show in every indi­
vidual case that a particular reason was there* that it was
lawful by virtue of the fact that It was incident to arrest»
MR» WEINBERG:

That's correct.

When speaking in terms of expanding the search
incident to arrest theory* I think it is important to go
back to the original justifications for the exception.
Robinson was really decided by saying* "We don't want
police officers to have to make justifications every time"*»when someone is arrested they protect themselves* to form
the kind of intent as to why they are searching.
But when we are asking to make a major expansion of
the Chime! doctrine here* which would state that the Government,
when there is an arrest that has probable cause of contraband
can search* not only a footlocker* but all the suitcases.
Under the Government doctrine* anything that they

36
have probable cause contains contraband is susceptible
to search» There is no limitation upon that»

That's an -expansion

of the Chimel doctrine, in a very dramatic way»
expansion which was overruled

It is an

• where Chimel overruled

RabinQuite„
That was the same theory that this Court recognized
before Chim el»

It is almost trying to be resurrected by the

Government in this case»
How, the Government forms the distinction, but it
is not in the home, and that's a distinction which just isn't
justified either by history or by the expectation of privacy
cases which have emanated from the Fourth Amendment*
The distinction that you have a greater degree of
privacy in an envelope, briefcase, a trunk, at home, rather
than outside of the home, is really the very basis of the
Government's theory, a basis which history doesn't support
because the searches which history was directed to occurred
both in the home and outside of the home»

And it is also ®

theory which isn't justified by the mobile society we now live
in»

.
QUESTION:

it, isn't there?

Well, there is some truth, in fact, to

In Coolid^e, search of an automobile was

upset and the automobile was cn the premises af the owner,,
Subsequent cases have sustained not really distinguishable
searches of automobiles where they were in public ways

•

37
Someone who carries a sealed envelope on a three
thousand mile journey is probably more apt to have things
happen to it than somebody who simply leaves it in a drawer
at home*
MR0 WEINBERG:

They are more likely to have something

happen to it, but under the prevailing standards of this Court,
what would happen to it would have to happen to it pursuant tc
a search warrant.
Now, m she xiome sx'ou&ui on, liinie w,oolidge, cnose
cases held -- the Coolidge case, the Jeffers case, the Taylor
case

that you have to immobilize the object of a search,

that there is a constitutional distinction between the
intrusion of a seizure,of an immobilization, of standing
guard at the door, standing-guard at the driveway, and
Incurring the second search, the greater search, which is
opening up the seized or immobilized container.
To that extent, a home is important.

A home is an

indicia of privacy .to this society, both In its history, in
Its juris prudence and, most importantly, in the policy justi­
fication of why we need a warrant mid what kind of society we
live in.

It is no longer a society of homes.

It is a mobile

society.
The Government's theory is that if a police officer
thought they had probable cause — something in a lawyer's
briefcase or a judge's briefcase, as they left their office or

38
left their court house contained evidence, contraband, that
would be amenable to a search without the necessity of going
through a court,

Thafcfs the basic difference,,

QUESTION:

Well, Draper holds that, doesn't it?

If the search is incident to arrest,
MR, WEINBERG:

Draper requires the arrest, which

is the Government's fall-back theory,,
QUESTION:

You are saying that the Government's

theory would support that even though there weren't probable
cause for arrest,
MR, WEINBERG:

Yes, under their request for a luggage

exception or a briefcase exception to the search warrant,
QUESTION:

Mr, Weinberg,

it is, is it not, the dog?

Once the dog scratched that trunk, your clients were gone,
MR, WEINBERG:

When that dog

scratched the trunk, if the police —

They should have said, !’I wonder whose

trunk this is?*1

QUESTION:

I mean, isn't that true?

MR, WEINBERG:

If the police comported themselves

with the Fourth Amendment —
QUESTION:

All they had to do was wait until the

next morning and any magistrate in the world, on the basis of

39
that dog, would have granted the search warrant.
MR* WEINBERG;

That is correct, Your Honor.

However, the fact that they didn’t do it is of the highest
constitutional significance, because decisions are made to
regulate police conduct and they are made for innocent people
as well as people that are likely or have probability, have
contraband in their suitcase,
QUESTION:
case.

May I ask you a question about the Draper

I don’t know whether you have conceded or not that

that holds that incident to arrest it was appropriate to open
the brown zippered bag,
The actual facts of that case were that the heroin
was in the man’s left hand and that the syringe was in the
brown zippered bag*

And I don't think there is ary argument

about whether or not it was proper to open the brown zippered
bag*
So there really is no holding on the point that’s
before us.
MR, WEINBERG:

That’s correct.

It is a factual

situation which has been relied on by lower courts.
And what I am stating is ~~ that's firstly, and
secondly, this case is different.

It is different in a

qualitative way because of the privacy indicia of the trunk
and because of its general inconsistency with the justificaticns
under Chime1 for the search Incident to arrest.

40
QUESTION:

Mr. Weinbergs do you agree with the

Solicitor General that the footlocker could have been held
indefinitely, pending the obtaining of a warrant, the locker
having been seized pursuant to probable cause?
MR. WEINBERG:

No, Your Honor.

The longest period

of time vie 've had anything other than an automobile held is
the twenty«nine hours that a 12-pound package which stated
coins on the outside, in U.S, v. Van Leeuwen vias held»
QUESTION:

You would have no problem with holding

it for a sufficient period of time to obtain a warrant?
MR. WEINBERG:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?

The question really addresses whether or

not your client could have walked away with the footlocker,
under your submission,

or did the Government have the right tc

retain the footlocker?
MR. WEINBERG:

The Government had the right to

retain the footlocker for a reasonable amount of time and
there has never been a case which really says it is thirty
hours or forty hours.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. WEINBERG:

But, the Government, once having

seized the footlocker, whether pursuant to forfeiture or
through exigency, then had an obligation to get judicial
permission to create the greater intrusion which is the
s earch inb rus ion

41
QUESTION:

That brings you back to Justice

Marshall's comment, doesn't it?

That your argument really

wouldn't help your client very much in this case* would it?
MTU WEINBERG:

The argument would help my client a

great deal in this case because if the conduct of the Government
was improper in

the method in which they searched and seized,

and particularly searched, then the exclusionary rule permits
the exclusion of evidence.

That's the deterrent effect.

It

regulates police conduct, and that's one of the purposes of
the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

The only misconduct here is the failure

of the Government to have obtained the warrant.

You concede

the Government would have had time t-c obtain it, and had the
Government obtained it, in view of the evidence in this case,
well, the magistrate certainly would have issued the warrant.
MR. WEINBERG:

That's true in almost every case.

In the Katz case, there was clearly gambling Information
being transmitted over the phones

but the Government improperly,

you know, electronically surveiled the

conversation.

The Fourth Amendment doesn't rely on what is
subjectively known by the possessor of a trunk.

It relies on

certain guidelines and standards which, in this case, were
not comported with and the failure to comport with them results
in the exclusion of the crucial evidence.
So, whereas I concede that under the facts of this

42

case a search warrant would have been issued and the
Government had the right to lawfully hold the property,
that just goes to show the lack of necessity, the lack of
exigency and the lack of emergency in not obtaining a warrant,
in not obtaining prior judicial approval i^hich this Court has
held so often is necessary for the searching of private goods „
And, once again, the luggage is no different, under
these circumstances, than a home search, than a briefcase
search, or any of the other searches which the Supreme Court
has held are protected by the expectation of privacy,
QUESTION:

couldn't carry the home into the FBI office,

MRo WEINBERG:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

With the apologies of the agents, and

perhaps a potential case against them.

But by holding it

until they could find the magistrate the next morning, would
that not be a greater intrusion than the Intrusion of opening
it immediately?

43
MR. WEINBERG:

Well, that is what the consent

exception is for, in which a person has the right to require
the Government when

they are intruding upon private property,

except in very limited circumstances, to get a search warrant«
They can consent to the warrantless opening.
the exceptions0

Thatcs one of

These individuals did not consent.

They

implicitly asserted their right to privacy and their right to
require the Government, under the presumptive warrant standard
of this Court to get a search warrant*

That's just the

calculus made by defendants in trouble.
QUESTION:

For purposes of this case, I suppose

you would agree that it would make no difference whether
the contents of the footlocker were marijuana,

heroin or a

small tactical atomic bomb?
MR. WEINBERG:

That is correct, Your Honor, nor

would it have mattered whether it was one ounce of marijuana,
a broken talcum powder bottle and 199 pounds of various
books and the most private possessions.

That footlocker trunk

is imbued with the privacy that the cases Ex parte, Jackson,
United States v„ Vaai Leeuwen and Katz give it in this society
at this point.
And the Government's attempt here is to use the
ease as a vehicle to make a major incursion in when they have
to go get a warrant, without, as all other exceptions, the

QUESTION:

If you are holding the footlccker,

pending forfeiture proceeding, your submission Is, nevertheless,
that you may not search it without a warrant.
MR. WEINBERG:

If it is being held prior to a

search, that's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Prior to a forfeiture.

Pending a forfeiture proceeding, you still say that
the Government needs a warrant to search ifc?
MR. WEINBERG:

That's correct.

The statute permits

seizure.

The next step Is a search.

The search requires a

warrant.

If the search disclosed contraband, then you wouldn't

need a second warrant, then it could be held pursuant to the
forfeiture statute.

Until then, it is kind of a temporary

hold under seizure powers until the search discloses what's
in it.
QUESTION:

Again, it's the difference between a

car and a footlccker.
MR. WEINBERG:

That's correct.

That's a distinction

that is critical.
QUESTION:

If the footlccker can be held, Mr. Weinberg,

subject to the forfeiture proceeding, as the vehicle or

container of contraband, would it be necessary to open it
before the contraband — the forfeiture proceeding?
MRa WEINBERG:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor»

Why?

Why couldn't the Government go

into court and say here,, we have probable cause to believe
there is contraband in here, and then and there could not the
judge say, all right, we will have to open it to find out.
Now would that be a judicial warrant, in quotation
ma rks?
MR» WEINBERG:

It goes to the limits of the seizure

power, which have not yet been definitively decided.
QUESTION:

But, do you concede that the court could

say, having brought It into the courtroom, as you would not
trouble to do with the automobile* all right, now, have the
marshal of the court open it up and have someone decide
whether it is contraband.
MR. WEINBERG;

If consistent with the Fourth

Amendment, the judge made the independent and impartial
decision,
QUESTION:

On what subject?

MR. WEINBERG:

On the basis of whether or not there

is probable cause the container, in fact, contained contra­
band »

room In a forfeiture proceeding.

Yes, Your Honor.

And that would be lawful?

MR. WEINBERG;

That would be lawful.

It is the

involvement, again, of the Judiciary and not merely the
opinion of a police officer and his involvement of an
investigation that would decide 'when the search occurred*
because we are conceding the seizure — the police officer,
because of the exigency, can make a seizure.

But because of

the lack of exigency, once having made the seizure, Judicial
permission is needed for the search, which is the greater
intrusion,
Thank you,very much.
QUESTION:

Mr. Weinberg, would it make any difference

in your argument if there were a provision in the ICC tariffs
that permitted the carrier to open material such as this in
its custody for inspection at its discretion?
MR. WEINBERG:

Once again, that would be a search

by a private party and not by the' Gove n
QUESTION:

Right.

it.

I am talking about expectation of

49
privacy,,
MIL WEINBERG:

It might change the expectation of

privacy of an individual regarding what the common carrier
can do, but it wouldn't change the expectation of privacy
regarding the intent by the Government to find evidence of
a crime*
Thank you .
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

anything further?

Mr. Randolph, do you have

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes, sir, a few points.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONER
MR, RANDOLPH:

Mr. Justice White, in response to

your question, I think it is fair to say the Courts of Appeals
are unanimous «*■ I know of no decision going the other* way «-*that when a person is arrested a closed container on his
person can be opened.
You had asked me whether this Court had ever dealt
with that and I gave you the cases,

QUESTION:

They are unanimous, like one court, or

is it —
MR, RANDOLPH:
the cases in cur brief.
stands for that,
I guess it is.

Well, I think we cited a number of
I think U.S, v* Hand — Sorianao

Chaires is another case.

Zaic , z-a-i-c,

QUESTION:

Do any of them cover locked briefcases?

MR, RANDOLPH:

Yes, as a matter of fact, the Second

Circuit decision in Zalc, dealt with attache case.
And I might point out to the Court there is a
decision of the First Circuit, where this case comes from,
after we filed our brief, called United States v« McCanbrldge.
It is not cited»

It was just decided in late March»

It is

Number 76-1147, and that court In a decision by the same judge
that 'wrote this opinion, upheld the opening of a closed brief»
case in a trunk of an automobile that was properly seised»
That points up a fact ««•
QUESTION:

Did he do that on —

MR» RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

On the automobile exception.

And what about on searching closed

containers in possessionv-hen arrested, is that strictly on
the Incident to arrest basis, or —
MR a RANDOLPH:

In the Courts of Appeals, it Is on

a variety of different theories, Mr. Justice.

Sometimes It­

is not articulated —»
QUESTION:

But no court, I cake it, has embraced

your luggage exception.
MR. RANDOLPH:
embrace it.

No, I think the courts, generally, do

Matter of fact, the only court I know that

doesn't -- they don't speak of It in those — as a luggage
exception —

51
QUESTION:

Let's assume

Do you know of any

court that has embraced this notion:

That the Government has

probable cause to believe that a certain briefcase, checked
in a hotel, has got contraband in it,, and the checker gives
the Government the briefcase.
Let's assume they are in lawful possession of it.
Does anybody justify opening it without a warrant?

Do you

know any cases like that?
MR* RANDOLPH;

Unless you restrict me to hotels,

I think it would be analogous to the baggage car on a train
that hasn't pulled away, where —
QUESTION;

They have that right,.

MR, RANDOLPH:

Yes.

As a matter of fact, there is a case -QUESTION;

Isn't that your theory?

Wouldn't the

Government like to be able to search any effects that are found
outside the home, if they've got probable cause to search it?
MRs RANDOLPH:
QUESTION:

If it is lawfully in their possessionc

Yes.

MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes,

And I think the contrary rule, that Respondents urge,
has a delusive-: exactness to it.

It sounds very precise —-

but then, when you. start thinking about it, he makes a
distinction between whether the footlocker weighed 2 pounds or
20 pounds, or even if Mr. Machado was the defensive lineman

52
for a pro football team and had it under his arm as he walked
out, it would make a difference*
It would make a difference if the car were pulling
away*

The First Circuit has said that makes a difference.

If the car were pulling away, then you can open up the closed
container.
These kind of fine line distinctions, we think,
do a couple of things.

One, they lead to a lot of litigation.

Second, they don't give the police any real guidance, because
they are not analytical.

I cannot see the line between,those

events, and I think the Court would have difficulty doing so,
as well.
And we think not only that, but finally — and
maybe this is the most important thing

they take away the

importance and the seriousness of the warrant requirement,
because they burden the warrant system with these kinds of
caseso

And I think that may not help to Instill the kind of

responsibility that we want to instill in magistrates when
they are dealing with very serious intrusions where the Court
has held a warrant is required, In the home, in the office,
private communications•
For that reason, we urge the decision below be
reversed.
QUESTION:

In response tc Mr, Justice White, you

said that there was a specific Court of Appeals case, I

53
believe, relating to a locked briefcase»
Could you identify that case for us,
MR. RANDOLPH:

Yes,

The case, which is not cited

in our brief, is almost exactly like this case

as a-matter

of fact, it took place in the San Diego train station about two
weeks after this shipment took place-- except for one difference.
It was on the baggage car, they had a dog xvalk u.p, smell it,
the police went — or the agents went, seized the luggage.
They got the luggage before the train pulled away rather than
at its destination.
The case is United States v. Johnstone, 49? Fed, 2d,
397* the 9th Circuit, 1974, and the case is indistinguishable
from this one, even on the facts.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:40 o'clock, a.m», the case was
submitted.}
