MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Frost, you may proceed whenever you are ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS 0, FROST, JR,, ESQ.,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, FROST:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Before I begin my argument, I'd like to take a brief
moment to introduce to the Court my chief deputy who is here
with me today, Mr, William P. White, III, and for whose help
I am deeply Indebted for preparing and presenting this case
to the Court,
I would also like to publicly thank your very
competent Clerk, Mr. Kodak, for all his assistance.
My name is Louis Frost and I am the Public Defender
in the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida.

I appear here on

behalf of the Petitioner, Ernest John Dobbert, Jr., on petition
S

T

for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida,
The issues involved which we ha^ve to deal with today
/

are:

one, whether or not. the trial court, in applying the 1972

death penalty provision of the Florida statute to this defend­
ant, Ernest John Dobbert, Jr,, violated the constitutional
provisions of the United States Constitution, prohibiting
ex post facto law's, and when It is applied it also — to this

4
defendant, when It is applied to him, whether or not it
violated the Constitution provision prohibiting one from having
his equal protection of the laws violated, under the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution; and, third, whether or not the
trial court erred in failing to grant the defendant, in this
case and the Petitioner herein, a change of venue in the
circumstances, as they existed in Duval County, Florida,
I think to place the case In better perspective,
before the Court, I would briefly summarize seme of the facts.
The Petitioner, in this case, first came to the
attention of the law enforcement authorities In the City of
Jacksonville in the spring of 1972, at which time his old.est
son, Ernest John Dobbert, III, was found wandering around a
motel In Jacksonville, the Holiday Inn.
protective custody.

He was taken Into

He appeared to have bruises upon his

back and his hands and burns.

He was taken before a circuit

judge and questioned and thereupon began to reveal a story of
child torture and child abuse to himself, his two sisters,
a brother, and the ultimate culmination of death of one of
his younger sisters and brother by his father, the Petitioner
herein.
Shortly thereafter, immediately thereafter, a
warrant was issued for his arrest and he was not found.,
Shortly thereafter, his younger dauther was found
in a local hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with a note

5
pinned to her clothing asking that she be returned to her
mother in Wisconsin.

At that time* almost simultaneously with

that* the Petitioner’s abandoned automobile was found near the
Inland Waterway and there was an apparent suicide note left
with it* that the Petitioner committed suicide.
The Petitioner was not heard of until the spring of
1973 when he was apprehended in Houston, Texas.

He elected to

exercise his right to fight extradition back to the State of
Florida* which he did and which culminated, finally, in his
extradition to Florida,
He was appointed oublic counsel, through the
(?)

Public Defender's office* and Justin Sullivan of our office
was appointed.

He raised at pretrial and during trial the

questions presented herein which t\'ere denied by the trial
c ourt.

1
The trial court proceeded to attempt to pick a jury

and the jury was finally selected after four and a half days
of voir dire.

The defendant was tried, convicted of one

count of murder in the first degree, of one of his children,
of one count of murder in the second degree of another child,
of one count of child torture to one of his children, and one
count of child abuse, a lesser included offense of child
to rture.
Immediately thereafter, on the question of punish­
ment, the jury who had sat in that case, deliberated under the

6
statute In effect at the time of the trial and recommended by
a ten to two majority that the Petitioner be sentenced to
life imprisonment under the count of murder in the first
degree.
The court, subsequently thereto, overruled that
recommendation of mercy and imposed the death penalty as to
the Petitioner.
Now, frcsn that judgment and sentence, the Petitione-■
appealed to the Supreme Court of Florida and the Supreme Court
of Florida ruled in their majority opinion that the trial court
was correct and that it didn’t violate due process in falling
to change venue, citing the recent decision of this Court of
Murphy v» Florida.
However, they failed to touch upon the question of
equal protection and ex post facto, Q3 raised herein.

We

petitioned this Court for certiorari and that petition was
herein granted.
During the time of the initial finding of the
youngest son -- I mean the oldest son, Ernest John Dobbert,
III, in Jacksonville, Florida, immediately thereupon the
news media, the local television, radio and newspaper began
to cover every gruesome tale and incident surrounding this
particular case.

And they did so right up until the appre­

hension ~~ or rather taking into custody, excuse me -- of the
youngest daughter of the Petitioner in Fort Lauderdale,

7
Florida, after which when the Petitioner was not found, the
press subsided until his apprehension in Houston, Texas,
And from the time he vias apprehended in Houston until the
time he was tried, convicts and sentenced, the media was
continual In covering every incident involving every phase of
this entire proceeding.

This is more clearly pointed out by

the Appendix to the petition and next hereto,
'

The first issue that this Court must consider is

whether or not, by applying the 1972 death penalty provisions
of the Florida statute which has been recently held to be
constitutional in your case in Proffitt v. Florida, whether
or not application of that particular death penalty provision
of the statute to this defendant and this Petitioner for an
offense which was committed, allegedly committed, prior to
the enactment, and also prior to a decision in Furman.

And

the date of that offense for which he was convicted and
sentenced to death was alleged to have been December 31 1971
*

QUESTION:

*

He would have been punishable under that

previous Florida statute,, though, by death, would he not have?
MR» FROST:
QUESTION:

Not after your decision In Punas;.i,
But, according to the terms of the

Florida lav;, he would have been, would he not?
MR, FROST:

According to the terms, would he have

been punished by death?
been punished

We don't know whether he would have

8
QUESTION:

Would he have been punishable, nob

punished?
MR, FROST:

Would he have been subjected to the

death penalty, If he had been tried at that time?
QUESTION:

Did Florida lav;, apart from our decision

In Fureaan* authorize punishment by death for the offense of
which he was found guilty?
MR. FROST:

I submit no, at the time he was tried,

because by your decision in Furman you left only life imprison­
ment for those people
QUESTION:

My question, Mr. Frost, was:

Apart from

our decision in Furman, if you simply read the statute that
Florida had on the books at the time,
MR, FROST:

Well, if we didn’t have the '72 statute

to compare with it, yes, that v;ould be the answer, but if
you eliminate Furman then you have to go on and compare the
two statutes, the one that was enacted, affective December the
8th, 1972, with the one that was in effect at the time of the
commission of his offense.

To determine whether or not you've

got an ex post f^cto violation, you have to compare those two
statutes.
QUESTION:

Your claim, then, isn't that he was not --

he could not have been punishable by death previous to the
enactment of the new Florida statute, but that there was
enough difference in the factors to be considered?

9
MR. FROST:
Rehnquisfc,

Weil, it is two-fold, Mr. Justice

It Is, one, that he could not receive the death

penalty in any event because of your decision In Furman for
a pre-Furman offense when It was tried subsequent to the
enactment of the new statute.

That's number one, because

there was no valid death penalty provision in effect in
Florida after your decision in Furman.
QUESTION:
MR. FROST:

And what's your second part?
And the second part is, regardless of

Furman, regardless of Furman, If you take Furman away and,
assume that you had never decided Furman, then you would have
to compare the two statutes.
And the second point is that at the time of his
trial — it's two-fold -- number one, the statute in existence
at the time of his trial provided for a recommendation of
mercy.as being a binding sentence of life imprisonment.
In other words, if he had been tried, convicted and a jury,
by ten to two or by whatever majority lied recommended mercy,
then he could not have received the death penalty.
However, under the 1972 statute, under which he
■)

was tried and convicted, the judge did not have to follow
that recommendation and the Petitioner lost the right, that
substantive right, to have that binding recommendation of the
jury.

Regardless of whatever the verdict was, regardless

10
If it was even a recommendation, under the first statute,,
he had the right to the potential of having the jury come back
with a majority recommendation, and if so he would have only
received a life sentence.
Whereas, under the new statute, that would not be
the case and could not be, that the judge could have followed
recommendation or could not have.

The judge had the ultimate

sentencing power under the new case -— new statute.
QUESTION:

Under the old law, was the judge bound by

the jury’s verdict in either event?

Or, if the jury did not

recommend mercy, could the judge, nonetheless, impose something
less than death?
MR. FROST:

No.

If the jury did not recommend mercy,

he got death.
Does that answer your question, sir?
QUESTION:
MR. FROST:

Yes.
And the second point, in addition to

having the right to have that binding recommendation from the
jury, he also had the right, under the old statute., that if he
was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment., that he would
be eligible for parole as decided upon by the parole board and
parole commission.

At any time after he served six months in

the State of Florida, he would be eligible. When and if he
was paroled after that time, it is up to the board.
However, under the new statute, that he was tried

11

under and was convicted under» under that statute» if he is
convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment» he has to serve a
minimum period of twenty-five years before he is eligible for
any parole.
So» again» we submit that regardless of Furman and if
you just take Furman cut when comparing the two statutes that
we have here, there is an additional substantive right that he
is deprived of when the new statute is applied to him, that of
being tried under a statute which carries the potential of him
being convicted, sentenced to life imprisonment and having to
serve twenty-five years.of that sentence before he would be
entitled to parole.
QUESTION:
MR, FROST:

But that didn't happen in his case.
That didn't happen, but, as I read your

decision of this Court in Lindsey v, Washington, that Is not the
test.

The test is whether the standard which we go by, whether

or not that potential existed, and not whether or not he actually
got life imprisonment or not.

It was inherent within the

statute that that could have happened at the time that he went
in,
QUESTION:

Wouldn't you think that the Lindsey v,

Washington was limited to cases where the death penalty was
actually imposed and laid down procedural guarantees where that
happened ?
MR» FROST:

Well, that wasn't even a death penalty

12

ease, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but it was a fifteen-year penalty
provision where it was subsequently changed that the judge had
to give a minimum sentence of fifteen years.
And in the first case, it was any tern of years up
to fifteen.

In the trial and the reversal, they tried him uncer

the new statute and the judge gave him fifteen years, which was
the same that he had gotten under the original statute.

However

under the second statute, he was not eligible for parole until
he had completed the fifteen years, where in the first instance
he could — or at least not eligible until the parole board
considered it, whereas, in the first case, he would have been
eligible after he completed his time and had nothing more
hanging on his head.
In other words, he got the same sentence.

He got

fifteen years but -—
QUESTION:

But he had different parole rights, in his

particular case, didn't he, in Lindsey?
MR, FROST:

Different parole rights?

He had to do

fifteen years before he was eligible for parole.
QUESTION:

You are making the argument here that

something which could not possibly have affected your client, In
view of the sentence of death, is something, nonetheless, which
he Is free to challenge on an eoc post facto basis,
MR. FROST:

I think so, if the statute is standing

there and would deprive him of a potential substantive right

13
that could work to his detriment.

We must look at the standard.

Now, in the binding recommendation of mercy from the
jury;, there is no question about it there.

There was only

potential there, but it, in fact, did happen in that case.
The jury did come back, ten to two, for life, and then the
judge overruled that ten to two and gave him death.
Now, the Petitioner would also argue that to apply
the new 1972 death penalty provision to the Petitioner was a
violation of equal protection laws of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Now, in that regard, we said in the brief that this
may have been better claimed in the posture of a due process
argument* in relationship to the constitutional provision that
was in existence at the time that the offense was committed.
And, at that time, Florida had a savings clause in their
constitution, Article 10, Section 9 of the constitution.

And

that savings clause was not applied in this case to this
Petitioner.
That savings clause in that —- in our constitution,
which was in existence at the time of the trial, regardless of
the ex post facto —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there at

1:00 o’clock,
MR, FROST:

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice.

(Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court recessed, to
reconvene at 1:00 o’clock, the same day.)

14
AFTERNOON SESSION
(1:00 p.m.)

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may resume, counsel.

ORAL-ARGUMENT OF LOUIS 0. FROST, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHAIF OF THE PETITIONER (Resumed)
MR. FROST:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Due to the lunch break, I would like to just briefly
capsule the Petitioner's position to this p.oint.
Number one, the Petitioner asserts that because of
your decision in Furman there was no longer a death penalty
in effect in the State of Florida and, therefore, the punish­
ment was changed when they applied the new statute to this
Petitioner.

In other words, the punishment 'was changed from

death to life.

In other words, it should have been life but he

got death.
Number two, regardless of the decision in Furman, the
Petitioner asserts that there has been a change in precedent
to his detriment, a substantial change, in that under the old
law, if it had been applied, he would have received a sentence
of life imprisonment because of the recommendation tendered to
by the jury.
Too, that regardless of Furman, when the Petitioner
went to trial, if he went to trial under the old statute, he
would have had the opporunity to have the binding recommendation

15

of the jury to mercy- which was not the case under the new
statute.

The judge — whether that be right or wrong, he still

had a right to have that binding recommendation and that sub­
stantive right was taken away from him, and in this case, it
worked to his substantial detriment.
Number three, regardless of Furman, that the new
statute also had a right that was taken away from him in the
old statute, and that is the new statute had annexed to it the
provision of twenty-five years without parole if he had a life
imprisonment sentence.
And that's the Petitioner’s brief capsule to thi.s
point.
I just mentioned, at this point, when we recessed,
that the Petitioner also asserted that

applying the new

statute to his ease was violation of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

And I indicated to the

Court that that argument may have been better framed — the brief
indicates that also — in the way of due process because of the
fact that at the time that the Petitioner was tried,the; Con­
stitution of the State of Florida provided and had a savings
clause, which savings clause was Article 10, Section 9, of the
Constitution, and provided that repeal of criminal statutes,
the repeal or amendment of a criminal statute shall not affect
prosecution or punishment for any crime previously committed.
Now, the case law in Florida has continually

16
interpreted that constitutional provision in the same manner
as ex PQSfc facto*-

In other words# they say that you can't

apply an appeal or amendment of a statute that affects the
prosecution or punishment retroactively# but only prospectively
from the date of the new statute.
In this case, the court ignored that constitutional
provision and applied it -— the trial court# Mr. Justice —
QUESTION: ,-- on review ~~
MR. FROST:

And the Supreme Court of Florida# also.

They didn’t listen to our argument on that point.

They didn’t

mention it so# apparently# they didn’t follow it because then­
sa id nothing about it.
QUESTION:

Shouldn’t that court decide that issue

in the first instance?
MR* FROST:
QUESTION:

I wish they would have.
Should they not even now be required to

decide that issue?
MR. FROST:
them?

If you were to remand the case back to

Well# I think they should follow their own lav;.

Yes.

sir# I think they should. And I think the law was settled —
in fact# the Attorney General of the State of Florida, con­
struing that very provision of our savings clause in the
Constitution# in answer to a question from a state attorney
within our state# wherein a statute had been changed regarding
rape# applied in 1972 the rape statute In the State of Florida.

17
If a person was convicted and received a recommendation of
mercy from the jury, the trial court could impose a sentence of
any number of years up to and including life imprisonment.
In 1972, our Cede was changed and it made rape a
capital felony, but also provided if there was no recommendation
of mercy he could get just life imprisonment, period.

He

couldn't get any term of «.years up to and including life.
And, in construing that provision, the Attorney
General of the State of Florida, in official opinion in that
State, took the position that this particular enactment could
not be applied retroactively to someone who committed an
offense prior to the enactment of the new Code in January of

1972.
So, therefore, anyone who committed a rape prior to
that time received a recommendation and was tried subsequent
thereto, still had the benefit of getting any term of years up
to and including life imprisonment.
And we say that to apply this law not to this
Petitioner in this case; in the same fashion, whether it even
— they've even used this case in the State of Florida in its
construction when they changed the mode of the imposition of
the death penalty from hanging to electrocution, and this
Court has commented on that in its case Malloy v.South
Carolina. and said well, that wasn't ex post facto, as such,
but even in the State of Florida this savings clause provision —

18

and they cite it in one of the cases in Florida, Washington v.
Florida, they cited this savings clause provision and said
that a man who brought a petition on habeas because they wer.e
going to electrocute him, pursuant to the new statute that had
been passed, said, no, he is entitled to be hung under the
provisions of the old statute.

And they applied the savings

clause to him.
Therefore, we say it is a denial of equal protection
of the law to this Petitioner to not have the old lav; apply to
him as opposed to the new statute.
In addition, on the equal protection argument, there
was — If we allow the Petitioner to receive the death penalty,
as in this case, then we have denied him equal protection of
the law because we have placed him in a class that he ;Ls going
to receive the death penalty simply because of the date of his
trial, when he is tried.
Assume, for example, that a co-defendant had been his
wife and that she was charged with the same heinous and atferoc­
ious acts with which this Petitioner was changed, and she was
apprehended, tried and convicted, prior to your decision in
Fuman, she would have had — and convicted and sentenced to
death, her sentence would have been commuted to life, , aseveryone else!s sentence on death row in Florida was commuted to
life.
But, because he is tried subsequent to the enactment

r
19
of the new statute* then the obvious invidious discrimination
is that he gets death simply because of the date of his trial.
Now, what could be a more freakish application of .
the death penalty to this Petitioner than to have him placed in
that class simply because of the date of the trial.
In the recent decision of the Florida Supreme Court
In reversing the case of Lee which was a crime committed preFurman„

he had been sentenced to death, had the sentence

commuted to life, went up and they said It wasn’t ex post
facto.

It came back before the Supreme Court again and they

ruled that

His attorney had made a motion to vacate and set

aside his death sentence pursuant to your decision In Furman,
about three or four days after Furman came down.
And they said, well, It’s equal protection here, that
we can't discriminate and put him in a class just because his
lawyer was astute enough to file a motion prior to tVial —
I mean prior «*» shortly after your decision in Funnan — to set
aside and vacate his death penalty.
So, we submit that to deny the application of the new
statute and deny this to him also violates the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The additional point which we raise in this case is
that the trial court erred in failure to change venue and
change it to some other county in the State of Florida, other
than Duval County where the case was tried.

20

And I think -we have to look at that in light of you r
recent decision* written by Justice Marshall* in Murphy v.
Florida,

In looking at it in that light* I would say that our

case is distinguishable from the Murphy case for the following
reasons:

Number.one* this case is a death case.

This is not

a robbery case or a burglary case* as was the situation in
Murph the Surf.
In this case, since it is a death penalty case* and
in other words the Petitioner here is sentenced to death* I
think we have to look at the circumstances that surrounded
more closely to see that we do apply fundamental fairness in
a situation such as this, and that we are cautious in whether
or not we say whether or not the trial court should have or
should not have rendered a change of venue.
Two* that this case is different because of the vary
nature of the offense„

Child torture and child killing of two

of his minor children.

And* therefore* the very odious nature

of these facts make people get prejudices just because they
hear the case on voir dire* just when you mention it to them.
Three —QUESTION:

But they are going to hear that at the

trial anyway* aren’t they?
MR. FROST:

Yes* sir* they heard it at the trial.

They heard it* but the mere fact that they heard it in pre­
trial and they knew something about it* coupled with the

21

continuous press that was going on from the time of the
offense until the latter part, when he was tried, convicted and
sentenced to death — I am saying that, and that, alone, may
not be enough, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, but the death penalty,
the odious nature of the crime and, three, the mass, local
community scene.
In other words, just isn’t a case like: Murph the
Surf i^ho had national publicity and the Star of India surround­
ing him and possibly could have been, maybe, tried nowhere else
in the state

This defendant could have been tried in another

county other than Duval- County and because of this we feel that
the court should have changed venue.
I would like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal,
if it please the Court,
QUESTION:

Mr. Frost, before you sit down, what, do

you think is the purpose of the ex post facto prohibition?
MR. FROST:

Well, just as Chase announced in Calder v.

Bull, we say this is in Category 3? uhat a person should not be
subjected to an increased penalty at the time he is tried Over
what he could have received at the time of the alleged offense.
In other words,when you compare the two statutes,
or you compare what was the punishment then and the punishmentnow, if it, in fact, increased that punishment, or,additionally,
deprived the defendant of a substantive right, seme substantive
right that he was entitled to under the old statute, then it is

22
ex post facto»
QUESTION:

Don’t you think — First of all, it

doesn’t apply* I take it* to judicial decisions, as distin­
guished from the legislative acts.
MR. FROST:
QUESTION:

Well, I wouldn’t concede that,,

No, sir.

Do you know of any case where they've

ever —*
MR. FROST:

I think the Bowie case was one where it

applied in judicial decisions.
QUESTION:
MR. FROST:
QUESTION:

Which one?
Bowie.
You don't feel that Proffitt, in effect, is

a holding here, that the Florida procedure before was much more
rigorous than now, which would eliminate your ex post facto
a rgument.
MR. FROST;

Would you repeat that.

I am not sure I

quite understand it, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
QUESTION:
MR. FROST:
QUESTION;

Well, you know the Proffitt ease.
Yes, sir.
Do you think that your client is better

or worse off now that Proffitt has been decided?
MR. FROST:

X think that is really immaterial when

we are considering ex post facto application of the law.

We

a re not here to go into that, as to whether or not Proffitt
decided that this statute met constitutional muster and whether

23

or not It was, in fact, a better statute than the previous
statute that had the recommendation of mercy from the jury
without guidelines.
That's not an issue in this ex post facto
application, Mr. Justice Blaekmun.

And I think we have to

remember that when we look at this*
QUESTION:

I>o you take the position that any pro­

cedural change results in an ex post facto consideration?
MR. FROST:

Any procedural change?

$P» sir, I do

not take that position.
QUESTION:
MR. FROST:

VJhere do you draw the line?
Whatever you call it, whether it be called

procedural or not, this is certainly a procedure if you want to
say it is a procedure* Oie procedure for Invoking the death .
penalty here and one procedure for invoking the death penalty
over here.

But If that procedure deprives the defendant, the

person that's being subjected to the new law, o£ta substantive
right, then it is ex post facto.
In other words, if that right is a substantive right
and it viorks to his substantial detriment, and what could be
more than the substantive right of life, itself.

And what

could be more of a detriment to this Petitioner than to have
his substantive right of life taken away and given death?
QUESTION:

What would you say if they had increased

the penalty from a minimum of ten years to a minimum of fifty

24

years?

Would you say the ex post facto clause would bar the

application of the greater?
MR, FROST:

Yes, I would say that that would be a

substant 5.ve right that he had been deprived of, if they
Increased the penalty and enhanced the penalty next to the
crime.

Yes, sir, I would,
QUESTION:

Your comment gets back again to Mr, Justice

Rehnquist’s early question of whether at the time this crime
was committed, under Florida lav;, he was not subject to death?
MR, FROST:

Well., the answer to that question —

QUESTION:

The only answer you can give is, well,

the Proffitt case came along,
MR, FROST:
the law.

Well, no, Furman came along,

Furman is

Your decision in Furman is the law, and that law took

away the death penalty,
QUESTION:

But it wasn't the law at the time of the

crime»
MR, FROST:

Under the law, at the time of the crime,

he would have gotten life imprisonment, because a ten to two
recommendation of mercy from that jury would have been binding
on the trial court.
QUESTION:

Isn't that a bit of speculation as to

what that jury would have done?
MR. FROST:

I don't think it is speculation,

Mr. Justice Blackmun: they heard all of these atrocious, heinous

25
facts that carae out in this trial for five days.

And they

heard every one of these facts —
QUESTION;
MR. FROST:
QUESTION:
MR. FROST:

Under a different statute.
Sir?
Under a different statute.
They heard every one of these facts and

they still recommended mercy.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Musgrove.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES W. MUS GROVE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MUSGROVE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I am Charles Musgrove with the office of the Florida
Attorney General in Tallahassee,

I represent the Respondent,

the State of Florida.
Briefly, it is our position that the argument by the
Petitioner as to the ex post facto nature of the.:sentencing
procedure is without merit because this Is nothing but a pro­
cedural matter.

Vie think the essence of the ex post facto

provision is notice.

We think that was the gist of this

Court's decision in Bowie.

More recently, Mr. Justice Stevens

wrote a case regarding the application of the Memoirs test
in pornography matters in which you confirmed again that the
essence of the ex post facto law is notice and there .1.3 no

26

notice problem in this case.
If Mr, Dobbert were a student of the law, he would
have known that at the time he committed this offense he was,
indeed, subject to the death penalty.

At the time he stood

trial, he was, Indeed, subject to the death penalty.

In fact,

there was no change whatever in the punishment to which he was
subjected.
.At the time of the offense, the punishment was either
life Imprisonment or death.

At the time he stood trial, the

punishment was either life imprisonment or death.
Now, there was an additional provision in the new
Florida lav;, which Mr« Frost has referred to this morning, which
provides for no parole for a period of twenty-five years upon a
conviction for a capital felony»

Florida has conclusively con­

strued that prevision not to apply to any case such as
Petitioner’s where the offense occurred prior to the effective
date of the statute.
So, it is not simply a matter that because Petitioner
received the death penalty and not life imprisonment he didn't
get the twenty-five years without parole.

It is a fact that he

could not have gotten it.
It is the Lee decision, which we have heard a lot
about already today and you will hear some more from me and
I am sure again from Mr. Frost.

Lee decides that question»

So, we contend that there simply is no change in the

27

punishment to which Petitioner was subjected that distinguishes
this case from the Lindsey case which was brought up, I believe,
by Mr* Justice Rehnquist.

Lindsey involved a case in which

what had been a maximum punishment, fifteen years, suddenly
became a mandatory punishment*
impose the fifteen years.

The judge was required to

And the time that the person would

then get out of prison was to be at the discretion of the
parole authorities.
That is not the case

have here because there has

been no change whatever in the punishment imposable*
Now, you have heard this morning that it is a freakish
thing to make the result depend upon the date of trial*

1 sug-

gesfe to you that in procedural matters there is no other time
to which a procedure can relate except the date of trial, the
date when the procedure is to be applied.

Certainly, no pro­

cedure can apply before its effective date*
If this Court wishes to assume that it is freakish to
make the outcome of a case depend upon the date of trial, then
I would ask this Court what it was deciding when it decided
Johnson v, New Jersey, which applied, as this Court will recall,
the dictates of the Miranda decision only to those cases which
went to trial after the effective date of the Miranda decision,
I realize this Court has not applied that test since
that time.

However, 1 would suggest that to tell the State of

Florida that it cannot do the same thing this Court did in

28
Johnson v, Mew Jersey, that for Florida bo do it would be
freakish,would be inconsistent on the part of this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Musgrove, before you leave that point,

is it your submission that if the trial had taken place promptly
after the offense and before the decision in Furman, and if then
there had been an appeal to this Court and this Court had
vacated the death sentence on those circumstances, that Florida
could constitutionally have reimposed the death sentence pursu­
ant to a new statute?
MR» MUSGROVE:

I would take the position, yes, sir,

that Florida could have done so.
matter, Florida did not do so.

However, as a practical
For all those people who were

on death row at the time Florida vacated the death sentences
and imposed life imprisonment instead.
QUESTION:

And Florida did that as a matter of

its own policy decision rather than feeling It was under any
constitutional compulsion to do so?
MR. MUSGROVE:

Mr, Justice Stevens, I cannot tell you

what was in the minds of the justices in the Florida Supreme
Court.

They indicated, on the one hand, that they didn't think

there was any way to save their capital statute.

However, they

were faced, at that very time, with the brand-new procedure,
I have taken the position, in the brief for the
Respondent, that they could, in fact, have saved it in a
variety of ways.

They could have simply adopted the same

29

procedures that ultimately were adopted in the statute.
However, they were already faced with a brand-new
statute which would supersede anything they could do,

And they

did, indeed, go ahead and wipe out all then existing death
penalties, which we suggest is precisely what this Court said
had to happen as a result of Furman, namely, that all existing
death penalties had been unconstitutionally imposed and could
not stand„
QUESTION:

But if your view of the law Is correct,

I take it, wherever there was a death sentence set aside, if a
state had elected to adopt a new statute and have another
penalty hearing ending up in a death sentence, it could have
done that,
MR, MUSGROVE:

That is our position, yes, sir.

In fact, that was precisely what was done with
Rudolph Valentine Lee.,

Rudolph Valentine Lee not only received

the death sentence but his death sentence was affirmed,
QUESTION:

So that those that this Court vacated the

death sentence they would be vacated, but the other guy who
was convicted under the same circumstances, the Florida courts
could reimpose the death sentence?
MR, MUSGROVE:

That is our position.

It is not

involved in this case,
QUESTION:

Have you got anything to back that up?

MR, MUSGROVE:

The Florida Supreme Court thought it

30

could do so in Rudolph -QUESTION:

Anything other than Florida Supreme Court?

MR» MUSGROVE:

No, sir.

I think this is a very unique case»

I don't think

either side has found a case quite like it anywhere.
I suggest that whatever decision this Court may make
at this time it will be plowing new ground.
Now, Rudolph Valentine Lee was, indeed, ultimately
reversed.

The death sentence was cast out by the Florida

Supreme Court the second go 'round, and the reason it did so,
I suggest to this Court, has nothing to do with the situation
Mr. Dobbert finds himself in.

It is simply this:

Mr. Lee,

like all others who were on death row at the time this Court
decided Furman, should have had his death sentence set aside
by either the Florida Supreme Court or upon remand -- I think,
actually, all death sentences were set aside by the Florida
Supreme Court, either in Baker or in Anderson v.. State.
Now, Lee did not, simply because his attorney made
the mistake of following the advice of the Attorney General of
Florida and rushing right back to the trial judge to get his
sentence set aside, at which point, the state took an appeal.
The appeal was ultimately decided after the effective date of
the new statute, and Lee, thus, became the only person who had
been on death rcw, prior to the Furman decision, whose sentence
to death was not forever set aside.

The only one.

Not only

31

that, but It can be said that his mistake was in relying on
representations by the state.
All the Supreme Court of Florida decided in Lee was
that it would be fundamentally unfair to Mr. Lee to penalize
him for what a competent attorney chose to do as a matter of
tactics which produced the result that he and he alone, of all
those people, was still subject to the death penalty.
Mow, the state certainly did not mislead Mr. Dobbert
in any fashion.

The fact that he did not stand trial, by the

way, until after the new procedure took effect, was surely not
the state's fault.

,• ...

The state, for example, did not hide the evidence of
these crimes by lying to the authorities, by keeping the chil­
dren out of school so that the atrocities couldn't be seen,
by feigning a suicide in. Fort

Lauderdale and hiding out in

Wisconsin, New Orleans and Texas, and fighting extradition so
that he could not possibly have stood trial until after the
new procedure took effect.
feet of the state.

None of that can be laid as the

That was Mr. Dobbert*s doing,himself.

As a consequence, we say, simply, this is a procedural
matter.

It did not alter the punishment,

It is not ex post

facto,
I feel compelled to address the question that,
perhaps, has already been resolved in the mind of the Court,
to wit:

Whether the new statute is, in fact, harsher or

32

beneficial to the defendant compared to the old one»

You will

find a survey in the state's brief of the then existing cases.
Subsequently, I have updated that.,
have been decided.

Some seven additional cases

I do have case numbers and decision dates

available.
But. of those seven additional cases that were
decided by the Florida Supreme Court, three of those have been
affirmed, the death sentences, four have been reversed.

That

included, by the way, two cases in which the jury had recom­
mended life and that decision was overridden.

One of those was

affirmed and the other was reversed.
So that, at this point, of a total of thirty-six eases
which the Florida Supreme Court has decided on death penalties
— pardon me, forty cases — twenty-two of those have bean
affirmed, eighteen of those have been reversed.
The jury recommendations in those cases have included,
by my count, twenty-six recommendations to death.

Nov*, in

addition, I have included in the matters attached to the
Respondent's, and later to my brief, some four cases that we
are aware of, and there may well be others, because we donEfc
routinely get those in our Tallahassee office, and the issue
of the sentence is not one that is raised on appeal, but we
know of at least four cases in which the process went the other
way and in which the jury recommended death and the trial judge
overruled ,

33
Sc, we would say, afc this point, there are at least
eight, and now counting Gardner who this Court just took off
death row, nine less people on death row in Florida than there
would have been under the old procedure in which the jury
recommendation was binding.
We think that is very strong, if not conclusive,
evidence that the new procedure is favorable to the defendant,
not unfavorable»

And we think the defendant is engaging in

Monday morning quarterbacking when he says, "Well, look, my
jury recommendation in this case would have produced a life
sentence for me."
QUESTION:
point?

Well, is thi3 your only answer to that

Your only answer being that, looked at as a whole,

the statute is more favorable.
MR, MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

What' is the other part?

MR, MUSGROVE:
merely speculating.

That is part of the answer, yes, sir.

Well, first of all, we think he is

He cannot say how a jury would — what sort

of a verdict a jury would have returned under the old procedure.
The jury would not have had the benefit ■—
QUESTION:

That isn't quite the test, is it?

MR, MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor —

Under Lindsey?

MR, MUSGROVE:

I don't understand Lindsey to have

any application to a case such as this, Your Honor.

If it does,

34
it eludes me because Lindsey was a case in which the potential
punishment clearly went from a maximum of fifteen years imprison­
ment to a mandatory fifteen years imprisonment»

There was no

longer any possibility for the judge to give any less than
fifteen years»
QUESTION:

I know, but under the old statute, here,

if the jury recommended mercy the judge had no alternative,
MR» MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

He had to accept it.

MR„ MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

That is true. Your Honor.

That is true.

And here, the same recommendation, he

doesn't have to accept.
MR. MUSGROVE:

And under the old system, Your Honor,

if the jury recommended death, the judge also had no alternative,
QUESTION:

I understand that, but, again, is that

your only answer?
MR. MUSGROVE:

No, my answer still is that what he

Is doing he is engaging in Monday morning quarterbacking and
saying this Is what would have happened under the old procedure.
And I suggest again that Is speculation on his part.

He cannot

say, as a matter of fact, what a jury would have done under the
old procedure.

The jury would not have had the benefit of

instructions by the judge of the aggravating and mitigating
circumstances.

The jury would not have had the benefit of a

separate proceeding in which aggravating and mitigating evidence

35
was offered.
Now, I recognize that in this case very little was
offered.

Certain psychiatric reports and the defense counsel

read to the jury from Mr. Neiser's book, "The Enclcsicn
Conspiracy."
QUESTION:

Under the old law, was there an absolute

right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida?
MR. MUSGROVE:

.

There was, sir, but there was no

appellate review, and the Florida Supreme Court bad no alterna­
tive to simply reduce the sentence.

If the Supreme Court

thought an unjust result was reached, about all they could do
was order a new trial.

They had no review of the sentence,

as such, a feature which this Court has found to be a very
vital one in the present statutory setup and one which has
produced, in fact, what we contend is a third opportunity,
under the new procedure, for a defendant to get life imprison­
ment, rather than death, where in the past, he had only one
chance.

The jury verdict was it.

If the jury said die, he

died o
QUESTION:

Mr. Musgrove, let me ask two questions.

First, I want to be sure I understand your statistics
correctly.

If I understand you, there are forty cases, death

cases, where the trial court has imposed a sentence to death
in Florida, under the new statute.

MR. MUSGROVE:

Yes, sir.

36
QUESTION:

And do I correctly understand that,In

those forty, fourteen of those x^ere cases in which the jury
had recommended mercy?
MR, MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

And in all fourteen of those, then, the

trial judge substituted the verdict of death for the jury's
recommendation of mercy,
MR» MUS GROVE:
QUESTION:

Y.es, sir,

Then, the second question I have is:

Although we don't know what would have happened under a dif­
ferent statutory scheme before, at least it is true, is it
not, that under the prior procedure, the jury might have
returned a verdict of mercy, and if it had that would have been
the end of the matter on the sentencing?
MR, MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

That is true,

In this case, the jury did that,

MR. MUS GROVE:

In this case, the jury recommended

mercy.

However, the jury was also told its decision was not

final.

It was told that these xv?ere the aggravating circum­

stances, these were the mitigating circumstances.

You were

to weigh all of these and reach whatever conclusion you deemed
appropriate.
None of that would have happened under the old
procedure.

And, certainly, there would have been no reading

from the book, "The Enclosion Conspiracy," to that jury under

37
the old procedure»

That just would never have happened.

Of those fourteen cases, by the way, in which the
jury has recommended life imprisonment and the judge has
overridden, nine of those fourteen have been reversed on
appeal in the Florida Supreme Court.

Only five were allowed

to stand, one of which, of course, is before you now in
Dobbert»
One, I might mention, was overturned by the very
trial judge x*rho imposed it in the fir^t place.

That's the

Sawyer case which Judge Baker took it upon himself to throw
out.

And still another one was the decision in Gardner which

this Court, just last week, threw out.
So, by and large, I x</ould say this:

When the jury

recommends mercy in Florida, under the current procedure, it
is a very exceptional case, in which an override occurs and
is upheld.
The Florida Supreme Court said that, in effect, in
Tedder when it said the jury recommendation should be bindins
in all cases except those in which no reasonable man could
disagree.

Obviously, they weren't talking about judges,

since judges rarely agree —
QUESTION;

That wasn't true in the Gardner case.

MR. MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

That all reasonable men would agree?

They didn't say anything,

MR. MUSGROVK:

No, sir.

Gardner preceded Tedder.

38
However, the Tedder standard was in effect at the time that
Dobbert was decided and, in fact, one of the deciding opinions
addressed it out expressly.
lated,

The other dissenting opinion re­

basically, to jury instructions and referred briefly

to the question of venue.
All of the other five justices of the Florida
Supreme Court concurred that the judgment and the sentence
were proper.
QUESTION:

The Florida Supreme Court didn't consider

the issue before us here now, did it?
MR, MUSGROVE:

It was presented to the Florida Supreme

Court, however, I would suggest that the Florida Supreme Court,
having already decided Lee and Miller, which are cited in my
brief, did not feel compelled to again address the same issue,
QUESTION:

There is no discussion of it?

MR. MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

No discussion.

No, sir.

It was the subject of a motion for re­

hearing, was it?
MR. MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

And that was denied i^ithout discussion?

MR. MUSGROVE:

Yes, sir.

However, in light of Miller

and Lee, recent decisions of the Florida Supreme Court, I don't
know vrhy they would continue to plow the same ground when they
had other issues to address.
QUESTION:

It was presented?

39
MR. MUSGROVE:

It was presented.

I am sure it was

not just ignored entirely.
QUESTION:

If it were decided the other way* would

It have been dispositive?
MR. MUSGROVE:

Well, it would have been dispositive

of the sentence.
QUESTION:

So that you must conclude that the issue

was decided in this case.
MR. MUSGROVE:

Yes, sir.

It simply was not addressed.

I have heard seme discussion here today about the
evidence clause, and if I understood Mr. Justice Burger's
question correctly, it went to whether this was a federal
question at all,

I vfould suggest that it is not.

However, I would also disagree with the Petitioner
as to the effect of the evidence - clause:

Florida has held tha t

it does not apply to procedural matters.

Here again, this

..matter was certainly presented.

It was not addressed, but it

again had to have been decided, as Mr, Justice White has just
pointed out.

And I don't think that there is any basis for

this Court to go behind what the Florida Supreme Court has
d one.
Again, I do not understand that this should be
considered a federal question.
If there are no further questions, on the question
of the ex post facto application, I will address briefly the

4o
question of the change of venue* the request for change of
venue,
I think Murphy is the case in which this Court has
most recently addressed this subject.

I think this case is

distinguishable from Murphy* also* and I think in every aspect
save one in which it is distinguishable it is distinguishable
in favor of the state.
Here* unlike Murph:/* there were some very excellent
efforts made by the trial judge to control the extent* duration
and the effect of what I would concede was* indeed* some fair
amount of publicity.
Here* the trial judge imposed an order a couple of
months before the trial* limiting statements by court personnel.
Here* he sequestered the jury throughout the trial* and he
even kept them separated in the jury selection.

Initially*

jurors were selected* in fact* the first twenty-seven prospective
jurors ’were brought before the court for voir dire one at a
time.

This proved to be taking too long so* thereafter* nine

were brought in* three at a time* thereafter in varying numbers
of either six or five at a time* until the jury was finally
selected.

And tentative jurors were kept separate.

Prospective

jurors were kept separate from those being questioned and those
which were tentatively accepted were kept still in another
location
So that even if one of the jurors were to say*

41

"Oh, I've read everything"

— on© of fche prospective jurors

were to say — "I've read everything and I'm just convinced
this man is an animal.

Befs guilty as charged and he deserves

to die," nobody except those jurors being questioned right
then, and, initially, as I said, they were one at a time,
would have even heard this outburst.
So the trial judge took some very excellent measures
to preserve the integrity of this trial.

Such measures this

Court thought in Shepherd would have been sufficient to pre­
serve the integrity of that trial, a trial which this Court
will recall was considered to have been conducted in a circus­
like atmosphere.

Certainly, nothing like that happened here.

Secondly, we have suggested that there is nothing
that was in that pretrial publicity that the jury did not hear
again at the trial.
porting.

It was basically straight, factual re­

In fact, everything, everything was there again for

the jury to hear.
We have examined the voir dire examination itself
and discovered that, unlike Murphy, where everybody had heard
of Murphy, a substantial number of prospective jurors had not
heard of Mr. Dobberfc.

Par more jurors were unable to set aside

their opinions on Murphy than there were in fche Dobberfc case.
Like Murphy, there were even some in Dobberfc, who thought that
perhaps he was Innocent based on fche fact they couldn't find
the bodies.

42

Every step of the way, the voir dire examination
here demonstrated that this was not an impossible situation*
that it was possible to get a fair juryAnd then, we examine the results of the trial to see
if this premise proves to be correct, and in fact it does.
This jury deliberated ?or, I think, some six or
seven hours.
the son.

It asked to have three witnesses reread, including

It considered lesser included offenses, as to all

four, and actually returned verdicts on two of those lesser
included offenses.

And then, by the way, as we all know, this

same jury went out and deliberated for, perhaps, a half an
hour, or so, and returned a recommendation to life imprisonment.
This, Mr. Dobbert suggests, was an unfair jury, that
he could not get a fair jury in Duval County, Florida.
I suggest to this Court that death cases are, indeed,
different, and that is the onljr distinction between this case
and Murphy.

This is a death case.

Death cases are different,

I don't deny that, but by the very fact that death cases are
different, they are the types of cases which invariably attract
great attention in the press.

And, unless this Court is pre~

pared to say every capital case must be tried on a change of
venue, then you must look to the selection of the Jury where
there is no change of venue to see if there is prejudice.
And I suggest to you you will find not only no
evidence of prejudice, but not even a basis upon which to

43
conclude that prejudice had to be there despite the protesta­
tions of the prospective jurors.
QUESTION:

What's the population of Duval County?

MR. MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

Jacksonville is the County seat?

MR. MUSGROVE:
it yet, then.

At the time, it was over half million.

I don't believe they had consolidated

Subsequently, they consolidated, but Jacksonville

was the county seat, I believe, at the time.
It is one of the larger population areas in Florida.
Dade County is larger.

Perhaps the Broward-Port Lauderdale

area, but it is one of the largest areas.

I am not sure where

this case could have been tried, if not Duval County, with a
fair jury.

I heard about the case in VJe3t Palm Beach which is

far to the south.

Certainly, Port Lauderdale, where he left

the suicide note, heard quite a bit about it.
The basic fact is that this, I suggv

, was, in fact,

a fair trial jury, very fair, and there has been neither a
showing of actual prejudice, or even circumstances in which,
as this Court did in Ervin v, Dowd,

you held that protestations

of — that prospective jurors could set aside their preordained
opinions could not be believed.

It's just not that type of

ease at all.
Certainly, there was nothing like Murphy, the talk
about prior convictions that were totally unrelated and that
were never heard about at trial.

Everything here that the juror

44
could have learned they did learn again at trial.
So, we would suggest —
QUESTION:

Mr. Musgrove, may I go back to the

ex post facto point for just a moment?
Do I correctly understand your argument to apply to
this situation?

Last term, as you know, the Court vacated

death sentences in North Carolina and Louisiana.
Could the legislatures of those states today decide
to authorize new sentencing procedures for all those individuals
whose death sentences were set aside, have rehearings and give
the courts power to reimpose those death sentences?
I understand, from your argument, they eovild,,
MR. MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

There is no basic difference because of

the peculiar way this case arose.

It is the same basic con­

stitutional issue.
MR. MUS GROVE:

It is the same basic issue, Mr. Justice

Stevens, and,frankly, the notice is still there which is
essentially our position.
QUESTION:

Your point being that at the time they

committed the offense they were on notice that it was a capital
offense.
MR. MUSGROVE:

Right.

Now, as far as the significance of this case, what»
ever you all decide for Florida will not have any great

45
significance»

There are some people still subject to the

death sentence, if you decide in favor of state here,
Mr» Dobbert is one,

Mr» Miller is back up for review again in

the Florida Supreme Court»

He's another»

myself, which will yet go to tr3.al„
new in May»

I know of one-

I think it is scheduled

And I am sure there are some others who, for seme

reasons weren't tried yet.

Perhaps, they were in, as the

one in Vero Beach, Twere in insane asylums,held until trial.
But, if this decision is to have any effect at all,
and it may have some slight deterrent effect, it.will not deter
anybody in Florida, except, perhaps, Dobbert, who as this Court
has recognised, will never do this again if he is executed.
It will not deter anybody in Florida because Florida 's pro­
cedure is now deemed valid, but In other states, just to
illustrate, robbery is usually a planned offense.
the things a robber has to calculate on is:

And one of

Should I kill my

witness and, thus, perhaps, run the risk of a death penalty if
there is one in my state, or should I let the victim live and
run the risk that he will put me in jail?

Because5,' of course,

eyewitness testimony is the best possible evidence and the
kino that the robber most wants to eliminate.
Now, he may, in his planning, make the definite
decision, one way or the other, based on his analysis of hi3
law, if it hasn't been before this Court yet.

But if this

Court decides in Dobbert that even if the procedure is no good

46
right then, it can be amended, and the amendment correcting the
procedure will be valid and will apply, even to older offenses,
then there is a deterrent»

He may leave the victim alive.

I realize it is, perhaps, only a slight deterrent, but
as far as we are concerned, if any innocent victims have their
lives spared as a result of the death penalty, it has served a
very useful purpose.
QUESTION:

Of all those you've named that are on

death row, those that have petitions pending here, they are
safe, aren't they?
MR. MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

Pardon, sir?

Those that have petitions here, those that

are on death row, you are not going to electrocute those, are
you?
MR. MUSGROVE:
QUESTION:

Oh, no.

Not right at the moment.

I hope not.

MR. MUSGROVE:

Vie hope we will be allowed to when

this Court Is through reviewing their cases.
If there are no further questions, we would summarize
briefly by saying that this is not an ex post facto application
because it is merely procedural and that the argument relating
to the change of venue should be rejected on grounds of
Murphy because in every instance this case is more favorable
for the state than was Murphy.
Thank you.

47
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen«.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 1:4-5 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-*entitled matter was submitted.)
