Mr. Gilbert, you may proceed whenever you ar® ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK P, GILBERT
ON .BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GILBERT:
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This appeal directly challenges the constitu­

tionality of the Oklahoma bear lav; which says that females
may buy beer at 18, 3.2 percent beer at 18, but males must
wait until they ar© 21 years of age.

This is an age/sex

discrimination for persons 18, 19, and 20 years of age.
The lav; is broad and all-encompassing in its sweep.
It says that all females, even those -that ar® the most:
alcoholic, most, immature, and most irr@spon.sibla, may purchase
3.2 percent beer at age 18 in absolutely unlimited quantities.
QUESTION:

The law doesn't say it in quit© th<os© ,

words, does it?
ILaughter.]
MR. GILBERT;

No, your Honor.

And the law doesn’t

say it in quit® the words that all males 18 to 21, even though
they ar© the most mature, most sober, most self-’restrained,

can’t purchase a drop of it, at least directly, until they
are 21.

But that's whet the law does.
QUESTION:

I gather there is no question in the cast

4
that drinking 3,2 beer may male© on© intoxicated?
MR. GILBERT:

I think there is a question, your Honor,

Th© legislature has concluded that beverages in concentrations
of 3,2 percent alcohol or less is not intoxicating.

In fact,

not only ‘the legislature; a popular referendum has said that,
and tb© State Supreme Court has upheld both of them.
QUESTION s

Than itfhat is th© relevance of your

suggestion that women can gat, drunk on 3,2 beer?
MR. GILBERTS

I believe th© relevance comes from the
r

State's assertion of what th© purpose of the statute is.

I

think the Stata asserts that this could contribute to the
overall drunkenness problem among young adults.
QUESTION;

Even though on© can't get drunk on it?

MR. GILBERT?

Well, your Honor, I am perhaps

exaggerating a point there. It would be difficult; I would
hesitate to say it is absolutely impossible.
QUESTION:

Maybe wa could take judicial notice of

some of these facts? and you won't have to exaggerate them,
counsel.
MR. GILBERT:
^QUESTION:

Very well, your Honor.

I guess som© of us do remember 3.2 bear.

MR. GILBERT:

Yes, your Honor.

All right, now/ th© real legislative purpose for this
discrimination we don't know.
antiquity.

It has been lost in the mists of

The beer law that we challenge today was originally

5
enacted in 1890 by the first territorial legislature as part

of a generalized civil majority statute of 18 for females
and 21 for males for virtually all purposes, of almost exactly
the same type of statute that was held unconstitutional by this
Court last year in Stantor* v. Stanton»
QUESTION:

Stanton, v* Stanton didn't involve

intoxicating beverages or the 21st Amendment, did it?
MR. GILBERT:

No, your Honor, it was

The particular issue was th® question of child

support, I believe.
QUESTION:

And when you say "w® ," you are referring

to your client who is the tavern keeper?

MR. GILBERT:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

There is no potential purchaser left in

the case, is there?
MR. GILBERT:

Well, technically he turned 21 about

two weeks ago, your Honor.
QUESTION:

If he technically turned 21, I take it

that means he had a birthday?
MR. GILBERT:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I presume he no longer is barred by

Oklahoma law from buying 3.2 beer.
MR. GILBERT:

That is correct, your Honor.

I believe under some cf your abortion cases, I
believe mootn©ss would not. be a bar to his consideration or his

assertion of the same interests teat he has been assorting
throughout; th© litigation»
QUESTION:

Why do you say teat?

This is not a

class action, is it?
MR. GILBERT:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.

And why is it not a class action?

MR. GILBERT:

The reason it wasn't is because th®

class v;ould b© composed of all males 18 to 21 in Oklahoma,
a constantly changing class, and the clause —
QUESTION:
abortion cases?

Isn’t teat true of the class in the

That was only a 9-month run fchesre.

MR. GILBERT:

Yes, your Honor.

But tea reasoning

was teat because itrs a limited period of time; th® normal
flow of litigation is such that if you are going to be really
strict about, the mootness point, you could never raise the
question, and th® protracted litigation of this Court is further
example of exactly the same thing.
QUESTION:

You have ter®® years her®.

MR. GILBERT:

Yes, your Honor, and this case is .now

into its fourth year.
QUESTION:

How do you avoid th® precedent of

Th© degree to which teat person was

claiming reverse discrimination would to soma extent depend
on his score on the LSAT, th© favored class's score on tee

7
LSAT, and, oh, various numerous things.

But in this case,

every single male 18 to 21 would have identical standing
*

because there is no differentiation under the standard between
mature young men or immatura young men.
QUESTION;

Doesn’t the decision in Sesna

constantly

changing spectrum of class members and if the on® that is
the named plaintiff no longer masts the standards , someone
can succeed if the class remains?

But it doesn't say if you

don't bring a class action vou can just avoid normal mootness.
V

MR. GILBERT;

\

Your Honor» I would invit© attention

to the fact that the statute actually runs against the vendor.
She is the on© who is subject to penal sanctions and
administrative sanctions, and she is still very definitely in
the case.
QUESTION:

That's quite a different point, though.

If you are arguing on behalf of the vendor, then you have a
question of standing.

That doesn't support your argument that

the potential purchaser is still in the case.
GILBERT;

Well, th© potential purchaser is in

But I belisv® under one lias of authority, th©

abortion cases, that there is no real problem of mootness in
the case.

QUESTION s

You

How in th® world can h© get that?
MR, GILBERT;
QUESTION:

All right.

He is over 21.

At least the —

You didn't ask for damages,

MR. GILBERT;

No, your Honor, w© can't in a 1983

action.
QUESTION;

That's right.

MR. GILBERT;

So we ar© asking for declaratory relief.

We can still ask for that.
QUESTION;

Before you were 21 you could have had a

drink„
MR. GILBERT;
QUESTION s

Your Honor, the vendor still has —

Th.® only way h© can get relief is to move

back and drink.
MR. GILBERT;

Your Honor, it is not really so much

the vendee who needs th© injunction? it is th® vendor who is
trying to sell', because the vendee, th® young man, he can drive
up to th© store and have his girl friend run in and get th©
baer.

That's legal.

What is needed is really the injunction

for the vendor because she is the on® who is in danger of
losing her liquor license for selling the stuff.
QUESTION;

Don't we have to rul® that th® young man

is no longer in this lawsuit?
MR, GILBERT;

QUESTION!

Counsel, if you prevail here, what is the

result of the Oklahoma law?

Does it mean that all people undor

21, or all people under IS be forbidden?
MR, GILBERTS
which is challenged

Then

portion of the statute

is not the entire discrimination; it

is that portion of the statute which purports to exclude scales
from the class of persons 18 to 21 from purchasing alcohol.
That is the way the complaint was drafted, and that is the
basis on which the State has seen fit to defend 'the action
throughout these four years.
QUESTION!

Are you positive about this?

QUESTION:

Y«3, your Honor,

You might win a Pyrrhic victory,

QUESTION :

Y®s , but in Singleton I think we relied

somewhat on the fact that the patient would be reluctant to
bring the lawsuit.

Hare your v@nd@as weren't reluctant at

all, your single vend®® wasn't reluctant at all, and b©nc©

1 wonder about the soundness of your equating the relationship
t

between the bar and its customer with that between th© doctor
and his patient.
MR. GILBERTS

Well, I don’t think the dssir© of

privacy is all that- is — we still hciv© the legeil problem.

If

th© vendor sells to th® male 18 to 21, she loses her license.
She is subjected to possible criminal action.

Wow, I think

that's standing enough right there, certainly th© Elsenstadt v,
Baird, the contraceptive cases.

That’s where -th® p©nal

sanction actually runs, and if anything, 1 think Mrs. Whitener
has found more standing? even if we did have a class action
of young men, Mrs. Whitener would really be"the party"in this
case.
QUESTION:

Of course, you have to say th© same thing

about a person aged 17.

in addition to th© 17-year olds.
QUESTIONS

But analytically speaking, can we really

give your vendor client any relief?

If we decide that this is

an unconstitutional discrimination, don't we have to leave it
up to the State of Oklahoma to decide whether all minors up to
21 will be barred or all minors up to 18 will be barred?

So in

effect your client's position may b© worsened if you win th©
lawsuit.
MR,. GILBERTS
say a first thing.

No., your Honor, that I don't ■— let me

If the legislature wants to raise -th® age,

they can do that in a prospective manner.

Now» in judicial

action, first of all, th© way th© complaint is drafted and what
is before the Court is only th® exclusion of the males QUESTION s

You say what's before th© Court.

What's

before toe Court is your complaint that it's an unconstitutional
discrimination to treat, say, women can buy at on© ag®, and
men at another.

Now, I don't know that the parties are fra©

under our decided cases to say you may only d@ci.ds this case
in a particular way.

I mean, I think that depends on th© thrust

of our decision.
MR. GILBERTs

All right.

Let m® explain this.

First

of all, as I have mentioned, th© way the complaint has been
drafted; second, th© State has not. urged

tills alternative

argument as a basis for supporting th© denial of be$r to young

12
men IS to 21» and I happen to know that that was a deliberate
decision, so it hasn't beon raised by either side.
Th© third point»

this is a due process question

which was not touched on in Stanton v. Stanton.

Let me point

out» if the legislature wants to raise th© age or tak© away
a vested statutory right» the legislature doesn't have to give
notice.

But if a court wants to tak® away a vested statutory

right such as th© vested statutory right

of

females 18 to 21

to purchase boar» it can’t be done in a judicial action without
giving notice and opportunity to be heard» which means to
take away th© young women’s right by judicial action as
opposed to legislative action» you wouId have to turn this case
into kind of a third-party cross-claim class action and serve
notice on all females 18 to 21 to giv© them an opportunity to
argue to the court why that shouldn’t b© don®.
QUESTIONs

Perhaps you should have joined them as

indispensable partias.
MR. GILBERT:

Nell» your Honor» if we had th© money

to hw« a class action, w© would have spent it on getting a
class action for the young males.
But- that is why 'th© State, incidentally, did not

question about it.

I don't think there is any

The legislature has gone through and said

18 for just about everything in Oklahoma except this beer
discrimination.
QUESTIONs

Ar© you going to mention Mr. Justice

Douglas' opinion in Kahn v«. Shevin sometime in your argument?
MR. GILBERT*

Your Honor, Kahn was a question, I

believe, of compensatory discrimination for the effects of
past discrimination for the unfavored sex»
clearly inapplicable in this case.

I think it is

I mean, if the compensation

is access to 3.2 percent beer, the only way that, can be
compensation for anything would be to say it's giving young
women an opportunity to drown their sorrows in 2.2 percent beer
for the effects of past discrimination.

QUESTION?

Perhaps you have stated the position of

14
Kahn y <. Shesvln in rather too narrow a way.

Didn't the court

hold that there ar® differences which can to© recognized

toy

legislative bodies, and isn't that what the legislature of
this State did, that —
MR. GILBERT!
QUESTION?

Your Honor, if that is correct —

— on the accident record and on the

vulnerability record of males as against females?
MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, the facts which the

legislature took judicial notice of or reacted to in Kahn
was the fact of past discrimination.

It wasn't really based

on any innate difference between male and female.

And there

is no basis in this record to say that the legislature ©v@n
remotely thought it compensating for past discrimination.
Now, the difference between male and female in Kahn
was that the female was the victim of discrimination, but that
would not. apply —
QUESTIONS

There was a passing reference to. that,

but that’s not the heart of that decision.
MS. GILBERTS
QUESTION?

Well —

It turned on th® unemployability in large

part '-hat happened to corn© from past discrimination, but the
r©le? Lv® difference in employability of woman and men at. th®
age of th® people involved there.
Well, you go ©n with your argument.
Mil. GILBERT:

Now, as 1 was saying, this statute

15
derived in its origin from the 1890 legislature, and there are
many theories as to why it happened.

I think the theory that

there was maybe a legislative intent that little boys were
little devils and little girls were little angels is as
good as anything I have heard»

The State has never come up

with what the real reason was»
QUESTION:

In 1890, I gatlier, the prohibition was

against sal© to minors, and there was another statute that
defined, for some purposes, civil, perhaps, girls

were

minors until what?
MR. GILBERT:

Minors were females till 18, and males

to 21.
QUESTION:

But that’s how you got the distinction

18 to 21 in 1890, wasn’t it?
MR. GILBERT:
in Oklahoma until 1972.

Yes, your Honor.

And that was retained

Now, in 1972 there were two judicial

decisions that told the legislature this couldn't survive.
One was this Court's decision in Reed v. Reed, and the other
was a Tenth Circuit decision which held Oklahoma’s criminal
age/sex discrimination unconstitutional.
So in 1972 the legislature said 18 is the age for
criminal and civil majority for both females and males, but
retained it for this one purpose.
QUESTION:
retained it?

Did the legislature tell us why they

16

MR. GILBERT:

Ho# your Honor.

General ever told us why.
QUESTION:

Nor has the Attorney

There is no real —

Didn’t you hav© a lot of religious groups?

MR. GILBERT:

Yes, your Honor.

I can make a state­

ment of counsel that I think it was strictly sectarian
pressure.
QUESTION:
kind

Were there not in fact pressures of that

in Oklahoma?
MR. GILBERT:

about it.

Yes# your Honor# there is no question

/
QUESTION:

And that's why it was retained# isn’t it?

MR. GILBERT: Yes, your Honor, it was to save the
souls of young men 18 to 21 from exposure to pool, beer, and
girls.

That was what was quoted in the legislative committee.
QUESTION:

before you go on;

Mr. Gilbert# may I ask this question
Assume for the moment that the legislature

by an appropriate committee had conducted hearings and come
up with findings -that legislation of this character was
required in the public interest by safety# would that affect
your position in this case?
MR. GILBERT:

No, your Honor, but that does get us

into the next question# the statistics which the State has
elected to.rely upon.
QUESTION;

If it were perfectly clear that th©

legislative purpose was safety on th© highways primarily, would

17
that change your position?
MR. GILBERT;

Well, it's kind of a meet question

because we know what, the real reason was.
QUESTION;
was.

I am not suggesting what the real reason

I have no idea what it was,

I was asking you a

hypothetical question.
MR. GILBERT;

All right, the hypothetical answer

would be if they are concerned about safety from irresponsible
young adults, they are going to have to say all irresponsible
young adults regardless of race, creed, color, sex, and whatever.
They can't single out one particular group of teenagers just
on the accident of their birth and say, "We are going to say
that these people are congenitally dangerous and deny them the
right to buy nonintoxicating beer."
Now, this doesn't
QUESTION;

»even though the legislature

had statistics that may have shown that the men drove,when men
and women went out together, xn©n were more often, drivers than
women ware?
MR. GILBERT;

All right.

First of all, there weren't

any statistics.
QUESTION:

What if there were statistics.

MR. GILBERT:

All right.

Your Honor, the mere Sact

that there were more men on the road doesn't mean that the
individual male is any more dangerous.

Now, maybe since there

18
are more men on the road,, there may be more men just by fch®
flow of natural statistics getting involved in collisions.
In fact, it would be almost inevitable.

But that doesn't mean

that the individual male is any more dangerous just because he
is a member of a class that has more —
QUESTION:

No, but that means that the law that

Justice Powell was talking about,would it be arguably an
improvement in safety?
MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, I would say anything could

be — you could pass a law saying no Negro will drive while
intoxicated.

Now, this relates to the public thing, but the

thing is you can't discriminate even for something like public
safety on the basis of certain criteria.
QUESTION:

Has the Court aver held that discrimination

of this sort is of the same class as discrimination on the
basis of race?
MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, this Court has come very,

very —■
QUESTION:

Well, I asked you a question.

Has it

ever held?
MR. GILBERT:

No, it. has never held that it is

totally to be treated the same as race, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Is it your position that Cronin v. Mams

has to foe overruled if you were to prevail here?
MR. GILBERT:

Yes, your Honor

19
QUESTION:

Are you asking that it be overruled?

MR. GILBERT:

Yes, your Honor.

Or it could be

tactfully ignored.
[Laughter.j
MR. GILBERT:

There is another candidate in that

same category, I would submit for your Honors9 consideration,
is

Gcesaart v. Cleary.

I feel that Goesaerfc is. to

sex as

Plassy v. Ferguson V7as to race and should b© treated accordingly.
In fact, as I read the Goesaert decision, it was considerably
worse than Plossy in th® race, because Plossy, while saying
that, the unfavored rac© would have to have its education and
facilities and so forth separately, Flessy never went so far
as to say the unfavored sex (sic.) could'be denied these things
altogether.

sax

But Gogsaert went to far as to say th® unfavored

could be denied these things' altogether.

So that's on®

way I view Goasa&rt as being considerably worse than Plessy v.
Ferguson.
QUESTION:

Has P1© s sy v. Fergu a on. ever been overruled?

MR. GILBERT:
Honor knows.

It was not directly overruled, as your

It was quietly put to rest as an example of th®

mentality of the age which gave it birth.

I would actually

ask no more for Cronin and for Goesaert.
QUESTION:

Th® first Harlan and Mr. Justice Holmes

participated in Cronin v. Mams, of course.
MR., GILBERT:

, your Honor.

Well, the founding

fathers we might say really didn’t do away with slavery either,
but we don’t look at it that way.

MR. GILBERT;

I can't. remember who wrote — Goesaert,

QUESTION:

MR. GILBERT: I believe it was Justice Frankfurter.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION;

May I ask if you know of any State laws

still existing that prohibit or limit the sale of intoxicants
to Indians?
MR, GILBERT:

No, your Honor.

are no such laws any more.

To my knowledge -there

I think they derived from the time

when certain Indians, under the wording of -the 14th Amendment,
were not U.S. citizens at the time, the so-called wild Indians.
To my knowledge, there are no such laws extant at the present
time.
QUESTION:

I am

not familiar with any
QUESTION;

Choctaw County restricted liquor to anybody.

QUESTION;

That's different.

MR. GILBERT;

It's not that, way now.

That was back

in territorial days.
QUESTION:

Yes, in 1940.

[Laughter.3
MR. GILBERT;

Your Honor, we have some statistics

in this case, and this is what the court claims separates this
case from every tiling else.

I have examined these statistics

in detail in my proposition two.

I would point out on© very

salient thing, and I think it sots th® ton© for all the other
defects.

Th© statistics are arrest statistics? they are not

conviction statistics.

All th© statistics show is ’that young

man ar© suspected by th® police more often cr are accused by
th© police more often for alcohol-related offenses than young
women.

That’s it.

from there.

And the statistics go downhi.il... right

I don’t have tiro© for a detailed discussion of

them, but. w® do have this.
Now, I have another thought on these statistics.
When you look at the nonarrest rates, th® sobriety rates, it’s

22
something like 98 percent of fcha males and 99 porcent'of the
femalesf plus or minus 1 or 2 percent differential.
QUESTION:

Counsel^ for that argument do you not

necessarily assume that everyone who has never been arrested
has never been drunk?
MR. GILBERT:
your Honor.

Well/ I think the law presumes that/

There is a presumption of innocence, and anyway if

it's a State statute and they are trying to defend a suspect
type or scrutinize a classification/ I think-the burden of
proof is on -them to come in with something more than "we suspect
that young males are guilty more often than girls."
QUESTIONi

Is it your position that a legislature

may never rely on statistical evidence based on numbers of
arrests?

*

MR. GILBERT:

Not for proving that same group is

inherently irresponsible or criminal or deleterious in some

idling.
QUESTION:

What percentage of the total 18 to 21

male population is represented by the arrest statistics?
MR. GILBERT:
QUESTION:

I believe 2 pereant/ your Honor.

Are you arguing that at the very least

it's over-inclusive, 98 percent are to be denied 3.2 beer
because 2 percent might —

QUESTION;

Ovsi:-inclusive.

MR. GILBERT;

Yes, your Honor.

But the point I am

trying to make on the statistics, all we have got in what I
take the liberty of calling th© sobriety ratio is that there
is only a 1 or 2 percent difference.

It's th© way you juggle

the statistics depending on which ax

you have got to grind.

I leave th© Court with the thought before I sit down
for rebuttal, that, if that's all it takes to get around the
equal protection clause, let’s forget equal protection.

There

will always b® a couple of percentage difference between any
two groups you separate, black versus white, male versus
female, Catholic versus Protestant, whichever group the
legislature is out to get, if all -they have to do is draw
on statistics lik® what happened below, then I think it will be
th© beginning of th© lend of equal protection.
Furthermore, just to run into my rebuttal time for
just a moment, a discrimination based on sex is like race
because it's an accident of birth which can’t be changed, and
for at least 99 percent of human activity, it has absolutely
no relationship to one’s character, ability, competence,
sobriety, or anything else.

Now, if race is going to be

treated differently from sex, it can only be 'because in sex
thsro? are sotaa organic differences which for limited purposes
might be relevant.

We have no analogy between the races.

But for nonorganic discriminations like this, I think it is

24
indistinguishable from racs, and 1 ask this Court, although
it’s not necessary to this case, because the statistics really
wouldn't pass even a rational relationship muster, to maybe
clear the air to say that sex discrimination, not based On
organic differences can be 'treated the same as racial
differences

(sic).

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. GRAY ON BEHALF
OF THE APPELLEES
MR. GRAY:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas© the

I am James Gray and I am here representing the State

of Oklahoma.

I feel that the State can summarise its position

rather briefly.
The trial court was presented with an attack on a
State statute which, as counsel for the appellants has indicated,
limits the purchase of beer, 3.2 beer by weight, to boys until
they are 21 and to girls until they ar® 18.
Counsel for the appellants presumes to know the exact
rvasonr for this legislation.

I will make no assertion.

The

oitco ion of authority that I recall was a newspaper article in.
his brief.

But evidence was put on by the State, statistical

in nature, which we believe shows a-difference in this limited
age group of 13 to 20-year-olds involving primarily traffic,
involving, I think, in terras of the State inters st, a desire

25

to raduce and to —
QUESTION;

Was there any legislative hearing?

MR. GRAY:

Your Honor, I am not abl® to say.

Oklahoma

does not keep committee records, legislative history as does
Congress, and I do not know.
QUESTION;

Is it your submission teat, w© simply have

no evidence whatever why th© legislature of Oklahoma retained
this distinction in this law when they abolished it for allother purposes?
MR. GRAY;

We have nothing in th® form of legislative

documentation of committee reports, et cetera, et cetera.

Th©

State has offered what it believes to be a vary reasonable
basis for the law and for which the legislature undoubtedly
passed it, but w© cannot —
QUESTION;

Now, you have changed to "for which te©

legislature undoubtedly passed it."

Where do you get th©

basis for that?
MR. GRAY;

That is purely the judgment, your Honor,

of our offic© and taking our history,
QUESTIONs

But that is really conjecture, isn’t it?

MR. GRAY;

Yes, it is.

QUESTION;

What about — I understand there was

considerable pressuro by sectarian groups at that time upon
tea legislature to retain this distinction.
not?

Is shat -true or

26
MR. GRAY:

I do not know.

Mr. Gilbert says it's so.

I am unable to refute his statement, but I have no assurance
of my own that this was the case.

I think Oklahoma was

traditional in its treatment of the age of majority since its
statehood in 1907 being 18 for girls and 21 for boys.

It is

significant, I think ~
QUESTION:

Am 1 correct that

that was certainly

true, indeed, ever since 1890,wasn't it?
MR. GRAY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

There was a general statute which for

civil and criminal purposes made the distinction.
MR. GRAY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

But that was all erased, wasn't it, in

1971 or ‘72s with the exception of this statute.
MR. GRAY:

Yes. .In 1972

the legislature amended

the statute which defined minors for most all purposes and
changed it to 18 for boys and girls.
QUESTION:

But retained it for this statute.

MR. GRAY:

But retained it for this statute by enacting

a new statute defining minors for purposes of stilling 3.2 beer.
And this is why I think that it is their intent in '72

which

is critical here, not necessarily the intent they may have had
*

years ago.
The purpose that the trial court found is on® which
we hew asserted which we think, though we cannot document it

27
with committee reports or this sort of material, which would b©
the best, of course, is to reduce the traffic, reduce death,
injury, and property damage.

Th© court applied ~

Really what you are arguing is that might-

have been a very legitimate reason.
MR. GRAY;

Y®s.

QUESTION:

But you can't say to us that that was

indeed th® reason they retained it.
MR. GRAY:

No, I cannot, your Honor.

QUESTION;

Can you think of any better reason?

MR., GRAY:

No, your Honor, I cannot think of better

ones for purposes of sale of beer other than traffic where
you would distinguish between th® sexes.

Certainly.

QUESTION:

Who do drink?

MR. GRAY;

Yes.

QUESTION:

What do you do with that?

MR. GRAY:

I don't, think the legislature --- I will

I don't think the legislature was concerned with

that aspect of it in this legislation because this same
statute also eliminates from consideration a parent who may
wish to give his child bear.

This is not prohibited specifically

28

by the statute.
QUESTION:

Do you think that helps?

MR. GRAY;

I think it only eliminates the now

driving members of the class as a reason for the legislation.
QUESTION:

Well, ar© there soma nondrivers who

donst have parents to give them liquor who drink liquor?
MR. GRAY:

I am sure -there are.

QUESTION:

Have you got anybody also?

MR. GRAY:

Wall, I am sure there are many who drink

beer who do not drive of all ages.
QUESTION:

General Gray, does this statute prohibit

an 18-year-old male from drinking 3.2 beer?
MR. GRAY:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

Then, how can it be related to the objective

you describe?
MR. GRAY:

I think it can because of the nature of

the establishments that sell beer.

Many of them are package

stores, Seven-Eleven convenience stores, grocery stores, where
in our society today you mostly drive to get to.
QUESTION:

‘

If

the legislature ware

concerned

with your objective, don’t you think they ought to have raade

No, sir, because drinking it without

I am saying that the statute — I would have to be

Do you think it would show anything at all

about 3.2 bear?

MR. GRAY:

Not specifically,, other than th© preference

for beer in the statistics on th© roadside survey, Exhibit 3,
I recall.
QUESTION:

Does it show anything about the intoxicating

nature of 3.2 beer?
MR. GRAY:

The statistics do not.

QUESTION;

I gather the premise has been that 3.2

beer is not intoxicating, isn't it?
MR. GRAY:

Yes, sir, this has be®n submitted by the

appellants, and I think it. is simply not true.

Counsel relies

on one Oklahoma ease which he says means that 3.2 beer or 3.2
percent alcohol by weight in beer is nonintoxicating when in
fact it is intoxicating.
QUESTION:

Didn't Congress find that it wasn't back

in 1933 or 1934 under the Volstead Act,?
MR. GRAY:

Well, sir, I am not sure of that.

I am not

familiar with it.
QUESTION:

I thought they did.

MR. GRAY:

Th® case I have cited in our brief is

Douglas v. State,,and it went into an effort at that time tc
avoid a conviction on a DW2_charge by wanting to cross-examine
the officer about what kind of beverage he had been drinking,
the effort being there to require th© State to prove that
3.2 beer was intoxicating because I think their effort was to
show that's all h& had had fco drink.

Our court said that was

31
not necessary, it was not. error because our penal statutes, the
after-the-fact statutes-, the DWX,reckless driving,

and so

forth and so on, all of which could b© involved in alcohol
problems.

It doesn't matter, the court said, what kind of

alcoholic beverage you drink a3 long as you were intoxiccited.
So I don’t think this premise is correct.
QUESTION:

General Gray, may I ask on® other thing

while you are interrupted.

To th© extent that the evidence

does shed any light on th© difference, if any, in impact on
males and females of th® consumption of alcohol tends to indicate
that

males because they are larger can absorb alcohol better

than females, is that net correct?
ME. GRAY:

I believe that's true whan you consider the

exact amount of alcohol intake.

The average male, with myself

as an exception, being larger than females would be able to
assimilate more alcohol without being inebriated than th®
corresponding female.
QUESTION i Assuming that as a fact just for purposes
of my hypothetical question, do you think that evidence would
be sufficient to support the opposite discrimination from the
one that the State elected to have.

In other words, would

that have bean sufficient to provide an adequate constitutional
basis fox discriminating against females in favor of males?
MR. GRAY:

I would have to say yes to the extent that

it would at least be a concrete physical physiological difference,

32

which would not be on© based on old notions and stereotyping,
and so forth.

But 1 think —-

QUESTION:

But how do w© know what the objective of

MR. GRAY:

Well* th© Court has nothing but what th©

State Attorney General’s office presented in evidence as its
best judgment on the legislative purpose.
QUESTION:

la other words, if it's related to what

the litigant says he believes is a reasonable assumption as to
th© objective of the statute.
MR. GRAY: Yes, sir.

S hav© to be candid with th©

Court ard say I have nothing to offer of a concrete nature as
to the actual reasons th® legislature-: chose to change tills
statute — rather, not change it, but to add a definition to
this statute.

Oklahoma just does not keep that record ordinarily,

and I am not personally aware of it.

By th© same token, I cannot

assume that Mr. Gilbert's comment was necessarily correct
that sectarian influences was th® real reason.

I am not aware

of that either.

I think what Mr. Justice Stewart was asking

thirties, so a. case in 1890 would have been before that rafehsr
than after it.

Yes, your Honor.

Tha reason I have cited

those earlier cases is to show primarily a history of this

This power

In each of those cases,

I think without exception, that I have cited, both from 1890
and through Gcesaarfc in 1948, all involved an attack on an equal
protection basis.

None of them involved a sexual classification

except for Goaaaert.
QUESTION s

Well, on© of Justice Brandeis9 opinions

MR. GRAY:
situation.

No, it was the administrativa appointment

But we do think that California v. La Ru e is close

to this case.

It did not involve a sexual classification, but

in its own way I think was a more difficult decision and a more
difficult problem than the case at bar-.

And the reason I say

that is because the activity sought tfo be curtailed by California
was to prohibit live sexual raker tairav&nt in th iq establishments

35
which it licensed to sail liquor by the drink.

Some of those

activities were, I think, admitted by this Court to, or would
have bean ordinarily protected by the First Amendment.

In our

case, the activity which is being restricted, 'that is, the
ability to purchase beer, is not, we think, and we hav© cited
authorities, a constitutionally protected right.
equal protection is a question here.
that.

Certainly

We are not minimizing

But even with First Amendment rights at stake, the

Court I. feel in. California v. LaRu© still recognized a
presumption in favor of regulations authorized by the 21st
Amendment.
QUESTIONS

May 1' ask does th.fi record show whether

the 3.2 bear in this case was imported into the State or
manufactured in the Stats?
MS. GRAY:

Mo, it does not.

It would be all-inclusive,

the statute would be all-inclusive.
QUESTION:

The second clause of the 21st Amendment

is very specific, as pointed oat by Mr. Justice Brandeis in
State Board v. Young*a Market Company back in 1*336, and refers
to importation or transportation into the State.
MR. GRAY:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

So teat might be a dispositive fact in

this case, might it not, under the 21st Amendment?
MR. GRAY:

Your Honor, although I am not going to

pretend to be the scholar I perhaps should b© in tes history

of the interpretation of the 21st Amendment

X can only say that

it was my impression that it was not that strictly limited in
its application in terras of regulatory authority over those

And Mr. Justice Brandeis said for a

You don't rely on that at all?
MR. GRAY:

misunderstood you.

W© do rely on it, your Honor.

Perhaps I

If I am correct in assuming that importation

of intoxicating liquors is not the only intoxicating liquor
that may be controlled under the 21st. Amendment, then that
authority is clear that equal protection attacks, as cited in

37
the 1890 casss and through Goesaert in 1948, have all rejected
equal protection attacks against regulations, whether it was
the requiring of bond, requiring an importer's license, all
these

things which were assarted to be a denial of equal

protection were not accepted on -that basis because of the
broad authority,

wnether 'they went from the 10th or through

the 21st in deciding, in my opinion.
But 1 am wondering if, though ostensibly in my
client's favor, the strong language about the 21st Amendment
cannot be struck down by the 14th and so forth, I wonder if it
is that strong.

I wonder if Reed v. Reed and even California v.

La.Ru® would still allow such, you. know, quite a strong
statement today.
But I -think ir regard lass, the trial court in our
case found from evidence which it conceded was not open and
shut, not altogether without some objections, yet I think if
we consider that legislatures in terms of what is admissible
as evidence, what the court could have considered, I don't
think legislators are bound to consider only evidence which
would ba admissible in court in reaching a decision as to
legislation.

MS. GRAY:

I’m sure it didn’t apply to him.
I think those laws, all those

40

laws had a way of bend iri g ah the appropriate time.
Your Honor, I would dos©, I think, by perhaps
referring to one other case.

The Oklahoma Supreme Court, to

my knowledge, has not had an opportunity to rule on this issue
directly.

Counsel does cite Bassett v. Bassett which was

decided after 1972, which was a court of appeals decision of
Oklahoma.

Th© issue before th© court was whether a parent could

sue mi unemancipated minor for a tort, the minor being between
18 and 21 and thus subject to th® old statutes, th© cause of
•>

action having arisen before *72.

Th® court of appeals concluded

without having to change the legal period that this kind of an
action shouldn’t be allowed any more, this rule shouldn’t bar
the action any more, chose instead to declare all 18-21 year-old
minority distinctions prior to '72 as unconstitutional in light
°f Reed v. Retd.
Th© court did not deal with this statute, and the
court did not deal with the 21st amendment,

And w© feel the

court went much beyond what was at stake in that particular cas©
in reaching that conclusion.
Th.® Supreme Court of Oklahoma's rule governing that
cans indicates that being a court of appeals decision not
specifically approved by the Oklahoma Supreme Court is persuasive
to the Oklahoma courts only, but is not- precedent.

And we think

the true precedent for this cas© is the decision below, th©
first time it has com® to grips, to my knowledge.

MR. GRAY:

Your Honor, we didn’t feel that it would

purpose, because it would have been illegal for boys or girls,
either one, to drink alcoholic baverag® in excess of 3.2 beer
until they ax® 21.

So if the statistics show t-hat fcher© is

alcohol involved in an under-2l-yoars-of-age group, than it's
an illegal purchase automatically for boys, it might have been
for girls if it was hard liquor, but it wouldn’t have b@©:a if

This doesn’t mean the law is perfect.

It doesn’t mean that these

it, as counsel has pointed out.

It’s not a perfect solution.

But we don’t think it's unconstitutional.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK P. GILBERT
0N BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GILBERT:

Yas, very briefly.

Your Honors, may it please the Courts

On this question

of standing, my distinguished co-counsel has talked to ms to
invite your attention to two cases, Barrows v„ Jackson in 346 U.S.
and Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park in 396 U.S., that a whit®
owner of real estate wishing to sell to Negroes does have standing

45
to assert the equal protection rights of Negro vendees.

I

•think that is relevant to the question here.

That's partly because that widens his

market, doesn't it?

Ha has an economic interest.

MR. GILBERT:

Yes, your Honor.

That's our plea here.

It's idio same thing.
Also, on this question about the boys being able to
get the liquor somehow, this is just part of the old thing in
Oklahoma that the dries have had their law and the wets have
had their liquor, kind of a gentlemen's agreement.

But I will

tell you who really is the loser in this scheme, it's the
vendor who around election time can always expect to b@ raided

*

by the. local law.

That gees to the standing.

Now, on this getting intoxicated on 3.2, lot me just
state something actually from my own experience.

3.2 is so

diluted that tb's normal men will get extremely bloated on the
stuff before he can get clrunk.

It is possible to get drunk but

you have to fore® it down.
[Laughter.]
It's difficult to get drunk on 3.2.
The question was made about sox in the LaRue case.

That is a different kind of sex than what we have got involved
in our case.

That's sex's activity.

can regulate the alcohol and race relationship because that is

They

Now* some of them date from 1972* but they

weren't published until 1973r so this Court is at liberty to
take whatever inference it wants as to what was or what was not
before the legislature when this statute was passed.
OK.

I just have on© other thought.

I leave you with

i

the thought that the sobriety differential of 1 or 2 pereant
in this case was far less than the business experience differen­

I thank you for your time.
