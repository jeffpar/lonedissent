' PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF* JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next in 76-167* United States against Ramsey and Kelly.
Mr. Geller, I think you may proceed now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ. *
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case Is whether probable cause and
a search warrant are required before customs officials may
open an envelope mailed into the United States from abroad,
when they have reason to suspect that the envelope may contain
contraband or dutiable goods.
In cur view, such custom searches of international
mall at the border of our country are reasonable in the absence
of probable cause or a warrant, and we submit that this position
is supported by the background of the Fourth Amendment,by
nearly 200 years of American history and by the repeated and
consistent pronouncements of this Court and of every other
\

court to have considered the question, save one.
The one exception is the court below, the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
which held by a vote of two to one that the Fourth Amendment
prohibits customs inspections of what it termed "letter mail"
entering this country from overseas, unless the Government

4
first obtains a search warrant issued upon probable cause.
The facts are these:

On February 4, 197^ George

Kallnischkies, a customs inspector at the General Post Office
in New York, came across eight envelopes that had been mailed
from Thailand to four different places in the Washington, D.C,,
area»
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

Were these fairly sizable envelopes?
The envelopes, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

were eight and one-half by four and a quarter inches, and six
and three-quarters by four and three-quarter inches.

They

are normal size envelopes used in domestic and international
mail o
QUESTION:

That's the size of the envelope.

I

suppose it would depend, in fact, on what was in them to
determine how big the package was.
Row big was the package?

I took the question to be:

Did it have one sheet of paper in

it or did it have something more than that?
MR, GELLER:
Justice,

No.

It had more than that, Mr. Chief

The envelopes immediately attracted Officer

Kallnischkies1 attention not because -QUESTION:

Can you answer the question in terns of

ounces or grams or —
MR. GELLER;

Yes,

Officer Kallnischkies weighed the

envelopes because they seemed rather unusually bulky and large,
and he determined that they weighed 42 grams, which is about

5
an ounce and a half, although an ordinary airmail envelope of
that size generally weighs about seven to fourteen grams.

So

they were substantially heavier than a normal size envelope,
a normal envelope of that size.
Now, other things attracted Officer Kallnischkies*
attention and gave him reason to suspect these envelopes.
First, they were from Thailand which is a notorious source of
narcotics, and second, as I mentioned moments earlier, they
were rather bulky in appearance and when he felt them they
clearly felt as if they contained something other than, or in
addition to, correspondence inside of them,
QUESTION:

Then, are you asking us to infer that1,

that was probable cause?
MR, GELLER:

Well, Mr, Justice Stewart, the Court of

Appeals, in an obscure footnote hinted that there might well
have been probable cause here.
QUESTION:

VJhat's your position?

MR. GELLER:
QUESTION:

Well, we hesitate to -I thought your position was that there

was no probable cause,
MR, GELLER:

Our position is that probable cause is

not necessary and our position, in addition, is that using
the standards of probable cause —
QUESTION:

If there was probable cause here, we

don't need to deal with whether or not probable cause is

6
necessary.

Because if there was probable cause, then there

was probable cause.
MR, GELLER:

Well, if Your Honors determine that a

warrant requirement should not be imposed on border searches
but that a probable cause requirement may or may not be neces­
sary, I think you' would have to reverse the judgment of the
Court of Appeals, based on the Court of Appeals* apparent

conclusion that there was probable cause here.
QUESTION:

And you agree?

Are you submitting there

was?
MR, GELLER;

Well, we hesitate, as I say, to take

issue with that because it is favorable to the Government, but
we think, using the standards developed for probable cause in
domestic searches, that it is hard to say that Officer
Kallnischkies had probable cause here.

All that he knew is

that this envelope had come in from overseas and that it was
bulky, it seemed to contain something other than or in addition
to correspondence.
Mow, I don111 know if that would give a reasonable
person —
QUESTION:

I am just inquiring whether your position

is that there was probable cause or whether your position is
that there was not probable cause.
MR, GELLER:

Our position is that it is difficult tc>

conclude that there was probable cause here as that standard

7
has been determined for domestic searches, because I don't
think that a reasonable person could have concluded, merely
from the fact that a bulky envelope was coming in from over­
seas, that a law was being violated, that something was in
there that was evidence of a crime.
QUESTION:

When you get off the airplane at Kennedy

International Airport, or when you are about to get off, does
the Government need probable cause to support the search of
your suitcase and your briefcase and your pockets?
MR» GELLER:

It does not, Mr. Chief Justice.

The statutory authority for custom searches, which
is 19 USC 482, requires only that the Government have reason
to suspect that your luggage or you or an-automobile,if you aredriving an automobile, or a chattel that you are carrying may
contain contraband or dutiable articles.
QUESTION:

But there Is no statute that covers the

airport and the ships coming in.
MR. GELLER:

They just do that.

I think 19 USC, Section 482, is one

statute and there are other ~~

QUESTION:
MR, GELLER:

Does it cover airports?
It covers every entry into our country,

either at airports or at ports or at the land borders with
Canada and Mexico,

QUESTION:, Mr. Geller, does it cover mail?
MR. GELLER:

VJe believe that It.does,

8
QUESTION:
MR» GELLER:
QUESTION:

What language covers mall in 482?
Section 482, I believe, says envelopes **But that's envelopes carried by a person

coming in, isn't it?
MR. GELLER:

Well, I think would could assume that

the envelopes are being carried by somebody.

It may be a

postal clerk as he brings it off the airplane.

The envelopes

have not gotten into this country on their own.
Our position is that Section 482 of Title 19 covers
chattels of every description, and I don't believe there is any
case law that's ever suggested otherwise, Mr. Justice Stevens.
A number of the circuit courts have had occasion tc

consider border searches of envelopes and they have construed
Section 482 to cover that without any dissent.
QUESTION:

The statute says, !!search any trunk or

evelope, wherever found, in which he may have a reasonable
cause to suspect there is merchandise which was imported
contrary to law.,!
That's the language you. are talking about.
MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

That's the statutory —
The statutory authority is to inspect

envelopes in which there is; a reasonable cause to believe
there is merchandise imported contrary to law.
MR, GELLER:
QUESTION:

That is one ~~
Is that a differs t standard than a

X

9
probable cause standard?
MR. GELLER:

I believe it is»

I believe it is a

much lower standard,
QUESTION:

Do you think after the Carroll case the

Government needs statutory authority to stop people entering
crossing a border?
MR0 GELLER:

I think the standard would be one of

reasonableness under the Fourth -Amendment.
QUESTION:

Mow —

At the airport when you get off the plane

they have to have any statute, any standard of reasonableness
to open your briefcase and your suitcase and go through it?
MR. GELLER:

I think federal agents have to have

statutory authority to operate.
QUESTION:

Nell, the United States Government can

stop and inspect anything crossing its borders, can it not?
MR, GELLER:
QUESTION:
MR„ GELLER:

That's correct.
That's an inherent power of sovereignty,
That's correct, and we believe that the
»
'•

*

statutes merely allocate the responsibility among the DEA or
the Customs Service, which agency of the Government will
exercise that constitutionally based authority, which we
believe every sovereign has,to inspect articles coming into
its country,
QUESTION:

At the Mexican border, for example, they

can virtually take a car apart to inspect it.

Now, we have

10
held that after It gets away from the border you need something
more, and in some cases it has been indicated when the car is
riding six inches lower than it would normally ride that
affords some grounds to believe that maybe it has some people
or some substances in the car»
But at the border, is anything required at all?
MR® GELLER:

We believe that the standard is

reasonableness, and that's the constitutional standard®

Now,

there are also statutory standards which we believe the
Government has to comply with.

The statutory standard is

reason to suspect that contraband or dutiable goods may be
being brought into this country.
QUESTION:

Don't they have a rule now about spot­

checking two or three bags?

There is no more reasonableness

any more.
MR. GELLER:

Mr. Justice Marshall, I think it is

reasonable to spot-check bags,
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

I see,

QUESTION:

They spot-check them because they haven't

got the manpower and the time to check every one but do they
not have the sovereign power to open every bag, every brief­
case and go into every pocket of every person that's coming
across the borders into this country, without any statute?
MR. GELLER:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

that the fact that something --

We believe

11
QUESTION:

Why are we worrying about these

statutes except as It allocates the functions among different
people?
MR. GELLER:

I think that after Congress has passed

statutes that may limit the constitutional authority of
Executive Branch officials to carry out searches.
So there is no question in this case# I might add
that the statute ’was violated.

The question here is solely

-one of constitutional law.
QUESTION:

And your position is that the statute

may reflect Congress' intent that the full constitutional
authority of the Government shouldn't be exercised# that they
adhere to a standard of reasonableness# whereas# they would
not have to in the absence of the statute.
MR. GELLER:

Well# the Fourth Amendment# Mr. Justice

Rehnquist# imposes a requirement of reasonableness.
Now, in our view# Section 482 is coterminous with
the Fourth Amendment,
QUEST3'.QN:

Does the Fourth Amendment impose any

requirement# at all# as to border searches# after the Carroll
case?
MR. GELLER:

I believe that the reasonableness

requirement cf the Fourth Amendment would apply at the border#
but it is hard to imagine a border search that would not be
reasonable# except in the way it *s carried out# such as very

12
intrusive search or, perhaps, a body cavity search.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly, Chief Justice Taft's

language in that casts doesn't give you any impression that
there Is any limitation on the authority of the Government to
search at the border.
MR, GELLER;

Well, I think that there is a require»

meht of reasonableness imposed in the Fourth Amendment, but
I think I would agree with the thrust of Your Honor's question,
that it is hard to imagine a border search that would not be
reasonable,
QUESTION;
conducted.

Except in the manner in which it is

They might tie somebody up by his toes and take

him.
(laughter)
MR» GELLER:

That's correct, but that goes to the

manner in which it is conducted and not to the power to make
the search.
QUESTION:

Well, what are called the, so-called,

stripper skin searches which are performed at the borders
sometimes.

Those have required a higher standard than mere

caprice and spot-check, have they not?
MR. GELLER:

Some circuits have held that, Mr. Chief

Justice,

Now, Officer Kallnischkies opened the envelope and
found in it, sandwiched between two pieces of cardboard, a

13

plastic bag containing a white powdery substance.

He removed

a sample, field tested it and determined that it was heroin.
The envelope from xvhich the heroin was taken contained no
c orres pond enc e,
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

No writing of any kind?
Not of any kind.

The only thing that

was in the envelope, Mr. Justice Blackmun, was some cardboard
and some heroin.
Kallnischkies then opened the other seven envelopes
which also appeared to be bulky and to contain merchandise
and which appeared to have been- typed on the same typewriter
as the first envelope he opened, and these seven envelopes
also contained only heroin and cardboard, no correspondence.
QUESTION:

All from the same post office address in

Thailand or from -~
MR. GELLER:

They all came from Thailand.

I am not

certain of the way in which the postal authorities in Thailand
stamp their mail so it could be determined whether it came from
the same post office address.

And I am also not certain

whether it had the same return address, Mr. Justice, but it
clearly all came from Thailand and they lA/ere all addressed to
QUESTION:

That8s all we know that they all came

from Thailand?
MR, GELLER:

That’s correct, I believe.

The envelopes were then resealed in a locked pouch

14

and were sent to Washington, where they were opened by agents
of the Drug Enforcement Administration,

A controlled delivery

was then arranged for six of the envelopes,

DEA agents ob-.

served Respondent Kelly collect the envelopes, meet with
Respondent Ramsey and give Ramsey a brown paper bag. Respondents
were then arrested,and evidence seized incident to these
arrests eventually led to their conviction on a variety of
narcotics offenses,
A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed
these convictions.

The court held that Officer Kallnisehkies'

opening of the envelopes in the absence of a warrant issued
upon probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment.
Although the court acknowledged that border searches
have traditionally been recognized as an exception to the
warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, and although the
court conceded that the customs agent here had reason to sus­
pect that the envelopes may have contained merchandise subject
to duty or prohibited from entering the country, it nonetheless
concluded that the border search exception should apply only
to packages mailed into the United States from foreign coun­
tries and should not be extended to so-called letter mail,
such it believed was involved in this case.
Now, we believe';that the decision below is wrong
and that it threatens a substantial inroad in the Government rs
ability to detect and to prevent smuggling.

There is, as the

15
Court of Appeals acknowledged, an established border search
power.

This Court has referred many times to the legitimacy

of that power as an essential means of protecting our nation's
security and revenue and is an inherent right of any sovereign
to control the introduction of prohibited or dutiable articles
into its territory.
Such searches, in the absence of probable cause or
a warrant, repeatedly have been held, to be reasonable within
the meaning of the Fourth Amendment because of the paramount
need of the Government to know what is being brought into this
country and because the minimal intrusion which the search
entails invades areas in which persons have, at best, only a
minimal expectation of privacy.
Indeed, as we noted in our brief, the very Congress
that adopted the Fourth Amendment also enacted a statute
allowing customs officers to carry out warrantless border
searches whenever they had reason to suspect that goods, wares
or merchandise, subject to duty, were being concealed.
Now, this border search power, as the Court of
Appeals agreed and as we do not understand Respondents to
contest, allows customs officials to search people, luggage,
automobiles, chattels of every description, and mailed packages
vjithout probable cause or a search warrant, as they seek to
enter the United States.
This being so, we can perceive no reason justification

16

to carve out an exception for so-called letter mail entering
this country,
This Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, v*ill you somewhere comment,

on what prompted the change In administrative policy in 1971?
You don’t have to do it now,
MR, GELLER:

Certainly, Mr, Justice Blaekmun.

Almost a century ago in Cotzhausen v, Nazro in
107 US, this Court observed that our customs laws and border
search powers would be meaningless if — and I am quoting now
— "the mail is to be left unwatched and all its sealed
contents are to be exempt from seizure,"
And, as this case, graphically Illustrates, small
sealed envelopes, equally as well as a suitcase or package,
may conceal merchandise which Congress has decided may not be
brought into the United States and may enter only upon payment
of a duty.
Mow, the Court of Appeals concluded that, while it
was reasonable to make a border search of mailed packages
without a warrant or probable cause, it was unreasonable to
make a similar search of envelopes sent as letter-class mail.
And it provided a number of reasons for its attempt to dis­
tinguish between envelopes and packages in the mail.

We think

that none of these reasons can withstand analysis and seme of
them can be disposed of rather quickly.

17

The Court of Appeals thought first that the border
search exception was grounded in the notion of exigent circum­
stances.

It would, said the court, be too difficult to obtain

a warrant when the subject of the border search is mobile,
soeh as a car or a person, but the court thought this rationale
v,as somehow inapplicable to letter mail which it said can
easily be detained while a warrant is sought.
As I have already noted, hoxuever, border searches
do not depend for their reasonableness upon any notion of
exigent circumstances.
historical footing.

They have their own practical arx3

This is shown by the fact that while the

presence of exigent circumstances has traditionally been held
only to excuse the failure to obtain a warrant, the border
search xs an exception not only to the warrant requirement of
the fourth Amendment, but also to the probable cause require­
ment of the Fourth Amendment.
I would also add chat the Court of Appeals1 opinion
is even internally inconsistent on this point, since it would
°Pening of mailed packages, under the border search
exception, even though such packages, just like envelopes,
could be detained while a warrant was sought.
Now, the Court of Appeals also thought that there
was no great need to allow routine border searches of letters.’.sed envelopes because, unlike packages

or suitcases, there

are limited kinds of materials that can be concealed inside such

18

envelopes„
Again, we think the court's objection totally misses
the mark*

While it is, of: course, true that envelopes cannot

be used to transport certain types of merchandise because, by
law, letter-class mail can't be larger than 24 by 36 inches
and can’t weigh more than four pounds, or sixty pounds if it
is from Canada, these envelopes are an extremely effective
means of transporting other types of merchandise, especially
drugs and pornography, which need only be brought into the
United States, a small quantity at a time, fco.be of substantial
value „
The statistics we have reproduced at Appendix B of
our brief bear this out because they show that the number of
seizures of these prohibited articles from letter-class mail
dwarfs the amount found in package mail coming from overseas»
QUESTION:

Mr* Geller, do you think there is any

question about our right to consider the statistical-material .
you've submitted?
MR. GELLER:

17e don't, Mr. Justice Stevens.

This

was the subject, if the Court will recall, of a motion to
strike that the Respondents made.

We filed a memorandum in

opposition to that motion to strike in January and the Court
denied the motion.

I would refer the Court to our memorandum

in that regard, if it has any qualms, but we think that the
reasonableness of the bord er search power in this case does not

19
depend in any way upon the reliability of those statistics.
But I would add that we think that those statistics —
QUESTION:

Then we probably don't need to look at

them, if that's —»
MR0 GELLER:

Nell, that's correct, and we only

provided them because the Court of Appeals for the first time
made certain, what we thought

unfounded,assertions about how

easy it would be for the Government to comply with the require­
ments that they were setting up in their opinion.

And it was

only to combat that assertion that we provided the statistics.
We think the statistics are reliable.

We've explained in our

brief and in our memorandum how they were arrived at, and I
would add, in addition to that, this is not an unusual pro­
cedure»

We frequently supply this Court with the best avail­

able statistics that the Executive Branch has when we think It
might be helpful to this Court's resolution.
But, as I said at the outset, Mr. Justice Stevens,
we think that the border search power that was exercised in
this case was reasonable under the historic and traditional
footings, regardless of whether you accept the reliability of
our statistics.
Now, the single factor that most influenced the
Court of Appeals' decision was the notion that letter mail may
contain correspondence, whereas package mail does not.
The court thought, and I am quoting now from page

20
11A of the Appendix to our petition, "The mere knowledge on
the part of individuals of the practice of routinely opening
letter mail inhibits the exercise of free speech."
Vie submit that there is nothing to this concern on
the part of the Court of Appeals,

First -«* and 1 cannot

emphasize this point too strongly -- customs officers are
prohibited from reading correspondence.
Although the Court of Appeals sprinkled its opinion
with references to the practice of routinely opening letters*
there is absolutely no routine practice by the Customs Service
of opening envelopes containing written matter.

The authority

of customs officials to open international mail is strictly
limited, by law, to envelopes that they have reason to believe
may contain merchandise.

Beyond that, if an envelope that

appears to contain merchandise is opened for a customs inspec­
tion, and it is found to contain

not only goods but also

correspondence, customs officials, similarly, are prohibited
by law from reading the correspondence.

There is a specific

customs regulation that covers this situation.
19 CPR

145.3, which is reprinted at page 2A of our

brief, states that, “Mo customs officer or employee shall read
or authorize or allow any other person to read any correspon­
dence contained in sealed letter mail of foreign origin, unless
a warrant is obtained,"
QUESTION:

What do they do with the letter?

21
MR. GELLER:

They do not read it* Mr, Justice

Marshall.
QUESTION:

Well, what happens to it?

MR, GELLER.:

Any envelope that is opened is stamped

as having been opened and then it Is sent on its way —
QUESTION:

It has to be stamped?

MR. GELLER:

It is stamped under the customs proce­

dures. i
QUESTION:

Sometimes you see something you would

wonder what happened to the -letter.
MR. GELLER:

Well, the current customs procedure,

after an envelope is opened* is to stamp the envelope.

If

there is nothing subject to seizure in the envelope* the
envelope is resealed and sent on its. way.
in there* it is left untouched.
QUESTION:
MR, GELLER:

If a letter is found

It is certainly not read.

What is it stamped?

Opened?

It is stamped that it has bean opened*

that is correct* and I think they put the date and time on it*
in addition.
Now* in light of the previsions I’ve just outlined*
we contend that there is no justifiable reason to promulgate
a broad rule prohibiting warrantless customs inspections of
letter-class envelopes for fear of a chilling effect on
freedom of expression.
The customs statutes are not intended to restrict or

22
inhibit freedom of expression, and people who desire not to
have their international mail opened at the border can easily
avoid that result simply by not sending their letters in
envelopes so bulky that they appear to contain something;
other than correspondence.
For example, they may use an airgram, which is
frequently used In international mail.

It is a thin piece of

onion-skin type paper, folder into the fora of an envelope.
It is clear that those airgrams contain nothing but corres­
pondence, in the normal case, and they are not opened, because
customs officials have no reason to open them.

They cannot

possibly have reason to suspect they contain prohibited
articles or contraband.
Now, there is nothing in the record in this case
to suggest that such mail is opened by customs officials,
Now, there may, In fact, be legitimate privacy
Interests involved whenever an envelope is opened, even one
coming from overseas, but we believe that these concerns
would, at most, justify a rule that correspondence seized
without a warrant or probable cause cr fruits derived from
the reading of such correspondence may not be admitted into
evidence.
A rule such as this would fully satisfy the possible
invasions of privacy that troubled the Court of Appeals.
we fall to understand how those interests are protected or

But

23

furthered by excluding from evidence merchandise., such as the
heroin taken from the envelopes in this case,
QUESTION:

So far as my right of privacy, I don't

think it has anything to do with whether you read it in
court or not.

I don't think you have any right to read it*

MR, GELLER:

Well, I agree, Mr, Justice Marshall, and

current customs procedures prevent the reading of correspon»
dence without a warrant.
Now, if you are positing the situation of a lawless
customs officer who is willing to violate the statutes and
regulations, I don't think that person would be deterred by
an exclusion of the rule, since he is not reading it in order
to uncover evidence that would later be introduced in court.
In fact, it is especially difficult to fathom why
an exclusionary rule, designed to protect the free flow of
information, should be imposed here.

Respondents have not

argued that their correspondence was read, nor could they.
The eight envelopes opened by Officer Kallnischkies
contained no correspondence.

They contained nothing but

cardboard and heroin.
Whatever inhibitory effect border searches of inter­
national mail may have on others, Respondents were not
exposed to it.
By the way, I should at this point clear up a
hi5.sc oneeption

that arises several times throughout Respondent£

24
briefs«.
We stated in our brief that available statistics
indicate that customs officers discover contraband or dutiable
goods in 20$ of the international letter-class mail that they
open.
Now, Respondents conclude from this statistic that
nothing but correspondence is found in the other 80$.
totally incorrect,

This is

Most of the 80$ of the letter-class

envelopes that are opened and do not contain articles subject
to seizure are found to contain merchandise that, for one
reason or another is not subject to a duty.

For example, a

gift under $10 makes up a large percentage of these letterclass envelopes that are opened.

In very few of the letter-

class envelopes that are opened is nothing but correspondence
found.
This is, of course, what we would, expect since
customs officials are empowered to open envelopes only if they
have reason to believe that the envelope may contain merchan­
dise subject to duty or imported contrary to law.
Now, I want to discuss —
QUESTION:

What if a customs official sees an

envelope that contains nothing thicker than a normal guy's
letter but his experience tells him it might be currency that
would be subject to duty or would be subject to some sort of
prohibition.

Is he, under regulation, free to open that?

25
MR* SELLER:

He Is, under statute and regulations,

free to open any envelope if he has reason to suspect it may
contain contraband or dutiable goods.
In the case you posit, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I
assume he could open that envelope but, unless they have a
specific tip or reason to suspect that something like currency
or microfilm might be included in a very thin envelope, under
current customs practice, those envelopes are not opened.
QUESTION:

There is some risk then, I suppose, that

a customs inspector might think an envelope contained currency
and, in fact, when he opened it up it would contain a letter.,
MR. GELLER:

There is some risk, but under current

regulations he doesn't read that letter and he merely stamps
the envelope as having been opened, reseals it and sends it
on its way.
Now, in response to the question by Mr. Justice
Blackmun, a moment ago, it is true that in 1971 the customs
service, after a consultation with the postal service, changed
its procedures far inspecting international letter class mail.
But these changes represent, we believe, only a
modification of prior practices rather than a drastic break
with the past*

The important fact to be noted is that at no

time in our nation's history, not before 1971 and not after
1971, has a sender or addressee of international letter-class
mail sent into this country, ever had any expectation that that

26

envelope would be delivered to Its destination without being
opened In the presence of the customs service»
Now, from 1924, when the Universal Postal Convention
first allowed dutiable articles to be inserted into letterclass mail, until 1971# the practice of the Customs Cervice
and the Postal Service when they received a letter-class
envelope apparently containing merchandise was as follows:
They would send it cn, notify the addressee to come to the
post office and they would not turn over that envelope unless
the addressee consented to having it opened by the customs
agent standing there.
Now, what this effectively did was to g5.ve a free
reign to smugglers, since, if their envelopes came through
unopened then they had succeeded.

If, on the other hand,

their envelope was stopped and they were notified to come to
the Postal Service and pick it up, they would simply refuse
delivery.

And, under the Universal Postal Convention, at that

point, the letter had to be sent back to the country of origin
unopened, presumably, where the sender could try to send it
again and, hopefully, it would get through a second time.
Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve the
balance of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
QUESTION:

Very well.

Mr, Geller, do you think the drive

a jainst narcotics was in part responsible for the '71 change?

2?
MR* GELLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.» it was*
This Is what I askecl, and I am wondering

why the '71 change.
MR» GELLER:

Obviously, the amount of contraband

coming Into this country began to grow and grow each year
from 1924 to 1971.

In addition, In the late 1960fs there was

a drive to cut off other sources of smuggling.

Vie intensified

our efforts, for example, at the Mexican border, and this all
contributed to making the use of envelopes a much more attrac­
tive way of getting contraband into this country.
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Palmer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN M. PALMER, ESQ.,
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PALMER:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
As we see it, the border search statute concerned,
19 USC 42, the. progenitor of which was considered in the
Carroll case, dees not, when looked at in historical prospective,
allow for the opening of international letter mail.
When you read the statute, in light of its history
and genesis, especially when it was enacted in 3,856 was the
first time that the statute allowed for the opening of trunks
or envelopes wherever found, it is patently clear from a
reading of that statute in its entirety that
the statute only was concerned with trunks or envelopes.

28
wherever found, on vehicle, beasts or persons at the
border,
And,,Indeed, In 1970, when Senator Ervin objected
to these changes that came about in 1971, that were just
discussed, the then General Counsel of the Post Office, and
it is reported at Footnote Number 5 of our brief, indicated
that there are not, and I am

quoting from the Congressional

Record, "There are not statutory provisions dealing specific­
ally with the customs treatment of any type of incoming foreign
mail," thereby rejecting the notion that '19 USC 482 allo’ws fox*
such inspection, at least in the view of the General Counsel
of that department.
QUESTION:

Maybe he didn’t know about the .sfcatute

that appears in the Appendix of the Governments petition for
cert, reciting:

"And to search any trunk or envelope, wherever

found, in which he may have reasonable cause to suspect," and
so forth.

Maybe he didn't know about that.
MR. PALMER:

I find that hard to believe* Mr» Chief

Justice, that the General Counsel of the Post Office, concerned
with customs day to day, would not know or be apprised of
this statute,
QUESTION:

If he didn't know about it, then he was

disagreeing with this statute, wasn't he?
MR. PALMER:
that, but

Well, assuming he didn't know about

29
QUESTION:

Is there any other alternative, either

that he didn't know about it or that he didn't agree with it?
MR, PALMER:

The only alternative I can say is he

knew about it and did not think it applied to the circumstances
at hand„
QUESTION:

He didn't think envelope meant envelope

in the mail?
MR, PALMER;

Well, I think, like I did, he viewed

the history of that statute, the progenitor of it, in 1866.
It is clear that it is only concerned with envelopes or trunks
on persons, vehicles, etcetera, and that the present statute
is merely a shorthand version of it,
I think a reading of it, when the Court gets to
that, will see that is abundantly clear*
Furthermore, the Carroll case alluded to by
Justice Rehnquist, makes another point, insofar as this border
search is concerned.

It spoke of the border search, it was

extrapolating that to the whiskey in the car that they sought
to stop without a warrant, and in viewing the border search
statutes which they said were enacted contemporaneous with
the Fourth Amendment and this nation's history, that even
there, when dealing with the border search, the .foundation
statutes enacted at the beginning of this nation, made a
distinction even where dutiable goods were concerned,were
items that were subject to disappear into the country.

When

30

a man and his trunk can disappear into the country, the
statutes indicated and the court held reasonable exception
to the abhorrent requirement that there was no warrant re­
quired because of the exigency of the situation*

The ;

individual and his wares would disappear into a still rugged
country and for that reason the warrant was not required.
QUESTION:

Let me read you this lanaguage from page

154, the Carroll case, and ask if you think it is consistent
with the explanation that you just gave.
of 267 US:

This is at page 154

"Travelers may be so stopped in crossing an inter­

national boundary because of national self-protection reason­
ably requiring one entering the country to identify himself
as entitled to come in and his belongings as effects which may
lawfully be brought in."
I, myself, don't get any sense of disappearance out
of that language.
MR, PALMER:

Reading the appeal in its entirety, it

is clear that the court in Carroll, in that language, was
speaking about the traveler at the border as he entered and
the danger of him disappearing without the opportunity to get
a search warrant for him or his wares.
And the court in Carroll, itself, as we read it,
drew the distinction when these items, dutiable, that have
come across the border were in a position to be searched, via
a search warrant, the statutes themselves, these foundation

31
statues, required the customs people to, in fact, get a search
warrant, regardless of the fact that these were dutiable
goods that had come across the border and the like.
And I think for that reason the court in Carroll
which was, possibly, one of the only cases that got into this
matter in some detail, clearly makes the distinction between
a movable situation, an ambulatory situation, and a permanent
situation.

And, in fact, that was the basis for its ruling

under the Volstedfc Act, in saying that the car, because it
could disappear, there was no warrant required.
QUESTION:

My point is that it seems to me that

justification offered for the border search in Carroil is
quite different than the justification offered for the search
of the automobile.
MR, PALMER:

Well, I think, the two coincide, as I

read the opinion.
In any event -QUESTION:

If you know, at the moment, in the

sequence of the passage of these various provisions, at what
stage did this lanaguage come in:

"Customs employees have

the responsibility for resealing or repacking mail of foreign
origin following customs examinations"?
MR. PALMER:

That wouId be a regulation, I would

think, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

You don't know at what stage that came ir

32

in terns of the sequence?

You were speaking of the 18i:6

statute and —
MR, PALMER:

I am not sure of the exact date,

Your Honor, but we have it laid out in our brief.
QUESTION:

What happens if the Government has just

held the letters?
MR, PALMER:

That's one of our points, Your Honor,

Under the VanLeeuwen doctrine, nothing would have
happened.

They had the right to hold it for up to twenty-one

hours ~~
QUESTION:
hold it forever.

No, no,

I said hold it forever.

Just

Who could complain?

MR. PALMER:
QUESTION:
MR, PALMER:

I think the addressee.
What about the addressor?
Of course.

I think he could complain

that his mail was not being delivered,
QUESTION:

You mean people corne over from Thailand

and object?
MR. PALMER:

Well, in a particular circumstance,

in this case, possibly, they wouldn't.

But we are talking

about mail, as such.
QUESTION:

So if they just held it, you know and I

know that people wouldn't have come for it,
MR, PALMER:
QUESTION:

Probably not.
So everything would have been fine.

And I don't believe —
QUESTION:
MR, PALMER;
QUESTION:
MR, PALMER:

The limitation comes from where?
Excuse me?
Where does the limitation come from?
I think the limitation comes from,

as far as we can gather, the historical factors concerning
the border searches and the question of exigence or whether or
not there was time to obtain a warrant.
The Carroll case, as we alluded to, clearly makes
that distinction.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose, Congress can. limit its

own power of the Government, can it not?
MR, PALMER:

Of course,

34
QUESTION:

Has it?

MR* PALMER:

Well, in this situation, with these

statutes — the Government is relying on these statutes and,
as counsel indicated, in getting, allowing for the opening
of the mail.

So if that is true, there would be that limita­

tion that was extant.
Now, historically, for the first one hundred and
nlnety«five years of this nation's history, never did the
customs people, acting alone, seek to open this kind of mail,
letter mail.
there.

They delivered it, required the addressee to get;

If he refused it was sent back, or they could get a

search warrant, If they sought to enter the privacy thereof.
But, never, in this nation's history, until 1971* did the
customs people ever exercise the power that was exercised in
this case, to enter the mail.
QUESTION:
MR. PALMER:

Where do you get that from?
The Government's brief, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I didn't see it.

QUESTION:

Mr. Palmer, may I just be sure I understand

your position.

I'll get it.

You say that the statute quoted at the top of

Appendix A, the 1866 statute, cannot properly be construed to
authorize opening of mail.
MR, PALMER:
QUESTION:

That is true.
And is it your submission, therefore,

chao there is no statutory authority for the Government opening

35
letter class mail?
MR. PALMER:
authority.

I believe there is no statutory

There were some regulations passed.

The Treasury

Department and Customs got together and proposed some regula­
tions but —

MR. PALMER:

MR* PALMER:
QUESTION:

But there is no statutory authority?
That is our position.
That is your position.
Yes, sir.
In addition, your position would have

to be that it takes — for that position to have any meaning
would be that statutory authority is required before the
Government may open letter class mail, I take it.
MR, PALMER:

Under the present situation, it would

appear that would be true, if that power existed, and we are
not conceding it does exist, Your Honor.
Now, insofar as the Court of Appeals below, Judge
McGowan joined by Judge Tamm —
QUESTION:

Mr. Palmer, I am sorry to interrupt

again, but on the statutory point, your argument is, as I
understand It, the word "envelope" means an envelope brought
in by the traveler as he returns to the country.
MR, PALMER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
If that’s correct, what about statutory

authority for parcels sent through the mail?

36
Is there any statutory authority for that? You seem to concede,
as I remember your brief, that that may be open.
a long practice of doing it.

There is

Is that within this statute or

on some other statutory basis?
MR» PALMER:
this statute.

I don't think it probably comes within

There are probably some regulations that allow

for the opening of that, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

Regulations didn't allow for the opening

of this, of letter class mail,
MR, PALMER:

But the regulation really doesn't limit

or confine or upset the opening of these packages, as we see
It, but they cannot expand the right to open the first-class
letter type mail.
QUESTION:

I understand.

Vie all understand.

It is

a constitutional argument, but I just I'jant to be sure that
your claim is there is no statutory authority for this.
MR. PALMER:

I just want to point out that the

letters — If you want to see the letters that were involved
here, there are color photographs taken by the FBI, exhibits
on appeal which can be clearly seen in this ease.
Now, the Government and the court below 'were con­
cerned about the invasion of privacy, the right of free
expression.

Now, the Government, by its own figures, indicates

Wow, we suggest that that severely limits, Inhibits,

It tends to chill expression.

Now, the Government said, well, they really don't

short answer to that can be found in this Court's opinion in
Wolf v, Mc-DonaId, 418 US, at page 539.
client letters were sent Into the jail.

In that case, attorneyIt was claimed this

violated First Amendment rights, chilled the expression there­
of.
This Court held that that regulation was all right,
because the inmate was required to be present at the time.
This Court said: "Neither could it chill such communications
since the Inmates' presence insures that prison officials
will not read the mail."
By inference, we can assume that if the inmate was
not there to insure that, serious questions of chilling that
communication would exist.
Now, that is in the context of a totalitarian
environment.

Individuals locked up.

Now, in a free society, we can expect no less, that
when its mail is opened there are some safeguards to insure
that the petty officials, these customs officers, we are not

left to their whim and discretion to open this mail.
QUESTION:

Don't you think there is some difference

between domestic mail* between a lawyer and his client who is
in prison and mail that is coming in from a foreign country
that must pass through the customs inspection?
MR. PALMER:

No* Your Honor* I think if I am

receiving mail from overseas — I received a letter not too
long ago from England* from a friend who wrote to me — I
think I have the same right of privacy that inheres in that
communication to me* and a petty customs official* I don't
believe* should have the right to open that mail as his dis­
cretion and whim.

For the first 195 years, or thereabouts, until
1971 , if incoming mail was suspect, It was delivered to the
post office closest to the addressee and then the postal
people notified the addressee to come there.

The very same

presence that we have in the jail situation, so I find no
difficulty, we find no undue burden, because until 1971 that
practice was uniformly followed in this country.

Until, in

1971,* the Post Office and Customs people got together and
formulated a regulation changing that.
For what ites worth, of course, your client's
’’correspondence" — that's in quotations -- was nonexistent,
as I understand it.

There waq no writing in the envelopes.

MR. PALMER:

That is quite true, Your Honor, but,

they think it concerns something in addition to correspondence.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING R. M. PANZER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PANZER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I think it is important to realize, first, that this
is the first time in this Court's history that not only this
question but, apparently, any question of the search and
seizure power at the border, with regard to goods or letters,
has ever come before this Court.
Much has been said about Carroll v. United States.
That was a 1924 case.

That case, that quotation, is pure

dictum.

■ ,
•<

You may recall £hat in that case, it was a pro­
hibition case, a moving automobile, apparently carrying
liquor moving between Detroit and Grand Rapids, • The onlyquestion in the case — it had nothing to do with the border.

41

It had nothing to do with customs, it had nothing to do with
letters.

The only question in that case was whether there

was probable cause for the search and seizure»

But in the

context of the opinion, it is true, that fete quotation read by
Mr. Justice Rehnquist was made.
And 1*11 also concede that that quotation has been
much adverted to by this Court,

I don*t want to deny that.

But this Court has never held that there is a border search
exception, as it has been described here today.
in its history,

Not once

-

I find no basis in this Court's opinions for saying
that the Fourth Amendment does not operate at the border.
✓

I

think some of the language that we've heard here this after­
noon suggests that.
I don't believe that the Fourth Amendment does not
operate at a certain place in this country.

I do think that

the way this Court has approached other search and seizure
cases and particularly the border patrol cases, tells us that
when vie look at a case like this, we use a discriminating
standard „
If there is a, so-called, border search exception,
it cannot be a blunderbuss exception for everything that
crosses the border, whether there is a need for it or not.
I do not believe that this Court would sustain a position
like that.

We had that

Do you say there is a probable cause

standard at the border* itself?
MR, PANZER:

Well* I think we look at this as a

number of different situations at the border* rather than say
that everything that crosses the border* whether it moves or
not* is detainable or not* is subject to an exception from the
entire Fourth Amendment,
For example* persons crossing the border — the

so?

border patrol cases* one has „the right to make a stop* to ask
a person for his identity papers* or something of that sort,

No, but that is too intrusive, too

If one were to stop and detain any number of

a letter or an envelope, in your view, would the envelopes
that were involved in this case and were opened, the ones
which were 42 grams in weight, and so forth, would there have
been probabl? cause to open those, under Judge McGowan's
Footnote 8, in your view?
MR* PANZER:

I recognise that he comes very close

to suggesting that there is probable cause, but I must dis»
agree with that*

The mere fact that a letter is bulky and

conies from a suspected country it not, in my opinion,
probable cause, no*
QUESTION:

So, you say no,

MR. PANZER:

1 say no.

Incidentally, if the Court would like to see the
size, the very size of the letters we are talking about,
I have prepared these.

Five of the six letters were this

size, which is Just an ordinary common-sized envelope, and
the sixth was this size, which is something like a Christmas
card, large Christmas card.

And it is important to realize

that the inspector said that these were letters.
think these were packages.

He didn't

He didn't think they contained

anything but letter type mail,
QUESTION:

Wasn't there at least one of them that

he thought there was something like sugar, powdered sugar, or

49
something?
MR. PANZER;

Well, that's true.

something else in there.
QUESTION;

He said there was

But* in response to a question --

Didn't it respond to the law of gravity

when he tipped it to one end and the material went to the
far end, something along that line?
MR. PANZER; No* he didn't say that, Your Honor.
He said that he often makes that test, but could not recall
whether he had done it in this case.

All that the record

reveals" for his cause in this case was that the letters came
from Thailand and were bulky, nothing else.

I don't think

that rises to probable cause, Your Honor.
Counsel for the Government told you that they do not
rely upon the statistics in their brief.

That's interesting

because they attempted, in effect, to intimidate the Court by
telling you that a billion envelopes come in every year, they
only have a handful of inspectors, they can only do so much
work a day, and if you don't give them this power, if you
do not exempt an entire category, a stupendous category,
namely, all international mail — If you do not exempt this
from the Fourth Amendment, we are going to be overwhelmed.
How, they told you this in AImeida-Sanclies about
illegal aliens.

They told you this in United States District

Court about the national security, and they have told you this
in case after case.

50
The Court of Appeals suggested that the problem was
not at all that difficult, and I agree with the Court of
Appeals.

1 think the burden is upon the Government to say to

this Court that there is no other way to do this.
How, if they could tell you that, perhaps I would
reconsider, but I think if we can think of some other way to
protect our Government’s interests, then you ought not to
exempt a stupendous category of mail, entirely, from the
Fourth Amendment.
Are there other ways to do it?

Probably there are,,

Judge McGowan,in the Court of Appeals, suggested a number of
different ways.

One was the oral testimony of the agent to

the magistrate, which if made upon a record, I take it, if
recorded, would satisfy constitutional requirements.

He said

if the problem was large enough you could station a magistrate
at Kennedy Airport or wherever else the problem existed.
And there are other solutions, perhaps.
that in AImeid a-Sane heg
QUESTION:

We recall

—

Do you know how far Kennedy Airport is

from Foley Square, where the Federal Court is?
MR. PANZER:
QUESTION:
MR, PANZER:

It is a distance,
About $10 in taxi fare,
Well, the Government has a deep pocket,

but if they wanted to station a magistrate at Kennedy Airport
that would solve the problem

51
Another possible solution, akin to the one in
Camara y, Superior Court, and like the one Mr. Justice Powell
suggested when he concurred in AImelda-Sanchez, a type of ares
warrant.

Now, in Camara, it was an area warrant for certain

houses.

In Aimelda-Sanches, it was suggested that perhaps if

certain roads were well traveled and well suspected to be
used by illegal aliens, that a. warrant would lie for those.
Well, I suggest that here if the Government can
show that a certain country or a certain place in a country,
certain types of letters, certain handwriting, certain type­
writing, whatever it rosy be — If the Government can show
that, that perhaps a type of warrant would lie for that.
QUESTION:

To whom should that showing be made?

It sounds like a legislative determination to me, that you
are describing.
MR. PANZER:

No, I think it could be made to a

i

magistrate.

If the area warrant could lie In Cams.ra and if

the alien warrant could lie in Almeida-Sanchez, I don't see
why this wouldn't lie.

If you can't make that, then you can't

prove probable cause, and I don't think you should have the
right to open envelopes,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Geller, you have two minutes left.

52
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OP KENNETH S * GELLER, ESQ . ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, GELLER:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
QUESTION:

Mr, Geller, will you summarize, once

more, what the Government did prior to 1971?
MR, GELLER:

Yes, Mr, Justice Powell.

Prom 1924 -» 1924 was the first time, under the
Universal Postal Convention, that dutiable articles were
allowed to be inserted into letter class mail.

Before that,

you couldn't do that.
From 1924 until 1971a when a piece of letter class
mail came into the United States and it appeared bulky enough
to contain something other than correspondence, there was
reason to suspect it contained merchandise, and it didn't
have a green label on it.

If it had a green label, that

would have been a consent to search from the sender.

If,

under all those circumstances, the letter came in, the , .
addressee was notified that a piece of mail addressed to
him had been received and that there was reason to suspect
it contained merchandise, subject to duty or contraband.
t

He came to the post office and the envelope would not be
surrendered to him unless he consented to have the customs
1

service open it.

And that was che pract ice foexore 19<

*

There has never been a practice of delivering these letter

53
class* these bulky letter class envelopes without opening
them o
The only difference now is that we open them at the
border rather than giving smugglers the opportunity to receive
delivery and escape detection.
Now* in response to Mr, Justice Stevens’ question
about the statutory authority* I don’t know if there really :1s
a serious question here.

It is hard to understand why Congress

would intend to exempt envelopes or packages,—no one disputes
that packages can be opened — from customs inspection.
Certainly the Postal Service and the Customs Service have
considered for the last 100 years that they have had this
authority.

This Court considered in Cotshausen In* I think*

1882* that they had that authority.

And in none of the

Court of Appeals cases* has anyone ever questioned the
statutory authority to open envelopes, letter class envelopes
or packages.
QUESTION:

But* isn't the reason nobody question it

that the Government didn’t do it?
MR, GELLE.R:

The Government has been opening

packages —
QUESTION:

Well* they took it to the man and said*

"Will you give me your consent?"

If he said no, they wouldn't

open it* so they didn't have the problem.
1-i.kv CALLER:

Packages have always been opened at the

54
border without the addressee being present ~~
QUESTION:

I am talking about envelopes., though.

Nobody has ever questioned the authority to open
packages.
MR. GELLBR:

That’s correct.

In fact* I believe, Cotshausen was a — might have
been considered a package, rather than an envelope under the
Court of Appeals standard.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case Is submitted,
(Whereupon, at 3>'03 o’clock, p.rru, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
