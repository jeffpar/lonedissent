Within eight aa•ts, a numher o~ intervenors cmne
in, attenpted to intervene, and the Di$trict Court held
intervention was untim~ly because, since class had been
denied, the tolling which had occurred on the filing o~ the
suit was retroactively untolled, 3nd since the eleven <lays
had long since e-.;roired, they were late.
The intarvenors then appealed tho denial of :'.nte1:vention.

It ,1t.i·nate:iy came to this r,ourt:, ano. the Court

held that o" U.e ': il inq -- e:..:al\' ined t'h<.! pr.,ctice under Rulc23 prior. to i:.hc 1966 amendr..ar.ts, one-way interveni:.ion

And as 1 inclicated, the f;_rst suit filed, two

not a class act.ion.

Class action didn't come until 1"170.

Well, now, what is the application in this circumstance of the principles of 1\merican Pi:oe?

It is our position

that when the Court den~.ed class in June of l 'l72 -- excuse
