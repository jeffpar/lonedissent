MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next In 74-635, United States against Rose Wong,
Mr, Sheehan,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. SHEEHAN, ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR, SHEEHAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit.

That

court affirmed the order of the United States District Court
suppressing, for use In evidence in Respondent's perjury prose­
cution, the testimony that she previously gave before a grand
jury.
This case and the next one following it both Involve;
the broad question whether the Constitution requires that the
Government give any sort of warnings to grand jury witnesses
when the Government has reason to believe that the witness may
be Indicted on the basis of the testimony that it sought from
him,

This case, however, can be decided, and indeed we
think that it should be decided on a more narrow ground.

For

this is a perjury case and there are special policies appli­
cable In such cases, as this Court recognized last term in
United States v, Mandujano,

Those policies, in our view, apply here and they
warrant a reversal, without consideration of whether warnings
are required..
The facts are these.

On September 7, 1973, the

Respondent Rose Wong, appeared pursuant to.a subpoena before a
grand jury in the Northern District of California.

She was

called to testify as part of the Government's investigation
into gambling and bribery in the Chinatown section of San
Francisco,
The Government already had evidence that she had
paid bribes to certain police officers who were cooperating
with the FBI,

It was thought that she or other persons unknown

to the grand jury might also have paid bribes to other police
officers who were not cooperating with the Government, and it
was, in part, to learn the identify of these other officers
that she was called to testify,
/

When she appeared before the grand jury, the grand
jury foreman administered the oath and right after that the
Government attorney told her what the nature of the grand jury
investigation was and what its purpose was, that it was investi­
gating bribery, and gambling in Chinatown.
She was told that she had been called because it
was thought that she had information that might be helpful to
the Government's investigation.
Ac fcnafc point, the Government attorney gave her a

series of warnings, She was never told that she was required
to answer all the questions that were put to her.

She was

told* instead, that she could refuse to answer any question
that she felt might tend to incriminate her.
repeated twice.

This advice was

She was told this was a constitutional

privilege of hers.

She was asked if she understood and she

said that she did.
She was then told that anything that she said could
be used against her in a subsequent prosecution and she said
she understood.
She was told that she had the right to consult with
an attorney before answering any questions*
understood.
a lawyer.

She said she

She was asked if she had already consulted with
She said she had not.

She was told that she could

stop the questioning at any time that she felt was necessary
to do so.

She said she understood that —
QUESTION:

Mr, Sheehan* I am just wondering why you

are going through these facts.

Didn't the lower court find,

specifically, that she did not understand,and don't we have
to accept that as a.finding for purposes of appeal?
MR. SHEEHAN:

The lower court found, specifically,

that she did not understand the warnings regarding the
privilege.

The lower court found that she did understand the

warnings regarding pur jury, which I was about to say that she
did receive.

That was explained to her, that she would be

6
liable to a prosecution for perjury, and that she understood -«
QUESTION:

Does the case Involve any issue with

respect to the adequacy of the warnings pertaining to perjury?
MR* SHEEHAN:

No, it does not0

I go through this

recitation principally because there is a due .process claim
here that in some manner the Government's conduct in this
particular case was offensive to notions of due process, and
it seems to me important that the Court -QUESTION:

Do you think it is important as to

whether or not the prosecutor deliberately misled her or
simply that she was misled?

Is that critical to the due

process argument?
MR* SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:
guess, rather

We think that the problem

She did not understand is the point, I

—

MR* SHEEHAN:

We think that the proper analysis is

under the Self-incrimination Clause, as I will corae to„
-X think the Government's conduct here is really
beyond reproach*

In fact, her attorney at the hearing on her

motion to suppress said that he was not calling the Government's
conduct into question in this case.
The District Court found that the Government's conduct
was not to be criticized In this case, the conduct of the
Government attorney*

And, indeed, the Court of Appeals found

that the Government had acted in good faith.

7
QUESTION:

I just didn’t quite understand tb*

relevance of the details of the testimony, that’s all, when we
have two very simple, clear-cut findings, as I understood
the record,
QUESTION:

Isn't it true, Mr. Sheehan, that in view

of the District Courts findings that she didn't understand
these warnings that analysis in this case has to proceed upon
the premise that the situation here wa3 tantamount to the
situation that would exist if no warnings had been given?
MR, SHEEHAN:

Yes,

That is correct,

We do not

contend otherwise,
QUESTION:

And that is — So you accept that

premise,
MRa SHEEHAN:

Yes,

We do not contend -- We do not

contest the finding of the District Court that she was unable
to understand the warnings regarding the privilege, and she
was then, in effect, in the position of one who had received
no warnings.
QUESTION:

Is that the predicate for your suggestion

that the case could be decided on a narrow ground?
MR. SHEEHAN:

The predicate for our suggestion that

the case can be decided on a narrow ground is because we think
that it does not matter whether or not she had received
warnings, effective or otherwise.
We think that this case is controlled entirely by

8
United States v» Mandu jano which was decided last term.
In that case, as in this ease* the Court of Appeals had held
that the Government's failure to advise a potential defendant
of the privilege against self «-incrimination was a bar to the
use of the witness" testimony in the subsequent prosecution
for perjury.
This Court reversed* although there were several
opinions.

All of the justices who participated agreed that*

whether or not warnings were required*, a witness could not
commit perjury and thereafter claim that the privilege against
self“incrimination was a protection from prosecution for
perjury.
Indeed* all of the justices were in agreement that
on the facts of the case in Mandujano there was no due process
violation®
The facts here are in all relevant respects the
same and we believe the results should be* as well®
Now* although the Court of Appeals ruled that its
result could not be sustained under the Self-»Incririilnation
Clause* Respondent has argued that* indeed* her position is
supported by the Self-Incrimination Clause®
Accordingly* I will take that matter up first.
It Is well settled that that constitutional
provision does not protect against the crime of perjury»
The opinions in Mandujano to that effect did not state a new

doctrine.
In the Glidesteln case and the Knox case and the
Bryson ease, this Court said that coercion may not be avoided
by perjury»

One central rationale behind those cases applies

squarely here»
In making the statements that are the subject of
the Indictment in this case, the Respondent was not, indeed.
Incriminating herself In regard to a past crime,

She was,

instead, committing a new crime.
However broad the protection afforded by the
privilege, it is not a license to commit perjury»
The Respondent argues that this case is not the
same as Mandujano and that the use of her testimony in a
prosecution for perjury would violate her privilege»
She says that it was important co the result In
Mandujano that in that case the witness had received warnings
and understood warnings, apparently, and that she, not having
understood them and having been in the position, therefore,
of one who had not received warnings, was somehow compelled
against her will to lie in response to the questions put by
the Government attorney»
In our view, it was entirely irrelevant, in Mandujano,
that the witness there had received warnings»

And the reason

that it was irrelevant^is-.'because even if the witness had
been compelled to testify In Mandujano, that would not have

10

protected him from a prosecution for perjury.
In support of this proposition* I rely upon the
cases that the Court in Mandujano relied upon.
those was the Glicksteln.case.

The first of

There the defendant testified

under the compulsion of a statute that granted him immunity.
This Court said that, as a constitutional matter*
the privilege against self-incrimination could be overborne
and the Government could compel testimony, even incriminating
testimony, provided that it granted an immunity coextensive
with the privilege.
The Court then said that as a corollary to the
Government‘s power to compel testimony it must also have the
power to assure that whatever testimony is given in response
to that compulsion would be truthful.
In that case, the statute in question, was held to
confer an immunity no broader than the Constitution and the
use of the defendantfs testimony was upheld, notwithstanding
that he had given it under compulsion.
The Knox case and the Bryson
case are both much
ii <rmnran<n.ini Man
the same.

In Knox, a Federal statute made it criminal for

certain persons to fail to file a certain form.

In response

to this compulsion, Knox filed a form that contained false­
hoods and he was then prosecuted under another statute
forbidding false statements.
Even though, under Marchetti and Grosso, under those

subsequent cases, Knox would have been protected by his
privilege from filing any form at all, his filing of the false
form was held unprotected.
The Court noted that the prosecution was not based
on any incriminatory information that was given in submission
to compulsion*
Neither was the prosecution in Mandu jano, neither
is the prosecution here.
When each of these witnesses responded to any
pressure that they may have felt that they were under by giving
false testimony, that, as the Court said in Knox, was simply
not testimonial compulsion, ■
In Bryson, the Court put the matter quite simply,
’’There is no privilege to answer fraudulently a question that
the Government should not have asked."
There is, therefore, no meaningful difference
between this case and Knox and Bryson and Clickstein.

Whether1

or not they knew that they had a privilege was not important

\

since they could rot realistically have exercised it anyway.
Whether or not the Respondent here knew she had a
privilege also did not matter.
Even assuming then that somehow her failure to know
of her privilege resulted in a situation where the Government
was compelling her to give answers against her will, there is
nothing in the Self-Incrimination Clause that requires that her

12

false testimony be suppressed in a prosecution for perjury.
We turn now to the Due Process Clause which was
relied upon by the Court below*
QUESTION:

May I just ask you this before you

proceed to that point,
Am I correct in my recollection that in the Mandujano
case Mr, Mandujano was advised and informed of his constitu­
tional privilege against compulsory self“incrimination?
MR* SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct and that is the

MR* SHEEHAN:
QUESTION:

You are correct,

That is correct,

And here, we proceed on the premise that

Mrs, Wong was not*
MR, SHEEHAN:

Thatss correct.

Our position is that

even though the defendant in Mandujano received warnings,
whether he understood them or not, whether he received the
warnings or not, was entirely irrelevant to that decision
which was another in a long line of cases in this Court saying
that a response to compulsion by perjury is not protected by
a privilege.
Now, the Court of Appeals, I think, agreed pretty
much with so much of what I have just said.

And they rested

their result, instead, on the Due Process Clause,
We think that the due process analysis adds very
little to the problem.

To the degree that any constitutional

policies would appear to be implicated in questioning witnesses
In circumstances like those here, those policies, in our view,
are fully accounted for by the privilege.
Indeed, the court below did acknowledge as much
when it said that the procedure followed here by the
Government was unfair because of what the court perceived as
"the threats

that it poses to the values protected ,by the

privilege."
That's a quotation from the court's opinion at
page 2A of our Appendix,
Since there have been no values protected by the
privilege that have been violated here, in our view that
should end the case.
But, assuming that there are some values having
nothing to do with the Self-Incrimination Clause, but are
somehow implicated in this case, we submit that the Govern­
ment 's conduct did not violate the Due Process Clause,
’We think it is not automatically unfair to call
before the grand jury a witness whom the Government has reason
to believe is involved in the crime under investigation.
As this Court said in Michigan v, Tucker, subject tc
applicable constitutional limitations, the court is not
forbidden all resort to the defendant to make out its case,
and, indeed, we find support for that proposition in the
Schmerber case and the handwriting and voice exemplar cases.

14

Is is important to the grand jury's task to be able
to call before it witnesses who have some knowledge of the
crime.

The facts in this case are illustrative*

Wheik-the'grand

jury called the Respondent to testify, so far as it knew, it
was facing a widespread system of police corruption ip San
Francisco.
In fulfilling its responsibilities of determining
whether crimes had been committed and, if so{ by whom, the
testimony of witnesses like Respondent who, by virtue of their
involvement in the crime or in a position to know something
about it, is essential to the grand jury{s task.
Thus, we say that -without more it could not have
been a violation of due process simply to call the witness
in front of the grand jury.

Once she appeared, as I pointed

out earlier, the Government's conduct was beyond reproach»
Her counsel said, at the hearing on the motion to
suppress, "I want to make it clear that no criticism is intended
here of the prosecutor who appeared before the grand jury.”
QUESTION;

What page of the Appendix is that on?

MR, SHEEHAN:

That was page 9, Mr. Chief Justice.

On the following page, the District Court said there
couldn’t possibly be any question as far as the conduct of
the United States Attorney is concerned.

And, indeed, the

Court of Appeals said that there was no question as to the
good faith of the Government.

13

The facts here, then, are quite similar to those
in United States ve Mandujano.

In that case, all of the

Justices were agreed that the Government's conduct had not
violated the Due Process Clause*
We think, here, the Government's conduct has not
violated the Due Process Clause*

Mr* Brotsky*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN BROTSKY, ESQ*
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.
MR* BROTSKY:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would assume from the argument of the Government
that the Government would concede that effective warnings
concerning the Fifth Amendment privilege must be given to a
putative defendant grand jury witness.
Although this Court reserved that question, speci­
fically, in Mondujano, I think it has to meet that issue
squarely here.
I think that after cases like Beckwith and Garner,
last term, there can hardly be any doubt that the Fifth
Amendment requires that an uninformed, ignorant witness — that
is ignorant of the Fifth Amendment privilege -- be effectively

16

informed of his rights to decline to answer questions, the
answers to which would incriminate him, or else the Fifth
Amendment would virtually be rendered meaningless before grand
juries.
QUESTION:

IsnJt that the issue in the next case?

MR, BROTBKY:

I believe it is, but I think before

we can complain of what happened to Mrs, 'Wong it has to be
held that she had a right to be warned.
Now, xvhether you consider that a formula to insure
the effective enforcement of the Fifth Amendment or a right
compelled by the Fifth Amendment, I think it must be clear to
this Court, by now, that such effective information to an
ignorant witness subpoenaed before a grand jury is necessary
in order that the Fifth Amendment have any meaning.
Now, that being the case, I think it is also
imporant for this Court to understand that we also rely on the
due process here for our contention that tpe Court of Appeals
was correct in affirming the order of the District Court
suppressing her testimony.
Our position is that Mrs, Wong was placed in a
"cruel trilemma," to use the language of Murphy v. Waterfront
and other cases, without knowing that she had a right to
decline to answer, she had the option only of incriminating
herself or of perjuring herself.
What the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said

17

and what the Government, X think, falls to understand, is that
very trllemma or dilemma, as it has been called, is so unfair,
*

is so essentially wrong, that it, in and of itself, violates
due process.
This is true whether the dilemma that the witness
faces is created by intentional activity on the part of the
Government, declining to inform the witness of the privilege,
or whether, in this case, it comes about despite what I felt
was a good faith effort to do so.
In short, the dilemma, the cruelty, the unfairness,
does not depend on Government misconduct, and I think the
Government misconceives the meaning of due process when it
says that an essential ingredient of a violation of due
process Is that there must be some affirmative misconduct on
the part of the Government.
QUESTION:

Isn't there, possibly, another choice,

even given all of your predicates, namely, to decline to
answer, to decline to answer without attributing any reason
for it, to decline to ans^ve^ as an alternative to lying under
oath?
MR, BROTSKY:

That is available to a witness that

knows that that can be clone, -but when the prosecutor in this
case asked Mrs. Wong

rather when he was asked at the hearing

on the motion to suppress what the situation was in that regard
and when she was asked, and he asked her, she said she thought

18

that she had to answer every question.
I would agree with you, sir, that if she had done
that* ignorant as-she was, that a chain of events would have
been set in sequence that might well have resulted in her
becoming educated because she would then have been subjected
to the contempt power of the court.

In exerting that contempt

power, the court v.'ouid have appointed counsel to represent her
and counsel could then have effectively informed her of her
privilege.
She didn1t know she had that alternative.
Mro Chief Justice.

She answered Mr. Ward when he asked her

at the hearing.» to the effect that, "I thought I had to answer
every question."
So, in that respect, I think she had the alternative!
but she did not exercise it.
QUESTION:

When the District Court elected to

accept her understanding, at that stage, as against her
understanding in the questions that appear earlier before
the grand jury.
MR. BROTSKY:
QUESTION:

Her understanding at what stage, sir?

The scope of understanding — That is,

he relied on her, without an interpreter at the second stage
—- Had an interpreter?
MR. BROTSKY:

Oh. yes, there was an interpreter in

the hearing before the District Court, clearly there was.

19

And her answers were given through the interpreter
as well as the questions put to her through the interpreter.
QUESTION:

But your position is that the questions

and answers set forth on pages 3-^ of the Appendix are now
all foreclosed because the District Court has made a finding
which has been confirmed by the Court of Appeals,
MR. BROTSKY:

Yes*

I believe the cases uphold us

in that position.
Now., if it is true that the violation is one of due
process, and it seems to me clear that the testimony whether
it is exculpatory, as -was the case here, or inculpatory, that
is, self “incriminatory, must be .suppressed.
The reson for that, I think, stems from cases like
Lisenba y» California where the court pointed out that the aim
of the requirement of due process is not to exclude pre­
sumptively false evidence but to prevent fundamental unfair­
ness in the use of evidence, whether true or false.
In short, to vindicate the violation of the Due
Process Amendment which occurred iiere, to correct it, to
deter future instances, it is essential that whether the
testimony given as the result"of this dilemma of this unfair
position In which the witness is placed be suppressed whether
it exculpates or inculpates the witness.
Now, in that respect, I think that there is no
question that the reason --

AFTERNOON SESSION

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr, Brotsky, you may

continue»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN BROTSKY, ESQ»(Cont'd)
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR» BROTSKY;

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
A few words, I think, are in order concerning the
critical distinction between this case and the Mandujano
case»

I think a distinction that Your Honors have recognized

by denying the Government's motion for summary disposition of
this case following the Mandujano opinion.
Mandujano was

aware

of his privilege»

He could have

claimed his privilege, as the Chief Justice pointed out in the
plurality opinion»
QUESTION:

Having that ability, he did not do so.
But we had no occasion to decide in

that case whether any warning was required, did we?
MR0 BROTSKY:
QUESTION:

That's correct,

Because it

MR» BROTSKY:

was

clearly given on the record.

C orrec t.

So, in ManduJano there was no either dilemma or
trilemma»

There was no subjecting of the witness to this

unfair, cruel, if you will, situation.
i

QUESTION:

Mr. Brotsky, in connection with your

21
due process argument, would you think that a warning as to
other privileges, other than the self-incrimination privilege,
might be required, say, such as the attorney-client privileged
MR* BRCTSKY:

I, personally, think that such a

warning is equally, perhaps not equally, but it is essential,
as well»

I think that if you warn of the -«* or advise of

the —• Fifth Amendment privilege, because of the intricacies
of the privilege, it would be appropriate and consistent with
the purposes of the amendment, and particularly to avoid
distinction between those who can afford counsel and those who
cannot.
QUESTION:

If your due process argument stands on

a separate ground from the privilege, it pretty well has to in­
clude any privilege that might be availed of, doesn't it?
MR» BRQTSKY:

I think so*

I think, however, that I should say this»

This

is an illustration of how one violation Is inextricably
linked with another.

The right to be advised of the

privilege flows from the self-incrimination aspect of the
Fifth Amendment, but it Is the failure to advise that brings
into play the due process violation.

Because only where

there Is a failure to advise do you have this dilemma»
So, I would say, then, that when a witness, a
putative defendant witness, comes before a grand jury and is
not advised, effectively Informed of the privilege, you have

22

a violation of the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination right»
That violation, once you ask a question and subject the
witness to the dilemma, or trilemma, that we are talking
about, then becomes a violation of due process»
QUESTION:

Do you think the same analysis would

apply to a witness the Government does not expect that it
might indict?
MR» BROTSKY:
QUESTION:

No.

Why not?

I think there is —
I thought you said you really

weren't relying on the conduct of the Government.
MR* BROTSKY:

I think I am distinguishing,

Mr. Justice White, between the conduct of the Government and
the objective reality which the Government has before it.
In this case, —
QUESTION:

Well, what about the ordinary witness

that the Government doesn't really know about?

They just

call him as a witness, but, as a matter of fact, he does
have some problems about self-incrimination,

He is not

advised or warned and he is asked some questions.

In his

own mind, his choice is either to refuse to answer, to
incriminate himself or to perjure himself.
That's the way it is, as a matter of fact.
MR. BROTSKY:

I think that I would have to answer

you with what Mr. Justice Brennan said In the Mandujano
case:

"That presents the most difficult situation."

23
But I don't think we have to reach that
all.

here at

I think we can define what we mean by a putative

defendant in terms of what the Government knows when it calls
the witness»
QUESTION;

So., you think there Is a substantial

dimension to your case, based on the Government's conduct,
namely, its knowledge and its calling him as a witness and
not informing him clearly?
MR. BROISKY:

Yes0

I think that is an ingredient,

essential ingredient, of our case.
QUESTION;

Mr* Brotsky, precisely, what do you think

the witness should have been told?

What was the information

that the witness should have been —
MR. BROTSKY;

I think she should have been told,

either through an interpreter or in language that would
have effectively told her, that she had a right to decline
to answer questions, based on her Fifth Amendment privilege*
QUESTION:

Nothing more than that?

In other words,

you do not suggest that she should have been told that there
may be a possibility that this grand Jury is going to indict
you,"
MR. BROTSKY;

Let me leave that to the case that

follows, Mr. Justice Brennan,
I don't think I have to reach it in this case,
rather not be philosophical,

I'd

I am concerned about Rose Wong,

24

As a matter of academic interest, yes, I believe,
that more than that is required*

As a matter of fact, I,

personally, believe and concur with your position that a
knowing and intelligent waiver of an informed

by an

informed defendant — is essential if we are to preserve
Fifth Amendment values*
QUESTION;

But that doesn't arise in this case*

I take it then, you are equating this

as a parallel to the Miranda type of situation*
MR* B.ROTSKY:

Only in this respect, Mr, Chief

Justice,
I agree completely that the grand jury setting is
different, wholly different, from the custodial interrogation
in —
QUESTION:

I didn't mean as to the setting,

I mean

as to the concept of the right and the waiver aspect,
MR, BROTSKY:

Yes, I think that, without reaching

the waiver problem because it isn't presented here, I think
that the coercion inherent In custodial interrogation which
compels the suspect to talk is assumed before the grand jury.
When you are subpoenaed before the grand jury, you must talk.
You've got to answer every question, as Mandujano makes very
plain and as it reminds us,

This has been the rule since the

Republic was founded,
QUESTION:

But Mandujano also said -- the Court said

in Mandujano that the oath, itself, is a warning.

Did the Court

25
not say that?
MR. BROTSKY:
QUESTION:

Yes, and, frankly —

Now, in the Miranda setting, there Is no

oath and there is no anticipation one way or the other that the
subject will tell the truth or tell falsehoods, is there?
MR. BROTSKY:

And the person in the Miranda setting

could tell falsehoods without, perhaps, becoming incriminated,
certainly not in a perjury sense, could they?
MR, BROTSKY:

That's right.

But Miranda also teaches, Mr, Chief Justice, that
whether the statements made, following the failure to observe
the Miranda, ritual, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, may not
be used.

But the difference between Mrs. Wong's situation and
Mandujano's situation was that he knew that he could decline
to answer.

She did not.

She had no other alternative than

to either incriminate herself or. perjure herself, either
exculpate or inculpate herself.
QUESTION:

Mr. Brotsky, is she a pauper?

MR6 BROTSKY:

She is not a pauper,

26
QUESTION:

She wasn’t when she was called?

MR* BRQTSKY:

Well, I can’t say that*

She did not

have an attorney when she was called and when she retained me
she paid a modest fee,
QUESTION:

What significance if a person who is not

a pauper does not have a lawyer?
MR* BRQTSKY:
QUESTION:

What is the significance?

MR a BRQTSKY:
QUESTION:

I think that —

The significance —»

If a person can hire a lawyer and

doesn’t hire one, then who is to be blamed for that?
MR, BRQTSKY:

I think that may well be true*

On

the other hand, as I said, until you are informed of your
privilege under the Fifth Amendment, you are in a position of
having to answer incriminatory questions.

And that is the

situation of Mrs* Wong,
QUESTION:

But you could get the advice of counsel*
!

MR, BRQTSKY:
QUESTION:

You could.

There is no doubt*

If you had money enough*

MR* BROTSKY:

That’s right.

And, perhaps, it could

be said that she could be criticized for not having consulted
an attorney before going to the grand jury.
QUESTION:

Is there anything to be said, at all,

Mr* Brotsky, for the notion that any citizen, any person,
called before an official body, even without understanding, as

27

you argue, there was a lack of understanding here* should
understand that they must tell the truths in terms of whatever
they tell*
MR; BROTSKY:

Ho question about that»

The thing that I think this Court has to confront
is x^hether, when the choice is between the truth or incrim­
inating oneself* or as in this case since she did come from
Chinatown and since there is a tradition in Chinatown that
informers are physically retaliated against* she had even
more of a subjective reason to fear inculpatory statements0
She feared physical harm to herself or her family*
There is no question* Mr* Chief Justice, that it is
essential that people tell the truth.

But I don't think that

our Constitution falls to distinguish between those who,
knowing of their rights, knowing they can keep quiet, then
deliberately tell falsehoods, and those who have no such
;2

option,

I think there is a real distinction,
QUESTION:

That argument would carry greater weight,

perhaps, if you were talking about the person testifying in
public in the trial of a case.

Here, the testimony was in

the secrecy of the grand jury room which is protected,
MR, BROTSKY:

Of course, had she told the prosecuting

attorney what he wanted to hear, she would inevitably been
called,

His purpose was to find out what she' knew so that

he could utilize her testimony in a trial against the officers

28

that he claimed were -QUESTION:

When you say what the prosecutor wanted

to hear., you mean that he was seeking to have her say that she
had, indeed, bribed the policeman?
MR„ BROTSKY:

QUESTION:
taliation,

That's corrects

That's what he wanted

And that that would expose her to re­

Is that your suggestion?
MR, BROTSKY:

I think that this was a subjective

factor, but I don't think it is necessary to the decision
In this case,

I think the dilemma posed, simply, by incrimin­

ating one's self, versus, perjuring one's self, is a sufficiently
unfair dilemma to call into play the due process guarantee.
Now, I just want to make a few more points.
As I say, there is this connection between the
Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and the
due process violation»
When the witness is effectively not informed and
you have both violations, then ;the question arises:

What is

the remedy?
I think the remedy — and here, again, you have a
distinction between the situation posed by Knox, by Bryson,
where you did not have this dilemma, in the same sense.
Where, in Bryson's case, he could have resigned as
an officer or declined to answer

He knew of his privilege.

29

Mrs, Wong did not know hers*.,
I think the appropriate remedy is to restore the
witness to the position the 'witness would have been in had
the witness known of the privilege and exercised it# namely#
to suppress all the testimony# whether it’s exculpatory —
QUESTION:

Again# these arguments go to almost any

witness# other than just one who is a putative defendant,
MK8 BROTSKY:
QUESTION:

I don't think so# Mr, Justice White,

It does because# as a matter of fact# the

answers might incriminate,
MR, BROTSKY:

If the answers might incriminate# then

I think you are reaching the point where that is true# but *—
QUESTION:

Whether the Government knows it or not,

MR, BROTSKY:

All right,

I agree you are posing the

most difficult question# administratively and philosophically.
But that's not the problem we have in this case -QUESTION:

Put this to an ordinary witness called

in an ordinary# in any lawsuit or in any criminal case# in an
open courtroom,
MR, BROTSKY:

No doubt about it,, tout I know that# as

a practical matter# and in real life.things don't happen that
way.
The U, S, attorney generally knows whether the
^witness that he is calling# generally knows —
QUESTION: He hopes he does.

30

MR, BROTSKY:

All right,

I agree.

But I think that

this is not the situation we have here, nor is it necessary to
decide that question because you have clearly here a putative
defendant.

The finding was to that effect and certainly the

Government has not denied it,
QUESTION’:

Going back to Justice White's illustration

which, I think, is alluded to in the Mandujano opinion, you
are not suggesting tha£ a warning is required if a person is
called in out of the cold to come into a courtroom and testify,
MR, BROTSKY:
QUESTION.:

Civil case, criminal case, whatever,

MR, BROTSKY:
QUESTION:

No,

I am not,

Are they not confronted often with

precisely the same dilemma or trilemma that you mentioned
here, the retaliation, indictment, whatnot?
MR, BROTSKY;
QUESTION:

No, I don't think so.

I think —

They could not be?

MR, BROTSKY:

It's possible,"but-we are talking

probabilities now.
QUESTION:

We are only dealing with the rare cases.

Those are the only ones that come up here.

You've got the

rare case.
QUESTION:

What about the Government who thinks

that a co-conspirator is going to testify against somebody who
is on trial?

And they call him and put him on the stand.

MR, BROTSKY:

Usually that person has an attorney to

represent them or the attorney for the defendant will make sure
they do.
QUESTION:

All I am asking is whether you think the

Government has to warn him?
MR» BROTSKY:
QUESTION:

I would say that «*-

They know he Is Implicated.

MR. BROTSKY:

I would say wherever there is ignorance

wherever there is reasonable ground —
QUESTION:

So your answer is yes the same rule would

apply as you are urging in this case.
MR. BROTSKY:

No, it is not yes.

It is only if the

situation is one in which the Government knows there is
Ignorance or has reasonable cause to believe there Is ignorance
For example, if the person shows up with an attorney,
obviously, there is no cause to believe that the witness is
ignorant *
We are talking about ignorance here.

That's really

what I think we are addressing ourself to., because while -~
QUESTION:

If you put it on a Government ignorance,

they were ignorant here of the fact that she didn't understand
the warning,

I understand that.

Well, then, haven't you given your case

MR* BRGTSKY:

No»

the part of the witness*

1 am talking about ignorance on

If you hav^e a situation where the

witness is, in fact, ignorant*
Mow, when must the Government do it?
you think of the situation here, clearly

I think if

the Government has

to do it here, where they know that the witness, according to
police officers, has offered bribes, paid bribes, is implicated
in the gambling establishment, and where they call her,
precisely, to implicate herself and others*

Clearly, then, it

seems to me, you have to have a warning to that kind of witness«
Now, these other cases are harder.
question about that*

There is no

But in this ease, you don't have those

difficult problems.
QUESTION:

But, Mr* Justice White was asking:

Suppose you had the same facts about Mrs* Wong and she were
called in a trial of Mr, X.
MR, BRCT3KY:
QUESTION:

0h} I think —

— Why isn't it the same situation?

MR» BRGTSKY:

If that's what Mr. Justice White

meant, then I mIsunderstood.
If the Government has no knowledge that the witness
is involved —
QUESTION:

No, no, no.

MR* BRCTSKY:
have to.

Yes.

I think that the Government would

I think the Government would have to advise

QUESTION:

Even though she Is not a putative

defendant?
MR, BROTSKY:
QUESTION:

That's right,

Every time the Government'calls a co-

conspirator or someone on their side of the case to prove a
case against a defendant,, they must give him the warning?
MR. BROTSKY:
QUESTION:

Well,

The Government Is frequently surprised.

They think they are going to get some testimony out of somebody,
a certain line, and it turns out they don't get it*
And let's assume they then prosecute him for perjury.
Do you think just because they thought and suspected or thought
they knew he was implicated in the crime that they had to give:
him warnings, and that they cannot prosecute him for perjury?
MR. BROTSKY:
had they given him

No, I don't think so.

I think that

First, my reply would be what ham does

it do the Government to give the warnings?
QUESTION:

Yes, but the question is whether it Is

constitutionally required.
MR,, BROTSKY:

I understand.

I think the Government

is giving the very warnings here that we are talking about.
They haven't told us why they do It, but they uniformly do it.
I think it is because they recognize that it is essentially
unfair not to.
Mow, if you have the situation you postulated, then

34
I think the Government has an equal duty.

Where the Government

knows that the person is implicated and calls that person with:
the intent and design to extract incriminatory information,
then I think the Government should advise that person of the
person's rights.
Now, in the minute or two that I have left, I do want
to say something about the perjury question.
I think this Court does have and must have a legiti­
mate concern that perjury violations be punished..

But, X think,

again, here there is a difference between the kind of perjury
you have where one is aware of the privilege and instead of
exercising it remains silent, affirmatively misstates or lies
s

to suppress false testimony that is induced by a cruel dilemma
--.and that's what X think happened here — is not to license
perjury.
QUESTION:
false testimony.

We are just talking about suppressing

You are talking about washing out what would

otherwise be a perjury trial, aren't you?
ME0 BRCTSKY:

That?s right, but X am saying you are

merely restoring that person to the position they would be
in had they known of the privilege.
QUESTION:

Before they lied.

MR e BROTSKY:

That's right, because had Mrs » Wong —

I can assure this Court — that had Mrs. Wong known of her
privilege she would have exercised it.

She would have given

no answers to the questions which are the subject of the
perjury prosecution,
What I am saying, therefore, is that if that is the
case and if she faced the dilemma she did, I think this CourtMs
legitimate concern for perjury is not appropriately addressed
to her situation,
I think, as the Court of Appeals said, to suppress
testimony, which in this case exculpated her and which the
prosecutor, thereby, then promptly indicted her for perjury
because it was contrary to information he had — For her to
do that —
QUESTION;

How can you be so positive that she

would not have committed perjury if she knew of a privilege?
Lots of people know the privilege and still decide it would
be better not to act guilty by claiming the privilege then
it would to try and get away with a false story.

How do we

kmottf she didn't simply do that?
MR, BROTSKY:

Mr, Justice Stevens, if you knew

Rose Wong, you would be as sure as I am,
QUESTION;

Well, we only have the record to deal with,

but there is no reason on the record to believe that's the
fact, is there?

M-Rc.
could be.

To say it positively,

BROTSKY:

On the record, I don't see how there

As a matter of fact, in the hearing there was a

question that the judge raised0

Now, the final question would

36
be:

If she had known of her privilege., would she have claimed

it?
And he didn£it ask it because I think he assumed,
after seeing Mrs, Wong., that she would have exercised it,
QUESTION:

If she had been called to the regular

trial of these policemen and asked those questions, would
somebody have had to advise her of her rights?
MR, BROTSKY:
QUESTION:

I think so,

Why?

MR, BROTSKY:

Because I think the Government,

knowing that it is eliciting from her, by its questions,
incriminatory answers, is thwarting the purposes of the Fifth
Amendment and is taking our system of justice and ignoring the
mandate of the Fifth Amendment when one does so, I think that —
QUESTION:

I thought the Fifth Amendment was some­

thing you had to claim,

the situation here, presents an entirely —■

QUESTION:

Why would they have to advise a person

capable of hiring a lawyer to advise them of their rights?
MR, BRGTSKY:

Because I don't think that the fact

that she was an indigent really is relevant here since when
she appeared she was given the option of having an attorney,
QUESTION:

She could have then said, "I'd like to

MR, BROTSKY:

I suppose that's true* but, in any

event what happened -QUESTION:

Well, did she understand that question?

MR, BROTSKY:

The judge indicated she did not.

did not understand,
QUESTION:

Didn't understand any of it?

MR, BROTSKY:

except the perjury,
QUESTION:

Now that we are on the Court's time, let

me ask you one question.

Try to give a brief answer.

What was there at the second hearing, at the
suppression hearing, which alerted someone to the idea that she

38

did not understand English* in the face of the perfectly clear1
unequivocal answers which she gave before the grand jury?
What was the change?

Was there a long lapse of time, that her

English became a little fuzzy, or what?
MR, BRGTSKY:

Mr* Chief Justice, I think you may

have misconceived what happened at the second hearing*
We made a motion to suppress based on the claim that
she did not understand the warning*
QUESTION:

Everyone concedes that there was nothing

to have alerted the grand jury foreman or the United States
Attorney to the notion that she did not understand the
questions when she gave the rather clear answers which appear
in the record on pages 3 and 4»
Now, what alerted someone between that time and the
hearing on the suppression motion to the idea that she did
not understand English very well?
MR* BROTSKY:

Well, *?hen she came to me and talked

to me, I could see that she did not understand English very
well.
I had a different view than the United States
Attorney.

I immediately — I had more familiarity with

Chinatown, San Francisco, than he did.

And he admitted in the

record that he had no such familiarity.
The judge pointed out at the hearing that there
were several times when she answered questions that might well

39
have alerted him that she needed an interpreter.
