MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments next In No. 73-5615, Dominick Codispoti and
Herbert Langnes v. Pennsylvania.
Mr. Dean, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. DEAN. ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. DEAN:

Thank you, sir.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;
Once again there is before this Court the
relatively troublesome problem of the right of a defendant
charged with direct criminal contempt of court to have a
jury of his peers decide the issue of guilt or innocence.
Procedurally, this case is relatively confused.
However, the issues are easily framed and quite clear.
Dominick Codispoti together with Herbert Langnes
and Richard 0. J. Mayberry, came on for trial in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania back in November of 1966 on charges of prison
breach and holding a hostage in a penal institution.
The trial lasted approximately six weeks and
was marked by repeated altercations between the trial judge
and between the defendants.
The defendants were found guilty and were given
a 15 to 30-year sentence on one charge, a- consecutive 5 to 10
sentence on another charge and immediately at the end of the

trial, the trial judge summoned them up and sentenced them
anywhere from 11 to 22 years for contempt of court for the
various statements that had been made in the presence of the
Court.
They then appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed their
conviction with several justices dissenting upon the theory
of cruel and unusual punishment and, since this case had
antedated the Baldwin decision, perhaps on a right to a jury
trial.
QUESTION:

Do you think that the Court wa§ under

Illinois against Allen, could have bound and gagged these
defendants, as we said they could in Illinois against Alien
and then appoint counsel for them, without regard to what
they felt about counsel?

Or appointing, alternatively,

counsel as friends of the court to act for them?
HR. DEAN:

Your Honor, "count advisers," as our
■

court called them in ’66, were appointed

(f[{!

to help these

people who were representing themselves as their own counsel
Whether or not, factually, their disturbances
were so tumultuous that they would require an Allen type of
gagging, I am not really prepared to say because I wasn’t
there.

I have the record there.

The record is in somewhat

a. contention as to exactly what was the genesis of this
confrontation between the defendants and the judge.

QUESTION.

Did you say it took six weeks to

MR. DEAN:

I think it took about six and a half

try this?

weeks, sir, yes.

The trial started in November of *66 and

concluded on, I think, about December the 12th of I966 and I
think that there were a few days that the Court took off for
procedural matters on another issue.

But, essentially, it

was a six weeks trial.
QUESTION:

Not the contempt trial?

MR. DEAN:

Not the contempt trial.

as I said,the cases were procedurally confused.

This was —

originally before the court on a prison breach and holding
a hostage in a penal institution.

During that trial in '66 --

QUESTION:

They committed several contempts.

MR. DEAN:

Contempts — these are the contempts

that are currently before this Court.

And we are involved in this case only

That is right, only with the contempt

What then happened was that they appealed to the
Court of Pennsylvania, which affirmed the conviction

They petitioned this Court for a Writ of Certiorari which
was granted.
This Court heard the case and in January of 1971,
in an opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas, remanded the case back

to Pennsylvania"for a public trial," were the words that were
used.
The case lay dormant —
QUESTION:

Now, was that only Mayberry?

seemed to drag in Codispoti and Langnes with him.

QUESTION:

And what happened to Mayberry?

MR. DEAN:

Mr. Mayberry chose not to go to this

I can't really offer you a rational

explanation of

that action, but we now ---■

No, he is not, your Honor.

QUESTION:
proceeding?

Well, what about this contempt

Was he involved in this?
MR. DEAN:

Yes, your Honor.

What then happened

was, when the case was remanded back in January of '71,
Judge Pick, who was the trial judge in '66 against whom the

7
original contempts were leveled, in — on December 7th of
13715 almost a year later, issued a citation which was to
be served by registered mail upon the three defendants,
scheduling a hearing — separate hearings for each of the
defendants on anywhere from December 12th to December 17th,
Mr. Mayberry went to trial first in front of
Judge Van der Voor-t, then Mr. Codispoti went to trial and
then Mr. Langnes went to trial.

They had separate individual

Individual trials or hearings, depending on how you are
going to characterise it.
QUESTION:

And Mayberry was again convicted,

MR. DEAN.

Mayberry was again adjudicated in

was he?

contempt of court and sentenced,
QUESTION:

And a sentence comparable to the one

that first —
MR. DEAN:

No, your Honor, what occurred in that

case was, that by the expedient of giving a six months
sentence and by making them consecutive, Mayberry was
again convicted on all of the charges that he was originally
cited for by Judge Fiok and given an 11 to 22-year sentence
but Mr. Mayberry came up with something like a — I think a
four-year, two months sentence as

his sentence.

QUESTION:

And he didn't seek review of that?

MR, DEAN:

He again appealed that sentence, as

8
did the other ones., to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court s which
this time affirmed Per Curiam in the judgment of contempt.
However, the judges did dissent, based upon the
United States versus Seale rationale.

At that point*

Codispoti and Langnes petitioned this Court for a Writ of
Certiorari, which was granted, which is why we are now here
in front of this particular Court.
QUESTION:

But Mayberry will serve his four years

and two months, whatever it is?
MR. DEAN:

Evidently, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And he didn't seek review.

MR. DEAN:

I'm his court-appointed counsel.

Mr. Mayberry has refused to talk to me during some of these
proceedings, so I am somewhat hard-pressed to give you a
Viable rationale.
QUESTION:

Well, in any event, .he is not here.

MR. DEAN:

He is not in

front of the Court.

At

this time all we have are Codispoti and Langnes.
It is important, perhaps, to get into some of the
facts of this particular case.

Because of the arguments

advanced, all of the trials of Mayberry, Codispoti and Langnes
were exactly similar.

In other words, I don't think there

was a substantial difference between one or the other.
Mr. Langnes had — or Mr. Codispoti, excuse me,
had come in and requested that counsel of his own choice

9
be there to represent him.

The Court said,, ’’Well, where is

your counsel," and the counsel was from Philadelphia and
Judge Van der Voort said, "Well, he’s not in the courtroom
now.

You have a public defender.

Go proceed with him."

Mr. Codispoti had said that he didn't have any
notice of this hearing, really, until he was brought into
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the morning of the trial, that he
had written the trial judge, Judge Fiok, twice after the
remand saying "What are your going to do?" or words to that
effect and had received no reply.
Mr. Codispoti then requested a jury trial and in
exactly similar language that the Court had used for Langnes
and Mayberry, said the Court, "I regard this issue,
Mr. Codispoti, as an issue between the Court, not any
particular judge, but between the Court and you and I think
the record should speak for the Court and you can speak for
yourself.

I am going to refuse your motion for a jury trial."
Evidently these people had some idea because they

had known what had gone on before.

Mr. Codispoti then said,

"Well, I would like some defense witnesses who were present
during the original altercation between Judge Fiok and
myself present to testify in my behalf."
At the second hearing he was denied under these
words of the Court, "I am going to refuse your motion to
subpoena witnesses for the reasons that I have told you.

I

10
think that this is an issue between the Court and you and the
record will speak for the Court and you and your counsel can
speak for yourself."
single

And this is what has happened in every

trial that came along so with those words , they

denied the right to a jury trial.

were

They were denied the right

to present defense witnesses and they were entitled to speak
for themselves.

The record would speak for the Court.

They weren't even permitted to call the trial
judge, who simply resided maybe 50 or

65

feet in a courtroom

immediately adjacent to the court from where 'the trial was
being held.
That brings us

to the issue here.

They were

found and adjudicated guilty on all of these contempts of
court.

On one of them, they received two months and on one

of the contempt charges, they had received a sentence of six
months.
Mr. Codispoti, for some reason that is not quite
apparent to me, was sentenced to a year for one contempt and
the Court, as set out in the Appendix, had simply said, "We
sentence you to a year for citation number 5,"or whatever it
was.
Approximately a month later, the Court revised
this "rough draft sentencing" to make it clown into six months.
All of the sentences ran consecutively and therefore, they
were imprisoned approximately from two to three years, give

or take a few months one way or the other and that brings us,
somewhat in a circuitous route, but in order to appreciate
the issues here, to the question of whether, when there is a
single trial for multiple contempts that have occurred during
a particular trial, does the person's right to a jury trial
depend upon the aggregate sentence received, in this case,
several years,or does it depend upon the individual sentences
received, namely, a six-months sentence which is
aggregated into a three-year sentence?
We would suggest to this Court that when there is
one single trial, that the appropriate remedy is to look at
the penalty imposed in the total because it makes little
difference to the man who is sitting in jail to say, oh,
you are only in jail for six months, but you are %n jail
for six months ten times," than to say that, "You are in
jail for five years."
It makes absolutely no difference to him in
regards to the length of his incarceration.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dean, when the case was here

before in Mr. Mayberry’s behalf, we were talking about 20
to 22 years then, weren’t we?
MR. DEAN:
sir.

We were talking about 11 to 22 years,

He was given a one to two year sentence on each

contempt.
QUESTION:

And did the opinion devote itself at

•i

?

all to jury trials on this Issue?
MR. DEAN:

No, your Honor, not directly.

'l.he

concluding words of Mr, Justice Douglas were that, it was to
be remanded back for a public trial.

There was some discussion

in the lower court whether the words "public trial" were to be
interpreted as to mean jury trial.

The trial judge, Judge

Van der Voort, decided that it did not mean a jury trial.
QUESTION:

Do you think there is any significance

in our failure to discuss it at all?
MR. DEAN:

Your Honor, I think it would be

presumptuous of me to try to impute a reason to tills Court
as to why they did a particular action in a particular case.
I don't think it does — to answer your question, -however,
I don't think it has any direct significance because I don't
think the problem was centrally before this Court,.

I would

like to think that the words "public trial" me ant la trial by
jury and that the Court did not believe that all■pf a sudden
these people were not to have a jury trial on the1 contempt
charges,
QUESTION:

Incidentally, were there any further

contempt citations during the contempt trial?
MR. DEAN:

There was one, your Honor.

They were

somewhat obstreperous and one of the defendants was given a
chance to recant and he cast, in polite language, aspersions
upon the competency of Judge Eiok and the Judge asked him —

13
Judge Van der Voort asked him if he wanted to recant as to
the mental ability of Judge Piok.

He did that by saying that

ne found somebody of perhaps less mental ability than
Judge Fiok, which was the present trial judge.
I don’t think that was really the recantation
that he expected and he received another six months’ sentence
for that slight outburst.
QUESTION:

Well, I was looking at the material on

page 48 and so forth of the record, but there was no formal
contempt to your man Codispoti?
MR. DEAN:

Yes, your Honor, he was sentenced to

six — I believe it was Codispoti was sentenced to six months
or to Langnes.

I am really not certain which because the

trials were so similar, outbursts occurred.

To my knowledge,

and I wasn’t present at those trials, or most of those trials,
only one of them was given an additional sentence.
You see, your Honor, in some senses,as
Mr. Codispoti said, he had been up there and he had
requested very politely these and then, it’s on page 5 of our
brief, after he had been denied his
QUESTION:

Where did he make the request politely?

On what page?
MR. DEAN:

You mean, within here, sir?

request politely?
QUESTION:

Yes.

The

i4

MI?. DEAN:

You mean for a jury trial and so forth?

QUESTION:

Well., any request that he made

MR. DEAN:

All right, on page four of the brief,

politely.

your Honor, are the — I'm sorry, Appendix 43, excuse me. Is
where in the Appendix it would be, for Mr. Codispoti, he
starts up here — I would say. it would be reasonably polite
as a trial lawyer.

He had requested a jury trial and the

Court said no, you can't have it.

He had then, around pages

4-3, approximately the middle of the case, said that according
to Baldwin versus New York and Bloom versus Illinois and
Duncan that he would like a jury trial and that he had been
given 14 years and he thinks that it was a relatively serious
crime.
At that particular point, the Court said that it
is just between you and the Court.

He then asked for

witnesses and I assume that that was a relatively polite re­
quest..

It appeared nothing cut of the ordinary to me, at least

nothing that would certainly shock the conscience of the
Court or disrupt its procedures.
What then did occur is — well, we have the
evaluation of the trial judge, at least, that he had been
polite because on page 47, Mr.
QUESTION:

Codispoti states to the Court

Going back to 43, where you said

his

conduct was polite, do you regard it as polite conduct when

he suggests to the Court that the judge and the prison
authorities are engaged in a conspiracy to railroad him?
At the bottom of 43?
MR. DEAR:

Well, your Honor, perhaps — all right,

I won't say that is the most polite way.

Polite, I meant,

in response to your question, the failure to use obscene
language.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

MR. DEAN:

The language got to be a little bit —

it would probably make a stevedore blush after awhile.
QUESTION:

Yes, we observed that.

MR. DEAN:

But In any event, he

does state here

on page 47 — there is one thing •— Mr. Codispoti saying and
this is after he has been denied these:
I want to make clear.

"There is one thing

I came in this courtroom trying to be

respectful.

Right?"

And the trial judge answers, "You

have been,"

which is up to that point, Mr. Codispoti?s

behavior, though, perhaps, not within the standards of
conduct one would expect from an attorney, had not been the
obstreperousness that had attended these other litigations
in court and he says, "Now you know that I have 90 years."
And, really, another 10 to 20 years on top of a 90-year
sentence, the words are to the effect. Is not going to
certainly sway him one way or the other.
I think it is Important to understand —

16
QUESTION:

What about the bottom of page 47?

Let's

skip it, read it and then skip it.
HR. DEAN:

Yes, sir.

That's what I meant by

saying that he ;vas relatively polite in the beginning.
Unfortunately, that language did attend most of these
proceedings.

This gentleman, I think, has spent, I would

say conservatively, 25 years in prison and perhaps — in some
sense this is strange.

This entire group has started out

rebelling against prison authorities.

Mayberry was incar­

cerated age 12 .for being a dependent, neglected child and has
never escaped from the penal authorities since.

He has been

engaged in one continuing altercation after- another.
In some senses, trying these people for a contempt
of court case would almost be like beating a masochist with
whips for punishment.

I

mean, you bring these people into a

courtroom and, unfortunately, you are giving them an oppor­
tunity to go on and do things which they don't really have —
QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that they

should not have been brought into a courtroom?
HR. DEAN:

Your Honor, if you want my personal

opinion, I feel they are very sick individuals.
that their conduct is in any way justifiable.

I don't think
I don’t think

it is really the conduct that one would expect of a rational
human being.

I think these people have an extreme problem..

I don't think the legal system is really, within the system

of punishment and imprisonment, the way to effectively
handle these individuals,
QUESTION:

That is what I had in mind when I

was reading pages 46, 47 and 48 in that area when I asked you
whether the judge, if you’d care to say, would have been
justified in binding and gagging them and then having a
lawyer go ahead and conduct the proceedings on the basis

of

the prior record,
MR. DEAN:

In the Judge Van der Voort proceedings

is what you are talking about.

I thought you were originally

talking about the Judge Piok proceedings.
QUESTION:

No.

MR. DEAN:

I am sorry, your Honor.

Eventually,

the defendants were excluded from the courtroom, in the
course of these trials.
QUESTION:

Did the judge have any other choice

under Illinois against Allen?
Did the Court rely on Illinois against Allen, by
the way?

MR. DEAN:
Honor, no.

Not to my direct knowledge, your

I am somewhat hazy on the rationale that Judge

Van der Voort did use to determine whether or not he could
exclude the defendants but, effectively, he did exclude them.
He had them placed in an anteroom with a loudspeaker so they
could hear what was going on for the entire proceedings.

18
But If I might, the situation that we would like
to say is that under situations such as this particular case,
that where people do receive a cumulative sentence, that
there are several strong policy reasons why this Court should
demand a jury trial in an aggregated sentence.
Generally, the reasons for petty cases not being
required to have a jury trial is maybe that they are too small
to really worry about, that a couple of days we can't worry
about judicial economy.

We have to make sure the court

schedule flows well.
But as I suggested to the Court earlier, that
has a relatively hollow ring to a man. incarcerated for three
years.
There is also the problem that generally the
power of the Court to punish direct criminal contempt that
occurred in front of It can be grounded in a prophylactic
rule, that at least it will begin to restore order to the
courtroom In an obstreperous situation, because of the
Immediacy of punishment, it Is to act as a deterrent of
future conduct.
But in this particular case, or in any case,
where the individual contempt problems are accumulated and
then tried, subsequent, or at the termination of the main
judicial proceedings, that prophylactic rationale has no
longer any viability.

19
Finally, the real problem in this is the problem
of judicial abuse.

I was sitting down talking with some

lawyers and they stated to me that ours is probably the only
profession in the world where a trial lawyer can be put in
jail for being late for work because to come late before the
court is well within the competency of the judge to put you
in jail and there is probably no other single profession
where that penalty is imposed for being late.
QUESTION:

Except in the military.

MR. DEAN:

Perhaps on the military.

But often-

times, you are not in the military voluntarily, or at least,
you haven’t been in the past.

It was not a matter of choice,

being in there.
QUESTION:

Most of them are now.

MR. DEAN:

That is probably true at this point,

at least most of them are.

However, once they are in, they

can't necessarily get out at their discretion.
But the problem was that these people viewed,
Codispoti, Mayberry and Langness, have viewed the
authorities, as you stated, Mr.
together, of being

prison

Chief Justice, of working

in league against them, that what they

want is some appearance of impartiality and as the Court
can tell from the way that these proceedings went, Codispoti's
frustration was obviously eminent in the language that we
read from the

Appendix =47, that his problem was that he

everybody’s trial.

I don’t think that is really a

It is not a question legitimately before

But what the problem is, that

at least if there

was a jury interposed between the judiciary who happens to be
not only the prosecutor, not only the person who

presented

the charges, not only the trier of facts but also the imposer
of sentence, to at least get a third party in there in the
fact-finding position, has a lot to recommend it.
And also, it is very difficult oo insulate one
judge who has worked with another judge, say, for 20 years,
and say that he is going to be the completely impartial
arbiter, dispenser of justice that our American legal system
tends to look upon the judiciary.
QUESTION:

Well, but didn't you argue in Mayberry

that that was what should be done there, send it back for
trial before another judge?
MR. DEAN:

Yes, your Honor.

I did not argue

Mayberry originally before this Court but it is my under­
standing that was argued and that is what was done.

It was

sent back for trial in front of another judge, which was
done in this particular case.
What I am suggesting, however —
QUESTION:

You want another judge and a jury?

MR. DEAN:

Another judge and a jury is what we

would like in this particular instance.
There is another question QUESTION:

Did the Mayberry opinion say anything

about this issue?
MR. DEAN:

Now, which Mayberry opinion are you

referring to?
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

— remanded it for a trial before

another judge, a judge other than the judge who tried the
original criminal trial.
MR. DEAN:

QUESTION:

And a public trial.

Did it say any-

thing at all about ~
MR. DEAN:

A jury trial?

QUESTION:

A jury trial.

MR. DEAN:

No, your Honor.

QUESTION:

One way or the other.

MR. DEAN:

No, not to my knowledge.

They did

not say that there was —
QUESTION:

That's my recollection.

MR. DEAN:

— or was not to be a jury trial.

QUESTION:

I take it, Mr. Dean, that if your view

were- to prevail, the other judge would be in a position, if
he had multiple counts in the citation, almost inevitably of
having to have a jury trial because his only alternative
would be then and there to side with hov/ever many of the
counts resulted in guilty convictions.

No sentence would be

more than six months and all sentences would be concurrent,
wouldn’t they?
MR. DEAN:

I am sorry,

I am not sure I under­

stand the exact question or questions.
QUESTION:

Well, I gather, basically you say,

because by imposing consecutive sentences on a number of
counts you get in excess of six months without a jury trial
and, Constitutionally, that can’t be done.

Is that a fact?

MR. DEAN:

Yes, that is right, your Honor.

QUESTION:

And what I am suggesting is, when the

other judge gets as he did here, a citation with multiple
counts

what were there, 11 here or something?
MR, DEAN:

Yes, well, they varied among the

QUESTION:

Well, whatever the number was.

individuals.
Isn’t

his choice whether to have a jury trial going to require him

23
then and there to decide that, no, I won't give a jury trial
because what I'll do, If I find guilty on any count is to
impose not more than a six months * sentence on any count and
make all sentences concurrent.
MR. DEAN:

Your Honor, he can do that.

I don't

think that is a rationale that we want to encourage.
QUESTION:

But do you suggest he could not do

that and deny a jury trial if he decided that he was going —
MR. DEAN:

Obviously, he could do that, your

QUESTION:

Well —

MR. DEAN:

I mean, there is no two ways.

Honor.

The

problem of the six months aggregation rule is that you have
one maybe very serious contempt charge weighted xtflth several
minor charges and. the court, instead of affording a jury
trial on the serious contempt charge, can allocate the
total sentence into six month pieces of pie and thereby
effectively deprive a person of a jury trial.
I do not think the judiciary should be encouraged,
the lov/er court judiciary should be encouraged to deprive
people of jury trials through the manipulative use of
consecutive or concurring sentence.
QUESTION:

Well, what I am suggesting, Mr. Dean,

is I would think, sitting as a trial judge, that I have to
say to myself when I have got 10 or 11 counts in the citation.

24
I'd better have a jury trial since, obviously, if he Is
guilty on any substantial number of them, six months may not
be enough ■— or say to myself, well, I won’t have a jury trial
because I’ll decide now that

however many counts I find him

guilty, I’ll impose concurrent sentences, none in excess of
six months.
MR. DEAN:

I would think that would be an

unacceptable approach to the problem.
Your Honor, if I can, I'd like to reserve my
time —
QUESTION:

I think the subject came up in the

Mayberry case, but I’ve forgotten the answer.

Does Pennsyl­

vania have a statute on obstruction of justice by way of
conduct of this kind?
MR. DEAD:
Honor.

Hot at that particular time, no, your

There is no applicable statute governing that on

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very; well, Mr. Dean.

Mr. Eberhardt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. EBERHARDT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. EBERHARDT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
First, I would like to thank the

Court for the

opportunity to argue this cause before the Court by special

25
leave.
I, too3 would like to first go into some of the
factual background, if I may.

The original contempts in this

case occurred in 1966 during a five or six weeks trial on
prison breach charges in which the three defendants, Mayberry,
Codispoti and Langnes committed -— Mr. Mayberry committed
11 contemptuous acts by citation of the trial judge,
Mr. Codispoti, by citation, five or six contempts and
Mr. Langnes a total of seven contempts.
As counsel for the Petitioner has stated, this
was in 1966.

There was an appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme

Court and affirmance, Mr. Mayberry's pro se petition to
this Court and the final decision by this Court in January
of 1971.
Now, we have set forth in our brief the relevant,
we think, language from that decision as directions to the
lower court and that language, If I may quote, the Court
states that "Our conclusion is that the Defendant — ” to
paraphrase —QUESTION:

What page are you on?

MR. EBERHARDT:
of the Commonwealth’s brief.

On ray brief it is on page 4 and 5
The Court, through Mr. Justice

Douglas, states, "Our conclusion is that by reason of the
due process clause of the l4th Amendment, a defendant in a
criminal contempt proceeding must

be given a public trial

26
before a. judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor,"
c1t1ng In Re Oliver.
"In the present case, that requirement can be
satisfied only if the judgment of contempt Is vacated so that
on remand another judge, not bearing the sting of these
slanderous remarks and having the impersonal authority of
the lav;, sits in judgment on the conduct of the petitioner
as shown by the record."
I quote that because it is very Important to the
actions that the judge — the second judge took when this
case was remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny
County.
QUESTION:

Of course, that was written after this

Court’s decisions in Baldwin and Duncan and Bloom and —
MR.EBERHARDT:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And against the precedent of those

decisions.
MR. EBERHARDT:

Right and I would indicate to

the Court that the reason I bring this out also is the fact
that this case arose prior to many of the decisions that are
argued in our brief and those decisions being the Baldwin
decision and the Seale decision and other decisions that have
come regarding contempts.
The trial judge at the trial for the prison
breach charges was acting only on — the only decision that

'•>

r7

C. f

h,ad come down from this Court had been the Cheff decision
and the trial judge felt that he was acting fully within his
powers in sentencing one to two years.
Now, that sentence was reversed by this Court,
was vacated and the new sentence was imposed by another
j udge.
Now, Judge Van der Voort, who imposed the six
months sentences, no sentence ultimately was longer than
six months against either of these two petitioners, relied
upon the prior decisions of this Court and I might add the
Seale decision had not been decided at the time of the
sentencing of the six months sentences.
Now, on remand, these sentences were imposed and
as the Court has observed, the Petitioners again engaged in
conduct which I would personally categorize as contemptuous
and in the record, on page JG, probably the most "violent act
was recorded when Petitioner Langnes, after being told by
the trial judge that he was holding him in contempt of court
for his language, directed at the Court — threw'a microphone
at the Court.

Fortunately, it did not hit the trial judge

but that indicates somewhat, I think, the type of defendant
that is involved in this case.
But that is not relevant —
QUESTION:
and a separate crime.

That is an assault.

It is a criminal

Why didn't he try him for assault?

28
MR. EBERHARDT:
trial judge in this case.

I don't know the rationale of the
He did not, at that moment,

sentence him for that act of throwing a microphone.

He was

sentencing him for contempt for his language directed at the
Court.
Continuing with the history of the case, the case
then went up on appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and
finally to this Court.

Several reasons were alleged in the

petition for cert, but this Court limited its grant of the
petition to two questions, the first being whether or not the
sentences that were given to these petitioners should be
aggregated in order to determine the right to a jury trial.
The basis for this is that all of these offenses
are somewhat linked as a single offense.
would point out some of the factual

The Commonwealth

things in this record to

show that there were several offenses involved here.
i
'

The trial, as I indicated, did occur over a period
of five to six weeks.

The contempts occurred on various times

during that six weeks period and were not

continuous, but

they were occasional throughout this period.
Mayberry, of course, committed the 11

Co-Defendant

acts, but the

petitioners here, one committed six acts, the other committed
seven acts.
They occurred over a period of six weeks.

It is

the Commonwealth1s position in this matter that they are

identifiable as separate defenses and are not part of one
continuous act and we have indicated in our brief that we
do not look upon the acts of these petitioners as Judge
Cummings did in the Seale case, where the defendant in that
case based most of his contemptuous conduct on the fact that
he was deprived of his right to counsel during the trial,
the particular counsel that he wanted, and that all of the
actions of the defendant in the Seale case were premised
upon that fact.
Here, the petitioners engaged in several
different acts of contempt directed toward the Court and
based on various things that they found to be objectionable
during the trial.
I would point also to this Court’s prior opinion
in the Mayberry case for a solution to the question of
impartiality.

The trial judge in the original prison breach

trial against whom the contempts were directed was found by
this Court to be not capable of being impartial because of
the acts the Defendant committed and aimed at the trial judge
We have a proceeding on remand before another
trial judge.

That trial judge cannot be said to have been

affected by the acts of the petitioners and although the
transcript of the Mayberry proceedings are not before this
Court, in the hearing on the Mayberry contempts, Mr. Mayberry
being very knowledgeable of the opinion written by

this

Court in his case, informed the Court after he had committed
another contemptuous act before Judge Van der Voort that he
motioned the judge, Judge Van der Voort, to now disqualify
himself from sitting in judgment of Mr. Mayberry because he
was now — had been the object of the scorn of Mr. Mayberry
and therefore he now must disqualify himself from hearing it.
QUESTION:

This could go on for quite awhile,

couldn't it?
MR. EBERHARDT:

We could have a continuous

operation with knowledgeable defendants knowing by their own
acts directed at the Court they could prejudice the Court in
the eyes of an appellate court and require another hearing.
We could have hearings continuing and continuing on forever,
I would submit.
QUESTION;

Did the Mayberry opinion undertake to

carve out any time zones on the contempt?
MR. EBERHARDT:
QUESTION:

You mean factually?

Yes.

MR. EBERHARDT:

No, I only can point to the

record to show you that citations

presented by the trial

judge indicate the different days and times throughout the
trial that these occurred.
I attempted to completely read the original
prison breach transcript that goes over a period of 3,COO-some
pages and my belief is that this is a series

not a series

of offenses, but a group of Individual offenses as based
upon the length of trial, the periods during which the trial
continued on without interruption and all of a sudden there
would be an action by one of the defendants.
I would like to address myself to the Seale
decision for a minute.

The petitioners base their argument

on the first issue presented to this Court on the rationale
of the Court in Seale.

I would like to point out several

basic fallacies with that rationale, the first being that
the Court in Seale seems to assume that the trial judge is
going to svbuse contempt power.
It seems to me that that opinion is based upon
the fact that the trial judge, if given the power to summarily
sentence a defendant for contemptuous acts, direct criminal
contemptuous acts, that that trial judge will abuse that
discretion.

I take exception with that and would! argue that

the traditional appellate review of abuse of discretion is
available to a defendant and that the courts can find those
abuses and correct them.
?•

I think it is a very bad basis for the decision
in Seale that a trial judge is assumed to be subject to
abusing his discretion.
As far as the second issue is concerned, the
Commonwealth first of all would take some exception to the
phrasing of the issue.

The issue is phrased in terms of a

32
substantial term

of imprisonment.

The Pennsylvania contempt statutes do not provide
for a maximum sentence.

Theoretically, I suppose, it could

be argued that the defendant could subject himself by a
direct criminal contemptuous act to an unknown sentence, the
maximum for which is not provided by statute.
QUESTION:

Well, I take it, there is no issue

here ---- let’s assume that there had been one sentence for
contempt — only one count of contempt and a sentence of
two years for it.

Would he have been entitled to a jury trial?

MR. EBERHARDT:
QUESTION:

Yes, I think so.

Because the second trial took place

after Bloom?
MR. EBERHARDT:

Well, the first trial

the first

trial occurred —
QUESTION:

In ’66.

MR. EBERHARDT:

We have submitted for the Court’s

consideration and argument in our brief, based upon your
rationale in the case of Jenkins v. Delaware, the rationale
there was that the Miranda decision should not be applied to
retrials.
QUESTION:

Well, it's a different — a jury trial

is a question about the procedures at trial, not about the
procedures before trial.
MR. EBERHARDT:

That is true.

That is true and

33
of course, the Constitutional question of the right to jury
trial is an important question.

However, we would submit

that the Commonwealth in this case proceeded under the case
lavra then existing.
QUESTION:

In '66.

MR. EBERHARDT:

In ’66 but the trial judge in

sentencing at the end of trial, I don't know what all went
through his mind at that time.

He could have cited him for

contempt during trial and apparently under the Seale
decision,that would have been all right to sentence him to
six months and another contempt, another six .months, another
contempt, another six months and be consecutive and that
would be fine.
But by waiting to the end of trial, the Seale
decision and the argument of the petitioners, they would
seem to indicate that they had to accumulate.
QUESTION;

Well, were the defendants tried twice

for contempt?
MR. EBERHARDT:
QUESTION:

I —

Was their first sentence set aside?

Wa3 the first trial?
MR. EBERHARDT:

The opinion of this Court and the

order of this Court was vacated and remanded.
QUESTION:

And it went back to thetrial court?

MR. EBERHARDT:

It went back to another judge,

the presiding judge.
QUESTION:

And so that was a new proceeding to —

the judgment had been vacated?
MR. EBERHARDT:

I say that the sentence was

vacated because this Court —
QUESTION:

The judgment was vacated.

MR. EBERHARDT:

I suppose in most other jurisdictions, the appeal in a
criminal case is from the judgment of sentence, not from

Well, I would suppose that the

judgment was vac ted,
MR. EBERHARDT:
QUESTION;

Right.

The judgment of his conviction was

vacated=
MR. EBERHARDT:

The sentence that was imposed

Is the appealable — once the sentence is imposed, the appeal
time starts to run.
QUESTION:

No,

but the new judge had to find

whether, again, he had to make the determination again
whether he had been held — whether he had committed contempt.
MR. EBERHARDT:

Right and he did so on the basis

of the record.
QUESTION:

So that was a new trial court

proceedings?
MR. EBERHARDT:

Well, he did make a new finding

of guilt of contempt.
QUESTION:

And at that point, the Bloom against

Illinois had been decided?
MR. EBERHARDT:

Prior to that?
At that point, Bloom had been

decided.
QUESTION:

And the question was then, in carrying

out this proceeding, must I proceed consistently with Bloom?
MR. EBERHARDT:
QUESTION:

Correct.

And your contention is, he needn't

have a jury trial because no particular contempt drew more
than a six months sentence.
MR. EBERHARDT:

That is our basic position.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Well, may

I ask also, Mr. Eberhardt,

your Supreme Court on the first appeal in the Mayberry case
before the case came here, relying on our DeStefano that
Biocm was prospective only sustained the consecutive
sentences initially imposed on Mayberry.

Now, when, after

the second trial, it went back to the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania, I noticed that there is a one-sentence per
curiam.

The judgments of contempt are affirmed.
Nov;, did you argue before the State Supreme

Court that the same rationale that Bloom was not retroactive
required affirmance of those convictions?
MR. EBERHARDT:

We did argue that among other

36
things.
QUESTION:

And we have no way of knowing, I see,

that Judge Mandarine was the only dissenter, whereas in the
first trial, at least Mr. Justice Roberts and I think
Mr. Justice O’Brien ■—
MR. EBERHARDT:
QUESTION:

Right.

Took the view that they concurred only

because Bloom was not retroactive.
MR. EBERHARDT:
QUESTION;

Correct.

But how are we to read the judgments of

contempt that are affirmed in the second go-around?
MR. EBERHARDT:
present to the Court.

I wish I had an opinion to

It would have helped me considerably

and have helped the Court.
QUESTION:

But you did, in any event, argue, that

for the same reasons •—
MR. EBERHARDT:

Yes, we did and I have a copy of

the brief that we submitted before the Pennsylvania Court.
QUESTION:

And you repeat that argument here, as

I read page 15 of your brief, don’t you?
MR. EBERHARDT:

Yes, we do.

And I would submit

that the Pennsylvania statute, although it is open-ended, I
believe that the decisions of this Court that look to the
actual sentence imposed and I think that the Court should
continue to do so and I would finally suggest to the Court

that when the trial judge does decide to proceed non-jury,
without a jury, on a contempt or several contempts, where he
waits till the end of trial, I believe that he is indicating
to the defendant and and his counsel constructively that he
is not going to consider these from reading of the citations.
He is not going to consider these contempts as serious, but
as petty and under six months sentence or six months sentence
or less is all that he will consider to be imposed and that
the second issue that is presented by the petitioners, that
there is a strong possibility or substantial possibility of
a long term of imprisonment, I don’t believe it is so except
that the fact that a defendant by himself creates a number of
contemptuous acts, separate contemptuous acts and the mere
fact that they are tried together by the Court may subject
him to a substantial term of imprisonment, that being over
six months.
But the fact that they are tried together I
don’t believe has any bearing upon the fact that they are
individual offenses and not one continuous act.
QUESTION:

Do you think there is anything in

Mayberry or the cases prior to Mayberry that are discussed
here that would prevent a citation for each individual
episode of contempt to be tried separately, whether it was
embraced within a day or one episode?

And then in the case

of 11 contempts, on 11 separate days, to try him serriatim,

38
one after another, for each contempt without a jury on
summary proceedings and give him six months on each one and
if the judges, the new judges that wanted to make them
consecutives do go ahead and do so?
Do you see anything in Mayberry that would pre­
clude that?

Or in the other cases?
MR. EBERHARDT:

No, I don’t.

Mayberry itself

speaks to the impartiality of the judge and the decision in
Mayberry, I think, assists the trial courts in determining
whether or not the trial judge who is •— to whom the con­
temptuous acts are directed and personally directed, must
disqualify himself.
QUESTION:

Do you think you would have to get a

new judge, then, for each case under Mayberry?
MR. EBERHARDT:

Well, under Mayberry I believe

that that is — the direct decision in Mayberry was —
QUESTION:

At least it implies that that might be

necessary.
MR. EBERHARDT:

It might be but I think it talks

more in terms of waiting till the end of trial.

That is

another point that we dispute, the Seale rationale making a
difference between the end of trial and during trial,
petitioner makes an argument regarding the abuse that can
occur at the end of trial stronger than the abuse that can
occur by citing and sentencing during trial.

39
QUESTION;

Isn't there an important reason why

the contempt proceeding is deferred until the end of the
trials whether it is directed against the defendant or
against his

lawyer?
MR. EBERHARDT:

Well., in the case of an attorney,

it is very important not to prejudice the defendant in the
eyes of the jury by citing an attorney representing a
defendant for contemptuous acts during that trial.
In this case, the defendants v?ere acting a.s their
own counsel and the trial judge may have felt that he would
be prejudicing the defendants in the minds of the jurors by
citing and sentencing them during trial and that- he
deferred that until the end of trial so as not to prejudice
their defense or to enhance the Commonwealth case before
the jury.
I think the distinction betxveen during trial
and end of trial3 citing the sentencing, there are reasons
for doing it during trial and. there are reasons for doing it
at the end of trial and I think each individual case demands
review and I think appellate review is available and abuses
of discretion —
QUESTION:

Mr. Eberhardt, did I hear that at

one point they put him out of the room, put him out of the

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, isn't that one way of solving

the problem rather than giving him 100 years?
MR. EBERHARDT:

I believe that is.

of the Court’s opinion in Allen.

So did the judge in Allen.

If he commits individual acts of

MR. EBERHARDT:
QUESTION:

I think the defendant himself —

This is a man going to serve 20

years without a jury.
MR. EBERHARDT:

position of a right to a jury trial is very important to
the defendants.

Where to draw the line, I am not sure,

but

I think in making a. general —

MR. EBERHARDT:

If I was the defendant, I might

QUESTION:

I think

Mr. Efoerhardt, does It depend in

part on the facts, do you think?

Suppose this trial went

along for two days and then for good reasons, was recessed
for three and the contemptuous cursing of the court, if you
will, took place at the first segment and then, again, at the
second.

Does it disturb your sense of justice that that might

be two separate contempts?
MR. EBERHARDT:

Somewhat,.

But I would indicate

that making a very strong per se rule for the trial judge to
handle contemptuous acts would be very detrimental.I think

42
that the trial judge has to have some discretion that should
impart to a judge a use of discretion.

The Chase opinion that

I referred to from the circuit court indicated that appellate
courts must and can look to whether or not the trial judge
has, by his own actions, developed a series of what he
identifies as contemptuous acts.
QUESTION:

Does Pennsylvania have judge

sentencing or jury sentencing in substantive criminal
offenses?
MR. EBERHARDT:

It is judge sentencing.

I may indicated to the Court., just for the
information of the Court that Pennsylvania does have

an

indirect criminal contempt statute which provides for a jurytrial and it does have a maximum sentence of 15 days and/or
a $100 fine.

In the indirect situation, of course, you have

an act being committed outside the presence of the Court and
determination

by the legislature of Pennsylvania, apparently,

and that is a very old statute, was that

a. jury would be

best to determine whether or not the court’s order had been
violated.
QUESTION:

Don't you think the Allen case is

going to help in the future?
MR. EBERHARDT:

In cases like this.
I think the Allen case probably is

the best solution for contempt, like this.
QUESTION:

To get them out of there.

43
MR. EBERHARDT; The trial judge did, on remand of.
this case, when Codispoti indicated that he was no longer
going to abide by the decorum of the court, he was taken into
an antechamber of the courtroom and a microphone and loud­
speaker provided for him.
QUESTION:

Because a primary importance is to

protect the dignity and decorum of the courtroom, not any
individual involved.

That is our primary responsibility.

MR. EBERHARDT:

Primary and a secondary

responsibility is to prevent further acts of contempt.

Up to six months, I believe, in

QUESTION:

dignity of the court extended over a period of six weeks, or

MR. EBERHARDT:

Five and a half to six weeks.

I believe that the Commonwealth would argue
against any adoption of a so-called single transaction test
in the contempt area and I would further point out one
additional case that Commonwealth has found in its research.,
two additional cases that are not cited in this brief, one
being Ahran v. State, 28h Southern 2nd, 673 in which the —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Dean, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. DEAN, ESQ.
MR, DEAN:

Yes, your Honor.

I think that what

this shows is the somewhat chimerical characterisation that
can attend a contempt analj/sis here because one thing that I
think has emerged in regard to both the presentations here
today is that when this case originally came up to the court
the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had
termed his conduct outrageous.
Mr. Justice Douglas of this Court termed the
conduct of the defendant, "A shock to those raised in the
Western tradition of Justice.”
He had received an ll-to-22-year sentence and
all of a sudden when he comes back for a trial, what has
become, at least according to the characterisations of the
original trial judge, the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court and a justice of this Court as outrageous, has
been transformed into a petty contempt.
I feel that that type of labeling, putting on
these crimes, Is what brings to the fore the problem of
looking solely to the actual sentence received on each crime
rather than the aggregate sentence because by looking at the
aggregate sentence, the effectiveness, the total problem
that gets up here is well before the Court.

QUESTION:

Mr, Dean, what do you think of this
