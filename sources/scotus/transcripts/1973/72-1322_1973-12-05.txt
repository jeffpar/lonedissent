MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

of Richmond.
Mr. Coleman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. COLEMAN:

Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue here is a propriety under section 718 of
the 1972 School Aid Act or under the Fourteenth Amendment and
related jurisdictions subject to the Civil Rights Act statutes
of the reversal by the Fourth Circuit of the District Courts*
award of counsel fees for petitioners' successful efforts in
obtaining an injunction which required the Richm aid School
Board to adhere to its constitutional and statutory duty to
desegregate its public schools.
The issue tendered here predates and has nothing
whatsoever to do with the subsequent Richmond area school case
which this Court heard last term.
Petitioners here are black school children and their
parents who live in Richmond and who were required to return
to the District Court on March 10, 1970 to force respondents
to adopt an effective desegregation plan.

I say "required,"

because on May 30, 1966, after five years of litigation, the

school board had proposed and the District Court had ordered a
freedom of choice plan for the 1966 school year.

Such plan,

however, specifically provided —• and now I call your atten­
tion to page 23 of the record — that if such plan did not pro­
duce efficient results, significant results during the 19661967 school year, it would

have to be modified.

The plan also provided for desegregation of the school
faculty.

Moreover, on May 26, 1968, this Court decided Green,

which held that freedom of choice plans which did not result in
a unitary school system were unconstitutional.

The schools in

Richmond, both pupils and faculty, however, despite the 1966
plan and despite Green, remain non-unitary.

Respondents did

nothing whatsoever.
So finally, on March 10, 1970, petitioners were forced
to move in the District Court for further relief.
included a request for counsel fees.

The motion

The motion, after ex­

tensive litigation, resulted in the school desegregation order
of April 5, 1971, which incidentally is the order under which
the schools in Richmond are now being operated.
The District Court then, as part of the equitable
relief, awarded counsel fees for petitioners of $43,000 and
costs of $13,000.

Before making this award, the District Court

determined that on the record before it the award was justified
by respondents' conduct, both in making necessary petitioners'
1970 reopening of the case and in the course of the litigation

5
thereafter.
Ultimately, the court held that the fee award was
justified by the fact that petitioners had acted as private
attorneys general in securing respondents5 compliance with the
Fourteenth Amendment, and such award was required to give com­
plete and effective equitable relief.
For a moment, I would like to call the Court's atten­
tion to the findings of fact on which the District Court's
order was based.

At page 133a of the record, the court found

that since 1968 at the latest, the school board was clearly
in default of its constitutional duties to take steps which
would result in a unitary school system.

But when brought

into court, even though the school board admitted noncompliance, it put petitioners to the effort of showing that
governmental action was behind the segregated school attendance
*

prevailing in Richmond.

That is at page 115a of the record

and page 133a of the record.
The trial judge further found that respondents would
take no steps whatsoever to end segregation in Richmond unless
and until sued by petitioners and then only as ordered by the
District Court.

And that is the finding on page 133a of the

record and 134a of the record.
The counsel fee award was based in part upon these
findings, thus we do not understand the observation of the
Fourth Circuit on page 167a of the record, that the District

6

Court does not seem to have based its award on the inaction of
the school board prior to March 10, 1970.
The District Court also found that the first two plans
of desegregation which were filed by respondents as a result of
the court order were clearly deficient.
page 117a and 116a of the record.

That finding is on

And two out of three subse­

quent plans filed by the respondents were clearly deficient,
thus time and effort was spent by petitioners in demonstrating
"the invalidity of the proposed plans until finally the court
'accepted plan three.
Finally — and this finding I think is quite import­
ant —- the District Court found that the character of school
desegregation cases by 1970 and 1971 had become such that full
and appropriate equitable relief should include the award of
expenses of litigation.
137a of the record.

That finding, sirs, is made on page

And that counsel of great expertise was

needed to aid the court, and that finding is on page 141a of
the record.
The Court of Appeals, nevertheless, reversed the award
of counsel fees.

Petitioners submit that there are five separ­

ate and distinct legal grounds, each of which require that the
judgment of the District Court be reinstated.
First, this Court's decision in the Mills case and
in the Hall case, cited on pages 21 and 23 of our brief, permit
legal fees to be awarded because petitioners' actions benefited

7
an ascertainable class, namely the school — all of the school
children in Richmond.
Second, petitioners are entitled to counsel fees be­
cause they acted as private attorneys general in bringing this
action which vindicated important constitutional and congres­
sional policy.
Third, section 718 of the School Aid Act of 1972,
which we set forth on page 8 of our brief, enacted while this
case was pending on appeal, expressly requires the award of
counsel fees in school desegregation litigation.
Fourth, it was within the discretion of the District
Court, sitting as a court of equity, to award counsel fees as
necessary for afford full, complete, equitable relief in this
particular school desegregation case.
And, finally, the legal fees here were required by
the District Courtfe findings supported by the record that the
respondents acted unreasonably in refusing to desegregate
voluntarily the Richmond school system, and persistently pro­
posing a series of unworkable desegregation plans.

It should

be noted that only the fifth ground requires consideration of
whether, as the District Court found, respondents' conduct
was unreasonably obstinate.
Q

Mr. Coleman, I realize you are not relying ex­

clusively on the 1972 act, by any means.

I suppose had a final

order been entered here prior to the enactment of that statute,

8

that ground would have been taken away, wouldn't it?
MR, COLEMAN:

Well, it never would have existed.

What

you are saying, by final order, Your Honor, that the award of
counsel fees had been denied, an appeal was taken, and that
was denied, and thereafter Congress enacted a statute, then
clearly that statute would not be applicable, you could not go
back and reopen the litigation on the counsel fees.
Q

So by the fortuitous circumstances that the final

order was not entered, at least you have an additional ground
in your position?
MR. COLEMAN:

I wouldn't use the word fortuitous.

I

would say by the correct thing that Congress did, that that is
an additional ground which we can —
Q

Is the statute capable of being applied to

services rendered after its effective date?

I take it your po­

sition is that it applies to all services, as long as the
statute is applicable.
MR. COLEMAN:
to section 7IS.

Yes, sir.

Well, x*hy don't I go right

It is on page 8 of our brief, Your Honor.

As

we understand it, section says that where there is a final
order to desegregate the schools, and there is a finding of
fact that proceedings xvere necessary to bring about the compli­
ance, then the court may award counsel fees to the prevailing
party.
That statute was enacted on either June or July 27,

9
1972.

It was enacted while the case was pending on appeal.

There is nothing in that statute which says it is not to apply
to existing litigation.

As we read your decision, particularly

4 U.S. Alabama, the one thing that is clear is that where you
have a statute which does not by its term restrict itself to
future events, that statute pertains to pending litigation.
Q

Well, that is an historic rule, isn’t it, that

changes in the law apply to a case that is pending on appeal,
normally?
MR. COLEMAN:
Q

Pardon?

Normally that’s the rule?

MR. COLEMAN:

Normally, that’s the rule.

In the

absence of something extraordinary, that's the rule.
Q

What's the rule, Mr. Coleman — there was a

statute that permitted awarding of 5 percent attorneys fees,
or had some, standard in it that applied to the litigation as it
was going on, and then while the case was pending on appeal the
Statute is changed to 6 percent.
MR. COLEMAN:
Q

Yes.

Now, is it your argument that the 6 percent

would apply to all the services

that have been performed prior

to the change?
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, I would say that in the hypo­

thetical you gave, Your Honor, yes.

I mean I could see certain

circumstances where the rule may be different, but if that is

10

all to the hypothetical, I would say in that case you would ap­
ply the statute =
Q

Well, that is a fortiori in your case, I guess?

MR. COLEMAN:

Oh, sure.

This case, Your Honor, you

have to hold ten, twelve cases before you could say that this
statute would not be applicable.

Now, the only thing that the

respondents said, the only argument he has is that the statute
has an effective date which says, you know, that it is effective
July 1, 1972, but obviously that was before the case was de­
cided by the Fourth Circuit and before you heard the case in
this Court.
To the extent that there is legislative history, my
understanding of the law, Your Honor, if the legislative history
is neutral, then clearly the rule of law applies.

To the ex­

tent that there is legislative history, the only legislative
history that you can find here is that at one time the bill
specifically provided that it would only be applicable to
legal services performed after the effective date of the act.
That was then deleted from the bill.
Now, to the extent that there is any — that is it.
And also — and then I will be finished with this point, Your
Honor — if you recall, in Goldstein v. California, which was
decided last term, Mr. Chief Justice, when you wrote the
opinion for the Court, you spent two paragraphs completely —
twice quoting language which showed that Congress intended

11
specifically only to apply the statote in the future.

And it

was clear that but for that specific language you then would
apply that statute to actions which already took place.
Not only 718, Your Honor, do 1 think that this case
has to be reversed and the order of the District Court rein­
stated, but under your decision in Hall, where you said there
it was simply a congressional statute which said that if an
employee — if a member of the labor union was kicked out of
the union, he could sue.

You indicated there that part of the

relief, since what he did was for an ascertainable class, part
of the relief could be the award of counsel fee.

And once

again, the District Court awarded counsel fee and the sole
issue is whether you should upset it.

And the issue is not

here whether if they had not awarded counsel fee what would be
the result.

Here you have a case x-zhere the court did exercise

the power.

‘
In addition, the cases make it clear that where the

petitioner acts as a private attorney general, he is entitled
to counsel fee as part of the award.

And the one thing that is

clear in this country, that private persons who are forced to
bring lav; suits to vindicate constitutional rights which re­
sulted in the desegregation of public schools.
Q

Piggie Park?

MR. COLEMAN: piggie Park, there is the Lee case in
the Firth Circuit, there are other cases which say that where

12

it happens»

And the government here, in its amicus brief,

freely concedes that it just did not and could not bring the
litigation which resulted in the desegregation of public
schools, and under those circumstances we certainly were vin­
dicating the rights of a private person.
Now, as I understand the respondents' brief, he pretty
much concedes that if you read Knowles, if you read Hall, if
you read the private attorneys general cases, clearly the law
should be that under those circumstances the black petitioners
were entitled to counsel fees.

But he says that because Congress

has now passed section 718, for some reason, you forget the one
group of people that stood in the trenches, that took the risks,
that supplied the legal talent to change the society peacefully,
and by the use of lav; rather than by being in the street, and
somehow they should be penalized.
We also think there is some merits in the government's
position that the best thing here for the Court, for all court,
is to award the fee on the basis of the Hall case of a private
attorney general, because district courds, and frankly we don't
like to be in litigation with school boards as to whether they
were obstinate or not.

Now, if you really want to have a lot

of litigation, that is the only rule you xvould go for.

But if

you go for the Hall rule or the Mills rule, or if you apply
section 718, then you don't have these problems.
Now, on the being obstinate, I think the findings are

13
there, and if rule 52 means anything, I think you have to carry
out the rule, the finding of the District Court.

After all, it

was Judge Mehridge that dealt day and day with the litigants,
day in and day out.

He was the one with the nuances of how

cooperative you are being, the things that you just can't put
in the record, and he was the one that made the determination,
based upon: everything that had happened before him, he felt
that the award should be made on that basis.
He also was the one — and I think you ought to give
some weight to the experiences of the great federal district
-judges that have really worked this problem out locally.
•• ‘

!■'

He

,i. •!

was the one that, having these cases and knowing cases, talk­
ing to his brother, 1 am pretty sura realized that the ,c "fort
involved in bringing this.type of litiaation requires it to be
competent counsel, counsel has to be skilled, counsel has to
spend a lot of title, and since thac you are benefiting the
public here, that for that reason you ought to award the
counsel fee.
I think Brown, number two, if it teaches anything, it
teaches that in this type of litigation that sometimes the
rights of individuals have to be subordinated to the rights of
1

;it,-

enfci"

/roup, and that clearly by bringing the litigation,

laving the class action, you are functioning to change the
•whole society and if the cases which we cite in our brief have
any significant at all, it is clear that in this instance that

14
you ought to indicate that there is — that we were functioning
as a private — or Mr. Greenberg and the other people, I had
nothing to do with the case — were functioning as private
attorney generals, and on that basis you should reinstate the
order of the District Court.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Coleman.

Mr. Little?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE B. LITTLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LITTLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The issues could be narrowed very quickly.

We take

no issue with the fundamental soundness of the rational advanced
by this Court in Mills, in Newman v. Piggie Park, in Hall v.
Cole, and cognite cases.

But we must question the applicability

of the rationale of those cases to pre-Swann school desegrega­
tion litigation.
Accordingly, we take the position that the judgment
of the lower court should be affirmed since the unique nature
of pre-Swann school desegregation litigation renders the tra­
ditional equitable standard of obdurate obstinancy entirely
appropriate for litigation in that era,

that the record fully

exonerates the District Court’s findings with respect to the
conduct of this board, and for the reason that section 718

15

does not reach services concluded more in 17 months prior to
the effective date of the act.
By way of an overview to reach our position, we must
go back to 1970.

That is the area of time involved.

We can

gain a proper perspective to determine what is a proper stand­
ard to measure the conduct of the board with respect to preSwann litigation.
Through a very brief reviex^ of the actual factual
realities confronting the Richmond School Board, the precise
issue that gave rise to all of this litigation, and a very
brief review of the state of the law as it then applied par­
ticularly to the issue involved.
The dilemma confronting the Richmond School Board at
the time of the filing for motion for further relief on March
10, 1970, prior to Swann, is very easy to describe to the
Court.

We had a large metropolitan system, majority black,

characterised 99 percent by marked residentially segregated
neighborhoods.

The first plan submitted by the school board,

based entirely on the efforts of HEW — they prepared the plan,
the first plan, which was rejected.

The principal deficiency

in that plan was the failure of HEW — and I am not saying it
is their responsibility, it is the school board’s responsibil­
ity — but in drawing the plan, they refused to use transpor­
tation over and above what was then being done in Richmond.
Every bit of the litigation from that point on

16

narrowed down to even a much more restricted aspect of the
transportation issue.

This is in the summer of 1970.

Specific­

ally, the issue narrowed down as fine as this, the necessity
for buying buses to alter the racial composition of 19 elemen­
tary schools, because the interim plan that was approved by
Judge Mehridge, which was the second plan submitted, did the
job at the high school level, at the middle school level, and
at the elementary level, with the exception of these 19 schools,
12, more than 90 percent black, on one side of town, and 7,
more than 90 percent white, on the other side of town.
The racial composition of these 19 schools was the
major deficiency which the court found in the interim plan which
was implemented in September of. '70.

It formed the basis for

the plaintiffs’ motion for mid-year implementation of addition­
al relief beginning in January of 1971, which the lower court
denied, and it was the reason why Judge Mehridge ordered further
relief on April 5, 1971.
Now, on this issue, there was no disagreement, that
the only way these 19 schools could be desegregated was by the
extensive cross-town transportation of elementary age children.
It was also agreed, Richmond had never operated a transporta­
tion system, with the exception of I think eight buses used
in special education, and that public transportation was not
then available, with capacity to do the job.
disputed issues.

They were not

17
Now, so much for the factual dilemma.
the state of the law as it existed on this issue.

Let's come to
In the same

month that the motion for further relief was filed, the Chief
Justice, in Northcrcss, pointed out that whereas the objective
of a unitary system, none in racial discrimination did not
exist, it was perfectly clear that the means were left largely
unresolved.

Specifically, the Chief Justice mentioned one of

the issues as being the extent to which transportation may or
must be used as a desegregation tool.
In Swann, this Court frankly acknowledged the
enormity of the problem, the complexities of the problem, as
it did beginning with Brown X, as it repeated in Brown II, be­
cause bear in mind, school desegregation litigation set a
precedent in our history of jurisprudence.

It was the first

time of which I am aware that constitutionally declared rights
had to be deferred because of the complexities of the problem.
Thus, it was not until May — I beg your pardon, April 20,
1971 that there was any occasion for this Court to ever have
addressed itself to the metropolitan school problem.
As this Cottrfc noted in the Swann decision, it was
its first effort to deal with this subject of transportation.
Now, what was the law in the Fourth Circuit?

Bear in mind, we

lived in Virginia, under the law of Briggs v. Elliot for
fourteen years prior to this decision in Green, when no less
a jurist than John J. Parker interpreted Brown to mean that

18

there was nothing in the Constitution to require integration.
So the light has not dax^ned too early in Virginia.
The first time that the Fourth Circuit had occasion
to address either transportation or metropolitan school dis­
tricts were in its deicisions in Swann and Brewer.

Now, these

decisions were both decided after the HEW plan had been re­
jected.

In other words, at the time of the preparation of the

first plan that was submitted by HEW, there were no guidelines
from this Court or from the Fourth Circuit with respect to
metropolitan school districts.
Now, significantly, the District Court found that the
interim plan, which we submitted within 13 days after the de­
cision in Brewer, fully complied with the Fourth Circuit's
test of reasonableness as it then existed in the Fourth Circuit
and that it represented — this is the Judge’s language — a
sincere effort to comply with the guidelines.
ing in terms of bad faith at that time.

He was not think

That reference is 317

Fed Supp., at pages 573 and 575.
Now, the precise issue that we were wrestling with
and the state of law with respect to that issue provides a
setting for our conclusion that the Court of Appeals did not
err in applying the conditional equitable standard with respect
to fees or in concluding that the board — that the. record
exonerated the board under this standard.
The universal acknowledgement by every court in this

19
country of the enormity and the complexity of this type of
litigation prior to Swann underlies the decision and the de­
termination by every court of appeals in this country which
has passed on the issue that the appropriate pre-Swann stand­
ard is the traditional equitable standard of obdurate obstinancy in every suit that has been brought under section 1983.
I don't think we should presume that the Fourth, the
Fifth, the Sixth, the Eighth and the Ninth Circuits have been
oblivious to either the vital importance of the constitutional
rights being vindicated, to the public benefit that has re­
sulted, or to the fact that the plaintiffs in a very real sense
were acting as attorney generals.
Q

Mr» Little, I am not sure that I understand that.

What had been the -- how many decisions have there been prior
to 1972 allowing attorneys fees in school desegregation cases?
MR» LITTLE:

Oh, there have been any number of de­

cisions allowing them, sir, but always on the standard of what
has been referred to as —
Q

Obdurate obstinance?

MR. LITTLE:

Yes, sirs with the exception of the

District Court in this case, no court in -this country at the
circuit court level or at the district court level has ever
made an award against a school board other than on the obdurate
obstinancy test, that is for services rendered pre-Swann.
Q

And pre the legislation of 1972?

20

MR. LITTLE:

Oh, yes, sir.

I am addressing myself

prior to that.
Q

And there have been numerous judgments allowing

such fees on that basis?
MR. LITTLE:
Q

Yes, sir, but solely on that basis.

I understand.

MR. LITTLE:

Without exception, which is a unique thing

to be able to say with that many courts involved and that amount
of litigation.
Q

How many circuits, four or five?

MR. LITTLE:

Five, sir.

The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,

Eighth and Ninth.
Q

I guess it is the standard of the statute, I

take it?
MR. LITTLE:

No, sir.

The standard of the statute

has been set by this Court, and we have no —- in Northcross, in
June of this past year — we have no objection to that.

But

that addresses itself — and we will come to section 718, but I
am bringing out what the absolute uniformity has been prior to
that.
Now, these same factors, that is the enormity of the
problem, the complexities involved, the frequent admonition by
this Court, beginning with Brown II, that equitable standards
shall govern, and the courts construed that to mean the tra­
ditional equitable standard with respect to the award of fees,

21

has been the basis for distinguishing this type of litigation
from every other form of civil rights litigation of which I am
aware.
The recognition of this distinction, the nature of
pre-Swann litigation, has led the Firth. Circuit subsequent to
the decisions of Hall v. Cole and iJorthcross by this Court to
expressly reject the reasoning of the District Court in this
case and to reaffirm the traditional equitable standard of
obdurate obstinancv even though — and I call the Court's
attention to this particularly — the Firth Circuit had pre­
viously extended the Newman rational to other civil rights
actions brought under sections 1931 and 1982, but it said not
so in light of the uncertainties of the law that existed»
The rationale, why the Fifth Circuit refused to do
this, is well stated on page 29 of our brief, the blue brief,
it is a part of the quotation from Johnson v. Combs.

This

complete uncertainty of the law which has led to this uni­
form adoption by all of the circuits underlies the basic
fallacy in the District Court's finding as to the conduct of
this board in this case.
The basic premise that Judge Mehridge used to sub­
stantiate his conduct finding was that the Richmond School
Board had ignored clear legal directives.

Such a finding, in

light of what we have just reviewed as to the unsettled state
of the law at that time, compelled a reversal by the Fourth

22

Circuit on that ground, as the District Court throughout this
litigation itself had made repeated references to the unsettled
state of the law at that time,,
Let me cite just one.

Eight weeks before this opinion

came dox^n finding bad conduct and clear — ignoring the clear
legal authorities, this is what the District Court itself was
cautioning us about.

This was on March 4, 1971, prior to Swann.

We were all groping, may it please the Court, we did not know
what this Court would ultimately do in Swann.
The District Court said we ought to contemplate that
there may be some expression in the law which would advocate
neighborhood schools for children in grades one through five.
This was eight weeks before his opinion of May 26.
Moreover, the Court of Appeals could hardly have con­
curred in what the judge below had singled out as the real
failure of the Richmond School Board, namely its failure to buy
buses until ordered to do so.

If you will look on pages 133,

134 and 135 — I beg your pardon, on page 118 of the record,
the judge said the school board had in August still taken no
steps to acquire the necessary equipment.

1971 opinion.

He is addressing

This is a quote from his May 26,

And yet what did the judge himself say on

August 7, 1970, the same month, in open court, and I quote:
seems to me it would be completely unreasonable" —
Q

Where are you reading?

"It

23

MR. LITTLE:

I am reading, sir, from our brief,

our appendix, 85a, 85a in the appendix, sir.
Q

Thank you.

MR. LITTLE:

Now, this is what the judge thought the

law was about buying buses in August of 1970:

"It seems to me

it would be completely unreasonable to force a school system
that has no transportation, and you all don't have any to any
great extent, to go out and buy nex</ buses when the United
States Supreme Court may say that is wrong."
Now, the District Court on three occasions, in June
of 570, in August of '70, and January of '71, had refused to
order us to buy buses, despite requests to do so, because he
knew at that, time that the law was unsettled.
I think, in view of time, I had better move to the
significant reasons why we say that section 718 should not foe
applied to pre-Swann services.
First, the Fourth and Fifth Circuits are the only two
that have had occasion to rule on the applicability of section
718 to pre-Swann services.

Both have refused or declined to

do so, to apply section 718 to those services.

One of the

grounds cited by both of the courts was that the inconclusive
legislative history of section 718, and both courts determined
that the legislative history was inconclusive, did not over­
come the historic presumption against the prospective opera­
tion of statutes, absent clear and unambiguous intent to the

24
1
contrary.
Now, Mr. Justice White, we feel that that rule is
perfectly consistent with the teachings of United States v„
Schooner Peggy and with Thorpe.
As Judge Winters conceded in his dissent in this case,
and you will see on page 192 he doesn't like this interpreta­
tion of Peggy Schooner, but he does concede that the facts in
Schooner Peggy and much of the opinion — this deals with the
effect on a change in law pending appeal — is that the proper
statement of the rule is that when there is a change in lav;,
of course, the appellate court is required to consider that lav;.
That is not saying applying it.

It is to examine that law to

try to determine whether or not it was intended to cover
transactions which had transpired prior to its enactment.

This

J

was exactly what this Court did in both U.S. — Chief Justice
Marshall did in U.S. v. Schooner Peggy, and I submit what was
done in Thorpe.

Nov;, let's mention Thorpe for just a moment.

No one can deny the existence of the historic pre­
sumption of retroactivity — 1 mean against retroactivity of
a congressional enactment.

We can't agree with Judge Winters

who says that Thorpe reverses that presumption.

In his view,

once a lav; is changed, you presume it applies to a pending
case unless there is intent to the contrary.

When you look at

Thorpe, there are two things I would invite the Court’s atten­
tion to.

The court there went and construed the regulation
involved, the IIUD regulation involved, and after construing it
as applying to all tenants still residing in the project —
this was an ejectment suit, suit for eviction under housing
act — it then decided that it applied to this lady whose
litigation was then in process.

In addition, Thorpe is one of

those cases that we members of the bar have a hard time deter­
mining the proper scope of, for the reason that in Thorpe
this Court judiciously avoided a fundamental question of due
process by a very reasonable interpretation of the regulation
before it.
So much for the first reason for not applying section
718.

Another one is wall stated by the Fifth Circuit in

Johnson v. Combs, and I will read just a portion of the quota­
tion.

It is found on — to apply this statute retroactively

would place a wholly unexpected and unwarranted burden on
these districts who have done no more than litigate what they
in good faith believe to be demands which exceeded the Con­
stitution's demands.

This rationale is expanded but time does

not permit me to read any more from it.

But that is the

second ground that has been used as a basis for not applying
section 718 to pre-Swarm services.
And as I mentioned earlier, the Firth Circuit re­
affirmed the same standard for pre-Swann services even after
the decision of this Court in Northcross and in Hall v. Cole.

26

They did that in Eenry v. Clarksdale.
Q

Mr. Little, if Congress would change the witness

fee that is recoverable as an element of cost, say, from $10 to
$20, would the same presumption against retroactivity that ac­
companies substantive legislation apply with equal force there,
to say that you shouldn't apply that retroactively?
MR. LITTLE;

No, sir.

I think when you are in the

area of procedure, I think any change in procedure other than
a — I air using the tern very restrictively as procedure — as
long as it doesn't affect the jurisdiction, of course, as
procedure I think there would be less hesitancy to apply it to
every pending case.
Q

Well, isn't there some analogy between increas­

ing taxable costs and making attorneys fees recoverable?
MR. LITTLE;

Sir, I think that, the analogy has to be

the section 718, what is it in that that gives rise to an
attorneys fees.

And this brings me right to this point of

another basis for not applying it, and that is the entry of an
order of compliance, in other words an order necessary for
compliance.

And the Fourth Circuit of course said, well, there

was no order of compliance on appeal, or there was even pending
at the time of the effective date of section 718.

And that is

another basis.
But I think the true test, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is
that how do we say that Congress, knowing that this rule of

27

obdurate obsfcinance has prevailed unifomally throughout the
country and five circuits and how many district courts — I
don't know — that they would come in and enact a statute in­
tending to cover services rendered prior to its effective date
I have very great difficulty in thinking that Congress intended
to bring about a lot of relitigation because, bear in mind,
school desegregation suits are unique in another sense, adher­
ing to the admonishments of this Court.
within the realm of pending cases.

These cases are still

There are a great many

school desegregation cases of course still pending on the
dockets.

This Court's decision in this case will certainly

have a bearing on whether or not this whole question of attorneys
fees can be reopened in a great many other desegregation cases.
Q

This case was pending though at the time the

statute was passed.
MR. LITTLE;

No order — the Fourth Circuit draws a

distinction, Mr. Justice White, between — there was no order
of compliance pending at the date this act became effective,
because the last order ■—
Q

At the time the act was passed, had the time

passed — let's assume the act had never been passed.
MR. LITTLE;
Q

Yes, sir.

And then the case was in the posture that it

was when this act was passed.

Would that have been too late

for the lawyers representing the plaintiffs to request an

28

attorneys fee based on obdurate obsfcinance?
MR. LITTLE;

Mo, no, no.

I am not saying that, sir.

I am not —
Q

So it wasn't too late for the attorneys to re™

quest their fee?
MR. LITTLE;

Oh, no, they had requested that right

at the outset.
Q

Well, in that event it seems to me the case must

be considered as pending.

Well, how do you answer Mr. Justice Rehnquist's

question then?
MR. LITTLE:

I say, under the rule of Schooner Peggy

and Thorpe, that you start with the presumption against retro­
active —
Q

Do you rely on Schooner Peggy for the so-called

rule, presumption against, retroactive application?
MR. LITTLE:

No, sir.

I rely on U.S. v. Laramie

Stock Yards and Green for the rule.

But I am trying to relate

United States v. Schooner Peggy and Thorpe to the normal rule

of prospective application,absent clear and unambiguous intent
to the contrary.
Q

Yes, but the rule of prospective application,

within the rule of

prospective application is the application

to pending cases.
MR. LITTLE:
Q

May I have that again, sir?

I'm sorry.

Did you think it is a violation of the rule in

favor — if there is such a rule •— in favor of prospective
application to apply it to pending cases?
MR. LITTLE:

No, sir, but I find this, I find it

difficult to believe that in Thorpe this case intended to
modify the normal rule of prospective application without even
referring to the rule.

I have great difficulty there.

I would like to summarise, if I may.

Our disagree­

ment with the petitioners is a very narrow one.

It is not any

basic difference of philosophy regarding the propriety of fee
shifting in civil rights cases.

Indeed, we feel that the trend

in Congress and in Hie courts to expand the concept of fee
shifting in these cases is probably long overdue.

And normally

the standards embodied in section 718, as construed by this
Court in Northeross and under other sections of the Civil
Rights Act, are fully appropriate.

But this is where we have

trouble.
We have trouble and we must question whether con­
scientious school boards, laboring in the struggling sea of

30
pre-Swann uncertainty *— and that is what it was, may it please
the Court, regardless of how conscientious the school board
was — should be held to be in the same legal shoes as those
who callously deny explicit rights in such areas as public
accommodation and housing and employment.
The expansion and extension of the doctrine of Mills
and Newman and Hall v. Cole we think is fully appropriate to
many forms of the civil rights actions which are being brought
tinder section 19S3.

But we say that such an expansion is not

warranted in pre-Swann school desegregation litigation because
of the complexities which necessitated the evolutionary de­
velopment of remedies in school desegregation.
•

We say that this record exonerates the school board

dhder the obdurate obstinancy standard, and certainly would

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Little.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Coleman?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. COLEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In the first place, I have read a lot of cases of
this Court and I don't know any case where you have used this
GSO rule.

Secondly
Q

Used what rule?

MR. COLEMAN:

The obdurate obstinancy rule.

never heard it in any of your opinions.

I have

I have never read it.

Secondly, what really happened was in several cases
where the District Court, for some reason, denied relief based
upon all the findings of the court of equity, and the issue
before the Court of Appeals was whether you should reverse the
District Court, and that is when this expression appeared in a
couple of opinions.
Thirdly, there have been very few cases that made an
award.

And in the Bradley case the award was $75.

Now, while

Mr. Lucas and Mr. Chachkin was litigating against the Richmond
School Board, it so happened that the lawyer for the Richmond
School Board, for this same period of time, received fees in
excess of $86,000.

This is public money from a school system

which is 60 percent black, 40 percent white; clearly the de­
cisions of this Court have indicated that the constitutional
rights of the blacks were violated.

It is only fair and

32
squifcable^ when the law suit was finally successfully won, that
those who fought the school board ought to be compensated.
Q

Mr. Coleman, in your view, was this obdurate

ohstinancy before or after the statement that Judge Mehridge
made about the uncertainties and the unpredictabilities —
MR. COLEMAN:

Could 1 come to that, because this is

something that Mr. Little, as a very skillful advocate, has
said, and he successfully convinced the Fourth Circuit of this.
«Judge Mehridge entered the order on April 5, 1971 based upon,
■the state of law in his circuit, the Fourth Circuit, -which had
decided Swann.

He did not wait for your opinion and obviously

ie couldn't determine what would be in this Court opinion a
year later.

And if there is any doubt about this, I would

like to call your attention to the footnote, footnote one, of
his opinion.
Q

I directed my inquiry, Mr. Coleman, to the

judge's, the trial judge's appraisal of the problem and neces­
sarily the attitudes of the —■
MR. COLEMAN:

body did anything.
court.

These litigants were forced to come into

And in part his award is based upon that.
Q

Are you saying that his remarks x^ere directed at

the details of remedy and not at the fundamental --

MR. QOLEMMJ:

Well, sure, they had to do something,

and certainly what you did, depending upon the local situation,
the sincerity and sophistication of the school hoard.

But

what he says is that you take the law as it existed, in ray
circuit in 1970 and 1971, the school board did not discharge
its functions.

And his opinion, when you read his opinion,

which is the order of April 5, 1971, you will find where he
stated ’"I have bean told to held this case until after the
Supreme Court of the United States decides Swann, but I am not
going to do that, X am going to decide it on the basis of the
existing law.:f
So every one of these plans he threw out, he threw
out solely because it did not comply with the law of the Fourth
Circuit.

He did not throw it out because he felt he knew

that a year later you were going to decide a case where you
would expand the rights of the party.
Now, in closing,

Your Honor, on this question of

the applicability of section 718, X know that every rule about
appellate arguments, the one thing you don't do is read from
a court opinion.

But X just would call your attention to the

Thorpe case where the Court says that the general rule, however
is that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at
the time it renders its decision.

And then footnote 38, "A

change in the law between a nisi pri

and appellate decision

requires the appellate court to prior the changed law.

34
Mow . that is the law.

And as I understand the de­

cisions of this Court, unless the respondents can point to a
legislative history or specific words, as existed in Goldstein,
which says you don’t apply it to pending cases, you clearly
apply it to the pending case.
Now, the Fourth Circuit said that the legislative —
Q

Unless you have got some good reason not to.

MR. COLEMAN:

That’s right.

If there is a grave in­

justice and if you talk about the presumption of Congress,
which I never — but I always felt that, just conceding that
Congressmen read every case and know every statute, and any­
thing he does, he knows the lav/ — and therefore if you think
that those Congressmen had read and knew the obstinate rule
• /hi eh existed in the Fourth and Fifth Circuit, when you read,
those cases, I am pretty sure you are convinced there is no
rule — if that is the theory you are going to go on, which I
really think just isn't so, Congress just don’t read

all the

Cases and they don’t have time, but the rule which is certainly
one that any legislature ought to know, is that when there is
a federal statute enacted, that that statute would apply to
existing cases unless Congress goes out of its way to demon­
strate that that general rule is not to be applied.
Now, if you have got. to compete between which pre­
sumption you should take of Congress, I think that that has to
be the presumption, because that is the law in the federal

35
cases and it seems to be on that basis that you should apply
section 718.

If you do it, you. avoid a lot of litigation, it

beearr-.es very simple and precise, you don't have this problem
— and I can understand why the school board would not want to
be labeled with what it should be labeled with, namely that
the fact is that it did deny the right to these black children
and it took a lot of litigation, and we finally converted them
But we converted them three or four years later.

And whi.le

we were in there trying to convert them, I think that we are
entitled to get compensated.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, Mr. Little.

Thank you, Mr. Coleman.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 2:44 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
