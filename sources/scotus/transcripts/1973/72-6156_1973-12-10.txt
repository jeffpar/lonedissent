L? SPEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments next

in 72-6156, Lewis v. New Orleans.
Mr. Reed, yon can assume that we know the facts of
your case and can get right into it, if you will.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN WILSON

REED, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. REED:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I believe this Court is familiar with this case.
is the second time here.

It

We would like to emphasize very

briefly a few of the facts though.

The situation typifies the

sort of situation that probably repeats itself every day in
the urbanized parts of our society.
The defendant, Mallie Lewis, was upset about some
particular police conduct directed towards her son Joseph.
failed to get satisfactory answers from the police.

She

Upon the

advice of the police, she followed the police patrol car carry­
ing her son to the central lockup in. New Orleans.

Another

police patrol car, seeing that he was being followed, eventu­
ally pulled over the appellant, apparently to find out why she
was followed him, when appellant got out of the car, her tested
again, her treatment by the police and the failureto explain
to her what was being done with her son, and at that point,
according to the police testimony, said, "You god dam m.f.

4
police — I am going to Giarrusso about this.!i

I think the

part "1 sia going to Giarrusso about this" should not be ig­
nored.

Giarrusso is the Superintendent of Police in New

Orleans, a high public official, and the comment by Mallie
Lewis reflects an intention to complain.

It is an expression

of some First Amendment interest.
The ultimate issue in the case is what are the limit
of protest, an expression of anger by a citizen who feels
aggrieved by police conduct.

The statute under which Mallie

Lewis was convicted provides that it shall be unlawful and a
breach of the peace for any person wantonly to curse or revile
or to use obscene or opprobrious language toward or with refer
ence to any member of the city police while in the actual per­
formance of his duty.
When this case was last before the Court, that ordin
ance had never been the subject of any sort of construction.
It had been upheld all the way along the line on its face.

It

had never in fact received any reasonable consideration.
In light of this Court's vacating the original judg­
ment and the remand to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, it has
once against affirmed the appellant's conviction, this time
with an opinion.
The position of the appellant that the opinion below
the Louisiana Supreme Court, is not a narrowing construction
of the ordinance, that it does not resolve the constitutional

5

problems, and that it leaves punishable language which is
merely opprobrious, language that this Court held in Gooding v.
Wilson cannot be published.

I think the point that most

clearly emphasises this is the provision in the statute that
the langauge need not only be spoken towards the police but may
be spoken merely with reference to the police.

This issue was

raised right from the very beginning, the problem with refer­
ence to the police,-the problem of statements made out of the
hearing of the particular police officer spoken about.
It is an apparentlv obvious defect in an ordinance
that might otherwise be made applicable to fighting words.

But

nowhere, nox*/here does the opinion of the Louisiana Supreme
Court below address that issue.

And vet it was very clearly

before the court, the dissent picked it up at great length
below, but the majority ignored it.

And I .submit that what the

majority did below was to justify that ordinance on its face,
which cannot be done under this Court's holding in Gooding.
Nov;, admittedly, the court below does refer to fight­
ing words on a

couple, of occasions in its opinions, but it

never articulates what the fighting words standard means,
whether it is the dictum of Chaplinsky, that fighting words are
those which are likely to provoke violence, or the mere utter,
ance of which inflicts injury, or the holding of Chaplinsky and
the holding of Gooding that the only language punishable is
that which is likely to provoke a violent response.

6
I think what the Louisiana Supreme Court did. below is
similar to what the California courts had done with the ordinance
involved in Cohen v. California, and in that case the late Mr.
Justice Harlan noted in a footnote that although the Supreme
Court of California had limited the scope of the ordinance to
utterances likely to result in violence, it had more or less
made a per se holding that all obscene language or epithets of
the type uttered by Cohen were in all cases likely to provoke
violence, and that is basically the way the Louisiana Supreme
Court below has avoided this Court’s holding in Gooding, by
simply deciding, okay, all opprobrious and obscene language .is
fighting words and that, is the end of it.

I think that circum­

vents this Court's holding completely.
I think an ordinance like this, because of the manner
in which it is enforced, and the courts in which it is enforced,
presents a good case for the application of the over-breadth
doctrine.

The ordinance has been on the books in Louisiana and

enforced in New Orleans for seventy-seven years, but until this
past couple of years has not been the subject of any appellate
decisions whatsoever.

It is not the sort of ordinance that is

going to be effectively narrowed on a case-by-case basis.

The

whole ordinance is over-broad, it. nrastbe thrown out, and stand­
ards set for how to write a good ordinance, how the legislative
authorities in New Orleans can address themselves to the
problems,

7
There is implicit in the opinion of the Supreme Court
below that an ordinance such as this can be justified as opposed
to the ordinance involved in Gooding because of the limitation
of the ordinance to language spoken at the police *

I think the

interests involved tend to cut the other way and, if anything,
the fact that this ordinance is limited to language spoken of
the police suggests that the standards should be even tighter
and more rigorous, and that this Court should assure that the
fighting words standard is not abused in this context.
1 think it is necessary to go back to the facts again,
'because I don't think it is clear at all that what Mallie Lewis
uttered were in fact fighting words.

it was an expression of

anger, as someone might pound their fist in anger or pull their
hair in anger, or simply if they were a person, of great selfcontrol say "I am angry."

The comment was directed at both

police generally, not. just the police officer there, tied in
with a statement that "I am aggrieved, I am going to complain."
I don’t think Police Officer Berner could legitimately
feel that the language addressed to him by Mallie Lewis was in­
tended to provoke him.

There is nothing in the record to sug­

gest that Officer Berner was provoked.
Q

Are you suggesting that in the heated exchange

of that kind people undertake to disecfc and analyse these things
as we are doing it here now properly here?
MR. REED:

It is not completely clear to me that it

s
was a heated exchange and, secondly, I would say in the context
of the citizen to a police officer, "I do expect that sort of
consideration."

A police officer, as the Court I know is

familiar with the comments in the model penal code, is accustomed
to language of this sort.

The citizen is not.

And a police

officer deals day to day with, situations in which people feel
hostile towards them.

Both the innocent and the guilty being

arrested or being accosted or investigated by the police are
going to feel aggrieved.

The innocent want to know why it is

happening to them, and the guilty realize that the game is up.
And the people with whom the

police are dealing with in most

circumstances feel some anger towards the police.
Q

Do you think that makes it tolerable and accept­

able then?
MR. REED:
anger, yes.

I think if it is a compulsive expression of

I think if it is fair for the police officer not

to consider it as a provocation, I think the answer is yes.
would like to discintuish certain kinds of words.

I

Let5s say a

defendant or.a citizen, says, "You god damm m.f. police, take off
your gun and I’ll show you who's boss" — well, that is a
challenge to the police officer right there, it is a challenge
to his authority, it is a dare, I dare you to do something.
The words uttered by Mallie Lewis here aren't that
kind of language.

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, in Cohen you

noted that the words uttered by the defendant there were somewhat

They were.

They were premeditated and that was the

way that he wanted to express himself»
out in advance.

He had time to think it

Mallie Lewis was acting in a stressable situa­

She was expressing anger the only way it appeared to her

to express anger, not —
Q
tension?

Well, was Chaplinsky a situation fraught with

Wasn't that an expression in anger?
MR. REED:
Q

Yes.

Was that an excuse there?

MR. REED:

Well, I would like to consider Chaplinsky,

it is right along that line.

We do not dispute the law of the

legal rule that was announced in Chaplinsky, that fighting
words are not protected speech.
ing words.

The question is what are fight­

X think the application of that standard to the

utterances expressed in Chaplinsky is no longer free from
doubt.

This Court said there that argument is unnecessary, the

"god damm racketeer" are fighting words.

I think argument today

might very well be necessary on that point.
111 Gooding, this Court said "god damn you, why don't
you get out of the road," while clearly expressing disgrace,
were not fighting words.
Q

Well, I —

Wasn't that tied to a construction given I think

by the Georgia court at an earlier date?
MR. REED:

Right.

But as I understand the Court's

opinion, it was used as an example of the fact that the Georgia

courts had been applying the ordinance there to situations that
did not involve fighting words, and that case was cited as an
example in which a jury issue was raised by that utterance, and
this Court was of the opinion that no jury issue was raised be­
cause those were, while words of opprobrium, were not clearly
fighting words.

And I would think the average person today

might feel that he was less likely to provoke a violent re­
sponse if he said to a trained police officer in a metropolitan
environment, "You are a god damn racketeer," than if he said to
a stranger down a country road, "God damn
road.”

you, get out of the

I personally would think I would be more likely to get

a violent response from the stranger on the country road, so I
think —
Q

I think the racketeer is redundant in the city,

in the metropolitan area.
[Laughter]
Q

Mr. Reed, the Chapllnsky definition of fighting

words and the one reaffirmed in Gooding was words that, by their
very utterance,- tend to incite an immediate breach of the
peace.

Now, I follow your argument that these words could not

incite a police officer to .immediate breach of the peace, but
apart from the police officer, what is the meaning of what the
Louisiana Supreme Court said in the sentence "We find" -- I am
reading from page 56 of the appendix — "We find that section
49-7 is not

offensive to protected speech? it is narrowed to

11
‘fighting words' uttered to specific persons at a specific time.
MR. REED:

All I can say about that sentence, Your

Honor, is that if. is contradicted by other parts of the opinion.
It is contradicted by saying wantonly cursing or revile or using
of obscene or opprobrious words are not protected means of com­
munication .
Q

The appendix at 56.
In other words, notwithstanding the quote from

Chaplinsky, actually the ordinance is read to embrace more than
just words that would provoke or incite an immediate breach of
the peace?
MR. REED:
Q

I think it is very clear that that is —

Where is that in the opinion?

MR. REED:

The prohibition is that section 49-7 are

self-explanatory.
Q

This is right following that sentence on the

bottom of 56?
MR. REED:

Right, 56 to 57.

"The prescriptions are

narrow and specific --- wantonly cursing, reviling, and using
obscene or opprobrious language.”

This Court has held that the

mere use of obscesnity is not fighting words.

The mere use of

opprobrious language is not fighting words.
Now, the court below does look at Chaplinsky, but
what is significant in the court’s reading of Chaplinsky is
nowhere dees the Louisiana Supreme Court, recognize that
Chaplinsky's conviction was upheld because New Hampshire had

12
narrowed the ordinance.

The Louisiana Supreme Court below refers

to Chaplinsky's conviction, refers to the ordinance, and then
says Chaplinsky’s conviction was okay, and it is okay here.
Never does the Louisiana Supreme Court start to think about the
construction issue, and I think the opinion is a justification
of the ordinance on its face.
Now, I suppose it would be possible to lift out of
there a section of the opinion and say this is what the Supreme
Court meant, and perhaps tell them what they meant.

And I don't

think it is clear, just reading the opinion as it stands now,
that —
Q

Well, tell me this:

If in fact this ordinance

were limited to words tending to incite an immediate breach of
the peace and not a police officer but some private citizen was
the one to whom words were addressed, would the words used here
be fighting words?
MR. REED:

The words used here, to

citizen—to~citizen

encounter, under a properly narrowed ordinance might very well
be considered fighting words, not necessarily, but they might
be.
case,

I think it would be a jury issue or judge issue in the
.as is the case in Louisiana.

But I think it would raise

a question.
Q

Do you think there is a factor to be considered

when, in balancing this idea that a policeman should be prepared
to take more than an ordinary citizen, that is the concept

13
expressed basically in your case, isn't it?
HR. REED:
Q

Yes, sir.

But in that process, do you think you have, to

take into account that the policeman who is a man who certainly
in New Orleans is wearing a pistol right on his belt, with
probably no jacket over it a good deal of the time of the year,
and that if they do get into a fight over it, if notwithstand­
ing our passing of how innicent these words are, they do in
fact get into a fight, that you are liable to have a rather
serious if not a fatal fight because of the presence of fire­
arms?
MR. REED:

Well, the question is, as I understand

fighting words, it is the person to whom the words are
addressed that is going to be the first to act.

Now, if after

these words are uttered the police officer says something and
the situation escalates, sooner or later —
Q

No, what I am talking about is the usual routine

that I thought was implicit, the police officer arrests him,
and then this escalates into a physical resistance of arrest,
a struggle, perhaps the possibility of this arrestee seising
the pistol or trying to .seise it.
MR. REED:

Well, that possibility exists whenever any

arrest is made, that the person will protest.

In fact, if

anything, it suggests why language like this, if the Court
agrees that it is inherently harmless, that is all the more

14
reason why somebody shouldn’t be arrested.

And Your Honor’s

comment that you note what usually happens would be that the
person would be arrested upon uttering something like this. I
don't think that is entirely clear.

I think there is inherent

in an ordinance such as this the possibility for abuse by the
police in its enforcement, similar to the sort of abuse that
was possible under the vagrancy ordinance which was criticised
in Papachristou.
If they police are call to a citizen-to-citizen en­
counter, the language used is reported to them, they will make
some judgment whether they think this is escalated to the point
where criminal sanctions are required, or they may simply ac­
commodate the interests by saying, well, he gets a little loud
but just stay away from him.

In a police-citizen encounter,

this gives the police officer tremendous amount of discretion
to make arrest where no other ground for arrest exists.
This argument goes somewhat beyond the record, but
you don't find armed robbers, murderers, burglars being charged
with those serious felonies and reviling the police.

You find

it in the situation of someone like Mallie Lewis who did nothing
else wrong, the situation of Yvonne Martin, and that record was
before the Court, too, in a related, case.

No other crimes

charged.
For example, let's take a situation where the police
deal repeatedly once a month with a known criminal on the

Street.

One day they come down and they say,

"Okay, up against

the wall, 't^re are going to stop you and frisk you," and the guy
says, "You m.f.’s, why are you always bothering me, man, why
don't you go bother somebody else?
Throng. "

I haven’t done anything

The police frisk him and they find nothing, right

then they have —- they are in a position where they can put
this guy away, they can bother him, send him to the trouble of
making bond, when they are really not offended by that language.
They expect that language in that type situation.

They may

very well be using this language themselves on occasion, a
lawyer might use it to his partner quietly in a court room
when taken by surprise by a witness he has called.

I don't

think the police in that context would be offended by that
language,
The existence of a statute like this gives the
possibility for the abuse of that statute by the police.

I

think there is a more significant First Amendment interest in
allowing citizens to criticize the police than there is in
allowing citizens to criticize citizens.
of this Court reflect that,

The libel decisions

in Time v, Pate, St. Araath v.

Thompson, this Court has held the police to be public official
unless —- entitled to somewhat less protection than a purely
private citizen from possibly libelous statements by the press,
by people running for political office.

And I think all the

decisions in the past show that public officials can be

criticized more harshly,, and that there is an interest in per­
mitting that sort of criticism.
To the extent that there might be a rationale for
allowing a broader prescription of speech, when that speech is
addressed to the police, that rationale is not addressed by the
ordinance here.

The question of interference is a very good

duct.

And Colten v Kentucky involved an

The statute was addressed to that sort of con­

It didn't even involve any obscene of opprobrious

language.

This ordinance, an ordinance of this type might be

upheld if it were addressed to interferences, but it is not.
Q

But it is addressed to language used to the

police?
MR. REED:
Q

Yes, but the limitations —

And at the very least the state court has de­

cided that the police aren't any less insensitive than' anybody
else or any lass sensitive or any more insensitive.
MR. REED:

I don't think they have decided that.

I

don't think they really attacked the question.
Q

Maybe they felt, this conviction wasn't worth

treating.
MR. REED:

Maybe that's possible.

They certainly

aren’t entitled to more protection unless it is on an inter­
ference type rcitiona.le.

But the statute ~~ there is no

17
construction in the statute and the statute on its face is not
directed at interference.
Q

Let’s assume that their opinion was construable

as limiting the statute to those words that in normal circum­
stances would incite, would tend to incite immediate violence.
Do you think these words addressed to an ordinary citizen would
— might very well be fighting words?

Now, if the state court

. your argument is that the First Amendment would forbid a
state legislature or a state co\irt from saying that these
words addressed to a policeman are fighting words?
MR. REED:

I think the Constitution requires that the

state court or the legislature enacting a law like this require
a focus on all the attendant circumstances surrounding the
evidence, and that they cannot adopt a per se rule that the
utterance here is in all circumstances fighting words.

It

should be noted that the court below did not have the
Q

Well, my question was whether you are arguing

that the First: Amendment would prevent a legislature from sayt

ing we don’t see any difference between the policeman and the
ordinary citizen, we will take in all the circumstances but
policemen are like citizens.
MR. REED;

Yes, I think the First Amendment would

prevent that because the First Amendment prevents the prescrip­
tion of free speech uniessvou can point to an identifiable
danger in that speech.

And the legislature simply can’t make

up identifiable dangers that do not exist.
Q
however the

What if a police court judge or police court jury,
issue of fact was tried in the court of initial

jurisdiction, had made a finding that he found in fact these
were fighting words as defined in Chaplinsky and Gooding, would
that at least remove one prong of your argument here?
MR. REED:

If he decided that they were likely to

provoke under the circumstances that they were likely to pro­
voke the average police officer to violence, yes, if that were
the finding, and I think that is what the finding has to be,
not the average citizen but the average police officer.
ordinance limits itself to the police.

The

I think it is appro­

priate that the standards should be those of the police, because
I don’t think — I think that is required because the police
are not as sensitive to language such as this as perhaps a
sixty-year-old woman would be, or even the average citizen
might be.
Q

There is nothing implicit in the totality of this

record that that is the determination

the highest court of

Louisiana has made?
MR. REED:

No, I don’t think so, Your Honor.

The. court

below did not have the record before it, and therefore I don't
think if they made a narrowing construction, it seems to me
that they had to look at the record to see whether the
appellant's speech fitted into that narrow construction, and it

19
is quite clear that at the time this case was originally re­
manded from this Court, there was an absolute necessity to
construe ’that statute, to limit that statute in some way.

On

its face, it is remarkably similar and not nearly as grave as
the statute involved in Gooding v, Wilson.

So since they

didn’t have the record before them, I don’t see how they could
possibly have made any finding along that line.

All they had

before them was Mr. Justice Powell's comment in the concur­
rence of the remand order of June 1972.
Q

Why didn’t they have the record before them?

We had it here.
MR. REED:

The answer to that is that the: application,

an application for writ

was made to Louisiana Supreme Court.

It does not require that the record be sent up.
cation for writ

If the appli­

is granted, the record is sent up.

When the

case came back down on remand, the Supreme Court of Louisiana
did not read this as forcing them to grant writ on the case,
order up the record from the Criminal District Court and con­
sider the whole thing.

That is the only possible explanation.

The Yvonne Martin case that was also remanded was argued twice
in the Louisiana Supreme Court, the first time without the
record and then they did subsequently order up the record in
that case.
Q

The first time around here they said writ is

refused the judgment is correct, or something like that?

2.0

MR. REED:

That is correct.

The judgment is correct

was that of the Criminal District Court of Appeals which upheld
the ordinance very clearly on its face.
Q

They didn't ask that the record be brought up to

them, but then when the case first came to us, we had the
record.
MR. REED?

Because I complied, with the rule of this

Court at that time, which was either had just been changed o,r
was being changed, that required that the record be sent up.
That is simply the reason why it was here and the reason you
had it.
Q

The record went back to the police court, the

municipal court?
MR. REED:
Supreme Court.

No, it did not go back to the Louisiana

Maybe it is still here, I don't know.

It was

my own copy, a copy that I had prepared I think that I sent up.
Q

Mr. Reed, I want to be sure I understand you.

I

have the appendix here, the evidence that is reproduced in the
appendix.

You are saying this was not before the court on this

remand?
MR. REED:
court.

The trial transcript was not before the

Footnote 1 to the majority's opinion says, "While we do

not have the record here before us, we note from Mr, Justice
Powell's concurrence that here the appellant uttered the words
"god damn m.f. police."

21

Q

WeII, I saw that but does that mean that even

this portion of the record was not before the court,- this por­
tion being what you have in the appendix, which has some of the
testimony of witnesses?
MR. REED:
Q

It was not?

MR. REED:
Q

That was not before the court.

No.

The only thing they had was what we sent down?

MR. REED:

The only thing they had was my original

application for writ back in 1970 or 1971, which I discussed
the case, the legal issues, but there was no transcript attached
to that application for writ.
Unless the. Court has any further questions, I thank
you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Reed.

Mr. Garcia?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SERVANDO C. GARCIA, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. GARCIA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Today I represent the City of New Orleans in the
matter presently before this Honorable Court.

I believe that

the main question before this Court today simply stated is
whether or not section 49-7 of the New Orleans Code is uncon­
stitutionally vague and over-broad, in violation of the First

22

and Fourteenth Amendments»

It is the contention of the City of

New Orleans that the ordinance as written clearly delineates the
contours of its prescription and obviously does not apply to
speech that is protected by the First Amendment, but rather
applies

.only to that speech which finds itself within the ex­

ceptions to the First Amendment.
As early as in 1940, in the case of -Q

Well, now, let's see, the exceptions, what do you

mean, the exceptions, you mean only the exception for fighting
words?
MR. GARCIA:

The exception for fighting words and the

exception for words as put forth in Chaplinsky.
Q

That’s for fighting words, that is tend to incite

to an immediate breach of the peace?
MR. GARCIA:

Mr. Justice Brennan, in Chaplinsky, it

states, the way I read it — excuse me, I am trying to get an
exact cite on it»
Q

You mean the lewd and obscene, the profane and

the libelous?
MR. GARCIA:

That’s correct.

Included in this cate­

gory are the lewd and obscene, the profane, the liberlous and
the insulting or fighting words.
Q

And you say that is what Chaplinsky stands for?

MR. GARCIA:
to Chaplinsky.

That is the interpretation that I give

Q

Gooding didn't give that interpretation, did it?

MR. GARCIA;
Q

In the Gooding case, I think —

Did it?

I thought Gooding interpreted

Chaplinsky as limiting in this context state power to make
criminal the use of utterance which tends to incite to immedi­
ate breach of the peace.
MR. GARCIA;
Q

Didn't it?

That is a correct wording, Your Honor.

Is that what this case is all about then?

Don’t

you stand or fall on whether or not your court has narrowed
this statute to such words?
MR. GARCIA;

That is not the contention of the City

of Nev? Orleans,.
Q

I see.

MR. GARCIA:

All right.
As I stated in the case of Cantwell

and Chaplinsky, the words that were uttered by the majority
opinion of the Court, in that case, Chaplinsky, the Court con­
cerns itself with appellations directed at a police officer,
as such is the case before this Court today.

In Chaplinsky,

the defendant told a marshal, you are a damn racketeer and a
damn fascist.

In the case of bar, the words used, by Mrs. Lewis,

I think the Court will agree, are of a much harsher tone and
import.

The likelihood of the utterance failing to incite the

average person to a breach of the peace is highly improbable
in the Mallie Lewis case.

There, going to your interpretation,

as far as requiring a disturbance or inciting of the peace, we

feel that in the Mallie Lewis case the use of the words g.d.m.f.
police certainly are adequate to incite a member of the Mew
Orleans Police Department or to incite him to a disturbance of
the peace.

Although we feel that the appellant's contention

is correct, that ha should not permit himself to —■ he should
exercise as much restraint upon his emotions so that he does not
permit himself to go to this extent to incite a breach of the
peace, we don't feel that a police officer should be penalised
simply because of his position as a police officer.

We feel

that he should be judged as an average man, as an average,
reasonable man, just as anyone who is a layman and not a police
officer should be judged.
Q

Well, if that is true, why is it limited to

police officers?
MR. GARCIA:

1 think there was a specific purpose in

the minds of the City Council when they —■ 7. can’t tell you ex­
actly what it is, but it is my interpretation that this particu­
lar ordinance applies to situations where police officers are
cursed profanities by members of the population, is a specific
narrow

instance of when the reviling statute applies to police

officers.
Q

Can you curse the mayor v7ithout being punished?

MR. GARCIA:
Q
punished.

Can you do -what?

Curse the mayor of New Orleans without being

25
MR. GARCIA:
Q

That depends on the —

Well, is there any ordinance that protects him

from being cursed?
MR. GARCIA:

The use of obscene words, the prohibition

against the use of obscene words.
Q

That applies to everybody?

MR. GARCIA:
Q

Yes, sir.

Is there any other group but the police singled

out for this special treatment in Maw Orleans?
MR. GARCIA:
Q

Mot that I know of, no, sir.

As to the over“breadth, does it apply to detec­

tives?
MR. GARCIA:
Q

Does over-breadth apply to detectives?

I say on the question of over-breadth, does this

ordinance apply to detectives, a member of the city police?
MR. GARCIA:
Q

Yes, sir.

So the detective who walks down the street, if

something calls him an m.f., that, is it?
MR. GARCIA:

That is correct, as long as he is a

member of the Mew Orleans Police Department.
Q

And if he and the mayor are walking side by

side, he has been, hurt but the mayor hasn’t?
MR. GARCIA:
both individuals?
Q

Yes.

If they were to direct the language to

26

MR. GARCIA:

If they were to direct the language to

both individuals, the language directed to the mayor could be
prosecuted under a separate ordinance, not the reviling ordin­
ances brought forth before this Court today.
Q

Then I ask why it is special for the police?

MR. GARCIA:

I think there is a need for it.

It is a

contention of the City of Mew Orleans that — and it has been
my experience as Assistant Attorney —- that this goes on quite
often, that citizens apparently, for what reason I don’t know,
feel that it is permissible or they can get away with reviling
New Orleans police officers, and I am sure officers of many
other cities around the United States, this represents a dis­
tinct problem.
Q

Well, while you are prosecuting — how many of

these cases do you have a week?
MR. GARCIA:

Approximately 50 percent of out* cases in

municipal court concern themselves with reviling the police,
where a police officer confronts —
Q

Fifty percent?

MR. GARCIA:

I am approximating, but I don't stand on

i

the accuracy of that figure, but this is
close.

I think it would be

This is in the average confrontation where a police

officer stops a — maybe not an upright citizen, but an indii

|

vidual who is suspected of committing a crime on the streest of
New Orleans, the attitude of the citizenry of New Orleans has

27
changed to the effect that they apparently have been responding
with these types of abusive words to the Hew Orleans policemen.
It has been brought forth by many members of the New Orleans
Police Department who I know personally.
Q

If I understand, this statute has been on the

books for seventy years?
MR. GARCIA;
Q
about?

That is correct.

What about all this new business you are talking

They needed it way seventy years ago.
MR. GARCIA;

I misunderstand your question.

What new

This apparently, this ordinance initially was

business?

apparently written for that very purpose, but my comment is
that it has become an exaggerated — the instances have exag­
gerated .
Q

The police can’t arrest, them for anything else,

so they arrest them for this?
MR. GARCIA:

I think if that argument ware true, that

the police could find more serious violations with which to
arrest someone if they merely wanted to inconvenience them or
rather to penalize them for no reason whatsoever.
Q

Well, rather

than to do that, they get them on

this one?
MR. GARCIA:

I am saying if that were their purpose.

I don’t believe that that is their purpose.
Q

Well, if they have got 50 percent of them, that

28
is a pretty good percentage,
MR. GARCIA:
G

I —

Mr. Garcia, I didn't understand you to say that

50 percent of all the cases in the police court in New Orleans,
Louisiana are brought under this ordinance.

I understood you to

say rather, that in your observation, just estimating, that in
about half the cases in that court, involve circumstances in
which there was some reviling of the police.
MR. GARCIA:
Q

That's correct.

Isn't that it?

MR. G2JICIA:

In a lot of instances — it is not solely

the reviling of police violations that I am talking about, in a
lot of instances they are charged with multiple violations of
ordinances.
Q

How many prosecutions under this ordinance would

you guess again?

Fifty?

MR. GARCIA:

No, I wouldn’t say — well, a lot of

times this particular ordinance is nol-prossed due to the
prosecution of a more serious one.

For instance, if an arrest

is effected for two or three violations and one of them we feel
we have a better case on, we will nol-pros

this one.

1 am

guessing that the majority of cases — I would have to say that
the overriding percentage of cases that come before the city
court in New Orleans, given each ordinance a percentage, the
reviling the police ordinance has a much greater percentage

29

than that of any other ordinance.
Q

It does?

MR. GARCIA;
Q

So the answer is still the same?

MR. GARCIA;
Q

Yes, it does.

What's the volume?

MR. GARCIA:
Q

Yes, sir.

The volume of cases per day?

Yes.

MR. GARCIA;

I would have to say anywhere from 30 to

35 per day for section B.
Q

We have four sections.

15 to 20 of them are prosecutions under this

ordinance?
MR. GARCIA:

Of course, I am not — I would have to

say that approximately 15 to 20 percent of them, and at least
up to 50 percent of them on some days.

I am approximating the

figures, but the majority of them, as opposed to other classi­
fications of crimes, are reviling the police.

And I don't know

whether this Court is having difficulty determining what the
reason is for this, but it has been my experience that in the
average confrontation between citizens of New Orleans and the
New Orleans Police Department, being a prosecutor for four
years, has almost always resulted in the use of obscene
language by citizens to the members of the New Orleans Police
Department.
Q

Are relationships that strained between the

30
police department —MR. GARCIA:

It is that bad between the New Orleans

and the citizens on the street,, yes, sir.
Q

Is it possible that one reason why the City

Council enacted a special ordinance for policemen and none for
the mayor is that the policemen are cut on the street exposed to
this and the mayor is not —
MR. GARCIA:
Q

Absolutely.

—* and for the same reasons they let the police

carry guns but the mayor probably does not?
MR. GARCIA:

Absolutely.

The police officers, of

course, are on the street daily and are subject to this abuse
daily, as I stated.

The mayor of course probably rarely if

ever comes into contact with this type of abuse and, if so,
there is an ordinance that would protect the mayor.

But I think

that is the reason for this specific ordinance relative to the
New Orleans police officers.
Q

Now, the dissenting opinion pointed out in this

case that, under the terms of the ordinance, this mother, Mrs.
Lewis, could have been prosecuted --- "The mother is punishable
under the ordinance" — I am reading — "for using disrespectful
language in her own living room as well as in the street and
not in the presence even of the police.”

In reading the court,

opinion, I can't find any disagreement with that construction
of the ordinance.

31
MR. GARCIA;

Well, although there may be no disagree­

ment with that construction
Q

Have I missed something, first of all, in the

court opinion?
MR. GARCIA:

Mo, I don’t believe you have.

But what

I am saying is that that may very well be true, that this type
of imaginative situation could occur, but under the overbreadth doctrine, which was quoted in the index, they have
certain guidelines which are to be used in scrutinizing the
over-breadth of certain ordinances, and the first one of these
is the degree of over-breadth, and it states in the Law Review
article specifically a law ought not be struck down for overbreadth unless it lends itself to a substantial number of
impermissible applications.

In this instance, I certainly

don't think that this would happen at all, and it certainly
wouldn't happen in a substantial number of instances.
Q

Where are these over-breadth guidelines?

Is

this something for the New Orleans Police Department or guide­
lines for -—
MR. GARCIA:
Q

Mo, sir, it is the Harvard Law Review.

What pages?

MR. GARCIA;

It is cited. — the document itself, we

don't have a cony of, but it is cited in the appendix.
Q

You are referring us to an article that you

haven't even read yourself?

MR. GARCIA:
Q

Oh, you’ve read it?

MR. GARCIA:
Q

Yes, sir, I"ve read it.

I have a copy of it.

Oh, I don’t need it.

Do you have anything in the

Yale Law Review, while you’re at it?
Q

How about this language that Justice Stewart was

drawing to your attention, and I took it as the hyperbole that
extravagant statements that sometimes come in dissenting
opinions which the majority doesn’t take the trouble to notice.
MR. GARCIA:

Also in a recent case, which was decided

by this Court, Mr. Justice Marshall stated in the majority
opinion that condemned to the use of words, we can never expect
mathematical certainty from our language, and I think this is —
Q

Well, the point is that this case was here once

before.
MR. GARCIA:
Q

That's correct.

And it was remanded to the Supreme Court of

Louisiana to reconsider in light of Gooding, with an invitation
to narrow it, to narrow it, the statute, to construe it in a
narrow way.

And as I read the court’s opinion, it not only

declined that invitation but left it just as open as the dis­
senting opinion said it is.

And he uses another example of

the fellow on the balcony looking down at the traffic policeman
trying to regulate the traffic in the French Quarter and says,
"Look at that stupid cop down there making an ass out of

himself," or whatever it is, and he's guilty of violating this
ordinance, and particularly with the invitation before the
highest court of your state to narrow this ordinance I would
have thought they might have taken issue with the dissenter's
characterization of the ordinance if they had not agreed with
it.
MR. GARCIA:

Well, I certainly — the only thing I

can say about the Louisiana Supreme Court's decision is what I
have read myself, which is substantially the same thing that
you have read, so I can't add to their reasoning in that de­
cision.

That ends my case.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Do you have anything further?

You have one minute

left, Mr. Reed.
MR. REED:

Unless the Court has any questions, Your

Honor, I have nothing.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
gentlemen.

Thank you very much,

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:30 o'clock p.m., the case was

submitted.j
