we will hear arguments

Gertz against Robert Welch, Inc.

Mr. Giampietro, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF
WAYNE B. GIAMPIETRO, ESQ.,
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This matter comes before the Court as a diversity
action for libel brought within the State of Illinois,
concerning an article published both in magazine and in
reprint form by an entity entitled Robert Welch, Inc.
The central thesis of this article was that there
was, in Chicago, a conspiracy headed or composed of
communists and allied persons to discredit the police of the
City of Chicago and that in this particular case, the form of
that conspiracy was to frame a police officer for the crime
of murder.
This police officer has shot a young man in the
back and the nan died almost immediately.

The police officer

has, in fact., been convicted of murder and i~ now serving
his sentence, after that conviction having, been affirmed by
the Illinois Cupreine Court.
r!

Under Illinois lav;, would the acts charged,

4
that is, this conspiracy to frame s be, in itself, criminal
act?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

Your Honor, I believe it would be.

I believe it would constitute, perhaps, a violation of two
statutes, number one, obstruction of justice and number two,
perhaps a criminal conspiracy to do so, so that I think that
under the laws of the State of Illinois, the things charged in
this article would, in fact, constitute a crime, yes.

Yes,

indeed.
The statements made about the Petitioner in this
matter did, in fact, charge him with being an integral part
of that conspiracy.

One additional statement about the

Petitioner I noticed in the article which is not set forth in
our brief states at the beginning of the article on page four
of the article itself that teenagers at a hot dog stand
would not know how to arrange the carefully-orchestrated
puolicity the case soon acquired and, of course, you are
correct, they wouldn't.

But Elmer Gertz, for instance, would.

And then the article goes on to state that he filed
civil suits on behalf of the parents of the deceased boy, whic
totalled $1 million,

I think.

I might point out that the statement that the
Plaintiff had filed civil suits on behalf of the parents of
the deceased and that he had appeared at the inquest and that,
perhaps, at one tine he had been a member of one of the

But other than that, all the rest of the statements in the
article are false and there was evidence in the record in
this case, testimony not by — not only by the Plaintiff but
also by others which indicated that these things were, in
fact, false.
Q

So —
Would you say that, Hr. Giampietro, under

Illinois law, is the statement that someone is a member of
tiie American Civil Liberties Union, is that defamatory?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

Got at all, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

and I would not argue that it is.

My only point is that the

statements regarding the various organizations to which the
Plaintiff had allegedly belonged are untrue.

Certainly, I

wouldn’t say that a statement regarding the American Civil
Liberties Union is defamatory in any way.
What is defamatory, I think, is the appellation
put upon that association by the Defendant, where the
Defendant says, "If you are a member of the American Civil
Liberties Union, you are a communist, because that is a
communist society," or words to that effect.
Q

Go these were just supporting facts, basically,

that they realized that the statement was actually libelous,
that the man was a communist?
MR. GIAMPEITRO:

That is correct.

That is correct.

Actually, that is the way in which the article chose to prove
or allegedly prove or state that the Plaintiff was a

6
communist.

They said, "You have belonged to ail of these

various communist organizations,"as well as

having said,

particularly in the caption under the Plaintiff's picture in
the article that he was a Leninist.

So that is just a

supportive statement.
I think v/e have a situation here, therefore,
where we depart from the situations which this Court has
considered in previous cases of this kind.

The Petitioner

was not, in fact, a public official of any kind.

I don't

think there is sufficient evidence in the record to indicate
that he was a public figure in that he was a person whose
very existence and presence would require public comment.
And now we come to the situation where you have
a fact situation where his actions were not, in fact, a part
of any matter of public interest and importance.

Until this

article was printed, the Petitioner had done absolutely
nothing in connection with the matter that was being
discussed.

He had made no public statements.

He did not,

in fact, have anything whatsoever to do with the’ criminal
prosecution of the police officer involved in this matter.
He had appeared at the inquest along with other
attorneys, had asked certain questions and that was all and,
parenthetically, the inquest itself really did not have any
direct bearing upon the ultimate trial and conviction of the
police officer because the inquest reached an open verdict

7
with.no recommendation of any kind, one way or the other.
So we have a person who really has acted in a way
which had nothing to do with this article until the statements
in the article attempted to connect him with that and then
the article didn't even really present any facts as to what
the Petitioner had done in connection with the statements
that they made about him.
this in the past.
conspiracy.”

They just said, "You have done

Therefore, you were part of this

But there is no supportive fact of any kind to

support the underlying assumption — not assumption, actually,
the charge, that the Petitioner was a part of any conspiracy.
Q

Was there any argument about the innuendo on

that score in the case?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

Any argument as to whether the

innuendo is, in fact, there?
Q

Yes.

MR. GIAMPIETRO:

I don't believe so, your Honor.
■ «t - ■

.

I don't think there is any question but that the thesis of
the article was that the Petitioner was, in fact, a part of
this conspiracy.

One of the — again referring to the

caption under his picture, it said "Leninist Gertz harrasses
huccio," words to that effect.

I don't think there can be

any question that that is what was intended to be said.
So we have a situation where the party was not
really involved in the matter that is being discussed, except

8
in the mind of the Defendant.
Q

Hr. Giampietro, Hr. Gerts was detained by

the parents of the decedent, was he not, to initiate civil
proceedings against the police officer?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:
Q

V/as that lawsuit initiated?

MR. GIAMPIETRO:
Q

There was a lawsuit.

Before the first publication.

So that had happened?

MR. GIAMPIETRO:
correct.

Yes, it was.

Before or after the first publication of —

MR. GIAMPIETRO:
Q

That is correct, sir.

That had happened.

That is

That is true.
Q

And you told us the outcome of the trial of

the police officer.

VJhat was the outcome of this civil action?

MR. GIAMPIETRO:

The was a civil action filed in

the Federal District Court in Chicago, alleging a violation
of the decedent's civil rights.

There was a ben.cji trial and

a judgment v/as awarded to the Plaintiff in the amount of
$20,000.

Q

Against the policeman?

HR. GIAMPIETRO:
against the policeman.
Q

Against the policeman and solely

That judgment has not been collected.

I suppose that trial and judgment occurred

after the publication?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

It occurred long after the

9
publication.
Q

Long after, umn hmn.

MR. GIAMPIETRO:

Yes.

It also occurred after the

initial conviction of the police officer for murder.

As a

matter of fact, if I recall, the court granted summary
judgment on the issue of liability for the plaintiff based
upon the conviction.
the facts of the case.

There was not actually a trial as to
There was, of course, an evidentiary

hearing on the matter of damages.
Q

Of damages.

MR. GIAMPIETRO:

That is correct.

And, of course,

that trial occurred long after this suit was instituted, as
well.
So I think we have a situation where there is, in
fact, no legitimate public concern here as to this
in this matter.

Plaintiff

I think to hold in a situation such as this

that the Plaintiff must prove actual malice as initially
defined in Rev/ York Times versus Sullivan, in effect, would
deprive him of a reasonable opportunity to obtain recompense
for the violation of his right of privacy.

I think that what

we have here Is not only a matter of the traditional laws of
libel, but I think we have a situation where we get into a
violation of the Constitutional right of the individual which
has been recognized by this Court.
That is, the rip;ht to be let alone, the right to

10

privacy.

I think that right is a

civil right which is

entitled to protection just as much as any other right not
to be subjected to an unlawful search and seizure in matters
of that nature.
Q

You don't have to rest your case on that

ground, I suppose?

If it is enough for your purpose that

the State of Illinois has

recognized this right and that

unless there is a Federal Constitutional restriction on that
recognition, as Illinois District Court, sitting in a
diversity case, should apply Illinois law.
HR. GIAMPIETRO:
Rehnquist.

That is correct, Mr. Justice

I might point out that the Illinois Constitution

provides that for every wrong, there shall be a remedy and
that has been held by the Illinois Supreme Court to be a
substantive provision, one under wich, if there is no known
remedy, the courts will, in fact, fashion a remedy.

That is

not just a statement of hope but is a statement of actual
Constitutional construction within the courts of the State of
Illinois.
of privacy.

I agree, we would not need to rely upon the right
But I think that it is, in fact, a valid right

that is held by all people.
As this Court has pointed out, the lines between
the Government and private action are becoming blurred, more
and more.

I think that in a situation such as this that in

many instances, the press can do just as much damage to an

11
individual as the Government can, especially in a sensitive
area such as this.

We have, of course, the problem where

there is alleged prejudicial pretrial publicity.

That is just

another area in which the press can do damage and, of course,
the press must have freedom and I would not, for one moment,
quarrel with the right of the freedom of press.

I think it is

one of our most basic rights.
On the other hand, I think there must be some
check upon that right.

There must be some way to protect the

rights of the individual, the private party who is unknowingly
and.

unwantingly and unwillingly thrust into the public lime­

light only as a result of what the Defendant has done.
Nov/, I know many of the opinions written by the
various members of this Court in other cases in this area
have expressed a great concern about the possibility of
self-censorship on the part of the press.

I think, in some

areas, however, that such self-censorship is not entirely a
bad thing.

I think in some areas the press ought to have to

stop and consider what they are about to do to an individual
and, again, I am limiting my argument only to private
individuals, those who have not become involved by their own
actions in public matters.
So I v/ould think that perhaps some kind of limitation
upon the right of the press in this one particular area is,
indeed, appropriate because, as I have indicated, I think

12
that the rights that are being protected by libel are not just
common-lav/ rights but are, in fact, Constitutional rights.
Q

May I ask this question?

You made a statement

that there was no public or general interest in the represen­
tation in the civil suit by Mr. Gertz.
Who determines whether or not there is a public or
general interest in a libelous statement?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

Mr. Justice Powell, I would

suppose that the ultimate arbiter as to whether there is or
is not public interest must be the courts and,, certainly,
ultimately, this Court.
I think some guidelines can be laid down to that
determination.

I think that if the statement is about

what

the person has done, for example, if the statements in this
article had said that in conducting the civil suit, the
Plaintiff had done certain particular things, then, perhaps,
that might be a situation which constituted appropriate
comment which would then bring into play the requirement that
the Plaintiff prove actual malice in the Constitutional sense.
I think that, however, in this case, there was no
such statement.

We have a linking of the Plaintiff with

something that he had absolutely nothing to do with.
Q

Did the other newspapers in Chicago carry

stories to the effect that Mr. Gertz had been employed in
the private litigation?

13
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

I think there were one or two

small stories which appeared on one day, on one day only,
which just noted in about two paragraphs that a civil suit
had been filed on behalf of the parents and that — and I
think they did mention that Mr. Gertz had been one of the
attorneys that filed it.
Q

Suppose the Daily News and Chicago Tribune

had both published stories on the front page about the
institution of this suit?

Would the fact that the press

itself had considered this story of sufficient interest to
give it that play establish that it was a matter of public
or general interest?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

I think I would have to say that

that would, indeed, be a very strong factor in reaching that
conclusion.

I think, certainly, to a certain extent, the

press might be allowed to determine what, in their opinion, is
a matter of public interest.
Q

Well, doesn't this enable the press to

decide, in almost every case, what you said might be a
Constitutional question, that is, whether or not a particular
story is or is not a matter of general or public interest?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

I think it might, indeed, and that

is one of the things that concerns me, that the press may be
able to, in effect, just by doing what it wants to do or
what it chooses to do, thereby insulate itself.

That is what

concerns me because if we allow that to happen, then we are,
in effect, saying that the individual has no protection.

He

has no way in which to gain recompense for the damage that is
done to him and I am, I must say, very concerned about that.
Q

But isn't that just about what the lead opinion

in Metromedia adds UP to?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:
does.

Mr. Justice Stewart, I think it

I think it does, indeed.
Q

Your only answer is, well, that wasn't an

opinion of the court?
HR. GIAMPIETRO:

Well, I would say, yes, number one,

that was not the opinion of the court.

Humber two, I would

say, perhaps that It ought to be reexamined in fee situations
such as this, where the Plaintiff is not someone who was, in
fact, an actor within the manner that is being spoken about.
Q

Well, I think if you read Justice Brennan's

opinion carefully, you will see that he pointed out that
Mr.Rosenbloom had made himself the central actor and figure.
It wasn't the press that made him the central actor, it was
the nature of the business in which he engaged, namely,
selling the pornographic — allegedly pronographic material.
HR. GIAMPIETRO:
Q

I would agree, your Honor.

And now, this lawyer, is quite different

from Mr. Rosenbioom.
HR. GIAMPIETRO:

Q

That is exactly right.

Well, actually, do I correctly read what the

/

15
trial judge did here?
did he not?

He used rather a two-step approach,

He said, first, that the killing of a criminal

suspect and the policeman's subsequent indictment at a time
x?hen the police, generally, were the subjects of attack
within the community, commanded wide public attention and
interest.

Therefore, it was a subject of general public

concern.
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

Then he went on to say that that

is not the only thing that has to be established.

There

also has to be established whether or not Gertz thrust himself
into the vortex of that controversy and concluded, rightly or
wrongly, that, yes, he had thrust himself in by reason of his
representation of the family in the civil suit against the
police officer.

Wasn’t that it?

MR. GIAMPIETRO:
Q
tions.

That is correct.

And so I gather you are arguing two proposi­

The first is that this was not a — the killing was

not a subject of general public interest and, secondly, that
even if it was, you cannot say that this attorney thrust
himself, as the court found, into the vortex of that
controversy.

Is that right?

MR. GIAMPIETRO:

Let me say, in response to that,

Mr. Justice Brennan, let me say that I don't think for the
purposes of my argument we even have to get to the qeustion
of whether the killing by the police officer was not a matter

16
of public interest and Importance,

My point is simply that

the Plaintiff was not, in fact, involved in that situation,
Q

That is saying, was not in the vortex of that

subject.
MR. GIAMPIETRG;

That is correct.

So I think it

really doesn’t make any difference to my position whether the
killing itself by the police officer was or was not a matter
of public interest.
Q

But you can readily concede that the killing

of this man was a very important matter of public interest,
the killing by a policeman, but that the civil suit for
recovery was arguably quite a different matter.
MR. GIAHPIETRQ:

That is correct.

That is correct.

That is right and I would, indeed, agree with what you have
said.
Speaking in line, I should say, of the opinion and
decision of the District Court, I think I should, at this
point, point out that I think that his actions deprived the
plaintiff, in fact, of due process.

His actions in not

allowing a new trial for the Plaintiff, I think, was clearly
erroneous.

He informed the Plaintiff and instructed the

jury that insofar as he was concerned, this was a normal
libel case under normal Illinois rules of libel and so
submitted it to the jury and the jury reached its
determination on that basis.

17
Subsequently, on the motion for new trial, he
concluded that he had had a change of heart, that he concluded
that the Plaintiff was a public figure or had thrust himself
into the vortex and that the plaintiff had been required to
prove actual malice, that he had not done so and, therefore,
he granted judgment, notwithstanding the verdict.

I think

that was clearly erroneous.
0.

He should have had an opportunity to prove

actual malice as long as he was now going to apply the
Constitutional test and not just the state law rules,
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

That is correct.

I think, clearly,

we should have been entitled to a new trial at that point.
we

If

were, in fact, or are, in fact, required to prove actual

malice, we must be given an opportunity to do so.
that respect the District Court was clearly in
Court of Appeals

didn’t mention that at all.

I think in

error.

The

So I think

insofar as that point is concerned, that, clearly, this case
ought to be reversed and remanded for purposes of a new trial
at the very least.
I think, in speaking in matters of this kind,
that we are actually talking about the conduct of the people
involved.

It Is the conduct of the Petitioner which makes

him a subject of articles or newspaper stories of this kind.
I think that it is only fair to judge the Defendant, then,
by its conduct and I think the conduct of the Defendant in

18
this case, even without the actual requirement by the trial
judge that we prove actual malice, I think the evidence shows
that the Defendant in this case was, in fact, guilty of
actual malice in any event.
Q

Even on this record?

MR. GIAMPIETRO:

Even on this record.

I think

that —
Q

Hr. Glampietro, this is the complete trial

record?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:
didn’t reprint everything,
in the Appendix.

Well, the Appendix didn’t — we
all of the testimony of everyone

There is testimony of other persons.

I

would say that I think the Appendix contains the majority of
the testimony.
Q

Well, have you filed the complete trial

transcript?
MR. GIAMPIETRO:

With the clerk, yes, we have.

The Defendant admitted that the statement, the
gist or sting of the article was not true and I might point
out at this point that, in Illinois, under the laws of libel,
a Defendant is not required to prove each and every element
of what It says to be true in order to have a defense.

All

that .it needs to show is that the gist or the sting of the
article is true and that the central thrust of the article
is true, even though certain of the minor points might be

19
false.

That would not deprive the Defendant of his defense of

truth.
Secondly, Illinois lav; does not — has other
protections.

They have the innocent construction rule, which

requires that if a statement can be read, either innocently
/

1

or in a guilty manner, it must be read Innocently.

So there

are substantial protections for the Defendant.
I think that the continued publication of the
article for at least a year after the suit was brought, with
no attempt to determine the truth, the fact that the
Defendants admitted at trial that the statements about the
Plaintiff were not true, the fact that there was a great
rushing to put this article in print, even though there was
a monthly publication which could have waited a month, is
another element of malice.
So I think, on this record, that there is, in
fact, enough evidence to show that there was actual malice
in the Hew York Times Constitutional sense.
Finally, I’d just like to make one final comment
about the assessment of costs by the Court of Appeals.

We

feel, in a situation such as this, where the Court of
Appeals extended the rules in regard to libel and extended
the Constitutional protection, that it was grossly unfair to
saddle the Plaintiff with the entire costs of that appeal,
especially since he had prevailed in the trial court and

20
that in th$ exercise of the supervisory jurisdiction of this
court that the costs ought to have been apportioned at least
equally between the parties.
Q

What did they amount to, Mr. Glampietro?

MR. 0IAMPIETR0:

In the neighborhood of $5,000.

It

was a substantial sum.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Watts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF
CLYDE J. WATTS, ESQ.,
MR. WATTS:

Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the

Court:
The first impact upon myself as Counsel in this
case is whether the basic issue is not equal justice under
the law.

Personally, I have a great deal of sympathy for

Counsel's position in this case.

I have been on both sides

of this issue and am on both sides of it at the current time.
I feel that the penudlum has swung, as it must, in the
administration of justice.
I feel that the Court, as, very properly, it
should, is evaluating the present status of the rule of
freedom of speech.
Incidentally, during my research in the Federal
Digest, I find there are 57 pages under key number 90, of
Constitutional lav/ in the advance sheets of freedom of speech.

21
But the issue that I respectfully submit to the Court in this
case is, under the law as existent at the time the trial
courts very reluctantly reviewed his action in the case, very
reluctantly granted a judgment notwithstanding the verdict,
did the trial court —
Q

The reluctance didn’t show up very much when

it came to this extraordinary assessment of costs.
MR. WATTS:
Q

Your Honor may be right about that.

It was a great change of heart, wasn’t It,

from the beginning of this case to the end?
MR. WATTS:

Well, I am at a disadvantage in that,

sir, in that I did not participate in the trial of the case
and I didn't accurately answer the Chief Justice's question
there, other than just what the record does show.

But I do

know that I presented the motion NOV and it was very
virogously resisted and was very carefully considered by the
trial court.
The trial court considered in simple language
that application of the

law under the New York Times family

of cases required the conclusion that there had been no
proof of actual malice, either knowingly false or in reckless
disregard for the truth.
That judgment was carefully and exhaustively
considered by the Appellate Court with the very piercing and
penetrating decision that is summarized for the purpose of

22

ascertaining whether the

case does simply involve equal

justice under the law when Judge Stevens, in his concluding
paragraph, ended with these words: "Finally —"
Q

Sir?

Where are you reading from?

MR. WATTS:

I am reading from page 10 of the

decision of the Court of Appeals.
Q

Where

MR. WATTS:
Q

does it appear?
I don’t — it’s in —

In the Appendix?

MR, WATTS:

Yes.

"Finally, by reference to matters

not in evidence, Plaintiff, in effect, asks us to take
judicial notice of a reckless disregard for the truth on the
part of the John Birch Society and its affiliates."
Nov/, there we come into the issue.

Counsel has

very ingeniously, if not ingenuously, injected into this
case the fact, falsely, that the John Birch Society said
General Eisenhower was a communist, that any number of
people, high-level individuals in the United States, were
communists.

There again, this group has received the same

image-making, the same adverse publicity, as exists all too
frequently in the United States.
It has been my observation that this image-making
can go to the extent of subconsciously even convincing a
judge that here is an outfit that deserves to be accepted.
The trial — the Appellate Court goes on to say,

23
"Unquestionably, a judge’s sympathetic reaction to the point
of view expressed in an article which had been found to
contain libelous matter may make it easier for him to afford
a publisher First Amendment protection."
In other words, if I were sympathetic to the John
Birch Society, it wouldn't be very hard to find in this case
that there had been no proof of malice.
We cannot, however, apply a fundamental protection
in one fashion to the New York Times and Time Magazine and
in another way to the John Birch Society.
And that, I respectfully suggest to the Court is
the basic issue in this lawsuit.
Both courts very carefully evaluated the article
and I say respectfully to the Court that this article at no
place within its perimeter caused Mr. Gertz unkindness.

It

merely pointed out that there is a very critical situation
existent in Chicago.

There is, admittedly and it was

documented and established, a strategy by the communist
enemy to downgrade the police by false charges of police
brutality.

There is an effective program a.foot to destroy

the confidence of the American people in their police
protectors.
Q

Where do we —

MR. WATTS:

What you are telling us now, is this part of

the record?

HR. WATTS:

Yes, sir.

the Court please, several very credible articles, one in
the Reader’s Digest, outlining the problem of the communist
strategy of downgrading the police.
How, the author of this article recognized that
situation existed in America.

He recognized the problem of

He analyzed, primarily, the case

as the court was stating, the referonce to Mr. Gertz is very
very incidental to this article.
Q

Mr. Watts?

MR. WATTS:
Q

Yes?

I understood Counsel for the Petitioner to

say that it had been conceded at the trial that the article
was libelous.

Do you deny that?

MR. WATTS:

Well, sir, I was — as I say, I was

not at the trial.
Q

What does the record show?

MR. WATTS:

As I get the record, there was an

inference that the article was not libelous because if it had
been libelous, it would have involved reckless disregard for
the truth or knowingly false.
It was conceded that some of the remarks in the
article were false.
Q

I am speaking noxv about common law libel.

MR. WATTS:
Q

Yes, sir.

On page 23 of the Appendix, it states, "The

file on Elmer Gertz in Chicago Police Intelligence takes a
big, Irish cop to lift."
MR. WATTS:
Q

Yes, sir.

Mow, as a lawyer, I assume you would concede

that that is libelous, per se.
MR. WATTS:
Q

I doubt it, sir.

You doubt it?

MR. WATTS:

Mr. Justice, I doubt that that, in

effect, the police investigators could have a file on a
lawyer without anything criminal appearing in the file.
In other words, as we pointed out in the article,
he belonged to several organizations that had been established
as fronts, at least, and, perhaps — I couldn’t answer that
specifically because, as I say, I did not participate in the
trial.

But under Illinois law, the inference and impact of

the argument — I mean of the article, absent the Hew York
Times concept, would be libelous in Illinois,

I think the

26
Court is accurate in that observation.
But, under the New York Times concept, the both
courts, the trial court — I say again reluctantly, and the
appellate court, very carefully analysed the action of the
editor of Anerican Opinion in taking the article of the
author Stanley without any knowledge of any falsity and I
suggest again that there is nothing in that article that
says that Mr. Gertz was a communist — as Counsel so
repeatedly suggests in his brief.
There is nothing in the article that says even —
that I could find, that said he had. done any criminal acts
whatsoever.
The only thing the article says is that in this
very critical situation where an officer in Chicago is
charged with murder, which is a continuation of the
communist strategy of destroying the police, in that situation,
at a critical time, Lav/yer Gertz appeared at an inquest and
the inference in the article was that he — that his
influence at the inquest — and raised the question •— it
didn’t 3ay in so many words — raised the question as to
whether the appearance'of an attorney of the influence in
this type of — in this area of public concern may have had
some impact on the charge against Officer Nuccio and,
possibly, on the covering up of certain evidence.
For instance, as 1 read the article, there was

27

never any evidence brought out about the young lad having a.
knife and there was an inference there, a question raised as
to what happened to that evidence?
Q

And the only —

Well, Mr. Watts, I think a lot of the points

you are covering are probably matters of Illinois libel law
as to how the article should be read and that sort of thing,
that I think this Court would be disinclined to review, apart
from the New York Times type of issue.
MR. WATTS:
Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

I agree with that specifically,
It has nothing to do with this lawsuit.

The sole issue in this lawsuit is, did the trial court and did
the appellate court apply New York Times in the concept that it
would apply in protection of the New York Times or protection
of Reader8s Digest or in protection of Time or Life Magazine,
did it apply the same rule with respect to this American
Opinion that it would have applied with any other publisher
and I feel sincerely —
Q

On relevance, Mr. Watts, you know, there is

a question of whether New York Times applies at all.
MR. WATTS:

I would — xvould the Court please

elaborate that just a little so I could understand it a
little better?
Q

Well, isn't there an issue in the case as to

whether or not the knowing or reckless falsehood rule of
New York Times applies at all in this case?

28
MR. WATTS:

Well, to me, It is so apparent, as

the trial court and the appellate court pointed out, that
New York Times specifically requires the conclusion that the
author — the editor of this magazine —
Q

That isn't my question.

My question is

whether that rule applies at all or not.
i-lR. WATTS:

Oh.

Well, I cannot see how it can

possibly be avoided in the application of this case since it
is a publication, since it involves a question of whether
there was malice.
Q

Under New York Times, whether the —

I know, but under the New York Times, the

New York Times talked about a public official.
MR. WATTS:

Oh, oh, excuse me, sir.

Here is the

rule — here is my —
Q

And a public and —

MR. WATTS:
Q

Yes, here is my knowledge as to that —

So, how do you get under the New York Times

rule, sir?
MR. WATTS:

All right, number one, as pointed out

by the appellate court, this —
Q

Well, let me ask you, it is an issue in this

case?
MR. WATTS:
Q

Yes, sir, it certainly is.

So it isn't — the sole issue just isn't

whether the two courts below correctly ruled as to whether or

29

not malice liras proved?
MR. WATTS:
Q

That is not the only issue.
No, sir.

The issue is whether it was of any necessity

at all to prove malice.
HR. WATTS;

Yes, sir.

I would say it was broader

ruled that New York Times applied.
Q

How, does it apply?

May I just ask, Mr. Watts, do I correctly

read what both the court of appeals and the trial court said.
about this case?

Neither thought that this was a case

involving a public official.
MR. WATTS:
Q

Hot quite, sir.

Oh, you don’t?

MR. WATTS:
Q

You agree with that, don't you?

Iio, sir.

Is this attorney a public official?

MR. WATTS:

Well, I think, under these circumstances

where he appeared at the inquest and actually injected himself
into the trial, I think he is a de facto public official.
Q

Oh, I see, and is he also a public figure?

MR. WATTS:

I was going to answer that.

I was

going to suggest that in answer to —
Q

Is he also a public figure?

MR. WATTS:

I think very definitely he is a public

figure.
Q

All right, now, but if I read what the trial

case involving either public official or public figure but,
rather, a case involving an issue of public interest —

Yes.

Yes?

What are you going to say — what would you
I

say, if we disagreed with you that this lawyer was either a
public figure or a public official?
Let's assume we disagreed with you on that.

I think there would be one other

relatively minor collateral problem that the Court would

have to approach.

This is a matter of very definite public

Mr. Gertz, admittedly, is a part of a — a very

complicated and very vital matter of public interest.
Assuming that he was not a public official de facto,
as I respectfully suggested, assuming that he was not — had
not injected himself into the area as a public figure, then
the question would arise as to whether, not being a public
figure, whether he indirectly and rather in a minor capacity,
is involved in a very vital public controversy.
Q

I believe —

Or whether he thrust himself into it.

MR. WATTS:
Q

Yes, sir.

The language that we have been using is,

"Thrust himself into the vortex of public controversy."
MR. WATTS:

That is —

32

MR. 'WATTS:

It isn't the sole issue.

It is an

issue, and I'd like to elaborate on this, with the Court's
permission, that wo have this final issue of a controversy of
extreme public interest, where the author of the article
recognized that this man had injected himself — let's
assume not a public figure — not had become even a public
figure — but he had been injected in such a manner as it
was a matter of public interest, in a public

controversy.

I believe sincerely that the concept of New York
Times

would protect the author in the absence of knowingly

false or reckless disregard for the truth, in making the
relatively minor comments in this big article involving the
persecution of Officer Huccio.
Even though Mr. Gertz was not even a public figure,
I believe that the author would be protected by the concept
of New York Times where we have a very critical public issue.
Q

Let me ask you this question, Mr. Watts.

MR. WATTS:
Q

Yes.

Suppose, instead of bringing a civil suit

against the police officer for the death, that Mr. Gertz
had been retained by the family to collect on an accident
insurance policy where there was some debate?

Would you say

that he had thrust himself into the vortex of the controversy?
MR. WATTS:
Q

I should doubt it.

You doubt it, then?

No, sir.

33
MR. WATTS:

Yes, sir.

Unless he was participating,

as the article indicated,
Q

But the root factor is the death —

MR. WATTS:
Q

Yes, sir.

— of this man.

MR. WATTS:

But I don’t see hoi* a publisher — and,

again, I am on Counsel’s side of this phase of the lawsuit —
I don't see how a publisher can just expand New York Times
all over the world.

I feel that it must be reasonably

relevant and the relevance in this case is that he got —
appeared, according to the article, at the coroner’s inquest
in the support —
Q

Did he take — you've mentioned that, now,

three or four times.
MR. WATTS:

Did he take any part in the inquest?
Yes, he interrogated witnesses and the

inference in the article is that, due to his cleverness, due
to his capacity in the community, there was an impact on the
court there that possibly caused the questions raised as to
whether that could have caused the charge against Officer
Muccio.
Q

But his part was not as a public officer of

the State of Illinois, was it?
MR. WATTS:
Q

Sir?

His part was not as a public official?

MR. WATTS:

Well, except where he appeared,

34
voluntarily at the inquest and asked questions in support of
an investigation of Officer Nuccio, I have suggested
respectfully to the Court that he then became even a de facto
public official.
Q

So I have three —
Well, did he have a right to do that, as a

lawyer?
MR. WATTS:

And when he did —

Would that be a duty?

MR. WATTS:

Yes, sir, he did.

Yes, sir, and he exercised it;

And you said that the whole purpose of the

article was to show how he Influenced the Coronerfs inquest

They didn't decide anything.

MR. WATTS:

I didn't say the sole purpose.

MR. WATTS:

in the trial.

HR. WATTS;

Yes.

Is it in the record?

It’s my understanding in the

record that the Coroner's inquest left open the —

Well, I don't consider that great influence.

MR. WATTS:

again, I —
Q

And you keep talking about the persecution

of this police officer.

Is this the sane police officer.

Is

this the same police officer that was found guilty?
MR. WATTS:
Q

Yes, sir.

And you call that persecution?

HR. WATT'S:

No, sir, I do not call that persecution,

but, I —
Q

I’m sorry, I misunderstood you.

MR. WATTS:

— do think there is enough of a wide­

spread public issue to where an author could reasonably
raise the question.
In other words, there has been, in America,
persecution of police officers and this article was
intended to raise the question of whether our Officer Nuccio
was actually guilty or was being victimised by this widespread
strategy of persecuting police officers and that is the area
that I feel sincerely brings this case squarely within the
rule of the New York Times of dealing as to whether the
editors were accurate, as to whether they made a mistake,
the Court is not concerned.
The question is, at the time this article was

3b
published, was it for the purpose of raising the question as
to whether persecution of police officers was a widespread
public phenomenon, a strategy of the communist advancement,
which, incidentally, has

never been curbed nor even been

exposed adequately, so 1 feel that an article of this kind
provides a public purpose in raising in the minds of the
American people the perimeters of and the nature and extent
of, the power of unseen forces to downgrade our police.
And I feel that insofar as that is concerned,
insofar as they are raising the question of the propriety of
Hr. Gertz’ activities in connection with this, the case, as
found by the trial and the appellate courts is squarely
within Hew York Times.
I don’t think there is any way, without abolishing
Hew York Times, that the author of this — the publisher of
this article, can be deprived of the protection requiring
proof of actual malice.
Q

Wall, on that argument, I would think that

you would have to apply the rule to almost anything, to any
kind of a report.
MR. WATTS:

Well, there again, we come into the

fact that freedom of speech, having —
Q

So, why don’t you just embrace the idea that

anything of substantial public interest is covered by New
York Times?

37
MR. WATTS:

I should think it would go almost to

that extent and there, again, I am being ordered to —
Q

Or, even insubstantial to the public interest?

HR. WATTS:

— to identify the perimeter of a

general rule which I just, frankly, feel incompetent to do so,
but I do sincerely feel that so long as New York Times exists,
an activity of this type, where the author and the publisher
raise an issue as to what has occurred, where they have not

Q

So a newspaper discussing, say, a particular

serious disease, a situation with respect to a communicable
disease in the community, and in the course of discussing that
disease and its existence and extent and the trends of it, it
incidentally says that somebody has that disease in the city
and it so happens that it is false, absolutely false and let's
assume that under standard rules, that that would be a libel
per se.
Mow, there is no question that it is a matter of
public interest, that this disease that kills, say, 10,000
people a year, is a very vital matter.

But would you suppose

that the Mew York Times \tfould be applicable to that?

Well, Mr. Justice White, I feel so

incapable of riding the perimeters of this rule that

all 1 can do is raise questions and the impact that I have of

Excuse me, sir?

You have the same situation as — or even a

stronger one, I should suppose, than Mr. Rosenbloom’s case in
Rosenbloom against Metromedia, where the only injection of
himself he did into any vortex was just to run a magazine
stand.
Q

It was selling girlie magazines and the

alleged libel was that he sold girlie magazines.
How, in some places, Mr. Watts, it would be
regarded as libel per se by some people to be called a John
Bircher, a member of the John Birch Society.
MR. WATTS:
Q

I recognize that.

Then, I take it from your response to the

prior questions that you have subjected yourself to being
called a John Bircher by appearing in this case?
MR. WATTS:

And if I have, sir, done so, I feel

that the person who raised that question, unless he was
knowingly false or in reckless disregard for the truth, I
think he is certainly protected by the rule.
And there again, as I say, the John Birch

Society has a very, very adverse public image that has been
built up over a period of years and I am sympathetic with any
concept that would put the piercing hand of truth, the
finger of truth on all of these problems that are faced by
our society.

But the fact remains, editors and authors are

entitled to the protection of New York limes concepts in
cases involving public controversies in matters in which the
public is vitally interested and this certainly, by any
theory, any approach that we make, this is 'a matter in which
the public was supremely Interested —

By your test, everything in a newspaper

MR. WATTS:

I think so, and I believe even the

little editor of the funnies was not in reckless disregard
for the truth, if he presented me as a screwball, a crackpot,
and he was in reasonable good faith about it, I think he'd
be protected by Mew York Times.

Well, first of all, I'd like to,

perhaps, correct a misimpression I may have had in regard to
the matter of costs.

The actual costs with which were

taxed was just slightly over $2,000 and.they were taxed by
the

Court of Appeals, not by the District Court.

So I Just

wanted to clean up any misimpression I may have made on that
score.
I think that any argument that the article did not
call the Plaintiff a communist
without a difference.

is really a distinction

The article says, ,TThe only thing

Chicagoans need to know about Gertz is that he is one of the
original officers and has been vice-president of the
Communist; National Lawyers Guild, which

has been described by

the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities as ’One of the
foremost legal bulwarks of the Communist Party' and which
probably did more than any other outfit to plan the communist
attack on the Chicago police during the 1968 Democrat
Convention."
If they didn't call him a communist, they came so
close at to make no difference at all, I think.

I don’t

really think there is any question as to what the damage,
what the gist or the sting of the article was all about.

One final comment, I think, in regard to whether
attorneys do become, in essence, public figures and public
officials by just becoming involved in cases of this kind, I
think the result is not that attorneys will be harmed.

I

don’t think that is the gravest result of such a holding.
I think the gravest result would be that clients
