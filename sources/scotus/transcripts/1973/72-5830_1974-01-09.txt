P R O C E E DING S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 72-5830, Patterson against Warner»
Mr» Higinbotham.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE R. HIGINBOTHAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises from the State of West Virginia»
It was a three-judge federal court be left-/ that held a State
statute in the State of West Virginia as being constitutional.
That statute provides that one who seeks to appeal
from a hearing and a judgment, of a justice of the peace
in the State of West Virginia, is required to post a double
bond, a bond twice the amount of the judgment.
We challenge -that as unconstitutional, denying
equal protection and due process of law.
Before I begin xcLth the merits of the case, I
would like to deal with the subject of mootness.

We have

made the unusual move, perhaps, for an appellant who is
bringing the case before the Court, of suggesting that our
case may be moot.
I would like to point out to the Court that I am
not arguing for mootness, that I am fulfilling what I believe
is my duty to the Court in informing the Coux*t of all the

4
issues and all the circumstances of the case.

That there vras

a case in the State of West Virginia that went to the State
Supreme Court in West Virginia, that was virtually identical,
practically it's not much different.
That case raised the same issues as are presented
here.

The West Virginia Supreme Court declared the judgment

of the justice of the peace in that case void.
Another case, an older case, by the West Virginia
Supreme Court said that when you have a pecuniary interest
of a justice of the peace, in his judgment, then the judgment
is void, ab initio.

That was in a criminal context.

The State Supreme Court in this Reece case, that’s
the name of the case, Reece vs. Gies —
QUESTION:

That’s since the judgment below?

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
yes, sir.

Since the three-judge court,

It's just very recent, 1972.
QUESTION: What's the cite?
MR. IIIGINBOTHAMs

Reece vs. Gies.

in my motion, or suggestion of mootness.

I've cited it

It's 198 SE 2d.

QUESTION: What's that, again?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
it is, sir.

198 SE 2d, I'm not sure Ttfhat page

It is in the record, I have cited it in my

motion,
QUESTION:

Has the statute since been amended?

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

No, sir.

There's been no change

5
in the statute at all.
QUESTION:

Was this to suggest, perhaps, if the

three-judge court was permitted to address the significance
of this recent decision, perhaps it would not have reached
the conclusion it reached?
HR. HIGINI30THAM:
would be the same.

No, sir.

I think the conclusion

We have a decision by the West Virginia

Supreme Court, and by the three-judge court, that the double
bond has a rational basis.
Getting back to the mootness thing, let me refer
to that again.

The effect of that case, it said that the

judgment was moot, the judgment was void.

That restored the

status quo of the parties.
In other words, that judgment of the J.P. was void,
but it wasn't the underlying claim that was void.
Therefore, the creditor could go right back in to
the same J.P. court and again sue the same debtor.

The

same situation applies here.
And for those reasons I don't think that the case
is moot,
QUESTION:

What, then, would happen?

Under Gies,

would the J.P. have to disqualify himself or something?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Well, as a practical matter now,

that's what they're supposed to do, as a practical matter
now, even though they haven't done anything.

The J.P, waives

6
the collection of fees that he would have received.
QUESTION;

Oh, then it would resolve

HR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION:

I see.

Yes, sir.

That’s the infirmity in his judgment,

that he was receiving -MR, HIGINBOTHAM;

That's the one that the Reece

court found was infirm.
QUESTION;

I see.

QUESTION s

That is to say that he was receiving

financial benefit if he decided in favor of the plaintiff?
is that it?
MR, HIGINBOTHAM;

Yes, sir? exactly.

Two dollars

and fifty cents for execution? thirty*”five cents for mailing
out —
QUESTION:

Which he didn’t get if he decided in

favor of the defendant.
MR. HIGINBOTHAM;

Yes, sir.

They said that was why it was void.
But, practically speaking, I think this is the key
to til at thing, the Reece court declared the judgment void
below.
Now, there's been no rush by creditors or J.P.'s
alike in the State of West Virginia to suddenly come around
and say:

If that statute was void, we're going to return

all the moneys that we have collected through the years.

7
Therefore, it’s not a retroactive application,
QUESTION; Well, the most that could happen here,
if I understand you correctly, is — in this case he
collected the two-fifty, I gather?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

He hasn't executed it yet, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Beg pardon?

MR, HIGINBOTHAM;
QUESTION;

He did not execute it.

No execution.

MR* HIGINBOTHAM:
post the bond and so on.
QUESTION;

We sought to appeal, sought to
We could not post the bond.

Right.

MR. HIGINBOTHAM;

And that’s v/hat gave rise to

this case.
QUESTION;

Right.

MR. HIGINBOTHAM;
enjoined him, and so on.
QUESTION;

Went into federal court and
That's —

Supposing you went to the West Virginia

State Court, if the judgment here were affirmed, and sought
to enjoin execution on the grounds — on the J.P. judgment,
on the grounds that that judgment was void.

Would you prevail

under the Reece case, do you think?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

There again, that's the question

of retroactivity, and I don't know what the three-judge
court, I raean a West Virginia court would do.

But that

8
would — they would have to decide whether Reece was retro™
active.

And if they decided Reece was retroactive, that

means that everybody, all through the years, would have to
return their moneys.

And I would hope to get attorney's

fees, if I could get something like that.
But I don't think that's very likely.
But I think the more important thing is here,
there's the fact that the creditor can go back into the
J.P. court and, considering the cases on mootness that this
Court has decided, if there's a likelihood of repetition of
the conduct complained of, then the case is not moot.

And

there's a good reason to believe that the creditor would do
that, because it's cheaper for him to go to a J.P. court,
he's gone to the same J»P. before and won, there's a good
reason to believe that he would win again.

And he doesn't

have to have an attorney.
QUESTION:

You mean that capable of repetition and.

needing review language of Moore v, Ogilby, and cases like
that, as being the general doctrine of mootness, or perhaps
an exception in election cases and things —
MR. IIIGXNBOTHAM:
election cases.

No, I don't think it's just

The general rule that I understand mootness

is that there must a controversy at all stages of the
litigation.
In the W. T. Grant case, U. S, vs. W. T. .Grant,»

9

that was a case where they had the interlocking director­
ship,

And the director says

against him, and he says;

they sought an injunction

I've dropped ray directorship, so

there1s no longer an interlocking situation.
That is only one factor to be considered, that
he said he would drop it.
QUESTION;

That’s what the courts *-“•

That turned on the availability of an

injunction, though, not on mootness, didn't it?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
mootness case.

W, T, Grant.

No, sir, I think — that was a

That was a mootness case.

QUESTION;

Oh, was it?

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Yes, sir.

And he said that the fact that it may be — it was
like the judgment here, it's void.
complained of.

He’s not doing what was

But it’s very likely to come up again.

The act could repeat itself.
Another case that I would rely upon is
QUESTION; Did the court find the statute
unconstitutional or not?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION;

Sir?

I'm sorry.

Did the Supreme Court of West Virginia

find -this statute unconstitutional —
MR, HIGINBOTHAM:

No, sir.

It didn't consider --

QUESTION; Well, is that the one point that’s
involved here?

10

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
of this statute.

They considered the second half

The second half of this statute is a double

bond also, in eviction cases plus one year’s rent.
QUESTION;

They didn’t hold the statute that we

have before us —
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION;

No, sir.

-- unconstitutional.

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

No, sir.

They didn’t have — did

not have this part of the statute before it.
QUESTION:

Well, how can that be moot now?

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

I don't think it is.

I’m not

arguing for mootness, sir.

I’m just saying that there mciy

be a question of mootness.

It’s not my function to decide

whether it’s moot or not, by avoiding the issue,
I submit to you that the case is not moot.
QUESTION:

Does the respondent believe that —

raise this?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
that it was

No, sir.

I raise it.

I think

he did not do it, and I thought it was my

function to do it; so I did raise it.
QUESTION:

Is there any problem of the statute

of limitations having run, if the creditor has to bring
another suit?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Ten years.

Ten years —

MR. KIGINBOTHAM:

in West Virginia.

So he

can go right back there and sue him again.
QUESTION:

Is this the only State law against it?

MR. KIGINBOTHAM:

No, sir.

It has not, see, he ~

what he’s doing is he's suing on the note,
QUESTION: Could the action have been instituted
in some court of record, under your practice?
MR« KIGINBOTHAM:

Yes, sir.

I think that's one of

the keys to this case.
There is a concurrent jurisdiction in the J„P„
court with a court of record, and I think that gives rise
to our equal protection argument here, which I would like to
turn to now, if the Court has no further questions on
mootness.
We have painted a picture of the J.P. system in
West Virginia, warts and all.
in it.
That

We pointed out a lot of flaws

The Reece case bears us out on one of the flaws.
a J.P, has an interest in the judgment.
We've also pointed out that a J.P. is not an expert

in law, he's not a learned judge, he's not required to be an
attorney —
QUESTION:

Mr. Higinbotham, are you relying on

that as a matter of due process in this case?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Your Honor, what I am doing is ~~

what I'm suggesting is, when you focus upon the double bond,

to whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional, to
look at the entire system.

We're saying that the double

bond is unconstitutional because we have very compelling
reasons to want to get into a court of record.
When we have raised a question of law, and I think
it's pretty well indicated in the record here, we said that
we had a substantive defense under the UCC, and the creditor's
attorney, when he answered the complaint in this action,
said, We admit it, this is not a case of obstruction, you
really do have a good question of law»
I think that's very significant.
QUESTION:

What is the West Virginia bond

requirement provision for an appeal from a court of record?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM;

Single bond*

And that raises

the first two classes.
QUESTION:

Single bond, covering what items?

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Judgment plus interest -- so far

that’s the way the statute reads.

There's no damages for

delay demanded on a single bond.
The statute which covers that is West Virginia Code
58-5-14, which would indicate that in a court of record only a
single bond would be required.

That would be on the judgment

and perhaps on the interest of six percent that can be
awarded to the appellant if he ultimately loses.
So what the court of record appellant must post, if

13
he must post a bond like a J„P. appellant must, he would
post a bond in the amount of $318

—- we’re posing $300

judgments in two different systems •— he would post a bond
of $318, whereas the J«P, appellant must post a bond of
$600.
QUESTION;

No provision for costs?

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
system.

Not in the court of record

However, there is a provision for cost in the J.P,

system? as a matter of fact, that's one of the things brought
out by Reece.

They said, it had a rational basis, because

the double bond was for the judgment plus costs plus interest,
and as appellee points out, and as provided in our State
statute, you're entitled to damages for delay.
When you add these up, mathematically, — and this
is something I think is very important — just the simple
mathematics indicates that there is not a rational basis
for a double bond.
QUESTION:

What are damages for delay, other than

interest, Mr, Higinbotham?
MR, HIGINBOTHAM;

I don't know, Your Honor,

That seems to me to be interest.
Let me point it out to you exactly.
You're entitled to, in the J.P. system, the bond
under the Reece decision would be to cover the judgment,
which would be $300, six percent interest, that adds up to

14
$318, total.

Six percent on $300 is $18 more, so you have

$318.
QUESTION:

You mean for one year's interest?

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

And you have court costs to appeal, the costs to go
from a J.P. court to a court of record is ten dollars.

Then

you’re entitled, on that, ten percent on the cost, the
judgment, the interest, the six percent, and the court costs
of ten dollars, you're entitled to ten percent damages for
delay on that.
That adds up to a maximum judgment that could ever
be rendered against an appellant from the J.P. system, if
he loses, is $360.80.
Nov/, if you're posting a bond of $600, there's
$290 left, that has not been articulated as — I don't know
what it's for.

There is no articulated State standard for

why the $293 is called for»
QUESTION:

In the court of record, did I understand

you to say that the bond would be what, only the $380?
MEU HIGINBOTHAM:

$318,

QUESTION:

That's all.

$3.18,

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

,

Yes, sir, the judgment and the

interest.
QUESTION:
for -

Now, are you challenging the J.P. bond

15
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, we say it denies —

Independently of any other ground,

on the ground that that's a denial of equal protection
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

— to require you to do that with the

J.P. judge, but not for a court of record judge?
MR, HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Which of your points, of the seven

points, presents that question?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
argument, Your Honor.

It's in our equal protection

It is Part III — are you referring

to the brief itself?
QUESTION:

I'm looking at III now.

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Yes, sir.

It’s in Part III, in

A.
QUESTION:

I'm looking for the question presented

as five.
QUESTION:

It's III-A,

QUESTION:

III-A?

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

The argument is III-A.

QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

But what's the delay betv/een judgment

in the West Virginia court of record and judgment in the
West Virginia Court of Appeals or Supreme Court?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Well, generally I would — I’m not

16

an expert in that, Your Honor,

I don't think it would be

any longer than a year.
QUESTION:

If it were two years, I take it that the

court of record would be entitled to require two years'
interest.
MR. HIGINBOTHAM;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Rather than one.

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

But generally, practically

speaking, was we’ve pointed out in our brief and as State
cases have indicated, that generally your bond from a court
of record to go to the highest court in the State, and we
only have a one-step appellate system, is only in the amount
of the judgment plus the interest.
QUESTION:

Of one. year.

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Of one year, yes, sir.

practically speaking, is what is done.

That,

There's not many

cases on it.
QUESTION:

Who fixes one year's interest?

Is

that in the statute?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

That's die judge below, whoever

is ~~
QUESTION: So it’s up to the judge.
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
what it's going to be.

It's up to the judge to decide

But, practically speaking, it’s the

judgment plus one year's interest.

17
But here we have two years.
We also suggest that the difference in treatment
in the J.P. system and in the court of record system is —
goes much further.

And we also argue that the compelling State

interest test should be applied here, not just the rational
basis test.
We have tried to paint the picture of a non-expert
deciding questions of law.
QUESTION:

Well, as I understand, this rests on

the distinction between bonds, J.P. bonds and court of
record bonds, and we don't have to reach anything else, do
we?
MR, HIGINBOTHAMs

Yes, sir.

But if you decide

the — it leaves me the same argument to the West Virginia
Supreme Court, and they decided it had a rational basis.
You could do 'the same thing.
So I would prefer to argue my entire case, to play
it safe.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. HIGINBOTHAMs

Righ t.
What we have tried to present

is that there is a difference in treatment all through the
court of record system and the J.P. system.
QUESTION:

We have —

What is the rational basis that the

Supreme Court of your State found?
MR. HIGINBOTHAMs

They didn’t, Your Honor.

They

18
said that the bond, protects the judgment costs and interest,
and that's as far as they went in the Reece case.

That’s

the, most recent definition of why you're required to double
bond.
QUESTION:

Well, I misunderstood you.

I thought

you said you'd said that you had presented this whole argument
to the Supreme Court of West Virginia, and that Court found
that this had a rational basis.
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION:

It did.

Well, what —

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

They just said it has a rational

basis, because a double bond protects the judgment costs and
interest.

Nov?, how -- where they came *— mathematically, I

don't see that it does.

But that's what they said.

So that's the close, latest definition of what the
bond's function is.

They have defined the function of that

double bond.
QUESTION: And in what case did they do that?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION:

In the Reece.

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION:

QUESTION;

That's the Reece one, yes, sir.

Were you counsel in that case?

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION:

Reece vs. Gies.

Yes, sir, I was.

unh-hunh.
Mr. Higinbotharn, in a commercial bond,

.19

what's the difference in the premium between $318 and $690?
MR* HIGINBOTHAM:

I think — twice $18.

I think that is probably very close to what
Lindsey, very close to the Lindsey analogy in ‘this case.
In Lindsey you had a double bond, also.

So if

you had to put up a surety, you would probably have not had
the greater dif fe rence.
But if you go all the way down the line —
QUESTION;

In Lindsey it involved a double bond

tiiat was automatically forfeited ~
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Yes, sir? winner take all.

We don't have a winner-take-all situation here.
But if you follow the mathematics of it all the
way down the line, you figure out the State objectives of
protecting the interest and ten percent damages for delay
and so on, what you wind up with is ultimately, maybe not a
winner-take-a11 situation, but if the appellant in the J.P.
system loses, he loses sixty dollars more than does an
appellant in the court of record system.
It's going to cost him sixty dollars more than it
will cost a court of record appellant, if he loses.

And I

don't see that that's really right.
QUESTION;

You're not talking just about bond

premiums, than, you're talking —
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

No, just premiums, sir.

20

We're talking about the State's objectives, alsor deny
equal protection of the law.

As the way they have spelled it

out as a result of the Reece case, you're paying interest
twice, you're paying twice the premium, and 'that adds up to
sixty dollars more than a court of record appellant pays.
QUESTION;

Well, but in the long run, an unsuccess­

ful appellant to the Supreme Court of West Virginia can be
held for costs that aren't covered by a bond, I would think,
if West Virginia procedure is like most States.
MR. HIGINBOTHAM;
QUESTION;

That's right,

You know, you can be assessed cost on

appeal and be liable for them, even though you may not have
put up

a bond.
MR, HIGINBOTHAM:

Yes, sir.

But we're posing here

an indigent; proposing an indigent in — that’s the frame of
reference*

We have an indigent who cannot post the bond in

tiie J.P. system.
QUESTION; Well, in that case, you can make the
same argument for a single bond.
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

No, sir? not quite.

This is

where our argument comes to -- as Lindsey recognised, there
is this gray area, in that there are going to be some people
tliat are not going to be able to post that bond.

We agree.

We do not ask this Court to overturn Union National,
Arnold vs. Union National

or

We're asking only for a single

21

bond*

What —
QUESTION;

Let's go back to these premium figures

that you so glibly throw around.

Where do you get that

sixty dollars?
MR. IIIGINBQTHAM:
QUESTION;

All sight,

Let me take it again.

After all, we don't know West Virginia

premium rates.
MR, HIGINBOTHAM:

Yes, sir.

Well, it was stipulated — it was found, as a matter,
by the court below that it would be six percent surety.
So that's what it would cost oil the bond.
Let me go through the mathematics again for you.
In the J.P. system, we have a judgment of $300.
Interest to be charged on that, that's under Code 47-6-5,
is six percent.

That adds up to eighteen.

QUESTION;

As fixed by the judge.

MR. HIGINBOTHAM;
QUESTION;

Sir?

As fixed by the judge.

MR. HIGINBOTHAM;

No, sir.

No, sir.

This is

s tatutory.
QUESTION;

One year’s interest?

MR. HIGINBOTHAM;
QUESTION;

One year’s interest*

A little while ago you said it was fixed

by the judge.
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

That's in the court of record

22

system.

I'm just talking about the J.P» system now.
QUESTIONs Well, then you can't know it's one year's

interest, when you’re talking about a simple double bond, as
Mr. Justice Blackmun was asking you about.

You're saying

it's one year's interest, but if there should be more than a
year's delay, it could be more than a year's interest.
MR. HIGINBOTHAM;

Yes, sir, that's possible.

that’s not the way the statute was set up.

But

If you look at

the second half of that statute, and I think you're going to
have to construe them together, the second half of the
statute is also an appeal statute, double bond to appeal an
eviction plus one year's rent.
That means that when this statute was enacted, this
was what x^as anticipated by the Legislature, that it would
only take one year to appeal a decision of a J.P.

It would

not take any longer than one year.
In addition to which we have a two-term rule in
the State of West Virginia.

That is, if you appeal from a

J.P. to a court of record, you have, got to bring that on for
hearing within two terms of court.

That's within one year.

Sc, when you take it in that frame of reference,
it's not going to be any longer than one year.
When you look at the statiite itself, the second
half of the statute, which refers to one year's rent in an
eviction situation, plus the two-term rule, then it's very

23

reasonable to assume that the interest will not be for more
than one year.
I'd like to return again to the compelling State
interest argument that we have.
Vie suggest that there is not equal treatment in
the two systems, in the court of record system or in the
justice of the peace system.
You have a bias which is built into the law, the
Reece case bears us out on that argument.

You do have an

admitted J.P. faced with a question of law, and he is not
an expert in it.
We have, in the same situation, a person who has
the money, can afford to go into a court of record, he can
post that bond; whereas an indigent cannot post the bond.
Wow, I realize this raises the question of wealth
classification, and this Court has not seen fit to go so far
as to say compelling State interest standard applies to
wealth classification.
But what I'm suggesting is it's just not the
wealth classification, and there is something more here than
a wealth classification.
That is the unequal treatment in the two court
systems.

When you have concurrent jurisdiction, a creditor

could have gone into either one of those courts, it's his
choice; he could go into either the court of record system,

24

where my client would have had a learned judge, who is not
biased, he had no fees that were going to be accrued to him.
Then the compelling State interest standard applies here.
And it's the burden, of course, then, of the State
to show that there is a compelling State interest for the
discrimination on the bond.
We also suggest that this is like the Boddie case,
I’m not saying that this is a Boddie case? we're not saying
that the contract creates a fundamental interest.

What we’re

saying is that equal treatment in the court is a fundamental
interest, like the fundamental interest found in Boddie.
Boddie stands alone. That's clear from Kraus and the
Ortwein decisions.

We’re not saying that the contract equals

marriage.
What we're saying is that the right to be heard and
to be treated equally within a court system, equal treatment
within ci court system is a matter of due process of law.

One of our arguments, of course, is that if you
have a lawyer who is trying to argue matters of lav/ before
a J.P., that more than likely he's not going to know what

in the whole system of justice, isn't it, to instruct the

England does pretty well, with lay

Yes, sir.

We think, as on

But when you have a situation where you have a
sophisticated question of law, then it’s very unlikely that
the J.P. is going to understand what you're talking about.

Then you wouldn’t have

We wouldn't have any complaint.

Wouldn't have any complaints about a J.P. not being learned.
Because if you have a sophisticated question of law,
then you can present it to the J0P., and a single bond would
not discriminate against anybody,
QUESTION:

Would you make the same point if the

justice of the peace had been a member of the bar for six
months, and idle judge on the trial court had been a judge
for forty years; woiild you say that the J.P. had to have
forty years’ experience in judging?

What are you — I’m trying to get what

MR, IIIGINBOTHAM:

We’re not asking, we’re not even

asking for a justice of the peace who is learned.

That is

one alternative, like the State of Pennsylvania has trained
their justices of the peace.

That’s an expensive proposition.

But if you have — if a sophisticated question of

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Well, Your Honor, if — quite

frankly, I think if the double bond is struck down, then the
only bond left is the single bond.

If he can't post that,

then it's our hope that ultimately we can persuade the
Legislature that when you have sophisticated questions of
law there should be a method of certifying questions of
law to a court of record.

That would be the simple way out.

I'm not saying in every case that you're going to
*

have sophisticated questions of law that need

a J»P, can

find facts just as well as a judge can.
QUESTION:

But one of your complaints is this

double bond, particularly when compared to an appeal from a
court of record, which is a single bond plus one year's interest
— generally set by the trial judge, you told us.

But if we

declare that a violation of the equal protection clause,
your client couldn't appeal anyway, could he?
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:
QUESTION:

Not likely.

I don't know.

You hardly even have to make that

complaint, if your client couldn’t appeal anyway,
MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

Your Honor, what we're posing

here is the difference in treatment between a court of

VJhafc we’re suggesting is that a double bond is
discriminatory.

That's as far as we’re —

Well, it doesn’t discriminate against

your client, because he can't make any bond.

Isn’t that

right?
MR* HIGINBQTHAM:

At the time this case arose, he

could not have made any bond.
QUESTION;

He filed an affidavit in forma

pauperis, I think, didn't he?
MR. HIGINBQTHAM;

Yes, sir.

We’re not asking you to throw out all bonds,
QUESTION;

Well, but that’s the only thing that

would help your client

only thing that would enable your

client to appeal, wouldn't it?
MR, HIGINBOTHAMs

Well, again, my suggestion is,

•is for the State Legislature in West Virginia to look for
the least restrictive alternative.

Otherwise, we're still

going to have a justice of the peace system with flaws in it*
We’re still going to have a judge who is looking at matters
of law, he is not an expert in them, and as long as that
continues, there’s still going to be unequal treatment in the

32

West Virginia J.P. system.

Yes, sir.

But that can be eliminated.

There is a less

restrictive alternative, and that's the method of certifica­
tion that I'm suggesting.
Your Honor, —
QUESTION:

But that, I think you told us, is for

the West Virginia Legislature.
MR, HIGINBOTHAM:

That's for the Legislature.

MR. HIGINBOTHAM:

QUESTION: Well, you could if it were found to be

unconstitutional, I suppose you could appeal it,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gaujot.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP D. GAUJOT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. GAUJOT:

Mr-. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:,
As occurred with counsel for the appellant, I must
assume that it was quite unusual for the appellee to submit
some information to this Court in opposition to his suggestion
for mootness.
At the time, it was my opinion that this case
before this honorable Court was not moot, because of Reece vs^

35

Gies.
However# upon further research# it is ray conclusion
now that this case is moot, based upon Reece vs, Gies,

and,

therefore, this Court need not concern itself with the
issues now presented before this Court.
If the Court please, I would like to —
QUESTION:

You don't have the problem of judging

mootness, have you?
MR, GAUJOT;
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I haven't.

I —

Is this your usual procedure before

you argue it?
MR, GAUJOT;

Yes, Your Honor,

My original — I was

requested to respond to the suggestion of mootness on behalf
of counsel for the appellant.

So I would assume now that

the motion is before tire Court that I could change my
position and argue that, yes, it is moot.
QUESTION:

Well/ the normal procedure is that you

file as a judge to the mootness.
MR. GAUJOT:

Yes, Your Honor, I think normal

procedure is that the appellees —*
QUESTION; When did you change your mind?
HR, GAUJOT;

No, Your Honor.

Just now?

Within the last —

quite frankly, though, within the last several weeks.
First, I would like to begin with the threshold
issue of whether this case is moot.

And I would like to

36

refer back to Reece vs, Gies, in that the case as before this
Coart now originated in 1969, and Reece vs. Gies started, I
believe, in 1972 or possibly '73, and was decided in June
1973,
In that case we had basically the same issues.

We

had a justice of the peace, who had a statutory fee due him,
which was two dollars and fifty cents on each case or each
judgment that he executed on.
The court in Reece vs. Gies ruled that because of
this two-dollar-and-fifty-cent fee it was a pecuniary interest
that the J.P. possessed, and therefore the J„P. was disqualified
from giving a judgment on idle case.
And, as a result, that judgment that he did give,
because of this pecuniary interest, was void.
Now, we contend now that Reece vs. Gies does apply
to the instant case, and therefore Warner, Justice Warner
in this case, his judgment as to Patterson is likewise void»
Now v;e get into the question of retroactivity.
Does Reece, in that Patterson started before Reece, does
Reece v. Gies apply now to Patterson vs. Warner?
QUESTION:

Well, if you're right, do we decide the

question of mootness here or would we have to vacate and
remand to the three-judge District — it was a three-judge
court, wasn't it?
MR. GAUJOT:

Yes

37
QUESTION;

to the District Court and let -them

decide whether there’s a question of mootness, because under
— this being a federal case, —
MR. GAUJOT:

I'm not sure —

QUESTION;

—where it's moot, what we do is wipe

the slate clean all the way down.
MR. GAUJOT;

That's the way it's done.

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm not — quite

frankly, I'm not sure what this Court can do as to whether
--- as to decide whether it is moot or whether to remand it
to the District Court.
QUESTION;

Well, I must say, I have difficulty,

in light of your retroactivity question that both of you
raise, knowing how we can determine here that the case is
TUG OC «

MR. GAUJOT;

Well, if you let me continue, Mr.

Justice Brennan, —
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR, GAUJOT;

Justice Cardoso, in answer to whether

State decisions are retroactive or not, said, and I state;
That a State may make a choice for itself between the
principle of forward operation and the relation backward.
And I would like to submit that the West Virginia
law is that — and I cite the case of Falconer vs. Simmons,
it's not in the brief, 51 West Virginia 172, 41 Southeastern
193.

It's a 1902 case.

Which says that

it makes every

38
decision of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals
retroactive except for one particular exception.

And of

course this case does not fall within that exception.
QUESTIONs

In the first instance, isn’t it

primarily the business of West Virginia courts to decide
the retroactivity matter, anyway?
MR* GAUJOT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And you say they have decided it back in

1902.
MR* GAUJOT:

Yes, Your Honor.

So, therefore, what I'm saying is Reece vs. Gies
does apply to Patterson, therefore the judgment of Patterson
or Earner v. „Patterson is likewise void.

And therefore this

Court should not concern itself with the question of whether,
in fact, there was a proper hearing below in the justice
of the peace court, or whether the appeal bond is constitu­
tional or not.
QUESTION;

You mean that everybody that’s had a

judgment against them in a J.P. court from IS00 to date is
entitled to get his money back?
MR, GAUJOT:

The way you interpret it?

As well as I can interpret that case,

Your Honor, yes, that's the way I interpret it,
If not that, at least this Court, we could assume
that there's limited retroactivity and that the West Virginia
court surely follows the common law or the rules as were

39

reflected and set out in United States vs., Schooner Peggy
and Linkletter vs, Walker,
We contend that this case is now moot, and this
Court should not have to consider the question of the
constitutionality of — or whether due process was afforded
Mr, Patterson in the justice of the peace court, and whether
the appeal bond is constitutional,
QUESTION:

But that so far relates to mootnesse

All you're saying is that there is a defense on the merits
to this, by reason of the Reece case.

The controversy still

goes on,
MR, GAUJOT:

I don't understand, Justice Douglas,

QUESTION: Well, I think -- if you don't understand,
then it's too late,
[Laughter, 3
QUESTION:

Well, what if it is retroactive, so.

that you can't get execution on this judgment.
controversy still exists.

The

That is, this man ~~

MR, GAUJOT: Well, that's my next argisment.

In

support of mootness, I suggest to this Court that you use
the reasoning behind the abstention doctrine.

This isn't

an abstention doctrine, as such, because we're not asking
this Court to abstain and let the State court rule, because
in fact the State court has already ruled.
And under the abstention doctrine, this Court, even

40

though it has jurisdiction of cases under the federal
Constitution and federal statute, you will not — you will
avoid making a federal constitutional decision on a federal
question, when you can leave it to the State to determine *
And in this case the State of West Virginia has
determined.

So, for the reasoning under the abstention

doctrine, even though this isn't an abstention doctrine,
in that we're not asking you to abstain until the court
has ruled — what I'm saying is that our court has already
ruled.

There’s no reason for this Court to rule,
QUESTION:

Well, I guess what you're saying is

that had Gies been decided when the three-judge court got
this case, the three-judge court would have determined then
and there that the judgment, was void, and there was no
case here.

That’s what you're saying, isn't it?

. MR, GAUJOT;
I'm saying.

Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly what

Yes, Your Honor*

QUESTION: And now you say if we give it to the threejudge court now, they will apply Gies —*
MR, GAUJOT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
— and hold the underlying judgment void,

and dismiss -the suit.
MR, GAUJOT;

That's right, Your Honor,

That's

correct.
QUESTION:

At least that's what you would propose

41
to them.
MR. GAUJOT:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would suggest also that this would be similarly
what happened in the Texas Railroad Commission vs. Pullman,
in that hare we have Patterson, Mr. Patterson, who has
enjoined the enforcement of the judgment of Justice Warner,
saying that the judgment denies him rights under the federal
law and State law, and that therefore the justice lacks
jurisdiction to make any judgment in the case.
And I would assume that this case is very similar
to that, and again reiterate that it leaves nothing for this
Court to decide as regards to

what. I'm speaking of,

only to the questions of due process, whether due process
was afforded Mr, Patterson in the justice court, or
whether the appeal bond is constitutional or not.
Now, to his argument as to whether — I think the
Court may be a little confused now as to what appellant is
trying to argue.

He. is saying this, I think, basically, to

try to simplify it some.
He's saying -that justice «— that Patterson was
denied a fair hearing in the justice court because Warner
had a pecuniary interest, and therefore he didn't have a 'fairhearing; so it's no hearing at all.
So, as a result, he has an absolute right to an
appeal

42

And we contend and say that

we contend that

there is no absolute right to appeal, and we cite Ortwein vs„
Schwab, in that, in Ortwein vs. Schwab, this Court determined
that one did not have an absolute right to appeal from an
administrative hearing to the judicial — for judicial
review»

We say, likewise, one does not have an absolute

right to appeal from a justice court to ~ for judicial
review»
And we could assume that the appeal bond that one
pays to appeal from a justice court is very comparable to
the fee of $25 that one had to pay to appeal from the
administrative hearing in Ortwein to a court there»
QUESTION:

You don’t see any difference between 25

and 300?
MR# GAUJOT:
QUESTION:

Pardon me?
You don't see any difference between $25

and 300?
MR. GAUJOT:

As far as being a fee.

What I'm saying

is that there is not an absolute right to an appeal; that’s
what I’m saying.
As in Ortwein, you don’t have an absolute right to
appeal from a J.P8 court —.
QUESTION:

I understood his complaint was that it

cost 318 or 600,
MR. GAUJOT:

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm directing ray

43

argument to this -QUESTION:
MR. GAUJOT:

Oh, I see,
— due process argument now, not to

.his equal protection argument.
Nov/, if this Court should determine that the J.P.
did in fact have a pecuniary interest and therefore he should
have disqualified himself, and in that he didn’t his
judgment is void; and should you further question whether
the appeal bond acts as a bar to access to a court of
record, then I cite the Kras case, for the proposition and
rule that one does not have an absolute rule to initial
judicial determination of one's claim.
And again I would compare the appeal bond to that
of the fifty-dcllar filing fee that one had to pay in Kras.
Another argument that appellant uses is that, well,
here v/e have Patterson, Mr. Patterson, who is forced into a
J.P. court and supposedly had a hearing, but yet it wasn't a,
fair hearing, so it's no hearing; but to appeal, you're making
the man pay a double bond.
Well, if the Court is to believe that argument,
then, as has been mentioned earlier, any amount —- a fee of
any amount would stand in the way, not only of appeal bond
but you'd have to give an absolute right for everyone to
appeal, and therefore you would be — it would necessitate
you overruling yourselves in Ortwein vs. Schwab, and United

44
States vs« Kras, and, really, what you would be doing is
extending the rule in Bodale.
QUESTION:

Do Mr. Justice Stewart's questions to

Mr, Higinbotham, Mr. Gaujot, suggest any additional ground
of mootness to you, that perhaps the remedy which he sought,
if it isn't going to avail him, his client, anything, perhaps
there isn't any real case or controversy here because of the
pauper status of the petitioner?
In other words, if it doesn't do this — if it
doesn't facilitate this man's appeal in order to get the
double bond provision stricken down and have a single bond
substituted for it, is that a real live case in controversy
between the J. P, and MrPatterson?
MR. GAUJOT:

Well, what we have here, Your Honor,

is a situation where one has to post a double bond, but that
is to protect the judgment that the plaintiff had received
in the justice court. But if the defendant appeals and wants
to stay the execution, then that's where the double bond
comes in.

It's to protect

appeal from

for instance, if one wants to

a justice court in West Virginia, you can appeal

by only posting a bond equal the amount of the judgment.
It's only the execution that one is denied.
QUESTION:

I read it differently.

You say it's just

where you want to supersede that you have the double bond,
or stay execution.

45

MR. GAUJOT:

Yes, Your Honor*

That's correct.

In other words, if a J.P» rules against the defendant in the
J.P. court, and if the defendant wants to appeal to a court
of record, all he has to post is $300 to cover the judgment.
Plus costs.
But if he wants to stay, then he has to post
double the bond, unless —
QUESTION:

What's the rule of the appeal from the

court of general jurisdiction?
MR, GAUJOT:

Well, there was also a statement made

that this Court is concurrent, and it's not
QUESTION:

From the court of general jurisdiction

to the Supreme Court of West Virginia, how much is the
bond, —
MR. GAUJOT:
QUESTION;

That's —
*—• supersedeas bond?

MR. GAUJOT; That's left to tlie discretion of the
court.
QUESTION:
MR® GAUJOT:

The trial court.
Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And how much is it usually?
MR. GAUJOT:

I think there's some court

I think

.it's generally the amount of the judgment,
QUESTION:
between the two.

So then there is still a difference

46
MRe GAUJOT; Well, there’s been some specific
question concerning concurrent jurisdiction, and it’s
actually not concurrent jurisdiction.
For instance, you cannot get in the circuit court,
the first court of record in West Virginia, if you’re seeking
anything less than fifty dollars.

You don’t have a right.

You have to go to the justice of the peace court.
Also consider this;
consider only $300.

A

Here you have — you can't

justice of the peace can award fifteen

dollars„
Now, if he awards fifteen dollars, the double
bond is even going to be — it isn't going to be sufficient.
Because, automatically, you’ve got interest, cost, and you've
got tliis ten-dollar fee that goes to the circuit court,
which has to coma out of the fifteen dollars over the original
j udgment.
QUESTION:

But here we have 300„

300, it's not 15, it’s $300 involved.

This case is

To protect $28.

Am I

right?
MR* GAUJOT;

That is, Your Honor, if the higher

court does not see that — if the higher court has

the

higher court does have the opportunity to, if damages occur,
the higher court can assess for damages.
of the additional $300.

That would come out

As well as other costs,

QUESTION: The higher court can assess damages?

47
QUESTION?
MR. GAUJOT;

Or you mean costs.
Costs.

Excuse me, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, I thought the costs were ten
dollars,
MR. GAUJOT: Well, there's a whole list of costs,
Your Honor.
For instance, there’s a five-dollar fee for
bringing the action, there’s a two-doliar fee for servor,
of course there’s a dollar fee for the bond.

You have a

dollar-and-fifty-cent fee for summoning and returning a
jury -QUESTION: Which adds up to how much?
Less than three hundred?
MR. GAUJOT:

Yes, Your Honor, it does.

QUESTION: So, you're not really arguing that the
extra, the double bond is to protect anybody other than
whom?
MR. GAUJOT:

The judgment -- the plaintiff who

received the judgment down below,
QUESTIONt

Well, the plaintiff can’t get that

three hundred.
MR. GAUJOT: That's right, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. GAUJOT:

Not when it's involved,
That's right. That's right, Your Honor,

QUESTION: So the only purpose of the three hundred

48

is to prevent people from appealing.
MR. GAUJOT:
QUESTION?

No, Your Honor, — again —
Well, what is the other reason?

MR. GAUJOT:
QUESTION:

Or discourage them.

Well, we must consider all —
The State of West Virginia isn't making

a living on this, I hope.
MR. GAUJOT:

If the *— if the defendant, who posts

the $300 bond, or the $600 bond in this instance, should he
lose on appeal, he only loses the $300 plus costs, interest,
et cetera.
QUESTION:

And the use of the $300 during the

period of time the case is pending.
MR. GAUJOT: Well, Your Honor, as I stated before,
you can't, I don't think, concern yourselves strictly with
cases that involve $300«

As I stated earlier, many times

this is a limited — a court of limited jurisdiction, and
many times people come into this court with fifty dollars,
for instance, they're asking for judgments for fifty dollars.
In ‘that case it would be double the amount.
tod it's not too hard to believe that costs will
amount to fifty dollars, is what I'm trying to say.
Consider also that the justice of the peace is a
layman and possibly the Legislature felt that they should
try, in setting the double bond, would, set up a rule of
thumb, and that the J.P., in that he is a layman, should not

49

have to exercise discretion and decide:

Well, what ~~ how

much will I assess to A for his appeal to a court of record,
and how much should I asses B,
QUESTION:

It's just a rule of thumb.

Well, he has enough apiumb to assess

that two-fifty, though, doesn't he?
MR. GAUJOT:

Yes, Your Honor.

[Laughter. ]
QUESTION:

Under the West Virginia Constitution,

could the Legislature bar any appeal in any case if it's
less than three hundred or two hundred or one hundred?
MR. GAUJOT:
QUESTION:
MR. GAUJOT:
QUESTION:
MR. GAUJOT:

Could they bar appeal?
Yes.
No, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor.

They could not?
No.

QUESTION: What's the provision of the Constitution
that requires that an appeal be allowed in every case?
MR. GAUJOT:

Oh, excuse me.

What's in the

Constitution is that one has the right to appeal, but as
set out by law. And of course, our Legislature decided that
double the — the double bond is what is needed.
Now, again, I wish to reiterate that the -- to
appeal, the defendant in the justice of the peace court doesn't
have to post a double bond.

All he has to do is post

Justice Marshall, all he has to do is post a bond that equals

50
the judgment* that just covers the judgment.
Sc what we're concerning ourselves here now —»
does he have a right, an absolute right to an execution?
And of course it's our contention that he does not.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3:00 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted,]
