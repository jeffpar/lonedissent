MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in Wo. 73-191, Village of Belle Terre against Boraas.
Mr, Gegan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD E. GEGAN, ESQ*,
ON BEIIALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, GEGAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I appear for the Village of Belle Terre, and the
named individual defendants in this action» on an appeal from
a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit*
That judgment held unconstitutional a portion of
the zoning law of the Village.

The portion-'that it held

unconstitutional provided that, No, 1, the Village has a
one-family zone.

The court did not dispute that.

But "family" is defined in terms of two *— of a
family related by blood, adoption or marriage; or an unrelated
individual living in a household but not in excess of two.
The Village of Belle Terre —
QUESTION; So a household then would consist either
of a group of people, not limited in number, related by blood,
adoption or marriage; or of two people not related by blood,
adoption or marriage?
MR, GEGAN:

According to the ordinance, Your Honor.

4
QUESTION;

So that three spinsters could not live

together*
MR. GEGAN:

According to this ordinance, that is

just so, Your Honor.
QUESTION; But two homosexuals could,
MR, GEGAN:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor,

The Village of Belle Terre is a small community of
700 people, approximately, on the north shore of Long Island
in Suffolk County.

The plaintiffs, the Dickmans, own a house

within the Village, and rented it to six students at the
State University at Stony Brook.
Hie Village threatened to enforce its ordinance with
attendant criminal penalties against these individuals, and
they commenced the action in the federal district court,
QUESTION:

And the students were all unrelated to

each other, by blood or marriage, were they not?
MR. GEGAN;

Yes, they were.

That was in their

complaint, so alleged, Your Honor,
QUESTION;

And some were males and some were

females; correct?
MR. GEGAN:
QUESTION:
MR, GEGAN:

Apparently one was a female, Your Honor.
Unh-hunh*
Yes.

Pending this appeal, I was informed that these
students had left, and so stated in my brief.

5

QUESTION:

They were all graduate students,

were they?
HR. GEGAN:
QUESTION:
HR. GEGAN:

Not all of them, Your Honor,
I see.
Some of them were.

QUESTION: And they left because they had
completed their -HR. GEGAN:

TJe have, no knowledge of why they left,

Your Honor.
I am updated by counsel for the plaintiffs, as they
state in their supplemental brief, that they have been
replaced by six more unrelated adults.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. GEGAN: So we are now back in that position.
I would like, in the beginning, to proceed from the
general —
QUESTION: Are these new tenants parties to the case
or not?
HR. GEGAN:
Honor.

They are not parties to the case, Your

It's not a class action, Your Honor?

individual action.
QUESTION: . Well, then, does it make any difference
whether the house is occupied by these people or by no one at

all?
MR. GEGAN:

I think in so far as the case could be

thought to be moot, -QUESTION:

Are the same —

MR. GEGAN:

— that the Dickmans have continued to

be plaintiffs throughout, and have never withdrawn or left.

it.

QUESTION:

I see. They are plaintiffs?

MR. GEGAN:

They are the owners of the house, —

QUESTION:

And they're the ones that want to rent

Exactly.

All right.

MR. GEGAN:

And their interests have been

continuous, and now of course they've been revived by the new
group of unrelated persons.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. GEGAN:

In discussing the constitutionality of

the law, I would like to proceed, if'I may, from the general
to the particular.
I would begin by stating what I would like to think
of as a starting point for analysis of the issues here.

That

laid down in Euclid v. Ambler, that a State may legitimately
have a one-family zone, as set — a community may legitimately
have a one-family zone as distinguished from a two-family,
detached, as distinguished from apartments, commercial, light
industrial, and so on down the line.
If that is true, and if the one-family zone which

7
the town has a right to enact, if the one-family zone is to
have any mealing, you have the problem of an unlimited number
of persons assembling under the roof in the one-family house,
I suppose, tiie Village has a couple of alternatives.
It could just forget about its one-family zone and have no
limit on the number of people, of any type, that could live
in the building,

I don't think it's required to throw out

its one-family zoning.
Or, as plaintiffs suggest in their brief, they
could have an across-the-board limit, a maximum number of
people can live in the house according to the number of bed­
rooms, or some other formula, period; across-the-board.
The consequences of this suggestion would be to
penalize larger families, families with children, for
example, in excess of the number of bedrooms in the house.
Whether it would be constitutional for a village to
do this, I don't even discuss.

Certainly a village is at

liberty not to make that policy judgment.
At this point :I think we come to the crux issues
in the case.

Are there any circumstances in which the village

can treat the family, because of what it is, because of the
value it has for our society, can it treat the family
different from the unrelated group?
And the third alternative is the one the village
adopted here.

To have a numerical limitation on the number of

3

unrelated people, but no numerical limitation on families,
counting on the normal expectancy that families tend to remain
within a certain range.

Whereas there is no such expectancy

or predictable size of group in the case of unrelated
individuals.
QUESTION: Was the whole village zoned as one-family?
HR. GEGAN:

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I thought so.

HR, GROAN:

And on that point the plaintiffs make

something of that, in that the argument is that if Belle Terre
can do it, so can everybody else; and unrelated groups might
find themselves eventually deprived of convenient and fitting
places to live.
Addressing myself just to that question. Your Honor,
I first wish to re-emphasize there are two issues:

one,! is

the Village appropriately zoned for what it is; second, what
body has the right to make the zoning decision?
This is the point that the plaintiffs challenge in
this branch of the case.
QUESTION: Does this Village have the legal right to
grant variations or exceptions from their zoning for tempo —
HR. GEGAN:

No, —

QUESTION: They have not?
HR. GEGAN:

—Hr. Chief Justice, there is no

administrative machinery; it is a fixed zone.

No variances.

9

QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.
Is the — the Village of Belle Terre

depends for its zoning authority on the grant from the town
of Brookfield [sic], doesn't it?
HR. GEGAN:

Uell, it derives it directly from State

lav/, under the New York State village lav/.
QUESTION: The tovm of Brookfield, then, has no
control over what zoning the •—
HR. GEGAN: Well, the way it works, Your Honor, is
that the town has zoning power, but if the village incorporates
within the geographic area of the tovm, it then acquires
zoning power over its area.
QUESTION: Without reference to the town?
l

HR. GEGAN:

Without reference to the town.

But to

the extent that the Village is not an incorporated village,
the town's zoning is applicable.
QUESTION:

You say it's single-family, are there

no commercial, retail store areas, that sort of thing?
HR. GEGAN:

No, not within this Village.

It's just

single-family houses, as residential.
QUESTION: What's the ponulation of Eelle Terre?
HR. GEGAN:

Seven hundred people, Your Honor, in

approximately 220 homes.
The consequences of the plaintiff's arqument on
this branch of the case apparently would be, and I can't see

10

any way around it, that they would say it's unconstitutional
to have a governmental entity endowed with zoning power,
unless that governmental body itself could accommodate the full
range of zoning uses.
This — just the argument is that since Belle Terre
consists solely of one-family residences, it shouldn't be able
to zone, unless it can accommodate other uses.

This is an

astonishing proposition that would render innumerable zoning
ordinances, all across the country, unconstitutional.

It

would negate the value, of local autonomy, which this Court
so recently emphasized in San Antonio School District case.
Why this astonishing conclusion is pressed on this
Court apparently is that the plaintiffs believe that if Belle
Terre is allowed to have its one-family zone, then other
communities will zone them out.
Mind you, the argument i3 not that this is the
present situation.

On the contrary, Judge Dooling made his

finding of fact down below that Belle Terre is a tiny unit
within a large area of permissibly zoned area.

lie made the

finding that the town of Brookhaven, within which the
university is, and within which the Village is, that the town
of Brookhaven, even its highest zoning district would
accommodate the residential use engaged in by the plaintiff
students.
So the argument is not that under the present

11
existing circumstances the students have been deprived of
a .meaningful and appropriate place to reside.

The argument is

that it might become so in the future*
The Second Circuit Court, of Appeals accepted this
argument.

I think this turns upside-down the presumption of

constitutionality.

We have a tradition that if any state of

facts might be conceived, that would make the operation of a
law reasonable, then the lav/ is valid,
The Court of Appeals reversed this, upside-down,
that if any state of facts, might be conceived in futuro, by
which the operation of this law would become unreasonable,
then the lav/ must be held valid, void presently.
How, of course, the Village of Belle Terre excludes
two-family houses; but no one is in a panic thinking that,
Heavens, if Belle Terre excludes two-family houses, there
will be no place for two-family houses.
The plaintiff group, consisting of unrelated people,
is not tlie kind of suspect minority which this Court
contemplated in the Caroline Products case, footnote 4; they
are numerous, they are articulate, they are educated, they
are mobile, in the sense that members of this group become
members of families, and bad; and forth.

Go they are the

very opposite of the kind of helpless minority in whose
behalf strict or special judicial scrutiny is involved.
The plaintiffs, at a couple of points in their brief,

12

try to impute to the Village some sort of judgment that
individuals living in groups are, per se, socially undesirable.
I suppose they are trying to come close to the
.v

'< ■

Marino case, recently decided by this Court, which said that
the State has no legitimate interest in punishing politically
unpopular groups.
Well, of course, that would be the antithesis of a
bill of attainder, and no one would assert that is a
constitutionally permissible purpose.
But this kind of division that they try to impute
to the Village, that we in the Village, the families are the
good guys, and groups are somehow the bad guys, the social
undesirables that are excluded, that are out.

This distorts

totally the kind of fine-tuned judgments that are made in
zoning.
If you have a zone for a one-family residential
community, that does not express a judgment that people living
in two-family houses are undesirables.

It excludes a

monastery of fifty monks living in it.

There's no judgment

that the fifty monks are undesirables.

It's a rather fine-tuned

judgment that certain uses are more appropriately put off into
one zone.
The plaintiffs use the epithet, "separate but equal".
Well, that epithet has an odium connected with it, because of
its legal history. But logically the concept, "separate but

13

equal” X must admist is the concept of zoning*
I think in this case that, of all of the opinions
written below, the most acute statement was that of Judge
Pooling in the District Court, in the Jurisdictional Statement,
page 00a, in which he said:
"Tiie essence of zoning is that its selection is not
regarded as invidiously discriminatory against uses not
selected.

Zoning presupposes that convenient and fitting

locations can be found for every legitimate land use, so
that no pursuit of any use is denied, or disparaged."
flow, you can call that "separate but equal" if you
will, but that's what it is*

The exclusion of one land use

from Zone X is not the kind of invidious judgment that
excluding unrelated groups from food stamp programs is.
To exclude unrelated groups from food stamp
programs does not put any greater nourishment in the stomachs
of families.
QUESTION: Well, here you don't have an exclusion
of unrelated groups, at least as I understand the ordinance.
You have a limitation on their number as to two, where you
don't have the same limitation on the number in the family.
So the town hasn't excluded unrelated groups.
HR. GDGAN:

That's true, Your Honor.

I would say in candor, however, that my basic
principle rests, to a certain degree on the concept of

14
density.

I think density certainly explains the general

concept of why a village would want to put a numerical limit
on tiie number of unrelated people, while leaving traditional
families without a numerical limit.
QUESTION: Well, just to suggest one,

six completely

independent autonomous adults are more likely to have more
automobiles and use up more parking space than one-family
unit with two children, are they not?
MR. GEGAM:

Among other, definitely one, Your Honor.

One of the rational perceived grounds upon this distinction
would be. made.
QUESTION:

Isn't this one of the bases on which the

zoning ordinances will require X number of square feet
parking space for every X number of living space in an apart­
ment building, so that the persons living nearby an apartment
are not going to have their space on the street taken up by
the overflow from the apartment building.
MR* GEGAM;

I think that is exactly so, Mr. Chief

QUESTION;

Nov/, that would be true in a lesser

J us ti ce,

degree right here, vouldn't it?
MR. GEGAM;

Yes.

I do feel —

QUESTION; But the record here doesn't show that as
the reason, does it?
MR. GEGAM;

One of the problems —*

15
QUESTION:

As I understand it, when it went back

for findings, nothing was added to the record.
HR. ORGAN:

Ue feel, Your Honor, this way.

The

United States Court of Appeals said that the Village has not
proved the existence of problems, whether it be problems of
transiency and community stability, whether it be problems of
density, or whether it be problems in idle ability of
families to compete for the rental of a house against six
wage-earners; these were the various reasons the Village
endorsed.
QUESTION:

Doesn't McGowan, or up to now hasn’t

McGowan v. Maryland said that an appellate court may., conjure
up any reason that supports the result?
MR. GEGAH:
that far.

Yes, Your Honor.

And I don't even go

But I do stand here, strongly objecting to the

notion of idle Second Circuit Court of Appeals that the Village
somehow had to prove, as if it were an adjudicated fact to be
proved by a preponderance of idle evidence, the facts underlying
— the legislative facts underlying its ordinance.
To tlie contrary, we insisted there and we insisted
— we went back to the District Court and refused to put in
any further facts,, and we insist here that so long as the
state of facts which the Village apprehends is rationally
arguable that reasonable men could perceive that if we don't
have this ordinance certain problems will develop, that that

16

is sufficient to justify the constitutionality of the
ordinance.
We don't even ask the Court to exercise sua sponte
imagination, to impute purposes to the Village.

The Village

comes before you tendering legitimate reasonable public
purposes which underlie this statute.
The fact that the number of unrelated persons can’t
exceed two might be thought harsh, if density were the only
rationale underlying this ordinance.

That is why the Village
H

has other rational bases underlying this ordinance,
QUESTION:

You mean you might have difficulty if

the requirement in addition to what you now have is that, and
every house must be on a minimum of five acres?
IIR. GEGAN:
QUESTION:
MR. GEGAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

I —-

You might be in trouble with that?
I would certainly feel uncomfortable

with it, and I don't want to carry that burden.
So, to justify
QUESTION: Do you have an acre limitation?
MR* GEGAN:

One acre, yes, it is, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

One acre.

MR. GEGAN:

To justify the number of two, as

University.

A large unit of the State

And the particular number, and I ask Your Honors

to notice it, is some 12,000-odd students.

They have more

faculty than we have residents.
So there’s a potentially tremendous supply of
unrelated individuals who would be ready to form groups,
were this ordinance not existing.

market if -MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

point at ten o'clock in the morning, counsel.
