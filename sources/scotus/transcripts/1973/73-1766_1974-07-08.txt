MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

in Mo. 73-1766, The United States of America against
Mixon? and Richard M. Mixon against the United States.
Mr. Jaworski, there has been a request
for additional time, and the Court grants that additional
time of one-half-hour, I understand.
FIR. JAWORSKI:

Is that correct?

That is correct, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: That will be allowed
to each side.

And we will not interrupt the argument,

with any recess.

We will go right through until you have

finished.
You may proceed whenever you are ready, Fir.
Jaworski.

*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEON JAWORSKI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. JAWORSKI:

please the Court:

Mr. Chief justice, and may it

On March 1 last, a United States

district Court Grand Jury, sitting here, returned an
indictment against seven defendants charging various
offenses, including among them a conspiracy to defraud
the United States, and also to obstruct justice.
John Mitchell, one of., the defendants, was a
former Attorney General of the United States, and also
chairman of the Committee to Re-Elect the President.

4
Another, II. R. Haldeman, was the President's Chief of
Staff.

Another, John Ehrlichman, was Assistant to the

President for Domestic Affairs.

The others were either

on the President's staff or held responsible positions on
the Re-Election Committee.
In the course of its deliberations, the
Grand Jury voted unanimously with 19 members concurring,
that the course of events in the formation and continuation
of a conspiracy was such that President Nixon, among a
number of ot hers, should be identified as an undicted
co-conspirator in the bill of particulars to be filed
in connection with the pre-trial proceedings.
Now, although this particular decision and
determination on the part of the Grand Jury occurred in
February, it was a well-kept secret for two-and-a-half
months.

The Grand Jury, of course, knew it? the members

of the prosecution staff knew it.
It was done so to avoid affecting the proceedings
in the House Judiciary Committee.
And it was so kept during these two-and-a-half
months until it became necessary to reveal it as a result
of the President's motion to quash the subooena, as I
will indicate subsequently in my argument.
Now, to obtain additional evidence, which the
Special Prosecutor has good reason to believe is in the

0

5
possession of and under the control of the President, and
which it is believed by the Special Prosecutor is quite
important to the development of the Government's proof
in the trial in United States vs. Mitchell et al, the
Special Prosecutor, on behalf of the United States, moved
for a subpoena duces tecum.

And it is the subpoena here

in question.
The District Court ordered the subpoena to issue,
returnable on May 2,

And the subpoena, of course, called

for the production of tape recordings in advance of
September 9, 1074, which is the trial date.

This

was

done to allow time for litigation in the event litigation
was to ensue over the production of the tanes.

And also

for transcription and authentication of any tape recordings
that were produced in response to the subpoena.
Nov;, on April 30 the President released to the
public and submitted to the House Judiciary Committee
1,216 pages to edited transcripts of 43 conversations
dealing with Watergate.

Portions of 20 of the sufonoeaned

conversations were included among the 43.

Than on May 1,

by his counsel, filed a special appearance, a formal claim
of privilege and a motion to quash the subpoena.
Now, for the United States to conduct a full
and appropriate hearing a motion to quash the subpoena,
it became necessary to reveal the Grand Jury's finding
r

regarding the President.

And thisvas first done by

the Special Prosecutor calling on the Chief of Staff,
General Alexander Haig, and the President's counsel,
.Mr. St. Clair, and advising them of what had occurred twoand-a-half months perior.

And then on the following morning

advising Judge Sirica of what had occurred, in camera, and
pointing out the necessity of this being used in connection
with the arguments on a motion to quash because of their
relevance and the necessity of these matters being made a
part of the proceedings.
Wow, the Snecial Prosecutor joined counsel for
the President in urging that the matter be heard in camera,
which was done.

Three of the defendants had joined the

Snecial Prosecutor in moving for the subpoena.

All of

the defendants, at the time of argument in camera to
Judge Sirica, onposed the motion to quash.
QUESTION:

I don't see the relevancy of the

fact that the Grand Jury indicated the President as
co-conspirator to the legal issue as to the duty to deliver
pursuant to the subpoena that you are asking for.
HR. JAWORSKI:

The only relevance, Mr. Justice,

lies in it being necessary to show, under Rule 17(c),
that there is some relevance to the material that we seek
to subpoena.
QUESTION:

17(c) presupposes the subpoena running

against the narty.

The President is not a natty.

He is

not a defendant in one of these cases.
MR. JAWORSKI:

That is correct, sir.

But it was

also felt that it would be necessary to show why , in order
to nrove this conspiracy, and in order to provide all of
the links in the conspiracy —* it was deemed necessary to
show that the President was named as an unindicted co-consniretor
and also that this —
QUESTION:

I thought that was primarily just

for the knowledge, information, of -the House Judiciary
Committee.
HR. JAWORSKI:

No, sir.

That is not correct, sir.

l't became very important, Hr. Justice, for us to hae that
as a part of the proceedings so that we could use the
Various links in the testimony so as to show that the
conversations ware such as to make one admissible as
against a co-conspirator.
QUESTION:

The Grand Jury sent it to the House

Committee, didn1fc they?
HR. JAWORSKI:

The Grand Jury sent nothing

of an accusatory nature to the House Committee, no, sir.
What the Grand Jury sent to the House Committee was the
evidence that had been accumulated, and it very carefully
excised from it anything by way of the Grand Jury's
interpretation or anything along that line, Mr. Justice.

8
How, in its Opinion and Order of May 20, the
District Court
QUESTION:

You would be here, Mr. Jaworski,

whether or not the President had been named as an indicted
co-conspirator.

That simply gives you another string

to your bow — isn't that about it?
MR. JAWORSKI:

It is true that it admits some

evidence that would otherwise not be admissible.
QUESTION:

Right.

But even had the President

not been named, you would still have subpoenaed at least
part of this material.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

There is no question about that.

And you would still be here.

MR. JAWORSKI:

That is right, sir.

But in order

to present the full picture, and in order to present -—
that also is a part of it.
The District Court denied the motion to quash
and a motion to expunge that had also been filed.
QUESTION:

No one yet has ever suggested

that during a criminal trial, a conspiracy trial, and
some evidence is offered of an out-of-court statement,
of someone who is alleged to be a co-conspirator, that
it is enough for the prosecution to then show that the
Grand Jury had named him a co-conspira tor.
MR. JAWORSKI;

No

o

QUESTION:

That will never get you over the —

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

And we don't so contend.

That, was the direction of your —-

MR. JAWORSKI:

Ho.

This was in connection with

the subpoening of this evidence, Mr. Justice.

In other words

this was in connection with showing that we have the right
to this evidence.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

But you do not suggest that that is

all you need to show, is that it?
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Of course not.

You don't suggest that the Grand Jury

finding is binding on the Court or not?
MR. JAWORSKI:
prima facie case.

I do suggest that it makes a

And I think under the authorities, it

so does.
QUESTION:

Let me understand this, Mr. Jaworski.

You don't suggest that your right to this evidence depends
upon the President having been named as an unindicted co­
conspirator .
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

And so for the purposes of our

decision, we can just lay that fact aside, could we?
MR. JAWORSKI:

What I was really doing in

V
10

pointing fco that —
QUESTION:

Well, could we?

MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes.

Primarily, it was in order

to show a reason for the Grand Jury’s action.

There

is also before this Court a motion to expunge the act
of a Grand Jury in naming the President as an unindictad
co-conspirator.

And I was trying to lay before the Court

the entire situation that warranted that action.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jaworski, as I understand your brief

you go beyond what you have addressed so far.

I think you

say that the mere fact that the President was named as an
unindicted co-conspirator forecloses his claim of privilege.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Well, we certainly —

That is one of the points in your brief.

MR. JAWORSKI:

We certainly make that as one of

the point s which I intend to discuss at a later point.
QUESTION:

That reduces him in and of itself

to the status of any other person accused of a crime?
MR. JAWORSKI:

I don’t say that it forecloses.

What I think we suggest is that it does present a «situation
here that should not make the application of executive
privilege appropriate.
QUESTION:

We do say that,

But only prima facie.

MR. JAWORSKI:

Prima facie — that is correct.

But when you get to the matter, Mr. Justice Powell,

11
of balancing interests, we do feel that that particular
situation is a factor that is important.

And this is why

we lay stress on it.
The Court’s order, of course, was to deliver the
originals of all subpoeaned items, as well as an index
and an analysis of those items, together with tape copies
of those Portions of the subpoeaned recordings for which
transcripts had been released to the public by the President
on April 30.
Now, this case presents for review the action
of the lower court.
Now, may I, before I get to the jurisdictional
?;>oints, briefly state what we consider to be a bird's eve
view of this case.
Now enmeshed in almost 500 pages of briefs,
then boiled down, this case really presents one fundamental
issue.
says?

Who is to be the arbiter of what the Constitution
Basically this is not a novel question —

although the factual situation involved is, of course,
unprecedented.
There are corollary questions, to be sure.
But in the end, after the rounds have been made, we return
to face these

glaring facts that I want to briefly review

for a final answer.
In refusing to produce the evidence sought by

I

12
»

a subpoena duces tecum in the criminal trial of the seven
defendants — among them former chief aides and devotees,
the President invokes the provisions of the Constitution.
His counsel’s brief is replete with references to the
Constitution as justifying his position.

And in his public

statements,, as we all know, the President has embraced
the Constitution as offering him support for his refusal
to supply the subpoeaned tapes.
Now, the President may be right in how he reads
the Constitution.

But he may also be wrong.

wrong, who is there to tell him so?

And if he is

And if there is no one,

then the President, of course, is free to pursue his course
of erroneous interpretations.

What then becomes of our

constitutional form of government?
So when counsel for the President in his brief
states that this case goes to the heart of our basic
constitutional system, we agree.

Because in our view, this

nation’s constitutional form of government is in serious
jeopardy if the President, any President, is to say that
the Constitution means what he says it does, and that
there is no one, not even the Supreme Court, to tell him
otherwise,

Mr. Jaworski, the President went

He went to the District Court with his motion
.And then he filed a cross-petition here.

*

He is asking the Court to say that his position is correct
as a matter of law, is he not?
MR. JAWORSKI:

He is saying his position is

correct because he interprets the Constitution that way.
QUESTION:

Right.

He is submitting his position

to the Coxirt and asking us to agree with it.

first to the District Court, and he has petitioned in
this Court.

He has himself invoked the judicial process,

ibid he has submitted to it.
MR. JAWORSKI:

Well, that is not entirely correct,

Didn't he file a motion to quash the

subpoena a 9,: in the District Court of the United States?

Sir,, he has also taken une position

that we have no standing in this Court to have this issue
heard.
QUESTION:

As a matter of law — he is making

that argument to a courts that as a matter of constitutional
law he is correct.
MR. JAWORSKI:

So that of course this Court

could then not pass upon the constitutional question of
how he interprets the Constitution, if his position were
correct.

But I -~
QUESTION:

As a matter of law — his position

is that he is the sole judge.

And he is asking this

14
Court to agree with that proposition # as a matter of
constitutional law.
MR. JAWORSKI:

What I am saying is that if he

is the sole judge, and if he is to be considered the sole
judge, and he is in error in his interpretation, then he
goes on being in error in his interpretation.
QUESTION:

Then this Court will tell him so.

That is what this case is about, isn't it?
MR. JAWORSKI:

Well, that is what I think the

case is about, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

He is submitting himself to the judicial

process in the same sense that you are, is that not so,
Mr. Jaworski? /
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Well, I can’t —

You take one position and he

takes anot her.
MR. JAWORSKI:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in my

view, frankly, it is a position where he says the
Constitution says this, ’’and nobody is going to tell
me what the Constitution, says."

Because up to this point

he says that he and he alone is the proper one to interpret
the Constitution.

Now,'there is no way to escape that.

Because the 'briefs definitely point that, out, time after
time.
QUESTION:

I think this matter may be one of

.15

semantics.

Each of you is taking a different position on

the basic question, and each of you is submitting for a
decision to this Court.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

That may be, sir.

Well, we start with a Constitution

til at does not contain the words "executive privilege" is
that right?
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

That is right, sir.

So why don't we go on from there?

MR. JAWORSKI: All right, sir.
good beginning point.

That is a very

But-of course there are other

things that need to be discussed inasmuch as they have
been raised.
QUESTION:

Perhaps we can further narrow the area

if, as I take it from your briefs, you do emphasize there
is no claim here of typical milit ary secrets, or diplomatic
secrets, or what in the Burr case were referred to as state
secrets.

None of those tilings are in this case, is that

right?
MR. JAWORSKI;

That is correct, sir.

And we do

point to the authorities to show that there is a difference
in the situation here.

I do think that it is proper, as

much as I regret to have to do it, to point out that the
President's interpretation of what his action should be
in this particular set of circumstances is one that really

T
16

/

requiras judicial intervention perhaps moreso than a normal
one would.

I think that we realize that there is at stake

the matter of the supplying of evidence that relates to two
former close aides and devotees.

I think we are aware of

the fact that the President has publicly stated that
he believed that these two aides of his, Mr. Haldeman and
Mr. Ehrlichman, would come out all right in the end.
Added to that the fact that the President has a sensitivity
of his own involvement, is also a matter that calls for the
exercise of the question to which Mr. Justice Douglas
alluded as one that is somewhat unusual.
Turning now to jurisdiction — before the Court
are the two questions of statutory jurisdiction the Court
directed the parties to brief and argue.
QUESTION:
me over one hurdle.

Mr. Jaworski, at this point, help
Do you feel that the mandamus

case as such is here ?
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTIO?^:

Yes, we do, sir.

I search your petition for certiorari

in vain to find even a mention of it.
if it is a political question.

And I wondered

What is your position

that the issues in any event are here?
MR. JAWORSKIYes, sir.
QUESTION:

Whether the case is heard or

MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes, sir, we say it is here.

17

not only because of the appeal itself, but also because
of petition for mandamus.
Now, we did, Mr. Justice, discuss that in one
of the briefs.

Nov;, it may be that it wasn’t originally

when vte filed the original brief on jurisdiction. But we
certainly -—
QUESTION:

You mentioned it in your second brief

on the merits —
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But not at all in your petition for

certiorari.
MR. JAWORSKI:

Well, we did in the — it was in a

footnote, on page 2 of the petition for writ of certiorari,
Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

It usually takes more than a footnote

to get a case —
MR. JAWORSKI:

Well, I would think so.

But

there really is no issue here between the parties here
on the issue of jurisdiction.
as befcreen the parties on it.

I mean there is no argument
And while of the parties

cannot agree on it, I must say that on three different
bases the jurisdiction does exist as we see it.

Now,

I am not yet getting to the question of the intra-executive
matter that has been raised.

But I am discussing now the

statutory basis of jurisdiction.

18
QUESTION:

Your footnote merely refers to

the presence of" a mandamus case.

It doesn’t purport to

bring it up here.
But go ahead,
MR. JAWORSKI:

But to answer your question directly,

sir, this is correct; we are standing upon not only the
matter that this is an appeal that properly had been in
the Court of Appeals, and for that reason has been moved
up

here properly under 1254„1.

We also say that the Court

has jurisdiction over the petition and cross-petition
under 1254.1 because they present for review all questions
raised by the petition - by the President’s petition
for writ of mandamus.

And. then we also say that in addition

to that the All Writs Act gives this Court the jurisdiction
to proceed,
QUESTION:

Of course, in a mandamus action

Judge Sirica would be the party respondent.
a party in this case.

And he is not

And he is not represented by counsel

here, is he?
MR. JAWORSKI:

As far as I know, he is not, no

sir.
QUESTION:

The mandamus would be Nixon vs. Sirica,

would it not?
MR. JAWORSKI:

But it was brought up by the

President in their petition for mandamus, that is right.

\

19
That is the way it got into this Court.

It raises the

same questions actually that were raised on the matter
that we brought up on appeal.
QUESTION;

What was the chronology, Mr. Jaworski?

Notice of appeal from Judge Sirica's order was the first
step taken to get to the Court of Appeals, was it/
MR. JAWORSKI;
QUESTION;

That is, I believe, right, sir.

And while that was pending, then I

gather the President’s petition for mandamus was filed.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

And then the last step was that you

filed the Petition to bypass here.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Right.

And that petition to bypass applied

I gather to whatever case was pending in the Court of
Appeals?
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION;

That is correct, sir.

And at that time the case pending

was both the appeal from Judge Sirica's order and
the President's —
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

if you so chose

Correct, sir.

You feel they are not two cases.?

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Mandamus.

No, sir, they raise the same question.

Yet you could bring each ur> separately

2.0

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, could have.

It. seems to me they are two cases.

MR. JAWORSKI:

Inasmuch as they present the same

questions — it occurred to us that it was appropriate to
rely upon jurisdiction as to both of them.
QUESTION:

Again, with respect to the mandamus

action, one of the parties isn't here in Court represented
by counsel.

He is the party respondent.

MR. JAWORSKI:

Well, I don’t have the record

before me, but I must say — and I will not make an outright
representation that Judge Sirica is — and that is why I
'hesitated a few minutes ago — was made a party.
all, it was brought up by the President.

After

Rut I am advised

by a note just passed me that Judge Sirica is a Party to
t mt proceeding.
QUESTION:

Who represents him here?

MR. JAWORSKI:

I don't know of anyone representing

him here.
QUESTION:

Has he filed any brief or made any

appearance at all in any sense?
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

So far as I know, no.

In any event, Judge Sirica's order

was an appealable order.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that is correct.

If you are correct in that submission -

21
do we ever have to reach any issues raised by the mandamus?
MR. JAWORSKI:

No, you would not.

We were pointing

out that the jurisdiction rests on a three-pronged basis.
QUESTION:

But the mandamus is not your act.

MR. JAWORSKI;
QUESTION:

It is not, no, sir.

You are not obliged to defend it.

MR. JAWORSKI:

That is correct, sir.

We, however,

were pointing out that the same issues really were raised
by if the petition is properly before the Court.
Now, if there are no further questions on the matter
of statutory jurisdiction, I would like to pass to the
intra-executive dispute.
First, we recognize, of course, that jurisdiction
cannot be waived, and nothing that is presented here is
with the idea of suggesting even remot ely that there is any
waiver with respect to the question of jurisdiction.

But

we do say that the contention that there is an intra-executive
dispxite and for that reason this Court cannot pass upon
these questions is not sound.
Before discussing the cases, however, I think
it would be appropriate for us to undertake to place this
in the right perspective.
Let me say first that we stand upon two bases:
first, that actually the orders that were entered creating
the Office of the Special Prosecutor and delineating his

22
authority; even the original order at the time that my
predecessor was acting as Snecial Prosecutor, had the force
and effect of law»

We also point to the fact that the

arrangement made itself with the Acting Attorney General
that I made, if I may point to it — and one reason I have
no reticence in discussing the facts is because the facts
are undi3nuted.

There has been no dispute raised as to

just what actually transpired»
The situation is one of the arrangement itself,
which the Acting Attorney General points to, with respect
to the matter of independence having been discussed by
him with the President —■ thus meaning that the President
himself had approved the setting

up

of this particular

office, and the rights and the responsibilit ies that it
has under the charter.»
We set this out in the appendix, of course,
pointing precisely to what the authority and the
responsibilit ies and the obligations of the Special
Prosecutors are.

One of the express duties that is

delegated to the Special Prosecutor is that he shall
have full authority for investigating and nroeecuting —
among others

^alle,gar ions involving the President.

And

the delegation of authority expressly stated in particular
the Special Prosecutor shall have full authority to determine
whether or not to contest the assertion of executive

23
privilege, or any other testimony of privilege.
Now, in the instance of my appointment, unlike
tiie appointment that had been made prior thereto, there
was an amended order, and it referred to assurances given
by the President to the Attorney General that the President
will not exercise his constitutional powers to effect the
discharge of the Special Prosecutor, or to limit the
independence that he is hereby given.

And that he will not

be removed from his duties except for extraordinary improprieties
on his part, and without the President first consulting
the majority and minority leaders and the chairman and
ranking minority members of the Judiciary Committees
of the Senate and House of Representatives, in ascertaining
that their consensus is in accord with the proposed action.
And then, that the jurisdiction of the Special Prosecutor
will not be limited without the President first consulting
with' such members of Congress and ascertaining that their
consensus is in accord with his proposed action.
Now, at the time —
QUESTION:

What does "consensus" mean — unanimous?

MR. JAWORSKI:

No, sir.

It has been interpreted

by the Actii ng Attorney General in conversations as meaning
six of eight.
QUESTION:

I take it when you make reference to this,

you are in effect suggesting that your position is certainly

24
different than if a United States Attorney were prosecuting
this case.
MR. JAWORSKI:

That is correct, sir.

I think

we have what might he termed a quasi-independent status,
where there were delegated to this particular office
performance of certain functions.

And there is no reason

why the President could not have delegated those to us.
As a matter of fact —QUESTION:

Mr. Jaworski -— quasi-independent in

the sense of an agency?
MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes, sir.

For instance, the

Comptroller of the Currency — he has a status somaidiat
similar to that.

And we know that there are suits

brought between the Department of Justice and the Comptroller.
QUESTION:

I have trouble with your position

being similar to a U.S. Attorney, because a U.S. Attorney
is absolutely under the thumb of the Attorney General.
MR. JAWORSKI:

Well, I didn't say —* what I meant

was that we had independent status that was really
different from the status of the United States Attorney.
QUESTION:

I'm sorry,

MR. JAWORSKI:

I thought that was the way I

answered the question.
Now, I should say that it is interesting
when the case of Nixon vs. Sirica was before the Court of

25
Appeals, Professor Charles Allan Wright, who was then
arguing that case, and who was not on the original brief,
but I observe was on the reply brief filed on behalf of
the President —- at that time argued with respect to the
particular Office of the Special Prosecutor; "Now, in
this instance we have a division of function within the
Executive in that my friend Mr. Cox" — referring to
Archibald Cox -- "has been given absolute independence.
It is for him to decide whom he will seek to indict.

It

is for him to decide to whom he will give immunity..."
a decision that would ordinarily be made at the level of the
Attorney General or in an important enough case at the level
of the President.
But the President's present counsel in his motion
to quash, as he does here — except the words here are
different, but the effect is the same — is contending
to the Court that the President has the right to determine
who, when and with what information individuals shall be
prosecuted„
QUESTION:

Well, Nixon against Sirica was

different in that the parties there were the Grand Jury
on the one hand, represented, to be sure, by the Special
Prosecutor — the Grand Jury, which is an adjunct
of the judicial branch of government, on the one hand —•
and the Chief Executive, on the other.

And here, now

26

that an indictment has been returned, the two parties
are both members of the executive branch.

Isn’t that

correct — that there is that difference?
MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes, sir, that is correct.

But I

don't think it is a distinction as to the substance.
QUESTION;

You are a member — you are the

United States — the people of the United States, who
you represent.

You are not a member of the judicial branch,

unlike the Grand Jury in Nixon against Sirica --- you are a
memb er of the executive branch of government, are you not?
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

There is that difference.

MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

That is correct, sir, yes.

There is that difference, yes.

And it might be a crucial difference,

might it not?
MR. JAWORSKI:

But I don't think the description

to which I pointed as to the independent status of the
independent executor would be any different in the
Sirica case than it would be in this case.

And I was

merely —
QUESTION:

No

you are if anything more

independent than Mr. Cox was under the regulations.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

That is correct, sir.

But that doesn’t really go to the

question that I am raising.

.

27
MR. JAWORSKI:

Yes, sir.

I realise that.

How, may I, however, indicate very briefly —
and I knoxvT this is an important question — but I dc feel
that the facts ought to be before the Court in detail —
indicate just what did transpire with respect to how these
particular regulations, this order, was interpreted by
the President’s Acting Attorney General, and also by the
Attorney General Designate, and also by the President
himself, and by the President’s Chief of Staff General
Haig.
Mr. Bork, in hearings at a time when Congress
was pressing the bill of an independent Special Prosecutor,
testified that ’’Although it is anticipated that Mr. Jaworski
will receive cooperation from the White House in getting
any evidence he feels he needs to conduct investigations
and prosecutions, it is clear and understood on all sides
that he has the power to use judicial processes to
pursue evidence if disagreements should develop."
It was further pointed out —
QUESTION;

You are quoting from whom at what time?

MR. JAWORSKI;

Acting Attorney General Bark's

testimony in the House.
QUESTION;

On xdiat occasion?

MR. JAWORSKI;

After T had been appoirced, and

in connection with the hearings on the bill to establish

28

an independent prosecutor by congressional act.
QUE STION:

Thank you.

MR. JAW0RSK1:

Then he further said: "I understand

and it is clear to me that Mr. Jaworski can go to court and
test out...” and these are the important words — ''and
test out any refusal to produce documents on the grounds
of confidentiality."

And Attorney General Saxhe, then a

designate, who was also present at the time that this matter
was discussed, and at the time that I. accepted the
responsibilities, testified that I had the right to contest
an assertion of executive privilege and stated that I can
go to court at any time to determine that.
Now, the President himself, as we point out in
our brief, in announcing the appointment of a new independent
prosecutor, stated to the nation that he had no greater
interest than to see that the new Special Prosecutor had
the cooperation from the executive branch and the independence
that he needs to bring about that conclusion of the
Watergate investigation,
The President's Chief of Staff at the time
that this appointment was accepted, and at the time that
the new regulations were then drafted by the Acting
Attorney General, had assured me — and this is a part
of the record, because a letter was written at the request
of Senator Hugh Scott to the White House as a result of

discussions that he had with General Haig , in which I
sent a copy of the testimony that I had given to the
congressional committees to the White House so it would be
fully aware of it and the receipt of it was acknowledged
without any change in the testimony.
So X had been assured to the rigit to judicial
process by him after he had reviewed the matter with the
President and came and told me that I would have the right
to take the President to court t and that these were the key
words in this arrangement, and that the right would not be
questioned.
of course, this independence that was given to
the Special Prosecutor actually was but an echo of public
demand.

And if I may be permitted to say so, it was the

only basis on which, after what had occurred, and a
predecessor had been discharged — it was the only basis
on which the Special Prosecutor could have felt that he could
have come in and serve and undertake to perform these
functions.
It is important. I think, to observe that counsel
for the President, in his brief, by accepting the proposition
that the President and the Attorney General can delegate
certain executive functions to subordinate officers
implicitly has conceded we think the validity of the
regulations delegating prosecutorial powers to the

30
Special Prosecutor.
The regulations specifically provide, as you
will notice from the appendix

and we have set them out —

the Attorney General will not countermand or interfere
with the Special Prosecutor's decisions or actions.

This

is also a part of the charge.
Thus, to argue, as has been done in these briefs,
that the separation of powers preclude the courts from
entertaining this action because it is the exclusive
prerogative of the executive branch, not the judiciary
to determine whom to prosecute, on what charges, and with
what evidence, we think misses the point.
What has evolved from the regulations in our view
is a prosecutorial force with certain exclusive responsibili­
ties .

And this is why I say that to some degree it could

be described as a quasi-independent agency.
It is not unlike, our situation is, the case
we alluded to a few minutes ago decided by the Court
just a week or so ago.

It is not unlike the case of the

Secretary of Agriculture vs. the United States.

This

isn't the first time that there has been an action brought
by one member of the executive branch against another
official in the executive branch.

And we refer to these

cases in our briefs in detail.
Nov/, I want to make it clear that the President

at no point of course delegated to the Special Prosecutor
the exclusive right to pass on the question of executiveprivilege or any other privilege — attorney/client
privilege, or any other testimonial privilege.

What we are

merely saying is that we have the clear right to test it in
this court.

And this is on what we stand.

Well, because of the passage of time, if I may,
I think I should get to other discussions — unless there
are questions on this particular point.
Passing to the merits, we would say if there is
any one principle of law that Marbury vs. Madison decides
is that it is up to the court to say what the lav; is,

And

almost to the point of redundancy, but necessary because
it was a landmark decision, Chief Justice Marshall reasoned
we think with clarity and emphasis that it is emphatically
the province and the duty of the judicial department to
say what the law is.

And this Court, of course, through

the years has reaffirmed,consistently applied that rule.

It

has done it in a number of cases — in Powell v. McCormack,
in the Youngstown Steel seizure case, in Doe v. McMillan,
and a footnote, I think a very important one, appears
in that opinion, when Mr. Justice White pointed out that
"While an inquiry such as involved in the present case,
because, it involves two coordinate branches of government,
must necessarily have separation of power implications,

32
the separation of powers doctrine has not prevented this
Court from reviewing acts of Congress, even when, it is
pointed out, the executive branch is also involved."
Now, there are a number of cases that speak to
that.

I think one of the cases that perhaps went into

greater detail, and also points out quite a distinguishing
feature, is the Gravel case; whereas in the Gravel case
the Court did hold that it was appropriate to go into
certain matters where privilege had been exercised on
the part of a Senator on behalf of his aide.
There are two things that I believe clearly
help us in that decision, and also other decisions as far
as the questions here involved.

One is that the

speech or debate clause is in the Constitution? it is
written in there.

And this is what was invoked.

I don't

find anything written in the Constitution, and nothing
has been pointed, that is a writing in the Constitution
that relates to the right of the exercise of executive
privilege on the part of the President.
Another very important thing -that is pointed
out in that case is that it did involve an examination
into wrong-doing on the part of those who were seeking
to invoke the privilege.
QUESTION:

How ancient, Mr. Justice Brennan, I am not in a

position to say.

But certainly it has been one that has been

used over the years.

But it is not one that I find any

basis for in the Constitution.
QUESTION:

Are you now arguing that there is no

such thing as executive privilege ?
MR. JAWORSKI:

No, 3ir.

I didn’t think so.

This Court has examined a number of

And in some situations, as I think was pointed

out earlier, where military secrets and such as that were
involved, or national secrets of great importance, the
Court has taken a good, close look, and has upheld privilege.
But
QUESTION;

When you say it has taken a good, close

without looking at the evidence sometimes; taken

a good close look at the claim and the basis of the claim,
is that what you mean?
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION;

That, is what I mean, yes, sir.

Didn't this Court say that it did

have constitutional overtones?
MR. JAWORSKI;

It said it had constitutional

overtones.

And I don't know in what case it may have

been used.

But —
QUESTION;

That was in the Court of Claims,

I think.
MR. JAWORSKI;

Yes, sir.

But it certainly

has never placed it in the Constitution so far as I am
aware of, and President's counsel who have carefully
examined the authorities.
QUESTION;

Right.

QUESTION;

That was in Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical

Corporation caso in the Court of Claims that phrase was
used.
QUESTION: That is judicially tailored?
MR. JAWORSKI: Yes, sir.
QUESTION: Is it your view that there are no
influences to be derived from the doctrine of separation
of nowers?

Are you saying this is purely an evidentiary

privilege?
MR. JAWORSKI: That the privilege as recognized
judicially may have been tied into a separation of powers
doctrine we don't deny.

What we say is that the separation

of pow rs doctrine in the exercise of and calling for
executive privilege has not been applied in a number of
instances involving both Congress and involving also the
Executive — despite the fact that even in the congressional
situations the speech and debate clause is there.
What I am saying is that the separation of povje-i. „
doctrine, as was pointed to in the Doe v. McMillan case
has not been permitted to stand in the way of this Court
examining It from a standDoint of whether fcne executive
privilege should be permitted or not.
QUESTION: In Reynolds the Court ended up treating
the assertion of privilege there as an evidentiary privilege
but it did allude to the fact that there was a constitutional
question, and it said the Court wasn’t reaching it, as I

36

MR. JAWORSKI:

On the issue of executive

M.

privilege, I should point out here, it is a very narrow one.
And I think it is important thac we bear this in mind.
It doesn't involve a very large or broad privilege rights.
What it really narrows down to is somewhat simple but very
important issue in the administration of criminal justice,
and that is whether the President, in a pending prosecution,
can withhold material evidence from the court, merely on
his assertion that the evidence involves confidential
communications.

And this is what it isally gets down to.

We know that there are sovereign prerogatives to
protect the confidentiality necessary to carry out
responsibilities in the fields of international relations
and national defense that are not here involved.

And there

is no claim of any state secrets or that disclosure will have
dire effect on the nation or its people.
Actually, I think when we get to weighing the
non-disclosure as against disclosure, and I think when
we begin to weigh the balance of interests, it would seem
to me that the balance clearly lies in favor of a disclosure
in a situation such as the circumstances here.
Of course —
QUESTION:

That certainly would not be true

if a case of the fifth amendment were involved.
that is not present here

But

37
HR. JAWORSKI?

Not present, Mr. Justice Douglas.,

And there is no question but what the fifth amendment is
very plainly written out in the Constitution and is
invoked as a clear constitutional privilege,
I think that it would be of help if I may point
out to the Court that there is an excellent article that
we have alluded to in our briefs by Professor Berger that
appears in the Yale Law Journal, which discusses the
Aaron Burr case at length, and also other cases that have
been pointed to since the time of that case.

And if I may

just say, very briefly, that summarizes the situation by
saying that the heart of Marshall’s opinion was justly summarized
by the Court of Appeals in the Nixon, v. Sirica case, in
a tapes case, that we have talked about.

"The Court was to

show respect for the President's reason, but the ultimate
decision remained with the Court."

And we are not suggesting

for a moment here that the matter of executive privilege
should not be looked into.
It should be tested.

It deserves to be tested.

And we urge that it be tested.

But

the ultimate decision is not one of saying that it is
absolute, it rests in the Constitution, that it doesn’t
entitle anyone, it doesn’t authorize anyone, it doesn’t
even authorise this Court to look into it -- because if
the courts are the ultimate interpreters of the Constitution
and can restrain Congress to operate within constitutional

bounds,, they certainly shouldn’t be empowered any less
co measure Presidential claims of constitutional powers.
I wanted briefly to make mention of the question
that had been raised by counsel for the President that
involves a motion to expunge the finding of the Grand
Jury's action that the President is to be named as an
unindicted co-conspirator along with a number of ot hers when
the pre-trial proceedings are gone into and a bill of
particulars is being filed,
And 1 say that the Grand Jury’s finding, painful
as it is, I,think on the part of the Court, must be
considered as being valid and sufficient to show prima
facie — it is sufficient to show prima facie that the
President was involved in the proceedings in the course
and in the continuation of the particular conspiracy
that was charged,
QUESTION;

Well, is that the issue, Mr. Jaworski,

or is the issue whether there can be a collateral attack?
MR. JAWORSKI:

That is also another issue.

But I merely wanted to point out that I
believe that this Court would not go into the Grand Jury’s
findings.

But it’s a. prima facie matter.

And that, this Court

would not go into it for the purpose of determining a matter
of that kind.
QUESTION:

I thought we had put that issue aside

39

I just don't understand what the relevance of that is to
/ this case.
MR. JAWORSKI:

Well, I have to agree with you —

neither do I see what the relevance is of the matter of
saying — there is another argument advanced here, and that
is that the President can’t be indicted.

And I don’t know

what the relevance of it is in this case, either, very
frankly, because it is not before the Court.

And yet the

argument is made, and many pages of briefs are devoted
to it.
QUESTION:

I am just wondering, Mr. Jaworski,

why you aren't content it is irrelevant without taking
on the right —MR. JAWORSKI:

This is why I skipped the argument

with respect to the matter of whether he could be indicted
or not — inasmuch as this question had been raised and
briefed and a motion exists before the Court -- I have to
agree it is not relevant.

But it is a part of the case,

and that is the only reason I alluded to it.

And I have

no interest in spending much time on it.
QUESTION:

Except part of the grounds on which

you rest in subpceaning this material is the fact that
the President has himself been named as a co-conspirator,
an unindicted one.

That’s true, isn’t it?

That £s

part of the grounds on which you rest in subpoeaning this

40
matsrial.

And the response to that is that the President

cannot constitutionally be named as an unindicted coconspirator.

So to that extent it is in this case —• the

question is in this case.
MR. JAT'TORGKIr

I don’t think it is a matter that,

very frankly, has any particular basis to it, because I
don’t see how this Court could be asked to substitute its
judgment for that of a Grand Jury.
t

QUESTION:

Well, that is something quite different

again — w tether or not 'there was sufficient evidence before
the Grant Jury to justify the Grand Jury in naming the
President.

That is quite different, and, as the Chief

Justice suggested, a collateral issue.
MR. J&WORSKX:
QUESTION:

That is right.

But the issue of whether or not the

President can constitutionally be named by a Grand Jury
as a co-conspirator, even though an uninficted one,
is at least tangentially before us.

Because it. is the

fact the t. he has been named by the G-and Jury that is part
of the grounds and part of the foundation upon which you
have based your subpoena duces tecum.
MR. JAWORSKI:

Not only that.

I think it has

been pinpointed in our view in materiality because it
does relate to the question of the proof that we are
seeking, the relevance of the proof that we are seeking.

41
And this gets into., of course, a discussion of matters
that are sealed and which I cannot discuss with the Court,
QUESTION:

I understand — right,

QUESTION;

Whether or not they had the authority,

they did it.

It is a fact that the Grand Jury did it.

MR. JAWORSKI;
QUESTION;

That is correct, sir.

And so I don't see how we have anything

to do with whether they had the authority or not.
fact.

It is a

Is that right?
MR. JAWORSKI;

That is, I think, correct.

NOW —

QUESTION;

I thought the heart of this case was

the rights of defendants in a criminal trial to that evidence.
It may be exculpatory and free them of all liability.
I don't know, but I —
MR. JAWORSKI:

Well, it certainly is in the case.

Now, of course what you have reference to also, I am sure,
Mr. Justice Douglas, is

Bray and the Jencks — Maryland

v. Bray, and the Jencks.

And this is part of the case.

However, it happens not to be a part of the appeal, although
it is a part of the case.

But as far as our position is

concerned, it doesn't relate to that.

But certainly it is

true that this material, as we have pdnted out in our
communications to the President, may well involve exculpatory
matters.

And we time and again pointed out we wanted them

42
not simply because we felt that there were matters that
needed to be developed in connection with the prosecution,
but that they could well contain exculpatory matter.
QUESTION:

The Brady question really lurks just

in the background, does it not?

That is, if you get

information, whatever you get will be available to —
you would concede is available to any defendant who can
make a showing.
MR, JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

Correct, sir.

And the question of whether or not the

defendants, under the Brady doctrine, are entitled to
subpoena information and material that is not now in your
possession but is in the possession of the President, was
an issue that was left undecided by the District Court.
MR. JAWORSKI:
QUESTION:

That is correct, sir.

Am I right about that?

MR. JAWORSKI:

Before this Court,

I believe with the permission of the Court,
unless there are further questions, I will reserve
the rest of the time to close.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. St. Clair.

43
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. ST. CLAIR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Mr. Chief Justice and Members

of the Court, my learned brother has approached this case,
I think, from the traditional point of view — namely,
tills is an attempt by a Special Prosecutor to obtain
what he thinks is desirable evidence in a crininal prosecution
that he has the responsibility for.

Not once, however,

have I heard him mention what I think is really involved,
at least in significant part, and that is the co-pendency
of impeachment proceedings before the House of Representatives,
and the realistic fusion that has taken place with respect
to these two proceedings, and the promise of continued
fusion, as I understand my brother's position.
May I quote from page —
QUESTION:

Well, those are none of our problems,

are they?
MR. ST. CLAIR:
First, by way of

I think, sir, they really are.

factual —•

QUESTION:

The sole authority to impeach is

in the House.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

The sole authority to try is in

the Senate.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Right.

And the Court shall not be

used to .implement or aid that process, which is what is
what is happening in this case,

This case wouldn’t be hare

QUESTION: Just how is this done?
case

How does this

implement that?
MR, ST. CLAIR:

I would like to review some of the

facts for you in this regard,
QUESTION:

Which are in the record?

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Yes.

My brother has mentioned

them to you-.
QUESTION:

Rut are they in the record?

MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Well, if we are just an adjunct of

the House Judiciary Committee, this case should be dismissed
as improvidently granted, shouldn’t it?
MR. ST, CLAIR:

Exactly right, sir.

Not only

that, it makes the case unjusticiable, at least.
QUESTION:
stands.

Then the District Court's decision

Is that what you want?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

No.

The case should be dismissed,

sir.
QUESTION:

If we dismiss as improvidently granted,

I submit that the District Court's judgment would stand.
MR, ST. CLAIR:

Then I 'would retract what I said.

This case should be dismissed

45

QUESTION:

The case would be on appeal in the

Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

Are you now talking about the by­

passing of the Court of Appeals?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

No, sir.

I an talking about the

proceeding before the District Court, through the Court
of Appeals, to this Court.
QUESTION:

If we dismissed this appeal as

improvidently granted, it would go back to the Court of
Appeals.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Well, as I say, I think this

case should be dismissed — period.
QUESTION:

No.

Really what you mean is you

think that the order of Judge Sirica should be vacated
and set aside.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

That is right, sir.

That is quite different from

dismissing the case.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

I agree.

That’s deciding it on the merits.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

That's right.

That is what

I am trying to get across to this Court, perhaps
unartfully — this case should be disposed of, be it by
vacefcing the order below or not.

In any event, it is
/

improper in our view that this case should be heard in the

46

context it is.now being heard.

We wouldn't be here on

Jufc/ 8, before a crowded courtroom if it was not recognized
generally —
QUESTION:

It is a political question hare, and

it was a political question in the District Court.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Exactly.

And therefore it is

a non-justiciable issue in this and in the District Court.
What has happened in this case is —
QUESTION:

Did you argue that to the District judge

MR. ST. CLAIR:

I believe we argued the non-

justiciabilitv argument, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

I know we did.

But —

Your position is that the issuance of

a subpoena duces tecum is not a justiciable issue.
X

MR. ST. CLAIR:

In this context at this time, sir.

What has happened is this.
As you know, on February 24 a Grand Jury secretly
named the President among others as an unindicted co-con­
spirator „

That fact was not made known.

On March 1 an

indictment was returned against a number of the President’s
chief aides.

Cdhcident with that, and in an open courtroom,

the Assistant Prosecutor —- Special Prosecutor, handed up
to the judge a bag, together with a sealed letter, requesting
that this material be sent over to the House of
Representatives.

The President took no position regarding

t’nat proposal, because he considered it to be probably

appropriate, under the belief that there was nothing
accusatory in that material.

Judge Sirica himself rev iewed

the material, found nothing accusatory, and said it would
therefore be quite appropriate to send this material to
the House of Representatives — not realizing and not know­
ing that the Special Prosecutor had previously obtained
a secret charge against the President and others, which
was definitely accusatory.
QUESTION:

But that, as I understand it, was

not among the material that was conveyed to the Grand Jury.
At least that is xvhat I understood Mr. Jaworski to tell
us this morning.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

The material that was turned

over was before the Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

Now, just a moment.

I understood Mr.

Jaworski to tell us this morning very unambiguously and
explicitly, that the fact that the President was named
as an unindicted co-conspirator was not conveyed to the
Grand Jury — I mean to the House of Representatives.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

No, it was not.

The material

was sent to the House of Representatives in the belief
that it was non-accusatory in nature — it was simply
a recital of facts.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

And that is what Mr.

Jaworski has represented again to us this morning,
was the fact of the matter

48
MR. ST. GLAIR:

Mr. Jaworski had available to him,

unknown to the Judge, and unknown to counsel for the
President, a secret indictment naming the President as a
co-conspirator.

The accusatory part followed later.

QUESTION:

Followed in what form?

MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

By a newspaper leak.

It wasn't sent from the court over

to the House.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

It didn't have to be.

question about it.

There can be no

And therefore I say this case has to

be viewed realistically in the context that it is now
being heard.
QUESTION;

I am not sure — perhaps you can help

me — are you suggesting that there was some duty on
the part of the Special Prosecutor to disclose to the
District Judge that there was this secret indictment before
the Judge passed on whether the material should be sent
to the House?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

I think it would have been quite

appropriate, because the Judge’s decision was based on
the proposition there was nothing accusatory; that under
the circumstances absolute fairness was appropriate and
required insofar as the President was concerned.

No one

could argue that the indictment as a co-conspirator,

49
naming him as a co-conspirator, does anything but impair
the Presidents position before the House of Representa­
tives.

That should in my judgement, have been made known

to the Judge.

I don*t know what he would have done under

those circumstances.

His decision was based solidly on

the proposition there was nothing accusatory in the material.
Now, my brother says in his brief that th^s

^

material he now seeks of course will be available to the
House Committee and will be used to determine whether or
not the President should be impeached.
going to continue.

So this fusion is

And under the Constitution, as we view

it, only the legislature has the right to conduct
impeachment proceedings.

The courts have been, from the

history involved and from the language of the provisions,
excluded from that function.

And yet the Special

Prosecutor is drawing the Court into those proceedings,
inevitably, and inexorably.
No one could stand here and argue with any
candor that a decision of this Court would have no impact
whatsoever on the pending inquiry before the House of
Representatives concerning the impeachment of the President.
QUESTION:

Well, how far does your point go?

Let's assume that a murder took place on the streets of
Washington of xdiich the President happened to be one
of the very few eye witnesses.

witness.

And the President was subpoeaned as a

and the courts absolutely have to stop dead in their tracks
from doing their ordinary judicial business?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

I would not say that.

I don't

I don’t

unless

he so determines he would give evidence.

But

the murder —
QUESTION:

Putting that to one side.

You are

saying that the courts, as I understand it, have to stop
dead in their tracks from doing their ordinary business
in any matter involving even tangentially the President
of the United States if, as and when a committee of the
House of Representatives is investigating impeachment.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

No, Justice Stewart, I am not.

The subject matter of these two matters is the same
subject matter.
QUESTION:

Seven people have been indicted,

six of whom remain under indictment.

A trial is scheduled

for next September 9.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:
trial.

Right.

The prosecutor is preparing for that

He is trying under Rule 17 of the Federal Rules

51
of Criminal Procedure to adduce matters to be used in
evidence at that trial.

You say that cannot go forward

because of some tangential effect, or you say a direct
effect, upon some other matter going on in another branch
of the government.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

I say it should not go forward

at this time at the very least, because tine subject matter
being inquired or in large measure before the House Committee
is exactly the same subject matter being involved in this
argument --- namely, should the President produce the
capes.
QUESTIOH:

What in those tapes involves the

impeachment proceedings?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Pardon?

What in any of these tapes is involved

in the impeachment proceeding?

Prosecutor, the Special Prosecutor says this of course

and there we are.
QUESTION:

Mr, St. Clair, going back to this

murder witness situation, if the President, any President,
witnessed an automobile accident, was the sole witness,
or a murder, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggested, you are
not indicating that his fcesti~o*v', his evidence would
not be available to the Court, but merely that he cannot

several Presidents have in the oast.
MR. ST. GLAIR:
QUESTION:

That is quite correct.

The testimony of Justices of this

Cotirt has been given in past times by deposition.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

It really is a matter of

accommodation, not as a matter of assertion of a right of
one branch over anot her.
But the point I want to make is that the same
subject matter is inexorably involved in both proceedings
now proceeding at the same time.

And, you know, the House

of Representatives has not —
QUESTION:

Why were you willing to give up

twenty-some of them?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

That is a very good question,

The decisions that are made

in the impeachment proceedings. Justice Marshall, are
essentially political decisions.
QUESTION:

I bn talking about this case.

QUESTION:

Mr. St. Clair, you left me in a

little bit of doubt about this mechanical problem.
perhaps we diverted you from it.

I think

Are you suggesting that on

a given tape, which is a reel type of thing, having an
hour or more of material, or maybe several hours —
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

Two or three days.

Two or three days — I see.

That

5G
the first three hours might be material which has already
been transcribed and released; the next three or four
hours might be a conference with the Joint Chiefs of Staff
o3r the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, or a
program to give under-developed nations, for example, aid
or peaceful uses of atomic energy — matters totally
irrelevant but confidential.
MR. .ST. CLAIR;

Is that your argument?

It .is my argument, and -the fact.

For example —
QUESTION:

And you want some mechanism sot up

so that these things can be screened out.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
transcripts.

They have been screened out in the

Whatever has been published to the public we

are quite prepared to verify the accuracy of.

Nov/, in the

course of those transcripts there are, of course, portions
left out.
QUESTION:

Have you at any time tendered or

preferred a statement that a particular tape from eighteen
minutes after eleven until three o'clock that afternoon,
including the lunch hour, included a conference with the
Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and someone
else having to do with totally unrelated matters.

Has that

kind of a tender been made?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

No.

We simply published the

portion of that conversation which does not relate to

that with the notation that a portion had been left out»
QUESTION:

But no explanation of why it is left

out.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

It was left out because it did

not involve Presidential action as it related to Watergate,,
or something to that effect.

We did not disclose

the substance of that left-out material.
QUESTION:

Is there any particular reason why

at least the identity of the conferees could not be
made —
MR. ST. CLAIR:
reason.

There might well be such a

My proffer to my brother has been that we will

verify the accuracy of the printed transcript, so this
1240-odd pages of Presidential conversations that are
avalable to the public and available to him will be useable
in the trial.

Now, this may well involve a mechanism

approved by the Court involving counsel for the defendant
to be satisfied —- that they are satisfied that the cony
is accurate.

But this all has to be expurgated out. of a

reel of tape that may involve several days of conversation.
But it is essentially a mechanical problem.
QUESTION:

The tapes that they ask for in this

subpoena duces tecum, which is the only thing before ns —
has any effort been made to say what if any part of that
can be released?

60

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Other than the twenty that

are already published, no effort has been made as yet,
sir.
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Because, if Your Honor please,

we have not felt that it has been necessary to do so,
because we firmly feel that the President has every right
to refuse to produce them.
QUESTION:

You don't think that a subpoena

duces tecum is sufficient reason for you to try?

You just

ignored it, didn't you?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

No, sir, we did not.

a motion to quash it.
QUESTION:

The difference between ignoring and

filing a motion to quash is what?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Well, if Your Honor please, we

QUESTION:

And you are still leaving it up to

this Court to decide it.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

Yes, in a sense.

In what sense?

61

MR. ST. CLAIR;

In the sense that -this Court

has the obligation to determine the law.

The President

also has an obligation to carry out his constitutional
duties.
QUESTION:

You are submitting it for us to decide

whether or not executive privilege is available in this
case.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Well, the nroblem'is the

question is even more limited than that.

Is the executive

privilege, which my brother concedes, absolute or is it
only conditional.
QUESTION:

I said "in this case".

Can you make

it any narrower than that?
MR. ST. CLZilR:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

Well, do you agree that that is what

is before this Court, and you are submitting it to this
Court for decision?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

This is being submitted to this

Court for its guidance and judgment with respect to the
lav;.

The President, on the ot her hand, has his

obligations under the Constitution.
QUESTION:

Are you submitting it to this Court

for this Court’s decision?
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

As to what the law is, yes.

If that were not so, you would not

62
be here.
MR. ST. CLAIR;

I would not be here.

Mew, ray

brother says I have no right to even challenge his right to
be here.

And I would like to deal with that for a moment.
This is, as we have pointed out in our brief, es­

sentially an executive department matter.

Whatever may have

been the arrangements between the branches of the executive
with respect to evidentiary matter — and in fact there
were no arrangements regarding evidentiary matters —
it is not the function of the Court to direct or rule what
evidence will fee presented to it by the executive in the
executive's duty of prosecuting.
If this was a United States Attorney, this case
would not be here, of course.

It is here only because

certain things ware delegated to the Special Prosecutor.
But the Special Prosecutor was not delegated the right to
tell the President what of his conversations are going to
be made available as evidence.

today.

That was specifically

And that is what he is doing right here

Therefore —
QUESTION:

Why wouldn't this case be here if this

were a United States Attorney?

I think I agree with you.

But I would like to ask you to tell me why.
MR. ST. CLAIR;
would be directed —

Well, the United States Attorney

63

QUESTION:

By whom?

HR. ST, CLAIR:

By ■the President or the Attorney

General at the direction of the President
QUESTION:

I thought the Attorney General was

the one who directed the United States Attorney.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

By the Attorney General at the

direction of the President.
QUESTION:

No, no.

In the normal case —

the President doesn't know anything about mine-run federal
prosecutions — that's fair to say, isn't it?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

I think so.

But most cases

don't involve —
QUESTION: And in fact in mine-run cases, the
Attorney General doesn't know much about them.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Yes- sir — with all due

respect.
QUESTION;

Right.

So the United States Attorney

brings a. prosecution, and in the course of that
prosecution he, before trial, subpoenas under Rule 17
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure — he subpoenas
material in the custody of the President.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

So what happens?

The President says to the Attorney

General "I am not going to produce this material."
QUESTION:

No.

It's the United States Attorney

subpoenaing it under your hypothetical case.

MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

That is right

And so what happens?

MR. ST. CLAIR:

In my view the President would

instruct the Attorney General to instruct the United States
Attorney to withdrax* his motion.
QUESTION:

And the United States Attorney says

"I'm not going to do that because I am sworn to uphold
justice."
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Then you would have a new United

States Attorney.
Well, I'm being a little facetious.
QUESTION:

I5m being serious, because I think —

MR. ST. CLAIR:

I think the United States Attorney,

xvith all respect, would and should be removed from that
case.
QUESTION:

By whom?

MR. ST. CLAIR:

The executive pox-zer of the

government is not vested in the United States Attorney;
it is vested in one man and that man is the President
of the United States.
QUESTION:

By statute it is vested — lax*

enforcement is vested in the Attorney General.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Yes.

But that statute

which my brother cites in his brief does not deprive, nor
could it deprive the President of his constitutional authority

65
to be the chief law enforcement officer.
care to see that the laws are enforced.
is vested in him, in one man.

He shall take
The executive power

And the Attorney General is

nothing but a surrogate for the President of the United
States.
QUESTION:

Your argument is a very good one as

a matter of political science, and it would be a very fine
one as a matter of constitutional and probably statutory
law — except hasn’t your client dealt himself out of that
argument by what ha3 been done in the creation of the
Special Prosecutor?

You have just pointed out that the

Special Prosecutor is quite different from the United States
Attorney.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Right.

Perhaps with respect

to everything except — the President did not delegate
to the Special Prosecutor the right to tell him w h ether
or not his confidential communications should be made
available as evidence.

So that within the package of

executive power normally represented by the executive
depariment as to who shall be prosecuted, that has
been delegated to this gentleman and he has exercised that
power.

When — he has done that.

With what eidence —

he has done that, as we will deal with in a few moments.
But not with that portion of the evidence that is a\d.lable
that constitutes Presidential confidential communications.

66

And the Special Prosecutor cannot, and even if the President
did give him that authority, probably could not, as a
constitutional matter, delegate that.
QUESTION:

Delegate what?

But in any event —
He probably v/ould not

and could not delegate what?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

The right to order the President

to give up confidential communications.

That was not

delegated.
QUESTION:

Not the unfettered right to get it,

but the right to go to court and ask a court to decide
whether or not he is entitled to it.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Right.

And the President, under

no circumstances, gave up any of his defense with respect
to that.
QUESTION:

And you are making those defenses

right here and now.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

Making them right no.

No question about that.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

And even if we did agree between

us that we would vest this Court with jurisdiction,
simply because of the politics of the situation, this Court,
by all of its decisions, would not accept the vesting
of such jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Because this Court determines

67
its jurisdiction — the parties can’t agree —
QUESTION:

We all know that law, yes.

And

surely you are right, as I say — a lawsuit between the
Secretary of Commerce, for example, suing the President
over a matter of executive policy, we both agree it would
be unthinkable —■ and since any cabinet officer is the
creature of the President who appointed him, the answer would
be "You're fired."
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

If it goes that far.

If it goes that far — that's right.

But aren't we here met both factually and, I
suggest, legally, with quite a different situation?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

I think not, in terms of

separation of powers, if I may.

My brother *s point of

view is he views himself as the United States as distinguished
from a member of the executive branch.

And in his brief

he invokes the United States as really a fourth entity.
Constitutionally-, a Special Prosecutor, with the power
that my tether suggests he has, is a constitutional
anomaly.

We have only three branches, not three-and-a-third

or three-and-half, or- four.
branch.

There is only one executive

And the executive power is vested in a President.

Now if for political reasons the President wants to dole
out some of those powers, he may so do, and has done in
this case.

But he cannot vest jurisdiction in a court

68

that otherwise the court would not have.

Nor should

the court accept jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

But hasn’t your client also inhibited

himself from the ultimate sanction that you suggested he
could impose with respect to your hypothetical United States
Attorney, i.e., the sanction of dismissing the Special
Prosecutor.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And as a matter of lax7 — regulations

that have the force of law.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
not been dismissed.
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And he has

Nor is he likely to be.
And until and unless he is, we

have a case in controversy of a very real kind.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

The point is, if I may make it,

the only issue here is whether the President gave up his
right to protect the confidentiality of his conversations.
No claim is made that he did.
QUESTION:

You are living testimony to the fact

that he did not give up his right to defend his position
in court,
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

And my brother concedes that.

The fact that the delegation to Mr.

Jaworski gave him the right to contest the President's
claim of privilege presupposed that the President had a

right to assert the privilege — not the right to
assert it necessarily with complete finality.

That is what

v/s are really arguing about here today, isn't it?

matter situation.

If we get beyond the subject

Mow, if this were the Nixon against Sirica

case, where we didn't have what I think is a dispositive
problem in this case, namely the lack of jurisdiction
of the judicial branch to determine this intra-executive
matter — if we had a Grand Jury subpoena, as was true
in the Mixon against Sirica case, then you have intra-branch,
and the Court would have a better standing in its
responsibility to see the Grand Jury's return under its
jurisdiction to have such evidence as they thought appropriate
But we are well beyond that stage.

more restrictive form of evidence.

It has got to be

relevant and admissible,.

It is nothing like a Grand ’ury.

Mr. St. Clair?

MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

Yes*, sir.

In reference to yctir point of our three

branches are three and some fraction, is not the Comptroller
General something of an autonomous factional more than a
third branch figure.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
please,

Well, I don't think, if Your Honor

that the Attorney General represents that the basic

constitutional structure has been changed,

He may have execu­

tive and he may have legislative functions.
QUESTION:

He may proceed with reference to the

Executive Branch and I would assume with reference to expendi­
tures of the Legislative Branch and without consulting either
one of them.

Is that not so?

MR. ST. CLAIR:

I understand.

He is created by a

legislative — It is very much like a semi-independent agency.
In one aspect he’s an agent of the legislature and in the other
aspect he's an agent of the executive.

But we dont have any­

more than Legislative, Judicial, and the Executive Branches.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jaworski, as I understand it is

claiming that he is sorawhat like —• not necessarily precisely
like — but somewhat like the Comptroller General.

He may

believe it is a fifteen year term for the Comptroller General,
and the President, no President can fire -the Comptroller

General and I suppose the Court could not fire him.
MR, ST. CLAIR:

Well, I'm sure the Court couldn't.

I'm not too clear about the President.
I really haven't thought that much of it.
he could be fired.

In the Meyers case
It could be that

But I think that is really somewhat beside

the point because this issue really turns on an admission that

©residential conversations, they weren't delegated.

QUESTION:

That's right.
The only thing before us is as t.o whether

MR. ST. CLAIR:

QUESTION:

Well, I don't see where the House has

got anything to do with the point that I'm talking about.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

QUESTION:

I beg your pardon.

you?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

No, we don’t turn them loose everyday

but we have turned a number loose in the President's discretion
in which he thought was the right thing to do,

more tapes loose.

QUESTION:

I thought you said you believed you would

turn twenty loose.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Those would be the tapes of the

twenty conversations already made public.
QUESTION'; - And you released those tapes.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

We provided a means whereby their

accuracy can be verified.

We release the whole .reel of tape

involving a number of conversations —
QUESTION:

You are still saying the absolute privilege

to decide what shall be released and what shall not be released
is vested in one person and nobody can question it.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Insofar as it relates to the

presidential conversations, that is correct, sir.
QUESTION;

Mr. St. Clair, with the jurisdictional

question, es I further understand it, that argument of yours —
at least I got it from the brief — invo3.ves at least two
separate concepts, maybe three.

One is that this is an intra­

branch dispute and that argument would be fully valid under
the analogy you use in your brief if this were a dispute
between let's say two committees in one of the Houses of
the Congress.

And one cormnifcfcee sued the other for jurisdiction

of a particular matter you suggest, probably quite correctly,
that that, would not be a matter for the judiciary to deter­
mine.

That's one argument.

But this is purely an intra-

6
75
executive branch controversy as it would be between two
congressional committees.

This is intra — Article 2, the

hypothetical case would be intra-article 1 branch.

That's

one argument.
Then you have quite a separate argument it seems
to me, i.e, that the President constitutionally is the chief
prosecutor since he is the executive.

And that it is not for

the courts to decide what a prosecutor shall use in prosecuting
a case.

Now, aren’t those two separate arguments?

You

bring both of them under this rubric?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

That’s correct, sir.

I don’t know

how separate they are but it certainly —
QUESTION:

It seems to me like

they are quite

separate.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
them separate, fine.
QUESTION:

Well, if they're making both of

How, as with respect to
Now, the second argument would have no

relevance at all to your analogy of the legislative branch.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Well, I don’t want to mislead the

Court into thinking that I believe Mr. Jaworski has no right
to determine any evidence that he can use.
QUESTION:

But ultimately you tell us that constitu­

tionally the President has the chief executive and where'
as, constitutionally the chief prosecutor — whatever the
statutes might provide —- has unrestricted discretion in

determining whatever he will or will not use in prosecuting
the case.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Now, I would like to move if I may

to briefly the suggestion that the issue here is non-justicia­
ble on the grounds other than I have already mentioned, namely,
the content in which this case

unfortunately now finds

itself.
It seems to us briefly that cases non-justiciable
for somewhat more technical reasons.

First, this is an issue

where someone has to exercise some indiscretion.

There are no

real bounds or standards by which that discretion should be
exercised.

And by traditional standards of this Court where

that exists then this Court should not take the case.

Secondly

it seems to me there is a textual constitutional grant if we
assxime that the grant of executive power includes the means
by which that can be effectively exercised.
second ground.

That’s the

The third, of course, there is a political

involvement which I have suggested.

Therefore, I suggest

quite briefly that even if there is subject matter jurisdiction

77
the case is non-justiciable for these additional reasons.
The standards of Baker v„ Carr and Powell are not
applicable here.

There

is no individual's rights who have

been protected against the onslaught of Government.

The

President is not here as an individual, he is here as the
constitutional officer in whom the executive power is vested.
There is no philosophy that would support a finding of
justiciability on the grounds that we are strengthening the
democratic processes as true in Powell and also to a greater
extent in Baker and Carr.
If anything, a dicision in this case against the
President would tend to diminish the democratic process.

This

President was elected on the theory that he would have all
the powers,; duties, and responsibilities of any other president.
And iff it is determined that he doesn't, there is a certain
amount of diminution of the political aspect of the case

suggestions were discarded, and a strong

presidency was decided upon, may I say, to the distinctive
management of this country as history has developed.
How by reason of the action of a grand jury the
special prosecutor suggests that this President has something
less than any other president would have.

I would only call

your attention to the action of the framers of the constitu­
tional convention when the issue was raised as to whether or
not a president who was under impeachment should be suspended
during the pendency of the impeachment proceeeding.

And the

decision was definitely he should not because the framers
envisioned a strong, active president even in the course of
impeachment proceedings.

They did not want this country to

be led by someone who didn’t have those full powers even if
hevas under impeachment.

And indeed, this President continues

to function as President, as he should, even though there
are impeachment inquiries underway.

I should think you could run the argument

the other way, saying that since the President cannot be

80
named as an unindicted co-conspirator.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

That could be said.

But by the

naming of him as an unindicted co-conspirator we suggest is
an intrusion by the grand jury on a function that is solely
legislative and not judicial.
QUESTION:

A president could be sued, couldn't he,

for back taxes or penalities or what not?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Well, in questions of immunity I

think individually he could be.
QUESTION:

The Constitution speaks of persons, any

person.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

That's correct.

I think the

President could be sued for back taxes in his individual
capacity.

But in terms of his power to effect the responsi­

bilities of his office, to protect the presidency from un­
warranted intrusions into the confidentiality of his communica­
tions , that's not a personal matter.
QUESTION:

It may be that one of these defendants

might be completely exonerated from something in one of those
tapes.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

As I have suggested, if that defen­

dant will satisfy a Court, that there is such a tape and wil,:.
identify it or will even come close to it and persuade a
Court that that would exonerate him or there's reason to
believe it might I don't believe we'll have a question.

that's not what rny brother here is asking for.

He's asking

for a set number of tapes, not for that purpose, although ha
throws that in but he really wants them ha says for prosecu­

And I would like to review with the Court the question

of the necessity shown for this because he went on his theory
of a qualified privilege.

There has to foe a showing of some

Now we should understand — and I am sure the Court
knows ~ that all of these individuals here involved have
testified before the Senate Select

Committee, with exception

I believe of either Hr. Colson who now has plead guilty under
plea bargain where he has agreed to cooperate so that the
special prosecutor has the full benefit of his testimony.
They have testified on one c.r more occasions before a grand
jury.

In addition, the President has furnished to the special

prosecutor the transcripts and tapes of the critical conversations involved in this alleged conspiracy and I might review
those very briefly with you.

Mr. Dean in his Senate Committee

testimony suggested that on September 15 the President
acknowledged a cover up.

He changed that later to testimony

that he believer! that wa3 so and it was an inference.

In

any event the President furnished that portion of that tape of
the conversation with Mr. Dean.
Mr. Dean also testified that on March 13, 1973,
he discussed the cover up with the President in efforts to

13

32
blackmail the President by one of the defendants who broke
into the Democratic National Headquarters.

Later it developed

that that was a mistake in that it was actually an March 21
and the grand jury indictment proceeds on the theory of March
21st.

The tape of the conversation of blarch 13 was furnished,

all of the conversations between the principals, being two
in number, on March 21st were furnished. The conversations
between the individuals and the President on the next day
in the afternoon of March 22nd was furnished.

And a large

number of additional conversations were furnished.
Now if Reynolds means anything — end Reynolds in
addition to the Kaiser Aluminum case noted a constitutional
question, as I think one of the learned Justices suggested —
one of the reasons for not facing that issue in that case
was it was not necessary because in the case there was a crash
of a bomber that was

on a secret mission, and the Court said

that the parties had the testimony of the witnesses, the
survivors and other testimony that it wasn't necessary to get
to the constitutional question.

I suggest that’s true here.

It is difficult for me to conceive a prosecutor who has more
evidence than this prosecutor has.

He has full benefit o£

a Senate Select Committee investigation which staff had 59-odd
lawyers, existed for a year, he has the benefit of his own

MR. ST. CLAIR:

campaign, about the Nixon campaign?
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

That's getting a little closer.

It isn't closer to the executing of the

laws of the United States, is it, running of a political
campaign?
MR. ST. CLAIR;
QUESTION:

I don't think it is very close, no.

Conversations about that subject matter.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

My brother isn't seeking any such

conversations.
QUESTION:

I know.

But shouldn't the President

have to say at least, even if the privilege is as absolute
as you say it is, shouldn’t he at least have to say

or assert that the executive privilege applies to this tape
because this conversation is in the course of his performance
of his duties as President?
MR, ST. CLAIR:

As I read some of ~~

MR. ST. CLAIR:

We have

simply responded to an assertion that these all relate to
Watergate.

Assuming that to be the facts —
QUESTION:

Would you automatically that every con­

versation about Watergate is in the course of the performance
of the duties of the President of the United States?

MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

I would think it would be, yes, sir.

Why is that, Mr. St. Clair?

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Because he has the duty. A: to

enforce the laws; that is, to prosecute these cases; and B:
he has to take care to see that the lews are enforced; that
is, to investigate.

And much of this material does relate to

the investigation as 1,600 and some pages of the. public trans­
cript fully discloses.

But I would be ready to concede —

and I don't think that it is a difficult problem between us —
that the President should show that the circumstances are
appropriate for the claim of such a privilege and I think such
language appears in Mink and perhaps even in Reynolds and
Kaiser Aluminum.

cation first of all and -~

QUESTION:

Well, that hasn't got much to do with

the decision making process, just pure cold facts.
MR. ST. CLAIRs

It might well have to do with the

decision making process if the facts are such as were developed
in the course of an investigation with regard, to the. existence
of an obstruction of justice charge much of which the President
was involved in.

But the fact against opinion decisions really

relate to another situation as I suggest in the statute but
the conversations that the President has with his advisors
which we suggest is absolutely privileged.

It is a discretionary

matter that he has to exercise in what he is going to release
and not release.

And since Marburv and Madison, Mississippi

and Johnson, it has been clear that the Courts will not direct
a President to exercise his discretion in

lany manner.

This is

excessive

action on the part of the President where excessive action on
the part of the legislature that, has happened a number of
times.

But it*s a far different thing to suggest that the

Court undertake to direct the President to exercise his dis­
cretion in a certain manner.
It is not a ministerial duty by any means.
a matter of discretion.

Ic is

There are some things he feels he

probably should under the circumstances make available and
others he shouldn't.
QUESTION:

In that particular instance, the one

here involves the relevancy of materials to a criminal trial.
And that normally has been a part of the judicial power under
Article III and not executive power.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Well, I would like to discuss very

briefly Gregoirs if I may, for example.

I think this raises

a very important question.
There is, of course, an explicit speech and debate
immunity provided .in the Constitution.
the reason for this is quite clear.

As our brief indicates

It is to protect the

legislature from unwarranted invesion from the executive and
perhaps even the judicial.

It does not mean the executive

is not entitled to substantially the same thing by implica­
tion.

And at least in the civil field, as we have point-M

out, the Courts have worked out by implication as a necessary

21

89
Ingredient to the function of the duties of the executive
an absolute immunity from civil liability for actions taken
within the sphere of the official.

Spalding and. Vilas I

guess is the leading case cited in Barr and Mattso and
other case.
If such a matter can be v/orkecl out with respect to
the executive on civil Matters we suggest there is no reason
why in fact the court should spell out a similar exemption in
criminal matters especially as they relate to the President
himself.

Because while I said the President is not above

the law, the law can only be made applicable to him in a
certain way while he is in office.
Now, if a junior congressman can commit a crime on
the floor of the house as apparently is possible under
Gravel and Johnson {?) is it to be said that the President of
the United Statas rhas less immunity than a junior congressman?
I think not.

So I suggest to you that common sense and the

proper construction of the Constitution imply within the pfen
of executive power all those necessary ingredients to make
it work to be effective which would include immunity and
criminal immunity.

The President we suggest cannot be indic­

ted, cannot be named as a co-conspirator because that is an
assumption of a legislative function under the Constitution,
And therefore we suggest that even if this is criminal the
President is immune from ordinary criminal process.

He is not

22

90

immune from process.

But that process that is available to

the President is the process of impeachment which does not
include the function of the judiciary branch.

And therefore

we say that if under Gravel the congressman is entitled to
immunity even from criminal conduct for actions taken within
the legislation sphere of his conduct then it would be very
hard to support a proposition that the President as the chief
executive of the country is entitled to less,
QUESTION:

Except they didn't put it in the constitu­

And the reason they didn't

was it was not found to be necessary.

They didn't put civil

MR. ST. CLAIR:

It was a speech and. debate case and

it even forbade, as I understand the Gravel case, grand jury
inquiry into motiviations and actions of the senator and his
aid®.
QUESTION:

Because the Constitution said so.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Right.

And I suggest the Constitu­

tion by clear implication provides the same not. only for the
executive but for the judicial as well.

that it should in this case.

And we’re suggesting

Not necessarily because a great

deal is now left to be gained by expunging the grand jury
action.

My brother is right, the damage has been done and we

think quite improperly so.

We think the tactics involved with

the prosecutor in seeking to enlarge the scope of admissible
testimony is hardly wbrth what has been done hare but it has
been done.
But it seems to me history would be served by granting

'V

sh FS

24
92

of the relief we have prayed for below, namely, to expunge
this; secondly, seems to me the American people would feel
better about the fairnesa of the issues now pending before
the House if that were expunged.

93
Insofar as the raechanisims of tills case are
concerned, it destroys or removes a basis on which they contend
they are entitled to these documents.

And I would like to

address that for a moment.
QUESTION:

We have been asked many times

to do

that in other cases witn respect to grand juries, and up
to fcciay I don't think we have ever come anywhere near doinc
it.
MR. ST. CLAIR.

And up to today you have never had

a President of the United States named as a cr-conspirator
either, sir.

That is very true.

President of the United States, we suggest

against only by impeachment while in of tic 2.

And his powers

are unabated until such time as he lec/es that office.
Now with respect to this suggestion that a grand

QUESTION;

That of course has never been decided

either.
MR. ST. CLAIR;

No.

This case i-

unusual in many

respects•
This suggestion that a grand \ jury finding is prima
\

1

facie evidence and therefore the President has lost whatever

94
privilege he otherwise would have had, isn't borne out either
by the facts or the legal issues and principles involved.

A

grand jury finding is not prima facie evidence.
Even if it is mentioned in an opening argument in the
criminal trial, there is a grave risk of a mistrial.

The cases

cited by my brother, particularly the Clark case, are clcax'ly
cases which require a showing in court, or in Clark a showing
to the judge that there was prima facie evidence of wrong
doing.
You may recall that is a case involving an investigation
into a juror as to whether or not the juror had performed
properly.

And the juror, it had been shown, had testified

falsely in the qualifications, that she had never had any
business relations with one of the parties when in fact she
had.

The court said, well, there is a finding of wrong doing,

and based on that now I will look into the jury's deliberations
to see what she did.
But Justice Cardozo made it very clear that, if he
hadn't been able to make a priraa facie showing of wrong doing
by evidence before him, there would have been no cause for
letting xu the light as he put it.
In the Euclid case, and other cases, which are
relied on by my brothers, are all cases where there was a

is not prima facie.

Now a grand jury charge

In the first place .it is only accusatory.

95
It .is not even admassible in, nor can it be referred to in a
trial.
Secondly, it can well involve incompetent evidence
as this Court has recently decided.

And it is totally

inappropriate to suggest that a President who otherwise would
have a very valuable privilege, and I think I should emphasize
the value of this privilege because it is a valuable privilege.
All you have to do is read Justice Reed's decision in
Kaiser Aluminum, and he spells it out quite clearly, the
importance and value of this privilege.

To simply say to have

a grand jury make a charge, that destroys that privilege, is an
argument that I don't think can be sustained.
QUESTION;

Mr. St. Clair, you have not mentioned in

your argument, a few moments ago, on the absence of any
provision for immunity for judges or presidents — you haven't
mentioned the holding of this Court in Pearson against Ray
whereas

recall it the Court assumed with a sentence or two

that there was absolute privilege for the Judiciary but that
the privileges of the Executive, in that case a policeman, was
qualified.

The Court had no difficulty in concluding that it

did not require an expressed constitutional provision to spell
out an absolute privilege for judges.

These were state judges

in that case, of course.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

That's right.

If Your Honor please,

I don't believe that simply because the constitution does not

Your immunity,

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Clause, should this Court hold it does not exist in criminal
matters.
I would like to make one point with the Court, however
because I an sure the point will be raised concerning Justice

arid deliberately so.
QUESTION;

This is pretty far afield from the basic

question here which is the testimonial privilege —
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

We say it’s a constitutional privilege

Not prosecutorial immunity, but testimonial

privilege is what we are dealing with here basically.

97
MR- ST. CLAIR;

That is correct.

I think so.

I want to make the point with you that we think that
the privilege we axe arguing for is both common law and
constitutional law.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. ST. CLAIR.

It is constitutional because it is

inherent in the Executive power* and
QUESTION;

I understand your argument.

But this

matter of whether or not a judge can be prosecuted criminally
has nothing to do with testimonial privilege,- does it?
MR. ST. CLAIR.

Well* my brothers seem to think it

does, because they say because of the implications of criminality
here, the President has lost something he otherwise would not
have had.
QUESTION;

I understand that.

Since I have already

interruped you, may I prevail upon your good nature —
MR. ST. CLAIR.
QUESTION;

Please do.

— Mr. St. Clair, to ask you whether it

is your claim that any of these materials have to do with what
have sometimes been called matters of state, i.e.
international relations or national defense?

matters of

would like to hear what you have to say about that.

But I

Because

as you well know, both the commentators and court decisions have
made a dichotomy between the privilege that exists with respect

98
to general confidentiality on the one hand of the Executive,
and matters of state, on the other, to which a higher privilege
is sometimes been thought to have been accorded.
MS. ST. CLAIR;

Well, I think if a higher privilege

has been accorded, it should not — but in any event the privilec
of confidentialty is not unimportant, however —
QUESTION.

1 know that.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Let me direct, myself to your question.

The answer to your question is no one knows.

You won't know

until you listen tc these tapes as to what subjects are
discussed.

My brother can only state that it is probable that

they relate at least in part to whatever he says, Watergate,
or it's likely that it might.

And I have had the experience,

for example, where circumstances were such that the House
committee felt that it was likely that a conversation took
piece between the Attorney General, Mr. Mitchell, and the
President regarding plans for surveillance of the Democratic
party.

When you looked at the conversation, it wasn't there

at all.
So I have no way of knowing, nor does the Prosecutor
know, what additional matters may be interwoven into these
conversations.

One thing is certain —

QUESTION:

Am I mistaken in believing, Mr. St. Glair,

in understanding, Mr. St. Clair, that in this case to date no
representation has been made by,affidavit or professional

7

99
representation or otherwise that any of these materials have
to do with national defense ox- international relations?
MR. ST. C&AIFU

No.

And no representation can be

made to the contrary either.
QUESTION;

And that would be therefore a matter to

be, under the existing order now under review of Judge Sirica,
that would be submitted to him later in camera.
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION.

If this court finds —

I say under his existing order.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

Yes, that is right.

And the President

presumably if he were to comply with that order, would make
such a representation in an appropriate case,

but the fundamenta

point is that we believe fox" reasons stated that the President's
right to confidential advice is important —
QUESTION:

I understand that.

MR. ST. CLAIR;

And it is actually fundamental to the

proper functioning of his government.

And in many instances I

suggest it is even more important in military matters and matters
of state, so to speak, because no matter what the conversation is
of course, it is the thought that it might become public that
involves then this chilling effect we have made reference to in
our brief under the first amendment.

But as a practical matter,

and I can see it myself, the communications are not free and
open because who is to say that you won't be called before
grand jury.

Most everyone in the White House has been

100
called before a Grand Jury sometime several times.

The FBI

has interviewed every secretary that had any knowledge of
any aspect of this case.
This Prosecutor has a plethora of information.
He says he wants to try the case with all the evidence.
Well, he knows better than that.
all the evidence.

Nobody tries any case with

You would be buried in minutiae.

You

select the evidence that you think most appropriate to your
case.

You don't try it with all the evidence.
And this Special Prosecutor has mountains of

information.
QUESTION:
the prosecutor needs?

Who is to determine how much evidence
Only the prosecutor,

MR. ST. CLAIR: That's correct.

"

QUESTION: Don't you agree?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

That's correct.

Not the Court.

QUESTION: Don41 you agree?
MR. ST. CLAIR:

And if that evidence constitutes

presidential confidential communications, then I suggest,
if Your Honor please, the President determines that.
QUESTION:

Many a case has been lost because the

prosecutor had too much evidence.
MR, ST. CLAIR: Well, I suggest that's probably the
fact here.
So when the government says, I don't need, this

101
evidence to win these cases, in ray opinion, but I need them
so I can present all the evidence.
QUESTIONs Bet you* re still —
MR. ST. CLAIR:

That’s not v?hsat he is really after,

Yes, I've tried a few, too,

[Laughter.]
Mr. St. Clair, I Weis just wondering, where do you
see the burden here ~~ is on the prosecution?
MR. ST„ CLAIR: The burden under 17(c) is clearly
on the prosecution, and the burden is clearly on the
prosecution on every other aspect.
QUESTION: Right.

And now, how much is enough for

our phrase we've been kicking around, Prima facie?
MR, ST, CLAIR: Well, I suggest whatever was considered
by this Court in Reynolds to be enough, is more than enough in
this case.

We have the testimony of every individual

involved, a number of them have pled guilty.
guilty.

Colson has pled guilty.

et cetera, et cetera.

Dean has pled

Kalmbach has pled guilty,

All under plea bargains, where they

are under obligation to fully cooperate.
This Prosecutor is not, nor does he say at any
point that he needs this information to prosecute successfully
these cases,
QUESTION:

Mr. St. Clair, just to pinpoint another

102
issue, let’s assume for the moment that we didn't agree with
you on your test of privileged, and let’s just assume that
the only issue that was left in the ease was the 17(c) issue.
Now, -MR. ST. CLME:

Then the President wins, in my

view,
QUESTION: Well, because?
HR. ST. CLAIRs Because the Prosecutor cannot show
that the evidence'he seeks is relevant and admissible.
Because of the nature of the circumstance, he doesn't know
what’s in there.
QUESTION: Well, I suppose there are two parts to
the question:

one, how much of a showing does he have to

make as to what might be on the tape? and, secondly, if that
matter that he claims is on the tape is on the tape, is
that relevant and admissible under 17(c)?
MR. ST. CLAIRs

You would have to know what the

matter was, what the issues in the case were, but under
Bowman and Iozia, it’s not enough to show that it probably
is or it might be or is likely to be; it must be shown to be
relevant, and must be shown to be admissible.
QUESTION: But, Mr. St. Clair, —
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

That’s why it’s not a third-party

Mr. St. Clair, you can't put an

impossible task on someone who wants to subpoena against a

103

4

third-party witness, or against anybody else, as to showing
what is precisely in some documents, I *>ould suppose,
MRo ST. CLAIRs

Well, if you want to utilize 17(c),

then I suggest that’s what you have to do,
QUESTIONS

He’s never listened to the tapes.

doesn't know precisely what's on them.

He

You would say that

he could never subpoena a tape unless he had already gotten
it.
NR» ST. CLAIRs

As a prosecutor, that’s right.

QUESTIONs Well, that’s —
MR. ST, CLAIRs As a Grand Jury, that's another
matter.

If he had sought these under a Grand Jury

subpoena, we would then be directly faced with Nixon v.
Sirica, which we happen to think was improperly, incorrectly
decided.
Rut under 17(c) we’re dealing with the Prosecutor’s
subpoena.

The decided cases make it quite clear there must

be a specific showing of relevance and admissibility.
Now, if he can’t do it because of the nature of —~
QUESTION:

Well, that isn't what 17(c) —

MR. ST. CLAIRs

That’s his problem, not mine.

QUESTIONS The cases you’re talking about are cases
where a defendant sought discovery of evidence from the -—
or sought material in the prosecutor's files.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Most of those cases are, but there is

at least one-case, I think it's Grossman, that says the
ru3.es are equally applicable to the prosecution; it's cited
in one of the footnotes in our brief.
But a 17(c) subpoena is conceptually a subpoena
for known information, conceptually, if the prosecutor is
looking for things, he should utilise a Grand Jury subpoena»
In that case, I think in Bowman they wanted the prosecutor
to produce each document he was going to use in the
presentation of his case»

That’s specific.

It’s obviously relevant and admissible,
QUESTION; So once he gets through with the Grand
Jury he can’t,, he shouldn’t be using a subpoena to develop
his case?
MR. ST. CLAIR;

That's correcto

And certainly not under these circumstances»
QUESTION; Do you think that’s the practice in the
federal courts —
MR. ST. CLAIR;

I think it .is the practice,

I

think that the Grand Jury practice is far, far greater perhaps
than the Constitution has envisioned.

It's really used

today, frankly,, as an effective discovery tool.
QUESTION;

Mr. St. Clair, may I get back to what

secerns rather fundamental to me.

Let us ass urn a that it had

been established that the conversations we are talking about
here today did involve a criminal conspiracy, would you still

105

be asserting an absolute privilege?
HR, 8T„ CLAIR:

Yes, quite clearly.

Under the

analogy with Gravel that I made,
QUESTION: Right. And as I understand it, the public
interest behind that privilege is the preservation of candor
in discussions between the President and his closest aides.
MR. ST. CLAIR: Quits clearly so.

The simple

reason, sir, ~QUESTION:

Right.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

May I follow that up?

I'm sorry.

QUESTION: What public interest is there in
preserving secrecy with respect to a criminal conspiracy?
MR. ST. CLAIR: The answer, sir, is that a criminal
conspiracy is criminal only after it's proven to be
criminal»
QUESTION: But my —
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

And we're not at that point yer.

My question was based on the assumption

that it had been established that the conversation did relate
to cv criminal conspiracy.
MR. ST. CLAIR;

That is, the case has been tried

and the defendant found guilty.
QUESTION:

Ho.

Well, it could have been established

in various ways, as you just said, a number of people have
already confessed, and these people were participants in some

106

oi these conversations
MR, ST. CLAIR; But the fact that one defendant
confessed does not make the other defendant guilty,
QUESTION;

Of course.

But, anyway, your answer

is that you would still assert absolute privilege,
MR, ST, CLAIR;
criminal.

The answer is yes, even if it is

But, more importantly, it is yes, because

criminality is something that is not necessarily determined
at the time that you must resolve the issue.

And that you

should not destroy the privilege in the anticipation of a
later finding of criminality which may never come to pass.
It is quite conceivable that a number of these
defendants will be found innocent.

And, in fact, in theory,

they are innocent right now,
QUESTION: Nhat is the public interest in keeping
that secret?
MR, ST, CLAIR;

To avail the President, if Your

Honor please, of a free and untrammeled source of information
and advice, I'rithaufc die thought or fear that it: may be
reviewed at some later time, when some Grand Jury in this
case, or some other reason, suggests there is criminality,
Por example, —
QUESTION;

But you —

MR, ST, CLAIR;
QUESTION:

— it’s very important — I'm sorr

You did release them for the Grand Jury

m3

107
in this case»
MR. ST. CLAIR:
he did that.

Yes.

In the President's discretion,

-And it’s a discretionary matter.

But, for example, the simple matter of appointments,
if I may, an appointment of a judge, it's very important to
the judiciary to have good judges.

It's not at all unheard-

of for lawyers to be asked their opinion about a nominee.
Now, if that lawyer wants to be sure that he’s
going to be protected in giving candid opinions regarding a
nominee for the bench, it’s absolutely essential that that
be protected.

Otherwise, you’re not going to get candid

advice.
Nov;, this isn’t a State secret, it isn’t national
defense? I suggest it's more important, because that judge
may sit on that bench for thirty years.
QUESTION: Well, don't you think it would be
important if the .judge and the President were discussing how
they were going to make appointments for money?
MR. ST, CLAIR:

I'm sorry, sir, I didn’t understand

your question,
QUESTION: Don't you think it would be important in a
hypothetical case if an about-to-be-appointed judge was
making a deal with the President for money?
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

But under yours it couldn’t be.

In public

108
interest you couldn't release that.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

I would think that that could not

be released,, if it were a confidential communi cation.
If the President did appoint such an individual, the remedy
is clear, the remedy is he should be impeached.
Let me give yon an example ~QUESTION:

How are you going to impeach him if

you don't know about it?
MR. ST. CLAIR: Well, if you know about it, then you
can state the case.

If you don't, know about it, you don't

have it.
QUESTION: So there you are.

You're on the

prongs of a dilemma, hunt?
MR. ST. CLAIR:
QUESTION:

No, I don't think so.

If you know the President is doing

something wrong, you can impeach him; but the only way you
can find out is this way; you can't impeach him, so you
don't impeach him.

You lose me some place along there.

{Laughter.j
MR. ST. CLAIR:

Well, this is. I think, what

was suggested in the Seborg case, where the Court said, Well,
gee, if that is so, then fraud could be all covered over and
so forth.
Human experience has not demonstrated that's a
fact, very few tilings forever are hidden.

109
Secondly, however, this case is not that case»
As 1 pointed out, there is a plethora of information.
This is not a case where there is no information.

If any­

thing, there is pore than enough.
QUESTION: Well, what you're telling us also could
he argued the other v/ay, that there’s been a waiver and
neither you ~~
HR. ST. CLAIR;

That has been suggested by my

brother.
QUESTION:
waiver.

— nor your brother have talked about

I don’t suggest that it’s ~
MR. ST, CLAIR:

My brother suggests a waiver, but

this privilege is not like Fifth Amendment privilege or
attorney - • client privilege, where if you let out one word
you’ve lost the whole thing.

That would defeat the purpose

o r r '•..
QUESTION;

Yes,

MR. ST. CLAIR: As we’ve pointed out in our brief,
public policy requires as much publicity as the President,
in his discretion, determines would be appropriate and the
more information the better.

And if you require — if you

rule that one utterance constitutes a waiver ~~
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. ST. CLAIR:

— you’re not going to get it;

you're not going to have that thing.

This is a discretionary

L

110

privilege that the Constitution, by implication of necessity
and history, has shown is inherent in the executive function
as indeed it is .in other functions.
We’ve cited in our brief similar examples of the
Legislature insisting upon such a privilege, even against
subpoenas from courts, Executive, and from the courts
themselves.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. St. Clair, you are

cutting into your rebuttal time now.
MR. ST. CLAIR:

I know.

I do appreciate being

reminded of that, and 1' think I would preserve it, which
I think is ten more minutes of it. •
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Lacovara.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP A. LACOVARA, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. LACOVARA;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

If I may, I would like to advert first to
procedural questions that Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr.
Justice Stewart have raised about whether -the mandamus case
is properly here.
Mr. Justice, we did, in our certiorari petition,
refer to the fact that we were trying to bring before the
Court, for review before a judgment in the Court of Appeals,
the order of the District Court, which we said the President
had tried to obtain review of in two ways in two cases in

ill
the District Court ~~ in the Court of Appeals, rather»
And we gave the docket numbers of those two cases,
That certiorari petition was filed on the 24th of
May, and Judge Sirica, who is the respondent, as Justice
Stewart properly notes, in the mandamus case in the Court of
Appeals, was served with a copy of the certiorari petition,
as he had been served with the mandamus petition, as, indeed,
had all the respondents who were otherwise before the court,
the defendants in the United States v„ Mitchell,
On May 28th, in accordance with a motion that was
filed in the Court of Appeals, a copy of which, I believe, is
in the files of this Court, the Court of Appeals transmitted
to this Court the records in both of those cases, the appeal
and the mandamus cases.
Now, Mr. Justice Stewart, with respect to Judge
Sirica's appearance here, he is a party before this Court,
and I believe there is a letter on file with -the Clerk of
this Court from Judge Sirica, in which he states that he will
not appear separately, the United States, through the Special
Prosecutor, is appearing on behalf of Judge Sirica, as,
indeed, we would have in the Court of Appeals, to uphold his
decision enforcing our subpoena.
So the case, procedurally, is properly before the
Court, both with respect to the appeal and the mandamus
proceeding.

3

112
I would, like to
QUESTION:

Mr» Lacovara, before you get too far,

let's assume you get by the jurisdictional matters and also
the standing question, the intra-Executive dispute matter,
and we get to the executive privilege or get to the merits,
so-called —
MR. LACOVARA:
QUESTION:

Yes,

— which end of this case should we,

would we normally start at, anyway?

At the 17(c) end or

the executive privilege end?
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, I think — normally — I

think normally you might start at the 17(c) end, because that
would provide for a,conceivably for a disposition on nonconstitutional grounds if you found that we had not made a
sufficient showing to satisfy the ordinary requirements of
that rule.
So, in accordance with the Court's normal juris­
prudence
QUESTION:

Mr. Lacovara, Judge Sirica found that

you had satisfied the requirements.
MR. LACOVARA:
QUESTION:

Absolutely.

We3.1, then what's the scope of our

review?
MR. LACOVARA: We have made the suggestion that any
appellate court reviewing this kind of determination applies

113

I

a standard of whether the district judge, who is intimately
familiar with this indictment and with the 43-page appendix,
showing that we submitted, in demonstrating why each of these
64 subpoenaed conversations was material, he made the
finding that we had clearly demonstrated relevance and an
evidentiary nature, and —■
QUESTION:

What’s our standard of appellate

review?
HR, LACOVARA: And your standard should be whether
he has abused his discretion.
QUESTION: Clearly erroneous?
HR. LACOVARA: Clearly erroneous standard, yes, sir,
QUESTION: What about the standard, though?
MR. LACOVARA:

I'm sorry, it’s the basis standard,

he called it.
QUESTION:

What about the basic standard of 17(c)?

MR. LACOVARA:

I think the parties are in agreement,

that Bowman Dairy and lozia,that District Court decision,
established the basic criteria.
QUESTION: Are you — the government is in agreement
that the standards of lozia must be satisfied in this case
under 17 (c) »
MR. LACOVARA: Well, ws have suggested that it’s
possible that a lower standard can be applied.
QUESTION: Well, that’s what I’m asking you. What

5
114

is your position?
MR» LACOVARA:

Well, mv position, would be that when

you are talking about a subpoena to a third party,, as
distinguished from an intra-case subpoena between government
and defendant, a lower standard of relevancy or materiality
should —
QUESTION:

So -the parties are not in agreement at

all?
MR. LACOVARA: Well, we have suggested that even if
the proper standard is applied, that we meet that standard
because of the showing that we made that each of these
items is -~
QUESTION:

Is a necessity standard?

MR. LACOVARA:

Necessity in the sense of being

relevent, to the issues to be tried, and being of an
eviden tiary nature.
Now, the necessity standard comes in more in
determining whether the executive privilege claim should be
.overridden if, apart from the waiver fact and what we call
the Clark point —
QUESTION:

It was Mr. St, Clair's argument that

under 17(c) you can't possibly satisfy its requirements,
because you don't know what's in the tapes.
MR. LACOVARA:

Oh, well- that obviously we don’t

think is a proper legal standard, and the courts have said ~

s

115

in fact we go back to Chief Justice Marshall*® opinion in the
Burr cause, where exactly the same suggestion was made by
the United States Attorney in opposing the subpoena, that
Burr hadn't specified which portions of General Wilkinson's
letter were really going to be material, and Chief Justice
Marshall replied, with his eloquent common sense, “Of course
not, because he hasn't seen the letter yet.

But he’s made

a sufficient averment that it does contain something material,
that at least it should bra brought into cxnirt."
How, we, as I say, have gone much further than
Colonel Burr did.
QUESTION:

You think loala just .means only evidenti­

ary and relevant, is that what you —• is that your reading
of that case?
MR. LACOVARA: When you're talking about a
subpoena between the parties, yes, sir.

They talk about

other criteria, which I think are really assumed, whether it's
a fishing expedition, whether you're going off on a frolic.
But, as the later cases, as, I believe, Judge
Sirica indicates, seem to have distilled that ~~
QUESTION: So you don't think login and those -™
and Bowman requires any shewing that this particular
evidence be something mere than evidentiary and relevant?
MR. LACOVARA:
QUESTION:

Yes.

That it be critical?

17

116
MR. LACOVARAs
QUESTION:

No, sir, I don't believe so.

Yes.

MR. LACOVARA:

I think that, as you were suggesting

before, and as Judge Sirica held, it’s never been the law
that once an indictment is returned, the prosecution is not
entitled to continue gathering evidence.

The burdens of

proof before a Grand Jury and a trial jury are clearly
different.

It*s an abuse of the Grand Jury process that

has been held, to use a Grand Jury subpoena, as Mr. St. Clair
suggested, to continue gathering evidence after an indictment;
is returned.
QUESTION:

Yes, but you apparently concede that

you can’t use it just for discovery?
MR. LACOVARAs

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And you say that the evidence you’re
seeking by a subpoena, you must make some kind of a minimal
showing of admissibility, you can’t, for example, seek
some tiling that would admittedly be inadmissible hearsay?
MR. LACOVARA: Well, I hope I’m not conceding more
than I should, but the rule does talk about subpoenaing
material from a person on a showing that .it will be relevant,
It3s Rule 17, and I'm taking a. position which is
narrower than of course you’re suggesting, Mr. Justice, that
I might, take.

But, in all candor, 'the rule talks about

subpoenaing documents from a person, not only from a party,

3

117

Mr, Justice Douglas# I believe you earlier mentioned that
the rule applied only to subpoenas to parties„

But the

rule specifically provides for subpoenas to persons who are
not parties to the case.
But it says# and this was the clause that we were
relying on here# the Court may direct that the books or
papers be produced before the Court at a time prior to the
trial or prior to the time when they are to be offered in
evidence,
So there does seem to be some natural focus about
the evidentiary nature of this case,
QUESTION?

I just wanted to get the governments

position# because it is a rather important part of the case.
MR. LACOVARAs

Yes# sir»
>

We insist# as Judge Sirica found, that the citation
of chapter and verse, if I may# in our 49-page showing before
the District Court# with references to sworn testimony# as
well as with representations about what witnesses will testify
at trial# we demonstrated why each of these subpoenaed
conversations satisfies the Bowman Diary# lozia# Rule 17(c)
standard.
Now# that leads me into the related point —
what is the relevance of the Grand Jury’s finding
that the President was a co-conspirator in this case?
It has been alleged that we did this in order

118
to prejudice the President’s rights.

I think we have

sought to demonstrate in our reply brief that that was •—
QUESTION:

Mr, Lacovara, I don’t think it would

be very hard to understand the developments of a showing
at the trial, for purposes of evidence, that certain people
are co-conspirators, for purposes of introduction of evidence.
But that’s a little different question than the relevance
of the Grand Jury having come to that conclusion.
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes.

Normally I would concede

it is not the practice, as anyone who has been a
prosecutor knows, for the Grand Jury, if it is not
identifying the co-conspirators in the body of its indict­
ment, to place them on the record.

It is fairly common

practice, however, for an indictment to say "In addition
to the defendants, the named persons are unindicted
co-conspirators."
QUESTION:

This is not an ordinary case.
That may be so.

But even if t hey

named them in the indictment, that is not enough on which
to base the introduction of out-of-court statements by
an unindicted co-conspirator.
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes.

That was the point that

I wanted to get to in discussing xdiat we call our clause
argument.

We have never argued, and of course Idle re would

be no basis for arguing, that the mere Grand Jury finding,
whether on the face of the indictment or in the Grand Jury's

119
minutes, that the President or any of the other 18
unindictcd co-conspirators were members of this conspiracy
would itself be enough at trial to warrant the judge's
admission of extra-judicial statements given by those co­
conspirators.

We are not making that contention here.

The issue arises because a motion to quash a subpoena was
filed prior to trial.

\nd the basis for that motion was a

claim of executive privilege, a governmental privilege that
exists for the benefit of legitimate governmental
processes.
We countered t tet apart from Mixon vs. Sirica
and the balancing process, and apart from the waiver
argument that we also developed at some length, this
President, as difficult as it was to say this — not
because of the evidence but because of the inherent
av/kwardness of it — this President is not in a position
to claim this public privilege, for the reason that
a prima facie showing can be made that these conversations
were not in pursuance of legitimate gosernmental processes
or tile lawful deliberation of the public's business.
These conversations, as we showed in our 49-page appendix,
and as the Grand Jury alleged, were in furtherance of a
criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States and
obstruct justice.
We did not rely, even before Judge Sirica,

120
end we do not rely here, merely on the fact that the Grand
Jury made this determination.

We do submit that for

purposes of a pre-trial consideration of a subpoena that
is challenged on grounds of executive privilege, x^e are
not confronted xvith the need that we xd.ll be confronted
with at trial, which we fully intend to discharge, of showing
by evidence to the trial judge that the President and
the other co-conspirators were members of the co-conspiracy.
QUESTION:

One of your grounds for the non-

applicability of the privilege is that these conversations
\tfere in the course of the conspiracy.
MR. LACOVARA:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And that you say is satisfied

by merely the Grand Jury?
MR. LACOVARA:
QUESTION:

No, sir — absolutely not.

Just a moment.

It is not satisfied
So a court must, go on

and make its own determination — if they were going to
agree with you on this ground.
MR. LACOVARA:

Let me back up a little.

see the point that you are making.

I

We are taking the

position that the Grand Jury’s determination is conclusive
on the Court on fcx^o issues:

(a) that a conspiracy existed,

and (b) that President Nixon was a member of the conspiracy.
That is not enough, we concede, to override a claim of

121
executive privilege — because, as Mr. St, Clair well says,
he is still the President, and he is still in a position
to invoke executive privilege.

Where we have said we must

bear an evidentiary burden to the satisfaction of the Court
is on drawing the nexus between the subpoeaned conversations
and the conclusively determined prima facie showing that
there is a conspiracy of which the President is a member.
We made that evidentiary showing to Judge Sirica.

showing was sufficient.

That

Judge Sirica found that that

And for that reason, as I believe

his opinion ■— although it had to be guarded becaxise
these items were placed under seal — reflects that he did
make the showing.
QUESTION:

Well, that showing, or such a showing

could arguably have been made whether or not the Grand
Jury had named the President, could it not?
MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, sir, it could have been made

as an evidentiary matter.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

QUESTION:

Isn't it your position that it was

independently of the naming of the President?
MR. LACOVARA:

The evidence that was

sufficient to make that showing.

And x-/e have said that

that is not legally necessary; that we didn't have to

take three months to try in order to defeat a claim of
executive privilege before trial.
This Court has frequently said the criminal
process would be burdened down unduly if proceedings were
preceded by mini-proceedings.
here.

That is exactly what we have

We submit the evidence is sufficient.

Judge Sirica -

this is a situation in which the showing that we did submit,
intrinsically, we submit, tracks the allegations of the
indictment and provides independent evidentiary support
for those allegations.
We have said, though, that it is not legally
necessary in a proceeding like this for a court independently
to decide whether the Grand Jury had enough evidence before
it to say there is a conspiracy, or that a particular
individual was a member of the conspiracy.

We said all

you need to find is that we have shown that these conversations
were in furtherance of this conspiracy.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lacovara, let's back up a minute.

Do you concede that an incumbent President of the United
States could not be indicted and tried for a crime?
MR. LACOVARA:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

You do not.

MR. LACOVARA:

Do you think he could be?

We have not expressed a position

on that, Mr. Justice Powell.

123
QUESTION:
could not be.

Let’s assume for the moment that he

Would you still argue that the Grand Jury

had the power or the right, and if so by virtue of what?
MR. LACOVARA:
QUESTION:

Yes.

We —

To name him as an unindicted co-

conspirator.
MR. LACOVARA:
at some length.

We do in fact make that argument

I guess all of our arguments are made

with too much length.

But we do argue at length, sir,

seriously, that the question of Presidential indictability,
which we offer some views on, just to show that the question
is an open one, because of our obligation we believe to
the law and to the courts, is not really determinative
of the question that is really in this case, to the extent
that the Court reaches the expungement argument advanced
by counsel or to the extent that the Court does not reach
the so-called Clark argument — that is executive privilege
just cannot be invoked here.
The issue of Presidential indictability
does not determine the issue which an incumbent President
can be named as an unindicted co-conspirator by a Grand
Jury.
We have shown in our brief why even persons
who do have some constitutional immunity — and counsel
argues that implicitly under the framework of the

124
Constitution, the President should have an implicit,
immunity from prosecution — even such persons can be and
frequently are named by Grand Juries as unindicted
co-conspirators,
The practical arguments that may militate in
favor of a judicial recognition of some unique immunity
for the President alone — not for Circuit Judges, not
for Supreme Court Justices, not for Members of Congress,
but the President alone it may be held at some later date
is immune from prosecution - but that by no means
suggests the answer to the question here.

And the Grand

Jury elected not to test that issue.
QUESTION:

The thing that I was wondering about

is that there is only one President, and executive power
is vested in him.

And I do wonder whether or not the

precedents you set with respect to other people would
vest the atithoritv in a Grand Jury, either on its own
motion or because of what some prosecutor suggested, while
the President is in office to name him as an unindicted
co-conspirator.

With Grand Juries sitting all over the

United States, and occasionally you find a politicallymotivated prosecutor — that’s a rather far-reachincr
power, if it exists.
i

MR. LACOVARA:
is no doubt about it.

It is, Mr. Justice, and there
We are conscious of the

125
delicacy of the issue»

We have suggested, however, that

although there is some conceivable opportunity for abuse,
our judicial system, our democratic system is based
on several fundamental propositions, one of which is that
Grand Juries usually are not malicious.
cannot be assumed to be malicious.

Even prosecutors

We also assume, as

this Court regularly holds in first amendment cases dealing
xfith public officials, that we have a resilient society
where people can be trusted to sort out truth from
falsehoods.

We have a robust debate.

I submit to you, sir, that just as in this
case a Grand Jury would not lightly accuse the President
of a crime, so, too, the fear that, perhaps without basis,
some Grand Jury somewhere might maliciously accuse a
President of a crime is not necessarily a compelling
reason for saying that a Grand Jury has no power to do that
I think the system may be vibrant enough to deal with that,,
And I think the inherent dignity of the Presidential
office «ori any incumbent

providsshira with a notable

check against being defeated, or as my colleague says,
impeached by the action of a Grand Jury.

This is perhaos

the most notorious event, notorious case in recent times.
When the Grand Jury’s action was disclosed, I venture to
say that although it was a difficult time for all concerned
including the prosecutors as well as other counsel and

126
the country — the President has not. been displaced from
office, he still is President, he still functions in
accordance with his constitutional powers.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lacovars, I wanted to get to

this mechanical question that Mr, St, Clair brought up.
Assume for the moment that a given tane, one of the 64 tapes
is in fact one-eighth of the total time, which might he
several hours, apparently, because they are long taws —
but one-eighth of it involves discussions of the people
who are under indictment here, but that seven-eights of
it in fact now — we have to assume this — includes
conferences with the Secretaries of the Cabinet, with the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission, very high-level people, and perhaps seme staff
people as well — including in those conversations some
highly sensitive material; not. sensitivo in the sense that
it is national military secrets or diplomatic secrets,
but sensitive in the sense of confidentiality.

Would you

not think that some mechanism ought to be available that
if the participats are identified, as you have got them
all identified by the voluntary submission of the President,
as to the 64 — that if the participats are identified
and the time frame specified that the certificate of the
major persons present, that the subject, was atomic energy,
all sorts of other things, would be sufficient to foreclose

127
a court from examining it in camera?
MR. LACOVARA:
QUESTION:

Well —

I am asking would you think so.

MR. LACOVARA:

The answer to the question, Mr.

Chief Justice, is yes, because these are the procedures
that have been set up in the Court of Appeals decision in
Nixon vs. Sirica, which were found to be eminently
practical when the tapes subpoeaned by the Grand Jury were
submitted.

These are six-hour reels.

And under the so-called

index and analysis which the Court of Appeals in that
case required tobe submitted, and which Judge Sirica here
has required to be submitted, counsel for the President
says this is a six-hour reel; the Watergate portions are
minutes 312 — no, that's too many — 112 through 146.
Prior to that there is a meeting between the President
and the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare on
the school bill.

After the Watergate-related discussions

there is a meeting between the President and representatives
of the National Association of Manufacturers.
What has happened is that White House counsel
has come to Judge's chambers with the original reels.
They have marked the beginning of the Watergate-related
portions on those reels for the Court to make an
independent determination this is Watergate-related and
therefore offset by whatever overcoming of the privilege

128
has been held — and after that is done, a copy of the
Watergate-related portions is made.

The Judge does not

listen to the non-Watergate-related portions which are
still covered by a presumptive executive privilege, which
we have freely conceded from the time the Grand Jury
began this process in July of '73 to our brief in this
Court.

129
QUESTION:

Then as to this hypothetical seven-

eighths, there is, you suggest, no disagreement between you.
and Mr. St. Clair and Mr. Jaworski and you, on the one hand?
MR. LACOVARA: That's correct, sir.

And I might

say that under the procedure that was worked out, this may
predate Mr. St. Clair, so you will have to rely solely on
my representation, the President indicated a willingness to
allow the judge to listen to a few moments of conversation
on either end of the portion of the tape that had been
listed in this index and analysis as being Watergate-related,
just so he would have an assurance that there was a
transition from one subject to another subject.
That was agreed to by the President as being, if
a minimal intrusion on the confidentiality privilege for
an unrelated subject, then certainly by no means an excessive
one.
QUESTION:
minutes.

Mr. Lacovara, you have only a very few

Are you going to address Mr. St. Clair's opening

argument that the pendency of the House Judiciary impeachment
inquiry either should lead the Court to conclude that this
whole business before us is a nonjusticiable matter,
therefore, necessarily, that Judge Sirica's order should be
quashed.

Or, in any event, that because of the p>ossihle

effect of a decision on the issue presented, upon the
impeachment inquiry, that the Court should stay its hand,

130
MR. LACOVARAs

That was to be my last point, sir,

and I will make it right now.
The notion that because there is concurrently
underway an impeachment inquiry before the House of
Representatives, that somehow makes this a nonjusticiable
political question is, we think, a remarkable notion which
is not supported by sound constitutional law or by any of the
decisions of this Court, and, indeed, I submit that to the
extent that the Court has discretion in the matter, and
although this Court has now been given discretionary certiorari
power, District Courts have no such option, it would not
even be a wise exercise of discretion for this Court to stay
its hand.
This case before the Court is not a request for an
opinion between two congressional committees as to who has
jurisdiction over a particular bill.

It’s not even a

request for a dispute between Cabinet officers, or the
President and a Cabinet officer, over what proper executive
policy ought to be.
This is a criminal proceeding, a federal criminal
case against six defendants.

A subpoena has been issued to

obtain evidence for use at the trial which is scheduled to
begin on September 9th.
The Court cannot escape the fact that this is a trial
of tremendous national importance, but a trial that was brought

to a head without regard to the impeachment inquiry.

This

is an independent, separate constitutional process that is
under way, and a traditional, ordinary, prosaic remedy, a
subpoena has been utilized to obtain evidence for that
trial.
There is some debate about whether the evidence is
critical to our prosecution,

I noted in Justice Rehnquist's

opinion a few weeks ago, in Michigan v. Tucker, that he
echoed, or presaged, perhaps, the same point that Judge
Sirica made, that it's really the obligation of the
prosecution to present all of the material evidence for the
jury, for the fact-finder to pass upon.
That's what this case involves.
Now, to say that there will be public consequences,
even political consequences to the Court's action does not
mean that this is a political question, so that the Court
must regard it as nonjusticiable.
The same argument would have prevented this Court
from deciding Marbury and Madison.

It's common knowledge

that Chief Justice Marshall, himself, was threatened with
impeachment if he decided the case against President
Jefferson,

He went ahead and did his duty on behalf of this

QUESTION:

But in that sense —

MR. LACOVARA:

— if one reads the case again, sir,

I submit, Chief Justice Marshall got to the original juris­
diction point only after he had been very decisive in saying
that a lower court could issue and should issue and would be
obliged to issue the mandamus to Secretary Madison, because
the President had no legal power to order Secretary of State
Madison not to issue that commission.
He held that

it might be called dictum, but it

certainly at the time was a courageous act,
QUESTION: But the basic ruling in the case related
to the original jurisdiction of the Court under Article III,
did it not?
MR. LACOVARA:

I concede that, sir

133
Later, however, when he did go on, in 1807, to issue
the subpoena to President Jefferson, that was an act of
profound political consequences, but he stated, again
eloquently, that it was the Court's duty to obtain evidence
if it were material to the trial.
The notion that political consequences should stay
the hand of the Court is a notion that, again speaking
?

through Marshall, the Court rejected in Cohens v, Virginia,
and the Cherokee Nation case, where it was common knowledge
that the States, the State Legislaturas in Virginia and
Georgia would interpose themselves and defy this Court, and
Marshall uttered

the words, which X think are justly

famous, that just as the Court can't reach out for juris­
diction it doesn't have, it has an obligation to exercise
the jurisdiction it does have, whatever may be the political
consequences of that act.
The Court's action in Ex Parte Milligan, in telling
President Lincoln that he did not have the power to conduct
the Civil War the way he wanted to conduct it; again profound
political consequences.
We come to the War Power cases in World War XX,
the Japanese Exclusion cases, this Court did not say that
because of the consequences for the President, or because of
the political reaction to a decision one way or the other
the Court should stay its hand

132*
In Youngstown, where our colleague's brief closes
by quoting Justice Frankfurter's brilliant concurring opinion,
saying how the Court should, as an institution, be reluctant
to decide great constitutional questions.

But he went on

to say: "We have an obligation to look into an assertion of
presidential power.

And even if the embarrassment to be

caused to the President by our disagreeing with him would be
profound, it is still the duty of the Court to tell him when
he *s wrong."
This Court, in Powell v. McCormack, how could there
be a more political case than telling a house of Congress
that it had to seat a member that it had excluded?

But the

Court said the Constitution forbade it, it's up to the Court
to decide what the Constitution allows.

And even though the

Court interprets the Constitution differently from another
branch, that's the judicial process.
So, separation of powers here, with the notion of
political question, whether something is committed to the
final determination of another branch, far from supporting
the President's position, demands that the Court affirm the
action that Judge Sirica has taken. This is emphatically the
province of this Court to decide.
Not to belabor the point, but perhaps the finest
chapter in the Court's recent history has come — the finest
chapters have cone in the fields of reapportionment, civil

135
rights, and the procedural rights of the criminally accused.
It would be naive to say that those were not profoundly,
politically important decisions. But they were made as
decisions of constitutional law, despite the consequences •
that political branches might face, despite the public
reaction, the Court understood its duty to interpret the
Constitutiono
That's all we ask for today.
Sirica has done.

That's all Judge

We believe he has done it correctly.

We believe the case is fully justiciable.

We believe the

principles that have been briefed by the parties support
the correctness of the decision below.

And we submit that

this Court should fully, explicitly, and decisively, and
definitively uphold Judge Sirica's decision,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERj Thank you, Mr, Lacovara,
Mr, St, Clair, you have fifteen minutes left,
SURREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D, ST, CLAIR, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT
MR, ST, CLAIRs

Thank you, Mr, Chief Justice,

Members of the Courts
In response to my brother's most recent arguments
Of course, Sawyer was an important case, with political
implications.

Of course, the other cases were, in and of

themselves, important cases, with political implications.
But this case is different, in that the decision in

136
this case will have an undeniable impact on another proceeding.
And another proceeding which the Constitution says is
essentially a political proceeding, from which the Court is
excluded.
And for this Court to be drawn into that thicket,
if I may call it that, seems to me highly inappropriate,
at least at this time.
As I indicated at the outset, the House Committee
has made certain political decisions, the President has
made certain political decisions.

They will each have to

bear the responsibility of those decisions with the American
people.
This Court should not impair, interfere with, or
otherwise participate directly or indirectly in that pro­
ceeding.

And it's inevitable that it would happen.

This

courtroom wouldn’t be full today if this were simply a suit
on a subpoena brought by the Special Prosecutor against the
President, even though that would he an important political
matter because the President is involved.
But this is important for other reasons, quite
apart from that, other reasons which, I suggest, indicate
quite clearly that this Court ought to, in its discretion and
in its judgment, stay its hand, at least until such time as
those proceedings have run their course.
Because those are political decisions being made,

137
they should not bear the burden either way of a judicial
decisione
QUESTION; Well, under that theory, all the criminal
trials that are going on should stop, then,
MRo ST. CLAIRs That would not be the first time,
Mr, Justice Douglas, that a criminal trial was delayed,
And in balancing the importance to this nation, I would
suggest that that is clearly' indicated, and I don't believe
the defendants would be crying very bitter tears.
But, in any event, the justiciability of this
case seems to me to be the single, important, obvious matter
that my brother would prefer not much to talk about, but
there can be no doubt about it if you read page 53 in his
brief, he says he, the President, is now -the subject of an
inpeachment inquiry by the Committee on the Judiciary of
the House of Representatives, and the subpoenaed evidence
may have a material bearing on whether he is ijnpeached;
and, if impeached, whether he is convicted and removed from
office.
And I suggest the Constitution and all of the
history of the Framers makes it quite clear that the Framers
conceived impeachment as a legislative process, the Court
was excluded specifically from that function,
Marbury v, Madison itself, I agree with the Chief
Justice, that it decided the case in favor of the President.

136

LO

The rule was discharged and the commission was not issued»
But it also held, and it's been the law since that
case, that the Courts will not interfere with or direct a
discretionary act on the part of the President or any other
branch of government.

And that's been confirmed in

Mississippi v. Johnson and any case since that time.
And the discretion that the Constitution, by
implication and by necessity, that has been vested in the
President in determining which of his confidential communica­
tions shall be made public or released is a discretionary
act that this Court ought not, by its decision, undertake to
do for him.

Because this Court is not equipped in knowledge,

background, and any other way, to exercise that discretion
for the. President of the United States.

139
This is not a ministerial act.
Finally, I observe a slight, but significant shift
in my brother's position with respect to the priraa facie nature
of the naming of the President as a co-conspirator.
it can be made prima facie.

They say

I take it that is by examining

the evidence before the grand jury in order to determine
whether or not that evidence in fact supports that determination.
We have invited this court and Judge Sirica to do
just that.

The Special Prosecutor has opposed in each instance

this or any other court looking behind that to see whether in
fact the evidence can be made, as he now states the position,
to support a charge of criminality.
Before the Argument, the argument was that because
it was a finding or a vote, it was prima facie.

Wow it is,

I take it, somewhat different.
But in any event, the action by a grand jury purporting
to assess criminality to a President of the United States is
a clear intrusion upon the legislative function and power
with respect to impeachment.
As I said earlier, the President is not above the
law.

Nor does he contend that he is.

What he does contend

is that as President can be applied to him in only one way,
and that is by impeachment, not by naming as a co-conspirator
in a grand jury indictment, not by indictment or in any other
way.

And therefore in this case I urge that this court take

such action as is appropriate to overrule Judge Sirica's
decision in order that this case be dismissed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. St. Clair.

Thank you, Mr. Jaworski and Mr. Lacovara.
The case is submitted.
