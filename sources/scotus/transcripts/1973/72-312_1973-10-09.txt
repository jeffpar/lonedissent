Mr, Orrick, yon may proceed whenever you are ready*
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. ORRXCK, JR*, ESQ.
MR. ORRXCK:

Mr. Chief Justice and members of t.h©

Court:
With the permission of the Court, X would Ml- to
save Ely last ten minutes for rebuttal.
This case is her® on a writ® of certiorari to the
First Appellate District of the Court of Appeal of California,
'which As cur intermediate appellate court.
if is. an action for declaratory relief and damages
which was brought in the California Superior Court, by Mr. War©
on behalf of himself and others, alleging that a forfeiture
provision in a profit sharing plan violated a California law
and was unenforceable.
Merrill Lynch answered and petitioned for arbitration,
and it did so because1 it had agreed with Merrill Lynch — with
War© that any and all disputes arising out of his employment
would be arbitrated in accordance with the rules of the Maw
York Stock Exchange.
The Judge in the Superior Court denied the petition
rind without findings and ha was affirmed by the Court of Appeals

4
notwithstanding the fact four months prior the very

sou

had held under identical facts that Merrill Lynch bad the right
to arbitrate*

That case is the Ware case, which we have in­

cluded in our Appendix and to which I shall make further refer*»

©nee*
Merrill Lynch then petitioned the Supreme Court cf
California to review these two conflicting decisions, and the.
Supreme Court denied it and w® cams here to ascertain whether
or not there isn’t a federal interest in maintaining the uniform
application of these New York Stock Exchange rules.
Mow, the pertinent facts are few and they can be
stated «imply:

Ware was employed as an account executive by

Merrill Lynch in July 1958.

Merrill Lynch is a member of the

New York Stock Exchange and, as such, it is required to abide
by its rules which incluto the fact that all account executives
must be registered representatives of the Stock Exchange.
Now, to become a registered representative of the
Stock Exchange, it is necessary for the applicant to undergo a
rigorous 26-week training course to pass an examination with
respect to both his competence and his integrity, and then be
must agree: to abide by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange,
The rss.les requiring this are set forth in the Appendix to our
brief, Rule 345 and the rules governing arbitration. Rule 34?,
is on page 9 of the Appendix.
Mr. War® did exactly this?

Be took the course, he

passed it, and he signed an agreement to abide by this rules o
the Haw York Stock Exchange.
Q

Mr. Orrick?

MR. ORRICK:
Q

The other case you refer to is Frame? and. not

MR, ORRICK:
Q

Yes, sir.

Frame, excuse me, yes, sir.

And I gather both, as I understand it, from

Division 4, is that right?
MR. ORRICK:

No, sir, they were both the same

division„
Q

In the First Appellate —

MR. ORRICK:
Q

In the First Appellate District.

And at least one judge was common to both

panels, Judge Divina?
MR. ORRICK:

That's correct, Judge Divine, yes, sir

That’s correct.
Q

They were decided just months apart?

MR. ORRICK:

Four months apart, yes, sir.

Frame then went to work as a registered represented
tive and
Q

Do you mean Ware?

MR, ORRICKs

-- in the San Francisco office of

Merrill Lynch.
Q

Ware or Frame?

MR. ORRICK:

I misspoke myself.

Thank you, Mr.

Justice.

Ware,

This is the Ware case, yes, sir.

Ha then went to work for Merrill Lynch and he became
eligible in January to become a participant in the Merrill Lynch
Profit-Sharing Plan,

New, the Merrill Lynch Profit-Sharing

Plan is a plan to which Merrill Lynch is the sols contributor.
And the purpose of -the plan is to provide an incentive for the
employee to stay with Merrill Lynch and to provide him a future,
and additional source of income.
0

You regard both of these aspects, that is the

arbitration clause and the retirement clause, as part of the
contract.ua 1 a r rangement ?
MR. 0RR1CK:

Ho, sir.

The plan specifically provides

in Article 18 that it is not to be considered part of the
contract of employment«
Q

The arbitration clause is?

MR. 0RRXCK:

The arbitration clause is.

several other very important provision,s.

Ths plan has

In section 22.1, it

provides that it shall be interpreted under the laws of New
York} and in Article 11.1, which brings about the instant law
suit, it provides that if the employee voluntarily terminates
his employment with Merrill Lynch and goes to work for a
competitor, that his rights and benefits under the plan may be
declared forfeited.
Now, to join the plan, Mr. Ware had to agree- to the
conditions of the plan, and this he did, his second agreement.

Q

Mr, Orrick, why is it important in your argument

that the contract provided it should be interpreted according
t

:he laws of New York?
MR. ORRICK:

Because what appeared to be the gravamen

of Mr. Ware's action, namely that Business and Professions Code
Section 16600, made this forfeiture clausa invalid and therefor
the choice of law, therefore that created a strong public
policy in California, which would outlaw the choice of law pro­
vision.

I don't know if I make myself clear.
Q

I don’t sea why the argument you make here about

in effect federal preemption would ~~ if they didn't prevail,
as you make them, why it would make it improper for California,
as a matter of public policy, to reject New York law?
MR. ORRICK:

Well, I don’t — I haven’t said that,

Your Honor, except I want to make this point:

The California

statute which is Business and Professions Cod©, 16600, provides
every contract by which anyone is constrained from engaging in
a lawful profession, trad© or business of any kind is to that
extent void.

That is what the statute says.

Now, the Supreme Court in this Muggill v. Reuben
Donnelley held that the application of that statute to a pro­
vision in a plan that was similar to this weald render this
forfeiture clause unenforceable in California.

However, that

statute does not mean what it says, because the Supreme Court
of California in another case, Gordon v. Landau, has said that

[i

statute will not apply in a situation where there are trade
secrets or customers lists or things of that nature involved,
and that is what wa clearly think we show here, if we get to
arbitration.

But w® ar© asking here our right to arbitrate.

We have an agreement to arbitrate with Mr. Ware, which is under
the Federal Arbitration Act, and under the State Arbitration
Act,

valid, irrevocable and enforceable; and, in addition to

that, we have —
Q

Well, certainly not enforceable under the State

Arbitration Act —
MR. ORRICK;
Q

Sir?

Certainly not enforceable under the State Arbitra­

tion Act, is it, because the California Court of Appeals ruled
against you?
MR. ORRICKs

That is why we are here.

Wa think it is

clearly enforceable under the State Arbitration Act, as it is
under the Federal Act, and we think --.otherwise, the result
would be form shopping, as the Chief Judge dealt with in the
Mowinckels Rsderi case.

But we are entitled to it under that.

In addition, Mr. Justice, we are entitled to it under the Haw
York Stock Exchange rules, particularly 347(b).
How, these rules were promulgated pursuant to section
6(c) of the Securities & Exchange Act of 1934, and they are in
this industry, the only industry of its kind, where this Court
has referred to it as the federally mandated self-regulation,

9
arbitration is a very important part of that self-regulation.
And we have here a situation involving interstate corvaercG
and we have here a situation involving the question of whether
these rules of the New York Stock Exchange will be uniformally
applied,,

If we were in New York, for example„ it would be

perfectly clear that there would be arbitration under the
rules.

So w© think we are entitled to that, to arbitrate, and

entitled both under the federal statute and under the rules of
the Stock Exchange.
Mew, Mr. Ware's -~
Q

What if the position of the Exchange rules was

contrary to the laws of Mew York?

Let's assume Maw York had

a provision like California does about arbitration, or about
this

arbitration and this restrictive agreement?
MR. ORRICK;

Well, the plan is to be interpreted

under the laws of Mew York.

Mow, if Mew York had ruled it

invalid, clearly the provision couldn't be interpreted in favor
of Merrill Lynch.
Q

Well, are you saying that it is just agreement

in the contract that invalidates the California provision?

Or

are you saying that there is a provision in the federal law
which says that the validity of the Exchange rules is to be
governed by the law of the state in which it is located?
MR. ORRICK;
0

Wail, I

And some other state attempts to invalidate what

10
is consistent with Mew York law, the federal law prevents the
California provision»
MR. ORRXCK:

Well, the federal law says, 'in section

6(c), that the stock Exchange shall adopt rules consistent with
the rules of the state in which it is located, and the .Kew York
Stock Exchange is located in New York,, and. those rules are
consonant with the laws of New York.
Q

And then you are arguing that if California

nevertheless attempts to invalidate a Stock Exchange rule,
which is consistent with the law of New York, it is the federal
law that prevents California fro® doing it?
MR. ORRXCK:
Q

I think that is •—

Is that what your argument is?

MR. ORRXCKs
Q

Well, that is right.

—- the doctrine of preemption —-

You can call it what you want, but it is a con­

flict then, isn't it?
MR. ORRXCK:

That’s quite exactly so.

How, X have

been
Q

I mean that is your argument, that it is a

conflict.
HR. ORRXCK:
0

To look at it another way, .Mr. Orrick -~

MR. ORRXCK%
0

Yes, and let me —

Yes, sir.

if I understand it, what you are really argu­

ing is that by reason of the federal statute, section

Ce5,

that

11
statute makes California X«w inapplicable to the cietorr-dnation
of this issue.

Only New York law may he tested to see whether

Sew York law or whether these regulations were inconsistent,
with Hew York law.

Isn't that if?

MR. ORRXCK:

Correct, Mr. Justice, and that now brings

me to a discussion of the California statute, Labor Code,
Section 229 —
G

If you are right about that —

MR. ORRICK: Yes, sir.
Q

— what's left of the case?

MR. ORRXCK:

Q

Arbitration.

But then you have won your case on arbitration

then.
MR. ORRXCK:
Q

Yes.

X mean, that is the only thing, the only issue

that is here?
MR. ORRXCK:
Q

Well —

The only issue that is here ie arbitration?

MR. ORRXCK:

That’s right.

And. then we go back to

arbitrate.

Q

All right.

G

Well, actually, X suppose more accurately the

issue is whether that California statute was proparly applied,
to deny arbitration.
MR. ORRXCK:

That's correct.

And there are, Mr.

Justice, there are in effect two California ctatutes hm:n. in
question.

The one —
0

Whatever they may h©„ if you are right in. your

interpretation of section Co) of the federal statute, and of the
supremacy of the federal statute as applied here* we don't have
to get into any California statute.
MR. ORRXCK:

That is correct.

May I reserve the rest of my time?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ml right,

Mr. Barton?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH C. BARTON, ESQ.
MR. BARTON:

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

X think it is important to put this case in perspec­
tive so that the Court can consider the narrow issues that arcs
presented .here.
This case is really about one-hundred or move, former
employees of Merrill Lynch who resided in California, and who
worked for their employer with integrity and with competency.
Q

In California?

MR. BARTON:

In California, Your Honor.

And who by

reason of their employment, and by reason of contributing tothe success of Merrill Lynch, are entitled to be paid their
earned wages.
Now, there is no dispute in this case that the profit

13
sharing that we are talking about is wages»
Q

This was not a contributing plan# was it?

HR. BARTON:

No, Your Honor, it was not.

X believe

Petitioner stipulated to the definition of wages as authorita­
tively construed by the California Suprema Court in the case of
Wise v. Southern Pacific.
So they are asking that they be paid their lawfully
accrued, wages.

Now, this case is not about any individuals who

have violated any rules of the New York Stock Exchange, any
regulations of the Securities 6 Exchange Commission -«•
0

How do we know that?

Is there a record of

evidence on that subject?
MR. BARTON:

The determination of the class, Your

Honor, was limited to those individuals who by reason of one
fact, they want to work for a competitor where they opened a
competing business, ware denied their profit sharing rights.
There is nothing in the case —
Q

Wall, under that, might there net be a showing

that there was the use of customer lists, et cetera?
MR. BARTON s

Your Honor, X believe that the interpre­

tation of the Business &nd Professions Code, section 15600,
forecloses that consideration, because it states on its very
fact that any restraint, there is a different sat of laws,
Your Honor, in California that apply to customer lists and con­
fidential information gained through employment.

14
0

Well, that is the question, whether a contract

clause fixing the form and calling for arbitration is valid,
isn't that what this case is all about?
MR. BARTOW;
Q

Yes, that is correct.

Or is it a question of whether it can be en­

forced against the will of the forum state?
MR. BARTOW:
Your Honor.

Ho, X don’t think that its the question,

Arbitration is not mandated by any rule of the

Securities & Exchange Commission as amicus has pointed out in
its brief , nor is it required by any
Q

»

You mean the Stock Exchange?

The Stock Exchange

or the Securities & Exchange —
MR. BARTON:

No, no, the Securities & Exchange Com­

mission, Your Honor, has filed an amicus brief in the case, and
it is their position that the rule is not required by any regu­
lation, any legislation enacted by Congress in the Securities s
Exchange Act particularly, and it is not required by any rule
or regulation promulgated by the Securities & Exchange Commis­
sion .
Q

If this action had arose in New York, I suppose

the arbitration clause would have been enforced, wouldn't it?
MR. BARTON:

Well, Your Honor is asking me a question

about New York law.
Q

Yes, I am.

MR. BARTON:

Yes, sir.

Well, according to the case

15
that I have cited In my brief —
Q

Well, 1 will ask It another way, then..

MR. BARTON:

It would not have been enforced, Your

Honor, because it concerns a matter of illegality, which is
unenforceable in the New York courts, pursuant to the decision
of the highest court, the C ourt of Appeals.
0

Well, 1 will ask you another way:

Your position

in the case is that California law governs this case as to the
enforceability of the arbitration clause?
MR. BARTON:
0

Yes, Your Honor, not federal law.

Why isn't New York law applicable?

MR. BARTON:

why isn't New York law?

Because, number

one, Your Honor, the case was submitted to the California
courts based on California law by the petitioner, and the
petitioner asked for an interpretation of the RE-1 form and
rule 347(b) —•
Q

Who brought the law suit?

MR. BARTONs
Q

Yes.

The respondents did, Your Honor.
And you base it on New York — on

California law?
MR. BARTON:

Well, the nexus of the complaint, Your

Honor, is about the forfeiture provision in the profit sharing
plan which has nothing to do with the securities business.
Q

Well, the case was decided by the court on the

basis of California law, wasn’t it?

MR. BARTON 2

Q

Correct,

The Court below applied California law?

MR. BARTON2

Yes, it did. Your Honor, as to one litti-

area.
0

Well, the area whether or not the arbitration

clause is to be enforced in this case?
MR, BARTON:

Well, that is the specific question, but

the general question --

Q

Well, 1 don’t want to go any farther than that,

MR. BARTON:
Q

Now, about the arbitration, that is —

MR* BARTON:
Q

Yes, that is correct,.

As to wage dispute.

— you say that California lew governs this, it

was held to govern this case?
MR. BARTON:

That is right. Your Honor, as to wag©

disputes, yes,
Q

Now, let's assume that the arbitration clause

was quite valid in New York.
MR. BARTON:
0

Bat's assume that it was.

MR. BARTON:
Q

Was valid in Mew York, yes, Your Honor.

All right.

Now, 6(c) says that the Stock Exchange «ay make

rules as long as they are consistent with the law of the state
in which they are incorporated.
MR. BARTON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

17
Q

Now# why should California he able uo apply its

3.aw when the federal law says the Exchange rules are to b'tested by the state#

the law or the state in which it. is

located?
MR» BARTON:

Excuse me# Your Honor.

There has boon

no definition yet in the legislative history of the Act as to
what "located” mans.

Now, X submit, Your Honor, the Hew York

Stock Exchange is physically located in Hew York.

That is

certainly —
Q

Wall, let's assume that we decided her© or some

court decided that located means for the New York Stock
Exchange, it means Hew York.
MR. BARTON2
Q

Let's assume that.

MR. BARTON:

Q

All right.

Let's assume it for purpose of section 6(c) —

MR. BARTON:
Q
York.

All right.

Yes.

• that the Stock Exchange is located in New

Then what?
MR. BARTON;

If the matter were to be decided under

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
