MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ue’ll hear arguments

first this morning in Jo. 73-831» The Warden of Lewisburg
Penitentiary against Marrero.
Mrs. LaFontant, you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JEWEL S. LAFONTANT
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER'
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the Respondent,
Marrero, who was ineligible for parole at the time he was
sentenced, may now be considered eligible for parole since
he has served more than one-third of his sentence.
Now, the sentence he is serving was passed
down under a law that has since been repealed.

The law was

repealed May 1st, 1971 and the repealing statute is called
the ''Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act.”
The Respondent was convicted by a jury in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York on two counts of receiving, concealing, facilitating
l4l grams of heroin and with purchasing, dispensing and
distributing 194 grams of cocaine.
At the time of his conviction and sentence,
people guilty of these violations were faced with a mandatory

penalty of five years, at least, in jail and under that
statute that was in existence at that time, parole was not
available, the parole that we

see under 18 USC ^1202,

Approximately one year before the passage of this
new repealing statute, the Respondent was sentenced as a
second offender and he received a sentence of ten years on
each of two counts to run concurrently.
His conviction of May 27th, 1970 was affirmed by
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and this Court denied
certiorari.

Therefore, the Respondent is serving his

sentence in the Federal Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.
On February the 2^th, 1972, a year and nine months
after his sentence. Respondent filed a petition for habeas
corpus in the United States District Court, the middle district
of Pennsylvania.

He alleged that the statute 26 USC 1737(D)

that was in effect at the time of his sentencing and under
which, as I said, he is ineligible for parole, was repealed,
lie should now be eligible for parole, having served more than
a third of his sentence.
The District Court denied the habeas corpus
petition on jurisdictional grounds but Judge Kneeland in the
District Court opinion and by way of dictum said that the new
statute did not repeal the prohibition on parole eligibility
on the ground that the prohibition was a penalty preserved by
the specific saving clauses of the provisions of Section 1103a

5
of the new act and under the general provision, saving
provision of 1 U.S.C. Section 109.
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
reversed and granted Respondent's application for habeas
corpus and directed that he be released within 60 days unless
he was given hearing.
There is a conflict in the jurisdictions through­
out this country and the court’s mandate has been stayed by
Mr. Justice Brennan's order pending this Court’s determination.
Now, at this late date, after this case was set
for argument, the Respondent, having served the Government
with a memorandum attacking the stay of the mandate issued
by Mr. Justice Brennan on October 25th, 1973, attempts to
say that Mr. Justice Brennan’s order was an abstract order
and that Mr. Justice Brennan, therefore, did a useless act.
.P

During the entire five and a half months since
the mandate was issued, not once did the Respondent raise
the ineffectiveness of the stay order.

In fact, he

recognized its validity because he attempted on two occasions
to have it vacated, but on different grounds.
Everyone else recognized the validity of that
mandate and behaved accordingly, including the District Court.
Respondent submits that Mr. Justice Brennan’s
order is useless because it doesn't contain some words that,
evidently, the Respondent believes may be magic, Some words

that Mr. Justice Harlan Issued in the Panama Canal case when
he stayed a mandate and those words were, "All further pro­
ceedings under the mandate be stayed."
We find no authority for such a construction.

Mr. Justice Brennan's stay order, which is on page 14 of the
Appendix, is as follows, and I’d like to read it to the
Court.
"It is ordered that the mandate of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Case HO.
72-1842 be and the same is hereby stayed pending the timely
filing

of a petition for writ of certiorari In the above-

entitled cause.
"Should such a petition be so timely filed, this
stay is to remain in effect pending this Court's action on
the petition.
"If the petition for writ of certiorari Is denied,
this stay is to terminate automatically.
"In the event the petition for writ of certiorari
is granted, this stay is to continue pending the sending down
of the judgment of this Court."
QUESTION:

Let's see if I understand it,

Mrs. LaFontant, the Government's position is that after the
word "mandate, : there ought to be read in, in the circumstance
of this case,

"and all proceedings thereunder."

MilS. LAFONTANT:

Yes, and —

7
QUESTION:

And that Is the gist and the whole of

it; Is it?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

That is correct, Mr. Justice

iirennan.
QUESTION:

I gather, in fact, that he has not

been released and he has not had a parole hearing.

Is that

correct?
MRS. LAFONTANT:
QUESTION:

And so he is still confined?

MRS. LAFONTANT:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

He is still incarcerated.

And the District Court has not sugges­

ted that there ought to be a parole hearing.
MRS. LAFONTANT:
QUESTION:

No, sir, not in any event.

Pending the decision here.

MRS. LAFONTANT:

That is correct.

And so I say to you that, is it not clear — I
suould ask, isn't it clear on the face of the stay order that
the intent and the effect was to preserve the status quo of
this case until a final determination was made.

We cannot

even respond and say that Respondent is urging form over
substance because the form of this stay order is certainly
more than adequate.
QUESTION:

But even if it were —
He urging form over form.

MRS. LAFONTANT:
urge form over substance.

I’d say we will

not say he can

8
QUESTION:

lie is urging form over form, is your

submission, Mrs. LaFontant.
MRS. LAPONTANT:

Yes, your Honor.

Yes,

Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

The Respondent is still in the

penitentiary, isn't he?
MRS. LAPONTANT:
Lev/isburg

The Respondent is still at

in the penitentiary.
'QUESTION:

not yet elapsed?

Because a third of his sentence has

Is that correct?

MRS. LAPONTANT.

Yes, a third of his sentence

has elapsed and he, in his habeas corpus petition, he has
set that out, that he has served more than a third of the
sentence that was given him, the ten years, and therefore that
he is eligible for parole because of the new repealing statute.
QUESTION:
eligibility for parole.

And that is a question of his
Has the parole board —

MRS. LAPONTANT.

His consideration for eligibility,

yes.
QUESTION:

Right.

Has the parole board, done

anything on this?
MRS. LAPONTANT:
QUESTION:

No, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Nothing at all.

It is just a question

of eligibility.
MRS. LAPONTANT:

Everything has been stayed and

9
remained in status quo since his incarceration.

But I’d like

to even add that even at this date if the form had to be
changed or if this Court felt that it should be changed, it
is our position that this Court could stay the mandate anew,
if it so wished.
Respondent further contends that the stay order
is of no effect since it was entered after the Court of
Appeals mandate Issued.

This, too, is without merit because

this Court, in. Carr versus Szassa

and in Aetna Casualty

and Surety Company versus Flowers, stated clearly that the
fact of the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals has
issued does not defeat this Court's jurisdiction.
Nov/, in discussing the basic issue concerning
whether or not the Respondent is eligible for consideration
for parole, 1 wish to refer briefly to the common lav/.
•_

{-if

Under the common law, when a criminal statute is
repealed by another statute or was amended so that there was
a lesser punishment, the defendant could take advantage of
that and he was entitled to the benefit of the new act unless
a specific saving clause in the new lav/ expressed legislative
intent to the contrary or if the general savings statute
contains such a provision.
Here, we not only have a specific saving clause
in 1103(a) but we also have the general saving clause,
Section 109 contained in 1 U.S.C. providing the prosecution

10

for any violation of lav; occurring prior to Hay 1st, ’71
shall not be affected by the repeal of the former drug abuse
statute .
In denying parole and probation consideration we
are helped, I believe, a lot by the case of United States
versus Bradley where the offender was sentenced after passage
of the repealing act and where this Court held that the
prohibition in the repealing statute of suspended sentences,
probation and early parole survived the repeal of the 1996
Narcotic Control Act.
However, since none of the offenders in the
Bradley case, none was eligible for consideration for parole
because they hadn't even begun to

start serving their

sentence, the issue of whether or not Section 4202 was banned
was not settled.

It was only settled that Section 4208 was —

did not ban the earlier sentences or the earlier provisions
of 1956 Drug Abuse Act.
We submit that the ban on Section 4202 parole,
like the ban on Section 4203(a) parole, certainly survives the
195b statute and v;hat the Court has before it is a relatively
straightforward question of legislative intent.
Ineligibility for consideration for parole is
covered as part of the prosecutions of the offense referred
to in the Act's saving clause and is part of the penalty for
the prior crime included in the general savings statute

and

and in Bradley

this Court ruled that the word "prosecution

i:

in the saving clause was held to include sentencing at page
611 and right! y so and we submit that it also includes the
word 11 penalty.*'
How, the Respondent in his brief at page *1 and
note 2, reference is made to the effect there that,
unfortunatelyj the Respondent does not possess a crystal ball
to know that the sentencing court intended for him to remain
in jail for more than three and a half years.
What Respondent should possess

and certainly,

What the sentencing court did possess, was knowledge that in
sentencing Respondent for ten years, he would not be freed
on parole before the mandatory release time.
When the judge entered the order and entered the
sentence of ten years, that was not only part of the
prosecution, that was part of the penalty and at that point
in time , he knew that when he sentenced the Respondent to
ten years, that the Respondent was not going to be eligible
for consideration for parole ---QUESTION;

He could have —-

MRS. LAPOMTAMT:

— that the determination was

made on the date of the sentence and of the judgment.
QUESTI Oil;

lie could have sentenced Respondent to

a longer term under the —
MRS. LAFOMTANT:

He could have sentenced, under

12
the violations at that time, he could have sentenced
Respondent to 40 years, but he cave him ten years, two ten-year
terms to run concurrently.
QUESTION:

Nhat discretion did he have in the

way of sentencing him to a shorter term?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Re had no discretion whatsoever

because under the statute at that time it was mandatory, if
he were a first offender, that you receive a

five-year terra.

If you were a second offender, it was mandatory
that you be given a minimum of ten years but you could have
been given a maximum of 40 years.
QUESTION:

He was given —

And this was a second offender?

MRS. LAFONTANT:

The Respondent here was a second

offender.
QUESTION:

And there were tx\ro counts or one?

MRS. LAFONTANT:

Two counts, one of — as I

indicated, of concealing and facilitating the heroin.

The

second count dealt with 19J! grams of cocaine.
QUESTION:

So is it correct to say that the judge

imposed the minimum permissible sentence?
MRS. LAFONTANT;

Yes, it would be correct- to say

that „
QUESTION:

So it doesn't make any difference

what the judge might have wished to have given less than
that, does it, if he didn't have power to do it?

13
MRS. LAFONTANT:

I don't think we — I am not

that concerned about what he may have wished.

I do believe

we can't say what he might have wished to have done.

All I

am saying is that, when he gave him ten years, he knew very
definitely that he was not eligible for parole, also.
QUESTION;

Well, the point of my question was,

even had the judge, perhaps, Wished to give him less than a
ten-year sentence —
MRS. LAFONTANT.
QUESTION:

He was not free to do so.
even
— he was not free to do so or/had the

judge wished to make him eligible for parole in less than a
ten-year period, he was not free to do so.
MRS. LAFONTANT:
QUESTION:

He was bound by the law —

At the time of the sentencing.

MRS. LAFONTANT:
QUESTION:

— at the time of the sentencing.

Right.

MRS. LAFONTANT;

As we contend we are still

bound by the law, no matter what the individual wish of the
particular judge or respondent might be.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Lafontant, if — as I think I

understand you — this ties into the original sentence, do we
have a jurisdictional problem here of this habeas application
was filed in the district of incarceration, not in the
original sentencing court.
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Does this make a difference?
We feel that it makes no

difference in this case, that he is. properly before the
Court in the habeas corpus petition.
QUESTION:

Even though, on your theory, he is

attacking the original sentence?
MRS. LAFONTANT:

And he is incarcerated in

Pennsylvania.
QUESTION-

Well, true enough, but I think that

hasn't — that last fact has not prevailed in some of our
jurisdictional controversies here before.
MRS. LAFONTANT:

The Government's position is

that he is properly before the Court and we have not pushed
that position but .have gotten, really, to the merits of the
case in this instance.
QUESTION:

But if it is a question of jurisdiction,

I suppose we can’t avoid it here.
MRS. LAFONTANT:

This Court, yes, your Honor.

Now, the general saving statute in Title I which
dates from 1871, it provides in very broad terms that the
repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release any
penalty, forfeiture or liability incurred under such statute
unless the repealing act expressly so provides.
Now, there has been a considerable amount of
discussion in the briefs concerning the words "penalty,
liability, and forfeiture," but in the Reisinger case in
1888 which considered that question, the Court applied the

15
statute to the criminal case where the statute has actually
been repealed before the indictment was returned and the
repealing statute itself, just as in our case, had its own
savings clause, except it was much narrower.

It applied

only by terms to saving prosecutions that have already been
commenced at the time of the repealer.
In the Re 1 singer case, it not only said that the
general savings statute with the narrower clause prevailed,
but said it could not be construed as being in conflict with
the narrower statute and they went further and said that the
words that we have been talking about, "penalty, .forfeiture,
liability," were intended to be synonymous with the word
"punishment."
We take the position that this consideration
\

'.'.44

or this denial of consideration for eligibility for parole
,

'

,:'v /

Is punishment or penalty which automatically atto.cn. upon
conviction.

It is part of the sentence.

It is part of the

prosecution and that the saving statute of Section: 109 and
the specific saving statute of 1103 prevent the offender
■from being considered for parole eligibility.
This analysis is confirmed by the legislative
history which is covered, I think very thoroughly, in our
brief.

That is the legislative history of the Narcotics

Control Act of 1956.
That history has expressed a strong Congressional

16

intent to punish narcotics pushers severely, in part by
eliminating parole as an element in punishment and this was
part of the penalty, the trafficking in narcotics.
At the 91st Congress, in Volume 116 of the
Congressional Record, at page 33650, Congressman Anderson
of California said — and I’d like to quote him — "When an
individual encourages another to

take drugs

and when an

individual sells drugs to another, he is torturing that
person and ruining that person's life and we should have no
sympathy for him.
"The penalty for the pusher should be equal to
the misery he causes his fellow man,"
The new statute substantially revised: the elements
of the narcotics offenses and the applicable penalty provisions
and its general philosophy was summarized by Congressman
Gramo in the same Congressional Record only at 33616 when he
said, "The new Bill expertly combines the weapons of law
enforcement, rehabilitation and research for a massive attack
on the drug abuse problem in the United States.

By supporting

this legislation, we will give our lav; enforcement officials
the tools they need to crack down on the organised criminals
and pushers who profit from agony and death."

■ ’

MRS. LAFONTANT:

'y

Yes, that is correct,

I am

getting to Section 848 to explain how that fits In and ties
In. with Congress' intent to severely punish the pusher.
QUESTION:

But 848 was a new provision In the '70

Act, wasn't it?
MRS, LAFONTANT:

Well, it really was the — it’s

a new provision in the '70 Act but in a sense it has retained
a lot of the old act because the punishment there is still —
In fact, the punishment under Section 848 is much more
severe because in Section 848 the penalty is i*aised for the

18
first offender from five years to ten years and the outer
limits are raised, as I recall, to life imprisonment, rather
than the other.
So Congressman Giaimo, his last sentence is,
"Yet at the same time we will recognize the fact that those
who are addicted, to

drugs are innocent victims who must be

helped and not punished.11
Under the old law, ineligibility for parole only
covered offenders involved in selling or otherwise transferring
narcotics and did not apply to the possessors or to the
individual abusers.
Now, the new act is still consistent with
Section 7237(d) in retaining the punitive approach for the
pusher in illegal drugs.

This is demonstrated by the fact

that the ban on suspended sentences, probation and parole
has been continued for persons who engage in "a continuing
criminal enterprise,11 although the Amicus brief at page 6
claims that the Government really realized the harshness of
848 and therefore, hasn't brought any indictments under that
section.

That brief is in error,

...everal prosecutions, one of which

The Government has filed
has reached appellate

level and that case is United States versus Manfred! at
488 Fed 2nd 588, where the convictions were sustained and the
constitutionality of Section 848 upheld.
It is true that there is a new flexibility in the

1971 Act but there is no Indication that that flexibility was
to have retroactive effect.
Despite the premise of Petitioner's argument that
the action taken by Congress in repealing Section 237(d) and

was not primarily an expression of a

The stated goal was much more pragmatic.

'{

several guilty people or people we might have wanted to
prosecute were not prosecuted.
So they wanted to make sure that the pusher was
prosecuted and convicted.
It is also evident from the terms of the
Congressional intenta as shown, that the no-parole position
is a penalty from the viextfpoint of the convicted defendant.
His penalty is very substantially released if he
is paroled into society and is no longer Incarcerated behind

20
steel bars.
A convicted prisoner who has been paroled
undoubtedly also believes that the parole constitutes a most
substantial release from penalty.

I think we’d be hard-

pressed to find any convict who did not view the unavailability
of his parole as a penalty.
The Sixth Circuit stated the viewpoint correctly
in Harris versus United States at 426 Fed 2nd, page 100 when
it said, "It may be legislative grace for Congress to provide
for parole, but when it expressly removes all hope of parole,
this is in the nature of an additional penalty."
Under both the old act and the new act,
Petitioner's conduct was criminal and even though there were
legislative changes made, it is our submission to 'this Court
that the old act was not repealed.

V/e submit that' the Court

of Appeals was in error when it reached the result in
holding that violations of the pre-May 1st, 1971 drug laws
are not to be punished under the pre-May

1st statute.

Our position is that at the time the crime was
committed, the law in effect controlled, that Section 1103(a)
forecloses consideration for parole eligibility under Section
4202, just as it does in 4208 and the general savings statute
of Section 109 clearly mandates that availability of parole
is foreclosed.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. WITMEYER III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. WITMEYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Having heard the Government’s argument, I believe
it is appropriate for us to step back for a moment and take
a fresh look at the question that confronts this Court today
and that question is, whether’ the Federal Government can
presently deny Mr. Marrero parole considerations under
Section 4202 of Title 18, despite the fact that the only
bar to parole eligibility x^as expressly repealed by the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970,
simply because Mr. Marrero was convicted of a pre-repeal
offense.
But if the question is stated in another fashion,
T believe that whether penal authorities can deny the 800
prisoners in Mr.

Marrero's position elgibility for partici­

pation in important rehabilitative programs provided through
parole, even though there is no rational purpose to be
served by that denial and in answering these questions, there
are, I believe, three inquiries that should be made.
First, did the 1970 Drug Control Act mark a
rejection by the Congress of its earlier approach to the

22
drug problem In this country?

And did It represent a

decision that an effective program of rehabilitation was
essential if drug abuse were to be controlled?
Second., would considering Mr. Marrero eligible for
parole effecuate that Congressional decision without at the
same time creating any difficult administrative problems?
And, third, does the language of the four
applicable statutes allow' Mr. Marrero to be considered for
parole?
Let us consider first the first question.

Uhat

did the 1970 Act signify as to Congress' plan for the drug
problem in the United States?

And I believe the answer to

that question is readily apparent from the history of the
drug problem in this country and Congress's response to it.
I think we all know that Congress first attacked
the drug problem in the early 1900's because of the wide­
spread drug abuse of the 19th century but for the purposes of
this case, perhaps the most important legislation was the
Narcotic Control Act of 1956, the statute under which
Mr. Marrero was convicted and in 1956 Congress reviewed the
then-growing drug problem in this country and It concluded it
should take a very harsh approach.
It adopted a system of mandatory minimum
sentences without possibility of parole and it decided that
severity was the key to solving the drug problem.

But as we

all know, 14 years

under the 1956 legislation saw the drug

problem in this country grow to alarming proportions and it
was obvious that the 1956 approach simply did not work.
The I960's saw the Federal Government begin a
review of what had happened with its prior efforts to control
this problem.

There were many studies undertaken, both

within and without the Government, including those of two
Presidential Commissions, the Prettyman Commission and the
Katzenbach Commission and the conclusion of those commissions
and of many others was that rehabilitation was essential to
solve the drug problem and Congress slowly began to change
its approach.
For example, in 1066, it adopted a Carcotie
Addict Rehabilitation Act to provide a method of treating
and rehabilitating narcotics addicts.
In '1968, for example, it amended the Community
Mental Health Center legislation to include treatment for
narcotics addicts in mental health centers and in 1970,
Congress embarked upon a comprehensive revision of the drug
laws of this country.
Congress had before it evidence of the need for
rehabilitation and for ameliorating the harsh penalties that
had been inflicted under prior law in order that the law
would better fit the crime and Congress also recognized that
under prior law, prosecutors had become reluctant to

prosecute and judges and juries had become reluctant to
convict.
Now, these important facts, facts which the
Government argues show that in 1970, Congress merely intended
to amend the law to make it easier to put more people in
jail, these facts actually show something much different.
They show a public consensus, including that of
the judicial process in this country, that the 1956 approach
was not the solution to the problem.

They represented public

rejection of the harsh, retributive approach and it was a
consensus so strong that I believe respect for law in this
country began to suffer as the judicial process became

unwilling to enforce the law and the 1970 Act was in response
to all of these facts.
And that was not an Act that merely amended the
Criminal Provisions Law because it also directed the develop­
ment of treatment centers and of rehabilitative programs and
it directed further studies undertaken into the drug problem
and at about the same time, Congress enacted the Drug Abuse
Ldcuation Act of 1970 and the Comprehensive Alcoholism and
Alcohol Abuse Act of 1970, all of which, when taken together,
show a complete reform of federal legislation and. the federal
approach to the drug problems in this country and the repeal
of the bar to parole shows that parole was to be an important
rehabilitative tool in implementing the new Congressional

25
approach.
Now, Congress' determination that rehabilitation
was essential to solving the drug problem is further
reflected by the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act of 1972
and that Act contains a specific Congressional finding that
the success of federal drug abuse programs and activities
requires a recognition that education, treatment, rehabili­
tation, research, training and law enforcement efforts are
all interrelated.
And I think the

answer to the first inquiry,

then, is Congress in 1970 did reject its old approach
because harsh sentences reluctantly imposed were now to be
replaced by a vigorous federal program founded upon
r e ha b Hit at ion.
The next question, then, is how would considering
the 800 prisoners in Mr. Marrero's position fit into this
new Congressional approach?

And the answer is clear that it

would help effectuate it.
A.s this Court has already recognized in
Morrisey against Brewer, parole is one of the most important
rehabilitative tools in our federal penal system and
rehabilitation is the underlying objective of the 1970 Act.
Considering Mr. Marrero for parole effectuates
that intention and. poses no problems because the parole board
has already stated in this case that it can easily handle the

26
800 applications of prisoners In Mr. Marrero's position.
In fact, the parole board routinely handles many
more applications t han that.
The board has also stated that no one would be
released on parole unless the board felt that both the needs
of society and of the individual prisoner would be served, by
doing so.
Simply stated, then, parole eligibility for
Mr. Marrero both effectuates Congress' new plan for solving
the drug abuse problem in this country and would, according to
the parole board, benefit society generally and it would also
place no burden whatsoever on the federal courts because prior
criminal proceedings would not be reopening and judicial
determinations are not required to implement parole under
T‘ "1

Section 4202.
I think, then, the answer to the second inquiry
i

is that parole is consistent with Congress' plan for solving
the drug problem and no rational purpose would be served by
denying Mr. Marrero parole considerations.
This, then, brings us to the technical, statutory
interpretation question posed by this case and I agrees that
this case is principally one of statutory interpretation.
Parole in the federal system is made available
by Section 4202 of Title 18.

Under prior law, Section 7237(d)

of the Internal Revenue Code stated that 4202 could not be

27
applied to certain prisoners and 7237(d) was specifically
repealed in 1970 by the 1970 Drug Control Act.
The statutory interpretation question is whether
that repeal was rendered ineffective as to prisoners
convicted under prior law because of two savings statutes,
Section 1103 of the 1970 Act and Section 109 of Title 1.
The correct answer, I believe, is that the ™
those statutes do not preclude parole eligibility.

In fact,

if this Court were to conclude otherwise, since no rational
purpose would be served by denying parole to the 800 persons
in Mr. Marrero's position, then if this Court held parole was
unavailable, it would be required to confront constitutional
questions.
Since there is no rational purpose to be served,
would not a denial of parole contravene equal protection
guarantees to the Fifth Amendment?

Or as the California

Supreme Court held last month in the case of In Re Foss,
is not denying parole to drug offenders a violation to the
Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that it
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment?
But I think an analysis of the saving statutes
shows that these constitutional questions need never be
reached because those statutes, when correctly construed, do
not preclude parole.
First, of course, the operation of the two

28
savings statutes must be evaluated in the light of

Congress'

overall plan in 1970 for solving the drug problem and in
accordance with a well-established rule of statutory
construction that statutes must always be construed to
effectuate remedial objectives.
The first statute, then, is Section 1103 of the
1970 Act and that was a statute designed to save prosecutions
for violations of prior law and nothing more.
Now, this Court has already construed Section
1103 last term in the case of Bradley against the United
States and there this Court said that the word "prosecution1'
as used in 1103 is to be defined by its ordinary legal usage
and I think, as is clear from this Court’s decision in
Morrissey against Brewer, the parole process is not part of
a prosecution in the ordinary legal sense but in Bradley this
Court was confronted with the question of where Congress
intended to draw the line in not changing the operation of
prior law and. it concluded that the word "prosecution" as
us^d in Section 1103 precluded a trial court from granting
probation or from accelerating a parole eligibility date but
this Court specifically pointed out that parole under 4202 was
a very different thing and. Respondent submits that those
differences require that Mr. Marrero be considered eligible
for parole.
QUESTION:

Do you think that our decision in

29
Bradley about the factors considered there raises the same
sort of constitutional questions that you say would be raised
by a denial of parole eligibility here?
MR. VJITMEYER:

Well, your Honor, I believe the

similar questions are raised except there was a rational
purpose to be served by the

construction adopted by this

Court in Bradley because I believe it was rational to
conclude that Congress did not intend that the 1970 Act
either reopen prior criminal proceedings or that it would
treat unequally persons convicted of violations of prior law.
And if either of those — or if this Court had
allowed a trial court to place a prisoner on probation or
had allowed a trial court to decide whether to accelerate his
parole eligibility date, then either prisoners convicted of
violating prior law would have had their eligibility for
probation or the question of whether their parole, eligibility
date could be accelerated turn on a fortuitous circumstance,
whether

or not they were sentenced before or after May 1,

1971.
But the alternative would have been for all prior
criminal proceedings to have been reopened, not

only placing

an undue burden on the courts but also, in the face of the
probation statute and the statute allowing acceleration of
parole which states that those determinations must be made
at the time of sentencing.

30

I think that those reasons gave a rational
justification for this Court's interpretation in hradley but
none of those reasons is present here today

in a case

involving Section 4202.
Parole under 4202 simply creates no administrative
problems whatsoever.
QUESTION:

In Bradley, I take it the Court looked

on ineligibility for parole as part of the sentence.
MR. V/ITMEYER:

No, your Honor, I think not.

The

question in Bradley was Section 4208 and that concerns a
trial court's acceleration of the parole eligibility date.
QUESTION:

Well, the

trial court's acceleration

of it was — under Bradley, the trial court could not do
that.

Well, I am just saying the reason the

trial court didn’t have this power was because under the
prior law he didn't have that power.
MR. WITMEYER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

And he didn't have power to interfere

with any eligibility of parole or to grant eligibility for

31
parole where

it wasn’t present before.
MR. WITMEYER:

the parole process, you Honor.

Under 4208 the trial judge

is granted by Section

MR. WITMEYER:

Your Honor, I believe what this

Court said was, those decisions of the trial court which were
made at the time of sentencing and therefore were essentially
part of the sentencing process were caught by the word
"prosecution'1 as used in 1103.
QUESTION:

And his ineligibility for parole was

part of that and the trial court couldn't interfere with it,
MR. WITMEYER:

Your Honor, again, I think now

because what this Court said was, the trial court could not -QUESTION:

Well, I agree with you that it .said,

it was leaving the question open.
MR. WITMEYER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But I couldn’t be right — I couldn't

be wholly right.
MR. WITMEYER:

‘Well, your Honor, I think perhaps

the problem is that the Government's argument and the argu­
ment your Honor is directing himself to is that the word
■'prosecution" may preclude parole because the date of parole

eligibility depends on the length of sentence and sentences
set by a trial court and I

guess that would be the essence

of the Government’s argument as to v;hat prosecution catches
parole ineligibility.
Biit I think the relationship of parole under *4202,
his sentence is only incidental.

It exists only because

Congress elected to use the length of sentence as one of the
criteria determining whether a prisoner should be released on
parole.

I believe that eligibility for parole itself is a

creature of statute created by the Congress,

Parole is

determined by an administrative body and whether one is
eligible for parole is a question only of a person’s status.
Under the lav/s of the United States it does not involve an
exercise of judicial discretion by a trial court in making
any specific determination.
I believe, then, the fact is that the word
"prosecution" does not preclude parole eligibility and that
Section 7237(d) is not saved by 1103 and that conclusion
effectuates the rehabilitative purpose intended by Congress
in enacting the ■—
QUESTION:

On this rehabilitative purpose, is

this a pursuer or an addict?
MR, VJTTMEYER:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I —

I can’t find it in the record.

MR. V/ITMEYER:

It is not in the record.

33
QUESTION:

It is not in there.

MR. WITMEYER:

I do not know.

Where is it?
I think the

Government, however, in stating the 1970 law Intended to
punish pushers and to continue the punitive approach,
mischaracterizes what Congress intended.
QUESTION:

So I understand you’d make the sam§ if

he was a plain pusher, you'd make the same argument?
MR. WITMEYER:

Yes, your Honor, because Congress

the Government’s argument with respect to Congressional
intent rests largely on Section 848.
QUESTION:

How do you rehabilitate a pusher?

MR. WITMEYER:
QUESTION:

Your Honor?

I’m sorry?

How do you rehabilitate a pusher?

MR. WITMEYER:

Your Honor, the penal authorities

have many programs including those of parole where prisoners
are placed in supervised environments, are given jobs, are
given training.

The parole board Is the board which

evaluates whether these programs would be effective in
adapting a prisoner to fit back into society.
Now, I’m not going to infringe my view on their
judgment because I have never been involved in the parole
process.

But I think it is recognized as principle of

penology that mose prisoners can be rehabilitated if they
are placed in the proper environment to do so and the paroleboard. is one of the important mechanisms for accomplishing

QUESTION:

Well, Is this latest act aimed at

rehabilitating pushers?
MR. WITMEYER:
QUESTION:
addicts.

Your Honor, I think it is.

As I read it, it is rehabilitating

Am I wrong?
MR. WITMEYER:

Your Honor, it is very hard to

say what the word "pusher" means.
QUESTION:

The only case —

A pusher is a man that sells dope ’Who

does not use dope.
MR. WITMEYER:
clearly intends

Well, then, I think the statute

that many of them be rehabilitated, your

Honor, because the statute —
QUESTION:

I thought it was addicts.

MR. WITMEYER:

It is aimed at addicts and. users

and I think also pushers unless they are in a supervisory
position over more than five persons.
QUESTION:

Now, where in there can 'you show me

anything about pushers?
MR. WITMEYER:

Your Honor, the only thing in the
■i

statute —
QUESTION:

Well, you said it Is there.

MR. 'WITMEYER:
which

Where?

It is by virtue of Section 848

bars parole in one very limited instance, namely, a

person who supervises five or more others in the sale of drug

35
and derives substantial income from them.
QUESTION:

Other persons?

MR. WITMEYER:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor, that is correct.

And you said that that shows that it

was made to rehabilitate pushers.
MR. WITMEYER:

It was made to rehabilitate the

individual who sells drugs, either because he is a user or
because he is an addict or because he is Impoverished and he
is selling to a small group of people and he is the kind of
person whom hopefully society can salvage and make a useful
person again, yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Was this man in that category?

He

sold quite a bit,
MR. WITMEYER:

Your Honor, I don’t know.

There

are no facts in the record on this case and I am not familiar
with

Mr. Marrero personally to be able to find out.
QUESTION:

I read it someplace in this case.

MR. WIMEYER:

Me was apprehended, according to

the Second Circuit opinion, on a roof of a building in West
Harlem, New York in which they found drugs and he was the
owner of the apartment.

Beyond that, I don’t know specifi­

cally what he has ever done.
QUESTION:
conviction.

Sometimes it is reflected by his prior

That sheds some light, doesn’t it?
MR. WITMEYER:

He was convicted in one other

36
instance of possessing drugs, yes, your Honor.

It doesn’t

say whether he is a user or an addict or a pusher.

I really

don’t know.
QUESTION:

But the quantities give some bite to —

MR.. WITMEYER:

That he probably was selling them,

yes, your Honor.
Your Honor, I think the one remaining question
facing us then today is Section 109 of Title 1 which is the
general federal saving statute but I think before considering
the operation

of Section 109, it is necessary to determine

whether it should be applied at all in this case and I believe
the answer is, 109 should not be applied for two reasons.
First, Section 109, originally enacted in 1871,
was intended only to obviate the need for including a specific
savings clause in every repealing statute in order to preclude
what are called "common law technical abatements."
... ..

'

■

I think it is evident from the history of the
18,71 Act that that act was not intended to substantially
change the law or to erect substantial impediments to
effectuating remedial statutes and in this case., the 1970
Drug Control Act has its own savings clause, Section 1103,

and 1103 is specifically limited to prosecutions and nothing
more and 1103 encompasses all violations of prior law.
If 109 covers more than 1103, then these two
statutes are clearly in conflict and 1103, as the latest

37
expression of the legislative rule, should prevail.
Second, allowing parole eligibility is not the
consequence of a technical abatement , as the terra was used
at common law.
And since, I believe, the purpose of 109 is to
prevent technical abatements, applying 109 to preclude
parole eligibility would not effectuate its purpose and for
these reasons, 109 should not be applied at all.
But even if this Court does decide to reach the
question of the actual operation of 109, the conclusion still
is that it does not preclude parole eligibility.
The effect of Section 109 in this case depends
upon the meaning of two words used in that statute.
"prosecution.

One is

The other is "penalty."

Since

prosecution" as used in Section 1103 does

not preclude parole, then as used in 109, It should not do
so either.
The question, then, is the meaning of the word
penalty" as used in 109 and I believe there are three
reasons why the term "penalty" does not bar parole.
First, Section 109 is written in two parallel
clauses.

One refers to sustaining prosecutions and the other

to releasing or extinguishing penalties.
These two clauses were clearly written in
parallel and therefore should be construed consistent with

38
each others each thus saving the same kinds of things.
If prosecution does not bar parole, then neither
does penalty.
Second, in a criminal case, as five circuits have
already decided, I believe, the v;ord "penalty" as used in
109 should be interpreted to mean the imposed sentence of the
trial court.

and release on parole would not even affect an imposed
•
sentence and consequently, for that reason also, the term

restraints imposed upon convicts under federal law and no

from the effect of 109.

: 4|

The answer to the third inquiry, then,;, .1 think is
that the language of the applicable statutes permits parole
eligibility and the conclusion is, then, that the technical
and, I believe, purposeless construction urged by the
Government ought to be rejected because Congress has now
designed a comprehensive plan for attacking the drug problem
in the country and rehabilitative programs are the corner­
stones of the Congressional plan.
Considering Mr. Marrero and the 800 other

39
prisoners in his position, eligible for participation in the
important rehabilitative programs that parole provides, helps
effectuate Congress' plan for solving the drug problem in
this country and there is simply no justification for
abandoning these 800 prisoners, for condemning them to serve
their terms without access to important rehabilitative programs
and for frustrating the basic purpose of the 1970 Act.
For this Court to exclude Mr. Marrero from
parole consideration would be for it to adopt a vindictive
approach to the drug problem, an approach which Congress has
rejected and which cannot be justified.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Witmeyer.
Do you have anything further, Mrs. Lafontant?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JEWEL S. LAFONTANT
MRS. LAFONTANT:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
I’d like to respond briefly to Mr. Justice
Marshall's question as to whether or not the Respondent is
considered a pusher or whether he was an addict.
From the record it is shown that he was not an
addict because he attempted to obtain sentence under NARA,
the Narcotics Addiction Rehabilitation Act and he was denied
that because there was no proof that he was an addict.
lie came to the judge and said, I'm an addict and

40
1 want to be sentenced under NARA but that was denied so
there was no proof that he was an addict.
In addition, at the trial level, there was some
evidence Introduced that the Respondent's apartment was
used to cut the dope into whatever size was necessary and
that several others would come there to get their share and
that dope was sold.
There is no proof in the record at all that the
Respondent was an addict, although he asked for treatment
under NARA and that was denied.
Also, as to the statistics about 800 or more
inmates.

There are only 489 inmates presently incarcerated

who have served one-third of their term.

We have a total of

734, however, who are in custody under the old act, but only
489 have served a third of their term.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr, Witmeyer.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:12 o’clock a.m., the case
was submitted.]
