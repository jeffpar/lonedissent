PROCE E DI N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-5280, Prince Eric Fuller versus Oregon.
Mr. Kuhn, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MARVIN KUHN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KUHN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Petitioner in this case entered a plea of guilty
to the charge of sodomy in Multnomah County, was placed on a
term of five years' probation and as a condition of the
probation, was ordered to reimburse the county for the cost
of his court-appointed attorney fees as well as the total of
$375 for the cost of the investigator hired by his courtappointed attorney.
Petitioner believes that these conditions of
probation, of reimbursement, deny him due process as well
as equal protection and are an impermissable burden upon his
right to counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth
Amendment s.
Now, Petitioner believes that this condition of
probation, that he repay his court-appointed attorney's fees,
are an impediment to the free exercise of his right to counsel
as guaranteed by this Court in Gideon versus Waim-right and
recently reinforced in Argersinger versus Hamlin.

The

4
Oregon practice which is beginning now — this is one of the
first cases — will have the effect of placing a financial
penalty upon those indigents who need legal help but cannot
afford to retain their own counsel.
Now, this issue recently was decided by the
Supreme Court in the State of California in the case of
In re Allen.
Now, the California Supreme Court held that the
same type condition of probation as we have here was
unconstitutional because it would place an impermissible burden
upon the Petitioner's right to counsel in that case.
The California court reasoned that even though
there was no indication there that the Petitioner had been
denied her

right to counsel since she actually was repre­

sented by court-appointed counsel, that the record did not
show that she was ever advised of this potential liability as
to the repayment and reimbursement to the county for the cost
of this counsel.
Petitioner submits that such advice Is also
absent in the present record that we have here.
The California court also felt that if the
Petitioner had had knowledge that she may have to repay the
costs of her court-appointed counsel, and as tne knowledge
of this potential burden spreads, that it could very well
chill future indigents from exercising their Sixth Amendment

right to counsel rather than risking having to repay them as
a condition of the probation, should they be fortunate
enough to receive probation.
QUESTION:

Does the record have any empirical

evidence on that fact, Mr. Kuhn?
MR. KUIIN;

The — our record has none at all.

There was the — the defendant or the petitioner In this
case, there is nothing to indicate he was ever advised that
he would have to repay counsel until such time as the
conditions of probation were imposed at the sentencing.
QUESTION:

Well, was this speculation on the

part of the California court, then, in the Allen case?
MR. KUHN:

This was in the Allen case, yes,

QUESTION:

Was it speculation on the part of

MR. KUHN:

It was and it was based upon that,

your Honor.

the court?

that it would be a chilling effect.

There was — I saw no

empirical evidence in the Allen case indicating that this
would be so, but I did have the feeling that under California
practice, such would be the case.
QUESTION:

Well, except I gather, under our

cases, the criminal trials could not proceed without counsel
to represent the accused.
MR. KUHN:

Counsel can be waived, your Honor, yes,

6
assuming there is full advice as to the right to counsel,
counsel may be waived.
QUESTION:

Mow —
What if a man says on arraignment,

"I've got $50,000 in the bank, but I'll be damned if I’ll
use it to hire a lawyer with."

Do you think, under the United

States Constitution, a trial court is obligated to appoint
counsel for him?
MR. KUHN:

No, I do not, your Honor.

I believe

that the cases — the Gideon cases, all the subsequent cases
indicate that the man cannot afford counsel.
In that case where the man has indicated he does
have sufficient funds to retain counsel but he will not do
it, then I do not believe the Constitution requires counsel
to be appointed for him.

I believe that the thrust of

Gideon, Argersinger are to the effect that an indigent, a man
who cannot afford counsel or where

it would work, a hardship

upon him has a right to appointed counsel but under no other
conditions.
Now, it is this chilling effect, the possible
limiting of the right to counsel, that the Petitioner
believes is at issue here and is the main issue.
Mow, this is assuming that he is told by the
court prior to appointment of counsel that should he be
convicted and placed on probation, that he will —• he perhaps
may have this obligation to repay the cost of court“appointed

7
counsel.

This is one provision that is not currently done

in Oregon practice today.
QUESTION:
your Oregon statute?

Mr. Kuhn, suppose you didn’t have
Could a court on its own impose this

as a condition of probation?
MR. KUHN:

I believe that without the statute,

under the decisions of Oregon, I believe that it could as
an inherent power of the sentencing court.
QUESTION:

Well, is it your position, then, that

a court must in every case prior to trial advise counsel as
a possibility

as to what it might do?

MR. KUHN:

Yes, your Honor, it Is my opinion

that should this Court — I beg your pardon, your Honor?
QUESTION:

Even without the presence of your

MR. KUHN:

Yes, your Honor, I believe that as

statute?

long as the petitioner or defendant is subject to the
criminal statutes of repayment as a condition of probation,
that in order to fully insure an understanding as to his
right to counsel, that at the time, the court must Inform
him of this possible liability.
QUESTION:

Let me start over again.

I am

assuming Oregon does not have this kind of a statute, as
most states do not and then I thought I asked you whether
a court on its own could impose this as a condition of

8
probation, and I thought you said yes.
MR. KUHN:

Oh, I'm sorry, your Honor, I thought

that perhaps you meant whether Oregon had a statute that
specifically allowed this as a condition of probation.
I do believe that the court could impose this
condition without such a statute in Oregon.
QUESTION:

And then my next question xvas, then

must the court in every criminal case so advise the defendant?
MR. KUHN:

Yes, my answer is the same.

If the

indigent appears without counsel and at the time advice of
counsel is given, this possibility should be explained to him.
QUESTION:

And if he does not, then the condition

may not be imposed?
MR. KUHN:

That is our position, yes.

However,

I believe that even if counsel — if it is explained to him
that the condition itself is an impediment to the free
exercise of the right.
QUESTION:

Would you say how often the condition

should be imposed?
MR. KUHN:

This is perhaps — this is the first

case I have heard about in Oregon, your Honor, this one here.
Subsequent to this, I am aware of the practice being carried
on in Washington County, Oregon and in Lane County, Oregon,
QUESTION:

Every case?
»

MR. KUHN:

Not in every case, no, your Honor.

9
QUESTION:

What are the criteria which determine

whether it shall be imposed?
MR. KUHN:

That, I am not clear on.

I would

assume it is on the — depending upon each individual
defendant that appears before the court at the time of
sentencing and agreed amount as to what appears in the pre­
sentence report.
QUESTION:

And does the practice differ among

Yes, it does, your Honor.

court costs that may be imposed on a convicted defendant under
the Oregon statute,

in addition to counsel?

MR. KUHN:

In addition to counsel, I believe

tnat the statute is worded to the effect that costs cannot
include those costs that are inherent in a affording the
defendant his rights to jury trial, such as

subpoenas, jury

fees, fees and costs of the district attorney are not
included.

It is more of a statute of exclusion, I believe,

rather than inclusion.

Honor, if expert investigators are hired, such as here, as
Judge Forte pointed out in his dissenting opinion, he, the
defendant, may become liable for that also.
In response to the former question, this Is a
case in Douglas County now.
As to the cost of the psychiatrist, the cost of
the Investigator, these may all become conditions of reim­
bursement and made conditions of probation.
Now, the possibility of this chilling effect, I
believe that the —■
QUESTION:

Well, of course, in those cases, you

don’t have the argumentive burden on assistance of counsel,
do you?
MR. KUHN:

Not as to the Sixth Amendment right to

counsel, no, your Honor.
QUESTION:

What, then, would — or do you make any

point of those?
MR. KUHN:

I believe for such as that, it may be

an impingement on his right to jury trial as guaranteed by
the Sixth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Including reimbursement of

obtained these witnesses in order to present a complete

11
defense, then I believe that it would Impinge on his right to
trial by jury.
QUESTION:

But suppose he were to have a jury-

waived trial?
MR. KUHN:

I believe that it would be the same,

since the right to trial by jury has, as I understand it,
includes the right to put on a defense, whether or not it is
before a jury or before the court who becomes the tryer of
fact.
Now, it is this possible chilling effect here
that I believe the Oregon court's opinion did not recognize,
as the court held that the defendant is given counsel when
he needs it but petitioner believes that this does not
answer the question since It is the possible chilling effect
and of those possible Indigents who

just won't accept counsel

if they are made aware of the fact that they may have to
repay the county and then this repayment then becomes a
condition of probation.
As Mr. Chief Justice Burger indicated in the
concurring opinion in Argersinger versus Hamlin, representa­
tion by counsel is desirable In criminal cases from both
the viewpoint of the defendant and society.

The defendant

would submit here that the Oregon practice injures not only
the particular indigent facing the criminal trial, of which
he is presumed to be innocent, but of society as a whole

12
because if such a condition, as v;e believe it does, discourages
counsel to those who need it most, when they need it, the
entire judicial framework within which society lives, the
defendant believes is weakened.
Now, this possible chilling effect was noted by
the American Bar Association project on providing defense
services in which they pointed out that the practice would
discourage the acceptance of counsel in their opinions and
recommended that reimbursement for providing counsel should
not be required except on the ground where fraud is

used in

obtaining court-appointed counsel or in presenting indigency
to the court.
QUESTION:

What sort of sanctions attach under

Oregon lav; to the failure of a defendant who is required to
pay counsel fees?

What is it, citation for contempt if he

fails to do it?
MR. KUHN:

The recoupment statute indicates

that he may be cited for contempt.
QUESTION:

Is it a defense on his part in the

contempt hearing that he is unable to do it, like, for
instance, a contempt hearing on a support order in a
matrimonial case?
MR. KUHN:

Nov;,

that would be a defense.

in a contempt hearing, I believe

However, here, where it is a

condition of probation, under the Oregon statute 137.550,

13
when it is made a condition of probation, he does face the
possibility of being sent to prison for the failure to pay.
The Oregon Court of Appeals, in its opinion —
majority opinion —
QUESTION:

They cancel

probation.

MR. KUHN:

I beg your pardon, your Honor?

QUESTION:

Because they cancel probation.

MR. KUHN:

Yes, your Honor, as he did not live

up to the term of probation of repayment, he therefore may
have his probation revoked and be sent to prison.
QUESTION:

Do we know anything about the position

of the Oregon law as to whether if, on a probation revocation
hearing, he were to say, I simply am not able to make the
payment whether they would nonetheless revoke his probation?
MR. KUHN:

The Oregon Court of Appeals In the

opinion In this case indicated that pursuant to the statute
a defendant may not be revoked unless the court finds he is
unable to pay and that he did not pay as a result of an
Intentional contumacious default.
In other words — or, if the court finds he had
the ability to pay and he didn’t pay, Intentionally, then he
could be revoked.

Without those two findings, according to

the majority opinion, he could not be revoked.
However, the --QUESTION:

Well, how about that?

Do you accept

that?

MR. KUHN:

No, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Don’t we accept that, though, as an

MR. KUHN:
this case.

Yes, your Honor.

Hotvever, that is

That was the majority opinion in this case.
QUESTION:

If a person knows that he is not going

to have to pay as a condition of probation unless he has the
money and deliberately refuses to pay, is that much of a
deterrent?

Is it much of a drag on the right to counsel?
MR. KUHN:

I believe it is.

It is the risk,

your Honor, as to trying to separate the revocation from the
original advice as to the rights of counsel.

In the Initial

stages, the damaging part of this condition of probation, in
my opinion, is that at the time, even Is an indigent decides
or is told he may Incur another debt — now, that

he hears and at that time, if he says — If he believes, in
his own mind that, this id going to burden me with another
debt that I may have to pay on time and because of that if
he then gives up his right to counsel, then this is the
chilling effect and this, I believe, is the infringement on
the constitutional right.
QUESTION:

It chills it.

How can you assume that the average

Indigent criminal fears another debt?

felt that Tire had to advise them that at the time, subsequent
to the conclusion of the appeal, that we would file a cost
bill as to our costs pursuant to the Oregon law that they
would then, perhaps, become a lien and they would be
required to pay and have given up.
QUESTION:

A lien?

Well, how many of your

clients in the penitentiary know what a lien is?
MR. KUHN:

Quite a few.

QUESTION:

MR. KUHN:

16
Now, although this Court did not reach this
issue in James versus Strange, it has held that an individual
cannot be penalized for exercising a constitutional right and
penalty as defined by Malloy versus Hogan is any

sanction

that makes the assertion of the privilege costly and Petitioner
submits that this would be very costly and one of the most
costly things I could think of if he did waive the right to
counsel in order to avoid further debt.
The court has protected the Fifth Amendment right
in United States versus Jackson, Gardner versus Broderick,
and Sanitation Men Association versus the Commissioner.

The

latter case is holding that the petitioners could not be
dismissed from their positions for asserting their Fifth
Amendment rights against self-incrimination.
We submit that the right to counsel is as
fundamental a constitutional right as the right to silence
protected under the Fifth Amendment.
Now, I think the position was succinctly stated
by Judge Forte, who dissented in the instant case when he
indicated that if an accused is represented by courtappointed counsel and does avail himself of the procedures,
such as calling witnesses or calling an investigator or
other experts to present a defense and loses, he faces a
double prospect for having, in good faith, utilized the
adversary system of repayment of a debt and possible

17
imprisonment for

failure to repay.

Now, the Petitioner also submits that the
condition of probation denies him equal protection.

The

Oregon court distinguished the Oregon recruitment statutes
from the one condemned in James versus Strange because the
Oregon statute did not contain within it a denial of the
exeptions from execution afforded to other judgment debtors.
However, as Judge Forte indicated in his
dissenting opinion, there is nothing to support such a
construction , as there is nothing in ORS 161.675 paragraph
2 or ORS 137.550 that affords a defendant in a revocation
proceedings the same exemptions provided other Oregon
judgment debtors as appears in chapter 23 of the Oregon
revised statutes.
For this reason, Judge Forte and Petitioner
believes that the Oregon statute is essentially ho different
from the statute condemned in James versus Strange.
Another difference is that the Kansas statute
was civil in nature.

The Oregon statute, as applied as a

condition of probation, is part of the criminal procedure
and that, as an effect of this, that an indigent whose
probation is revoked, is, in effect, being punished for a
debt owed to the state and it does create a gulf between the
man with money and the man without money.
Now, even though the court of appeals did hold

18
that a probationer in Oregon could not be imprisoned for the
failure to pay unless the default was intentional.
The court, when it made that statement, did not
attempt to distinguish the Oregon statute from the Kansas
statute there as nothing was said about the petitioner being
able to claim his exemptions in a revocation hearing, the
same as other judgment debtors are allowed to do so in
Oregon in civil proceedings against them.
Nov;, for this reason, Petitioner believes that
Oregon law discriminates against those convicted indigent
defendants who are placed on probation.
Nov;, it does not apply to any other convicted
indigents who are sentenced to the penitentiary and for this
reason, Petitioner submits that it does not make sense to
carve a class out of a class, such as convicted indigents
carved out of that class, a class of convicted indigents who
are put on probation and apply the condition

and requirement

that they repay against them only when, as a matter of
practice, I have been unable to find any case where a man
sentenced to the penitentiary has, in fact, been sentenced to
pay and required to pay the cost of his court-appointed
attorney, although he- is assessed other costs, I have found
no case that indicates that he has been required to repay
the cost of his court-appointed attorney's fees, as only
probationers are now required to do in Oregon.

19
QUESTION:

Mr. Kuhn, I think you told us that,

first of all, the statute by its terms is permissive.
authorizes the judge to do this.

It

It doesn’t require him to.

MR. KUHN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

And you told us that there is a good

deal of variation in various —
MR. KUHN:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

— courts in Oregon, depending upon

a particular judge and, I suppose. In any court, upon the
particular case.
MR. KUHN:

Yes, I believe that is the reason.

QUESTION:

My brother Blackmun asked you this

question, but I would like to floow it up.

Do you suppose

that even in the total absence of this statute, wouldn't
it arguably be a permissible condition of probation to
require that the convicted person put on probation should
repay the court-appointed lawyer to the extent that he
could, when he could?
Certainly, It is a very usual thing to require
the as a condition of probation reparation for the victim,
for example, is it not?
MR. KUHN:

Yes, it is, your Honor.

I believe

there is a difference between reparation to the victim —
QUESTION:

I appreciate that they are not

exactly the same and that is the reason that I am asking

20

the question.
Generally speaking, all kinds of conditions can
be imposed on probation, can they not?
MR. KUHN:

Yes, they may, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Staying away from various people,

staying away from various places, getting a steady job.
MR. KUHN:

Under our statute, it does indicate

without the recoupment statute, I believe, that the court
would still be authorized to impose such a condition of
probation.
QUESTION:

You mean, any court, anywhere?

MR. KUHN:

Yes, your Honor.

QUESTION:

Unless there were a specific statutory

provision against it.
MR. KUHN:

I believe they would be.

I believe

that this would be inherent In the power of the court —
QUESTION:

As a condition of probation.

MR. KUHN:

Yes, your Honor, assuming it was not

an impermissible burden.
QUESTION:

So this statute really doesn’t have

much to do with it, it is ju3t whether or not it is a valid
condition.
MR. KUHN:

Yes, your Honor, that is the main Issue,

I believe, here, is whether or not this condition of
probation is valid.

It is our main position, naturally, that

21
it Is not because It is an unnecessary Infringement upon the
right to counsel.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. MICHAEL GILLETTE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. GILLETTE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
A number of questions from the Court today have
raised the essential issues in the case and I should like, if
I may, to simply refer back to those questions and deal with
the approach that the State of Oregon would like to take with
regard to those questions.
First of all, with regard to the chilling effect
question, the question was raised by Mr. Justice Blackmun
as to whether or not in any case, In any jurisdiction, a
judge could impose a condition such as the one imposed on
Prince Eric Fuller in this case and we would submit that,
with the exception of California, which apparently has
decided in In re Allen that you can’t do that, the answer Is
probably yes In most jurisdictions.

Certainly, I would

believe it is yes in Oregon and, in fact, there is, in the
Federal District Court in Oregon at this time another case,
Washington versus Music, which has been stayed pending the
result in this case, where the judge purported to make
exactly this condition of probation based upon his inherent

22

power and not upon any statutory power.
QUESTION:

That was a federal decision?

MR. GILLETTE:
QUESTION:

No.

No.

MR. GILLETTE:

It is a district judge in a

county in northern- Oregon.

His explanation of why he imposed

the condition was that he believed that he had the inherent
power to do it.
QUESTION:

But he also had the statute.

MR. GILLETTE:
didn’t even know about.

He also had the statute which he
That's what happened.

other respects is similar to this one.

The case in

It would appear that

the defendants in fact, was capable of paying but I want to
point out to the Court that the

way attorneys are

appointed in these situations is usually — usually arises
as a result of a relatively summary proceeding.
An Individual is brought before an arraigning
magistrate and the first concern of the magistrate Is that
the Individual be advised that he has been charged with
criminal offense and, secondly, to determine whether or not
the Individual has counsel and since usually he does not,
In Oregon or, for that matter, almost anywhere else, the
next inquiry Is, can you afford one?
And the answer frequently is not a simple yes or
no.

The answer is "I don't know," because the individual

23
may be for the first time encountering the question of
whether or not he can afford counsel.
The court will, in most Instances, err on the
side of appointing an attorney rather than let the
defendant go without counsel any longer and I would submit
tht that is definitely the best choice.

The individual needs

help then and the court, in a rather summary fasion, is
going to get him a lawyer unless the court is convinced that
he can get his own.
Now, it may turn out, subsequently —
QUESTION:

This happens when, at the initial

appearance?
MR. GILLETTE:

At the initial arraignment, the

Initial appearance, that's right.

This usually, although

not always, usually arises because the individual was
arrested without a warrant pursuant to having been arrested
on probable cause.
QUESTION:

How soon after the arrest does this

usually take place in Oregon?
MR. GILLETTE:

Well, the decision on his release

has to be made within 36 hours.

It could take as long as

tvxo and a half days for the arraignment to occur if he is
arrested on a Friday night and he is not arraigned till
Monday morning.
The difference between the release decision and

24
the attorney decision is simply based upon the fact we haven’t
quite caught up procedurally in the latter matter with the
former.

I would expect that xvithin two years or so we are

going to get to the point where we arraign every day, no
matter whether it is a weekend or not.

That certainly is

desirable.
QUESTION:

An arraignment is not the same as an

initial appearance, Is it? 1
MR. GILLETTE:

Not always, no.

Usually it Is

because the way we process things, if an Individual has been
arrested even on probable cause, an information of felony
or an Information of misdemeanor, the charging document has
been prepared by the time he appears in court, even If it is
a matter of three or four hours.
QUESTION:

That is an information.

You don't

have indictments out there?
MR. GILLETTE:
speaking, the individual

We have Indictments, but normally
who has been arrested Is appearing

before an Inferior magistrate at that time and the grand
jury hasn’t had time to proceed yet.
We have a bifurcated system in which the
individual gets arraigned, gets a chance for a preliminary
hearing —
QUESTION:
j ury.

And then Is bound over to the grand

25
MR. GILLETTE:
grand jury, that is right.

And then is bound over to the
So he gets — in fact, he gets

attorneys appointed twice if he goes through that process.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. GILLETTE:

The same one is normally appointed

the second time around but the concern is always, does he
have a lawyer?

If he hasn't, let's get him one because we

want to get on with the rest of the procedure.
Now, the question was raised by Mr. Justice
Brennan as to which counties follow this practice in Oregon
and to what extent and because no one had ever tried to
figure this out, I conducted what is, unfortunately, a most
informal poll, but
page 30.

it appears in addendum to my brief at

It indicates that the majority of counties are

utilizing the practice, although to a limited extent, I
think the largest amount collected during calendar year 1973
was $9,220.

That is a fairly sensible figure in view of the

fact that it is seldom going to happen that an individual
who is genuinely indigent at the time he seeks counsel
improves upon his conditions by the time he is found guilty
of the charge.
QUESTION:

How do they fix the amount?

This

was $350 here, was it, or something?
MR. GILLETTE:

$375 as investigator's fees and

I cannot for the moment remember what the record discloses as

26
to the attorney’s fees.

Part of the problem here is that the

decision to pay them was made on an informal basis outside the
courtroom door.

The defendant’s father actually paid the

money because the defendant’s father was very wealthy and had
flown out from Philadelphia and suddenly become concerned with
his son’s affairs, finally, after he had been arrested, and,
on a delayed basis, retained the lawyer and paid him so we
have a less then perfect fact situation in that regard, anyway.
QUESTION:

Well, in those other cases where the

condition has been imposed/ was there any — Is there any
criterion by which they fix the amount?

MR. GILLETTE:

Yes, sir, there is.

First of all,

there is a statutory scheme which sets forth the minimum fee
and that is usually the maximum fee, as it turns out.

It

is usually the fee paid.
In extraordinary cases the judge will, upon a
proper showing by affidavit from the attorney, grant certain
additional amounts, but it is rare that he does it.
QUESTION:

Does it depend, for example, on

whether there is a guilty plea or whether there is a trial and
how long a trial it Is?
MR. GILLETTE:

That is right.

The statute

itemizes the various dispositions that may be made and sets
forth the fees that are to be paid
very low.

in each case.

They are

It would be hard to make a living on them, at least.

27
QUESTION:

Mr. Gillete, in your addendum, I

noticed that for Multnomah County, which I assume is by far
the most populous county In the state, the answer is yes,
they do utilize this system but there is nobody making
payment and there has been nothing collected in 1973.

Is

there anything peculiar about Multnomah?
MR. GILLETTE:

The peculiarity in Multnomah

County is that they wouldn't talk to me.

They said yes we

are doing it but we don’t have the statistics and we are
too busy to give them to you.
QUESTION:

Well, that Is the metropolitan part

of the state, isn't it?
MR. GILLETTE:
QUESTION:

That is right.

That is Portland.

So they probably have more things to

do, more Important things to do than trying to enforce this
statute.
MR. GILLETTE:

My experience has been that that, at

least, is their judgment, yes, sir.
QUESTION:

Then the number zero under the number

of individuals presently making payment really means that
you don't know the ansxver.
MR. GILLETTE:

That is right.

That Is right.

should have explained that, I think, In the Addendum.
QUESTION:

MR. GILLETTE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Which I take it is a positive answer.

MR. GILLETTE:

That is right.

We got an answer

specifically to that question.
QUESTION:

Did you say that $9,000-some was

the total amount collected in the whole state in one year?
MR. GILLETTE:

No, $9,220 was the total amount

collected in Clackamas County, which is a bedroom county
adjacent to Multnomah County based upon, I think, 30 or 40
individuals paying and that was the largest amount that was
reported to us.

I necessarily conducted this survey over a

brief period of time.

I suspect however this case turns

out that Oregon Law Review will finally find out what the
true facts are and publish an article on it.
QUESTION:

Do you know how long this practice

has been followed?
MR. GILLETTE:

It has been going on sporadically

for perhaps the last eight or ten years, but it is rare.
QUESTION:

How old is the statute?

MR. GILLETTE:

I think It was passed in 1961.

But the practice has been relatively rare because,
as I say, while the judges may not have uniformly followed
the fuller interpretation which wa3 placed on the statute
by the court of appeals, and may not have always limited
themselves to those Individuals who, in fact, really were not

29
Indigent in making the requirement, at least now, where the
court of appeals has affirmatively said, that is what they
must find, that the man really is not indigent and that he
can make a payment without hardship either to himself or to
his family, the amount recovered is going to be limited.
QUESTION:

Did Gideon persuade them to pass this

statute?
MR. GILLETTE:

I don’t know.

I wasn't at all

involved in the matter at that time and I have no idea what
they had in mind.
QUESTION:

Well, this is certainly a very

narrowing construction of this statute by the Supreme Court,
is it not?
MR. GILLETTE:

I think it is fair to say that the

court of appeals believed that if the statute couldn't
survive constitutional muster under this construction, you
couldn’t write one that provided recoupment.

So we believe.

I hesitate to make a statement quite that hyperbolic but I
think it comes close to

that.

The court was concerned to say what was being
done and so they limited it as much as they could.
In examining this Court's decisions in Rinaldi
'

l

versus Yeager and in the Strange case, it was clear that this
Court was going to examine not just the face of the statute,
but the way it was applied and so the Court wanted to be sure,

30

absolutely sures that the

formula of words used In the

statute wasn't just given lip service that, in fact, the
person tfho was required, to make these payments was
affirmatively not indigent, in fact, was capable of making
the payments and, in fact, even saying that he is nonindigent may be inaccurate because whatever indigency is,
the ability to make a payment without hardship to ones’ self
or to one’s family is probably a financial condition better
than not being indigent.
QUESTION:

Have you had any

experience,

Mr. Solicitor General, actually, since Fuller was decided
how, what kind of hearings a sentencing judge has before
making these determinations?
MR. GILLETTE:
to 'find out.
question.

No, I have not had the’ opportunity

This is the one record I have seen on the

I have encountered one case under an.older statute

where — with regard to something Mr. Kuhn said, —■ where the
statute provided that a losing appellate would have costs
on appeal assessed against him.
. ,r ■

We had a situation there where an individual
had costs assessed against him in what appeared t'o be an
unfair situation.

That statute was never challenged and,

frankly, I think was unconstitutional because it applied to
individuals who obviously could not have paid and, in fact,
were incarcerated.

But the legislature had a good chance to

31
repeal it before we were faced with trying to corae up with
a construction that would have saved it and the particular
case that gave rise to this information which occurred about
a month ago, I think we got resolved by simply pointing out
that it wasn't fair.
But I have not had an opportunity to see a
hearing under this new procedure.
going to be very many.
QUESTION:

I don't think there are

This condition is rarely imposed.
Do you think judges will just give up?

MR. GILLETTE:

No, I don’t think there are going

to be many hearings, at least with regard to revocation,
under this situation because in some respects this is the
easiest condition to meet.
If an individual is really determined to survive
on probation, rather than have it revoked, he is going to
meet this, if anything.

It is the easiest affirmative index

to give to the court that he is meeting the terms of
probation, and so we are confident that it is going to work
in those few Instances in which it is applied*
Now, Justice Rehnqulst asked about sanctions and
the answer* to that I think was fairly well covered..

The

sanction is contempt and the sanction applies not just to
individuals placed on probation.

The sanction speaks to all

convicted individuals who have this condition imposed upon
them.

32
Now, Mr. Kuhn has suggested this has never
happened with respect to a penitentiary inmate.
statistics to show that one way or another.

We have no

Practically

speaking, however, I suspect that is true not because the
courts as a matter of practice are trying to distinguish
between those who are placed on probation and those who are
not, but simply because people who go to jail, by and large,
have even less chance to improve on their original condition
of indigency than do those who remain outside and, in fact,
one of the reasons, sometimes, that an individual is granted
px-obation in addition to other considerations is the fact
that he has got a job.

He is maintaining the job and he is

caring for his family and he has shown in other ways that he
is a contributing citizen, whatever his particular offense
may have been.
So I think the reasons for that distinction, if,
in fact, they are accurately portrayed, and I am willing to
concede that they probably are, are reasons which arise out of
the particular concern involved and there is really no way
ever to get around that kind of problem.
QUESTION:

Would it be fair to say that this

statute will have almost no application except in a situation
Where a defendant, an accused, comes in with a —- whether we
call it plea

negotiation or plea discussion, whatever it is,

there is presented to the court the idea that the man will

33
enter a plea of guilty if he receives probation and that the
probation is urged because he has a good job with a sub­
stantial income and a family and then the court would say,
I'll accept the plea and grant probation provided you pay
$25 a month until the total cost

of your defense is made up.”

Something like that?

MR. GILLETTE:
follow that.

I am not 3ure I can say it will arise in a case
QUESTION:

And only that.

MR. GILLETTE:
will

I am not sure I xuould say — I

— that is that limited but they

be nearly so limited —
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. GILLETTE:

— simply because of the nature of

the condition that the Fuller decision places on imposing
that requirement.
Part of the reason I hesitate on that is
because judges rarely, in Oregon, want to list any
recomm endation with regard to sentence and that is not part
of plea negotiation, normally, with the exception of one
county.

D.A.'s don’t make such recommendations anV judges

would not listen if they did, regarding that as their province
and not the District Attorney's.
QUESTION:

That might come in from the defendant,

however, with the District Attorney taking no position at all.
MR. GILLETTE:

That happens.

That is right.

34
Mow3 with regard, if I may, to the equal
protection question, counsel has urged this Court -— as it
was urged upon the Oregon court

that James versus Strange

is applicable here because the Oregon statute, just like the
Kansas statute, in some way affirmatively denies to
individuals subjected to this condition, those exemptions
which are granted to other judgment debtors.
In practice, that just is not so.

The court of

appeals decision specifically say3 that is not so.

It says

these people are entitled to the same exemptions everybody
else is.
I think it

I've set forth the statutory scheme in my brief and
shows that those exemptions are afforded in the

same way they are afforded to every other judgment debtor.
So I would submit that if that ground in James
versus Strange, was the full reason this Court felt, in
Strange, to strike that statute, then James versu- Strange
is just not in point at all in this litigation.
Now, I see from my notes that I have covered the
other particular points that I wanted to mention to the
Court.
Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has other
questions, I am finished.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Solicitor General.
Do you have anything further, Mr. Kuhn?

35
MR. KUHN:

Nothing further3 your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

the case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:55 o’clock p.m., the case
was submitted.]
