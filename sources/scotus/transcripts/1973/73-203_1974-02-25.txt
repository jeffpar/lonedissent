PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments next in No. 73-203, Morton Eisen against Carlisle
and Jacquelin.
Mr. Fine, I think you may proceed whenever you
are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. FINE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. FINE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is before the Court on a writ

of

certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
to review its decision dismissing the action as a class
action.
The grant of certiorari requested the parties
to brief and argue, in addition to the questions presented,
the question of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.
The other questions include the manageability of
the large class action, who must be given notice, who should
pay for the notice and the scope of discretion of the
District Court.
Turning first to the jurisdiction of the Court
of Appeals, jurisdiction was asserted on two grounds.

First

of all, the Court, in 1968, and reversing the District Court,
said that it retains jurisdiction and, secondly, the

4
Defendants say that it has jurisdictions anyway, under

the

Collateral Order Doctrine.
Originallys jurisdiction was assumed in the
Court of Appeals under what became known as the "Death Knell
Doctrine" when the class action in the first instance was
dismissed by Judge Tyler ‘in the District Court

and on the

Plaintiff's appeal, the Court of Appeals held that to dismiss
the class action and, in effect, bring it to an end, the class
would never get any chance of review.
Now, if the Death Knell Doctrine, if incorrectly
decided, later when the case was decided on the merits by the
Court of Appeals in what became known as Eisen II, when it
said, "We retain jurisdiction," it would, obviously, have
had no jurisdiction to retain.

The Defendants concede that.

We, however, adhere to our view originally
expressed in our position to their petition for certiorari
before this Court when the Death Knell Doctrine came up for
review and that petition was denied, that it was soundly
decided by the Second Circuit.
Nov/, it has been considerably eroded since then.
For example, the Third Circuit in Hackett against General
Host Corporation rejected it entirely.

But what happened in

Hackett, I think, shows how wise the Second Circuit was in
adopting the Death Knell Doctrine because after Hackett
refused to hear the appeal in that consumer antitrust case

5
brought by and on behalf of purchasers of bread following
the conviction for price-fixing in the Philadelphia area.
The case was dropped by the Plaintiff because
it couldn’t proceed without having a class action to support
it and, consequently, the question of the class never got to
be reviewed.
Our submission is different.

We submit that,

xtfhile the Court of Appeals said, in reversing the District
Court, when the District Court dismissed the class action,
that it retained jurisdiction.
What it actually did was to relinquish
jurisdiction because it reversed.

This is unlike cases

where a court of appeals may remand the record for further
findings because the record before it is insufficient to
enable it to render its decision and, meanwhile, no decision
is rendered.
Here a decision was rendered so that the court
said it retained jurisdiction but it really didn't.
In fact, the Defendants were so confused about
their role that when they came up before the Court of
Appeals for the final time, this time trying to reverse the
District Court because the District Court had sustained the
class action in every respect, they didn't know who they
were, and they designated themselves as "Appellees,
though they had lost.

even

6
So there is a complete paradox and anomaly in
the Court of Appeals having rendered its decision saying, in
fact, that it retained it.
Turning to the Collateral Order Doctrine under
Cohen, that has no application for a number of reasons.
First of all, the class action determination is,
in the language of Cohen,''but a step toward final judgment
in which it will merge."

Rule 23(c) prescribes that judgment

will be entered for or against the class, as the Court
recently noted in its opinion in American Pipe against the
State of Utah and it is a step which has to be taken in
every class action because under Rule 23 (cl), the
is

Court

required, as soon as practicable after the class action

is brought, to make the class action determination.
QUESTION:

What you are saying, Is there any

suggestion or are you suggesting that a circumstance can
arise where the determination of the District Court on the
class action is unreviewable because of the way it is moved
back and forth between the District Court and the Court of
Appeals?
MR. FINE:

I think it is unreviewable at this

stage of the case and as a matter of fact, the Court of
Appeals reached out to decide all sorts of questions that
were only tentatively decided by the District Court that
were not right for decision and that should have awaited a

7
complete record in the District Court in the same way as
many decisions of the District Court are not reviewable in
initial stages of the case and, in any event, as
Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out in his concurrence in the
State of Utah case, Rule 23 specifically provides that the
order of the District Court sustaining the class or even
denying the class may be altered or amended prior to
decision on the merits and Judge Powell, in fact, said, in
his opinion in which he was reversed here, that the response
to the kind of notice that he had ordered might prompt him
to change his mind and disallow the class so that this is
the kind of order that Cohen certainly doesn't contemplate
will be reviewed now because it might be changed.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pine, was Cohen the basis for the

Court of Appeals holding in Eisen I that it had jurisdiction
to review Judge Tyler's original order?
MR. PINE:

Yes, your Honor, Cohen and Gillespie
in effect,
they held there that this was/something that would
irreparably harm the class because this was the only way the
class could get review.
It's like a case where an attachment is released
and unless there is immediate review, the object of the
attachment may be gone.
But here, the converse is that the Defendants
preserve their right to review which the Plaintiff didn't have

8
in Cohen and wouldn’t have had, if the Death Knell Doctrine
had not been applied.

The Defendants at the end of this

case, when judgment is entered, will have the right to review
on all of these questions and at that point it could very
well be that Judge

Tyler will have modified his order

or

will have reduced the class, might have eliminated the class
entirely, changed it in many possible ways.
QUESTION:

What about the payment of the order

requiring payment of costs or notice?
MR. PINE:

Well, that Is no different, your

Honor, from discovery orders, for example in TWA against
Hughes, the Defendant there was ordered to comply with
discovery, which the Defendant said would cost, in the
petition for certiorari filed in this Court, $5 million but
nevertheless, the discovery order, as all discovery orders
are held to be, was held to be interlocutory and not
appealable.
QUESTION:

Do you think that is quite the same

as requiring the Defendant to advance the costs for notice?
MR. FINE:

I think it is, your Honor, because

the rule doesn’t impose the burden of costs on the Plaintiff.
It says, ''The Court shall direct notice to the class," and so
it obviously, unless the Court is the one that is supposed to
pay for notice under that specific language, it obviously
gives the Court the power to decide who should pay for the

9
notice and here, just like in a case

where the Defendant

may be subjected to the cost in preparing to try an antitrust
case, have to pay for the transcript, have to pay for
discovery, but under the antitrust laws, the Plaintiff
isn't required and cannot be required to put up any security
for those costs.
The Defendant there, as the Defendant here, has to
look to whatever judgment is entered at the end of the case
in its favor — if such a judgment is entered — and
collecting that judgment, if it gets a judgment for costs.
QUESTION:

Your security for costs, Mr. Pine,

is traditionally when the costs are taxed at the end of the
case is really expenditures that you have incurred to your
own travel or your own pay to a court reporter.

You may be

able to tax against the opposite party, but It strikes me
that there is something to what the Chief Justice says.

This

is not quite the same thing as that.
MR. PINE:

Well, your Honor, I think there are

some instances, for example, where a master is appointed
and the parties are required to advance the expenses of the
master before the end of the case and there may be a division,
I think, under the equity powers under Rule 5^(b) to
allocate those costs.
But in any event, just this is no different from
the discovery cases from the standpoint of finality on

10

appeal because you may recall that Hickman versus Taylor
came before this

Court because Mr. Fortinbore, the

Philadelphia lawyer, who was asserting the privilege against
producing his work-product papers there, had to undergo a
citation for contempt before he could get review.
We are not at this stage in this case.

The

Defendants have not said whether they will comply with the
order or they won't comply with the order and, certainly,
this is no different from the discovery cases.
For example, United States versus IBM, which is
before you on petition for certiorari, until the Defendants
have taken some irrevocable step with respect to the order
of the District Court, suppose they say, "We won't put up the
costs"?

Well, there are all sorts of alternatives.
They might be held in contempt, in which case,

depending, I suppose, on whether it is civil or criminal
contempt under the IBM case, they might have a right to
review.
On the other hand, the Court might say, "Well,
if they won't put up the costs, we are going to say that this
would have the effect of a Rule 23 class action even without
notice to the class for certain results.
For

example, for binding the Defendants as

against the prospect of Walmly intervention and so on so that
this is no different, certainly, from the discovery cases,

11

even if it were thought to be slightly different from the
standpoint of the Defendants advancing costs at this point,
from the standpoint of finality.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fine, what if we not only agree

with you, but went further and came to the conclusion at this
late date that the

Death Knell Doctrine, as developed in the

Second Circuit is wholly inappropriate and improper and that
there was no right to appeal whatsoever in Eisen I from the
District Court’s first disposition of this case?
What would be the result?

Would this move us

all back to square one, do you think?

MR. FINE:

I doubt it, your Honor.

I think it

would move us back to the District Court and under his
powers expressly given under Rule 23, Judge Tyler, hopefully,
would then say that he was wrong the first time, he was
right the second time, and would reinstate his second
decision upholding the class.
. \

QUESTION:

Well, yes, but what you would have,

then, is his first decision and with an opportunity for you
to try to convince him that he was wrong.

MR. FINE:

I think that’s —

QUESTION:

Having erased everything that the

Court of Appeals has done in the meantime.
MR. FINE:

Is that right?

That’s right.

Nov/, I would like to point to another

12

distinction in Cojhen.
of a statute.

That involved the general applicability

The question in Cohen as phrased by another

panel of the Second Circuit in the Weight Watchers case a was
whether a decision will settle a point once for all, as it
did in Cohen, or will open the way to a flood of appeals
concerning the propriety of a District Court’s ruling on the
facts of a particular suit.
Nows the Court of Appeals here has held that in
some cases, costs can be imposed on the Defendant, cases
where they may have a duty — for example, a corporation’s
duty to its stockholders.

But here, the Court of Appeals has

said that in some cases the District Court may impose costs
and in others, particularly in this case, that it is
inappropriate.
So what they are really, doing is interfering with
the District Court’s discretion depending on how they view the
facts of a particular case.
Furthermore, turning, really, not to the question
of appealability but advancing somewhat to the question of
the propriety of putting the costs on the Defense, here the
District Court found — and these findings were not upset by
the Court of Appeals because the Court simply said the
District Court did not have jurisdiction to make them, that
the New York Stock Exchange had violated its duty under the
Exchange Act to protect the odd-lot investors who are the

13
class In this case and the violation of that duty In which it
was aided and abetted by the other defendants certainly is no
different from the kind of duty, or no less in scope, than
the duty which the Court of Appeals said could be the basis
for putting costs on the defendants in another kind of case.
So for that reason, Cohen doesn't apply because
this is really a decision on a case-by-case basis and many
district courts have routinely, since Rule 23 was amended,
allocated the costs between the parties without any thought
that they were doing anything wrong.

And the Court of

Appeals here says in some cases they should be able to do
that so that I submit that a general rule which this Court
would be asked to apply that in no case can costs be
allocated, should not be adopted and since the question of
a general rule is not involved, the Defendants had no right
of appeal.
Now, turning to the issue of manageability —
QUESTION:

Just before we leave that —

MR. FINE:

Yes?

QUESTION:

— question of appealability, I

understand that the Death Knell Doctrine was originally
developed in the Second Circuit and is adhered to there,
that it has been given some sort of halfway recognition in
the Ninth Circuit, but explicitly disagreed with in the
Third Circuit and what is the other?

What is the state of

14
the law In the other circuits?
MR. PINE:
recognized.

I think in the Fifth Circuit it is

I believe there are a number of cases in the

Fifth Circuit where it has been recognized but I think that
the two circuits which have definitely ruled on it —
QUESTION:

You mean, the Second and the Third.

MR. FINE:

— for and against, are the Second

and Third, yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Umn hmn.

MR. FINE:

On the issue of manageability, it is

not an issue at all on class actions maintained under 23(b)
(l)or(2.) which would be, for example, actions for an
accounting for a trust fund or, here, an action for
injunctive relief.
The Second Circuit just summarily, in its first
decision, where it reversed dismissal of the class action,
said that this can't be a (b)(2)action because the advisory
committee note says that doesn't apply to situations
exclusively or predominately for the recovery of damages.
Now, this case isn't exclusively or predominately
for the recovery of damages.

This case seeks and has sought

from the very first in the complaint requests, very sub­
stantial injunctive relief.
For example, the SEC Special Study of the
Odd-lot markets, which was the basis, really, of this case,

15
found that an engineering firm, Ibasco, had concluded in
1955 that very large cost savings could be put into effect
if the odd-lot defendants automated their operations and
Judge Tyler found, in July of 1972 that as of that date,
those recommendations had not only not been implemented,
they hadn't even been considered, so there is still a
substantial need for injunctive relief here to reduce the
cost of the odd-lot defendants because, as the Court found,
reduction of those costs would necessarily have a beneficial
result for the class because it would mean that the odd-lot
differential, which is the basis of this case, had charged
that it was inflated and fixed in violation of the antitrust
laws, would necessarily be affected and reduced.
Yet the Court of Appeals ruled out a (b)(2)
action as a matter of law but manageability enters into the
rule only under (b)(3) actions, those that are what were
formerly known as "spurious class actions," but since your
decision in the Utah case, are known as "truly representative
suits," like all of the others.
And manageability in (b)(3) actions, under the
language of the rule, is only one fact to be considered in
deciding whether the class action is superior to other
available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication
of the controversy.
Now, here, the Court of Appeals said, both in

16
the Death Knell opinion and in the second opinion, that the
class action was the only feasible method for adjudicating
this controversy because the individual class members, like
Eisen, have such small stakes that they are not going to come
forward with individual suits and yet, having held twice that
this is the only feasible method and the rule saying that
manageability is only to be considered in the light of
whether the class action is superior to other available
methods, the Court of Appeals dismisses the class action.
Aside from the language of the rule itself,
however, the difficulties of

management which the Court of

Appeals perceived in this action, are just not so.
First of all, it didn't even consider what the
Rule specifically provides and that is, that you can have a
class action on the common question of liability.

That

part of the class action is certainly sound.
But here the

District Court also found that

gross damages can be determined on the basis of a common
formula and estimated for the entire class.
As a matter of fact, the odd-lot defendants know
exactly what they charged to the class as a whole because
the charge was their income and if the District Court is
right that a formula can be adopted, then we know what part
of that total charge, that aggregate charge, was an over­
charge .

I

17
Now, certainly, as to the tx^o million and a
quarter class

members whose individual transactions, the

defendants stipulated, are recorded on computer tapes and
can be derived from those computer tapes, constituting 56
percent of the transactions of the class as a whole, what is
the difficulty in managing that if you have a formula that
you can apply across the boards?
This is no different from the utility cases where
refunds are routinely ordered when some rate is found to have
been too high and, in fact, in the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline
case, the Court pointed out that refunds were made to over a
million ultimate consumers with reasonable promptness and
without serious controversy under the supervision of a master.
Similarly, in the Illinois Bell Telephone case,
In the days when people had to copy records like Bob Cratchett
sitting on a stool before the days of the computer, refunds
were made of $17 million to over a million people entitled to
the refunds.
So, if you have a formula, there is really no
great problem in managing, especially with the assistance of
data processing and from personal experience I know that
these burdens do not fall necessarily on the Court.

They are

assumed by counsel, by accountants and by data processing
firms and here, you have two and a quarter million class
members who stand to receive and recover a tangible amount

18
without undue difficulties of management, but they have been
put out of court because the Court of Appeals erroneously
concluded and held that Judge Tyler had said that the only
way that this class could be managed would be by the so-called
"fluid recovery," that is, the future reduction of the oddlot differential.
QUESTION:
matter, you say these

Mr. Pine, as a procedural, practical
burdens are largely assumed by

accounting firms or data
compensated?

processing firms.

How are they

Prior to final judgment or afterwards?
MR. PINE:

It comes up in two contexts, first

in the settlement or after final judgment.
Now, in a settlement context, they are usually
compensated out of the fund.

If it comes up after the final

judgment, then the Defendants, under such decisions of
this Court as Mills against the Electric Auto-Lite Company,
are liable for the costs.
QUESTION:

Then you don't have to worry about it

until either you have agreed on a settlement or until after
final judgment?
MR, PINE:

That is right.

That only comes up

at the time of distribution, which is after settlement or
judgment.
Now, it is true that the Plaintiff's counsel
suggested in the District Court that if six million class

19
members had to go through their ancient records — and he
said, in that narrow sense it would be impracticable, so he
suggested what became known as the "fluid class recovery,"
that is, equitable relief,

fashioning a remedy for future

reduction of the odd-lot differential and that would benefit,
certainly, odd-lot investors as a whole and those who over­
lapped the class who had paid the overcharge during the
period in suit.
The District Court didn’t adopt that, saying only
it merited consideration, that individual claims could be
satisfied to the extent filed, but the fluid class recovery
might then be appropriate for distribution of the unclaimed
remainders.
And if you have the formula kind of distribution
for those whose identities are on tape, then you may even be
able to cut out a large part of the claims procedure.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pine, you said the District

Court hasn’t taken the position as to what would be done
with the unclaimed remainder.

What would you suggest be

done with it?
MR. FINE:

Well, I think there are many

alternatives, your Honor.

First of all, the Defendants could

say it should go back to them and they will have the
opportunity to argue that after Judgment is entered, as the
Rule contemplates, for the total amount of damages for the

20

class as a

whole.
Secondly, It could be applied to reduce the odd-

lot differential in the future.

It could be done under the

general equity powers of the Court, which it certainly has
under Case against Borak to fashion any remedy to make the
Securities Act effective, and that is the kind of thing that
was done in the Bebchlclc case.
QUESTION:

But Bebchick was quite a different

kind of a case, wasn’t it?
MR. PINE:

It wasn’t a class action.

It wasn't a class action, but you

have class actions where the same approach was taken.

The

Metro Homes case in Michigan was a class action where there
had been an illegal exaction of a tax then held to be
unlawful and there the Court upheld that the taxing authority
had to pay over the entire amount and couldn't get back any
part of the amount illegally collected, even though
individuals didn't come forward to consume the entire
amount.
So that what I am saying is that, although
Bebchick was a different case, it provides part of the
substantive law, the equitable principles on which the
Court can rely in fashioning a remedy;whether the action is
a class action or not a class action, it really makes no
difference.
Further, Mr. Justice Powell, to make another

21
answer to your question, suppose notice goes out to the
two million and then there is a judgment of liability and
a fund is created, they can then be told you have a refund
due to you and the same notice can be published for those
who can’t be identified, assuming they will read the notice,
and if you like, you can assign your claim for the benefit of
future odd-lot investors.
That is exactly the kind of thing that was
approved by the Second Circuit in the Pfizer case.
So there are all sorts of possibilities, but,
certainly, at this point we don't have to go into them
because that —
QUESTION:

What you are saying is, you are saying

that somebody has such a small claim that he won't bother to
file at all.

If that is so, just his silence is rather an

insecure, insubstantial way of saying that he has waived his
claim.
MR. PINE:

Well, people with small claims —

QUESTION:

Or that he has made an assignment to

MR. PINE:

That is just one of the possibilities

somebody.

to be considered and I have had experience in class actions
where people with claims of as much as $10 in a class where
some people had claims of thousands of dollars, the
Plumbing Fixtures antitrust case, pursued their claims for

22
the $10 just as diligently as those with the bigger claims.
It meant a lot to them and just because these claims are
small doesn’t mean that it doesn’t mean a lot to these
investors.
As a matter of fact, these Defendants have
taken full-page ads saying, they are addressed to the odd-lot
investors as the ’’little guys."

These are the little guys,

the people who do not have, by and large, enough money to
invest very much and so these small amounts do mean a lot
to them.
But in any event, that is all tentative and not
necessarily to be decided and, certainly, not to be ruled
out by the Court of Appeals on a sort of advisory opinion
basis.
Now, turning to individual notice, it is not
required in (b)(2) actions for an injunction and under the
decisions like Hansberry and Lee and Ben-Hur against Cauble,
adequacy of representation is the hallmark of due process
in class actions, not individual notice.
For example, those precluded by the judgment in
Ben-Hur never had notice of the prior class action which
precluded them.
Under (b)(2), individual notice is not
required by the rule and the Defendants concede it.
Now, under 23(c), the Court is directed to

23

direct the members the best notice practicable under the
circumstances, including individual notice to all members
who can be identified through reasonable effort.
It does not mandate individual notice where it is
not practicable or where identification entails more than a
reasonable effort and here the Court of Appeals, in effect,
held that the claims of the silent members of the class
are more theoretic than real.

They are not going to want to

have an opportunity to opt out to conduct their own
litigation.

They are going to rely on the class and the

results of the class so that the kind of notice ordered by
the District Court here certainly conforms to a language of
the rule which is the rule of reason, that it is the best
notice practicable under the circumstances because to have a
requirement of any other kind of notice in a case where the
class consists of small claimants would mean that the class
action rule could never be used if you had a stringent
notice requirement to protect their interests.
QUESTION:

Does the Court of Appeals look at

this case as a (c)?
MR. FINE:

(b)(3) action —

QUESTION:

(b)(3).

MR. FINE:

-- with the kind of notice required

of (b)(3) actions, has to be given.
QUESTION:

Now —

What about (b)(2)?

24
MR. PINE:

Well, It could be looked [at] as a

(b)(2) action, and there are -QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals says it wasn’t.

MR. PINE:

It says It wasn't.

I say it was.

I

say it is (b)(2) and (b)(3) and where it is hybrid, that is,
where it -—
QUESTION:

You'd say it is (b)(1), wouldn't you?

MR. PINE:

(b)(1).

QUESTION:

But the Court of Appeals didn’t —

MR. FINE:

It said no, no (b)(1), either.

QUESTION::

Let us assume it is either (1) or (2)

Where it Is hybrid ■—

but it is (3).
MR. FINE

Well, then there are —

QUESTION

Then what about the notice requirement?

MR. PINE

There are a number of decisions that

say, if it can be viewed as (b)(1) or (b)(2), view it as
(b)(1) or (b)(2) even if it is

also

(b)(3).

QUESTION::

I understand, but let us assume that

MR. PINE::

It is not?

QUESTION::

Let's assume you must look at it as

it is not?

a (b)(3).

Then what about the notice?
MR. PINE::

That is a (b)(3) action.

Then the

question is what reasonable notice,within the intendment of
the rule, and what are the interests to be servied by notice?

25
Now, one of the interests to be served by
individual —
QUESTION:

Doesn’t the rule just say that you

serve notice — or what?
MR. FINE:

No, no.

No, no.

It says, "The Court

shall direct to the members of teh class the best notice
practicable under the circumstances," and in Mullane, this
case has —
QUESTION:

It goes on.

It says —

MR. FINE:

Well, it says, "Including Individual

notice to all members who can be identified through
reasonable effort."
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. FINE:

But —

QUESTION:

How do you read that?

The Court of

Appeals read that as the kind of notice that must go in
any event.
MR. FINE:

Yes, whatever the effort and whatever

the circumstances.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. FINE:

First of all, we say, "The best

notice as practicable under the circumstances" qualifies
the rest of the Rule but on the record here, even if it
does not, the Defendants' evidence was that generating the
individual names and addresses could be very laborious.

The

26
witnesses so testified, very expensive, certainly beyond
any reasonable effort on the Plaintiff’s

part and they

offered to furnish the names and addresses, undertaking an
unreasonable effort, only to make the Plaintiff pay for
individual notice.
In other words, they were trying to get the key
to their own salvation by saying, "Well, we don’t care what
the effort, we'll generate these names and addresses and
that will be

the end of the case."
So that if you simply take the second part of

the rule, I submit that it really doesn't require individual
notice in this case and the best notice practicable under
the circumstances of this case is exactly the kind of
notice that the District Court ordered and this isn’t a case
like Mullane or Schroeder» where individual notice was really
important at that stage of the case because persons were
about to be deprived of their property interests.
Here in Eisen what is involved at this point is
the effort to create a common fund and later, when the fund
is created, notice will go out to everyone who can be
individually identified because then they will have a stake
in what is done with the distribution of the fund.
QUESTION:

Well, there is a very specific purpose

for a (c)(2) notice, though, Mr. Pine, isn’t there?

And

that is to give the member of the class an opportunity to

27
opt out, as it is put.

That's right, but —

MR. PINE:

QUESTION:

— and It is quite unlike (b)(1) or

(b)(2) — (b)(2), which is primarily an injunctive action.
MR. FINE:

But you still have to look at the

purpose to be served by the notice when It talks in terms of
the best notice practicable under the circumstances.
The Advisory Committee note says that in many
cases, the interests of the class members to whom that notice
would be directed are more —
QUESTION:

Mr. Pine, what if you lose your case?

MR. PINE:

Well --

QUESTION:

When you talk about a fund and "once

we win the case," then you can give people notice, what if
you lose?

The people you didn't give notice to are burned.
MR. PINE:

That is right, but the Court of

Appeals found that their interests, because their claims are
so small, are more theoretic than practical, anyway.

They

would not bring individual suits any more than Eisen could
bring an individual suit without the class.
QUESTION:

And yet you say their interests are

substantial enough that their failure to respond should be

28
interpreted as a waiver, or something?
MR. PINE:

Well, that is only one possibility,

your Honor, that may or may not be adopted, depending on the
circustances at that stage of the ease.

But —■

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

of the notice, to make sure that they have a chance not to
be barred?
MR. PINE:

Although, whether they are barred as

the, I think, Advisory Committee

and decision points out,

is something that they could litigate subsequently.
In other words, it is not decided in the first
case, the res judicata effect of the judgment.

That is

something that they would have a chance, if they wanted to,
to litigate later.
QUESTION:

Well, you can always have a chance at

litigating but I thought that one of the major aims of
amending a rule was to —

QUESTION:

So the rule really didn't accomplish it?

MR. PINE:

I don't know whether the rule was

I don't think there is any decision of this

Court that the Defendants point to, to the effect that in
what were previously known [as] "spurious class actions," If
you had adequacy of representation but not complete notice,
that that wasn’t res judicata.

Perhaps it was.

Perhaps it

should be, like the Ben-Iiur case where everyone's interests
are really common, just as they are when they are going
after a common fund.
Now, on the cost of notice, I think I have
covered that to some extent already.
have to direct notice.

The Court is said to

If the parties have to direct notice,

I submit that that can be decided on an equitable basis
and here, even without the evidentiary hearing, the District
Court would have been justified in taking judicial notice
of the fact that the SEC’s own special study had found that
the defendant exchange had reached its duty to these odd-lot
investors and what is really so wrong about making the
exhcange, which is supposed to protect investors, and which
didn't, pay for notifying them that they have an opportunity
to get some kind of recourse, If that is the only recourse
that they have — and perhaps, the whole question of

30

Individual notice, Mr. Justice White, would be eliminated
as a problem if you would hold that the Defendants can be
made [responsible] for the entire individual notice here.
QUESTION:

Let’s assume you lost your case again.

MR. PINE:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Horrible thought.

Then, what about costs of notice then?

Say you lost it.
Who is going to pay

in the long run?
MR. PINE:

Well, under Rule 5Md) I think,

equitable principles could be applied.

It depends on the

equities of the situation.
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn’t they be taxed to the

Not necessarily, your Honor.

But probably.

MR. PINE:

No, not even probably.

QUESTION:

I guess you would have to say that,

Plaintiffs?

There Is a

case --

otherwise, you would have to put

up a bond In the first

place.
MR. PINE:

No, I say — well, there Is no bond

provision for any plaintiff under the antitrust laws.
Suppose you are put out of

business by an antitrust

violator and he has taken away your opportunity to make any
money and you just have enough money to pay for, say, your

31
own transcripts but you certainly don’t have enough money
to pay for the defendants costs, taxable costs, that they
incur in defending the suit.
Does it mean that if you are put out of business
but for some reason you lose your antitrust suit, you have to
put up a bond?

The law is to the contrary.

QUESTION:

In your suit, presumably you were not

put out of business by those defendants.
MR. PINE:

QUESTION:
questions.

Well, that is something that may
I don’t think you can —
But that is the way we resolve those

If a jury says the defendants win, the plaintiffs

didn’t have an antitrust case.
MR. PINE:

There is a case where a plaintiff

established that the defendant had violated the Robinson
Patman Act, but the jury found he had not been damaged and
so the judgment was entered for the defendants, but the court
still taxed the costs to the defendants, because they had
violated the law and I think in principle and in equity, it
is no different from what the special study of the SEC
shows here, that is,the Exchange reached its duty to
investors and perhaps this cost should be put on the Exchange
simply on that basis alone and never made a taxable cost.
Why shouldn't the Exchange pay .for it?

They are supposed to

protect investors and the SEC has found that they did not and

32

perhaps It won’t be held to be an antitrust violation.
Even then, I say* the costs are equitably to be
imposed on the Defendants in this case.
I’ll reserve some time for reply, if I may.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Fine.

Mr. Milburn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEVEREUX MILBURN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MILBURN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Mr. Jackson and I — Mr. Jackson represents the
Stock Exchange and I represent the odd-lot houses — are
dividing our time basically equally and just to give you a
plan of what

we intend to do, I will deal with the question

of jurisdiction.

I will deal with the question of

expanding and correcting some of the facts.

I will deal

with manageability and with notice.
Mr. Jackson will deal with the substantive
aspects of Rule 23.

He will deal with fluid recovery,

minihearing and the costs of notice and policy considerations.
I would like to commence with the arguing
briefly as to jurisdiction which was requested in the grant
of certiorari in this case.
We believe that we, at the Court of Appeals,
had jurisdiction mainly because we have had from us

33
extracted the sura of $19,000 — or it is Intended to be
extracted from us —■ to finance a case against ourselves
and, if we are successful, by the Plaintiff's own admissions,
no chance of recovering it.
We have had inflicted upon us what we consider
an illegal and unlawful minihearing, a truncated hearing
on the merits, trial after trial and prior to jury trial,
which we have requested.
We have been subjected to or we are told that
we would be subjected to such inadequate notice that the
rights of the class would be denied, that res judicata will
be denied to us, that the chance of Plaintiffs opting out —
members of the Plaintiff class opting out — will be denied
to us because of the inadequacy of the notice.
We have also seen a misconstruction of Section IV
of the Clayton Act, as it applies to the odd-lot houses and a
misconstruction of Section VI of the Exchange Act as it
applies to the Stock Exchange.
We submit that because of all of these violent
actions taken by Judge Tyler against us that this case comes
clearly under the Doctrine of Cohen against Beneficial Loan.
Cohen said that when matters were too important
to be denied review, too independent to require postponement
until the whole case is decided, that they should be
adjudicated at the time.

34
QUESTION:

Mr. Milburn, why isn't Mr. Fine

right on the $19,000 business under Hickman against Taylor,
that if you want to raise that as an issue on appeal, you
don't simply pay

when the court tells you to pay, you go to

jail for contempt, an appeal of contempt citation.
MR. MILBURN:
but we feel that

Well, I think that is a possibility

we have a right under the Cohen Doctrine

to appeal at this time and I would find — I just am
guessing that my clients might have some objection to
following the course you suggest and maybe going to jail,
pending an appeal.
I haven't discussed it with them, but I am
guessing.
Now, I would like —
QUESTION:

Mr. Milburn, you didn't, after

Elsen I and in this Court, didn't you —• there was a petition
for

certiorari here, was there not?
MR. MILBURN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Which was brought by you or your

client?
MR. MILBURN:
QUESTION:

Which was denied.

MR. MILBURN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is correct, your Honor.

Your client and is counsel still of

the same view that the Death Knell Doctrine is an invalid

35
doctrine?
MR. MILBURN:

Your Honor, we stand by our brief

in the petition for certiorari in that case.
However, in this case, if Judge Kaufman is
reversed, then ~ as I think someone said, we will be back
with Judge Tyler,the 1966 Judge Tyler, whom we prefer and I
think one could assume from what has happened since that
Judge Tyler might — as he is permitted to by the Rule, he
might change his opinion and he might reinstate Tyler II, as I
call it and Tyler 11(a).
Nov;, looking at the Opinions in the en banc
decision and what has gone — the water that has gone under
the bridge — I cannot see how we would be denied a 1291(b)
certification.
So we would be back in the Court of Appeals.
We would be back here and we would have played
ring around the rosey for a considerable period of time.
QUESTION:

Do you think the question of the

validity of the Death Knell Rule is before us here?
MR. MILBURN:

I do.

I think that this Court has

an absolute right and jurisdiction to decide to decide that
question.

I still think that if they decide against

Judge Kaufman and overrule Judge Kaufman, that we have a
right to be here under the subsequent activities under Cohen.
I don't ~~

36
QUESTION:

Quite apart from the retained

jurisdiction?
MR. MILBURN:

Quite apart from that,yes, and I

think in Eisen I you have a conflict in the circuits, as you
mention, and circuit court as Jurisdiction and probably there
is a responsibility to resolve it at this time.
But we also feel that we are here under Cohen
and under the things that were done to us under Cohen and
that this Court should take this case.
Nov/, I would like to refer in that connection to
the case of Schuyenhoff against Holder.

In that case, this

Court decided that they were deciding Rule 35, a question
under Rule 35*

It was a matter of first impression at that

time but it was a rule promulgated by this Court and this
Court indicated that it felt a responsibility to put at
rest all the controversy under Rule 35.
Now, I don't think that anybody can deny that
the status of Rule 23 below is a mess and I would hope that
this Court would assume the responsibility now that we are
here before you with this case which has so many facets to it.
I would hope that It would assume the responsibility of
deciding the case.
Now, if I may proceed to consideration — brief
consideration of the facts.
six million people.

We all know that this case is

The class involves six million people.

37
Eisen II was decided and there were only 33-million,
500,000 but it has grown to 6 million by just a little
investigation and by a stipulation of fact.
Now, the enormity of this class, I know, bothered
Judge Medina and I know it must bother every judge in the
federal courts.
Now, six percent of those people live abroad
and speak foreign languages.

The class is diverse.

refer — probably I think the best affidavit in our

I would
Appendix

is that of Mr. Smith of Merrill Lynch on A53 in which he lists
25 different kinds of investors, by no means an exhaustive
list, 13 types of orders which can be changed and interchanged
in such a way that 13 isn’t the figure but it is many times 13»
It must be remembered that at all times in this
case Mr. Eisen can sue in his own behalf, that he can obtain
treble damages for whatever damages he received and he can
receive attorneys’ fees.
I submit that the facts show that this class is
unmanageable just by size alone but I will discuss that more
fully when I get to manageability and to notice.
The Plaintiff in his reply brief states that the
Court's finding regarding the Defendant's antitrust
violations and Exchange Act VI violations are not before this
Court for a reviextf because they were not reversed by the
Court of Appeals.

38
Well, 1 -- my favorite reading is Judge Medina's
Opinion and I am very familiar with it and I have found that
in three different places he has said that the findings and
the rulings of Judge Tyler as to the merits of the case, in
other words, our antitrust liability, the Exchange's
Section VI liability, are

vacated and he has also pointed out

that in his opinion, Judge Tyler had no right to consider
the merits and I do think that they are before this Court.
I say that in that they have been vacated and
are of no effect.
Now, the only other thing I have is that
Plaintiff continues to say, in his brief and in oral
argument that the stipulation says that 56 percent of the
class members' transactions are on tape.
The stipulation says that 56 percent of the
transactions on the New York Stock Exchange are on tape and
I think that you will realize that those are two different
things when we are dealing with class members, we are not
dealing with transactions on the New York Stock Exchange.
But that leads me into the question of
manageability.

We have a brand-new theory which has been

put forth by the Plaintiff in his reply brief.
This has never been argued before.

It has never

been briefed before and the Plaintiff is asking this Court
to ask as a court of first resort and decide this incredibly

39
complicated subject.
He has suggested that we now mail checks to
2million250,000 people with what they are entitled to.
sounds very simple,
QUESTION:

That

But I might point out that —
I don't understand this, Mr. Milburn.

He has suggested that you now mail checks before the —MR. MILBURN:

Well, as soon as the formula is

arrived at which the Plaintiff says that Judge Tyler has
arrived at a formula that he will apply that formula and
then will be able to tell what the damages are and what Is
due to these 2million people who are readily identifiable.
QUESTION:

If, as or when you have lost the case.

MR. MILBURN:
yes.

If, as or when we've lost the case,

I'm talking — Yes, if, as or when we have lost the

case and I'm talking on the point of manageability now
because it just doesn't stop.

When we lose It, somebody has

got to receive something.
QUESTION:

It doesn't stop, you say, with notice.

It stops with —

It never stops.

MR. MILBURN:

It stops with distribution.

Yes, if you will, sir.

At the point of ruling.

MR. MILBURN:

He never

He didn't ever invent a formula to

apply to the individuals who might present claims.
Now, it is very — even, I might just

add, even

in the notice which he suggests might be adequate, at page
224 to 225, he suggests that the claimants will have to
describe the type of transactions they have entered into.
Now, it is very easy to say that this can be
obtained from the tapes.

Well, it is easy to say but it

probably can’t be done and if it can be done, it can be done
only at immense expense.
The odd-lot houses do not deal with customers.
We deal with the commission houses on the New York Stock
Exchange.

It might even be said that anything you

requires no effort.

We will pay for it and we will hand it

But now, we still have the 2 million people.

have maintained all along that if you put in a market order
it costs us a certain amount of money to handle it.
If you put In one of these incredibly intricate
orders which are referred to in the affidavits of the
brokerage houses, It costs a lot of money th handle — a
"lot of money" I’m using figuratively — but in some cases
we may lose in handling one of those and others we may not
and in that way each transaction, we maintain, before we pay
anybody, we should have a right to defend ourselves, to
say not only was it not excessive, it wasn’t enough and we
should do that in each individual case.
Who are we, as Defendants, that we should be
denied the right to come face to face with people that say
we owe them money and say, no, you don’t.

42
Are we required to pay money to people that we
don’t owe money to?
QUESTION:

I maintain, your Honors, that we are not.
You are objecting to the formula,

then?
MR. MILBURN:

don't owe.
QUESTION:

If there was one, if the District

Court arrived at one, which you deny, the Court of Appeals
did not disturb it, did it?
MR. MILBURN:

Well, I don’t know what the

formula was.
QUESTION:

Well—

MR. MILBURN:

If they did — if you are talking

about that five percent they talked about?
QUESTION:

The $3.50 —

Well, what is your opposition

talking about in their brief when it says, "Applying the
formula to these 2 million."
MR. MILBURN:

I’ve been endeavoring to say I

don’t know.
QUESTION:

What formula is he referring to?

I see.

43
MR. MILBURN:

I don't think Judge Tyler reached

a formula to deal with these two million people or with
individual claims.

I think Judge Tyler said if you have an

individual claim you have got to come in and file it.
Now, I think I might call attention to the fact
that I think the Plaintiff’s attorney — I think I mentioned
tills briefly — has misinterpreted the testimony of

Mr. Martin who worked for Walston and who — which is now
not doing this kind of business.

We never said —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We'11 resume there

right after lunch, Mr. Milburn.
[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon
from 12:00 o'clock noon to 1:01 o’clock p.m.]

44
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. MILBURN:

Mr. Milburn.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I left dwelling on Mr. Martin’s testimony.

I’d

like to finish that in regard to one thing, the laborious
process which attorney for the Plaintiff referred to is the
laborious process of matching transaction^ to odd-lot
customers.

It is not the process of identifying names and

addresses of the odd-lot customers.
Now, if I could turn briefly to the subject of
notice.

It seems to me that the District Court’s error in

this respect was his feeling that Rule 23 and due process,
the notice required under those sections, is — the question
is whether a stringent and harsh notice will vitiate the
class action device if the Plaintiff is unable to pay the
notice.
Now, I would like to divide the discussion of
notice into two questions.

First,

and, secondly, we have due process.

we have the Rule itself
Every court that has

dealt with the subject of notice — and that is every court —
has said that notice must conform with the rule and with
due process.
Now, I would like to submit to this Court that
we have uere a rule.

In (c)(2) we have the requirement which

45
I am sure you are familiar with, but it is one sentence:
"In any class action maintained under subdivision
(b)(3) the Court shall direct to the members of the class
the best notice practicable under the circumstances including
the individual notice to all members who can be identified
through reasonable effort."
I would submit to this Court that we have a
question here of the English language.

I submit that there

is no question as to what that sentence means.

There Is no

question as to what it means insofar as"individual notice
to those who can be identified with reasonable effort" means.
There is no way that I can see — and the
attorneys for the Plaintiffs have tried in their briefs and
in oral arguments to twist one clause to modify another
clause but I submit that if it is read as we all understand
our language that it does require individual notice to all
members who can be identified through a reasonable effort.
That Is what the Rule says and I submit that that
rule must be complied with.
The second string to my bow is this —
QUESTION:

Notice by publication would not be

adequate, you think?
MR. MILBURN:

It would not be adequate under this

section of the Rule, your honor.
QUESTION:

I also —

Because of the use of the word

‘'individual” ?
HR. MILBURIJ:

Because of the use of the clause

following "including."
QUESTION:

"Including individual notice"?

MR. MILBURN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

"To all members."

MR. MILBURIJ:

Yes.

Now, the second string to my bow, as I was
saying, is that —
QUESTION:

The process goes, as you know, the

publication in a newspaper is individual notice

for some

purposes.
MR. MILBURIJ:
QUESTION:

Requires individual notices.

Yes.

MR. MILBURIJ:

Yes, sir.

I further submit that due process requires
individual notice and,

further, that the notice provided by

Judge Tyler is hopelessly inadequate.

If I might quote

Judge Medine, "It’s a farce."
Out of the six million people, we are giving
notice to 2,000 people who had 10 or more odd-lot transactions.
We ar’e giving notice to 5,000 odd-lotters out of six million
selected at random.

We are publishing in New York, in Los

Angeles and in California and in the Wall Street Journal,
nothing.

Nobody is taken care of in Middle America.

Two-thirds

47
of the six million people, as stipulated,are not in New York,
California, or they’ll probably not be reached by the news­
papers in those localities.
IJow, if we have — I would cite to this Court,
I’m sure unnecessarily, Mu1lane, which sets forth your rules
as to due process.

Mu1lane had some what might be called

language with loose language and it was tightened by
Schroeder almost immediately thereafter and Schroeder said,
"If anyone can be very

easily identified, he is entitled

to individual notice."
QUESTION:

What if you know his name but can’t

find his address?
MR. MILBURN:
him individual notice.

I would say that we

couldn't give

We couldn't mail a letter.

I would

put him with the other four million that can't be
identified and hope that he would be served by publication,
but not the type of publication suggested by Judge Tyler in
his opinion.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Milburn.

Mr. Jackson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM ELDRED JACKSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. JACKSON:
Please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

H8
The basic issue in this case, and this was the
basic difference between the Court of Appeals and the District
Court, is the question whether a rule of procedure may be
used to effect changes in substantive law.
The Court of Appeals, we submit, correctly held
no and in doing so, it reversed District Court determinations
which were based on the premise that in the interests of
liberal interpretation of Rule 23 and in the interests of
punishing alleged wrongdoers, this case must proceed as a
class action at any price and the price which the District
Court exacted was the bending and, indeed, the breaking, of
established constitutional and legal principles of substantive
law all in order to let Mr. Eisen act as the self-appointed
champion of the rights of six million class members scattered
throughout the United States and the Free World.
Now, Rule 23 was utilized to alter substantive
law in this case by the District Court, we submit, under
three points of notice.

It xvas woefully inadequate under the

Rule and under the Constitution, as Mr. Milburn has said.
Secondly, by the creation of the "fluid recovery
device," for the class as a whole.
Thirdly, by the preliminary hearing on the merits
followed by an order that the Defendants pay forthwith without
recovery 90 percent of the cost of communicating with the
class.

49
And these radical departures from substantive
law were decreed by the District Court because, otherwise,
the action was plainly unmanageable as a class action, as
Plaintiffs’ counsel conceded at 196 of the Appendix, when
he urged a fluid recovery because he said that if each of
the six million class members had to present his own personal
claim for damages, the class, indeed, would not be
manageable.
Now, we submit, your Honors, that it is really
not at all significant that class actions had their origins
in equity.

They are still procedural devices and that is the

whole thrust of Rule 23.

Its purpose, as can be divined

from its face as appears from the notes of the revisers
which are printed at pages 18 and following of the
Supplementary Appendix, was that Rule 23 was designed to
provide a means of getting together in a single form
existing claims, large or small, of actual individual plants
for the purpose of achieving judicial economy and efficiency
and uniformity of decisions where it is possible to do so
without sacrificing procedural fairness.
This rule, I submit, your Honors, confers no
substantive rights on any litigant.

The intended

beneficiaries of this rule are the courts.

The purpose is

to avoid the multiple litigation of claims which otherwise
would be litigated in different forums.

The purpose is to

50
assist the judiciary and, incidentally, to reduce its caseload
There is nothing in Rule 23 or in its history
about facilitating retribution for wrongdoers, alleged wrong­
doers .
There is nothing in the Rule that tilts the
scales for or against Plaintiffs or Defendants, as is
assumed by some commentators and was assumed by the District
Court.
Mr. Pine’s discourse on flexible remedies and
his citation this morning of the Borak case as an example of
the creativeness of the federal judiciary in not letting
wrongs go unpunished rather misses the point because all of
his cases, including the Borak case, didn’t each reach the
question of creating a flexible or inventive remedy for illgotten gains until after liability had been determined on the
merits and those cases are not properly considerable in
determining, at the outset of a litigation, whether the
suit should be permitted to be maintained as a class action
or not.
The Rule, of course, as this Court well knows,
was promulgated un'der the Rules Enabling Act which provides,
in very specific terms, that such rules may not — shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right and shall
preserve the right to trial by jury.
How, in the spending of substantive law as to

51
notice requirements, in that area I'd like to add a few words
to what Mr. Milburn has already said.
Mr. Fine has attempted to avoid the notice
problem, indeed, the manageability problem, by suggesting
that this case could well be a (b)(1) or a (b)(2) case,
rather than a (b)(3) case.
Well, I think it is significant that all judges
who have considered this case, including Judge Tyler, have
agreed that this can only be regarded as a (b)(3) case.
Judge Tyler certainly

found to this effect in

his first opinion in 1966, that — 95 of the Appendix — in
which he said that notice was required

by the Rule and the

Rule, of course, requires notice in (b)(3) actions.
Beyond that, Mr. Fine seeks to put this case
into the (b)(1) or (b)(2) category by arguing that it is
really an injunctive case.
Well, let's look at that.

The injunction, the

injunctive claim, claim for injunctive relief, is appended
to a claim for money damages and what is sought to be
enjoined by this complaint is the odd-lot differential
which was established in 1951 and permitted by the SEC.
Now, since that time, that differential has been
twice changed,

first in 1956 at the express direction of

the SEC to the New York Stock Exchange and then, later, in
1972 by a rule of the Exchange itself.

So it is evident, I

52
think, that the claim for injunctive relief in the complaint
is now moot.
In any event, Judge Tyler, in basing his estimate
of damage claims in this case for the period 1962 to 1966
did so by comparison with the 1966 rate as the proper rate.
So that it seems to us that the suggestion at this late date
that this is an injunctive case flies in the face of the
facts and in view of the obvious problems which this case
creates for itself because it is essentially a money-damage
case.

Let me turn now to the —
QUESTION:

There are, Mr. Jackson, are there not,

some federal court decisions that have said that if a case
was — is, in fact, for money damages and for an injunction,
that notice need not be given?

Were we told that by your

brother at the bar, here?
MR. JACKSON:
case.

I believe he intimated that was the

I don’t know of any such case.

I don't think that

that result could be constitutionally defended if there were
a truly adversarial situation, such as there is here, in
which a large class of consumers seeks to, In effect, to
recover against the supplier.
QUESTION:

Your view would be that the Plaintiff

would have to forego his money damage claim?
MR. JACKSON:
QUESTION:

Or give the notice.

Or give the notice.

MR. JACKSON:

Or give the notive, yes, your

Honor.
Turning to the next invention of substantive
law which we believe to be completely unjustified by Rule
23 and its true purposes, I come to the question of the
so-called ’’fluid recorvery" for the class as a whole.
Nov/, of coui°se, it is a fundamental principle
of our law that money damages are recoverable only by
persons who are injured by illegal conduct who can prove
damages flowing from such conduct and this principle is,
of course, enacted in Section IV of the Clayton Act which
is here involved, any person injured in his business and
property and so on, and the same principle of compensatory
recovery is recognized in the line of cases which have
construed Section VI of the Exchange Act, which is here
alleged to be the basis for the Exchanges liability.
But the Plaintiff has conceded that this case
could not proceed as a class action if this fundamental
principle of substantive lav; were to be observed, if all
class members were required to prove their damages.
And it was on this basis, in order to save the
class action at all costs, that the District Court ruled
that it would make an award of damages to the class as a
whole, that class members could file claims and prove their
damages and if they did so, they could, recover damages.

54
But for the great bulk of the class as a whole,
the differential would be reduced in the future until the
total award was exhausted.
Well, now, we submit, your Honors, that there is
no such thing as a class as a whole.

A class is not an

entity which is entitled to collect damages in its own right.
A class is a collection of claimants and that, we think, is
the teaching of this Court's decision in Schneider versus
Harris at 394 U.S.
An award of damages to the class as a whole by
reduction of the differential in the future would do two
things.

First, it would benefit future purchasers and sellers

of odd-lots who were not purchasers and sellers in 1962 to
1966 and thus not members of the class and thus not persons
who were injured by the Defendants' allegedly illegal conduct
and, secondly, such a device would not compensate past
traders who may not trade in the future and, furthermore,
this device, except as to those who — class members who
might file claims — would deny the Defendants their
constitutional right to a jury trial on damage issues and I
refer to this Court's decision in Curtis against Lowther of
last week.
In addition, what the District Court proposed
here by way of a rate reduction in the future would plainly
usurp the exclusive jurisdiction of the FCC under the

Exchange Act.
Courts have no power to fix odd-lot rates in the
first instance, under the Congressional scheme of regulation
of exchanges expressed in the Exchange Act.

That function

is confided to the SEC and the statute enacts standards which
must be applied for rate-making under its mandate and the
court’s injection of itself into this area of rate-making
is contrary to a long line of decisions of this Court which
forbid judicial intrusion into areas reserved by statute for
Agency expertise.
Finally, in the catalog of substantive law
changes effected in the name of Rule 23, we come to the
preliminary hearing on the merits and the resulting order
that the Defendants should pay 90 percent of the cost of
giving notice.
This, of course, we believe to be a clear
violation of the Defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights to due
process and their Seventh Amendment rights to a jury trial.
QUESTION:

I suppose, Mr. Jackson, you’d make

that argument if the percentages were reversed.
MR. JACKSON:
the costs.

Yes, an order to pay any part of

Yes, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jackson, how about the situation

where you want to take someone's deposition out of town and
your opponent comes in and says, "ive just can't, we're poor,

56
we

can’t afford.”

Wow, frequently, a court will, as a

condition to allowing a deposition, will require the
defendant to advance the travel costs to be paid by plaintiffs'
attorneys fees.

Is that so different from this?

MR. JACKSON:

I think it is, your Honor.

This

is — in the first place, this is not a poor man's case,
even though Mr. Eisen is not going to pay the costs of
notice.

After all, he is an investor in odd-lots of stock

on the Exchange.
But, certainly, the analogy to the in forma
pauperis cases is not in point.

I am quite aware that on

occasion courts do order the opposite party to advance
certain costs but those — I don't believe that this practice
is generally reverted to where it is apparent that the costs
can never be recovered, as is the case here.
We have a bill of costs in the Court of Appeals
of some $11,000 which will never be recovered and I don't
think that it is possible to say, as Mr. Pine does, well,
this is no worse than discovery costs.
that this is an incident of litigation.

Everybody realizes
I agree that in a

litigation every party has to pay his own costs of
discovery, whether it is $5 million for TWA or what.
But that is quite different from compelling a
party to pay his adversary's costs, the costs of financing
the litigation against him and these costs of giving notice

are those which should be borne by the Plaintiff because he
has elected to represent this class.In order to be an
adequate representative, he surely has to communicate with
them.

That is his expense and it certainly is no warrant

for putting all that expense on the Defendants.
QUESTION:

I suppose he can avoid that cost by

simply electing to proceed individually.
MR. JACKSON:

There is nothing to prevent that.

He can proceed individually.

In times gone by when there

was not such an award for class actions, people did proceed
individually as test cases where there was some substantial
principle to be vindicated.

There is nothing to prevent

that here.
Furthermore, he has the prospect of treble
damages and more than that, his legal fees will be paid for
because they are not limited, under the case law, by the
amount of his recovery.
QUESTION:

If he wins.

MR. JACKSON:
if he wins.

If he wins, yes, your Honor, only

If he loses, he takes the chance of every

litigant.
QUESTION:

I suppose when one of the litigants

asks to take a deposition in a distant place, faced with
the situation that I understood Mr. Justice Rehnquist to
refer to, he is asking to use the court's machinery and that

58
is a distinction.

The Defendants here, the odd-lot traders,

aren't asking the Court to do anything.
HR. JACKSON:
They are not.

That is right, Mr. Chief Justice.

They are asking to be let alone.

Mr. Fine argued, rather eloquently, I thought,
that the Exchange should be made to pay for all of these
costs because it failed to protect investors.
Well, now, he's trying to uphold the decision of
Judge Tyler but Judge Tyler didn't find any such thing as
that, nor is there any SEC determination that the Exchange
failed to protect investors.
Indeed, the very differential complained of here
was permitted to go into effect by the SEC in 1951 and in
1966 it was changed at the direction of the SEC.
Mr. Fine has also attempted to justify saddling
the cost of notice on the Exchange alone by analogizing the
case to those involving corporations where Judge Medina
rightly said, this may be a situation where the plaintiffs
don't have to pay the cost of notice, where they are share­
holders in a corporation.
Well, it is perfectly obvious, I think, that
there is no proper analogy between shareholders of a
corporation who own the corporation and customers of member
firms of the Exchange.
Now, the final

59
QUESTION:

Mr. Jackson, I take it that, even if

there isn’t a proper class of six million, if the Plaintiff
had been willing to put up costs of notice and accept the
job of giving notice to two million identifiable people,
what should have kept that class action from going forward,
if the Plaintiff had been willing to give notice and pay
for it?
MR. JACKSON:

The costs of individual notice

to the readily identificable members of the class, I should
say, if that were the case, that notice would not be an
obstacle to the class’s continuing.
QUESTION:

What would have been?

MR. JACKSON:

Well, I think it's the question of

manageability, your Honor.
QUESTION: You still — still manageability?
MR. JACKSON:

Oh, yes.

Consider, the problem

is posed by very large class actions where the alleged class
is enormous, as is true here, and where each individual
member of that class possesses a very small claim.
That is this case and that is the case which is
very difficult to manage.
are so small.

Why is that?

Because the claims

In this case, the District Court estimated

that the average claim, when trebled, would range from $3 or
so to $20.

That is the average, the range of the averages.

after trebling.

60
As against that, the costs of administration
would be very substantial.
$500,000.

The District Court said

That was several years ago, before the effects

of recent inflation.
how, in that kind of a situation, there are
bound to be problems of manageability, even beyond the
inherent problem of whether you are"going to turn courthouses
into coliseums," as the Second Circuit has said, in order to
administer two million claims.
The testimony of Deputy Clerk Murphy in the
record here as to the experience of what that court and its
clerk’s office went through in the drug cases where there was
a settlement, not a litigation, will show, I think, this
Court some of the inherent problems of manageability that are

he reached the

That was not based on

It cannot be based on evidence because, as

Mr. Milburn said, there is such a diversity of orders, there
is such a diversity of expense involved in executing diverse
orders that no simple formula of excess is possible.
In each case, you have to see what kind of an
order the man put in, how long It took to execute it and to
consider all the other factors that are involved.
This case is not susceptible of a simple formula,
as has been the case in other situations.
QUESTION:

So even if you find that there was an

antitrust violation, the damage formulation might be a
matter of difference in each individual case?
MR. JACKSON:

It would require individual claims

and that is another reason why it is unmanageable.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose they have to put for­

ward individual claims?
MR. JACKSON:

No, your Honor, they don't have to

come in person, but they do have to communicate with the
court and with the clerk's office and we know the
difficulties from other situations, the mystification that
these class members have when they receive a notice.

call up the clerk, as Deputy Clerk Murphy testified, and
say, "What does it mean?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Fine, you have

about eight minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. FINE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FINE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
First, with respect to the formula at page A212 of

63
the Appendix, the District Court opinion states that "The
Defendants consistently have stressed

the number of

variations in the type of odd-lot transactions and find that
this would necessitate a separate calculation of damage for
each individual transaction.

Although originally influenced

by this argument, in light of the availability of such
information and records discussed above, I now reject it as
the Court of Appeals has pointed out, moreover, the
Defendants make the same charge to all buyers and sellers
no matter what the type of transaction."
In other words, the Defendants live by a formula
so it is more than likely that the damages can be assessed
by a formula.
QUESTION:

It is more than likely that he

didn't decide what the formula was.
MR. PINE:

No.

QUESTION:

I couldn't find anything on A211 or

A212 that would —
MR. PINE:

All that we are suggesting is —

QUESTION:

— help me make out too many checks.

MR. PINE:

But in light of the comments of

Judge Tyler, it is more than likely that this case will be
manageable pursuant to a formula and if you —
QUESTION:

Well, you don't suggest, then, that

he has already devised a formula?

HR. FINE:

No, he hasn't devised one because we

have to go through the trial —
QUESTION:

Oh, I misunderstood you earlier.

MR. FINE:

No, your Honor, we have to go through

the trial on the question of damages to find out exactly what
the overcharge was.
What we are saying is, it would be applied across
the board to every single transaction under Judge Tyler's
reasoning.
QUESTION:

You think, now, that the evidence

would validate that conception?
MR. FINE:

That's right and if it isn't clear,

that is certainly something that should be made clear by
the District Court, and it could be made clear.
QUESTION:

There is no evidence on the subject

one way or the other right now, is there, really?
MR. FINE:

Well, I think the fact that he has

found that common questions predominate and this Is one of
the common questions that he thought predominated and the
basis that is used for it is sufficient on which to proceed
at this time —
QUESTION:

So-called?
MR. FINE:

hearing.

You mean, he did that in the mini­

I think this was before the mini­

65
QUESTION:

Well, on what evidence did he rely,

MR. FINE:

On the basis of the SEC special study

then?

where they pointed out that exactly the same rates had been
charged, that all the members of the class, including those
who would otherwise prefer to abide by the status quo will
be helped if the rates are found to be excessive.
If the rates are found to be excessive, they will
be found to be excessive for everyone who was subjected to
them in the past and hopefully if we arrive at the IBASCO
study, it means there is still some cushion or fat in the
rates for those in the future.
QUESTION:

Could the SEC deal with this in the

general area of the Injunctive relief that was sought?
MR. FINE:

No, your Honor, they did not, no.

Now, secondly, Mr. Jackson said that we changed
the substantive law by seeking judgment for the class as a
whole.

Well, judgments for class as a whole are routinely

entered in Securities Act cases.
Gamble-Skogmo

In the Gerstle against

case, there was a judgment for the whole

class affirmed by the Second Circuit.
The question then is, after the judgment has
been entered, who can make claims against the fund and what
should be done with any residue?
determination, as I argued before.

That is something for later

66
On the question of practicability governing the
entire notice rule, our reply brief refers to an

article

by Professor Kaplan and other authorities who support this
kind of notice in this kind of case.

In fact, there is no

commentary on the notice ordered by Judge Tyler, no scholarly
commentary that I know of which says that the notice is
Insufficient.
Indeed, Judge Medina said that under certain
circumstances, publication may amount to the best notice
possible, particularly where requirement of a different form
of notice would prevent potentially meritorious claims from
being litigated.
That is the case here.

I think it is particularly

ironic that the Defendants say they can get the names and
addresses from the tapes but can’t get anything else and the
cost that they are volunteering to undertake of generating
the names and addresses from the tapes is more, according to
their witnesses, than the costs which they would have to pay
if they went in accordance with Judge Tyler’s notice.
In other words, they are willing to pay more so
that we can be put out of court.
Now, I do think that public respect for the law
must be considered and just because these are small
claimants, as distinguished, for example, from the three
million shareholders of AT&T who, undoubtedly. If there \^ere

67
a proxy violation affecting them, could come into court and,
presumably, use the class action device to protect their
interests.

I think that the small claimants' interests

have to be satisfied just like those of the large claimants
or the claims of large individual corporations that can
afford to come in and sue for violation of the antitrust laws
and I refer by analogy to what Mr. Justice Stewart said in
U.S. versus Students Challenging Regulatory ilgency Procedures
that to deny standing, which is the analogy I draw here,
would mean that the most injurious and widespread governmental
action could be questioned by nobody.
We cannot accept that conclusion.
Similarly, here, we can't accept the conclusion
that the more widespread a violation of the antitrust or
securities laws and the smaller the resources of the victim,
the less effective the remedy.
I think the defendants would like to be able to
limit all classes to the 19th century class approved by this
Court in Smith against Swormstedt, which was described by the
Court as consisting of "traveling and wornout Methodist
preachers," but in this day of mass frauds, where we have the
National Student Marketing case and the Equity Funding case
and the Penn Central case, if you affirm the Second Circuit
here, you may very well put tremendous obstacles in the ways
of cases like that.

68
QUESTION:

Mr. Fine, throughout your brief, there

was mention of the fact that the statute of limitations may
have run® to many members of this class and that, therefore,
that affects the necessity of notice, I gather?
I am not sure I understood that, in your
presentation.

Doesn’t Utah take care of that problem?

your decision in Utah, we have two years left.
