MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
next in No, 72-700,

We will hear argument

Hernandez against Veterans Administration.

Mr. Curtice, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE L. CURTICE ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CURTICE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, the issue involved in this case is a jurisdictional
one, namely, whether 33 U.S.C. section 211(a) bars judicial
review of a lav/suit challenging the constitutionality of an
act of Congress concerning veterans’ educational benefits.
In the corap anion case of Robison v, Johnson, the
merits of the claim will be discussed.

The issue here is only

whether 3S U.S*C. 211(a) bars judicial review.
During my 15 minutes I will discuss the question of
the proper statutoary construction of 211(a)

and the due process

limitations which we feel are inherent in a contrary construc­
tion of 211(a).

My colleague, Mr. Petranker, will discuss the

question of whether Congress has the power to so limit
judicial review and the question of the extent to which
sovereign immunity is involved .in this lawsuit.
The facts are simple and undisputed.

Petitioners

herein are conscientious objectors who have performed two years
of alternative service as required under section 456 of
50 U.S.C.

Thereafter they applied for veterans’ educational

4
benefits with the Veterans Administration„

Their claim for

benefits was denied under the statute since they did not fail
within the definition of those individuals who have served mere
than 180 days on active duty* ' Thereafter, petitioners filed
a lawsuit in Federal District Court in California challenging
the constitutionality of the Veterans Readjustment Benefits P.ct
on the grounds that it was in violation of the First and Fifth
Amendments of the Constitution.
QUESTION:

What is the jurisdictional basis of the

lawsuit?
MR. CURTICE:

There were two main jurisdictional

bases, the mandamus 38 U.S.C. section 1651 and the $10,000
requirement under 1331, 28 U.S.C* 1361 and 1331,
QUESTION:

Those were both recited and relied on in

the complaint, were they?
MR. CURTICE:
QUESTION:

Yes, in both cases*

The relief requested is what?

MR, CURTICE is

The relief requested was declaratory

relief, injunctive relief, and affirmative relief, namely# tna*they receive the benefits,
QUESTION:

Was a mandamus requested?

MR* CURTICE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Where does the complaint appear here in

these papers, can you tell us?
MR* CURTICE:

The complaint appears as appendix -*■

5
It’s in the record, but I’m not exactly sure where it is.
QUESTION:

You don’t know where it is in the papers

we have?
MR. CURTICE:

No, I do not.

The District Court dismissed the lawsuit, and the
Ninth Circuit affirmed on the grounds that 38 U.S.C. section
211(a) is a bar to our claim that petitioners are entitled to
veterans educational benefits.
The first issue that I would like to address myself
to

is the proper statutory construction of 211(a).

We submit

that racier a proper interpretation of 211(a) the more difficult
constitutional question involved in a contrary construction of
211(a) need not be faced.

We submit under the plain meaning

of the statute that this case should noc be barred by 211(a).
The statute provides that the decisions of the Administrator
on any question of law or fact under any law administered by
the Veterans Administration shall be final and the courts shall
have no power to review any such decision.
By the terms of the language of that statute, this
lawsuit is not barred, for we are not seeking review of the
decision of the Veterans Administration.

The Veterans

Administration has refused to consider petitioners' constitu­
tional claims, and we contend rightfully so, that they don’t
have the power to consider our challenge to the constitutionality
>

of the Act which they administer.

6
Furthermore, under the language of the statute, we
are not. seeking review of any question of the lax*; administered
by the Veterans Administration. We are instead contending that
the statute itself is unconstitutional.

So x*;e are not seeking

review on any question of law by the Veterans Administration.
The statutory history of section 211(a) and particu­
larly the 1970 amendment support our conclusion.

The Government

suggests that 211(a) — the 1970 amendment of 211(a) x^as meant
to cut out judicial review even in this type of case where we
are challenging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress.
It’s, apparent from the legislative history that the purpose of
the 1970 amendment was merely to overrule certain decisions of
the Circuit Court in the District of Columbia concerning
questions involving the termination of benefits.

The D.C,

Circuit had held that 211(a) was not a bar to cases involving
determination of benefits in contrast to those cases involving
the application for benefits, and we submit that the 1970
amendment was only meant to overrule this type of case„
There is nothing at all in the legislative history
of the 1970 amendment or the earlier enactment of the predecessors
of 211(a) that indicate that Congress wished to cut off judicial
review in this type of case, namely,, where we are seeking
judicial review of the constitutionality of the statute.
QUESTION:

What act is it you claim is unconstitutional:

MR. CURTICE:

The Veterans Readjustment Benefits

7
Act.
QUESTION;

Which says what?

MR. CURTICE;

Which says that veterans v/hc serve more

than 180 days on active duty are entitled to veterans * educational benefits.
QUESTION;

You say that’s unconstitutional?

MR. CURTICE;
QUESTION:

Why?

MR. CURTICE;
Robison case.

Yes.

I would like to defer that to the

We are going to strictly limit ourselves to

the jurisdictional question.
QUESTION;

Mr. Curtice, suppose that your client had

sought a benefit from the Veterans Administration, was denied
it by the Administrator, and then sought to challenge it in
the District Court, not on the grounds of unconstitutionality,
of the statute, but on the grounds that the Administrator had
unconstitutionally discriminated against him as compared with
other similarly situated applicants?

Do you think 211 would

permit that sort of review or not?
MR, CURTICE; Well, previous cases have held that it
would not permit such review.
before us at this time.

We do not have that question

Ours is a much narrower issue where

therehas been absolutely no review by any court or no decision
by the Administrator at all on the questions presented.

Ours

is a case in which the Administrator has refused to consider

s
the constitutional challenges to the statute.

We ara not

seeking review of a factual, legal question which the Veterans
Administration has already

resolved.

This construction of the statute would also be in
line with this Court's theory that judicial review of statutes
should not be cut off unless it is within the plain meaning of
the statute and the legislative history supports that interpreta
fcion.

And we submit there is none such here.

Also, this

interpretation of the statute would save this Court the
necessity of facing the constitutional issues involved in the
case which we submit are grave.
Now, I' would like to get into the due process
limitations which are inherent in the contrary construction.
If 211(a) were construed not to apply to a case like this, we
submit that petitioners' due process rights have been violated,
namely, they have been denied an opportunity for a meaningful
hearing appropriate to the nature of their claim.

They have

had absolutely no hearing whatsoever on their constitutional
claim, which is the one that is appropriate to the nature of
their claim in this case.

And we submit that the protections

of the due process clause come within the meaning of board of
Regents^v, Roth, because there has been a legitimate —
petitioners do have a legitimate claim of entitlement to
benefits.
QUESTION:

They have a reasonable expectation, is

3

that the point residing on the Rota case?
MR. CURTICE:

Mo, not the reasonable expectation,

because under the statute, it is clear that they didn’t have
a reasonable expectation.

So we submit that the statute provides

the basis for the claim, and the Constitution provides a
legitimate claim of entitlement to the benefits.

For example,

if the statute had said that no blacks were to receive benefits
under the statute, we submit that Roth would cover the situation
even though it’s quite clear that they have no reasonable
expectation of receiving it.

In other words, the Constitution

provides a source of legitimate claim of entitlement to these
benefits.
QUESTION:

That’s a substantive constitutional right

you are talking about there, isn’t it?
MR. CURTICE:
QUESTION:
equal protection,

Yes,

The right to be free from denial of
X think the Government argues herein, and

to me with some persuasiveness, that Mr, Justice Stewart’s
opinions in

Perry v. Sindermann are basically procedural due

process types of situations where you don’t have any substantive
claim, but there you have to show'some sort of property that’s
created by a statute that you are not attacking really.
MR. CURTICEs

I think that the Roth decision should

be extended to the extent that it covers claims for property
interests which, but for the unconstitutional statute, they

10

would be entitled to receive those benefits.

X would say that

again if the statute had provided that all veterans are
entitled to receive benefits except for black veterans, they
would have a right, a due process right, a property right, that
they should have a meaningful opportunity to present their
claim of entitlement to these benefits,
QUESTION:

Where in your submission is there a right

to a hearing, in the Agency?
MR.

CURTICE:

No, in this type of case the only place

where there would be such a right when you are challenging
the constitutionality would be in the Federal court,
QUESTION:

In other words, your argument would cover

this situation; I could go into a Federal court and attack
the constitutionality of the program for aid to mothers with
dependent children saying that while I am not a mother and I
don't have dependent children, I am a father whose children are
independent, and nonetheless this statute is unconstitutional
as to me, and there is some ground of independent jurisdiction
based on this kind of a claim?

That I’m entitled to a hearing

on that claim?
MR. CURTICE:

We still have standing to sue because

we are seeking the benefits in question.
QUESTION:

Well, I would be seeking the benefits that

are given to mothers with dependent children on the proposition
that the statute is unconstitutional because it doesn't give it

11
to me who is a father with independent children.
MR. CURTICE;

Well, that would get into the question

of a legitimate claim to entitlement.
QUESTION;

I would have a good-faith claim.

It might

be quite wrong, but I would believe in it, my hypothesis.
MR, CURTICE;

I would submit that that is distinguish­

able.
QUESTION;

How?

MR. CURTICE s
of entitlement.

And why?

In our case, we have a legitimate claim

That is our contention,

QUESTION;

That would be my contention, too, in my

lawsuit.
MR, CURTICE;

Well, I would say that it would come

within that, but it's a case that would be —
QUESTION;

The Constitution absolutely itself

confers jurisdiction upon a district court and compels the
district court to give me a hearing on that claim,
MR. CURTICE:
QUESTION;

No, not the Constitution.

Well, Roth is a constitutional decision,

wasn’t it, and you are relying on Roth.
MR. CURTICE;
QUESTION;

I am relying upon Roth, but —
Roth v, United States.

MR. CURTICE;

I ’ am relying upon the statute itself.

I am relying upon the Veterans Readjustment Benefits Act.
QUESTION;

Well, I would be relying on the legislation

12
that gives aid to mothers with dependent children.
MR. CURTICE:

Then under the writ of mandamus statute,

we are submitting that we are entitled to make a claim for
benefits on the grounds that the statute is —
QUESTION:

Of course, anybody is entitled to make a

claim for anything," but the question is whether or not there
is a duty of the Federal court to grant you a hearing on this
claim as against legislation in the Congress that seems on the
face, at least, to say that the decisions of the Veterans
Administration are unreviewable in these cases.
MR. CURTICEs

We submit in the case, for example, again

where the statute which says that no black vras to receive
benefits, that that would come under the Roth rationale. In
other words, you would be entitled to a hearing to challenge
the statute, that .it was unconstitutional*
QUESTION:

Suppose, counsel, -that a young man

had been in the Peace Corps and he made

the same claim for

educational benefits that your client is making here.

The

Veterans Administration presumably would deny that claim
administratively, wouldn't they?
MR. CURTICE:
QUESTION:

Because he is not a veteran.

MR, CURTICE:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

Now, isn't the Veterans Administration

administratively saying they have denied this claim for

substantially the same reason, that he is not a veteran?
MR. CURTICE:
QUESTION:

They have said that, but we submit ..

But in that sense, procedural.!'/

lay

aside the substantive claim — procedural!/ he is in the same
oosture as a Peace Corps, former Peace Corps man who wanted
veterans' benefits, isn't he?
MR. CURTICE:

Yes.

I will yield to Mr. Petranker.
QUESTION:

One question, here in your record I find

a complaint from soma Peter Miller and Gary Leon.
MR. CURTICE;
QUESTION:

What's that doing in this record?

MR. CURTICE:
dated.

Yes.

There are two cases? they were consoli­

I brought one action and Mr. Petranker brought another,

and they were consolidated for purposes of appeal to the Ninth
Circuit.
QUESTION:

Mr. Curtice, isn't your argument basically

kind of independent of your Roth contention that —
MR. CURTICE;

Yes.

QUESTION:

1331 confers Federal credit question

jurisdiction when you allege $10,000 in controversy.

You allege

substantive constitutional claim, and that the statute in ques­
tion deprived your clients of the equal protection component
of their* Fifth Amendment due process.
MR. CURTICE:
QUF.STION:

That’s correct.

And, therefore, the Federal court has ju-

14

risdietion aider 1331 to at least hear your claim.

Quite apart

from any Roth.
MR, CURTICE;

That's right.

We're saying also that,

the statute as construed does not apply to a case like this,
211(a), on its face does not apply.
QUESTION;

That would be the same claim, again, going

back to the Peace Corps case,
MR. CURTICE:
QUESTION:

Yes, it would.

The former Peace Corps man said this is

denial of equal protection or otherwise raises a constitutional
question.

You say he has a right to have a Federal court decide

that constitutional question.
MR, CURTICE:
QUESTION:

Yes,

And, as I understand it, you say the statute

if properly construed doesn't apply to this kind of a case,
MR. CURTICE:
QUESTION:

That's right.

But that if you did construe the statute

this way, it would deny you some sort of a constitutional right
to a hearing.
MR. CURTICE:

Right.

And Mr. Petranker will go into

other constitutional problems.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Petranker, we have de­

tained your colleague a little longer, and we will enlarge your
time about 3 minutes to compensate for that.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK R. PETRANKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PETRANKER:

Thank you, your* Honor.

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at
the

cutset, I would like to turn to a question which Mr„

Justice Stewart raised,

X think that Mr. Curtice correctly

answered that question, but I sense that there may be some
confusion left in the minds of the Court,

Mr. Justice Stewart

raised the question whether an individual could come into court
and claim a right to a hearing on his claim that he was entitled
to benefits under the Aid to Dependent Children’s Act even
thought he was riot a mother and did not have dependent children.
I think the distinction between that case and this
one is that there would be an independent basis there for
denying jurisdiction, and that is simply that his claim would
be frivolous.

Whether or not it was brought in good faith, I

think once the terras of the statute were taken into account and
the purposes of the statute, that there simply would be no
valid constitutional claim,
In this case our position is that once the statute is
properly considered in the light of its purposes, there is a
substantial constitutional claim that conscientious objectors
who perform alternative service, like persons who are in the
armed forces, fire entitled tc
QUESTION;

those benefits.

You say that any time you allege a

constitutional claim, the Federal court must hear it unless it
is determined that that’s insubstantial.
that

The court might decide

its insubstantial, a frivolous claim, not this particular

16
orse, but a claim, and then not hear it.

But otherwise, if the

constitutional issue is raised, you say it must be heard»

MR, PET RANKER:

That’s correct, your Honor.

We think

that’s fundamenta1.
QUESTION:

And it was your complaint also, grounded cn

28 United States Code, section 1331,
MR. PETRANKER:

Yes, 1331? also section 1361, and in

addition in ray complaint, we raised as an additional jurisdictiona

ground 5 U.S.C. section 701 and the following sections, the
Administrative Procedure

Act, which specifies that a person

aggrieved by Agency action has the right to go into Federal
court to seek .relief,
QUESTION:

But doesn’t that Procedure Act exclude the

case where review is precluded by statute?
MR, PET RANKER;

That’s correct.

Our contention is

that since section 211(a) doesn’t apply here, the Administrative
Procedure Act does.
QUESTION;

On what basis did you, under 1331, allege

an amount in controversy of more than $10,000, excluding interests
and costs?

MR, PETRANKER:

Essentially, the value of an education

to the individual plaintiffs involved, the benefits that they
are seeking would enable them to obtain a college education or
higher education, and without those benefits they might well not
be able to commence or complete a college education, and over

17

the course of their lifetime that certainly would result in an
economic deprivation to them in excess of $10,000.

That is the

basis of our allegation.
QUESTION;

You were in the Hernandez case?

MR. PETRANKERS
QUESTION:

Yes, that’s right.

Representing Mr. Hernandez and purportedly

all those similarly situated?
MR, PET RANKER:

Mr. Hernandez and Thomas Wolf

were

the two named plaintiffs, andin addition it was a class action,
yes,
Mr. Curtice has already addressed himself to the due
process issue involved in this case.

In addition, J. would

simply like to point out as the Court already has, I believe,
what the other constitutional problems are in the Government's
position that even though petitioners have raised purely a
constitutional claim, a substantive constitutional claim, that
nonetheless they can be denied relief or review of the
constitutionality of an Act of Congress in the Federal courts,
or for that matter in any court.

Essentially, that proposition,

of course, runs afoul of the rule recognized in countless
decisions of this Court as fundamental to this form of government.
And that is that the courts must always be open to hear claims
that the Constitution has been violated by Congress.
QUESTION;
less than $10,000?

Do you think that's true if the claim were

13

MR. PST RANKER;

If there were no other forum, judicial

forum in which that claim could be heard, then I think essentially
the

same problem would be raised here, yes.
QUESTION;

But voir wouldn* t say it would have to be

raisable in the Federal court,
MR. PETRANKER;

No, your Honor.

Under the terms of

section ~~
QUESTION:

That’s what we have got here, is a Federal

court.
MR.

EETRANKER:

Under the terms of section 211(a) ,

Congress apparently sought to cut off review in every court,
your Honor.

The statute provides that the decision of the

Administrator shall be final, and that would appear to cover
State courts as well.
QUESTION:

I know, but it reads, "or in a court of

the United States.'*
MR,. PET RANKER :

Well, that term is ambiguous. Our

position is that there is really no basis for Congress to decide
that the Federal courts cannot review decisions by the Veterans
Administration but the State courts can.

That would run contrary

to the normal presumption that review of Federal agencies should
be in the Federal courts,
QUESTION:

I suppose if the Administrator was sued in

a State court, he could remove to Federal court, couldn't he
under the removal statute?

19

MR, PETRANKER;

There might he a problem there, year

Honor, in that the removal statute would seem to conflict with
what the Government says section 211(a) is, since they contend —
QUESTION;

No, it wouldn't be removable if the

Federal court didn't have jurisdiction in the first place,
MR, PETRANKER;

That's correct, your Honor,

So that

there might be a problem there, and that's another reason that
it wouldn't seem to make sense to construe section 211(a) to
allow suit in the State courts.

There would be still a further

problem in that the ultimate review of State court decisions,
the Supreme Court, this Court, would seem to be barred from
consideration of claims coming from the State courts by that
inte rpretation,
QUESTION;

I take it your position is that if 211

said that the United States courts shall'not have jurisdiction
in

any action challenging the constitutionality of any provision

of this statute, that you would be arguing that statute is
unconstitutional, the provision is unconstitutional in itself,
barring those sort of suits from Federal courts,
MR, PETRANKER;

If the State courts were left open,

I don't think there would be a constitutional problem.
QUESTION;

Well, then, let's assume that this present

section is cbnsti"uable that way.
MR. PETRANKER;

I misspoke myself to some extent,

I think- there v/ould be a constitutional issue raised.

I don't

20
think it would be an difficult as the issue posed here*

And X

think it would certainly go much further toward protecting the
rights of petitioners here, since they would at least receive —
QUESTION:

One of the issues in the case is how do

you construe this section.
MR. PETRANKER:
QUESTION;

Yes,

What did Congress intend to preclude

litigation about in the Federal court.

Now, let’s assume for

the moment that we decided that Congress intended to preclude
constitutional challenges to the statute.

Then your case is

much different, would you say?
MR. PETRANKER:

On the assumption that exclusion was

intended to apply in Federal courts but not in State courts?
QUESTION:

Well, we discussed — it's hard to say

about the State courts.

Btit at least let’s assume we are

clear about Congress' intention with respect to the Federal
courts.

Decause after all, that is what it does say, the

courts of the United States,
MR. PETRANKER:

The term "courts of the United States

heis been construed in other statutes to include courts of the
States, so that in itself I don't think is a sufficient indicator.'
But if that construction were possible, I think we would take
the position that unless it at the same time appeared that there
was a definite right to go into State court, that the
constitutional requirements of a hearing on questions of

21
constitutionality would not have been satisfied,

There would

also be an additional problem wider Article III, whicu we have
addressed ourselves to in the briefs as to whether those
questions could be entrusted completely to the State courts
without the possibility of review in this Court.
that

But as I say

is a much more narrow question, and it's one that would

not ix>se as gg^ious constitutional problems as are involved
here.
Now, the Government has relied on two basic arguments
for their view that the courts can indeed be deprived of
jurisdiction to hear constitutional claims.

First, they point

to the fact that Congress can, of course, control the jurisdic~
tion of the Federal courts, and I suppose at least within
limits the State courts as well.

But they failed to point to

any case which has held that Congress can remove the jurisdic­
tion of the courts to consider constitutional claims where the
result would be that no court could consider a constitutional
claim.

And that's what’s involved here, and that is the rule

that we believe the decisions of this Court, and in fact the
entire theory of this Government requires, that some court must
be able to hear constitutional claims.
In addition, the Government relies on an application
of the sovereign immunity doctrine.

They contend that since in

the normal case Congress must give its consent before the United
States can be sued, that then in this case since Congress appears

22
to, under the Government’s construction, have withdrawn its
consent to be sued, that sovereign immunity doctrine does bar
consideration of petitioners' claims.

But, of course, again

there is a clear exception in the sovereign immunity doctrine
when it is alleged that an officer of the United States is acting
pursuant to an unconstitutional statute, and that is the
situation that we have here.

So that again the position that

the Government has taken is ’unsupported by the decisions of
this Court and by —
QUESTION;

Do you think there is any difference between

asking for a declaratory judgment and an order to an officer to
pay out funds of the United States?
MR. PET RANKER:

Well, in asking for a declaratory

judgment, the Court does not impose an affirmative duty on
Congress or on an officer of the United States.

It does give

Congress the option in this particular act; for example,if
the Court declared that the Veterans Readjustment Benefits Act
was unconstitutional, Congress would have the option of enacting
a new law, terminating the law, or proceeding to include
conscientious objectors within the terms of the Act, so that
there is not as direct an interference.
QUESTION:

So again I ask you do you think in terms

of sovereign immunity that thex*e is a difference between asking
for an order for benefits as distinguished from just a
declaration that the statute is unconstitutional?

MR, PETRANKER;

I think there is that difference to

which I just tried to address myself.
QUESTION;

All right.

You think if you do ask for an

order, actually for an order to pay money, that you are barred
by sovereign immunity?
MR. PETRANKER;

If that were the only kind of relief

that could satisfy the claims of the petitioners,
QUESTION;

Could I just ask you. in terms of the

complaint in this case.

It says, enter injunctions, require

them to cease refusing to grant plaintiffs’ benefits.
MR. PETRANKER;

I believe the second paragraph of

the prayer for relief does also request declaratory relief.
QUESTION;

Yes, but let’s —

MR. PET RANKE R;

Focusing on the first, there vras a

suggestion in Larson v. Domestic fi Foreign Finance Carp, that
even in a case involving an allegation of unconstitutionality
where affirmative relief would be required in order to effectuate
an order of the court, that sovereign immunity might operate
as a bar.

I think the correct interpretation of that suggestion

is that in a case where affirmative relief would cause a
substantial interference with the function of the Government,
in other words, a variant of the compelling interest test, if
you will, if the Government could come in and show a compelling
interest which would lead to the conclusion that it should
not be required to make affirmative relief, then it might be

24
that despite the allegation of unconstitutional ify, idle court
would not have jurisdiction, because of the sovereign immunity
doctrine*

But in a case where affirmative relief could be

granted without any substantial, interference, and that is a
question, I submit, for the Court, then the court would not be
barred by the sovereign immunity doctrine,

Thank you, Mr. Petranker,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD P, MORTON ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR,NORTON:

Mr* Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court, I lost my voice to a cold over the weekend, and if I
don’t come across loudly enough at times, let me know? I will
try to speak up.
There are two consolidated cases before the court,
Hernandez presenting the same issues on the merits and on
jurisdiction as will be considered also in the Robison case
next on the calendar.

We don’t have an extensive factual

record below because the case went off in a motion to dismiss,
and the allegations of the complaint do not provide substantial
background about the plaintiffs here.

We do know that they did,

as alleged, serve two years of alternative service and were
denied benefits when they applied to the VA for educational
benefits provided by the 1966 Veterans Readjustment Benefits
Act

25
I think I will start,turning directly to the question
of whether section 211 applies here.

By its terras it says that

the decision of the Administrator, the VA, under any of the
laws administered by the VA with certain exceptions for
contractual benefits not involved here, shall be final and
conclusive and no other official or any court of the United
States shall have jurisdiction or power to review such a
decision.
How, v/e think this statute clearly covers this case
by its terras.

The plaintiffs are seeking here to review a

decision o£ the Administrator, namely, that they are not
entitled to benefits.

Their effort to get out of the terras of

the statute clearly involves an assertion that there are
reasons why the Administrator should have come to a contrary
decision. They say he should have decided that they were
entitled to benefits for reasons that he did not consider, namely,
the constitutionality of the statute.

But you cannot avoid the

fact that these cases seek to review a decision of the
Administrator to the effect that they were not entitled to
benefits, and therefore these cases are squarely within the
terms of 211.
To appreciate the scope of preclusion of review that
Congress intended, I think it is important to trace the
background of this statute.

A forerunner of 211 was enacted

in 1921 which provided that the Director of the Veterans Bureau,

then administering the. veterans' benefit laws, adopted after
World War I, shall decide all questions arising under the Act.
Mow, in the Silberschein case and a series of decisions in the
1920's, this Court decided that while any questions of fact were
not subject to judicial review under that statute, that a
question of law or question of whether the Administrator's
decision was arbitrary or whether there was any evidence whatever
to support the decision might not be subject to the preclusion,,
Then in 1933 Congress enacted the Economy Act as part
of

the effort to reduce Government expenditures and made various

changes in the veterans' benefits programs, and in that statute
there was another preclusion provision which provided that all
decisions of the Administrator under provisions of law for
noncontractual benefits shall be conclusive on all questions of
law and fact and no official or court of the United States shall
have jurisdiction to review those decisions bv mandamus or
otherwise.
In Lynch v., United States in a unanimous opinion by
Mr. Justice Brandeis, this Court observed that the 1933 provision
was obviously intended by Congress to eliminate even the scope
of review that the Court had previously said was available under
the 1921 Act, and there was no intimation that the constitutional
problem was presented by that action.

Indeed, in Lynch the

Court discussed at some length the enormous power that Congress
has to grant or withdraw benefits, gratuitous and noncontractual

21
benefits e and the enormous power that Congress has to grant or
withdraw a forum in which to press for relief under a statute
4

granting such benefits.
In 1957,the 1933 provision and a similar provision
adopted in 1940 were combined into the immediate predecessor
of 211.

That statute included the language to the effect that

the Administrator's decision on any question of law or facts
concerning a claim for benefits under these noncontractual
provisions was conclusive and not subject to judicial review.
A series of decisions in the District of Columbia Circuit
construes 211 as not precluding review of a decision concerning
termination or reduction of benefits, distinguishing between
claim and termination.
Nov;, this led Congress in 1970 to amend the statute
retroactive to 1940 to make it perfectly clear that Congress
intended that all decisions of the Administrator under the
provisions of the statutes providing for noncontractual benefits
were not subject to judicial review,
QUESTION:

What about — go ahead,

QUESTION:

Is there anything in the legislative

history that gave to the Veterans Administration the right to
determine the constitutional question?
MR.

NORTON: ;

There is not.

There is some

indication •—
QUESTION:

Well, isn’t that this case?

28

MR,

NORTON:

I would not say that is this case

because we do not contend that the VA has decided the constitu­
tional question.
QUESTION:

But suppose the VA decides that nobody

who didn't go overseas shouldn’t collect?

How would you touch

that?
MR,

NORTON:

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you,

The VA says you can’t get veterans' benefits

because you didn’t go overseas, you stayed in Camp Lee.

What

could be done with that?
MR,

NORTON:

Under a statute that makes that

distinction or —
QUESTION:

No, no, under this present statute.

How

do you get to that?
MR. cNORTON;

The cases construing the present

statute,and Roth. v« United States in the Ninth Circuit is an
example, say that 211 precludes review of any decision, even
where it is claimed that the Administrator committed an error
of law or of constitutional dimension in applying the statute.
QUESTION:
MR.

Rcth said constitutional dimension?

NORTON:

It was claimed in the Roth case that

the decision of the Administrator was based on either a lack of
evidence or the way in which the claim was treated resulted in
a denial of due process to the claimant,
QUESTION:

Because of the treatment of the evidence,

the factual evidence.
MR*

NORTON:

QUESTIOH:
MR.

••

Well, that was the nature of the case.

That's not a constitutional question.

NORTON:

That was the allegation.

And the

Court said even with that allegation of a denial of a
QUESTION:

So in this case if the Administrator just

deliberately violates the Constitution of the United States,
he is the only man in Government who goes scot free,
MR.

NORTON:

There is nothing in the terms of 211

that makes any exception for that situation, and the observation
of the Court; in the Lynch case where they said that the similar
statute eliminated review of an arbitrary decision by the
Administrator would lead in that direction*
QUESTION:

It didn't say unconstitutional; it said

arbitrary,
MR*

NORTON:

x think, you can in large measure

equate the two because the way the question of due process has
developed to be often interchangeable with arbitrary action*
There is another indication of the Congress' intent
in the 1933 Economy Act in that under a separate provision of
that statute involving not contractual benefits, but reduction
of pay to certain people, Congress had another provision precluding
judicial review, except in cases where a constitutional issue
was presented.

So Congress knew how to make the distinction
in
when it wanted to and/none of the statutes leading up to 211 has

30

it done so»
QUESTION:

Mr. Norton, what if the petitioners here

instead of having presented a claim to the Administrator had
simply gone into the District Court under 1331 and 13S1 and
challenged the constitutionality of the statute?
Government have asserted the

Could the

provision of 2.11(a) as a defense

to that action?
MR.NORTON;

Well, 211(a) would not seem to apply on

its face because it x-jould not — if the Administrator had taken
no action whatever on this issue, it would not seem that there
would ba a decision of the Administrator to review.

Of the

other questions raised in such a suit, as to whether .it was
premature, whether there had been exhaustion of administrative
remedy, and, of course, sovereign immunity

or another basis for

jurisdiction would be additional issues that would have to be
confronted.

That, of course, is not this case.

The desire of Congress to preclude judicial review in
this area seems amply justified by the potentially enormous
burden that review of VA decisions would place on the courts,
VA takes about 15 million adjudicative actions annually, and
the Board of Veterans Appeals alone disposes of some 30,000
cases.

The vast majority of these involve claims under the

various noncontractual

benefits programs that are the subject

of section 211(a).
Now, the plaintiffs claim that if the suit is barred,

31

that they are denied their due process rights.

But the critical

provision of the Fifth Amendment that they never really face
up to is that the Fifth Amendment

only protects against denial

of life, liberty, or property without duo process of law.

And

as tlris Court's decision in the Roth case indicates, every
person who seeks some benefit or is disappointed by the action
taken by Government concerning him does not have the basis for
a claim under the Fifth Amendment.

It must be a property

interest of some sort created either by statute, contract,
practice or common law.

The plaintiffs concede that under the

statute on its face they have no property interest in these
benefits.

They try to construe, or to contend that the statute

has to be read as unconstitutional if it does not extend benefit
to them, and therefore by combining the Constitution and the
statute, they have a property interest.

But the Court indicated

in Roth that the Constitution does not create property interest
and that approach does not have any merit, we believe.
In addition, there is the problem that if the claim
made is that a statute unconstitutionally distinguishes between
groups by giving something to one and taking away or not giving
to someone else, all the plaintiffs can really claim is that
that distinction is invalid.

It doesn’t necessarily follow

that they are entitled to get what someone else got.

It may be

that the answer is the benefits should not have been extended
to either group, it was to everyone or to none.

But the

32

Constitution itself, even in conjunction with the statute, does
not give them a right to benefits.
The plaintiffs have contended that they have a right
to a court hearing because

Article III of the Constitution

they say basically requires that the Federal court be available
to hear any and all constitutional questions that may be raised.
Ifow, just last term in the Palmore case this Court rejected the
proposition that Congress was obliged under Article III to vest
in the Federal courts all of the judicial power authorized by
Article III, and it is still the law and has been throughout
our history that to have jurisdiction in a court there has to
be a statute extending that jurisdiction.

And Congress has the

power to grant jurisdiction and it has the power to limit
jurisdiction, and as the Court said in Lynch, their power knows
virtually no limits.
On the question whether 211 applies to State court
proceeding, that has not previously been raised in this case.
This case arose in a Federal court.

The question of State court

jurisdiction over a case like this is one 'that I think would
require additional consideration.

It is certainly not the

position of the Veterans Administration that all these cases
should be litigated in the State cotirts.

And if a case were

filed in the State court, there would be a question of sovereign
immunity just as there is a question of sovereign immunity in
the Federal court.

33

To determine whether there would be State court
jurisdiction, you would have to know the nature of the proceed­
ing, the nature of the State law and the relief sought and other
matters that I do not think can be decided in the abstract.
But on the question of sovereign immunity, this is
a suit against the Veterans Administration by name, its
Administrator, and the regional Administrator.

concerning the

actions of these officials in the course of their duties.

The

relief sought would require the affirmative action of these
officials and turning over to the plaintiffs funds, property,
money that is unquestionably belonging to the United States,
We feel that this makes the case squarely one against the
United

States in substance even if in form against its

officials.
QUESTION’*

What if there was no request for an

injunction of any Kind,
MR. NORTON:

Well, in the Larson case — I assume

you mean just a declaratory judgment request?
QUESTION:

Yes, against only the officials.

MR. NORTON:

In the Larson case, the Court indicated

that even if only declaratory relief had been sought, there would
still be a sovereign immunity problem.

.Indeed, it is suggested

that there might be a greater one because it could be a binding
declaration of rights.

It has always been said in the

sovereign immunity cases that the action can proceed against

34
the officer, but it is not binding against the Government.
QUESTION s

This would be an interesting decision in

the light of some of the welfare cases, wouldn't it?
MR. NORTON;

Well, I would not come here to try to

square those cases with all of the sovereign immunity doctrine
which the Court has recognized as not an area of perfect logical
symmetry.

But in the cases where courts have entertained suits

against officials-who am officials of the United States, they
have tended to involve property —> land or coal or something
tangible.

There was a claim that the property really belonged

to the plaintiff and that this officer was retaining it against
the rights of the plaintiff.

And the question of possession

could be determined as between the two with the question of
ultimate title, vis-a-vis the United States, left to another
forum,
QUESTION:

Well, then, if we go with you on sovereign

immunity, we don't need to bother with 211 then, do we?
was

just wasted.

That

If sovereign immunity is a good defense,

you don't need 211, so Congress wasted its time,
MR. NORTON:

I wouldn't say that Congress has wasted

its time, because there may be suits that would be subject to
211 that would not necessarily be subject to the sovereign
immunity doctrine.

But in this case, given the nature of the

relief sought and tiie nature of the parties, we say that it is
barred both by sovereign immunity and 211«.

35
The Court could, if it so chose, resolve this case on
the basis of whether the statute is constitutional without
necessarily reaching the merits.

This was the approach taken

in Brooks v. Doer where a difficult question was raised concern­
ing the jurisdiction of a State court to grant relief against
a Federal official in the performance of his dutieso

The court

said that where the plaintiff's claim was lacking in substance,
it wasn't essential to reach that difficult jurisdictional
issue, because they could affirm on the merits.

That is the

position we would take here, that the Court can affirm in this
case on either ground.

Of course, if the Court is going to

reject our position in the Robison case on the merits, it is
essential that it resolve both jurisdiction and the question on
the merits,
QUESTION:

The ultimate question in this Ninth Circuit

case, if we come to the merits at all, is not the constitu­
tionality of the Act, but whether the question of constitutionality is sufficiently substantial to warrant the convening
of a three-judge court, isn't it?
MR. NORTON:

Yes, that is exactly my next point that

the alternative would be the second point decided by the
District Court in Hernandez, which was that after holding that
211 barred jurisdiction, the court also denied the request for
a three-judge court, holding that no substantial constitutional
question had been raised.

Nov, if that was a correct determination, then the
Court can affirm the action of the District Court on the
jurisdictional rule, because it was properly made by a single
judge, as we contend.

Now, the District Court's determination

that there was no substantial question, constitutional question,
was made in view of what the court thought were the manifest
differences between alternative service and military service
and the reasonableness of providing fringe benefits to veterans
of military service in the absence of any cognisable burden on
the free exercise of religion and also the lack of an establish­
ment of religion in the statutory scheme.

The substance of that

ruling really requires the consideration of the merits which
is

presented in the Robison case and has not been touched in

the arguments here.

So I think it would be appropriate to

defer that further discussion until that case.

If I were to

begin it here,it would.be unfair to the other side, although
I would not want to give up my time here and not be able to
continue.

So I think I would rest at this time, but defer the

constitutional question to Robison.
QUESTION:

I take you agree with Mr, Curtice's

response to the hypothetical question I gave about a Peace Corps
veteran who came and made the same claim that is being made
here.

You agree that the District Court could say the claim is

so insubstantial, the constitutional claim, that I will not
convene a three-judge District Court?

37
MR, NORTON:
i*1

Yes,

That is precisely what happened

this case,
QUESTION:

Well, you think that’s true here, too,

but that’s because you think both cases tend to equate to each
other, that is, the Peace Corps veteran and the petitioners
here.
MR. NORTON:

That’s true.

We would say that there

no greater constitutional question presented there than here:
and in either case the District Court could properly dismiss
both the lack of jurisdiction and the lack of a need to convene
a three-judge court because of the insubstantialifcy of the
question presented,
QUESTION:

Of course, here the dismissal is squarely,

as I understand it, on the basis of section 211(a), wasn’t it?
MR, NORTON:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.
With a footnote in the Court of Appeals’

per curiam affirmants that there might be something so
egregiously unconstitutional that the constitutionality of
211(a)

itself might have to be reconsidered.

But this

dismissal wasn't on the basis that it was an insubstantial
question, was it?
MR, NORTON:

The District Judge denied a request for

a three-judge court,
QUESTION:
MR. NORTON:

Right, well, because of 211(a), didn't he?
No, because he said there were no

33
substantial constitutional questions presented.

He may have

felt that he had to do that in order to be authorised, as a
single judge, to grant the motion to dismiss.
QUESTION:

As you know, there is no appendix in this

case, and I have before roe page 16 of the petition for writ'

of

certiorari, the Court of Appeals’ characterization of what the
District Court did, saying the District Court dismissed the
plaintiffs’ complaints for lack of jurisdiction under 211(a),
MR. NORTON:

That is true, but the court also denied

the request for a three-judge court on the ground —
QUESTION:

Any court, if 211(a)

is valid, three-judge

court, one-judge court, or ten-judge court,

211(a) says there

shall be no judicial review.
MR. NORTON:

That is true.

We are not saying that he

had to convene a three-judge court to determine whether he
could dismiss under 211»

He may have felt that it was

appropriate to consider both of those issues in order to make
his dismissal proper as a single judge.
QUESTION:

I see what you are referring

to is the

339 Fed, xerox in the very back of the petition which has Judge
Carter's opinion.
MR. NORTON:

That's right.

QUESTION:

Beginning on page 13..

QUESTION;

Justice Marshall put a question to yoxi

or perhaps to one of your friends a while ago, saying that if

the Veterans Administration had confined educational benefits
to those veterans who had served overseas, that that might
conceivably raise a constitutional question, and a single
District Judge might conceivably, I take it, decide to call or
convene a three™judge court for that purpose.

You would not

agree with it perhaps.
I am trying to distinguish that kind of a case
raising what would appear to be a significant constitutional
question from the one which you consider insubstantial here.
In short, you v/ouldn’t say it wa.s an insubstantial claim if
was
the Veterans Administration /denying benefits to all veterans
except those who went overseas, when the statute obviously
gives no such authority.
MR, NORTON;

Well, we say that 211 bars any review of

a decision of the Administrator.

And on 21.1 alone the District
We don't think it was

necessary for it to address the three-j’adge court question.
The motion was before him; he may have felt it was an appropriate
thing to do not to leave it unresolved in order to make it
clear that his action cn the motion to dismiss was properly
taken as a single judge.
QUESTION;

Let's take an extreme case, that the

Veterans Administration Administrator decides that because of
the shortage of funds, inflation, and a lot of other factors,
he is not going to pay any education benefits to anybody? he
is just going to nullify that section of the Act of Congress.

40
would you say that that would not be open to mandamus under 213
MR. NORTON;

We believe 211 supersedes whatever

jurisdiction is otherwise available under one of the general
jurisdictional statutes, whether it be 1361, the mandamus
statute, or 1331, the general question statute.
QUESTION;

I suppose you might also answer that by

saying that if the Veterans Administrator did that, he would be
fired by the President, and the problem would solve itself
politically.
MR. NORTON s

Yes ~

There are other remedies and

restraints on —
QUESTION;

But you are saying that there is only

political remedy in that situation.
