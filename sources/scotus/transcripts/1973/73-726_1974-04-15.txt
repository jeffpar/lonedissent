P ROC E E RINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear argument next

in Mo. 73-726, Cooper Stevedoring against Kopke.
Mr. Cheavens, you may proceed.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. CHEAVENS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHEAVENS:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

This case is an admiralty case brought beofre the

Court on. grant of certiorari to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
The broad issued posed by the case concerned the
write of contribution in admiralty between joint tortfeasors.
Before we reach and discuss that broad issue, I think it behooves
us first to examine in some detail the particular factual and
procedural context in which this case is presented, to the
Court.
The story of the case, as it were, begins in Mobile,
Alabama, where my client, Cooper Stevedoring Company, loaded
a cargo of palletized crated fabric aboard the vessel.

The

evidence shows that that loading was done under the supervision
of the chief officer of the vessel and the super cargo, an
employee of the time charter.
Upon completion of the discharge, the stowage
performed by my client was inspected and approved by the vessel.
The cargo, the evidence showed, was not secured at

Mobile in any way to prevent it from shifting at sea, nor was
it covered with dunnage.
The ship sailed and went to Houston.

There the

plaintiff, Mr. Troy Sessions, who was one of the first longshore­
men to work on top of the Mobile-stowed cargo — he was carrying
a sack of cargo, and he stepped on a piece of paper which
obscured a crack between the crates which had been loaded in
Mobile.

His foot went in the crack and he sustained a back

injury.
As a result he, first, of course, drew compensation
benefits under the United States longshoremen and Cargo Workers
Compensation Act.

In connection therewith ha also brought an

action against the vessel owner.

The vessel then filed a

rather standard Ryan indemnity action against both Mr. Sessions'
employer, Mid-Gulf Stevedoring in, Houston, and against my
client, Cooper Stevedoring, in Mobile.
It is important to notice two things at this point.
First, that Mr. Sessions did not sue my client Cooper directly,
although there was no statutory bar for his having done so.
Secondly, the indemnity action asserted by the ship
against both Mid-Gulf and Cooper was an action purely for
breach of warranty.
QUESTION;

It was not an action seeking contribution.
This was before the recent amendments to

the
MR. CIIEAVENS;

That is correct, your Honor.

QUESTION:

— Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act?

Today could there have been an indemnity action against*,
whatever it is called,, Mid-Gulf?
MR. CHEAVENS:

Not against Mid-Gulf.

was expressly prohibited by the '72 amendments.

Such an action
But the Ryan

action against my client would still have survived.
QUESTION;

It was not affected by that, yes.

MR. CHEAVENS:

Those amendments would merely have

said that. Mr. Sessions no longer has a right to recover against
the vessel for unseaworthiness.
QUESTION;

He must prove negligence.

Uh~hmm.

MR. CHEAVENS:

But having proved negligence„ the

vessel would still be free to prosecute either in that action
on in a separate case, an action for indemnity against Cooper.
QUESTION:

Against you, but not against Mid-Gulf.

MR. CHEAVENS;

That's correct.

QUESTION;

Under the amendment law.

QUESTION;

So now Sessions has to go under the Jones

Act basically?
MR. CHEAVENS:

No.

The Jones Act gives a right of

recovery for employees —
QUESTION:

Seamen.

MR. CHEAVENS:

That's correcto

But only an action for negligence against

MRo CHEAVENS;

Only an action for negligence against

that’s his sole action — against the vessel.
QUESTION;

Against the ship.

But that’s not a Jones

Act because he’s not a seaman.
MR, CHEAVENS;

No, because he is not a member of the

crew of the vessel.
Shortly before the trial of the case, Mid-Gulf, the
Houston stevedore, took over the defense of the vessel and in
so doing it agreed to indemnify the vessel fully.
Now, this point has been challenged in Respondents5
brief,
record.

They have asserted that no place does this appear of
I would cite the Court to page 118 of the Appendix

where Mr, Smith testified concerning this.
made a specific fact-finding on page 164.

The District Court
If there is any

question about it, on the final page of the brief filed in
the Fifth Circuit on behalf of the vessel—the Fifth Circuit
has a local Rule 13-A which requires a refusal statement in

7
order for the court to evaluate possible disqualification»
The circuit requires each counsel to state who the real party
in interest in the case is.

That refusal statement says:

Texas Employers Insurance Association, which the record shows
.is Mid-Gulf's insurer ■— "Texas Employers Insurance Association
is obligated by a contract of indemnity to pay any final
judgment which may be rendered against the Appellees and
cross Appellants in this case."

The Appellees and cross

Appellants in the Fifth Circuit, of course, being the vessel.
Upon conclusion of the trial of the case, the District Court
made these findings;

The vessel was found unseaworthv and

the vessel owner negligent in three respects; first, in the
failure to secure the crates in Mobile; secondly, in failure
to dunnage off the cargo; and thirdly, because of the presence
of this piece of paper which obscured the dangerous condition.
The District Court also found that Cooper was
negligent with respect, to the failure to dunnage off and the
failure to secure.
Now, I think it's important at this point to carefully
examine the precise legal significance of those findings.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The Court will resume

at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[Whereupon, at 3 o'clock p.m., the oral argument in
the above-entitled matter was recessed, to recommence
on Tuesday, April 16, 1974.]
