PROCEEDINGS

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first this morning in No. 73-157, Calero-Toledo against Pearson
Yacht Leasing Company.
Mr. Coleman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LYNN R. COLEMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEIIALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. COLEMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
My name is Lynn Coleman.

I appear as Special

Counsel for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, both of the
appellants in this case being officials of the Commonwealth.
This is an appeal from a decision of the District
Court of Puerto Rico, sitting as a three-judge court, which
declared unconstitutional a portion of the Controlled
Substances Act of the Commonwealth, as well as the Uniform
Seizure and Forfeiture Statute of the Commonwealth,
The ground for this decision was that these
provisions were unconstitutional on their face, in that they
failed to provide for notice and an opportunity for hearing
prior to a seizure in connection with the forfeiture
proceeding, and that, from the substantive standpoint, they
provided for the taking of the property of a person who is
innocent of the crime for which the property was seized.
And the court, in so holding, relied on two fairly recent

4
decisions of this Court, Fuentes vs. Shevin, and Coin and
Currency.
The particular — a brief statement of the facts
involved would be that the Pearson Yacht Leasing Company
leased a yacht to a man named Olson, which in our brief we
have referred to as the lessee.

The lease is, in many

respect^ similar to a conditional sale, in that the lessee
would enjoy full possession of the vessel.
for a five-year term.
rent.

The lease was

The lessee had the obligation to pay

That obligation would not cease in the event anything

happened to the boat, specifically indicating that forfeiture
would be one of the events which would not interrupt the
lessee’s obligation to pay rent.

The lessee had to insure

the interest of the lessor against all eventualities.

The

lessee was obliged to use the boat only for lawful purposes,
and the like.
It contained provisions which you would expect to
find in a conditional-sale contract, or in a conventional
mortgage, if the seller of the product had elected to allow
his vendee to take title and instead reserve a purely
security interest.
QUESTION: Are you suggesting, Mr. Coleman, that
if there were a mortgage, if there had been a full transfer
and a mortgage back, that is, the title had passed and the
mortgage back, that this forfeiture would then wipe out the

5

underlying security?
HR. COLEMANj

I don't know whether it would have

in this case, Your Honor. The court below treated the
lessor as if he were the owner of the vessel and really did
not examine the kind of a case which he would have, where
you have parties, both of whom have some interest in the
vessel.
I think that the effect of the Puerto Rican
statute and many other statutes, both of the United States
and other States, could be to, in a forfeiture proceeding,
to forfeit effectively the interest of a mortgagor.
QUESTIONS

Isn't it right in this case, Mr.

Coleman, the lessee could buy the thing for a dollar at the
end of —
MR. COLEMAN:

Yes, one dollar at the end of

five years; that's true.
QUESTION:

Which is virtually indistinguishable

from a conditional sale.
MR. COLEMAN:

I think that's true.

In any event, the lessee was found in possession of
marihuana.

Presumably lie was arrested and criminal

proceedings were instituted against him,
Some time after that discovery of marihuana on the
vessel it was seized pursuant to the statute.
operates in this ways

The statute

there must be a determination by a high

6
government official, either the Superintendent of Police for
the entire island, the Attorney General of the Department,
or the Secretary-Treasurer in Puerto Rico, that there has
been an offense for which the property becomes forfeitable.
The offense is described in the Controlled Substances
Act.
Process is issued by such officer, and, pursuant
to that, the vessel is seized without notice.

Within fifteen

days —- immediately, notice is to be given within —- and it's
to be given to all owners, all persons who are known to have
an interest.

Within fifteen days they can challenge the

seizure and forfeiture by instituting proceedings in the
Commonwealth courts.
The lessee was notified.

He was on record with the

Puerto Rican authorities as the owner of the boat.

The

Puerto Rican authorities presumably had no knowledge of the
lessor's interest.
The lessor, consequently, was not notified? did not
discover the seizure and forfeiture of the vessel until some
months later, when it elected to sue in federal court rather
than in the Commonwealth courts pursuant to the statute.
QUESTION:

Under the Puerto Rican statute could

someone having a property interest in the vessel, who was
not in possession of it, had registered under this Puerto
Rican statute and then been notified at the time of the

7
forfeiture?
HR. COLEMANs

I believe so.

I think that registra­

tion statute, the form which there is for registration
provides for other owners.

The record is really silent on

that, though, Your Honor.
Before proceeding to the burden of my argument, I
would like to mention one thing.

The Solicitor General

filed a brief in this case, which I think is a very
excellent, helpful brief, this past Friday.

It particularly

places in perspective the impact of an affirmance of this
decision on a number of Federal lavs*

There is one thing

that I would call attention to.
On page 5 of the Solicitor’s brief, in a footnote,
it is stated that the statutes involved were challenged as
violating both the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments.
The court below, in its holding, made no distinction
whatsoever.

It based it on due process of law, in a concept

of taking without just compensation without specifying either
the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendments.
The Solicitor then says, "It has been held that, to
the extent that the Constitution applies directly to the laws
of Puerto Rico, they are subject to the Fifth Amendment."
A 1947 decision of the First Circuit is cited.
That case does hold that, but that, of course, was before the
Commonwealth was created in 1952.

8

We suggest that that makes a substantial difference.
Since the creation of the Commonwealth, the First
Circuit has consistently declined to decide that question,
as to whether the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendment is
applicable; so has this Court in the only other case to come
directly from the Commonwealth to this Court, that being the
Forjvaris case, which was decided about three years ago.
The Commonwealth did not brief this question.

Ue

do not regard as essential to a determination in this case
whether the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendment, due process,
is applicable to the Commonwealth .
It has been true and accepted for many years that
due process fully applies in the Commonwealth.
QUESTION:

Well, the Fourteenth could not apply,

could it?
MR, COLEMAN:

I’m not sure, Your Honor,

QUESTION: Well, is Puerto Rico a State?
MR, COLEMAN: Well, there can be, I think, a
respectable analysis made that it is
QUESTION:

before the ~~

We treat it like a State for other

purposes„
MR, COLEMAN:

Yes,

QUESTION: We treat, in judgments of the Supreme
Court of Puerto Rico, on cert,as we treat judgments of the
States, but can anyone really argue that Puerto Rico is a

9

State?
MR. COLEMAN:
now, Your Honor.

Well, I would not attempt to argue it

If this subject were to be gone into, we

would ask leave to file a supplemental brief.

I think it's

very complicated.
QUESTION: Well, —
MR. COLEMAN: There are also problems with the
Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION:

— would the Fifth apply?

If it's a

Territory, for purposes of the Constitution, and not a State -MR. COLEMAN:
point.

YoirHonor has put his finger on the

The question is, is it a Territory?
When the Commonwealth was created, it is the view,

generally, I think, of the Commonwealth, that it is no longer
a Territory.
QUESTION:

I know, but it's purely a congressional

Commonwealth, isn’t it?
MR. COLEMAN:

That's the label that was given it.
I don't think that would be

unanimously agreed to, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

I know that.

I've been in Puerto Rico,

and I know sortie of the controversy about it,
MR, COLEMAN: What I'm suggesting merely is that a
proper

determination of that issue would involve a very

detailed analysis of the creation of the Commonwealth, it
would have implications far beyond this case, where those

10

implications are not before the Court now»

It does not

appear •—
QUESTION:

I still, for the life of me, can't see

how it can ever be a State when it's not been admitted to
the Union as a State.
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, it is certainly not a State of

the Union,
QUESTION:

It certainly isn't.

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

But, as to whether —

I don't see how the Fourteenth Amendment,

which applies only to the States of the Union, would apply to
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, I would not attempt to go into

that at this time.
QUESTION: Well, does it have to be one or the other
in order to sustain jurisdiction of this Court to review
judgments of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico?
MR. COLEMAN;

I would assume that it would, Your

Honor, but I don't know that it's necessary to decide which.
It's been —
QUESTION: Well, so we really don't care which it
is right now, do we?
MR. COLEMAN:

I don't believe you do,

[Laughter.]
I just wanted to clarify that, since the Solicitor

11

has made the point.
, /QUESTION: Well, we haven't,
QUESTION:

You mean to clarify the existence of the

problem, rather than —
MR. COLEMAN:

That's exactly right.

I've hardly

clarified it, Your Honor,
We submit that the court below's holding that
notice and hearing prior to seizure are constitutionally
necessary, by way of this Court's decision in Fuentes v,
Shevin, was wrong.

We think that that is an unauthorized

extension, an undue extension of the holding.
First of all, there is a serious question whether
Pearson could have standing to complain of seizure, to assert
that they were constitutionally entitled to notice and hearing,
assuming such a requirement ware to exist, because Pearson
had no possessory interest in this yacht, The yacht was in
> .

the possession of the lessee pursuant to the lease.
Under Puerto Rican law there is no change of title
in a forfeiture proceeding until forfeiture occurs.

True,

tiie yacht is temporarily in possession of the Commonwealth.
But we do not see that the seizure itself affected the rights
. of tiie lessor.
So we think there is a serious question of standing
initially, on the merits.
QUESTION:

Under the terms of the lease you say

12

that the seizure, as opposed to the forfeiture, didn't
impair the lessee's obligation to pay rent to the lessor? so •—
MR. COLEMAN:

Nor did forfeiture, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

But the forfeiture did change the

ownership, the basic ownership, and seizure did not.
MR, COLEMAN: That's true.
QUESTION:

You say that during the term of the

lease the lessor wasn't entitled to possession, anyway, so that
the change of possession didn't affect him at all,
MR, COLEMAN: That’s right,
QUESTION:

And he had a hearing before forfeiture,

or an opportunity for a hearing before forfeiture.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That's true,
Well, as I understand it, he had an

opportunity, if he had been given notice and fifteen days;
there was a fifteen-day limitation on it,
MR, COLEMAN:

Of course, there's a question that's

stipulated, that he was never — that the lessor was never
notified pursuant to the statute.
QUESTION: Right,
MR, COLEMAN:

He obtained actual notice,

QUESTION: Within fifteen days?
MR. COLEMAN:

No,

QUESTION: All right

13

MR. COLEMAN: But the Puerto Rican courts have said
that the fifteen days doesn't run until the person involved
is actually notified.
Mow, if notice pursuant to the statute is required,
then he hadn't been notified yet; if actual notice would
have sufficed, fifteen — after he found out about it, more
than fifteen days elapsed before he decided to go to federal
court.

We argue in our brief that he really is not entitled

to complaint of forfeiture, either, for that reason, that
he forewent the rights that the Puerto Rican statute confers
upon him.
QUESTION:

Well, what's —

QUESTION;

You say that it's been judicially

determined that that fifteen-day period doesn't begin to run
until there is actual notice?
MR, COLEMAN:

Until there's notice.

Whether actual

notice will suffice, I'm not sure.
But it may be that only notice by the Commonwealth,
formal notice by the Commonwealth, pursuant to statute, will
suffice«
QUESTION:

Now, if that's true, the period hasn't

begun to run yet,
MR, COLEMAN: That's exactly right.
QUESTION:

Isn't that right?

MR, COLEMAN:

Yes

14

QUESTIONS

If one takes the strictest possible view

of the Puerto Rican forfeiture statute, that is that it
forfeits the interest of a totally innocent owner upon
compliance with the statute recognition, what substantive
arguments could a person in Pearson's position make at this
hearing?
MR, COLEMAN:

They would be restricted to arguing

that either the crime wasn't —
QUESTION:

That there wasn't any marihuana found.

MR. COLEMAN:

That there wasn’t any marihuana, or

something of that nature. That's true.
We, at another point in our brief, make the point
that in our view the Puerto Rican Supreme Court would have
been quite free to reconsider a 1967 holding that the statute
would allow the forfeiture of the property of an innocent
person, and that in light of the very strong tradition in
this Court of

giving deference to State court determinations

and there's a particular line of cases with respect to the
Commonwealth, where it. appears that an extra measure of
deference might be justified»
QUESTION: What does the Puerto Rican Government do
to forfeited vessels?
MR. COLEMAN:

Do they sell them?
They have the option of selling them

or retaining them for their use.
QUESTION:

Do they normally just sell them?

15
HR, COLEMAN;

I think normally they sell them.

I’m not advised of that.
QUESTION5

Well, they retained this one for personal

use of officials or something?
MR. COLEMAN:

Actually they retained it pending

the outcome of this case«
QUESTION:

In other words —

I know, but didn't I read somewhere that

the officials are making use of it?
MR. COLEMAN;

No,

It's been retained, Your Honor,

but I don't think it's for official use.

It's a sail boat,

it wouldn't be very usable by an official.
QUESTION s

Unh-hunh.

MR, COLEMAN:

They have not elected yet to sell it.

There's no time limit in the statute on it, when they have
to make that election.
To go to Puentes vs. Shevin, in that case —
QUESTION;

Before you go on, I suppose this case,

in its present posture, would be the same whether they
found marihuana, heroin, or machine guns that were being
run to or from Cuba or -MR. COLEMAN;
QUESTION;

~~ whatever,

MR, COLEMAN;
to the Commonwealth,

That's exactly right,

That's why the case is very important
The Uniform Seizure and Forfeiture

statute brought together all of the seizure and forfeiture

16
provisions in disparate parts of the Puerto Rican Code»

And

declaring this statute on its face unconstitutional just puts
an end to seizure and forfeiture proceedings, I think, as a
practical matter, in Puerto Rico.
If you have to have notice before you can seize
property in connection with a criminal matter, in leading
to a forfeiture proceeding, the seizure statutes, I believe,
are going to be -— have their practicality seriously
impaired»
But in Fuentes vs» Shevin, this Court struck down
the Pennsylvania and Florida prejudgment replevin statutes,
on the ground that they authorized the taking of property,
even though for a short period of time, without opportunity
for notice and hearing.
There the creditor could invoke process of the
State to retrieve property in the possession of another
private person solely on the basis of his own affidavit,
solely on the basis of an ex parte proceeding before the
Clerk of the Court.
The court carefully distinguished other situations
where seizure without a prior hearing was justifiable.

It

also carefully distinguished seizure pursuant to a warrant.
In our view, seizure under this statute, where there
must be a determination by a responsible official, where there
must be process issued, is very similar to seizure under a

1.7

warranty though not the same thing»
And in Fuentes , the Court identified three criteria,
which have generally been used to describe those areas where
there could be seizure in advance of a hearing.

That is,

is there an important governmental interest served, was the
first criteria; and I think that clearly is satisfied by a
seizure statute, looking to forfeiture.
QUESTION;

Was this vessel just stopped and boarded

is that the way this —
MR. COLEMAN; The record does not disclose that,
Your Honor.
QUESTION? Well, is there any contention made that
the officials had no right to go on the vessel at all?
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

I don't think so.

Or is it challenged that there was

marihuana found or not?
MR. COLEMAN:

No.

QUESTION; So, are we to assume that the vessel was
properly boarded and marihuana was found, in judging

this

case?
MR. COLEMAN;

I believe so.

It's stipulated by

both parties that the officials acted in pecunious compliance
with the statute.
QUESTION: And the parties were arrested?
MR. COLEMAN;

Yes.

13
QUESTIONs Was there any challenge to their arrest?
MR. COLEMAN;

Not on this record.

A second criteria identified in Fuentes vs . Shevin
as justifying seizure without a hearing was the need for
promptness»

I think that obviously applies to a seizure

proceeding,
The third was that there be no abdication of State
power.

In Fuentes, State power could be invoked solely by

private persons for private gain, without any determination
whatsoever of whether they were probably correct.
Here, however, there is a determination by a high
government official that an offense has been committed, the
property has been used in connection with a crime, and process
must be issued.
We think that this case is clearly within the guidelines expressed by Fuentes, which would justify seizure without
prior hearing.

We think this Court's decision in 1971, in

U, S, vs. Thirty-seven Photographs, would also clearly justify
a seizure prior to hearing in connection with a forfeiture
proceeding.
So our conclusion is that that part of the Court's
decision was clearly in error.
QUESTION;
hearing that

Well, what if — you don’t suggest a

no hearing at all was required?

MR. COLEMAN:

No, no, no»

I think a hearing, I mean

19
a hearing is provided by the statute.

And a hearing is

provided before forfeiture ■—
QUESTION;

Yes.

UR. COLEMAN:

— can occur.

And I think there is

provision that the hearing be very prompt, following upon the
seizure. I think that satisfies the constitutional requiremenfcs»
With respect to the Court's holding that this
Court’s decision in Coin and Currency is to the effect that
•the forfeiture provisions of the Piierto Rican law must, of
necessity, be unconstitutional because they authorize the
taking of a person's property who is innocent of the crime
for which the property was seized.

We think that is clearly

in error as well.
First, as I mentioned a moment, ago, there is again
a standing question, because Pearson elected not to avail
itself of the opportunity presented by the Puerto Rican
law to, within fifteen days of notice, be that pursuant to
the statute or after actual notice, to go to court and assert
its rights.
We also believe that if they think that it was
crucial to their rights that they be able to show that they
were innocent of the crime, and that that defeat the
forfeiture, that that would be a question which certainly
could be litigated in the Puerto Rican courts.

20

The statute does not say you can take the property
of one innocent of the crime.

The statute is silent on that.

It is presumed that it’s permitted under the statute.
However, there had been two other exceptions
recognized to the statute for which there is no authority in
the statute itself» Those are:

if the property were a common

carrier; or if the property were stolen from the lawful owner.
Those are •—
QUESTION:

But the lower court construed it as

authorizing the taking of an innocent party.
HR; COLEMAN:

The Puerto Rican Supreme Court had,

in 1967 —
QUESTION:

Yes, but in this case.

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

In this Court, the —

In this case; in this case.

MR* COLEMAN:

That's right.

And on the strength

of that decision, Your Honor, this Court said that there was
no other way to construe the statute.
QUESTION:
disagree with them?

Well, we're not — are we about to
Are you suggesting we disagree with the

District Court?
MR. COLEMAN:
Your Honor,

My primary argument, of course,

is their wrong construction, should the Court

view the constitutional requirements being such that this
defense must be permitted, I think that there is

that under

21
the principles of construing a statute to preserve its
constitutionality, they would be required to take a look
at the statute, and they wouldn't of necessity have to
abide by that construetion*
There was an argument earlier in this case that
the District Court should have abstained, to allow the court,
the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico to pass first on the
question»
The Commonwealth withdrew its objection to calling
of the three-judge court»

We are not here arguing that

abstention was required, but I think that there was a duty on
the Court to attempt to save the constitutionality of the
statute if it thought it necessary.
But on the merits of the Coin and Currency^ question,
we do not think that Coin and Currency readied this question
at all.

Justice Harlan there did say that there could be

a question under the Fifth Amendment whether a statute
authorizing the taking of one innocent of the crime could
be squared constitutionally,
to decide that question.

He said it is not necessary

There was specifically no over­

ruling of the many decisions of this Court which in the past
have upheld that kind of a result.
Certainly it's true that early on forfeiture of
one who had entrusted his property to one who then committed
a crime was justified on the ground, which this Court has

22

regarded as fictional, that the property was the offender.
Now, I think, though, that there's significant
justification in terms of current reality that is very closely
related to that fiction; and that is that the State needs to
[sic: attach ]
be able to attack, in effect, the capital goods of crime.
In a smuggling operation, for example, tixe airplane,
the vessel, or the truck, or whatever, may be far more
important than the individual driving it, and if — and is
an effective tool to be able to reach that vehicle.
Now, there is hardly any vehicle in the United
States that is not subject to some outstanding security
interest.

If the State

- if forfeiture of this vessel can

be defeated by an undisclosed outstanding security interest,
then I think that the forfeiture statute's effectiveness
would be seriously impaired.
The people in the position of Pearson have ample
opportunity to protect themselves.

They anticipated the

risk of forfeiture, they provided for insurance, they provided
for continuance of the lease payment; and it is not unfair,
nor in my opinion does it violate the Constitutional require™
ments, that their property be taken..
QUESTION:

I suppose they could have required a

bond of some kind, —
MR. COLEMAN: The statute does provide for bond.
QUESTION:

— in addition to what they had here.

23

MR, COLEMANs
QUESTION;
thing.

Yes, they could have.

Mr. Coleman, I'm confused about one

In your Appendix, I take it, on page 29 is the

memorandum opinion and order of the court.
MR. COLEMAN; That's true.
Well, it's page 19 of the appendix accompanying the
that's right.

That's right, it is in that one, too, I

believe.
QUESTION;

In the Appendix.

Yet in the index part, you state that the memorandum
opinion is not reprinted in the appendix.
I v/ant to be sure that the print in the
Jurisdictional Statement and v;hat begins on page 29 are one
and the same.
MR. COLEMAN;

That's true.

QUESTION; So that the statement in the index is
incorrect?
MR. COLEMAN;

That's right. That's right, Your Honor.

And I don't have an explanation for that.
QUESTION;

On the other side it speaks of an

appeal from the District of Massachusetts; so maybe you're
even.
MR. COLEMANs

Right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Gelpi

All right.

24

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GUSTAVO A* GELPI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. GELPI:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it

please the Court:
Before starting, I would like to point out the
error in the printed brief regarding, or mentioning the
District Court of Massachusetts, when it should clearly be
the District Court of Puerto Rico.
There is an additional printing error on page 3 —
QUESTION:
MR. GELPI:

Of which document?
Of appellee's brief.

— the fifth line from the bottom, instead of "of",
the second "of", it should be "or".
And on page 9, after ~
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I didn't get that one. That's

MR. GELPI:

page 3 —

QUESTION: And what's the word?
MR. GELPI:

It should be "or" instead of "of".

That's the second "of" in that sentence.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see it.

Right.

Thank you,

MR. GELPI: And Idle error is the omission of the
page — on page 9 — to the citation of Fuentes vs. Shevin.
It should be page 86.
QUESTION: what page?

25
MR, GELPI:
QUESTION;
MR. GELPI;

Page 86,
86; thank you.
The Puerto Rican statutes which the

District Court declared unconstitutional facially allow the
taking of an innocent man's property, thereby imposing a
penalty upon one not significantly involved in a criminal
enterprise.
The statutes do not afford opportunity to contest
the seizure and forfeiture before it actually takes place.
QUESTION; Before the forfeiture takes place?

MR. GELPI;

Yes,

Appellants have suggested that there is a difference
in the statute between the actual taking and the moment of
forfeiture.
The statutes do not make such a distinction.
They merely provide for the forfeiture of all property
which may be used or is used or has been used in connection
with a criminal enterprise.
From the moment that the, in this case, Superintendent
makes the determination that the property is forfeitable,
the only thing that can happen is for the filing of a challenge
to that forfeiture after it has been seized, and that challenge
would not be of help unless the challenger happens to fall
within one of the two exceptions which have been judicially
permitted to that forfeiture.

26

QUESTION: Well, it would be upheld on a factual
basis, wouldn’t it, if the challenger could show that
marihuana was not in fact discovered on the vessel?
MR. GELPI:

I don't even think that such a showing

would exempt —
QUESTION: Well, what's the

point of the statute

providing for any challenge, then?
MR. GELPI:

That's precisely it.

I don't see the

point,
QUESTION: Well, there must be some point.

The

Legislature wasn't —,
MR. GELPI:

It does exempt.

It gives an opportunity

in the case of a common carrier to come into court and show —
QUESTION:

Well, that's by judicial decision, that

a common carrier or somebody whose property was stolen and
used for an il3.egal, to transport contraband? not covered
by the statute, that's by judicial decision we've been told
in the view of the courts of Puerto Rico.
MR, GELPI:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: But the statute doesn't mention anything
like that. The statute does, however, provide for a challenge
to the confiscation, and I suppose that that was to allow
the challenger to show that marihuana in fact had not been
discovered aboard the vessel, or some such other ground for
opposing the seizure and forfeiture.

27

Now you're saying that there’s not even — that's
not even permissible under Puerto Rican law; is that it?
MR, GELPI;

There has been no case regarding whether

that showing could be made.
Well, the fact is that once the determination has
been taken by the Superintendent of Police, or even by a
mere policeman, as it appears from the statute, that this
vessel may be used to transport or to facilitate the
transportation, concealment, or possession of marihuana,
then it is subject to forfeiture as well.
There is no limitation, as I see it, from the
statute which would limit the forfeiture to the case where
marihuana is actually found on board.
QUESTIONS

Well, to be a little bit more specific;

suppose that at the forfeiture hearing Pearson came in and
shows, by the testimony of expert chemists, that the substance
found was ground soybeans and not marihuana.

Are you

suggesting that that would not defeat the forfeiture?
MR. GELPI;

I don't think it would defeat the

forfeiture under these particular statutes.
QUESTION;

fir, Gelpi, at page 34 of the Jurisdic­

tional Statement of your opponents, Section 1722 of the
LPRA is set out, and under section (a) there it talks about
how the hearing shall be conducted, and it says, towards the
end of Section (a);

"All questions that may arise", and I

28

understand it to be talking about the challenge, "shall be
decided and all other proceedings shall be conducted as in an
ordinary civil action."
And then it talks about appeal to the certiorari
of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico on questions of law.
That sounds to me as if it is contemplated that
factual questions can be raised in this proceeding.
MR,, GELPI:

Oh, they could be raised.

But whether

that would defeat forfeiture is — has not yet been decided.
QUESTION: Well, what's tine point of providing for
a hearing and adjudication of facts if the adjudication
doesn't have some effect on the proceeding?
MR. GELPI:

That is one of the defects of the

statute, I think, which —
QUESTION:

But in this case you admitted that

they were transporting marihuana illegally on this vessel.
MR. GELPI:

No, it hasn't been admitted.

The only

admission, or the only violation which appears on the record
is possession of marihuana on board the vessel.
QUESTION:
MR. GELPI:
QUESTION:
MR. GELPI:
QUESTION:
of the law?

Illegal possession?
Well, possession under —
Illegal or not?
It's illegal, yes.
It's illegal possession and a violation

29

MR. GELPI:

Yes.

QUESTION: And that's admitted in this case.
MR. GELPI:

Yes, that is what appears to have

happened.
QUESTION: So I guess it is true that in your case
there's no use in having the hearing.
MR. GELPI:
QUESTION:
MR. GELPI:

Exactly,

because —

Because they'd be guilty.

Right?

The lessee is guilty.

QUESTION: Right.
MR„ GELPI:

Now, the decision relied on Fuentes

and on Coin and Currency.
Appellant's argument is based upon the lease
contract between the parties of possible compensation from
collateral sources and upon the alleged failure to exhaust
contractual remedies and are irrelevant, in my opinion, since
they were neither raised nor argued in the court below,, and
have no basis on the record before this Court,
Thus, tire issue squarely faced is:

what is the

constitutional norm required for forfeiture under statutes
such as these in question?
In the court below appellants relied on the facial
validity of the statute, and that being the sole issue before
the Court, that was the only question resolved.
Appellants’ contention that the norm applicable

30

would be that of the probable cause as required by the Fourth
Amendment, would not save the statutes, as the statutes do
not impose that even that minimum requirement be observed»
For example, at the moment of seizure, which took
place more than two months after the arrest of the lessee,
no probable cause existed then for forfeiture.
None has been shown to have existed on the record
of this case.

But even if probable cause were accepted as

the applicable standard, the Fourth Amendment requires that
a warrant be issued.
This record does not show -QUESTION:

Do you mean for the arrest or the

original seizure?
MR. GELPI:

For the seizure.

Now, the record here fails to shov; — oh, the only
exception to the issuance of a warrant has been stated many
times by this Court, and that's where exigent circumstances
exist; which would justify any officer to proceed to arrest,
to seize and to search.
The record here fails to show any such circumstances.
The issuance of a warrant requires a prior
determination by a judicial officer, not by an officer of the
Executive Branch, even though he may be a high officer, as
has been pointed out by appellants.

The statutes here in

question, as a matter of fact, facially appear to permit that

31

such a determination can even be made by a mere policeman.
Now, the danger from such —
QUESTION:

Do you think there was an illegal

arrest there?
MR. GELPI:

The record doesn't show.

And I don't

know whether that —
QUESTION;

Well, you would have to claim it was

illegal to make your present argument.
MR. GELPI: Well, Your Honor, the thing is that the
statute here, the seizure in this case was for forfeiture.
QUESTION:

I understand.

But it was after, as I

understand it, marihuana was found on the vessel.
MR. GELPI:

Yes,

QUESTION:

In possession of those in charge of

the vessel,
MR. GELPI:

Yes.

That's what appears from the

QUESTION;

Do you think that was a — in those

record.

circumstances, do you think there would have to be a prior
determination by a magistrate before an arrest could be
made?
MR. GELPI:

That would depend upon what the circum­

stances were at the time of arrest.
QUESTION;
stances

Well, we've just given you the circum­

32

MR« GELPI:

If the policeman walks upon the boat

and finds the person in possession using marihuana at that
time, he is entitled to make an arrestQUESTION:
QUESTION:

Yes But you're not challenging the arrest,

that's clear, isn't it?
MR* GELPI:

No, I don't even know how the arrest

came about, or how it was effected.
Now, appellee respectfully submits that the
appropriate norm is a hybrid, consisting of a prior hearing
as required by the Fifth Amendment, with notice, except in
those situations where exigent circumstances are present.
And even with such a prior hearing, the statutes here in
question are still facially invalid, as they have been
construed by the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, since innocence is not a defense to the taking
and deprivation of one's property, as long as that property
was lav/fully in possession of the violator.
Appellants have emphasized the need of forfeiture
as an element of lav; enforcement.

But I ask:

IIow can the

imposition of a post factum penalty deter violations unless
there has been an a priori intent by the person that is being
penalized?
Certainly by penalizing the innocent, the criminal
is not going to (be deterred*

It can only force that innocent

33

out of business.
Now, where seizure is contemporaneous with an
otherwise lav/ful arrest, the objectives of deterents are
obtained, and it is constitutionally defensible so long as
the defense of innocence is allowed.
These statutes do not.
On the other hand, v/here seizure and forfeiture is
remote in time from the arrest, no objective other than the
imposition of a penalty upon an innocent person is attained.
If, as appellants argue, the purpose was to prevent
reuse of the vessel in unlawful activities, the delay of
two months in seizing the vessel is inexplicable.

It

merely highlights the true objective of the statutes, which
is the imposition of a penalty, regardless of whether it
calls upon the guilty or upon the innocent.
The norm proposed is not impossible of legislative
formulation, not difficult in practical application, except
where exigent circumstances are present, a hearing; and when
those circumstances are present, then the needs of law enforce­
ment would be fulfilled by the immediate seizure.

But in

other ciretainstances prior notice and hearing should be
constitutionally required, and innocence should be a defense.
QUESTION:

Well, if it's desire to seize contraband,

wouldn't there almost always be exigent circumstances as to
the seizure as opposed to the forfeiture?

I mean, you're not

34
going to get any contraband if you notify the people that in
two days you're coming aboard to seize it.
MR. GELPIs

Wo, but the seizure of contraband,

Your Honor, is precisely one of the things that may be
summarily seized.

Because they are illegal, per se.

Now, there's nothing illegal about a vessel or an
automobile, and certainly if the seizure has to be made,
the seizure of the vessel has to be made in order to prevent
the escape of the arrestee or to prevent some other illegal
purpose, or the destruction of the evidence, then that would
be one of the exigent circumstances which would warrant the
actual seizure.
QUESTION:

But if itfe permissible to have a statute

that says a boat on which contraband is found shall itself
be forfeited, then, presumably, one of the elements that the
government has got to show is that the contraband was found
on the boat9
Now, if they notify the lessee that in forty-eight
hours they're coming aboard to see if there's any contraband
on his boat, the result of that forty-eight-hour search is
that it's pretty well fore-ordained, isn't it?
MR« GELPI:

Well, Your Honor, if the contraband is

there and has not yet been seized, that may very well be the
case.

But when the contraband has already been seized, and

the lessee has been arrested, where is the exigent

circum-

35

stances in requiring the seizure of the vessel when it takes
place two months after the original arrest and seizure of
the evidence?
QUESTION:

Well, so that the boat won't be used

to transport the same thing within the next half-hour.

Is

that a good enough answer?
QUESTION:

Or, to add another alternative, that the

boat won't be there when they come,
MRe GELPI: Well, the boat, in the first place,
Your Honor, does not belong to the lessee.

He — I don't

think he would have an interest in taking it away, since it
belongs to someone else.
Now, —
QUESTION:

Hay I call your attention to paragraph

4(a) of the lease, on page 43 of the Jurisdictional Statement,
that is the paragraph that provides for insurance by the
lessee, to protect the lessor against damage, loss or
destruction of the equipment by any cause. Was there insurance
which in fact protected the lessor for this loss?
MR. GELPI:

From the record of this case, it does

not appear,
Now, I have suggested in my brief that that
precisely is one of the issues which should have been raised
in the court below in adjudicating down below, so that this
Court could then have had a proper record.

36

QUESTION: Well, why should that be a matter of
concern, since the lessor had the right, under the lease, to
demand the insurance.

If he failed to do so, would that not

have been his responsibility?
MR. GELPI; There is no, no, nothing on the record
here to show that that insurance actually did exist.

The

fact — or that the insurance itself provided for -the payments
in case of a forfeiture.
Now, *—
QUESTION:

Has the lessor in this case declared the

lease terminated, and all of the rent due and payable, as is
provided by the lease?
MR, GELPI:

It does not appear so from the record,

but that was in fact done.
QUESTION: But tinder the terms of the lease, the
lessor now has the legal right to make a full recovery from
the lessee.

There's no doubt about that?

MR. GELPI:

Yes.

QUESTION: All right.
MR. GELPI:
repossession.

It also has the right to seek

As a matter of fact, as of the moment of the

violation the contract was breached, and the lessor became
entitled to acquire possession of the vessel.
Now, the extremely, I think, broad sweep of these
particular statutes cannot be more emphatically exemplified

37
than by considering the fact that the possible acquittal of
the alleged violator will not result in the return of the
property, nor in the payment of compensation.
This circumstance, I believe, is — not only this
circumstance but this set of statutes, I believe, is way
beyond what is constitutionally permissible, and the only
words to describe the statute which I could find were those
of Mr. Justice White in his dissent in Fuentes vs. Shevin.
But to me they seem like a barbaric hangover from bygone days.
Unless the Court has any further questions — »
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think not.

Thank you, Mr. Gelpi.
Mr. Coleman, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LYNN R. COLEMAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. COLEMAN:

One or two things, Your Honor.

With respect to one of the last things that counsel
for appellee just stated, that acquittal of the one charged
with the crime would have little effect on this forfeiture.
I don't think that's reflected in this record at
axl, and I'm not sure that's a correct statement of the law.
And I just don -1 think that that issue is presented with this
case at all.
QUESTION: But since the forfeiture is predicated
on the illegal act, it should reasonably follow that if no

38

illegal act is found and determined, that there couldn't he
any foundation for the forfeiture.
MR. COLEMAN:

That would be my view of the law,

Your Honor. And I think that the Court —
QUESTION: As I understand that, though, it's not
predicated on conviction, criminal conviction, is it?
MR. COLEMAN: Well, it is predicated on there being
a controlled substance, in effect, used in violation of law
on a particular vessel.
Now, it seems to me if there is a determination
that there wasn't a controlled substance or that it wasn't
on this vessel, or any of the tilings which would

then,

themselves, vitiate a conviction, that would of necessity
defeat the forfeiture,
QUESTION: But it doesn't require any conviction?
QUESTION:

No.

MR. COLEMAN: No, it most certainly doesn't require
a conviction.
QUESTION: All it requires is proof that the substance
v/as there, whether or not there is any prosecution; isn’t that
it?
MR, COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

I ~ I —

Under the statute.

MR. COLEMAN: The statute reads that way, Your
Honor

39

QUESTION:

Yus.

I mean that's the way you would

take it.
MR. COLEMAN;
QUESTION;

That's right,

Might you not find a situation where

there was a controlled substance on a vessel, but no
sufficient evidence to say that any one given individual —
QUESTION; That’s right.
QUESTION;

—- was in possession of the controlled

substance?
MR. COLEMAN;

I think that could be certainly

the case, Your Honor,
Now, I would only make one other point.

Appellees

have suggested that what we're contending is that the
Fourth Amendment, probable cause requirement applies to
seizure, and then they go from that to say that, well, you
should have a warrant.
Now, that is a misstatement of our contention.
We say that the statute here, the way it operates, has built
into it protections which are very similar to a determination
of probable cause.

If probable cause is required, we think

that the statute and the way it was complied with satisfies
it? but we do not think that there is any question of a
warrant being acquired, something over and above what the
statute requires.

And this Court's decision in Cooper vs.

California, which was cited with approval in this past term's

40

decision in Cady vs. Doinbrowski, I think makes that crystalclear.
With respect to the argument that, why can making
the property of one who is innocent of the crime be helpful
in law enforcement, I think that is self-evident.
This Court, in the Goldsmith case, which has not
been overruled, said that the theory of the law is that you
interpose the care of the person who entrusts his property in
aid of law enforcement.

Particularly when you are talking

about people who are selling property or lending money,
they have the ability to protect themselves against that
risk, and if that risk is there they also have the motive
to try to see that their property is not used in violation
of law.
That is a justification for the statute.
Thank you, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I suppose, Mr. Coleman, that it has

happened that a vessel, with no one on board at all, might
have been found with machine guns, heroin, or other contra­
band, —

MR. COLEMAN:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION: And there x^ould be no verdict of guilt of
any person, unless —

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

I think that —

~~ they could show that the owner in

some way was involved in the conspiracy.
MR. COLEMAN:

I think so, Your Honor. But that is

the only justification for these statutes, and the only
justification for a forfeiture.

I think forfeiture would be

amply justified in a case of that kind, because it's
evident

that some one had seriously violated the law, and

that that vessel had been used in that violation, and it
wouldn't offend due process to take the vessel.
QUESTION:

And that the vessel was the instrument

of the crime.
MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

Even if there was no proof of who —
