MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument next

in Cass against the United States, No, 73-604; and Adams
against Secretary of the Navy, No. 73-5661»
Mr . Hanson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR B. HANSON
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER CASS
MR. HANSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished

Associate Justices, may it please the Court:

At. the outset

I would like to call the Court’s attention to the fact that
we did not receive the reply brief in this matter until this
past Friday.

We would ask the Court’s indulgence in permitting

us to file a typewritten brief in reply, if we may, certainly
not later than the end of this week.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That leave will be

granted, Mr. Hanson, and you may take a little more time if
you need it.
MR. HANSON;

Thank you.

This applies, of course, to my brother Dougherty
who is arguing the oth*»r cases,
Your Honors, we would like to call your attention
to two items, one appearing at page 20 and another at 21 of
the Solicitor General’s brief.

The footnote on page 20

refers to the time the Government filed its petition for writ
of certiorari in Schmid v. United States, and it discusses

the fact that this might increase the Government’s potential
liability by more than $12 million if that case were not
reversed.

I had the pleasure of arguing Schmid in the Court

of Claims, and I protested vehemently at the time that this
remark was placed in the Schmid petition to this Court that
it was outside the record.

This was never raised in the court

below, in the Court of Claims? it has never been raised in
the Ninth Circuit nor in the district courts that have
considered this matter, and I think it's improprietous that
it ba brought before the Court and would ask that it be
disregarded.

Truthfully, they can find out what it would

cost, but they never have and they never tried to put it into
the record, and I don’t think it should be here today.
Secondly, on page 21 I would almost say the Freudian
slip, but I will term it. inadvertence.

In the middle of the

page when they quote under paragraph No. 2, they say, "For the
purpose of this subsection" when they are trying to discuss
our approach of interpreting the statute.

I would urge the

Court to note that this was done in Schmid and it was done
in the Ninth Circuit and here it is again.

We have repeatedly

called the Government’s attention that the statute reads,
"For the purposes of this subsection," and that is highly
important and I am sorry that it slipped back in.
Now, if I may, I will address my remarks to the case
in chief.

6

We are here primarily on a matter involving purely
a question of statutory construction..

The statute involved is

10 U.S.C. 637(a)t and in pertinent part that statute involves
Reserve officers of all the services who have served more
than their, one might say, indentured service, in a sense,
whether they were in the draft call or whether they were
called up for some other purpose.

They served more than four

years and then have extended onward their service at the
request of the Government and then were discharged involuntarily
before they reached a fifth year of service when the war in
Vietnam was winding down, and they were released just prior
to the fifth year in many instances within a few days of having
completed five years of service.
Now, we have cited the statute for purposes of this
discussion before the Court. As you see on page 2 of our brief,
we have set it forth.

And I think that since we are dealing

with exact language, I would like to recite it to you in a
sense.

We say s
"Non-Regulars: readjustment payment upon involuntary

release from active duty.
"(a)

Except for members covered by subsection (b),

a member of a reserve component or a member of the Army or
the Air Force without component who is released from active
duty involuntarily, or because he was not accepted for an
additional tour of active duty for which he volunteered after

he had completed a tour of active duty, and who has completed,
immediately before his release, at least five years of
continuous active duty, is entitled to a readjustment payment
computed by multiplying his years of active service (other than
in time of war or of national emergency declared by Congress
after June 28, 1962), but not more than eighteen, by two
months’ basic pay of the grade in which he is serving at the
time of his release. » * .For the purposes of this subsection—"
"For the purposes of this subsection—
"(1) a period of active duty is continuous if it is
not interrupted by a break in service of more than 3G days
"(2) a part of a year that is six months or more
is counted as a whole year, and a part of a year that
is less than six months is disregarded;"
Now, with that statute in front of you with nothing
else before you, I think the Court would reach the same
Conclusion that the Court of Claims did, and we urge that the
Court read carefully the decision in Schmid.

As you may recall

your Honors, you rejected the petitioner’s certiorari in
Schmid by a 5-to-2 vote.
Now, what has happened is that a number of officers in Schmid’s case, he had a requirement for some 13 or 14
thousand dollars, so he had to go to the Court of Claims on
the jurisdiction.

Certain of the other people involved have
>

gone to the Federal District Court as a matter of convenience

3
because they had ten thousand or less dollars involved and
jurisdictionally they could use the District Court,
And that's why we are here today,

Cass was one of

those who had ten thousand some odd dollars,, and he waived
the above-ten thousand to come here in the District Court,
QUESTION:

Mr. Hanson, is this applicable to

commissioned officers only, or is it to all reservists who
come within this?
MR, IIANSOM:
QUESTION:
MR. HANSON:

In this particular part of the statute All these people are officers, I know.
Your Honor, these are all officers, but

it would be my view that it's applicable to all members of the
reserves who are in there on a voluntary extension of their
four-year enlistment period.
Now, what happened in this case was that many of
these people, officers and men, served more than the five
years during the Vietnam unpleasantness, which was not declared
a state of emergency or a war, and that's why the terms of the
statute, but those have already been taken care of by
recomputation.

It happens that this applies only to those

who had extended their service expecting to go on for as long
as the Government needed them, and then when the Government
saw that situation winding down, they quickly got a number
of them out before they completed the fifth year.
It might interest you to know that Schmid in that

9
case had served four years plus in a previous enlistment as
an enlisted man, and then came back in the Navy as an officer
and served four years, six months, and some odd days, so
that whan actually we went in for his case, we were dealing
with a recomputation based on his total years of service
which gave him something in excess of $13,000 as opposed to
the smaller amounts here, although he is of a similar rank.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hanson, what if there had been an

interruption in the service in the middle of a five-year
period, say of five months, would you make the same argument?
MR. HANSON:

No, because the statute very clearly

states that a period of active duty is continuous if it is
not. interrupted by a break in service of more than 30 days.
I am glad you raised that because that again
emphasises the defining portions of this statute.
statute's main body is defined in two areas:
purposes of this subsection—

The

"For the

(1) a period of active duty

is continuous if it is not interrupted by a break in service
of more than 30 days."

If it had been interrupted by a break

in service of more than 30 days, which is the five months you
raised, then he would not qualify for this statute.
QUESTIONs

Why couldn’t you argue under your theory

that the part of the year, six months or more, should be
counted as a full year?
MR. HANSON:

Because another section of the statute

10

covers it.

The other section says that part of a year of

six months or more is counted as a whole year and part of
a year that’s less than six months is disregarded, this is
for purposes of eligibility in that sense, whereas if he
doesn’t have unbroken active duty, if it’s only broken for
30 days, he still qualifies under section (2).

But if he

has a break of more than 30 days, is qualified, and he is
eliminated from it under section (1).
What I am suggesting to your Honors is that you
will find that you must read a statute as a whole, and it
is not at all unusual to qualify a statement by the language
in the following part of it, and I will call your attention
to 6330, Title 10, U.S.C. 6330, which is quoted on page 11
of our brief.

And that again is interesting because it is

applicable to exactly the same sort of recomputation and
eligibility.

That applies to members of the Marine Corps

and Marine Corps Reserve who are to be transferred to the
Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.
"(d)

It says;

For the purposes of sections (b) and (c), a

part of a year that is six months or more is counted as a
whole year and a part of a year that is less than six months
is disregarded."
QUESTION;

If this statute read the way 6330 does,

you wouldn’t have a problem, would you?
MR. HANSON;

It does read that way, your Honor.

11

That’s what we are saying.
QUESTION:

It reads exactly that way.

It seems to me the statutes are different.

MR. HANSON:

They are different in one sense, but

6330 applies to someone who has served 19 years and 6 months,
so they are released at the end of 19 years and 6 months,
and this is a usual thing in the services to do, and they are
given credit for that -- they are given .19 years 6 months
and a day and they are then credited with 20 years of service.
QUESTION:

The term "at least" is not in there,

is it?
MR. HANSON:
QUESTION:

Sir?
The term "at least" modifying five years

is not in 6330, is it?
MR. HANSON: Well, no, your Honor, it is not, but it
says an enlisted member of the Regular Navy or Naval Reserve
who has completed 20 or more years of active service in the
armed forces may, at his request, be transferred to the
Fleet Reserve.
Then they say,

for the purposes of this they let

them out in nineteen and a half years and one day.
QUESTION:

As Justice Blackmun said, if you had

that kind of provision in 687, you would have a different —
MR. HANSON:

Well, possibly, your Honor, but I

would suggest that when they said at least five years of
continuous active duty and then they come down and tell me

12

that for purposes of this subsection that a part of

a

year

of six months or more is counted as a whole year * then he has
completed at least five years of active duty.
QUESTION:

Isn't it reasonable that Congress intended

to give greater boon, if you want to call it that, to a man
who served five enlistments of four years almost than someone
who had just served four years and had been extended?
MR„ HANSON:

No, your Honor, because those people

are what we call the 20-year group and they have been in for
20 years and are entitled to retire both to promotion flow
and other items, whereas these people are called in in time
of emergency, such as the Vietnam war.

Most of these people

were draftees who came in for an initial tour of four years
and then they extended at the requirement of the Government
and then asked to continue on, and then were involuntarily
retired when it seemed to be in the Government’s budgetary
interest to reduce them.
QUESTIONs

But my question is is it not reasonable

to assume that Congress was prepared, had a different
attitude toward so-called 20-year people and 4-year people
who might serve a little over?
MR. HANSON:

Well, I would have some question of

that, Mr. Chief Justice, as a Reserve officer for some 33
years and still one.

I think the Congress is very concerned

with the very people we are concerned with here, and I would

13

point out one other thing, that in the court's attempt in the
Hinth Circuit to reach that conclusion, they made mention of
tne fact that the SenatQ report involved suggested that perhaps
there was no substantive change in the statute when it was
recodifiedI call two things to the Court's attention:
6330 was passed in 1953.

First,

That was subsequent to the initial

passage of 687(a) which was passed in 1956.

Mien they

recodified these matters in 1962, some water had gone under
the bridge and we believe that the Congress intended to do
exactly what it did.

They don't mention the House x'eport.

This bill had to go through both Houses; it didn't just go
through the Senate.

And the fact that the Senate said, "We

don't think this is any substantive change," is really
immaterial to consideration of this matter because when it was
passed by both Houses, a change did appear, and the change
is the one that finds 637(a) exactly as the Court of Claims
found it.

I would urge that this Court pay particular attention

to the language in the Court of Claims decision where they
went behind the statute and stated very clearly, on page 3
of their opinion, that, "Although we find the section clear
and unambiguous on its face and it’s susceptible on its face
of only one interpretation," they then go on to say, "Although
we find no ambiguity in the words of the statute, we are not
precluded from examining the legislative history underlying

14
the enactment in order to detertermine whether there is
clear and compelling support for the interpretation."

They

then went on and said, - "After a careful review of the
legislative history of section 687(a),1 we

- conclude that

support which it lends to defendant's position, namely, the
Government, is not so clear and compelling as to require us
to adopt an interpretation of the section inconsistent with
the clear import of its terms."
And I would like to add one other thing if 1 may.
QUESTION:

Under paragraph (2) it says that a part

of a year that is less than six months is disregarded.
MR. HANSON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
That would have no conceivable applica­

tion to eligibility, would it?
MR. HANSON:

(Pause)

It would to this extent —

If he served four years, five months and 27 days in a leap
year February, why, he certainly would have served less than
six months, and he would not be eligible.

But if he had

served four years, six months and one day, he would be
eligible.
QUESTION:

I know, but — I can see how — you

might arguably say the first part of section (2) applies to
eligibility as well as computation, but the last part of it,
I would think, would apply only to computation.
the whole section (2) is a computation section.

So arguably

15

MR. HANSON:

Well, again I can only state that the

Court of Claims did review this with great care and they
addressed that argument thoroughly.

I would urge your Honors

to address it carefully, and I think one of the items that
persuaded them — I was about to call your attention to this is the fact that this is a remedial statute and as such it's
our view that it must be most carefully construed in favor
of the petitioner in this case.
QUESTION;

Mr, Hanson, on your view, why wouldn't

the Congress have merely provided for four and a half years
instead of five as the basic eligibility period and forget
about section (2)?
MR. IIANSON:
Mr. Justice Blackmun.
wonder about.

I’m not being facetious when I say this
The Congress does many things that I

But it's my view that there are many statutes

which they describe in terms of this nature.

They set out

what a statute is and then they put a caboose on it, so to
speak, in which they say, "For purposes of this section, we
mean the following:"
here,

And that’s what we say they have done

And this isn't unusual.
My time is up and I thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Dougherty.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. DOUGHERTY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS ADAMS, ET AL.
MR. DOUGHERTY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

16

the Court:

Might I point out .in the beginning,, our case is

slightly different than that of Cass, in that we deal with
three Marine captain aviators, and the statute we cite,
6330 of Code 10,

'

deals specifically with the Navy and

the Marine Corps and specifically with Regular and Reserves of
the Navy and Marine Corps.
As does Cass, we take the position, of course, that
the statute is clear on its face.

First, it sets forth a

standard and the standard is "at least five years of
continuous active duty,"

And then with the preface, "For the

purposes" — "purposes’/ I emphasize — "of this subsection,"
it goes on to define specifically what the phrase "continuous
active duty" means, as was explained to Mr. Justice Rehnquist,
and then it specifically defines the word "year."
Now, what the Ninth Circuit did, I submit, is it
overlooked the plain meaning of the words
defining the word "year."

in section (2)

And it took the first part of the

statute, subsection (1), and then ignored (2).
The statute 10 U.S.C. 6330 uses exactly the same
phraseology, the same words, as does 637(a) and specifically,
as I pointed out, refers to Navy and Marine Corps personnel,
both Regular and Reserve,
QUESTION;
your clients

You are not suggesting that 6330 covers

because 6330 among other things applies only

to enlisted personnel and also only to those who have completed

17
20 or mora years.

So what is your point that your case is

different from —
MR. DOUGHERTY:

My point is that 6330 allows a 6-months

round figure both as to Regular and to Reserve, and I think
that's significant.

And since all our clients in this case are

Reservists, I think it’s significant.

And I was just about to,

if I may, call the Court's attention to a statute that no one
has cited in the briefs, the Justice or the amicus curiae, or
anybody, and it is 10 U.S.C„ 77, and it states that the laws
applying to both Regulars and Reserves shall be administered
without discrimination (1) among Regulars,
and (3) between. Regulars and Reserves.

(2) among Reserves,

And I am submitting

that there is a different treatment of Reserves in 6330 than
there is in 637(a), and that contravenes the statute that I
have just cited.
QUESTION:

Does it help your case any, Mr. Dougherty,

that the statute Justice Stewart just cited to you contains
an expressed provision for rounding out when there is less
than the full period, and this statute contains no such rounding
out provision.
MR. DOUGHERTY;

Mr. Chief Justice, it's our position

that the rounding provisions of both statutes are exactly the
same.

The only difference is between "at least five years"

as you asked earlier and the reference to 20 years.
QUESTION:

Well "at least," those are two pretty

1G
important words in that statute, are they not?
MR. DOUGHERTY:

But if you take the subsection (2)

as defining the word "year", it says a period of six months
or more, and it says for purposes of this subsection.

That

means the whole subsection; it just doesn't mean part of it.
That's the thing the Ninth Circuit missed, I submit.
QUESTION:

Before 1962 you wouldn't have much of a

case, would you?
MR. DOUGHERTY:
QUESTION:

Before 1962.

Well, before the statute was codified

into its present form.
MR. DOUGHERTY:

If you take, what was it, 1016 of

title 50, that was a different statute, yes, I agree.

That

specifically used the terra "for computation."
QUESTION:

Didn't the reports indicate when they

codified it that they didn't intend any substantive change?
MR. DOUGHERTY:

It depends where you look.

The

Senate said, as Mr. Hanson pointed out, the Senate said it at
one time, but ~~
QUESTION:

That's the usual rule on codifications

anyway, isn't it?
MR. DOUGHERTY:

Well, Mr. Lihonati's, as I pointed

out in my brief, Mr. Libonati's original bill in 1956 contained
three things:

It amended, it changed, and it codified.

were three separate bills, not just one.

our brief, if you please»
II, and II to the bill.

They were incorporated as Titles I,
I, to amend title 10, II to codify

recent military laws, and III to improve the code.
So at best, the legislative history of this statute
is ambiguous.
I reserve the rest of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Dougherty.

Mr. Patton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. PATTON
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. PATTON:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

The Government's view is that this case presents

an instance where a mistake was made in the codification of a
statute.
Petitioners contend that the Act is clear on its face
and that because it is clear, this Court cannot look either
at the antecedent statute or the legislative history of the
1962 codification in construing the Act,

And alternatively

they argue that legislative history supports their claim that
in 1962 Congress intended to change the eligibility requirement.
Our position is that the statute is not clear and
that any doubt as to its meaning is dispelled by consideration
of the antecedent statute and the legislative history.

And

even if the statute were deemed clear on a first examination,
there surely is no rule which forbids resort to aids in

20

constructionr and indeed resort to such aids as particularly
appropriate in the case of codified statutes.
When we begin with subsection (a) of the Adjustment
Act, we find that it deals with two subjects:

First, Congress

expressly fixed the eligibility requirement at five years of
continuous active service.

It then provided that the amount of

pay would be computed by multiplying years of service by
two months' basic pay.

Because the amount of pay rests on

years of service, it was then necessary to count the fractional
service.

And we submit that the rounding provision, that

part of a year which is six months or more should be counted
as a year and less than six months disregarded, applies to
calculation and only to calculation.
We have a hypothetical in our brief which illustrates
our position clearly.

If the serviceman has served four years

and eight months, he would not in our view be eligible for
adjustment pay.

If, however, he had served 13 years and four

months, he would be eligible and the amount of the pay would
be computed by multiplying 13 by two months’ basic pay, the
four months being disregarded under the rounding provision.
If he had served 13 years and eight months, it would be
calculated by multiplying two months' basic pay by 14 years,
the eight months being counted as a year under the rounding
provision.
It would be possible to read the rounding provision

21
to apply to eligibility by focusing or? the plural "purposes",
but to do so involves a number of problems.

One, as Hr.

Justice White has pointed out, that part of the rounding
provision which calls for disregarding less than six months
has no application.
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

Secondly —
Would that be equally true under 6330?
It would be under 6330, that’s right,

Mr. Justice Stewart, and with respect to 6330, our position is
that that statute is more clear than the Adjustment Pay Act.
QUESTION:

Well, that's your submission, but I’m just

asking now about this little argument you have made, that the
less than six months would have no meaning if the petitioner's
construction were accepted.

But the less than six months has

no meaning from the point of eligibility under 6330 even
though you concede that that means what the petitioner —•
MR. PATTON:

It has meaning for computation, that’s

right..
QUESTION:

So vour argument would be equally

adaptable to 6330.
MR. PATTON:

That's correct.

Frankly, I think 6330

on a first examination is somewhat curious.
QUESTION;

But at least 6330 refers specifically to

subsections {h^ and (c).
MR. PATTON:
and I think

That's correct, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

22

QUESTION;

But in. this case we only have one subsec­

tionand this statute says, "For the purposes of this
subsection*"

You can’t say (b) and (c) here because there is

no (b) and (c), there is only one.
MR. PATTON;

That's correct.

I don't suggest that

this statute is a model of clarity, and I do say that if 6330
were —
QUESTION;

That's where you differ from your

brothers on the other side; they say it is very clear.
MR. PATTON;
where we disagree.

That's right, ?4r. Justice Stewart, that's

And the question is whether the Court

can resort to aids in construction in determining what Congress
intended with this provision.
Now, an additional factor is that in the Adjustment
Pay Act Congress specifically required five years of continuous
service for eligibility.

A rounding provision would not be

necessary for eligibility, I
in 6330 either.

agree would not be necessary

And since a rounding provision really serves

only one function as a matter of necessity, we submit that the
words immediately preceding it in the Adjustment Pay Act, "For
the purposes of this section," are ambiguous.

And any'doubt

as to what Congress intended is dispelled by consideration of
the original Act and the legislative history of the 1962
codification.
The adjustment pay was established in 1956 and at

23
that time there was no ambiguity in the statute.
required five years1 continuous service.

That Act

And then with

respect to the rounding provision, it expressly stated the
rounding provision would be applied in computing the amount
of adjustment pay.

The eligibility requirement, and the

restriction of the rounding provision to computation remained
unchanged until 1962.

In 1962 Congress recodified recent

military pay legislation, and in the course of codification
the words preceding the rounding provision were changed from,
"For the purposes of computing the amount of adjustment pay,"
to "For the purposes of this subsection."

That this change

was inadvertent is demonstrated by consideration of the
legislative history.

The Senate report states that no substan­

tive change was intended.
While the Senate and House reports purport to list
all changes made in the codified legislation, the change in
the rounding provision is not referred to.

There were no

debates, no hearings, indeed no reference to changing
eligibility requirements.
QUESTION:

This is an argument, I gather, that based

on that absence of legislative history, that we ought to read
the change as if it weren't made.
MR. PATTON:

That’s correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.

I think it!s a little more than just the absence of legislative
history, because, there is an. affirmative statement in the

24

Senate report that no substantive changes were intended.
QUESTION:

How about the House report?

MR. PATTON:
statement.

The House report does not contain that

Basically the House report simply lists the

changes made.
QUESTION:

Including this one.

MR. PATTONs

It doesn’t list this one.

are somewhat confused,.

The reports

The reports list as changes

the

omission of the words "For the purposes of” is surplussage,
but in fact that phrase was not omitted.
Now, another point is that substantive changes in
military legislation are ordinarily made under the supervision
of the Armed Forces Committeesof the Senate and House.

But

the codification was carried out by the Judiciary Committees.
It would have been most unusual for them to make substantive
changes.
QUESTION:

Mr. Patton, what if this 687(a) as you

show it at the top of page 3 of your brief where it says *'at
least five years of continuous active duty,” supposing that
said "at least three years of continuous active duty," and it
had gone through committee and that language passed on the
floor, that language, we wouldn't listen to you now, I take
it-, say that what Congress really meant was five years and
that they simply made a mistake in putting in the word "three.
MR. PATTON:

Well, it would be a much more

25

difficult case.

Happily that's not presented here.

1 think

the reason it would be much more difficult is because there is
a certain specificity about numbers.

It would make it

difficult to argue that no change was intended.

I think it

unlikely that that would have escaped unnoticed.
How, I think when you consider -QUESTION:

Particularly when the report contains

the statement there was no substantive change, one might ask
if the difference between, three and five wasn't substantive.
One would assume that someone in Congress would think of that.
MR. PATTON:

I would certainly hope so.

I think it's in the original Act and legislative
history, there really is no dispute that Congress did not
intend to change the eligibility requirement.
As I understand petitioners' argument from their
briefs, their argument essentially is that this Court can't
look at the original statute or the legislative history but
that the Government must be bound by what they consider to be
the plain meaning of the language.
Now, in supporting of the plain meaning doctrine,
petitioners rely largely, on older precedents of this Court,
many of them 19th century decisions.

If the plain meaning

doctrine was ever applied in the pristine form contended for
by petitioners, it can no longer be deemed controlling.

I

suggest that upon analysis most cases which invoke the plain

26

meaning doctrine do not in fact apply it.

In any event, as

this Court has said in American Trucking/ United States v.
American Trucking, which is cited at page 22 of our brief ,
"When aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in
the statute, is available, there certainly can be no ’rule of
law" which forbids its use, however clear the words may appear
on 'superficial examination.’"
Now, the resort to aids in construction is
particularly appropriate when codified statutes are in dispute,
and at the bottom of page 22 of our brief we have cited a
number of decisions of this Court which indicate the changes
in language in codification do not ordinarily result in changes
of meaning even where a literal reading might result in a
substantive change.
QUESTION:
final,

The statutes were passed by both Houses,

as they now exist.
MR. PATTON;
QUESTION;

That's correct.
What are we going to do about it?

Well, let me ask you another question.
Government asked Congress to clarify it?
told Congress it mads a mistake?

Has the Government

Has the Congress told them

that they misstated what they meant?
statute to be amended?

Has the

Has Congress asked the

Has Congress done any of those --

I mean, has the Government done any of those things?
you want us to rewrite it?

Or do

27
MR. PATTON:

It is my understanding, Mr. Justice

Marshall, that we have not.

It8s our position that the Court

can construe the statute in accordance with what we think
Congress' purpose clearly was, and it is not necessary to go
back —■
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

Where .is the clearly?
Well, that rests on our position that

it is a codified statute and that this Court can look to the
antecedent Act and the legislative history in construing its
terms.
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

I want the clearly.
I think if you look at the original Act,

which had the restriction in it, the rounding provision applied
only to computation, and the Senate report in the codification
which states that no substantive change was intended, that I
think it follows that no substantive change was intended --QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:
matter.

Disregard the House.
Well, the House report is silent on this

There were no hearings.
QUESTION:

So all you have got is one sentence in

one report which makes it clear.
MR. PATTON:

Well, there is a complete absence of

any suggestion —
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON:

How does absence make it clear?
Well, ~~

28

QUESTION;

You have shouldered, the burden of showing

that this is clear, and I don’t think you have convinced me
that it is clear.
MR. PATTON;

Perhaps I have misled the Court.

don't suggest that the statute is clear.
is unclear.

I

I think the statute

But I think when you ■—

QUESTION;

Well, you said clearly Congress intended

something other than what it says.
MR. PATTON; I don't think —
QUESTION:
MR. PATTON;

Is that an accurate statement?
I don't think Congress intended to

change the eligibility requirement.
QUESTION;

Do you say that Congress didn't say what

it said?
MR. PATTON;
statute was passed.

Well, —no, I don’t, say that.

The

I say that the omission of the words„

"For the purposes of computing the amount of pay," was
inadvertent.
QUESTION;
MR. PATTON;

What do you mean by inadvertent?
I think it was unintentional.

There

is no suggestion anywhere that Congress intended to reduce
the eligibility requirement.
QUESTION;
MR. PATTON;

Then you say clearly it was inadvertent.
Wall, I think it's clear that it was

inadvertent, and I hops the Court will agree with me.

29

QUESTION:

The court of appeals agreed with you in

a very persuasive opinion.

The Court of Claims didn't

agree with you at all.
MR. PATTON:

Well, the Court of Claims found the

statute clear on its face in requiring four and a half years,
and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found it clear
in requiring five years.
QUESTION:

You now tell me that the Ninth Circuit

is clearly correct and the Court of Claims is clearly incorrect
MR. PATTON:

No, I think —

the statute is ambiguous

and I believe this Court may construe it in accordance with
the purposes of Congress as found in the legislative history.
For example, in City of Greenwood, v. Peacock, which
.involved the application of the Federal Civil

Rights removal

statute to prosecutions against private citizens, this Court
found that the original removal statute in the Civil Rights
Act of 1866 had provided for removal of prosecutions against
officers or other persons.

In 1948 when Congress codified

what is now title 28 of the Code, that phrase is omitted, and
relying on the legislative history reports which stated that
no substantive change is intended, this Court read the statute
as though that phrase had not been omitted.
QUESTION:

I think it had a little more than one

sentence in one report.
MR. PATTON:

Well, it may have been in both the

30
Senate and House reports.
QUESTION s

It was more than one sentence.

You only

have one sentence going for you.
MR. PATTON;

Welly we only have one sentence,

affirmative sentence, but we have no indication that there was
any consideration given to changing the eligibility require­
ment,
QUESTION t

Except that they passed the bill as it was

written.
MR. PATTON?
QUESTIONs

Well, that doesn't indicate consideration.
Does that indicate that Congress didn’t

read the bill before they passed it?
MR. PATTON;

I have no doubt, Mr. Justice Marshall,

that that occurs in some cases, in terms of the technical
language of a bill.
Now, I would just like to add finally that the
construction which the Government urges is supported by an
established administrative construction.

The regulations of

the Department of Defense and the pay manuals of the services
have uniformly construed the rounding provision as applicable
only to computation.
And, finally, on page 11 of our brief we have listed
a number of statutes which include a rounding provision and
we submit that our construction is consistent with a pattern
of similar legislation.

Five years of continuous active service

31

is required for eligibility.

None of the petitioners in these

cases have served five years, and therefore we submit that
the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
should be affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Patton.

Mr. Dougherty, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. DOUGHERTY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS ADAMS, ET AL.
MR. DOUGHERTY:

May it please the Court, Mr. Chief

Justice, I will be brief.
We submit that the best refutation for the last
argument that all the services administratively construe this
the same way is specious because it's a Department of Defense
order and it’s axiomatic that if the Department of Defense
construes the statute one way, all four branches will routinely
take the order of the Department of Defense.
And, secondly, we submit that the Government has
construed this statute, or should construe this statute in the
same way it is construing 6330, as it has done routinely in
6330 for the last 16 years.
QUESTION:

Well, you have a different situation here,

Mr. Dougherty. Up until 1962 it was very clear that this
statute meant precisely what the Government now says it means.
Up to 1962 you wouldn’t have had any case at all, would you?
MR. DOUGHERTY:

'Fifty-six to 1962, agreed.,

32
QUESTION:

None.

Because the statute was crystal

clear that it applied only to those who had served actually
five years or more,
MR, DOUGHERTY:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And then what happened was it was

recodified and there is a statement in one of the committee
reports,that of the Senate, that no change was intended.
So it's quite a different situation from the language of 6330
which remained, I gather, unchanged from its enactment,
hasn’t it?
MR. DOUGHERTY:

Yes, sir.

But I might invite the

Court's attention to the fact that all these other statutes
that the Government has cited with the e-ccoption of 6330 and
the Coast Guard statute, 42 212, have nothing to do with
eligibility, it’s all for computation.

These are the only

two statutes that have anything to do with eligibility.
QUESTION:

But nevertheless, between '56 and '62,

it would have been quite clear that the statutes had a
different meaning.
MR. DOUGHERTY:

Yes, I agree with that.

But certainly

the tenor and the mood of Congress certainly changed from 856
to *62, the war situation -QUESTION:

The Senate report said they didn't

intend any change, and other reports that purported to list
changes, didn't list this one although I would assume this would

33

be quite a substantial change if they were changing eligibility.
QUESTION:

It did list, one that, wasn’t made.

MR. DOUGHERTY:
the statute itself.

But the best test of the statute is

As Mr. Justice Black used to say when

he’d talk about the First Amendment, if he took this out to
the man on the street and put it in front of him, he would
say, yes, the man should get paid.

Six months means what it

says.
QUESTION:

So does five years,

MR. DOUGHERTY:

But five years, your Honor, is not

modified by, ’’For the purposes of this subsection.”
QUESTION:

I know, but you are still applying this

sir months requirement,
purposes of computation.
MR. DOUGHERTY:

for purposes of that sxibsection, for
I mean, you are not ignoring it.
No, but the modifying phrase, "For

the purposes of this subsection," must mean what it says.

If

a man, a part of a year that is six months or more is considered
as a whole year.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Dougherty, before you

sit down let me express the Court’s appreciation for your
accepting the appointment to appear in this case for Mr.
Adams and his friends and for your help to them and your
assistance to the Court.
MR. DOUGHERTY:
am delighted to do it.

They are all worthy reigns, and I
Thank you.
