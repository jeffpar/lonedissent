MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

All right.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFFER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PFEFFER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
This is a suit brought by a group of parents in
private church schools in Kansas City against the Commissioner,
the State Commissioner of Education of Missouri and the members
of the State Board of Education, charging that the plaintiffs
were deprived of their rights under the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act of 1965.
The complaint is a rather broad-ranging document, but

4
as the case progressed, the issue became quite narrow.

The

crux of the controversy revolves around a policy adopted by
the State of Missouri that to assign publicly employed teachers
to perform their educational services in private and
particularly religious schools would be contrary to the law
of the State of Missoiiri? and that this law *;as applicable to
Title I teachers as well*
The defense was that the Act does not mandate, does
not require assignment of Title I teachers to teach in church
schools, and,if it did, that to that extent the Act is
contrary to the First Amendment of the United States
Cons t i tuti on,
The District Court ruled in favor of the defendants
on the ground that the statute did not mandate such assignment,
and stated further that if it did it would raise grave
constitutional issues under the Establishment Clause.
The Court of Appeals reversed, two to one, with Judge
Stephenson dissenting, and remanded the case to the District
Court.
On the basis of that remand, the District Court
entered a final judgment, the critical sentence of which is
found on page A46 of the Petition for Certiorari, which says;
"Defendants are enjoined from disapproving any application of a
Local Educational AGency for the grant of Federal Title I
ESEA Funds on the basis that such application includes the use

5

of Title I personnel on private school preraises during
regular school hours."
That’s an unlimited injunction that forbids the
refusal to approve any plan which requires assignment —
QUESTION:

What part of the District Court’s order

is that?
MR. PFEFFER:
on remand.

This is the District Court's order

It’s called, Injunction ajid Judgment Issued in

Compliance with Mandate of the Court of Appeals.
It's found on the Petition for Certiorari, page
A45, but this sentence is found on page A46»

The first

paragraph.
This is the critical issue before this Court.
Now, the Court of Appeals opinion is somewhat
unclear, and Judge Stephenson interpreted it to mean, as
the District Court interpreted it to mean, and as the plaintiff
interprets it to mean, a final conclusive determination that
the State of Missouri may not refuse, all things being equal,
may not refuse to assign publicly employed teachers to teach
in religious schools.

Now «—
QUESTION:

The trouble is that your Petition for

Certiorari doesn't have 846 pages.
QUESTION:

A — A46.

MR. PFEFFER:

A46

6

QUESTION:

A?

MRa PPEFFER:

A,

No, I didn’t burden this Court with an 046-page
petition for certiorari.
QUESTION;

Not yet!

MR. PFEFFERs

Particularly with the complaints of

this Court of overbearing -QUESTION;

Is that in paragraph 2?

MR. PFEFFER;

It's the first paragraph on the page.

It’s the last sentence of the first paragraph, before No. 2.
The part, the paragraph which begins on the preceding page.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pfaffer, don't we have something of a

problem, in that we don’t know what -the District Court’s order
is going to be ultimately?
MR. PFEFFER;

The plan.

Well, this is the final District Court

order, this injunction —
QUESTION:

Well, but the plan has not been developed,

has it?
MR. PFEFFER:

The plan hasn't, but no plan can —

well, the plans have been, yes.

As of now, because of this

injunction ■— because of this injunction — and we sought to
get a stay from the District Court, and the District Court
refused a stay, and we applied to tine Court of Appeals for a
stay.

The Court of Appeals didn’t act on it until it was

ready for argument here

7
But, as of now, as of now, the situation is subject
to action by this Court, that public school teachers, Title I
teachers, are assigned in to parochial schools to do exactly
the same type of teaching the record shows -QUESTION:

You're telling us facts now subsequent

to the entry of the order that's under review here?
MR. PFEFFER:
order.

In pursuance to the mandate of that

Pursuant to the mandate of the order.

We interpret

the order as an injunction forbidding us, and this is the issue
before the Court, forbidding us to refuse to assign teachers
to teach in parochial schools.
This is the injunction which we're operating on,
and in order to -- to make sure that this is before the Court,
when we filed our Petition for Certiorari, we filed it with
a two-pronged petition.

We filed a Petition for Certiorari

to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals, but we also
have the alternative to review the earlier judgment of the
District Court ordering us not to refuse a program for
sending public school teachers into parochial schools.
The fact situation in this case, as revealed on the
trial and as it developed, is just one narrow things

we have

here in Missouri, as in most States, the Title I program is
limited to teaching reading and arithmetic, and occasionally
some other similar subjects, like, in summer schools, shop or
something like that.

But basically reading and arithmetic.

8

And the record shows what Title I is, if we look at page 43 of
my brief we find a typical application, a typical application
for Title I funds by a local agency, which is pretty much the
same; and it gives the whole facts of this.
"A reading specialist" —• that’s in paragraph 3 —
"A reading specialist v/ill assist classroom teachers in daily
developmental reading instruction and provide corrective or
remedial reading instruction in groups of four to ten on a
regularly scheduled basis.

Programmed reading texts plus a

variety of supplementary materials combined with pupils'
creative writing and teacher-made materials will be utilized
to extend and strengthen reading skills.”
This is a typical thing which is done in all the
schools, private and public.

And this is the crux, this is

what we’re contending, we’re not now required to do under
the statute, and if we are, the statute to that extent
violates the Establishment Clause.
That is the dual question before this Court.
Now, addressing myself first to the statutory
instruction, I think — statutory interpretation —- I think
the first thing to do, of course, is to look at the text of
the statute.

That is found on page 16 of my brief.

It says that a State agency shall not approve any
of these local agency's projects unless it is determined
"that, to the extent consistent with the number of educationally

9
deprived children in the school district of the local
educational agency who are enrolled in private elementary
and secondary schools, such agency has made provision for
including special educational services and arrangements (such
as dual enrollment, educational radio and television, and
mobile educational services and equipment) in which such
children can participate»"
Now, I should like to call the Court’s attention to
the examples given in the statute, the first one of which is
criticals

Dual enrollment.

What does dual enrollment mean?

It’s stated in the regulations, it explains what
it is;

dual enrollment, sometimes called shared time, is

when pupils in their private schools, registered in a private
school, go into the public schools for some but not all of
their courses.
This Act provides it is permissible, to meet the
requirements of the statute, to take pupils from the school,
private school, and bring them into the public school.
Clearly this is just the opposite of sending the
school teacher into the private school.

So that the Act,

on its face, as giving an example, this is not the only
thing permitted, it’s just "such as", as one example of what
is permissible which will meet the requirements of the Act,
is to send the children into the public schools rather than
sending the public school teacher into the private schools.

10
So that it is clear without further — that the
statute does not mandate what apparently the Court of Appeals
mandated and the District Court mandated, you must send them
into the parochial schools if you send them into the public
schools.
Secondly, the situation in Missouri, where the lav/
is interpreted by the State Board of Education, is not to
permit this, was called to the attention of the HEW very
early in a letter specifically addressed, specifically
addressed to this problem, sent to the Assistant Commissioner
of Education, and we have the response of the Commissioner of
Education, on pages 19 and 20, which, in the light — this is
1967 — in the light of the specific missouri situation, said;
No, it's not required.

The statute does not mandate any

particular form so long as you provide services for the
students.
Then we have another — there are many more, but
another in here -- in the Handbook of IIEW, the Commissioner of
Education, which again recognizes, and I call the Court's
attentioxi to that paragraph which I've quoted on page 22 of
our brief, in which it refers again to the situation.

It's

called Logistics, on page 22«,
It says;

"Not the least of the difficulties in

including private school children in Title I activities are
the problems of scheduling, transportation, hiring and

11
assigximent of personnel, purchanse and inventory of equipment.,
and arrangements for space.

In those States in which public

school personnel may not perform services on private premises,
the difficulties are compounded."
Then, if there is no easy solution to the logistical
problem, to do the best, with good faith, you can get it.
But, this again is a recognition that there is a
problem, a logistical problem.
If the Court of Appeals was correct, that you must
send them in, then there’s no problem.

The answer is there’s

no problem because you have to send them in.
Finally, and there’s more in my brief and I don’t
want to spend too much on it, but finally I went to call the
Court's attention to something which appears in the
government's brief.

On page 19 of the government's brief,

in which a House Committee —- this is after the Act was in
operation for a year.
On page 19, the paragraph beginning on page 19# but
the critical part of this is that the State Boards are given
wide discretion to the form of program they will approve,
and towards the end:

"in order to assure that such programs

and projects could operate as a part of the public school
system in conformance with local and State legal and
constitutional requirements."
QUESTION:

Hr. Pfeffer, the Eighth Circuit, as I

12
read their opinion, said that there was some conflict in
Missouri laws, -that the Attorney General had disagreed with
the Superintendent, and they ended up saying

that the kind

of injunction Judge Collinscn entered was in conformity with
Missouri law*
Certainly we're not going to second-guess the
Eighth Circuit on what Missouri law is»
MR. PFEFFERs

No.

The answer to that, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, is that — I don't believe the Court of Appeals
found it — the Court of Appeals found, as the Court of
Appeals had previously found in an earlier proceeding, where
the District Court had sought to dismiss the complaint on the
ground that there was an unresolved question of State law.
The Court of Appeals reversed, saying it's not — it's
irrelevant what the State law is, the question is what the
federal law is.
The thrust, as I understand it, of the Court of
Appeals opinion is that State law is irrelevant.

This is a

federal law, and therefore it is to be interpreted and applied
according to federal standards.
QUESTION;

But if you turn to A2Q and A21 of your

Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, if you look at the paragraph
beginning at the bottom of A20, "Plaintiffs discount the
applicability of State law", and this is the majority opinion,
then Judge Lay goes on to say, on page A21, this approach,

13

discounting the applicability of State lav/, "substantially
ignores the legislative history of Title I which establishes
that State policy and law shall govern the administration of
these programs."
So I don't agree with your reading of the Eighth
Circuit opinion at all,
MR, PFEFFER:

My only response to that is that

that apparently is what the District Court interpreted, the
District Court so interpreted it, and I think Judge
Stephenson so interpreted it, and it is the only — and,
independent of that, independent —- I addressed that before.
Independent of that, the legislative history and
the constructive interpretation by IiEW over the years is
that it is not the State Attorney General who gives an
advisory opinion, who determines State law, but that under
the ESEA the responsibility for interpreting and applying the
Act — and I cite it in the brief — rests with the State
Education Agency.

And it is not, indeed as I indicated from

the fact that while the Congress was in session it had this
situation in Missouri in mind.
And the — the -- the Commissioner of Education
responding to Senator Long then, said:

We know that Missouri

lav; doesn't permit it.
All the IIEW writings, including its program guide,
and all the things that I've read, recognised that.

14
QUESTION:

The Supreme Court of Missouri is the

ultimate arbiter of Missouri law, I take it, and certainly
the Eighth Circuit here addressed itself to a holding of the
Supreme Court of Missouri and said:

on balance, we conclude

the Missouri law does permit it.
MR„ PFEFPER:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I think

if that were the case, if that were the case, I think — I don't
think we'd be under the case, because we believe that's not
all the discretion which the State Board of Education has.
That it has other discretions as well.
But, it seems to me, and it seems to everybody,
that the decision did not go on the fact that the State Board
of Education was unable to interpret its own law.
The Supreme Court decision, of the State of Missouri,
was interpreted one way by the State Board of Education, and
another way by the State Attorney General.

We initially had

the same *— took the same position that you took, Justice
Rehnquist, we asked that the court, the District Court,
abstain until the State of Missouri, Supreme Court of the
State of Missouri resolved that question.
The District Court said no, because that's irrelevant.
What the State does is irrelevant, this is a federal law,
giving you federal funds, and therefore it's to be applied by
federal law.
That's why we' re here

We want it, we wanted it.

15

If we had been directed, and indeed the plaintiffs
still have the option of a mandamus in the State court.
Now, so much for the —
QUESTION;

Before you leave that, let me get back to

your brief, page 22, where you had discussed the matter of
the regulations on logistics, or the handbook.

Do you have

that part?
MR. PPEPFER;
QUESTION:

Yes, I have it.

I take it, that last paragraph on the page

is your brief now, your statement;

"If the Court of Appeals

was correct, there was a very easy solution to the logistical
problems;

assign the public school personnel to perform

the Title I service on private premises."
MR.PFEFFER:
QUESTION;
sure I follow it.

Yes, sir.
Now, that's a little cryptic, I'm not

Do you mean that you'd have no objection

to it?
MR. PFEFFER;
QUESTION;

No —
The problem, if it were done on private

premises?
MR. PFEFFER;

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

What I am

trying to point out in this, this is a — a administrative
interpretation of the statute.

And the administrative

interpretation says there are logistic problems in various
things.

One of the logistic problems arises when State law

16

forbids assigning public personnel to private schools.
Now, if the Court of Appeals is correct, that State
law is irrelevant, then the HEW would have said;

there's no

logistic problem, simply this law requires that -- whatever
the State law is — the federal statute *— that you must
assign them to serve in private schools.

Then there's no

logistics at all.
The fact that they said, in the second paragraph,
that there are no easy solutions; however, when the legal
solution allows several options, then good faith, we'll work
something out.
But this, as I interpret it, is a recognition by
HEW that you are not mandated to send public school teachers
into the private schools, even to avoid logistic problems.
Now, I should like to devote the rest of my time
here, up to the amount I'm reserving, except for that I'm
reserving for rebuttal, to the constitutional issue.
In the event we are incorrect, in the event that
this Cousrt decides that where certain services are provided
for in the public schools, educational services by Title I
teachers, the Title I teachers must go into the church
schools to perform those services.
We suggest that to that extent the statute violates
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
Now, in saying that, it is important to note that

17
the issue before this Court in this case is quite narrow.
We are not challenging other Title I services, which are
permitted under the statute, including those specifically
stated in the statute as mobile equipment, nor those which
HEW has in its interpretation and application of the lawheld to be permissible, such as breakfasts or medical care.
We do not challenge sending a doctor in, or a hot breakfast
in, with cooks to prepare it.
We are challenging only what are basically, and the
record shows it, basically the same type of teaching of
regular subjects, both commonly used, reading and arithmetic,
which goes into the public schools except *— what?

Except

smaller classes, and specially trained, or the teachers are
given special, additional training in the crash course,
how to handle students who are below the norm.
And that, too, appears in the typical application.
Again I ask the Court to turn to page 43 of my brief, which
is a typical application.
Item 4;

Degree of educational deprivation necessary

for participation.
"Below norm on standardized tests by:

3 months for

Primary School; S months for Intermediate; 9 months for grade
7."
If a student is below those norms, he is put into a
smaller class, that's in the case, and he's given a teacher-,

18

and the teacher, say, will be given a crash course under IIEW
sponsorship of how to handle that case.
Hw, these students who are below norm are not
students who are psychologically problems, they are ordinary
students who are lax in reading, slow.
The best example is the one which the Court of Appeals
gave in its opinion, on page —• which I cited, page A45,
footnote 13 of the Petition for Certiorari — A45 — no,
that’s not it —- no.
A15, I’m sorry.
It says:

A15»

A15, on footnote 13.

Yes.

"The record discloses that Our Lady of

the Americas school, a parochial school in Kansas City, has
a student body that is 98 percent Mexican with approximately
175 students eligible for Title I.

These children are

confronted with a language and cultural problem."
Mow, that's all I want to read from that.
What do we have here?

We have students who, because

they're foreign-born, are slower than the average.

But the

instruction given them is basically the same thing as the
instruction given to other students.
Now, it's our contention that in that context this
case is indistinguishable from Lemon v. Kurtsman, Bariev v.
DiCenso, and Sanders jv. Johnson, where this Court said, You
cannot finance secular instruction in church schools.
What is the difference? The education is basically

19

the same.

Secular, ordinary secular education.

And even

in Lemon y, Kurt man they chose these secular courses.
What is the only difference?

The only difference

between this situation and the Lemon-PiCenso-Johnson cases
is that in this situation the teachers are paid directly, and
hired directly, by the public agency? in the other cases the
teachers are hired originally by the parochial schools, but
paid, in whole or in part, out of public funds *
QUESTION; And you don't think that's an important
difference?
MR. PPEFFER:
difference.

No.

We don't tliink it's a critical

We say this because — a number of reasons.

We say that in some, that the potential for conflict — and
I'm reading now from the Levitt decision, which this Court
decided, last year, and quoting from the Lemon decision:
"The potential for conflict 'inheres in the situation5" —
just as it did in the Levitt and in the PiCansc-Lemon cases.
We show, we argue, and we show in the Writ that
the efforts to operate, it is perfectly permissible, for
example, perfectly permissible for the parochial school to
take one of its teachers, or more, divorce them, sever them
from the payroll and assign them as a Title I teacher.

They

get special training, and they come back to doing the same
thing, but they have now gone from one payroll to another.
They do the same tiling, except they are now under the public

20

payroll.
Moreover, and this is inhere — and this is interesting,,
that they may even be employed simultaneously by both.
If you
5 of my brief.

in the regulations, which I quote on page
Page 5 of the brief says as follows;

"Provisions for special" —> this is from the
regulations, C.F.R. Section 116.19.
"Provisions for special educational services for
educationally deprived children enrolled in private schools
shall not include the paying of salaries for teachers or
other employees of private schools," — now the next is
critical — "except for services performed outside their
regular hours of duty and under public supervision and
control."
In other words, what this allows is for a parochial
school teacher to teach under the payroll of the parochial
school for part of the time, and under the payroll of tine
Title I the other part of the time; so long as it is beyond
the regular hours of the parochial school teacher.

And a

parochial school teacher can be hired from nine to three, or
hired from nine to one or nine to twelve.
Moreover, the — whatever you look at, you have
the severe problem of the fact that a church school is a
church school and doesn't become something else, when a public
school, a publicly employed teacher enters.

That is why the

21

courts which have been faced with this issue in respect to
State laws, and the District Court in the case which I cite,
Americans United v„ Oakey, the District Courtin the First
Circuit said ~~ which involved a State statute, a State
statute — which said that publicly school — publicly
appointed teachers out of State funds may teach in parochial
schools, it declares that unconstitutional»
And I commend to this Court the Court's opinion
there, which is the sole discussion of it, indicating that
the potential for conflict, the law of the Constitution, as
interpreted by this Court, in Myguist, in Levitt, in Lemon,
and is central in each one of the cases, said that in a
situation such as this, it is an obligation to make certain
to make certain

that the publicly employed teacher

does not use his position for the advancement of religion.
The -- the

this Court said, in Nyquist, and I

quote it on page 30, referring to the DiCenso case, on the
bottom of page 30:
"The Rhode Island Legislature has not, and could
not, provide state aid on the basis of a mere assumption that
secular teachers under religious discipline can avoid
conflicts.

The State." — and this is emphasized; the

emphasis is not mine, the emphasis is by this Court in the
Nyquist case, referring to the DiCenso case —- "The State
must be certain, given the Religion Clauses, that subsidized

22
teachers do not inculcate religion."
And the Court found there, in both Nyguist, Levitt,
Di Censo, Lemon , that there was no such certainty.

There is

no such certainty in this case.
All there is is a statement in the rules, in the
regulations, that the Title I teachers may not teach religion.
But tliat alone doesn't ~~ that was also the case in
each one of these cases, all the State statutes struck down,
in DiCenso, Levitt, in Lemon, in Johnson, all those did have
the same forbidden —
QUESTIONS

In Lemon and DiCenso, no public authority

could dismiss the teacher for violating that, such an
instruction.

Isn’t that true?

Because the teachers ware not

under the supervision and control of the public board of
education.
MR. PPEPPER:

The sanction was there, that the

funds could be and would be turned off.

And those funds went

to the teacher himself if there was a clear sanction,
because, for example, in DiCenso, the record shows that a
teacher who wanted to get public funds had to take, write a
written promise of the conflict, that he or she would not
teach any religion.

And that violation of that meant, as far

as the lav? was concerned, dismissal to the extent of being
paid by public funds.
Now, finally, —

23

HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Pfeffer, you're down

to within three minutes of your reservation of ten.
MR. PFEFFER:

All right.

Thank you.

Now, finally, the -- this Court, in Wals, the tax
exemption case, and then subsequent cases, added a new
dimension to the test for impermissibility under the
Establishment Clause.
?

Previously, under the Shemp case, it was a forbidding
of any lav/ which either has as its purpose the advancement of
religion or whose primary effect was the advancement of
religion.

And we do not assert here that the purpose of

this lawsuit is to advance religion.

We say its effect is.

But, in Walz and then in Lemon, the following cases,
this Court added a new dimension, that even if those two
qualifications were satisfied, if the result of the law is
entanglement of church and State, that, too, is unconstitu­
tional .
It. was a new dimension, but it goes back, way back,
at least as far as the cases in which the Court said it could
not intervene in intrachurch disputes, going back to the
Civil War period.
But this entanglement, which is one of the founda­
tions of the Establishment Clause is inevitable in this
situation? you must, in order to assure that teachers who
are working in a church school, under at least partially the

24

supervision, and the regu3.at.ions shoxf that, under partially
the supervision of the school authorities, do not, because
of their religious commitment, use their office to advance
religion»
It must be put under continual surveillance.
must be subject to continual policing»

It

This surveillance is

exactly what the Court held, as forbidden by this»
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Your time is up now in

chief, Mr, Pfeffer,
MR. PFEFFER?

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Sullivan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. SULLIVAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
FIR. SULLIVAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
Let me try to outline our position in this case, as
it has been from the time we filed the complaint.
We say that the Title I of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act of 1965 provided that comparable
educational services for educationally deprived children, and
relating to special educational benefits, must be provided
on a basis consistent with their number and the extent of
their educational deprivation.
We say that, this had to be done on a comparable
basis, across the board, for public and non-public children

25

alike.
We say that in carrying this out certain regulations
were promulgated by the Office of Education

We say that this

is a federal lav/ funded entirely by federal funds; it’s a
federal law, there's no matching funds, no State funds of
any kind.
We say that in Missouri the State Board of Education,
very early in the game, took steps to preclude either dual
enrollment or the mobile educational service of sending the
teacher in, the public school teacher into the private school.
We say that in almost every situation, when the
State Board precluded those two methods of participation by
the private schools, the private school children could not,
did not, have not received their fair equitable comparable
participation in Title I benefits.
We say that in Missouri we recognise that there is
a compulsory attendance statute that the Court of Appeals
referred to, that the Supreme Court of Missouri has inter­
preted as to preclude dual enrollment or shared time.
We say that if we're going to accommodate that
decision and that State law, as the Court of Appeals suggests,
the only thing, and the only other way that v/e can receive
comparable educational benefits for the private school
children is by sending the public school Title I teacher
into the private school, to teach the educationally deprived,

26

qualified/ eligible non-publie school children, and to give
them the Title I benefits in that fashion.
We say generally that this is constitutional for a
number of reasons.
We say that the regulations in the Act have made
provision that would make it beyond any question, it seems to
me, affected by the Establishment Clause.
And we say that the relief directed by the Court of
Appeals and implemented by the injunction and the order of
the District Court is a proper, lawful, and clearly warranted
holding of the Court of Appeals.

MR. SULLIVAN;

Is that it?

Well, if they did say it, they were

Okay.

MR. SULLIVAN:

That's all I needed.

Thank you.

They said the Act did not provide

any particular method, and I can — I think I can quote that.
They said the Act did not provide any particular -- the Court
of Appeals said;

We further observe that no particular

program or service is mandatory under the Act.
They took that, in that part of their opinion, they

analysed the holding of the statute and the holding of the
Missouri Supreme Court, and. they said that in Missouri there
will not be shared time, there will not be dual enrollment.
We’re going to accommodate State law in that respect.
They found no such lav; with respect to sending
public school teachers into private schools of Missouri.
So, accordingly, —

the moment.

I just want to put State law aside for

Did they, did the Court of Appeals construe the

federal Act as requiring, because it required comparable
training, did it construe the federal Act as meaning that if,
if certain programs were carried on in public schools during
school hours that comparable programs must be carried on,
be made available to the private school?
MR. SULLIVAN;

It construed the Act that way, but

only in the sense and in the background of the evidence and
facts presented to them.
QUESTION; Well, -that’s all right.

Nevertheless, as

I understand it, the local educational agency in Missouri, if
it's going to furnish a program on public school property,
must furnish a like program on private school property.
MR. SULLIVAN;

In Missouri, that's right, Mr.

J us ti ca.

it?

Well, it would be true anywhere, wouldn't

29

MR. SULLIVANs

Mo, Mr. Justice.

QUESTIONi Well, at least they construed the Act in
this case to require that.
MR. SULLIVANs

They did, but, as I say, only in

the light of the evidence and the background that was presented
to them in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, only in light of, I thought you

said, Mr. Sullivan, the Missouri law that has an alternative,
dual enrollment, was, as a matter of State law, prohibited?
MR„ SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

That's right, Mr. Justice.

And it's based on that consideration

that the statute was applied the way it was,
MR. SULLIVANz

That's right.

Based on that

consideration, and the further element inherent in the Court
of Appeals opinion and in the injunction, that it only applies
where the Title I benefits are rendered on very regular school
hours on public school premises.
Nov;, there are at least one, and perhaps more, local
educational agencies, that is a school district, as we
generally use the term.

In Missouri, due to their size or

due to their nature, who do one of two other things
QUESTION:

After hours?

MR. SULLIVAN;

— there's one that has no Title I

grant, and they won't request it, for reasons of their own.
They're a well-funded school district. They won't request it,

30
and they haven't.
And that's regardless of how many educationally
deprived are in the private school there in that school
district, they just are local -~
QUESTION: They take care of the problem themselves?
MR. SULLIVAN:

That's right.

And in the eligible,

otherwise eligible children in private schools, they have no
right, under the Act, to request that -QUESTION: Well, are there any school districts that
have after hours —
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

One or two, yes.

Yes.

MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes.

And they have it, the entire

program is either after hours or in the summertime.

They

are smaller districts, where those programs seem to — at
least I'm not an educator, but it seems, as I understand it,
they work in those school districts.
I think, though, it is clear —- and the court, the
District Court in its injunction, and the Court of Appeals
excludes that.

They don't say they have to provide the

services in private schools for educationally deprived

children

across the State.
They say only when it is provided in the public
school in Missouri, in light of the compulsory attendance
s tatute.

31

Now -QUESTION:

But this injunction, anyway, applies

only to the school districts we have involved here? is that
right?
MR. SULLIVAN:
Board of Education.

No, it only applies to the State

That was the only -— and the Commissioner.

Those were the only defendants in the case.

Those were the

only ones sued.
That is — the first section of the Petitioners'
brief, then, if that is the meaning of it, of course, that
if they're saying that the Act does not mandate assignment
of publicly employed teachers to teach in religious schools
during the regular school hours, if they are saying that the
Act does not infer but literally says that you must send in
public school teachers to teach in the non-public schools for
educationally deprive children, we -- of course, that’s their
own windmill that they're charging.
The Court of Appeals never said that, and I've never
said that, and our complaint never said that.
The Court of Appeals said just the opposite, really.
The Court of Appeals said that — as I mentioned before, it's
on page A26 of the Petition for Writ of Certiorari, on page
1354 of the Federal Second citation — the Court of Appeals
says:

"We further observe that no particular program or

service is mandatory under the Act."

32

And that, of course, is what the Congress intended,
and that's what the United States Commissioner and Office of
Education intended.
They presented outlines and methods, but most
particular, service is mandatory.
Then they went on to say:

But, granted these other

conditions, in Missouri they must send in Title I, publicly
employed Title I teachers into the private schools? and
that of course is further subject to the regulation, that
they can teach — of course, special educational subjects for
eligible educationally deprived children under this
essentially welfare act, it seems to me — but, furthermore,
they cannot teach, they cannot teach any course which is
already being taught in the private school; and the regulation
clearly provides for that.
So it's still a very narrow, very narrow situation.
QUESTION;

Mr. Sullivan, why shouldn’t the District.

Court have abstained here?

If, as Mr. Pfeiffer said, that

the Petitioners requested them to do, if there's a significant
undecided question of Missouri law involved?
MR. SULLIVAN;

Well, he should not have abstained,

because we were seeking relief under the federal Act.
QUESTION: But the Court of Appeals itself, which
ended up granting you relief, was able to do so only after it
had resolved what it conceded to be an important and undecided

33
question of Missouri law.
MR. SULLIVAN;

He did, but he — well, let me

withdraw that.
In the first instance he did abstain.

And he also

held that we hadn't exhausted administrative remedies.
had to take that to the Eighth Circuit.

We

was reversed by the Eighth Circuit because, in the earlier
opinion they said this is not a case for abstention.
QUESTION:

Well, but —

QUESTION:

Why was it not a case

MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Judge — excuse me,

Because of the ~

— for abstention?

MR. SULLIVAN:

Because these youngsters were

seeking their federally established right.
QUESTION: Well, but that just begs the question,
I think.

If the Court of Appeals in the Eighth Circuit

conceded in its opinion -that there was an important question
of Missouri law involved, it went ahead and decided that
question.

So, in its view, and the view I'm talking about

in which you prevailed, it wasn't just a federal right, you
had to prove a question of Missouri law, too.
•MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, we proved the question of

Missouri. law, but I still think the basic question was always
federal, under Title I, our rights under the Title I Act.

34

Now, on the abstention cases, and the way the
Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decided this case, under
the abstention cases, never dealt, that I can recall, with a
federal statute; it was a question of contrasting a State law
with the Federal Constitution.
QUESTION;

And

Mr. Sullivan, suppose there had been a

decision of the Supreme Court of .Missouri, reaching a
contrary result on this issue of State law, at the time this
case got to the Court of Appeals,reaching a different decision
on State law than the Court of Appeals came to.

Do yoti

Now, if that has

been the state of the Missouri law, when this case was in
the Court of Appeals, now, do you suppose the Court of Appeals
would have come out with the interpretation of the federal
statute that it did?
MR. SULLIVAN:

No, they would have said either one

is all right.
QUESTION:

We might not have had this case.

MR. SULLIVAN:

I still think we would have the same

position on the part of the State Board of Education, I don’t
think that the decision of the Court would have meant anything

to them.

I still think they would have denied the rights

to these private school children.
As they say in their brief, that —*
QUESTION:

You mean you think if the Missouri

Supreme Court had said that dual enrollment was a proper —

State Department of Education that determines what the
relevant State law is, and they're the ones

Even if the Missouri Supreme Court ---

for dual enrollment.

I would have hoped that the children

I would have hoped that

QUESTIONS

But the injunction that would have been

MR. SULLIVAN;
QUESTION;

I beg your pardon, Mr. Justice?

Well, the injunction that was entered,

State agency to quit disapproving programs for that suggested,

MR. SULLIVAN;

Yes.

Now, if the decision of the Supreme Court

of Missouri had been the other way, the Court of Appeals

widened the options.

And I would have hoped that it would

37
QUESTION:

Mr. Sullivan, certainly what I had

conceived to be the undecided point of Missouri law was what
the Court of Appeals refers to at page A20 of the Petition for
Certiorari, where they say it’s conceivable that under
Missouri law the use of all funds might have been prohibited.
So it isn’t just a question of ~~ that, the Supreme Court of
Missouri might have said dual enrollment is okay.

They

might have said neither of these is okay.
And, as I read the Court of Appeals, their opinion
says if that had been the Missouri lav/, they would not have
issued the injunction which they issued here.
So, it is — although, if the Chief Justice's
hypothesis .is right, and the Missouri Supreme Court had said
what he said, the options would have been broadened, it's
conceivable that the undecided point of Missouri law, that
all funds are barred, from this kind of a thing, might have
gone the other way and then you would have gotten no relief,
I would think.
MR, SULLIVAN:

Well, Mr,

Judge Lay, in the

majority opinion, said — he hypothesised a situation, if
this is, I think, an answer, that — on page

I'm looking

at the slip sheet, 23 —•• A23 in the Appendix, he says:
State lav; must be accommodated, but he said, suppose Missouri
passed a lav/ that prevented —- said just this:

that no

textbooks, school books, Title I aid, any other I2SEA aid,

38
the federal milk program, in the State of Missouri shall be
permitted to go on the private school premises, nor shall
there be dual enrollment.
QUESTION;

State support put all its rights under

Title I of the Act.
MR. SULLIVAN;

There would be no Title I, that's

right, Mr. Justice, Mr. Chief Justice.

That's exactly right.

QUESTION; But that's a State constitutional matter,
isn't it?

It would be an issue under the State Constitution

as to whether Missouri law barred all of these programs«
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes.

And if it were to assume the

existence of such a lav? or statute, which there is none,
they don't profess to — there is a constitutional

there

is a constitutional article in the State of Missouri which says
generally that any federal program can be, will be
accommodated in Missouri.

And that's part of the Missouri

Constitution, cited by Judge Lay towards the latter part of
his opinion.
And. that was —QUESTION:

That's the one, "Money or property may

also be received from the United States and be redistributed
together with public money of this State".

Is that the one?

Missouri Constitution, III, Section 38(a).
MR. SULLIVAN:

Missouri constitutional amendment,

it's — Article III, Section 38(a).

39

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SULLIVAN:

And so I think we’ve obviated that

situation.
But, again, if there was such a lav/, if they
just block everything, or attempt to block it by statute,
as Judge Lay says, assuming that the equal protection problem
would be overcome, there could be no Title I.
QUESTION: But the Wheeler decision that barred dual
enrollment was a statutory construction matter, wasn’t it?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Oh, that wasn’t included in that

The only thing that was
QUESTION:

Well, I understand, I understand, that.

MR. SULLIVAN: The only thing that was included in
that, there was a mention in that case that public school
teachers employed ~ just touched on it in the opinion

but

40

for public school teachers employed out of Missouri public
school funds to teach in public schools, they can't be sent
to private schools.
QUESTION: But if there were a case in Missouri about
sending public school teachers into private schools, the
argument would be based on — what — the Missouri
Cons titution?
MR. SULLIVAN:
Constitution.

The fiscal elements of the Missouri

And I think that was in that same case, but

on.lv the fiscal elements.

There's no auestion in Wheeler vs.

anything else.
QUESTION:

MR. SULLIVAN:

They sav when you're paying a public

school teacher out of public school funds, he nrnst be used
for public school purposes, and you can't send him to a
private school.

The fiscal part of the Constitution,

QUESTION:

But it still would be a constitutional

construction problem, though.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yesf unh-hunh.

There's certainly

no statute that affects us in any degree, that I know of,
except the one that — maybe some statute on public school
funds

41

But, as I say, the opinion of the Attorney General
certainly was that there ~ on which the Handbook says,
points out in the Handbook of the Office of Education, the
opinion of the Attorney General was to the effect that there
was notiiing wrong with sending a teacher into the private
school.
And that, the constitutional provision that was
referred to, that Mr. Justice read portion of, all of those
things were what prompted •— and the inequities that were
consistently perpetrated in this Act against private
school children, educationally deprived private school
children in Missouri for these eight years, or seven years
under the Act, all of those tilings were what prompted the
Court of Appeals to issue its, frame its opinion, and
prompted the District Judge —» of course he issued the mandate
and compliance therewith, issued an injunction and compliance
with that mandate, and properly so.
And I come back, neither one of them construes the
Act as saying that it's mandatory under the Act, by the
wording of the Act, to send the teacher in.
QUESTION;

Mot-7, there was no issue of abstention

raised in the District Court, was there?
MR. SULLIVAN: The first time there was, yes, sir.
QUESTION:
MR. SULLIVAN:

There was?

Who raised that?

The — nobody.

The District Judge

42
raised it.
QUESTION:

But neither the defendants — the

defendants didn’t ask for
MR. SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

No, the defendants didn't raise it.

So the argument for abstention is that

you should await a State court construction of its
Constitution, in order to avoid a federal statutory question?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, I — I guess —

QUESTION: Because that's all -- that's all that
the Court of Appeals got to, was a federal statutory
question.
MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, the District Judge also

raised, in that same plane, he mentioned that we hadn't
exhausted administrative remedies, of which, you know, there
were none.

And that was reversed by the Court of Appeals

in the Eighth Circuit on both counts.
But the abstention qiiestion was not, as counsel
suggests, raised by defendants, the abstention question was
raised by the District Judge only.

And 1 think clearly,

in proper situation, the abstention cases like the Alabama
excuse me, the Alaska Fishing statutes, things like that,
were questions where a State statute

could be interpreted

as being in conformity with the Constitution,
And not a question of whether you’re going to
implement properly the federal benefits provided by federal

43
law.
I do want to mention the constitutional issue, of
course, since counsel raises it and goes into it.
The essential thing is that all of the secular
benefits to be rendered under this Act are clearly demarked,
prescribed, and confined by the — not only by the statute
but by the regulations.
Now, this is not, as counsel would suggest,
suggests in his brief and again today, this is not a case
of general educational aid across the board.

That's not it

at all.
This is not a case of just supplementing the private
school curriculum.

That is expressly forbidden by the Act.

The Act and the statute are confined to special and
particular educational benefits for educationally deprived
children.

They are not designed, as a general aid to

education in non-public or public schools, either one, but
particularly in private schools can these benefits be used
to add to — to replace an existing program.
I think that is made abundantly clear throughout.
Tiie provision that's suggested in the brief as to
the payment of private school teachers is a — well, the one
example suggested by the Petitioners is without any merit
at all, they refer to the Handbook as giving authority to pay
private school teachers.

What the Handbook says is that

44
when private school teachers are attending an in-service
training session,, they can get their lunch money and their
transportation money, if they're working on Title I projects.
It has nothing to do with this Act whatsoever.
The other portion, of course, if a person is working
full time in a private school, then that person can be, if
he is a teacher in summer school in a Title I program, or
anything else, can be paid by the — take other employment.
QUESTION:

Mr, Sullivan, what — you sav this is

no aid to the program, but isn't it true that if these pupils
don't get this aid, they're in bad shape?

a private school, they operate, they do the best they can,
they're human beings, I'm sure that, at this moment, some
public school across this country, there's somebody that's
putting out a little religion.
But we're not •— I don't know there's very much that
you and I could do about it, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION:

Thov get as much supervision as the

teachers that are teaching in the public schools get.
MR. SULLIVAN:
the idea of it.

The Title I teachers should, that's

And it can be — that Title I teacher, to

■J

48

my mind of thinking, can give a sermon at his Baptist Church
the night before, he can go to his Knights of Columbus meeting
the night before, he can sit and watch television, as most of
them are doing, and never give a thought to religion from
one day to the next, and that teacher can walk in and give
his Title I class in remedial reading the next morning,
whether it’s in a private school or whether it's in a public
school, or whether it's any place else that the local
educational agency might provide.
And that is where, that is where we say that there
is no surveillance of that type required.
In Lemon and DiCense, what we're concerned about,
it seems to me, was that Idle words kept running clear through
the opinion, "a dedicated religious person", "a person
deeply committed to her own religion", "teaching under
religious supervision", those were the phrases that I think
were in that opinion, the majority opinion, at least four or
five times»
And we don't

we're not talking about, as far as

we know, dedicated religious persons.

We may be.

The public

school teachers might be dedicated religious persons.

I don't

know.
But those are «— we don't have that conflict that
the Court saw in Lemon that required the surveillance.
It seems to me that we have a much clearer case

49

than the ?lllen case, because in the Allen case, at least in
two of the dissenting opinion, it seeded to be predicated
on the relief that these people could, in the private schools
could select their own books about historical events and
so forth.
We don’t have that here.

The public school agency

selects that Title I teacher, not the private school teacher,
there is no religious test or anything like that.
So I don't think we have any problem at all under
the Establishment Clause.

I think it's well within the rule

of Allen, and I don't think there's any question here about
secular purpose, or even the primary effect.
I think the Congress anticipated the words of this
Court, as set out in Norwood vs. Harrison, that any program
with a legitimate purpose that stays between the effect and
entanglement problem, is constitutional under the Establishment
Clause, and that's vjhat the Congress did here, and that's
what the Office of Education requires in all of its
regulations.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think your time is up

now, Mr. Sullivan.
MR. SULLIVAN: Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITES STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
At the outset I would like just briefly to explain
to the Court how Title I of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965 operates, because I think that is
crucial to the case.
The statute was passed because of a recognition
by the President and the Congress that there were a large
number, literally millions, of educationally deprived
children in this country who, because of lack of adequate
education, would not be able to assume their rightful and
proper place in American society.
And the basic purpose of this statute, as described
in the Congressional Declaration of Policy at the outset of
the statute, was to enable the local educational authority
to meet the special educational needs of educationally
deprived children.
The focus of the Act, the 'way the Act is created, is
to turn over vast amounts of federal money to the State
educational authorities in order to collect, in order to
improve the deficiencies that existed in the education of
these educationally deprived children. And it deals with
children who come from poverty.

The basic touchstone for

51

getting the aid is that the children must come from areas
of the city or the country where the income level is low.
Mow, the plan,, as it's envisaged, basically is as
follows;
The States initially apply to the Commissioner of
Education for authorisation, a rather simple document which
they all filed, and these documents were approved eight or
nine years ago, saying they wished to participate in the
program, and they will meet the statutory standards.
The statutory standards are very general.

What is

says basically is that the State educational authorities
shall approve applications filed by local authorities, which
are consistent with the guidelines promulgated by the
Commissioner of Education.
The Commissioner of Education has promulgated guidelines.

The statute leaves it to the informed discretion of

the local educational authorities, the local boards of
education, to determine what is the most appropriate method,
the most effective method for meeting the special educational
needs of these educationally deprived children.
QUESTION:

At the —

While you're doing that, I take it,

Mr. Friedman, though, within any limitations that may be
imposed by State lav/.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION: That is, I mean the local educational

52
authorities.
HR, FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

The local educational authorities —

They have to adhere to State law, do

they not?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

— have to adhere to State law, and,

indeed, the regulation specifically recognize and contemplate
that --- and recognizes that because of certain requirements
of State law there may be situations where particular programs
have to be worked out.
But the programs, of course, are all supplementary
services.

These basically are services that x^ould not be

provided in the schools, public and private, under the
school's normal operating procedure.
These are children who are not able to meet, who are
not able to meet the normal standards.

The regulations of the

Commissioner define an educationally deprived child as one
whose educational achievements do not reach the level
customarily associated with children of this age group.
This is the basic part, the basic thrust of the
statute is to help bring the level of all the children up;
and of course the statute is not, in any way, directed to aiding
schools, the statute is designed to help the problem of trie
children.

And the statute, unlike those that this Court had

before it in some of these other cases, is not in any way
designed to aid the private schools.

These are not cases

53

such as Lemon, DiCenso, Hyquisfc, in which the State has
decided that the private schools have a serious financial
problem and they need an infusion of government aid to keep
them going.

This is a statute in which Congress decided that

the children, not schools, children need help.

Children need

help to enable them to achieve their rightful place in
America.
And the Congress recognised that these children who
need help are not only in the public schools, they're also
in the private schools.

Poverty draws no lines between the

public and the private schools.

Religiously affiliated

schools have just as many as poor children as the public
schools.

The very, in this very case, tine two parochial

schools involved are in the ghetto of the city of Kansas
City.
QUESTION:

Well, and affluent people have just as

many people with reading problems as poor, in general, do
they not?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

It’s unfortunate it's a

condition \tfhich draws no lines, it’s a condition that can
happen.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

I 'think we'll resume

there after lunch, Mr, Friedman.
[Whereupon, at 12 o'clock, noon, the Court was
recessed, to reconvene at IsOO p.m., the same day.]

54

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1;00 p.m.]
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr, Friedman, you have

about ten minutes left, I see.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR. FRIEDMAN;

~ [Resumed]

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
I'd like to continue briefly with my discussion of
the way that the statute operates, and the next point I’d like
to make is that this program is completely under the control
of the public authorities.

It is the local school district

and the State educational authorities, that formulate the
plans, tlie State educational authorities review the plans
for compliance with -the standards.

The teachers who provide

these services are all employees of the public school agencies,
they're no teachers provided these schools who are employed
by any of the religiously affiliated schools.
The teachers are subject to the control and
supervision of the public school authorities, not under the
control of the private school authorities.
And of course, and I think it's been clear — it's
clear by now, there are no funds at all under this statute
paid to the private schools.

The funds are. all paid to the

55

State, and it’s the State who provides these services,
Wow, in addition to that, the vast bulk of these
services go to ~~
QUESTION:

Mr. Friedman, did you say -- does the

law require that only public school teachers be used?
For example, could a local board of education
employ some trained professional in teaching in a parochial
school?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

Not

they could only —• they

could only employ them, for example, during, say, in a
summer situation.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR, FRIEDMAN:

I think — let me explain that if

I may, Mr, Justice, the way it is set up.
The actual control of the teachers, the actual
content of the program is all handled by the local authorities
Now, to the extent, I suppose, that State law would
permit, the State public authorities to hire someone who is
teaching in the parochial school part time, during the summer,
to conduct remedial reading program, I would see no problem
to that.
But what they cannot do is they cannot say a teacher
who is teaching in one of the parochial schools — You are
to spend part of your time now providing these Title I
services.

The services must be provided, by the public school

56

teacher*
QUESTION:

You mean the people on the local

educational agency's payroll?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

Yes.

QUESTION: Well, couldn't a State or its sub­
division hire a teacher who did nothing else but this, didn't
have any other teaching duties in the public school, but
taught only remedial reading, went around, maybe, to various
public schools and did so?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

I'm sorry,

perhaps I misspoke myself.
QUESTION:

Or perhaps I missed it.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I am not suggesting that they have

to be regularly otherwise utilized teachers in the public
schools.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

They could certainly, I am sure —

QUESTION: And many of them in fact are, aren't
they?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

But they —

Hired for this purpose alone.

MR. FRIEDMAN: For this purpose alone,
QUESTION: Right.
MR. FRIEDMAN; But they are employees of the public
school authority; that's the point I wanted to make, to get to.

57

QUESTIONt Right.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

Now, the vast bulk of the children who are receiving
the benefits of these services are enrolled in the public
schools, the indication we have is that approximately only
five percent of the children who are receiving the benefits
of these services are in fact enrolled in the private schools.
Now, one other thing I think is important.

In

contrast to the situation with the plans involved in the Lemon
case, in the Lemon case the grants were made for the provision
of secular educational services, and therefore you had the
excessive government involvement

I'd like to stress that

the standard this Court has always recognized is excessive
government involvement.

There may be situations where there

is some government involvement, but the thing is there cannot
be excessive government involvement.
4

QUESTION:

The others used the phrase "entanglement"

rather than "involvement", it may mean the same thing, but
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Entanglement, yes.

I stand

corrected, Mr, Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

-— it has other connotations.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Excessive government entanglement.

There, in the Lemon type of situation, it was
necessary for the State to subject the activities in the
religious schools to surveillance, to be sure that the

58
tesellers who were being subsidised, or the school, the money
which the school was receiving was used solely for secular
purposes.

And that was one of the serious vices that this

Court found in the Lemon case.
Here, there's no use at all of any moneys possible
for that purpose, and the educational authorities, the State
authorities do not have to make any determination what is
secular, what is sectarian, whether the teachers are strictly
observing the limitations; that the parochial school teachers,
when they are paid with the State funds are in fact limiting
themselves to secular services.

There's not that problem in

this case.
Because here what you're having, basically, as I
have indicated, is the provisional supplemental services,
namely, remedial reading, remedial mathematics, speech, that
kind of thing, which is necessary to bring the children up to
a decent educational level.
Now, I'd like to turn now to the question of the
— the statutory question in the. case, and there's been a lot
of discussion here as to what the Court of Appeals held in this
case.
The actual holding on the issue of what is permitted
or required under the statute, I think is set forth in the
first sentence of page A25 to the Petition for Certiorari,
and what the Court said at the top of the page is:

59

"Thus, we find that when the need of educationally
disadvantaged children requires it, Title I authorizes”
authorizes, not requires --

"Title I authorizes special

teaching services, as contemplated within the Act and regula­
tions, to be furnished by the public agency on private as well
as public school premises»"
I think what the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION: Well, what about the next sentence?
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, what the Court is saying, I
think, Mr, Justice, is that there is a requirement under the
Act that the services provided be comparable, and if the only
way in which the State is providing the services is by
providing them during hours, during the school hours, on the
premises of the public school, that the children regularly
attends, then they have to provide comparable services in the
private schools, to send the teachers on.
But

— but, as this case now stands, we don’t know

what the State of Missouri is going to formulate in the way
of a plan.

Perhaps — perhaps the State of Missouri may

now decide, in the light of these decisions

in the decision

of this case, that it will provide these services in the
public schools after hours.

And if it provides them in the

public schools after hours, under the injunction issued by
the District Court it is not required also to provide these
services in the private schools after hours.

60

Or, conceivably, the State of Missouri may now
decide -QUESTION:

I know, but the claim is the State

shouldn't have to respond to an injunction like this.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, but, Mr* Justice, that is because
of the *— the reason, the reason the State has to respond to
this is because of the requirement in the statute that it's
comparable, that they have to provide comparable service*
QUESTION:

I know, but part of the issue is whether

comparability, as used in the Act, requires that the programs
be furnished on the premises of private schools if they are
furnished on the premises of public schools.

That's part of

the issue here.
MR. FRIEDMAN: That is part of the issue, Mr. Justice,
but we don't know — we don't know at this time:

one, whether

the State is going to undertake to furnish them on that basis?
or, two, precisely how it's going to furnish them.
It — in this case, it strikes me as a somewhat
strange situation. The Court of Appeals specifically declined
to rule on the constitutionality of these, this issue,
because, it said, we have no precise plan before us. We don't
know exactly how these services are going to be provided.
Or, as they described it, as a conjectural hypothetical
state of facts.
QUESTION: Well, do you think the injunction that

61

was issued in compliance with the mandate was consistent with
the opinion of the Court of Appeals?
MR, FRIEDMAN:

Yes, I do,

I do, Mr. Justice.

I think the District Court has interpreted the opinion of
the Court of Appeals as saying that if you provide services
on the public school premises, which the child customarily
attends, that is, in the school where the child attends,
and if this is done during regular school hours, in the light
of testimony that when you had that kind of a situation after
hours or Saturdays or summer school, is not educationally
comparable in that one situation, the Court of Appeals said
that it is necessary to provide similar services in the
private schools.
QUESTION:

Let’s see if I get this, Mr. Friedman.

Looking at A46, this is the modified injunction
consistent with the Court of Appeals opinion.
"Defendants are enjoined from disapproving any
application

... on the basis that such application includes

>

the use of Title I personnel on private school premises during
regular school hours."
And what you’re suggesting is that the Missouri
authorities may, in fact, go, say, to a dual enrollment way
of complying with the statute.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

If that’s permissible under State law.
And that if they did so, then they

62

would not be violating this injunction,
MR, FRIEDMAN:
QUESTION:

I believe that's correct, Mr. Justice

Unh~hunh.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I see my tine has expired.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, Friedman.

Mr. Pfeffer, you have ten minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEO PFEFFER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PFEFFER:

Thank you, Hr. Chief Justice,

May it please the Court:
I must take exception to the last statement made by
Mr. Friedman.

It seems to me that this is ■— the mandate

of the District Court is clear and ambiguous, and it leaves us
no options.
It says:

"Defendants are enjoined from disapproving

any application of a Local Educational Agency ... on the
basis that such application includes the use of Title I
personnel on private school premises during regular school
hours."
There's no way of interpreting this to allow shared
time.

Shared time would certainly

not within this.

or dual enrollment is

It's not — use of private school premises -

QUESTION:
it's not within this.

Well, that’s just the point of this,
And if an application is submitted that

63

says:

the way we propose to enforce the program is on dual

enrollment.

Then it's not an application which states that

it's going to use personnel on private school premises during
regular school hours.
MR. PFEFFER:
rejected.

And therefore it would have to be

It would have to be rejected, because we are

enjoined, we're enjoined from doing anything but sending
public school teachers into private schools during school
hours.
Anything else, this is the — we are enjoined from
doing that.
Now, there was one other point I wanted to make
in respect to that.
I would like to call the Court's attention to the
fact that we do not concede that the only permissible
alternatives under the Act are dual enrollment and sending
teachers in.
We call the Court's attention to the statute,
the language of the statute, which is on page 3 of our brief,
which says — what I'd like to call the Court's attention to
is at the bottom of the page — it's not page 3

page 3

of the Petition for Certiorari is just as good.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MR. PFEFFER: Yes, page 3.
the Petition for Certiorari.

I'm sorry, page 3 of

64

Sorry. Petition for Certiorari.
It says, dealing with private schools!

"such as

dual enrollment, educational radio and television, and mobile
educational services and equipment".
I respectfully suggest that the statute does not
limit, and there is no basis for saying that the only
alternatives open to a State are either sending the public
school teacher in or dual enrollment.
The "such as" indicates that these are illustrative
of things which are permissible.
Another point I should like to make, and this is in
response to a statement made by Mr. Sullivan, in response to
a question by a member of the Court;

that if the State of

Missouri, the Supreme Court of the State of Missouri had
ruled, for example, that dual enrollment under Title I is
not inconsistent with State lav/, the State Board of
Education takes the position it could ignore that, and deem
itself to be the only judge.
I think that obviously is not so.

Of course, we

are a State agency, we're subject to the judgments of the
State Supreme Court, and, indeed, our position is based upon
our interpretation of the State Supreme Court decision.
If the State Supreme Court says to us, it is not a
violation of State law to do your dual enrollment or sending
teachers in.

We're bound by that.

If not, there will be a

65

judgment of contempt against us.
We say only that in between, in respect, the
relationship, the intergovernmental relationship between the
State of Missouri and the United States Office of Education,
that the initial responsibility of determining State law
rests with the State Board of Education.
Now, that leads us to another point in respect to
the application.

In the District Court, when the case first

came up, we did not initially ask for abstention.

The

reason for that was that we took the position that State law
was clear, and that our responsibility under State lav; was
clear, that there v/as no question of State law, as far as the
federal district was concerned, the question was the State of
Missouri speaking through its State Board of Education
ruled that this was not permissible.
Then the Court, on its own, raised this, and we
then replied that if this Court deems that this is relevant,
then it should abstain, and we so argued that it abstain,
until a State Court decision could be reached, but the Court
of Appeals said that State lav; is irrelevant.
QUESTION:

Well, may I ask a question?

MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Surely.

The District Court, I gather, refused to

abstain, did it?
MR. PFEFFER:

The District Court initially abstained.

66

QUESTION;

I know.

MR. PFEFFER:

Abstained.

Then the Court of Appeals

reversed and said that State law is irrelevant.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. PFEFFER:

Because it’s a federal law, and

therefore —
QUESTION: That is in this opinion, is it?
MR. PFEFFER:

No, that's in the first — that's

referred to, that's the initial one.

Then we — they sent it

back and we had a trial.
QUESTION:

May I ask, would it be your view, Mr.

Pfeffer, that it's open to us still tc direct abstention if
we thought that was the appropriate thing to do here?
MR. PFEFFER:

No, Mr. Justice Brennan, it is our

view, initially, that State law is irrelevant in a sense.
QUESTION:

I know, but suppose we were to disagree

with you and we thought that there ought to be «—
MR. PFEFFER:

State law — then the only thing

could be done would be — and I think there's a procedure where
you, where the State law question could be satisfied to the
Supreme Court of Missouri.
QUESTION:

Assuming that, that that is —

No, ray question is whether it would be

appropriate for us to vacate and send this back and direct
abstention.

In your view, we could do that?

MR. PFEFFER:

You could do that, Mr. Justice Brennan,

67

although that ■— you could do that, but our contention, of
course, our second contention is that even if State

is

not violated, that this does violate the Establishment Clause.
QUESTION:

Yes, I know.

MR. PFEPFERs So that neither —
QUESTION:

But I gather, any State under this

program, its Legislature coiild adopt a law forbidding any
school district of the State from applying to participate in
this program?
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

I assume so.

Yes.

Well now, if the Missouri

Constitution is to be read as in effect prohibiting any State,
any school district from applying, then we'd never have to
reach the Establishment Clause question in this case, would
we?
MR. PFEFFER:

I would assume so.

I think that would be correct,
QUESTION:

The

I think —

But we would --- we would

Well, then that, if that were so, I

think you'd agree, Mr, Pfeffer, then at least there's an issue
here that might be avoided by directing abstention.
MR, PFEFFER:

The only thing on that, Mr. Justice

Brennan, is that that's what we originally argued, but we
couldn't convince the Court of Appeals.
QUESTION: Well, maybe you've convinced us.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pfeffer, do you agree with the Court

68

of Appeals, that under the Wheeler case in the Missouri
courts, that dual enrollment is not consistent with the State
statute?
MR. PFEFFER:

I could only say — I’m not —

you're asking my opinion or the opinion of the State Board
of Education?
QUESTION:

Well, I'm asking yours —

MR. PFEFFER: The State Board of Education —
QUESTION:

*— I'm asking you what's your position

here in this Court as to what State lav/ is on dual enrollment.
MR. PFEFFER:

Our position on State law is that

dual enrollment and sending teachers into the —
QUESTION: That isn't what I asked you.

I'm talking

about dual enrollment.
MR. PFEFFER:

Both.

Yes,

Both equally forbidden

by the State Constitution.of Missouri.
QUESTION:

No.

That isn't

Mr. Pfeffer, I asked

you whether you agreed that, under the Wheeler case, dual
enrollment had been outlawed under State statute.
MR. PFEFFER:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's true.

But —

So it is contrary to State lav/ whether

it's contrary to the State Constitution or not?
MR. PFEFFER:
whether it's ~ yes.
QUESTION:

Yes, it's contrary to State law,
Yes.

I think —

And your position is that under the State

69

Constitution, both for:?® are forbidden?
MR. PFEFFER;
QUESTION;

Exactly.
And which does bring in, into the spot­

light, Mr. Justice Brennan's question, I must say.
MR. PFEFFERs

Yes.

My only position is that as we interpret the statute,
the federal statute, the federal statute requires accommoda­
tion to State law, constitutional, statutory, and decisions.
QUESTION;

I understand.

MR. PFEFFER;

Therefore, that it’s the whole

conglomeration, not merely one aspect of it.
QUESTION:

Well, unless you were going to abstain,

then, I would suppose that under this — and if you agree that
State statute bars dual enrollment, then you really are up
against a federal constitutional question in the —• which is
what you say is your position, that you are up against it?
MR. PFEFFER:

Yes.

In a sense, yes.

The only

thing I can also answer is that, as I interpret it, I would —
as I interpret the statute, and I mentioned earlier, those
aren't the only two alternatives permitted.
QUESTION s

Yes.

MR. PFEFFER:

Dual enrollment and sending in.

But these are possible, there are a variety of alternatives.
We have been foreclosed by the decision of the District Court
on remand, to use one option — and the option which we want,

70

which we believe is the best option, we've been foreclosed,
we've been foreclosed, we believe it's violative of our State
law, our State Constitution, to send public school teachers
in.
We've been told to forget that.
as a criteria.

We were enjoined from it.

You cannot use that
If we use it, we're

under contempt.
This is tiie issue before the Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:22 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.}
