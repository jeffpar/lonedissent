MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear argument

next, in No. 73-781, Scherk against Alberto-Calver.
Mr. Hanley, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT F. HANLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HANLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I represent the petitioner, Fritz Scherk, and this
case involves the acquisition of petitioner's three related
European cosmetic businesses by respondent, Alberto-Culver,
an American corporation.
The issue that's presented is the enforcibility of
arbitration clauses entered into as part of international
agreements in the face of charges of violations of the
Se curites Exchange Act, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.
The facts as reflected in the complaint and in the
uncontradicted portions of the affidavits which were filed
in the trial court, in the District Court, are as follows:
Alberto-Culver became interested in petitioner’s
businesses back in June or July of 1967, and apparently it
became interested because they ware having some problems
getting their products, their hair products and so forth,
into the German market, accepted on the German market.

And

Scherk, apparently, had a good name, an established name in

4
that, in that market.
So, in June or July, steps were taken, contacts were
made in Berlin, in West Berlin, by Alfoerto~Culver.
Your Honors, there is some disagreement between the
parties as to whether a meeting, which was held in Melrose
Park, Illinois, in May of 1968, or a meeting in West Berlin
in March of 1968 was the most significant, with respect to
putting this transaction together.
But there is no contradiction about the fact that
these negotiations commenced in Europe. They were then
negotiated and conducted in both Europe and the United States
for a period of two years, and were ~ finally came to
conclusion at a closing in Geneva, Switzerland, in June of
1969.
Now, a battery of attorneys took months to put
together these acquisition agreements, which are spread over
some hundred, hundred and twenty-five pages, and they contained
clear clauses by which the parties agreed to negotiate to
arbitrate all future disputes before the International Chamber
of Commerce in Paris, France»
The parties used both American and German attorneys
in investigating and in negotiating and putting together
this sale of these three foreign businesses.
They also used trademark experts, business consultants,
and Alfoerto-Culver used its

outside auditors, Peat, Marwick &

5

Mitch e11 comp any.
Part of the purchase price for the companies was
paid in the form of promissor}7, four promissory notes, which
were delivered to the petitioner, Mr. Scherk, at the time of
the closing in Geneva.
Now, in 1970, Alberto-Culver concluded that
petitioner, Mr. Scherk, had breached trademark warranties,
having to do with trademarks that had been owned by the
Scherk enterprises.

And he charged

they charged violation

they brought suit, notwithstanding the arbitration clause,
brought suit in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, charging, in June of 1971,
charging violations of Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, charged
common”law deceit, fraud, and charged breach of warranty,
breach of trademark warranty.
Mr. Scherk had taken steps to arbitrate.; the
controversy in Paris back in January of 1971, but he had not
filed the necessary papers, taken the formal steps. Those
steps were not taken until after the suit in this case was
filed.

Those steps were taken, arbitration was commenced

officially, formally, in November of 1971.
We filed motions to dismiss the complaint based
upon contentions that the court was without jurisdiction over
the person of the petitioner; the court was without jurisdic­
tion of the subject matter; and on the basis of forum non

6

conveniens.
In the alternative, we also applied for a stay,
pending arbitration, a stay of the proceedings in the District
Court.

Our motions were all denied.
And the District Court granted an injunction

enjoining the petitioner, Mr. Scherk, from proceeding with
arbitration in Paris.
The Seventh Circuit affirmed, analyzing and applying
the Court’s 1953 decision in Wilko vs. Swan as invalidating
arbitration clauses and, of course, in Wilko v. Swan, the
invalidation was with respect to charges —- was in the face
of charges under the Securities Act of 1933? here we’re talking
about the

and here the Seventh Circuit applied Wilko vs.

Swan in tile face of charges of violations of the Exchange
Act and 10b-5.
Our position —QUESTION:
MR. HANLEY:
QUESTION:

Mr. Hanley, —
Yes, Your Honor.
~~ to what extent are you pursuing the

suggestion that the federal District Court in Illinois did
not have jurisdiction of this?
MR. HANLEY:

Your Honor, we believe that the federal

District Court has now ruled, and in the face of our motion
to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds, we believe - and the
Court of Appeals has — if you're asking me as far as the

7
preliminary injunction is concerned,, the Court of Appeals
has ruled that it had jurisdiction under 1232(a)(1)»
certainly agree with that contention.

This was the granting

of an injunction, preliminary injunction.
as what we

We

We have — as far

our motion to dismiss was not certified here,

and that issue, I believe, is just not the — the issue of
whether or not this is a security or whether or not Mr.
Scherk v/as properly before the court, I don’t think is any
longer subject to debate in these proceedings.
We have proceeded on the assumption that there -that the court has jurisdiction over the parties, over the
subject matter, and that this appeal is properly before this
Court as a preliminary injunction under 1292.
Our position here is that, this Court, upon a reana lysis of Wilko vs

_Swan, in the light of the international

context here, and the strong federal policy favoring
arbitration, need not and should not apply Wilko vs. Swan
mechanically, mechanistically, and invalidate arbitration
agreements where securities violations are led in this
international context.
There is no compelling reason to extend Wilko vs.
Swan, and some very, very good reasons, we assert, why WiIko
should not be applied in this circumstance.
As Circuit Judge Stevens said in his dissenting
opinion below, the enforcement of these arbitration agreements

8

in this case would not frustrate the policies of the Exchange
Act, whereas refusal to enforce them would certainly
frustrate important policies which this Court has articulated
as recently as 1972, in the Zapata case.
It’s clear, I believe it's absolutely clear that
without Wilko ys, Swan, the arbitration provisions in these,
in this acquisition ~~ in these acquisition agreements would
be enforced.

They would be enforced under either Chapter 1

or Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act.

And we look

in vain, and have read the briefs in vain, for any reason
to support the mechanical application of Wilko vs. Swan to
the situation here.
The respondent is not going to lose his right to
be heard on these trademark

these breaches of trademark.

The arbitration, the arbitral courts have and can arbitrate
matters going to allegations of fraud, and breaches of
warranty.
The respondent says in effect, I agree to arbitrate
now I don't want to arbitrate any more and I look around and
I found this Supreme Court case, this 1953 case that says I
don't have to.

And it gives me an excuse, and so I'm not

going to live up to my bargain,
The respondent points to the lanugage of Section 27
of the Exchange Act, which says that district courts shall
have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of the title or

9

the rules and regulations thereunder, and that all suits in
equity and actions at law to enforce any liability or duty
created under the title, and so forth, will be in the
district court.
How, he points to that —~ respondent points to that
language and says that, as I understand his argument, that
all securities disputes must be resolved in the United States
District Courts.

That just isn't — that doesn't comport with

the reality.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is resolving
securities disputes every day in arbitration proceedings?
where the matters involve existing disputes, are being
arbitrated every day? we’re having resolution of securities
problems in arbitration proceedings between members of
exchanges, where they have rules requiring arbitration?
we're having arbitration in securities matters and proceedings
between

non-members and members of exchanges; and we’re having

arbitration proceedings where the broker opposes arbitration
and the customer seeks it.
And it just doesn't follow.
QUESTION;

It's your -- that's your submission, I

guess, that that language means that if an action under the
Exchange Act of '34 comes to a court, it's the federal district
courts that have exclusive jurisdiction, exclusive of the
State courts.

10

MR, HANLEYs

That's correct.

QUESTION s • Is that the point?
MR. HANLEYs

That's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTIONS

That language is not in the '33 Act,

MR. HANLEY:

No, Your Honor,

is it?

QUESTION; And it was the *33 Act —
MR. HANLEY:
QUESTION:
MR, HANLEY:

Wilke.
— which is Wilko v. Swan.
That's correct.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Mr. Hanley, —

MR. HANLEY:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
— before you proceed, let me come back

to something you said a little earlier.
Do you concede that this transaction is within the
scope of the Securities Acts, and, if so, why?
MR. HANLEY;

Technically, Your Honor, I believe

we would have to concede, under the cases that, for the
purpose at least of this argument, we concede that there are
promissory notes involved,
QUESTION: This was a purchase of assets and nothing
more, wasn't it?
MR. HANLEY:

In substance.

In substance.

There was a purchase of assets, there was a purchase of a going

11
business concern.
QUESTION5 Right. And your — and the purchase
embraced 100 percent of the ownership of the — of your client.
MR» HANLEY:

There were some —- Your Honor, that's

90 percent accurate. There were some trademark rights and
some rights in Israel and in other parts of the world that
were reserved by Mr. Scherk

,

but basically they acquired,the

respondent acquired his business enterprise.
QUESTION:

The purchaser acquired stock in the

German company that was organized as a part of the transaction,
as I understood it.
MR. HANLEY:

He acquired stock in a company or a

business
QUESTION:
MR. KANLEY:

In Liechtenstein.
It

was a Liechtenstein "Ansta.lt",

Your Honor, and at the time of the transaction, at the time
that they were entering into it, it was not a stock company,
it was specifically not a stock company, and was converted
as part of the transaction.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. HANLEY:

And stock was issued and was delivered

at the time of the closing, it was held in escrow. •
I think the point on tills is that if we permit
these four promissory notes and this transformed German -Liechtenstein "Anstalt” to establish the rule for the Court,

12

and automatically — the Court would automatically apply
Wilko vs. Swan in that situation with those connecting
factors, it's our position that you're certainly permitting
form to rule substance, and that there is no reason, there
is no counterveiling

in this circumstance there is no

counterveiling policy with respect to the enforcement of
the Securities laws in this situation that would justify,
that would justify that,
QUESTION;

Well, neither the Act of '33 nor '34

was addressed to negotiated mergers and acquisitions of
.

assets.

'

*

*

Mow, I don't understand why'you give up that point.

We haven't said so up here, have we?
MR. HANLEY; Well, Your Honor, I have read the
cases, and have seen the extension of this definition of
securities to include — and I don't like to stand here and
argue against myself, but I —
QUESTION;

If we said so, perhaps I missed it?

but have we said so?
MR. HANLEY;

No, Your Honor.

Not to my satisfaction.

But, nevertheless, I think that the

our point

here is that it really is not necessary for us to fight any
longer on that point, because there is just really no
requirement here to apply Wilko vs. Swan if we, arguendo, if
we are within the Securities Exchange ambit in this case.
And we argued that and we lost that in the District Court, and

13

we have conceded it for the sake of this argument.
QUESTION;

You didn't lose it entirely with Judge

Stevens, as I read his opinion.
MR. HANLEY;
QUESTION;

Well, -Go ahead.

I won’t interrupt you on this

point any further? but I wouldn't have given up an arguable
point, based on what I understand of this case.
MR. HANLEY;
QUESTION:

All right, Your Honor.
Mr. Hanley, if I correctly understand,

the main thrust of your argument is that given the long­
standing judicial and legislative policy to encourage arbitra­
tion, that that should be followed absent compelling reasons
of public policy not to do so, and that there are no
compelling reasons of public policy presented here, —
MR. HANLEY;
QUESTION;

That's right.
— as there were in Wilko.

MR. HANLEY;

That's right.

We say, Mr. Chief

Justice, we say that Wilko just doesn't fit here.

It was a

garden variety, domestic case, involving a customer of a
brokerage house who signed a 17-page form agreement provided
by the brokerage house, contained an arbitration clause along
with other provisions which waive the protection of the
federal securities law.

There was a great disparity in

bargaining positions, great disparity in the relative degrees
of sophistication, a clear — just a very clear disparity in

14
bargaining power.
There was no compelling reason not to relieve the
customer of his agreement to arbitrate under the circumstances,
and some fairly compelling reasons to show that it would
have been unfair to require him to arbitrate under the circum­
stances .
Our situation is entirely different.
Culver went to Europe.
businesses.

Alberto-

They purchased these Scherk

They used an array of European and American

lawyers, trademark experts, business consultants.

The

sophisticated businessmen here agreed to arbitrate their
disputes after a two-year arm's-length transaction. There
was no over-weaning bargaining power on the part of the
petitioner.
It's clear also that Alberto-Culver considered the
possibility that they were going to have trademark problems,
Mr. Silver, their general counsel's affidavit here shows —
evidences great concern about trademarks, as shown also
by the fact that the trademark warranties took up some 25
pages in the acquisition agreement.
They clearly anticipated trademark as an area of
possible future dispute.

And to permit the respondent to

refuse to honor its promise to arbitrate, in an agreed
form, where the agreement was reached in good faith, after
..free and fair bargaining between the parties, with, equal

15
bargaining power, just plain isn't fair.
Wilke? should not be extended to permit an American
businessman to dishonor his agreement with the foreigner*
And certainly the foreign aspects are compelling enough, the
international aspects of this case are compelling enough
not to extend the Wilko rule in this case.

We know that

uncertainty —
QUESTION:
MR. HANLEY;
QUESTION:

Mr. Hanley.
Yes, Your Honor.
Let me see if I follow you on this.

I take it it’s your position of course that the parties
should go to arbitration.

Do you concede that once the

arbitral award is arrived at that, nevertheless, the federal
District Court may then pass upon the issue of whether our
public policy prevents its enforcement?
MR. HANLEY;

We believe, Your Honor, that the

arbitral court should resolve all of the questions, all of
the factual questions here? yes, we do.
We don't think we’re in a situation vrhere it's
necessary to remand the case here to make a determination
v/hether there are these policy matters present in this case.
It’s very clear here that there is no —* at least it’s clear
to me -•** that there is no counterveiling policy present.
There is no shown

and the matter has been argued, there is

no showing here that under the facts in this case, with

16
arbitration, that there would be a concomitant detriment to
security law enforcement.
So I would say that this matter should be resolved
by the court, by the arbitral court in Paris in accordance
with the solemn agreement of the parties.
QUESTION;

You have a federal statute, and it would

be amazing, I think, to anybody who has worked in the field,
to assume that if I bought out a company, lock, stock and
barrel, with the stock and debentures and everything else,
that wasn't a security.
MR. HANLEY;

Your Honor, I can see areas --

QUESTION; Read the definition in Section 3(a)(10)
of the Exchange Act of '34.

It would be driving a hole in

the Act big enough to send a caravan through.
MR. HANLEY;

Your Honor, we can certainly —- we

can certainly hypothecate factual situations in which it
would be unreasonable to — not to apply Wilko vs„ Swan in
this particular case.
Assume a British company coming over and making a
tender offer on a widely held corporation.

In that kind of

situation
QUESTION:

But, you see, those old — in this field

you don’t talk about equities, you talk about the law? whether
or not you have a security or you don't have a security.
MR. HANLEY: Well, what we’ve tried to show, Your Honor,

17
is that the court ~~ that under Section 27, the courts have
not been requiring that all securities disputes be resolved
in the District Courts —■
QUESTION:

Well, you haven't cited anything in

your brief that is contrary to what the Court of Appeals said
here.
MR. HANLEY: Well, we hope we've shown, Your Honor,
that it would be — that because of the policies that were
established by this Court or articulated in this Court in
Zapata, that it would be unfair and it would be unnecessary
to extend Zapata into this international situation.
I'm sorry, I mean Wilko vs. Swan.
QUESTION:

Zapata was a common law case, was it not?

An admiralty claim.
MR. HANLEY:

And we believe that, as in Zapata,

Your Honor, that the issues in this case are right for
determination by the arbitral court.
The thing we didn't

I didn't have a chance to

really have it mentioned, was the uncertainty in these
international transactions, which are the real bugaboo of
these international transactions, and it's essential for the
foreign, businessmen to know in advance where and how they’re
going to resolve their conflicts.

The parties bring to the

bargaining tables different legal theories, and they pay for,
they arbitrate and they negotiate and they pay for these

18

arbitration clauses.

In fact, they may be the sine qua non

of an international transaction.
In the Wilko garden variety securities matter,
where you’re buying securities from a broker, there's no
compelling reason that the parties have such certainty.
But they certainly need that certainty in international
transactions, and how we •— one of the things that's
happened, of course, since Wilko is that we have articulated
a strong national policy in favor of arbitration of inter­
national transactions, both in Chapter 2 of the Federal
Arbitration Act and also in the accesstion to the United
Nations Treaty for the enforcement of arbitral awards.
And we think —
QUESTION: But that Convention preserves consistently
the issue of whether the arbitration award is against public
policy in this country, or any country; does it not?
MR. HANLEY:

Yes.

QUESTION: So I get back to my question:

Do you,

*— of whether, if you. prevail on the primary availability of
arbitration here under the agreement, you still aren't
subject, possibly, to an American court’s passing on idle
public policy issue.
MR. HANLEY:

If there are facts, I xvould certainly

agree, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I would certainly agree if there
are facts to be resolved, that they may have to be resolved

19
as the Court indicated in Zapata.
I don't see them — frankly, I don't see any facts
for resolution with respect to public policy in the case
that's before Your Honors.
QUESTION: That may well be, but certainly the
arbitrator is not the one to pass on that.
MR. HANLEY;

I would concede ~

QUESTION:

I just — that's what I’m asking.

All right.
QUESTION;

But your problem is -that Wilko was arm's-

length bargaining, wasn't it?

There's no overreaching there.

That also was a situation of an arbitration clause arrived
at by arm's-length bargaining, that's *—
QUESTION:
MR. HANLEY:

No.
I think not.

It was a garden variety,

customer of a brokerage house. Haydenstone, Haydenstone sends
them a 17-page form contract, signs an arbitration clause,
tremendous disparity in bargaining power, tremendous disparity
in relative bargaining strengths, business acumen,
sophistication; it's just exactly the antithesis of our
situation, with their battery of lawyers and experts who
looked at this, as sophisticated businessmen, and got
together after two years and agreed that we're going to
arbitrate the very kinds of disputes that have arisen here
in Paris, and what a shock and surprise it must be to wake up

20

and find that you're going to be required to resolve your
conflicts in the United States District Court.
QUESTIONS

But, you see, the definition of

security doesn’t —» in the ’34 Act — doesn't turn upon how
strong one party is and how weak the other party is.
This is a generalized, wide category.
MR. HANLEYs
QUESTIONS

Well, I understand —
It would be a very unusual situation to

acquire the company, lock, stock and barrel, its securities
and whatnot, and to march off saying that's not a security.
That is more than a person who has worked in the field can
swallow, at least quickly.
HR. HANLEY:

Well, it may be a security, Your

Honor, and in this particular situation, assuming it's a
security, we’re saying that it’s not necessary for this
Court to effectuate the rule, to apply the rule, to extend
the rule in Wilko vs. Swan,

And to prevent arbitration here.

The amicus now has five minutes.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Hr. Aksen.

Very well, Mr. Hanley.

22

provision of the enforcement of arbitration agreements.
The Convention also states the specific grounds upon
which a court may refuse to honor that agreement.
I would call to your attention that public policy
is not one of those listed grounds.
I think it very important to note that four major
developments have occurred in this country within the past
few years, dealing with this Convention.
The first is the fact that Congress amended Chapter
2 of the Federal ARbitration Act.

This Court was only ruling

upon Chapter 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act in 1953 in the
Wilko case.
Congress not only added a new chapter to that Act,
but the Senate advised and consented on this International
Treaty.
Only two years ago, the government of the United
States, in. a series of joint agreements with the Russians,
the Polish, and more agreements are forthcoming, have
provided for this mechanism, the use of voluntary arbitration
in a neutral country, to resolve all commercial business
disputes.
Finally, only this year, the American Bar Association, at its House of Delegates, wrote a letter to all of the
other countries of the world, through their bar associations,
advising and recommending that they pass this Convention,

2 J0

which has now been passed in 42 countries of the world»
"Utere is no other practical way to settle inter­
national business disputes than through the arbitration
mechanism.
QUESTION:

Mr. Aksen, let me get this straight.

Did you say public policy was not a factor in the U.N.
Convention?
MR. AKSEN:

The U.N. Convention, Your Honor, provides,

in the section on enforcement of awards, that the host country
may of course refuse to honor the arbitration award, if it
would offend its public policy.
It does not so provide on. the section dealing with
enforcement of arbitration agreements, which is Article II
of the Convention.
We feel that —
QUESTION: Well, that doesn’t invalidate the
validity of my inquiry to Mr» Hanley.
MR. AKSEN;

No, Your Honor, it does not.

It does

not. And, in fact, amicus does not argue that this Court
should make a distinction between agreements and an award,
because I don't think it would be appropriate to have two
separate forums trying the same thing over again.
QUESTION:

Well, is that presented in this case,

at this stage?
MR. AKSEN:

Amicus has not so argued in this case.

24

I was just pointing out the exact language of the Convention,
should the Court wish to narrow its issue to the scope of
the aribtration agreement itself.
QUESTION: The jurisdiction of a United States court
to deal with what Mr. Justice Blackmun has raised to you,
that is, the award when, as and if one is made, is a
question not now before the Court.
MR. AKSEN:

That is correct, Your Honor; it is not

now before the Court.
QUESTION;

Mr. Aksen, is there some workable

line to be drawn, assuming that the Court wished to follow
your suggestion, between the Wilkovs. Swan type of case
and this type of case?

It seems to be it’s not entirely

satisfactory to say this was a wealthy man, he had three
lawyers, and the guy in Wilko y. Swan didn't have

Swan

didn’t have any lawyers.
MR, AKSEN: The only workable line to accommodate
the Federal Arbitration Act and the old Wilko v„ Swan arguraent is to take a very hard look at recent times.
Novi, all of the developments that we have listed
for you in the brief have occurred since 1953.

Two

Administrations, Democratic and Republican, in this country
have recognised the need for this mechanism to resolve
disputes.
If you find that with the wording of this Convention

25
you can let. one party, an American party, refuse to honor
this arbitration agreement and, in the words of Mr. Justice
Douglas, you will drive a caravan through this Convention.
This Convention was passed in this country at the —
QUESTION:

Well, there are lots of financial

refugees around the world who do not dare return to their
own country.

They would welcome arbitration of their

disputes in Paris.
MRa AKSEN;

I think, Mr. Justice Douglas, that all

of the businessmen in the world would welcome the free use of
arbitration.
QUESTION;

I'm talking about the refugees.

MR. AKSEN; Well, if they're businessmen, Your Honor,
I think they would welcome arbitration,
QUESTION:

I'm sure they would.

To avoid the

rigors of their own regime at home.
MR, AKSEN:

I'm perhaps missing something, but I'm

sure if a political type problem would —*
QUESTION:

This is not political, what I'm talking

MR, AKSEN:

— problem with refugees is relevant to

about —

the definition of commerce, as defined by the Convention.
QUESTION;

I'm thinking in terms of the problems of

securities, regulation of securities, in Switzerland, here,
England, and elsewhere

26

MR- AKSENs

Well, I think it's clear if this

Court finds that the securities matters in this case, which
we consider peripheral, but if the Court finds that these
securities matters are controlling, then it has a very
difficult time accommodating these two statutes.
But in this case we do have a statutory problem,
and the most recent statute is one of both the Convention
and an enactment, a reenactment adding a full chapter fco the
Federal Arbitration Act.

And with language, may I point out,

that was not required.
The Convention does not require any court of any
country to force a native to go abroad to arbitrate.
QUESTION s What do you think the result would be
under the amendments to the Act and under the Convention if
the Securities Act said, itself, expressly that arbitx'afcion
clauses will not be permitted?
MR. AKSENs

Then there would be no doubt in my

mind, and the WiIko attitude shou3.d prevail-

But this is —

QUESTION? And that the Convention would concededly
accept that sort of a provision.

Now, isn’t that what

Wilko really said?
MR. AKSEN:

We think not.

QUESTION;

It's just as though that kind of a

provision was written into the Act?
MR. AKSEN;

No, because I think when you talk of

27
public policy# Wilko would have had to have said that you
cannot not only not agree to arbitrate future disputes, but
you could not agree to arbitrate an existing dispute.
Wilko did not say that.

The dissent clearly pointed out

that they were not deciding whether or not two American
parties could agree to arbitrate an existing securities
question.
QUESTION;

Well, what of Mr. Justice Jackson's

concurring language, simple sentence:

I agree with the

Court's opinion in so far as it construes the Securities
Act to prohibit waiver of a judicial remedy in favor of
arbitration by agreement made before any controversy
arose?
MR, AKSEN:

That is correct, but I don't thinly that

is sufficient public policy of the kind required —
QUESTION;

No, but that was ~™ at least Mr. Justice

Jackson read Mr. Justice Reed's opinion as a construction of
the Securities Act to prohibit, as Mr. Justice White
suggested, —
MR, AKSEN:

It could and did, Your Honor, in a

domestic transaction between two Americans who were fully
aware of their local statutory provisions.
QUESTION;

Yes.

QUESTION: Did we not have something to say in the
Zapata case of the impact on international trade and commerce

28
if arm"s-length transactions by American companies and
foreign companies could not freely commit themselves to
arbitration?

Wasn't there some discussion of that?

MR. AKSEN:

You certainly did, Mr. Justice Burger,

and we heartily endorse the language from the Zapata opinion
if you would have insert "arbitration” rather than that
"choice of forum".
We think that all you're doing is moving very
slightly from fcha Zapata case to this one, that we're not
really asking the Court here for a very drastic change in
American law.
In fact, in domestic law this Court has already
ruled that if you have a problem of fraud in the inducement
or misrepresentation in Prims. Paint, then that is a matter
for the arbitrator, between Prima Paint and Zapata, in moving
very slightly to another ruling in this case, which would
encourage the use of international commercial arbitration.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr., Higgins.

Thank you, Mr. Aksen.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS J. HIGGINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it

MR. HIGGINS:
please the Court:

Before turning to what I consider to be some
inaccuracies in the statement of facts made by my brethren,
I would like to make this observation, after having heard
the argument.
The two concessions which have been made here by
counsel, which I thought were impliedly conceded in the brief
as well, namely, that (1)'personal jurisdiction exists and
(2) subject matter jurisdiction exists; that is, the coverage
of the Act leads the petitioner in logic to ask this Court
to overrule. Wilke vs. Swan.
That, I think, is the necessary impact of their
position.
Now, why were these concessions made?
Two reasons:

one factual; the other legal.

First of all, the petitioner has consistently over­
looked the fact that securities fraud was committed in this
country within the territorial boundaries of the United
States, to the injury

of an American citizen.

Recent decisions, including the Leasco case in the
Second Circuit, and the Travis case in the Eighth Circuit,
have applied the Act to this type of situation, whether

30
negotiated or not.
So if the Act applies, Section 29(a) must apply as
well.
Now, the suggestion has been made that 29(a) should
not be the same as 14.

Since the language of the two

statutes is the same, we fail to see how that can occur.
QUESTION:
MR. HIGGINS:

29(a) of the '34 —
Of the ’34 Act is identical to 14

of the !33 Act.
Now, what is the ultimate logic of the petitioner’s
position hers?
It is that my client, an American company, is not
a person within the meaning of 29(a), which bars any
stipulation by any person to waive compliance with the Act.
That, we submit, is a matter of statutory logic, construction
and policy should not. be followed by this Court.
The Convention makes no change in this law.

In

fact, it expressly accommodates Wilko and 29(a) in international
transactions.
Consider the effect, if the Court will, if you were
to recognise an exception to this Act, wherever the defendant
is a foreigner.

Even though he has come into this country,

defrauded an American citisen, he is concededly subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts, he can escape it because he's a
foreigner.

31

QUESTIONi

Well, not just because he’s a foreigner,

but because he made an agreement and is also a foreigner?
isn’t, that it?
MR. HIGGINS;

He made an agreement, but the plaintiff

in the case is a person, the agreement is a stipulation,
Chief Justice Burger, and section 21 of the Act creating
exclusive jurisdiction is a provision.
Now, if you concede, as the petitioner has done
here, that the Act applies, it must necessarily follow, we
submit, that section 29(a) applies? and section 27 also
applies.
QUESTION;

Well, I could understand and follow

that much more readily if you had a Swiss or a German or a
French corporation coming into this country, selling
securities in the traditional way, issuing them here.
MR. HIGGINS;

I would like to address myself to

that, because I think this is the heart of Chief Judge .
Friendly’s position in Leasco.

There you have securities

which were totally foreign, you had a negotiated transaction,
you had foreign defendants, and, nevertheless, the court
there held, on traditional principles of international law,
foreign relations law of the United States, that what was
key was not whether the securities were those of a foreign
corporation, but whether or not that company, through its
representatives, in the concededly negotiated transaction,

32
carae to this country and, here on our soil, defrauded an
American citisen*
QUESTIONs

Yes, but that case didn't involve this

question of arbitration.
MR. HIGGINS:

No.

QUESTION: And that's the only question here.

If

you look at the petition for certiorari, it's conceded,
rightly or wrongly, that at least, arguendo, this is a
security and that there has been an alleged violation of the
Securities and Exchange Act of '34.

There's only one

question presented in the petition for certiorari,
Leasco didn't involve arbitration.

It simply

involved the applicability of the '34 Act.
MR. HIGGINS;

Correct.

And that brings us, I

suppose, to an analysis, a proper analysis of both 29(a)
arid Wilko.

Because we concededly have power over this man,

albeit he's a foreigner, our courts have jurisdiction over
him.

Just as they had jurisdiction over the defendant in

W1Iko.
Now, we submit that the petitioner here has mis»
characterised this Court's holding in Wilko, or misunderstood
it.

It is true that that case involved a suit by a

customer against a brokerage house.

But what the Court had

before it, Section 14 of the '33 Act, was again, like 29(a)
of the *34 Act, a statute of general applicability.

It

33
purported to benefit or protect any person signing any
stipulation agreement or provision, waiving compliance with
any portion of the Act*
The majority opinion stated, on its face, the
opinion of Justice Reed, that we recognise that under certain
circumstances buyers and sellers of securities may bargain at
arm’s length.

But we nevertheless hold that the intention of

Congress is better carried out by finding void any agreement
to arbitrate a future dispute.
It was a statement of general applicability.
In his dissenting opinion, Justice Frankfurter
recogniaed this.

He said: We do not hax^e before us here a

case of overreaching, a case of coercion; and he nevertheless
concluded in the last sentence:

I read the majority's

opinion to be a general limitation, a general limitation on
the Federal Arbitration Act.
Now, that was the law, as it stood in 1970,
Petitioner would have the Court believe that it's we who are
trying to expand the law.

Nothing could be further from the

truth.
The question is whether the Convention repealed
section 29(a) and section 14.

And, for the reasons which have

been outlined already here in argument, we feel that an
argument of repealer here is totally without merit.
The State Department, when it prepared a memorandum

34

for the President., pointed out. that these provisions, public
policy, incapable of being enforced, are intended to take
account of laws which prohibit the submission of certain
questions to arbitration*
Wilko is such a holding, section 14 is such a law,
section 29(a) is such a law*
Mow, the two exceptions —
QUESTION;

Mr. Higgins —

MR. HIGGINS;
QUESTION;

Yes, Mr. Justice

-- 'when your client engages in consider­

able negotiation over where this shall be arbitrated, that's
really a. throwaway from his point of view, I suppose, since
it can never be enforced, he can get some other concession
for that and still renege if it comes up.
MR. HIGGINS;

Well, I think when you talk about

renege, I don't think that parties when they are entering
into negotiations of this type assume, or necessarily foresee
that there is going to be securities fraud committee, Justice
Rehnquist.
him;

I think it's the argument that we should say to

Nov;, look, if you commit fraud, there is in our

country a case called Wilko, or a section 29(a) -- that's an
unreal bargaining process, as I understand it.
Also the concept of reneging, if we call this
reneging, it's no more reneging than what Mr. Wilko did, or
2

Mr. Boyd, or Mr. Arguilis, or Mr, Alexander.

35
QUESTION:

Except Wilko, I understand,, was kind of

contract of adhesion, where there wasn’t a very substantial
bargaining process.
MR. HIGGINS:

But I was attempting to point out,

Justice Rehnquist, that that's not what that case involved.
As that case emerged through the court system, and as it got
to the Supreme Court, there was no contention of any over­
reaching, coercion and, in fact, Justice Frankfurter mentioned
this, he said:

I don't see why we're deciding this case

this way, because there's no disparity of bargaining power
here.

No showing that this man had to sign this contract.
QUESTION:

Under your view of the law, would the

arbitration provision in the agreement that your client
signed be applicable to some disputes that arose under the
Act?
MR. HIGGINS:

I would assume that if there was a

straight non-securities violation or breach of contract, it
would be applicable, yes.
But what makes -this unique and different is the
applicability of what Mr. Justice Douglas accurately referred
to as the clear provisions of the Exchange Act.
There is no question here we have stock, we purchased
stock, within the meaning of

3a-10; no question but what

the long-term promissory notes which were issued for
securities.

Hence, we have a situation here which is similar

36

to a. number of domestic cases, which are known to the parties
here, where the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange
Act have been applied to the acquisition of all the stock of a
business.
They’ve been applied to acquisitions of interest
in close corporations, and in fact this Court expressly said.,
in the Bankers Life case, that the construction of this
Act is to be liberal and that it protects corporations —
protects corporations as well as individuals.
QUESTIONS Would your position preclude agreements
of the parties with respect to the applicable law, as to
how the contract is to be interpreted and enforced?
MR. HIGGINSs

No, I don’t believe it would,

Justice White.
QUESTION:

Because the parties here would have

stipulate that the law of West Germany or the French law
or something would have
MR. HIGGINS:

In fact they did stipulate on Illinois

lav;.
QUESTION:

Yes, yes, indeed.

MR. HIGGINS:

QUESTION:

I wondered if you would —

MR. HIGGINS:
QUESTION:

And this is another factor here, which

Yes.

Yes.

— if that isn't a factor in your

37

argument,
MR. HIGGINS;

It hasn't been so far, but I --

QUESTION; But you would suppose businessmen, then,
and their lawyers could, if Wilko is followed in this case,
nevertheless structure their agreements to obtain the
benefits of arbitration.
MR. HIGGINS:

Yes.

No question.

To obtain the

benefits of arbitration outside the Exchange Act, and they
can also select their applicable law.
QUESTION: Well, they could stipulate to the
Exchange Act, but t<rould not the United States —■
MR. HIGGINS:
QUESTION:

No, no —

That's what I’m asking you.

MR. HIGGINS:

A stipulation in advance to weigh

tine provisions of the Exchange Act is void.
In advance.

At least in advance.

QUESTION; Well — so they can't stipulate, they
cannot stipulate out of the determination of fraud or not,
pursuant to the federal Act?,
MR. HIGGINS:
QUESTION:

Correct.

And as I read —-

So if that is stipulated, West German

law applies in this case, that would have been, you say it
would have been pro tanto void, with respect to securities
violations?
MR, HIGGINS:

That's cox*rect, Your Honor.

33
QUESTIONs As long as under sound principles of
international law, the Act would have been applicable at all?
ME. HIGGINSs

Yes. and the defendant is subject to

the jurisdiction of the court.
QUESTION?.

Yes „

MR. HIGGINS 5

We always have this limitation, that

he must have done something to bring him within our power to
begin with.
QUESTION s
MR. HIGGINS;

Yes.
And when he has done that something,

it ceases to be what’s called in the petitioner's brief,
quote, "a mere international commercial transaction".
The transaction indeed may be international, but that fraud
is domestic, and it is that fraud, the domestic fraud,
which confers both personal subject matter jurisdiction and
gives the plaintiff, the injured plaintiff, the right, to
access in the United States courts.
Under the '33 Act it would be either State or
federal, as he chose, and under the '34 Act it would be
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Courts.
But you asked about the Illinois lav; provision.
This is again a factor which is probably not necessary to
our position in this case; but certainly reinforces it.
As the amicus, the Triple-A points out in his
brief, when the parties selected Illinois law, they, ipso

39

factor, by operation of law selected federal law to the extent
that it’s applicable.
QUESTION; Well, except that it says the laws of the
State of Illinois,
MR. HIGGINS;

Right, Justice Stewart, but the

Triple-A in its amicus brief pointed out, accurately we
believe, that when parties select State law they also select
federal law to the extent that that is under the supremacy
clause part of the law of the State,
But this is simply another — quite aside from that
legal argument, this is simply another American mexus to
tliis transaction, that here's a party, Scherk, who contracted
with specific reference to the laws of this country.
QUESTION:

Mr. Higgins, before you go on, why did

your client insist that SEV foe converted into a Liechtenstein
stock corporation?
MR. HIGGINS;

The record indicates that there were

certain tax considerations, which Alfoerto-Culver wished to
serve.
QUESTION;
MR. HIGGINS:

For the benefit of your client?
Well, it was for the benefit of having

the deal made, it was our wish, Scherk agreed with it, and in
order to effectuate the transaction he converted his "Anstalt"
into a stock corporation.
the notes.

We purchased the stock and issued

40

QUESTION «;

That is a condition to the obligation

to purchase the business?
MR. HIGGINS;
QUESTION:
MR. HIGGINS:

Yes , sir.
Right.
Zapata has been mentioned.

indeed an impox"tant case.

Zapata is

But the Chief Justice's opinion

in Zapata clearly indicates room and in fact explicitly makes
room for this type of case.
The opinion states that:

choice of forum provisions

should be declared void, if it contravenes statutory or
judicially declared public policy.
And in support of that proposition, the Chief
Justice’s opinion cited Boyd vs„ Grand Trunk Western Railroad.
Boyd was the first of the string of cases which this Court
has decided.

There a railroad employee restricted his right

of venue under the statute.
In fact, it was after the dispute arose in Boyd.
Nevertheless, this Court held that that agreement was void
to the extent that it attempted to deprive this man of his
right to sue, wherever the statute provided the railroad could
be sued.
Boyd was relied on in Wilko.
Now, the Court said in Wilko:
•MuanuwMutMa

We noticed in Boyd

via’-oiciSKOMJi

that we declared void a post-dispute agreement. We don't have
to go that far today, and we're not doing so.

And it was that, I think, that led to Justice
Jackson's concurring opinion, leaving open this question of
a post-dispute agreement.,
We do not have that situation here.

If it copies

before the Court, an agreement entered into after the
dispute arises, different policy considerations are going
to be applicable.

You’11 have the question of whether or not

this is akin or analogous to a settlement agreement.
In any event, this Court has not faced or decided
that issue, and it is not involved in the case before the
Court today.
An argument could certainly be made as a matter of
statutory construction that such an agreement should be void,
just as this Court held the Boyd, agreement was void.
So, summing up, neither of the two exceptions
which have been urged here by the petitioner, namely, the
exception based upon some concept of disparity of bargaining
power or sophisticated people, or the fact that he is a
foreigner who chose to come to this country and subject
himself to the Act, can hold substance either under the
language of section 29(a) or under 14.
The suggestion has been made that there’s nothing
unusual about a 10b05 case, that this is something very simple
to understand.

But if this Court were to hold that an

arbitration agreement requires adjudication of this matter

42
before a foreign tribunal, where it's a virtual certainty
that tliere will be unfamiliarity with this Act, then, as
this Court noted in Barnhart, the remission of this case,
the change of this case from a court to arbitration, would
have very definite potential for affecting the underlying
substantive right to recovery„
Arbitration is not simply a formal matter, a
procedural matter*

This Court held in Barnhart, under an

eerie question, really, that arbitration versus the court
is a matter of substance and can affect and perhaps even
destroy the plaintiff’s right to recovery.
Under circumstance where the power of review, the
development, of the record, the lack of discovery, the lack
of development of a known body of doctrine for the guidance
of the public, and all the other infirmities of arbitration
mentioned in W.tIko, are equally applicable here.
So, under the circumstances, we ask this Court to
follow its holding in Wilko, not. to overrule that case,
because neither the statute nor the Convention nor any other
judicial authority requires or permits it, and to affirm the
judgments of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and of
the District Court.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 12s05 p.m., the case was submitted.]
