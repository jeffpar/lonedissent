MR* CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-1566, Granny Goose Foods against Brotherhood
of Teamsters, Alameda County.
Mr. Tichy, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. TICHY, II, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. TICHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case arises out of the U. S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit, and presents three major issues.
These are:

whether or not section 1450 of the Federal Removal

statute takes precedence over State law concerning the
effective period of a removed State court injunctive order?
secondly, whether section 1450 takes precedence over
conflicting provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure? and thirdly, whether or

not the denial of a

motion to dissolve a removed State court restraining order
is tantamount to the issuance of a preliminary injunction
for purposes of enforcement.
The facts in this case arise out of a contractual
dispute in a labor situation.

Teamsters Local 70 and the

companies involved here had for many years been parties to
the National Master Freight Agreement and the Local 70
Supplemental Agreement

4
Preparatory to 1970 negotiations, the National
Freight Industry Negotiating Committee of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters notified the companies that the union
committee desired to negotiate changes and revisions in the
existing agreements.
The critical provision here is that the notice did
not terminate the existing agreement, but they did continue
in effect.
The union, Teamsters Local 70, was most desirous
to break away from national negotiations and to impose a new
independent agreement on the companies involved.

The vehicle

which it used to enforce this approach was a work stoppage,
initially against Granny Goose Foods and Sunshine Biscuits
and ultimately against Standard Brands.
The companies believed that because there was
compulsory grievance procedures in the collective bargaining
agreement that the matter should be resolved in accordance
with the grievance procedures rather than through a work
s toppage«,
Consequently, when the strike continued to persist,
Granny Goose Foods and Sunshine Biscuits went into State
court to seek a restraining order against the illegal strike
activityo
In advance of the hearing, the attorney for Local 70
was notified, he in fact appeared before the judge, he

5
presented arguments to the court that he believed that the
contract had not been breached, that there was no basis for
a restraining order.

But, despite the existence of these

arguments, a restraining order was in fact issued»
Thereafter the picketing, the work stoppage, extended
to Standard Brands, where Standard Brands of course joined
as a party plaintiff in the litigation, went to court and
sought a modified temporary restraining order.

But, prior

to the application, again Local 70's attorney was advised.
He did not personally appear, but in Alameda County there is
a practice that no labor injunction will issue unless the
labor union's attorney has a chance to make the position of
the union known.
The court thereupon insisted that the counsel for
the union be called.

He was reached in his office. The

judge talked with him over the phone.

The union’s attorney

advised that he was relying on the same arguments initially
presented when Granny Goose Foods and Sunshine Biscuits
appeared.
After hearing the argument of counsel, the judge
then granted idle modified restraining order, which is in
issue in this particular case.
The date of the modified restraining order was
May 18, 1970.

And that has a significance to this Court, in

that Boys Market vs. Retail Clerks was up before this Court,

6
and no decision had been rendered.
The union believed that Atkinson vs. Sinclair was
still the law with regard to federal injunctive orders# and
sought to have the matter removed to federal court.
In what has to be a classic case of forum shopping#
the union filed a petition to remove the action to federal
court, hoping to rely on Atkinson vs» Sinclair, to dissolve
the restraining order.

And, in essence, to abate the entire

action and proceeding that occurred in the State court.
When the motions came on for hearing, it was the
position of the companies that Atkinson vs„ Sinclair was not
the applicable law, this Court having indicated in AVCO
that it made a review of the application of Atkinson vs^
Sinclair, and having before it Boys Market, we relied on
the arguments which were being presented to this Court in
Boys Market.
The judge took the matter under submission, and
on June 4th, 1970, seventeen days after the issuance of the
modified temporary restraining order, the District Judge
denied the motion to dissolve, thereby continuing the order
in effect.
It's important to note that between June 4th,
1970, and December 4th, 1970, no answer or responsive pleading
was ever filed by the union in this particular case.
QUESTIONS

When you say that the judge, by denying

7
the motion to dismiss, or to dissolve, thereby continued the
order in effect. That really is one of the arguments you're
making here, isn’t it?

I mean that isn’t an obvious

conclusion, just from that statement, is it?
MR. TICHY: Well, I think there’s two points to be
made heres
One is that at the contempt proceeding, the court,
in ruling on a motion raised by the union that section 527 of
the State law applied, thereby causing abatement of the
order after fifteen days, replied, and I quotes

Am satisfied

that my ruling of June 4th, in which I denied the motion to
dissolve on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction, continues
in full force and effect the order.
So the first thing we have is the judge's own
intention, as admitted in the contempt proceedings.
Secondly, and this of course gets to my argument,
but I'll address myself to it at this point, we're talking
about really two concepts, when we distinguish between a
restraining order and a preliminary injunction.
In a restraining order situation, generally speaking
you wouldn't have notice or opportunity to defend, but in
this particular case we believe that that did exist.

But

the primary distinction between a preliminary injunction and
a temporary restraining order is notice and opportunity to
defend.

8
In the case of the motion to dissolve the restraining
order, the union filed in -those, in fact got an order
shortening time for the hearing in that particular proceeding,
and, in essence, had adequate notice by its own admission in
seeking the proceeding, obviously had opportunity to defend.
QUBSTIONs

But I'm —* my reading of the record, and

you certainly may correct me if I'm wrong, is that the union's
basic position on the motion to dissolve was that Sinclair y„
Atkinson prevented the continuance of this restraining order,
not as a matter of discretion or anything like that, but
simply because of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.
And I don't make, perhaps quite as easily as you do,
the jump that that sort of a hearing is the same thing as if
the union had come in and moved to dissolve a temporaryrestraining order on the merits, in effect, before the time
set for the hearing on the temporary injunction.
MR. TICHY;

You Honor, idle choice rests entirely

with the union as to which argument it wished to present on
the motion to dissolve the restraining order.
Now, it could have, raised an issue as to the merits,
it could have controverted the factual issues, but it did not
do so.

It chose to rely exclusively on Atkinson vs. Sinclair.

And the fact that it chose to rely on a narrow tactical
approach to this did not deprive it of the opportunity, which
is the critical point, I believe, to depend on whatever point

9
it felt would best defeat the existence of the restraining
order.
QUESTION: But, of course, even if they never made
any motion, it's still fair to say they would have had the
opportunity to defend, the rules give them the authority
to come in and move to dissolve a temporary restraining order.
Is that enough, just the fact that they have the
opportunity to do it, to convert a temporary restraining order
into a preliminary injunction?
MR. TICHY:

Your Honor, in this case the issue

that was relied upon by the Court of Appeals in vacating the
contempt judgment was the fact that section 527 of the
California Code of Civil Procedure apparently imposed some
sort of twenty-day limitation on the duration of State court
orders.
Now, this particular section applies only to orders
issued without notice, and we believe that there was adequate
notice in this case, if, in fact, the court had to reach that
issue.
But, more importantly than this, the law in
California is that where you have proceedings which continue
the order in effect, they may take into account such things
as merely getting a continuance on a hearing on a preliminary
injunction.

In fact, cases which are cited by the respondents

in this situation rely on — which are relied upon by the

10
respondents in this particular case, include cases where the
court specifically notes that you can continue the restraining
order through all these other types of proceedings.

And

what —
QUESTION;

So under California law, then, had this

type of proceeding taken place in the State court, -MR, TICIIY;
QUESTION;

That's right»
—- it would have controverted the

temporary restraining order into a preliminary' injunction?
MR. TICHYs

It would have continued the restraining

order in effect, and the denomination of whether or not it
was a restraining order or a preliminary injuction would be
irrelevant for contempt purposes.
QUESTION;

Well, assuming, then, that the State law

— ordinarily, you know, we don't second-guess Courts of
Appeals on —
MR. TICHYs
QUESTION;

Yes.
— their determination of a State law —

assuming now that tire State law, as the Court of Appeals held,
526, would have terminated this interim restraining order at
the end of twenty days,,

Suppose you had never got to the

federal court, what would have been necessary, under your
California procedures, to convert that twenty-day interim
restraint into a temporary injunction?
MR. TICIIY;

Your Honor, if the union had taken the

11
same action that it did here in federal court, the fact that
that motion was dissolved, I believe, under California law,
it would have had the effect of continuing the order for
purposes of contempt —
QUESTION:

Beyond the twenty-day expiration?

MR. TICHYs

Yes.

QUESTION:

If there had just been a motion, as

Yes.

they made it in the federal court?
MR. TICHY:

That's right.

QUESTION: To dismiss, and that had been denied, —
MR. TICHY:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— that would automatically have

converted your interim restraint into a temporary injunction?
MR. TICHY:

Yes, I believe it would, Your Honor.

And I would like to say something about the point
that you raise, concerning interpreting State laws.

That's

what this case is all about.
If the Court of Appeals were correct, it would require
federal courts in all the fifty jurisdictions, the fifty
States in which they sat, to go into a wholesale witch-hunt
to determine what the State law was in terms of restraining
orders, and then you have the complex ambiguities which are
present in this case, resulting in conflicting interpretations
which might exist, disparate treatment throughout the
federal judiciary, and a vast waste of federal time involved

12
in State questions.
That’s why Congress, when it enacted section 1450,
dealt specifically with regard to the duration of removed
orders, making it to continue in effect subject only to
dissolution of modification, to avoid those wholesale
investigations that would be imposed upon the federal
judiciary in cases removed from State courts.
We believe that the particular statute in this
case, 1450, is clear on its face.
in terms of all injunctions.

It talks, first of all,

It's not restricted to injunctive

orders, which have no duration under State court.
Secondly, the language is "until dissolved or
modified by the District Court".
It must be kept in mind that this restraining
order was set for a hearing on a preliminary injunction,
QUESTION: Well, I gather this is an argument that,
under 1450, even if, as a matter of State law, —
MR. TICHY;
QUESTION:

Yes.
—

its restraining order had a terminal

date, —
MR. TICIIY: That’s right.
QUESTION:

— once it was removed, the statute

operates on that order, —
MR, TICIIY:
QUESTION:

You bet.
— you continue it until it’s in fact

13
dissolved,
MR, TICHY:

That is correct.

That is, in essence,

our position, Your Honor,
And I think it stems from basic concepts of
congressional legislation, and that being that the right to
remove is a matter of legislative grace.

And the union in

this case assumed the benefits as well as the burdens of
the statute.
The benefit it thought it had was that it could
remove to State court through forum shopping -- or remove to
federal court and through forum shopping obtain the benefits
of Atkinson vs_,_ Sinclair and get the whole matter thrown out.
The burden that it assumed was that it had the
moving obligation to go into court and seek the dissolution
or modification of the order.

And until it did so, the

order continued in effect pursuant to section 1450,
QUESTION: This order, by its terms, didn't have a
specific terminal date, did it?
MR. TICHY;
QUESTIOrJ:

It just said —

No, it didn't,
--- pending the hearing on the temporary

injunction, you are enjoined from doing such-and-such.
MR. TICHY: That's correct, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

But your argument, I understand from

your response to Mr. Justice Brennan's question, is that
even if it is said you were enjoined until June 4th or June

14
7th from doing this, you say that once it went into federal
court you were enjoined in July and August as well?
MR. TICHY: That’s right, Your Honor, because it
transferred the burden of proceeding.

Because the union,

the defendant — we don’t even have to talk about it in a
labor-management context — the defendant is the only person
who can remove an injunctive proceeding to federal court,
because the complaint for injunctive relief would be
directed against the defendant, and only the defendant has
that right under the Act.
Because he has broken up the process, the law
transfers the burden from the plaintiff to the defendant to
bring the issue before the court.

Because the plaintiff, who

would have brought the issue before the court under his
original order, has been deprived of that because of the
action of the defendant.
We believe that with regard to section 1450 there
are some additional factors which may assist the Court in
its interpretation.

In this regard it’s significant to note

that there are attachment provisions in section 1450 in which
Congress specifically makes their enforcement subject to
State law.

It's obvious, in drafting 1450, Congress had at

its command the language to make a State court order subject
to State law, however it did not do so with regard to
injunctives and other restraining orders,

Hie only conclusion

15

that can be reached is that in not making it referable to
State law, that Congress intended that the specific language
of 1450 would apply and that the restraining order would
continue in effect.
Now, just to add some emphasis, if I could, to my
position that this would involve the courts in some sort of
wholesale involvement in the interpretation of State law,
it's significant to note that there are at least three major
arguments that can be made in support of the position that
527 did not cause this particular order to dissolve.
First of all, 527 applies only to orders issued
without notice.

In this case the definite argument could be

made that this was a restraining order issued with notice.
Additionally, 527 does not cause an order to
expire automatically, if there is some act of continuance?
in this case we believe the denial of the motion to dissolve
was, in essence, a type of action which resulted in a
continuance.
And more importantly you have here in this
particular situation a fifteen-day statute.

Now, at the

time of the Obne 4th order, it was seventeen days after the
issuance of the modified restraining order.

And the judge

entered into some sort of speculative wishful thinking that
the order would have continued in effect for twenty days
rather than fifteen days, and if it in fact assumed the

16

order was in effect on June 4th, there is but one reason
that it could have been in effect on June 4th, and it wasn't,
section 527 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, it
was 1450, which we rely on in this CourtWe also believe that 1450 must take precedence over
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, more particularly rule
65(b) .
In this regard we rely

on 28 USC Section 2071,

which provides that the rules of this Court and of other
courts must be consistent with Acts of Congress, to the extent,
if any, that there is a conflict between rule 65(b) and section
1450, then of course,under 28 USC 2071, 1450 would prevail.
Furthermore, 1450 is specifically directed to
removed orders.

Rule 65(b) is not.

It is interesting to note that neither the legis~
lative history of rule 65(b) nor the legislative history of
1450 would suggest that somehow or another the 1450 was in
any respect to be subservient to rule 65(b).
Furthermore, even if 65(b) did apply in this case,
it applies only to situations where there is an order issued
without notice.

And, as we indicated previously, we believe

that there was sufficient notice in this particular case to
dispense of any of the time limits set forth in 65(b).
In summation, we believe that 1450 should prevail
over State law, as well as the Federal Rules of Civil

1?

Procedure, with regard to the duration of a removed State
court restraining order? that even if this Court were to
engage in an analysis of the State law, as x^ell as the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 65(b), that the order would
have still continued in effect, and the contempt proceedings
would have been appropriate at the time they occurred.
And, furthermore, that the denial of the motion to
dissolve the restraining order was tantamount to the issuance
of a preliminary injunction for purposes of continuing the
injunction effect for enforcement»
On these grounds, jointly and alternatively, we
submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be
vacated and that the contempt judgment issued by the District
Court should be reinstated in its entirety.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Mr. Beeson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DUANE B. BEESON, ESQ.,,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BEESON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

tiie Court:
The respondent union was found to have violated a
temporary restraining order in this case more than six months
after it had been issued, without hearing, and was adjudicated
guilty of criminal contempt.
The basis upon which the petitioners seek to
sustain that finding, which was overturned by the court

18

below, is that section 1450 of Title 28 converted the
temporary restraining order of the State which, as 1 say,
was issued without a hearing into an order of unlimited
duration.

So that it continued on in perpetuity until such

time as the federal court might act on it.
QUESTION:

I’m not sure that it’s relevant, but do

you disagree with your friend, who said that the union was
represented at the preliminary stage and that they were
invited to participate when the order was entered*

Is that

about what he said?
MR, BEESON:

Yes, that is what he said, and

essentially that is what happened.
There was a telephone notice given, which is a
matter of common practice in this jurisdiction.

An attorney

for the respondent union did appear at the time that the
original restraining order was issued.
in the ordinary sense.

It was no hearing

The attorney, under those circum­

stances, is handed the papers two or three minutes before a
conference takes place with the judge, and such arguments
as can be put together on the spur of the moment may be made.
I was not the attorney who was present on that
occasion, but I think that I'm familiar enough with the
practice to represent that this is the way it works out.
QUESTION;

I suppose this is what is common in

many trial courts, that the trial judge, dealing with ex parte

19
injunction, at least wants to be alerted to possible factors
that might lead him to call a hearing before he issues.
MR. BEESON: That may well be, and I think that that
is particularly true in labor dispute cases.
There was no hearing, in the sense that I think you
had just used the phrase, however, that is an opportunity to
examine the papers, collect evidence, talk with the clients
and the witnesses and so forth, and bring forth some kind
of considerations which would support the respondent’s
position, either by way of affidavits or oral testimony.
There was nothing of that kind.
This is an informal courtesy type of proceeding,
which has developed in the bar in the San Francisco Bay
Area in the State of California.
QUESTION:

You say that there was no opportunity

for the kind of hearing to which you refer, under your
practice?
MR. BEESON:

Yes, I would say that, Your Honor.

The application for a restraining order is going to be
determined within a matter of minutes or a half an hour, or
whatever time it took just to talk about the case a little
bit.

And that's what happened.
Now, —
QUESTION;

If you had asked -- under your practice,

if you had asked, then, for a continuance long enough to make

20

inquiry, is that normally done?
MR. BEESON; Well, Your Honor, that's just another
way of sayings

when shall the case be set down for return

on the return date on the order to show cause why preliminary
injunction should not be issued»

And either the judge will or

will not enter a temporary restraining order, pending that
date, depending on how he feels about the case.
QUESTION: Was there a request for it by the union,
for such a hearing?
MR. BEESONs

I am sure that there was, in the sense

that issuance of the restraining order without a hearing was
opposed, on whatever basis the attorney for the union could
come up with on that short notice.
QUESTION; Then you just filed a motion to vacate.
MR. BEESON;

Yes, a motion to dissolve, Your Honor.

That was simultaneous with the petition for removal, so that
the motion to dissolve is filed in the federal District Court.
QUESTION: And once that was denied, what other
step could you have taken?
MR. BEESON;

The next step, in the ordinary course

of a proceeding of this kind, would be the application for a
preliminary injunction on the part of the moving party,
namely, the person seeking it.

And that would be the

petitioners in this case.
QUESTION;

But nothing you could have done?

21

MR. BEESON;
certainty.

Not that -- not certainly with any

The reason that I hesitate, Mr. Justice, is that

conceivably we might have tried to appeal from the ruling
on the motion to dissolve.

I do not think that that would

have been an appealable.
QUESTION;

I don’t think so, either.

QUESTION;

Is that clear?

MR. BEESON; The cases seem to be difficult to align,
Your Honor, in this field.

They turn on their own facts.

A general rule, of course, is that the grant or denial of
a temporary restraining order is not appealable? the grant or
denial of a preliminary injunction is appealable.
Now, it is, of course, true that the particular
label tliat may be put upon the order is not determinative,
and there are cases in which, where the nature of the motion,
the kind of evidence that was brought forth, the argument
that was heard, is such as to be the equivalent of the
raising of the issues that would be raised on a preliminary
injunction.
QUESTION; The union made no effort to appeal the
denial of this motion?
MR. BEESON;
QUESTION:

No, we did not.

And —

Could you renew your motion in the

federal court?
MR. BEESON;

I*m sorry, Your Honor?

22
QUESTION s Could you have renewed your motion in
the federal court?
MR. BEESON: The motion to dissolve was made in the
federal court.
QUESTION: But not in the State court.
MR. BEESON: That is correct, it was not made in the
State court.
QUESTION;

It was made in the federal court

originally?
MR. BEESON;

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION; And did you have a hearing on the motion
there?
MR. BEESON: We had a hearing on the motion to
dissolve, —
QUESTION: To dissolve.
MR. BEESON:

«—■ which was limited to the Norris-

LaGuardia issue, raising, as we did at that time, the law
as it was reflected in Sinclair v. Atkinson.
QUESTION:
MR. BEESON:

Limited by whom?

By the parties?

It was the sole ground which the

respondent union raised.
QUESTION; But you weren't limited, I mean you could
have attacked the injunction on any ground you wanted to?
MR. BEESON; Well, you can file a motion to dissolve
in the federal District Court on any ground that you think will

23

ultimately prevail, I suppose.
QUESTION;
way.

Just let me put that question in another

In what respect did your hearing on the motion to

dissolve fall short of being an adequate hearing on the
issue of the propriety of an injunction?
MR. BEESON: The propriety of the issuance of an
injunction, Your Honor, turns on altogether different
considerations than those which were raised in the hearing
on the motion to dissolve.
We raised the narrow jurisdictional issue as to
whether the injunction could be maintained in the federal
District Court.
Now, with respect to the issuance of a preliminary
injunction, I suspect that the considerations which would
have been put forth would be those which deal with the nature
of the dispute, whether or not this was the — a situation
which could or should be arbitrated, whether or not the union
and the employers were party to the contract which the
petitioners —
QUESTION:

But, in terms of Mr. Justice Blackmun’s

language, you could have raised any considerations with
respect to the propriety of the restraining order?
MR. BEESON:
appropriate to do so.

I doubt if it would have been
The answer to your question certainly

is yes in a theoretical, abstract way, Mr. Justice White,

24

But the ordinary development of cases like tills is
to raise the broader equitable issues in connection with the
hearing upon a motion for preliminary injaction, which
ordinarily comes on a —QUESTION;

But I gather, Mr. Beeson — do I

correctly understand it — what the union was saying -—
suppose we had never decided Boys Market?
MR. BEESON;

Yes.

QUESTION; What the union was saying;

whatever

might be the effect of Sinclair on the authority of State
courts to issue injunctions, once this was removed, then
1450 has to be inapplicable, because Norris-LaGuardia prevents
the federal court from continuing in effect any restraining
order.
MR. BEESON; Well, we don’t need to go that far,
Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Well, but that isn’t what you — was that

not your position?
MR. BEESON;

Our position

QUESTION: At the time you made the motion to
dissolve.
MR, BEESON;

Oh, yes.

As far as — yes, at the

time we made the motion.
QUESTION: That was your basic position, wasn't it?
MR. BEESON:

That's correct.

25
QUESTION:

Well, whether or not the State court

could issue the injunction, Sinclair prohibited the federal
court as a matter of jurisdiction, —
MR. BEESON: That's correct.
QUESTION:

— in light of Norris-LaGuardia? isn't

that it?
MR. BEESON: That's correct.
QUESTION:

You had basically a one-two punch,

the removal and the motion to dissolve and, under State law,
you thought the case was going to be all over.
MR. BEESON:

Yes. We were very confident at that

time.
[Laughter. ]
QUESTION:

And what — did Boys Market come down

while that was pending, or what?
MR. BEESON:

Yes, Your Honor, the sequence of events

was that we filed the petition for removal, and the motion
to dissolve, on May 19, and it was heard on May 27.
QUESTION: We decided —
MR. BEESON:
QUESTION:

Boys Market came down on June 1.
I see.

MR. BEESON: And the court, District Court, declined
to rule from the bench on
Sinclair,

after hearing our argument on

having been advised that this Court had Boys Market

under consideration

26
QUESTION?

I see.

MR. BEESON;

And it was a wet-finger-in-fche-air

to see which way the wind was blowing.
QUESTION;

And we brought it down within three or

four days, was that it?
MR, BEESON;

Yes.

Yes.

And then as soon as Boys

Markets came down, the motion to dissolve was denied.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh„

MR. BEESON;

And only on the ground that Boys

Markets had required that result.

Which, Mr. Justice Brennan,

was a wrong conclusion.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. BEESON: And we have developed this point to
some extent in our brief.

This is not a Boys Markets case.

But we never had an opportunity/, in connection xvith
the motion to dissolve, to discuss those matters, because
Boys Markets at that time was still pending and we were relying
upon Sinclair.
The central issue in this case, if it please the
Court, I think is the correct .interpretation and construction
to be given section 1450 of Title 28.
Now, we start, iri addressing ourselves to that
question, with what I think is a firm premise; and that is
that the State court order did have an expiration date, a
terminal date, a maximum duration of twenty days after its

27

original issuance.
QUESTION;
MR. BEESON;
QUESTION;

And what date was that to expire?
On June 7th.
June 7th.

MR. BEESON; This was the unanimous opinion of the
Ninth Circuit, both the dissenting judge and the majority
agreed X'/ith the fact that you had a limited duration, a
maximum duration of twenty days, with respect to that State
court order.
QUESTION:

Mr. Beeson, you speak of twenty days,

isn’t there something in the statute about fifteen?
MR. BEESON: The statute reads that the return date
upon the issuance of a temporary restraining order shall be
no later than fifteen days after its issuance or, for good
cause shown, twenty days.
Now, the court below felt, that it was a realistic
approach to assume that the twenty-day period probably would
have been used up in proceedings before the State court, if
the case had remained there? and I think that there's good
sense to this point of view, in that by allowing the maximum,
duration to a State court order the court is giving the
maximum application to section 1450 that State law would
invite.
QUESTION:

What if the judge of the Superior

Court of Alameda County had said, in effect:

I don't care

28

what State lav; says, and what limitations there are on a
temporary restraining order, I’m making this one good for a
year.

And the order, by its terms, provided that it would

last for a year. And then the same procedural history had
obtained.
Do you think that you would have been bound to appeal
or do some tiling, or do you think you could just have flouted
the order at the end of twenty days?
MR. BEESON: Well, State law makes very clear, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, that that order would have been invalid
under State law.
QUESTION:
invalidity?

Then how do you challenge that

Do you have to appeal, as some of our cases, like

Walker v. Birmingham, have indicated; or may you simply
disobey it, even though by its terms it prohibits the conduct?
MR. BEESON:

In California, there will not be an

adjudication of contempt for disobeyance of

the void order.

That’s the California rule that's generally applicable.
QUESTION:
MR, BEESON:

Is that the federal rule?
Your Honor, I've read Ex parte Fisk,

back in 1885, and United Mine Workers, and In re Green, and
some of the other cases.

The federal rule may be difficult

to define in a cosmic way, but at least I think where there
is a void judgment, within the meaning of Norris-LaGuardia,
because there was lack of jurisdiction to enter it, along

29

with a lack of due process, in the sense that the opportunity
to attack and challenge the order was never really fairly
permitted, that there are very serious and cogent reasons
for refusing to find the criminal contempt in those
circumstances.
And we develop that point in our brief.
Now, this case does not need to turn on that,
but I think it's a —
QUESTIONs Well, what if we disagreed with you on
that?
MR. BEESON: Well, you have to go a long way before
you get to that point in this case.

Disagreement there does

not necessarily mean that the respondent union would not
prevail here.
If the —
QUESTIONs

No.

I gather here the question is

whether there was an operative restraint on December 4, when
the conduct, which was held contemptuous, occurred.

Isn’t

that it?
MR. BEESON;
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

That’s correct.

So the issue before us is was there

or wasn’t there?
MR. BEESON:

That’:s right.

And I think that that

issue has to be read, has to be determined by reading section
1450 in the light of relevant federal policy.

30

But I think that that's the central point that we
must ultimately return to, after considering everything else.
The words of section 1450 are brief, and certainly
do not necessitate the kind of reading that has been given to
it by petitioners and by the dissenting judge,

I think it

comes through loud and clear, as far as I'm concerned, that
it means exactly what our position is in this case.
The section states that all injunctions, orders,
and other proceedings had in such action prior to its removal,
shall remain in full force and effect until dissolved or
modified by the District Court.
Nov;, in order to know what it is that shall remain
in full force and effect until dissolved or modified, I think
that we are necessarily led to inquire as to what the State
order said and what the State law is that places its gloss
upon that order.
Here we start, as I indicated, with the premise that
the State court order was of limited duration, and we feel
that it's guite clear, as you read section 1450, that the
purpose and intent and plain meaning of the language is to
retain that State court order, in all of its substance, in
all iof its terms, in all of its conditions, precisely in the
same manner in which it was issued.
The order here, as far as we are concerned, would be
no different than if it had an express terminal date, June 4 or

31

June 7, whatever.
And I think that Mr» Tichy's argument recognizes
that his position would have to be the same, even facing an
order of that kind.
Now, —
QUESTION?

So what you're really saying is that if

it had twenty days, then there is no order in effect after
twenty days to be dissolved and modified by the District
Court?
MR. BEESON: That's correct, Your Honor.
At the time we filed the motion to dissolve, of
course, there was an order.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BEESON: And we tried to get rid of it just as
quickly as we could, because we thought that it was improper.
ifowever, with the expiration of the maximum period
which State law permitted it to exist, then there was no
order. And that's what the majority held in the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

No matter where the case was then

residing, in federal or State court?
MR. BEESON:

Well, certainly that would be the case

in the State court.
In the absence of consent by a defendant.
QUESTION:

Well, where was it at the time?

MR. BEESON: Well, after removal it was in the federal

32
court.
QUESTION;
MR. BEESON;

Yes.
Yes.

And that is what gives rise to this case.
QUESTION:
MR. BEESON;

Yes, by its own terms.
The case came to the federal court by

way of removal, and we were trying to find out what section
1450 did at that point, whether it maintained the order in
precisely the same terms and conditions and with the same
duration that it had, or whether it had converted it into
a restraining order without duration.

That's the central

issue.
And I think that the — to read the language as
though this transformation took place is to take a very
strained view, both of the language and the policy considera-"
tions which underlie restraining orders.
Certainly, in the abstract, an injunction is an
extraordinary remedy, to be issued only upon a strong showing
of irreparable injury and the other standard criteria? a
restraining order without notice and without a hearing is an
injunction in its most extreme form.

And it would ordinarily

be thought, apart from any particular statutory considerations
we have at the moment, that anyone seeking to maintain a
restraining order in effect for a very long period of time,
indefinitely, would have a very strong burden of bringing the

33

matter on for a hearing and permitting the parties to make
their considerations knownto the court, as to whether it
should continue or not.
Now, there are strong policy considerations in
federal law which support our position in this respect.
QUESTIONS

Mjt. Beeson, before you get to that.

Is it your position that either under the California law of
twenty days, or the federal lav/ of ten days, this order was
dead in twenty days?
MR. BEESONs That's correct, Your Honor*
QUESTION: Either way?
MR. BEESON: Either way. Either way.
And that we say that section 1450 would be to
strain a concept beyond any reasonable means.
QUESTION: Well, you read 1450 as reading into the
restraining order that this shall expire in twenty days,
just as if it was written in there?
MR. BEESON:
QUESTION:

Yes, and that's what the —
Because the State statute put it in there.

MR. BEESON: That's what the Ninth Circuit did, also,
Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. BEESON:
QUESTION;

Yes,
And —
You disagree with Mr. Tichy that a

comparable motion to dissolve, if it had been made in the

34

Superior Court of Alameda County, you say that would not have
converted this order into a temporary — into a preliminary
injunction under California law?
MR. BEESON:

I know of no State case that would

support that proposition,,

And I disagree with it as a matter

of analysis and logic.
And no case has been cited that would support that
proposition.
I think that we have the same considerations in
California law that would basically be applicable under
rule 65(b), that before a preliminary injunction can be
issued there must be notice of a hearing upon the conventional
types of issues that are raised by applications for preliminary
injunctions.

And that that would be required in California

law no less than under rule 65(b).
Rule 65(b) does reflect federal lav; generally,
and section 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act also reflects
federal law with respect to labor disputes.

Both, place very

strict time restrictions upon the duration of temporary
restraining orders which are issued without hearing,
Section 1450 does not need to be interpreted to
conflict with those policy considerations.
And I might say, although we are dealing here with
a labor dispute case, and we think that we are dealing with a
case that falls within the Norris-LaGuardia Act, that the

35

.interpretation of section 1450,. which is before the Court, —
QUESTION s
MR. BEESON;

You mean the federal?
Yes, Your Honor.

— the interpretation of section 1450, which is
involved in this case, is one which has general application.
Section 1450 applies to all classes of cases,
labor cases that are governed by Norris-LaGuardia, as well as
cases generally.

And it is appropriate to examine section

65(b) and the Norris-LaGuardia Act to see what policy
considerations there are that might help us construe section
1450.
Those considerations, in brief, are that;

temporary

restraining orders are not to be permitted to endure
indefinitely without a hearing.
And section 1450 plainly lends itself to a reading
of that kind, and it is perfectly obvious, as Mr. Tichy has
conceded,- that if you do not read it, section 1450, in that
way, you are confronted with a conflict

between the

meaning of section 65(b) and Norris-LaGuardia, in an appro­
priate case, on one hand, and section 1450 on the other.
We are suggesting a reading which is supported not
only by the language and purpose of section 1450 but also
one which is congruent with the policy that we find in other
areas of the law.
The remaining point which I would like to deal with,

36

briefly , is the contention that even though we may be right
with respect to our view of section 1450, that the ruling
on the motion to dissolve converted the restraining order into
a preliminary injuction, so that from that point on there
was a preliminary injunction in effect, and that would have
the consequence of continuing the restraint, irrespective of
what may have happened to the temporary restraining order»
Noxtf, this consequence is not one which I believe
the District Court judge thought that he was dealing with
when he denied the order to dissolve»

He made very clear

that he felt that he was simply construing section 1450 to
keep the -- I should strike that»
He felt that the only issue that he was ruling
on was the narrow issue of Sinclair v. Atkinson, which was
raised by the motion to dissolve, which had to do only with
whether or not there was jurisdiction to maintain that order
in effect.
And there is nothing to indicate that he felt that
he was doing any more than that»
The order which he handed down was entitled, An
order denying motion to dissolve temporary restraining order,
There was no notice by any party that there would
be an application for a temporary restraining order in
connection with the hearing upon the motion to dissolve.
There were no findings of fact or conclusions of law entered

37
by the district judge.

He did not think that he was

entering a preliminary injunction.

And there was no

opportunity, really —- well, I don't want to go further than
I have to.
There was no actual hearing in which evidentiary
matters or other matters were brought forward and considered
and decided, which would ordinarily be relevant to -the
issuance of a preliminary injunction.
This hearing and this motion had to do solely with
whether or not the order was sustainable in the light of the
Norris-LaGuardia Act, and that was the single ruling that
was made.
QUESTION;

Isn't it also true that there was no

way you could go after the, quote, "preliminary injunction"?
MR. BEESON; That's the obligation of the moving
party who is seeking the preliminary injunction.
QUESTION: But if this — what I mean is, if the
temporary restraining order had merged into a preliminary
injunction, you not only didn't have a hearing, you had no
way of attacking it.

Am I right?

MR. BEESON: Well, —
QUESTION:

Well, you couldn't move to dissolve

the preliminary injunction, could you?
MR. BEESON:

Oh, I suppose we could move to modify

it or perhaps move to dissolve it.

38

QUESTION; But it wasn’t a preliminary injunction,
was it?
MR., BEESON;
QUESTION;

It was not a preliminary injunction»
I thought that was your position.,

MR. BEESON; That is precisely our position, and
it is the position of the majority in the Ninth Circuit as
well, that tills was not a preliminary injunction.
It’s an argument that is sort of — been put
together after all of the events in this case, trying to find
some way in which this motion to dissolve could be turned
into the equivalent of a hearing upon the motion for

But, analytically, it simply can’t

There was never a hearing, there was never a

ruling with respect to the entry or issuance of a preliminary
injunction.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Beeson,

Mr. Tichy, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. TICHY, II, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. TICHY;

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

First of all, with regard to the opportunity to
defend the modified temporary restraining order in this case,
it must be realized that this was an amended complaint merely
to include an additional plaintiff.

There had been a prior

39

hearing on an initial temporary restraining order in which,
according to my affidavit, which is the only one which is
part of the appendix in this case, Mr. Silbert appeared
before the judge and argued vigorously.
Now, there is also within my affidavit —
QUESTION;
MR. TICIIY;

Where do we find that in the appendix?
On pages 52 and 53.

"Copies of the documents were served on Mr. Silbert
shortly before the hearing before Judge Lercara.
Silbert and I were present at this hearing.

Both Mr.

And Mr. Silbert

presented the viewpoint of the union, that there was no
breach of contract, and that the court should not grant the
temporary restraining order.
"Despite argument by defendant’s counsel, Judge
Lercara granted the temporary restraining order."
The same matter is contained on pages 50 and 51,
also one of my affidavits in this matter.
If I could impress the Court of one thing, I wish
to impress it of this facts

we do not believe that labor

injunctions are matters which are easily obtained in State
courts. There are very rigorous procedures which are
followed, because very basically the San Francisco Bay Area
is a labor area, and we follow these rules when we go into
court to get these injunctive orders.
And when the attorney for the union comes down

40

there and he has his people in the courtroom before he
goes in to see the judge, and he says, Is there a strike or
isn’t there a strike?

He goes in and makes the best arguments

that he can.
And in this case he contended that the restraining
order — excuse me -- that the contract was of no force and
effect, and therefore was not being breached, and therefore
there was no temporary restraining order which should be
ordered.
And it was circumstances in light of the fact that
there was an initial complaint, an initial hearing, then an
amendment of the complaint just to add an additional party
plaintiff, that the matter was discussed with counsel for
the union in advance of the hearing, that the court in fact
made a telephonic communication with counsel for the union
before the hearing — before the restraining order was
issued.

There was more than sufficient time to be familiar

not only with the moving papers, but with the issues which were
involved in the particular situation,
QUESTIONS Considering the absolute validity for
the purposes of argument, of the temporary order, when did it
become a preliminary injunction?
MR. TICHY:

MR. TICHYs Thank you, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. TICHY;
QUESTION:

Mr. Tichy, —
Yes.
— ordinarily, if you had had a hearing

on a preliminary injunction and the court had said, All
right, it’s ordered that a preliminary injunction issue,
you would have prepared a document and submitted it to counsel
entitled, Preliminary Injunction, wouldn’t you?
MR. TICHY: That's correct.
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Now, what ■— hew do these Appalachian -—

this Appalachian case, and the others that you cite, treat that
problem that basically you need not only a hearing to grant
a preliminary injunction, but when the court rules you need
findings of fact and conclusions of law, and a description of
the conduct to be enjoined?
MR, TICHY:

Well, Your Honor, I believe that the

court in those particular cases thought that on the motion
to dissolve, that adequate opportunity was given to the
defendants to raise the issues which were in defense, that
the restraining order was sufficiently particular on its
face so that the motion denying the — that the denial of
the motion to dissolve is tantamount to the reinstatement
of the restraining order, as though it was a preliminary
injunction.

43

Now, in tills case there's one additional point
that should be kept in mind with regard to the possibility
of findings.
It's interesting to note that there was no answer
interposed at any time in this particular case, even up through
the situation where a contempt judgment was awarded.

So,

consequently, under rule 0(d) of Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, our allegations in the complaint stood admitted,
including those factual and legal conclusions.
QUESTIONj

Mr. Tichy, you say in your affidavit

it's at fault, don't you?
MR, TICHY: For purposes of considering the
complaint as setting forth what — excuse me.

Perhaps I

should state it this way:
The material allegations of the complaint were never
controverted, and the issues that were presented in terms
of our request for the restraining order, in terms of the
motion to dissolve, and the issues of contempt proceedings,
were very, very fundamental.
In the case of the restraining order, what we were
talking about was, No. 1, was there a contract in effect;
No. 2, was there a grievance procedure; No. 3, was there a
s trike.
When we got to the motion to dissolve, the only
issue which the union chose to raise was whether or not

44
Atkinson vs. Sinclair applied.
And when we got to the contempt proceeding, the
only issue was whether or not there was in fact a strike
occurring at that particular time.
Now, all of these things were totally uncontroverted,
and particularly at the contempt stage when no contrary
evidence was presented whatsoever.
So the fundamental factual issues were always
undisputed.

It was the legal impact to be given to those

particular facts which was dispositive, as far as the
court was concerned? whether or not a restraining order
should be issued initially; whether or not the motion to
dissolve should be denied; and whether or not a contempt
judgment should be entered.
QUESTION;

If it wasn't for the motion to

dissolve, you wouldn't have any right at all, would you?
MR. TICHY:

I take issue with that, Your Honor.

I believe that under 1450 that I would continue to have the
restraining order, if it continued two days or two years.
QUESTION;

The restraining order was for twenty

QUESTION; Well, do pu dispute the California law

QUESTION: Well, is that statute in existence in

MR. TICHY:

Yes, 527 is in existence, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And is it twenty days?

MR. TICHY:

No, Your Honor.

It says on its face

fifteen days and twenty days, but the courts have long since
recognized, and I cite the McDonald vs. Superior Court case,
which is in our brief, that where there is good cause it
may be continued for a longer period if the court deems it
appropriate.
And in this particular case —
QUESTION: Well, did you make any motion to
continue it?
MR. TICHY:

No.

Your Honor, I believe —

QUESTION; So it is twenty days, isn’t it?
MR. TICHY:

MR. TICHYs That's right, Your Honor.

it was dissolved?
MR. TICHYs

Precisely,

MR. TICHYs

Precisely, Your Honor,

QUESTION;

That's your fundamental position, isn't

MR. TICHYs

That's our fundamental position.

it?

QUESTIONS

And then if you get a temporary

restraining order that says this restraining order shall be
effective for twenty days and not one minute longer, when it
goes over to the federal court it automatically is extended?
MR, TICHYs
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor.
That is your position?

MR. TICHYs That is the position I believe not only
of the companies in this case but of Congress in enacting
1450, because the removal action necessarily breaks up the

47
State court proceeding, and because the defendant chose to
remove it, he has the burden of proceeding to dissolve it.
Now, I wish to raise a couple of additional points
before my time runs out.
First of all, in the brief to the Court of Appeals
the respondents contended that this was a Boys Market case,
and it wasn't until they filed their brief in this matter,
before this Court, that they raised the issue that this
might not be a Boys Market case.
The issue was never litigated before, and under
rule 41(d) and (e) of the Supreme Court that is not properly
before the Court at this time.
Furthermore, I wish to emphasise that if we were
to analyze Boys Market and its implications from a policy
standpoint in this case — and let's keep in mind that this
is a 301 suit that was removed from State court to federal
court.

And from the time of Lincoln Mills, from the time of

Boys Market, it's always been recognised that it has been
the purpose of 301 to deprive State courts of jurisdiction
in this matter.
And if we were now to impose Norris-LaGuardia
standards, on every State court removed injunctive order,
which are more stringent than State courts, it would have
the natural effect of disposing of State court jurisdiction,
because unions would, in every case, remove the matter to

43
federal court.# where they could have more stringent
procedural rules, which the employer or the companies would
.have to meet when they sought to maintain an injunctive or
a restraining order.
QUESTION:

Didn't the State Supreme Court, during

the regime of Atkinson, hold that Atkinson had no effect upon
the authority of State courts to issue —
MR. TIOIY; That’s right.

And I think that when this

Court ruled on Boys Market, it recognised that there was this
conflict between State law and federal law, and that was one
of the reasons why the Boys Market decision overturned
Atkinson vs. Sinclair.
We believe that section 1450 is in fact dispositive
in this particular case; that the problems that we've had to
go through here today, analyzing State law, are indicative,
of the problems that the entire judiciary would have to go
through in every removed restraining order, injunctive
order case.
Consequently, we believe that 1450 should prevail
over State law as well as the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.

And, furthermore, that the denial of the motion

to dissolve the restraining order was tantamount to the

■

issuance of a preliminary injunction for purposes of enforce­
ment.
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
