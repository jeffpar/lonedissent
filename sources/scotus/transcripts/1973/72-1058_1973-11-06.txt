PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:,

We will hear arguments

Skinner, Sheriff, Monroe County, et al.
Mr. Eggers, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF
WILLIAM D. EGGERS, ESQ.
MR. EGGERS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I am William Eggers of Rochester, New York,
Counsel for Appellants.

We are here on an appeal from a

final judgment of the New York Court of Appeals.
This, today, is a particularly appropriate day
to here this case, involving, as it does, voting rights.
The question presented is whether New York may
refuse to provide any means of voting, including absentee
means, for its pretrial detainees and misdemeanants under
circumstances when, first, such persons are qualified voters,
not disenfranchised by any state law, secondly, the absentee
voting rights are extended to persons medically unable to
appear in person and to a whole raft of persons unable to —
unavoidably absent from their county of residence and New
York has advanced no overriding governmental interest what­
soever in this proceeding at any stage.
The facts are simple.

Appellants are a class of

4
so many too-qualified voters.

In the fall of 1972, they were

confined in the Monroe County jail as persons convicted of
minor crimes, not any felonies or as pretrial detainees
unconvicted of any crimes whatsoever who were awaiting trial
and unable to post bail.
They have voting age.

They have legal residences

in Monroe County and I must stress that these persons are
qualified to vote.
felons.

New York has, by law, disenfranchised

It has disenfranchised only felons and those are not

members of our class.
Q
others?

What about other institutions for the aged and

I don’t recall, at the moment in this record,

whether the New York statute permits hospital shut-ins and
others.
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, it is precisely our point

that it does present — does provide a means by which such
persons can

vote.
Q

What is the range?

MR. EGGERS:

Hospitals and what else?

It provides, your Honor, for persons

confined at home, at a hospital, or an institution, by reason
of illness or medical disability.
Prior to and at the state court proceedings.
Appellants have fought every possible means of voting.

Any

possible —
Q

Some of these detainees or inmates lived in

5
the next county, that is, had their residence in the next
county.

Would they be entitled to vote?
MR. EGGERS:

under Hew York law.

Yes, your Honor, I believe they can,

The statute has not been construed and

it has not been raised in any court proceeding that I am
aware of, but the statute is quite broad in the persons that
can vote that are out of county.

It includes people that are

out of county by reason of their occupation, their duties,
their employment, persons that are out of county by reason of
a vacation, a wife of a person who is out of county by reason
of his occupation, a wife can vote and the statute is quite
broad and I believe that it would cover people in the same
position that our people are in, If they happened to be out­
side the county of their legal residence.
There is also, in Hew York State, a program of
mobile registration which

would permit volunteer registrars

to set up branch offices for registration in various locations
and in the fall of 1972 this was done at various shopping
centers, at schools and, in fact, the volunteer registrars
were willing to set up facilities in the visiting areas of
the Monroe County jail and register inmates of the jail in
that fashion and the sheriff denied that request.
Q

Hr. Eggers, are you talking about initial

registration to vote or when you say registration for
absentee ballots, is that basically an application for an

6
absentee ballot?
MR. EGGERS:
that we have.

Your Honor, there are two questions

One is simply the ballot or some means of

voting on election day.

But, of course, to be able to vote,

you have to be registered so we are also raising the question
of whether inmates of the jail can be registered by
absentee means or some other means that they can

have at the

jail.
Q

Some of your class, then, are not registered

voters?
MR. EGGERS:
are registered.
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

Some

Some are not registered.
Is there provision for registering by absentee

means for other kinds of voters?
MR. EGGERS:

Yes, there are, your Honor.

They are

almost identical to the means by which people can ge'o
absentee ballots.
Q

They are.

MR. EGGERS:

You can get a — you can register

by absentee if you are confined in a hospital or an institu­
tion or at home by reason

of a medical disability.

You can also register by absentee means if you
are out of county.
Q

I asked the question because the state with

which I’m — the only state, really, ivith which I have any

7
basic familiarity requires registration in person although it
has very, very liberal absentee voting provisions.

That is

not true in New York.
MR. EGGERS:

That is not true in New York, no.

Now, your Honors, the two lower courts construed the
absentee registration and balloting statutes in our favor.
They said — and the key term was "physical disability" and
they found that our people were physically disabled in the
sense that they physically could not get to the polls.

They

thus avoided the Constitutional question.
The New York Court of Appeals then reversed.

They

dismissed the petition that we had filed and in which we had
broadly asked for any sort of relief available under state
law and they left us with no possibility of relief whatsoever
under state law.
Now, they rejected all means of voting in person.
They construed the statute and they ruled against our
Constitutional claims which we had raised at every single
stage.

So the question now is quite clear-cut.
We are contending, simply, that the state interests

that are asserted in support of these classifications in
the statutes are not the kind of state interests that justify
the denial of a fundamental right.
It is as simple as that and I think the decisions
of tiiis 'Court make it quite clear that when you have a

3
fundamental right, such as voting, then you take a hard look Q

I thought you said the right was Constitu­

tional?
MR. EGGERS:

It is both, your Honor.

It is a

fundamental right that is grounded in the Constitution.

I

think —
Q

Does that make it a Constitutional right or

something else?
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, I believe it is a

Constitutional right and it is so important that it is a
fundamental right under the decisions of this Court.
Q

Well, are some Constitutional rights more

fundamental than others?
MR. EGGERS:
hierarchy of

Well, I wouldn’t want to create a

Constitutional rights.

I think that there is

at least one, and that is the right to vote, that is the
most fundamental of all rights because this is preservative
of every single right that a person might have and I think
that this was recognized in the Rodriguez case of last term,
where there is a footnote that says very clearly that at
least voting rights are considered fundamental in the sense
that they are grounded in the Constitution.
So I think that what we are talking about here are
there
the rights that are very important and that/has never been a
question about that, and at least that equal voting is a

9
Constitutionally-grounded right.
protection clause.

It Is grounded in the equal

You have an equal right to voting, equal

with other citizens of the state and this particular right is
a right, a personal right of citizenship.
It really tells a citizen, does he count?
Expecially today, does he count as a citizen?
Q

Are the two sides of this case, one, just on

those awaiting sentence and others those who have been
sentenced?
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, that is correct except

that the ones that are awaiting sentence or that have been
sentenced or have been sentenced only for misdemeanors —
Q

Well, we understand that, but now, let’s

assume that a state had a law that said, "The following
people are disenfranchised, that may not vote, one, felons,
convicted felons, two, convicted misdemeants."
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, that would be quite a

different case because the state, then, would have —
»

We are not talking here —
Q

Well, In effect, you are just saying the

state here, as a result of the interplay of all of Its
provisions, misdemeanants, convicted misdemeanants, just may
not vote, if they are serving a sentence.
MR. EGGERS:

If they are serving a sentence

because, of course, take a misdemeanant who is convicted, on

10

a work-release program, can vote the same as any other
citizen.

So I think we have a question, also, of due process

in that respect.

Would it

be consistent with due process for

the state to deny the right to vote in the arbitrary way that
it is done here?
Q

And it hasn't gone across the boards.
And what about procedural?

MR. EGGERS:

Well, I think procedural as well,

your Honor, because we have the question of whether the
standards — there are any standards, is there a right to a
hearing?

This kind of procedural due process would have an

interest as well.
Q

What would remain in this case are people who

are just detained for trial, wouldn’t that be?
HR. EGGERS:

That is correct, your Honor.

X think

that the persons who are simply detained, they have, of course,
a higher claim because these persons are presumptively
innocent under our law.

That is a fundamental principle of

our lav/ and I think that there are many decisions of the
lower courts that recognized that pretrial detention has a
limited legitimate purpose.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll resume there

after lunch. Counsel.
[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon from
12:00 o’clock noon to 1:00 o’clock p.m.]

11
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Eggers, you may

resume.
MR. EGGERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As I have outlined, this case involves the
absolute denial of fundamental rights and if it were not
enough that fundamental rights are at stake, the particular
class here affected is the only class that is forcibly
restrained from attending the polls by state action and.
with respect to this class, I think we'd have to ask
whether the state's application of its criminal process is
consistent with due process of law with respect to the
deprivations of these particular

rights and I think you’d

have to ask whether these deprivations are the necessary
consequences of confinement in jail.
Q
state in

McDonald

You had the same sort of restraint by the

McDonald, didn't you?
MR. EGGERS:

Well, your Honor, the restraint in

was the same.

The impact on fundamental rights

was different because in the record in the McDonald case,
there was no showing that the state would not provide the
alternative means of voting that we have requested and, in
this case, have been denied.
So you had before the court what the court termed

12

to be an Incidental burden, persons for whom voting by
absentee would be a convenience but according to the
presumptions that the court made in that case, not the only
means left to them.
In our case, this is the only possible means
left to them because we were denied the other rights.
And although the statutes, the discriminatory
statutes that we are challenging here are not drawn on their
face on the basis of race or wealth, they have a very heavy
burden on those persons who are financially unable to post
bail.

If the person were charged with the same crime but

could post bail, of course, he could vote just the same as
any other citizen could.
So we have here a combination of factors that, we
submit, requires this Court to require the very strictest of
equal protection review, the highest standard that this
Court applies in any case and that standard, of course,
requires tha,t we take a look, a very hard look at the sort
of governmental interests that are justified because those
governmental interests must be overriding in the sense that
they are enough to justify the absolute denial of voting
rights and the tests, I think, are three.
The interest asserted has to be of compelling
importance.

The means that the state uses has to be closely

related to the purposes.

And they must not

unreasonably

13
burden the exercise of fundamental rights and there must be
an element of necessity about the state’s claim.
Q

It can’t -

Well, on that basis, then, you would have

convicted felons also vote?
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, we would not.

Convicted

felons are specifically disqualified by the state under its
election laws.

This is a state Interest that is related to

the qualifications for voting because I think there Is a
presumption that if a person has committed a very serious
crime, such as a felony, that he has not shown the respect
for law that a person that is going to vote should have.
•

Q

Then you draw a distinction between a

convicted felon and a convicted and incarcerated misdemeanant?
MR. EGGERS:

We do, your Honor, because the state

has done so.
Q

Well, that doesn't prevent attack on what

the sta/te has done.

You are merely saying that you would

accept that distinction?
MR. EGGERS:

We learned that no member of the

class that I represent, none of my clients, are convicted
felons.

So that we don’t raise the question of whether con­

victed felons may vote by absentee ballots.
Q

And you won’t be in here tomorrow insisting

that they be?
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, I represent the clients

that I have.
Q

You might if you represented another felon,

a convicted felon.
MR. EGGERS:

Well, I am not saying that that

question is not a proper question.

I am saying it is not

raised today.
Q

Your point, as I understand it was that the

misdemeanor case allowed weekend home privileges or something
of that kind, might give an extension over Tuesday and you'd
be free to vote.
MR. EGGERS:

That is correct, your Honor and, as I

understand the lav/, if a misdemeanant is confined out of
county in Hew York State, he may vote.

It is certainly clear

to me under the federal voting rights amendment of 1970 that
ne is unavoidably absent from his county and entitled to vote
in special Presidential elections, at least.

I think the

Hew York State absentee statutes v/ould also permit such a
person to vote by absentee, if he is merely confined to outof-the-county of his residence.
So we don't have involved here a claim by the state
that all misdemeanants lose the right to vote.

It is not

involved at all.
Q

Your fundamental approach is an equal

protection approach is it not?
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, that is our fundamental

approach.

1/e are claiming an equal right to vote but we are

not — we are also raising —
Q

In favor of whom is there discrimination, as

compared with your client?
MR. EGGERS:

The discrimination is in favor of

persons who are confined in hospitals, in institutions, or
at home on medical grounds and it is In favor of persons who
happen to be confined out of their county or residence.
It is also discrimination, I think, in favor of
a number of other persons that are out of county on vacation
or for any other reason.
Q

How about misdemeanants who are appealing

and are on bail?
MR. EGGERS:

Most persons certainly can vote In

Hew York State,
Q

Can felons who are convicted but are on

appeal?
MR. EGGERS:
Q

Ho, your Honor, they may not vote.

Uh huh.

MR. EGGERS.

Because by virtue of the conviction

itself, a felon loses his right to vote.

So we are dealing,

in our class of persons, we have only persons that are
qualified to vote, under Hew York State lav;.
Q

Well, Mr. Eggers, you are not arguing apart

from your equal protection, are you?

16
MR. EGGERS:
Q

Your Honor, we are.

That this is First Amendment right and

cannot be denied, irresptective of —
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, I believe that voting

rights are more important than the expression of rights that
are in the First Amendment.

I think that they may reasonably

be related to First Amendment rights.

But I think we are

raising a second point, to answer Hr. Justice White's
question fully, we are raising a due process claim that
persons can find, especially as pretrial detainees, do not
lose all their rights.
Q

Well, I understand that.

I was just talking

about the convicted ones, who are serving sentences.
HP. EGGERS:

Well, I would say the same as

misdemeanants because prisoners don't lose all their rights.
That's held even as the felons.
courts.

They have access to the

They have access to —
Q

Well, you are arguing the felons' case in a

way.
MR. EGGERS:
Q

Well, your Honor, we think it is —

Or is that outside of your case?

MR. EGGERS:

We think it is a different case when

the state has considered the question as to qualifications
for voting and said that the commission of specific crimes,
the high crimes, disqualify you as a matter of voter

/

17
qualification.

But, of course, the state hasn’t said that

as to misdemeanants and I think that as to minor crimes it
would be very hard for the state to say that that alone
should justify the denial of voting rights.
Q

And even if it had said so with respect to

convicted misdemeanants, it would be rather odd to make the
right to vote depend upon the location of the jail, wouldn’t
it?
i*IH. EGGERS:
Honor.

I couldn't agree with you more, your

I think that is a truly arbitrary means of denying

the right to vote.
Q

Except an argument could be made that

prisoners in a local jail would be amenable to pressures
from local politicians running for office.
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, that is a reason that

was accepted by this

Court in McDonald's case under the

rational basis test.

But I think to address myself to that

particular reason, it seems to me very strange to tell
somebody that he may not vote because state officials might
interfere with his right to vote.
If our rights were that easily lost, it would
seem to me no rights would remain at all because there are
any number of means by which the state could address itself
to that particular problem.

It could make it unlawful for

a local official to interfere with the rights of citizens

18
to vote, influence their —
Q

Well, it wouldn't be interfering, it would

just be — well, don't you suppose there would be very
serious First Amendment problems if the state purported to
tell somebody running for office that he couldn't try to
persuade a group of voters?
HR. EGGERS:

Well, I think methods of persuasion

are one thing, but if the deputy sheriff were to use something
more than persuasion, I think that that might be a very
serious problem.

But it is the sort of problem that the

state can deal with by restrictive means, means consistent
with the exercise of fundamental rights.

Certainly —

excuse me, your Honor.
Q

Suppose your clients — assuming they got the

right to vote by absentee or however it would be accomplished,
is there a

Corollary First Amendment right along the lines

Hr. Justice Stewart was suggesting, that the candidates all
appear before them and make speeches so they can be informed
about the issues and make intelligent choices?
HR. EGGERS:

Well, your Honor, I think that they

already have the means that are necessary to inform themselves.
They can have access to newspapers.

They can receive infor­

mation through the mail and I don't think that there would be
a need to adopt such a corollary right, at least not in the
absolute way.

There could be written statements presented to

19
persona confined in jail
Of course3 somebody could be confined in jail a
very short time before an election and he may be fully
informed on the issues of the day and yet, under the
construction and under the denials we have In this case,
that person would be denied the right to vote.
So I think that that is not a substantial reason
that is involved here for the denials.
Q

Mr. Eggers, let me ask another question

about what I regard as a very unusual statute.

It refers

to unavoidable absence because he Is an inmate of a Veteran’s
Bureau hospital.

Suppose he is down at the county hospital

or Columbia Hospital in New York City.

I take it he is

not entitled to an absentee ballot and then down, later, it
speaks of "unavoidable absence due to business or vacation."
If he is outside the county attending the
funeral of a relative, he is not eligible.
Or maybe I should ask your Opponent this?
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, I think that the

Veterans’ Hospital case, that particular situation, is one
that you can be in-county confined in a Veterans' Hospital
and you can vote and really, it is very similar to other
persons in county hospitals, or in any other hospital
within a county.

They are entitled to vote because they

are unable to attend the polls In person.

20

Now, I think that it is a very strange statute.
It is strange because it denies my clients the right to vote.
Q

But there are other classes of people who are

also denied the right to vote.
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, I am not so sure of that.

There are — the New York Court of Appeals referred to two
in particular.

They referred to poll watchers and poll

watchers can vote the same as anyone else can.

It is simply

a part-time job for the day and you may have to take time on
your lunch hour to vote, but so does everybody else.
Q

How about the classes that Justice Blackmun

has mentioned?
MR. EGGERS:
be some

Well, your Honor, I think there would

question with respect to particular classes as to

the construction the Hew York courts would give that class.
Because if they are going to extend the right to vacationers,
it would seem to me — and all you have to be is out of
county on a vacation — it would seem to me that that is quite
a broad basis for construing almost anybody as being at least
partly on a vacation.
The statute is quite liberal, it seems, on its
face and aloows most people out of county to vote.
Q

Well, it is liberal in certain directions.

MR. EGGERS:
directions.

It certainly is liberal in certain

It is not liberal towards the class that I

21
believe is a disfavored class, a class — and I am referring
to my client — a class who is, in the terms of Judge Burke
from the court below.
Q

Well, I may be just as sympathetic to the

person that is in the county hospital as distinguished from
the Veteran’s Hospital.
MR. EGGERS:

Well, your Honor, any person can find

in any hospital —*
Q

In fact, much more sympathetic than to a

convicted misdemeanant.
MR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, any person who is

confined In a hospital, any hospital in New York, and
unable to get to the polls, is provided for by the statute,
as I read the statutes.
Q

And, of course —

Well, I guess I don't read them that way

and —
MR. EGGERS:

There is a — the statutes —- there

are a number of statutes that apply to this case and they
have not properly been meshed together but I think —
Q

Do you drav; any distinction between a

convicted misdemeanant and a detainee at all, or do they
stand or fail together?
HR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, I think the detainee

has a higher claim under the due process laws because as to
him, any unlawful denial of

rights is a much higher concern

22

of this Court because that infringes our ideas of the
presumption of innocence.
As to those persons, I think there is a very
special claim here.

But what I am suggesting is that

because New York has not made the claim that a misdemeanant
is unqualified to vote, then, in many respects, he is in the
same position as the other members of our class are and in
respects that are directly before this Court.
So I think, then', we come to what governmental
interests are being asserted here and, in fact, they haven’t
identified any.

The New York Court of Appeals and the

Appellees in this case don't even claim that there is a
compelling interest and when they say that something — that
it is at all reasonable, it seems to me if you take a hard
look at any sort of interest that they are claiming, it is
not even reasonable.

They say it is a problem of the fact

of confinement.
Well, there is no difference in their confinement
than people who are confined in hospitals.
vote by mail.

They can register by mail.

They can both
They could, if the

means were provided.
Q

What if the state didn't give any absentee

ballots at all, would you still be here or not?
HR. EGGERS:

Your Honor, I would be, but I may

point out that the fact that there are absentee ballots means

23
that there qre quite an easy means.
to the state.

It is no problem at all

If there were none, I think that they would

still have to defend against our claim that registration and
jail facilities — voting facilities could be set up In the

jail.
I call the Court's attention to the case of
Love against Hughes, in which a district court, federal
district court sitting In Ohio, faced a case almost
exactly the same a3 this case, a challenge to the absentee
statutes and a request for any other means simply directed
the Sheriff and the Board of Elections to establish
election facilities in jail by paper ballots and ballot
boxes.

I see no reason why this is unworkable.
Q

Well, if there were no absentee ballots

under Justice White's hypothesis, you say that you x^ould
still be arguing they should set up registration facilities
in jail.

Would you — I suppose then they would have to

set up, under court order,

registration facilities in

hospitals and other places, too, since your clients would
have no better claim to vote than other people physically
disabled.
Mil. EGGERS:

Well, your Honor, I have to say,

frankly, that I think that they do have a better claim.

They

are the only class of citizens that are restrained by the
state.

They are the only class for which, we have to ask, Is

2H
this state confinement consistent with the due process clause?
And I think it is consistent with the due process
clause only if the rights that are lost are justified,
either by law or as necessary consequences of confinement.
Q

What would you say about the state's mental

institutions?
MR. EGGERS:

Well, your Honor, I believe that that

relates to the qualifications of a person to vote,
that is confined in a mental hospital and

A person

can't get to vote

because he is confined, the state may legitimately say, I
think, that such a person may not be a qualified voter and
may want to avoid having a test of sanity in each case. I
think that there are great state interests involved in that
case.
Q

Even though he is there voluntarily, rather

than by committment?
MR. EGGERS:

Well, to be in the same position that

other people are in, he would have to be confined and unable
to get to the polls.

Now, if it is simply voluntary so he

could voluntarily obtain his own release —
Q

Well, not always —

MR. EGGERS:
Q

— he is not barred.

— they can go in for 30 days and be

confined.
MR. EGGERS:

If such a person were, in fact, fully

25
confined, it still seems to me the state has good reasons to
question whether that person is an eligible voter.
That case, however, is not before the Court because
we are simply concerned about the discriminatory treatment
between our clients and other persons such as medically
confined persons who can vote.
Q

And yet some of your clients are there

because of their own fault.
MR. ROGERS:

Well, certainly, your Honor, as to

pretrial detainees, we can’t make such a presumption.
Q

No, but I am speaking of the other group.

That is why I asked before whether you drew a distinction
between them.
MR. EGGERS:

Well, as I say, I think that there is

a higher claim for pretrial detainees.
As to misdemeanants, your Honor, they haven’t
committed the sort of crimes that the state says disqualify
them from voting and I think this Court still has a special
concern with

whether state-imposed confinement has

consequences that are unnecessary.
For example, a prisoner doesn’t lose his right to
practice his religion in jail.

He doesn’t lose his access to

the courts or access to the mail and I think that there are a
number of rights that a person has, even though he has
committed even a felony, and we don’t have that case here.

26
Your Honor, I believe if we take a hard look at
the sort of governmental interests that are asserted here,
we simply don't find any that can stand up against the right
to vote and they have to come up with a governmental interest
that is overriding in the sense that it can justify the
absolute denial.

I think they haven’t done that and I ask

this Court to reverse the New York Court of Appeals.
Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the remainder of
my time?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Eggers.

Mr. Consedine.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF
MICHAEL K. CONSEDINE, ESQ.
MR. CONSEDINE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The County of Monroe contends, your Honor, that
these statutes are

remedial statutes

the franchise in the State of New York.

established to expand
They are not

statutes aimed at any particular class in question today.
They were not aimed at misdemeants serving time in a jail
after the time for registering and voting has expired nor
were they aimed at persons being held and detained pending
a disposition of a case, again, after the time for registering
and voting by absentee ballot has expired.
Further, we feel that there is not really a class

27
here that would come within the ambient of the protection of
the l4th Amendment because you really don’t have a legal class
as such.

You have certain persons who can't make bail., who

are not — who really, in the State of New York, who are
incarcerated after seven days before election.

Anyone who is

released up to seven days before election may register and
vote, under our statutes.
The Court of Appeals

of the State of New York has

held that this statute, which expanded the franchise
considerably in the State of New York over a period of time,
does not fall xvithin the equal protection clause because these
persons have this disability imposed upon them by
impracticalities and contingencies.
There are, of course, reasons under the —
Q.

What is the impracticality, the fact he

doesn't have money?
MR. CONSEDINE:

Well, if your Honor please, I am

not entirely sure what was in the Court of Appeals' mind and
to my mind, I think they were touching on the rational basis
test.

You can conceive —
Q

Well, is there any reason that the man in

jail solely because he cannot produce bail —
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q
than money?

Well —

—■ from the man who can produce bail other

28
MR. CONSEDINE:

Well, that xtfould relate only to

detainees.
Q

That is all we are talking about.

MR. CONSEDINE:

Yes.

And, your Honor, you must

consider the fact •Q

You mean detainees as contrasted with —

MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

Misdemeanants, convicted misdemeanants.

MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

Misdemeanants, yes.

Convicted misdemeanants.

Well, I am only talking about -—

MR. CONSEDINE:

All right, so these detainees —

consider this fact, your Honor, these detainees, between the
time they register to vote and the time they can vote, may
turn into felons.
Q

There is —

And wouldn’t that apply to any other person

who registers?
MR.
Q

CONSEDINE:

Wouldn’t it?

MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

Your Honors —

Well, that’s true.

Wouldn’t it?

MR. CONSEDINE:

Yes, that’s true.

That could

apply to almost anybody that registers, but —
Q

It sure could.

MR. CONSEDINE:

— there is a likelihood, a

greater likelihood that this particular type of person may

29
fall in that category.
Q
innocent,

I don’t agree with that, either.

That man is

lie is absolutely innocent —
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

— and the Constitution says he is innocent.

MR. CONSEDINE:
that point.

Well ~

The — I agree with your Honor on

I think the issue here is ivhether this particular

type of person is a class, is a suspect class, as this Court
has declared race and wealth to be.

And your Honor feels that

the fact that a man may not make bail may bring this into the
area of wealth.
Q

Well, I don’t agree with that, your Honor.
Do you have anybody in New York that you

jailed because he just didn’t want to put up the money?
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

No.

Or he likes jail?

MR. CONSEDINE:

But, your Honors, there are cases

where bails are very high and even a person of moderate
wealth cannot make them.
Q

Well, that still doesn’t tell me why.

MR. CONSEDINE:

The reason for ball is to insure

the person’s attendance at court.
Q

Well, I am just saying the reason that this

man can’t vote is because he didn’t have money enough for
bail.

Is there any other reason?
MR. CONSEDINE.

That may be a reason.

However —-

30
Q

Well, what other reason —

MR. CONSEDINE:

Your Honor, I am saying that bail

that the reason he cannot vote because he doesn't have enough
money to bail doesn’t bring this within the suspect
classification based on wealth because there are cases where
balls are very high, in serious cases, $100,000 — $50,000.
That doesn't —Q

Do you know of any misdemeanor cases like

that ?
MR. CONSEDIIJE:
no, I don’t, your Honor,

Well, we were just referring —
We vie re just referring to that

class who are- being detained prior to there being a trial
for a felony.
Q

You mean, there are a number of detainees

who are under charges of felonies and where bail is set
very high, there may be homicides, there may be armed
robberies?
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

That’s right, your Honor.

And rapes and so forth.

MR. C0N8EDIME:

That’s right and my contention is,

that would take us out of that area of —
Q

Aren’t these detainees, some of them of that

kind?
MR. COWSEDINE:

There are detainees that are there

because bail is extremely high.

31
Q
they?

Now. these detainees are not only — or are

merely detainees —
Q

It is misdemeanors.

Q

— held on misdemeanors?

MR. CONSEDINE:

Oh, no, no.

No, there may be

detainees waiting for a case —
Q

Homicides —

MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

— a homicide case.

Armed robberies.

MR. CONSEDINE:

They are indicted with a felony,

being detained because —
Q

Well, I am sure that is so but I didn't know

we were talking about them in this case.
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

And I am sure there are a lot of people

detained for trial on felonies.
Q

Yes.

MR. CONSEDINE:

Misdemeants and pretrial detainees,

I believe, is the class referred to in this case.
Q

Well, at the time of this case, how many were

there charged with murder?
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

Well, I don't know.

Or serious felony.

MR. CONSEDINE:

I don't know, your Honor, what —

which of these 72 men were charged with felonies.

I don't

32
know whether any of them are at the present time incarcerated.
Q

Well5 then, this is basically just the people

who are being held in the Monroe County jail?
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

For one reason or another.

MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

That is right.

For one reason or the other.

And people who are being held in that jail

who live in Monroe County.
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

Who live —

Otherwise, according to your brother, they

could vote if they live in another county.
MR. CONSEDINE:

If they live in another county,

there is reason to believe they may vote and also it excludes
persons who have applied for absentee ballot before their
incarceration.

They’d naturally received it.

be forwarded to them.

The mail could

They could vote by absentee ballot In

that case.
Q

That would require quite a high degree of

prescience, wouldn’t it, to apply for an absentee ballot
before you are incarcerated?
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

No, a person —

Not if they are going to be on vacation.

MR. CONSEDINE:

That’s right.

A person who may

have other reasons to think he needs it and In between the
time he registers for an absentee — he registers for an

33
absentee ballot, is incarcerated.

That could conceivably

happen.
The — we are relying heavily on this Court’s
determination in the McDonald case.
Q

I want to be clear about this — under your

statute, even if they are held for homicide and rape, armed
robbery, any other felony, if they live outside the county,
they may vote, as detainees.
MR. CONSEDINE:

The statute — as I understand it,

refers — and it is very complicated, but these

statutes

refer to those persons who live in the county who are unable
to attend the poll due to the various reasons given here,
for instance, business duties.

We also have statutes

relating to military service.
Q

Am I right in my assumption that —

MR. CONSEDINE:

I only think so.

I’ve come to

that conclusion and the Board of Elections in Monroe County
has come to that conclusion.
also.

act under that assumption

So that is not an issue here.
Q

Yes.

MR. CONSEDINE:

,

They

I think the issue is basically a
(

14th Amendment issue and we’ve set up an illegal classification
here.

And should you impose a very strdngent standard test

here, xve feel that the Court has clearly stated in
McDonald — and Mr. Justice Brennan has stated in McDonald

34
and, subsequently, in Osser, that absent equation of a
suspect class heretofore relating primarily to race and
wealth, such stringent standards should not be applied.
We feel that, on the record, there is no showing
that any attempts were made to promote legislation in the
Hew York State Legislature to expand this.
Q

Well, am I correct that the prisoners

are not organized?
MR. CONSEDINE:

I don’t understand your question,

your Honor.
Q

Well, the prisoners couldn't promote

legislation, could they?
MR. CONSEDINE:

Well, the prisoners are

represented here by six attorneys whose names appear on the
brief.

They could certainly promote legislation, if they

feel it is worthy.
Q

I am saying there are so many —

Do you know of any group of obviously non-

voters being able to persuade any legislature to pass anything?
MR. CONSEDINE:

Your Honor, these prisoners are

protected by a number of groups.

For instance, you notice

the name of the New York Civil Liberties Union is upon here
and my brother here is attorney in one of the most
prestigious law firms in the upstate New York,

They have

many people who would press their cause in New York State
legislature.

I am saying that there are conceivable —

35
Q

Do I hear you correctly that the fact that the

legislature hasn't been persuaded to pass these legislations
which would correct the evil which the other side contends
is a grounds for making it Constitutional?
MR. CONSEDINE:

I am saying, your Honor, first,

that it is not an unconstitutional evil if, in fact, it is
an evil.

I am stating that it is not within the ambient

proprotected by the l^th Amendment because the state
legislature, by no legal design, has established a class
who is being denied the right to vote by absentee ballot or
to register by absentee means.

I think we are arguing here

just that right to vote and register by absentee means.
Q

To vote.

MR. CONSEDINE:

We feel the fact that they have

expanded this privilege to various classes but have not
expanded the same to New York State to prisoners who are
misdemeanants or less —
Q

And who live in the county.

MR. CONSEDINE:

And who live in the county and who

are detainees for some reason, prior to conviction — are not
felons but are, for some reason, detained without conviction —
the fact that this class has not been included in the
statute does not bring that class under the protection of
the 14th Amendment because, frankly, unlike all the other
cases this Court has decided, there is no showing that the

36
state legislature singled them out for some disability.
They were not saying, "Black people rnaj'- not vote,"
or they were not refusing — by their refusal to act —
disenfranchising suburban counties where they, as you handled
the one man-one vote decisions — this is a case where the
State of New York, the legislature, has expanded over the
years, this privilege.

They may do so further.

There may,

indeed, be other classes who don't have this privilege.

I am saying there are many complications involved
here.

The argument I was going to raise has been already

raised by a member of this Court.

Such persons might be

subject to manipulation, either by the jailers of the
political machine that controls the jail or by certain
prisoners within the jail.
Q

Why do they permit voting by those

incarcerated or detained outside the county?
MR. CONSEDINE:

Well, the legislature, no doubt,

is satisfied that there are not — that, you know, that—
well, I don’t know what goes on in the mind of the legislature.
I am saying that —
Q

Well, you just said you did.

MR. CONSEDINE:

No, I am saying, your Honor, that

there are many, many questions —
Q

You gave me a justification.

MR. CONSEDINE:

Well, I am relating to the

37
rational basis there.
Q

What rational basis is there for permitting

voting by those detained outside the county?

Certainly not

the one you were just giving?
MR. CONSEDINE:

No, no.

I don’t think this

legislation — I am saying the legislature never considered
this particular class of person when it drew up this
legislation.
Q

Well, then, you, on the rational basis test —

MR. CONSEDINE:

I am saying the legislature should

consider this.
Q
unconstitutional

But meanwhile, what do we do, say it is
or constitutional?

MR. CONSEDINE:

Well, If you find that it is

within that suspect classification, then I am sure that you
will find it is unconstitutional.

I — we are arguing that

It is not.
Q

You haven't suggested to me a rational basis

yet for saying that those confined inside the county may not
vote, but those confined outside may.
Q

Well, I suppose

somebody confined in Monroe

County who lives in Onondaga County Is not —■ a. Monroe County
Sheriff is not going to have any particular interest in the
outcome of the Onondaga County case and, therefore, whatever
manipulation he might apply to the local man who would be

38
voting in the Ilonroe County race wouldn’t carry over to a
guy who is just going to vote in another county.
MR. CONSEDINE:

Yes, your Honor, that would be a

rational argument, but I think that —
Q

Wouldn’t it also be rational if they both

belonged to the Sheriff's Association, he might?
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

I beg your pardon?

If both sheriff’s belonged to the same

Sheriffs’ Association, he might.

I mean, you can go anywhere

you want on this.
MR. CONSEDINE:

Well, your Honor, again, I — I

don’t -— I’m not familiar with the operation of the
Sheriff's Association in the State of New York, so —
Q

Weil, to go back to Cowan against Maryland. ,

of course, we don’t need to look for articulated reasons, if
there is any conceivable basis.
MR. CONSEDINE:

Any conceivable basis is the

thrust of that Gowan case, your Honor.
Q

If you think of any other conceivable basis,

then they should be advanced.
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

The —

Isn’t this the kind of a case where the

statute has grown like Topsy,' so to speak?
MR. CONSEDINE:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

And all of a sudden, you have some similar —

39
or the opposition feels there are some seeming Inequities
here.

As you said a little while ago, I am sure the

legislature hasn't thought all these things completely
through.
MR. CONSEDINE:

Yes.

Basically, my argument is

this, that the legislature — that the classification here is
not a suspect classification and, therefore, there is a
reasonable, rational basis for this legislation and if there
are inequities, certainly, the state legislature would be at
this time the proper body to remedy them.
I was impressed by the Court of Appeals’ decision
in that it pointed out that these particular 72 gentlemen are
denied their right to vote by absentee means by not — not by
any legal design of the legislature.
Your most important cases have all borne upon
actions of the legislature that discriminates against a
suspect class or has consistently refused to promote a classes
right to vote.
Thank you very much, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank

you,

Mr. Considine.
Mr. Eggers, you have a few more minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP
WILLIAM D. EGGERS, ESQ.
MR. EGGERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
These are not the sort of rights that can be left
for legislative action.

We can’t be told that this is

reform legislation, therefore, we have to go to the
Legislature.

It doesn’t make sense when we are talking

about Constitutionally protected rights.
Q

Well, if we start with that premise, of

course, the whole problem becomes easy.
MR. EGGERS:
Honor.

Well, I think that is right, your

This is a fundamental right.

It is not the sort of

right where we can be asked to depend on the legislative
whim because if it were that sort of right, we wouldn’t be
before this Court.

This is an important, fundamental right

and we have a problem here of the denial of equal treatment
in voting rights.

It is not just any economic or social

regulation where reform legislation —
Q

In one of the cases cited this morning, was

referred to Justice Clark in an opinion, you may remember the
name of it — it said that a classification made by a
legislature need not be perfect.

It may be overinclusive or

underincluslve but that that alone does not make it
unconstitutional.

41
MR. EGGERS:

Well, your Honor, I think it depends on

the sort of rights that are involved, the sort of class that is
affected, and when we have fundamental rights,
Q

and we have —

This issue rarely comes up except in

Constitutional context.
MR. EGGERS:

Well, in a Constitutional context,

your Honor, but there are many cases that might involve
rights less important than these and there it might be
appropriate to refer to the legislature and to say, "Well,
this is reform legislation and in this particular area, we
are going to consider this when we are considering whether
this stature is reasonable,but not when we are going to apply
this standard of judicial scrutiny that is required in this
case."
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and I now submit the
case on behalf of my clients.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Eggers.

Thank you, Mr. Consedine.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:37 o’clock p.m., the case

was submitted.]
