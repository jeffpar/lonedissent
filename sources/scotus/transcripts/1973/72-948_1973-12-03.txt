MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Ho. 72-948, National Cable Television v.
United States and Federal Communications Commission.
Mr. Feldstein, you may proceed whenever you are
ready„
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART F. FELDSTEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FELD,STEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case this morning arises from an appeal from the
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion upholding the fee
schedule of the Federal Communications Commission as it applies
to the CATV industry and, in particular, that portion of the
fee schedule which is related to annual fees on a per sub­
scriber basis.
In general, the facts are as follows:
In 1952, as a rider to the Appropriations Act, Title
V

was appended.

This title gives the Federal Communications

Commission and all other sc situated agencies the power to
enact fees to collect some of the costs of regulation which
they incur.
As a part of this Act, the Budget Bureau, under the
President's Office, was directed to perpetrate some kinds of
standards for the collection of the fees.

The operative

document in this case,, which is appended in the Appendix, is
Budget Bureau Circular A-25, which was last amended in 1959, so
that is the circular we are working with under these fees.
Under these two pieces of authority, in 1963 the
Federal Communications Commission first enacted fees.

These

fees were enacted in Docket 14507, and they were based on ap­
plications for licenses and other kinds of filings made in front
of the FCC.

These fees collected approximately 25 percent of

the budget of the Federal Communications Commission.
There were appeals from these fees which, incidentally,
did not apply to the CATV industry because CATV was not at that
time regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.
The Seventh Circuit, in a case called Aeronautical
Radio, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, and later
this Supreme Court, affirmed the FCC's fees, and in so doing
stated that Title V of the 1952 Appropriations Act enabled the.
FCC to collect these filing fees.
In 1970, the Commission decided to revise its fee
schedules, so they filed in February of 1970 a notice of pro­
posed rulemaking.

This notice of proposed rulemaking proposed

to do three or four things.

It proposed to raise the filing

fees, it proposed to add CATV for the first time, including
filing fees, since they had now taken jurisdiction over CATV
as far back as 1955 and 1956, and annual fees were added.

In

particular for CATV, the anmial fees were to collect some 90 to

5
95 percent of -the fees which the FCC decided it wished to
collect from the CATV industry.

These annual fees which were

adopted later in 1970 were done on a per-subscriber basis, 30
cents par subscriber.

A CATV system obtains the vast bulk of

its revenue from sxibscribing homes which it hooks up to its
system, and it is usually expressed, the size of a system is
expressed in the number of subscribers.

The FCC therefore

stated its annual fee is on a basis of a per subscriber fee,
thus 30 cents.
Parenthetically, as is noted in our brief, the 1972
still outstanding rulemaking proposes to raise these fees from
'3'p cents per subscriber to 40 cents.

Appendix I saw some figure as to the total cost to the Commission for the people engaged in the regulatory work relating to

7i;v:

Do you recall what that figure is, just approxi-

•i 4 <

MR. FELDSTEIN:

v

;

Yes, the activity costs are on page

' 3

31 of the Appendix, and it gives the cost as $1,145,400 or 4.6
percent of the FCC's budget.

How, these costs incidentally are

both direct costs of the Cable Bureau and attributable costs
such things as the Field Engineering Bureau and the
Commissionersf offices, which cannot be attributed lock, stock
and barrel to one activity but are spread as a-percentage
across, so you have direct costs and then you have indirect

6
costs.
Q

Is it fair to say that if cable television dis­

appeared from the face of the earth for some reason or other,
that most of that $1 million-plus would be out of their budget?
MR. FELDSTEIN:

I would presume so, yes.

Several parties appealed the Commission's report and
order of July 1970, and the first appeal was filed in the Fifth
Circuit, so ail appeals were transferred there, and in the Clay
case, which is the decision before you, in 1972 the FCC was up­
held in all particulars.
The CATV industry's appeal was based on the annual
fee, and the allegations were, that the annual, fea was not .re­
lated to the statutory criteria of the Appropriations Act and
had misapplied the criteria stated in Budget Bureau Circular
A-25.
Now, in more detail, the authority to collect fees
comes from Title V, and this is reprinted on page 151 of the
Appendix, and in that section they state that "It is the sense
of the Congress that any" -- and it lists several things, these
types of activities done by an agency -— "shall be selfsustaining to the full extent possible," and then it states
"subject to such policies as the President may prescribe,"
which is the authority for Budget Bureau Circular A--25, and
then it goes on to say, ciboufc two-thirds of the way down that
statute, and these are the operative criteria that the fees

7
must be "fair and equitable taking into consideration

one,

"direct and indirect cost to the Government," two, "value to
the recipient," three, "public policy or interest served, and"
— four —- "other pertinent facts."
Q

Mr. Feldstein, I think the parties are agreed

that the authority to assess these fees focuses in this par­
ticular statute nowhere else, this is it.
MR. FELDSTEIN;

That is correct.

The companion case

has some arguments about stuff in the Federal Power Commission
Act, but there is no authority in the Federal Communications
Act, with one small example which has nothing to do with CAW,
so we are discussing this particular statute.
Budget Bureau Circular A-25, which begins on page
142 of the Appendix, interprets this statute and lays out for
the federal agencies how they are to go about setting fees.
The first important statement is on page 142 of the
Appendix, under section 2, Coverage, where it states in the
j

second line, "the provisions of this Circular cover all Federal
activities which convey special benefits to recipients above
and beyond those accruing to the public at large."
Then on page 143, all of section 3(a) states the
criteria, the most important of which are set out right in
the top of the page where it states, under ''General Policy,"
"A reasonable charge, as described below, should be made to"
one, "each identifiable recipient," two, "for a measurable

unit or amount of Government service or property from which
he," three, "derives a special benefit."
So the identifiable recipient, measurable unit of
service, and special benefit criteria are what I believe I sub­
mit that we should be looking for in the promulgation of these
FCC fees.
Q

Mr. Feldstein, do you think that the Bureau of

the Budget Circular covers the Federal Communications Commis­
sion?
MR. FELDSTEIN:

I do, yes, sir.

The assumption has been made that it did.

This ques­

tion was not handled in the court below, and the Congress in
the hearings which are cited by the government in I960, which
urged the agencies to go forward, were urging the Commission to
go forward under this, and the Federal Communications Commission
was one of the examples that were used in the original legisla­
tive history.
Now, under "Special Services" on page 143 of the
Appendix, several things are listed.
Q

Let's assume the Federal Communications Commis­

sion wrote back to the Budget Bureau and said "your construc­
tion of the Act is very interesting, but we have a different
view and we prefer our own view."

The Bureau of the Budget has

no direct authority over the Commission I guess, does it?
MR. FELDSTEIN:

No, but in the process of budgets, in

9
the process of promulgating forms, in the process of many
things that the Commission does, you must go through the Bureau
of the Budget..
Q
tion?

For example, when the Commission —
Well, I understand that, but how about my ques­

Coxild it say “you wouldn't approve of this particular

type of fee, apparently, but we think it is fully consistent
with the Act and we are going to follow it."

There is nothing

the Bureau of the Budget could do about it, is there?
MR.

FEIDSTEIU:

I think that the Act states that you

must follow the criteria that are set down by the President,
thus the Act states that subject to such policies the President
ma.y prescribe —
Q

What are you reading now?

MR. FELDSTEIN:

I am reading in the middle of Title V

which is found on page 151 of the Appendix.

And it is pursuant

to this phrase that Budget Bureau Circular A-25 was promulgated
by the President's Bureau of the Budget.
Q

Evan so, I don’t suppose the Bureau of the

Budget could itself •— whatever it said would have to be
authorised by the Act or consistent with it, I suppose?
MR. FELDSTEIN:
Q

That is correct.

That is correct.

Mr. Feldstein, that part you are reading from

there on page 151, the policies as the President may prescribe,
is preceded by the language "which, in the case of agencies in
the executive branch, shall be as uniform as practicable and

10

subject to such policies as the President may prescribe."
Doesn't that suggest that that is perhaps a more limited cate­
gory of agencies thaswould be covered by the Act itself?
MR. FELDSTEIN:

The government, I believe, has sug­

gested this in one paragraph in its brief.

But I believe that

the legislative history of the Act substantiates the view that
it was intended that such guidelines would be set down for all
agencies which were both congressional and executive depart­
ments, and as such the guidelines in Budget Bureau A-25 have •—
the agencies that have promulgated fees have attempted to follow
these, no matter which category they had been in, and this was

the area which was looked at in fact by the courts in the
Aeronautical Radio case.
Q

Going back to Mr. Justice White's question about

the potture of the Budget Bureau’s Circular, I suppose it is a
fact that all of the agencies must put their budgets through
4'

the Bureau of the Budget and that historically it has been a
coordinating agency and because of its aiithority to shape and
trim

the budgets of the agencies, it has considerable leverage,

does it not?
MR. FELDSTEIN:
Q

That is correct, yes.

Whether this --- Congress could, of course, in­

crease a budget, but the Budget Bureau has initially a great
deal of authority in the way of enforcement here, do they not?
MR. FELDSTEIE:

Yes.

Yes.

Thus, when the Commission

11
goes to the Bureau of the Budget with its budget, difficulties
which OMB has are hammered out, thus the Commission's budget
may be decreased or increased by the Bureau of the Budget be­
fore it ever sees the appropriate Appropriations Committees in
Congress,
Q

The agency may not generally ask for something

which the Bureau of the Budget and OMB has declined to approve,
is that not correct?
MR. FELDSTEIN:

That is correct.

The criteria in the Budget Bureau Circular are then
fallowed on page 14.3 of the Appendix by a listing of the kinds
of special services for which fees are authorised to be col­
lected.

Thus, in 1(a), (b5 and (c), there are examples,

receiving patents, crop insurance, license to carry on a
specific business, certificates of necessity and conveniencej
and (b) safety inspections of craft, et cetera.
We submit that the common thread in all of these ex­
amples is that a particular identifiable entity has received an
identifiable benefit.

The legislative history of the Act, I

believe, bears this out.

Thus, in the Senate reports, which

are quoted at some length on pages 22 through 26 of the MCTA
reply brief, you will find language to that effect, likewise
the sole floor comments, since there was very limited floor
debate on that, by Representative Yates, printed on page 25 and
26 of our reply brief, talk about getting fees back for a

12
portion of the operations, talks about applications or certifi­
cates of public convenience and necessity being paid for by the
person who applied for it.
So that it is our feeling that the legislative history
supports the interpretation of the Act which we are giving and
which we feel that the Budget Bureau gave in Circular A-25.
Now, in Aeronautical Radio, what was before that
court, the Supreme Court and the Seventh Circuit, were the
questions under specific filing fees.

And unless there be any

doubt of that, cn page 33 of NCTA’s brief, opening brief, we
quoted front the Commission’s report and order at that time,
where the Commission was adopting filing fees and stated that
they were obtaining to the fullest extent possible fees for
services which bestow special privileges and services upon
certain individuals who may apply for those privileges and
services.
So certainly what the FCC was doing at that time was
decidedly limited to the voluntary filing for special privileges.
Then in the New England Power case, which is the
Companion case to this one, the court there was faced with a
similar interpretation as to what the FCC is attempting to ask
this Court to interpret the Budget Bureau Circular and the
statute as, and in that case it was rejected.

And I will get

into that one a bit more.
These then are the authorities which are prevailing

for the justification of the FCC's fees and the limits that we
feel are placed on. them.
Mow,, going down in the argument, the criteria, in
terms of special benefit, we have aruged in our brief, and
the government has argued back and forth as to whether the FCC'
regulation of CATV has provided any special benefits to the
CATV industry.

It is our allegation that the FCC’s regulation

has been bad for our industry, that it lias had a very deleteri­
ous effect, and that in fact in the years under review here,
from 1968 to 1972, which cover all of the years of the fees
that are under review today, there was in fact a freeze on
CATV growth.
Up until 1966, or *65, rather, there was a rather
unlimited growth on CATV, it was limited by its own constraints
and limited by local law but not by the FCC.

Starting in 1965,

the FCC began to regulate quite heavily and their 1966 second
report and order, which was reviewed by this Court in U,S. v.
Southwestern, that particular report and order did not work out
well, and there is plenty of documentation to that effect in
the briefs and in the FCC’s own reports and orders and notice
V

*

of proposed rulemaking proposing to change their rules.
In December of 1968, all growth of CATV in the larger
markets was frozen.

Several attempts to unfreeze this situa­

tion went for naught and, finally, in February of 1972, long
after the fees in question were enacted and long after the

14
appeal

from the fee schedule was taken, the FCC adopted scone

new rules in 1972.
The FCC has attempted to bring these 1972 rules into
play in this case.

I very strongly submit that whatever the

1972 rules do or do not do for the CATV industry, they were not
the rules and not the regulations which were in effect at the
time that these fees were promulgated, nor were they in effect
for the two and a half years in which these fees were collected
and that which cover the period from the promulgation of the
fees ih 1970 until the new rules in 1972.
Now, the Commission has stated that even in 1970, at
the time that these fees were promulgated, there was much to say

.tv

h

•

for the;PCC?s regulation that would give a special benefit to
V

' j

f•

i , if

the CATV industry.

Thus they state that wo had to have author­

ization or permission or they could have stopped us, however
you wish to phrase it, for the carriage of signals, especially
distant signals.
They also state that the phone company, the General
Telephone case, in which they put phone companies out of the
CATV retailing business in their service areas, was such as to
give us open entry and eliminate a potentially anticompetitive
threat.
I say to you that the New England Power rationale for
this, without even arguing about whether this was good or bad
for us, the New England Power rationale is the proper rationale.,

15
page D8 and D9 of the Appendix D to our petition for certiorari.
Q

Is that the Court of Appeals decision?

MR. FELDSTEIN:

That is the -- yes,, that is correct.

This question of economic climate in regulation
generally benefiting the entire industry is dealt with at some
length in a long paragraph on page D8 and D9 of this opinion
which, to repeat, is appended as Appendix D to our petition
for a writ of certiorari, where the court states:

"The

creation of an economic climate is not a special service noi­
ls a particular pipeline or gas company, substitute CATV system,
the special beneficiary of such a climate any more than any
other CATV system or the consumer in general."
Skipping then to the last portion of the paragraph,
"The Commission's inadequate response that the identifiable
recipient is the whole industry assumes that each company re­
ceives a benefit directly proportional to revenue," which is
the case in our situation, where the fee is being collected
proportional to revenue because they are collecting it per
subscriber.
There is far more to regulation than simply what the
FCC was doing and in fact is doing.

They have played down to a

considerable extent the franchising in stats regulatory activi­
ties which go on.

No matter what the FCC says, there is no

CATV system in a town until the community authorizes the oper­
ation of the CATV system.

16
The Commission's statement that the valuable benefit
received from the authorization to carry signals is strange in
light of the fact that this Court in Fort Nightly held that
there is no monetary liability for the carriage of signals for
a CATV system under the copyright law, and thus we submit that
not only are the FCC5 s regulations, at least those empowered in
1970, those in force in 3 970, not of benefit to the entire in­
dustry, but that there is far more to the regulation of cable
te3.evisi.oxi than that which the FCC did in 1970 and in fact
which they do now.
Q

Are you saying that there is some benefit to the

cable television industry when telephone companies were taken
out of the play, out of the picture as competitors?
MR. FELDSTEIN:
true.

Yes, to a certain extent, that was

It certainly wasn't true for those CATV systems which

were owned by telephone companies, nor was it true for those
areas where the

telephone company posed no threat.

But, yes,

generally speaking, the CATV industry welcomed, certainly NCTA
was an intervener on the side of the. Commission in the defense
of the rules which put the telephone companies out of the busi­
ness in their particular area.
However, even assuming, going on then to the next
argument, even assuming that some of the their regulation can
be stated to be of some benefit to the entire industry, and I
would hope that any regulatory agency’s regulations would at

17
least be of some benefit to the industries which it is regulat­
ing .
The statute, as interpreted by the- Budget Bureau,
call for an identifiable recipient, thus yoit call for a special
service to a particular company.

The crux of this entire case,

I believe, is the FCC’s and the government's statement that
where you benefit the entire industry, you can recover the
regulatory costs for that on a pro rata basis.
The examples given in the Budget Bureau's Circular
A~25, as I quoted from page 143 of the Appendix, would not lead
you to conclude that.

They talk about receiving a patent, crop

insurance, license to carry on a specific business, an airman's
certificate, et cetera.

In other words, something is gotten by

an individual from his government.

He is not simply a member

of an industry which is being regulated, and that is the key.
That is the key to this case, and that is the key which the
Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia saw in its inter­
pretation of Title V, where it stated that, no matter what kind
of benefiting you were doing as an agency to the entire in­
dustry, that was not sufficient.

That was public interest,

that was consumer in general, that was entire industry, that
is not what is meant by Title V and is not what is meant by the
Budget Bureau Circular A-25.
Thus, what I am saying is that there is no relation
between the fee and the services, and this is in two ways.

A

18
particular CATV system may have no dealings with the FCC during
the year at all and still get charged the same fees as the same
size CATV system which had considerable dealings with the FCC.
And, furthermore, even if both of my hypothetical systems had
dealings with the FCC, the number of subscribers, which is the
key to the annual fee, is totally unrelated to the work dona
for that particular system.

Thus, what the Commission is doing

here is taxing the entire industry to recoup the entire cost of
its regulatory program.
If that were to be the law, there would be no practical
limit on the amount of fees that the FCC could collect so long
as they could obtain a higher budget for their CATV regulation.
If there are no further questions, I would like to
reserve the remainder of ray time for reply.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Feldstein.

Mr, Roman?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD R. KORMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. KROMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The Department of Justice appears here today on be­
half of the United States and the Federal Communications Com­
mission to urge affirmance of the unanimous decision of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which

19
sustained the Federal Communications Commission9 s construction
of an act of Congress, Title V of the Independent Offices
Appropriations Act of 1952.
The issue presented here is whether the activities
undertaken by the Commission with regard to the CATV industry
come within the categories prescribed in Title V of the Act
and therefore compel the Commission to impose an annual fee of
30 cents per subscriber per month to be paid by each CATV
system in order to reimburse the taxpayers of the United States
for the costs incurred in sustaining these activities.

These

costs exceeded $1 million in 1970-71, and will exceed $3
million in the coming fiscal’ year.
The amount, of the fee as calculated initially came to
something in the neighborhood of one-half of one percent of the
I

gross revenues of the CATV industry.
A number of cases involving the CATV industry have
come before this Court in recent years, and there is really
little need to discuss here the nature of that industry or its
phenomenal growth into a $500 million a year business serving
some seven million subscribers.

That $500 million a year

figure is almost double that of only four years ago.
Essentially, as the Chief Justice stated in his
concurring opinion in the Midwest Video case, CATV systems ex­
ploit existing broadcast signals to which they make no contri­
bution by plucking them from the air and transmitting them over

20
cables generally strung over telephone poles to subscribers who
are hooked into the system and who pay generally speaking a
monthly fee in the neighborhood of $5 to $6 a month.
Now, the implications for such a rapidly growing
system through the carriage of broadcast signals placed the
CATV’s activities clearly within the ambit of the regulatory
jurisdiction of the Commission, which is charged by Congressin section 151 of Title 47 to make available to all the people
of the United States a rapid, efficient nationwide and world­
wide radio communications service, with adequate facilities at
reasonable charges.
Petitioner here charges — challenges the annual fees
imposed by the Commission' on several grounds.

And before get­

ting into them I would like to speak for a moment to the
Bureau of the Budget’s circular that has been referred to by
petitioner.
First, that is not and does not purport to be "an
■: !

interpretation" of Title V.

It simply is what it says it is,

namely some general policies for developing an equitable and
uniform system of charges.

The Bureau of the Budget circular

was adopted pursuant to the statement in Title V of the Act
which says that in cases — in the case of agencies in the
Executive Branch, the fee shall be as uniform as practicable
and subject to such policies as the President may prescribe
for agencies in the Executive Branch, which the Federal

Communications Commission clearly is not.
And, as a matter of fact, the Bureau circular itself
is addressed to heads of executive agencies and establishments.
Moreover, it is quite true, as the Chief Justice pointed out,
that the Bureau of the Budget does have extensive leverage
which it can use even with respect to an independent regula­
tory agency.
But it should also be pointed out that the Bureau of
the Budget is fully aware of what the Federal Communications
Commission has done every year.

It has been advised at the end

of every year precisely what the Commission is doing.

Indeed,

it was at the urging in part of the Bureau of the Budget, now
the Office of Management and Budget, that the Commission acted
to substantially increase its fee schedule.

So that the Com­

mission is not bound by the particular language of the Bureau
of the Budget circular.

If it was bound by it, it would seem

that the determination of the Executive Branch, which I repre­
sent here as well, that the Commission has complied with those
guidelines should be sufficient.

This is not a regulation,

doesn't have the force and effect of statute? it is merely
policy guidelines.
Q

Was this Circular A-25 in fact addressed to the

Federal Communications Commission?

Was the Commission, .in

other words, one of the addressees?
MR. KORMAN:

Well, the address of the notice, as it

22

appears in the Appendix -—
Q

Is to the heads of executive departments and

establishments, and I wondered if that —
MR. KORMAN:

It may very well have been, I am not

certain„
Q

I wondered if that did or did not include the

Federal Communications Commission.
MR. KORMAN:

I am not certain of whether they were
S'

actually on the mailing list.

I would think they probably

should be, even though they are not technically bound simply
because it is not a bad idea for them to try and formulate
their policies consistently with other agencies of the Executive
Branch if they feel they can do so consistent with their obli­
gations under the statute.

I mean we are not -— and the Com­

mission, of course, looked at these guidelines and attempted to
follow them, and we believe they have in formulating the
annual fee„
Q

I take it that your point or a point that you

made is that the Commission is .not an executive department
and/or establishment.
MR. KORMAN:
Q

That is correct, but nevertheless —

And further that the statute, Title V, requires

uniformity to the extent practicable only with respect to
agencies in the Executive Branch.
MR. KORMAN:

That is correct but, nevertheless, as a

matter of policy, I am not suggesting that it would be undesir­
able»

Well, I think generally it is a good thing to have a

uniform set of schedules —
Q

Is symmetry just good for its own sake?

MR. KORMAN:
Q

Well —

Should you treat things alike that are different?

Is that wise and desirable?
MR. KORMAN:

No.

I mean the Federal Communications

Commission, as far as the general public is concerned, and as
far as the industry subject to regulation, it is a small matter
to them whether technically the Federal Communications Commis­
sion. is viewed as part of the Executive Branch or whether it is
viewed as a creature of Congress and an independent regulatory
agency, and it would seem desirable that where you have, at
least in the eyes of the public, the view that it is simply
part of the government, that agencies that appear to be part of
the government act in a manner that is consistent provided that
the particular agency feels that it can act that way and still
adhere to the mandate which Congress has given it.
Ilow, petitioner challenges the annual fee on two
grounds.

First, it contends — let me say one more thing.

We

are not suggesting that we are in any way conceding that we
haven't complied with this Bureau of the Budget circular»

I

just want to put our position in proper perspective in that
many of the words and standards that have been suggested by the

24
petitioner, applying key words like identifiable arid officiary,
measurable unit of government service, all of those things do
not appear in the statute.

And as petitioner conceded in

response to Mr. Justice Blackman's question, the question pre­
sented here, and it is presented in the first question of the
petition for certiorari, turns on a construction of the Act and
not the Bureau of the Budget circular.
Now, first it is petitioner's contention that the
Commission's function is to serve the public interest, and
that they do not receive any benefits from regulation.

Indeed,

they claim that the overall effect of the Commission's regula­
tion has affirmatively hindered their economic growth.
Second, they claim that even if the CATV industry
does receive benefits, the Commission erred in the manner in
which it applied the criteria in Title V in calculating the fee.
We submit that both of these claims x*sre properly rejected by
the Court of Appeals.
First, with respect to the petitioner's initial
claim, we believe that the issue here does not depend on whether
the CATV industry as a whole benefited or was harmed because or
as a result of Commission regulation.

It seems to us that

everyone who enters a business which is effected with a public
interest must of necessity expect to be regulated, and regula­
tion means being told to do things that you don't like as well
as things that you would like to undertake.

They must expect

25

to be told, that all of their activities must be conducted in
a manner subordinate to the public interest, whether they like
it or not.
Yet the language of Title V clearly suggests that
those subject to regulation pay the costs of that regulation,
and at least several instances which are relevant to this par­
ticular case.
This is clearly shown by the references to charges
for the cost of issuing licenses, permits, certificates or
similar things of value.

How, the only reason one needs a

license to do anything is because, as a regulatory program
which requires you to get the license, and yet Congress said
after the fullest extent possible the agency should recover the
cost

of issuing that license, permit, certificate or other

thing of value.
Moreover, it is equally clear that Congress intended
that regulatory agencies not only be reimbursed "to the fullest
extent possible for the cost of issuing these licenses," but
that they also recover costs incurred in activities which
confer benefits which are special, that is benefits which the
regulated industry would not receive but for the fact that
they were being regulated by the Commission.
And it is our submission that the Commission's regu­
lation of the CATV industry implicates both aspects of this
Act.

In the first place, since 1972, Commission regulations

26

-

have required all CATV stations to obtain certificates of com­
pliance.

That is, the Commission has adopted regulations with

respect to the franchising of CATV stations which divide re­
sponsibility between the local community and the Federal Com­
munications Commission.
Essentially, what the Commission does is set out
broad guidelines which have to be followed by the local agency,
local authority in issuing its certificates.
Q

Well, that is not true.

A franchise is not a

license in any sense of the word, is it?
MR, KORMAN:
Q

Well, in the sense —

I mean, it is not equivalent in other words to a

radio or television broadcasting —
MR. KORMAN:

Well, they couldn't operate without it.

bow, I don't know —
Q

Well, that doesn't answer the question, does it?

MR. KORMAN:
not limited to license.

Well, the statute uses words which are
It says license, certificate, permit,

other thing of value.
Q

Well, that doesn't answer the question either.

MR. KORMAN:

Well, it is certainly not the same as a

broadcast license.
Q

It is not a license, is it?

It is called a

license, and it isn't a .license, and there is no other author­
ity, is there, to license?

MR. KORMAN:

Well, it is called a certificate of

compliance without which they couldn't engage in this activity.
Now, whether that comes within a dictionary definition of a
license, it is certainly the equivalent of it, and I think the
language of the statute is so worded as to indicate that the
Congress intended that that ought to be covered.
they couldn’t operate.

Without it,

Of course, without ----- in a sense, there

is joint franchising authority here, because without local
aufchorifcy the FCC, the CATV station couldn’t string up its
cables, but all that authority is is to string up its cables.
They still have to get the Commission's approval to carry the
signals over the wires.
Now, I am not going to say that technically under
some definition of license that this is clearly a license, but
this is one of those statutes that is worded in a way in which
Congress used .every conceivable synonym -Q

You mean that could apply?

MR. KORMAN:

Yes, that could possibly think of to in­

dicate the breadth of what it was —
Q

in any event, the filing fees, the so-called

filing fees as such are not in issue here, are they?
MR. KORMAN:

Ho, they are not really — they don't

begin to recover it to the fullest extent possible, the real
cost of these proceedings.

I think the filing fee for a cer­

tificate of compliance is $35 which merely covers the

28
mechanics of issuance.

The real cost of the hearings, maintain­

ing staff and carefully reviewing the certificates or constant­
ly monitoring the industry.
Q

How do you consider that the phrase "to the full

extent possible," does it mean the same thing as the "fullest
extent possible"?
MR. KORMAN:
Q
possible."

I never heard the phrase "to the full extent
Have you?

MR. KORMAN:
it before.

Yes, and —

Anywhere else?
I haven't thou gilt about whether I heard

I don't have any recollection of ever hearing it

before,
Q

Are you suggesting that the certificate of com­

pliance is to be equated with a certificate of public convenience
and necessity, for example?
MR. KORMAN:

Yes, and there are substantial benefits,

let me say, that accrue as a result of the issuance of this
certificate.
Q

Mr. Korman, would the Commission turn down an

application from a. proposed CATV applicant by reason of the
fact that he duplicated the area covered by someone already
having a certificate, or would it leave that up to the local
franchiser decision?
MR. KORMANt

I would think it would leave that up to

the local franchising authority.

Let me say that one of the

reasons there isn't the kind of monopoly protection in a sense
that televisions get, it is because, as a practical matter, the
local CATV system has a natural monopoly.

That is, once it is

established and has gone through strining up the wire, it
generally has an agreement with the telephone company for use
of the cables, it charges $5 a month and it has its subscribers
and the start-up costs for going into the CATV business are
very substantial, and it is not generally the fact that there
are more than one CATV system operating in an individual area.
Nevertheless, the Commission has undertaken action to
limit competition for the benefit of the CATV industry at the
request of the CATV industry.

It has gotten the telephone

companies, for example, out of the CATV business at the request
of the CATV industry, at the request of this particular peti­
tioner here, who told the Court of Appeals, in asking to inter­
vene in support of the Commission's regulation, that the regula­
tion was essential to the existence of an independent CATV
industry.
Q

Did the action of the Commission getting tele­

phone companies out of the business occur during this period
that we are talking about, this four-year period?
MR. KORMANs
Q

Yes, it did.

And are you charging the telephone companies for

that service, putting them out of business?
MR. KORMAN:

No, we are not charging them for putting

30

them out of business.
Q

Well, are you —- these charges would be levied

against, wouldn’t they, the telephone companies so long as they
were in business during this period?
MR. KORMAN:

Well, they were in business for an inter­

im period, but these petitioners here purport not to represent
those companies.
Q

They are —

Well, they represent the industry, don’t they?

MR. KORMAN:
CAW industry.

Well, they represent the independent

They weren’t representing the telephone —

y /

O
aren’t they?

Well, in any event, those fees are in issue here,
The fees are charged against everybody.

That is

what is before us hare, isn’t it?
MR. KORMAN:

Well, we haven’t raised any kind

of

standing issue but, of course, they have standing to raise the
claims cf their members.

Mow, if the telephone companies want

to come in here and complain about the fee, I suppose they are
perfectly free to do so.
Q

These fees are charged against those companies -™

MR. KORMAN:
q

Yes.

whom you put out of business?

MR. KORMAN:

Who will be going out of business but,

since they are in business for years in which they are paying
the fee, they are still benefiting from Commission regulation.
Q

Quite a benefit.

31
MR. KORMAN:
Q

Well —

Are you suggesting that it is inherent in any

regulatory agency that it giveth and that it taketh away, but
that either act is part of the regulatory process, is it not?
MR. KORMAN:

That is correct.

What we are saying is

that, regulation, when you go into business that is affected
with the public interest, you have to expect to be told to do
things you don't like.

What we are charging for, in a sense,

is for giving benefits that you wouldn't get but for the fact
that you were regulated, and they wouldn't be able to get, for
example, an order from an agency of the government putting the
television broadcast industry out of the CATV business, getting
newspapers out of the CATV business, getting telephone com­
panies out of the CATV business.

It is impossible to say that

the members of the CATV industry that this petitioner repre­
sents have not benefited substantially and do not continue to
benefit substantially from that kind of activity.

And there

is more.
For example

and this might have some relevance

with respect to the telephone companies — the Commission’s
rules with regard to franchising place a limit on the fees that
can be charged by the local municipalities.

That fee has

averaged, according to one study, an average of 8 percent of
the gross receipts.

What the Commission has said is you can't

charge that kind of a fee.

The only thing you can charge

within the guidelines is a fee between 3 percent, if you want
to go over that you have to show that, it is necessary to sus­
tain the cost of regulation.

So that in effect what the Com­

mission has said is the localities can only charge fees which
can reimburse them for regulation.
So here we have, in return for a fee of one-half of
one percent of their gross revenues, we are cutting down the
average fee they pay to municipalities and localities from S
percent a year average to something around 3 or 4 percent,
which is a substantial benefit and was done also at the sug­
gestion of the CATV industry.
Q

Congress, I suppose,

could have passed legis­

lation, specific .legislation requiring exactly the same thing,
that is imposing maximum fees on franchises for —
MR. KORMAN:

Q

That's true.

Could Congress send the beneficiaries of that

legislation a bill, do you suppose for its service to them?
MR. KORMAN:

Well, Congress sends all of us a bill

for the services —
Q

Well, specifically.

Specifically, say we bene­

fited you specifically by seeing to it that no municipality or
county or local government charges more than X percent for its
franchise, now please send in to every Congressman or to the
Congress $.10,000 apiece.

MR. KORMAN:

I must say that, standing up here, 1

33

find it difficult to think of a provision of the. Constitution
that it would violate.

I suppose that,, with some more thought,

1 might, be able to think of a problem that would arise.
that is not the situation here.

But

What Congress is here saying

and -Q

There are all sorts of special legislation in

Congress, in fact there is hardly a law that Congress passes
that doesn't benefit an identifiable group.
MR. KORMAN:

Well, that is true.

Isn’t that correct?
Of course, every

program undertaken pursuant to any act of Congress is intended
to benefit the public generally.
Q

And it is all in the public interest by hypothesis.

MR. KORMAN:

That’s right.

But if you accept that

reasoning, and that was the reasoning of the Court of Appeals,
then Title V means nothing, because there isn’t a single prograin that isn't enacted principally to serve the public.
Q

By hypothesis, by definition.

MR. KORMAN:

That's right.

And as a matter of fact,

although there has been substantial reliance on the Court of
Appeals holding in the New England case, in which the court,
without really citing any specific reference to the scriptures,
found that it was something fundamentally wrong with charging a
fee where the purpose of the. program is to benefit the public.
Q
argument?

Mr. Korman, how far do you carry your line of
Can the Department of Agriculture, if it raises crop

34

support prices bill the farmers for the increased benefit they
get from the added crop support prices?
MR. KORMAN:

Well, I would think that to the extent

that there is a substantial benefit that accrues to the farmer,
and to the extant that there is a cost in administering the
program, that it probably could.

I don't know that Congress

really enacted legislation with that particular executive pro­
gram in mind, although it is quite clear that they enacted
Title V with the Federal Communications Commission precisely in
its mind in recognising the benefits that accrue to those who
are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications
Commission as a result of the regulation which is afforded by
the Commission.
It was quite clear that Representative Yates specific­
ally mentioned the Federal Communications Commission, as did
others, because it is the most obvious one in which the regulated
industries derive substantial benefit as a result of the fran­
chises and permits that they get.
Now, there has been some reference to the regulation
before 1972 and post-1972,

Now, I don't understand that the

petitioner challenges, nor did I understand that the action of
the Court of Appeals really was related only to two years.
Commission’s rule and fee applies in 1970, '71, ’72,

The

s73, ’74,

and it is not really relevant, as we view it, what year par­
ticular Commission activities undertaken.

And as a matter of

35
fact, although we are accused of going outside the record and
improperly bringing in post-1972 activities, the petitioner, at
page 23 of his brief, states that he was the first one to do it.
He says "NCTA recited to the Fifth Circuit the adverse effects
of the Commission’s CATV regulation, prior to, during and sub­
sequent to the promulgation of the annual fee schedule at issue.
Wow, petitioners also challenge the method by which
the Commission calculated the fees.

Now, they don’t challenge

per se the concept of an annual fee, but they seem to be saying
that this annual fee does not really reflect value to the re­
cipient, which is one of the categories which the Commission
must take into account along with the public interest to be
served and the amount of the cost of the public of furnishing
the benefit, that this couldn’t possibly reflect value to the
recipient because in any one year a number of CATV industries
don’t actually come to the Commission for anything specific­
ally.

And it seems to us that this argument ignores the fact

that the value to the recipient, for example, of a FCC rule or
regulation does not simply benefit him in a single year that
it is issued.

License is not limited to the year in which it

is issued, and the other substantial benefits which havearisen, such as the elimination of competition, have value which
go beyond the year that it is issued.
On the other hand, the Commission can’t operate on an
ad hoc basis, putting out an ad for lawyers every time an

36

application for a certificate comes in, or any time the I3CTA
comes running to it for help from competition which it can’t
cope with on its own.

A full-time staff is required to develop

the expertise necessary and to be available to those who come
to it for assistance.
And so that the mere fact that in any given year a
CATV company doesn't come to the Commission for anything does
not necessarily mean that the Commission has failed to take into
account value to the recipient in formulating an annual fee.
Moreover, since the entire industry benefits from that
regulation, and since it is clear, for example — and I don’t
think it would be disputed — that the Commission could calcu•

’

j

late one filing fee which would really be substantial, not $35,
and charge it against one company.

What the Commission has done

here is decide it would be more equitable to spread the. costs a
bit, particularly for smaller CATV companies, by making the
amount contingent on gross revenues which reflects more equit­
ably the real value that is derived from engaging in this
particular business.

And the Court of Appeals unanimously

affirmed the Commission's determination that these fees were
fair and equitable and, as we view it, that is simply almost a
discretionary determination which even before the Court of
Appeals the Commission’s evaluation was entitled to great weight.
And for these reasons, if there are no further ques­
tions, we would ask that the judgment of tha Court of Appeals

37
be affirmed.
Thank you,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Korman.

Mr. Feldstein, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART F. FELDSTEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FELDSTEIN:

First, I wanted to state that in terms

of the Budget Bureau Circular A-25, not only do I feel that the
legislative history,specifically Representative Yates' remarks,
placed the FCC under it, but the FCC has assumed that it is
under it because it named its reliance on Budget Bureau
Circular A-25 in its notice of proposed rulemaking, in Docket
18802, which are the fees under consideration here, in their
report and order, and in the 1972 notice in Docket 19658, which
is the proposal to raise the fees.
Q

So I believe —

But you still have the question of whether or

not the Commission must observe the circular, or whether its
regulations should be judged not under the circular but under
the statute,directly under the statute.
MR. FELDSTEIN:
Q

All right.

I recognize ~

Let’s assume for a moment that there never had

been a circular.
MR. FELDSTEIN:

All right.

Then we can go right then

to the statute and allege that equally under the statute the
same is true, thus under the statute it. talks about — and it

33

lists a whole bunch of things at the top of the statute — it
must be to or for any person, and then in parenthesis it gives
examples of persons, partnership, corporation, group, associa­
tion, but never does it say industry.

And in so interpreting

that, the Bureau of the Budget and other agencies, until this
time, have likewise interpreted it as meaning a specific
service given to a particular individual? thus, even the
statute, when it says, it lists particular benefits at the top
of the statute, and than it says to or for any person, is like­
wise instructing an agency to deal on the fee matter in that
same regard as the Bureau of the Budget has given guidelines
as to how to carry that out.
Now, in talking about what benefits we get, the
government has again talked about all of the 1972 and post1972 regulations

which it has bestowed upon the CATV industry.

I submit that the fees and the appeal that are under consider­
ation here predate the 1972 rules.

I would reserve my oppor­

tunity to argue in another appeal that the 1972 rules likewise
do not benefit the CATV industry in the manner which is alleged
that they do so.
apply

However, these are not the rules which we must

these fees to.
Now, in terms of the statute, where it talks about

taking into consideration value to the recipient a.s one of the
three statutory criteria, there again the Commission has abso­
lutely failed.

It is a pure cost allocation, absolutely a pure

39

cost allocation.

The Commission talked about all kinds of

documents that it had, and this is why we brought our freedom
of information suit to this Court's attention.

The Commission

said it had all kinds of documents and things on value to the
recipient.

One of the three statutory criteria ---■
Q

You have already conceded quite a few benefits

to the industry and to individual members of the industry in
terms of being spared the competition of telephone companies
who could have taken over the entire industry, lock, stock and
barrel, and several other items.
MR. FELDSTEIN:

What I am stating in that regard is

that let us assume that that is a benefit which the entire in­
dustry enjoys; a benefit of a regulation to the entire industry
and not an identifiable CATV system is not sufficient.

Because

what the government can do in that case then is to equate regu­
lation with benefit, and then equate the cost of regulation
with the fees that it can recover, lock, stock and barrel, from
the CATV industry.

And I do not think that Title V authorizes

that kind of an equation.
Q

How much value was it to the CATV to get the

phone company out of the business?
MR. FELDSTEIN:
Q

Well, the value —

In dollars and cents.

MR. FELDSTEIN;

You don’t know, do you?

No, I do not.

There were about, at

the time of that regulation, there were about perhaps 2,000 or

40

a little more CATV systems in operation.

There were approxi-

mately 35 or 40,, maybe a bit more, existing —
Q

And they were increasing every day, weren't they?

If they weren't, why did you intervene in the suit, if they
weren't hurting?

They were hurting, weren't they?

MR. FELDSTEIN:

To an extent they were hurting, but

certainly some people did not —
Q

And this agency got rid of your hurt.

MR. FELDSTEIN;

That's right.

But if we want to

equate that, we can say that — we can put on one side of the
ledger those things which helped us with those things that hurt
us, and I don't think that that kind of equating is what Title
Vi had in mind.
Q
in mind.

I don't think Title V or anything else had that

I think Title V says where you set up something that

is for your benefit, which you use when you want to use it and
is there so that it can be ready full-blown to use when you
want to use it, you pay for it.
MR. FELDSTEIN;

Is that what Title V says?

I disagree.

I do not feel that Title

V enables a federal agency to collect its entire cost of regu­
lation of an industry just because it feels that that regulation
is needed, whether or not the industry desires that particular
piece of regulation, because —
Q
benefits.

Whether or not the industry, on that balance,

41
MR. FELDSTEIN:
Q
either.

That is correct.

That is not really essentially your argument,

You can concede a benefit to the industry, but your

basic point is that the charge can't be based on industry-wide
benefit, isn't it?
MR. FELDSTEIN:
Q

Precisely.

The question is whether this sets up kind of a

Blue Cross system or not, whether or not you can pay every year
even though you don't go to the hospital, and what you pay for
is the existence of the hospital facilities that are available
to you when you do get sick.
MR. FELDSTEIN;

It is my feeling that this title then

only enables an agency to promulgate fees that relate to
services which a particular payer of fees receives in a giveryear.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Thank ypu, Mr, Kerman.

Thank you, Mr. Feldstein.

The case is submitted.
