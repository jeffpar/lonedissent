PROCEEDINGS
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-1713, Secretary of the Navy versus Mark Avrech.
Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever
you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK,
SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court, this case turns on the constitutionality of
Article 13^ of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

That

article punishes, among other things, all disorders and
neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in
the Armed Forces and all conduct of a nature to bring
discredit upon the Armed Forces.
The Article entered our military jurisprudence
when It was enacted by the Continental Congress In 1775 and
has been reenacted repeatedly since then by Congress, the
first reenactment occurring in l806.
Apparently the men who wrote the Constitution
had no doubt of its compatibility with this Article.
It has been in effect as an organic part of our
military law now for just under 200 years and in our history,
millions and tens of millions of service men and women have
served under this Article.

i»

It is as settled a piece of our jurisprudence, I
suppose, as there is.
At stake In the constitutionality of this Article,
of course, are several fundamental values of our society.
Appellee, here, urges the values of fair warning and due
process and free speech.
I will attempt to show that Article 13^ is fully
compatible with those values and does not threaten them.

What

must also be recognized, however, is that the judicial
destruction of Article 13^ would jeopardize two other
important values in our society.

The first, of course, is

the effectiveness of American Armed Forces upon which the
safety of the nation rests.
The second, however, Is a value which I think is
not sufficiently recognized and that is the importance of
Article 13^ in confining the role of the military in our
national political processes and decisions.
Should speech of the sort involved in this case
and in Captain Levy’s case, which we argue next, come to be
permitted in the military, there would be real danger that
our military would become so unreliable as to frustrate
civilian policy and to be unable to carry out civilian
policy.

But worse than that, it seems to me that there might

be a danger of a politicized military establishment with all
the dangers that prospect poses for the principle of

civilian control of the military.
This is speech in these cases in opposition to
warnings and if it is permissible for a Pfc. and a captain
to make these publications or attempt these publications
and make these speeches under these circumstances, then I
do not see why it would not be permissible, equally, for
general officers and admirals to address their troops about
their political views and about their disagreements with the
President of the United States and about their disagreements
with warnings.
We are not dealing with small issues in this
case.

The Appellee, Mark Avrech, brought this action in the

District Court for the District of Columbia to expunge his
courtmartial conviction which was under Article 80, which
punishes attempts and the attempt was to violate Article 134
of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
The District Court dismissed his suit, but the
Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Article 134 was
unconstitut1ona1ly vague.
The conduct underlying the courtmartial conviction
occurred at the Marble Mountain Air Facility in Danang in
Vietnam, where Pfc. Avrech was on active duty with the
Marine Corps in a combat zone.
While on night duty, in the group supply offices
at his base, Avrech typed up a stencil of a statement

6
entitled, "The Truth," and marked "Volume I, Mo. 1."
This statement is set out in full at pages 4 and
5 of the Government's brief and he intended to circulate it,
he said, only to eight or ten of his friends in the Marine
Corps.
The statement is a denunciation of the United
States' military role in Vietnam and it contains such
sentences as these:

"Why should we go out and fight their —"

the South Vietnamese — "Why should we go out and fight their
battles while they sit home and complain about communist
aggession?

What are we, cannon fodder or human beings?"
Going on, "The United States has no business over

here.

Are your opinions worth risking a court-martial?

We

must strive for peace and if not peace, then a complete U.S.
withdrawal.

We have been sitting ducks for too long."
The statement is more extensive than that and it

is, in tone and,in substance, a denunciation, as I say, of
United States' warrings.
I think that there is no doubt that had Pfc. Avrech
succeeded in publishing that statement, the document would
tend to create disaffection among the troops and it would
certainly create lowered morale among troops in a combat
zone.
Q

Well, I suppose it might be reasonably said

that it would stimulate some debate on the subject and you'd

7
have one group of soldiers one way — or Marines -— on one
side and another group on another side.
MR. BORK:

It certainly would stimulate debate.

I think that is certainly fair, Mr. Chief Justice.

In

addition to that, apparently, although he was not charged
with It, the record in the case, the summary of the record
in the case — the original record of the transcript has
been destroyed — indicates that Pfc. Avrech constantly
stimulated debate among his fellows about the wrongness of
United States' ivarrings.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

at 1:00 o’clock.
[Whereupon, a recess was taken for luncheon
from 12:00 o’clock noon to 1:02 o’clock p.m.]

8
AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solicitor General,

you may proceed.
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We were discussing at the lunch break the facts
of this case.
Having typed up, on a stencil, his denunciation
of the warnings of the United States for circulation to the
troops — and it was entitled, "Volume I, Part I" because
Pfc. Avrech testified that he had intended to publish other
such statements as his thinking developed along these lines —
having typed up this first statement, Avrech attempted to
gain access to the supply office mimeograph machine in order
to run the statement off and in the process, he showed it to
a corporal who controlled the machine.
The corporal took the statement, gave it to a
superior and, as a result, Avrech was tried before a special
court-martial on charges of violating Articles 134 and. 80.
The court-martial acquitted him on the Article 134
charge but convicted him under Article 80 which, as I say,
punishes attempts to commit offenses and here the specification
of the charge under Article 80 charged an attempt to commit an
offense under Article 134, namely, an attempt to publish to
members of the Armed Forces \fith design to promote disloyalty

9
and. disaffection among the troops, a statement disloyal to the
United States.
This charge required a finding of specific
intent and was modeled on the standard form contained in the
Manual for Courts-Martial.
Upon conviction, Averich was reduced in rank
from Private first class to Private, sentenced to forfeiture
of three months’ pay and

sentenced to one month’s hard

labor and confinement.
The commanding officer suspended the confinement.
In all other respects, through the regular review process,
the conviction and the sentence were affirmed, so that he
received a rather mild sentence that did not put any bad
conduct discharge on his record and did not confine him in
any way.
The

Appellee challenges this conviction under

one Fifth Amendment doctrine, void for

vagueness and two

aspects of the First Amendment doctrine, overbreadth and the
claim that the statement he attempted to issue was protected
speech.
I think none of these contentions can withstand
examination and. I would like to examin e the vagueness point
first.
Now, I think it is essential to realise that
there is no doubt that a parallel statute applied to the

10

civilian population would be unconstitutionally vague.

Nobody

would know, in a free and permissive society, what was
conceivably meant by something like disorders and neglect to
the prejudice of social order.
The difference, of course, is that a civilian
society is basically a free society.

It is not — and,

furthermore, it has no single mission, unlike the military.
The military society is an ordered society.

It has a mission.

It has a structure and for that reason, one knows what tends
to detract from that mission, what tends to break down
discipline and good order.
Now, counsel for the Appellee argue this case
as if it did involve a statute applied to the civilian
population and they refuse, I think, to face the only issue,
the real issue, which is the military context in which this
Article exists,

indeed, of which this Article has been an

organic part for 200 years and that is what makes all the
difference in this case.
That context and the limiting constructions
given by the United States Court of Military Appeals give
Article 131* the definiteness it requires.
Q

What did the Court of Appeals say about that

argument of yours?
MR. BORK:

The Court of Appeals thought that the

military context did give it sufficient definiteness.

11

Hr. Justice Douglas, but I think I can demonstrate that it
does.
One, it seems to me, extremely telling point in
this case is that Counsel for the Appellee argued this case
by a series of hypotheticals.

Although this

Article has

been in use for 200 years, they do not cite a single case
of injustice done by the military under this Article.

They

do not cite a single case in which convicted servicemen
could not — in which a convicted serviceman could have
entertained any doubt that what he did was prejudicial to
good order and

discipline and that what he did was wrong

and illegal so far as

a military society was concerned.

Whatever superficial plausibility Appellee's
challenge has is gained only by ignoring the meaning given
by military function and context by ignoring the actual
operation of the military system and arguing, instead, from
wholly imaginary cases.
The Court of Military Appeals repeatedly said of
this Article that it reaches only misconduct and disorders
which are directly and probably prejudicial to good order
and discipline so that the construction placed upon it by
the Court of Military Appeals and followed by the courtsmartial is that the tendency to injure good order and
discipline must be direct and it must be obvious for a
reasonable man.

12

In addition to that, of course, the Manual for
Courts Martlal3 which is in the Appendix to our brief,
discusses, at page 73 this Article and the specific charge of
disloyal speech.
Now, knowledge of what conduct directly —■
Q

Listen, the average enlisted man is not

familiar with the Manual at all, is he?
MR. BORK:
quite true.

Mr. Justice Marshall, I think that is

The average enlisted man is not, although more

enlisted men than one might think, are, particularly enlisted
men who recognize themselves as coming into brush, possibly,
with disciplinary authority.
Q

Well, I wonder how many Manuals of Court

Martial they had in Vietnam altogether?
MR. BORK:

I do not know that.

I do know, though,

Mr. Justice Marshall, that the Articles of War — the
Articles appeared —
Q

I am just wondering if you need that.

MR, BORK:
Q

Pardon me?

I am just wondering If you need that.

MR. BORK:

Well, I don't need it, but I think

I'd like to use it if I may.

The Articles are explained to

the troops as part of their basic training.
Q

I see.

MR. BORK:

The Manual is available and I would

13
suggest that the Manual Is really as available to an
enlisted man in the Marine Corps as is a criminal code of
Illinois, say, to the man who gets into a brush -Q

The whole problem is if the Manual is

explained to him.
MR. BORK:
Q

The

Manual was explained —

He may not have the Manual itself.

MR. BORK:

That is correct.

But aside from history and tradition, it seems
to me that the most important and obvious fact

about this

case is that the military does comprise a specialized
community.

It has .a well-understood and a specialised

function which is something a civilian community does not
have and the need for order and discipline in that
specialised community is known throughout our culture

and

it is obvious to everyone.
[Q

How many Manuals did you ever read?]

MR. BORK:

It is also obvious what kinds of

behavior tbnd to break that down.
Now, at this point, I would like to say that the
military use of this kind of penal statute is by no means
unique in our law.

This is not confined to military law by

any means.
Courts frequently apply standards of sort when
they are given content by an understood function and although,

14
on the face of the words., they may seem vague, itfhen they are
In context, they are not vague and I think this is true in a
variety of areas and I’d like to mention a few:
In the first place, and most obviously, the
Sherman Act’s vague criminal prescriptions against things
like combinations in restraint of trade were upheld In Nash
against the United States

largely because — Justice Holmes

said because of the antecedent common lav: among other things.
The antecedent common law really 'was not a great deal of help
but in the — he explained further in International Harvester
against Kentucky that criminal law is not unconstitutional
merely because it throws upon men the risk of rightly
estimating a matter of degree and here, the matter of degree
is what is an undue restraint of trade.
Because between the obviously illegal and the
\

plainly lawful,

there is a gradual approach and that the

complexity of life makgs it impossible to draw a line in
advance without an artificial simplification that would be
un3 ust, the conditions are as permanent as anything human
and the conditions there, of course, were the conditions of
trade and economics.
Hei”©, the conditions are omission of understood
function of the military and the great body of precedents on
the civil side, coupled xvith familiar practice, make it
comparatively easy for common sense to keep to what is safe.

That passage, I think, with any superficial
alterations, could have been written in defense of Article
13^ and Article 13^, if I may say so, is, fi anything,
clearer than the Sherman Act was before it received
construction.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, you said a little

earlier that your brothers have not pointed to any case
where — I don’t know just how you put it — I think where
there has been any great injustice or, I think you said,
where there wasn't fair notice, more or less.

But, I, in

looking at these examples in the Appendix of the Appellee's
brief see — some of them seem to me to be arguably, while
they are all, of course, conduct falling below what we like
to think of as ideal, some of them really have nothing to
do with the good order and discipline of the Armed Forces,
do they?

I mean, obtaining telephone services from a

telephone company with intent to defraud, for example, or
negligent failure to maintain sufficient bank funds?
MR. BORK:
Q

May I speak to those?

Or even mistreatment of the members of your

family, for instance, or refusing to testify at a
coroner's inquest?
MR. BORK:

I think that list in the Appendix,

Mr. Justice Stewart, requires use with a great deal of
caution.

If you will look at those cases, and I am sorry to

16
say that I seem to have mislaid my analysis of them.

A

number of them, for example, are cases in which it was held
that the behavior cited there was not a violation of
Article 134.

Those are merely cases where somebody was

charged.
Q

Well —

MR. BORK:

And, in addition to that, for example,

the —
Q

You can argue that both ways, Mr. Solicitor

General, as to the validity of this.
MR. BORK:

Well, I think not, Mr. Justice Stewart

because if one looked at civilian jurisprudence and said,
look at the number of cases in which people have been
charged with murder and look how many of them were acquitted,
one would not say —
Q

No, but we know what murder is.

It does

involve killing another human being.
MR, BORK:

Well, one of my examples here is

manslaughter, which is, I suppose, a negligent killing
under the circumstances.
Q

Umn hmn.

MR. BORK:

Is a quite vague criminal proscription

But I wish to say about this, for example, not only are some
of these examples in the Appendix held not to be violations
of Article 134, in addition, some of them are not described

17
fully enough:
Q

For example, cheating at bingo.
Yes.

MR. BORK:

That was the gentleman who was calling

out wrong numbers to rig the game with servicemen and then
splitting the proceeds.
Q

Well, I assumed it was something like that.

That is the reason I didn't ask you about that one.
MR. BORK:

Jumping off a ship, which sounds a

little bit carefree, as a matter of fact, was a man who had
made a large wager that he could do a backflip off an air­
craft carrier in motion and cause the Navy to send a
destroyer out to rescue him.
Q

Umn hrnn.

MR. BORK:

These are cases, "when you look at the

full case, I don't think there is any case here in which it
is is not —■ in which a man was convicted — in which it is
not clear that he should have known that the conduct was to
the prejudice of good order and discipline or that it would
serve as discrediting in the eyes of the civilian population
with which he was dealing.
Q

Of course, any deviation from an ideal

conduct by a man in uniform tends to bring discredit upon
the uniform that he wears and the military organization to
which he belongs.

Isn't that correct?

MR. BORK:

That certainly is correct, your Honor,

18
but any deviation from ideal conduct is not charged under
this Article.

It has to be a serious,, direct, obvious

impact upon — prejudicial impact upon good order and
discipline.

Anyone who has lived among troops knows that If

deviations from ideal conduct were prosecuted, that we would
have nothing but courts-martial.
That is not the way this

Article is used and I

think some attention has to be given to the way this Article
is used, and the way it is controlled by the Court of
Military Appeals and, indeed, by the reviewing legal staffs
that go over every one of these convictions.
But I have mentioned the vagueness of the
Sherman Act, which was saved by its context and by our
knowledge of economics — the criminal offense of manslaughter,
we rely upon common understanding of man as to what Is
dangerously negligent behavior in a vast multiplicity of
examples that would be beyond the skill of a legislative
draftsman to reach.
Now, if I turn to examples involving speech, I
might mention that courts often permit indefinite wording
If the context gives the i^ording meaning and a parallel
example, it seems to me, is Grayned against City of Rockford
and this Court there upheld a conviction under an anti-noise
ordinance that published, "The wilful making of noise or
diversion that disturbs or tends to disturb the peace or

19
good order of schools," interpreting with the reply the
actual or imminent interference with peace or good order
and relying upon the school context as giving meaning, the
disturbance is impact upon the normal activities of the
school.
The context there gave fair notice and I think
the context in the military gives fair notice to a statute —
to an Article which is written very much like the anti-noise
ordinance was in Grayned against the City of Rockford.
I might also suggest that courts regularly
apply penalties for contempt of court.

That would seem to

be a fairly vague standard and it does inhibit speech quite
directly but it is made sufficiently definite by the common
understanding of the function of a court room, the function
of the legal system and what that function requires in the
way of good order and discipline by the part of attorneys
who take place — argue in the court room.
And, finally, I would like to cite as very
close to this case the clear and present danger test.
is a test that is read into criminal statutes

That

on speech

about overthrow of the government or violence, advocacy of
violence and, hence, it becomes a warning — the clear and
present danger test is a warning that must be intelligible
to those the law threatens and in Dennis against the United
States, this Court explained those words as follows:

20
It said that Chief Judge Learned Hand, writing
for the majority below, interpreted the phrase as follows:
"In each case, courts must ask whether the
gravity of the evil, discounted by its improbability,
justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to
avoid the danger."
Then this Court said, "We adopt this statement
of the rule.

As articulated by Chief Judge Hand, it is as

succinct and inclusive as any other we might devise at this
time.

It takes into consideration those factors which we

deem relevant and relates their significances.

More, we

cannot expect from words."
It seems to me that Article 13*t is certainly no
vaguer than that standard.

I agree that "More, we cannot

expect from words" in the context in which 13^ is applied.
I think It does an equally good job of relating
the factors and their significance,
And there is one other parallel I'd like to draw,
that between Article 131* and the Hatch Act.

This Court upheld

the Hatch Act last term in Civil Service Commission against
National Association of Letter Carriers and at this point, I
am discussing not so much vagueness as overbreadth and the
legitimate interest of Government.
This Court held, in a civilian context, that the
legitimate interest of Government, in good government and in a

21

fair political process, was enough to uphold the Hatch Act’s
restrictions upon government employees’ political activities
against

First Amendment claims.
So, here, I think, the legitimate interest in an

effective military and in a military that does1'... dictate
civilian policy, either by becoming ineffective so that it
cannot carry out policy or by becoming so politicized that
it refuses to carry out the policy made by civilians,"
justifies Article ±3!Vs very limited inhibitions on speech,
just as the Hatch Act was justified for parallel reasons.
In this case, I think it is obvious that the
publication Avrech would have published would have tended to
spread disaffection among troops in the combat zone and that
cannot be tolerated by any effective military organization.
There may have been armies that tolerated that
kind of behavior, but they were armies on the verge of
dissolution and not armies that win wars and, aside from the
tendency to disaffect others, statements such as these, even
if they convince no one of a deleterious effect upon morale,
because they signal to others that at least
unit is not to be relied upon, he is already

one man in the
disaffected,

and he may be unreliable in dangerous or difficult situations,
which I think is surely a factor the military are entitled
to take Into account.
It is apparent, I think, that the Article, as

22

applied in this case, was not unduly vague, nor does it
violate Avrech’s First Amendment rights, since those rights
must vary according to the time, place, and circumstances and
speech of this sort in a combat zone can hardly be
protected.
It might be different In other military
circumstances.

It might be different if he were in the

States in civilian uniform talking to men off base.
In a combat zone, it cannot be protected speech,
I would not think.
Q

Doesn't the Court of Military Appeals apply

the standards that this Court has applied in civil
procedures, as respects vagueness?
MR. BORK:

I think it does, Mr. Justice Douglas,

but it recognizes that each of these standards has a
slightly different application depending upon the context
and the circumstances in which it must be applied.
Q

Well, that would be true in the civilian

branch of the law, too.
MR. BORK:
Q

That is true.

That is true.

And the Court of Military Appeals has

explicitly upheld the validity of Article 134, has it not?
MR. BORK:
Q

They have, indeed.

How recently?

MR. BORK:

I think it has upheld it, Mr. Justice

23
Stewart3 within the last year or two.

I can get the

citation for you, It’s —
Q

It’s quite recently, in any event.

MR. BORK:
Q

Is that the France case?

MR. BORK:
Q

Quite recently.

I believe it was the France case.

Well, I have it here.

I can give it to

Justice Stewart.
MR. BORK:
Q

All right.

I take it that the major argument of yours is

that because the Article has been construed so often and it
has been held to include so many things that, at the very
least, it should not be invalidated on its face.
MR. BORK:

Well, I think that is an argument that

I make and I think it should not be invalidated on its face,
again, for two other reasons, not just because it has been
construed so often.
One is because this article has its primary
impingement upon conduct which is not speech.
Q

And you say it should be declared invalid on

its face in connection with any crime; it should be tested
for vagueness as applied?
MR. BORK:

That is correct.

I think, as I say,

for one thing, in the military so many aspects of human
conduct are necessarily regulated that are left completely

24
unregulated in civilian life, it would be, I think.
Impossible

to write a specific and definite code that

covered all of the things that might prejudice good order
and discipline, from speech to nonspeech.
That being the case, to strike down a statute
like this on its face, I think makes no particular sense
You'd have to strike down whatever replaced it, on its face
because one would always be left with the need of some form
of general article.
Q

Oh, wherever it has been construed and

applied and the conviction upheld, to that extent, meaning
has been given to the Article.
MR. BORK:
Q

That is correct.

And any identical crime, any person committing

an identical crime, would know in advance.
MR. BORK:

That is correct, Mr. Justice White, but

I would like to say that there are, in addition, areas that
have not yet been applied in which it is still valid.
Q

I understand.

MR. BORK:
Q
general article?

Like this one.

Why would always be left with a need of some
I understand, from reading these briefs,

which was over the weekend — I don't have it in mind, I
think it was a former highranking

military officer of the

legal department who has written an article or given us a

25
a speech saying to the effect that we don’t, the military
doesn’t need these.
MR. DORK:
Stewart.

He did give that speech, Mr. Justice

I understand that —- I am informed that in the

heated debate which followed his publication of that article,
he recanted slightly.
Q

Was he prosecuted under 134?

[Laughter.]
MR. BORK:

That had not occurred to me, but it

could be considered.
Q

But in all seriousness, why do you say the

military needs this?
MR. BORK:
Q

They need it, Mr. Justice —-

I mean, we don’t need it in civilian

society.
MR. BORK:
Q

That is because civilian society --

Because you say it is diverse and

permissive and free and the military is an authoritarian
organization with a specific mission.

I understand this,

but why does that lead to the conclusion that you need a
catchall thing like this?
What is

"wrong with spelling out what you don't

want soldiers and sailors to do?
MR. BORK:

Let me say this, Mr. Justice Stewart,

addressing merely the speech area, I think that the numbers

2.6
of ways in which servicemen can find to prejudice discipline
in nonspeech ways are limitless, but let’s address just the
speech area, which is only a minor part of this article.
One ranges from the serviceman speaking or
discussing with two friends off base over a drink in somebody’s
llvingroom out of uniform, the aims of the war in a discursive
fashion, all the way through the wide variety of circumstances
to the serviceman in a combat zone, perhaps in action,
denouncing what they are doing and urging others to pull out
of the action.
There are so many gradations and variations and
alterations and circumstances between there, that I cannot
imagine that one could draft specific articles that did not
look like the code, the Internal Revenue Code and even then
we know that the Internal Revenue Code has its areas of
vagueness.
Q

Well, Mr. Solicitor, on this one way, the

urging them not to fight, wouldn’t he be v3.olating conduct in
the presence of the enemy, which is a specific one?
MR. BORK:

It certainly would, Mr. Justice

Marshall,
Q

And on all of those you have mentioned,

specific ones that could be covered by
MR. BORK:

a specific article,

Well, I think there are too many.

think there are too many variations in circumstances.

I

27

Q

In this particular case, if the commanding

officer said, "Private, do not distribute that," and he
distributed it, he would be charged with what?
MR. BORK:
Q

Disobeying an order.

MR. BORK:
Q

Distribution —

Article 90, that is quite true.

So he wouldn’t have to go to

this

indefinite one here.
MR. BORK:

No, that is quite correct, but this

man —
Q

In the first place, he could have said,

"Don't use that mimeograph machine," that would be the
end of it.
MR. BORK:

Well, I hardly think it is practical,

Mr. Justice Marshall, for the commanding officer to go
about catching people, investigating people, to see what
they were likely to publish and then issue an order not to
do so.
Q

I understood that was given to the

commanding officer, this piece of paper.
MR. BORK:
Q

That is correct.

At that stage, the commanding officer could

have said one of two things:

"This can be mimeographed.

can't be distributed," or he could have ordered him not to
distribute it and that would have been the end of it.

It

28
MR. BORK:
Q

That is correct.

But instead of that, you bring him in on

this charge.
MR. BORK:
Q

But it would have to be —

And that is why it seems to me the availability

of this is, if you don't want to go to the other one, well,
we always got this one.
MR. BORK:
Q

Well —

Doesn't it look to you like it is the one

where if I can't get you on anything else, I got you on
this one?
MR. BORK:

Wo, sir, Mr. Justice Marshall, it

does not look to me like that.

It looks to me like a

necessarily general statement because it is impossible, in
any length short of a tax

code, which would not give notice

to anybody in the enlisted level, to convey all of the
instances in which the military may object to behavior as
being obviously prejudicial to good order and discipline.
The argument you make, that the commander could
have issued a direct order, is quite true, but that would be
an argument that says, you may never punish for any attempt
to do anything because when the attempt is discovered, the
commanding officer may always issue an order not to do it and
then if it is done, you may be punished for direct
disobedience of a lawful order of a superior commissioned

29
officer but so long as the attempt article, Article 80, has
any validity — and I don't think it is questioned for this
it is valid, then an attempt may be punished although the
commander could have overlooked it and just issued an order
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bowman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DORIAN BOWMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BOWMAN:

Hr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The central question which this Court must face
Is the validity of Article 134.

In the course of my

argument I will indicate why it is necessary to reach that
issue without regard to the specific conduct Involved.
Now, at the very outset, the government
argues that, balanced against the important — admittedly
important —
Q

Mr. Bowman, you said we should reach it.

How do you read what Justice Clark did in the Court of
Appeals?

Did he invalidate it on its face?
MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, he invalidated the first two

clauses, your Honor.
Q

I mean facially.

MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, I'm sorry, facially.

The government argues that balanced against the
admittedly valid, admittedly important values of fair

30

warning and due process, one should balance the value of
preventing politicizing the Armed Forces.
I want to make clear that, whether or not the
Court upholds Article 13^ has absolutely nothing to do with
civilian control of the Army.

If there is particular conduct

that the Army Is concerned about, then it should punish it
under clearly existing and well-defined statutes or pass a
new statute.
You cannot uphold an otherwise invalid statute
just because you don’t like certain behavior and it is —
Q

Mr. Bowman, I wonder if I may interrupt you

before you get fully launched on your argument on the merits.
It struck me there might be a question here
about jurisdiction,
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

This isn’t a habeas corpus case.

MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Well, I —

No, it’s not.

And it wasn't a case for back pay in the

Court of Claims.
MR. BOV/MAN:

No, if you are raising the

collateral attack point, your Honor, this Court, as long
ago as

Smith y. Whitney, Dynes v. IToover, Swaim v. United

States, Ruckel v. United States, were all collateral attack
cases.

They were not habeas cases.

Smith v. Whitney,

Dynes v. Hoover were brought in the District Court, District

31
of Columbia, whose jurisdiction was the same as the District
Court here when it was brought.
Furthermore, in this Court’s case of Gusslck v.
Schneider, in footnote 3S although it was a habeas case,
Gusslck, the Court explicitly recognized in footnote 3 that
collateral attacks could be brought by methods

other than

habeas and Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in Burns v. Wilson,
concurring, also recognized the fact that collateral attacks
could be brought.
I might say that the Government, you know, this
issue has not been briefed here.
Q

I know it hasn't.

MR. BOWMAN:

It wasn’t raised by the Government

but I think what I have just said is sufficient answer to —
this Court has held that.
Q

Well, collateral attack, but, I mean, that

could be —
MR. BOWMAN:

I’m sorry, it was collateral attack

to set aside a court-martial conviction on the same grounds,
Dynes v. Hoover, of course.
Q

This was an action for a declaratory

judgment, wasn't it?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Here?

This case.

MR. BOV/MAN:

Yes.

32
Q

Piled in the District Court, District of

Columbia.
MR. BOWMAN:

Filed in the District Court, District

of Columbia under — well, we had jurisdiction under 11-521.
Also we — which did not, I might add, at that time require
$10,000 jurisdictional amount.

We also filed under 1331 and

we alleged $10,000 controversy and that was never controverted
and tiie question was never raised by the government.
Now, the suggestion that —• to this Court that in
deciding —Q

Mr. Bowman —

MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Yes, sir?

Those cases you cite, certainly, Dynes

against Hoover and of that vintage, there was no declaratory
judgment statute made.
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

No.

They didn't uphold the bringing of it by

declaratory judgment, did they?
MR. BOWMAN:

No, but they upheld the method of

attempting to declare the court-martial conviction invalid.
I admit that the form -- I mean, we want —
Q

What form is this?

MR. BOWMAN:

Smith v, Whitney was a writ of

prohibition, I believe, brought in the District Court.
Dynes v. Hoover was a — I'm trying to remember — was a

33
collateral — I frankly don’t —
Q

Generally, as we both know, the administration

of justicd is quite unrelated to the civilian courts and
generally the only place where there is an intersection of
their jurisdiction is on a writ of habeas corpus attacking
the very jurisdiction of the military court.

Isn’t that

correct?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

In —

Those are cases like the murdering wives

cases and those.
MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, but in Burns v. Wilson, it was

not attacking the jurisdiction of the court, your Honor, nor
was it in Gussick v. Schneider and this Court, in those
cases, did not state and certainly did not hold that habeas
corpus was the only method by which one could bring a
collateral attack against a court-martial

jurisdiction.

Our case goes to the very, you know, goes, quite
obviously, to the statute itself under which the court was
operating, that section.
Q

Why didn’t your client bring habeas?

MR. BOWMAN:

Excuse me?

Because our client, he

was sentenced to three months in prison, which sentence
was suspended, so he couldn’t, possibly, have brought a
habeas and, that is, your Honor —
Q

There is no custody here.

34
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Excuse me?

There is no custody here.

MR. BOWMAN:

No, there was no custody and to

limit it to habeas, obviously, would, in effect, give the
military control over who could bring suit and who could not
because, as In this case, they could simply suspend the
portion of his sentence, the person wouldn't be in custody
and you couldn't bring suit.
Now, the suggestion — again, I might say that if
the

Court should reach this, I don't think it should reach

it without full briefing because the issue was never raised
and hasn't, frankly, been briefed here.
Now, the suggestion to the Court that in
deciding — the Government's suggestion to the Court that in
deciding the question of the validity of 134, this Court
should not be mislead into thinking that there is a conflict
between the values which have led this Court to invalidate
vague statutes and the values which are suggested by the
Government.
Now, turning to Article 134, 1 think the
significant thing about Article 134 is that it

has always

been recognised to be broad and indefinite and we have set
forth in our brief all the historical evidence regarding the
writers, British writers going back to the l800’s and
American military writers who have recognized that this

35
article was indefinite and we have also presented testimony
of Congressional hearings in 1912, 1919, 19^9 in which it
was also recognized that the Article was — that the language
of the Article xvas indefinite and the Government does not —
Q

let me interrupt you once more.

I’ll try

not to do it again.
If your client is out, why is there a case or
controversy under the declaratory judgment?
MR. BOV/MAN:

Because, your Honor, he had a — he

received a Bad Conduct Discharge, your Honor.
Q

And is that reviewable

MR. BOWMAN:

by the Court?

He received a Bad Conduct Discharge

conviction, your Honor, he was convicted, I believe, for
theft of a camera, your Honor.
took both of them into account.

So, talcing — the military
It is in the record.

Specifically took both into account in giving him the type
of discharge which was given to him.
Q

And is a declaratory judgment a normal way

of reviewing a Bad Conduct Discharge?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Well —

Not without administrative remedies, any way.

MR. BOWMAN:

I'll be perfectly honest, your

Honor, I really don’t know the answer to that.
Q

Well, If you win, would that open up every

36
Bad Dis-Conduet Charge to come in?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

No, I don’t think so.

If we win —

Why not ?

MR. BOWMAN:

If we win on this, perfectly

frankly, I will go back and attempt to get his type of
discharge changed -—
Q

I’m not talking

about you.

about the few other Bad Conduct Dischages.

I'm talking
There are a fexv

others.
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Well, I would think that --

Were they all other causes of action for a

declaratory judgment?
MR. BOWMAN:

Well, I am not prepared at this

time to talk about the retroactivity of this decision, your
Honor.

It would only -Q

How about jurisdiction, your jurisdictional

question?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Well — well, I think ~

Can anybody who has had a Bad Conduct

Discharge walk into a federal district court and ask for a
de claratory j udgment ?
MR. BOWMAN:

I think, in terms of jurisdiction,

that I believe that the Court would then have to consider
the type of situation which was, I think ,
situation as to whether or not

in the 0’Callahan

the factors which were

37
involved there should be applied to allow —
Q

If you deprivedhis Constitutional right, you

would say he could?
MR. BOWMAN:

Well, our person was being deprived

of Constitutional right here, too.
Q

I say, if that — is it your test?

MR. BOWMAN:

I think so.

Again, I -- frankly,

since it has not been briefed, I am really not very familiar
with the cases that this Court decided following O'Callan v,
Parker as to whether or not who could come in.
I think that if this was the only -— \irell, I'm
really not prepared to discuss that, your Honor, because,
frankly, I'm not really familiar with —
Q

Well, you might not be prepared, but don't

we have to find out whether or not we have jurisdiction?
MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, and I think if your Honors

decide that the Issue Is one that merits full consideration,
I think the party should be given a chance to brief it
because it hasn't been —
Q

The question is always open.

MR. BOWMAN:

Your Honor, I realise the issue and

I am only urging that —
Q

And the two of you can't give us jurisdiction

by agreement.
MR. BOWMAN:

I fully agree with that but if this

33
Court decides that the question of jurisdiction is really an
important one in all collateral attack, I really think that
it should be briefed fully and shouldn't be done just on
this record and, frankly, on cases that I am not absolutely
and completely familiar with and if it hasn’t been raised
below, ever.
Q

Right.

MR. BOWMAN:

Now, the Government really doesn’t

seriously challenge the historical evidence and really makes
no effort to defend the language itself.

And Grayned v.

City of Rockford tells us that statutes such as this are
vague arid should be judged on their face.

They are vague

because they offend several important values.
One, lack of fair warning.
Two, lack of guidance to the enforcing authorities
leaving them with uncontrolled discretion.
And, thirdly, where statutes affect the First
Amendment rights, it must be narrowly drawn to save it from
the vice of overbreadth.
And a statute which violates any one of these
values should be struck down.
Now, the Government’s principal argument
regarding approach, I think, is that the Court shouldn’t
reach the statute on its face and the Government’s position
apparently is that if Avrech was aware that his conduct was

39
prohibited by Article 134, that ends the question of
vagueness.

Although we don’t concede that Avrech, in

effect, had fair warning.
The fallacy of the Government’s argument is that
it completely ignores the second value which is a lack of
standards to guide the enforcing authorities.
This Court has consistently held that you
cannot leave it to the enforcing authorities to determine
what conduct falls within a statute.
Q

I think, Mr. Bowman, that as I understood the

Solicitor General, and I am quite certain that I did, he
fr’eely acknov/ledged and conceded that if this were a section
of a criminal code, federal or state, that it would be
unconstitutionally vague.

And in that way he rather

finessed a part of your argument. I think.
MR. BOWMAN:

Well, I realize that.

I didn’t —

the way I understood it, I didn’t understand that he had
conceded

that you would approach it on its face and that

was —
Q

I thought I heard him say that.

MR. BOWMAN:

If, indeed, that was it, I gladly

accept the concession that the Court should have reached
this statute on its face.
The Government argues, then, that if the Court
reaches the statute on its face, that the statute is not

40
invalid and it sets forth several reasons within its brief
and here on oral argument as to why the statute is not
invalid.
They argue in the brief, at least, that there is
a custom and practice in the military as to what offenses
are covered.
Now, I acknowledge, of course, that in Dynes v.
Hoover, this Court, although recognizing the apparent
indeterminateness of the Article, held that there was a
custom and practice in the military as to what offenses are
covered.
Well, I suggest to you that what this Court
did -— that the times have changed since Dynes v. Hoover.
Dynes v. Hoover was only concerned or involved itself idLth
a situation where there was a small professional army.
New, however, the armies have obviously changed
and were, up to the time of this conviction, two to three
million men and you cannot say that practical men in the
Navy or Army know what is covered by this Article.
Secondly, the history of the Article has
certainly changed since a hundred years ago.

The Article,

we have shown in our brief, really covers a grouping number
of offenses.
Q

Do you suggest that he was not aware that

this might be a court-martial offense?

MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, your HOnor, I will make that

point that he was not, in fact, aware.
Q

Well, how do you square that with the

precautions he took and the things that he said?
MR. BOWMAN:

Well, the only thing that he said,

your Honor, is that, "Are your opinions worth risking a
court-martial?'' and that, we urge, is really different from
knowing that whether or not your conduct is covered by this
statute.

All he said — I mean, I think —
Q

Does he have to focus on which particular*

statute?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

No, but he has to —

Some statute?

MR. BOWMAN:

Well, I think he has to know some­

thing more than that his views are going to be displeasing
to the military and even if he did have fair warning, of
which, again, as I say, that doesn't meet the question of
the vagueness of the statute because he is still left with
the second vice, namely, the failure to provide guidance
for enforcing authorities.
Moreover, the Government, if you are looking at
the term "disloyalty" in the Manual, the Government in its
brief freely concedes that the term "disloyalty" in the
Manual is vague and it is indefinite and you cannot tell in
advance, the Government states in its brief, as to what type

42

of conduct falls within the Manual’s definition of disloyalty
Now, the Government doesn't say in its brief
what this custom and practice is or where it may be found.
And it suggests that, perhaps, it can be found in the Manual
but it also admits that the Manual is only an illustrative
guide and the Court of Military Appeals has frequently held
that the listing of an offense in the Manual doesn't mean it
it covered by Article 134 and it is also held that the
failure to list an offense in the Manual doesn’t mean that
it is not covered.
So the Manual
is custom and practice.

can’t possibly tell you what
Indeed, Mr. Justice Clark below

said that the Manual is only a mini-digest of the roving
character of Article 134.
Now, the Government suggests —
Q

Noif, let’s assume that the Court of Military

Appeals had upheld a conviction for conduct A and said that
that conduct is within 134 and let’s assume that it has done
so 100 times.
Now, why would that section, that Article

be

vague as to someone who now is about to engage in the same
conduct?
MR. BOWMAN:

Well, first I xvould argue, of course

that fair warning — this Court has always held that fair
warning must be given by the language of the statute itself

^3

and not
Q
It is fairly rare to be held otherwise in
the validity of a
the upholding of/a statute that talked In terns of the
detestable and abominable crime against nature and held that
a judicial construction of it gave fair warning.
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Yes, that is true and -—

We certainly took that approach last year

in Letter Carriers.
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Well, I would —

It wasn’t a criminal statute.

MR. BOV/MAN:

No, it wasn’t a criminal statute.

It was a regulatory statute and I would concede, I think —
as I say, after the argument that fair warning —•
Q

But there are cases that say once a statute

has been construed, it is just as though the statute now
read that way.
MR. BOWMAN:

I would say that if there was a

specific — if the Court of Military Appeals had specifically
said that the type of conduct he has engaged in is covered
by Article 13^, then I would have to concede that, yes,
indeed, he did —
Q

And if that Is so, you would also be

conceding that the enforcing authorities wouldn’t have any
roving authority about that conduct.
MR. BOWMAN:

About that particular conduct, but

44
that is not the case»
Q

All right, that may be, but nevertheless, to

that extent, the statute in this case should not be
declared invalid on its face.

If the statute has ever

been construed in the manner that xve have been talking, the
statute should not be declared invalid on Its face here.
MR. BOWMAN:

If that Is the case, but that is

not the case here, your Honor.

I concede that if the Court

of Military Appeals had said that this particular conduct
in this particular circumstance is covered by the statute,
that is true, but that is not true here.
Q

You must be saying, then, that the Court of

Military Appeals has never construed Article 134
definitely to include certain conduct?
MR. BOWMAN:

That is quite correct.

It has not.

Indeed, as I say, it has stated that the failure to list an
offense doesn’t mean that it can’t be covered by Article 134.
Q

I understand that.

MR. BOV/MAM:

Yes, well, the Court —- right, but

the Court —
Q

But how about the ones where it has got

firm convictions?
MR. BOWMAN:

It has a firm conviction, but it

has never said -what —
Q

Regarding engaging in certain conduct?

45
MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, but it has never said that

Article 134 has been limited to that conduct.
Q

I know it, not limited, but at least for the

next fellow who does that, engages in that conduct —
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Yes, in that particular conduct —

You are talking a variety of overbreadth,

is what you are —
HR. BOWMAN:
Q

Yes.

-— because the statute still could be vague

as to somebody else, could it not?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

Yes.

For that particular conduct,

MR. BOWMAN:

That — if the Court of Military

Appeals had specifically said — yes, your Honor, I —
Q

Well, if it defends a conviction for certain

kinds of conduct, it seems to me it has said that 134 covers
it.
MR. BOWMAN:

Yes, your Honor, but it hasn't

done that with respect to the particular conduct that we ai’e
involved in here.
Now, the Government suggests that, apart from
what the Manual represents as a repository of custom and
practice, that the Manual gives fair warning.
Nov;, the inadequacy of this is, as I have
shown with regard to custom and practice, is that the Court

of Military Appeals has frequently held that offenses which
are not covered can still be charged under 132M
In addition, new offenses are added every single
time you have nev; editions of the Manual.

As a matter of

fact, the disloyalty provision here was added in 1951 after
the Uniform Code of Military Justice was enacted and you
cannot say here that there was any considered or legislative
judgment that this particular type of conduct should be
covereed.
Now, the Government’s principal argument, I think,
whether
really goes to the question of/the constitutional rules of
vagueness which we have been discussing have any application
to the military and the Government must offer some justifica­
tion why the rules for the military should be different and
it is not enough to say just that the military is involved.
This Court has always taken the approach that the
party who wishes to relax Constitutional principle must have
the burden of showing why those principles should not apply
in the particular situation and this Court indicated
Frontlero

in

and Toth v. Quarles that this rule certainly

applies to the military.
And the highest military courts in Jacoby and
Templa and the lower federal courts have taken that approach,
as well as the two circuit courts here and there are
compel.ling reasons, I think, why the Sonstitutional standards

47
of vagueness should apply to the military.
In the first case, you have people in the
military who are draftees, volunteers who leave their
civilian life for at least a period of two years.

They give

up civilian life, they make sacrifices and there is
absolutely no reason why, with regard to knowledge, why they
should not have the same protection with regard to statutes
that civilians have.
Furthermore, the uniform Code of Military
Justice is a penal statute.

It is a penal statute and it is

no different from any other civilian penal statutes.

It

imposes penalties, people can go to jail for this and there
is no reason why different standards should apply and the
Government offers nothing here, really, than code words and
slogans such as ''military necessity" and instead of any
analysis of the issue.
Now, I admit that it may be convenient for the
military to have a vague and overbroad statute.

Indeed, all

enforcing authorities, I am sure have come which find it
convenient to have such a broad statute, to have an openended statute.

But that is precisely why this Court has

struck down such statutes because you can’t give enforcing
authorities wide and uncontrolled discretion.
Now, there are, indeed, with regard to Solicitor
General's argument that the military needs Article 134, I

suggest to you that there are at least several military men
who don’t agree with that, who sa.y that we can get by without
Article 134•

The chief judge, the Army Board of Review,

General Hudson, said that and the Secretary of Defense own
task force on the administration of justice recommended that
Article — which included, by the way, the judge advocate
generals — recommended that Article 134 be abolished and I
suggest for any conduct that the military doesn’t like, they
have a very simple solution and that is to go to Congress
and enact specific punitive articles. They have done this
when
before and/the Uniform Code of Military Justice was adopted
in 1949, there was certain conduct covered by Article 134
which were made into specific punitive articles.
Q

Could you suggest by way of hypothesis what

specific provisions — you have apparently thought about it —
what specific provision would you suggest would meet this
problem?
MR. BOWMAN:

Well, I presume you would run — I

think you could draw a statute — I, frankly, haven’t
thought of the wording -— which would prohibit all — which
prohibits tne, let’s say, the publication of any statement
which, let’s say, draws into question Governmental policy.
I think you would then, of course, run into the First
Amendment,
Q

Do you think that is less vague than this?

MR. BOWMAN:

Frankly, to be perfectly honest,

your Honor, I have not thought about this statute
sufficiently to draw it up just without thinking about it.
Q

But you are telling us this could readily

I thought that is what you were saying.
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

No, I am saying that if there is —

It is very easy to tell.

MR. BOWMAN:

No, I am saying that if there is

particular conduct which the Army doesn’t like, they should
go and enact specific articles.

I am not prepared at this

time to draft a statute right now as to what could be
covered.

I think that you could draft a statute.

You

might, of course, in this particular context, run into a
First Amendment question as to whether they could validly
pass a statute, or

whether a statute like that would with­

stand this Court’s scrutiny but, frankly, your Honor, I am
not prepared to, at this time, draft a statute which might
cover this activity.
Q

But the Solicitor General thinks that the

fact that you are in the Army gives you a little more
knowledge than you have in civilian life.
MR. BOWMAN:
issue with that.
Q

Well, your Honor, now, I take

I don’t think —
Well, do you agree that after you have been

in the Array about 30 days, you realize that you, for various

50
reasons, you find out you don't have the same freedom of
speech you have at home?
MR. BOWMAN:
Q

I think that is true and I think —

Is that true?

MR. BOWMAN:

It is certainly true, your Honor,

but it is certainly no indication, if you look at the
statute, at the Manual, as to what you can and cannot do.
Obviously, when you —
Q

But you do know that it is a little less.

MR. BOV/MAN:
Q

Yes, I agree that —

However, it's the Solicitor's point that in

that framework, the longer you were in there, you began to
understand.
MR. BOWMAN:

I think you begin to understand

that anything you do which the commanding officer might not
like, you do risk punishment under Article 15*1•
that the freedom of speech is less.

I admit

That does not mean, and

I won't go into it now, but that doesn't mean that the test

of other ways you can learn, other than 13*1.
MR. BOWMAN:

Well, that is true, but Article 13*1

does stand and this is —*
Q

Did you ever hear about K.P.?

[Laughter.]
MR. BOWMAN:

Oh, I've heard about K.P., your

51

Honor but if, as Mr. Justice Stewart, I believe, suggested
to the Solicitor General. If the military could easily have
given an order — or your Honor did — an order not to do
what he did.

It was very simple.
Now, in the few moments —
Q

Do you think that is really an enforceable

mechanism, to wait until something is happening and then
give a direct order not to do it?
MR. BOWMAN:

Well, I think it would simply have

taken care of this problem and it would probably take care
of a lot of problems In the military, yes.
Q

Do you think as a generality that would be

an effective mechanism?
MR. BOWMAN:

No, I don't think so.

I think that

as a practical matter, the way to cover this type of
conduct is to enact specific punitive articles.
Now, in the few moments remaining, I would just
like to discuss the question of overbreadth.

Article 13^,

the Government concedes, at least in its brief, reaches
First Amendment activities and the Court has struck down
statutes and the Government concedes that the Court has
struck down statutes on their face if it reaches First
Amendment activities.
The Government's point here is that since
Article 13^ covers conduct outside of the First Amendment

as well as within the First Amendment, this Court should not
consider the statute on Its face.
Now, the Government cites no case for that
proposition

and, frankly, I note no case holdings that

because a statute can cover all types of conduct, it should
be held overbroad because it impinges on the First Amendment.
This statute, because it is so all-embracing, covers a whole
variety of activity including First Amendment activities
and is, therefore, overbroad and should be struck down.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

the case Is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:55 o’clock p.m. , the case
was submitted.]
