ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT A. ROSENTHAL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The events in this case began three years ago
this month.

In early February of 1971, Metropolitan Police

Officer Marion Green was told by a reliable Informer that
Lonnie Gooding, the Petitioner in this case, was selling
narcotics from his home.
Mr. Green investigated and on February 9th, 1971
using this purportedly reliable informant, caused a
controlled or supervised buy to be made and apparently the
informer bought a small amount of narcotics.
Two days later, on February 11th, Officer Green
having been satisfied that a violation of federal law was
probably taking place, made application to the United States
Magistrate for the District of Columbia for a search warrant
This application had been approved by an Assistant United
States Attorney as an application under federal law for
violations of the federal narcotic laws.

The Magistrate so found after reviewing the
affidavit and issued a search warrant and he did direct that
the search could be executed at any time of the day or night.
Officer Green and six to ten other metropolitan
police officers on the evening of February 12, 1971 did enter
Mr. Gooding's apartment and did find various narcotics and
narcotic implements.
As a result thereof, Mr. Gooding was indicted for
violation of federal narcotics laws and that is where we
stand today.
The

search here was a search for violations of

the federal lav/ by the members of the metropolitan police.

At

no time during the application for the search warrant or in
the investigation is there any indication that a violation
of metropolitan or of the District of Columbia Code was
involved.
The entire search and the entire process was
geared to searching out for violations of federal narcotics
lav/s and probable cause having been shown, a search warrant,
because of those alleged violations, was

issued.

We filed a motion to suppress the evidence in the
District Court and the District Court granted the motion on
the basis that the federal narcotics search warrant procedure
standard had to be modified by the District of Columbia Code
for Reform Act Provisions in Title 23.

The Government appealed and the three judges of
the Court of Appeals, although all voting to reverse, none­
theless all reached different opinions.

Each judge determined

that 21 U.S.C. 879(a) was the controlling standard because
this was a search for violations of federal law.
Judge Wilkey, who wrote the majority opinion,
indicated that if the magistrate had probable cause to
believe that the narcotics could be found at any time of the
day or night, then Section 879(a) authorized him to direct
execution at any time of the day or night.
Judge Fahey interpreted the statute a little bit
differently.

Prior to the effective date of Section 879(a),

narcotic searches had been governed by former 18 U.S.C.
Section 1405.

That law was well-settled.

If the magistrate

had probable cause to issue the basic warrant itself, he
could authorize its service at any time of the day or night
without any further findings.
Judge Fahey felt that Section 1^05 was carried
forward into Section 879(a), so all the magistrate had to
find was probable cause for the warrant itself.

If he made

that finding, he could authorize nighttime service without
anything more.
Judge Robinson, in effect, dissented in principle
from his colleagues.

He felt that the last seven words,

Section 879(a)”and for its service at such time," meant

6
something.

It meant that the magistrate had to be presented

with, and had to find, some justification for nighttime
search.

The police had to offer some good reason why they

needed to go into a person’s home at night as opposed to going
in the daytime.
He concluded that the police had to show some
form of reasonable cause or exigent cimcumstances before they
could be authorized to get a nighttime warrant.

He felt that

the statute itself was plain on its face as to that require­
ment, although it is true the statute does not spell out the
particulars that one has to show.

But then, on the other

hand, neither does this Court’s recently revised Rule 41
state what is reasonable cause shown for a nighttime search.
So it is obviously within the competence of a court to make
those findings.
Judge Robinson, however, even though the
Government below had conceded that this warrant would not
meet any particularized showing, nevertheless held that it
satisfied his interpretation of Section 879(a) and he voted to
sustain the warrant and to reverse the district judge.
We believe there are two basic issues to present
here today.

The first is, this

Court must decide whether

this search is governed by 21 U.S.C. 879(a) or whether it is
governed by 23 D.C. Code Sections 521, 522 or 523.
Once that decision is made, the Court must

7
then determine whether the warrant meets the tests of the
statute which it so selects.

There are good reasons why

either of the statutory procedures could be determined to be
the one that was the dividing one.
For example, Section 879(a) is in the United
States’ Code.

It is federal law.

It concerns itself with

violations of federal narcotics laws and indeed, here we have
a search for violations of the federal narcotics laws.
Moreover, a United States Magistrate issued it.
In effect, he was issuing a federal warrant in this case.
The whole search has the aura of a federal search and that is
one good reason, most likely, why each judge of the Court
of Appeals below determined tnat 879(a) should be the
controlling standard.
On the other hand, it may be that Title 23 of the
D.C. Code, which became effective February 1, 1971, should
be the controlling standard.

The entire investigation,

search warrant application and search was conducted solely
by members of the District of Columbia police.

There were no

federal officers of any type in any way involved.
It is clear from reading chapter 5 of Title 23
of the D.C, Code that the provisions are broad enough to
authorize the District of Columbia police to apply for and
receive warrants issued for violations of federal law.
Moreover, Congress, when it passed this lav;,

8
thought It was passing a complete and comprehensive code of
criminal procedure for the District of Columbia.
Now,

obviously, since the District of Columbia

police are only a local police force, it seems logical that
any

search warrants that they apply for under federal law

should be governed by the provisions of then-recently-enacted
Title 23.
The Government, however, suggests that this
search should be governed by Title 33 Section 414 of the
District of Columbia Code.

That section is found in the

District of Columbia’s Uniform Narcotic Drug Act.
All three judges below rejected the argument
that Section 4l4 could govern this search.

For example,

Judge Robinson indicated that the local provisions, that is,
Title 33, extend only to searches based on suspected
narcotics transgressions for the District's own drug laws.
Here, every warrant document indicates that the
search was conducted for violations of the federal narcotics
laws.

No party to the search warrant application, its

issuance or its execution, had any inkling that this search
might be governed by Title 33 of the District of Columbia
Code.
Now, the Government is seeking that this warrant
be governed by Title 33 because there is a strong possibility
that it was invalid for nighttime search.

We believe that it

9
is highly improper, at this time, to transform the warrant
from a federal warrant into a D.C. warrant, especially since
the Government wants to do it to justify the search.
The Government has to stand or fall on the four
corners of the warrant and every corner of that warrant is
marked federal law, 26 U.S.C. Section 4704.
Moreover, the procedural regularities of the
varying search warrant procedure codes must be adhered to and
it is important that, in this respect, that the magistrate
know under what search warrant provisions he is being asked
to issue a warrant.
Once this Court determines which search warrant
procedure this warrant should be tested by, the task then
becomes determining does the warrant meet that test?
If the warrant Is governed by Title 23 of the
District of Columbia Code, the answer is clear, the warrant
is invalid.

The Government does not argue to the contrary

and the warrant on its face shows that the requisite
requirements of Title 23 were not met.
They are spelled out very specifically in the
statute and there is no indication anywhere in the warrant
paper that any of those circumstances existed.
QUESTION:

Well, except, wasn't the Government

claim here that this search was not conducted in the night­
time?

10

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, the Government, foi* the first

time in this entire case, is saying that 9:30 at night, some
four hours after sunset, is not night.
QUESTION:

So, to that extent, I suppose the

Government would say that the conditions of 23 were complied
with, wouldn’t it?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes.

We are not contesting that

the warrant would be invalid for daytime search under 23*
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Now, if the Court decides that

Section 879(a) is the standard, then we also believe that the
warrant Is defective.

We believe that the plain language of

Section 879(a) requires some showing beyond basic probable
cause for the warrant Itself, to justify intrusion into a
man’s home at night.
Had Congress intended to carry forward the former
Section 1405, it is obvious it would have carried it forward
intact without changing it except expanding the types of
drugs, narcotics and other substances to which it applied.
The Government failed to do this and Congress
failed to do this.

Instead, it issued a statute which on Its

face says there has to be something more for nighttime service.
QUESTION:

Well, are you, in effect, reading into

879(a) the explicit provision of 522(c)(1), namely, the
application must demonstrate that a) It cannot be executed

11

during the hours of daylight?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

No, we’re not — we did advocate

that to the Court of Appeals but it was, as we have indicated
in the reply brief, we are not advancing that argument here.
We are contending that 879(a) requires some additional
showing and it may be enforcing it that Congress didn’t spell
it out like it did in the D.C. Code.
QUESTION:

What additional showing?

MR. ROSENTHAL:

An additional showing of why

the police need to go into a man’s home at night.

Reasonable

cause shown is the test this Court has set forth in Rule JJl.
Judge Robertson said —
QUESTION:

Well, if you have to show why you

have to go in at night, doesn’t that imply that it can’t be
executed during the hours of daylight?
MR. ROSENTHAL:
you can’t do it.

Well, that may be one reason why

I mean, the standards in 521 are some of

the obvious reasons why you need a nighttime search warrant
as opposed to a daytime search warrant, but Congress didn’t
limit it, didn’t say anything about what the standards would
be, but those would certainly be reasonable standards.

It

Is a reasonable test and we believe that there has to be some
showing of exigency, some need.
QUESTION:

Well, some showing

of probable cause

to believe grounds exist for the service in the nighttime.

12
MR. ROSENTHAL:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is the way you read 879(a).

MR. ROSENTHAL:

That is correct.

Thus, we don’t believe that 879(a) is ambiguous
in the sense of not saying what Congress Intended, that the
only thing missing are the particulars, but that Is not fatal
because this Court always has to interpret what probable
cause means under the Fourth Amendment or statutes authorizing
search warrants and also under the Rule 4l you are going to
have to interpret what reasonable cause shown means.
QUESTION:

Now —

I gather the search warrants under 414

may be issued either by the Superior Court or by United States
Magistrate?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

That is correct.

They may be

directed solely to District of Columbia police and violations
QUESTION:

And under 879 they may be obtained

either from a District Court judge or a United States
magistrate.
MR. ROSENTHAL:
QUESTION:

Right.

Although what it says is, if the

judge — does judge mean only
MR. ROSENTHAL:

District Court judge In 879(a)?

No, I believe, and I’d have to

doublecheck, I believe there is a definition that means a
state court judge, too.
QUESTION:

Well, how about a Superior Court judge

13
in the District?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, if it does say state court

judge5 then I think it would have to include a District of
Columbia Superior Court judge, too, because the District of
Columbia is defined as a state in this Act.
It is the legislative history in this case that
causes the ambiguity and we believe that since the statute is
clear on its face, that it requires some additional showing.
There is no need to resort to the legislative history.
Moreover, that legislative history doesn’t supply
any standards governing what justifies a nighttime search.
Thus, it really adds nothing and, in fact, it just confuses
the entire issue.
We also contend that this warrant does not
satisfy Section 879(a) as we interpret that statute — and
here we differ from Judge Robinson.
First of all, in the Court of Appeals, the
Government conceded that this warrant contains none of the
particularities which might be required by an interpretation
of 879(a) in which it is found that 879(a) requires more than
former Section 1405.
The Government has not acknowledged that
concession here but it certainly made it to the Court of
Appeals.
Secondly, there is Just no justification in this

record for a nighttime search.
issue.

Speed is obviously not an

The controlled buy was made on February 9th —
QUESTION:

Under 879, under the plain language of

the statute which you rely on, don’t you have to make the
same showing for a daytime service as a nighttime service?
MR. ROSENTHAL:
grammatically.

One could construe that

However, given this country’s history and the

common law’s dislike of nighttime searches, I take It —
we are
QUESTION: I know, but/looking at the face of the
statute, not the — you said your approach Is to the statute,
not legislative history or something else.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

I agree.

When you look at that,

it would say you would have to show something for daytime
search, too, but we believe that since —
QUESTION:

That isn’t your approach?

MR. ROSENTHAL:
QUESTION:

No.

You are saying you must show something

at night, other than what you would have to show for a day­
time search?
QUESTION:

Yes, because night is always the

exception and under the common law, you couldn't serve search
warrants at night.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

I am just suggesting, then, you

are departing from the plain language statute.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

To that extent, yes.

15
In this case, the Government, the police officers
had obviously no need for speed.

They were in no rush but

the controlled buy was made on February 9th, the warrant was
applied for on February 11th and the search was conducted on
February 12th.

All these were same days — all these were

days of the week in the same week.

There were no intervening

weekends.
Or, Judge Robinson suggests that there is some
evidence that Mr. Gooding was conducting a drug peddling
operation.

We believe that there is just insufficient

evidence of that and vie, of course, don’t concede that Is a
justification to go in at night in any case.
We don’t know the volume of narcotics Mr. Gooding
was purportedly selling.

We don’t know from the warrant the

volume of narcotics he had in

lii3

home at the time the

Informer went in to make the controlled buy.
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn’t that be a rather

difficult thing for an informer or the officer making the
affidavit to state In any case?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, the Informant said

Mr. Gooding was selling narcotics from his home and you could
3ay, it seems to me the Informant could say, based on his
knowledge, he Is selling a lot of narcotics or he is selling
them only to close friends.
Secondly, the informant told the police officer

16
that the narcotics were kept in a green lady's handbag.

It

may be that the informer could have seen the volume of
narcotics in that lady's green handbag.
I think he said it that way.
But I think the informer could have given some
more particulars on the volume.

I mean, if you are going to

cut out a classification of people who aren't entitled to
the protection from nighttime searches, making person who is
in the supermarket sale of narcotics, I think you are going
to have — there has to be more shown and there is just —that is just not indicated here.
QUESTION:

That is is good armor Of the statute,

Mr. Rosenthal, if you draw on the common law

concepts when

lighting wasn't very good and streets were very dangerous, when
there are lights in homes as readily as there are now, but the
Congress did not draw the statute that way, apparently, so
the Court of Appeals thought.
MR. ROSENTHAL:
Appeals thinks so.

Well, one judge of the Court of

The majority did not.

They said there

is, in effect, no difference — Congress has said there is no
difference between day and night.
QUESTION:

However —

Then he went on to find that it was

satisfied, didn't he?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, he did and we think he

erred there because there just weren't sufficient findings

17
below plus the fact the Government had conceded that this
warrant did not have anything of a particularized nature
justifying a nighttime search.
Finally, the Government is alleging — is claiming
here that, should the Petitioner prevail, nonetheless, the
evidence should not be suppressed.

We believe that Congress

has established search warrant standards and if those
standards are not enforced through the suppression
mechanism, then the will of Congress is going to be
frustrated.
Congressionally-created procedures are just as
important as the Constitutional procedures and they must be
enforced.

Moreover, recently, the Calandra case, we believe

that this Court reinforced the continuing validity of the
Weeks Rule for suppression of evidence at trial that was
unlawfully seized when it is being used against the person
from whom it is seized and this is, precisely, our case.
We are not asking this Court to expand the
exclusionary rule in any respect.

We are just asking it to

continue its enforcement, as it has in the past, to suppress
the evidence, evidence which is unlawfully seized.
The fact that the magistrate may have misunder­
stood the law is not grounds, in our view, to create an
exception to the exclusionary rule.
the magistrate misunderstood the law.

In Aguilar and Splnelli,
The police came to

18
them In good faith and made an affidavit and the magistrate
thought it was sufficient.
QUESTION:

But those were both Constitutional

violations, weren’t they, Aguilar and Spinelli?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

That is correct.

believe that you can make that distinction.

We don’t
For example, in

Miller versus United States, the police made a noknock entry
in violation of the U.S. Code statute.

This Court held that

the evidence must be suppressed because of the illegality
of the entry.
So I don’t think that there is any case that
suggests that the fact that a statutory procedure is violated
is worthy of less protection than when a constitutional
procedure is violated.

It appears that If the warrant Is

Invalid either because it violates the Constitution or it
violates some statutory requirement, then the search must be
invalidated and the evidence must be suppressed.
Thus, we don’t believe that this ’’good faith"
argument should be granted because any time the magistrate
makes a mistake of law, the Government is going to claim,
well, everybody was in good faith.

But that is not the case

because if the magistrate makes the mistake, then the paper
he is issuing is really just a piece of paper.
isn't a warrant.

It really

It is invalid and the whole purpose of

having a magistrate Is to make sure that the police have

19
established probable cause and complied with all the
statutory requisites before they enter a person's home.
Hence, for these reasons, we are asking the Court
to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well,

Mr. Rosenthal.
Mr. Frey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In this case, District of Columbia police
officers executed a narcotics search warrant at 9:30 in the
evening.

In so doing, they were complying fully with the

command of the magistrate in the warrant.

The magistrate

had, in issuing the warrant, expressly authorized its
execution at any time of the day or night.
The application for the warrant recited facts
which, it is not disputed, established probable cause with
respect to an offense under Title 26 of the U.S. Code.
We submit, also, that it cannot seriously be
disputed that the facts

recited in the application for

the warrant made out an offense under Title 33 of the
District of Columbia Code.
The issue is whether evidence seised when this

20
warrant was executed in full compliance with its terras
should be suppressed because the magistrate erred in
authorizing execution at any time of the day or night.
Now, since the facts recited in the application
for the warrant made out a violation both of the District of
Columbia and of the United States Code, it is our view that
the nighttime execution was proper, if it was proper under
either local district law or under the applicable federal
law.
We contend that it was lawful under both.
And we contend that the choice is not between
the federal law and Title 23 of the District of Columbia
Code, as I will argue that as simply a provision that is not
and

cannot be applicable to a narcotics search in the

District of Columbia.
QUESTION:

These were police officers, city

police officers?
MR. PREY:

Yes, they were and —

QUESTION:

Well, how could the magistrate give

them a federal warrant?
MR. PREY:

Well, Section 138 of Title IV of the

D.C. Code expressly authorizes them to do so and Justice
Douglas’ dissent from the denial of certiorari in the Thomas
case, in which I believe you concurred, made that same
conclusion, that the D.C. police officers are, to that extent,

21
federal agents with a duty to enforce federal as well as
local law.
QUESTION:

Is it your submission that Judge

Gesell’s holding, then, was not even a possible alternative
in this case?
MR. PREY:
simply is inapplicable.

Well, we submit that Title 23
Obviously, if Title 23 is applicable,

the warrant did not properly authorize nighttime execution.
We submit the Title 23 cannot be applicable to a narcotics
search.
QUESTION:

Although Judge Gesell held that that

was the applicable —
MR. FREY:

Although Judge Gesell held that it

was applicable to all searches by D.C. police officers, we
submit that that manifestly cannot be so.
QUESTION:

Well, what did you tell the magistrate?

I am very worried about this going to a magistrate.

Was the

magistrate issuing a federal or a state warrant?
MR. PREY:

He was issuing a search warrant.

QUESTION:

Federal or state?

MR. PREY:

Well, our contention is that it was a

warrant authorizing the D.C. police officers to search
Mr. Gooding’s home and that you cannot characterize —
QUESTION:

And if it was valid under one, It

was good and if it was valid under the other — is that

22
quite the way to do business?
MR. PREY:

Well, I'm not sure, and, Indeed, in

view of the way this case has developed, I understand that it
is now — they are now, as a matter of course, reciting both
the District of Columbia Code and the federal violation in
the warrant applications.
But the cases have held that you need not —
QUESTION:

In a state, like the State of

Maryland, could the State of Maryland issue a search warrant
for a violation of the federal code?
MR. FREY:

I'm not clear whether — you mean —

there is no question that a Maryland —
QUESTION:

A state magistrate.

MR. FREY:

A state judge may, under Rule 41 -~

and I think under this provision of the U.S. Code, may issue
a warrant to a federal officer.
QUESTION:

No, no, this Is a state officer.

MR. FREY:

Well, in the case of Maryland, I think

only a federal officer may apply.

Now, that includes District

of Columbia police.
QUESTION: Now, as I understand, it is the
Government’s position that you make it initially upon your
state.
MR. FREY:

Well, the statute —

QUESTION:

Well, this state, I'm taking it, is a

23

state like Maryland and I have never heard of a state
magistrate issuing a search warrant for a violation of a
federal offense to a state officer.
it.

I have never heard of

Now, I’m not saying it is not done.
MR. FREY:

Well, I simply — that analogy I don’t

think is applicable to our case, Mr. Justice Marshall,
because we are dealing with a warrant that was issued by a
federal magistrate to an officer who was, for these purposes,
a federal and a local officer.
QUESTION:

Is the magistrate in Washington a

federal magistrate?
MR. FREY:
Courthouse.

I think he is in the United States

I believe he is a federal appointee.
Now, he is, I think, under Section 1^3 of Title

IV of the D.C. Code also authorized to issue local search
warrants.
QUESTION:
really find out.

Yes, well, there is no way we can

I guess it is unimportant.

MR. FREY:

Our argument, Mr. Justice Marshall,

is that on the face of the application for the search
warrant, certain facts were recited which the magistrate
found to be the case.

Those facts make out a violation of

the District of Columbia Code and make out a violation of
the United States Code.
Since it has been held that you need not recite

24
any provision that is being violated in the warrenfc application
and, indeed,

the form in the Appendix to the Federal Rules

of Criminal Procedure has no place to put down the provision
that is violated and since it has been held that you can put
down the wrong provision and the warrant is not invalidated,
I fail to see why, if you put down another correct provision,
that should preclude us from relying on the District of
Columbia law.

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, I gather that your position

at least is that 521 and 523 are inapplicable.
MR. FREY:

Certainly.

QUESTION:

But you don’t claim that 4l4 is

applicable, do you?
MR. FREY:

We do claim that 4l4 —

QUESTION:

Then you disagree with the Court of

MR. FREY:

We do disagree with the Court of

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

Appeals.

Appeals.
Well, the Court of Appeals

held it inapplicable, not necessarily because it was resolving
the conflict as I read it between 4l4 and 521, if it is a
conflict, but

rather because 4l4(c) arguably imposes an

additional requirement that wasn’t met here.
MR. FREY:

Well —

QUESTION:

Therefore, they go on to say, that

25

this requirement, we will proceed in the assumption that 414
would not validate the search warrants involved.
MR. PREY:

We have argued in our brief that this

requirement is clearly met on the face of the record
because the requirement to examine on oath and to have
affidavits or deposition of the witnesses requires two things.
One is that the magistrate personally take the
oath of the Complainant, which was done here and the second
is that the basis for the warrant application be reduced to
writing, either in the form of an affidavit or in the form
of a deposition.
QUESTION:

Well, tell me, Mr. Prey, even if all

this is right, ordinarily we don't review interpretations by
the Court of Appeals, either of the District or of the
United States Court of Appeals, of the meaning of District
Code provisions, do we?
MR. PREY:

Well, I think that would be true

QUESTION:

Do we, ordinarily?

MR. PREY:

No, you don't ordinarily.

QUESTION:

Why should we in this case?

MR. PREY:

Well, you would be deciding this case

as to the —■

in a rather artificial context, I think, if you ignored the
fact that you have to recognize the fact that the District
of Columbia Code contains a provision for narcotics searches

26
which requires the magistrate to authorise such searches at
any time of the day or night.

You can't decide this case as

though that provision does not exist.

I am not saying that

the officers in this case acted in reliance on that provision
when they secured the warrant and I agree that ordinarily you
would not take this case to determine the issue of whether
they complied with the Title 33 procedural requirements,
although I don't believe that issue was clearly argued to
the Court of Appeals.

I think it is clear that it was an

unconsidered dictum because the considerations that they
offer were not actually presented.
Now, with respect to Section —

QUESTION:

I wonder if either the United States

Court of Appeals or the District Court any more has the same
authoritative mantle in construing the District of Columbia
statutes since the Court Reorganization Act and the Enactment
of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
MR. PREY:

I think it would be the District of

Columbia Court of Appeals.

Now, In this case, we are

dealing — the Thomas case was an identical case on its facts,
just about, to this case and the District of Columbia Court
of Appeals there, without really considering whether Section
Mli} could be relied upon, held that you could not look to
Title 23 of the District Code as providing the applicable
standard and it looked to Title 21 of the United States Code
and held that the nighttime authorization —
QUESTION:

There you are.

That is a determination,

at least a decision which indicates a construction by the D.C.

28
Court of Appeals, not by the United States Court of Appeals,
that 4l4 does not apply.
MR. PREY:

Well, with all respect, Justice

Brennan, I don’t believe that was a holding by the D.C.
Court of Appeals on the availability of 4l4.

They simply

were talking about the relative applicability of the Title 21
provision and the Title 23 provision without had presented
to them the argument that we have presented to you.
Now, with respect to Section 879(a), the U.S.
Code provision, unless there are any specific questions, I
think the necessity of a special showing of

exigent

circumstances or the like for authorization of nighttime
execution of a federal narcotics search ivarrant has been
fully covered in our briefs end in the opinions of the two
District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
With respect to Title 23, Judge Gesell held that
all warrants issued to District of Columbia police were subject
to the provisions of Title 23 of the D.C. Code regarding the
necessity of a special showing for the authorisation of
nighttime execution.
Now, we think this position is beset with
insurmountable difficulties.

In the first place, In order to

avoid the impact of Title 33, Petitioner has had to argue that
this was a federal warrant application, that it was issued by
a federal magistrate, that it was for a violation of federal

29
law and then he says, well, it was okay under federal law.
Let’s put that to one side and let’s apply local law.
That is, he wants to say on the one hand, you
can’t apply Title 33 because this was a federal warrant and
on the other hand, he wants to say you must apply Title 23
of the D.C. Code because these were District of Columbia
police officers.
Now, we think he can’t have it both ways.
Also, the alleged policy basis for his argument
is completely undercut by the existence of Title 33*

Let us

assume for the moment that you don’t consider properly before
or you don't wish to decide our contention that this search
was valid under Title 33*
Nevertheless, what kind of a policy do we have
reflected in Title 23, which Judge Gesell found which says
that all searches must be,nighttime searches must have
especial justification,

if the District of Columbia police

need no special justification to make a local, nighttime
narcotics search and to get a warrant for that purpose?
And if, under the federal law, no special
justification is required, how can it be that the D.C. police,
what policy is it that makes the D.C. police make especial
justification for a nighttime warrant and to enforce federal
law?
I think there simply is no rational basis for

30
interpreting Title 23 to impose such a requirement.
Now, ITd like to turn at this point, if I may, to
the exclusionary rule argument.
Let us assume that the magistrate erred in
directing the police to execute this warrant at any time of
the day or night and that least five members of this Court are
of the view that contrary to the conclusions of the three
appellate courts that have previously considered this issue,
the applicable statutes required the magistrate to elicit a
special showing in support of the nighttime execution
authorization that he conferred.
Does it necessarily follow that the evidence
seized under this warrant should be excluded?
Petitioner contends that it does.

He argues, in

effect, that any irregularity in the issuance or execution
of a search warrant, whether or not of constitutional
dimensions, whether or not wilful or flagrant, whether or
not done only after being expressly authorized by a neutral
and detached

magistrate, must lead to exclusion of the

evidence obtained.
The primary reason he advances for this view
the necessity to avoid tainting the purity of our judicial
process.

Now, we contend that the application of the

exclusionary rule in this case would represent an
inappropriate extension of the rule to or beyond its

is

31
outermost limits and would seriously

disserve the interests

of justice and undermine the integrity of the criminal
justice system.
In the first place, we are not dealing here with
a constitutional violation.

This is a case in which

exclusion, if there Is to be any, must come from an invocation
of the court’s supervisory power.
Now, in the McNabb case, which Is, perhaps, the
leading case on the question of supervisory powers, the
Court described the occasion for the exercise of such powers
for exclusion as follows — and I am quoting from page 3^5
of Volume 318:
"Plainly, a conviction resting on evidence
secured through such a flagrant disregard of the procedure
which Congress has commanded, cannot be allowed to stand
without making the courts themselves accomplices in wilful
disobedience of law."
Now, we contend that this case does not come
anywhere near that standard for the exercise of the court’s
supervisory power for exclusion.
Now, secondly, we point out that if there was
error here, it was made in good faith.

The police and the

magistrate can hardly be accused of wilful disobedience of
a clear statutory mandate when eight of the nine appellate
judges who have thus far expressed their views on the question

32
uphold the propriety of the authorization of nighttime
excution under facts such as these.
Therefore, the objective of deterrence of
official misconduct cannot possibly be furthered by the
application of an exclusionary rule in this case.
Finally, the error, if there was an error, was
that of the magistrate and not that of the officers.

The

warrant application did not specifically request authorization
for nighttime execution.

It was the magistrate who directed

that it be served at any time of the day or night.

MR. FREY:

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know that one way or the

other, but I am saying that when you say that the officer
has no responsibility at all, only the magistrate, I say that
if the magistrate had been wrong in giving it the night, the
officers could have corrected it and enforced it in the day.

33
That is all I am saying.
MR. PREY:

Well* but I think, Justice Marshall,

that it is unrealistic to suppose that when the police
officer gets a command from the magistrate saying, "You are
commanded forthwith to serve this warrant within ten days

He

That’s

And it is up to you to determine

how you want to serve it and the police officers decided that
they would rather serve It at night for some reason unknown to
you or me.
MR. PREY:
Marshall.

Well, let me say this. Justice

It is possible that the magistrate could

authorize execution at any time of the day or night and that
we would agree with you that a particular mode of night­
time execution was illegal, not because it violated a
statute, but because it was unreasonable and therefore in
violation of the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

And as Justice Harland said, it Is

difficult to Imagine a more severe invasion of privacy than
the nighttime intrusion into a private home.
''

MR. PREY:

Well, of course, this brings us to

the argument in the sense that in this particular case, on
these facts, we are talking about a kind of search which
this Court has, in October, 1972, determined would not be

considered a nighttime search.
I want to make my point.

If they went in at

3:00 o’clock in the morning after waiting until they were
sure everybody was asleep with no justification whatsoever for
doing that, then, even though the warrant had authorized
nighttime execution, we might have a question
independent constitutional violation.

of an

But we are talking here

about a request for suppression on the basis of the statute
and on the basis of an error by the magistrate, I think that
it has not heretofore been suggested that the error

was

that of the police officers and I don’t see how, if the
magistrate made a mistake about what the law was, in good
faith, how we can suppose that there would be

effective

deterrence of police officers who, presumably, are far less
sophisticated in their interpretation of a provision like
the 21 U.S.C. 879 or even a magistrate.

Now —

What was Weeks, Mr. Prey?

Weeks was a constitutional —

MR. PREY:

QUESTION:

Was there a warrant?

MR. PREY:

Was there a warrant In Weeks?

not sure that I can answer that.

Yes, Indeed.

I'm

However, I would like to

advert to the quote from Weeks which you had in your
dissenting opinion in

Calandra

because I think that this

35
highlights the difference

between this case and Weeks.

Weeks, the Court said, and I am looking at page 3
of the Calandra slip opinion and it is at page 39^ of
Volume 232 U.S., "To sanction such proceedings would be to
affirm by judicial decision a manifest neglect, if not an
open defiance of the prohibitions of the Constitution,"
Now, we are not talking in this case about an
open defiance, a manifest neglect, or a provision of the
Constitution.
We are talking about, at most, a good faith
mistake by the magistrate and I ask you, suppose that this —
QUESTION

And by the officer.

MR. PREY

Excuse me?

QUESTION:

And by the officer.

MR. PREY:

Well, presumably insofar as he —

QUESTION:

Well, unless he thought that he was

entitled to the warrant, I take it he wouldn’t have made out
the affidavit?
MR. FREY:

I think he probably believed that

he was entitled to the warrant.

Mistakenly, yes.

QUESTION:

I have just looked at Weeks, Mr. Prey,

and you’re correct, there was no xirarrant.

It x^as taken by

an official of the United States without a warrant and in

36
MR. PREY:

We do believe that there is a policy

that favors encouraging the police to go for a warrant and
the Jones, Aguilar and Ventresca language which we have
adverted to in our brief clearly shows that when the police
go to the magistrate for a warrant, a search which otherwise
might not be considered a probable cause search and therefore,
a constitutional violation, will be considered a probable
cause search, in a sense, to reward the police or, alterna­
tively, at least not to punish them, not to hold them to as
stringent standards when they have gone to the magistrate.
QUESTION:
cause.

Well, it wouldn’t change the probable

It might change, you suggest, the exclusionary rule.
MR. PREY:

Well, the — I think the language in

Ventresca suggests that it will change the termination of
probable cause.
Now, I think we get into a question that we don’t
have to face in this case, whether we have a good faith
application that reasonably may have been believed to make
up probable cause when the magistrate issues a warrant and
is subsequently determined the probable cause has not been
made out, whether the application of the exclusionary rule
is appropriate there.

That is not this case because vie are

not dealing with a constitutional violation in this case.
Suppose that after the D.C. Court of Appeals and
the D.C. Circuit had interpreted 879(a) as requiring no

is

37
special showing, we had had the same situation that arose in
this case?

And there probably are cases where there was

nighttime authorization in a warrant and now the Supreme
Court says, no, that is a mistake, 879(a) requires a special
showing.
Can it seriously be contended that it will
further the interests of justice that you vd.ll, in the
language of Justice Brennan in Calandr^ minimize the risk
of seriously undermining popular trust in Government if you
would allow a defendant to go free, would suppress the
evidence against the defendant which was obtained in good
faith reliance on decisions of responsible courts of appeals?
The Miller case, which my colleague has cited to
you which, of course, is a noknock entry case, falls in a
completely different category.
The issue there was not the validity of the
warrant, but of the manner of its execution.

The magistrate

did not authorize the police in Miller to make a noknock
entry.
What's more, I don't think that there was a
contention of good faith in Miller.

In Miller, they did

something which was held to be unlawful, breaking down a
door and going in.

It is, I think, a clearly distinguishable

situation from this.
QUESTION:

Didn't the Court's opinion in the

38
Miller case say that a few more words before the break-in
\fould have satisfied the statute?
MR. FREY:

Well, I think that is right.

In

QUESTION:

In other words, they had not disclosed

any event —

purpose and authority and identity as completely as the
Court thought the statute required.
MR. FREY:

That’s right.

Now, another important point that I want to make,
I think Petitioner has misconceived the thrust of our
argument on the exclusionary rule point in one significant
respect.

If the Court now announces a definitive rule of

interpretation under 879(a) or a definitive rule applicable
to the District of Columbia police, we agree that warrants
thereafter procured in violation of the statute as construed
by the Court would result In the seizure of excludable
evidence.
At that point, of course, you could not make the
defense that this Is a good faith presentation

of an

application to a magistrate which they — which was honestly
believed to provide a basis for authorization of nighttime
execution.
QUESTION:

But no matter what the courts would

say in this particular case, you are still going to get
arguments before magistrates and subsequent opinions as to

39
whether there was or was not a proper showing of validity
for a nighttime search, if the Court should adopt that
proposition.
MR. PREY:

That is true and I suppose there could

be other circumstances in which we would advance the same
argument,

if they got a warrant.

After all, the exclusionary

rule is not required to control the conduct of magistrates.
Magistrates are judicial officers.

They are presumably

under the control of the judicial branch and presumably there
is some way to get magistrates to obey the law other than
excluding evidence which the police see as pursuant to the
directions of the magistrate.
Now, with the nighttime search argument, I
raise the issue -- and we raised it in our brief •— because
it has some importance beyond the

confines of this immediate

case, the definition of what is nighttime?
The

Court has resolved that question with

respect to searches under Rule *11.

However, it is an open

question, presumably, with respect to searches governed
by the District of Columbia Code where there is no definition
of nighttime or daytime and an ~
QUESTION:

Again, shouldn't we wait on the courts

of the District of Columbia to tell us what they think their
code means?
MR. PREY:

Well, it is also presumably an open

question under the U.S. COde provision Section 879*
QUESTION:

Only If 879(a) is interpreted as

Petitioner is asking us to.
MR. PREY:

Well, we are not asking you to reach

out to the nighttime search issue if you resolve the 879(a)
issue in our favor.
QUESTION:
521, for example?

Well, do you want us to interpret

It certainly explicitly refers to

nighttime.
MR. PREY:

Well, let me say this. If you hold that

this was a nighttime search under 879(a), I think we would
not wish to persist in our argument that it would not be a
nighttime search under Title 23.

So that doesn’t become a

problem.
QUESTION:

You do want us to interpret the

D.C. Code, don't you?
MR. PREY:

Not at all.

QUESTION:

Before the Judges down there get a

chance to interpret it?
MR. PREY:

I simply suggested that we will with­

draw the argument with respect to nighttime search under the
D.C. Code, if you find that it was a nighttime search under
the federal code.
If you find that it was not a nighttime search
under the federal code, you don't have to reach it under the

41
D.C. Code.
However, I have no doubt that what you might say
on the federal code issue would have some possible effect on
the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
QUESTION:

I don't have any doubt, either.

MR. PREY:

But that is an

inevitable result of

the role of this Court.
Now, I think one final point with respect to
Section 879(a).

We have indicated in our brief that the

language of that statute when vre look at it on its face
appears to support the Petitioner's position.
Now, in asking him questions, obviously the
Court was puzzled by what the standard was for the showing
that would have to be made if some showing has to be made.
Nov;, presumably, in order to ascertain the
standard for the showing, one has to go to legislative
history, or at least that is one place one might look.
And when one looks at the legislative history,
one finds that the kind of showing that Congress intended to
be made in thi3 case was no showing at all.
Now, that creates somewhat of a conundrum about
relying on what Petitioner contends is the plain language of
879(a).
For all of these reasons, we submit that the
decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rosenthal, do you

have anything further?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes, your Honor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
HERBERT A. ROSENTHAL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROSENTHAL:

In this case, contrary to what

Mr. Frey suggests, the magistrate was issuing a federal
warrant for violations of federal law.

When you look at the

warrant in the original District Court record, It Is a
federal warrant.
When you look at the background materials that
were presented to the magistrate, it is a federal warrant.
Indeed, the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals, Mr. Justice Brennan, implicitly rejected the
argument that Section 33414 of the D.C. Code would govern.
The arguments that the Government has made in this case, both
here and below, were also made In the Thomas case.

That is,

the warrant should be tested by Title 33 Section 4l4 of the
D.C. Code.
That court elected not to do so and I don't
believe it said specifically, but it certainly means that in
this conflict situation, they held this to be, in effect, a
federal warrant because they said Section 879(a) governs it.
We have the exact same situation here, D.C.

43
police getting a federal warrant.

The District of Columbia

Code said, okay, Section 879 governs.
doesn't govern.

Our code, 3314,

I think that is kind of your state law

interpretation that this Court ought to give great deference
to in interpreting this warrant.
I think both the legislative history of Section
879(a) and recently-revised Rule 4l gives this Court no
guidance as to what standards reasonable cause shown or
probable cause for its service at such time means.
I don’t think that means that argument could be
used to say that this Court did not mean you had to make some
showing for a nighttime search when you get the case asking
for an interpretation of Rule 4l.
Similarly, the fact that the legislative history
of Section 879(a) does not give any indication of possible
standards does not mean that Congress did not intend some
additional showing for nighttime service to be required by
the police and the magistrate.
Thank you.
