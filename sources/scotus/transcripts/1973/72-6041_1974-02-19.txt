ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAL C. BARNETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TOE PETITIONER
MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chiar Justice, may it please the

Courts
The present case comes before the Court under writ
of certiorari to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals,
and it presents the question of the right to a trial by jury
in an action brought by a landlord to recover possession of
real property pursuant to the District of Columbia statutory
eviction proceeding.

And also raises the question of the

right to a jury trial on the tenant's counterclaims for money
damages brought in that same proceeding.
Briefly stated, 'bite facts of the case are as follows:
In August of 1971 the respondent landlord sued the
petitioner for possession of premises held under a lease,
alleging nonpayment of rent for a. three-month period.
On the answer day, the tenant filed an answer denying
that any rent was owed because of the failure of the landlord
to maintain the premises in compliance with the District of
Columbia

housing regulations.

The case law of the District of

4
Columbia and the administrative regulations there permit a
tenant to raise this defense in a possessory action.
■The tenant also filed affirmative claim seeking a
money judgment for expenses incurred by him to repair the
premises and for return of rent paid while the landlord was
in breach of his warranty*
The applicable rules of the Superior Court of the
District of Columbia permit the tenant to raise these
affirmative defenses*
At the same time, on the answer day, the tenant
demanded a trial by jury, paid the requisite fees, and
complied with all necessary requirements for demand of a jury
trial.
The trial judge struck the jury demand, over the
objection of the tenant that he was constitutionally entitled
to a trial by jury.

The case was subsequently tried by the

court, and a judgment for possession was rendered for the
landlord*
On appeal, the court below affirmed the decision of
the trial court, holding that Congress in 1970 had. repealed
the statutory right to a jury trial in these eviction
proceedings, and that there was no constitutional right
to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment in such proceedings.
QUESTION; Did the trial court deal with the tenant's
counte rclaims?

5

HR. BARNETT;

i would think that they did, Your Honor.

The trial court and the — the proceeding of the trial court
ended in a judgment for the landlord.

We presume -that it was

a judgment on the counterclaims as well.
In this respect, evidence tending to prove the
counterclaims was submitted at the trial court.

It wasn't

admitted into evidence, because of the lack of an authenticating
itfitness.

But, nevertheless, the proffer was made and we assume

that the trial judge did rule on the counterclaims.
QUESTION: And ruled against the tenant on them?
MR. BARNETT;

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, doesn't Judge Reilly's opinion, in
the Court of Appeals, give the impression that that rule of
the Superior Court permits the raising of that claim as a
defense only; but that if you want a money judgment on your
counterclaim you have to simply pursue a different remedy
in the Superior Court?
MR. BARNETT:

The thrust of the opinion, Your Honor,

is to require the tenant to bring his affirmative claims in
a separate proceeding.
The point here is, though, that -the rule of the
court permits the tenant to bring it in this proceeding.
QUESTION;

Well, but the Court of Appeals has

interpreted that rule.
MR. BARNETT:

Yes, Your Honor. What the Court of

6

Appeals has done is put a condition on the exercise of the
constitutional right, and certainly hasn’t shown any
predominant State interest, for the reason, to put this
condition on the right -QUESTION: Well, you're not asking us, at any rate,
to second-guess the Court of Appeals as to what the rule of
the Superior Court means, are you?
MR. BARNETT:

No, Your Honor, we’re not -— we're not

at all asking that. The rule seems to be clear that the
tenant could assert the counterclaim in the possessory action.
If the counterclaim is one which arises -— one which would be
tried by jury in 1791, then —
QUESTION:

But that's just what the Court of Appeals

said that the rule didn't mean, as I read it«
MR* BARNETT:

Well, as I read it, Your Honor, the

Court of Appeals said that the tenant may very well have the
right to a jury trial if he brings his affirmative claims
in a subsequent proceeding.
And
QUESTION:

Yes *

MR* BARNETT:

-- we assume that that means that he

has the right of jury trial, on those claims.
QUESTION;

Does the rule say he can recover

damages?
MR. BARNETT;

Yes, Your Honor, the rule

7
QUESTION;

What is the rule?

MR* BARNETT:

— specifically says that he can

recover a money judgment.
QUESTION:

Money judgment in that action?

MR* BARNETT:

Yes, Your Honor.

I'll read the rule

to you.
QUESTION:

Then the Court of Appeals is wrong, you

say?
MR* BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Pardon, Your Honor?

Then you say the Court of Appeals is

wrong in its interpretation of its statute?
MR. BARNETT:

Your Honor, the Court of Appeals

didn't say that the tenant couldn't bring the counterclaims
in the possessory action.

It only said that when he does

bring those claims in the possessory action, he waives his
right to a jury trial on those claims.
QUESTION: Well, couldn't he file another claim for
the damages, with a jury, —
MR* BARNETT:
QUESTION:
MR* BARNETT:
could.

In a separate proceeding.
— in a separate proceeding?
Yes, Your Honor,

We assume that he

There's a question there of whether or not there would

be some collateral estoppel effect of the possessory action.
QUESTION:

But on the opinion of the Court of

Appeals you could sue and you could recover?

8

HR* BARNETT;
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
And that means the difference of filing

another lawsuit.
MR. BARNETT;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor»
Which means thirty dollars •— that's

all it is, isn't it?

Court costs.

MR» BARNETT:

Well, it may be court costs, Your Honor,

but the problems, in terms of administration of justice, are
quite serious, because here we have two trials instead of one,
the same witnesses, the same evidence, -the issues on the
possessory action and the counterclaim clearly overlap.
QUESTION;

Well, don't you have some actions in

equity where you can't recover damages, and if you want
damages you have to go over in the law side?
MR, BARNETT;

Yes, that might be the case, Your

Honor, but —
QUESTION;

Might be?

MR* BARNETT:
equitable claims.

All the claims here —

QUESTION:

You're dealing with damages.

Your Honor?

You’re dealing with damages.

MR. BARNETT:

— we're not dealing here with any

Yes, Your Honor.

What is the section you rely upon?

For

9
MR* BARNETT:

The rule of the Superior Court, Your

Honor.
QUESTION: Where .is it?
MR. BARNETT:

It might be helpful if I read this

rule to you.
QUESTION:

Yes* Where is it?

QUESTION:

In the Appendix or brief?

MR* BARNETT:

Irm not sure where it is in the brief

at this point, Your Honor.

It's quite brief.

I think I

could read it.
The rule provides, it's Rule 5(b) of the Landlord
and Tenant Rules of the Superior Court:

In actions in this

branch for recovery of possession of property in which the
basis of recovery is nonpayment of rent, or in which there
is joined a claim for recovery of rent in arrears, the
defendant may assert an equitable defense of recoupment or
setoff or a counterclaim for a money judgment, based on the
payment of recent or on expenditures claimed as credits against
rent»
That's the particular portion*

It's found in our

main brief, Your Honor, at page 7, quoted in part — our
main brief at page 7, Your Honor»
It is quite clear at this date that the Seventh
Amendment applies to the District of Columbia, and Capital
Traction vs. Hof, decided in 1899, this Court squarely held

10
that the Seventh Amendment was applicable to the District.
The question, then, is the standard to be applied
under the Seventh Amendment*
It is quite clear from various decisions of this
Court that the Seventh Amendment preserves the right to jury
trial, as it existed in England in 1791, at the time of the
adoption of the Bill of Rights,
Since 1830, this Court, in Parsons v. Bedford, and
subsequently and most recently in Ross v. Bernhard in 1970,
stated, that the test to be applied to determine the Seventh
/amendment right is to look to the closest historical counter­
part at common law» and determine there if the nature of the
issue to be resolved is legal and thus triable by jury.
In other xvords, the reference mu^t be to the right
asserted and the remedy sought and then to the actions in
England in 1791,
The test does not require that there be a precise
counterpart.

This was clearly pointed out.

It doesn't

matter if the statute, if the present-day action is embodied
in a statute.

I think the point there is it's quite obvious

that much of the common law has undergone an evolution, and
if any precise counterpart were required then certainly the
Seventh Zxmendment would be an anachronism.
Most of the recent cases involving the Seventh
Amendment, such as Beacon Theatres vs, Mestover, Dairy Queen

11

if. Wood and Ross v. Bernhard» have arisen as a result of the
merger of law and equity by way of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.
The problems of merger are not involved in this
case, because it’s never been suggested that a suit for
possession# such as the present one, was ever within the
jurisdiction of the court of equity.
It's quite clear that actions for possession of real
property present# perhaps# the classic case of actions tried
by juries at common law.
This Court# in Whitehead v. Shattuck and again
restated in Ross vr Bernhard# indicated that action seeking to
recover possession of real property are unmistakably legal
actions # and jury trial would thus be permitted.
At common law# since feudal times# there were several
actions available to determine the rights of possession.

Each

had to do with the particular circumstances of the case.
In our brief we deal with the three principal actions:

the

writ of assize of novel disseisin? the writ, of entry# and
the writ of ejectment,
These most closely —
QUESTION5

Ejectment# as I understand, it# or as I

remember it from law school# was an action to try title# and
forcible entry and detainer was an action to try the right
of possession.

This is the latter# isn’t it?

12
No issue of title is involved in -this case.
MR. BARNETT;

No issue of title is involved in this

case,
QUESTION:

Purely the issue of the right of

possession, wasn't it?
MR, BARNETT:

Purely the right of possesion, Your

Honor? right,
QUESTION: And as I remember that, that was tried
at common laitf by a justice of the peace, with twelve good
men and true, but who were not considered to be the equivalent
of a common lav; Seventh Amendment jury; isn't that correct?
HR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, I think that the —
Or am 1' — I'm going pretty far back,

I never had any practice in this, and I haven't thought about
it in a long time,
MR* BARNETT:

The forcible entry and detainer, which

you speak of, Your Honor, is not precisely the same thing as
what we have here.

What forcible entry and detainer is

today in the United States is not the same as it was in
England in 1791.
QUESTION: Well, I thought — but the point is. your
point is, isn't it, that whether or not the Seventh Amendment
right to jury is applicable depends upon the historical roots
of what this “*•
MR. BARNETT:

No question. Your Honor.

But our —

13
QUESTION:

~~ the District of Columbia action is,

MR, BARNETT:

Yes,, that is our point, Your Honor,

QUESTION: Right.
MR, BARNETT: And our point is that in England in
1791, which is the critical date for application of this
under —
QUESTION:

Right,

I1R. BARNETT:

Right,

— the Seventh Amendment, the forcible

entry and detainer actions were purely criminal actions, they
had nothing to do with the right to possession. They merely
punished a person who entered by force.
QUESTION: And those were justice of the peace actions,
weren't they?
MR, BARNETT:

They certainly were, Your Honor.

But justice of the peace —
QUESTION:

Not King's Bench actions, is that correct?

MR, BARNETT:

No, Your Honor.

Ejectment was tried

in the King's Bench, the assise of —
QUESTION;

Ejectment was to try title, .«isn't it?

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

I thought it was.

MR. BARNETT:
purely to try possession*

Ejectment, as it first evolved, was
In most of the cases which talk

about ejectment, it always says that the question in ejectment
is first the right to possession and then the right to title.

14

Title became

the reason title came into

ejectment is because the early title actions were very
complicated.

The courts, the King's Bench made it quite

easy for parties to try title in ejectment.
What happened, ejectment became the one form of
action to try possession around the 1700's.

During this

period it was the simplest action/ where anyone could try
either possession or title.
But there's no question but in 1791 they did try
possession- But the forcible entry and detainer actions did
not try possession* They merely restored a party who was
ousted by force back to possession, whether or not he had
a right to possession, and then they left the parties to
go their own way through the civil actions, to determine
their right to possession.
Another point, Your Honor, the justices of the
peace in England, in 1791, bear no correspondence to the
justices of the peace as we think of them today, or as they
existed in the District of Columbia in the early 1800's.
They were courts of record, they were held — they were
appointed by the King, they held grand juries, they tried
all cases involving felonies except treason.

In short,

they were just the correspondents of our modern criminal
courts.
There's no question that a right to jury trial

15

applied there, and we presume that the jury trial there was
much the same as we consider it today.
QUESTIONs Well, then you do say that that justice
of the peace, twelve men and true, was the equivalent of a
common lav; Seventh Amendment jury, do you?
MR. BARNETT:

I had thought —

We believe it was, Your Honor.

There's —
QUESTION:
school.

I thought I had learned otherwise in law

Maybe I was mistaught»
MR. BARNETT:

It's possible Your Honor is concerned

about the question of twelve men versus more than twelve,
questions of challenges to juries.

It's our understanding from

what the authorities say there is a problem here, that there
isn't a lot of information available.

We've attempted to

research all tine authorities, and the most that we can find
is that there was a jury trial and there was a jury trial in
the sense that v/e have a jury trial today.
QUESTION:

The — what is it, the Hof case?

MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

— held, that decision by this Court held

that a jury before the criminal justice of the peace here
in tiie District of Columbia was what, not a Seventh Amendment
jury, didn't it?
MR. BARNETT:

Yes, Your Honor. The basis for the

decision in Hof was the fact that the justice of the peace in

16
the District of Columbia did not have the power to instruct or
superintend the jury.

He was a man not learned in the law.

The base — the decision really was that it wasn't a court of
record.
What iiof said, essentially, was that — well, maybe
the premise should be laid in — between 1801 and 1864, the
justice of the peace court in the District, being the lowest
court, had exclusive jurisdiction over all eviction proceedings.
They had jury trials. The judge did not instruct them, the
jury merely decided the issue once the evidence was presented.
In 1899, long after this pericd of between 1801 and
1864, the Court, looking back, said that the justice of the
peace trials were not common law jury trials„
The court below attempted to rely on that as a
break in the history of the right to jury trial.

But there's

no question that Congress didn't intend that these be jury
trials.

The courts in the District had always thought that

the justice of the peace jury trials were common law jury
trials.
Today the entire problem doesn't exist, since we
have available a court which can give a constitutional jury
trial*
The point that we have made, Your Honor, I believe
is the fact that the three common law actions which we cite,
assize, entry, and ejectment, were the principal actions to

17
try the right to possession, and those actions were prevailing
in 1791, the critical date for the Seventh Amendment.

And,

therefore, today we should be — we should have a jury trial
on those, on the action in the statutory proceeding.
Much has been said by the respondents in the amicus
curiae about the fact that the proceeding that we have is a
summary proceeding.

The argument there is that the summary

proceeding is inconsistent with the right to jury trial.
They rely very heavily on this Court’s decision in Lindsey v.
Mormet.
In Lindsey, it was held that the State of Oregon
did not violate the equal protection or due process clauses
of the Fourteenth Amendment by restricting the issues which
could be raised in an eviction proceeding.
The law of the District of Columbia, as we’ve noted,
however, permits a tenant to defend a suit for nonpayment on
tire basis of a breach of warranty.

Moreover, it also permits

the counterclaims to be filed in the same proceeding.

It's

not a summary proceeding in the sense of the Oregon case.
But even, notwithstanding that,Oregon itself permits
a jury trial in a far more summary proceeding than we have here
in the District.

The term "summary" only applies to a

shortened or simplified procedure, such as restricting the
litigable issues, short return dates, unnecessary responsive
pleadings, and limited discovery)'.

10

The historians generally agree that assise of novel
disseisin and entry were equally as summary as the present-day
eviction statutes»

The point is -- my answer, I'm sorry.

The

122,000 figure really is meaningless, because 97 percent of
those cases are ended at the threshold.

They are either

obvious that the landlords use the Landlord and Tenant Courts

QUESTION:

I specially don't think you need to put

that much time on the word "summary", because I think we know
what "summary" means,
HR. BARNETT:

All right#

One other point I think that is quite important is
the practicabilities and limitations of jurors, which the Court

referred to in the Ross vs. Bernhard — the Court noted there
that this may have a consideration on toe applicability of
the Seventh Amendment right.
Hie present action presents, perhaps, the best
example of a case suitable for jury determination.

As I
They,

A term very

They can apply their common

experience and their common sense to such a problem.
It's judged in terms of the local housing code,
which requires things like sanitary and safe conditions,
adequate heat and hot water.

The suitability is certainly

amplified in light of the highly complex commercial
disputes xtoich are routinely submitted tojuries in antitrust
matters or trademark infringements and the like.
Also I think it's important to note that the social
consequences of an eviction are very serious, perhaps the
harshest of any civil remedy*

It results in eviction of toe

tenant; his family is thrown in the street*
Certainly this may be equally severe to a criminal
conviction, and the use of a jury is certainly appropriate
in such a proceeding.
If I may reserve —
QUESTIONs

Do you suppose that even if you shouldn’t

prevail upon your historic argument, your basic constitutional

argument., that you could still make an argument that Congress
intended — Congress intended that there be a jury trial,
•that there's, therefore, an implicit statutory right to a jury
trial here, whatever the constitutional or common law right
may or may not have been?
In other words, —
HR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

Yes, I see

— as I understand it, there always was a

statutory right until 1970, and in 1970, in the reorganization
of the courts here in the District of Columbia, that language
was omitted, but that the clear legislative history shows
that the reason it was omitted is that Congress thought it
wasn't necessary, that, it was,to use the words of the committee
report, superfluous.
And don’t you think you could make an argument that
there’s a statutory right to a jury, regardless of whether
you’re right or wrong on your historic and constitutional
analysis?
HR, BARNETT:

I’m not quite sure. Your Honor, because

the statute itself was repealed.

It's clear that Congress

didn't intend to repeal the —
QUESTION:

But it’s very clear that Congress — is it

not, or am I mistaken?

—■ that Congress thought it was

unnecessary —
HR. BARNETT;

Congress thought ~~ right.

22

QUESTION:

— and that Congress intended to give

a right to a jury.
MR. BARNETT:
QUESTION:

There is no question, Your Honor.
But isn't it more accurate to say that

Congress thought the Constitution gave a right to a jury?
MR, BARNETT: Well, that's what they said, Your Honor,
They specifically stated that we consider it superfluous,
in light of the Constitutional right,
I think another important point is that, irrespec­
tive of the possessory action, we. would have been entitled
to a jury trial on our counterclaims as a result of the
Beaeon-Dairy Queen doctrine.
As I indicated, the issues overlap, there may be
serious questions of collateral estoppel and the like.
If I may reserve the rest of my time.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Barnett.

Mr, Miller.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERMAN MILLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT.
MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the

Court:
In connection with this particular question, I might
say that the statute was repealed in 1970? the statute was
passed by Congress in 1921.
When the District of Columbia took the Maryland law,

23
in 1899, they took it as a start in that particular time»
And the question about forcible entry and detainer was a
modern method, then, to get possession.
ejectment actions.

They had, of course,

But most of the time they used the

forcible entry and detainer.
This was not a jury trial, becatise it was referred
to two justicies of the peace, or commissioners, who had no
right to instruct the jury, had no right to grant a new trial,
or tell the jury what the law was.
Now, this continued on until 1964, when a statute
was passed giving the Supreme Court at that time a right to
hear these cases de novo, and a jury trial in the Supreme
Court, if there 'was a loss in the justice of the peace court.
QUESTIONS
MR. MILLER!
QUESTION:
MR. MILLER:

What year was that, Mr. Miller?
In 1964 — I’m sorry, 1864.
1864, yes.
How, this continued on until the Hof

case was decided, where a comprehensive discussion and review
of the historical situation was made by Mr. Justice Gray.
And it was held at that time that the justice of the peace
was not a comon lav; court, it was not a court of law, because
of the fact I’ve just mentioned, and decided that since the
second part of the amendment said that no facts should be
reviewed by another court,

The issue in that case was whether

there was a review of the facts in the Supreme Court, and it

24
was held that where there was a hearing or trial before a
justice of the peace, this was not a common lavz action and
therefore v/as not a review.
This went on, as I said, until 1921, with the
demurrer proceedings„

Now, it was then when there was a

reorganization of the court, and the Municipal Court came
into being, giving the right and power to pass on slander
and tort actions, and so forth, that they passed the law
to state that a jury trial would be had in cases involving
possession»
It was almost a repetition of the Seventh Amendment.
All the language of the Seventh Amendment was there, plus
"in all actions involving possession".
So Congress gave the court the right to hear cases
involving possession v/ith a jury trial*

Then took it away

in 1970*
Congress having the power to give it had certainly
the power to take it away.
And whatever may be the reason, it was taken away,
the fact is there's no more jury trials in Landlord and
Tenant cases*
Now, I might say in that same connection that
although there is some attempt to show an analogy with respect
to ejectment, the ejectment statute is still on the books.
It's a cumbersome method.

It requires a number of elements

25

to be shown before you can have a judgment»

You have to show

title, you also have to give the tenant a right to redeem
in six months, and causes a lot of damage and a lot of harm.
So there's no similarity between that and ejectment™
With respect to the other two, has to do with the
justice of the peace, you still couldn't get any common law
trial before a justice of the peace, because they were not a
court#
Now, we got the statute in nineteen —
QUESTION:

But you could get it on a trial de novo.

MR# MILLER:

You could have it on a trial de novo ~

QUESTION: So you had a right eventually to a jury
trial.

Well, in that connection, that was

to hear jury trials for actions —

Do you think there was a constitutional

with the procedure that was then employed?
MR* MILLER:

IJo.

Because of the number of cases

an action could be had -—
QUESTION:

Well, there was a common law court cn

appeal, on trial de novo.
MR. MILLER:
1364.

This was a statutory proceeding, in

It never existed before that particular date.

So

therefore it couldn't have been in existence in England in
1739, when the matter first came to the attention of the
District of Columbia*
So I don't see how they could say that you had a
jury trial at that particular time as a result of legislation
and not common law.

There wa3 no common law right to it.

Because the Hof case said there was no common law proceeding
in such a proceeding.

And the only kind of a jury trial

you could have is before the commissioners,

v/ho merely drew

tiie twelve men, and had no right to instruct the jury or
otherwise.
Now, in 1921, as I say, the right was given to the
Municipal Court, and then it was taken away.
Now, v?ith respect to the second point made by the

27
petitioner, that because he has filed a counterclaim,
recruitment and setoff, this gives him a right to a jury
trial»

Of course, if that is so, that would be present in

every one of these 122,000 cases? such a claim could be made
in that, and deprive the landlord of his property while ‘the
tenant litigates what he claims to be his rights.

As

criticized by this Court in the Normet case„„
The Normet case said that the landlord shouldn't be
required to stand by while he litigates those things, and
when you go into that particular branch of the procedure, it
will be discovery and all kinds of reasons for delay,
Hy experience has been

and I guess I've had more

landlord and tenant cases than anybody in this city — that
these ■— when we did have a jury right under 13702, the jury
claim was made and interposed merely for delay.

Because

practically every one of the cases resulted in a tenant moving
out, owing four or five months' rent, or a settlement of some
kind.
And as I am informed by the Clerk, out of 600~somsodd cases where jury demands were made, there were only six
that were tried in the last year before the abolition of
the jury system by this particular case#
Now, it was also shown, and it seems to me that the
creation of the right to claim the money for violations of the
housing regulations in Javins was never recognized by the

23

Javins case as a legal claim.

It was purely an equitable

claim.
And on page 19 of the amicus curiae brief, there's a
recital by Judge Wright as to what had happened with respect
to the doctrine.

And it concludes by this languages

"A remedy for every wrong not cognizable by
courts of law, and the complexities of the present social
order have brought about conditions which were unknown when
the English courts of Equity were established."
It was realized and the lower court's decision was
on the basis that when a claim of this type is made, it is
purely equitable, because in the cited case, Molyneaux vs»
Town House, the claim for nonpayment of rent is made, and
if a tenant can show he paid the rent, or he had a right to
pay it, this would give him a right to equitable conversion,
and have his tenancy reestablished.
In other words, it was purely a suit as to whether
the rent was due.

If the rent was due, he, the, tenant, had a

right to tender all the rent and that would reinstate the
tenancy*
So that was all purely equitable, and the defense
of recruitment and counterclaim were considered by the lower
court as being purely equitable in nature, and therefore not
triable by a jury; and therefore the Dairy Queen case has no
application, because there the issues were legal and equitable,

29

■and here they are purely equitable.
To show., with respect to a jury trial, the summary
action would be destroyed completely*

The Code Title 15,

15-1501, makes the complaint returnable in seven clear days.
It is only necessary, if you cannot find

the defendant, to

post the summons on the door.
Ilr. Hiller, I understand your opponent's

QUESTION;

contention to be that this really isn't a summary action in
the classic sense of the word, that the rule itself allows
the pleading of these defenses.
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MILLER:
5.

You mean Rule 5?

Well, I have some difficulty with Rule

Although it's not mentioned in my brief, it does not do

complete justice.

It's recited that Rule 3 allows

a landlord

to ask for a personal money judgment if the tenant makes a
claim for .recruitment set out in a counterclaim.
But in footnote No. 64 in the Jayins case, it has been
said that if the tenant caused the damage, then this will not
be a defense of the landlord's claim.
Now, if the tenant caused the damage, the landlord
has the right of action for that damage.

He can't make it in

this particular claim, because there's no provision in the
rule.

Then he's got to file his own independent action to

make his claim, while the tenant goes ahead with Us claim,

30

and it's highly unfair, it seems to me.
In order to have a clue process situation, all the
claims should have to be litigated in one particular action.
And this cannot, be done under Rule 5(c),

unless ~-

QUESTIONs Well, you don't challenge Rule 5(c), do you,
as being governing in a case like this, unless there's a
constitutional impediment to it?
MR. MILLER:

I say that that may be interposed,

but not in a jury trial; instead of enlarge the remedy to a
jury trial*.

The tenant may file these kinds of claims in

the particular action, have a court trial, and if he can show
by these defenses that there is no rent due, the case of the
landlord falls*

That would be the end of it.

But to litigate these kinds of things to a full-blown
action of law would destroy the summary nature of the
proceeding.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Barnett.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN C. BARNETT, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR* BARNETT:

Your Honors:

Just briefly, I'd like to reply to a question that
Mr» Justice Stewart had asked earlier regarding the twelve
men good and true on the juries which existed at common law.
I think that I failed to indicate the fact that this
Court has certainly recognised the fact that the jury system

31

has been evolving for centuries»

The point being that the

Seventh Amendment doesn't protect the procedural incidence
of a jury trial, it merely protects the substance.

And it’s

quite clear that the substance of jury trial in 1791 was
quite the same as it is today.
As we have traced the history, perhaps maybe too far
back to the Eleventh, Twelfth Century, of course we have to
realize that juries were undergoing a change during that time,
and this was when juries were first being formulated,
Mr, Miller's argument appears to be directed at
what occurred after 1791,
there.

The Uof case, most of the problems

Anything occurring after 1791 appears to be irrelevant

for the jury determination.
The Ross test seems to be clear, that we have to look
to the common lav; of England in 1791,
In Hof, I think it's important to show that the
mistake that was made, that the courts and everyone in the
District of Columbia thought that the justice of the peace
jury trials were common law jury trials.

They tried debt

actions over twenty dollars.
Their jurisdiction, their exclusive jurisdiction
was up to fifty dollars, I believe, at some point during that
time.
Mr, Miller has also indicated that the •—» for some
reason the tenants are going to file counterclaims in the

32

122,000 cases.

This is really unrealistic.

It's quite clear that jury trials are not demanded
except in a very few cases*

As he indicated, himself, only

eight trials occurred in 1971, eight jury trials.

I -think

seventeen cases went to jury and nine settled before the jury
rendered a verdict.
QUESTION:

He said six hundred demands were made

for dilatory purposes.
MR* BARNETT;

Yes, Your Honor*

Well, of course,

he characterized this as a dilatory purpose.

It’s quite

obvious that in landlord and tenant cases, like any other case,
where jury demands are filed, that most cases settle.

The

trial problems, attorneys not hciving time to go to trial,
this type of problem*
And the parties just wanting to settle.

These

cases settle much easier than the normal civil actions.
The question of dilatoriness is certainly in Mr.
Miller's characterization.

In fact, the landlord is quite

adequately protected in these proceedings because of this
protective procedure which Judge Wright set out in the Javins
decision and later amplified in another case, Bell vs.
Tsintolas Realty.
That procedure permits the landlord, or requires
the tenant to put into the registry of the court the pending
rent during the — the rent pending the proceeding, until the

33
trial date comes up.

Certainly v?hat the landlord is seeking

in these cases is the rent, and of course as long as he’s
protected, the court has hold of the money in an escrow
account, which it can disburse at the end of the case, he's
fully protected.
So it's certain now that the backlog doesn’t
affect the landlord.

If there is a backlog at all»

In 1971 the Chief Judge of the Superior Court issued
a ruling whereby jury trials in landlord and tenant cases
were to take place three weeks after the return date, within
three x-zeeks after the return date.
QUESTION: What if the tenant fails to put the money
into escrow in a given month, what consequences befall him?
NR. BARNETT:

Judgment would be rendered for the

landlord*
QUESTION:

In effect a default judgment on the

landlord's complaint?
HR. BARNETT:

Yes, Your Honor*

As I indicated, the Chief Judge had imposed a threeweek linit on jury trials.

This is at the time when the

question -was in dispute, before the decision of the court
below.
In practice today, judge trials in the landlord and
tenant court are backlogged anywhere from four to six weeks.
So the delay argument, the dilatoriness, I think really means

no tiling.
Finally, I’d like to conclude, Your Honor, just by
noting that the historical lineage in this case being so
clear, and Mr* Miller certainly hasn’t shown us anything that
takes away from that, and the Court has, on numerous occasions,
indicated that all possible doubts regarding the Seventh
Amendment should be resolved in favor of a jury trial.
Thank you.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted*
[Whereupon, at 10:54 o'clock, a.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
