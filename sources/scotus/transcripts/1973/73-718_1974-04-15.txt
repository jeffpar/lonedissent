MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll hear argument

first tills morning in No. 73-718, Bangor Punta Operations
against Bangor & Aroostook Railroad.
Mr. Ryan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES V. RYAN, ESQ.,
ON BEIIALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. RYAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Courti
This case is before; the Court on a writ of
certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit.
I represent the petitioner-defendants, Bangor Punta
Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary? Bangor Punta
is a publicly held manufacturing concern.
The respondent-plaintiffs, the Bangor & Aroostook
Railraod and its wholly owned subsidiary? the Bangor s Aroo­
stook Railroad operates a railraod whose trackage is
exclusively within the State of Maine.
The issue before this Court today is:

May an un­

injured party, by using the device of the corporate form, or
claiming to vindicate an inchoate

public interest, maintain

an action in the federal court?
Now, this action was commenced by the filing of
a complaint in She District Court in Maine in December of
1971.

Although the complaint contains thirteen causes of

4
actionj allegedly based on violations of the Securities laws,
the antitrust laws, Maine statutes, and the common law,
essentially it’s based upon four intercompany transactions,
which occurred between Iiangor Punta, the petitioner here,
and tiie Bangor & Aroostook Railroad, the nominal plaintiff
here, while Bangor Punta —■ while the Bangor & Aroostook
Railroad was a 98 percent owned subsidiary of Bangor Punta.
Although tlie claims, as I say, allege various
violations of federal statutes, as Judge Gignoux in the District
Court stated or properly characterized them, they are claims
V7hich are typical stockholders' claims, seeking an accounting
for alleged misappropriation and waste of corporate assets
by controlling shareholders.
Now, after the filing of the complaint and the
filing of the answer, the petitioner, Bangor Punta, moved for
summary judgment based upon the admissions in the complaint.
The District Court, on settled principles of law,
granted the motion, and held that the nominal plaintiff here,
the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad Company, and the real party
in interest here?, Amoskeag Corporation,

which purchased the

99 percent owned interest of Bangor Punta in the Bangor &
Aroostook Railroad, are barred from maintaining this action.
On appeal to the First Circuit, this decision was
unanimously reversed.

Although the First Circuit agreed with

the District Court and said that these are essentially stock-

holders’ claims, and in a normal corporate situation a
dismissal would have been proper, in this case, because a
railroad was involved, which the Court of Appeals characterised
as being a public or quasi-public corporation, a separate
inchoate, undefined interest of the public

was involved.

This interest of the ptibli'c, which was held, stated
to be an. interest in the financial health of the BAR,
provided a legally recognisable separate interest, which was
served by this action.
QUESTION;

Mr, Ryan, do you mean the Court of

Appeals holding is applicable to the State law counts, as
well as to the federal question?
MR. RYAN;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

To both?

MR. RYAN;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

Is there any Maine law that supports

MR, RYAN;

Yes, sir.

that?

QUESTION;

In the

That supports the holding of the Court

of Appeals?
MR. RYAN:
Appeals.

Oh, no, sir.

No, not the holding of the Court of
Excuse me, I misundersfood your

complaint — your question.
No.

The main court said that this action could be

maintained, even the State court claims, because of this

6
separable interest,, and there is no Maine law which supports
that proposition.
As Judge Gignoux noted in his opinion, the BAR did
not claim in its complaint that there was any public interest
or any rights of any creditors involved in this action.

Nor

did the BAR, before the Court of Appeals, indicate that they
were suing to vindicate any specific public interest.

Even

before this Court, they da not allege or state that they are
vindicating any specific public interest.
What they say is, is that a railroad is a public
asset.

And because a railroad is a public asset, the normal

rules of law do not apply to the situation in this case.
the facts are simple.

In 1360 the Bangor &

Aroostook Railroad Corporation caused the predecessor in
interest of Bangor Punta to be formed, and then, by a
registered exchange offer, the shareholders of the railroad
became the shareholders of the parent company.

This was the

holding company trend which was the vogue in railroads during
the late Fifties and early Sixties.
So that at the end of the transaction, the railroad
became a 99 percent subsidiary of the parent holding company.
The actions which the complaint are based on, and
which the complaint claims are unlawful, all occurred between
1960 and 1967.

And, as Judge Gignoux stated, they are

essentially claims of corporate waste, that a controlling

7

shareholder mismanaged the assets of a wholly owned subsidiary.
Now, on October 2nd, 1969,, the Bangor Punt a sold
its 99 percent interest in the BAR to Amoskeag, which is again
a public corporation with public stockholders, the interest
in the railroad for five million dollars in cash.
In December of 1971, this lawsuit was started.
Nov;, as -the District Court pointed out, there are
three ~ four, really, controlling facts which are dispositive
of this case.
First of ail, the real party here, the real party in
interest is Amoskeag.

Amoskeag owns 99 percent of this

railroad, and they are not claiming to be suing to vindicate
the seven-tenths of one percent, or private shareholders.
No. 1.
No. 2, Amoskeag does not claim that it was defrauded,
or it was misled by anything that Bangor Punta stated, or
that it got less than it paid.

Amoskeag purchased the stock

from the wrongdoer long — alleged wrongdoer —•• after the
acts occurred, and does not state that it suffered any
specific injury.
What it is attempting to do by this action is
obtain a windfall.

It is suing to recover its purchase price

of five million dollars, plus an additional two million dollars
windfall, and still keep the railroad.
state that it was injured./7

And yet it doesn't

How, based upon

! QUESTION;

But the action is brought in the name

of the corporation, not in the name of Amoskeag.

You say

that Amoskeag is the real party in interest, but ordinarily
you don’t look behind a corporate plantiff to see who the
stockholders are in order to determine who the real party in
interest is, do you?
MR. RYAN:

I think idle answer to that is yes, and.

generally that's so. The corporation is a legal person for
purposes of maintaining suits, owning property, and doing
various acts.
However, in this case here, the claims are
essentially stockholder claims, essentially equitable
claims.

And if you do not
QUESTION:
MR. RYAN:

Why do you say that?
Why?

— Well, it's difficult for me

to understand how one can say that a 99 percent shareholder
or, in effect, you can violate rules of law regarding a
subsidiary, persons could be injured.

In other words, if

there were a creditor here, or if there was some other person
who claims injury, then I would say that you can't look behind
the corporate form.

But that's not this case.

QUESTION: Then what you're really saying is that
this — whatever Bangor Punta did to the railroad at the time
it owned 99 percent of the stock really wasn't actionable on

9

the part of the railroad, even then.
MR. RYAN:

Correct, Your Honor.

Correct.

Exactly.

Because it is itself a subsidiary.
QUESTION;

Mr. Ryan, who were the parties that were

really wronged here, the former shareholders?
MR. RYAN;

The seven-tenths of one percent.

You

see, Bangor Punta owned, in effect, 99 percent.
QUESTION;

Have they ever instituted any kind of an

action at all?
MR. RYAN:

No, sir.

QUESTION: Would the situation be different in your
view if Amoskeag owned only 75 percent of the stock?
MR. RYAN;

It could be 'the same, it could be

different, depending upon the facts.

I don’t think you can

make a categorical statement -that the result would be the.
same.

I'm inclined to think in this specific case, Your Honor,

it would be the same, it would be like the Matthews vs.
Headley case, which I have cited in my brief.

Where you can

by •— there is no question here that if there is a recovery
here of the seven million dollars, that Amoskeag has received
a windfall.

There's no doubt about that.

QUESTION: Something would depend on when the other
25 percent had acquired their stock, wouldn't it, in answer to
Mr. Justice Blackmun's question?
MR. RYAN;

It could, if they acquired their stock

1.0

after the events, they would have tine same disability that
Amoskeag would have, but I would assume 111 at -QUESTION:

Assume —

MR. RYAN:

Yes.

QUESTION: *— to the contrary.
MR. RYAN:

That's right.

QUESTION: But if Bangor Punta had been only a 75
percent owner, rather than a 99 percent owner at the time
this thing was going on, then conceivably the other 25 percent
might have a very legitimate claim.
MR. RYAN:

Oh, absolutely.

Certainly.

Certainly,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And that would be a typical minority

stockholder suit, would it not?
MR. RYAN: That's correct, Your Honor. That's correct.
QUESTION: And it would not accrue to the benefit of
the railroad, or would it?
MR. RYAN:

It could.

Had they ~~
It would depend upon what the

result would be when they're framing the relief.

If the

relief would result in what has been characterized in the cases
as an unjustifiable windfall, well, then, a court of equity
in the derivative action would be able to frame a decree
accordingly.

It would depend upon the facts of the

specific case.
I don't think you can make a blanket rule.

But

11

certainly in this case, where you have 99 percent, there’s
no question that there's a windfall here, and there’s no
question that a court could frame a decree in this case.
Now, as I say, that if you eliminate the public
interest or claimed public interest which I’ll deal with,
next, then it seems that the reasoning of Judge

Gignoux,

which was really agreed to by the First Circuit, that in
the ordinary corporate case the dismissal of Judge Gignoux
would have been sustained.
Amoskeag from

Rule 23.1 would have prevented

suing itself, and that the general equitable

principles prevent Amoskeag, through the guise of the
corporate form, to maintain this action, on behalf of itself.
QUESTION;

Certainly Rule 23.1 by its terms has

no bearing on this action, does it?
MR. RYAN:

Only if -- if Amoskeag sued —

QUESTION;

Yes, but Amoskeag didn't sue.

MR. RYAN: That’s correct.

public interest involved.

Unless there's some other

12
How, what is this public interest which is where
the First Circuit departed from Judge Gignoux?
The First Circuit says that there is an
not easily d.efinied or quantified inchoate interest in the
public --- in the financial health of railroads, and that this
interest is the basis for maintaining this action.
The respondents go even further and they say that a
railroad is a public asset.
Well, Your Honor, we submit that a railroad is a
private business corporation with certain clearly defined
public duties and obligations.

The Congress, through the

Interstate Commerce Act and various legislation over* the last
fifty or sixty years,has clearly defined those areas in which
there are — the interests of the public are covered.

And

there is also some residual minor common law responsibilities
of railroads.
There is no claim in this complaint or anywhere in
the briefs that Bangor Punta violated any of these statutory
rules or regulations regarding railroads.

On the contrary,

the Interstate Commerce Commission acknowledges that there is
apparently a gap in this regulation, and this gap is what
they're asking this Court to really permit a court to rectify,
to cure.
Now, this gap — what is this gap?

This gap is that

a holding company in the late Fifties and early Sixties, holding

13

companies were formed and operated railroads as wholly owned
subsidiaries; and this, as of course everybody is familiar with
Penn Central, that was not very successful.

But we had other

successful ones, Union Pacific, Chessie, 'there are a number
til at did work out.
Now, first of all, in this case, there is no
allegation in this complaint that the Bangor & Aroostook can
barely survive.

On the contrary, the Bangor & Aroostook is

a viable railroad, it is earning money, it is paying
dividends, it is paying off its debt.

It's one of the only-

railroads in the northeast, or really probably east of the
Mississippi other than the Chessie, that is still paying
dividends.
So it's hardly a railroad which has suffered the
depredation of a pirate who has looted it.
Secondly, over the last sixty years Congress has
repeatedly addressed itself to railroads* operation, public
interest in railroads, it has provided numerous remedies,
not only by administrative but also by private actions, in
the event the administrative forces do not indemnify somebody
who can prove he has been injured under one of the statutory
requirenent s.
And this is not covered, as is conceded by the ICC
and by the respondents.
Nov/, is it for this Court to create this remedy?

We say no.

This

the railroad is a regulated

industry, highly regulated industry, and it sho\ild not be for a
court to provide nex\? remedies beyonw what Congress says are
really in the public interest»
But thirdly, and more importantly, this very —■ and
I'll call it a problem of parents, the parent companies,
holding companies with subsidiary railroads has been the
subject of congressional hearings, and there is presently
pending legislation in progress which addresses itself to this
problem.
How, should this Court step forward and go ahead of
Congress?

Congress has this very problem, before it.
How, it's interesting to note that even with the

legislation in front of Congress, which has been there for
four years, and. hasn't been enacted, so perhaps this problem
of holding companies is not quite as severe or as evil as
some people would like to contend, they have enacted it.
This specific legislation doesn't even cover our
situation here.

Because the legislation provides that before

the ICC can intervene, the service to the public in Maine from
tiie BAR has to he threatened, and there is no allegation here
and there can be no allegation here that anything that my
client did threatened the public service.
So that when you come all the way back down to what's
really on the bottom line, it is that the re really isn't an

15
identifiable public interest which can be injured, which
can give rise to jurisdiction or standing in a federal court.
Now, when you get past that point, you cone to the
really — the really bottom line, is that Amoskeag here has
not been injured.

It has not suffered any injury.

It's

this general public somewhere that may have suffered an injury.
But it has not suffered an injury.

It is not a proper party

plaintiff.
Someone out there may be able to maintain an action,
but it’s not the Amoskeag through the device of the corporate
form.
Now, they argue, Your honor, that, Well, they can
frame a decree and that if there's a recovery here that there's
going to be some public benefit, because some of the money
might stick in the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad.

Well, of

course, that's really, as the Court of Appeals recognized,
really can't be donei it's absurd.

Cash is fungible.

If you put cash into a corporation, it can come
out the other end in all kinds of ways, as long as it's
solvent.

If it's solvent it can legally, as any business

corporation, pay dividends.

And until somebody says that a

solvent corporation can't pay dividends, then how are you
going to stop the money from coming out?
True, you could probably put a district judge in
there to run this railroad for tv?enty years, and somehow put

IS
all the stops in, but that's certainly not something that a
court should do, particularly when the railroad is solvent.
For that reason, Your Honor, we feel that -this case

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, Ryan,

Mr. Lefkowitz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN L. 1EFK0WITZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
As we view the case, there are two questions
involved in this litigation.
is this in the first place?

The first is:

Whose lawsuit

Is it the railroad's lawsuit or

is it Amoskeag's lawsuit, the present controlling stockholder?
I think the record is clear, and I will highlight
it in just a moment, that it is indeed the railroad's lawsuit.
The second question is:

Assuming that it is the

railroad's lawsuit, if the railroad makes a substantial
recovery in the lawsuit, will this inure to the benefit of its
present controlling stockholder, Amoskeag, in such a way that
the windfall, in quotes, that Amoskeag may enjoy outweight
the benefits of committing the railroad to right the wrongs
which have been done?
QUESTION;

Who else would get the benefits of

this windfall, if it's the railroad —-

17
MR. LEFKOWITZs

The public, I believe, is trie

interest which the First Circuit found would benefit from
this.
QUESTION;
little bit?

Just how? Would you enlarge on that a

IIow is the public going to get some benefit out

of it?
MR. LEFKOWITZs

Yes, sir, I’m glad to.

I think the

record well illustrates the fact that the present owners of
the railroad, Amoskeag, are engaged in the process of
developing a Northern New England Rail System.

Amoskeag

presently owns 35 percent of the Maine Central Railroad
stock, which is held in a voting trust.
It owns 99 percent of the Bangor & Aroostook stock.
It is the largest single holder of the first mortgage bonds
of the Boston & Maine Railroad, presently

in reorganisation.

What Amoskeag is trying to do, subject to the
supervision of the Commission, is to put together a Northern
New England System which, I suggest at least on the face of
it, solves some of the problems of the railroads by unifying
a number of short carriers to build into the larger system
which may be in fact coming out of Con Rail.
QUESTION; Would they have any legal obligation to
dedicate this windfall to that ~~
MR, LEFKOWITZs

It may not have any legal obligation,

I can say to this Court that I know that they have a moral

18

obligation, and I believe that properly supervised by the
District Court with an imaginative decree, that those funds
could be available.

Indeed, as we suggested in our brief,

Amoskeag and the railroad are both prepared to enter into
some kind of meaningful order by a District Court, should
there be a recovery in this case, so that those funds could
be used, let’s say, for the system or, if not for the system,
to be put into maintenance of way and maintenance of equipment
to build a stronger railroad which can better serve the public.
True, as my brother states, it doesn’t look as though
the Bangor & Aroostook is in any problems, that may be because
good management took care of this after the railroad was sold.
And I think if you look in the Appendix to our brief, on the
report of the Bureau of Accounts, you will see some indica­
tion. of the beneficial management of this railroad.
QUESTION: Am I correct, Mr. Lefkowitz, the First
Circuit however imposed no such condition as to the use of
funds?
MR. LEFKOWITZ: They strongly suggested that it could
be they did not because I think they were leaving that, Mr.
Justice Blackmun, to the District Court, if there should be a
recovery.
The brief itself, as I said, indicates that the
railroad and Amoskeag would be amenable to such a decree,
because -the Dumaine family is interested in railroads.

19

QUESTION;

But much of the holding of the Court of

Appeals! is a disagreement with Judge Gignoux on Maine law,
MR. LEFKOWITZ: As I understand it, really vary
little.

I think the main part of tine Court of Appeals

holding goes to the heart of the separate identifiable
interest of the public in the railroad, as contrasted with
the interest of only its controlling stockholder,
QUESTIONj

And that’s in no respect the Maine lav/?

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

That has

that is supported by

Maine law. There is also a case which we cite in our brief ,
bells Beach Casino, which states in effect that Rule 23,
the equivalent of Rule 23 can be suspended, and it will be
suspended in Maine in order to allow suits where there are
equitable considerations involved, such as here.
So I believe that Maine lav/ is as strong, if not
stronger, than federal law in allowing this case, based
on the Nells Beach Casino case.
QUESTION; Well, do you concede that the propriety
of Judge Gignoux's ruling, if this were the Alpha Delta
Widget Company rather than a railroad?
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

I think that, ans I've thought a

lot about, this, I think that I would have to say to you if
it were a mom-and-pop corporation or a widget company such
as you’re suggesting, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that in
those circumstances I would have to say we are not —- this

20
case would not support that because of the strong public
interest that is involved with the railroad, and probably not
a strong public interest involved with a widget company»
Bangor & Aroostook Railroad is a public utility
under the lav? of the State of Maine, it's completely regulated
as a utility.

It is completely regulated by the Interstate

Commerce Commission.

We are dealing with a — it seems to me

we're dealing with the easiest case under these circumstances.
This is the so-called private corporation, which it is,
but this is the private corporation which is probably more
regulated than, any other private corporation.
Why?
corporation.

Because of the public interest in this
And it's that separate identifiable public

interest which the First Circuit found gave this case a
different fc re atment.
QUESTION:

Under Maine law are their dividends

regulated in any way?
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

As far as I know, not in — except

in the usual course, which is that they can impair capital.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

But —

QUESTION: There's no other — no other —*
MR, LEFKOWITZ:

There’s no other regulation under

Maine law —
QUESTIONs

Not the kind of regulation you would have

21

over an electric utility, for example, on requiring that they
put their earnings back into reduced rates.
MR. LEFKOWITZ;

Not that I know of, sir, under

Maine lav;.
On tine other hand, I think Maine lav; and Federal
law both suggest that the amount that can be earned by a
regulated company, such as this, is limited by the amount of
rates they can charge, and that there is an underlying public
policy that you ought not to be able to take these regulated
earnings and stick them upstairs and have them produce
unregulated earnings for you.
QUESTION:

fir. Lefkowitz, even as to the federal

Courts, Securities and Exchange /vet and such, is it your
view that, independently of Maine law, there’s a federal law
that's applicable?
MR. LEPKOWITZ:

Yes, sir.

Very much so. And we’ve

tried to point that out in our brief.
First of all, I'd say that the federal counts we're
talking about under Section 10b of the 1934 Act, and under
the Antitrust Acts, Clayton Act section 10, are strong
indications of public policy which should be vincidated.
QUESTION;

Well, even if Maine lav; were to disagree

with the Court of Appeals, you'd still say that the Court of
Appeals would be right as to the counts which were from the
federal law?

22

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Federal counts?

Yes, sir.

And 1

think that the use of Rule 23—~
QUESTION;

One other thing, Mr. Lefkowitz, Maine,

I see, is one of the States that's adopted a certification
sfatufce, has n' t it?
MR. LEFKOWITZ:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir,

Permits the federal courts to ask the

Maine Supreme Court what is Maine law.
MR, LEFKOWITZ:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,

Was it ever suggested to the First

Circuit that perhaps as to the Maine law counts, at least,
that there ought to he that certification here?
MR. LEFKOWITZs

No, sir, it was not suggested as to

those, although I believe the First Circuit decision rested
mainly on the federal counts.
QUESTION: Well, that's ray difficulty with it.

But

you've got thirteen counts here, of which I think five at
least are State law counts on conversion basis only, aren't
they?
MR. LEFKOWITZ;

That is, on conversion basically,

the counts are on the —
QUESTION;

You hare a Maine public utilities law,

you have two or three common law counts, which I gather must
mean Maine common law.
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Yes, sir.

23

No,

those were not passed upon, but I believe that

the Wells Beach —
QUESTION:

Don’t you think this is the sort of

thing, to the extent that it turns on Maine law, that we
ought to ask, that the Court of Appeals might have asked the
Maine Suprema Court what the Maine lav/ is?
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

As to those counts under Maine

law for conversion and violation of the statute under Maine
law, quite possibly the Court of Appeals could have asked
•that.

But I think -- again we're getting away from, the main

aspects of this case, which is that this is the railroad
suing to right the wrongs that was done to it.
When we start talking, as Mr. Ryan does, about
Rule 23.1 and about standing to sue before this Court, we’re
really talking about the second question that I was — said
I would address myself to.

And that is, what are you supposed

to do if in fact a windfall inures to the benefit of Amoskeag
in this case?
And I think there you have the question, and the
First Circuit dealt with it by saying that it. was a public
interest involved, the question of?

Do you punish the

wrongdoer for* statutory violations of federal law and of State
lav;, or do you let the wrongdoer go scot-free, as it were,
because of the fact that there may be a windfall to the
present controlling stockholder?

24

QUESTION: And innocent.
MR. LEFKOWXTZs

Yes, sir, the present innocent

controlling stockholder, Mr. Justice White.
There's no question about that 'this present stock­
holder didn't participate at all in what was done prior to
the time Amoskeag acquired its stock, the Home Fire Insurance
case, which everybody relies upon — my brother relies upon?
and our position to this showed that a new controlling stock­
holder, who had received the benefit of his stock by reason
of the wrongdoing of the prior stockholder, couldn't bring
the suit.
But the corporation could bring the suit, when
moneys was taken illegally from it, $3,000 by an officer,
and the court, Dean Pound in that case, wasn't worried about
the $3,000 inuring to the benefit of the present, controlling
stockholder.
That's why we think Home Fire Insurance supports us.
What I would like to point out is that the directors
of this corporation had before them, in July of 1971, a report
from the Bureau of /accounts, the Interstate Commerce Commis­
sion, which had been made public, and that said:

We recommend

that all legal remedies be explored to require the holding
company which sold the carrier to pay back to the carrier
for assets taken, with no compensation and charges made where
no services were performed.

And the Interstate Commerce Commission, as they
point out in their brief, simply couldn't do anything about
this. They had no jurisdiction over one railroad holding
company, they had no jurisdiction over the transfer of assets
from one corporate affiliate to another.
So if a director of the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad
at that time saw that statement in the Bureau of Accounts
report, as they did in July of 1971, what were they supposed
to do to discharge their fiduciary duty?
As a matter of fact, as the record points out, a
majority of the Board of the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad,
in July of 1971, were members of the prior Board.

The Board

which had sat while these assets were being taken away,
unbeknownst to them presumably? and a majority of that number
actually voted to bring this lawsuit.
So it was not a case where Amoskeag walked in,
changed the entire Board of Directors, and said: Now, let's
see what we can do to get back what was taken out of this
corporation.
It was the old Board majority that authorized the
bringing of this suit.
QUESTION:

It was —«

What if the one percent that wasn't

controlled by Bangor Punta had brought a minority stockholders 1
action while Bangor Punta owned 99 percent and forced, in
effect, the corporation to sue on the same count you're suing

26

on now?

Supposing there had been a recovery, that recovery

would have operated to enhance the value of BAR stock, wouldn't
it?
MR» LEFKOWITZ:

It would have inured to the benefit

of the corporation.
The question is really, I think, would it have
enhanced the value of the stock?

I -think that in these

situations where you're making sales, as we've tried to
point out .in our brief, the usual question is;
these properties worth?

What are

And what savings will be accomplished

if you're putting railroads together, or flatten out the
earnings projection so that you get not a one-time profit but
a realisation of what -die railroad, on a day-to-day basis, is
worth.
So, yes, possibly it might have enhanced the price
of the stock, but I don't think really as much as it does in
a normal corporate kind of arrangement.

I think the railroad

situation is something different along those lines.
QUESTION: Well, to the extent that it would have
enhanced the value of the stock, Amoskeag would have had to pay
more for it than when it bought it, wouldn't it?
MR. LEFKOWITZ;
really don't know.

Well, that's what I'm saying.

I

I'm not convinced that they would, have,

because it might have been a one-time increase in earnings,
which would be so-called leveled out.

27
QUESTION;

But, of course, that wouldn’t be

treated on the books as an increase in earnings, would it?
It would have been a ~~
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

I think in ICC accounting it may

have to be treated that way? but, as you’re speaking, sir, I
think that it would enhance, perhaps, the value of the
assets.
QUESTION:

It would certainly increase, then, if

there's fifteen million dollars more in the corporation, it
would certainly increase the net worth.
MR„ LE’FKOWITS:

Yes, sir, it wou 1 d.

QUESTION: And that would have some effect on -—
MR. LEFKOWITZ:

That would have some effect upon

what they purchased.
I wish to emphasise, incidentally, that although
there's

Amoskeag paid five million for the stock and

there is a recovery here sought, it is not seven million
dollars; that's when you add up all the various counts
together.

It's more like two or three million dollars.

So it is not in excess, really, of -the purchase price.
QUESTION:

If this one percent minority stock­

holder had brought a derivative suit and recovered
substantially long before this new transaction, the new
purchaser would have had to pay quite a bit higher price
for the railroad, wouldn't -they?

28
MR. LEFKOWITZ:
Mr. Justice Burger.
QUESTIONt

That’s what I’m not clear about,

Perhaps they would have, yes.
Well, let's suppose, hypothetically,

that in the derivative stockholder suit there was a five
million dollar recovery.
MR. LEFK0WIT2:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; Do you suggest there’s any doubt that
that would increase the value and therefore the probable
asking purchase price?
MR. LEFK0WXT3;

Would be higher?

Indeed might be,

and probably would.
So that the question now is;

Are we going to let

that be the controlling consideration, for this Court, or are
we going to allow the corporation itself now to try and
recover for the wrongs which were done upon it whan it was
controlled by Bangor Punta.
And. again I’d like to stress I think it’s the
public interest aspect of

this, the fact that this railroad

is a highly regulated company which gives special meaning in
this circumstance to bringing this lawsuit.
Now, let’s assume, for example, that one percent
stockholders now ask the corporation to bring a derivative
action. We would be met by the same argument if we were before
this Court -that we’re presently met with.

That is, the real

party in interest, even though a little shareholder here has

29

asked that a derivative suit be brought, the real party in
interest is Amoskeag, and therefore there can't be any
recovery beyond the one percent.

Based on the Headley case.

We suggest to this Court that the Headley case
really isn't controlling under such circumstances? that if a
derivative action were commenced now, the better rule would
be to allow the corporation to recover fully for what had
been done against it.
The effect of going with Judge Gignoux, who
dismissed the entire action, is that nobody will ever be
aisle to right the wrongs here.
Each time we will be faced with the Rule 23.2
argument, because the Court will say —• pardon me, Mr. Ryan,
in effect, will say;

Sorry, this is a windfall to Amoskeag.

The Headley case controls.
In fact, it seems to us that this being the kind of
corporation that it is, a railroad with a strong public
interest, that shouldn't be the case. Somebody ought to be
able to recover for this.
I think basically those are the ~~ that is the
essence of the case.
First, that this is unquestionably the railroad's
suit, it was brought by the railroad directors in response to
the Bureau of Accounts? the ICC could do nothing about it.
The Bureau of Accounts report said to the directors of the

30
corporation that it do something.

And in discharge of their

fiduciary duties, a lawsuit was commenced.
The real question, then — I don't think there's any
question about who is bringing the suit — the real question,
then, is:

Is the windfall argument going to outpace the

argument which says that this railroad ought to be able to
right the wrongs that was done to it.
We earnestly submit to this Court that the answer
ought to be: Allow this railroad, because it is a railroad,
to bring this lawsuit.

Things can be done if there is a

recovery to insure to a great degree that any recovery will
be used for the benefit of the public by strengthening the
railroad, by giving —» by allowing it to give better service
to those who it does serve.
Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Ryan.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES V. RYAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. RYAN:

Your Honor, just two points.

Mr. Justice Brennan, on the question as to whether
a certification would have been required here, in Point XV of
our Reply Brief, we point out that under -the law of Maine there
is no substantive right here that has been abridged.

That

under the law, that if this was a suit in Maine, the Hyams
case would have controlled the result.

31

So there's no need to have a certification, as.
you suggest, of the law on that aspect.

The Maine State

law procedure ~~
QUESTION; Well, I gather each of you insists that
the Maine law is settled in your favor?
MR. RYAN:

Well, all I can say is —

QUESTION;

That's quite a lawsuit in itself,

isn't it?
MR. RYAN:

I direct your attention to Point IV,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but so you say, and Mr.

Lefkowitz cites us something else which he says settles the
law on his side of it.
MR. RYAN:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And I would suppose that would be a good
situation to let the Maine Supreme Court tell us what the
law is.
QUESTION: Well, Mr. Ryan, let's assume for the
moment that someone has removed assets from a corporation
illegally, and has assets to the corporation that he's
converted to his own use.

What real reason is there to

prefer him to the corporation, and its new owner?

When a suit

is brought to recover those illegally converted assets?
MR. RYAN: Well, I think it's —
QUESTION:

You say there's a windfall, but, so

32

there may be, but if -the assets are not recovered, it's a
windfall to a wrongdoer.
MR. RYAN; Well, I know, Your Honor, the person who
purchased the corporation purchases the balance sheet, and
the balance sheet has assets —
QUESTION;

But conceding the windfall, Mr. Ryan.

MR, RYAN;

Yes, sir.

Well, if he’s

the

party is an uninjured party, and if you’re going to permit
uninjured parties to maintain action to recover alleged
depredations of assets, well, then
QUESTION; Well, what should you do with the assets
that have been illegally converted?

Leave them with the

wrongdoer?
MR. RYAN;

I don't

I think it's — you can't say

they've been illegally converted.
QUESTION:

I know, but assume they

•

MR. RYAN:

To assume they're i 1 legallyoconvertad

QUESTION; Well, that's what the lawsuit is all about.
MR. RYAN;
the action.

— there may be people who could maintain

In this case, the one percent.

Assuming there

was some real property involved or something, one percent
could maintain the action, because they would have some
interest.
QUESTION;

Well, the corporation ■— the corporation

normally represents all the people who are interested in the

33

Corporation, and that one percent would certainly benefit
if -the corporation recovered these illegally converted
assets.

If they had been illegally converted.
But that's what the lawsuit is all about.
MR. RYAN:

That -— that is quite true, but I think

when you look at this corporation, you look at what?
look at really Amoskeag,

That's what is standing there.

QUESTION:

I understand —

MR. RYAN:

Not the corporate faction.

QUESTION:

You

but you're just arguing again that

it's a windfall, and I'm asking you why —<■
MR. RYAN:

Essentially, yes, Your Honor, it's a

QUESTION:

Well, why prefer the wrongdoer to

windfall.

someone who might, receive a windfall, an innocent party who
might receive a windfall?
MR. RYAN: Well, the only way I guess I could answer
that, if you're going to permit that type of a situation,
then, you're going to have a lot of people going around bringing
lawsuits, who haven't been injured but are going to be
rectifying wrongs.

And, you know, you're going to find a

lot. of people who are going to want to be around to sue for
five million dollars, and they haven't been injured.
Now, they claim, they buy a corporate unit or they
do a lot of things.

But you're in affect saying, Your Honor,

34

is that, we should permit bounty hunting.
QUESTION: Well, I take it you v/ould have the same
you have the same —■» take the same position if there had
been a hundred stockholders of the old corporation, and then
there had been mismanagement and alleged conversion of
assets, and then the hundred all sold out to Amoskeag.
Well, that ~~ then you're changing it.

MR. RYAN:

Here you have Bangor Punta is the one who supposedly sold
out its own assets.
QUESTION:

How about my question now?

Let's assume a hundred stockholders, but now there’s
only one and he is suing for a wrong that was done when he
was not a stockholder, but there used to be a hundred when
the wrong was done.
Now, what about that?
MR. RYAN:
each transaction.

Well, I think you’d have to evaluate
I mean, if the party was defrauded, he

would have certain remedies? if he were injured, he would have
certain remedies.

This is this one of the one hundred who

could maintain action.

Actions under the Securities laws,

action under common lav/.
But that is not this situation, because the person
who was injured, Mr. Justice White, was Bangor Punta, it
took its own assets.
And if you left the assets in, as Mr. Chief Justice

35

stated
QUESTION: Well, that is a critical part of your
position, I take it?
MR. RYAN:

Oh, I think so, yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION: That not only is the re a sole stockholder
now who didn't own the stock when the wrong was done, but
there was a sole, in effect a sole stockholder when the
wrong was done?
MR. RYAN:

I think that there is no injured party

before the Court.
Now, whether you have one or whether you have a
hundred, I think the basic proposition is that Amoskeag wasn't
injured, and if there was anybody injured it was Bangor
Punta.
So I keep coining back, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 10:46 o'clock, a.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
