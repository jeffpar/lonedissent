District Council.
Mr. Jones, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN PAUL JONES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The case before you is a case involving a stats
court’s jurisdiction to enjoin the violation of a no-strike
promise by a union.

The Petitioner in this case is a general

contractor and for purposes of clarity in keeping the parties
straight, I’ll refer to the William E. Arnold Company,
Petitioner in this case, as "Company."
The company and the union had an agreement which
provided that there would be no strikes over the jurisdic­
tional dispute.

The general contractor of the company’s

subcontractor, who had a contract with another union,
pursuant to that agreement, assigned certain work to this
other union.
The Respondents here, the union, then struck in
violation of the no-strike clause, which also provided that
the grievance arbitration pprocedure of the National Joint
Board would obtain in any dispute over jurisdictional dispute.

n
The company then filed an action in the state
court for a temporary restraining order, which vras granted
after notice to the union’s attorney and after the pre­
emption doctrine had been argued before the state judge.

The

temporary restraining order was issued enjoining the union
from further breech of the collective bargaining agreement.
The union then filed a suggestion for writ of
prohibition in the First District Court of Appeal.

Pardon,

sir?
QUESTION:

That was a 301 suit in the state

court, was it?
MR. JONES:

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, it was.

It

' V',-

was not denominated as such in the pleadings, but' it was a
fair warning.
The suggestion for* writ of prohibition was filed
in the First District on the basis that the Garmon

Doctrine,

as it had been enunciated by the Supreme Court of Florida, in
both the sheet metal and the Florida Heat and Power cases,
preempted the state court from taking jurisdiction in any
labor dispute, regardless of whether or not it was a contract
violation, if the conduct involved was either arguably
protected or arguably prohibited under the National Labor
Relations Act.
The district court rejected this argument,
affirmed the jurisdiction of the state court.

5
The union then filed a petition for writ of
certiorari with the Supreme Court of Florida, which was
granted, and the Florida Supreme Court reversed the District
Court in a five to two decision, relying on it's previous
holdings in the Scherer and Sons case and in Florida Beat
and Power.

In both of those cases, the Florida Supreme

Court had enunciated this Court’s doctrine of Garmon.
We filed a — the company filed a petition for
rehearing, which was denied, and we are here today on writ of
certiorari to the Florida Supreme Court.
Our petition for writ of certiorari was filed
because of, as we contend in our brief and in the petition
for writ of certiorari, the decision of the Supreme Court of
Florida flies in the face of Smith v. Evening News and
Lincoln Mills and Dowd Box.
We submit that the simple question in this case
is whether a not a state court is preempted from enjoining
the breech of a no-strike promise in a collective bargaining
agreement, simply because the conduct which is involved in
the brief is also an arguable or admitted unfair labor
practice.
In this case, we concede that the conduct of the
union in striking over jurisdictional dispute was a violation
of Section 8(b)(4)(d) of the Act.
unfair labor practice.

So it was conceded]y an

6
We submit that the simple question can be
answered by reviewing this Court’s holding in Smith v.
Evening News and Carey v, Westinghouse.
We submit that if the state court has jurisdiction
to entertain an action for breech of a collective bargaining
agreement for damages or to compel arbitration, as was the
case in Carey v. Westinghouse., which also Involved a
jurisdictional dispute or representation question, depending
on how you look at the case, then all the more so the state
court should have jurisdiction to enjoin the breech of a no­
strike clause because this promotes the free flow of commerce
which is so basic in the purposes of the Act and it merely
reduces industrial strife by requiring the party who
committed the breech to be bound by the promise they made in
that agreement and to settle this dispute in a peaceful
manner.
We submit that the only distinction that can be
had between the Smith case and the Carey case and the case
before you is that this case involved an injunction to enjoin
the further breech of a no-strike promise and we submit,
further, that the Florida Supreme Court’s reliance on the
Gharman Doctrine is erroneous in that there is a major
distinguishing factor between Garmon
In Garmon,

and bb® instant case .

we are not concerned with a

contractual relationship between the parties and in both of

7
the cases relied upon by the Supreme Court of Florida, the
Scherer and Sons case and. the Florida Heat and Power, vie
admit that the result was right, but the reason was wrong
because they reasoned that any activity arguably prohibited
or protected is prompted in a broad spectrum and not taking
into account the fact that there may be a contractual
relationship between the parties.
Now, in neither of those cases, Scherer and Sons
nor in Florida Heat and Power, was there a contractual
relationship between the parties.
contract breech.

It did not involve a

It involved activity which should have

gone to the National Labor Relations Board, because it was
activity prohibited under Section 8 of the Act,
We submit, therefore, that under the prevailing
labor law, the state courts are not preempted in circum­
stances such as the instant case and that the Supreme Court
of Florida should be reversed..
We turn next to what

we believe is the larger

question in this case, and that is the role of state courts
in the adjudication of disputes over breeches of collective
bargaining agreement and the uniformity of national labor
policy and both among the states and the relief that is
available for breeches of most strike clauses for other
contractual promises as between the states and the federal
courts.

8
We respectfully submit that this Court’s opinion
in this case can lay down guidelines for the state courts to
be guided in their Jurisdiction as to the adjudication of
breeches of collective bargaining agreements and that this
will go a long way in achieving uniformity of results between
both states and federal forums.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, is that really before us?

My understanding is that the Supreme Court of Florida
issued a writ of prohibition saying that whatever standards
might apply to the Florida State Courts in

the enforcing of

301 action if they had jurisdictions that they were simply
prompted by the national act and they didn’t pass — the
district court of appeals didn’t pass on what standards
would guide them if they had the right to entertain this
s u 11«
MR. JONES:

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what we

would submit is that this question, so far as we can tell, is
one for the first time for this Court to decide as far as the
jurisdiction of the state courts to enjoin the breech of a
nc-sfcrike promise by way of injunction and as was pointed out
in the footnote in Dowd Box, that question was not before the
Court, whether or not Norrls-LaGuardia applied to the states
so as to preclude their issuance of an injunction.
I believe that question was answered in
Mr. Justice Brennan’s opinion in

Boys Markets, where in that

9
opinions you adopted the reasoning of Justice Trainer in the
Mercaro

case that in that regard, Norris-haguardia, although

Congress could have precluded the states from jurisdiction
to issue injunctions, they did not do so, that Morris LaOuardla applies only to the federal courts.
Now, we submit that the question is before the
Court in terms that we are here to decide whether or not a
state court has jurisdiction to enjoin the breech of a
collective bargaining agreement and in that context, then,
the opinion in this Court will decide for the first time, do
state courts have jurisdiction to enjoin a no-strike promise
by injunction?
And we submit that they do, that it would be
consistent with this Court's prior holdings.

It would be

consistent with the objective of the National Labor Relations
Act to achieve a uniform policy and promote industrial peace,
rather than Industrial strife.
We — I think that the parties here agree, both
the Respondent and the Amicus, the National Chamber, that
there should be a uniform policy throughout the country.
QUESTION:

Well, would this be met, do you think,

simply by a holding that applicable or pertinent federal law
is to govern the state court determination?
MR. JONES:

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, I would

submit that this question could be answered in a holding by

10
this Court that state courts have jurisdiction to enjoin nostrike breeches by injunctions and that the equitable relief —
QUESTION:

Well, that is if federal law would

produce that result and the state courts may apply federal
laws, as I understand it.
MR. JONES:

That is correct. Mr. Justice Brennan.

I believe that —
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

They not only may, they must.

IsrVt that

I'm sorry?
The state courts not only may apply

federal law', but they must do so.
MR. JONES:

Under Lincoln Mills, they must, yes

sir.
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Right.
And we submit that for clarity and

for uniformity of national labor policy, that that is what
this decision should mean, that state courts are bound by
federal law.

The law is unclear at this point because the

question was left open in the Boys Market opinion, as,
Mr. Justice Brennan, you are well aware.
But we would submit that under Boys Market, it
answered the question for whether or not federal courts could
issue an injunction in a labor dispute, not withstanding
Norris-LaGuardia restrictions.
We submit, though, that Boys Markets has left

11
open certain questions and placed certain restrictions upon
the parties in their pre-collective bargaining process.
We submit that the holding in this case should be
that a modified Boys Market holding 'would apply to both state
and federal courts in their entertaining any suit to enjoin
the breech of a no~strike promise and we submit further that
no no~strike promises are generally enforceable in either
state or federal courts.
We would turn now to several of the items in
Boys Markets which we consider were left open and would like
to advance argument to the Court on them.
In 3oys Markets a one of the conditions pre­
ceding, which Mr. Justice Brennan outlined in that opinion,
which was the adoption, of course, of the dissenting opinion
in Sinclair, was that as a condition precedent, the subject
matter of the dispute had to be subject to a final and
binding grievance and arbitration clause.
We submit that a no-strike promise in a
collective bargaining agreement should be enforced in
either a state or a federal court, notwithstanding whether
the underlying grievance is subject to a binding grievance and
arbitration clause or not.
Now, to do otherwise, we submit, dictates the
terms of

a collective bargaining agreement which goes

against this Court’s decision in American National Insurance

12

Company, 1952 and in the H. K. Porter case.
The reason we say that is this.

When the parties

sit dovm at the bargaining table and negotiate, there are a
lot of factors at play at that table when they meet and
discuss the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.
The employer may well be willing to pay more in
terras of wages and fringes to the members of the bargaining
unit if he gets in return, therefore, a specific exclusion
from the arbitration clause of some management decision, for
example, in subcontracting, the matter that was involved in
the Steelworkers trilogy in Warrior and Gulf.
Nov;, we submit that the parties should be left
free to negotiate their own terms of the agreement.

In

Warrior and Gulf, Mr. Justice Douglas re cognised that the
•

?.

.

parties could have specifically excluded from arbitration
that matter of whether or not they had the right unqualifiedly
to subcontract the work and that it would not be subject to
the grievance and arbitration procedure.
We note that in the Gateway decision, Mr. Justice
Powell noted that the parties could, if they chose, negotiate
a broad grievance and arbitration clause and yet specifically,
by terms in the agreement, negate any no-strike promise.
We submit that if the parties can do that, then
albeit they can exclude a narrow area from arbitration and
that to do so and to still have the no-strike promise

13
enforceable, even though the subject matter in dispute may
be within that narrow confine that is not subject to
arbitration, promotes the policies of the Act rather than to
do them violence because the underlying purpose of the Act,
of course, is to promote industrial peace and harmony and to
reduce interruptions of work through strikes and work
stoppages.
The whole underlying purpose of the Taft-Hartley
Amendment was to equalize the bargaining positions and the
enforceability of collective bargaining agreements as between
employers and unions because at that point, employers had
little incentive to enter into collective bargaining
agreements if they could not have them enforced and therefore
came the Section 301 jurisdiction which, it seems clear,
takes into its sphere not only legal relief, but equitable
relief.

The legislative history of that seems somewhat

clear.
We submit that the rule as to enforcement of no­
strike promises

should follow along the lines of ,a doctrine

enunciated by Mr. Justice Douglas in Warrior and Gulf and in
that case, the argueably arbitrable doctrine was established
that anything that was argueably arbitrable would, be deemed
to be subject to the arbitration clause of the contract.
We submit that no-strike promises should be
argueably enjoinable and that if the union promises for the

14
duration of the contract not to strike —
QUESTION:

This is a jurisdictional dispute in

this case, isn't it?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.
Is it — let's see, I've forgotten —

it's an arbitration provision?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So this is mandatorily an arbitration

procedure, mandatory arbitration procedure.
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice —
So we don't have in this case, at

least, the situation you are addressing now of simply a nostrike clause v/ithout an arbitration provision?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan.
But you are nevertheless asking us to

decide that?
MR. JONES:

I am asking this Court to look at

that question in terms of the fact that the Boys Markets
decision has left open whether or not it applies to the state.
QUESTION:

Yes, we left it open rather purposely,

I think, in Boys Market.

We limited — we said that the

Boys Market decision dealt narrowly with the question of
enjoinability of a strike in a situation where there was an
arbitration provision for handling the grievance that
provoked the strike.

13
HR, JONES:
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

That is correct, but in Boys —
Your case would go beyond that.
Yes s sir., but in adopting the Boys

Market decision, of course, it was the dissenting opinion from
Sinclair —
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

That's right.
— which set up these conditions

precedent to invoking the arbitration, to Invoking the Court's
jurisdiction to enjoin, the breech of the no-strike promise.
QUESTION:

But one of those conditions, was it

not, was that they determined whether or not it was an
arbitrable grievance, wasn't it, in the Sinclair dissent?
MR. JONES:
QUESTION:
MR. JONES:
listed and adopted just

It was one of the conditions in —
Yes.
•— the Sinclair dissent.

It was

verbatim,, as this Court's holding

in Boys Markets was that, one, it had to be — the dispute
had to be subject to the grievance and arbitration clause.
QUESTION:

It had to be over a grievance which

both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate.
MR. JONES:

Yes, sir and also that in the court

order, it should order the employer to arbitrate that.
Mow, we would submit that the order should run
both ways and order both parties and I believe that in the
Boys Markets case that that was the case.

The district

court did order both parties to submit to arbitration.

We

are simply, Mr. Justice Brennan, pointing out that in the
Boys Market decision, the loopholes that were left there,
we are pointing out here, will provide an opportunity, unless
state courts are granted through this decision, broad
jurisdiction to enjoin those strike promises, that we are
going to be faced with a situation where —QUESTION:

Well, but it may be that the whole

underlying premise of Boys Market was, you may enjoin
violation of a no-strike provision only if there is a
compulsory arbitration provision applicable to the grievance
which provokes the strike.
MR. JONES:

Yes, sir, and that, Mr. Justice

Brennan, is our point in that if that is the clear holding of
Boys Markets, then through that decision, we are dictating
substantive terms of a collective bargaining agreement
because if an employer knows that in order to have a no­
strike promise enforced, he has to have everything subject to
the grievance and arbitration clause, then we are telling
the employer, you must agree, if you want your no-strike
promise which you paid dearly to get, to have peace for a
year or two years or three years, you must agree to a broad
grievance arbitration clause that covers everything, then we
are dictating to that employer the terms of a substantive
term of that collective bargaining agreement.

17
We submit, that if that is the holdings then we
are placing restrictions on the employer that are not
contemplated nor desired by the act which promotes and
encourages free collective bargaining betvjeen the

parties

and leaves the parties at the door of the bargaining room and
It depends then on the relative strength of the parties and
the skill of the negotiators and how much each party is
willing to pay to get an agreement.
We submit that there are several areas that are
left open in Boys Markets,several loopholes., for instance, if
a union wants to say, we are going to strike but
going to tell you what we are striking about.

we are

not

If they are

dissatisfied with their union representation, call a wildcat
strike.
Under Boys Markets, that would not be subject to
the grievance arbitration clause.

We submit that the instant

case presents a perfect opportunity of demonstrating what will
happen unless there is uniformity of decision among the states
and that the thrust of the Florida Supreme Courtfs decision
is that the employer can sit and negotiate terms of a
bargaining agreement, extract a promise from the union
through give and take process and yet, if that promise is not
enforceable in a state court, then for all intents and
purposes, the employer has been undermined in his bargaining
attempts and }\re would point out, too, that unless the rule

18
is the same as to state and federal courts, thats one, If
state courts have broader jurisdiction to grant greater
relief than the federal courts, we will get into a situation
of pre~Boys Markets where it is removed under the Avco
because if they can narrow the relief, they'll remove it from
federal court and if this is the case, or if the state
courts do not have jurisdiction to enjoin breeches of nostrike promises, then we are going to add greatly to the
workload of the federal court system and in that regard I
would point out that in our jurisdiction in Jacksonville,
we have 20 general jurisdiction state courts that are
available to apply for a temporary restraining order.
We have two already overdocketed federal district
judges and —
QUESTION:

Mr. Parley, in his brief, tells us

that there is no binding arbitration clause here.

I suppose

you'd be willing -- or are you willing to submit that the
case turns on that?
MR, JONES:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we don't

believe that the case turns on that.

We would submit that

there is the binding arbitration clause when the whole contract
is read, which is in the Appendix beginning at page A20, we
submit that the parties have agreed to abide by the terms
for settlement of jurisdictional disputes under the joint
board and that that incorporates by reference that document

19

which would set

up the final and binding provisions of the

agreement.
QUESTION:

Well, if he is right in his position

that there is no binding arbitration agreement, then what
happens to your case?
MR. JONES:

If there is no final and binding

arbitration?
We would submit that the state court still had
jurisdiction to enjoin the no-sfcrike promise because the
union agreed there shall be no work stoppages because of
jurisdictional disputes, period.
QUESTION:

Now, in this context -—

Mr, Jones, wouldn't you contend that

once you get to the end of the premption issue that if there
is no preemption here, the state court has jurisdiction to
decide, as the Chief Justice says, whether there was a
binding or a no-strike clause, binding arbitration clause
and decide whether that is required by the law.

I mean, what

you are appealing from is the decision of your highest state's
what was it, the circuit court of Duval County can’t even
entertain an action like this, not how to decide it on the
merits

once it is entertained.
MR. JONES:

Rehnquist.

That is correct, Mr. Justice

They decided that

they had no jurisdiction in

the first place of initio because of the Garmon

Doctrine

which is what they incorporated in their two decisions on

which they relied and we submit that that is erroneous
reasoning and an erroneous result, that the state court is
not prempted, that the state court has jurisdiction, that the
case is the Smith case except in this case there was an
injunction issued and this is where, vie submit, is the
broader question in this case which should be examined along
with Boys Markets, that there ought to be uniformity both
among trie states and between state and federal courts.
QUESTION:

But if the circuit court has

jurisdiction, if it isn’t preempted by Garmon,

then, I

take it, it has a right to issue an injunction

erroneously

under Boys Market as well as to issue an injunction correctly
under Boys Market,

There was an intimation in the District

Court of Appeals' decision that maybe the judge writing the
opinion for the District Court of Appeals thought the
Circuit Court had made the wrong decision, but that did not
deprive them of jurisdiction.
MR. JONES:

Well, that is correct and I think

that the District Court of Appeals made some mention about the
application of Boys Markets and the statement, “Whether or
not it is free of

error,” because he did not issue also

an order for the employer to arbitrate.
MS. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Farley.

21

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JOSEPH S. PARLEY, JR., ESQ.,
OW BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FARLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I am in complete agreement with Mr. Jones as to
we all would like to have uniformity in the federal labor law.
The problem that this case presents is that you have two
relatively well-gone-over doctrines in the federal labor lav;
that are presented in this case.

The first is the doctrine

of federal premption over unfair labor practices, the
Garmon

Doctrine. Garner, Weber

decisions saying: that if a

case presents a dispute that is argueably an unfair labor
practice or a protected activity under the Act, that the
Federal Government has prempted the area and that;.:state
courts should defer to the federal jurisdiction.. .
Then, in this particular case, you also have the
question of the Norris*LaGuardia Act and the prohibition on
federal courts of Issuing injunctions in labor disputes.
The Florida Supreme Court held, essentially,
that the fact that a contract Is involved does not remove
the prohibitions of preemption that the Federal Government
has placed upon the states, that this area of the law, the
injunction in a labor law dispute, is

sufficiently of

national concern and national interest that the state court
should defer at least initial jurisdiction to the National

Labor Relations Board when injunctive relief is what is
requested and when it is conceded!,y an unfair labor practice
involved.
Our position is simply that if state courts
would follow this position, you would have your uniformity
:Ln your federal labor lav/.

There is nothing to prevent the

company, if they feel as though a no-strike position has
been breeched, from going into federal court.
There is nothing to prevent the company, if they
feel an unfair labor practice is being practiced' upon them,
to go to the National Labor Relations Board and there is
nothing in the world preventing the National Labor Relations
Board from doinp; something about it.
That is the whole purpose for which they were
set up.

They have the machinery to acquire injunctions.

They have the machinery to issue cease and desist orders
against activities like this.

This area of the law has long

MR. PARLEY;

,. <•

No, your Honor:p'but

would point out

that this Court has held long before now that state courts

it is fairly clear that that doesn't happen' all the time.

QUESTION:

Well, isn’t your emphasis, really,

that they aren’t as familiar with federal laws that the
federal district judge is at least presumed to be?
MR. PARLEY:

Exactly, your Honor, exactly.

And

I don’t think that there is any question but that this is
the case and I think that it is just, with the federal
machinery that is set up, particularly with the National
Labor Relations Board, with this Court's holding in Boys
Market making it obvious how Important the injunction is
in federal labor law, that you should allow all the trial
courts in the different states to try and interpret the law,
that because the labor injunction is of national concern,
that outweighs the consideration that a contract was also
involved and is sufficient reason to employ the Garmon
Doctrine of federal preemption, especially in this case
where there is

concededly an unfair labor practice involved

especially in this case where, at least in my opinion, there
is not a binding arbitration clause.

There is no provision

whatsoever for arbitration and I am not sure that there isn’
actually an agreement as to what is going to be binding in
front of the parties and, of course, then you have the
pi’oblsm of the labor union wasn't even a party to this
contract.
The record, unfortunately, is silent as to what

26
procedures were taken by either the union involved here, the
carpenter's union or the company, to attempt to follow the
grievance procedure that was somewhat set out in the contract.
There was no transcript made of the hearing and it is unclear
whether the lather's union was unwilling to follow this
procedure, whether the company was unwilling to —
QUESTION:

What you are defending here, of course,

is the decision of your supreme court that says the circuit
court in Jacksonville can’t even inquire into these issues,
that they simply have no jurisdiction to look into the things
you are talking about.
MR. FARLEY:

Yes, your Honor.

My position is that

the Florida Supreme Court held exactly foursquare with
Weber

and with Garmon

and in attempting to keep the law

uniform, the federal labor law uniform, they followed what
the United States Supreme Court said in those cases.

They

followed it very strictly that if, argueably, you have the
unfair labor practice, the state courts should defer
jurisdiction,
QUESTION:

But then the kind of fact which you

were just mentioning, you know, whether the lathers did this
or did that, really don't bear on the jurisdictional issue,
do they?
MR. FARLEY:

Only to the extent that you also have

the question of the contractual agreement and if you get into

27
Boys Market, the area of injunctive relief, which this Court —
which this case did present to the Florida Supreme Court,
they had been concerned in prior cases with the issuing of
ex parte injunctions in labor disputes, it becomes important
as to what went on because of Boys Market saying that it
must be, for the federal courts, anyway, to enjoin an
activity,

there must be the binding arbitration procedure.
QUESTION:

Well, supposing that that is the rule

of Boys Market and supposing you are wrong on your Garmon
point, that the circuit court in Duval

County has

jurisdiction to entertain this action, but it must follow
Boys Market and that is the rule of Boys Market.
The fact that it may have wrongly issued an
injunction in this particular case wouldn’t support what the
Supreme Court of Florida did. here because they said it had no
business even inquiring into the subject.
MR. PARLEY:
imply that it would.

Yes, your HOnor.

I wasn't trying to

I understand that If the state court

had jurisdiction of this matter, it doesn't make It — that is
the question that we have here, not whether it wrongfully or
rightfully enjoins If it had jurisdiction, but rather, does
it have jurisdiction?
I believe it was the Attorney General that
brought in their memorandum to the Court, brought up the
question of abstention of state courts.

I don’t really see a

28

big distinction between the Florida Supreme Court saying.
"We are going to abstain, we are going to defer our
jurisdiction —"
QUESTION:

They didn’t say anything about

deferring it, did they?
MR. FARLEY:

Not in this case, they didn’t say

they were deferring it.
QUESTION:
MR. FARLEY:
QUESTION:

They 3aid they didn’t have any.
Right.
They said there was no jurisdiction

at all.
MR. FARLEY:

Well, the way they phrased It in

the prior cases, I believe it was Sheetmetal but it might
have been Scherer, that the state court should defer initial
jurisdiction, should defer jurisdiction, at least to the
point of letting the National Labor Relations Board make the
initial decision as to federal jurisdiction.
It may be that the Florida Supreme Court was
taking the position of deferring and abstaining to the
National Labor Relations Board.

That was my reading of their

opinion, was that they would be happy to take jurisdiction
of the case if the National Labor Relations Board did not
feel it came within the federal preemption doctrine or came
under the National Labor Relations Board jurisdiction.
They didn't say flat out, we are not going to take

23
jurisdiction of cases that argueably come under the TaftHartley Act.

They just said initially they would prefer, in

the interest of uniformity, to have the National Labor
Relations Board make a decision.
QUESTION:

Of course, the language, if I am

reading the correct opinion, Judge McKane, Justice McKane is
the court’s opinion, isn't it?

The bottom paragraph is,

"We hold that the district court erred in failing to
prohibit the further exercise of jurisdiction by the circuit
court."

That does have some overtones of v/hat you suggested,

perhaps further exercise.
MR. FARLEY:

I have tried to point out in my

brief that regardless of the dictum that the Florida
Supreme Court threw out, the case that they decided was a.
case for injunctive relief, that on the face of the complaint
alleged an unfair labor practice and that they decided that
in that situation, where there is no binding arbitration
clause, at least the way I read it, that the state court
should not utilize its jurisdiction, it should defer
jurisdiction.
And again, to repeat, it seems to me that the
best way to ensure national uniformity in our federal labor
law and relations and especially in the area of unfair labor
practices and injunctive relief, is to allow the state courts
to defer to the federal courts for the National Labor

30

Relations Board.
Congress has set out what the unfair labor
practices are.

Congress determined that a national agency

should oversee and should try and curtail and prevent these
unfair labor practices.

This Court has been very definitive

in under what situations the district court could grant
injunctive relief.
It seems to me that if the injunction is of such
interest to Congress and to the federal labor law, that they
would pass a law, the Norris-LaGuardia Act, prohibiting the
district courts from granting injunctive relief and that, I
think, is the national policy.

That represents the national

policy of being very careful under what situations you grant
injunctive relief.
Now, I don't see any sense at all in having one
layer of law, one pathway of

law being the federal law

saying only under these circumstances can injunctive relief
be granted in the federal courts, but under any old circum­
stances, they can be granted in the state courts.

That is

just not in tiie interest of a national uniform labor policy.
QUESTION:

Of course, what do you do about the

limitation in the language of the Norris-LaGuardia Act that
says it applies to coui?ts of the United States and
certainly intimates it doesn't apply to state courts.
MR. PARLEY:

Well, I don't know that this is the

31
case where thl3 Court could extend the language of the
Norrls-LaGuardia Act to state, state courts.
I would point out, though, that In Boys Market,
this Court noted that a good number of the states already
have anti-injunction statutes so that you got sort of a
hodge-podge, anyway, with the state courts.
What I am saying is that to allow state courts,
as this one did, to defer to the federal jurisdiction, would
be better than allowing 50 states to go in 50 different
ways on federal injunction labor law.
I don't know — on the face of it, your
contractura! question, there is a conflict between the
Florida Supreme Court's decision and. the decision in
Smith v. Evening Hews, but to say that it is such a conflict
that we are going to just throw out to all the 50 states the
question of federal injunctive relief and let them decide it
as they may, I think that the latter is more important and
that the contractual question should yield to the federal
preemption doctrine in this situation.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Farley.
Do you riave anything further, Mr. Jones?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN PAUL JONES, ESQ.
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

32
the Court:
Just one or two closing points.

My worthy

adversary has pointed out that in regard to the National
Labor Relations Board, that they could well take cognizance
of the matter and grant relief.
We would point out, one, they do not have the
po*tfer to issue cease and desist orders.

They must be

enforced through a circuit court if it is an order of the
board or, also under Lection 10(k) they are required by
statute to defer to a voluntary method if it is outlined in
the agreement.
We would point out, as Mr. Justice Douglas
pointed out in Locbridge , in the Lockridge dissent, that the
machinery of the board is one of the slowest-grinding
processes that one could experience and someone would be out
of business by the time they invoked those procedures.
The NLRB has held, in the V&C Brickcleaning case,
the ColIyer case and the Laborers case that they Will defer
to an arbitration process, even when there may be a specific
violation of an unfair labor practice.
We would point out also that in Carey, there were
two unions involved and that it wasn't clear whether both of
them were subject to the arbitration clause, but arbitration
was ordered by the holding in this Court.
We submit that the question as to Norris-LaGuardia

33
and the application of the states was answered in the Boys
Markets opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan adopted Justice
Trainer’s reasoning in the Carroll case.
We would submit that by virtue of that, that
question has been answered.

The state courts do, then, have

jurisdiction to issue injunctions and labor disputes in
contractual matters when you apply the reasoning of Smith v.
Evening Mews and we would submit that the best effectuation
of national labor policy of freedom of collective bargaining,
the free flow of commerce and of deferral to the party’s
choice of the terms of that collective bargaining agreement,
that all of these things are best served by permitting the
states to enjoin breeches of no-strike promises and that this
will go a long way toward achieving uniformity among the
states and between the state and federal system, that in —
as was pointed out in Boys Market, damage action may lie for
the breech of a no-strike promise.

But a damage action

hardly is compensation for the irreparable harm that occurs
to an employer when a strike occurs and that the injunction
is so important a device in the enforcement of no-strike
promises, that it should not be denied, and the maximum
justice delayed is justice denied has zio truer meaning than
in this context.
When a strike occurs, irreparable damages begin
to run and the employer is left with no formum.

He cannot go

to the state court.

If he goes to the federal court, It is a

longer wait or, if he is required to go to the National
Labor Relations Board, which really can grant him no
immediate relief anyway, then he is left without any remedy at
all and even under the injunction procedures of the National
Labor Relations Board in 8(b)(4)(b) or 8(b)(4)(d) situations
where, under the statute, the board is required to give them
priority treatment, our practical experience has been that if
you can get to the U.S. District Court within 10 days, it is
a miracle and from that regard, then, we submit that the
National Labor Relations Board is no forum to adjudicate this.
They do not have the power to do so and they do not have the
machinery and they have said themselves that they will defer
to the parties.
We submit, therefore, that the basic question
here that we

face in determining the matter of whether or

not state courts should be allowed to enjoin no-strike
promises is, how can the purposes of the act be frustrated
or the employees' rights be infringed if they are required
to do what they promised to do in a collective bargaining
agreement?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, Mr. Farley.

Thank you, Mr. Jones.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, the case was submitted at 11:25
os clock a.m.]
