MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments next

in 72-1162, Federal Power Commission v. New England Power
Company.
Mr. Jones, I think you may proceed whenever you are
ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case is here on the government’s petition for a
writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit.

The issue is whether the

Federal Power Commission, under Title V of the Independent
Offices Appropriations Act of 1952, which we have been discussxng, whether the Federal Power Commission is authorised under
that Act to impose annual fees upon.the electric energy and
natural gas companies for the purpose of partially defraying
the costs of regulating those industries.
This issue is, of course, closely similar to the one
discussed in the preceding case.
The application of Title V in any given case depends
in large part upon the nature of the —
Q

It is not only similar, but it does raise the

same issue, doesn't it?

4
MR. JONES:

One of the issues is identical, Mr.

Justice Douglas, that is correct.

But, as I was saying, the

application of Title V in any given case also depends upon the
nature of the governmental activities in question, and for that
reason I will discuss at the outset the particular activities
of the Federal Power Commission for which the fees here have
been assessed.
The Federal Power Commission has authority to regulate
two industries, electric energy and natural gas industries.

In

connection with its regulation of the natural gas industry, at
issue here are certain annual fees which the Commission has
imposed in connection with its regulation of the sale of
natural gas.

There are two types of sales in question.

One,

from producers to pipeline companies, and the second is the
resale by pipeline companies in interstate commerce.
In regulating producer sales, the Commission reviews
the contracts between the producer and the pipeline company for
delivery of natural gas at the wellhead.

The delivery of

natural gas at the wellhead cannot commence until the Commission
approves the contract as to amount, price and other terms and
conditions of sale.

The approval of the contract takes the form

of what is called the issuance of a producer certificate.

This

certificate permits the pipeline company to take delivery of
the natural gas at the wellhead and to begin transporting it in
interstate commerce.

5
Instead of imposing a fee for the issuance of each
particular certificate, the Commission has determined to impose
an annual fee on each pipeline company based upon the amount of
natural gas reserves certified for delivery to that company in
connection with the producer certificate program during the
year.
This so-called added reserve fee is the first of the
fees at issue in this case.
The Commission is also responsible for regulating the
sales of the pipeline companies, as I have indicated.

The re­

view of the sales by the pipeline companies takes the form of
review and approval of pipeline rate schedules, and this review
procedure is invoked normally by the filing by a pipeline com­
pany of a new rate schedule.
Ordinarily, or at least frequently, the Commission
permits a new rate schedule to go into effect without holding
a rate setting hearing.

But when hearings are held, as is

frequently the case, they can be time-consuming, expensive and
quite complicated.

As a consequence, the rate setting proceed­

ing of pertaining to any particular filing of a new rate
Schedule may bear little direct relationship to the dollar
amount of the rate increase which is being sought.

For that

reasons, the Commission has determined that it is more equit­
able to impose a fee not on the basis of each particular rate
increase filing but rather in the form of an annual fee imposed

6

upon all pipeline companies on the basis of annual sales.
is the second fee at issue in this case.

That

And those are the

two pipeline company fees in question here.
Now, the Commission also regulates the electric energy
companies.

Its regulation of those companies is similar in

basic outline to the regulation of the natural gas industry.
The Commission has responsibility for regulating the transmis­
sion of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of
that energy for resale.
In carrying out this responsibility, it conducts what
is called a coordination and reliability program.

This program

consists of a region-by-region monitoring of the adequacy of
electric transmission and generating facilities in relation to
the growing demand for electric energy and the shifting pattern
of its use from season to season and daynight and nighttime.
In connection with this program, the Commission is
authorized to direct electric utility companies to interconnect
their transmission facilities, one with the other.

These inter­

connections minimise the likelihood of blackouts and brownouts
and permit the electric utility companies to share their
generating facilities in effect, rather than relying entirely
upon their own generating facilities.
Since this coordination and reliability program is
conducted on an industry-wide basis, and not at the instance of
any particular company, the Commission has determined that the

7
only fair and practicable means of allocating the cost of the
program is through an industry-wide assessment, and that
assessment is a third of the fees at issue here.
The Commission also regulates the rates charged by
electric utility companies in their sale of electric energy for
resale.

The electric utility companies file new rate schedules

and the Commission has imposed a sliding scale fee for the
filing of a rate schedule.

And it is anticipated that this

sliding scale fee will cover the major portion of the cost of
the Commission's electric utility rate-setting activities.

But

since those activities or the cost of these activities cannot
be known until the end of the year for any given year, and also
because the Commission undertakes certain incidental regula­
tory activities for which there is no set fee, it is antici­
pated that the sliding scale fees will not cover the full
pertinent regulatory costs here, and for that reason the
Commission has also imposed an annual fee on the electric
utility companies to cover the residual costs of rate-setting
and other incidental costs.
To recapitulate, there are four fees here at issue:
The added reserve fee on the pipeline companies, in connection
with the producer certificate program, the fee on the pipeline
companies to cover the costs of rate-setting activities, the
fee on the electric utility companies to cover the costs of
the coordination and reliability program, and, finally, the fee

8
on the electric utility companies to cover certain residual
and incidental costs*
The Court of Appeals held all four fees to be invalid.
The court determined that a fee is justified under Title V only
if it is in return for the conferral of a special benefit, and
the court concluded that there was no special benefit conferred
on the two industries here in question.
But the court went on to add that in its view the im­
position of fees of this kind was somehow inconsistent with the
Commission's responsibility far regulating in the public inter­
est.
I will now turn to the legal issues which are raised
by the Court of Appeals opinion.
Q

Mr. Jones, before you do, I want to ask you this

primarily out of curiosity.

We heard in the last case about the

fees charged by the Communications Commission and in this one
about the fees charged by the Power Commission,

Are these

exceptional or is it the rule rather than the exception?

In

other words, does the Securities and Exchange Commission, does
the Interstate Commerce Commission, does the various other
agencies, independent agencies and commissions these days, under
Title V, charge the industry generally, quite apart from the
question of filing fees and so on, or not?
MR. JONES:
that question.

Do you know?

Well, frankly, I don't know the answer to

I have assumed that such industry-wide fees of

9
this kind have not been imposed by the other regulatory com­
missions as of yet, but I can’t say that with any certainty.
Q

Your impression is —

MR. JONES:
Q

That is your impression.

MR. JONES:
Q

That is ray impression.

That is correct.

That these are perhaps the only two agencies that

do it in this way, apart from filing fees.
MR. JONES:

It may be that other agencies have re­

cently imposed such fees or are giving serious consideration to
doing so, but so far as I know there are no other annual fees
of this kind.
Q

But again, I sav that I am not positive.
Thank you.

MR. JONES:

Before turning to a discussion of the

kinds of issues that were discussed under Title V in the pre­
vious case, it is necessary I think to deal with what properly
considered is probably a peripheral issue here.

Title V, when

it authorised the imposition of certain fees, included a pro­
viso which stated that no statute prohibiting the collection or
imposition of any fee was thereby repealed.

And the New

England Power Company here has seized upon that proviso and
contended that the Federal Pother Commission derives no author­
ity at all under Title V.

And 1' think it is necessary to turn

our attention to that only briefly.
The Commission’s argument is that since the Federal

10
Power Act itself did not authorize the imposition of fees of
this kind, therefore that must be taken to be an implicit pro­
hibition on the filing of —- on the imposition of fees, and
therefore that the proviso prohibits the Federal Power Commis­
sion from imposing any fees, but the Title V proviso by its
very terms was intended only to insure that the statute would
not be construed as repealing any express prohibition that was
already on the books.
The House report accompanying Title V described it,
and I quote, as "providing authority for government agencies to
make charges for services in cases where no charge is made at
present."

The basic purpose of Title V was to confer authority

where none previously existed, therefore it seems to us clear
beyond any serious question that the Commission does have
authority under Titia V to impose fees.

And the issue

posed

by this case is whether that authority extends to the particular
fees in question.
Title v speaks in terms of work performed, services
or benefits provided or privileges granted to or fox* any person,
including groups.

Now, one of the major points of contention

in this case is whether the statutory phrase "any person, in­
cluding groups" can in an appropriate case foe applied to an
industry as an entity.
It seems obvious to us that that statutory phrase
does embrace the companies that comprise a single industry.

An

11
industry consists of a group of companies, and groups are
covered by the explicit language of the statute.
Q

Where is the statute?

Moreover ---

Have you got it in your

brief ?
MR. JONES:
Q

In our brief it is on pages 2 and 3.

I rather thought that the groups included the

definition of person.
MR. JONES:

Let me see here —■
That's right, it says "to or for any

person (including groups, associations, organizations," et
cetera.," reading on the bottom of page 2.
Q

Yes, "to or for any person," and the parenthetical

material simply makes clear that, the definition of person is a
broad definition.

Isn’t that right?

MR. JONES:
Q

That is correct.

Your argument ultimately has to be then that a

whole industry can be a person.
MR. JONES:

Is that right?

Well, I suppose there would be two

parallel arguments, one is that a whole industry can be a
person, secondly that when each member of an industry has work
performed on its behalf, then a fee as to each member is
appropriate and therefore a fee as to all members is appropri­
ate .
Q

Because it is "to or for any person," and you

would agree that the parenthetical material following that .is
directed to the definition of person or the understanding of

12
meaning of the word person in this statute.
MR„ JONES:

Would you not?

Definition or elaboration of the meaning

of ~™
Q

Of the word person.

And there you say that with­

in that parenthetical material is the word "groups," which you
say can mean therefore the whole industry, but it comes back to
whether or not the word ’’person" can mean a whole industry,
doesn't it?
MR. JONES:

Well, as I say, the fee of course is not

imposed on the industry, it is imposed on each of the separate
members of the industry.
Q

Each constituent of the industry.

MR. JONES:

And clearly each company is a person, so

that in that sense a. fee is to each member of the industry,
which clearly would seem to be authorized under Title V.
Q

Well, "thing of value or utility performed,

furnished, provided, granted, prepared, or issued."
MR. JONES:

The question would be, I suppose, whether

were performed for the industry is for each member of the in­
dustry.
Q

It is whether or not "thing of value...,to or for

any person” can be read, because of this parenthetical phrase to
mean two or for an industry, doesn't it, or all persons in the
industry genera1ly?
MR. JONES:

Well, I think I understand you, and I

13

think I agree with you, but I am not wholly sure.
Q

But 1 wonder if that isn't the question, as a

matter of statutory construction.
MR. JONES:

Well, I think the question, as a matter of

statutory construction, as it arises in this case, is whether
an industry-wide benefit, that is a benefit or work performed
for the whole industry indivisibly nevertheless is a benefit
to or for the constituent members of that industry for purposes
of Title V.

And our position is that the bare language of the

statute certainly permits that construction and, furthermore,
that there is certainly no policy reason why an agency which
confers a benefit on. an industry as a group should not be able
to assess a properly allocated fee as to each member of that
industry.

That, at any rate, is our contention with respect to

this aspect of Title- V.
Q

So long as 1 have already interrupted you, Mr.

Jones, how much of a problem would it be for you to supply us,
after some time within a reasonable time, with the practices
of the other major agencies like the CAB and the SEC and the
Interstate Commerce Commission —
MR. JONES:

We could make a search of that kind and

let you know.
Q

—■ about whether or not they charge the industry

they regulate a fee or the component parts of the indusfc3:y an
annual fee?

14
We would be happy to do that arid supply

MR. JONES:

the Court with that information.
Q
bit, if I may.

Mr. Jones, 1st me just enlarge
I notice that the language of

on it a little
Title V is that —

at the top of page 3 -- "the head of each Federal agency is
authorized by regulation” to work out some kind of fee schedule.
I have wondered whether, when you responded previously to Mr.
Justice Stewart, that as far as you knew only the FCC and the
Federal Power Commission have moved, whether this was a first
step in an experimental exercise of the authority, these were
two first steps, or whether the others just haven’t get around
to it, or what the situation is.

I think if there is any

governmental policy that is relevant, I think that that should
foe included with your information about what agencies have pro­
ceeded to exercise this authority.
MR. JONES:

Well, the origin of the fees in these two

cases is fairly clear from the statement of the facts in the
respective briefs.

The relevant appropriations committees of

the Congress have been urging these two commissions certainly
for some time in the past to impose fees of this kind, and it is
in response to the Congress5 suggestion that these fees have
been imposed.

For that reason, 1 doubt that there has been a

coordination of policy by all the independent agencies.

I think

that these two agencies are moving in response to perceive
congressional demands.

Q

Title V has been in existence now for more than

twenty years, so there has been room for more than a first ex­
perimental step, hasn't there?
MR, JONES:
Q

A twenty-year period.

MR. JONES:
Q

That's right.

That's right.

But it hasn't been exercised until now, is that

not correct?
MR. JONES;

It has been a. discretionary authority

which at least by these two agencies has not been exercised in
this manner in the past.

The Federal Power Commission did im­

pose fees upon the certification of —• excuse me, upon the
issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity
several years ago, and that was the exercise of authority under
Title V.
Q

The Post Office has been doing this I guess

since the first year of our Nation,

hasn't it, something

similar to this?
MR. JONES;

It certainly imposes a user fee, that's

correct.
The respondent’s contention about the fee not being
applicable to industries on account of industry-wide benefits
is based upon the Budget Circular A-25, which was discussed in
the preceding case.

We would simply point out here that that

Budget circular doss not require the kind of restrictive

16

reading which the power company and the natural gas companies
would give it.

That doss speak in terms of measurable unit of

service to identifiable recipients, but again if an industry as
such is the identifiable recipient of a benefit, then nothing
in the Budget circular by its terms weald prohibit the assess­
ment of an industry-wide fee.
Furthermore, as my colleague Mr. Korman pointed out
in the preceding case, that Budget circular does not apply to
independent agencies, it merely sets forth a general fee setting
policy for the Executive Branch agencies»
1 turn now to the question of whether the Commission,

in performing the regulatory activities here in question, per­
forms work, provides a service or benefit or grants a privilege
to or for the companies in these industries.

And this is a

question which must be considered I think on a fee-by-fee basis.
I turn first therefore to the added reserve fee which the Com­
mission has imposed upon the pipeline companies in connection
with the producer certificate program.
That fee, it should be pointed out at the outset, is
not an industry-wide fee.

That is, it is not a fee which is

assessed in amount and then arbitrarily allocated among the
constituent members of the industry.

It is a fee which is im­

posed only on those pipeline companies for which new reserves
have bean certified for delivery under the producer certificate
program during that year,

The certification of a contract for

17
the delivery of reserves of that kind is analogous in purpose
and effect to a license for the conduct of additional business ,
and it is clearly of benefit to the company because it thereby
secures additional supplies which would not otherwise be avail­
able to it.
And this added reserve fee which is imposed is imposed
in a manner directly proportional to the amount of reserves
which have been certified to that company for the year, there­
fore it is proportional to the benefit actually recedved by the
company in connection with the producer certificate program.
Because of this, we believe that no matter how this Court de­
cides the other issues in the case, the added reserve fee is
clearly valid under Title V.
How, the other fees at issue here are imposed on an
industry-wide basis, that is the full amount of the fee is first
determined and then it is allocated among the various members
of the industry.

The fee imposed upon the electric utility

companies to pay for the cost of the coordination and reliabil­
ity program relates to beneficial service which is provided to
the entire industry as a whole.

In conducting the coordination

and reliability program, the Commission comprehensively studies
the growing market for electric energy, and it also studies the
ability of the existing generating and transmission facilities
to meet the needs of that market, and this study assists the
companies in planning their capital budgeting and it facilitates

18
their interconnection and cooperation with other electric energy
companies *
As a consequence, they save money, they don’t have to
invest in generating facilities to the extent that they other­
wise would, and moreover, the delivery of electric energy be­
comes more reliable.

The incidence of blackouts and brownouts

is reduced, and this increased reliability of the electric
energy transmitted by the companies enhances the competitiveness
of the companies vis-a-vis other fuel suppliers.
Because of this, it seams fairly clear that this pro­
gram is beneficial to the industry.

Indeed, it seems likely

that if the Commission did not conduct a program of this kind,
the industry as a whole or the various members of the industry
would have to conduct similar programs themselves.

And as I

read their brief, the Mew England Power Company in this case
does not even contend that this program is not beneficial.

Their

contention instead is that the fee is invalid because the pro­
gram is conducted primarily in the public interest for the
public benefit.
As Mr. Korman indicated in the preceding case, the
implication of this argument is simply to read Title V out of
the United States Code.

Every regulatory program is supposed

to be conducted primarily for public benefit.

In enacting

Title V, Congress understood that it was conferring authority
to impose fees for a wide range of regulatory services and

19

activities, required by law to be conducted primarily in the
public benefit»

We see no incompatibility between the Commis­

sion’s authority to impose fees and its responsibility for
regulating in the public interest„
This leaves for discussion the two industry-wide fees
imposed to cover the costs of rate-setting activities or the
residual costs of such activities,
We feel that as to each individual company whose rates
are reviewed and approved by the Commission, there is a direct
benefit conferred.

The approval of the new rate schedule is

analogous to the issuance of a license for the conduct of
business, that is the company could not continue its business
at the higher rate schedule unless it receives the approval of
the Commission.
The respondents, however, seem to make the general
argument that thin kind of benefit is really no benefit at all.
They say that they would be better off with no rate regulation.
We feel'that that is not the issue in this case.

In the first

place, the merits of that argument are far from clear.

These

companies are insulated from destructive competition by the
regulation of the Commission.

The numbers of pipeline compan­

ies, electric utilities are regulated by the Commission and
the kind of competition that might otherwise exist has been
meted out.
But whether or not regulation as such benefits the

industries, and economists might well differ on that point, we
feel that that as such is not the issue here.

Title V, when it

speaks in terms.of the benefit, speaks in terras of benefit con­
ferred within the context of a preexisting regulatory scheme.
Even the Budget circular, which talks in terras of a special
benefit, recognises this because it gives as examples of regu­
latory activities the issuance of licenses, of certificates of
convenience and necessity, inspections, all of which would be
unnecessary without regulation.

These are all benefits which

are conferred only within the context of a preexisting regula­
tory scheme.
And like the issuance of license, the approval of a
rate schedule does confer a benefit within this context.

Indeed,

even the electric utility companies have recognized this because
they raise no objection to the sliding scale fee which is sub­
stantial that the Commission now’ imposes on the filing of new
rate schedules.
Well, this leaves only the contention of the respond­
ents that it is unfair to impose a fee for rate-setting activi­
ties on a company who doesn't file a new rate schedule during
the year.
I would first point out about this contention that it
does not go to the Commission's authority to impose a fee to
recapture the entire amount of rate-setting activities.

That

contention only goes to the reasonableness of the method that

21

the Commission has employed for allocating this fee.

And as we

understand the opinion of the Court of Appeals, which did not
purport to reach questions of reasonableness, that issue is not
one which is before the Court in this case.
We nevertheless feel that the allocation chosen by
the Commission is reasonable.

Each particular company, whether

or not it files a rate schedule during a given year, is going
to file rate schedules from time to time in the long run and,
therefore, it benefits from having the Commission's services
available and it also especially benefits whenever its rate
schedule is considered and approved.
unreasonable to allocate this

And it seems to us not

fee on an annual basis over time

rather than on a filing basis.
If there are no further questions, I would like to
reserve the remainder of my time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Morley?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M. MORLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF GF RESPONDENT INDEPENDENT NATURAL GAS
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA.
MR. MORLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
I am confining ray argument to the portions of the de­

cision of the Court of Appeals which relate to the natural gas
industry.

And I would like to point out at the outset — and I

think it is important that we keep in mind that so far as this
case is concerned as to the natural gas industry, it involves
simply natural gas rate-making costs incurred by the Federal
Power Commission in the regulation of the pipeline industry on
the one hand for its own costs incurred with respect to the
Power Commission's own costs incurred in regulating pipeline
rates, but it is also imposing upon the pipelines the costs in­
curred. by the Federal Power Commission for the regulation of
the producers incurred in connection with their certification
procedures, which are essentially rate-making procedures inas­
much as the only real problem that ever arises with respect to
producer certificates involves the price which they are to re­
ceive for their commodity.
Now, in the Court of Appeals decision, the court
below did not reverse the Federal Power Commission on the basis
that it was rendering benefits not to special beneficiaries but
to the gas industry as a whole.

As is shown in the opinion --

and X am referring to pages 9a and b of the government's
petition for certiorari — it is made abundantly clear that the
court there, was confining itself to this Court's interpretation
in the Hope case and in the so-called

A.TCO case, Atlantic

Refining Company v. Public Service Commission of New York.
Q

What page is that, sir?

MR. MORLEY:

This is in the government's petition for

certiorari, Your Honor, in Appendix A.

What I am looking at,

23

Your Honor,, is at the bottom of pages 9a and the top of 9b.
Q

Thank you,

MR, MORLEY:

And you will notice there in the foot­

note that the Court did determine the Hope and

ATCO cases to

ba controlling inasmuch as it is concluded that the only bene­
fits derived from the Federal Power Commission’s rate-making
actions is for the public benefit, namely the ultimate con­
sumers of the natural gas for whom the Gas

Act was enacted.

Now, when the Court of Appeals decided this case, it
went through the legislative history and made specific reference
to the Federal Power Commission's earlier determination in
Order No. 317, which was a rule-making order, which proposed
for the first time the assessment of fees under the Natural Gas
Act pursuant to the requirements of Title V of the Independent
*

Appropriations Act of 1952 and the Budget Bureau Circular Ho.
A~25»
He there stated that he wholeheartedly concurred with
ther- Commission's interpretation of Title V and Order A-25 in
its earlier rate-making — its earlier notice of fee schedules.
Now, in that notice, it is clear —~ and we have set
it forth, it is set forth in the Court’s opinion at page 10a
of the Appendix to the petition — they there point out that
they have reviewed their functions under the Natural Gas Act
and are of the opinion that the assessment of user charges or
fees with respect to the exercise of the regulatory activities

24
under the Act and accounting provisions would not be appropriate
since these activities are primarily for the benefit of the
general public rather than the regulated companies.

And they

also make clear that they didn't think it was appropriate to
charge the producers the costs of the Commission in administer­
ing the producer programs.
They first pointed out that it was difficult for
administrative convenience and that there was an ~~ in overall
they felt that it did not come within their entitlements under
Title Vo

Now this —
Q

Well, a regulatory agency can and they sometimes

do change their minds about these things, don't they?
MR. MORLEY:

Well, no doubt about it, Your Honor.

However, the Commission passes tills off in their order denying
rehearing as mere dicta of the Commission, as though they had
not given serious consideration to these interpretations of
Title V.

But I submit that if the legislative history of

Title V does show that not only the Commission but the Congress
has given most serious consideration to the very application
of Title V which we are concerned here with today.
Now, the legislative history is rather sparse, and I
assume that the main reason for that is that it was attached
as a rider to an appropriations act and wasn't considered a
serious matter as conferring legislative authority on the
federal agencies.

25
But in any ©rent, it is abundantly clear and is made
— if any doubt exists by the statement of Representative Yates
on the floor of the House when he was discussing Title V of
the Independent Offices Appropriations, and he there makes
specific reference to two agencies, namely the Federal Com­
munications Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Q

What brief are you on now there?

MR. MORLEY:

I am on our brief, the green one, and

it is Appendix B, pages 3a through 5a.

And you will notice on

page 3a, Your Honor, he refers to the type of services for
which they intended to recoup the costs of the government, and
with regard to the Federal Communications Commission he refers
to franchises, licenses, certificates which obviously are
grants to identifiable receipients as is contemplated by Title
V and Budget Circular A-25.
The same is true with respect to his reference on
page 4a to the Interstate Commerce Commission, which makes in­
spections for locomotives of railroads, safety appliances,
signaling systems, and also for the issuance of certificates of
public convenience and necessity for bus lines and other common
carriers — clearly identifiable receipients of special
services rendered in their behalf.
Now, after the enactment of Title V, the Budget
Bureau, on November 5, 1953, issued its first circular which
was also designated A-25, but that circular was superseded by

26

r

the on® which we are here concerned with, which was adopted on.
September 23 , .1959,
Shortly after the promulgation of the Budget circular,
the Federal Power Commission got out its first notice of pro­
posed rule-making for the assessment of fees.
or February 3r 1954,

That was issued

And they therein proposed a rule-making

to prescribe fees for the filing and processing of export-import
authorizations under the Natural Gas Act and also for the
charging of fees for certificates of public convenience and
necessity under section 7.
Now, there is a great deal of consideration given and
discussions in the Senate’s Report No. 1467, which we have
referred to in our brief at page 22.

This report was adopted

on February 1, 1956, pursuant to Senate Resolution 140.

And in

those hearings, the Senate committee was considering the very
question of these fees and whether or not they should be done
in a manner prescribed by Title V or whether or not there
should be individual legislation enacted which would be directed
to each of the individual agencies.

And in the course of the

hearings that were held, the Senate Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce adopted a resolution stating it was the sense
of the committee that the agencies under its jurisdiction —
which obviously included the Federal Power Commission — should
suspend until July 1, 1955 any pending or proposed proceeding
involving the imposition of fees and charges pursuant to

27
Title

v.
Then Senator Bricker also stated on the floor of the

Senate at about this same time that the Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce is of the unanimous opinion that such a
proposal for assessing fees raises basic questions with regard
to the fundamental philosophy of regulation.

"The committee

feels that the Congress should set up the basic standards for
each agency to follow in imposing charges for licenses."
So in the course of the hearings

,

the then Chairman

of the Federal Power Commission, Mr. Kuykendall, wrote a letter
to Senator McClellan, then Chairman of the Committee on
Government Operations, in which he responded to a request from
the Federal Power Commission respecting the status of fees
charges as a. result of the enactment of Title V.
Mr. Kuykendall referred Chairman McClellan to the fact
that they had issued the earlier rule-making notice, which I
have referred to. and then stated that "that proceeding" —
the initial rule-making proceeding — "is still pending but
lies dormant, in view of the resolution of the Senate Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce that such proceedings should
be suspended until July 1, 1955, and the introduction of the
Brooke bill, S. 2203, in the 03rd Congress, prohibiting other
than nominal fees."
Then Chairman Kuykendall concluded that. Title V does
not provide a sufficiently explicit expression from Congress

28
with respect to method of attaining the goal of self-sustaining.
What seems lacking, he stated, is the necessary particularity
as to the distinction between "services" to particular groups
and service to the public interest.»
Q

This completely separates those things into

tight little compartments in a regulatory agency, Mr. Morley.
Some things benefit both the public and the regulated industry,
some are more particularly for the public, some are more par­
ticularly for the benefit of the industry.
MR. MORLEY:

Is that not true?

There is no question about it, Your

Honor, in that regard though.

But what we are concerned here

with so far as the natural gas pipeline industry is concerned
are rate matters, the annual fee assessment for their pipeline
programs which they say is the cost for administering the ratemaking —■
Q

Now, doesn't that benefit both the public and the

utility?
MR. MORLEY:
Q

Not in my opinion, Your Honor.

Doesn’t it fix an assured return on a particular

formula?
MR. MORLEY:

No, it doesn't.

The Federal Power Com­

mission says, what they do, they can't guarantee you a profit.
They will give you the opportunity to make a profit, but. that
doesn't mean that you are necessarily going to do it.
sure enough, they fix —

Now,

Q

Well, some of it depends on management then.

MR. MORLEY:
Q

Beg your pardon?

Some of it depends on management.

But within

the framework, there is a formula that is designed to give a
profit, is there not?
MR. MORLEY;

Well, I think the situation is more or

less like Mr. Justice Brennan put it earlier, that this isn't
sort of a B3„ue Cross plan.
0

There are a lot of people --

That was Mr. Justice Stewart's conception of

Blue Cross-Blue Shield.
MR. MORLEY:

Excuse me — that we are

aced here

with an industry which many pipeline companies don’t have a
rate case for years, and other pipeline companies will have
several in one year, and now the whole industry is not going
to benefit because one company is having difficulty raising its
revenues and maintaining an adequate stability to its economic
environment.

I don’t think that it necessarily follows that

the whole industry — 1 think it doesn’t follow that the whole
industry benefits from any of the rate-making activities of the
Federal Power Commission.

It is not ray position, as stated by

counsel for the government, that INGAA is saying that there
should not foe any rate regulation.

We don’t say that.

We say

that the cost of it is incurred for the benefit of the ultimate
consumers for whom this Court has said the Natual Gas Act was
enacted.

30

Q

Hr. Morley, in your brief, the statement of

Congressman Yates that you were reading from earlier, in Appendix
B, at page 4a, the first kind of home-spun example he gives of
the type of thing he is talking about there, at the end of the
first paragraph on 4a, is the Chicago elevator inspection pro­
gram in his home town, and he says this is the kind of thing that
the City of Chicago required a license from each elevator owner
from in order to underwrite the cost of this inspection.

Well,

certainly that inspection is for the benefit of the public,
isn't it, and rot for the benefit of the individual elevator
owner?
MR. MORLEY:

Well, if Your Honor please, 1 don’t con­

sider this apropos of the problem of the natural gas industry
being regulated in its rates.

Obviously, elevator inspections

are for the benefit of the public.
Q

And yet that is the example that he cites as be­

ing the first example that comes to mind in the whole bit.
MR. MORLEY:

Well, he has more -- this is sort of an

aside, as I read the thing.

He is more concerned with the

Federal Communications Commission and the Interstate Commerce
Commission.

How, there is no question that this man, when he

pays his fee to have his elevator inspected, he has got to have
it as a prerequisite to getting to putting the thing into oper­
ation, just like a pipeline has to get a certificate of

.public

convenience and necessity to operate in interstate commerce.

31
We're not challenging those fees.
Q

But on the point of benefit, there simply isn't

any real benefit to the elevator owner.
MR. MORLEY:

Well, there is a benefit to the extent

that he is permitted to operate his elevator.
Q
I suppose.

Well, you can say that about any type of thing,
But so far as conferring soma sort of an affirma­

tive benefit, this would strike me at any rate as being some­
thing that is just completely for the public, and yet Congress­
man Yates thought it was clearly the kind of thing that would
be included under Title V.
MR. MORLEYj

Well, it is our view that the ultimate

consumers who are the beneficiaries of rate regulation under
the Natural Gas Act, the activity has been undertaken for them,
the benefit goes to them, and they are the ones that should pay
for it.

The natural gas pipeline company, what benefit does he

receive from a rate reduction or a rate increase of less than
what lie thought was appropriate?

He is not benefiting by that,

and 1 —
Q

Well, the elevator owner can make exactly the

same point though, can’t he, and yet apparently that wouldn't
have been good enough for Congressman Yates.
MR. MGRLEY:

I don't think so, because in my view,

with all due deference to your own view, I think that this is
more analogous to a certificate applicant before the Federal

32
Power Commission,, the elevator owner is more comparable to a
pipeline seeking a certificate than is the elevator operator
with his tern its in the building.
Q

Now, what Congressman Yates thought perhaps was

what followf in the very next succeeding paragraph;

"The

Interstate rorcaerce Commission is required to inspect locomotives
of railroacs, safety appliances, signaling systems, various
facility r of that type." "In addition to that, much of the work
of t'b.j -omission is involved with hearings/’ and so forth.
Npw, you said the government pays every cent for this
1 -ration, i.e., the inspections, the safety inspections under
irne Safety Appliance Act, I suppose.

That perhaps was the

analogy that Congressman Yates saw to the inspection of elevators
in his home town of Chicago, and that you submit is quite dif­
ferent from rate regulation.
. i:'V?

MR. MORLEY;
Q

I do, Your Honor.

All right.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Morley, if my calcula­

tions are correct, I think you are impinging on Mr. Debevoise’s
time.
MR. MORLEY:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

I just want to

say one thing, that in connection with the request of both
Your Honor and Mr. Justice Stewart, the ICC does assess fees
for activities such as are mentioned here in Congressman Yates *
statement, but they do not assess fees for the costs of their

33

rate-making activities, and the same is true with respect to
the Federal Communications Commission, that it does not have
any fee assessments for its common carrier rate activities.
And with respect to Your Honor's question about the
situation with respect to Budget Circular A-25, you will find
in the Senate report to which X have made frequent reference,
No. 1467, 84fch Congress, that that Budget Bureau circular was
circulated to all of the federal agencies, including the
Federal Power Commission, and notice is taken of it by the
congressional committee in this report, so I think that that
doss indicate some congressional sanction of the application
of it to Federal Power activities.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Debevoise?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. DEBEVOISE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT NEW ENGLAND POWER COMPANY
MR. DEBEVOISE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
In the time before lunch, I will try to get you to
think in completely different concepts under an act which has
no similarity basically to the ones you have heard so far this
morning and an industry that is not regulated at the federal
level in any way, shape or form like the ones you have just
bean hearing about.
The Federal Power Act gives the Commission no

34

licensing authority over any facility; contrary to what govern­
ment counsel stated this morning, the Federal Power Act does not
let the Commission insulate the electric utility from, destruc­
tive competition»

In the period since it was passed, the com­

panies regulated by the Commission have had its share of the
market decreased by over 20 percent.

It does not have compre­

hensive rate jurisdiction over the industry.
Q

From what source is the competition that you are

suggesting?
HR, DEBEVOISE:
dustry, Your Slonor.

It is from the other parts of the in­

In the case of your natural gas pipelines,

the Commission regulates the whole industry.

That is not true

of the electric utility industry.
There were, when the Act was passed, already in exis­
tence public, local public agencies.
2,000.

Today their number is over

There were just starting in 1935 REA cooperatives.

Today their number is 960,

The federal government dam building

program was just starting,

TVA had not yet expanded to take

over the northern part of Alabama and the parts of Kentucky and
other places that it has today.
Now, as far as rate jurisdiction is concerned —
Q

When you say they are not protected from compe­

tition, do you mean within their own area, or they are not pro­
tected from competition in the sense that they can’t expand into
areas where, for example, the REA or TVA is operating or

municipal ownership?
MR. DEBEVOISE: I am speaking of it in FPC terms.
Their only jurisdiction is over sales from one utility system
to another.

Now, they will not protect a company such as

Ottertail Power Company;, which you had before you, from having
the other systems which it serves taken away from them.
is no way they can.

There

As the federal dams have been built, with

low-cost federal power', more and more of the smaller systems
have naturally desired and been able to switch to taking the
federal power, to which they get preference.
I mean.

And this is what

There have been new local public agencies established

just as there have cooperatives.

A retail service area in most

areas that I know of is free to elect to oust the electric
utility that is serving them, if it is an investor-owned
company, at the end of its franchise, or otherwise, and to set
up a system.

There is no market protection for the electric

utility industry under the Federal Power Act.
Now, this is true because of the history of the de­
velopment of the industry.

By 1935, when the Federal Power

Act was passed, the industry was already in existence, it
already was regulated extensively at the state level, federal
regulation came about for two reasons in the Public Utility Act
of 1935,

One was to give some regulation for the benefit of

investors over the mushrooming holding company systems which
were competing with one another for retail properties across

36

the country, and in some instances were abusing financial
accounting and other records to the detriment of investors.
That was part one, the Public Utility Holding Company Act.
Part two of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
was the Federal Power Act, and here the effort was just to
regulate at the federal level those parts of the electric utility business which it was felt the States could not regulate,
and it spelled out right in section 201 that the regulation is
limited to the interstate transmission and sale in interstate
commerce of electric energy.
The Federal Power Commission has no jurisdiction under
parts two and three over any generating station, it has no
certification authority over any transmission line, it does not
regulate any rates except the interstate rates of the local
power compani.es.
Noxv, until 1965, and your decision in Southern
California Edison case, the percentage of revenues over which
the FPC even claimed jurisdiction was down around two or three
percent.

Today they claim jurisdiction over seven percent of

the revenues of the electric utility industry.

They have

jurisdiction over none of the revenues of some of the companies
they regulate, because, again contrary to what the government
said this morning, every public utility subject to FPC juris­
diction does not have rate schedules on file with the FPC be­
cause they do not sell in some cases to other public utilities.

37

No counsel up to now has intimated that the

Fifth Circuit might have been correct and that the D.C. Circuit
might have been correct,

and I wonder if after lunch, if you

have any views on that that you would care to suggest if you
would address yourself to them.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there after

lunch.
[Whereupon, at. 12 o’clock noon the court was re­
cessed until 1:00 o'clock p.m.]

AFTERNOON SESSION - 1:00 O'CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Debevoise, you may

proceed.
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Mr. Chief Justice, to turn directly

to your question, it is our position that if the certificate of
compliance that was discussed this morning is a license or
certificate, there is no conflict between the two circuits.
Now, turning to the other agency practices which
Justice Stewart mentioned this morning, on page 47 of our brief*
there is a listing of them.

The only one that I am aware of

that has taken full advantage of Title V for annual licenses is
the Atonic Energy Commission.

There they do charge annual —

make annual charges that cover two licensees, that cover the
regulatory costs associated with the processing of licenses
and health and safety compliance and inspection activities.
They do not attempt to charge back in those annual fees the
costs related to rule-making, development of standards, codes
and criteria, safeguard activities, and the administration of
state relation programs.

But the costs directly associated with

their licensing program they do charge back under Title V.
And there is an error in our brief on page 47, in the
second paragraph, where we refer to such charges as — page 47,
in the first full paragraph, line seven, the word "nominal"
should be stricken.

There is nothing nominal about the AEC

annual fees to licensees.

39

Now, NEPCO has one peculiarity from the rest of the
companies regulated by the Commission.

I have told you that

the industry as a whole, only seven percent of their revenues
are regulated by the Federal Power Commission.

In NEPCO!s case,

as a member of a holding company, where it supplies the dis­
tribution affiliates, the FPC regulates almost 100 percent of
their rates, and this becomes important a little further.
But let us turn now to just what the FPC does regu­
late.

First, they have the authority to regulate exports of

electric energy from the country.

There are very few of the

industry which are in a position or location to export.
Second, they have the authority to approve mergers
of facilities or the accepting of securities of another system,
but that is only where there are jurisdictional facilities
involved that excludes generation, excludes distribution, and
it is only where the SEC doesn’t, have jurisdiction under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act.

Again, it is not a section

that has many applications during the year.
Next, they have jurisdiction over security issuances
by public utilities, but only over those public utilities which
are not organized and operating in a stats which regulates
their security issuances.

There are very few of such com­

panies .
Next, they have

rate jurisdiction again only over

interstate energy transactions which, as I have mentioned,

40
amounts to seven percent of the industry’s revenues on a com­
bined basis.

Now, when I say industry revenues there, I am

including revenues from investor owned utilities that are large
and are not subject, to the FPC jurisdiction at all.

The util­

ities in Texas, for instance, which are not interconnected
ac.rcss the state line, they are not subject to FPC jurisdiction
and their rates to other utilities are not regulated by the FPC
Now, these are the regulatory activities of the
Federal Power Commission over the electric utility industry,
and it is the cost of these activities which are not covered by
the filing fees they have established, substantial filing fees
in the case of rate cases, that they wish to recover back from
the industry as a whole, those that are subject to their juris­
diction on the basis of the kilowatts hours of jurisdictional
energy transmitted or sold by those utilities.
I submit that for most of those sections, there’s no
application to most of the utilities subject to the FPC juris­
diction.

In connection with the rate regulation, it is the

buying systems, the several thousand systems which are not
subject to FPC jurisdiction, which are the beneficiaries, it is
they who go before the appropriations committees and urge more
funds for the FPC for rate regulations.
Now, the FPC, in talking about the benefits which the
industry receives from its rate regulation, said that it is
redounded to the benefit of the electrics by creating the

41
economic climate for greater usage which in turn strengthens
their financial stability and their ability to sell debt and
equity securities.

It is this economic climate which the court

below very nicely, without going into it, said was not suf­
ficiently defined to be a special benefit to the electrics.
And just what does the PPG mean?

As I told you be­

fore, until “65 in the Southern California Edison case, you
were talking about a couple of percent of the revenues of the
electric utility industry.

Actually, when Chairman Swidler

came on board in *61, there was one man at the FPC looking at
rates of electric utilities.
percentage of their revenues.

We are talking about a small
The sales go, of the major

categories, 48 percent to industrial customers, 22 percent to
commercial.

Does the FPC claim that they have created the

economic climate by their rate regulation of the electric
utility industry that has caused the industrial expansion of
the last twenty years?

That appears to be what they are doing.

But they go further, and they say that it has
strengthened their financial stability and their ability to
sell debt and equity securities.

Well, NEPCO, as I told you,

is 100 percent rate regulated by the FPC,

There is an FPC

order of March 7, 1972, at 47 FPC 732, where the FPC had to
admit that because they listened to NEPCO * s customers in 1971,
that NEPCO had been unable to sell any debt securities or
preferred stock for a period of eight months, and they had to

42
grant them emergency relief.
Now, most investor owned utilities are not subject to
this kind of rate regulation jurisdiction by the FPC, but cer­
tainly the rate regulation jurisdiction has not created an
economic benefit to the companies which are subject.
Now, the government misstated our position when he
said that because part two does not specifically authorise a
fee,

we say Title V cannot be applied.

That is not what we

say.

We said that the subject was before Congress in 1935 of

charging fees under parts two and three, that they specific­
ally amended section 10(e) of part one under which the FPC does
charge all of its costs of administration of part one against
licensees.

They specifically amended it and, in doing so,

specifically stated that they were limiting the costs of
administration to be recovered through fees to part one.

That

was enacted, and that is legislative history at page 11 of our
brief in 1935.
So we have the case of Congress specifically having
it under consideration and then specifically saying just what
the FPC could charge fees for under parts two and three, which
they then spelled out in section 312 of the Act.

And under

section 312, the FPC was limited by Congress to charges for
special statistical services and other special or periodic
services.
Q

That is the rule of 1935, is it?

43
MR. DEBEVOISE:

Yes.

Now, in addition to these regulatory features, the
FPC increasingly in recent years has been getting into the
matter of coordination and reliability.

They do so under the

authority of section 202(a) and there is specific authority in
section 311 where they are required to compile all sorts of
facts and information on the industry to have it available for
Congress.
Now, we have heard this morning that their activities
under this part have saved us money, have meant we do not have
to invest as much, have meant that wa have become more reliable,
and enhances our coapetiveness.

I would say that there is

absolutely nothing in the record to support anything of that
kind, and in a minute I will read to you from their publica­
tions as to what their program is all about.
The one thing that was said that was entirely accurate
is that their program consists of monitoring the industry.
They attend our regional reliability councils, they don't get
involved with the engineering in-depth, they ask the industry
to set up task forces to provide them with the information,
they coordinate it and correlate it and report it to the
Congress and to the American public.
Now, I am not saying there is no benefit when you are
regulated to have this exchange, but I am saying that their
program is not designed and does not directly benefit the

44
industry.
In connection with that, if I could read to you just
two excerpts from the National Power Surveys, the National Power
S\arvey is a major undertaking by the Federal Power Commission
in cooperation with advisory committees drawn from all segments
of the electric power industry to give greater impetus to the
trend toward integration of the Nation's power systems?
"In our opinion, the technology of large-scale generat­
ing stations and extra high voltage transmission interconnections
has now reached the stage where closer coordination of construc­
tion plans and operations of individual systems in the industry
is highly feasible and necessary if the consuming public is to
receive the benefits of lower cost electricity which our tech­
nology nov; makes possible."
Now, this is the thrust and purpose of the FederalPower Act and everything they have dons, lower costs of elec­
tricity.

They go on:

"At stake by 1980 are possible savings

of as much as $11 billion a year to the American consumer,"
not to industry.

It is not their thought that by taking

advantage of technology, stockholders could line their pockets
if stockholders are equated with the industry.

It is savings

to the consumers, the uniform systems of accounts, the account­
ing regulations which throw cost to the future and £low-through
benefits today are all designed to benefit the consumer.
As far as the stockholders are concerned, in NEPCO's

case, you could sell your stock now for six percent less than
you could ten years ago, on an equivalent basis, under regula­
tion by the Federal Power Commission»

It is not the industry

which has benefited by these things.
Now, going further, where FPC regulation is sup­
posed to have, made the public feel secure in the reliability
of our systems, you go to the !70 survey, where they say, "In
a very real sense, electric power is the lifeblood of a. modern
nation.

Axiomatic to this point is another, namely that it

is one thing to take electricity for granted, as all of us
have come to do in our daily lives, but quite a different thing
to take for granted that it will always continue to be avail­
able."

And the FPC has no control over whether or not it

does continue to be available, even in the segment of the
industry that they regulate.

They cannot order a generating

station to be built, they cannot order a transmission line to
be built.
So I think it is appropriate to refer to the legis­
lative history that is set forth in Tennessee Pipeline5s brief,
Tennessee Gas Pipeline, at length, from the Senate report, it
is at page 28 of their brief, where there is joint benefit to
a particular beneficiary and to all of the people, the costs
should be equitably divided.

And where there is doubt as to

the degree or preponderance of benefit, there should be no fee.
Hera I would say on this record there is considerable

46

doubt, and I would like to, in closing, quote the next sen­
tence from the one cited by the government in connection with
their authority to change their mind.

The next sentence in

the City of Chicago case from the one the government cited is,
"What is required by the rule of law is that agency policies
and standards, whether or not modification of previous policies,
be reasonable and nondiscriminatory and flow rationally from
findings that are reasonable inferences from substantial evi­
dence ."
How, this economic climate benefit is without any
substantial evidence whatsoever and does not constitute a
reasonable infference once you have determined that their role
in regulating the industry is so small.
In this case, we have not objected to the fees for
applications in those limited areas where they have authority.
We do object to paying or having our customers pay the costs of
their whole program.

To the extent there is any meaning to it

being a benefit to the industry, it is the customers of all
the electric utilities in the country which should pay.

At

the moment they do pay, based on ability to pay through our
taxing statutes.

To now say that the customers of investor -

owned utilities should pay all of these costs because of some
benefit to them makes no sense "whatsoever.

TVA, the coopera­

tives , the municipal generating systems, they all participate
in the national power surveys, in the reliability councils,

47
we are all interconnected, the customers of the small munici­
pals that we serve, they benefit just as much from reliability
to -die degree that the FPC promotes it; there is no reason
whatsoever, and Title V does not authorise the switching of
these costs to just the custoraersof the investor-owned systems.
Q

Mr. Debevoise, would you think there is any

difference in approach to the application of Title V to utili­
ties whose rates are regulated and to broadcasters whose rates
are not regulated?

Is there any basis for distinction on that

score?
MR. DEBEVOISE;

I think there is a large distinction,

which maybe I was too concice on, to the extent that we are
talking about license fees, where the government gives you
authority.

It seems to me. Title V clearly applies.

Now, as

I understand the CATV, there is ho rate regulation there.
think there is a big difference.

I

I think your rate regula­

tion and the implementation of government policy of the FPC
to keep electric rates as low as possible, those they have
jurisdiction over, is something that can hardly be said to be
a special benefit to the regulated, and is certainly more a
matter of government policy and a benefit to the purchasers
of power.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Debevoise.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Jones?

that there are some electric utility companies subject to the
regulation of the Commission which do not file rate schedules.
We are not aware of any such companies.

If is our understanding

that the jurisdiction of the Commission which runs to the sales
for resale in interstate commerce would require the filing of
rate schedules with respect to such sales.

However, even

assuming that there might be from time to time a company for
some reason which did not file a rate schedule, nevertheless
the validity of this fee would be a matter of -— the applica­
tion of this fee to that company would be a question of

49

the reasonableness of the allocation of the fee.

That does not

go to the Commission’s authority under Title V to impose a fee
covering the cost of rate setting activities.
Third,, the electric utility company also suggests
that, contrary to my statement and earlier argument, the Com­
mission does not insulate them from

competition in any way.

To the contrary, this Court, held last terra, in the Gulf States
case, that the Commission must consider the competitive conse­
quences of any activity subject to its regulation, and it must
act in accordance with what is necessary from a competitive
point of view in opposing anticompetitive activity by certain
of the utilities.
And, fourth, once again, the electric utility company
challenges the Commissioner's assertion that the eoordination
and raliability program is of benefit to the utilities.

And

I would simply point out in this connection that this Court,
in the Gainesville Utilities case, acknowledged that the
interconnection which is ordered by the Commission in connec­
tion with this program was of signal benefit to the electric
utility companies because it permitted them to draw upon the
power resources of other companies in times of need and save
them from the major expense of constructing adequate generat­
ing facilities to cover all of their hypothetical needs.
And, last, once again, the contention is made that
Title V itself extends no authority

whatsoever to the Federal

50
Power Commission.

But. the New England Power Company, in making

this assertion, is in fact being inconsistent because they
themselves acknowledge that the Federal Power Commission does
have authority under Title V to assess fees for the filing of
new rate schedules.

Title V is the only origin of that

authority exercised by the Commission.
We feel that the question here is not whether the
Commission has authority, whether that authority extends to
the fees here, and we believe, for the reasons that I have
stated/ that it does.
If there are no further questions, I am finished.
Thank you.
