DINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

next in three consolidated cases, 73-437, Mobil Oil against
Federal Power; 73-457, Public Service Commission against
Federal Power; and 73-464, Municipal Distributors against
Federal Power*
Mr. Gilliam.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARROLL L. GILLIAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER MOBIL OIL CORPORATION
MR. GILLIAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
I argue for Petitioner Mobil Oil Corporation only.
There are differences as to position and results sought by
petitioners.
These cases come from the Fifth Circuit, and arise
under Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act, and involve
rates for natural gas producers.
' ■r

The proceedings before the Commission were to fix
such rates for the Southern Louisiana area, both onshore and
offshore, an area that now supplies approximately one-third of
the nation's interstate supply of natural gas.
As the issues reach this Court, the subject matter
involves, first, a fund of approximately $375 million, which
were amounts collected by producers in the area prior to
August 1, 1971

The ease also involves a rate structure that fixes
charges be made by producers to pipeline purchasers of
something in excess of $1 billion annually for each of the
years after August 1, 1971, and under a rate structure that
extends, by terms, to 1976 and 1977.
These two branches of the case became intertwined
before the Commission, and the background lies in two separate
area rate cases, two Commission opinions, and now two opinions
by the Fifth Circuit.
The first area rate case for Southern Louisiana was
initiated in 1961.

This led to what is denoted Commission

Opinion No. 546, issued in 1968.

That was followed by review

in tiie Fifth Circuit, and opinions that are referred to in
the briefs as the Austral case or Southern Louisiana I.
That opinion was an affirmance of Opinion No. 546,
but included language in the initial opinion, and in a later
opinion by the Fifth Circuit denying petitions for rehearing,
that give rise to the issues that are raised by the other
petitioners, the Municipal Distributors Group and New York,
as to the Commission's power thereafter to reopen the rates
fixed by that opinion, and to revise them.
Those questions will be covered by Mr. Morrow.
The second Southern Louisiana area rate case
produced the opinion which is now here, denoted Commission
Opinion No. 598.

This proceeding was initiated in 1969 before

5
review of the first opinion had been completed.
At first it was restricted to rates for new contracts,
for new sales from the federal offshore domain only.

Later

Commission orders expanded the scope of the proceeding to
include all producer sales in Southern Louisiana, and after
the Austral decision by the Fifth Circuit, the Commission
also enlarged the docket to include the issues of revision
of the rates that had been fixed by the first opinion, and
to include the issues of disposition of refund liabilities
that had, would have been fixed by the rates in the Commis­
sion's first opinion.
The proceeding before the Commission was before a
Hearing Examiner, it was an adjudicatory type hearing.

The

cost data in the record are essentially the 1969 test year.
There are tiro major types, one is what is called historical
cost of flowing gas *— this ultimately became the cost used
to fix rates for contracts dated prior to October 1, 1968.
The second major type of cost is the so-called
current cost.

This ultimately was. used with reference to

rates for what is called new gas, and in this case that
cJ.assification is gas sold on the contracts dated after
October 1, 1968.
There was other extensive evidence of economic,
financial, supply-demand nature, of the type that this Court
reviewed in the Permian case.

6
There were conferences and then hearings before
the Examiner, beginning in 1969, and continuing to March 1971.
While the hearing was in progress, a settlement
conference was initiated under the Commission's rules»

This

conference is held off the record, and all parties to a given
proceeding are invited to participate.
Those conferences resulted in the filing of a
motion with the Commission by a group of distribution
companies, referred to in the briefs here as United Distribu­
tion Companies, or UDC.
The motion was submitted in November 1970, asking
the Commission to approve a proposed settlement, which was
appended to the motion.

The Commission then issued notice

of that and provided for the filing of comments.
The comments indicated very wide support to the
settlement from major producers in the area, pipeline
purchasers, distribution companies in two groups, and some
State commissions.
However, the settlement was opposed by Mobil, by
another major producer in the area, in some small details by
other producers; it was also opposed by the Public Service
Commission for the State of New York, the Municipal
Distributors, the American Public Gas Association, the
American Public Power Association, and the Consumer Federation
of America..

7
On December 24, 1970., the Commission issued an
order that made the settlement proposal a part of the record,
and provided that opponents could present in the hearings
that were still going on before the Hearing Examiner the
reasons or bases for their objections.
This hearing continued to conclusion in March 1971,
the Examiner's decision was omitted, briefs were filed
directly to the Commission, there was no oral argument; and
the Commission issued its Opinion No* 598, the opinion now
here, on July 16, 1971,
This adopted the settlement proposal in its entirety.
It has specific features that give rise to the issues now
raised here by Mobil.

As to the past, that is, this fund of

collections prior to Augxist 1, 1971, the Commission adopted
a formula set out in the settlement proposal to dispose of
refund liabilities.
Specific rates were fixed for the past period,
Amounts collected by individual producers in excess of those
rates were not to be refunded, but were to be retained as
working capital and subject to future discharge by
dedication of new reserves in the area.
As to the future, that is the period after August
1, 1971, the Commission adopted precisely a two-part rate
structure that was set out in the settlement,

Rates were

prescribed for flowing gas, that is rates for sales under

8

contracts dated prior to October 1, 1968, a fixed excalation
in October 1973 was provided, and a system was included for
contingent escalations up to a total of 1.5 cents up to 1977,
if by that time the industry as a whole dedicates certain
specified quantities of new gas in the area.
But on one of the points we raise here, that
contingent escalation formula excludes from the reserves that
will be counted the reserves that are used by individual
companies to discharge their own refund liabilities, and it
requires those of us, such as Mobil, which have small refund
liabilities to, in effect, earn these escalations which are
then allowed for all others.
The rate structure also includes a separate rate for
new gas, that is sales under contracts dated after October 1,
1968, and a moratorium on increases in rates under Section 4
of the Act, extending to October 1, 1976 for flowing gas,
and October 1, 1977 for the new gas.
Other provisions that we have raised and discussed
in our briefs were included precisely as set out in the
settlement.
The opponents of the settlement sought rehearing, as
required by Section 19(a) of the Natural Gas Act.

This was

denied by Commission Opinion 598“A, in which the Commission
reiterated that it adopted the settlement proposal in its
entirety.

9

Review in the Fifth Circuit followed.
Commission's opinion was affirmed.

The

In August 1973, however,

the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the Commission as to
an identical rate structure which the Commission had imposed
in the Texas Gulf Coast area, finding essential elements of
this rate structure in conflict with the standards of
Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act.
The proceedings in this Court then followed.
Now, the issues raised by Mobil go both to what we
term the invalid end result, impact, and consequences in this
case under the standards this Court set out in the Hope test
in 1944, and in its review of the first area rate cases, the
Permian Basin decision in 1968.
The issues we raise also go to the invalidity of
essential elements of this rate structure.

In our view the

District of Columbia Circuit opinion, which is before this
Court, is correct? this structure violates express standards
of Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act, which prohibit
unjust and xmreasonable rates, and also prohibit unduly
discriminatory and unduly preferential rate structures.
In addition, as our briefs indicate, there are
substantial parts of the Corfimission's opinion in this case,
which do not include any of the findings that this Court
indicated .in both Hope and in Permian are required for valid
rates under the Natural Gas Act.

10
How, in particulars as to our view on the discrimin­
atory and preferential nature of this rate structure, it
begins with this treatment of refunds for the past period,
and it carries on from that over into the rates prescribed
for present and future.
By the treatment of refunds, the Commission has, in
effect, in this case adopted a rate structure which prefers
the producers who in the past, collected the highest rates,
who did not follow Commission guidelines and policies between
1360 and 1968.

It provides those producers additional and

special working capital available in the present and in the
future for use in competitive bidding and other operations,
and this same formula is tied to the flowing gas rates that
were fixed here for the present and the future.
f

We cite in our briefs specific parts of the
Commission’ s opinion which reflect that the Commission treated
its present and future allowance for exploration and
development capital, and the other capital allowances in the
flowing gas rates, as in part satisfied by this special
allowance of working capital to the few producers who owed
the large refunds.
As we cited in our brief, there are ~ they are
quite disproportionate, they do not — are not proportional
among producers in the area, and only a handful of the
psroducers owe the bulk of the refunds.

But under this rate

11

structure, both as to past, present and future, the incentives
and the benefits the Commission has allowed are channeled
straight to those few producers, and they are not allowed to
the remaining producers in the area.
Now, in particular
QUESTION:
upon the consumer?

What would be the effect, Mr. Gilliam,
I take it they feel that the refund

system will -- what

penalize the old consumer and help

the current one?
MR. GILLIAM:

Your Honor, of course Mr. Morrow will

address this question from the viewpoint of the consumers,
but in the District of Columbia Circuit opinion, the
opinion notes that this is adverse both to the interest of
producers in the area,the old producers, such as Mobil, and
adverse to new entrants, and adverse to the competitive
structure in the area, and therefore would be adverse to the
ultimate benefits that consumers should expect in the sense
of the two objectives of the statute, which are reasonable
rates and

an adequate supply.
Now, the analysis of chat in the Texas Gulf opinion,

from the District of Columbia Circuit, is quite detailed.
We rely on that quite heavily, and I think it does cover this
problem which we raise of undue discrimination and preference,
both from the viewpoint of the affected producer and from
the viewpoint of the ultimate consumer.

12

And in that opinion the basis for the opinion by
trie District of Columbia Circuit rested, of course, on the
statutory standard, but on the adverse impact on both of the
most affected interests. .
How, in the analysis of this rate structure, every­
thing for present and future that we attacked as being too
low or not a high enough reasonable rate, not high enough
current allowance, at 1969 and 1971 costs.

Every tiling was

justified all along the way by a "Yes, but we made those
allowances in the treatment of refunds."
But then when you look at that, those allowances go
iii only a few directions, those who followed the past policy
are somewhat left out in the cold, so to speak.

It even comes

in the opinion before the Fifth Circuit on the moratorium.
In the Permian case, this Court spelled out certain
tilings the Commission should find when it imposes a moratorium
on rate increases, such as projected stability of cost, trends
as to rising costs? in this instance it would have been looking
toward the Seventies.
Here we have only five lines in the Commission opinion,
which establish a moratorium from August 1971 to 1976 and .1977
in one of the nation’s most critical areas.

There is not one

word in those five lines about whether cost could be expected
to rise, whether capital requirements would be greater, or so
on.

13
And yet the Fifth Circuit opinion, in looking at
our objection to that and comparing it with what this Court
said in Permian, the Fifth Circuit says:

All, yes, but

somehow that is compensated for by the refund allowances that
were permitted under this rate structure.
But I would suggest that is no compensation to those
producers who did not collect those rates in the past and
it's an intermixture, an intertwined effort to tie together
a rate structure to protect refund liabilities for a handful
of companies, but in so doing the Commission has mixed it up
with xtfhat should be current and future just and reasonable
rates for the entire area industry.

It has used that also

to lay down a moratorium on the whole area, and has done it
in a period when even this record, which cut off in 1971,
indicated that we already were in a natural gas shortage,
it indicated that the heaviest demands for capital on this
industry that have ever existed would arise in the 1970's,
and when the drilling effort increasingly must be directed
toward greater offshore distances, deeper drilling, and so
on.
Now, with that we have the Commission simply
adopting a rate structure that, in our view, was tailormade
to benefit only a handful of people who had collected, as we
say, the highest rates from 1960 through 1968.
There are other issues that we have raised that deal

14

with particular parts of the settlement agreement, one of them
I've mentioned;

the moratorium.

We also have brought the question of the Commission's
refusal to make an adequate allowance for our royalty payments.
In Southern Louisiana, the producers' payments of royalty to
others, including governmental institutions, are some 16 per­
cent of total revenues, and the Commission has put together
a rate structure here that (a) was based on an assumption
years ago that its own rate jurisdiction extended to control
of the level of royalty payment.

That assumption by the

Commission some years ago was held to be invalid, and yet the
Commission still is prescribing rates on the assumption that
the royalty payment is controlled, or a function of the rate
fixed by the Commission,
We have submitted that the Commission errs in not
allowing an adjustment clause in the rates, where the producer
is required to pay government or someone on market value,
if that escalation be permitted.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We'll not ask you to

split your argument on a minute and a half here? we'll let you
start after lunch, unless you'd
HR. MORROW:

prefer to go ahead.

I have one matter before my argument,

if I might take it up with the Court?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Yes.

15
MR. MORROW;

IJe have not yet. filed a reply brief to

te brief of the government and the other parties, because the
government's brief v;as late.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You will be allowed to

file —
MR. MORROW;

With the Court's permission, we v?ill

file one sometime today when it comes from the printer.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

That's of course at least

one of the factors that entered into the sua sponte decision
to give you a little bit more time,
I might add there's no compulsion on either of you
to use all tliat time.
MR. MORROW;

We appreciate that, Your Honor.

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:02 p.m„]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Morrow, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE E. MORROW, ESQ.„
ON BEHAI.F OF PETITIONERS PUBLIC SERVICE
COMMISSION OF NEW YORK AND MUNICIPAL
DISTRIBUTORS GROUP.
MR. MORROW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court:
My name is George Morrow, and I represent the
Municipal Distributors Group in this case, which is a group
of approximately two hundred municipal distribution systems
throughout the country.

And I also have the honor to speak

for the New York Public Service Commission in this argument.
The Municipal Distributors and New York are here
objecting to two elements of the Commission's order in this
case, which relate either to gas already sold and delivered
or else to gas already committed to long-term contracts.
These two elements are;
First, the drastic modification of refunds ordered
by the court in this case which changed the refunds which had
been ordered in an earlier case in 1968.
Secondly, a provision for four one-half-cent future
escalations in the rates for flowing gas from this area.

The

17
first of which alone, when applied to the SO trillion cubic
feet of known proven reserves of flowing gas would, at one
stroke, increase their value by about $400 million.
First, as to the refund issue —
QUESTION;

Hr. Morrow, may I ask;

Do I correctly

read the Fifth Circuit opinion as suggesting that the only
issue of judicial review, as they saw the case, was the
universal camera problem, whether or not the order of the
Commission was supported by substantial evidence?
MR. MORROW; tod they kept talking — yes, Your
Honor, and they kept talking about substantial evidence on
the record as a whole.
QUESTION;

Yes.

But your argument goes beyond that,

doesn't it? It challenges the provisions of the order, not as
unsupported by substantial evidence but for other reasons,
doesn't it?
MR. MORROW;

It challenges them as unsupported,

but before we get to that, we challenge the right of the
Commission
QUESTION:
MR. MORROW;
QUESTION:

That's what I thought.
to reopen its 1960 order.
And do you read the Fifth Circuit as

expressly addressing that question, or as •—
MR* MORROW:

I did not find anything on that

question in the Fifth Circuit's opinion, Your Honor*

18
QUESTION*

Mo.

Hell, if they were right ~~ if

they were right, in thinking that the only question of
judicial review was the shorthand universal camera question —
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
— that, if they are right about that,

then our review is even more limited, isn't it?
MR. MORROW:

If there were no serious questions

concerning the record in this case, concerning the substantive
evidence on which the record is based, then, obviously, if
the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit decides it on a
factual basis, this Court would not review.
But we feel that -there are serious legal issues
involved in this case.
QUESTION:

That's what I thought, yes.

And you

think those are open — assuming again we were to agree with
the Fifth Circuit, in its approach -—
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
— do you still think those would be open

to you?
MR. MORROW:

I think those would be open, yes, sir.

Let me explain the first one, on the refund issue.
The Commission, in Opinion 546, which is Southern
Louisiana I, in 1968 made findings as to the just and reasonable rates for gas in tine Southern Louisiana area, and these
findings related to gas from 1954, the inception of producer

19
regulations, up through 1968, the date of the order»
Finding that the producers had charged excessive
rates, this Commission ordered refunds, the amount of vrhich
approximated $376 million.
Three years later, in Opinion No. 598, which is now
under review, and which I refer to as Southern Louisiana II,
the Commission reopened its final order in the 1968
docket, which had been affirmed on appeal, and modified two
elements of the cost found in that docket, modified them
retroactively.

And since it modified those cost items

retroactively and increased them, that of course had an
effect upon the refunds which it had ordered in the other
case, and so it drastically modified its 1968 refund order,
reducing it at one fell swoop by $226 million, and then
providing for the work-off of the remaining $150 million
by dedications of gas by the producers to interstate commerce
in the future.
Now, our proposition in this case, the basic legal
proposition is very simple.

The Commission had no power by

its 1971 order to reopen a final judicially affirmed 1968
order, and modify the fact findings in that final 1968
order, and change the refunds relating to the 1954-1968
period.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Morrow, in that connection,

didn’t tile Fifth Circuit say that in its opinion on rehearing

20

on -the first order —
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
— it made it abundantly clear that it

was not affirming, it was leaving the Commission all the
authority in the world to reopen everything if it wanted to.
fiidn't it say that?
MR. MORROW:

No, sir, Mr. Justice Brennan, it did

not.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. MORROW;

And that’s where we come to the nub of

the case.
QUESTION:
mental"?

Where did they use the term "experi­

At what stage did that first enter into this?
MR, MORROW:

Your Honor, that was discussed by the

Court of Appeals in Southern Louisiana I»

It was one of the

main bases of the Court of Appeals opinion in Southern
Louisiana II.
And of course in the Texas Gulf Coast case, the
Court of Appeals of D.C. disagreed and said, We’ve passed the
experimental stage now and you can’t get by with that sort of
thing by calling it experimental.
QUESTION:

Well, but they weren’t dealing with the

seme record, were they?
MR. MORROW:

They were dealing with an almost

identical record, Your Honor.

Same issues.

21
QUESTION:

The same issues, but not the same

factual
MR. MORROW:
the same issues.

Not the same numbers,, but certainly

The 3ame type of tiling.

The same settlement.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Let's go back for a moment to that

1961 reference to its being experimental.

In what sense do

you suggest that the Court of Appeals was using that term
back with reference to the proceedings begun in 1961?
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:
MR. MORROW:

The '68 record —
The Louisiana I.
Your Honor, it was using that for

the purpose of excusing some very loose findings on the part
of the Federal Power Commission.

In the first Southern

Louisiana case, the Court said, We're not going to let the
Federal Power Commission get by with basing its conclusions
on such loose findings and basing findings on such vague and
general factual allegations in the future.
cost findings.

Particularly non­

In the future, if the Commission wants to

put non-cost additives onto a rate of return -- onto a rate,
it's got. to show what those additives, how much they are
needed and what they will accomplish.
And this is what the Court of Appeals in the Texas
Gulf Coast case reversed the Commission for, because it had
not shown just exactly that.

That the non-cost additives

22

were worth what they cost, in effectBut, Your Honor, you asked what exactly what the
Court of Appeals in the first case had decided; and let me
read it to you.
QUESTION; Where do we find it here?

So that we

can follow it.
MR. MORROW;

Your Honor, this is in the first case,

and it's not in the record here.

I happen to have a record of

the first case.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. MORROW:

Go ahead.

The Court said: "Since we have con­

cluded that the Commission is on the right course now, our
.

X

best course is to keep within the proper sphere of a reviewing
court.
"The point is that the probability of shortage,
based on new evidence, is not before us for review.

All that

is before us is the legal adequacy and not the wisdom of the
Commission's orders.
"Finally, and xtiost importantly, in the light of
Permian, we think we are required to hold that the Commission’s
orders in this case are procedurally and substantively
adequate under the law.

Whether they are ultimately wise is

a question to be presented, not to the court but to the
Commission."
And again, in a later page, which I don’t see right

23

now, it says:

"We hold that Permian requires affirmance„"

And then on its opinion on rehearing i.t reiterated,
"This is an affirmance and not a remand."
So what happened was that — and, incidentally, this
is the sole basis on which the Commission now rests its case,.
If this order in Southern Louisiana I, says the Court of
Appeals, is not valid, then the whole defense of the
' i

Commission, of its refund orders, must collapse.
QUESTION:

Do you have on hand —* I'm looking, for

it and can't find it — in the opinion before us now, on the
order, on the judgment under review, where they address
whether or not they left these things open on the petition,
for rehearing in the first case?
MR. MORROW;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
I can't seem to find that,

I thought I read something in it which is contrary
to the implications of what you read us from the first opinion
MR, MORROW:

I'm looking in the Appendices to the

Petition for Cert.
QUESTION: Well, don't — don't let me waste your
time, Mr. Morrow,

I'll find it.

MR. MO RROW:
QUESTION:

A3,1 right, sir.
Mr. Morrow, if in that first proceeding

the Commission's order had been open-ended or tentative,
so to speak, an affirmance by the Court of Appeals of that

24

order wouldn’t destroy the open-ended or tentative character
of the Commission’s order, would it?
MR. MORROW:

If it had not been a final order, then

I presume it would not have been a final order, Your Honor;
that's correct.
But tills was a final order, and the Commission
defended it before the Court of Appeals as a final order and
successfully defended every single finding in that case.
Now, what the Court of Appeals did was, first, to
affirm, because it says, "We have to affirm.

The Commission’s

opinion is based solidly on evidence in the record and we
have no choice but to affirm."
It then went on to say that with respect to this
lawful order, we make — it says, "We rely upon the broad
remedial powers that inhere in a court of equity and," acting
pursuant to its equitable powers it stated:

"We make it

part of the remedy in tills case that the authority of the
Commission to reopen any part of its orders is left intact."
Now, our position is very simply that if the
Commission order was lawful in all respects,there was no
basis for the Court of Appeals to provide a remedy, a
judicial, equitable remedy for a perfectly lawful order.
Once the Court of Appeals found that the Commission
order was substantially supported by facts and findings in
the record, its jurisdiction was at an end with respect to

25

that order.
And this Court said so in Matural Gas Pipeline
PPC, tvhich is cited in our reply brief.

V3.

The Coxirt said this,

referring to the Court's review of a Commission order:
Once a fair hearing has been given, proper findings made, and
other statutory requirements satisfied, the courts cannot
intervene, in the absence of a clear showing that the limits
of due process have been overstepped*
And again this Court, in SEC vs. Chenery Corporation,
said that it's the duty of a reviewing court — that the duty
of a reviewing court, quote, "is at an end when it becomes
evident that the Commission's action is based upon substantial
evidence and is consistent with the authority granted by
Congress.
This is the crucial distinction between this case
and the Ford Motor case and all the other cases that are
cited along that line by the Commission and the Interveners
.

'

in this case.
In the Ford Motor case, the agency had committed
legal error.

Someone's rights had been violated,

a legal wrong had been perpetrated.

A wrong,

And this called upon

)

the equity powers of the court, the remedial poxjers of the
court to provide a remedy for the wrong, to provide relief
for someone who had received legal injury.
In the present case

or, rather, in Southern

/

26

Louisiana I, there was no legal wrong.

The Commission's

opinion was affirmed in all respects upon the special
request of the Commission.

And therefore the court had no

power under the Natural Gas Act, as part of its reviewing
power under the Natural Gas Act it had no power to go ahead and
provide a legal equitable remedy, judicial equitable remedy
for a perfectly lawful order.
But if the Commission had no power to change that
order, which was perfectly lawful, then it certainly had no
power to use its equitable remedial rights to invest such an
unprecedented power in the Federal Power Commission.
QUESTION:
in mind.

Mr. Morrow, I found finally what I had

It's at page 30 of the Appendices to the Petition.
MR. MORROW:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Dealing with flowing gas, at the bottom

of page 30, where Judge Drown says — after referring to the
first order, the IB.5 and then the 19.5-cent rates:
"Although we pointed out that our mandate was an affirmance
of these rates, we poignantly emphasised that our opinion
did not foreclose the possibility of change.
we reiterated:

On rehearing

’We wish to make crystal clear the authority

of the Commission in this case to reopen any part of its
order that circumstances require the reopen.'"
MR. MORROW:

Yes, sir.

what the Court purported to do.

That's correct.

That's

27
And it's our position that the Court simply could
not do both.
QUESTIONs

I see.

MR. MORROW;

It cannot affirm, and at the same time

provide a judicial equitable remedy for a perfectly valid
order.

And thatTs what it purported to do in this case.
Now, there's a -— the New York Commission emphasises

this point, that in that Southern Louisiana I the Court had
carefully and exhaustively reviewed every single fact-finding
of the Commission.

And it had affirmed every fact-finding

of the Commission.

And, regardless of how you construe the

Commission's final order in the case, it is not reasonable
to construe it as having the Court say, We've just reviewed all
of these facts and costs, we affirm them all? no, Federal
Commission, go and change them.
In ocher words, if the Court was leaving anything
open validly in the Southern Louisiana I case, it was
leaving open matters with respect to non-cost additives.
But that brings us to the second leg of our case,
of our position here.

And that is that even if the

Commission's reopening of its 1968 opinion were lawful,
the manner in which if did so is totally, totally unsupported
on the record.
This is not just a matter of conflicting findings,
!

this is a matter of a misanalysis of the facts.

The sole

28
basis upon which the Commission made its change in the 1968
refund order was on its finding in the 1971 case, that it had
committed error, factual error in the previous case.
The Commission said, Opinion 546 did not afford an
cidequate return and it understated the requirements for
exploration and development.

In the light of these

inadequacies, the Commission said, we find that the rates of
20.625 cents and 21 and a quarter cents as the base for
refunds are reasonable and in the public interest.
So -the only basis for the finding as to the refunds
was that the 1968 order was in error with respect to rate of
return and allocation of exploration and development costs.
The rate of — but the fallacy here is that the
Commission never reviewed its 1968 record.

It never went

back to determine whether the fact-findings in that record
were wrong.

What it did was to use its findings in the nextf

case, its rate of return based on the 1971 decision, and
using the economic conditions and the capital conditions of
the 1571 decision, to find a rate of return there, and it
took that rate of return and said because this is higher,
tnis is 13 to 16 percent, therefore we find that the 12 percent
rate of return that we ordered in the 1968 opinion is
inadequate.
And it's our contention that the rate of return in
the second case is no evidence as to the inadequacy of the

29

rate of return in the first case.

The same tiling is true

with the other cost element, which is the major cost element.
The allocation of cost as between dry-hole costs or exploration
and development costs, between oil and gas.

It used a new

method in Southern Louisiana II, but it never applied that
method to the costs in Southern Louisiana I.
So, regardless of the result that it reached in
Southern Louisiana II, it could not use that result as
evidence that it had been wrong, erroneous or inadequate in
Southern Louisiana I.
So there was no evidence to support the court
the Commission changing of its rates in the earlier opinion,
and therefore no evidence to support the change of its
refunds in that period.
I haven't had a chance to get into the escalation
provisions, which, as I say, the first one-half cent
escalation provision amounts to $400 million. There are
three additional escalation measures.
Now, Mobil, in its brief, has discussed in great
detail the discriminatory aspects of these.

I only want to

say this about them, there is no evidence whatsoever in the
Commission's opinion to support them.

There is no evidence

that there's going to be any tiling like that kind of fact, of
cost increase in the future.
This gas is the gas that's already been found.

This

30
gas they've already had the lease costs, the dry-hole costs,
the drilling costs, all of the costs have been expended in
the past, except the cost of sitting there and letting the gas
flow from the well-bore into the pipeline.
And, as Hew York points out in its brief, those
cash costs actually decreased between 1960 and 1971? and
there is no finding in the future that those costs are
going to increase in any perceptible degree, and no conceivable
possibility that those costs will increase in the realm of
hundreds of millions of dollars, as is involved in these
half-cent increases.
The Commission never made any finding as to how
much good these half-cent increases were going to do,
whether they

were

needed, in the first place, and if they

were needed, there was no balancing of the hundreds of
millions of costs versus the probable new reserves that would
be gotten as a result of them.
So -there is, under the •— this is what disturbed
Judge Leventhal, too; Judge Leventhal, addressing this
precise issue in the Texas Gulf Coast case, concluded that
since the rates for new gas had been expressly found by the
Commission to be adequate alone, the rates for new gas alone,
and to induce capital investment in the area, there was no
basis for an extra allowance to rates for old gas to accomplish
all over again identically the same thing.

31

Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the rest of ray
time for rebuttal, if I may.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Morrow.

Mr. Forquer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO E. FORQUER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL POWER COMMISSION
MR. FORQUER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and raay it please

the Courts
I would like, first of all, to take a little time
to give a chronological resume of what happened in these
cases.

It may duplicate certain things that have been said

before, but I think it gives a better perspective on it.
The first Southern Louisiana case was initiated in
1961, and was decided in 1960, shortly after this Court's
affirmance of the Commission in the Permian case.

The rates

established in that proceeding were based on 1960 costs, and
were lower than the guideline and the in-line rates which
the Commission had previously established for Southern
Louisiana.
The Commission devoted very little discussion to the
gas supply situation, but concluded that its rates would
induce adequate supplies.

It said that findings to production

and reserves to production ratios were not significant in
helping to determine reasonable rates.
Among the many applications for rehearing presented

32

to the Commission was one by the pipeline purchasers group,
that indicated they were having difficulty purchasing
sufficient supplies of gas to meet their customers' demands,
and that the rates were inadequate to increase that supply»
While the Commission denied rehearing, it recognized
the inadequacy of the cost and reserve data, particularly
that with respect to the offshore federal domain area of
Southern Louisiana.
Accordingly, it lifted the indefinite moratorium
that it had imposed on price increases in that area, to
the extent necessary to permit certain limited increased
rate filings for gas sold under contracts dated after October
1, '68, and it limited the moratorium on similar onshore
sales to five years.

At the same time it. instituted a new proceeding
which was to re-examine the rate for offshore Southern
Louisiana, establish a new just and reasonable rate for that
area.

This was the beginning of South Louisiana II, the

case which is now before this Court.
Later that same year they expanded the proceeding
so that it encompassed the entire area involved in the first
Southern Louisiana case.
In September of 1969 , before -this case, the first
Southern Louisiana I,was submitted to the Court for review,
the staff of the Federal Power Commission issued a report

33
indicating that the national gas supply situation had
deteriorated, the reserves~to~production ratio and the
findings-to-production ratios had declined sharply.
They concluded that unless aggressive action was
taken to increase the finding of gas, supplies would soon
not be adequate to meet demand.
They pointed out that the findings in 1963 were
less than production, and that there would probably be
regional supply deficiencies as early as 1973.
They were much too optimistic, because as early as
late fall 1970, one or more pipelines were curtailing
supplies of gas to firm customers.
In its review of South Louisiana I, the Court
belov/ indicated its misgivings with respect to the
Commission's consideration of the supply situation and
their lack of any attention to the reserves-to-production or
findings-to-producfcion ratios.
However, they felt that with the presently pending
South Louisiana proceeding now before the Commission, that
it would serve little purpose to remand or to reserve, or
to set aside the order which was before them, since tine same
thing was being investigated.
They said, however, that it's possible that the
Commission may find it advisable to immediately modify its
order, or it might set aside the order affirmed here.

They

34
said the Commission has the power to take these actions, if
it finds them appropriate.
Petitions for rehearing were filed with the Court,
and it was argued that the Commission had no authority to set
aside orders which they had finally issued, and the
Commission itself, in response to a request from the Court,
said; Ue have no authority to make retrospective changes in
rates which we have established and which are finally
affirmed, unless this Court tell us that we can do so.
And in its order on rehearing, the Court made this
and I wish to quote this statement;
"Ue wish to make crystal clear the authority of the
Commission"
QUESTION:

Where are you reading from, now, Hr.

Forquer?
MR. FORQUER:

Sir, this is the order on rehearing,

where —
QUESTION:

Where is it in here?

QUESTION:

Page 5 of their brief.

QUESTION:

Is .it in the Appendix, too?

MR. FORQUER:

It's in the brief at page 20, the

bottom of page 20 of the government brief.
"We wish to make crystal clear the authority of the
Commission in this case to reopen any part of its order that
circumstances require be reopened.

Under Section 19(b) of

35
the Natural Gas Act, this Court has the broad remedial powers
that inhere in a court of equity, and pursuant to our
equitable powers we make it part of the remedy in this
case that the authority of the Commission to reopen any part
of its orders, including those affecting revenues from gas
already delivered, is left intact.

The Commission can make

retrospective as well as prospective adjustments in tin is case
if it finds that it is in the public interest to do so."
I might say that the rates which were established
by the Commission in Southern Louisiana I, either through
Court or Commission stays, were never made effective.
Petitioners for certiorari were filed with this
Court and were denied in December of 1970, and in the same
month the Commission reopened South Louisiana I, and
consolidated it with South Louisiana II.
In the meantime, pursuant to an order of the
Presiding Examiner, and also consistent with the provisions
of the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Commission’s
rules, settlement negotiations were being conducted by the
parties to this proceeding.
I might point out that the Commission staff
participated in all of these conferences, a member of the
staff presided at the conferences, and the staff supported
the settlement which came before the Commission in this case.
The Commission issued its opinion and order in

36
July of 1971# and its order was affirmed by the court below.
Now# as we see it# there are two legal issues that
are presented to the Court in this case.
QUESTION:

As respects SoLa No. I —* you call it

SoLa No. I.
MR. FORQUER:

How's that# Your Honor?

I'm sorry.

QUESTION: As respects SoLa No. I.
MR. FORQUER;
QUESTION:

Yes, concerning that, case —

MR. FORQUER;
QUESTION:

The issue as to SoLa --

Yes.

—- who

stands — Mobil does not stand

opposed to fciiat?
MR. FORQUER;
QUESTION:
MR. FORQUER:

No, I don't think so, Your Honor.
What parties are?
It's New York and MDG, I think that

they support SoLa I and say that the Court had no authority
to give us the authority, the Commission the authority to
do
QUESTION; And the parties who stand against SoLa
are ~?
MR. FORQUER:

Against SoLa I are the — all the

people who joined in the settlement proposal in SoLa II.
QUESTION: Except Mobil?
MR. FORQUER:

Mobil, that's right.

Well, they

didn't join it, they opposed it consistently, Your Honor.

37
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. FORQUER:

The first issue that, legal issue

before the Court is whether the Commission did have authority,
or rather whether the court below had the authority to
authorise the Commission to take another look at its
decision in the first Southern Louisian case, and make
retrospective as well as prospective adjustments.
QUESTION: Do you know, fir. Forquer, whether that
question was raised on the petition for cert here from -MR; FORQUER:

Indeed it was, Your Honor, it was the

primary issue that was raised before the court at that time,
under the petition.
Under Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act, the
Court of Appeals of course has authority to set aside an order
in whole or in part, or it could order additional evidence
to be heard by theCommission xipon such terms and conditions
as

it seems proper.
Now, the court below was greatly troubled by the

Commission's failure to discuss supply and demand, and its
lack of concern with the reserve and the findings ratios.
They felt that the decision with respect to the validity of
Southern Louisiana I should be made by the Commission who
made the original decision, because they had the data which
would indicate what idle supply situation was, and only they
had the expertise to evaluate that data, and to evaluate the

38
impact of the Southern Louisiana I rates on supply.
It seems to us that that's entirely consistent with
this Court's opinion in the Ford Motor Company case that
Courts of Appeals in these instances are vested with equity
powers, and that, as idle Court said in that case, that, while
the Court must act within the bounds of the statute and
without intruding upon the administrative province, it may
adjust its reliefs to the exigencies of the case in
accordance with equitable principles governing judicial
action.
We think that is what the court below did in tills
case, and gave the Commission the authority to reopen its
previous order.
If that is true, the argument made by certain of
the petitioners that the Commission was granting reparations
by its order in this case obviously is not correct.
Now, the second legal issue concerns compliance by
the Commission with the three criteria established by this
Court for review in the Permian case.
One, did the Commission's order abuse or exceed
its authority?
Two, were each of the orders essential elements
supported by substantial evidence?
And three, can the order be expected to maintain
financial integrity, attract necessary capital, and fairly

39
compensate investors for the risks they have assumed, and
yet provide appropriate protection to the relevant public
interest?
Now, as had been the Court's concern in Southern
Louisiana I, the Commission’s concern in Southern Louisiana II
was directed to the supply situation for gas, and the demand
for it.
The Commission pointed out the steady decline in
both the reserves-to-production and the findings-to-production
ratios, and stated that their minimum objective in the case
was to halt the downward trend of the reserve-to-production
ratio.
They pointed out that the estimated demand in
South Louisiana would increase from an annual figure of
six trillion cubic feet per year to nine and a half trillion
cubic feet in 1975.
And in this connection, this Court said in Permians
We do not suggest, nor did the Commission, that the Commission
should not continuously assess the level and success of
exploration, or that the relationship between reserves and
production is not a useful benchmark of the industry's future.
Now, the Commission indicated that it was unable to
quantify the volumes of gas which would be elicited by a
particular rate, that they did find that there was a strong
positive relationship between price and supply or exploratory

40
efforts.
They also pointed out that capital formation for
gas exploration and development had been declining since
1957, and that the industry's capital requirements had
increased and that the costs of producing gas have continued
to climb.
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Forquer, I gather the

Fifth Circuit did apply the three criteria of judicial
review under Permian.
MR. FORQUER:
QUESTION:

And concluded that —

MR. FORQUER:
QUESTION:

They had met all tests.

~~ they had been satisfied.

MR. FORQUER:
QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

That’s right.

Mow, what’s the scope of our review of

that determination of the Fifth Circuit?
MR. FORQUER:
QUESTION:

Well, if you followed ray —
Are we to redo the job that the Fifth

Circuit did?
MR. FORQUER:

Not in our view, Your Honor.

QUESTION: What do you think we should do?
MR. FORQUER:

I think that you should look at the

general result of the Commission’s rate order to find out
that if the ultimate conclusions the Commission arrived at
were appropriate and reasonable, but net to weigh the evidence

41
as the Court of Appeals was required to do.
How, in an attempt to meet the problems of
declining supply and inadequate capital formation, the
Commission approved a rate-designed formula which encompassed
several facets, all of which were directed to an attempt to
increase the supply of gas available to the consumers in
this country.
This formula included base area rates, it included
fixed and contingent escalations, it included refund
write-off provisions.

And each part of the rate design was

directed to the problems facing the Commission.

The rate

design had to function for the entire area, and apply to
many producers in differing circumstances, and the record
showed that the industry had placed great reliance and had
expanded internally generated funds to finance its
exploratory efforts.
The basic finding that the Commission made was that
a portion of the funds required for further exploration and
development in South Louisiana will be generated by the
increased cash flow from the higher rate for flowing gas,
and from the operation of the contingent escalation pro­
visions ,
Flowing gas resources represent an important source
of capital to the industry.

The additional resources from

higher new gas rates, and the escalations allowed will also

42
contribute to the total of needed capital.
Now, in their approach to designing these, the
Commission felt that they could not and should not be
restricted to encouraging an increased supply solely by
one method, and that was by the area rates which they
established, particularly the rates for new gas.
However, they discussed, as had been done in
Permian, the cost, current cost data which was before the
Commission in the determination of the new gas rates.
They indicated that the lack of precision in these costs,
and the difficulties involved in making allocation procedures,
made it desirable that they indicate a range of costs based
on reliable and credible data.
As a matter of fact, this Court, in a footnote in
the Permian case, said that by one estimate the costs of
non-associated gas are 45 percent separate, 31 percent joint,
and 24 percent common.

So there are great areas for

differences in judgment with respect to those.
Accordingly, they examined the cost data, and
established what they considered a range of reasonab3,e
costs, and utilized a staff witness presentation in that
respect, who had recommended a rate cf 25 cents per Mcfj and
in order to be assured that there would be enough in this
to encourage additional supplies, the Commission indicated
that the rates for lease — the costs for lease acquisition

43
and for drilling were all going up and they should be
increased slightly.

They approved a rate,, as found just and

reasonable, for 26 cents and said it should operate to
elicit additional supplies of gas.
It used a similar method for fiox-zing gas to that
which was approved by this Court in the Permian case.

The

only difference was that they had a direct assignment of
exploration and development costs because there was evidence
in the record which justified that use.

And it approved the

settlement rate of 22 and three-eighths cents.
The Commission, however, at the same time, pointed
out that under this conditional old gas costing method,
that the exploration and development allowance too often
indicates the cost of exploration under past periods rather
than the current increased costs, and it added a non-cost
component to the old gas rate, to increase the cash flow
to producers for an increased exploration and development
effort.
QUESTION:

How was that used?

MR. FORQUER;

It was a — the figures, if I recall

cox'rectly, Mr« Justice Brennan, were from approximately 20
cents to 25 cents — 24 cents, I think it was.

The rate

which the staff had developed was 21.10 cents and they
increased it to 22.375»
Now, probably one of the things that has been most

vigorously attacked here by the petitioners are the
provisions for refund write-offs.
This was really the second leg of the Commission’s
attempt to encourage additional supplies to South Louisiana.
The Commission, first of all, went back and looked at the
rates which had been established for past periods, and
established new rates for gas delivered under contracts dated
prior to 1961 and to 1965 and from !65 to the date of their
order, and established rates which were consistent, the first
with what the Commission had used in certificating sales of
gas prior to that time in Southern Louisiana and secondly
their guideline policy statement prices.
But it also reflected back from the 26 cents for
new gas a reduction which was consistent with the increased
costs of gas which the record in this case reflected.
The determination of the total of $150 million of
refunds was obviously, in a sense, a compromise with -by the parties who had participated in the settlement
conference, but they resulted from these rates which the
Commission established.
QUESTION:

This was a re-establishment of just and

reasonable rates that had been established in SoLa I?
MRa FORQUER:
QUESTION;
MR. FORQUER:

For refund purposes, Your Honor.
And --- just for refund purposes?
Yes.

Well, they determined what the

45

amount of the refunds would be.
QUESTION:

They would be.

Anything that collected

over that they had to refund, and that happened — had ended
up being $150 million?
MR. FORQUER:

That's right, Your Honor.

Now, rather than have the cash —
QUESTION:

You mean they just didn't pick the 150

million out of the air and say that was a fair figure?
MR. FORQUER:

Well, what happened was that the

20.625 rate for the first period would generate so much,
and the 21 and a quarter for the next period would be so much,
cind then the final period up to January 1, 1971, was placed

in a percentage of the difference between the SoLa I rates,
and SoLa II rates to equate to $150 million.
QUESTION: Well, nevertheless, I suppose to have
the authority to reduce the refund, you had to raise —■ the
Commission had to raise the just and reasonable rate.
MR* FORQUER:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

Now, what are you going to do with the

work-off?
MR. FORQUER:

Well, that —- that's the point.

The

work-off of the refunds was related directly to the finding
of new gas supply.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but does the — all right,

but they can work off the remainder of the refund, can't they?

46

MR. FORQUER:

That is correct.

QUESTION: And every time they work off a little bit
of it, the just and reasonable rate goes up.
MR. FOROUER:

Well, there's no change in -die rate,

but the effect, I guess, is —
QUESTION:

Then, I didn't realize you had — are

you asserting the Commission may find, may suspend rates or
let rates go into effect subject to refund, which they did in
Sola I, right?
MR. FORQUER:

That's right.

QUESTION: And then establish just and reasonable
rates lower than what the rates were, and yet forgive a
refund?
MR. FOROUER:

Lower than they were, or higher

than they were?
QUESTION:

Lower than had been charged.

Let's assume -chat they file rates and the Commission
lets them go into effect subject to refund.
MR. FORQUER:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

Then they have a proceeding and they

establish what the just and reasonable rate is, and it is
lower than what has been charged.
MR. FORQUER:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Now, do you say that they have

discretion if they find that the just and reasonable rate is

47
lower than. what has been charged to forgive a refund?
MR, FORQUER:

I think that they do have authority

given a proper —
QUESTION: Where is the authority for that?
MR» FORQUER:

Well, first of all, the Natural Gas

Act itself says that they may order refunds, it doesn't
say that they must.
QUESTION:

Section 4.
So you — so why did they even go to the

trouble of resetting just and reasonable rates?
MR» FORQUER:

To establish the refund level.

QUESTION: Well, they didn't have to, they could just
say
MR. FORQUER:

Well, but, as a matter of fact the

staff witness in the case suggested that no refund should
be ordered, that the — that those who had charged excessive
rates would be better off if they retained these amounts and
therefore had additional capital.
QUESTION:

Well, do you have some legal, some

judicial authority for the fact that the Commission may
forgive refunds, even though it finds that the rate has been
charged

that has been permitted to go into effect subject

to refund is higher than what the just and reasonable rate
is.

Is there some —
MR. FORQUER:

In the Hugoton-Anadarko case, Your

Honor, one of the Commission's area rate proceedings, the

48

Ninth Circuit so held»
QUESTION:

That they could just — needn't order a

refund, even though the --MR. FORQUER:

Well, they did not require certain

portions of it, to he paid back.

But it seems to me that the

Commission has a discretion to do what is in the public
interest with respect to these refunds.

If, in an appropriate

case, they xrould find that, for instance, the ordering of
refunds would cause such great damage to the industry that
the ultimate consumer, really, would suffer; I think that they
have the authority to so excuse them.
QUESTION: Well, you certainly are putting the —
you certainly are charging old consumers a lot of money for
future exploration.
MR. FORQUER:

Well, the — one of the — if you

don't do that, perhaps, Your Honor, they won't have any gas.
This was again an attempt to get a greater supply of gas,
and under the refund —
QUESTION;

Even though the Commission might have

even set a higher price for new gas?
MR. FORQUER:
QUESTION:

That's right.

Or for flowing gas»

MR. FORQUER:

They did include an element in the

flowing gas to encourage additional exploration and development,
but they didn't want to rest on simply the new gas rate as

49
the sole incentive to bringing forth new supplies of gas.
How, in these $150 million of refunds, if in fact
those owing those amounts do not find and dedicate new
supplies of gas, they must pay these refunds in cash.
QUESTION:

For a hundred and fifty million?

MR. FORQUER:
QUESTIONs

Yes, sir; yes, Your Honor.
Not the old amount.

MR. FORQUER;

Not the old amount, no, indeed,

because the Commission said that the 4, 546, opinion 546,
Southern Louisiana I, had not given them a proper rate of
return or properly reflected exploration development expense.
QUESTION;

And anybody with flowing gas, I suppose,

and with a refund obligation, the larger the better now, I
guess, has got quite an incentive, or quite an advantage
in exploring —■ in bidding for new gas, I suppose.

MR. FORQUER;

Well, the only way — he's not getting

any additional revenue by this, he's not having to pay out
something that he might otherwise, but he has a very heavy
responsibility, if he has large refunds, to find very large
quantities of gas and dedicate it to the interstate market or
he

will have to pay this amount.
QUESTION: Well, yes, but the ■— forget the refunds

for the moment.

MR. FORQUER;
QUESTION;

All right.
The person with flowing gas, the prices

50

for that flowing gas has been increased.
MR. FORQUER:

It has been increased to 22 and three-

eighths cents.
QUESTION:

For not — to cover non-cost item,,

exploration iteras?
MR. FORQUER:

There's a small component in there

for that, yes,. Your Honor.
QUESTION: And it's going to be escalated for that
purpose, too?
MR. FORQUER:

It's going to be escalated once,

because of the increasing costs that the Commission found
were involved, and then there are the contingent escalations
to flowing gas rates in the event that additional dedications
are made.
And these dedications do not count until the refund
requirements are paid off for those producers who are
involved in refunds.
QUESTION;

So your suggestion is that we — that it's

perfectly all right for the Commission to tell old consumerss
Well, you've been paying unjust and unreasonable rates, but,
nevertheless, we're not going to order a refund because we
think we should stimulate further exploration.
MR. FORQUER;
think quite properly:

We think it — they could say, I
We think it is much more, in the public

interest that additional supplies of gas be furnished, so that

51
you will continue to have gas, than it is that you get these
amounts of dollars in refunds.
QUESTION:

And if we don't get the gas —

Well, why put it on just the people

who have been buying old gas?

I mean, they've been paying

unjust and unreasonable rates, and the larger — and the
more unjust and the more unreasonable they are, the more
they’re going to be charged for future explorations.
MR. FORQUER:

Your Honor, there was no other source

to get these additional supplies of gas, unJ.ess you were
going to realize solely on the rate for new gas.

New gas

wasn't in existence, it had to go back to be tied with those
who were presently in the business, who presently had
reserves, who presently were delivered gas,to encourage them
to go forward and find additional supplies.
QUESTION: Well, this — has it been a traditional
function of rate-making to finance expansion?
MR. FORQUER:

Well, I think that this Court

certainly —
QUESTION:

And to build up internal sources of

capital.
MR. FORQUER:

This Court indicated in Permian that

it was entirely —QUESTION:

I know, but I said traditional.

MR. FORQUER:
sense.

Traditional, not in the utility

52

QUESTION;

I mean, I agree with you, I know v/hat

Permian said.
MR. FORQUER:

Traditional — not in the public

utility sense, it certainly is not traditionally •—
QUESTION s

Yes.

MR. FORQUER;

— true.

But this is a situation

vrholly different, again as this Court pointed out in Permian,
where the gas producing industry is an entirely different
situation than the ordinary public utility.
One other item, and the third leg of the Commission’s
attempt to .increase gas supply, were the contingent
escalation provisions x^hich were definitely keyed to new
dedications of gas in Southern Louisiana.

By

that provision,

if, after refunds had been paid off, producers dedicated up
to 15 trillion cubic feet of gas, there could be increased
rates as high as a cent and a half.
Now, if the refund write-off provisions were
completely taken care of, and if the contingent escalations
were completely taken care of, there would be 30 trillion
cubic feet of gas supplied for the interstate market.
I’d like to comment about one other tiling, and
that is the argument that there was discrimination as between
producers, because some of them had earlier settled their
obligations and would have much lesser refunds.

In connection,

for instance, with Petitioner Mobil Oil Company, they made a

53
settlement in 1364 in which they were excused from refunds
of approximately $14 million, and subsequently, when a
moratorium, which they proposed in -their settlement had
expired, they chose to continue with those rates and not
make any additional filings.
Now, these were, management determinations, these
were things that if they wanted to make a settlement in
1964 and get their $14 million then, if they chose not to
make increased rate filings in which there were no moratoria,
that was entirely up to them, and did not require this
Commission to take all of those aspects into consideration.
What they tried to do was make broad general rules
covering all the producers in this wide area, but primarily
in an attempt to bring forth additional supplies of gas.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rebman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. REBMAN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PRODUCER-RESPONDENTS
MR. REBMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I want to address my first and earlier remarks very
briefly to the argument with respect to the question of the
powers of the Court of Appeals to provide the Commission, in
turn, with the power to set aside and reconsider the first
Southern Louisiana decision.
I want to call attention to —
QUESTION:

Well, it was a little more than that,

wasn't it?
Didn't they — the result was that consolidation
of the first case and the second case, and the hearing on the
two combined?
MR. REBMANs
true.

Yes, indeed, Your Honor.

That's quite

And your question ties to the point that I wanted to

make and call the Court's attention to that portion of the
Fifth Circuit opinion on appeal, on rehearing, where the
court indicated — and this is at 428 F. 2d 445 — that their
disposition of the case was influenced by the existence of a
new proceeding which the Commission itself had already

55
commenced, and their specific statement was that in fact the
existence of the new proceedings, vzhich, as we understand
them, will take into account many of the issues whose
absence has concerned us here,"has been one of the factors
we have considered in deciding to affirm the Commission's
decision','

And that's the end of the quote.
Now, I think that the important thing about this

is to tie into this Court's opinion in the Ford Motor Company
case, where the Court regarded as a contention without
substance whether the court below, Court of Appeals, set
aside the opinion or whether it allowed the agency, there
the NLRB, to set aside the opinion.
And the Court characterized the contention on that
ground as one without substance.
This is the situation, I think, where the Court of
Appeals found the Federal Power Commission, in an era of
transition, because to read the two opinions of the Court
and the Commission side by side, reflects an enormously
different outlook, about the gas supply situation in this
nation.
In the first opinion it was of little or no concern
to the Commission? in the second opinion, three years later,
it had become virtually an overriding consideration.
Turning, if I might, next to the questions with
respect to the refund discharge, and the questions raised by

56
you, Hr» Justice White, I think it's vary necessary in
looking both at the refund discharge and contingent
escalation questions, to start at the beginning of the book
and not in the middle of the book, as petitioners have done
here.
The beginning of the book is this Court's analysis
in Memphis and Mobile in the early 1960's of the functions
of Sections 4 and 5.
And there the Court pointed out that this is a
peculiar sort of regulation in this respect.

The buyers and

sellers, the parties who are regulated, start out in the
first instance with individual contracts, which they make
according to their own evaluations of the bargain.
Then, superimposed on top of that, becomes the
regulatory powers of the Commission.
Nov;, this, I think, is the source of a good deal
of the argument and confusion with respect to -the refund
write-offs.
What this Commission was working on in the Southern
Louisiana case was a multitude of contracts by a multitude
of parties that had been negotiated and entered into at a
variety of different levels.
Some of these were affected by refund order, some
were not.
The important -- sir?

57
QUESTION:

But no company’s costs were knovm.

MR. REBMANs

That's correct, Mr. Justice Douglas,

they're — in fact the Commission -—
QUESTION %

And you're bound to have in this order

some discrimination?
MR. REBMAN:

That's right.

In fact, the Commission

excluded from evidence some offers of individual company
proof by some companies.
QUESTION:

Didn't the Permian Basin opinion indicate

that there was, either by inference,

that there was the

potential for built-in discrimination?
MR. REBMAN:

That's absolutely correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, and in that —
QUESTION:

By arbitrarily drawing area lines.

MR. REBMAN:

Area lines, and also the utilization

of composite costs.

And this was thought by the Court there

to be simply an unavoidable aspect of group regulation,
that the agency itself was not required to look at the
individual financial impacts on each entity being regulated.
QUESTION: And now the chicken has come home to
roost.
MR. REBMAN's

According to some parties.

Here, I think, carrying forward the concept of the
impacts on these individual companies, I think the Court
should be very interested in looking at some of the materials

58
in the Volume V of the Appendix, because there one can
evaluate how revenue reductions, resulting revenues and
refunds, impacted on individual companies.

Because you find

a very peculiar thing.
We hear the greatest complaint with respect to the
refund write-off from Mobil, and it's very interesting to
look at the revenue impact of the Commission's decision,
which gives Mobile the highest resulting average revenue,
/

third highest of the 23 largest producers listed, and in fact
the highest of the ten largest, although their refunds are
relatively modest.
Now, 1 don't know why, and I don't think it's
important why.

What's important is that different parts of

the order impact different producers differently.
Now —
QUESTION:

But the revenue would be somewhat

higher if they still had some refunds to make?
MR. REBMAN:

No, sir.

QUESTION: Why not?
MR, REBMAN:

The revenue under the order prospectively

— and I'm speaking of prospective revenues only — is higher.
The prospective revenues are not affected by the refund.
That's a locked-in period for the past only.
And I wish I could get to some of the questions
there were bothering you, Mr. Justice White, and I think

59

perhaps
QUESTION!

I wish you could, too.

MR. REBMAN;
key elements here.

I think perhaps there's one or two

And that is that the Commission, while

it did indicate its view that the refund floors which it
established for a past period were just and reasonable, it
went further; it expressed the opinion that the formula,
the formula — and I'm reading from page 5 -- 654 of Volume
II of the Appendix — that the formula, for determining the
refund obligations during this period is found to be just
and reasonable.
So I think you have to accept the Commission's
view that it was dealing with a range of costs, old and new,
and that there is a zone of reasonableness for just and
reasonable rates, not a single point two decimal place
estimate.
Now, carrying the fixed amount of refund obligations
forward as to its impact on the individual producers, I would
commend to your reading very strongly the brief filed by
Intervenor Associated Gas Distributors.

This is a large

group of distribution companies who took a very active part
in this case.

And they expressed the whole problem very

wcill, I think.
Throughout producer regulation, from the very first,
the Commission has been confronted with this confounding

60
problem of trying to link together a certain price and a
certain volume of gas.

It has been unable to do it, it

cannot do it, it's inherent in the. nature of an industry
that expends the bulk of its exploratory moneys for
unsuccessful projects.
Tiie producers in general every year spend in the
neighborhood of $1 billion on what are unsuccessful projects,
mostly dry holes.

There's just no way you can link a

specific price to two decimals to a specific volume of gas.
The Commission has recognised this, and so did
the Fifth Circuit.
So what this refund does, and this h what AGO points
out, this is one of the first times that the Commission has
been able to provide this linkage between price and supply.
This is the situation where the consumer either gets the
money as a refund or he gets the new gas commitment„
And the same thing applies with respect to the
contingent escalation, the consumer does not pay them unless
the industry provides the total interstate dedications that
are specified in the opinion.
QUESTION:

Who's that?

Who will get the refunds

that will be made, the pipelines, or v;ill they be passed
through?
MR. REBMAN:

In general, the Commission provides for

a pass through from the pipelines to their distribution

61
customers and than it's turned over to the local State
agencies.
QUESTION:

So we really are talking about the

consumer and not just a pipeline here?
MR, REDMAN:

That's correct. There's no question

that the pipelines in general are under orders to flow through.
Now, the Commission itself made a judgment on the
same page I cited earlier, a finding:

We find that such an

incentive, being the refund discharge, will be a net benefit
to the consumer by obtaining additional gas supplies.
And the reason it's such a benefit is because of
this direct linkage that AGD describes, between price and
supply.
We think this is one of the crucial parts of the
case.
QUESTION:

You do, but the Commission must assume,

and I suppose the Court assumes, that -— if you agree with
the Fifth Circuit —
MR. REDMAN’:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, I do.
— that the refunds that are forgiven,

in order to stimulate exploration, will be used for exploration, or at least a good share of it.
MR. REDMAN:

In fact, one can go even further, Mr.

Justice White, the -QUESTION: Well, there was no requirement for them

62

to do it.
MR. REBMAN:

I was speaking of the ultimate foregive

ness of the refund obligation that was established in SoLa I.
MR. REBMAN:

I think that that should be

kept in the context, however, of the fact that while a
Commission opinion issued with respect to that, as Mr.
Forquer pointed out, that opinion never became final.

And

in its second decision, the Commission itself recognized
its error in that regard.

63

And here's an interesting point about that.

The —•

if you look at page 277, X believe it is, of Volume V —
QUESTION:

Did you say the Commission conceded that

it erred in the first case?
MR. KERMAN:
QUESTION:

Mo.

As Mr. Forquer pointed out —

I thought the court found tliat they were

quite right, the Court of Appeals decided they were quite
right, and even used the word "affirmance",
MR. REBMA.N:

They used the word "affirmance" , but

they used many other words, Mr. Justice White, including
this remedy.
QUESTION:

I'm not saying they

I'm not suggesting

they didn't have the right to reopen, but I would hesitate
to say that anybody found the Commission had erred in the
first proceeding.
MR. REBMANs

I don’t think I said that.

If I did,

I inis spoke myself.
But I wanted to call the Court's attention to the
fact that most of the refunds, and this shows at page 277 of
Volume V, that are required by the present opinion fall in
the late years, the late Sixties and early Seventies, and
this is why it was most appropriate for the Commission to
focus on its cost computation made as of the test year
1969, not the test year 1960, which it had earlier used.
And you recall, Mobile described — Mobil's counsel

64
described for you the process of individual company settle­
ments through the mid-sixties, and these settlements themselves
had eliminated most of the refund obligation by making refunds
through the early — late Fifties and early Sixties,
So we think it is most appropriate that the
Commission now looks at the 1969 test year for the derivation
of its present refund obligation.
One additional point, I think, should be made in
•this respect, and it ties back to the Court’s decision in
second Phillips,

You will recall that Mr. Forquer pointed

out that a staff witness in the second part of the case made
the finding and a recommendation that no refunds at all should
be required, because the revenues received during that
period were less than his cost estimates, on an aggregate
basis.
And this is precisely the reason that in Phillips II
this Court affirmed the Commission for not requiring refunds
of that company in a similar revenue cost position.
And in our view this finding gave the Commission
the power to utilize this refund obligation as a supply
eliciting factor in its over-all rate design.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Yes,

Mr. Morrow, do you have anything further?
MR. MORROW:

Yes, Your Honor, if I may.

65

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You've got about four

minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE E. MORROW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS PSC OF HEW YORK AND
MUNICIPAL DISTRIBUTORS GROUP.
MR. MORROW:

First, with respect to Justice

Brennan's question about the standard used by CA~5 in
reviewing the rate.
We contend that they used the wrong standard, and
that if this Court will look at the Texas Gulf Coast rate,
you will find exactly the right standard that should be used,
which they -QUESTION;

Which prompts me to ask, Mr. Morrow,

MR. MORROW; Sir?
QUESTION:

do you think these two decisions can

stand together?
MR. MORROW:

No, sir, one of them is wrong.

QUESTION:

But whatever we do in this case will

govern what is to happen in Texas -MR. MORROW:

That case used virtually identically

the same settlement provision that this case has used, yes,
Your Honor.

So it was modeled directly after this case.

They've both got to stand or fall, it seems to me.
And we suggest that the general result that Mr.
Forquer said that the Court used there, what's the general

66
over-all result, that's not the proper standard.

This Court

has said that each essential element of the cost of service
must be supported by evidence.
And we contend that it's not in this case.
Now, as to the matter that Your Honor raised,
Justice White, as to the discretion of the Commission to order
refunds.

We treat of that right strongly in our reply brief,

and would commend that to your attention? because we take
the position that the Commission has no discretion to allow
a company to remain unjustly enriched by unlawful exactions
from its customers, particularly under an Act -chat's supposed
to give complete, permanent and effective bond of protection
to the consumers.
As to the compromise — as to the $150 million of
refunds, I must take issue with Mr» Forquer as to how that
was arrived at.

It was pulled right square out of the air»

It was a result of settlement negotiations, and after that
150 million figure had been reached, then the Commission
started building a floor of costs under it to support it»
And it couldn't find the cost in its cost of service to
support that hundred and — that reduction to 150 million.
And that's why the Commission went back to 1968 and
remodeled its 1968 opinion, in order •— and it did so by
using a different kind of cost allocation method, in this
case.

<ol
The cost allocation method which the Commission
■used in this case was one it had rejected in every other case
it's ever had of producers.

The only reason that this' cost

allocation method was used in this case was to jack-up
retroactively the costs in Southern Louisiana I, so that
they would meet this package deal that had been presented to
the Contrais si on.
If it please the Court, the thing that's basically
wrong with this case is that we have a serious question here,
a serious problem, and the Commission -— and it demands a
rational, well-thought-out result.
What the Commission has done has abdicated its
responsibility to a kind of regulation by negotiation by
the industry itself.
And with respect to the refunds, what do you -—
with respect to the whole thing, you've got negotiations
between selling parties, who are the producers, controlling
virtually the entire supply of gas in Southern Louisiana,
and buying parties, the pipelines and the distributors, who
are desperate for gas, must get it from these producers and
can resell it at any rate that the producers
it to them for.

propose to sell

And who have no interest in the refunds

whatsoever, because, as Mr. Rebman pointed out, the pipelines
don't keep them, they pass them along to the distributorss
and the distributors don't keep them, their State regulatory

68
agencies make them pass along.
So the negotiations that resulted in this $150
million worth of refunds were by people who were negotiating
with other people's money, arid that**; how they got down to
the $150 million.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2;13 o’clock, p.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
