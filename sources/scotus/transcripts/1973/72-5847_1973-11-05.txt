MR. CHIEF JUSTICE.:

Harrell Alexander v. Gardner-

Denver Company.
Mr. Spiegelman, you may proceed whenever you are
ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. SPIEGELMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OB’ THE PETITIONER
MR. SPIEGELMAN:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas®

My name is Paul Spiegelman, and I am counsel for

the petitioner in this case.
The questions presented today are, we believe, two.
First, dies the submission of a grievance to arbitration pur­
suant to a collective bargaining agreement deprive the federal
courst of power to hear a statutory claim of racial discrimin­
ation based on the same incident which gave rise to th©
grievance.
Second, under what circumstances if any is it appro­
priate for a federal court to refuse to hear a claim of racial
discrimination on its merits because the person raising the
claim has pursued a contractual remedy which arose out of the
same incident.
Petitioner is a black man who was hired by respondent
in May of 1966.
in June of 13S8.

He bid on and was awarded, a drill trainee job
He remained in that job until he was dis­

charged on September 29, 1969, allegedly because he had

4
accumulated excessive scrap.
Petitioner filed a grievance on October 1, 1969.

That

grievance stated, ”1 feel that I have bean unjustly discharged
and ask that I b© reinstated with full seniority and pay.*'
was the entire grievance.

That

Ho mention was made of the issue of

race.
The grievance was apparently brought under section
6(a) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement which provided that
"No employee will be discharged, suspended or given written
notice except for just cause."
The contract also contains an anti-discrimination
clause which provides that the company and the union agree that
there shall be no discrimination against any employee on account
of race, color, religion, sex, national origin

or ancestry."

Article 23 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement sets
forth the procedures for handling grievances.

Essentially it

sets up a five-step procedure, the first four steps involving
negotiation between the company and the union, and that failing
to resolve the issue, a fifth step of arbitration.
Arbitration may bs invoked by the union by written
notice if the first four steps fail.

The Collective Bargaining

Agreement has no provision whatsoever for the individual to force
arbitration, and there is no provision specifically indicating
that anyone can withdraw a grievances from arbitration once it
has been referred to arbitration by the union.

5
The only mention of any withdrawal or implication of
withdrawal is section 6(f) of Article 23, which provides that
the company may convert a discharge into suspension if the
union agrees at any time prior to arbitration»
The procedures also provide that failure to meet the
time limits prescribed therein will automatically make the
disciplinary action taken valid.

And those are the exact words

of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The agreement further provides that the union and the
company select the arbitrator.

Wo provision is made for par­

ticipation of the employee in the selection of the arbitrator.
The employee is not under the agreement even technically a
party to the arbitration.
The arbitrator's power .is described in section 5,
step five.

It provides that the arbitrator shall not amend,

take away, add to or change any of the provisions of this agree­
ment, and that the arbitrator's decision must be based solely
upon an interpretation of the agreement.
In this case, the company denied petitioner's griev­
ance in the first four steps.

Prior to the grievance being

referred to arbitration, the petitioner filed a charge of racial
discrimination with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.

And

some two weeks prior to the actual arbitration hearing, the
Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission assumed juris­
diction of its charge.

On depositions, which are a part of the

record in this case, the petitioner —
Q

2 don't want to anticipate your agreement, but is

there going to be an issue here whether in fact the issue of
racial discrimination was decided by the arbitrator?
MR, SPIEGELMAN:

We certainly believe that the issue

of racial discrimination was not decided by the arbitrator.
Q

Was not.

Q

Perhaps I am under a misapprehension, but did the

District Court find that it was?
MR. SPIEGELMMJ:

It specifically found that it did not.

It indicated that the issue was raised in arbitration, but the
arbitrator's award was silent as to the issue of racial discrim­
ination.

Thera was no mention made whatever of that, and the

District Court's opinion did in fact note that.
Q

But. it did find that the issue was raised before

that?
MR. SPIEGELMANj
Q

Hava you questioned that finding?

MR. SPIEGELMMs
that issue.

Yes, sir.

Well, the record is not the best on

1 say that what the record does state is this:

First, petitioner indicated the only indication of it is from
the deposition of petitioner, which —
Q

That is a year later?

MRc SPIBGELMANs

Which was a year later, yes.

The

statement of petitioner —• and that seems to be what the record

7
contains on this issue

two things.

One ha indicated that a

letter that he had written to the union was read verbatim into
the transcript.

That letter stated that — and I am quoting —

"I am knowledgeable that in the same plant others have scrapped
an equal amount and sometimes in excess „ but by all logical
reasoning 1, Harrell Alexander, have been the target of prefer­
ential discriminatory treatment."
Mow, the deposition indicates that Mr. Alexander a
year later indicated he felt that was raising the race issue.
The words, of course, did not mention the issue of race.
Q

And I gather the artbirator's opinion — that

was the law school dean, wasn't it?
MR. SPIEGELMAN:
Q

Yes, sir.

— makes no reference that the grievance involved

racial discrimination?
MR. SPIEGELMAN:

Nona whatever.

I would point out,

though, that there is in the —
Q

Did he testify later at all?

MR. SPIEGELMAN:
Q

No.

In the arbitration hearing?

Did the arbitrator testify anywhere as to

this —
MR. SPIEGELMAN;

No, sir.

motion and it was decided on papers.

This was a summary judgment
I point out that the

record does indicate that there was the following question and
answer with respect to what happened in the deposition:

8
"Questions

When you took the stand, did you try and

water down the race issue also?”
This was a question of petitioner.
"No, I didn't.

He said:

1 held it up and at the time 1 told

them that I had already filed with the city commission because
.

.

.

. )

1 could not rely on the union.”
That later position makes clear that the city commis­
sion referred it to the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.
O

Had he in fact before the arbitration hearing

referred this discrimination claim to the Colorado city com­
mission?
MR. SPXEGELMAN:

Yes, sir.

In fact, the EEOC had

this charge before the arbitrator decided.
Q

There is not one word of "race” in his letter at

all?
MR. SPXEGELMAN:

Not one "race," unless you take

preferential discriminatory treatment to mean race.
Q

How in the world could you do that?

MR. SPXEGELMAN:

Well, all I can say is that petitioner

in his deposition did indicate that that was what ~~
Q

But he didn't say "I was discriminated against

because of race.
MR. SPXEGELMAN:
Q

No, sir.

He might have been discriminated against because

finding.

Or his 'anion membership or —-

There is not a word of "rae®” in the arbitrator's

He didn't mention "race” once.
MR, SPISGELMAN:
Q

That is correct.

Weil? how under the sun can we assume rac® was

before the arbitration committee?
MR. SPXEGELMAN:
arbitrator decided it,

Well, X don't believe that the

X think the argument is that, since it

was raised before the arbitrator —
Q

Well, as I understand, only evidence that it was

raised was this letter,
MR. SPXEGELMAN:

Well, the petitioner's question and

answer, which X gave you, the statement by petitioner that he
said that he had filed with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission,
was apparently made before the arbitrator.
Q

But he didn't say "I raised it there,” he said

“X raised it over in the other placa."
MR. SPXEGELMAN:
Q

X would agree with that.

Well, then, where do you suppose the Court of

Appeals got the idea that
MR. SPXEGELMAN:
Q

Well ~

What was the basis for its finding?

reading from its opinion:

X am now

"The issue of racial! motivated

discriminatory employment practices was presented to the
arbitrator and rejected.”

10
MR, SPI.'IGELMAN:

I don’t know on what basis, unless

it means by rejected that it refused to consider it.

But it

did not — there is nothing in this record to indicate a re­
jection of the issue of race.
Q

But surely you concede that the arbitrator did

find that the discharge was for just cause? isn't that right?
MR. SPIEGELMAN:
Q

Yes? sir.

Well now? wouldn’t that mean that he did find

that it wasn’t by reason of racial discrimination —*
MR. SPIEGELMANs
Q

No.

— because that was a provision of the Collective

Bargaining Agreement? as you told its?
MR, SPIEGELMM2:

Ho? I don’t think so? for this reason;

The arbitrator did not touch on the issue that petitioner raised
in his letter.

The specific issue the petitioner raised in his

letter was that others had been performing the same amount of
scrap and that they had not been discharged.

How? that is an

issue which, i£ there is a racial component, that is if whites
who^ere performing that way were not discharge and he was, that
there could have been a just cause for dismissal, but that if the
practice was not to dismiss for such conduct then even though
there was just cause, there could have been & racially discrim­
inatory action in this case.
Q

Well, there could have been just cause under a

Collective Bargaining Agreement that provides that there cannot

11
be any discrimination on the basis of race if there were racial
discrimination,

isn’t that correct?

MR. SPIEGELMAN;

Well, the arbitrator — that is

correct — the arbitrator lira!ted his decision very carefully
to the facts that were presented to hira.

I note that on another

issue, h® was offered the statement from the union that it was
company practice to send the trainee who performed poorly back
?
i

•'■■■•

to the position from which he transferred, and the arbitrator
said he hadn't been given any evidence on that.

There is

nothing in this record to indicate that he had been given any
evidence about the comparative treatment of people who were
performing poorly in the drill trainee jobs, so I think it
would stand on the same status.
Q

Well, the issues of this case, X gather, go

perhaps considerably beyond the specific facts of this particu­
lar arbitration.
Q

Wouldn’t your argument be the same even if they

heidn’t been raised?
MR. SPIEGELMAN:

I believe that -- our argument is

that whether or not the issue is rased, arbitration should not
prevent the right to sue in federal court.

Now, the District

Court's decision in this case relied on the sole ground that
petitioner’s pursuit of his contractual remedies through arbi­
tration barred his action under Title VXI.

And the court pur­

ported to rely on Dewey v. Reynolds Metals, which has been

12
before this Court and was affirmed by an equally divided court.
The Deway rationale is that the submission of a griev­
ance to arbitration prior to submitting the grievance to —
submitting a claim to the EEOC, constitutes an election against
a Title VII process.
The Court of Appeals affirmed in the memorandum opinion
which essentially relied on the District Court's opinion.

Wow,

we believe that as an initial matter it is clear that the
federal courts have plenary power over charges of racial discrim­
ination, regardless of the arbitration process.

Thus, if the

court, the federal courts are to refrain from hearing a case,
it is not because of their lack of jurisdiction but because of
some other reason made by the court.
Wow, the theory apparently offered under Dewey and
that which apparently the District Court relies on is a theory
of waiver.

I submit that in this case and in all cases thus far

where grievances have been filed, it is not proper to talk in
terms of waiver.
First let’s take th® facts of this case.
manifested a direct intent not to wait.

Petitioner

H® filed charges with

the appropriate federal authorities, he informed the arbitrator
that he had filed those charges, he informed the arbitrator that
he thought his representation in this case was inadequate, and,
in short, he did everything he could to follow his federal rights.
To talk in terms of an expressed waiver in this case

13
I don't think would be proper»
New, can we have an implied waivar in this case?
Again, I don't think that would be proper.

We are talking

about a fundamental civil right here, and we are talking about
a layman making a decision, and I don't think that it is the
custom to imply waivers of such important rights.
I would add that in the circumstances of this — of
grievance proceedings in general, we not only have the fact that
the layman is making the decision, but he is making it under a
very, very short time limit.

That is, under this very contract

in this case, he will automatically make the discriminatory
discharge valid if he fails to grieve it in this contract in
five days.
Q

Mr. Spiegelman, are you raising another issue

in the case of ineffective assistance?

And, if so, do you

think that could be attributed to the employer, the consequences
of ineffective assistance?
MR. SPIEGELMAN:
Q

Well, I don't know —

Or is that an action, is that a proceeding against

the union?
MR. SPIEGELMAN:

Well, no, 1 don't think that the

issue is necessarily ineffective assistance.

The labor law

makes it quite clear that the union has a wide variety of
actions it can take.

It must merely not act in bad faith in

term3 of its duty of fair representation under the labor law.

14
must not b© arbitrary or in bad faith.
Now, the union and the arbitration processes is one
that contemplates that in fact the union doesn’t hire lawyers
for these arbitration processes.

Very often, the arbitration

is conducted by a union arbitration man who has had no legal
training.

So the process itself is one that I point out is

designed for the benefit of the employer as well as the union.
The employer, regardless of the outcome of any grievance, gets
labor peace by a no.-strike clause, which is the quid pro quo
through his arbitration agreement.

So that no matter what hap­

pens in the grievance, whether the employer wins or loses, he
has already got what he bargained for, and that is that the
union will not strike over this issue, and he can enjoin such
strike under Boys Market if the union does strike over such an
issue.
So the employer gets what he bargains for the minute
the case goes to arbitration.

How, for these reasons, we think

the waiver theory is inadequate.

The other theory advanced by

courts and not relied upon by the District Court in this case
was the theory of deferral.

The deferral theory is that the

arbitrator has adequately dealt with the issues and it will
save judicial time and energy not to deal with these questions.
We point out that the Civil Rights Act embodies a
fundamental commitment on the part of this country to end racial
discrimination, and that mere judicial economy is not an over-

15
riding consideration as against this important a policy.

None­

theless , we believe that deferral to the arbitrator's award is
not an appropriate way even in terms of judicial economy to
deal with important civil rights.
Now, in doing this, 1 want to stata very clearly that
we do not need to denegrate th© arbitration process as an ef­
ficient way of dealing with normal labor disputes.

The arbitra

tion process is well embodied in the labor law and is working
efficiently to deal with fast, speedy, efficient relief of par­
ticular law of feh@' shop kind of questions which are character­
istically raised.
We do believe, however, that there are things about
the arbitration process in racial cases which make it inappro­
priate to use it as a method for -— as a process to which to
defer.
Q

Well, this is a racial case, and part of the

argument, the argument that I think you are about to make, and
that is made in your brief is confined to th© racial situation.
Surely, the principle that you are espousing cannot be confined
to racial discrimination, can it?
MR. SPIEGELHAN:
Q
for example.

No, sir.

It also includes discrimination based on sex,
And 1 suppose that — how many are there, 25

million employees in the United States covered by collective
bargaining agreements, something like that, over 90 percent of

16
them have arbitration provisions of the agreement?
MR. SPXEGELMANs
Q

Yes, sir.

And over half of the grievances have to do with

discharge, is that right?

I think I read that somewhere in the

briefs,
MR. SPXEGELMAN:
Q

Yes, in respondents.

And X suppose most if not all employees are

either ma*. or women, aren't they?
MR. SPIEGELMAN:
Q

Yes, sir.

And so wouldn't any employes who is discharged

have a discrimination claim, that he was discharged because he
was a man or that ho was discharged because he was a woman.
MR. SPXEGELMAN:
Q

If in fact he has such a claim —

If she wsis dischasrged because she w&3 a woman.

MR. SPXEGELMAN:
can raise such a claim.

If he or she has such a claim, they
In order to bring such a case into the

federal court ~
Q

We are talking at least potentially now about

just a little bit of added burden on the courts.

We are talking

about a tremendous dual trial of these things, aren't we?
MR. SPIEGBLMAN:
Q

I don't think so.

Potentially?

MR. SPIEGBLMANs

Let me say first of all I think that

the grievance process may in fact screen out a lot of these
cases, that is they will decide a large number

17
Q

Well, prior to arbitration, you mean?

MR<, SPIEGELMANs
tion,

Prior to arbitration and in arbitra­

Often the employee wants — all the employee wants is

someone t© ~~ someone neutral to determine this issue.

The

arbitrator’s finding may in fact satisfy him, win or lose.

Now,

if he does — if the employee does choose to follow the EEOC
route, 1 point out that the person still has to bring the case
to court, he has got to find the lawyer or be appointed counsel
to bring a case to court.
Also, prior to anything getting to court, he has to
go through the whole EEOC process, which is a rather timeconsuming process, and also offers opportunities for concilia­
tion by the federal authorities.
Q

You referred to screening out a good many of

these potential claims, they would b® screened out in the
grievance, and than you said also in the arbitration.

But will

they be screened out in the arbitration in cases where the
employer prevails on your theory of this case?
MR. SPIEGELMAN:

I believe they will where the em­

ployee feels that the employe® has gotten a fair shake.

Now, X

understand that it is possible, if the employee —
Q

You mean the option is to be left exclusively

with the employee, then, whether ha will have another bite at
the apple?
MR. SPIEGELMAN:

Yes, X think that even respondent in

18

this case has Indicated that regardless of what the federal
court's rule is# the employee would be able to file charges 1—
that Is at least, the respondent's position -- even if he lost
the arbitration, that is the EEOC would process his claim and
the EEOC could in fact go forward in this*

So even under that

circumstance, it would not prevent the case from getting to
EEOC.

The question Is whether these claims in fact would come

to court, will lawyers take these claims.
...

I doubt that they will.

If they are doubtful,

It is tough enough to get a lawyer to

handle a civil rights cas© that is meritorious.

It seems un­

likely- that these individual claims will in fact be those that
are largely burdening the courts.
Now, 1 would say that there are overriding consider­
ations here though, and those arc that the process of arbitra­
tion oxvas its existence to a. collective bargaining agreement
-.Si

t.,

which itself may violate Title VII.

Therefore,' the union repre­

sentative there has a built-in conflict of interest because -the
union itself may be liable on these very charges.

This creates

also problems because the employer and the union, not the In­
dividual, choose the arbitrator.

We must remember that the

union's interest acting in good faith still involve a variety of
trade-offs and choices which it must make and it is representing
the majority members of that union under the labor law, and
perfectly good faith decisions of the union may in fact disad­
vantage a Title VII plaintiff.

IS
Now, I would finally add that the arbitration process
is simply not. equipped to deal with the subtle issues of dis­
crimination.

This Court recently, in McDonnell Douglas had

occasion to deal with the difficult questions that arise in
proving even an individual case of discrimination,
For example, the Court indicated that th© statistical
data is relevant to determining such a claim.

Now, without a

discovery process — and it is normal that there is not a dis­
covery process — there is no opportunity to bring this kind of
evidence before th© arbitrator.

Also there is no cross-

examination in the arbitration process.

And having tried a

number of Title VII cases, the fact is that the crossexamination of the company witnesses is on® of the key bases
for proving a case of discrimination.
For these reasons, we believe that deferral is not
appropriate for Title VII cases.

We would also point out that

on the record in this case, the arbitrator didn't decide the
race issue.

He didn't say anything about it.

Ha specifically

said there was no evidence dealing with that.

So I think that

deferral

in any case is improper in this ease.
There is also the issue of the effect of the deferral

on — of allowing deferral on the grievance process itself,
will discourage people from using the grievance process and in
fact charm©! all these claims into the federal court because
people are afraid of getting an arbitrator who is not sensitivo

20
to these claims,, rather than the federal court.

For these

reasons, we think that the decision below was improper.
With the Court's permission, I will reserve —
Q

Well, are you going to deal at all, or is govern­

ment counsel, with the question of, if you are right in your
basic claim, that an arbitration does not wholly bar a law suit
under the federal statute, what effect if any should a court
give to an arbitration award?
MR. SPXEGELMAN:

Well, 1 am anticipating that the

government is going to deal with that question.
Q

All right.

MR. SPIEGELMAN:

Our position though is that it should

us© it as evidence and nothing more.
0

Thank you.

MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Wallace?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Douglas,

and may it please the Court:
In the spring of 1971, when this issue was before the
Court in Dewey v. Reynolds Metals Company, Solicitor General
Griswold, Assistant Attorney General Leonard and General
Conns©! Hebert, of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
filed a brief and the government participated in the oral argu­
ment.

That case resulted in a £ our-to-four division in the

21
Court»

It involved an additional troublesome issue not present

in this case.
Now, with new incumbents in ail three of those offices.,
the government undertook a complete restudy of this question in
light of the experience gained in cases decided since that time,
and in light of the scholarly commentary which has bean pub­
lished on the Dewey case.

Practically all of it, 1 should add,

critical of the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in Dewey»

And

the conclusions we have reached, in the brief filed with, the
Court in the present case, are the same in ail respects as the
position that the government took in the Dewey case.
Because of the widespread availability of grievance
procedures, pointed out by Mr. Justice Stewart, under collective
bargaining agreements, the question presented in this case seems
to us of great public interest.

Its answer may well determine

whether the statutory rights against discrimination conferred by
Congress in Title VII, as interpreted by the courts and by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, whether those rights
will be widely observed and even-handedly enforced or whether
those rights will in substantial measure be superseded by the
so-called law of the shop which is implemented by arbitrators
who interpret and apply the terms of various private collective
bargaining agreements»
Now-, the position we take on this issue is the posi­
tion that has been taken by a majority of the courts of appeals

22

■that have addressed it.

The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth,

Seventh and ninth Circuits have all held that the invocation of
the arbitration process of the grievance process and its use
does not bar suit under Titia VII.
able in those circuits»

This has proved to be workt­

They are not inundated with a large

number of law suits seeking in another form to relitigate socalled the questions that have been decided in the arbitration
process.
Indeed, the same question could be raised about some
of the duplications of remedies that Congress specifically pro­
vided for in Title VII, where it said that. the. remedies avail­
able again to millions of employees — I don't have the figures
— before state and local fair employment practices commissions
should be preserved but should not bar the federal remedy, if
they prove unavailing.
This is the approach that Congress used.

And indeed

our starting point in this case is the federal statute itself,
which confers a right of individual access to the courts for
its enforcement and specifies in detail the prerequisites for
that right of access,

nowhere does the statute suggest that

the right to a judicial determination is waived by the avail­
ability or by the use of the grievance procedure under a collective agreement.

The whole background of the legislative

history was that Congress meant to preserve existing remedies,
such as remedies that might exist before the National Labor

23
Relations Board, which were specifically referred to in the
legislative history, and remedies in other forms.

And to add

to those the newly created rights and remedies as specifically
provided for •—
Q

Do you think the federal statute makes unenforce­

able the promise to arbitrate a grievance involving a racial
claim?
MR- WALLACE:

I don't believe it makes that unenforce­

able at all.
Q

Well, so the employer, if he is sued in court,

you think the employer can

even if he has to go forward with

the court suit, can get an order to arbitrate the claim?
MR- WALLACE:
is right, Your Honor.

With respect to the contract issue, that
All the arbitrator decides is the issue

of the contract.
Q

And if the arbitrator decides some facts, such

as he was not fired because he was a Negro but because he had
too much scrap, has that any significance at all in the court
suit?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, this is the most troublesome

issue, and we concluded that it should not have any significance
in the court suit.

It has great significance in the arbitration

It ends the issue under the agreement, except in a

very limited judicial review

To the Titi® VII issue, because Congress

claims of individuals that don *t threaten work stoppages the way

be unfair labor practices, ©van though Congress has provided
another way ©Iso of settling unfair labor practices,
MR. WALLACE:
Q

That is correct, but that is —

The courts certainly will not entertain arbitrable

disputes where they might be unfair labor practices, if there is
a promise to arbitrate them.
MR. WALLACE:

Disputes of that kind are basically dis­

putes between the workers as a collectivity, the union that is

25
representing them and the employer»

The union is a majorifcarian

institution and isr like the employer, concerned ©bout protect­
ing most of the workers in the shop from unnecessary disruptions
of the work process, and these disputes are closely tied in with
the law of the shop and the expertise of arbitrators.
Here Congress decided that rights of individual mem­
bers of minority groups should b© protected, rights that had
proved not to b© adequately protected in the majoritarian pro­
cesses that prevailed in the collective bargaining process and
in the adjustment of grievances.

Indeed, Congress had to

specify that these rights would fos available against unions as
well as against employers.
Q

Not only minority groups, it includes discrimin­

ation, as I said earlier, on the basis of sex and surely one
sex or the other must be in the majority in this country.

1

think it is the women, isn't it?
MR. WALLACE:

The majority in the country but not in

the work fore©.
Q

But in a plant they might be in the majority.

MR. WALLACE;

They might be, and it is rather unlikely

that their rights won't be respected in a situation in which
they are in the majority.
Q

But their demands might not be.

MR, WALLACE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And if a

member of one of these groups can show that his statutory rights

26
were violated, Congress lias specified that he should have a
remedy.
Q

Well, he doesn’t need to show, he just needs to

— in order to file a complaint, he merely needs to allege,
doesn’t he?
MR. WALLACE:
Q

That is true in any field of law.

Exactly.

MR. WALLACE:

It is true with respect to statutory or

constitutional rights.
Q

Well, you seem to make a sharp distinction, both

in your brief and in your arguments, between rights arising out
of the contract and rights arising out of the statute.

But is

it not true that this contract provides for protection against
discriminatory action against employees?
MR. WALLACE:

There is a simple provision in the con­

tract relating to discrimination.

Whether that is coextensive

with the X&w under Titi® VII is highly questionable and is an
issue which the arbitrator had no occasion to address and which
ordinarily the arbitrator has no occasion to address.

The law

of
Q

If the arbitrator in a given case addresses him­

self feo the claim of racial discrimination and decides it
adversely to the employer, the man is reinstated, is he not?
MR. WALLACE:
rights.

Yes, he is, as a matter of his contract

27
Q

Yes.

MR. WALLACE:

He is reinstated as a matter of his con­

tract rights —
Q

But he has all the remedies that he can get or

not?
MR, WALLACE:

That depends on the terms of the collec­

tive agreement, because the arbitrator’s powers are drawn entire
ly from the collective agreement,
Q

Well, in this case he —

MR. WALLACE:

And the questions of back pay and so

forth that might be available under Title VII are a question of
the intent of the parties to the collective agreement.
Q

If he had expressly raised and vigorously pressed

the claim of racial discrimination in the arbitration, would you
think that the scope of the remedy would have been any less than
under the statute?
MR. WALLACE:

I have no reason to think it would in

this case, but I couldn't know until the arbitrator expressed
himself in what his powers are under the agreement -0

The normal remedy would he reinstatement and back

pay, wouldn't it?
MR, WALLACE:

That would b© the normal remedy, Your

Honor.
Q

Well, I take it, Mr, Wallace, the government’s

position must he that even if he prevails on a claim of racial

28

discrimination in arbitration, he would still have a right to
pursue his Title VII claim,
MR, WALLACE:

We take the position that double recovery

should not be allowed.
Q

That may be but he would still be permitted to

pursue a statutory —
MR. WALLACE:
Q

That is our position.

He wouldn't have any damages.

MR. WALLACE:• It may be —
Q

He wouldn't have any damages.

MR. WALLACE:

He wouldn’t have any damages.

It may be

that would be- reason why he would want to secure an injunction,
which he has a right to under the statute, if he can prove that
he is entitled to it.
• i.

*■

Q

I se©.

Q

There might be a different measure of damages.

MR. WALLACE:

I understand.

That’s right, there might be a different

measure of damage.
Q

Incidentally, Mr. Wallace, did the legislative

history — I don’t notice in your brief any reference to this —
address itself particularly to the question of —
MR, WALLACE:

Not of the grievance procedures or of

arbitration, no, it was not mentioned in the legislative history.
It did — there was reference to proceedings that may bs avail)
-•
able under the Railway Labor Act or the National Labor Relations

29
Act.

Senator Clark mentioned on the floor that those would be

preserved, including proceedings before the National Labor
Relations Board.

We do refer to that excerpt from the legis­

lative history.

Here we can deal only by analogy with the fact

that the statute on its face specifies that numerous remedies
are to be preserved and th® new remedies are to ba added to
them and —
Q

Incidentally, does Arguelies decide this case?

MR. WALLACE:
suasive authority.

Well, we think Arguelies is very per­

T© us this case is in many respects ranch

stronger than ArgueiXes because here Congress was familiar with
the wide use of arbitration which was not true when the
Arguelies statute was passed.
Q

Yes, but Arguelies in Arguelies, he went direct­

ly into court, ha hadn't gone to arbitration.
MR. WALLACE:
Q

That is correct.

And the court itself realizes that that is ■—

that Arguelles mad® a substantial difference.

The court in­

dicated that he could go to arbitration if he wanted to.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, we think it would be contrary to

the encouragement of the arbitration process that is an import­
ant part of the federal labor policy to put a premium on not
invoking the grievance procedures.

We don't think that should

make a difference.
Q

Mr. Wallace, didn't Mr. Justice Harlan make the

30

fifth vote in the case?
MR, WALLACE:
Q

Yes, he did.

And he specifically said that he has a choice,

and he said the.least desirable would be permitting or requiring
pursuit in both courts.

So Arguelies might be a very substantial

authority for deciding this case against you.
MR, WALLACE:

Well, the Arguelles case was one in

which the statutory right was closely interwoven with the rights
under the contract and with interpretation of the contract which
was a major point made in your dissenting opinion in the case,
Mr. Justice.
Q

Well, that is not quite responsive to the issue

because Mr. Justice Harlan, I would think, would have come out
quite the other way if there had been a resort to arbitration
and the madn had lost.
MR. WALLACE:
the Court.

Well, that wasn't the issue decided by

On the other hand, in McKinney v. Mi3souri--Kansas-

Texas Railroad, in 357 United States, when Mr. Hustice
Frankfurter was writing for a court that was unanimous on this
issue with respect to the Universal Military Training and
Service Act, h® said that it would be inconsistent with the
purposes of that statute to insist that fcha veterans first
exhaust other possibly lengthy and doubtful procedures.

The

clear implication being that the statutory remedy would be
available to him even if he had first exhausted the other

31
remedies? so that to the extent a majority of the Court has
commented on this issue, I think a majority of the Court has
commented consistently with our position.
G

Well, in McKinney was there a clen.se in the con­

tract which basically gave him the same rights as the Veterana
Preference Act?
MR. WALLACE:

I don’t think there is in this case

either,. Your Honor.
Q

Well, is that a negative implication, that you

are saying no, the answer to my question is no?
MR. WALLACE:

I don't know the answer there,

1 don't

believe the collective agreement is recited in the opinion.

But

the Court is familiar, from cases like Griggs and McDonnell
Douglas, with the great complexity of the law under Titi® VII,
and to say that this can be equated with a single sentence in
a collective bargaining agreement that will be applied by
arbitrators who may or may not be lawyers, with representation
by union representatives who may or may not be lawyers, may or
may not be familiar with the complexities of the case law and
how to develop one of these cases, which requires usually
statistical proof, the processes of discovery and the various
ether court procedures that make such proof credible and mean­
ingful, such as cross-examination, @t cetera, I think would be
doing a great disservice to the effectuation of Title VII of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

32
My time is expired,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Good?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT G. GOOD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GOOD:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

I am Robert Good, from Denver, Colorado, representing

the respondent here, Gardner-Denver Company.
Prior to submitting the company's legal position, I
would like to highlight a few of the facts involving Alexander’s
case.

He had been twice warned prior to his discharge.

On the

first of those occasions, the company volunteered 80 extra hours
of instruction and study to Mr. Alexander.

On the second of

those occasions, he was disciplinarily suspended for two days.
And, of course, on the third occasion ha was fired.
Immediately upon his firing, he and the union invoked
the four-step grievance and arbitration procedure.

Early in

those steps, he submitted to the union his letter which in part
accused the company of discriminatory treatment.

That letter

was read to the arbitrator at the hearing.
The contract proscribed employment discrimination and
also proscribed any discharge not based on just cause,

It is

true that Alexander filed with the state commission prior to
the arbitration hearing, and the EEOC assumed jurisdiction also
prior to th© arbitration hearing.

It is also true, however,

that seven months after th© arbitrator’s award, the EEOC found

33

no probable, cause to believe that Gardner-Denver Company had
violated the act relative to Mr. Alexander's discharge.
Q

Incidentally, was any reference in either of the

state proceedings — X gather the company was party, of course,
both to the state proceeding and the EEOC proceeding?
MR. GOOD:
Q

This is true.

In either did the company make reference to the

pendency of the arbitration?
MR. GOOD:

It is difficult to answer that, Mr. Justice.

In the state proceedings, they were terminated without explana­
tion.

And the Colorado practice is, they could vary well be,

explanations having nothing to do with an indication of guilt
or innocence — caseload, for instance.
EECC assumed jurisdiction, and so we can't cell any­
thing from the state proceedings.

In the federal proceedings,

the company did submit, although this is not in the appendix,
did submit the arbitration award in the investigationi

Y--

Q

And was the EEOC determination of no probable

\

causa made in the light of that submission?
MR. GOOD:

We do not know, Mr. Justice.

Incidentally,

some concern was raised here that the issue of race was not
before the arbitrator.

If I may briefly direct the Court's

attention to soma of the testimony of Mr. Alexander in that
deposition — this is contained at page 13 of th© appendix —
a question of Ms*. Alexander:

"Now, at the arbitration, who

34

was it that raised the issue of race?

"A

Mr. Bert.*

Mr» Bert was his union representative.
55Q

How did he raise that?

"A

By the letter that 1 wrote him, explaining my

position and what I had discovered.H
Q

Is that

the same

letter that is in the appendix?

I

begyour

pardon, Mr. Justice?

Is that

the same

latter that is in the appendix?

MR. GOOD:
Q

MR. GOOD:

This is the letter that is in the appendix,

V

yes, sir.
Q

And what in that letter says race?

MR. GOOD:

Nothing specifically says race.

There is

an allusion to preferential discriminatory treatment, and Mr.

Alexander —
Q

That means race?

MR. GOOD:
Q

Does that mean race?

MR. GOOD:
Q

I bag your pardon?

It does in the context of this case.

Well, when do you know in the context of these

cases that a Negro got preferential treatment?
MR. GOOD:
Q

Would you repeat the question, please?

Where in the interest of cases like this can you

name me where a Negro got preferential treatment?
MR. GOOD:

Well, as you will notice from a review of

35
this particular letter,, it was a joint draft between his pastor
and himself, and you will notice that it is not in the highest
of art form.

The language selected, of course, is clearly

layman's language,

A review of that letter in several instances

shows that.
Q

But do you think that letter gives a basis for a

claim of racial discrimination honestly?
MR. GOODs
later description
Q

Yes, sir, when combined with Mr. Alexander’s
when he —

,

Well, do you mind if 1 don’t?

MR. GOOD.

Not at all, sir.

Incidentally, in the?

lower court, the employer moved, under Rule 56, on a motion for
summary judgment, alleging that race was before the arbitrator
and it ought not ba ralitigated in District Court.

Interesting­

ly enough, Alexander in the lower court never did deny that
race was before the arbitrator.

And, of course, as you know,

under Rule 56 he can com© forward with counter-affidavits or
other evidence to indicate that th@re truly is a question of
fact.

He earns forward with no such statement nor any statement

that the arbitration proceedings were not fair and regular.
i

Q

I gather that his position is that if at all was,

that it had bean there expressly, and that if it had been de­
cided against him, nevertheless he still has the statutory
j

claim, i That is basically his position, isn’t it?
i
!
MR. GOOD: Yes, sir.

36
Q

I suppose that is the one that you have to

address, isn51 it?
MR. GOODi
Q

Yes# sir»

Well# that is a position he has to take.

MRc GOOD;

Indeed he doss.

simply stated, is that an employes

The company's position,
having statutory claim can™

not be required to submit his claim to the arbitration process.
He may, however, do so voluntarily if the collective bargaining
agreement gives the arbitrator jurisdiction over 'that claim,
and when he does so he must be bound, except to the extent that
considering the overriding public policy considerations in the
Civil Rights Act, the District Court function must be that of an
overview of the arbitration, ex post facto, that is, after the
arbitration.

And when the Title VII is filed, the District

Court should review it to determine first if the statutory issue
was before the arbitrator; second, did the contract give the
arbitrator jurisdiction over it; and, third, of course, did the
final opinion in the award of the arbitrator offend any of the
underlying policies in the Act.
If the answer is appropriate in each of those in­
stances, deferral ought be granted.
Q

This does mean that in each instance under your

submission the District Court has the duty to make that much of
a review?
MR. GOOD:

Yes, Mr. justice.

37
Q

You don’t at all say that 'the fact of arbitration

bars access to the federal court under the statute?
MR, GOOD:

That is correct.

We say th® court main­

tains the power —
Q

And the duty to give at least that much of a re­

view —
MR, GOOD:
Q

To give an overview.

— and if th© court finds that none of those con­

ditions is met, then 1 gather you would say that it is the
court's duty then to proceed to consider the claim under the
statute.
MR. GOOD:

Yes, indeed, despite the provisions of

section 301 and Steelworkers trilogy because of the overriding
public interest in the matter.
Q

Ye3, that's right.

Q

Mr. Good, at the appendix page 42, where Judge

Winner’s opinion is found, where he is quoting from the Deway
language, it seems — where h@ says, the paragraph beginning
'7

"Faced with this dichotomy of authority — the second pentane©
-« "We hold that when an employee voluntarily submits a claim
of discrimination to arbitration under a union contract griev­
ance procedure — a submission which is bidding on the employer
no matter what the result ~ the employee is bound by the
arbitration award just as is the employer.”

1 think it would

be fairly easy t© read that as indicating that Judge Winner

38
at least had not reviewed the arbitration award at ail# but had
simply treated himself as being bound by it rather categorically,
which sounds inconsistent with what you. say the District Court
should do,
MR, GOODs

l think, Mr. Justice, one could lend a dif­

ferent reading to your quote there.

The District Court, Judge

Winner, in employing this language, could be inferring we have
the power to permit Alexander to proceed, but in this case,
since it was a voluntary submission, the award should foe con­
sidered final and binding, and —
0

Well, that is exactly how I read it.

But I

thought you were conceding that something more was required of
the District Court, not merely a voluntary submission but that
the District Court should in effect review

in kind of a clearly

erroneous or substantial evidence on the record basis the
arbitrator9 s award.
MR, GOODs

Yes, that is correct.

And I am saying that

the District Court hare conformed to that, policy.
\i

You will note

•

for several pages the District Court examined the underlying
public policy of the Civil Rights Act before reaching his de­
cision, and so he certainly was attempting to examine the
arbitrator's award in light, of those policies.

He had already

found that race was an issue before the arbitrator' under the
Collectiv® Bargaining Agreement,

He then, es I read it, Mr.

Justice, declines to exercise the power of the court to permit

39
Alexander to proceed.
Q

I understood you to respond to Mr. Justice

Stewart that the District Court had a duty to examine the arbi­
trator’s process to see at least that the issue of racial dis­
crimination had been treated.
NR* GOOD:

Is that your position?

No, sir, only to initially determine was

the statutory right before the arbitrator, and —
Q

What is the difference between that and what I

said?
MR, GOOD:

0

And whether it was decided, that's all.

MR. GOOD:

Q

Perhaps none, Mr. Justice.

Whether it was decided.

Not whether it was properly decided but whether

it was before the arbitrator and whether it was decided.
MR. GOOD:

Q

Precisely.

Is that your position?

MR. GOOD:

Yes, except —

Q

And that is —

Q

He has one mors condition.

MR. GOOD:

Except to the extent that the final opinion

and award cannot offend the underlying policies of this public
policy statement.
Q

Well, I just don't understand what that —• what

review then to determine that is mad© by the — of the arbitra­
tor's award is made by the District Judge?

40
MR. GOOD?
Q

Yes.

What doss he do?

What is his re-view?

What

standard does he apply to determine whether or not the arbitra­
tion award offends the underlying public-policy of Title VII?
MR. GOODs

On a preliminary peek he determines, as

here, that in the arbitrator’s award did he do anything to offend
the policies of the Act and. —
Q

That is any different, is it, than in the case of

other arbitrations?

An arbitrator is not supposed to decide a

case before him contrary to the Labor Act, for example.
supposed to be consistent with the law.

He is

And if a plaintiff

comes in and alleges that the arbitrator has disregarded a pro­
vision of the labor law, he can get some review, can’t he?
MR, GOOD:

-The only review in that particular case, Mr.

Justice, would foe exercised, 'I would think, by the NLRB, and
that would not be a review, it would —
Q

Well, I don’t know, if somebody sues in court to

enforce an arbitration award and the enforcement is resisted
on the grounds the arbitrator had acted illegally, is the District
Court just going to order compliance without answering that
question?

1 just wonder if you are really saying an arbitra­

tion award in this context is subject to any different review
than it is anywhere else, and 1 don't know why you would say
that.
MR, GOOD:

Well, perhaps that is correct, Mr. Justice.

41
I have been looking at
Q

But if that is your answer to Mr. Justice White's

question, Title VII gives this petitioner nothing because he
could have that sort of a review of the arbitration award with­
out the benefit of Title VII.
MR. GOOD:

Well, this is true.

Titia VIX, however,

is an explicit statute designed to preserve the privileges of
the minority employee.

It surely would have been a foolish

sounding Civil Rights Act for it to read that your employment
rights are enforceable under your agreement and the final arbi­
trator's award shall represent the state of the law as Congress
sees it.
Q

But you take into consideration that the court

is to ba bound an arbitration where no witnesses are sworn, no
cross-examination, and no discovery?
MR. GOOD:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice, because —

On a statutory right.

MR. GOOD:
of the employee.

Yes, because here the key is the consent

Title VII gave that employe© a right to sue

his employer, and thereiis no question about that,
is the possessor of that right.

However, he

As the possessor, he can use

it fully by filing a full Title VII class and individual action,
he can use it, partially, as Alexander did, by filing only an
individual action; he can use it not at all, or he can submit
it to another forum.

The key is the consent ©f the employee.

42
Q

Consent of the employer?

MR. GOODs
Q

Employee.

MR. GOODS
Q

Employee „

Yes, sir.

I can't conceive of that at all under Title VII.

You se®, my trouble is Title VII gave the employee a right of
the full plenary hearing, discovery, everything under the sun
that his lawyer could think up, and in place of that you say he
gives up by taking arbitration where, one, he doesn't have his
lawyer; two, h© doesn’t have a court procedure, he doesn't have
sworn testimony.

So he is not taking two equal forums.

MR. GOOBs
Q

I agree, Mr. Justice.

He is taking ths lesser forum ncsw.

How do you

account for the fact that while this lesser arbitration was
going on he made it clear that he preferred his Title VII rights
during that arbitration hearing?
MR. GOODs

If I may answerthat in two ways, Mr.

Justice.
Q

Well, how can you say he gave it up if he filed?

He did file while it was pending, didn’t he?
MR. GOODs

Yes, indeed, he did.

ently than ccunse! doss.

We view that differ­

Her® is a man who presses race, the

racial issue before the arbitrator, and at the same time, simul­
taneously invokes th© state procedures under the statute.

When

he thereafter proceeds to press the arbitration racial issue,

43
he is indicating# one# that he has knowledge of his statutory
rights because he has already filed under the state and# two,
when he presses that issue he is indicating his selection of
the two areas or the two remedies.
Q

This is a layman with no training in law?

MR. GOOD:

Yes, sir.

But you should remember here, he

had access to the state civil rights agency and to the federal
civil rights agency at a point prior to his submitting the
racial issue to the arbitrator, and surely that indicates that
h© had as good advice as is available anywhere in the land
today.
Q

Well# the EEOC people did not advise him on the

arbitration , they couldn51.
MR. GOOD:
Q

Ha is then in the hands of the union.

MR. GOOD:
Q

Of course# that is correct.

That is correct.

But wouldn't you think that the layman in his own

mind now really was thinking that "I have my chances with both
and that one is not succeeding so 1 had better make sure I get
in on the other one."
MR. GOOD:
Q
waived it.

Is that what you —
I am sure he was, Mr. Justice.

Well, what is wrong with that?
That is not waiving it.

MR. GOOD:
Q

You said he

He is trying to get both.

He was knowledgeable of his statutory —

Don't you agree that he was trying to get both?

44
Do you agree on that?
MR. GOOD;
Q

That 'he was trying to get both?

Yes.

MR. GOOD;

He certainly is.

Today he is still trying

to get the other hal £.
Q

What is wrong with that?

MR. GOOD:'
Q

Well, because., Mr. Justice —

That is the issue in this case.

MR. GOOD;
that prevail hare.

Yes.

We cannot ignore certain statistics

Aa stated earlier, there ar© ,160,000 collec­

tive bargaining agreements in the United States covering 2S
million employees, 94 percent of which have binding arbitration
clauses, and today 69 pereant of those agreements have nondis­
crimination clauses.

Now, Alexander3s case is only the tip of

the iceberg.
Q

Well, what about the Fifth Circuit?

MR. GOOD:
ferral as do we.

The Fifth Circuit, in Rios, recommends de­

However — and 1 presume that is what the

Justice is talking about, the Rios v. Reynolds Metals — there,
they recommend deferral on the seven stringent criteria.
recommend what we call the liberal deferral policy.

We

We find

the Rios deferral policy unworkable and destructive of the
arbitration process.

First, under the Rios deferral policy,

the arbitration has to compare favorably substantively and proeedurally with a hearing that the claimant would have in the

45
U.S. District Court.

Further, the U.S. District Court, in de­

termining whether to defer, has to hold a hearing that 2 think
in length and complexity is greater than a nom&X Title VII
hearing.
Q

I ask, in the context, are you saying the court

was going to be so inundated?

Has the Firth Circuit had a great

increase in these cases?
MR. GOOD:

The Rios decision, Mr. Justice, is only

about five or six months old, and so I cannot answer your
question.
Q

Is there anything in the Act that you can point

to that backs you up on that point ©f giving away to arbitra­
tion?

Is there anything in the Act or the legislative history?
MR. GOOD:

There is nothing — the Act is totally

barren of any reference to prior arbitration award.

I submit,

Mr. Justice —
Q

And you agree

—

the legislative history is

too, isn't it?
MR. GOOD:

Yes.

But I submit, Mr. Justice, when you

consider fch© statistics I have mentioned ~
Q

Congress knew those figures.

MR. GOOD:
whole point.

Yes.

They had to — they just missed the

Surely, with those tremendous statistics, whether

they were to permit the arbitration to stand ©r to deny it
enforcement, they would have said on© way or the other, with

46
this totally pervasive structure of our industrial relations
staring them in the face, they just missed the'boat, and it is
up to this Court to make a reasonable accommodation between
these conflicting interests.
Next, Mr. Justice Marshall showed some concern that
the employee is participating in a forum where the -scope and the
dimensions of the hearing he receives is something different
than what h© would receive in the U.S, District Court# and this
is surely true.

However, this Court has previously acknowledged

that those differences do exist.

This was in the Arguell.es case.

Those differences do exist* and they are not repugnant.
Justice Harlan, in Bulk Carriers, stated it -this way:
’’This Court has always recognised that the choica of forums
inevitably affects the scopa of the substantive right to b©
vindicated before -the chosen forum.

In particular, where arbi­

tration is concerned, the Court has been acutely sensitive to
these differences,”
And he goes on further, at a later point:

"Normally,

the impact on the substantive right resulting from the decision
t© reraot the individual to the arbitral forum is acceptable be­
cause th© parties themselves have consented t© that forum.”
Again, consent, the key here is consent, the employee was given
a right to sue hie employer, he is possessor of that right, he
can use it fully, partially, not use it at all, or submit it to
another forma.

47
Q

Well# he didn’t file the arbitration, did he?

The union filed it?
MR. GOOD:
Q

And who represented him?

MR. GOOD:
Q

The union filed it.

The union did.

And Titi® VII says he should have the right of

action and he should have a Sawyer.

Now, in the context of

Title VII, we have a different situation.

He didn't have a

lawyer, he had the union.
MR. GOOD:

It was by his choice, Mr. Justice.

It is

not part of cur preraise — or I should say part of our premise
is that if an employe®, if this ware possible, were required by
the union and the employer to process an arbitration claim that
involved a Title VIS issue, if he disavowed that at any point
he would still have his Title VII yet available to him because
h© was —
Q

Wasn’t it disavowed when he filed his Title VII

action during the arbitration?
MR. GOOD:

Didn’t he?

But he commenced the state procedures, he

filed the Title VII action after the arbitration.
Q

When he started his state proceeding.

MR, GOOD:
Q
1

That is correct.

Didn’t that say WX disavow this," didn’t it say

don’t trust this?
MR. GOOD:

Or what did it sav?
It said ~

48
Q

It certainly didn’t say he was satisfied with it.

MR. GOOD:

No, sir.

It says to me that 2, Alexander,

am aware feliat I have these alternate remedies, but 2, Alexander,
choose to press this discrimination claim in this arbitral forum.
Q

In both, you said before both.

MR. GOOD:

When he preceded with the arbitration, 1

submit, he made his selection at that, point.

He showed his

ability to keep it, to withhold it from arbitration, he showed
his knowledge ©f -the statutory procedures.
Q

Wait a minute.

Nevertheless —

He showed the knowledge of the

statutory procedures when arbitration was filed?
MR. GOOD:

Yes, he had already filed with the state

agency
Q

I thought that was after arbitration had started.

MR. GOOD:

No, sir, he filed with the Colorado Civil

Rights Commission shortly after his discharge, ©ad the EEOC
assumed jurisdiction before the arbitration also, so both
agencies had taken jurisdiction prior to the arbitration.
Q

Well, what was going on with the arbitration in

the meantime, it just wasn’t there?
MR. GOOD:

It was ascending through the grievance

steps, Mr. Justice.
Q

That is what I thought.

MR. GOOD:

Q

That is what I thought.

Now, you recall, though —-

Arid then he got dissatisfied with his

49
representative, the union.
MR. GOOD':

He says so a year later,, after he has lost

the arbitration, yes.
Q

Sof is that good?

MR. GOOD:

Well, we can't say h© was dissatisfied at

the point of -the arbitration, which brings me to another point.
Counsel stated that we ought to allow the arbitration process
to fcak© place baeaus® ©f what I interpret he was saying "its
therapeutic value.”

I submit to you that it has a lot of good

therapy if the employe© wins, but if he loses it exacerbates
his feelings of resentment and we have a Titi® VI1 action.

If

w© doubt that, just look at all the cases we have cited in
these various briefs, all on this issue.

And guess what?

Always, in the arbitration, h© lost.
Q

Your concept of his having options that you seem

to be pressing, do I understand you to mean that he might —
the employs© might, as a matter ©f choice, ignore all th®
grievance procedure, all ©£ the arbitration procedure, and elect
to proceed under the statuta right away?
MR. GOOD:
Q

Yes, indeed.

And if he did that, you would not think you had

any defense by way of asserting that the arbitration clause had
to be exhausted?
MR. GOOD:

Mot at all, compared t© Maddox, compare

with Maddox, whera the court said thou shalt exercise your

50
administratis© remedies„

That was on the contract, however.

Her© it is a statute with an overriding public intereat.
Incidentally, in making the assertion that lie cannot
be forced to arbitration, we not only relied on a little words
of. section 706 that say® you do have a right to sue your employer,
we relied on U.S. Bulk Carriers v« ArgueI3.es.
that case.

And it is true In

Justice Harlan did say that 'the least satisfactory

of all solutions is the necessity of suits in both forms.
Now, my opposition points out that — or they suggest
that the 1972 amendments to the Civil Rights Act indicate a clear
congressional intent that no other forum, was to substitute for
a Title VII District Court forum.

It is true that the '72 amend­

ments direct the EEOC to give "substantial weight to final
orders or decisions of state or local authorities,”

However, we

view that as a ccstraint of Congress that an employee —* Congress
has required to use the state procedures, their concern that an
employee be required to be bound by state procedures which contain infirmities or potential infirmities.

Indeed, Senator Clark,

in th© legislative history of the Civil Right® Act, expressed
exactly that concern.

H© stated, "State and local fair employ- •

ment laws vary widely in effectiveness.

In many areas, effec-

tive enforcement is hampered by inadequate legislation, inade­
quate procedures or an inadequate budget.55
.

!

And you will recall that now Congress requires the
employe© to first use those procedures.

So the concern of

51
Congress was that no other sovereign or lav/ or procedure re­
quire the employee to accept less than his full day in court
under Title VII if he so chose.
Q

Mr. Goodp I just had a chance to look at Rios.

Did 2 understand you to say earlier that this went too far or
didn't go far enough, the procedure -MR. GOOD:

Insofar as it ruled deferral, it went ex­

actly as far as we would go.

Insofar as it defines the rules

for the District Court under which referral was proper, it went
much too far, wa say, it is destructive of the arbitration
process and unworkable.
Q

Well, apparently

it says first the contract

must coincide with the statutory rights.
MR. GOOD:
Q

Mo question about that.

Second, it must be plain that the decision of

the arbiter in no way violates the private, rights vuaranteed by
Title VII —
MR. GOOD:
Q

Yes.

— or feh@ public policy which adheres to Title

VII.
MR. GOOD:
Q

No problem with that.

In addition, must be satisfied (1) the factual

issues are identical to those decided by the arbiter — right?
MR. GOOD:
Q

I see.

I begin to argue at that point, Mr. Justice.

52
MR, GOOD:
Q

.and a subsequent point -~

Secondly,, the arbitrator*a power under the col­

lective bargaining agreement to decide the ultimate issue of
discrimination —»
MR. GOOD:

0

— you don’t have any problem with that?

MR. GOOD:

Q

Y©S.

I hav© no problem with that.

Third,, the evidence presented at the arbitral

hearing dealt adequately with all factual issues.
MR. GOOD:
Q

Yes.

You have trouble with that?

MR. GOOD:

That one, and non© of the remaining ones,

Mr. Justice.
Q

The arbitrator actually decided the factual is­

sues presented to the court?
MR. GOOD:

Does that bother you?

Well, yes, insofar as I am bothered by the

one preceding it, that is the evidence presented at the arbital
hearing dealt adequately with all the factual issues -Q

Well, how about the fifth one, 'the arbitration

proceeding was fair and regular and free of procedural infringe­
ments?
MR. GOOD:
Q

So it is really the second, third and fourth then?

MR. GOOD:
0

Mo problem.

Yes, sir.

You think they give — they interfere too much

53
with the arbitration process?
MR. GOOD:

Yes, not only with the arbitration process

but it imposes a duty on the lower court to hold a hearing that
in its magnitude and complexity would go far beyond going ahead
with this Tltl© VII ferial.

For instance, Mr. Justice, the

I believe you called it the third one — the evidence presented
at the arbital

hearing dealt adequately with all the factual

issues.' Well, first the court has to determine what were all
the factual issues and, secondly, what would b© the factual
Issues if we had a Title VII trial.

In other words, did the

arbitrator know all the issues.
Q

So, actually, then, you come down to as far as

the District Court should go vrauld. be to determine that the
factual issues before it are identical to those decided by the
arbitrator, number one, and that the arbitration proceeding was
fair and regular and free of procedural —
MR. GOOD:
Q

Would you repeat that, Mr. Justice, please?

Well, the first is, the factual issues before it,

that is the court, are identical to those decided by the arbi­
trator.

I thought you said you would go with that.
MR. GOOD:
0

Ho?

MR. GOOD:
Q
and four.

Ho,

I disagree with that.

Well, all right, that eliminates one, two, three

54
MR. GOOD;

Ko, sir, X do not eliminate two.

The

arbitrator had the power t© determine the issues.
Q

That the court can look to.

MR. GOOD;
Q

Yes.

How about five, the arbitration proceeding was

fair and regular and free of procedural infirmities?
MR. GOOD;
Q

M© problem.

So it is just those two then that you think is

the extent —
MR. GOOD;
Q

Thera is a third one.

Which one?

MR. GOOD;

The evidence presented at tha arbifal hear­

ing dealt adequately with all the .factual issues.
Q

Well, do you agree with that?

MR. GOOD;
termine that.

Not insofar as the District Court must de­

We all know from trial experience, even in the

pretrial conference, we do not agree on what all the factual
issues are, and there ar® sub-factual-issues, and always in
trial other issues come up.

The judge, under this burden of

Rios, would have to hold a hearing that would certainly be
lengthy, it would be a retrial of the arbitration hearing, and
in fact the District Court would have to substitute in many
instances its judgment.
0

Mr. Good, under your theory of the deferral, if

the employer could came in in an action to set aside the

55

arbitration award, assuming it had gone in favor of the employee,
and make the same sort of showing that you are talking about an
employes making under a Titi® VII action, would the employer
then foe entitled to hav© the arbitration award sot aside and a
proceeding directed to that end?
MR. GOOD;

If h© went in under section 301, do you

mean, Mr. Justice?
Q

Yes — wall, whatever section you go in to have

an arbitration award set aside.

Say you are opposing a judicial

action to confirm the award or enforce the award.
MR. GOOD:

Yes.

How, I did not understand your ques­

tion, Mr. Justice.
Q

Well, you are talking about the showing that must

be made fov an employee in a Titi® VII case, th© type of pro­
cedure the District Court should follow to decide whether or
not to defer to the arbitration award.
MR. GOOD;
0

Yes, sir.

Supposing that in a case not involving discrim­

ination, an employe© brings action to enforce an arbitration
award in his favor, is the standard that the District Court is
to employ there any different than the kind of standard you are
talking about here?
MR,. GOOD;

Yes, in most cases, where* there is no

statute involved, the District Court exercises its normal func­
tion to determina did th© arbitrator have jurisdiction and

56
whether the proceeding was fair and regular.
Q

Wells so is this basically the same thing or is

it something added because of Titia VII?
MR. GOOD?

We add one thing, and I am not so sure,

after listening to Mr* Justice White that we are adding that on®
thing, we are at least underlining it, and that is that the
court must examine the arbitrator's opinion and award to see if
it patently offended the underlying policies of the Civil Rights
Act.
Q

Well, are you saying that the arbitrator may not

just disregard the applicable substantive law?
’ v

:

>

. '• $

MR* GOOD 5
Q

Well, yes, whatever the applicable laws are «—

MR. GOOD ?
Q

1

Yes*

-- in these areas.

MR. GOODs
Q

Civil Rights law?

Yes.

I don't suppose an arbitrator can just say, well,

don8t really, in deciding whether some arbitration, if it is, a

provision of the National Labor Relations Act is relevant to it,
I' suppose he. must not decide contrary to what the law provides.
MR. GOOD;

This is correct, in view of over 30 percent

of the arbitrators, Mr. Justice White.

There is a small minority

who disagree with that.
Q

Mr. Good, this sounds like what was said in Rios,

second, it must be plain that the arbitrator's d@ei.sion is in no

57
way violative of the private rights guaranteed by Title VI1 nor
©f the public policy which inheres in Title VII.

Didn't you say

to me earlier that you agree with this?
MR. GOOD:
Q

I agree with that.

Well, if you do, why doesn't a judge, a district

judge, to be satisfied with this, have to go through as extensive
a hearing as concerns you?
MR. GOOD:

Because ha can tell on the face of the

arbitration and some — well, on the face of the arbitration ha
can tell whether it patently offends the underlying policies of
the Act.

Q

I 8@©.

Q

Mr. Good, thus far the Fifth Circuit stands alone

in its enunciation of standards, doesn’t it?
MR. GOOD:

Well, except to the extent, Mr. Justice,

that the District of Columbia Circuit, in the Macklin case,
which was shortly after Rios, seemed to agree with Rios.

How­

ever, in Macklin, the court predicated that decision on a state­
ment that they read into the Steelworkers' trilogy, a "federal
policy of deferral."

Well, that is a very presumptuous reading,

considering the case we ara right here now talking about.
Q

Are there are some esses in the courts of appeals

or this Court that indicates that an arbitrator is not bound by
a relevant provision of the substantive law —
MR. GOOD:

No, Your Honor.

58
9

— and may disregard it?

MR® GOOD:

No? Your Honor.

The reason I made the state

meat 1 did is that I attend all these labor law conferences and
there is always an isolated arbitrator who gets tip and makes the
statement that we- have all heard so often? "X am merely a
creature of the partiesK

and "X am only what the parties make

me? and if they tell me to violate the law and" —
Q

Well? do yon know? are there some cases then that

say the arbitrator is bound by the substantive law?

Let’s assume

for example? la this case the arbitrator- decided there was no
racial discrimination in this case within the meaning of Title
VII, whereas a decision of this Court had construed Title VII to
bar precisely the conduct that was at issue before the arbitra­
tione

Now? is there same case that says the arbitrator must

follow the law?
MR. GOOD:

I am unaware of any that say exactly that.

I am aware of this Court's assumption, that an arbitrator will
follow the law, especially in preemption matters where they have
fought the problem.
One item mentioned in my opponent's brief, and which I
think bears some response, Alexander appears1 to the sense of
fairness of this Court? and he states in there that if David? in
the biblical confrontation with Goliath? had two stones to a
sling h@ would not have been unfairly armed for that confronta­
tion? and thus by analogy, says Alexander? if Alexander? i.e«?

59
David, has two cracks at my client, i.e., Goliath, there is
nothing wrong with that.

And then at that point -they go on to

recite six different statutory procedures now available for an
employ©® to proceed against his employer, all of which are free,
non® of which ar© exclusive, to all of which the employer must
respond, and to which he is bound in the ©vent of an adverse
determination in any on® of those four.
Take all of that, add to it the fact that the amend­
ments now apply the act to a business having as few as 15 em­
ployees, and you have to wonder, who in the world is David and
who is Goliath in this industrial civil rights confrontation,
Mr, John Pemberton, Deputy General Counsel of the
EEOC, former Deputy General Counsel, even in his position, was
able to show some pity for the employer in this dilemma.
describas the dilemma as follows?

He

*„..!£ th® number of them

[multiple employee remedies] is not awesome enough, th© lack of
finality in any decision on behalf of the respondent certainly
poses a defendant's nightmare."

Surely, Congress, in defining

Titi® VII, did not intend a nightmare of litigation for anyone.
It only intended to create a very powerful tool with which t©
eliminate employment discrimination.
For all of these reasons, we ask the Court to adopt
th® policy of liberal deferral, to find that the lower court did
conform to that policy, and to affirm for those reasons.
Mr. Chief Justice, absent any further questions, I

60
submit the case on behalf of my client, Gardner-Denver Company.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, Mr. Good.

•o

Mr. Spissgalman, you have about four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. SPIEGELMAN, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE" PETITIONER
MR. SPIEGELMANj

I would like to first, deal with the

question of voluntariness, which is the cornerstone of the
respondent's argument.

We have a case here whore the choice of

arbitration was made by a union.

There is nothing in the record

fc© indicate for on® instant that the petitioner had any right
to withdraw that grievance one® the union went ahead with it.
The point mad® by counsel here that EEOC advised
plaintiff with respect to his rights here is contrary to the
facts.

The EEOC told me h® had a right to sue, they issued him

a right to sue letter.

Moreover, as a matter of fact, when a

man files a charge with the EEOC it gets put in a file and it
may be six months or eight months before ha ever hears anybody
on that.

So the notion that EEOC provided him any assistance in

this ease is absurd.
Now, 1 think that we must deal with the issues of why
should th@ra be a deferral policy.
questions, arguments mad®.

There have been a number of

The government has told us that the

Labor Act is ilI“S©rved by a policy of deferral, and I can tell
you, as a private lawyer, if you have a deferral problem, 1 will

61
advise every cme of my clients not to us® the grievance machin­
ery «

-The federal courts will* if anything* be inundated by a

deferral rule because all the clients are going to take their
case to the federal courts* where they have much more adaquate
proceedings.
Q

I thought you told us earlier, counsel, about how

difficult it was to get a lawyer in a case like this.
MR. SPIEGELMAN:

I would say that, with respect to my

client, I would advise him, 1 currently advise him to follow the
grievance machinery, and if there is a deferral policy I will
advise them otherwise.

I think it will increase the burden of

litigation.
Q

You mean only in terms of Title VI! cases?

MR. SPIEGELMAN:

In terms of Title VII cases, that is

correct»
Q

Only.

MR. SPIEGELMAN:
Q

Yes.

Well, do you think really that if the arbitration

machinery is only enforceable by on© side of the contract that
eventually the employer would ever be forced to go to arbitra­
tion?
MR. SPIEGELMAN:

I don91 know the answer t© that.

I

would say this, that —
Q

Well, your advice to your clients raay be futile

if the employer isn’t bound to go to arbitration.

62
MR. SPIEGELMMf;

Well, what 2 am saying is that with

respect to labor act policies, a policy of using both remedies
further serves that policy, enforces the union agreement.

I

would say that the employer is getting an advantage here because
he already got his quid when the arbitration is filed.
he has got union peace.

That is what he bought.

That is,

He is now

trying to get. a license to conduct practices which the arbitra­
tor says is okay.

With respect to the law, the question you

asked earlier about arbitrators and how they act, we cited three
cases in our brief in which the arbitrator refused to follow
Title yil concepts in making an award.

Mow, it may be that the

arbitrator would, not order illegal conduct, but he may refrain
from ordering conduct that is required under the act.
Mow, with respect to the economy point, I think we
have indicated that economy just doesn't work,
stay out of this.

The courts can't

Mr. Justice Stewart's question about can't

they fil® — they can always file, and they always have to go
through the deferral process.

There is no way out, bringing

these cases out of federal court in the first instance, because
the courts have power.
I point out further that the argument here that the
courts would be inundated by a deferral policy just doesn't hold
up.

Bow®

v. Colgate.

has been on the books for a number of years, Bowe
The Seventh Circuit doesn't defer at all.

There •

is no evidence here of any deferral policy, any inundation of

63
the courts»
I would also point out that with respect to this issue
of employers

dropping their arbitration clauses, 1 think that is

wholly speculative.

We have had the Chamber of Commerce, with

all its resources, com© her© and file an amicus brief, and the
best they can do is cite statistics that there are a lot of
snti-discrindn&tion clauses.
The fact of the matter is, however, that arbitration
is the way of life, it is a strong process, it is going to be
used regardless of whether or not we adopt a deferral policy,
and for the reasons w® have indicated we believe that deferral
just simply isn't proper.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, gentlemen.

Thank you, Mr. Spiegelman.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 11:31 o'clock a.m., the case was
submitted.]
