CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER»

We will hear arguments next,

in 72-955, Spomer against Littleton.
Hr. Sagel, you my proceed,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B» 2AGEL ON
BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SAGEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas© the

Court, this is, as was referred to in the previous argument,
the next case involving the States Attorney.
If it would help the Court, I will give a brief
outline of the standing of the various parts of th© Seventh
Circuit judgment and the appeals taken therefrom.
The Seventh Circuit indicated that there would be
equitable relief available if the case were proven against th©
two State judges.

That part of th© Seventh Circuit appeal is

the subject of the previous, case.
The Seventh Circuit also indicated that there would be
mandatory Injunctive relief available against the States
Attorney of Alexander County, and that part of the Seventh
Circuit suggestion is the concern of this case.
Thera is a third petition for certiorari filed on
behalf of Peyton Berbling, th© immediate past States Attorney
of Alexander County, and his investigator Earl Shepherd, and
the police chief of Cairo, Illinois, Chief Meisenheimer.
That petition concerns the portion of th© judgment having to

3
do to the extant that it does with injunctions against
QUESTIONS

—

Is that pending?

MR. SAGELs

That is pending.

petition has not been ruled on.

That is pending.

The

That concerns whatever remains of

the injunction with respect to Barbling and I suspect nothing
remains, with whatever remains of the injunction with respect
to Shepherd and Meisenheiraer, but principally that third case
is concerned with the damage holding of the Seventh Circuit,
The only two cases that are before this Court in
terras of certiorari having been granted have to do with the
injunctiv© relief.
Now, the question has been raised during the course
of the previous oral argument with respect to the fact that
States Attorney Spomer was not named as an original defendant
in this case and that there are no specific factual allegations
against him.

The

brief for the petitioner Spomer does not

raise that argument, and it was a decision by Mr. Spcraer
consistent with my advic© to him that whatever defense he would
have and whatever claim he would have with respect to the
correctness of the Seventh Circuit judgment on the basis of
the carryover of the allegations of Berbling to allegations
against Spomer, that he should not and he so decided that he
should not raise that point.

The waiver that we make with

respect ho any claim that the allegations with respect to
Berbling do not carry over to Spomer may give this Court an

4
indicatio», of how significant the basic underlying issue is,
both to th© States Attorney of Alexander County and to State
prosecutors generally in this country.
QUESTION:
MR. ZAGEL:
QUESTION:

Is this © jurisdictiona1 problem?
I think it is not a jurisdictional problem.
If these people have never experienced

anything at th© hands of the latest prosecutor, is there any
case of controversy between them and th© prosecutor?
MR, ZAGEL:

I think there is sufficient casa of

controversy.
QUESTION:
MR. ZAGEL;

A statutory claim under 1983 or 1981?
I think there is a sufficient statutory

claim against the office of the States Attorney of Alexander
County.
QUESTION:

In essence, he wants to stand in Barbling’s

shoes in order to test out th© underlying constitutional issue.
The question really is whether that involves perhaps an advisory
opinion.
MR• ZAGEL:

I think not.

I think not.

I am, of course,

aware of the fact that such a contention can be made, and it's
certainly an arguable one.
QUESTION:

You don't, urge that your waiver -is binding

on us, do you?
MR, ZAGEL:

oh, no.

No.

I have don© many things

in the course of ray practice before courts of the last resort,

5

but words of "binding," "cannot,r and "have no power" are words
I do not use.

This Court can despite the waiver made by

Spomer decide that there exists no case or controversy.

I

suggest that there are vary sound reasons —
QUESTION:

What ie there in the complaint that goes

against the office?
I JR. ZAGELs

There is — the complaint is specific

with respect to those actions that took place while Barbling
was the States Attorney.

Not all of the specific allegations

have to do with Bsrbling himself.
the staff in his office.

Some of them have to do with

It is true that in each of the

allegations Berbliag's name is mentioned.

There .are two

things that ought to be pointed out to the Court.
The first is that there has been no allegation or
no claim,

despite the fact that one could be made, that

Spomer, the States Attorney, has changed any of the policies
that Bsrbling exercised.

And in fact there is the affirmative

act of Spomer in substituting himself for Burbling in this Court.
QUESTION:

It sounds like a case where somebody is

charged with the crime of murder and his successor comes along
i

and says, "I am also guilty."
MR, ZAGELs
so.

Well, I don't think so.

I don't think

I think that one —
QUESTION:

Is there anything in this record that

shows that the successor in office intends to do what the other

man did?
HR, ZAGELs
QUESTION?
MR. ZAGEL?
QUESTION;
MR, ZAGELs
QUESTION;
MR* ZAGEL;

No.
It’s not in this record.
Well, yes, I concede that point, but
Doesn’t that cut you off?
No, I think not.
Recordwise.
No, I think not.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will resume there

after lunch.
(Whereupon, at 12 noon, the oral argument was
recessed until 1 p.m. the same day.)

7
AFTERNOON SESSION
(1 p.m.)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. ZAGELj

You may continue.

Mr. Chief Justice —-

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will allow you a little

extra time since yon seem to have been interrupted, Mr. Zagel.
MR. ZAGEL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court, to return to the point that we had
departed before, so fax as I can tell in the brief period of
time that I have had to review materials, and I find almost
no decided cases on this point, the only indication I have with
?

respect to substitution of parties is a line in Stearn and
Gressjaan oil Supreme Court practice which indicates, that the
substitution is based on tha assumption that the successor
will continue the policy which was responsible for the litiga­
tion and that if that policy is not to be continued, it is
the burden of the substituted official to make a motion to
prove that tha case is moot.

And as I have indicated before,

there is nothing in this record, nor will there be on the part
of ray client, to indicate that he would change the policies
which are alleged to have been exercised by his predecessor.
QUESTION:

You mean that your client

says he would

do all the things that were alleged in this complaint?
MR* ZAGELs

I think that my client's position is

that his policy would not deviate free» the policy of his

8
prodecessor.
QUESTION:

I asked a specific question that he intends

to do the type of things that, are alleged in this complaint.
MR, EAGELs

I think he would concede that he would

do the acts that it is alleged that his predecessor —
QUESTION:
MR, EAGELs
QUESTIONS
MR. 2AGEL:
QUESTION:

He admits that the allegations are true?
For purposes of this litigation —
I'm asking, does he admit them?
Yes.
Not for the purpose of this litigation.

Does ha admit them or not?
MR, 2AGEL:

Does h® intend to do these things?

To answer that question I would have to

go outside the record, which I am willing to do, but I would
have to go
QUESTION:

I didn't ask you to go outside the record.

QUESTION:

What if the allegations as alleged amount

to a crime under 242?
MR, ZAGELs
QUESTION:

Wall, if the allegations —
That's what he says he's going to violate

the Federal statutes?
MR. ZAGEL:

Wall, if they do constitute a crime under

the Civil Rights Act, and one of the points that was made, one
of the points suggested is if the allegations of th© complaint
are truss, one of the appropriate remedies for the plaintiffs
below was to seek Federal prosecution of the States Attorney.

9

That is one of the alternatives.

And if the policies that are

being followed by this States Attorney and by his successor
constitute Federal crimes, then there should be Federal prosecu­
tion.
QUESTION:
posture

I suppos® you axe trying to say that your

- is necessary to try to preserve this litigation

for the larger issue which you talked about before lunch.
hr,

ZAGEL:

Yes, it is necessary not only to preserve

the litigation generally for the larger issue, I rather suspect
that the policies followed by Berbling and stripping of the
general conelusory allegations - the policies followed by
Berbling would as a practical necessity be followed by Spomer.
QUESTION:

Well, the thing that bothers me, Mr.

Zagai, insofar as this is a 1983 suit, 1983 in terms creates
an action only against — I am reading it — every person who
under cover, and so forth, subjects or causes to be subjected
any citizen to a deprivation of rights, et cetera.
don't see how this,. ..

And I

treated as a 1983 action, the successo

comes within it.
MR. SAGELs

I think the successor comes within it

so long as the successor — well, my answer ±3 —
QUESTION»

H® couldn’t possibly have don© any of the

things alleged because he wasn’t in office-at the time those
things were alleged to have been dan®.
MR. ZAGEL:

My answer really is twofold.

The first

10

part of the answer is it's our basic contention that these
allegations if stated against Spomer directly instead of if
BarbXing continued in office would not state a cause of action
under 1983 in any event.

It's our secondary position that

to the extent that they are found to state an action, that
they would state an action against the successor in office,
the substitute party so long as there is no declaration, and
the burden is upon him to make the declaration, that ha is
going to deviate from those policies.
QUESTION;

So if he has said he is going to continue

the policies, if he hasn’t done it, he’s threatening to do it.
MR* ZAGEL;

Well, yes, that would be his status,

although I tend to think there has been no material change so
far as I am aware in Alexander County since December whan
Spomer took over.
It might also be said of the Seventh Circuit that at
the time the ruling was issued, it should have been apparent
to the Seventh Circuit that Berbling would not be in office
after December 5, because he did not run for r©election.
QUESTION;

It appears the Seventh Circuit was as

anxious to keep the litigation alive as you are today,
MR. ZAGEL:
QUESTION;

I think so.

I think so.

of course, the Seventh Circuit's opinion

was handed down before December 5th, wasn’t it?
wasn’t moot. when, they decided it.

I mean it

11
MR, SAGELs

Yes, although it: could ha determined

at the time they issued that, opinion that Barb ling would not
succeed himself in office.

It was impossible for him to succeed

himself in office simply because he had not filed for
reelection, and the filing data was in the previous December.
With respect to the merits of the case, there has
been soma discussion as to whether the argument that is offered
here and I suppose with respect to both petitioners, this one
and the one in the previous cases, whether the argument is
one of immunity or on© of scope of remedy.

For purposes of

this petitioner I don't think it makes a great deal of difference
how you view it simply because whether you view it as an
immunity argument or as a scop© of the remedy argument, tlx©
position the petitioner Statas Attorney is taking is that this
kind of remedy, this mandatory injunction could under no
circumstances in any case ever be appropriately issued.

So

whether the argument is phrased in terms of scope of the
remedy or absolute immunity, its functional purpose from our
view is precisely the same.
I might add also that although I think and agree
with the position of the petitioners in the previous case with
respect to the appropriateness of the remedy directed against
the judges, I would submit that the argument of the States
Attorney is still stronger than that of the judges.

Essentially

what the Seventh Circuit would fore© the United States district

12

judge to do is to exercise his supervisory jurisdiction over
both the trial judge and the State prosecutor.

X think it is

improper that he dess either, but I might say that at least
when it comas to exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the
State trial judge, the United States district judge is doing
something that is not too far remote from what he is expected
to do with his own docket, because a Federal trial judge, of
course, makes decisions as to bail, and so on and so forth.
When it comes to exercising supervisory jurisdiction
over the States Attorney, the court is crossing into the
realm of prosecutor.

And I think for x-easons that we have

stated innumerable times in our briefs, it is a function that
cannot be effectively performed by most judges, and for those
few judges who could effectively perform it, it would be
highly inappropriate to do so.
I might add also that the reason that this ruling
is so particularly crucial for prosecutors throughout the
nation is that there is, aside from situations like those in
Cairo, Illinois, there is in this country a large number of
groups of people who have severe quarrels with the way criminal
justice is run, whose quarrels generally fall on the side of
their view of the insufficient prosecution.

And we submit

that there is a very realistic possibility that if the judgment
of the Seventh Circuit, this remedy is allowed to stand, that
we will open a real Pandora’s box with respect to suits against

13
prosecutors.
Now, the Pandora's box argument Is a common one.
I think that at least half the litigants who argue cases
involving basic principles of law will us© a variation of the
Pandora's box argument, saying if you do this, then the walls
will all fall dawn.

And perhaps there is a hyperbole in that

argument in most cases.
prosecutor.

I think not. in the case of the

There is presently in the state of Illinois at

least several groups who are complaining vigorously, and
although they have not sued yet about what they consider to
be insufficient efforts by the prosecutors to proceed on
given cases, the

most prominent of which in our State is the

Citizens for Decent. Literature who are complaining bitterly
about the failure of various prosecutors to move against
literature that they consider obscene.

There is a group of

people who claim to represent rape victims who are concerned
about the policies of prosecution with respect to rape cases.
There are groups that complain about the prosecutions with
respect to environmental cases.

And I suspect that if the

ruling stands up, most prosecutors who have adopted a policy
of declining anything, any violation of criminal statutes
involving & dispute between a tenant and landlord, I suspect
that both the tenants and th© landlords will be in Federal
court claiming improper prosecution.
And I might add further that purely apart from the

14
question of whether a Federal judge could administer this
rather mammoth remedy that is called for, there is the basic
question —■ and I suppose this is an argument that speaks more
to an immunity argument than to anything else — there is the
basic question of forcing the prosecutor to spend his time in
court and defend his policies with respect to discretionary
declination of prosecution.

The plain fact of the matter is

I don't think any prosecutor could long function if he had
to depose on declinations of prosecution.

I doubt that there

is a prosecutor in this nation who prosecutes more than a
fraction, less than one-half, certainly, more than a fraction
of the cases that are brought to him.

Would he have to come

to Federal court and explain his declination in each and every
one of those cases, even if the case is not made, even if
the petitioner fails to make his case, or the plaintiffs fail
to make their case?

The enormous burden on the prosecutor, I

think, would foe sufficient to justify, as it does in other
areas, the application of an absolute immunity doctrine.

And

it is clear, I might say, it is clear that the Seventh Circuit
contemplated that the Federal District Court would address
itself to individual decisions.

Thera is a certain selective

blindness exercised by the respondents in this case with
respect to what exactly they won, if you want to use that word,
in the Seventh Circuit.

And I quote from the language of

the Seventh Circuit's opinion that said, "An initial decree

15
might: set-, out the general tone of rights to be protected and
require only periodic reports and various types of aggregate
data on actions on bail and sentencing and disposition of
complaints.» The

court expressed,

and I quote, "complete

confidence in the district court's ability to set up further
guides as required and, if necessary, to consider individual
decisions," which appears at page 415 of 453 F. 2d.
So w© are in effect talking about rev let'? of individual
decisions to or not. to prosecute.
There has been citation of authority in this Court
in which Federal courts have exercised what might be called
a pretrial supervision over State prosecutor
him from proceeding in a particular case.

by enjoining

I state as we have

stated in the brief that this is a far different thing from
exercising

a general power to force a prosecutor to prosecute

a ca.se in a certain way.
And I might add that the complaint was not limited
simply to the initiation of criminal proceedings.

There were

elements in the complaint that said that the prosecutor didn’t
present the case competently.

Perhaps the closing argument

didn't appeal to the plaintiffs, or perhaps the way a witness
was examined didn't appeal to the plaintiffs.

You are talking

about very detailed regulation of the way a prosecutor tries
his case, and that is what the Seventh Circuit and certainly
what the plaintiffs contemplate.

16
The fact of the matter is that those cases in which
preliminary injunction have been granted prior to trial or
at least it has been suggested that it might be dona are
really no different in effect than a form of accelerated
appellat® review.

It's a court saying in advance that this

particular prosecution is brought in such bad faith or for
such obvious harrassmant purposes that we are going to stop it
now.

And the basic: premise is that if we did not stop it now,

we would just have to reverse it later.

But it is still th©

review of an individual case.
As I suggest in the brief, there are available

and

I think superior remedias, superior to that suggested by the
Seventh Circuit.

Indeed, I would say that each of the remedies

considered by the Seventh Circuit,including the most Draconian
one of all, which is to say reversal of convictions of people
who were proparly prosecuted because the prosecutor refusas to
proceed against other people, I think that even that remedy
is preferable to the remedy that is involved in this case.
It seems to me what the». Seventh Circuit did was take upon itself,
or if not take upon itself, convey a power to the Federal, district
judges that no court should under any conditions ever exercise.
And that in the power to prosecute.

A Federal judge simply

should not serve as a prosecutor, either in State or Federal
court.

And I think that that is what the Seventh. Circuit

opinion amounts to, a command to a Federal judge that if certain

17
cases are provan, you hav© to preempt the decision of the
prosecutor in State court,
If there ara no further questions, I would like to
reserve the balance of ray tins® for rebuttal,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Wiseman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN M. WISEMAN ON
BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR, WISEMAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, wa named Peyton Berbling as the defendant in our
complaint.

He was the then States Attorney.

Hi.3 term of

office ended December 4, 1972, which was after the Seventh
Circuit decision.
Mr. Sporner on his own substituted himself as the
defendant in this case insofar as the appeal is concerned.
QUESTION s

Where is that in the record?

MR. WISEMAN:

Well, it is in Mr. Spomer's brief, your

Honor, where he specifically said that he substituted himself
pursuant to the rules of this Court.
QUESTION:

You mean it's not in the record?

MR, WISEMANs

other than that, no, your Honor.

There

is nothing in the record to indicate when Mr. Berbling's term
of office ended.
QUESTION:

I suppose that could b® judicially noticed

by th© Seventh Circuit, couldn't it?

18
MR, WISBMAN:
QUESTION s

Yes.

Can we judicially notice the fact that he

substituted himself?
MR, WISEMANx

Well, I think Mr. Spomer is conceding

that fact, and I think that the Court can take note of
QUESTION?
we are at it?

Could I put myself in there, too, while

Isn’t there some procedure?

MR. WISEMAN?

Well, your Honor, tile normal procedure

would be that we would have substituted the other side as a
party.

We did not do that,

I would suggest that the case does

not necessarily have to be deemed moot insofar as this States
Attorney is concerned if tins Court chooses to, for two possible
reasons:
One, Mr, Spomer substituted himself and he is
apparently conceding that he is continuing the practices of
Mr. Berbling,
The second is that an investigator employed in the
States Attorney's office, a man by the name of Mr. Shepherd,
is still employed by the States Attorney’s office.

Mr,

Shepherd's petition is pending before this Court in conjunction
with the petition of the previous States Attorney,

And it

could be stated that Mr. Shepherd's conduct is continuing, and
Mr. Spomer as his supervisor lias ultimate responsibility for
the conduct of his subordinates and is therefore a proper
party

at this time.

19

I would submit f however, that in order for us to
proceed against Ilr. Sporaer, it would foe necessary for us to
investigate the facts to see that the concession, apparently
made by til© States Attorney is true
QUESTION*

Suppose the judge here dies tomorrow

and another judge is appointed.
Mil. WISEMAN;
QUESTION:

and amend our complaint.

Is it still a live case?

I do not believe so, your Honor.

The difference being what?

MR, WISEMAN:

The only difference that I see is (1)

that the States Attorney has made this concession, and (2) that
u subordinate whom we are charging —QUESTION:

Where i3 that concession in the record?

MR. WISEMAN:

It is only in the record of this

argument by counsel for the States Attorney.
Aside from the issue of whether it is moot against
the States Attorney, I would like to proceed to the merits of
the case.
QUESTION:

May I ask just before you do whether

Shepherd has been employed by the present States Attorney?
MR. WISEMAN:

Yes.

And that is in the record in

tills way, that we alleged in our complaint that he is employed
by the States Attorney, and there is nothing in the record to
indicate that he hss terminated his employment.
QUESTION:

So h©

MR, WISEMAN *

as an agent continues.

Yes, your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

And insofar as your complaint was against

his actions as an agent, of the States Attorney, there is a
continuity her©.
MR. WISEMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Isn’t the issue of vicarious liability

under 1983 somewhat unsettled?

isn’t that kind of injecting

a new element into the case if you have to rely on that?
MR. WISEMAN:

To a certain degree it is, your Honor.

But sine© we are seeking equitable relief, a superior is
responsible for the conduct of his subordinates, and whether
it's by acquiescence or active participation in the conduct of
the subordinate, he would have a duty, I believe, to stop that
conduct.

And precedent for this that I am familiar with in

a Seventh Circuit decision is schnall v. City of Chicago in
which the superintendent of police was named as a defendant
in that case solely because h@ was responsible for the conduct
of his subordinates.
QUESTION:

Do you see any similarity between the

kind of continuing monitoring that the Seventh Circuit has
prescribed here and the continuing monitoring that the sixth
Circuit prescribed in Gilligan v. Morgan?'
MR, WISEMAN<
QUESTION:

Your Honor, frankly.*—

That is the National Guard case where the

Sixth Circuit sent the case back to the district court and
prescribed proper weapons and methods and procedures for the

21
National Guard.
MR. WISEMANs

We are not seeking relief that extensive,

what we are seeking is (1) that the States Attorney not turn
a deaf ear to complaints of blacks simply because they are
black.

Ha refusas simply to take the svidance of a black

complainant.
Second, he is refusing to prosecute whites whan, the
victims are black simply because the victim is black.

What we

are seeking is a prohibitory injunction to keep him from using
race as a criterion in the exercise of his office.
And as the Seventh Circuit has suggested so far, that
a reporting system indicating the disposition of cases might
be a start.

It would be for the district court after hearing

again the case in a trial and weighing the credibility of the
witnesses and the parties, to then determine what would be
appropriate relief at the first instance.

We would assume that

once a Federal court issued an order compelling the States
Attorney not to use race as a factor in the exercise of his
office, that the States Attorney will abide by that order.
And it is only if he disobeys that order that further relief
comes into being.
The situation in Cairo is that as a result of the
efforts of blacks to free themselves of the shackles of
the discriminatory conduct of the white merchants and public
officials, that they have been the targets of white criminal

22
conduct; assaults and batteries occur frequently.

In th© course

of their peaceful parading to demonstrate against this
ar© assaulted and battered by whites.

And what happens7 tli%yy

then complain to the States Attorney, and what dees he do?

Ha

refuses to take any evidence? he refuses to investigate.
We brought this action under 1981, and 1981 specifically
says all persons shall have the same right to give evidence
and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings
for the security of persons as white persons.
what

wq

That is precisely

are charging the States Attorney has violated, that

he ■—
QUESTIQN:

That he didn’t give your clients the

protection of the criminal law..
MR. WISEMAN;

Yes,

And that he refuses to do what

the Federal statute requires, and that is to give all parsons
the same right to give evidence as white persons.

He is

refusing to allow them to giv© evidence, although he allows
white persons to giv© evidence when they are th© victims of
black criminal conduct.
QUESTION s

Will the Governor of Illinois have any

supervisory power over local prosecutors as, for example, the
State of New York provides?
MR» WISEMAN;

To my knowledge, the States Attorney

is an independent office, and to my knowledge he is not subjected
to the control of the Governor.

23

QUESTION:

Can't ©ver* be removed by him as they can

in New York?
MR* WISEM&SI?
QUESTION:

Hot to my knowledge.

How about a case last terra, the Linda R.

or Linda S. case on standing, holding the lack of standing in
a person to complain that th© criminal law was not being
enforced so as to protect her?
MR. WISEMAN:

Well, I think that in this case, your

Honor, the blacks who have sued are complaining not only that
the law isn’t being enforced, but that this States Attorney
that is, really, the predecessor States Attorney — would refuse
to taka evidence or .investigate.

In that sense the states

Well, I suggest, your Honor, at least

in the circumstances of this case, that we have stated the

24
necessary allegations for a claim under sections 1981 and 1983.
1 think that the question may he. then to the extent whether
tills Court, or Federal district court should restrain itself
from exercising.th& authority that is present under the
Civil Rights statutes.

And I think first we have to start with

the proposition that this Court has in the past decided a
number of casos in which it has enjoined pending State
prosecution.

I suggest that the standards that have been

established in those cases in which the office of the State
has been exercised in bad faith and in which there was immediate
irreparable harm have been met in this case,
I think the doctrine of quasi-judicial immunity
because of the prior cases in this Court has already been
resolved.

I don't believe the interference by a Federal court

by issuing such an injunction will infringe upon the lawful
exercise of the discretion

of the States Attorney.

First of all, discretion is not unlimited.

It is

limited to abiding by the law and not to seek to annul the
Constitution and the laws of the United States.

This is not

an isolated case in which we have a disgruntled litigant
complaining that he did not have his attacker assailant
prosecuted.

Instead we are claiming that across the board

black complainants do not get re1ief*
It does not involve discretion at all when the States
*

Attorney says, "I am not going to take avidanc©

from blacks

25
when they are victims of white criminal conduct."

Moreover,

when the States Attorney refuses to prosecute simply because
the victim is black, does not involve discretion at all, either,
t

There is no relief in the State court in this
situation.

Where the States Attorney refuses to take evidence,

you cannot appeal to a State court for relief.

Where the

States Attorney refuses to investigate or refuses to prosecute,
you cannot go to a

State court for relief.

One suggestion that Mr. Sparser has made in his brief
is interestingly at odds in the petition of Mr. Berbling,
Mr. Sporaar suggested that a cause of action in damages is
preferable to equitable relief.

Mr, Berbling, of course, is

taking the opposite position in his petition before the Court.
I would suggest that damages would not solve the problem
because it would not prevent the ongoing discrimination.

What

you could have in a situation where you had an action in
damages, is that the white citizens who are against the black
efforts to free themselves collecting a defense fund, and
every time the States Attorney is found liable in damages,
they pay it off, but in the same sense they manage to maintain
their supremacy, they manage to avoid prosecution.

I would

suggest that that would not be a way to solve this problem.
The basic relief -that we are seeking is of a
prohibitory nature, that race not be used as a criterion in
the exercise of office.

I think again that it would be

26
premature to determine what precisely is the appropriate
relief because I think the district court must hear our
evidence first and then fashion what would be considered
appropriate relief by it.
In summary, when citizens are deprived of access to
the criminal justice system, the fabric of a civilized society
disintegrates.

I submit to you, your Honors, that is what is

happening in Cairo,
Thank you,
MR* CHIEF

justice

BURGER:

Thank you, Mr* Wiseman.

You have about six minutes left, Mr. Zagal,
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES 3. ZAGEL
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
QUESTION?

Mr. Zagol, before you get started, if by

any chance you lose this case, are you going to pay the costs?
MR* ZAGEL:

Is vmcf going to pay the costs?

Is my

client going to pay the cost?
QUESTION:
ft1:. ZAGEL:
QUESTIONs

Yes.
That is the customary rule in this Court.
It is a customary rule for a party to.

You admit that you are a party for the purpose of costs?
MR. ZAGEL:
QUESTION:

Mr. Spomer, yes, he is.

Yes,

If the Court accepts the view that he is

a party.
MR, ZAGEL:

Yes.

That would be the natural assumption

27
that if we were to lose the case, Mr. Spower would get a little
bill from the clerk of the court for the costs, and he would
pay it*
With respect to the point on substitution, 1 just
point

out that Rule 483 of this Court provides for automatic

substitution in these cases.
One point that was made by Mr. Wiseman is that -generally has bean, and X suppose is perfectly acceptable, a
tactic for him in the course of argument is to minimize, although
I don’t think he can do so successfully,
scops of the Seventh Circuit's remedy.

the nature and
One of the words he

used is that somewhere we will have to start, and this is just
a start, at determining what relief has -bo be granted.
It's really not the start that so much concerns us,
it's where ‘the finish is.

And no one has denied yet, and no

one has ever offered a credible argument that the limits of
this doctrine are very broad indeed.

And I might add that

even the start has to be a substantial burden on any
prosecutor, even the hearing has to be a burden on the
prosecutor, and the discovery practice as well.

That, too is

a burden, and an unreasonable, one,

Precisely.

doesn’t it put fch© injunction in a different light if what h©

QUESTION?

After all, I gathered from what your

opponent said that all they were claiming and all they wanted
protection against was an intentional and wilful act based
on' race, not a mistake.
MR. ZAGELs

That is correct, that is their point.

29
QUESTION*

And I take it that, if you take that

literally it means that 242 would ba violated by these acts?
MR. ZAGEL*
QUESTION:

Yes, if you take it literally.
Well, doesn't that put the injunction

issue in a different light, if you are enjoined only from acting
intentionally?
MR. 2AGEL:
QUESTION:
MR. 25AG33L?

No, I think.it does.
Would you say the immunity reaches that?
Well, that's precisely my point, if you

view it solely as an immunity matter, my answer to the question
is no.
QUESTION?

Immunity is not

(inaudible)

whether equity should enjoin it.
MR. BAGEL:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And ordinarily you would say equity doesn't

enjoin a crime, commission of a crime.
MR. 3AGEL:

That’s correct.
But here you have a high policy Federal

statute, 19S3 and 1981,
MR. BAGEL*
QUESTION:

Yes.

You also have, as I —

And .1983 having been held to be exempt

from on© of the restraints on a Federal court.
MR„ BAGEL *

Yes,

And in that respect, basically,

I suppose, ray argument then goes to scope of the remedy rather
than immunity.

I think that that is inherent in the fact

that

30

I have made two concessions which, considering the fact that
this orief was filed not only in behalf of Spomar, but in
behalf of the National District Attorneys Association as well, I
think are very substantial concessions:

(1) that there would

be, if the allegations were all true, a remedy in Federal
criminal prosecution, which X think is perhaps the greatest
single

...

? and (2) we would be willing to concede that

if there has to be any remedy at all between private parties
in a Federal court, that that remedy rather than be the
injunction ba damages.

I tend to think that there is a strong

immunity argument against damages as well.

What I am trying

to impress upon the Court is the degree of opposition and the
degree perhaps of maybe outright terror would be the best word
with which State prosecutors would view proceedings under the
Seventh Circuit opinion.
QUESTION:

The idea would be that it might'hot be

so hard to defend himself — might not be so hard to win, but
it would be terribly burdensome defending himself against
perhaps a series of unsubstantiated charges.
MR* ZAGEL:

Yes,

Yes.

Thar® is one final question I would answer with
raspect to the Governor’s power,

The Governor has no power

in Illinois at all over the prosecutor, nor does the Attorney
General except to noil© pros a criminal charge.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
