MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Adams? you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. ADAMS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ADAMS:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice? and may it please the

This case involves the question of the interpretation

of the Bankruptcy Act.

The question is whether a wage-earner’s

post bankruptcy receipt of his tax refund check is property
within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act.
The bankrupt contends that the disposition of this
case should be controlled by this Court’s decision four years
ago in Lines v. Frederick.

In Lines the Court analyzed the

meaning of the word ’’property” and rejected a mechanistic
accounting type approach to defining "property".

For example?

Lines involved the question of whether or not a bankrupt's
vacation pay was property.

It was clear in Lines that the

vacation pay was entirely earned and accrued at the time of
the bankruptcy and it was also clear that the vacation pay
was a result of labor that had been performed in the prebankruptcy past.
The facts in this case are similar.

Mr. Kokoszka?

the bankrupt? was employed for three and a half months in
the year 1971.

Ha claimed the correct number of exemptions

4
with his employer for withholding purposes, and he became
entitled to a tax refund check of $241 because the withholdings
was based on the premise that he would be employed for the
entire year.

Thus, when Mr. Kokoszka. filed his bankruptcy in

1972, his tax refund check, like the vacation pay in Lines,
was entirely accrued and earned at the time of bankruptcy
and it was the result of prebankruptcy labor.

In Lines this

Court specifically stated that the definition of property
cannot be resolved by reference to such questions as the time
of vesting.

Instead the Court emphasized that more traditional

tests, as in Segal v. Rochelle, that property should be
defined by reference to the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act.
In this regard the Court must analyze the relationship of the
asset in question to the debtor’s fresh start and the passible
entanglement of the asset in the debtor’s pre-bankruptcy past.
Utilising this analysis in the Lines case, certain
important factors ware present which resulted in that decision,
and those same factors are present in this case.

For example,

the tax refund check does not represent an investment or a
savings account or some other voluntary form of property.

It

is entirely the result of involuntary actions as the result
of the withholding laws of the United States, as vacation pay —
QUESTION?

Well, the designation of a. number of

exemptions is a voluntary act, is it not?
MR. ADAMS

%

Yes, the designation — but he claimed

the proper number of exemptions, as he should do under the
law in order to approximately end up with either no tax refund
check or no taxes due at the end of the year.
QUESTION:

Would the case be different in your

estimation had he claimed, as he has the privilege of doing,
a number of exemptions that do not coincide with the facts?
MR. ADAMS;

Yes, I do think the case would be

different because in that case, for example, if he had not
claimed as many exemptions as he was entitled to, the fund in
question would be similar to a savings account.

He would

have created a greater tax refund check.
Now, in one of the cases that discussed this issue,
the Cedor case, the opinion of the judge in the Northern
District of California specifically held that because that
part of the tax refund check was a result of voluntary activity,
that it should be regarded as property under the Bankruptcy
Act.

In this case we are dealing with the tax refund cheek

that was the result of no particular voluntary action by the
bankrupt except that he was just complying with the tax laws.
Another important aspect of this asset, an important
aspect that was also present in Lines is that the tax refund
check is not received until after the bankruptcy.
post-bankruptcy

It is a

event, part of the debtor's future.

Like

vacation pay, it is not particularly reachable or payable to
the bankrupt until the time that it is actually received.

6

In Mr. Kokosska's case, he filed his bankruptcy on January 5,
1972.

He filed his income tax return in February, and he

received his tax refund check about two months later.

Thus,

vacation pay, like the tax refund check, importantly is a
post bankruptcy event, part of the debtor's future.
But perhaps the most important aspect of the Lines
case is that vacation pay was entirely wages.

In this case

similarly the tax refund check here is derived entirely from
wages.

It consists entirely of wages.

The bankrupt has been,

compelled to accept the delayed receipt of wages which he
otherwise would have received as a result of the withholding
laws of the United States.

But for the withholding laws, tills

money would have been available for his use, and he would have
used it for his support at the time of his regular paycheck.
The Ninth Circuit decision in the Cedor case and the Eighth
Circuit decision in the Gehrig case focus on the practical
realities of the importance of wages to a bankrupt.
A bankruptcy, as we point out in our brief and as
those courts referred to, is frequently a last resort for a
debtor.

He has used up all his assets by the time he is

forced to go into bankruptcy.

He depends entirely on his

receipt of future wages in order to make his fresh start.
In Mr". Kokosska's case, he earned only $2400 in 1971.

At that

level of earning, all of a person's wages are necessary for
items of immediate support and consumption, as this Court

noted in the ease of James v. Stranche.
Additionally Lines was a confluence of streams of
decisional law both in the Bankruptcy Act and outside of the
Bankruptcy Act.

In Lines the Court quoted and emphasised

its holding in Sniadach that wages t^ere a specialised kind of
property in our system.

Both the Cedor court and the Gehrig

court felt that given the specialized nature of wages and the
condition of the bankrupt, that to deprive the bankrupt of
his tax refund check would work an equivalent hardship as to
deprive him of his vacation pay, perhaps the more so because
the debtor has already been forced to accept the delayed
payment of these wages which he needed.
In any event, the contention of the. bankrupt in this
case is that the tax refund check is as important a part of
the family budget as vacation pay.
Now, the court below, the Second Circuit, did not
apply this same analysis and attempted to distinguish Lines v.
Frederick in this regard by claiming that vacation pay was
a periodic wage payment, like a person's regular paycheck,
whereas this is not.

That court’s distinction, we submit, is

both unrealistic and not. in keeping with this Court’s decision
in the Lines case.

It is unrealistic because a debtor needs

his wages for support whether they are paid to him on a
regular basis or not.
start.

They are just as important to his fresh

3

The Second Circuit’s distinction is not consistent
with Lines v. Frederick because in Lines this Court rejected
focusing on technical distinctions such a3 whether or not the
property was paid in a periodic way or not, and focused instead
on a broader examination of the practical realities to the
bankrupt and the relationship of the asset to the debtor’s fresh
start.
Another important case cited by the court beloxtf was
Segal v. Rochelle.

That brings us to the question of whether

or not this asset is in some i^ay entangled in the debtor’s
prebankruptcy past, the second test which this Court has
emphasised.

The bankrupt's position in this case is that

Segal v. Rochelle does not require a result contrary to what
the bankrupt is urging.

In that case we dealt with a business

bankrupt who was entitled to receive a loss carryback refund.
As this Court noted in Lines, Segal really wasn’t a fresh
start case.

In Segal a business had ceased to operate, and

the job of the trustee was simply to marshal the assets for
the benefit of the creditors.
Also, there is no causal link to the prebankruptcy
past in this case, as the Court found important in the case
of Segal v. Rochelle.

There the Court noted the peculiar

nature of a loss carryback refund check and found that it, was
the result of those very losses which had precipitated the
bankruptcy.

There is no such problem here.

9

Thus, to summarize this part of the bankrupt8s
position, we contend that Lines requires the Court in examining
the definition of the meaning of the word ’’property" focus
on practical realities and to analyze the relationship of the
asset to the debtor’s fresh start.

Lines marked the rejection

of a more mechanical approach to defining property by focusing
on whether or not, when it was earned, when it was accrued,
whether it was the result of prebankruptcy labor.

Instead,

Lines focused on the relationship of the asset to the debtor’s
fresh start.

The fact that it was not. an investment or other

kind of voluntary creation, that it was a post bankruptcy
event, and that it consisted entirely of wages which traditionally
are the only means for a bankrupt to achieve his fresh

..

Thus, in Lines, this Court held that the wages
represented by the vacation pay were essential to a debtor's
fresh start.
Seven months later, in Perez v. Campbell the Court
also held that a debtor shouldn't be deprived of his driver's
license because of the burden that that would place on his
earnings.

The position of the bankrupt in this case is that

the tax refund check, being wages — the loss of the tax refund
check would be as serious a burden on the debtor's fresh start
as the loss of vacation pay or the loss of a driver's license.
The second issue in this case is whether or not
the Federal wage exemption statute, the Consumer Credit

10

Protection Act exempts 75 percent of the tax refund check.
The Court need not reach this issue if it rules in the bankrupt s
favor on the first question.

However, we contend that the

CCPA should apply by the terms of the Bankruptcy Act, by the
tanas of the CCPA for an independent policy reason, and by
reference to administrative materials.
First the Bankruptcy Act.

Many exemption statutes,

State exemption statutes, do not ever refer to bankruptcy.
They are not written particularly with bankruptcy in mind.
But they apply to a person who goes bankrupt because the
Bankruptcy Act requires that they apply.
states in section

It specifically

6 that the bankrupt be allowed all State

and Federal exemptions.

The CCPA, being a partial Federal

wage exemption statute, should apply to bankruptcy by the
requirements of the Bankruptcy Act in section 6.
QUESTION:

Connecticut, as I understand it, doesn't

have any exemptions relative to this case, is that right?
MR. ADAMS:

Essentially that's right, Mr. Justice.

There is a wage * exemption statute which, being smaller than
the Federal statute in this case, would not apply.
QUESTION:

Well, let's assume the Court decides

against you on both of these points, i.e., that the point
you have just completed arguing that the whole business is
exempt or (b) that 75 percent is exempt under the Federal
statute, would there be a Connecticut statute exempting any of

11
this?
MR. ADAMS:

To be honest I'm not sure.

There is a

Federal wage exemption — or I mean, excuse me, Connecticut
wage exemption statute.

It only applies to consumer credit,

garnishments for consumer credit.
apply.

So I don't think it would

But that would be a question of interpretation of

Connecticut law which doesn't presently exist.

In any event,

it would probably only protect about $65 if it did apply.
QUESTION:

And then, of course, be subject to

construction as to whether or not a tax refund is the
equivalent of wages, too.
MR. ADAMS:

There would be a number of problems

interpreting the Connecticut statute to get it to apply
in this case.
QUESTION:

Unlike many States, there isn't, as you

submitted, a State exemption statute that cuts much significance
here at all, is there?
MR. ADAMS:

That's correct.

That's correct.

For

example, in California, which is known for having liberal
exemption statutes, only 50 percent of the earnings
attributable to the last 30 days would be exempt.

So a tax

refund check would come to a very small percentage.
QUESTION:

We dealt with that in Lines or mentioned

it.
MR. ADAMS:

Yes, you referred to it specifically.

12

QUESTION:
Gehrig case.

Mr. AdJams, you cite the Eighth Circuit's

On the CCPA issue the court was unanimously

against it, was it not?
MR. ADAMSs
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
And on the main issue it was two to one

in your favor.
MR. ADAMS:
one, that’s right.

Was it two to one?

Yes, it was two to

Excuse me, Mr. Justice.

Let me just, though, although the Lines issue is
often thought to be the main issue in this case, as Mr.
Justice Blackmun just referred to, the value to the bankrupt
of the application of the 75 percent Federal exemption statute
is an important right which we are seriously urging before
this Court.
But as I was saying, a number of State exemption
statutes apply not because in their own terms they refer at
all to application in bankruptcy, but because of the Bankruptcy
Act.

In the CCPA we have a slightly different statute.

It

should apply in a bankruptcy context not only on account of
tne Bankruptcy Act, but on account of its own terms.

Congress

specifically stated that the CCPA was passed in order to
achieve the uniform application of the bankruptcy laws.
In this case a uniform wage exemption statute
rather than the widely varying wage exemption statutes which
apply in the States.

13

.

Most of the criticism of the CCPA both by the court
below, by the Gehrig court and by opposing counsel, has been
an attempt to narrow the meaning of the terms of the CCPA.

An

examination of that statute, however, shows that it was a
broad statute, very broadly drafted by Congress, and additionally
being a remedial statute, it is entitled to be liberally
construed in favor of achieving its purposes.
Thirdly, there is a policy ground for the application
of the CCPA.

This was noted by the district court in the

Cedor case involving a question of fairness.

It is that the

exemption should not be defeated and creditors should not be
allowed to get the entire tax refund check merely because the
debtor has been forced to accept the delayed receipt of that
money due to the operation of the withholding law.
Finally, in this regard, there are a number of
administrative materials which are cited in our brief which
support our position, our interpretation of this Act and its
application in this situation, and those administrative
materials are entitled to great weight.
In conclusion, an examination of the relationship
of this asset to the debtor's fresh start in the same practical
way that this Court made that analysis in Lines should yield
the result that a wage-earner's post bankruptcy receipt of
a tax refund check is not property within the meaning of the
Bankruptcy Act.

As far as the Federal wage exemption statute

14

is concerned, it should apply here by the terms of the
Bankruptcy Act, it should apply by the terms of the CCPA for
an independent policy reason, and by reference to supporting
administrative materials.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Adames.

Mr. Civiletti.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN R. CIVILETTI
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CIVILETTI:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

We are dealing here with a tax refund claim which

at the time of the petition in bankruptcy was fixed and certain
as to amount and demandable and collectible.
The argument made by the petitioner is that a wag>_
earner

bankrupt’s tax refund claim is not property because

it is necessary to his fresh start,

I think runs counter

to the meaning and the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act, its
historical development and interpretation and specifically
conflicts with the pertinent part of the definitional sections
of the Act under section 70a(5) and under section 6 of
exemptions.

Furthermore, the petitioner's argument misinter­

prets, I believe, the concept of a fresh start and the
rationale of the petitioner’s position would impose substantial
confusion and uncertainty in the bankruptcy law.
First, the scheme of the bankruptcy law generally is

15
in two parts, first, marshaling

the assets at the time of the

filing of the petition, all of the property of the bankrupt
with certain exceptions which is nonexempt

vest

by operation

of law in the trustee.
The second part of that scheme is section 6, the
exemption part, which provides specifically that local conditions
shall govern local statutes which assets which may be maintained
by the particular bankrupt in order to assure that he can
survive and so that he can have at least those basic
essential requirements in which he can then cause to begin
his new life.
The concept of a fresh start incorporates both those
ideas of assets to the trustee and exemptions to the bankrupt
and also and most importantly, the idea provided by section 17
of a discharge, an effective,valuable discharge, to the
bankrupt so that he can begin his new economic life free of
the burden of his pre-existing debt.
So that the three elements, I suggest, for a fresh
start are, one, the proper discharge; two, specified assets or
items of value which provide a base and an opportunity to
start anew provided by exemption; and, three, the opportunity
and the safeguard that future earnings and after-acquired
property can be used, retained, and accumulated by the bankrupt
in his new economic effort.
The petitioner twists and distorts the traditional

16
concept of fresh start into the overriding proposition that
the bankruptcy law must provide, it seems to me, a protected
fund sufficient to meet the needs of the bankrupt.

The

primary support suggested by the petitioner in his argument
and in his brief is the case of Lines v. Frederick decided in
1970«,

There in essence the question was presented whether

credits accrue or pay accrue during pre-bankruptcy work for
vacation and layoff time periods to come about in the future
after the date of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy
were property within the meaning of the Act.
This Court determined that whatever characteristics
of property for other purposes that those credits or accrued
pay might have or possess, they are overshadowed in comparison
to their similarity to future earnings and the purposes of
the Act as embodied in the term "fresh start."

The similarities

Of the accruals to future wages were, one, the fact that the
accrued credits or pay were not payable or collectible on
demand by the petitioner at the time of the filing of the
petition at all but would ordinarily be payable at the ’future
event — vacation or layoff.

In fact, the accrued pay or

credits were designed and specifically tied to one or the
other of those two events as a substitute payment for future
period of time which but for vacation or layoff would be
working time in which the bankrupt would receive the very
weekly earnings which would be cause to sustain him.

17
The only relation back at all of the accrued credits
or the vacation pay to the pre-bankruptcy past was that the
prior regular working period was the basis for accumulating
the accrual on a percentage formula as to hours or days and
its equivalent in money.

I believe it was one hour per month

or one hour per week.
It is readily apparent that here the facts are
entirely different from those crucial determinations there
v/hich made accrued vacation pay look like and be treated the
same as future wages which indeed are protected and should be
protected both by the discharge and by the concept of
fresh start.
One, the tax refund claimed here is fixed and
certain as to amount, determinant, demandable, and collectible.
Two, there is no design, no specification or intent
to relate or identify the accumulation of periodic payments
required as withholdings for expected tax liability and
which constitutes the reason for the refund claim to any
period of future working time or as a substitute for regular
earnings as sustenance to the wage-earner, in the event of
future lost time for layoff, vacation leave, sick leave, or
any other reason.

The tax refund claim is simply not the

equivalent to future wages or substitute for future wages
during the suspended working period in the future.
Lastly, it seems to me that all the characteristics

18
of the tax refund claim relate back to the prebankrupfccy past
during the very accumulation of debt which resulted in the
filing of petition of bankruptcy.
In this regard, I think it is speculation to suggest
that perhaps the Eighth and Ninth Circuits have suggested in
the cases of In re Gehrig and In re Cedor that the wage-earner
would not have used the amounts periodically withheld for the
payment of debt». Certainly they are small amounts and they
would not have made a tremendous impact on the debts at the time
if received.

But it is certain and probable that they would

have been spent and they would have been spent either to reduce
in part the debt or to prevent the further accumulation of
debts for expenses incurred at the time, and thus it.seems
to me that they relate to the very part of the period Which
created the debt and necessitated bankruptcy.
The further argument is made by the Ninth Circuit’s
adaption of the district court opinion in an effort to bring
the tax refund closer within the Lines v. Frederick case
that the amount of a tax refund may generally be said to be
an amount that by reason of past experience is anticipated by
the wage-earner as an annual event, i.e., either vacation pay
and the potential layoff, and that to deprive the wage-earner
of that planned-on annual recurring payment cannot be said to
be less severe than the deprivation of two weeks’ paid
vacation.

19

It seems to me that that statement,» that type of
analogy, not only being somewhat illogical, is a further
distinction between a tax refund claim and accrued vacation
pay or credit, because in the ordinary course of events and
if the taxpayer follows the withholding guidelines properly,
although vacation pay is indeed paid and received in the
future by a wage-earner as an annual event, the minimum payment
of income on taxes withheld periodically during the year and
accumulated over the course of a year is not calculated nor
anticipated to be repaid as an annual event to the taxpayer.
Rather it is intended, designed, and anticipated to be paid
and retained by the Government as the wage-earner4s income
tax on those earnings.
It seems to me that cut to its essence, the
petitioner's argument is that because the tax refund cl'-r"has its origins in withheld payments from wages, the refund
is wages, and because the debtor has not collected the refund
at the time of the filing of the petition, although he had a
right to do so, it is somehow future wages.
The petitioner4 s argument amounts to ignoring the
definition of property in section 70a(5), ignoring the defini­
tion and design of exemptions, I think ignoring the traditional
concept of "fresh start" and the entire fabric of the Bankruptcy
Act in adopting a new and controlling rationale for inclusion
or exclusion of items of value in the debtor’s estate and to

20
base that decision entirely in a wage-earner?s case on a
determination of the amount of a fund free of creditors and
necessary or sufficient to meet the bankrupt's needs.
I don’t think that this rationale has any place in
this Court's decision on the existing and statutory case law.
If there is to be such a change and such a drastic one, then
certainly the legislature and the Congress should mandate it.
And in fact the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United
States has reported to the Congress as of July 30 of 1973
proposing substantial revisions in the bankruptcy law and
proposing that as to this particular issue under a provision
with regard to exemptions that income tax refunds,accrued
vacation pay, receivables, cash, and securities be considered
to be exempt in the aggregate of not more than $500.

But the

standard proposed by the petitioner is unsound and its
application would result, it seems to me, in severe discrimina­
tion between bankrupts.

One bankrupt may indeed need $75 for

medical treatment, a second $500 for his wife’s operation,
and a third $2,000 for the tuition for his children5s education
All certainly are legitimate and valid needs.

But in no

sense can it be said that such a standard would achieve the
purposes of the Act nor that the tax refund claim in varying
amounts, which in some instances may amount to in excess of
a thousand dollars, would serve these varying purposes or needs
There is a suggestion in the brief that because the

21

amount of the tax refund in this case is small and because
administration costs and expenses are significant in some
instances, that very little of this amount of money will
trickle down to the creditors and therefore wouldn't it be
better to give it to the needy bankrupt?
The answer to that, I think, comes in different
ways.

One, administration costs and expenses are not

necessarily evil.

They are in the Act and they are in fact

under section 64 given first priority with regard to payments
from the assets accumulated.
Secondly, there is no support in the record in this
case that the $250.90 would be exhausted by administrative
costs and expenses, and in other cases where the refund may
be substantially greater, there is no suggestion that such
administrative costs and expenses would even substantially
eat into the asset.
QUESTION:

Of course, if one were to follow that

argument, I suppose you might just as well give up the idea
of having any kind of a bankrupt turn over any property.
MR. CIVILETTX:

If you were to follow the argument

of the petitioner?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CIVILETTX:

I think that's correct, especially

in the wage-earner' s case, because it seams to rne that in
one route or another one either direct or indirect all the

22

property or all assets are derived from his only source, which
is wages.
QUESTION:

And there is very seldom anything left

for distribution to creditors in a large majority of those
cases.
MR. CIVILETTI:

That*s true.

I think the Brookings

study showed in 70 percent of the cases there were ho asset
cases at all.
Third, if as the petitioner points out on page 16 of
his brief, a survey indicates that the average dividend to
unsecured creditors is only 7 percent, then that alone does
not seem to me justification to further reduce the percentage
on one of the basic designs of the Act, to return money to the
creditors, from 7 percent to closer to zero.
Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, and I thinic
it occurs in varying degrees in varying districts and
jurisdictions, abandonment is available where appropriate in
such small asset cases.

I think the California cases suggest

that some of the referees there in the district courts there
have adopted the policy of if the refund claim is the only
asset and it's less than $150, that they will treat it as
an abandonment as a no-asset case, no trustee will be appointed,
and the $10 will be even saved in the cost to the bankrupt.
QUESTION:
practice or policy.

....district, a matter principally of

23

MR. CIVILETTI:

Yes, indeed, it does, at least that

is my understanding from review of the cases and the record.
QUESTION:

Does the law purport to give a trustee

that kind of discretion?
MR. CIVILETTI:

It purports to, yes.

Whether or not

it's a proper exercise of discretion or it's abused in those
instances where, for instance, the amount of the tax refund
claim might be seven hundred dollars or eight hundred or
fifteen hundred dollars — I believe in the Gedor case, the
amount was about $660.
QUESTION:

But the statute does give the trustee

the discretion to abandon?
MR. CIVILETTI:

The trustee has the discretion to

abandon if authorised by the referee.

The referee would have

to authorise the abandonment, and the trustee, I do not
believe, could do so without that authorization.
QUESTION:

But the trustee didn't abandon the $660

in the Cedor case, did he?
MR. CIVILETTI;
QUESTION:

No.

Does the nevz proposed code alter that in

any way?
MR. CIVILETTI:

The abandonment provision?

I do not

know, your Honor.
QUESTION:

in
I thought that/many no-asset cases, no

trustees were appointed at all.

24
MR. CIVILETTI::
QUESTIONS

That’s true.

And the referee himself determines the

x.t'

‘

no~asset case,

and trustees are not appointed.

Once trustees

are appointed, you do have a problem then in marshaling
assets.

Then there must be a decision about abandonment.
MR. CIVILETTI:

Justice White,.

There are two decisions, 'Mr.

One is if the referee finds that there is only,

for instance, a tax refund which looks to be $150, he can at
that point determine that that asset should be abandoned,
the referee, and not appoint a trustee and treat it as a
no-asset case.
The second situation is where the same, let us take
the same $150 tax refund claim and perhaps some uncertainty
as to other assets and then a trustee is appointed.

Then

a second decision, it would seem to me, would have to be mcdc
by the trustee initially as to whether to pursue the tax
refund claim if he determine there were no other further
assets and then have the authorization received for such
abandonment by or from the referee.
QUESTION:
V; ..

What did the Court of Appeals suggest

„

to the district courts here —
MR. CIVILETTI:
case?

In the Second Circuit case, in our

It suggested that if the need of the bankrupt were

great enough that a deprivation of the amount of the tax.
refund claim, $150, $200, $300, would amount to a substantial

25
inequity, a severe hardship or harshness, then it could
reasonably conclude that an abandonment was proper.
QUESTION:

But how about the situation where

administrative expenses would eat up any asset, including
a tax refund?

Didn't the court address itself to those

situations?
MR. CIVILETTI:

Yes.

That was another

reason, I believe, stated or expressed in a few sentences
why the court suggested that either the appointment of a
trustee was not necessary or if one had been appointed, then
a very quick determination that abandonment was proper.
QUESTION:

So in the Second Circuit I take it this

question about tax refunds will never arise unless there is
a possibility of a distribution to creditors after administra­
tive expenses would be paid.
•MR. CIVILETTI:

I am not certain of that, of

agreement with that statement.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

after lunch.
[Whereupon, at 12 noon, a luncheon recess was
taken.]

AFTERNOON SESSION

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Civiletti, you may

proceed.
RESUMED ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN R. CIVILETTI
ON BEHALF OF TIIE RESPONDENT
MR. CIVILETTI:
tiie Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Mr. Justice White, I misspoke myself in answer

to a question that you addressed to me prior to the noon
recess with regard to abandonment and the Second Circuit’s
opinion and direction to the lower courts and to Kokoszka.
There they restricted the application of abandonment to the
situation wherein the assets available to the trustee would
be entirely consumed by the trustee's fee and other
administrative expenses

and there was no creditor who showed

other available assets which could be reached.

And Judge

Webster in the dissent in Gehrig took the same positions.
QUESTION:

Any time predicted administrative

expenses eat up the assets, including any tax refund, there
won't be any trustee appointed at all?
MR. CIVILETTI:

I would think that is a fair

conclusion.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CIVILETTI:

Mv argument has proceeded along the

lines that there is no legitimate distinction between the

27

principles applicable to this case and those of past cases
concerning property — Segal v. Rochelle and the antecedent
cases, Legg v. St. John, and in mind the concept of "fresh
start", Local Loan v. Hunt»
The Segal case I suggest was a more difficult case
than the one presented here because the petitioner filed for
bankruptcy before the end of the tax year, and thus any
refund was not demandable nor collectible immediately, nor
at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, nor
was the amount thereof fixed nor truly determinable with
exact certainty.

Furthermore, the carryback tax loss resulted

in a tax refund which the trustee was found entitled to
receive even though the tax was paid.

It had been paid from

the individual earnings of the bankrupt taxpayers.

There was

no suggestion in that case in the opinion in that case by
this Court that the amounts in Segal respectively of $283
and $1600 for Gerald Segal in the carryback years of 1960
and 1959 and like amounts for Sam Segal could not have been
well used by them in obtaining the necessary fresh start in
their new economic life.

The Court took, I suggest, paixis

to emphasize the loss carryback claim there was sufficiently
rooted in the prebankruptcy past and so little entangled with
the bankrupt’s ability to make an unencumbered fresh start,
that it should be regarded as property under section 70a(5)
despite the substantial differences which I suggest make this

23

case considerably easier in determination of the question of
property.
The tax refund claim is fixed and certain as to
amount, demandable and collectible at the time of the filing
of the petition, and I suggest has no relationship to future
wages nor after-acquired property, both of which elements were
certainly controlling in the Lines case and had some effect
in the Segal case.
A decision upholding the Second Circuit and the
trustee would not only be consistent with Lines v, Frederick
but would further serve to confirm the plain meaning and intent
of the principles recognized so clearly in the case»

Future

wages and after-acquired property are necessary essential
elements of the concept of a fresh start.

There is no

legitimate distinction, I suggest, between a tax refund claim
and any other monies or funds obtained by payroll withholding
' v

from past wages pursuant to a savings plan, a Christmas club,
a bond-a-month plan, a retail layaway plan, an educational
loan repayment plan

or agreement, union dues, auto insurance,

auto insurance, real estate tax, or any other established
payroll deduction which could result in a refund or repayment
from a second or third source.
QUESTION;

I suppose petitioner's argument is that

most of the thingsyou mention are voluntarily undertaken by
the wage-earner, whereas the income tax withholding is not

29

voluntary.
MR. CIVILETTIs

Well, the term "voluntary'', I think

that is true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

I think that they

•would argue that that is a distinction.

I suggest that,

number one, the meaning.of "voluntary" varies depending on
its application and that pursuant to a loan agreement, for
instance, once the decision is made, then that payment or
deduction from payroll might well no longer be considered
to be voluntary.
Similarly, here, as Mr. Justice Rlackmim pointed out,
the voluntariness to some extent is available to the taxpayer
in the manner in which he prescribes his withholding, and it
is adjustable during the course of the year depending on
changes in circumstances by him.
Turning to the Consumer Credit Protection Act, my
argument there is a very short and brief one.

It is not

applicable because the tax refund claim here does not come
within the definitional term of earnings in that Act; it is
not compensation paid or payable for past services; it does
not come within the definition of the term "disposable earnings'
because it is not that part of earnings remaining after
deductions allowed by law; and lastly, it is not within the
definition•of garnishment, which in the language of the
statute means any legal or equitable procedure through which
the earnings of any individual are required to be withheld

30
for the payment of any debt.
Here, if this is property, then it vests in the
trustee by operation of law, and it is not required to be
withheld for the payment of any debt pursuant, for instance,
to provisions of seizure or collection under section 70c of
the Bankruptcy Act.
The reference in the Consumer Credit Protection Act,
specific reference in that Act to Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy
Act and saying that the provisions of the Consumer Credit
Protection Act do not apply to Chapter 13'arrangements was
made because Chapter 13 arrangements do apply to future wages,
do specifically provide for deductions for the payment to
creditors for past debts pursuant to the plan approved by the
referee and therefore it was necessary in order to make clear
that the 25 percent limitation would not apply to such
arrangements that Chapter 13 should be specifically referred
to in the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Civiletti.

Mr.. Adams, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. ADAMS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ADAMS:
the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I would like to take a few moments to discuss

some brief items in rebuttal.

31
First, I want to object to a characterization of the
bankrupt’s position in this case that we are arguing that any­
time the bankrupt has some sort of needs, that the Bankruptcy
Act ought to let him keep some property or that we are arguing
that all property derived from wages is somehow not property
within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act.
Now, it’s true that there is some material in our
brief on the needs of the bankrupt here, but that material is
there to emphasize an important point, and as this Court
found in Lines

v. Frederick, wages are a special kind of

asset in our system.

The material on Mr. Kokoszka’s situation

and the material on his needs are there to show the importance
of wages —
QUESTION:

What if the bankrupt has owing to him

six months of unpaid wages?

Say his employer is in financial

trouble and he just hasn’t paid him.

And then the employee

goes into bankruptcy because he can’t pay his bills either.
Now, the wages owing him are property that pass to the
trustee, I take it.
MR. ADAMS:

Well, that’s a similar example as was

dealt with by the Sixth Circuit in the Aveni case.
QUESTION:

The Federal lavz doesn’t particularly

make the wages an exempt item.
MR. ADAMS;

I think the Federal law as far as the

exemption statute is concerned, the Federal law protects wages

32

whether they are paid or yet payable.

So if the wages held

by the employer have already been paid, they would be exempt.
If the employer was holding an account of wages due so that
the wages were payable —
QUESTION: But' they are not excluded because they
are not property.
MR. ADAMS:
point.

Well, excuse me.

I was getting to that

I thought you had moved on to the exemption statute.
QUESTION:

Well, they are arguing to be“prox>erty

they wouldn't be exempt, we vrouldn't have to exempt them, 1
suppose.
MR. ADAMS:

Well, conceptually that's true.

I think

the problem — I would argue, Mr. Justice White - that they
would not be property under the Bankruptcy Act.
QUESTION:

I know you do.

MR. ADAMS:
apply.

And I think that the same reasons would

it was an involuntarily created asset? it's derived

entirely from wages? and it's received entirely at the post
bankruptcy event.

In many ways ■—

QUESTION:

Your proposition is, ir. my example I
r

gave you, if a bankrupt has six months of back wages due him
from his employer, he may collect them from his employer and
not turn them over to the trustee.
MR. ADAMS:
QUESTION:

I would like to point ■—
Is that really your proposition?

33

MR. ADAMS:

I would like to say it wasn't my

proposition because it's a very hard example.

But I would

say that —
QUESTION:

You really can’t find anything in the

Bankruptcy Act that would let him keep six months worth of
back wages, can you?
MR. ADAMS:

What I would say to that point is that

the bankrupt in that situation — I would be interested in
the examination of additional facts.

I think you can see

that that is in a very exceptional circumstance.
QUESTION:
MR. ADAMS:
QUESTION:
MR. ADAMS:

I don’t know.
Under straight analysis —
Would that be so uncommon?
I think, in ray experience as a baiucrupcc.*

attorney, I have never seen that.
QUESTION:

But 1 assume that —

My example is not the situation in Lines.

At least in Lines the amount that was involved there on its
face was to sustain a person for a future period.
MR. ADAMS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
Not so in my example, when the wages

were payable at the time. And not so apparently in the case
we have before us, because the withheld wages weren't to
sustain him at all.

They were to be taken away from him and

paid to the Government.
MR. ADAMS:

I think the only real difference between

34
your case, Mr. Justice White, and the case at bar is that you
have just given me an example where there is potentially a very
large amount of money involved, whereas typically we have a
very small amount of money involved in a tax refund case.
I don't think that —
QUESTION:

The only thing, if State law might

exempt wages up to a certain amount.

*

So the exemption section

might make ’some of those wages exempt in part or in whole.
But it wouldn't be because they aren't property.
MR. ADAMS:

Well, let me get to my point, Mr.

Justice White, and that is I think that the situation in the
example that you have given is one where we have

you are

talking about a fund of wages which would have never been
available in a practical sense for the creditors if they had
been paid to the -QUESTION:

He would have paid his bills with them.

And this is what has driven him into bankruptcy, he hasn't
been able to get his wages.
MR. ADAMS:

The wages — I want to speak in terms

of a practical matter here.

Wages are 75 percent exempt at

least according to the Federal statute.

In order for the

creditors to obtain those wages, there are a number of State
law procedural safeguards as well as several constitutional
safeguards.
Now, this fund has been created which has only

35
increased the incredible hardship on the bankrupt.

1 think

although what we are talking about in your case is a substantial
fund of money, from the point of view of the bankrupt, it was
also a substantial loss, a deprivation of wages which he needed
for his support in the past.
QUESTION:

And it throws him into bankruptcy.

MR. ADAMS:

Threw him into bankruptcy.

QUESTION:

...

the administration

of a nationwide Bankruptcy Act can’t depend on whether or not
a particular asset that is claimed to be property is or is
not "substantial."

Then we would just have an endless line

of cases through the Federal courts saying $150 wasn’t
substantial, $600 was.
MR. ADAMS:
with that point.

Mr. Justice Hehnguist, I agree entirely

I was stating that although 1 felt the

only distinction between our case and Mr. Justice White's
example was the size, I don’t think that is a valid way to
distinguish assets within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act,
although I would note that if the Court is concerned about the
line-drawing problem in this case, which is really only
presented in my view by exceptional circumstances, another
alternative is to apply the Federal wage exemption statute
to the tax refund check which clearly does draw lines established
by Congress.
I would like to go on and discuss the problem of

36
abandonment.

The Second Circuit suggested that abandonment,

was an alternative.

I don't think in the first place it's a

practical alternative.

At the time of the filing of the

t

schedules, the referee is not going to know, especially if the
tax refund check hasn't been received yet or a return hasn’t
even been filed, whether or not there are going to be any
assets in the estate.

Once he appoints a trustee, he is going

to feel that he is going to have to pay that trustee whether
or not any of the assets are going to pass on to the creditors.
Secondly, it's going to result in a nonuniform
application of the bankruptcy laws.

The material in our brief,

the Stanley & Girth material supports that.
Thirdly, as just a practical matter, abandonne-.c
never used or used very rarely in the administration o .
bankruptcy courts.

That is supported also by the

Stanley & Girth survey.

Since the Kokoszka opinion, we have

done a survey of our own which I can submit to the Court with
its permission in the form of an affidavit from one of the
attorneys in this case demonstrating that in the Second Circuit
since the Kokoszka opinion, there haven’t been any abandonments
pursuant to that opinion,
QUESTION:

How about in no-asset cases just not

appointing trustees?
MR. ADAMS:

Although that’s an alternative that is

recognized by the — it’s never done.

It’s never done.

37

QUESTION:

You mean appointment — in every case

trustees are appointed?
MR. ADAMS:

Except in very rare cases, the reason

being that the referees don't know whether or not to believe
the material on the schedules or not and they want to appoint
someone to look into it.
QUESTION:

You mean referees don't know whether to

believe it so they appoint a trustee.
MR. ADAMS:

Right, to look into the situation.

And

once they do, then you are caught up in the circle again.
QUESTION:

In the district of Arizona we have just

had all sorts of no-asset wage-earner cases where there
really wasn't any doubt about the fact there were no assets.
QUESTION:

The same was true of Colorado.

QUESTION:

I will say according to the material in

the briefs this is done quite routinely in California..
MR. ADAMS:

No.

in virtually every case.

A trustee is appointed in California
Similarly in Connecticut where Mr.

Kokoszka comes from.
QUESTION:

But then in California, the abandonment

is utilized apparently on tax refund claims below a certain
dollar figure.
MR. ADAMS:

There the

court rule as to $150 tax

refund checks was established in some districts in Southern,
California.

33
QUESTION:

Right.

So it isn't apparently wholly

unworkable or impractical.
MR. ADAMS:

Well, 1 don't know, Mr. Justice Stewart,

as to whether or not fees and

on had to corae from sone other

area in the application of that rule.

But I know that as a

practical matter, the referees feel that they can't believe
the bankrupt necessarily and they want to appoint a trustee
to see if th^re were other assets they need to count.

That

sort of thing.
•V

Finally, I would just like to say that as to the
Gehrig court's analysis of the CCPA issue, they were dealing
only with an analysis of the voluntary aspect of the tax refund
check that had been created due to overwithholding.
QUESTION:

Mr. /«Jams, I doubt that the supplemental

material that you suggested would be helpful to us.

We think

the record is adequate as it is now before us.
MR. ADAMS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Civiletti, you

appeared in this case at the request of the Court and invitation
of the Court to file a brief amicus after we encountered a
different kind of abandonment on the part of the trustee, and
on behalf of the Court I thank you for your assistance to us
in this matter.
MR. ClVILETTIs

I welcomed the privilege.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The case is submitted

39

gentlemen.
[Whereupon

,

at Is 18 p.nu, the oral argument in

the above-entitled case was concluded.]
