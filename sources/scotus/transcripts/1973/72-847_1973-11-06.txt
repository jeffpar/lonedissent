Mrs. Schroeder, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MARY M. SCHROEDER
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. SCHROEDER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, this case is before you on appeal from the Supreme
Court of Arizona.

The issue before you is the constitutional­

ity of an Arizona statute that denies medical care at public
expense to residente who have not been residents a year.

This

Court presumably has taken jurisdiction of this case because
tli© decision of the Arizona Suprema Court in upholding the
constitutionality of that requirement was in direct conflict
with the three-judge district court sitting in Arizona which
invalidated the identical provision as a denial of equal
protection and infringement on the right to travel.
The decision of the court below is in almost as
direct conflict with a determination of this Court in affirm­
ing a district court decision in Arizona which invalidated
a similar durational residence requirement for mental health
care in Arizona.
The case arises her© because in 1971 a man named
Henry Evaro moved from the State of Hew Mexico to the State

3

of Arizona, intending to make Arizona his horae and his
residence.

About six weeks after he moved to Arizona, he

became very seriously ill with an acute respiratory illness.
He was gasping for breath.

It has been stipulated below he

clearly required medical attention to restore his health.
He went to his private doctor.

His private doctor

told him he needed, hospitalization and referred him to a
private hospital, Memorial Hospital, the appellant here,
'/Then he want to Memorial Hospital, the hospital determined
■that hs was indigent and asked under the appropriate procedures
that the county hospital either take Mr, Evaro as a patient,
give him treatment there, or that the county reimburse
Memorial Hospital for the costs which it would expend in giving
Mr, Evaro treatment.
The county refused.

In doing so it acted in

accordance with this statute, which says that unless there is
an emergency, and I will discuss that exception in a few
moments, if it please the Court,
emergency case
of that statute.

Mr, Evaro was clearly not an

even though he needed care within the meaning
The county said that in accordance with this

statute it could not give him care because he had not been a
resident for a year.
QUESTIONS

Is Memorial — I know it is nonprofit.

Is it a private hospital?
MRS. SCHRQEDER;

Yes, it is, your Honor.

.And I am

here represeating Mr. Evaro and that hospital because the
private hospitals in Arizona have a very real concern in the
enforcement of this statuta.
QUESTION s

And the other case involved Maricopa

County Hospital, did it?
MRS. SCHROEDERs
QUESTION?

Yes.

And that's a public hospital.

MRS. SCHROEDERs

That is the county hospital operated

at public expanse, yes, your Honor.
QUESTIONS

I suppose what you are saying there is

that if the county can’t take this indigent patient on, then
the private not-for-profit hospital has to because he is not
going to be denied health care.
MRS; SCHROEDERs

That's true.

Out of decency the

private hospitals will take on as many patients, as they can.
They can't handle it all, but they take on what -they can.
And when they do, the costs have to b© born© somewhere and
they are passed on to paying patients at a time whan it is
particularly difficult for them to pay these costs, as well,
QUESTIONS

This is a county measure, is it not?

Suppose Mr. Evaro had corns into Maricopa County from the
adjoining county and this happened, would he be eligible to
go to the county hospital facility back in ‘the other county?
And if not, why not?
MRS. SCHROEDERs

No, your Honor, this is a State

5
statuta which imposes a county residence requirement.
QUESTION:

He has to be a resident.

MRS« SCHROEDER:

He has to be a resident of the county.

So that it bars those like Mr. Evaro who travel from one Stata
to another as well as those who move within the State of
Arizona.
The statute itself was passed in the 1930's at a time
when the legislature was very much concerned about the tremen­
dous movement of people in the United States and particularly
coming into Arizona.
QUESTION:

May I ask just one question.

MRS. SCHROEDER:
QUESTION;

Yes.

If in fact he had been taken in, the

expanse of his care would not have been borne by the county,
would it?
MRS. SCHROEDER:

Your Honor, the statute does provide

that if the county is unable to provide care at the county
hospital, that it can reimburse private hospitals provided
that they meet the residence requirement.
When this statute was passed, there was concern.
Wa have appended to our brief the legislative history showing
that these durational residence requirements were passed at
a time when there was a great deal of movement throughout th©
country, particularly into Arizona.
QUESTION:

The purposes of this case, let me see

6
if I get it clear.

The purposes of your basic issue, it doesn't

make any difference, or does it make any difference, whether
he was in a private hospital or in the county hospital?
MRS. SCHROEDER;

Well, lie couldn't have been

accepted at the county hospital because he wasn't eligible
for* treatment at county —
QUESTION2

But when th© private hospital gets into
as
the picture, it is only/a surrogate for th© county on your
theory, is it not, though?
MRS. SCHROEDERs

Well, what happened here, Mr,

Chief Justice, is that because he did not
requirement, th© private hospital

meet the residence

which cared for him was

not entitled to reimbursement by th® county.
QUESTIONS

And he first applied to get into a county

hospital?
MRS. SCHROEDER:
hospital.

No, ha was referred to the privat®

But if he had gone to the county hospital, the

county hospital would have told him that unless you can pay
your bill, we can't treat you here, and he would have had t©
go elsewhere.
QUESTION:

All you ar© trying to show is that it is

just as if he had applied to th© county hospital and been
turned down.
MRS. SCHROEDER:

Yes, except that it happened he

went to a private hospital which did giv® him treatment at

7
considerable expense.
QUESTIONS

All the question that is addressed,

obviously, is the question of State action.
MRS. SGIROEDER:

Well, your Honor, I don’t think

there can be a serious question here with the statute imposing
this requirement and enforced in this manner.

The statute

was, of course, passed when the State was concerned about people
coming in.

It was passed at the same time that durational

residence requirements for public assistance cash welfare
benefits were passed.

It was in the same period that California

enacted its absolute bar to indigents in the State that was
struck down a generation ago by this Court in Edwards v„
California.
QUESTION;

But for the residence requirement, the

hospital would have been reimbursed by the county for the
services given,
MRS. SCHROEDERs

That is correct, your Honor, yes.

The sole issue throughout this case has bean the constitutionality
of that residence restriction,
QUESTION;

And in doing that, it would be acting,

in effect, as an agent or a surrogate to the State is your
theory.
MRS. SGIROEDER;

Yes,

Certainly.

.And that is so

provided expressly in the statute.
When these durational residence requirements ware

8

enacted, there was, of course, great concern and those back
©van in the 'thirties

realised that this was a direct

had a penalizing effect on people who were moving«
In the 1930's when Congress first faced this
question with respect to public assistance benefits under the
Social Security Act, it provided that durational residence
requirements in that area tinder federally funded programs
could not exceed a year.
By the time that Congress faced the question of
medical care and funding State programs for medical care, the
earliest being -the Kerr-Mills Act in 1960, Congress expressly
declared that no State program under congressional aegis could
bs accepted if it had any durational residence requirements
whatsoever for medical care.
Wow, 1st ma point out that that statute doesn't
control the action of Arizona her® because Arizona is not
participating in those programs and the money here is not under
those programs.

But w© do have a square declaration by

congress that these durational requirements for medical car©
are not sound public policy, and telling those States who d©
participate in Federal programs that they cannot have them.
This Court first considered, of course, the question
of durational residence in the welfare field in the Shapiro v.
Thompson case which was decided in 1969.

And the Court there

held that to the extent that States may enact durational

9
residence requirements in this field for the purpose of keeping
people out, penalising them once they got there,, and encouraging
a
them to leave, that that was simply not/permissible purpose
for legislation,

And it held that absent a compelling State

interest, these durational requirements cannot stand.
Now, the Shapiro case, of course, dealt with
subsistence cash welfare payments.

This is medical care.

We

think that if there is any distinction between the two, it is
that there is even less justification for having these
requirements for medical care than to have them in cash
assistance.
QUESTION;

There is also the difference that Shapiro

dealt with travel between States.

This is travel within a

State between counties, isn't it?
HRS. SCHROEDER;

Well, the restriction here is

broader than the restriction in Shaprio because it hits at
both travel within States and travel from one State to another.
This particular case is purely interstate travel.
QUESTION s

Intrastate.

MRS. SCHROEDER;
QUESTION;

Interstate.

Oh, this is interstate.

MRS. SCHROEDER;

Yes, because the appellant here

moved from New Mexico t© Arisona.
QUESTION;

I guess you said that earlier,

MRS. SCHROEDER;

Now, I think the fundamental

10

importance of medical care can b© seen in the fact that while
Congress is willing to tolerate a year residence requirement
in the area ©f cash assistance, it required that they could
not stand in the area of medical care.

And sine© this Court’s

decision in Shapiro» as you can see from a little chart which
we have appended to our brief in asking States what they are
doing now with residence requirements in the medical field,
there ars 45 States ar® not enforcing these requirements at
all.

Thor© are only a handful of States that ar© still

enforcing them.

And the reason for it is clear, both from the

decision of this Court in Shaprio and as a simple policy
matter that where you say that welfare benefits, cash payments,
have to be made to people regardless of the length of time
that they have lived in a State, you cannot at the same time,
unless there is seme compelling justification that is not here,
say that, the State can withhold medical car® which may be
necessary to get the people off the relief roles and into
functioning members of the society.
QUESTIONS

Mrs. Schroedar, could Maricopa County

impose a simple- residence or domicil® requirement so as t©
exclude a transient from coming into Maricopa County Hospital
and getting non-emergency medical car©, say, for a pre-existing
hernia?
MSS. SCHROEDERs
QUESTIONS

Your Honor, that is not this case.

I realize that.

11
MRS i SCHROEDERs

tod the similar distinction in

classification among residents based on the time they have
been there would not be present.

So far there has been —

I can only say that that would be the next case.

Certainly

it is not required by the decisions of this Court.
QUESTION:

Under your theory of the lav;, on v;hich

side would that fall?
MRS0 SCHROEDERs

Well, our position is that you

cannot distinguish as between residents based on the length
of time that they have resided.

We do not go so far as to

say that — and there may certainly be other considerations
when dealing with transients who have a place of residence to
which they can turn to for care,
QUESTIONS

Hew do you distinguish Starns v. Malkerson,

that Minnesota resident tuition case?
MRS. SCHROEDERs

Well, your Honor, that case — and

there have bean several others that have determined that in
the area of tuition for higher education, that we are dealing
a
with/fundamentally different thing, a luxury perhaps it might
be called, but certainly not some,thing that is so essential to
human existence as medical care or the kind of assistance
payments involved in Shapri©.

There may also be in the tuition

and other areas to which Shaprio has been applied, there may
a
be different considerations justifying the reason for/residence
requirement, administrative concerns, other things which are

12
not here which certainly were not present in Shaprio„
QUESTIONS
arena?

Could wa translate that into the medical

Suppose Arizona authorised its county hospitals to

charge X dollars to a nonresident and X-Y dollars t© a resident.,
in other words, a discount to a resident.

On your theory would

this be all right?
MRS„ SCKROEDER:

That form of discrimination between

rasidrincs based solely on the fact that they hav® just moved
would be discriminatory and there would have to be a compelling
reason for having it.
QUESTIONi

Of course, in Sfc&rns they required a

one-year residency requirement before you get resident,
tuition in Minnesota.

I think in Blandis

last year a majority

of the Court approved that.
MRS, SCHRGEDER;

Pardon roe.

Approved the imposition

of the requirement?
QUESTIONS

Yes.

MRS. SCHROEDERs

Certainly wa recognize this Court

has affirmed Starns, but let me, if I may, simply quote to you
from what the Staros opinion itself says , which is that
in distinguishing the area of fundamental necessities, welfare,
medical care, from tuition, it says that Shapiro involved the
immediate and pressing need for preservation ©£ life ©nd
health of persons unable to live without public assistance.
It distinguished that situation from th© tuition situation.

13

And we do here — the fundamental point here is that we do
deal with something that is absolutely fundamental to human
existence,
QUESTION s
or an emphasis?

Do you think it was a matter of distinction

I coma back to my hypothetical, and all you

say is compelling interest,

I have never known quite what that

means, because I grope for a case where we have ever upheld
a statute in the face of a compelling interest, standard.
MRS. SCHROEDER:
difficult to think of one.
I believe in the Blandis

In this particular area it’s
The suggestion has been made, and
v. Kline opinion the Court is

concerned about possible administrative difficulties in
determining when a person is a resident for purposes of tuition
because there you have people automatically moving from one
family and taking up residence somewhere ©Isa.

That certainly

is not a problem that I find in the areas of welfare assistance.
May I say that to emphasise just how necessary this
kind of madical care is, let me turn for a moment to the
emergency exception that is urged her® to b® something which
somehow takes this out of the Shapiro orbit.

The fact is that

in the1 statute, emergency care is defined as that care which
is necessary for the preservation of life or limb.

That

means by definition that unless death is imminent ©r amputation
is necessary virtually, that car© will not b© provided.
In the context of this vary case ws have a situation

14
where somaor© obviously needed medical car® because he wasn't
able to breathe, but he wasn't going to stop breathing
altogether, so he was denied it.

In other situations, cancer,

diagnosed cancer patients have bean denied medical car®
because they did not meet the residence requirements, presumably
because although their disease unless treated at an early
stage would be fatal eventually, it wasn't going to b© fatal
right then.
There are situations of very serious bums and
disfigurement where care has been denied.
QUESTIONs

Are you saying that a carcinoma is

necessarily always an emergency case?
MRS. SCHROEDERs

No, I am saying within this statute,

it is not ail emergency and therefore cara is denied.
QUESTIONs

Then are you saying that carcinoma is

always a non-emergency case?
MRS. SCHROEDERs

No, I don’t know for what purpose

tills ©msrgancy exception was put in.

What th© statute says

is that if you are an emergency, even if you haven’t mat the
durational requirements, we will treat you.

Then we must look

to see what an emergency is.
QUESTION?

Normally that would be a medical

determination, would it not?
MRS. SCHROEDERs
it is

It is a medical determination, but

not always mad© by medical doctors.

That is one of the

15
problems here.

And it is because it is defined in this statute

as that treatment necessary for the preservation of life, as
it is applied in Arizona, it means that those suffering from
cancer are not considered emergencies and are therefor® denied
treatment until they meet the residence requirements.

If

that being that treatment is either delayed until it may be
too late and treatment is more costly or that the person is
made to suffer throughout the waiting period,.
QUESTION s

What was the statute in Vaughan?

MRS, SCHROEDER:

When was — I'm sorry,

QUESTION: Vlhat. was the statute in Vaughan?

We

affirmed here the validation ©f that statute by a three-judge
court.

That was a mental health statute.
MRS. SCHROEDER:

That was, yes, a mental health

statute.
QUESTION s

With a residence requirement?

MRS. SCHROEDER; Yes it was.

It ■

said that if the

patient had not been a resident for a year, 'then there would be
a transfer back to the State that the patient came from,
QUESTION:

We affirmed the holding of unconstitu­

tionality ,
MRS. SCHROEDER:

Yes, you affirmed the district

court decision,
QUESTION;
this ?

Do you feel that that's rather close to

16
MRS „ SCHROEDER;

I certainly do, y©s.

that at the beginning of ray argument,

I mentioned

I have heard that is

on© of the reasons this Court has agreed to hear this one,
because there is such a direct conflict,
QUESTION:

Did the three"judge court in this statute

rely on Vaughan?
MRS, SCHROEDER:

They went the other way around.

The three»judge court was first.

Vaughan was second.

The

only thing that really troubled Judge Craig in the mental
health case was that ha was troubled that perhaps mental health
wasn't quite as vital to human existence as —
QUESTION;

Was the court, in Valenciano and in

Vaughan the same court, same three judges?
MSS, SCHROEDER:
QUESTION:

No,

It was a single judge,

MRS. SCHROEDER:

It was a single judge in the mental

health case and he did not participate in the Valencianp case.
The Court has waived the question of interstate
versus intrastate travel.
QUESTION:

Th© Vaughan court was a three-judge court.

We affirmed on direct appeal,
QUESTION:

It had to have been a three-judge court.

It was a different court, though.
MRS. SCHROEDER:
Excuse me.

It was a different court, yes.

We have two three-judge court decisions.

I

17
apologize for it.
As w© have seen, we have here a statute which
affects people who move not only between States, but also
people who move from county to county.

The suggestion is mad©

that somehow that lessens the constitutional infirmities.
The fact is that here we have purely interstate travel.

We

have a restriction that is even more severe than the restriction
in the Shapiro case.
QUESTION:

If this were a county-to-county case, you

would still be here.
MRS. SCHROEDER:

Yes, we certainly would, and we point

out that in Dunn v. Blumsteln, the voting rights case, this
Court invalidated both a State residence requirement and a
local residence requirement for voting.
QUESTION:

And w© believe that —

Both of those could have read on impeding

interstate travel.
MRS. SCHROEDER:
QUESTION:

Yes.

The local residence requirement?
a
You have/local residence requirement.

And the State may not require anything, but you might have
to live in the county for a year.
MRS'. SCHROEDER:

.’hat's exactly what we have here.

It

doss affect interstate travel.
QUESTION:

I know, but — I understand that.

the case isn't an intrastate travel case'at all,
MRS. SCHROEDER:

No, it is not.

So

18
QUESTIOHs

Necessarily.

MRS, SCHBOEDER:

It, is not, but the Supreme Court of

Arizona in its opinion in upholding the statute somehow felt—
and I cannot give it to you in the most coherent terms because
I am not sure exactly what they were concerned about, but I
think they felt that somehow there was more justification
perhaps to hitting at travel between counties within the State
than ax interstate travel,

And we can only say that the

right to travel has to be a fundamental precept that applies
to anyone traveling in the United States, not only because he
happens to cross a State line, but as between counties within
the same State.
QUESTIONt

Are these funds the county’s funds?

HRS» SCHBOEDER:
QUESTION;

Yes, they are.

Hone of them are State funds,

MRS. SCHBOEDER;

I can't tell you, your Honor,

whether there ar© no state funds, but they are principally
raised by county revenue.
QUESTION;

Largs share ©f county funds.

I suppose

the state court was concerned with th© intercounty relation­
ships ,
MRS. SCHROEDERs
was, yes.

That may have been what the concern

But the effect of statute —
QUESTION:

Maricopa County has, what, about half the

population of the State?

IS
MRS. SCHROEDERs
QUESTIONS

Yes , that’s correct.

About a million people or more in Maricopa

County?
MRS. SCHROEDERs

Approximately a million and the

State has approximately two million total.

So that one of the

reasons presumably was that Maricopa County -- and they said
to this court in their papers to the court that they are
concerned about people coming not only from outside the State
but from other counties in Arizona to Maricopa County.
QUESTION?

How many counties in Arizona?

MRS. SCHROEDERs
QUESTIONS

Oh, ten, fourteen.

Fourteen.

Are there any that don’t have any

hospitals?
MRS. SCHROEDERs

Yes, there are,

I believe one.

county has no medical facilities.
What we have here is obviously a serious penalty on
those who travel.

It's on® which can b® justified in the opinions

of 'this Court only by a compelling interest.
QUESTION?

Mr. Schroeder, I take it from what you

just say that the State is not completely disabled from burden­
ing the right to travel, but it depends largely on what interest
it advances for doing so,
MRS. SCHROEDERs
QUESTIONS

Yes.

The nature of y'dur argument, then, is based

on travel rights stated in Shaprio and it isn’t an equal

20
protection claim.
MRS; SCHROEDERs

Well, I think the two have to be

read together-to a certain extent, because in Shapiro the Court
said that because the classification was such that it dis­
criminated against those who had only recently cone into the
State as opposed t© those who had been there longer, that that
kind of a classification could b© justified only on the basis
of a compelling interest.

I said that we meet the equal

protection point of what is their reason for making this
distinction.
And what the Court said in Shapiro was that to the
extent, 'that the justification is that we want to keep people
out or to encourage them to move one© they get here, that this
is not a permissible justification at all.
QUESTIONs

Suppose h© was not an indigent here?

Would you still b© hers?
MRS. SCHROEDERs
QUESTIONS

If w® had a non-indigent?

Non-indigent.

MRS. SCHROEDERs

You mean seeking medical care, I

presume.
QUESTION;

Does this statute preclude them from

taking a non-indigent?
MRS. SCHROEDERs

We are

her© because this statute

classifies indigent© into two categories, those who have been
in the State more than a year and those who have been in the

21
state less than a year.
QUESTION:

We would be here on a. different case.

Are there facilities available to non~

indigents at all?
QUESTION:

If somebody car» in from California and

wanted to go to Maricopa Hospital*
MRS* SCIIROEDER:
QUESTION:

The. county hospital?

Yes„

MRS„ SCHBOEDER:

I believe that there are facilities,

yes, if they would pay the cost of the care*
QUESTION:

And even if I hadn’t, been/a resident of

Arizona for a certain length of time, if I could pay, I could
get into the county hospital and pay for some special treatment
or something?
MRS. SCIIROEDER:

I believe that that is true.

You

may want to direct that question to the counsel for the county.
I believe that if you are willing to pay,the county makes
'these facilities available to those who live without the
State,

And J. believe that in the abortion decisions, I believe

that this Court c3.early held that a State couldn’t limit its
facilities only to residents of the State,
QUESTION:

I gather looking at the statute on its

face this applies, this residence requirement, applies only
to indigents, because —
MRS. SCIIROEDER: Yes, yes.
is only for indigents.

The residence requirement

It is a clear statement that for those

22
indi gents who have lived

for longer than a year, free car©

will be available, and for those who have not —
QUESTION:

My question is to the non-indigent.

You wouldn’t b© here.
MRS. SCHROEDER;

W© wouldn’t be her® in this case,

that’s true.
QUESTION?

Let’s see just how far this goes.

Suppose

a patient is diagnosed as having lung disease, tuberculosis
up in Toronto, Canada.

The doctor says what you need is a

warm climate, dry climate, dry .air, so Arizona is the place
for you to go.

So h® flies from Toronto down to Phoenix and

comes in under this statute.
MRS. SCHROEDER;

What about that?

Mr’. Chief Justice, the answer has

to be that if a person moves t© the State of Arizona, makes
that his residence, then he cannot be denied the care simply
because he only recently moved, regardless of whether h© was
motivated there for his health or whether he moved to visit
his family, or for whatever reason.
In this case we have to have a compelling interest
t© justify this classification.

We don’t have it*

W@ have

the county saying, first, that we need this statute in order
to heap people from flooding in.

This is precisely what the

Court held in Shaprlo was not a legitimate purpose at all.
QUESTION;

Mrs. Schroeder, I take it that perhaps

one might assume that th© man lived in Toronto, he was not a

23
citizen of the United Statas.
QUESTION?

Would that make any difference?

Or would it make a difference if he were

a resident of the state of Washington?
MRS. SCHROEDERs

As this statute is drawn, I believe

that it is not limited to people who coma from outside the
United States to the United States.
QUESTIONS

Would it make any difference to the man's

constitutional rights.

Your client came from New Mexico, so

clearly he has the right to travel.

Does that same right

extend to people who are not citizens, but simply com© from
Canada?
MRS. SCEROEDERs

No, that right wouldn't extend,

But so long ©s the county makes its facilities available to
residents who have moved from Canada there more than a year,
then it shouldn't deny them because they have been there less
than a year.
QUESTIONs

If Mr, — going back to my hypothetical,

if Mr. Evaro were a resident of a State outside Arizona, went
down there for a vacation, would you be here?
MRS, S CH ROE DER;
QUESTIONS

No.

You wouldn't at all?

You would say that

the State could draw the distinction between a resident and
a non-resident so far as its facilities ar© concerned?
MRS. SCHROEDER:

I don't have to answer that in this

case because we have a resident.

We do not assert that the

24
county must make all its facilities available to everyone
regardless of where they live, because in the situation of a
transient, as you posit it, someone coming from the State of
Washington to Arizona, he can go back to Washington and get
the care.

For someone who comes to Maricopa County, moves

there to live there, he has no place else where he can return
to.
QUESTIONS

Then your client is willing to take on

tli© out-of-State indigenfcs without complaint?
MRS. SCHROSDER:
the indigents.
this case,

Well, there are problems in treating

We recognize it.

But we are not ther® yet in

W© are not at this point raising that case.

Arid

the opinions of this Court have not indicated that these
welfare assistance programs must be available to everyone
regardless of their residence.
QUESTIONS

Doesn't that also impinge upon the right

to travel?
MRS. SCHROEDERs

Yes, it doss, and we recognize and

we have stated in our brief many of the considerations here
apply equally to transients as well as to residents.

But we

are not asserting in this case that the facilities must be
open to that extent.

But they certainly must be open to

residents on an equal basis, and the only justification from
the county that.wa have is that it's going to be more costly.
This is precisely what was held in Shapiro t© b© not a

25

compelling interest, not one which can justify a statute like
■this.
Let me simply say in conclusion that the ©pinion of
the Arizona Supreme Court is virtually the only decision in
the welfare field which sustained the validity of the durational
requirements* like this.

We think it should be the last.

The discrimination here is insidious.

The suffering that the

people have who have to meet these requirements is real.
The effect of tills statute is to delay treatment until it is
more costly and until it may be too lat© altogether, and it
is to transfer a burden from the taxpayer base as a whole to
paying patients at hospitals at a time when they can least
afford to pay that cost.

And wa respectfully submit that the

decision below should be reversed.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Mr. Carter,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J, CARTER, III
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. CARTER?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, I represent Maricopa County, which is a territorial
subdivision ©f the State of Arizona that includes the city of
Phoenix and roughly half til© population of the State,

This

will be relevant as I get into the argument.
The county maintains a large, modern hospital,
approximately 500 beds, and a large outpatient clinic department,

26

because it has a statutory duty to provide medical car® for
the indigent who reside in the county.
The issue before this Court which I agree with Mrs.
Schroeder is simply whether or not a 12-month durational
residence requirement for eligibility for medical car® at
county expense violates the United States Constitution,
think it's a relatively simple issue.

I

.And it breaks down into

two componentss
one, does this residency requirement in any way
penalize the right of interstate travel?
And, two, if so, is there a compelling Stata interest
to be protected by imposing the penalty?
Taking the last first, I will state to the Court as
candidly as I can -that the interest which I suggest is
compelling is money.

We estimated in our brief that tha cost

of providing medical care to indigent residents who had not
lived in the county for one year would be approximately
13 percent of the budgeted suras for medical car®.
QUESTIONs

If we were to agree with this argument,

would w® have to depart or retreat from somathing we said in
Shapiro?
MR. CARTERS

No, your Honor, I don’t believe that

is necessary, because as I read Shapiro, you said that -there
must b© a compelling State interest to justify the imposition
of a penalty, and you went on to say that for the purpose of

27
general welfare, that fiscal convenience, ©r soma words to
that effect, was not compelling.
with a life-or-daath matter.

In Shapiro you were dealing

If a person does not receive

food, clothing, and shelter, he will die.
with that in this case»

We are not dealing

I would agree that the State may not

withhold emergency medical care on the basis of a durational
residence requirement for that very reason.

If we attempted

to do that, we would indeed b© conflicting with your holding
in Shapiro.
QUESTIONS

You are, however, conceding that the

applicable standard is that of a compelling State interest?
MR. CARTER!

No, vour Honor, I am not.

My argument

is alternative, first, that there is no penalty, and, second,
that if there is, the interest is compelling.

My primary

argument is that this residence requirement does not constitute
a penalty,
QUESTION:

You say this is more like this welfare

benefits, it’s just a rational basis test, until the medical
need becomes acute,
MR. CARTER:

Yes, that the test to b© applied first

is whether or not the durational residence requirement
constitutes a penalty on the exercise of the right of inter­
stet® travel,

I think that tills is the test that you said

V7as in Durm v, Blumstein.
point of view

And it has to be

examined from that

28
If you take the major durational residence requirements
which have been struck down by this Court, all of those cases
can be reconciled with starns v, Malkerson in which you upheld
a durational residence requirement for university tuition and
with this case.

In the Shapiro case, tha person involved

was threatened with the denial of an absolute necessity of
life.

If you do not receive clothing, if you don't receive

food, even in Arizona, if you don’t receive shelter, you are
very likely to die.
is involved here.

That is not the case in this statute that
If you do find yourself with a medical

condition which puts you in that situation, -then you are
entitled to receive medical car© at public expense, provided
you are a resident, regardless of the term of v©ur residence.
QUESTION 5

That 13 percent cost.

You mean someone

has calculated that the non-residents, that is, persons you
regard as ineligible for this care, if embraced in the program,
would raise the cost 13 percent?

Or is the 13 percent -the

total of all indigent car© of those entitled to it in your
view and those not?
MR. CARTERS

Mr. Chief Justice, at the time that the

brief was filed, w® calculated that the cost of furnishing
non-emergency medical care to residents of the State who were
indigent but had not resided in the State for one year would
be 13 percent of the amounts presently budgeted for furnishing
medical car© to the indigents who have lived in the State for

29

one year.

Since that time our estimates have been revised,

and it is now closer to 10 percent.
QUESTION;

Hw do those figures compare with the

additional cost in Shapiro?
MR* CARTER;
QUESTION;

I don’t know, Mr. Justice.
Because, if I remember, the same argument

was made, wasn't it?
MR. CARTER;

Mr. Justice Marshall, I don’t know

whether they are larger or smaller, but I think that the
standard against which they have to be measured is different.
In Rivera v» Dunn you upheld a decision which struck down a
durational residence requirement for general welfare because
and in the Dunn case the only justification offered was the
cost, but the durational residence requirement has to be,
the penalty

has to be measured, if any, must be measured

against the benefit to be derived.
I would not, for example — well, in Maricopa County,
we are talking about roughly $2.5 million a year at present
rates of inflation and growth.

I would not, for example, argue

that this is a compelling State reason to seize private
property without due process of law or abolish the courts to
save the expense of affording due process before you incarcerate
a person who has committed a. crime.

I think that the penalty,

if any, must be weighed against — that the interest to be
protected must be weighed against the advantage.

And here I

30
am offering for your consideration that $2.5 million does
as a consideration outweigh the interest in non-emergency
medical care.

I am not offering money as —

QUESTION:

Is cancer noa-ernergency?

MR. CARTERS

Mr. Justice Marshall, what is an emergency

and what isn’t Is defined in the statute as a condition
threatening life or limb.

But in practical application, an

emergency is whatever the doctor
room wants to call it.

in the emergency receiving

The only way that I know of to determine

whether any medical condition is an emergency is to have the
person examined by a doctor, and for that reason -QUESTION:

Can a doctor, if you are a resident, can

a doctor say you don’t need treatment and not treat you?
MR. CARTSR:

Mr. Justice Marshall, we operate as a

past of the hospital an emergency receiving room which is
open without question to anybody who comes In regardless of
any condition of residence.
QUESTION s

What I am talking about Is those that

the doctor says, "I think this patient should be hospitalized.”
Does the hospital have any discretion as to taking that
patient or not?
MR. CARTER:

The doctor Is an employes® of the

hospital, and therefore the hospital on a simple theory of
agency would be bound by his decision.
QUESTION:

You mean all the physicians are members

31

of the hospital staff?

I am talking about a private

physician»
MR» CARTERS

Oh, no, your Honor»

We would not be

bound by the determination of a private physician.
QUESTION :

You would decide whether they needed

treatment or not?
MR, CARTER:

Our own doctors would, that's correct,

our hospital employees.

The normal route for requesting

admission would be the emergency room, and if the doctor
there thought that the patient had a life-threatening condition,
he would be admitted.
QUESTIONS

I just have a grave problem of finding

the difference between the horrible things you said were
involved in Shapiro and cancer.
MR. CARTER:

Well, I understand what you are saying.

There is no question that early medical treatment, non-emergency
medical treatment is a. benefit, and I am sure there is no
question that there ar© gray areas where you can pin someone
down, especially a person like me without any medical background.
But the principle that I am asserting is that if the condition
is life-threatening, then it is of necessity an emergency,
and the method of evaluating that condition is an emergency
room with a doctor in charge who would rather keep people
alive than let them die.
has been suggested

So it is much less inhumane than

32
There has been a great deal of emphasis on the case
in Vaughan v„ Bower in which this Court upheld a decision
striking down a durational residence requirement for treatment
at the Arizona State hospital»

But that statuta contained

another provision which was such a flagrant invasion of the
right of interstate travel that the case striking it down is
not really applicable.
QUESTION?

The same three-judge court that decided

til at case decided ValencAano and thought that Vaughan was
controlling,
MR. CARTER*

Mr, Justice White, I don’t know whether

the exact three judges were the same three that tried Valenclan©,
QUESTION s

It was,

QUESTIONs

We just looked at it, it is the same

three judges,
MR. CARTERS

I agree that Valenciano is directly

contrary to the holding of the court on appeal here.
QUESTION ?

That court thought that their own

previous decision was controlling, after our affirmance was
noted in -their opinion in Valenciano.
MR. CARTER?

I would still offer to the Court the

fact that in 'the Vaughan cas©

the statuta empowered th©

superintendent of the State hospital t© take the recently
arrived patient in his hospital and put him ©r her on a
public conveyance back to th© State that he cam© from.

This

33

is a float, it's a foreeabl® expulsion of a person from the
State who has recently arrived, and it puts the entire statute
in a completely different situation»

I wouldn't for a moment

argue that Maricopa County can expel

anyone,

QUESTION:

This doesn't interfere with his right

to travel? it compels him to travel.
MR» CARTER:

Well, they put him on a railroad train

and shipped him out of town.

It is a direct physical invasion

of his individual autonomy.
There is no statistical evidence that the durational
residence requirement in this case has deterred anyone.

In

fact, all of the statistical evidence would tend to suggest
-that there has been no deterrence because Arizona has enjoyed
or suffered an extraordinarily high rate of growth relative
to other States in the Union.

So it is necessary in looking

at this to speak conjecturally, to examine the statute arid
conjecture whether or not it does constitute a penalty on the
exercise of the right of interstate travel.

And I would

suggest that the penalty, if any, that it imposes is identical
or of like degree to the on® that the Court upheld in Staras
and spoke more specifically of in Blandis

v, Kline,

If you intend to live in a "*>
QUESTION:

Stems is a little different, at least

as explained in Blandis

v. Kline, was it not?

That because

of the ambiguous situation of university students, college and

34

university students from out of Stats as from the ambiguity
of whether or not they wsre or were not residents that a State
university could have a one-year residence requirement.» to
determine that issue»

As X understand this case» there is no

.argument about the fact that Mr. Henry Evaro is or was a
resident of Maricopa County» is there?
MR, CARTER;

No» there is non© whatsoever.

In Sfcams there wars several reasons advanced.

One

of them was the difficulty of ascertaining the bona fides of
the residence.

But another one offered» and the one that I

would offer in this case» is simply a. determination that in
•this rather more limited benefit» the State could reasonably
decide to extend it to those who had already contributed to
the economy of the State by paying taxes and living there.
And 1 would like to emphasise to the Court that
indigents are taxpayers.

So an indigent who has lived in the

State for one year» of necessity» both indirectly and directly
has contributed a substantial amount to the tax revenues of the
State.
The argument offered in Sfcams was that with this
rather limited benefit» not a life-threatening or life-giving
benefit» that it could be extended only — the legislature
could reasonably decide to extend it only to those who had
made a contribution of some kind by their presence and
activity to th© State.

35
There is no question that a one-year durational
residence requirement is valuable in determining the bona fides
of residence.

I hesitate to offer it to this Court because

you didn't think much of it in Shapiro or Dunn, but there is
no question that it is valuable.
QUESTION;

Under Shapiro and perhaps some other cases,

it wouldn't make any difference whether it were one year or
30 days, would it, on the principles enunciated?
MR. CARTER;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

As I —

No time factor to test the good faith

element is found permissible.
MR. CARTER;

As I read Shapiro, the State is

entitled to find out -- or may b© entitled to find out whether
a person is in fact a resident, but it may not impose a
durational residence requirement which could threaten his
existence as a means.
QUESTION;

Or impose a fixed arbitrary time for the

purpose of that determination.
MR. CARTER;

I am not off®ring,because of Shapiro

and Because of Dunn, I am not offaring the convenience of
ascertaining residence as a justification for the statute in
tliis case,

I recognize that the Court has already taken care

of that argument for me.
Apropos of the justification that I did offer, I
would like to describe to the Court what the financing of the

36

county hospital is.

It is financed principally, approximately

90 percent, by ad valorem taxes, ad valorem property taxes.
There are other financing devices, but they are minor.

The

ad valorem property taxes to finance it are imposed strictly
on property within the jurisdiction that supports the
hospital.
QUESTIONS
MR. CARTER;

You don’t got any Federal money?
Mr. Justice Marshall, we get a great

deal of Federal money for our health services department, but
most of it is earmarked for specialised programs which do not
have a durational residence requirement»

I am referring to

programs like tuberculosis control, VD, things like that.
That is idie essence of my argument, that if the
Court matches Starns against Shapiro, it is going to have to
find soma basis for distinguishing between the two, because
on the one hand, you struck down a durational residence
requirement as a condition of receiving a benefit which, the
State extended to its citizens, and in the other you upheld it.
I think if you examine those cases, that the only distinction
which can be made between the two is that in th© case of
Shapiro and in the other cases, lik® Dunn, that there 'was
either a life-threatening condition or an invasion of a
fundamental right of citizenship, such as voting, ©r in the —
Hare there is non®.

The condition is not life-threatening,

and there is n© invasion of a fundamental right ©£ citizenship

37
Therefore, it very closely resembles the durational residence
requirement in Sfcarns„

I am not for a moment going to suggest

that this benefit which is withheld is of little value, but
the same is true of reduced tuition.

It is an extremely

valuable benefit, but it is not a life-giving benefit.
QUESTION:

Mr, Carter, am I correct, however, in

saying that the practical result of your position is that
the care of Mr, Evaro and others like him is placed upon the
private nonprofit facilities?
MR. CARTER:

The practical result of my position is

hard to measure, Mr, Justice Blackmun, because it varies with
the facility that a particular county has.

In Maricopa Comity

Hospital, roughly 40 percent of our patients are legally
indigent.

Approximately an equal number are not legally

indigent, however, they are so poor that they cannot pay their
hospital bill.

So we go through the —

QUESTION:

That could be true no matter how much

money you get these days.
MR. CARTER: Mr. Evaro could have been admitted to
the hospital, but ha would have got a bill.

lie wouldn't ■

have been admitted in the capacity of indigent,
QUESTION:

But it does mean that the Memorial

Hospital has to take care ©f Mr. Evaro free of charge,
MR, CARTER:

it does mean that there are soma

cases where the voluntary hospitals ar© extending care to

38
people who would b© eligible but; for the durational residence
requirement, yes.
QUESTION:

Does it not then have a destructive

effect upon the financial integrity of these institutions?
MR* CARTER:

To the exterit that this occurs, it

causes the cost ©f that to be passed on to the private patient.
QUESTION:

I suppose some of those hospitals, or

most of them, are required to do some indigency work or they
lose their status, their tax status?
MR. CARTER:

Well, they are required, most of them

have received a substantial amount of Hill-Burton funds.
Federal funds for their construction, which requires that they
do soma indigent work.
QUESTION:
MR. CARTER:

Yes,
I would also like to point out that the

county hospital, rather than the voluntary hospital in
Maricopa County takes the bulk of idle people who are ineligible
but can’t pay.

They are almost half our hospital population.

If the Court has no further questions, that concludes
ray argument.
QUESTION:

Lst me follow through.

They would also

have to take all the indigents in Arizona that are not residents
of Arizona, the private hospital would?
MR. CARTER:

Well, Mr. Justice Blackmun, if you are

sick and broke, somebody has got -ho take cars of you.

And in

39

Phoenix it’s the county hospital that usually does.
QUESTIONS

It's better for the municipal facility

to do this than for the private facility which has other
indigent claims upon them if it’s worth its salt.
MR. CARTER:

I agree, and in practice this is what

We have an awful lot of uncollected bills.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mrs. Schroeder,
This case is submitted,
