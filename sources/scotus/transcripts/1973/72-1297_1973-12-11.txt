MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear argument next

in Donald E. Johnsonr Administrator of Veterans' Affairs v.
William Robert Robison, Etc.
Mr. Morton., you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD P. NORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HORTON:

The ultimate question on the merits, as

I indicated before, is the same here and the same jurisdictional
questions arise.
After being classified 1-0, which means a conscienti­
ous objector opposed to any participation in war in any form,
even in noncombatant duty, Robison took a job in May 1968 with
a hospital in Boston where he resided and was going to school.
Under procedures I will describe later, he asked the local
board to assign him to that hospital for his alternative
service required under the Selective Service laws, which he
was entitled to, in lieu of induction, having claimed his ex­
emption from service as a conscientious objector.
In August 1968, the local board ordered him to work
at the hospital he had selected effective the preceding May
and he would have at that time been classified l-W, which is a
classification of people who were 1-0 and have been ordered to
do alternative service.
venience .

And I may use those terms for con­

4
Two years later, in May 1370, he finished his alter­
native service and quit his hospital job and, having continued
at school at night, he graduated from col legs in 19 7 0 as well,.
In 1371, he applied — he began law school and he
applied to the VA for educational benefits under Chapter 34,
Title 38, the 1966 Veterans Readjustment Benefits Act.

The VA

decided that ha was ineligible because he did not come within
the statutory definition of eligible veterans, to whom such
benefits are mads available, because he had not been on active
duty as those terras are defined in Title 38.
In February 1972, a complaint was filed against the VA
and the Administrator as a class action for all persons who had
served alternative service and completed their service, and
seeking a declaratory judgment, that the statute was unconsti­
tutional in extending benefits to veterans of military service
but not to persons who had rendered alternative service.
They also sought a declaratory judgment, that plaintiff
and members of the class were entitled to receive these benefits.
Ho injunction or other specific relief was sought.
The ultimate question here, as in Hernandez:, on the
merits is whether it is unconstitutional for Congress to extend
certain fringe benefits to a. specified category of federal
employees, namely certain members of the uniformed services and
not to extend them to anyone else who might share some of the
circumstances or background in common with some of those

5
receiving benefits.
1 think it might help to provide some background about
the statutory scheme, involved here.

Congress has, of course, a

number of specifically enumerated powers pertaining to the armed
forces under the Constitution, and for at least as long as this
country has required the services of armed forces in its employ,
it has exercised these powers to provide benefits to veterans
of various types, veterans of military service.
The first veterans pension law was passed in 1789,
for example, for veterans of the Revolutionary war and the
history of veterans benefits may be traced ever since.
At present, Congress has established a number of pro­
grams for veterans of military service.

Some are contractual

in nature, some are non-contractual, involving essentially
gratuitous benefits.
strictions.

They have a variety of eligibility re­

Each one has to be taken separately.

We deal here

only with the program concerning educational benefits under
chapter 34.
The educational benefits program reflects a number of
policy decisions by Congress in 1966,

One of course was the

level of benefits, which is not as generous as the benefits
provided to veterans of the Korean War or World War II.

The

benefits available to any one of these plaintiffs is under the
law under most circumstances not likely to exceed $10,000.
There is an adjustment for the number of dependents, and you

6
would need a great, number of dependents to be entitled to
$10*000 over the course of the program.
The program is not intended to subsidize education
but merely provide partial assistance.

It is available, however,

without regard to the need for the bentits, and it is also
available without regard to whether yoi.tr education has in fact
been disrupted or hindered.
One limitation in the statute is that you foe a veteran
as defined in Title 38, which means a person who has served
active; duty in land and military forces, in the Air Force, and
who has not been dishonorably discharged.

The .1966 Act further

limits the category of eligible veteran for the purpose of
chapter 34 of the educational benefits to a person who has more
than 180 days of active duty.

Again, a person who is discharged

under conditions other than dishonorable were discharged with a
service"connected disability„
Q

Doesn't it also deal with some other people,

Public Health people?
MR. NORTONs

It does.

The statute itself does not in

terms extend benefits to the Public Health Service or the Coast
and Geodetic Survey, but —
Q

Another lav; then, by reference.

MR. NORTON;

Under the 1957 version of Title 38,

active duty was defined in a way as to include active duty by
commissioned officers of those two organizations within the term

7
"active duty" for veterans* benefits purposes.

So that unless

Congress took affirmative action to exclude them, it would be
covered.

Now, this reflects an historic equation of service in

these two organizations to military service.
World War I days.

It goes back to

These organisations have historically been

from time to time under the direct control of the military,
they have reserve corps, they have military structures, they
at times are subject to military duty, and for purposes of pay
and allowances they are included with the military in Title 37
covering compensation of the uniformed services.
The statutory background is rather detailed, and we
haven't developed it in ousr brief.

And if the Court would like,

we would be happy to submit a supplemental memorandum on that
point.

But there was no affirmative provision of the 1966 Act

which dealt with those categories.
There were several other decisions made in 1966 by
Congress, with the question of whether to extend these benefits
only to people who had active duty in a military zone or
hostilities.

But the purpose was broader than reward in such

service, so that the act is broader.
There was a question of whether to limit benefits to
draftees or to men who were enlisted, and again the statute has
various purposes which ended up being served by including both.
As I understand the claims in these cases, if the statute had
been narrower and had not extended benefits as far as it does,

8
we might not have a case here»

But the position is that Congress

should have, indeed was constitutionally obliged to go even
further than it did.
Q

Well, it was always intended to extend these

benefits to draftees, wasn’t it?

The only question before

Congress was whether, as you understood, what you say, whether
or not they also include volunteers?
MR. NORTON;

That's right.

There is a — one purpose

of —
Q

And the argument, by your brothers on the other

side would still be made if the benefits had been limited to
draftees, as they say that there is nothing in the — no purpose
of Congress to provide an .incentive for enlistment or volunteer­
ing can be served when you just give these benefits to draftees.
MR. MORTON;

Well, that's true.

If you look at one

purpose and fry to measure all of the benefits in terms of that
one purpose, there might be a problem.

But there are multiple

purposes here and each recipient of the benefits need not be
justified by each of the purposes.

I think there has been a

tendency to cross-cross the lines.
Essentially, the plaintiffs' case comes down to the
\

contention that looking only at people who are drafted into
military service and conscientious objectors who performed
alternative service, there are absolutely no factual distinc­
tions between the nature of the service rendered that would

9
permit Congress rationally to conclude that it was an appro­
priate action to extend benefits to veterans of military service
and not to anyone else.
Now, we think it plain that Congress took a different
view, that Congress realized that there were a number of unique
and distinctive features of military service which could have
supported this distinction, so that the distinction cannot be
said to be illusory of utterly lacking in substance or any of
the other terms that this Court has said must be supported in
order to say that the classification is unconstitutional.
Let me turn now to some of the distinctions that
Congress had in mind, either explicitly or in the nature of
things, could reasonably have had in mind.

For one thing, some­

one who was drafted into the military service has an obligation
of six years, four of which after active duty are in the
Reserves.

The person who serves alternative service as a

conscientious objector has a maximum obligation of two years.
Now, that Reserve obligation is not merely a theoret­
ical possibility, it can involve the burdens of training and
weekend or summertime duty or other duty, and Congress had in
mind particularly in 1965 and 566, when this act was being
considered, the fact that, only a few years before it had been
necessary to call up the Reserves in connection with the Berlin
Crisis.

So this was something that was explicitly discussed

and a very significant distinction between the two kinds of

10

service, because, as Congress indicated, having this additional
liability hanging over his head, a person in the military has
a kind of disruption and continuing disruption of his plans and
his educational plans.
Nov/, there is the additional fact that service in the
military involves the possibility of being sent anywhere in the
world to face a variety of dangerous and hostile conditions.
And the District Court in Robison agreed that it was unquestion­
able that military service was hazardous and vigorous and de­
manding, than alternative service.
There has been some suggestion in the briefs that
conscientious objectors at times do serve abroad, but the fact
that it is the police of the Selective Service, it was the
policy, not to order anyone to report to work overseas, persons
who ended up doing alternative duty overseas were ones who had
indicated a willingness to work for one of the more established
organizations who did overseas service and knew that that was
what they were going to do and what they were going into.

And

even then they would not be assigned overseas but would be
assigned to work for a group based in this country who then
might use their services overseas.
There is also a very substantial difference in the
way in which these two groups select or influence the work they
do.

Nbv/, 1 think the influence that a. draftee has over where

he works and what he does is notoriously limited, if there is

II
any at all.

He does what he is told and goes where he is told.

However, under the regulations that were in existence
in 1965 and '66 and continued until 1971, a person doing alter­
native service had considerable opportunity to influence those
decisions.

He could, as Robison did, submit to three types of

employment that he was qualified and willing to do.

If the.

local board found any one of them appropriate, they would then
■order him to do one of those things.

If they did not find any

one of those appropriate, then they would come up with three
and submit them to the registrant.

And if he didn8t find any

one of those satisfactory, then they would have a conference
with the state director, and if they still couldn't work out
something, and finally the local board did have the authority
to order the registrant to do work but only with the approval
of the national director.

This is a far cry from the situation

presented to a military draftee.
It meant understandably that a conscientious objector
who was going to do alternative service had much greater oppor­
tunity to fit his service in consistent with other obligations
he might have, such as pursuing his education, as Mr. Robison
was able to do.
Of course, the pay — I think it important to note
one misapprehension of the District Court.
quotes what is

The District Court

cited as a regulation of the Selective Service

which permitted local boards to assign and abruptly reassign

persons who were doing alternative service anywhere, at any
time, even in combat zones.
of no such regulation.

Now, the Selective Service knows

It is not contained in the regulation

that is cited in the District Court’s opinion, and there is
none such that, was in effect during the period that Congress
was considering this Act: or since.
it came from.

We simply don’t, knoitf where

I think there is a reference to it in one of the

briefs which is based on the District Court’s use of it in the
opinion but, again, there is no way we can track it down.
Q

Mr. Norton, I take it that Judge Garrity rejected

this position of the government’s, that there is a rational dis­
tinction between those who were subject to being assigned a
hazardous combat duty and those who were not, on the grounds
that if Congress had intended to rely on that distinction, that
it probably cou3.d have.

But I gather he said that that wasn’t

what Congress had in mind.

What is the government's position

with respect to that?
MR. NORTON:

Well, we are not saying it is only a

distinction between those subject to hazardous combat duty.
We are saying that even if you lock at all military draftees,
the nature of the disruption of their lives was quantiatively
and qualitatively differant from that of anyone else who is
affected by the Selective Service laws, and that Congress could
rationally conclude that given these various distinctions that
it was appropriate to extend benefits to the military draftees.

13

Even if you were to accept the contention that alter­
native service veterans, if yen will, had some disruption of
their education and hence had some need of the same kind of
benefits, 1 think it is permissible, certainly from this Court’s
decision in Jefferson v. Hackney, for Congress to distinguish
between different categories of people who might share in some
general way a. characteristic and extend benefits in a differen­
tial fashion, as long as a distinction, the classification is
not altogether illustory or utterly lacking in any rational
meaning,
Q

Do you say there is a question of what Congress

might have reasonable considered, not what the legislative
history shows they did in fact consider?
MR. MORTON:

Well, we say that the test that has been

announced in this Court's decisions is the firmer, that could
it rationally have been conceived, is there a state of acts
that might have been conceived to justify this distinction,
but we say in addition that the real distinctions that were
directly addressed by Congress which support this distinction.
Mow, another one that Congress specifically mentioned
was the fact that military veterans have been subjected to
deprivations of liberty and loss of freedom inherent in military
discipline and military life is subject to the universal
Uniform Code of Military Justice, and this kind of existence
for tx<70 or more years creates additional transition problems in

14
returning to civilian life.
There is also the — related to that -- the fact that
in the military someone may, after serving, be discharged on
grounds other than honorable, indeed on dishonorable grounds,
because of things done in the military; whereas, someone doing
alternative service is not faced with that possibility, if
•they complete their two years, even though they may have done
something which would have warranted a dishonorable discharge
in the military, they have no such adverse consequence attach­
ing to their service.

And this has a direct bearing in this

case because a veteran of military

service served, otherwise

within the definition of an eligible veteran, but for some
reason was dishonorably discharged, would not be entitled to
these benfits.

And under the District Court's decision hexe,

if Someone who did alternative service committed the same
offense, they would be entitled.

So the result of the decision

below is to place alternative service people in a somewhat more
favored position than —
Q

Mien you complete your alternative service, you

don't get any kind of piece of paper or anything, do you?
MR. MORTON:

You get a piece of paper saying you have

satisfied your —
Q

It is not like a discharge?

MR, NORTON:
complete.

No,

It can only be a complete or an in­

If you haven’t completed it, they can order you to

15
continue until you do.
Q

But I mean are you given something like a card

or anything?
MR. NORTON:
Q

I think the Selective Service ~~

X am not saying it is important to this case,

it is just a matter of —
MR. HORTON:

— the Selective Service X think sends

you a -piece of paper that certifies that you have completed
your alternative service.
There is another point along this line, another mis­
apprehension of the District Court, as argued and as stated by
the court, that a person in alternative service could be sub­
ject to prosecution for failure to comply with a reasonable
order of his employer.

Now, this was not a part of the scheme,

the regulatory scheme when Congress was considering the
Veterans’ Benefits Act.

This is under a regulation that was

not adopted until 1971, and it can have no bearing, of course,
on the rationality of the judgment made by Congress in 1966.
Similarly, there are repeated references to guide­
lines issued by the Director of Selective Service to the effect
that the disruption of an alternative service person’s life
should be comparable to that of someone in the military.

Again,

these were not part of the regulatory scheme when Congress
was considering the 1966 act.
time.

They were .intorducad at a later

They were not of binding, legal effect and indeed one

16
court has held that they were questionable legal significance in
any event»
Of course, another distinction is the pay.
during the period that Mr. Robison

started work, was paid I

think at the rate of about $100 a month.
he started work at $00 a week.

A draftee,

Mr. Robison says that

There is no indication in the

record as to any increases he may have had after that time, any
fringe benefits or allowances or other compensation.

So that

a draftee is in an especially difficult position to try to save
money or to finance education, even if he had the time to do it.
while he was in the service.
Q

Is there any limit on how much a person may re­

ceive under your alternative service employment?
MR. MORTON:

There were not in 1965-66, when Congress

was considering this act.

At a later time, another one of

these guidelines of the Selective Service Director suggested
that the pay should be comparable to that of someone in the
military, but it is a very general statement and it is not
clear to what effect, what extent if at all it was applied.
Q

It is not statutory?

MR. NORTON:

It is not statutory.

The statute con­

tains none of these limitations.
Q

Of course, the draftee gets free room and board.

MR. NORTON:

Well, that's true, but it is free room

and board where the military wants him to live, which may be at

17
a military base in the far reaches of the world, a place where
he is unable to shape his life so as to pursue his education.
Q

Well, of course, you have made -that argument

already, that this is one of the things that a draftee is sub­
ject to.

If you treat that as

I don't really see how you can

separately treat the fact that it is some kind of a detraction
from the room and board that the same thing happens,

I mean

if you are talking strictly in terns of compensation.
MR. NORTON;

Well, we don’t know whether on this

record whether any of these alternative service people end up
getting room and board.

And it can’t be assumed that they

were getting it, generally getting it or generally not.

The

Congress might have reasonably concluded that the draftee’s
situation was sufficiently distinctive to justify these bene­
fits .
Of course, as this Court has indicated, the question
is not whether Congress’ assumptions in these regard were
actually warranted by the facts, it was whether there was a
reasonable determination for Congress to make,
Q

Well, McGowan v« Maryland goes a great deal

beyond that, so if on any conceivable basis it could be sup­
ported, that would be enough.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DAVID ROSENBERG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. ROSENBERG:

Thank you, sir.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
This is a class action on behalf of conscientious
objectors whose

religious beliefs prevent them from serving

under military authority.

In every other respect, these men

are treated precisely like every other registrant drafted under
the Selective Service Act.

They are drafted in accordance

with the normal order of call.

They are drafted no matter

where they are and under what circuxnstnces their civilian life
places them except as to the normal kind of exemptions and
deferments.
Q

How many of them were wounded or killed in the

line of duty during the period of 1965 to 1973?
MR. ROSENBERG;

Your Honor, as far as we can tell,

only one, but the statistics are not kept.
numerous of them have been injured.

The fact is that

Your question is quite

correct, they have not served in the military capacity in
combatant duties.
Q

So there is that difference.

MR. ROSENBERG:

But they are treated in every other

20
respect,
Q

Well, you said in all respects but one.

I are

suggesting that there may be at least two.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Well, Your Honor, the — it goes di­

rectly to tiie question of whether or not there is any potential
for hazardous duty.

For these men, there is just as ranch poten­

tial as any other member of the service.

These men can be de­

ployed at. the will of the President, at the will of the
Selective Service? that the President and the Selective Service
have not deployed these men to Vietnamon the whole during that
period really only reflects in my mind that their service was
more — was needed more, that they were doing better service
here.

There is no inherent limitation —
Q

They couldn't be deployed to combat duty.

MR. ROSENBERG:

They couldn't be deployed to combat

duty —
Q

Well, that makes quite a bit of difference.

It

just doesn't make a great deal of difference to say they can be
sent to Vietnam or out of the country.
MR. ROSENBERG:
0

Well —

The question is whether they can be put into

combat duty.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Well, that is true, Your Honor, but

there are lA-O’s in the service, conscientious objectors —
Q

All right, let's just start with the proposition

21

that they may not be sent, into combat,
MR, ROSENBERG:

They may not be sent into combat, do

combat duty,
Q

Let’s just don’t forget that.

MR. ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, I haven’t forgotten it.

It is obviously critical to this case.
Q

How about the Code of Military Justice, ara they

subject to the jurisdiction of -MR. ROSENBERG:

No, Your Honor, they are not.

But as

the Senate report clearly indicates, the fact that these men
are under discipline doesn’t, at all disturb their ability to
become students.

As a matter of fact, it enhances their

ability to become students.
Q

Your Honor —

Wall, I don't see any difference tat the time

they are engaged in discharging their two-year period of
service.

Are they during that period of service subject to

courts martial and military discipline?
MRo ROSENBERG:

No, Your Honor, they are subject to

felony, federal felony criminal prosecutions for their viola­
tions.

They are not subject to courts martial prosecution.

But at the heart of this case is the question of whether any
of these differences — and I concede there are differences —
whether any of these differences are relevant to the purpose
that the act seeks to achieve.

This act has stated, unlike all

the others I think ever before considered by this Court, the

22

explicit, purposes for what has turned out to he one of the major
educational programs in the history of this country.

The ex­

plicit that Congress established this program for was to com­
pensate for the lost, time that a man entails when he doss
service for his country.

The fact that he is under military

discipline, the fact that he might be sent into combat duty does
not raise or lower or in any way affect the disruption that
Congress had in mind when it granted these benefits.
As a matter of fact, Your Honors, it would be maybe a
cruel irony if the rigors of service were taken into account
when -— and by this Court in assessing legislation, when Congress
refused to even parse out in the scale of benefits more benefits
for those men who actually went into combat, more benefits for
the people who actually faced death on the front lines.

MR. ROSENBERG:

pursuits by the government during their time in service.

That is with the government's permission.

government’s permission —

Do you have anything in the congressional history

that said that there was any question that this applied to
people who were not in the active military service?
MR. ROSENBERG:

That this did not apply to anyone in

the active military service, yes, Your Honor.
Q

No, outside.

MR. ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, if there is an affirmance,

<

I think we do have a clear right.

I think the Constitution does

give us a clear right to these benfifcs.

We have been excluded

both arbitrarily and I believe excluded discriminatorily, in­
vidiously.

The history that we have to look at is the history

that surrounds the veterans' benefits programs when they emerged
during World War II.

Conscientious objectors who did alternative

service were specifically excluded by Congress during that
period of time.

The question came before Congress,

as if Congress overlooked the problem.

It wasn't

Congress faced it

several important times, and yet Congress refused to give these
men the pittance that they need to compensate for the dis­
abilities that they suffer just as much as anybody in the
military.

They receive no disability benefits for physical

27
injuries.

They receive no dependency allowances.

And in World

War II they weren't even compensated for any of the service
that they performed.

This is the history that gives birth to

the present legislation, since the present legislation is
modeled almost directly after the Korean War GI Bill and after
the World War II GI Bill.
Q

The federal government isn't inevitably their

employer, is it, during this period of service?

Sometimes I

guess it is, but often it is for a state or municipal or
’county hospital or institution, and I suppose sometimes for a
private one, isn't it?
MR. ROSENBERG:

That's exactly correct, Your Honor.

But the fact is that there are no guarantees that these men
will even get the kind of workmen’s compensation that might
cover some of their disabilities.

In fact, one of the peti­

tioners in the Hernandez case working a hospital contracted,
hepatitis and, as it turns out, he had no compensation whatso­
ever to cover that disability.
Q

Well, he might have had Blue Cross.

MR. ROSENBERG:

fact is, Your Honor, these men are paid on a ratio that gives

In fact, as I say, in World War II these men did

that service and they received no compensation whatsoever.
When the question was brought before Congress whether
the money they earned, which was in a frozen account,, should be
turned over to their dependents who in many cases were in very
bad straits, Congress refused.

And the colloquy that we re­

printed in our brief indicates that Congress refused because it
was afraid of public reaction.

It was afraid that the public

would react that these men were getting

resentment that has spurred Congress on fco the deprivations
that they have forced these 1-0 conscientious objectors to bear.
Your Honor, these men are subject to a policy cf dis­
ruption of their lives that is by Presidential mandate supposed
to be equal to the disruption generally that men in the. mili­
tary suffer.

The government has indicated that this policy was

not written form in 1966.

I fail to see the relevance of that.

The fact is that that policy was stated throughout by the
Selective Service Director since the inception of the 1-0
conscientious objector program.

How did it apply to this man?

Q

Well, I want what is in the record about one of

the named plaintiffs to show to what extent his life was dis­

MR. ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, his life was disrupted fco

the extent that he was forced to go to night school to complete
one year of college on his own on whatever money he could
scrape together.

When he left the service, he did not have

enough money fco go to school.

He had to work a whole hear to

put together enough money to undertake his first year of law
school.

He had no savings when he left the servies.

He was as

disadvantaged as any member of the military in that respect.
Q

Is that in the record?

MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

As a matter of fact,

we stated -Q

MR. ROSENBERG;

Q

Well, how was he disrupted other than the fact

that he worked in the day and went to school at night?
MR. ROSENBERG:

He was disrupted because he received

an $80 a week compensation for his work and wasn’t able to save
a cent.
Q

Well, how much was he making before that?

MR. ROSENBERG:
Q

I believe —

Was that in the record?

MR. ROSENBERG:

I don’t know what he was doing pre­

cisely before he entered the service.
Q

So that is the only disruption?

MR. ROSENBERG;

Your Honor, as we state in the com­

plaint, this man, when he entered law school, faced the problem
that he would not be able to continue his law school education
because he had no savings.

That is why he brought this suit.

That is why he applied for veterans' benefits.

He had no money.

He was poor, and he was left poor by the service he did.

nobody is saying that he shouldn't have done his service.

decided that he should receive no compensation.

It has

This is —

32
Q

At the time ha want under this program, Mr.

Rosenberg, did he then have the option to go into noncombat
military service?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Fie had that option, Your Honor, and

of course our claim here is that under Sherbert the differential
that the government has established places a burden on a man,
and we don't say that this man would have bowed under to that
burden, but places a burden on that man to give up his religious
scruples and serve in the military in a capacity that would
gain him benefits.
Q

He didn91 do that.

Do you say that it was irrational, that it is

irrational to reach a conclusion that a man in this category
suffers less hardship, less disruption than those who go into
the regular military service?
MR, ROSENBERG:

I would say, Your Honor, that in both

services there are men who suffer great or lesser disruptions.
On the whole, I would say that the men in alternative service
suffer the same general scope of disruption as the general run
of those who do military service and those who do I-AO alter­
native conscientious objector service in the military.

The

fact is that there are thousands of people in the military who
go to school at night, and part-time, draftees who go to school
at night and during the part-time period that they are not in
service or they are not serving, or employed.

Those men receive

benefits just as our men I think should, even though he did go

33
to school part-time.
This act doesn't parse out when benefits should foe
given.

It is given during wartime and peacetime.

It doesn't

relate at all to where the man serves or under what conditions
he serves.

All it requires

,

the sole criteria for receiving

these benefits is 180 days' service.
Q

Mr. Rosenberg, were these benefits available to

people in the service between roughly the time that the Korean
War had ended and the time that the Vietnam War started?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Absolutely, Your Honor, because the

act applies retroactively.

It took up three to four million

people who served between 1955 and 1966 and gave them benefits,
all of them were made eligible by the act in .1966.
Q

But how about the. Korean Bill of Rights.

When

did that expire by its terms?
MR. ROSENBERG:

That expired on the very day that the

retroactive effect attacks.

In other words, there has always

been a GX Bill by virtue of the .1966 act.
Q

But I don't think that quite answers my question

because I take it from what you say that although looking back
post-1966 we can say that everybody has been covered.

I take

it that if one looked at the period of the late fifties and
early sixties the veterans then serving were not by any law
in force while they were serving.
MR. ROSENBERG:

That is exactly correct, Your Honor.

But it is a fact that in 1966 the act applied, retroactively to
everyone who served between 1955, that is the termination date
of the Korean GI Bill, and 1966» no matter where they served or
under what conditions, and the scope is three to four million
people that were brought under the coverage.

As a matter of

fact, this is an enormous education program which to date has
expended over $8»3 billion.
o

Mr. Rosenberg, may I ash you, do I correctly read

Judge Garrifcy’s opinion as finding ending in effect with an in­
terpretation of the statute as at least covering your clients?
MR. ROSENBERG:
the statute, Your Honor.
Q

No, it is not an interpretation of
It is --

He followed Justice Harlan's technique in Welch,

didn't he?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes, Your Honor, and of course I think

the format set down in the Frontlero case, where the Court
affirms that in a situation like this, where a program can be
nullified or extended, the extension will be granted if it
would probably — if it was likely that Congress would want to
maintain the program even with this additional coverage.

And I

can't see, Your Honor, how Congress would refuse and deny
millions of people benefits just because a few others would
get benefits.
Q

But I gather from what your argument was earlier,

you think the statute on its face reflects a deliberate

congressional interest to exclude ~~
MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes, Your Honor, I do believe that.

1

do believe that, based on the legislative history we found
since the District Court opinion.
sent it to the District Court.

I will say we did not pre­

It was very hard to come by.

But from the material we have been able to gather, I do believe
now that it was a congressional intention, a deliberate inten­
tion to exclude these men.
Q

Well, now, the extension that Justice Harlan

suggested in Welch rested on his feeling that the statute we
then had before us contravene the. establishment clause?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes, Your Honor, I believe that, is

true.
Q

And what do you suggest that Judge Garrity

hinges his extension to?
MR. ROSENBERG:

On the Firth Amendment, that it

violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment?
that these men have been arbitrarily excluded.

Nov.1, I will say,

Your Honor, before this Court wa reassert our position that
under Sherbert v. Varner and under the heightened scrutiny
demanded by the equal protection guarantee, we are entitled to
that scrutiny and we are entitled to a constitutional ruling
at that level.
In other words, we believe —

Q

A constitutional ruling to what effect?

36
MR. ROSENBERG;

A ruling that without a compelling

state interest, without any compelling interested in this ex­
clusion, this exclusion both denies the free exercise of re­
ligion under the First Amendment and denies equal protection
under the Fifth Amendment.
Q

With what consequence with the statute as written?

MR. ROSENBERG;

The consequence would bs, Your Honor,

that the clause that excludes would be extended to cover or
read not to exclude these people who have done alternative
service for 180 days.
Your Honor, X do want to assert that while the
District Court's ruling did cover the First Amendment claim we
are making here, and I believe we are properly making it again,
the government has not responded to it, we assert that under
Sherbert v. Verner, just like Sherbert v. Verner, valuable
government benefits, compensatory benefits are being denied to
one who asserts, because of religious belief, a view that he
or she cannot, undertake some conduct which brings them within
the scope of eligibility.

In other words, this is a condition­

ing of veterans’ benefits on this man’s relinquishing his
religious beliefs.
Your Honor, if there is a compelling interest in ex­
cluding these men as harshly as Congress has done, I would, like
to hear it and the government has offered none, none whatsoever.
And we come down to that position.

Is the government able to

3?
supply any compelling or real reason why these men are ex­
cluded?
money.

The government may say that it is an attempt to save
Your Honor, I submit, where a program of this size,

covering these many people, would it be plausible that Congress
wanted to save the pittance that we save if a few thousand
were excluded?

I don’t believe that is true.

And in addition, I also don’t believe that the mere
objective of saving money is a compelling interest.

On the

whole, Your Honor, there has been no interest, affirmative in­
terest asserted by the government whatsoever.

The only inter­

est that the government asserts is that there are some fine
line distinctions in many cases between the kind of service
one man does and the kind of service, that another dees.
Those distinctions don’t obtain in every case and
they don’t warrant an absolute exclusion from these valuable
benefits.

If Congress wanted to draw that fine line, it has

the languae to do it.

It. could have said we want to give

benefits to those who have done military service because they
face the rigors, and we want to give less money to those who
have not faced those rigors of military service but who none­
theless have been disrupted.

Congress could have chosen that

route because, as the government concedes, both classes of
people have suffered educational disruption.

Congress invoked

an absolue exclusion.
Q

Weil, you say they could have given less money

to the conscientious objectors.

It is hard for me to figure

out how they could constitutionally do that if they could not
give them no money.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, I was pauciting on the

government's position that there was a difference.

If there was

such a difference, it was likely Congress would have reflected
it in its legislation.

I don't believe there is a difference,

I am pauciting my statement on a government assertion that
there is a difference in the nature of service,

But we have

here an absolute exclusion, one that reflects no differences,
and one that shuts out one man in the harshest type of situation
And it shuts him out from needed compensation in the same way
that he has always been shut out from all the other kinds of
needed compensation provided veterans.
Your Honors, if we have to come down drawing
parallels, I submit there is no distinction between the service

Your Honor, I am not aware.

Obviously, if he had done his service properly,

there probably would be no contact, unless of course the de­
cision was made on the part of the President that these men
were needed some place else, and then there would be a who3.e

40
rearrangement of their circumstances, and they vrould be shipped
off to whatever assignment the President deemed necessary.
Q

Doss the record show how many times the President

made any such decision during the period in question?
MR. ROSENBERGs

No, Your Honor.

The fact is that I--0

conscientious objector service has changed radically since its
inception.

First these men served in camps, in federal govern­

ment camps, and now they are not serving in federal government
camps and serving in mixed responsibilities.

But as the

exigencies of any critis period, they could be deployed wherever
the President needs them the most, and the only assumption I
think the Court can reach is that these men have been deployed
where the President has deemed their services the most neces'sary and the most valuable.
I want to reiterate one further point:
states purposes that are explicit.

This Act

This Court has never before,

I believe, had the opportunity to review an Act with explicit
stated purposes.
"

If new purposes are to be added, new sub-

\

stantiv© purposes are to be added, I believe it cannot be done

j
in this context.

Congress has stated its purposes and by

virtue of that statement 1' believe has excluded alternative
purposes, and I think we —
Q

Well, take, the example of the National Labor

Relations Act, when it was first passed.

As I recall the re­

cital of the legislative purpose there was that interstate

41
commerce was being disrupted, because of strikes and so forth.
Now, do you. think it. would have been open simply to come in on
that legislative history and say, wall, in fact, there was no
disruption of interstate commerce here and so this doesn’t
meet the purpose that Congress said when it was enacted so we
can’t apply the case, even though by its terms it might apply?
MR. ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, as I understand the

question, it seemed to me that if Congress’ decision were based
on no facts whatsoever and purely arbitrary, then I believe
the Court could enter that area, otherwise I think not, that
the Court is bound by -the stated purposes and those purposes
are binding on the Court to the fullest degree, as they are
here,
Q

It is certainly different than some of our cases

have said about equal protection with any conceivable set of
facts»
MR. ROSENBERG:

There is no question. Your Honor, and

1 concede that, but none of those cases involved legislation
that stated on the face of the legislation there are four
direct purposes to this education program we have just created.
And that is what this legislation does.
Q

Well, can you be that sure that in the legis­

lation we were reviewing in the other cases, there weren’t
stated purposes but that the Court just didn’t think they were
important?

42
MR. ROSENBERG:

Your Honor, I have canvassed many.

can't say that I have canvassed them all.

1

And from what I can

tell, there has never been a case like this.
I see that my time is almost up.

Are there any

further questions, because I do believe that this point I would
just simply reiterate that we do assert that Sherbert v. Verner
governs this case and a compelling interest is required and
none has been offered by the government, that under equal protection we are entitled to the strict scrutiny review because
in this case First Amendment, protected activitity, that is
religious liberty, is affected by the regulations that we are
challenging.

And in addition I submit, Your Honors, based on

the history that wo have disclosed inour brief, that the 1-0
conscientious objector during wartime is a suspect class that
has no access to political forums, that is at the mercy of
public resentment as the history discloses, and they have been
ill-treated consistently throughout their history and deserves
r.he protections of the suspect classification.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR.

chief

JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Rosenberg.

Mr. Norton, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD P. NORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. NORTON:

Just a few comments.

With respect to the last remark about the public

at.tit.ude toward conscientious objectors and the suggestion that
Congress had a purpose somehow penalizing people who were conI

scienfciously opposed to participation in war, there is not a
shred of evidence of any such intention underlying the classi­
fication embodied in the 1966 statute.

That is conceded in

the plaintiff's brief.
What they have done is gone back to variotts things
in World War II, very different circximstances, very different
public attitudes towards war, towards conscientious objection.
The attitudes and views expressed than by Congressmen have no
bearing on what happened in 1966.

Indeed, I think the Court

has acknowledged that Congress has demonstrated in increasing
degree of accommodation to the views of conscientious objectors
in the statutes that have been enacted as time has gone on.

I

think it is wholly unsupported a contention to make„
The comment concerning the statement of purposes in
the Act- underlies one of the deficiencies of the District
Court's approach in this case, we believe, and he took a very
strict and narrow reading of the purposes.

Now, this Court has

never said that the Court is confined to an explicit statement
of purposes in considering the validity of the statute.

Indeed,

in the Marino case, the Food Stamp case last year, the Court
first considered the explicit purposes that were stated and
then went on to consider whether there were other possible
purposes that might have justified the statute.

It is a

perfectly proper and established approach.
Now, there is one continuing misapprehension that per
vades the argument on the other side, and that is that there is
in this statute an exclusion.
exclude anyone.

The statute does not in turn,

All it does is extend benefits to a defined

category of persons who rendered military service.

People who

rendered alternative service are not the only people who are
denied benefits.

Everyone else who is not in that category

is denied benefits.

Someone who has conscientious objection

to participation in war and who does not happen to fall within
the statutory exemption and therefore goes to prison instead,
as Mr. Gillette chose to do, his life is disrupted by the
'Selective Service laws, but he is plainly not entitled to
benefits.

So it is wrong to think of —
Q

,,

But the plaintiff, as I understand at )la;ast, is

under-inclusive, and that, was the basic claim wasn't it in
Welsh?
MR. NORTON:

Well, that is the claim but I think it

is wrong to characterise the statute as carving out an exclu­
sion of any definable —
Q

Well, it is under-inclusive.

MR. NORTON;
Q

Under-inclusive.

Would you think that is an unfair way to

characterise th® argument?
MR. NORTON;

Wall, they say they should be covered as

45
well, that's true,
Q

They say it is unconstitutionally under-

inclusive.
MR. NORTON;
Q

That is considerably different.

MR. NORTON;
Q

That's correct.

Well —

Suppose it is under-inclusive in the sense that

it doesn't include the Peace Corps veterans in the broad, sense,
but the question in this case is whether it is constitutionally
under-inclusive, as Justice White suggested.
MR. NORTON;

Well, that is true, and I have that in

mind, and 1 think we come back in that case to the question
that was raised, whether it would be sufficient if there be
any distinction between these two categories and whether then
it would be permissible to grant a different level of benefits
to military veterans than to alternative service veterans.
Q

Mr. Norton, could the man who served in military

service for 179 days make the same argument?

His life has been

just as much disrupted, but he is excluded by the statute.
MR. NORTON;

He would have the same — he could argue

that it is irrational to cut it off at 179 or 180 days.

Any

statute that extends benefits or imposes restraints that draws
lines is bound to create people on the other side of that line.
These are legislative decisions.

These are policy judgments

which we feel are within Congress' power to make.

But the

46
claim being asserted is as persuasive and as meritorious as the
plaintiffs argued, is no reason to think that if it were
addressed to Congress, so that Congress ware to focus specific­
ally on it, it would be turned down.

They are asking this

Court to do something that Congress has not explicitly ever
done, itself,
Q

And you say there is no other basis for juris­

diction other than 1331?
MR. NORTON:

Q

Do you say that is inappropriate?

MR. NORTON:

We say yes, that is inappropriate, that

that offers relief in the nature of mandamus, but this is not a
case that is within the terms of that statute as previously
construed.
Q

I don’t believe the complaint asked for a writ

of mandamus, did it?
MR. NORTON:

No, it asks only for declaratory relief.

That's right.

And of course tha declar-

:afeort judgment statute, this Court has said, doss not: grant
jurisdictions, but merely provides —
Q

This $10,000 here — suppose this man cannot get

•an education without this help, would the difference be what a
man who is educated makes in. his lifetime or not?
MR. NORTON:
die bounds

Well, that would be going I think beyond

prior decisions concerning jurisdictional amount.

What they are seeking in tills case is a claim to a certain
amount of money.
Q

Now —

And it is less than $10,000?

MR. NORTON:

And it is less than $10,000.

Q

As I understand, they are claiming an education

which they can’t gat without, that money.

1 am just giving you

what —
MR. MORTON:

I understand, and they are trying to

boost up the monetary value by relying upon consequential events
that may or may not happen later down the road.
Q

What are the dollar amounts?

MR. NORTON;
the family.

They vary, depending upon the sise of

Originally, in 1966, the basic allotment for an

individual who was full-time student was $130.
Q

For how long?

MR. NORTON;

For up to 36 months of education.

And

that has since twice been, increased, and the current base figure
I believe is $220.
Q

For how long?

MR. MORTON:

Again 36 months.

Now, if you have de­

pendents, are married — I don't know if it goes by numbers or
spouse, but there is a scale that increases the benefits de­
pending upon the number of dependants.
Q

Is tuition over and above that?

Or is that the

total?
MR. NORTON:
Q

So it comes out to about $8,000?

MR. NORTON:
Q

That is the total,

Something on that order.

Not $10,000.

But in your brief at least you

relegate this to a footnote.
MR. NORTON:

Well, I think that is because our prin­

cipal reliance is on 211.
Q

And what do you have to say about the asserted

jurisdiction under 1361?
MR. NORTON;

Well, we say that that does not apply

here either because they are not seeking relief —
Q

Now,- under the previous case, they were seeking

mandamus?
MR. NORTON;
Q

They did there, but —

If in this case they simply added that in the

prayer of their complaint, you would find no difficulties under
.

1361

?

MR. NORTON;

Well, the relief they are seeking is not

relief in the nature of mandamus, we don’t believe.

As Mr.

'justice Marshall indicated, that traditionally involved a
ministerial duty involving a clear legal right, and that was
certainly —■
Q

Of course, as you know, there is a good deal in

the. legal literature about a written in nature of a writ

of

mandamus, whether or not that means what mandamus we all learn
in law school meant, just a ministerial act.
MR. NORTON;
clearly no legal right.
make their claim.

But on. the face of the statute they have
They have to go beyond the statute to

Q

Mr. Norton, as I understand the law, it is estab­

lished by decisions of this Court that a declaratory judgment
act does not confer an independent basis of jurisdiction on
this court if it is not present by some other1 jurisdictional
grant.

Have there been any decisions one way or the other as

to whether 1361, the mandamus section, confers an independent
grant of jurisdiction?
MR. NORTON:

I am not entirely sure.

I think there

may be some lower court decisions both ways, but 1 think has
been construed by some courts as granting jurisdiction within
its rather narrow limits, if it is a case appropriate for that
kind of' relief.
Q

This is not within those limits, you say?

MR. NORTON:

That is our position.

I would just conclude with one comment about the
First Amendment argument.

We did address the First Amendment

issues in our brief in Hernandez.

We did not explicitly address

them in a reply brief or in our brief in Robison but they are
covered there.

And 7. would say briefly that, unlike the

situation in. Sherbert v. Verner, where, the denial of unemploy­
ment compensation constituted a continuing pressure upon the
claimant to forego her religious scruples and to work on
Saturday, here there is no such continuing pressure.

A decision

was made by Mr. Robison back in 1958 to taka advantage of
an exemption from military service that Congress had

made

available, and that is the source of his present situation,
and -there is no continuing pressure on him.

He does not claim

that the possibility of receiving benefits exerted any pressure
on him? in fact, if it did exert pressure, it wasn't very
effective pressure because he went ahead anyway.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Morton.

Thank you, Mr. Rosenberg.
The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:43 o'clock p.m„, the case was
submitted.]
