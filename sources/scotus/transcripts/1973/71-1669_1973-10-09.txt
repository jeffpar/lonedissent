P R O C E E DING S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: The. Court will hear
arguments first this morning in No. 71-1669, Gustafson against
Florida.
Mr. Russ, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. RUSS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUSS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
My name is James* Russ.

I represent the petitioner,

James E„ Gustafson.
This is an action of certiorari to the Florida
Supreme Court.

This is a case involving a felony conviction

of the charge of possession of marijuana, and the case we
bring to this Court involves a search and seizure, Fourth
Amendment question.
The specific question is, involves the warrantless
body search and seizure of a motorist who was arrested on a
minor traffic violation.

And the basic facts are that in

January of 1969 Mr. Gustafson, while driving his automobile,
was stopped by a Florida policeman.

He was asked for his

driver's license, and when he advised the policeman he did
not have his driver’s license in his personal possession,
he was placed under arrest.
QUESTION; Why did the policeman stop him, Mr. Russ?

4
MR. RUSS:

He stopped him because he observed him

to be weaving, Justice Relinquish.

His testimony was that he

weaved three or four times across a divider line between one
lane and a second lane.
QUESTION: What time of day was it?
MR. RUSS:

This was approximately 1:30 or 2 o'clock

in the morning, Your Honor.
In any event, after Mr. Gustafson —
QUESTION:

Now that you've been interrupted,, may I

do it again, just so I can understand this.

I think I do.

Do I understand correctly that in this case you do not
question the constitutional validity of the arrest?
MR. RUSS:

That's correct, Justice Stewart.

We

are challenging the constitutional validity of the search.
QUESTION:

Yes. So in this case we proceed on the

premise that the arrest was upon probable cause and was
constitutionally a valid arrest?
KR. RUSS:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Thank you.
MR. RtTSS: For the charge of driving an automobile
with no valid ~“*
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

MR. RUSS:

— driver's license in his possession.

QUESTIONs

Yes, sir.

MR. RUSS:

Mow, after he was removed from the

automobile —
QUESTION;

So, as far as that goes, you concede the

validity of the stop, then?
MR- RUSSs
QUESTION;

Yes, we do, -Justice White.
And then the validity of the arrest

based on the fact that he had no license?
MR. RUSS:

Yes, sir.

Yea, sir.

And, of course, after he told the police officer
that he did not have his driver's license with him, he was
then arrested for that violation.

He was taken out of the

car, or he got out of the oar by himself, and he was then
spread-eagled against the police car, where, upon a pat-down,
the police officer felt something in his coat pocket.

He

put his hand into his left coat pocket and removed a box of
what appeared to be Benson & Hedges cigarettes.
At this point he put Mr. Gustafson in the back seat
of his patrol car, and there was a passenger with Mr.
Gustafson, a Mr. Moody; and the second police officer had
arrived, Officer Levy.
QUESTION;

And at this point in time he told -~

who was in possession of the package of

cigarettes at that time?
MR. RUSS; The police officer, Lieutenant Smith.
He had physical possession —
QUESTION:

When did he open it?

MR. RUSS;

He opened, it, apparently, a matter of a

6
few minutas later.

In the interim he had advised the

passenger to go ahead and drive off Gustafson’s automobile,
to follow them to the police station, and had told Officer
Levy to check Hr, Moody to make sure be had a valid driver’s
license.
Then when he opened up the box of Benson s Hedges, ~~
QUESTION: Why did he open it?
MB, RUSS:

Curiosity, Justice Marshall, X assume.

There vas no legal justification for it,
QUESTION:

Is it normal to arrest a man for driving

without a license and put him under arrest in Florida?
HR, RUSS:

1 think it's normal to arrest in the —

QUESTION: Do yon think or do you knew?
MR. RUSS:

I don't know specifically.

QUESTION: Well, that gats hack to my question.

I

understood there was no question whatsoever in this case,
the way you’re arguing it, as to the constitutional validity
of the arrest,
MR. RUSS: There is no question —
QUESTION:

Normal or abnormal, that you do not

question its validity.
MR, RUSS: That’s right.

Because the State law of

Florida states that it’s an offense to drive without a
valid driver’s license in your possession.
incoate offense.

It’s sort of an

There’s a back door to this thing, that if

you appear in court with your valid driver's license at ft
later date, then the whole matter is dismissed.
QUESTION:

Right.
Was the automobile a Florida licensed

automobile?

Yes.
Justice Powell, it had a New York license

on it.

problem with that.
MR. RUSSs

I have a

Can you help me?
Justice Marshall, I have problems with it,

too, but ~~
QUESTION:

Well, why do you admit it?

MR. RUSS: Well, because we think that the key issue
in this case for this Court’s consideration is the matter of
the scope of the search.
QUESTION: Well, you want to win it in one way only.
MR. RUSS:

No, we want to win it one way or

another.
QUESTION: Well, whatever our problems might be, and
I confess I share in my brother Marshall's problems, I under­
stand that’s just simply not in this case.
MR. RUSS:

Yes, sir

Is thac right?

3

QUESTION? That's what I thought.
ME. RUSS:

Yes, sir.

The issue in this case, as we see it, is:

Is the

scope and the intensity of a custodial body search, which is
made incidental to a warrantless arrest for an evidenceless
minor traffic offense, limited by the reasonableness clause
of the Fourth Amendment?
QUESTION:

If the action by the police officer had

been confined to a Terry type pat-down, would you have —
would you be here this morning?
MR. RUSS:

Mo, sir.

QUESTION: So you draw the distinction between the
search and the pat-down?
MR. RUSS:

Yes, sir.

And we’re complaining

essentially about the search, the body search, the going into
the man’s pocket and the talcing out of the cigarette box,
and the opening of the cigarette box.
QUESTION:

Well now, are they separate things?

2s the opening the cigarette box, in your submission, a
different — create a different problem than going into his
pocket and taking the box —

MR. RUSS:

No.

No.

As far as we're concerned,

the constitutional wrong in this set of circumstances occurred
when the police officer put his hand into the man's pocket
and took out the cigarette box.

9

QUESTION: And you don't argue that even if that were
all right, opening the cigarette box was improper?
MR. RUSS: Well, that's just a further compounding of
the wrong; yes, sir.
But our essential complaint is the going into the
pocket, the body .search,
QUESTION:

Could he have done that under a Terry

search, under the Terry case?
MR. RUSS:
so.

No, Mr, Chief Justice, we don’t believe

We say that -—
QUESTION:

If he found, on feeling the man's pocket

from the outside, that there was a substantial package in
there that was firm, do you say he could not go into that
pocket under the Terry case?
ME. RUSS: Well, we say that under the Terry case,
ha has to have a reasonable belief that what ho feels is
of such substance that it could qualify as a weapon.
QUESTION: Do you think this package could have
conceivably qualified as a weapon?
MR. RUSS:

No,

33.r.

We do not.

QUESTION: Was it a soft Benson & Hedges package?
MR. RUSS:

It was a box, as I understand it,

Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

Well, I mean a hard box or a —

MR. RUSS:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

10
QUESTION?

If — I suppose you1d be making the

same argument if this defendant had been arrested in his homo
for stealing television sets, and assume there's a valid
arrest for that.

They had probable cause, they went into

the house and properly arrested the man.

And then took a

Benson & Hedges box out of his pocket and looked in it*
MR. RUSS: Well, not necessarily, Justice White.
It’s our essential contention, as regards the search for
evidence, that it is proper for the police officer, incident
to a lawful arrest, to search for the fruits, instrumentalities
and evidence of the offense, upon which the arrest was made.
QUESTION;

But you don't find the fruits of it in

a Benson & Hedges box, if it's a television set, do you?
MR. RUSS:

No.

But we don't know what the

circumstances of your hypothetical theft is.

It could be —

there could have been a screwdriver that was associated with
the break-in, there could have been an invoice associated
with the television,
QUESTION: Wall, on that basis, there could be a
driver's license in a cigarette box, if you're going to argue
like that.
MR. RUSS: But he wasn't charged with having a driver's
license, he was charged with not having a driver's license.
QUESTION: Well, I know,but he may not have — ha
may have lied about his identity.

You could have found any-

IX
thing in it, in a cigarette box.
MR. RUSS; Well, we submit that under the Fourth
amendment —~
QUESTION: Something about the car, the ownership
of the car, it could be anytbinq,
MR. RUSS: We submit, under the Fourth .amendment, that
the police officer doesn’t have the authority to search for
anything.

He has the authority, in a body search, to search

only for the fruits, instrumentalities and evidence related
to the offense upon which the arrest is based.
QUESTION: Well now, the officer obviously didn’t
know, did he, that this was a cigarette box, as he patted the
petitioner down?

He didn't know w’hat it was?

MR. RUSS: Well, he always referred to it in his sworn
testimony as being a cigarette box, Justice Brennan.
QUESTION:

I know.

After he took it out.

But did

he know, before he took it out, that it was a cigarette box?
MR. RUSS:

I don’t know.

QUESTION: Did he testify as to that?
MR. RUSS: The specific question was never asked him.
QUESTION: Because you do concede, I gather, that the
pat-down was proper.
MR. RUSS:

Ye3, sir.

We concede, and part of our

submission is that in such a situation, where you have an
arrest for, like our case, a minor traffic offense, where

there is no evidence involved with the offense, there are
:i© fmits, there are no instrumentalities associated with the
offense, that it is still proper, under an extension of
Terry, for the. arresting officer, for his own self protection
and to obviate the problems of potential ©scape, to pat down,
in a Terry type frisk, the arrestee prior to putting him into
the police car, or taking him into custody.
QUESTION: Well, this gets back to the Chief
Justice's question, then, I gather, under your submission.
If it had been of a different form, if it had been shaped
like a gun or something like that, even though it turned out
not to be a gun but a screwdriver.
MR. RUSS:

Let's say it was a Peters case, where the

arresting or the searching officer, the frisking officer felt
something hard and substantial in the man's pocket, and which
he thought might have been a knife.

In that case, this

Court held that that was proper for hixn to, after the frisk,
to go into his pocket and bring out what turned to be a
kind of a mini burglar tool set.
QUESTION;

Well, then your case must turn on that

-- when he patted this object inside his pocket, not knowing
what it was, it didn’t have the shape or form of something
that might be a ’weapon,* is that your point?
MR. RUSS;
concession, is that.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

That’s our — our

QUESTIONj Then you have to say that under no
conceivable stretch of imagination this hard package of the
Benson ft Hedges cigarette box could not have been a small
p0ck.et~s.t2ed automatic pistol, for example?
MR, RUSSs

Your Honor, as we read Terry and Sibrc-n

and Peters, it’s our understanding of those cases that this
doesn't give a wide-open subjective approach on the part of
the police officer, that he can't simply come to the trial
court after-wards and. say, "I intuitively, or believed that
it might possibly have been a weapon of one sort or
another"; that this is something that is subject to objective
evaluation.

Otherwise, the Terry frisk is really a wide open

authority to search in a —QUESTIONs Don't you have to get over another point,
though?

This isn't just a Terry type stop.

You concede this

was an arrest.
MR. RUSS:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And it’s a quastion of a search incident

to arrest, not a Terry oat-down.
MR. RUSS:
QUESTION:

Right.
You're already assuming that the only

thing a person can dof the officer can do is to do what he
does after a Terry stop.
MR. RUSS:

But here was a valid arrest.

Yes, sir.

The point is that there has

to be a reasonable relationship for the reasonable arrest —

weight on that at all?
MR. RUSS;

Justice Marshall, I don't attribute to

the police officer any legal authority to open the pac3<age
once he takes it out of the man's pocket.

I would say —

QUESTION: Well, why don't you make that point?
MR. RUSS:
QUESTION:
MR. RUSS:

As I answered Justice Brennan -~
Or are you giving that point up, too?
No, sir.

I'm simply saying that's a

compounding of the constitutional wrong that began when he
put his hand in his pocket.
QUESTION:

Yes.

I think you answered me earlier

that you don't argue independently of, as putting his hand
in the pocket, that opening the package, in and of itself,
was a Fourth Amendment violation.
You don't argue that?
MR. RUSS:
though.

No, I say that it alls in one package,

I'm not giving it away, I'm not conceding it.

I'm

saying that from the time that the officer put his hand in
the man’s left coat pocket, that the Fourth Amendment was
violated from that point on and thereafter.
QUESTION; Even if it was a gun?
MR. RUSS:

No.

No.

Because —

QUESTION: Then you're judging the search by its
fruits, are you not?

If it was a gun, it's all right; if i

heroin, it's not all right.

Is that it?

16
MR, RUSS:

No, Your Honor.

Let me go back over the theme again.

The point is

that on the frisk, if the police — our position is that if
the police officer frisked, under Terry, and felt what he
believed to be, objectively speaking, was a weapon, then he
had lawful authority in this minor traffic offense arrest to
search further, to remove the weapon from the man's
person, and to take control of it.
QUESTION: Suppose when he opened that Benson &
Hedges box, there was not a pistol, an automatic, as Justice
Marshall suggested, but a folding knife, a rather common
weapon that folds in three sections of about two and a half
inches each.

Would you say then, too, that the search was

not proper; unreasonable?
MR. RUSS: Well, I'm going back to the basic putting
his hand in the pocket.
QUESTION: Well, now he's got his hand out of the
pocket, we've got the box out, and he finds a weapon.

Do

'

you say that's an unreasonable search?
MR. RUSS:
able.

I say the opening of the box is unreason­

I say that taking the box out of his pocket was

unreasonable.

That there is no rational connection between

taking the box out of his pocket and the arrest for not
having adriver's license in his possession.
QUESTION:

How about? protecting himself against the

17
possible weapon that might be concealed in the box?
MR. RUSS:

Mr. Rehnquist, Justice Rehnquist, we

believe that unless there*s a rational objective showing
that when the officer feels on the frisk is a vreapon, or falls
in that category of an object that could be used to hurt: the
police officer or the arrestee, or to effectuate the escape,
that it becomes unreasonable for him to extend the frisk into
a body search,
QUESTION: The officer can't, then, just because he
uncovers an object that could contain a weapon, but that he
can't show in advance probably contains a weapon, he can't go
further into that, that object?
MR. RUSS:

That's our position, yes, sir.

Because

the answer to it is that if it’s left to the police
officer's own subjective interpretation that there might have
been a weapon in whatever this object is that he feels through
the outer clothing, rather than an objective standard, an
objective test, then every Terry frisk is going to develop
into a full body search.
QUESTION:

Mr. Russ, as I think ray brother White

has already pointed out, you're kind of assuming the answer
to the basic issue in this case, are you not?

The question is,

whether, when there's a lawful arrest, a lawful arrest,
perfectly constitutional, full arrest, whether, when the
offense is an offense such as this, the arresting officer

,

18
is limited to a Terry type search.

That’s the basic question,

isn’t it?
MR. RUSS:

Yes, sir.

That’s our contention, that he is.
QUESTION: Right.

And now, instead — but instead of

arguing that, you're rather arguing that you assume that
he’s limited to a Terry type search and now you're arguing
that a Terry type search would not permit taking that box
out of his pocket, which is a subsidiary and somexfhat
different question.

But the basic question is whether the

search is limited to a Terry type search, isn't it?
MR. RUSS:

Yes, sir.

It's our contention, of

course, that it is, that this is within the concept of
reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, that there must be
a rational connection between the reason for stopping and
apprehending the citizen and this invasion of his privacy.
QUESTION: Where do you keep razor blades, fcr
example?

I mean, if you’re going to have a Terry type stop,

you’re going to ask him a couple of questions for a few
moments.

It might be reasonable to say you could only pat

down for weapons that might be drawn and used on the officer,
which is like a gun or soraething, but if you're going to put
a man in a police car and take him to the station, and
things like that, shouldn't you be more careful about weapons
and evidence — what about a razor blade, for example?

19

MR, RUSS: Well, Justice White —
QUESTION:

You can keep one anywhere, can’t you?

MR, RUSS:

Yes.

QUESTION:

You may not be able to search for razor

If vre're going to —

blades in a Terry type stop, but can't you search for razor
blades if you arrest — make a valid arrest and put him in a
police car and take him to the station?
MR. RUSS:

If you're going to search for razor

blades, you're going to have to go right down to the very
seam of his garments,
QUESTION:

Well, all right.

Let's assume he gets to

the station, before they put him in a cell can they search his
pockets?

~
MR. RUSS:

Yes.

This is assuming — this is

assuming they put him in a cell.
QUESTION: All right.

But they get him to the

station and are going to book him, and they're going to take
a photograph of him, and can they ask him to empty his
pockets there?
MR. RUSS:

Not until such time as he goes from this

booking stage to being an actual prisoner in the jail.

And

of course he certainly has the option, as in this case, to
post bail right there at the station house.
QUESTION: Why can they make him empty his pockets
when they're going to put him in the jail, put him in the cell

20

MR. RUSS: V?ellf as a matter of protecting the
integrity of the whole jail system.
QUESTION: Because he might have a razor blade or
something like that, or some other what?
MR. RUSS: Some other weapon or some other
contraband of any type.
QUESTION: Some other weapon that you can't find
except by emptying the pockets.
QUESTION: Well, other reasons come into play before
a man is put in a cell.

They want to take his money out of

his packets, for instance, and there are various other
things, and make an inventory of it, for the protection of
his property and for the protection against false claims
against the police for taking hi# property, and so on.
There are all sorts of different grounds at the
police station.
QUESTION:

And his necktie and shoestrings.

But

that doesn’t have anything to do with a package of
cigarettes.

I mean, once he's got the razor blades in the

package of cigarettes, there’s no way the prisoner can use
those razor blades.
MR. RUSS:

Am I right?
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir,

QUESTION: Well, why open up the package and look for
them?
MR. RUSS: Well, we don't think it was necessary at

all to open the package, Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

On the other hand, if the policeman did

find razor blades in a package of cigarettes, it would put
him on the alert that he better do some more searching; is
that correct?
MR. RUSS:

Yes, sir.

That’s true.

QUESTION:

How was he going to do that?

QUESTION:

So there was a very good point under that

theory of opening up the package.
QUESTION:

But that’s not this case.

MR. RUSS: There were marijuana cigarettes in this
case.
But to answer Justice White’s question so far as the
booking at the jail, it doesn't absolutely follow that because
a man is arrested on the street, that he ends up in a jail
cell.

Particularly in this type of motor vehicle violation,

where, in the worst situation, as it occurred here, the ir.an;
was taken from the street to the police station, whereas, the
officer testified, bail was set in the amount of fifty dollars.
And under normal circumstances, he would have been released
upon the posting of that fifty dollars, and there never would
lave been any searching, there never would have been any
incarceration in a jail cell.
QUESTION:

Mr. Russ, what if the policeman, on

searching, does find something that seems like a revolver in a

22
man’s coat pocket, pulls it out and in the barrel of the
revolver finds two or three nickel packages of heroin.

May

he seize those and charge the man with possession of
heroin?
MR. RUSS: This is following a Terry frisk and —
QUESTION:

Right.

Following a frisk or search,

whatever you may call it, in the circumstances of your man.
MR. RUSS:

Yes, sir, I would concede that.

Our basic complaint is what followed after the
frisk, that there should not have been any further intrusion
into the man's privacy following the Terry frisk for weapons.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Richard.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY SCOTT RICHARD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RICHARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to add a couple of facts to the facts
as presented by the respondent.
At the outset, let me point out that the car was
driving back and forth between the driving lane and the
passing lane.

The defendants, the record reflects, looked

through the rearview mirror and upon seeing the police
officer took evasive driving tactics. They drove behind a
grocery store, and onto another street, in the opinion of the

23

officer, in an effort — in the uncontradicted testimony of
the officer, in an effort to evade him.

One of the points

that this Court was careful to point out in Sibron and Peters
is an important factor in determining whether or not there is
mens rea.

Not —• yes, sir?
QUESTION:

What, if any, traffic violation had he

committed?
Didn’t you stipulate that he hadn't committed any?
MR. RICHARD:

No, Your Honor. The police officer

indicated that at the time he saw that — there was
conflicting testimony.

At one point he said that at the

time of the weaving he didn't think there was a violation,
that he stopped him to determine whether or not he was
intoxicated.
violation.

At another point he said there may have been a
But there was no arrest for the weaving

violation.
He said he was stopping them to determine whether or
not they were intoxicated, when he saw the car weaving,
QUESTION: Well, would marijuana make him intoxicated?
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

It »>'ay, Your Honor.

Well, could it be that he was searching

him for the evidence of marijuana?
MR. RICHARD:

It may, Your Honor, and we are sub­

mitting —
QUESTION:

You say it may?

24
MR. RICHARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

We contend that in fact he had the right to do that.
We submit that he had the right to search, for two reasons:
one of them was for a weapon, and the second one was for
marijuana.
Ana, with the Court's permission, I'd like to delay
my response on that, so that I can deal with the questions
raised by the respondent.
Let me just rapidly point out several more facts
that have not yet been brought out, which I think are
important.
After attempting to evade the police officer, he
was stopped, and the police officer testified that he stopped
him in order to determine if he was intoxicated, because
the car had been weaving in this suspicious fashion. He
said that after the respondent left the car, it was his
impression that he was intoxicated, because of his actions
and because of his bleary eyes.
The officer said that it was his impression, from
observing him, that he was intoxicated.
Another point that I think it's important to note
— or let me answer some questions that were raised by the
Court regarding the facts.
the question:
convict him of?

Justice Marshal mentioned, asked

How can you arrest a man for a crime you can't

25

I think it's important to note that he can be
convicted of not having a driver's license.

The police

officer had no way of knowing, at the time of the arrest,
whether or not the man had the driver's license. It’s true
that if the man had it and simply did not have it in his
possession, that Florida does not convict.

But the officer

doesn't know that until the man arrives in court.
QUESTION:

Is it usual in Florida to arrest the

person for a traffic violation?
MR. RICHARD:

Your Honor, the officer testified that

approximately three or four —
QUESTION:

I'm not asking what the officer said.

You're speaking for the State of Florida.

I’m asking what

the law is.
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

Your Honor, —

Is it normal in Florida to arrest a person

for a traffic violation?
MR. RICHARD:

I don't know the answer in terms of

the factual statistics, Your Honor.

It is permissible in

Florida, it is lawful to arrest them for that purpose.
And I would suggest. Your Honor, that where the
driver has an out-of~State license tag on his car, that it's
not unreasonable for the officer to do that.
QUESTION: But you can't quote me any Florida law or
regulation or anything, can you?

26

MR. RICHARD:

I can tell Your Honor that it is

legal in Florida for the officer to arrest.

The man has

committed a crime.
QUESTION: And you cite — what?
MR. RICHARD:

I don't know the statistical

frequency —
QUESTION:

Well,you can cite your opponent’s

brief among other things. That issue isn’t in this case, is
it?
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, it is not.

I think --

He concedes it's legal in Florida to do

it.
MR, RICHARD:

It is conceded.

Florida to arrest him.

It is legal in

It is a crime to drive in Florida*

I would imagine in most, if not all, States without a
driver's license.

And what's more, Your Honor, I would

submit a serious crime, when we consider the fact that more
people die —
QUESTION: Well, was ha arrested?

Was he handcuffed?

MR. RICHARD: The record does not reflect whether
or not he was handcuffed, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Well, I ask you again:

Is it normal in

Florida to handcuff a man when you arrest him?
(

MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

I would imagine it may be, or —
You imagine.

I give up.

27
MR, RICHARD:

Your Honor, I must concede to the

Court that I don't have a statistical analysis of the frequency
with which police officers arrest or handcuff.

I think that

the —QUESTION:

I don't think that's involved here.

It

doesn't bother me that you don't have that statistic.
QUESTION: Well, it bothers me.
MR. RICHARD:

If I might move on, Your Honor, so I

don't get hung up on something I don't knot*?, and go on to the
things that I definitely do know.
Let me point out, as I said, that we are submitting
two things here. Your Honor:

that the search was reasonable,

first for a weapon, and second for the marijuana.
With regard to the search for a weapon, it was
pointed out by Justice White, and I think this is a critical
point, that we are not dealing here with the Terry-SibronPeters situation.

I think that that's critical.

Terry-Sibron

established a whole new concept, and a delicate one.

It was

an arrest without — or, rather, a search without probable
cause.

It was a search without an arrest.

Court has never before permitted,

Something this

And the Court felt

compelled to create some serious restrictions upon this
delicate new area, and we concede that point.
But here we’re dealing with something that the Court
has traditionally permitted:

search incident to a concededly

28

lawful arrest.

And that’s an importent distinction.

I would also point out, Your Honors, that there is
a distinction here between the facts, not only dealing with
the question of whether or not there was a lawful arrest, but
what the officer was doing.

In the Terry-5ibron situation,

the officers were dealing at arm’s-length on the street for
a brief, momentary questioning period with men who they had
the opportunity to completely concentrate on.
Here, Your Honors, we’re dealing with an officer
about to place a man in the back seat of a police car, to
concentrate on his driving and taking him under arrest to
the station.
I'd also point out, Your Honors, Justice Marshall
asked whether there was any fear on the part of the officer.
The important point, I think, here is that — and this is a
point which is raised continually in the argument of the
respondent — the important point is not the nature, the
purpose of the arrest, but the fact of the arrest.
QUESTION:

In other words, you suggest this is no

different than had the officer seen this petitioner holding
someone up and arrested him for attempted armed robbery?
MR. RICHARD: Well, I would suggest, Your Honor, it
is certainly different.
QUESTION:

Well, it may be different in kind, but

you're suggesting, in respect of the legality of the search

29

incident to the arrest, it's no different.

That's what you're

saying, isn't it?
%

MR. RICHARDs That's right. Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Just so long as there's a proper arrest,

whatever may be the offense, —
MR. RICHARD: Absolutely.
QUESTION:

— then this kind of search is permissible.

That's what you're saying.
MR, RICHARD;

Absolutely.

And I think the reason it

must be is that the officer who arrests that man for driving
without a license has no way of knowing whether that same man
has committed five robberies before the arrest, and, hence,
doesn't want to be arrested.
The important point here is that he is being
arrested, and there's no way of knowing how dangerous the
man being arrested is and what completely unforeseeable
reasons he may have —
QUESTION;
irrelevant.

I was told that your argument is quite

As long as he is making a lawful arrest, then

this is a lawful incidental search, without a warrant?
MR, RICHARD;
QUESTION;

I agree, Your Honor.

All right.

Whether he's afraid or not

afraid.
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION;

I agree, Your Honor.

Is that your position?

30

MR. RICHARD:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Don't say you agree.
That's my view of it.

I don't suggest it.

That's your position.

[Laughter.]
QUESTION:

Just say "yes" in answer to his question.

MR, RICHARD:
to say:

Perhaps it would be more appropriate

Yes, Your Honor, I hope the Court agrees,
QUESTION:

That's right.

MR, RICHARD:

I think perhaps the reason —

QUESTION: And the point is that if an officer were
arresting somebody whom he saw, as an eyewitness, holding
another person up and searched him, the same claim could be
made that no search of that person could adduce any additional
evidence of the holdup.

Isn’t that correct?

I mean —

MR. RICHARD: Yes, sir, that is our position,
QUESTION: The same argument could be made against
you, that search would have to be a limited one because
nothing that could be found in that person's pockets could
give any additional evidence of that particular holdup that
the officer saw.
MR. RICHARD: Well, Your Honor, this goes to the
other issue, which is the search for evidence as opposed to
the search for weapons, which I'd like to get to in just a
moment, if I can dvfeli on this for one more moment.
I wanted to point out that the reason this concerns

31
me is that the respondent dwells upon the fact that there was
no fear here on the part of the officer being injured, and
that this was a minor traffic violation.

And of course this

Court — what he’s asking this Court to do, I think, clearly,
is impose, for the first time, upon search incident to arrest
the new restrictions which the Court created in Sibron and
Peters and Terry.
QUESTION*

Yes, but in your brief you're rather

making the same argument, it seems to me, and you suggested it
in your oral argument, i.e», that this particular search may
*

have been justified because he thought the man was drunk.
MR. RICHARD: That’s an additional reason, Your
Honor, that I think —
QUESTION:

I thought your argument was, and

constitutionally ought to be, that, just as Justice Sremian
has outlined it, that when there is a constitutionally valid
arrest there can be a complete search, period, regardless of
what the arrest is for.
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION;

I think that’s true, Your Honor*
That is, if there' s" an - arrest. of a man

to take him down to the station house in a police car.
MR. RICHARD: That is precisely what we're arguing,
and I would agree —
QUESTION: Would that go for spitting on the sidewalk?
MR. RICHARD: Well, Your Honor, I think the important

32

point here is that the Court, the fear that Your Honor raises,
is that the officer will use the arrest as a ruse to search
or to harass.
QUESTION:

I didn't say a thing about that, I said

would that allow me, if a policeman says I spit on the
sidewalk, he can walk up to me, arrest me and search me?
MR. RICHARD:

If, Your Honor, there was a valid

statute and it were lawful to arrest for spitting on the
sidewalk, and the officer lawfully arrested the person and
placed him in the squad car to take him to the station, I
think it would be perfectly reasonable, Your Honor.
I think the significance —
QUESTION: Well, what protection do I have?
MR. RICHARD:

You need not spit on the sidewalk, for

one thing, Your Honor,
QUESTION: Well, I didn't say I spit, I 3aid I was
arrested for spitting.
MR. RICHARD: Well, of course, —
QUESTION: There's a difference, you know.
[Laughter.]
MR. RICHARD: Well, again — then. Your Honor, I
think what Your Honor is saying is that you fear that the
officer will use an alleged violation as a ruse to search,
and my response is that the courts have the obligation to
determine that factor.

And, as a matter of fact, the Florida

33

Supreme Court in this case cited several cases in -which the
State of Florida has overturned convictions, based upon the
fact that they found that the arrest was a ruse, and that in
fact there was no good-faith, lawful arrest.
QUESTION:

I read that.

MR, RICHARD: And I think, Your Honor, that this is
the obligation of the courts to determine, and when they
determine this, that —
QUESTION: Well, why do you ask for such a broad
general rule?

You don't need to.

MR. RICHARD:

Your Honor, I think —

QUESTION: Do you?
MR. RICHARD:

I'm not asking for a rule any

broader than the Court has laid down before, and the reason
I think we need to is because —
QUESTION; Well, which one did this Court lay down
that applied to spitting on the sidewalk?

I can give it to

the other one, Shuffling Sam, which was a different case,
MR. RICHARD; Admittedly, Your Honor, I know of no
instance in which the Court has addressed itself to the
question of driving without a license, but I —
QUESTION;

But we did address it to disorderly

conduct.
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION;

I think, Your Honor, —
It did involve search and seizure

34
MR. RICHARD:

I think, Your Honor, that ths Court

of course can go to the question of whether or not a crime is
too incidental to warrant an arrest,
QUESTION:

All right, to warrant,

you, but I don't want your time to run out.

I hate to press
I'm very

interested in your point about the search for evidence.
MR. RICHARD:

Okay, Your Honor, let me just

conclude ■—
QUESTION:
MR. RICHARD:

I think v?hat you're really —
—* with one sentence, then. That

being that I think the intent to discord in Terry and Sibron
and Peters was to give the police officer a broader flexibility
in protecting himself from hazards.

And I think if this

Court were now to impose the restrictions in Terry and Sibron
and Peters on the search incident to arrest, the over-all
result would be precisely the opposite. The officer would be
faced with a much more hazardous situation than he ever had
prior to Terry and Sibron.

And I think a situation which

certainly is not warranted by the statistics which this
Court cited in those cases and in the Adams case regarding
assaults on police officers, particularly when they approach
automobiles.
Your Honors, if I might then move on to the second
point in our argument and again I think it not necessary,
since I think that first point sufficiently justifies the

35

search in itself.
But if I might move on to the second one*

We think,

in addition, that the officer here was entitled to search
for intoxicants.

And I would remind the Court again,

respectfully, that the record clearly reflects, by
uncontradicted testimony, that the officer saw the defendants,
saw the respondents weaving back and forth on the highway at
2:00 a.ra. in the morning, that upon his approach behind them
they attempted to evade him by leaving the highway, driving
behind an alley in the back of a grocery store to another
street.

And that when the respondent left his car, he

was, in the impression of the officer, intoxicated, blearyeyed; and, by other actions, intoxicated.
These factors have been traditionally upheld as
sufficient probable cause to arrest for intoxication*

I think

that it's important here to note something that the Florida
Supreme Court said.

They said that, "In today's proliferation

of illegal drug use which affects the faculties, checking only
for liquors is no longer adequate,"
And I would suggest, Your Honors, that that point is
well taken, particularly where the officer smelled no alcohol,
ha had the right to attempt to find other intoxicants,
including marijuana, and there's no place more reasonable
to search for marijuana cigarettes than in a cigarette box.
We're dealing here with a serious hazard on the

36

streets of the city, and I know of no way, Your Honors, in
which a police officer — and I would point out that in all
of the recent cases, Adams and Terry and Slbron and Peters,
this Court has reflected its concern for the —
QUESTIONS

But the difficulty with this argument

is that he was not arrested for intoxication, whatever may have
been the cause.

He was arrested only for not having a

driver's license.

So this then again, doesn't it, has to

turn on the scope of the search incident to a lav/ful
arrest, whatever reason he may have been arrested, as long
as the arrest was lawful.
MR. RICHARD: The critical point, Your Honor, I think
is that there was probable cause to arrest him for
intoxication.

And I think Justice Harlan made an excellent

point in Peters in this regard, Your Honors, when he
pointed —
QUESTION:

I know, but we're not — we're not —

MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

He said ~
We're concerned here, as I understood it,

with a search incident, it's claimed and indeed conceded, to
a lawful arrest, namely, an arrest for not having a driver's
license.
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

Yes, but —

Isn't that what this case is?

what we have to decide?

Isn't that

MR. RICHARD:
That’s the first thing.

Well, I think two thingsf Your Honor.
And I think that the State ought to

prevail on that. But the second point, which was made in
Peters in the concurring opinion, was that it doesn't matter
whether he in fact makes the arrest before he searches, so
long as there's probable cause to make the arrest.
Justice Harlan's point was that the man can’t be
heard to come before this Court and say "my conviction should
be reversed because he didn't arrest me before he searched
me, even though he arrested me afterwards, even though he
had probable cause to arrest me."
How, Your Honors, the same point exists here.
Assuming the probable cause existed to arrest for intoxica­
tion, and assuming that he searched based upon the probable
cause, even though he may have used the more expedient route
of arresting for not having a driver's license, he didn't
have to re-arrest the man for another crime, he was already
arrested.
The important point here is not whether or not he
arrested him for two things, but whether or not be arrested
him, whether or not he had probable cause to arrest him for
intoxication.
QUESTION:

You’re making this argument only if we

reject your broader argument, aren't you?
MR. RICHARD: Of course, Your Honor.

This argument

is unnecessary if the Court —
QUESTION: Right.
MR. RICHARD:

— never need get to this argument.

Of course Your Honors —
QUESTION:

Nov? you're inviting us to say that the

lav? is that the scope of the arrest depends upon the
particular evidence in a particular — in the particular
circumstances of when the, what the officer saw before he
arrested him.
MR. RICHARD:

I think, Your Honor, I'm really saying

that this is only an issue incident to this given case.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. RICHARD:

I think this Court has always

recognized that the question is not when the technical
arrest took place, but when the probable cause to arrest
existed, in exigent circumstances as here, where you can't
go for a warrant.

And I don't really think there's a

constitutional issue to be changed here.
All I'm saying to the Court is:

Should it disagree

with the State's position on the constitutional issue, —
QUESTION: Right.
MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

In any event, in this particular case, —•

MR. RICHARD:
QUESTION:

— the first issue, that —

In this given case, -—

— there was, yes.

39

MR. RICHARD:

— the conviction should be upheld.

For that reason.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION;

Then, with that conjecture, we don’t have

to reach the constitutional issue in the first question?
If you’re right on the second, we can sustain this conviction?
MR. RICHARD:

Yes, Your Honor, —

QUESTION:

Without reaching the constitutional

QUESTION;

There is still the constitutional issue,

question?

of course.
MR. RICHARD;

You would have to reach the constitu­

tional issue in the case, which has been taken in tandem,
where there was xio,concededly no basis for searching for
evidence.

And we would submit that even in that case the

search was reasonable for weapons,
And so the issue would have to be raised in one. of
these cases and met.
QUESTION:

You mean the next one?

MR. RICHARD;

Yes, sir.

Of course, if the issue is raised and met in the
next one, and if the Court agrees with our position, then it
need not go to the second issue in this given case.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. RICHARD;

Thank you.

40

MB. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER%

Thank yon, Mr. Richard.

Mr. Russ, you have about seven minutes left.
Let me begin with a question to you;

If, in the

circumstances of this stop-and-arrest, in feeling the pocket,
he had felt the same package and had withdrawn it and found
that it was a small flask, in which there was some vodka
or whiskey, let's assume vodka because he said he smelled no
whiskey here.

Would that probable vodka, flask of vodka

be admissible in evidence?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. RUSS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUSS:

Your Honor, my answer ■—

QUESTION:

On a weaving, driving while intoxicated

MR, RUSS:

In this specific case, I would say no,

charge?

Your Honor, because I respectfully disagree with the
attorney for the State of Florida as to what the record
shows in this case on thi3 question of intoxication.
Now, my reading of the record, and this intoxication
claim has been raised by the State of Florida for the first
time in its brief before this Court, after we've beers
through the intermediate Court of Appeals and the Florida
Supreme Court.

The record clearly shows that this police

officer’s attention was drawn to this automobile by the fact
that it weaved very slightly over a divider line three or

41
four times in the course of three-quarters of one block.
That he thereafter followed this car for another six blocks,
having already made the determination that he was going to
stop the car because of the weaving.

And everything he saw

about the man, the way he got out of the car, the way he
stood, the way he smelled,#the way he walked, the way he
conducted himself, objectively showed that the man was sober.
QUESTION: Well now, when ha found, if he found, in
my hypothetical question, this small flask of vodka, would
there not be some connection between the flask of vodka and
the weaving?

Or could not the courts find that there was

some connection between the two?
MR. RUSS:

I would say this, that under our fact

pattern here, that if he arrested the man for no driver’s
license, and then he had the Terry pat-down, he felt the
flask, if he could reasonably and objectively say "I earnestly
believed that that was a weapon of some sort that could be
used to hurt me or could be used to effectuate an escape,"
then I would concede that he could thereafter go into the
pocket and take out the flask.
Now, whether he could thereafter open it and determine
what was inside it, I would say no.

That he had satisfied

the element of self protection by going into the pocket and
removing what he honestly believed to be a weapon.
QUESTION: But do you concede that it would be

42

admissible in evidence against him?
MR. RUSS:

I do not concede that he would thereafter

have the constitutional authority to open the flask and
determine what was inside it, without a warrant.
QUESTION:

Well, what was he going to do with that

flask while this fellow is being tried, just impound it
somewhere and give it back to him?
MR. RUSS:

No, I think he could go to a magistrate

in a court and simply state "I have seen this man drive this
way, I've taken this from his pocket under a lawful frisk,
and I now ask for a court approval on a showing or probable
cause under oath to open it and inquire what its contents
are."
To just settle on this intoxication argument, .1
would reiterate by saying that throughout the testimcny of
the police officer it shows, both by his testimony and by
his actions — now, the fact that he didn't arrest him for
driving while intoxicated, the fact that he never searched
the automobile for any evidence of intoxicants, the fact
that he testified under oath that he didn't even have
enough evidence to charge him with the most minor of all
offenses, which was careless driving by weaving, belays the
argument now raised by the State of Florida that this search
can be justified under the theory of intoxication.
Thank you.
