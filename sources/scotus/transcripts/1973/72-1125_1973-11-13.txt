MR, CHIEF

BURGER;

We will hear argument next

in No. 72-1125, Aliae against Medrano.
Mr. York, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY F„ YORK ON BEHALF
OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, YORK;

Mr. chief Justice, and may it please the

Court, I would like to briefly summarize the facts of this case
and describe to the Court how the case got here in a very brief
fashion, and then to discuss the constitutionality of the
.statutes which are discussed and then

to discuss the inter­

vention question and the propriety of the Federal intervention
in this case.
In about June of 1966 intensive efforts began by the
AFL-CIO in TExas to organise and unionize the Farm Workers in
the Rio Grande Valley of southern Texas.

Those efforts were

marked by picketing and demonstrations which want on over a
period of about 13 months, from June or so of 1966 up until
approximately June of 1967.

During that period, the Texas

Rangers, five of whom are defendants in this case, who are
the only defendants who have appealed, were called in, first,
I believe the record will show, in about November of 1966 for
the purpose apparently

then of serving ten warrants on people

who had already been charged with committing the violation of
having a secondary strike by the local authorities.

The Rangers

3

cams in to serve those ten warrants.
Th® Rangers came into the area again in May of 1967
at the request of local officers and from that time until
the picketing ended in June of 1967, roughly six weeks or two
months period, the Rangers made several arrests in this area
of striking which covered a number of counties.

It covered a

larger number of strikers and picketars.
The arrests made by the defendant Rangers during this
approximately six-weeks or perhaps shorter period than that
totaled about 45, including 28 for mass picketing 'asider the
Texas statutes, 13 for unlawful assembly, and one for no driver's
license, on® for threatening the life of a Ranger, and one for
brandishing a weapon in a public place.
Other arrests vers mads —
QUESTION:

Can you tell us what type of a weapon?

HR. YORK:

I believe it's described as a rifle.

Mr.

Dimas, who is one of the plaintiffs in the case.
A total of, if I read th® record correctly, about
70 arrests of individuals v;era made over this 13~month period
by both the Rangers and the local law enforcement officials in
tills several-county area in which the mass operation of
organization was going on.
QUESTION:

How many arrests?

MR. YORK:

About 70, your Honor.

QUESTION:

They mad® mors arrests than that over the

That’s 70 individuals.

4
13-month, period, I am sure, various people.

But you mean 70

connected with this labor organizing activity?
MR, YORK;

Your Honor, I believe, as stated in the

appellees" brief, the total they come up with is about 60
arrests made in all counties during this entire dispute.
QUESTION;

You mean of anybody for anything?

MR, YORK;

That's my understanding, your Honor, and

I believe that's what the record shows.
QUESTION;

So that many of these arrests weren't at

all connected with the activity involved in this case?
llRo YORK;

Well, they were — of these 60 or 70 or

so arrests, they were all, with on® or two exceptions, the
driver's license and the brandishing a weapon, and so on,
involved tha statutes which are before this Court and which
ware before the three-judge court.
QUESTION;

They

ware arrests of people, were they

not, or have I got it all wrong, involved in this union
organizing activity.
MR. YORK;

Yes, sir, that's correct.

QUESTION;

You're not talking about the total arrests

in that county —MR. YORK;

Oh, I'm sorry.

QUESTION;

That was my question.

MR. YORK;

No, no.

the arrests that

No, sir.

We're not saying that that's all

there were ever in that county during this

5
13-month period.
QUESTION%

So all of these 60 to 70 arrests ware

connected with what is at issue in this case.
MR. YORK:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Mr. York.

MR. YORK;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Prom ray own glanc© at the appendix, I

developed the idea that as to Article 482, the section on
abusive language that the district court invalidated, none of
the individual plaintiffs in this case had bean prosecuted
under that particular section.
MR. YORK:

I believe that there were arrests under

that section, your Honor.
Your Honor, I am not certain I can answer that
question without referring to the record.
QUESTION:

I might say I share the same inquiry.

MR. YORK:

I will hope to touch that in rebuttal, if

I may, your Honor.
The arrests w® have talked about ended

at about

This period of 13 months or so was marked by

of vandalism, as the record shows, directed toward the

farm owners in the sense of finding sugar in gas tanks and
punctured tractor tires, stolen generators, and that kind of
thing.
The three-judge court found that the law officers,

6
including the Ranger defendants had acted unlawfully toward
the strikers by harassing them and intimidating them for the
purpose of ending the strike.
In June of 1967, State civil injunctive proceedings
ware filed in the Stats district court of Starr County, on© of ths
counties involved, in a case styled La Casita Farms v. AFL-CIO.
Organising Committee.
Farias

That injunction relating to La Casita

was granted by the court, in July of 1967, July 11, 1967,

enjoining all picketing against La Casita which was one of the
major employers in the area on the basis that the picketing
was shown to b© so intertwined with violence and disruption
that it passed any legitimate form of communication, so that
all picketing was enjoyed of La Casita Farms.
The union appealed the injunction to the Court of
Civil Appeals of Texas, and the trial court was affirmed.

involved in this casta.

That

And that, of course, is not

That is another injunction.

And that

is what we say that the record shows ended the strike in the
area, was the fact that there was a State injunction in June
of 1967.
In July of 1967 or thereabouts, the plaintiffs filed
this action with the result that the lower*and the three-judge

believe, in July of 1967.

The Texas Court of Civil Appeals

The record does not reflect that

there was any attempt mad® to appeal from that court by the
union to our Texas Supreme Court.

8
QUESTIONs

a
And that1 s/discretionary appeal, is it?

MR* YORK:

Yes, sir.

It may or may not ba taken,

but the record will reflect whether an attempt has been made
to talcs it.
Section 5154d of our statute involving mass picketing
is what I would like to address myself to at this time.
Texas is one, so far as our research has been able
to develop, of only three States, although perhaps more, who
have adopted a specific statute defining what mass picketing
is.

However, the equity courts of this land have recognized

for a long time that the concept of picketing, while it involves
speech, also involves conduct, and that the conduct side of it
may be regulated in the absence of statute.

So that the concept

of mass picketing, picketing which transcends the speech
elements of communication and moves into the conduct area, may
be regulated by the courts.

And a variety of cases in many

jurisdictions are cited in our brief in Hew York, in Hew Jersey,
and. in Ohio where the number of pickets has been specifically
an
limited by/equity court in an injunctive process.
QUESTION:

That would be in the circumstances of a

particular case, and after a shewing of violence, would it
not, or threatened violence growing out of the circumstances
in a particular case shown to a court of equity?
MR. YORK:

Yes, sir.

Although we would say, your

Honor, that it would not be limited to

violence.

It might

9

be and has been shown in a situation where there has been a
showing of simple blockage of the reasonable right to ingress
and egress, or other forms of conduct short of violence which
are thought to be violative of a valid state policy.
QUESTION;

How many other States did you say have a

statute such as this that makes it applicable to every kind of
situation involving a labor controversy?
MR. YORK;

Your Honor, if our research is correct,

the State of Nebraska has a statute vrtiich is almost identical
to the Texas statute, talking in terms of 50 feet.

It's almost

a twin of our Texas statute.
The State of South Dakota has a different sort of
statute which talks in terms of the number of pickstars being
limited to 5 parcent of the first 100 strikers and 1 percent
thereafter, I believe is the South Dakota schema.
The cases from other jurisdictions are numerous on
the point of injunctive relief on a case-by-case basis.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. YORK;

We are also aware of tills Court’s ruling

?

in the Vogt case in 1957 which establishes the principle that
picketing, even peaceful picketing, even clearly peaceful
picketing, may be regulated by the Stats, recognizing that a.
part of picketing is conduct if the picketing, as in the Vogt
case, has as its primary purpose the violation of a particular
state policy which is a valid state policy.

10

So fib's backdrop for regulation of picketing is found
both in the common law notions and in the various equity court
notions of injunction
case.

and in this Court's ruling in the Vogt

And what Texas has done is simply to adopt a statutory

scheme to in effect codify the doctrines that have been expressed
in the other courts of what mass picketing amounts to.
The Texas statute is limited to th® labor context.
We don't pretend, and the statute can't be read, we submit, to
apply to any other kind of picketing.

Indeed, th© AFL-CIO in

their amicus brief at page 2 concedes that it was aimed at labor
unions.

The preamble to the statute states clearly, when the

statute was passed in 1949, it was stated by the legislature
that it was a matter of public knowledge that picketing as
exercised by labor organizations is not used only as a means of
expression of ideas to -the public generally, but likewise is
a means of coercion through the presence of the picket line,
et cetera.

This is in the preamble to the statute.

The statute

by its terms is limited to picketing by organizations.
The statute has never been applied otherwise in Texas,
except in the labor picketing context.

It is located in the

labor section of our statutes and applies to nothing els®.
The court below, th® three-judge court, stated that
on© need only look at th® Davis v. Francois case out of the
Fifth Circuit to determine that our statute was unconstitutional.
But in th© Davis case, the Louisiana ordinance that was passed

11
said that you cannot have more than two pickets, period, the
end.
QUESTION:

Kqw was section 1 applied?

Two pickets —

that is in relation to picketing at entrances.
MR.YORK:
QUESTION s

Yes, sir.
Apparently pickets have to be at least

50 feet away from the entrance.
MR.

YORK:

Well, there can be no more than two pickets

within 50 feet.
QUESTIONs

And the pickets have to be 50 feet apart,

is that it?
MR. YORK:

There can be two pickets.

If you can

visualize the door, there can be two pickets at that door, but
there could be no mors than two within 50 feet of the door.
QUESTION:

May they be within 50 feet of one another?

MR. YORK:

Yes, sir.

QUESTIONs

Well, the two could be

That's correct.
(inaudible)

each other.
MR. YORK:

Right.

Two pickets may be less •—

QUESTION:

Right at the

entrance,

Two could b©

right at the entrance.
MR, YORK:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION s

The next two have to be at least 50 feet

QUESTIONs

That is what I was trying to gat at. Not that

away.

12
there may be only two pickets 50 feet apart,
They may walk in pairs.
MR* YORK:

It's not that.

The pairs have to be 50 feet apart.

Yes, sir.

That's correct.

You can envision a city block, if we assume it to be
300 feet on a side, 1200-foot perimeter.

It would depend

somewhat on where the doors are located, but the number of
pickets who might surround that block under our statute would
be somewhere between 40 and 50, or between 40 and 48.
The object, as we perceive it, of picketing is to
communicate.

And it’s impossible for us to see, under the

cases and under our statute, how there is any infringement on
the right to communicate under our statute.

There was no

evidence submitted, it is not ©van suggested in the brief or
in the record by the appellees that tJie.tr right to communicat©
'their dispute in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas was in any
fashion inhibited by this statute.

Indeed, everybody in the

valley knew the dispute. And in the normal labor context, one
simple sign is enough to advise the public and advise other
unions, efc cetera, that there is a labor dispute going on
without there being further conduct of a harassing type.
The Farah brief, which is one of the amicus briefs
filed, indicates that their particular plant can have as many
as a hundred pickets around it and fall within the coverage
of the Texas statute, and you can conceive of plants that might
have hundreds of pickets around them and still be entirely

13
legal within the meaning of the Texas statute.
QUESTION;

Then a business that had only a 49-foot

frontages,, could only have two pickets.
MR» YORK?

I don’t think, your Honor, that it would

be limited to frontage.

If the building were 49 feet around,

it might well b® limited to two pickets for that building.
QUESTIONS

Well, this is a building in a whole line

of buildings going down the street, and this one has got 49
feet, that's all that’s available.

It could only have two

pickets.
MR. YORK s

I think in that case that it would be

limited to two pickets.
The obstruction portion of the statute —- the statute
has two parts. One is to describe mass picketing in tarns of
the 50-feet rule.

The second part is to talk in terms of

forming an obstacle to free ingress and egress from any
entrance either by obstructing said free egress and ingress
by parson or by placing a vehicle or other obstruction there.
Our Texas court in the Gsissler case, which is
mentioned both in th© three-judge court opinion and in our
brief, held that the obstruction talked about meant only a
physical obstruction, not any other kind of obstruction.

It

was suggested in the Gedssler case, for instance, that the
holding of a particular type sign or flag might well keep
people out, and th® court said, no, that won't gat it.

It has

14
to be a physical obstruction.

The fact that soma people choose

not to cross a picket line is just one of the accepted perils
of

picketing.

We are not going to enjoin that.

The Cameron v. Johnson, which Hr, Justice Brennan
lately approved a Mississippi statute, we say, is totaly
dispositive of our case.

The Mississippi statute talked about

picketing in such a manner as to obstruct or unreasonably
interfere with free ingress and egress.
tive.

That is, it is "or.”

It is in the subjunc­

So the Mississippi statute can

be read to say that you may not obstruct free ingrass and
egress.

Our statute says you may not obstruct free ingress

and egress..
The Court in Cameron stated that the term "obstruct"
plainly requires no guessing as to its meaning.

We agree.

The appellees here when they submitted their final
proposed revised judgment to the court below in this case
did not include the obstruction portion, the second portion
of 54d in their proposed findings of relief and did not in
that context ask the court; below to find the obstruction
portion of 54d unconstitutional.
The three-judge court in a later part of its opinion
in finding Article 784 of our Texas statutesto be constitutional,
and that statute says whoever shall wilfully obstruct or injurs
or cause to be obstructed could there construe the word
"obstruct" to mean actual prevention or substantial interference

15
with traffic.
QUESTION s
similar statute?

Cameron vJohnson, was that a very

That was an obstruction statute.

MR. YORK:

Yes, sir, that’s correct.

And we say that

when you read the Cameron statute side by side with ours and
read the meaning of th® word "obstruct" in it with ours, the
conclusion is inescapable that ours is all right undor Cameron v,
Johnson.
QUESTION?

Mr. York, (inaudible)

prevent the named

defendants, the appellants here, from going ahead with "the
.,.

criminal prosecution under the statute ...
MR, YORK:

Your Honor, I don't believe — my reading

of it is that it did not.

It may b® said there is some

disagreement.
QUESTION:

Looking at the jurisdictional statement,

page 101, paragraph 15 of the final judgment, the last few
lines over on page 101, they were enjoined from arresting,
from imprisoning, from filing criminal charges, from threatening
to arrest.

You say that could be because it doesn't use the

word "prosecute", the

...

were free to go ahead and

prosecute?
MR.

YORK;

Wall, we would not suggest that to the

state officials, your Honor, and wouldn't suggest that be done
under the terms of this judgment.

As a matter of fact, I

don't believe prosecutions have been followed because of this

16
case.
QUESTIONs
MR. YORK%

(Inaudible)
As a practical matter it has been so

treated, although I don't think you can read the precise
language of the judgment and find that in it.
QUESTION:

You have a narrow line to walk, though.

MR. YORKs

Yes, sir, extremely.

I would like to touch very briefly on the question
of equal protection under our 54d statute which applies to
labor organizations and does not by its terms apply to other
organizations.

We are aware of Mr, Justice Marshall's decisions

in Mosley and Grayned.

In Mosley, as the Court is aware, there

was a statute in Chicago which stated that there could be no
demonstrations around a public school within 150 feet of that
public school except -that labor disputes were not so enjoined
or so restricted.
This Court found that to be a violation of equal
protection clause.

We would submit, your Honors, that our

case differs from that in several important respects.

For on®,

the restriction that is imposed by our statute as it intersects
with. First Amendment rights is a valid and legal restriction.
I think the Court, even though it decided in Mosley on equal
protection grounds, seemed to have in its mind somewhat the
concept that it was difficult; or shouldn't perhaps be allowed
to enjoin the kind of public issue picketing that was prohibited

17
by the statute in the Chicago case, Mosley, case.
Ours, as w© have stated before, is a reasonable
restriction on those rights.

The other and perhaps more

important restriction, I think, is that in Mosley the Court
was confronted with a situation where of the entire universe
of picketing, a small area, that is labor picketing, had been,
singled out and not regulated.

The rest of the universe had

been assumed to be bad and regulated by the statute.
situation we have the flip-flop of that.

In our

We have the entire

universe picketing all unregulated by our statute except the
narrow portion of labor picketing, which is regulated for the
reason set out in. the preamble to our statute.

And we say

that in that sense we have made a reasonable classification
and that the equal protection statements made in the Moslay
case do not apply to this case.
Additionally in that regard, we would mention to the
Court that there was no suggestion made or proof made of any
arbitrariness in this statute by the plaintiffs as they triad
the case.
I would like, if I may, to reserve a few minutes for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
Mr. Dixie.

Vary well.

ORGAL ARGUMENT OF CHRIS DIXIE ON BEHALF
OF THE APPELLEES
ME. DIXIEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

please, we made it clear to the district court and we filed
several briefs in which we stated that we do not intend to
interdict any pending criminal prosecution.

One of our

observations in this case has been so many arrests and rot one
case set for trial.

As far as we are concerned under this

order, these criminal cases could be tried, other criminal
cases could be filed under the statutes.

Any State official

other than the named defendants and those acting in concert
with them and successors in office can prosecute under these
statutes.
QUESTION;

What about enforcing the injunction

entered in 1967?
MR, DIXIE;

That injunction runs against five Texas

Rangers and five peace officers down there.
QUESTION;
MR. DIXIE;
QUESTION;
MR. DIXIE;

Were arty of them defendants in this suit?
Yes, sir, that’s who the defendants were.
How about enforcing that 1967 injunction?
The ’67 injunction, what are you referring

to, the State court injunction?
QUESTION:
MR. DIXIE;
til at.

Yes.
I have a little correction to give you on

Counsel was not with us on the ground or in the trial

19

court.

That state court injunction was an application for

temporary injunction which alleged that fell© picketing was
illegal for many reasons and the trial court granted that
injunction.
The Court of Civil Appeals reversed that and said
that picketing was legal in all respects insofar as its purposes
was concerned.

But they said there is soma circumstantial

evidence of destruction of property, dropping of nails, putting
gasoline in tanks, and so forth, and we will hold -that that
circumstantial evidence was sufficient to justify a temporary
injunction only and we express no opinion as to what will ba
the situation when the case comes forward on the merits.
QUESTIONi
MR. DIXIE:
QUESTION:

Is that where the case sits now?
That’s right.
It has never coma forward?

It's still

temporary injunction?
MR. DIXIE:

That’s right.

And it took the Texas

courts
QUESTION:
MR. DIXIE:

And the case is still pending.
That's right.

And it took the Texas

courts about three years to settle the question of a temporary
injunction.
QUESTION:

plaintiffs here?
MR. DIXIE:

20
The United Farm. Workers Organizing Committee,
QUESTION?

Mr. Dixie, in paragraph IS of the final

decree on page 101 of the jurisdictional statement, the
injunction does cover imprisoning.

Would a proper construction

of that be that although you could prosecute, you couldn't
imprison somebody?

Or would that just mean imprisoning prior

to filing of charges?
MR, DIXIE;

Your Honor, a proper construction of

that, I believe, would be that these particular officers
should not arrest people and put them in jail under these
particular statutes.

But it doesn't say 'that ‘the county

attorney or -the district attorney or the Attorney General
can't file charges and causa a warrant to issue and arrest
somebody and prosecute him all the way through, a very limited
injunction, because the essence of this case is the abuse of
the police power in the manipulation of these statutes by these
people who the findings of fact established were acting in
active concert, with the private owners to break the strike
through a period of one

year.

We were attempting to get

relief from these wholesale arrests and mistreatments that w©
were subjected to.

tod then, as far as litigation was concerned,

we were and are prepared to defend ourselves any time that these
things are set for trial.
QUESTION;

Yet the district court, certainly the

thrust of its opinion isn't that the valid statutes were being

21

abused in violation of your clients' constitutional rights,
i

but. that the statutes themselves were invalid.
MR. DIXIEs
QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, they held that,

Furthermore, I wouldn't think that the

fact that they didn't enjoin any pending criminal prosecutions
would avoid the thrust of the Younger cases, where it seems
to ms that the court went ahead and at least declared these
statutes unconstitutional when at least with respect to soma
of these statutes there were pending State criminal prosecutions.
MR. DIXIE:
QUESTION?
MR. DIXIE:

Yes.

Yes,

What have you got to say about that?
Well, we took the bull by the horns and

we say that, we are well within the doctrine of the Younger
cases.

As a matter of fact, if this fact situation is not

strong enough to satisfy Younger, w© doubt that you will ever
find one.
QUESTION:

Would you say that th© harassment and

bad faith would have to exist with respect to each of these
statutes?
MR. DIXIE:

Well, your Honor, these statutes were

interwoven in their us®, and they were used -QUESTION:
MR. DIXIE:

Your answer apparently is no.
That's right.

That's right.

It's a

whole —
QUESTION:

You could just find a goneral pattern and

22

then pick out any statute you want and say there is bad faith
in its enforcement.
MR. DIXIE:
QUESTION:

Well, no.
That's what you did hers apparently,

because with respect to sora® of these statutes, concededly
there is no bad faith enforcement.
MR. DIXIE:
QUESTION:

Oh, no, with respect to —
Then you say with respect to each. one.

MR. DIXIE:
QUESTION:
MR.

That's right.
And you must show that.

DIXIE:

That's right.

With respect to each one

there was bad faith -~
QUESTION:

That's the problem with the record, then,

seeing that you satisfied -that.
MR. DIXIE:
QUESTION:

That's right.
I gather, looking at page 50 of the

jurisdictional statement, you have explicit finding by the
three-judge court that, all of those prosecutions under each
of these statutes rested in bad faith and for the purpose of
harassment.

It didn't work that way.

As a matter of

fact, th@3@ arrests built up to a crescendo, arid that's
probably one. thing I should explain to you.

On May 11, the

union developed important support on the Mexican side and the
situation developed that the Mexican farm workers were not
coming across the bridge to work through these picket lines.
On. that day at 4 o'clock in the morning Captain Alls©, the
Texas Ranger, got up out of bed and drove on© or two hundred
miles forthwith to the scans.

Then there started a series of

arrests interspersed with brutality, beatings, terrorism, the

they also found that in the entire year, the only case of
physical violence was vrhen one of our people reached and touched
the arm of a truck driver as he passed by, taking him by the
sleeve, and the sleeve of course slipped out of the man's hand
and the truck went on.

And the district court explicitly found

that that was the only case of physical violence on the part of
any union adherent during the year.
Now, to go to your other qu@3t.ion, your Honor.

Down

in south Texas you get about four crops a year, and there is
a planting time, and there is a harvesting time.

And these rash

'That’s when the

That's when th© union would make its

effort to organise, and that's when the arrests would take
place.
So the arrests were well timed to counteract the
potential effectiveness of the strike.
Now, to move on, this case was filed as a class
action by the union and by several individuals, and the court
found that it was a proper class action by these people, and
they are adequate representatives of the class, and there has
naver been any question in the district court from the
defendant about the propriety of that.
The fact findings recite that there was a one-year
conspiracy of arrests without charges, dispersants, threats,
bonding abuses, inducements by peace officers to the strikers
to abandon the union and go back to work, and physical violence.
All of it was’ mixed up with and interspersed with the institu­

And part of the injunction is civil rights relief

under 1983 and 1985 on account of the conspiracy of these
public officers to abuse the color of their officers.

I would like to tell the Court something about the
legal background of this case.

Texas law provides in a statute

cited in our brief that any person may try to induce any other
parson to quit any employment and join the union for the
purpose of bettering their conditions.

Taxas law gives the

right to bargain collectively or individually.

It provides

that if a labor contract is signed, the contract is lawful and
may not ba violated.
Taft-Harfeley Act.

That is similar to section 301 of the

So that everything that the plaintiffs did

in this case in terms of their ultimate objective was lawful
under the Texas statute, and the Attorney General stipulated
as much at the trial of the case.
So in all of the application of the statutes, please

23
bear in mind, your Honors, that at no time were we doing any­
thing prohibited by Texas law.
Not , Texas

may refuse.

He my contract with it or he

He may contract for all of them or some of them

or one of them.

.And if he doesn't want the union, he has got

a. right to fight.

In this case the employers did elect to

take to the economic contest.

And so the situation in this

case is that the union was doing precisely what the State law
contemplates that you have to do in that situation.

There is

no question of the union's violation of the ultimate public
policy.
Now, the economic background of this situation is
that Starr County, Texas, according to the Census figures, is
one of the poorest in the United States.

The economic condition

of this county and these farm workers is the lowest in Texas,
substan.-tia.lly lower than our black population which God knows
is low enough.

The growers operate large farms, hundreds of

acres, vast fields.

We have pictures in here to show you.

And by stipulation, it is developed that they haul in the
agricultural workers by busloads from far distances.

Thera is

no such thing in this case as a congested traffic situation.
Everything takes place on the open road or out in tee woods.
And it is in that context that this Court is going to have to
evaluate the application of the 50-foot law by the State of

29

Texas.
We have brought cases, hers where the Texas Rangers
v/ent out during the harvesting season in May, and they had
three pickets out in the woods on the side of the field who
were calling to the workers to con® out.

Those three were

arrested for mass picketing! there was more than two.

Then

there were ten other Mexican-Americans under the shade of a
tree on 'that hot day, and the evidence shows that the Ranger
captain says, "Run them in, too, for mass picketing."

QUESTION s

Then your answer to me is you are

30

defending the judgment, both that facially the statutas are
unconstitutional and

if you are wrong about that, nevertheless,

we ought to find that as applied, they are unconstitutional.
MR. DIXIEs

That is correct.

Now, then, this 50-foot statute, you have got no
traffic problem.

They apply it without reference to

obstruction, and they say that in every situation two every
50 feet is enough.
Now, let’s look at the position of the union and
the members in this case.

They are trying to induce hundreds

of farm workers to join them, and the State wants to have two
pathetic-looking pickets out there in an economic contest where
economic power is going to settle the issue, and the State
says that that’s constitutionally sufficient.
Why, any politician knows that when you have a rally
and you have a good attendance, that makes you look like a
winner and encourages people to support you and join with you
and believe in your cause.

The whole purpose of this statute

-- not the whole purpose, but the whole defect of tills statuta,
is to make the union look pathetic in a state-mandated economic
contest where they violate no public policy when they are
trying to get the others to join them.

Incidentally, this statute prohibits observers,

position to do that?
MR, DIXIE:

Well, that's a question of your judgment

in judicial administration, and you might wish to remand the
case in that

situation.

However, the facial unconstitutionality of these
statutes, other than the 50-foot statute seems to me to be
well demonstrated by practically white horse cases from this
Court, several of them within the last few terms, and partici­
pated in by the present personnel of the Court.

under the mass picketing statute on the criminal side of the
docket since that statute was passed in 1947, just these farm
workers.

In fact, I have been practicing at the Texas bar

35 years, and I have never known before this case one person
arrested for peaceful picketing.

to regulate the picketing, and even injunction to stop all

picketing which might be illegal.

I think that there is an important area for the

to you, that your efforts up on the bench and our efforts down

REBUTTAL ORGAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY F. YORK
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR, YORK:

Yes, your Honor, I would like just a few

moments,
I xtfould like to say in answer to Justice Rshnquist's
question earlier and Mr, Justice Blackmon's question, that we
find no indication that any of the named plaintiffs were ever
charged with violation under 483.

The United Farm Workers v.

La Casita was affirmed by the Texas Court of civil Appeals.
I would also like to suggest to the Court that the
preamble that we discussed earlier in my remarks is not, I
don't believe, in the briefs unless it appears
to 54d.

the preamble

It does appear in the official reported version of

the Texas statutes and is available there for the Court, but
I am not certain it's available in the briefs themselves.
W® believe that there has to be a showing of a
general pattern for each particular statute before the kind
of Federal court intervention talked of here is proper.

W@

don't believe that a pattern which just talks generally of
what happened under a lot of statutes is sufficient.

For

instance, under 54df the 50-foot and the obstruction statute,
the evidence is that there wore only about 25 arrests for that
in the

period spoken of by Mr, Dixie when the Rangers were

Arrests were made on a

couple of other occasions under circumstances which were
clearly violative of the Texas Act.

There is no statement

made in the briefs and in the record that there was any
violence that I am aware of that was attached to those arrests
under 54d.

And we say that there can’t be an injunction

whether the statutes be held constitutional under the theory
of saying perhaps that they might b® enjoined because there was
a bad faith prosecution with no reasonable hop© of conviction.
That’s clearly not the case here.

These statutes are facially

valid, particularly as we have discussed 54d in some detail
with the. Court.

We ask the Court to so find it, and to so

find it facially valid.
QUESTION:

Do you agree that we take the facts as

found by the district court here since the State of Texas
hasn’t challenged the fact finding?
MR. YORK:

Your Honor, we don’t agree with all of

some, of what we might call editorializing, but as far as
the findings of fact themselves, they were largely undisputed.
And we have no particular quarrel with the facts.
