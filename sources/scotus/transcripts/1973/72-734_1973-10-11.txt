PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments next in docket No. 72-73*1, United States of
America against John P. Calandra.
Mr. Claiborne, you may proceed when you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF
LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The facts in this case are simple and very few.
The reason they are very few is that the case was not
allowed to proceed through the Grand Jury stage.
A search warrant was issued supported by detailed
affidavit.which, however, was found insufficient by the
courts below and the insufficiency of whlch we do not
challenge in this Court.
Pursuant to that search warrant, federal agents
searched the business premise of the Respondent, looking for
gambling paraphernalia.

They found no gambling paraphernalia

to speak of, but they did come upon records which suggested
the Respondent's involvement in loan sharking activities.
These records they seized.
Some time later, a special Grand Jury itfas

4
approximately eight months after the original seizure, the
Respondent was called before the Grand Jury to testify,

lie

was asked questions which were prompted by the Government’s
knowledge gained from the records it had seized.
The Respondent refused to answer those questions,
invoking his privilege under the Fifth Amendment, the
privilege against self-incrimination.
Whereupon, the Government sought for him, and filed
an application with the Court, to grant him transactional
immunity.

Respondent asked for some delay, which was

granted, and then, rather than oppose the application for
immunity, asked the judge to grant a hearing to determine
the legality of the search and seizure, suppress the evidence
seized during that search and to forbid the Government from
asking any derivative questions.
Such a hearing was granted, and the order
requested was entered.

The Government appealed from that

ruling, to the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed the ruling of
the District Court.

Rehearing was denied.

A petition of

Certiorari was filed here and, in due course, granted.
how, the issue, as the case is presented in this
Court, is not the legality of the search or seizure.

The

Government has not brought that issue before the Court,

ilor

is it whether the order for the return of the seized records
was properly entered.

5
The only issue here is the propriety of the order
which forbids the Government from asking any questions of
this witness before the Grand Jury which are derived or
prompted by the knowledge gained
what must be treated in this

by the Government through

Court as an illegal search and

seizure, even though the Respondent has been granted
immunity and, therefore, cannot be harmed by the use of these
records or his testimony against others than himself, he
having been wholly immunized from prosecution on account of
this transaction.
Q

When you say "Wholly immunized from prosecution,"

are you suggesting that he was given something more than use
immunity?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes, transactional immunity.

We would make the same argument, I must say,
Mr. Justice Stewart.
Q

With or without immunity, or even if use immunity,

wouldn't you say?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
Q

Even if use immunity, yes.

And you would be here even without any immunity,

wouldn't you?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

We would, though we have two

arguments, one of which depends on the grant of use immunity
Q

Yes.

6
other of which does not.
Q

Right.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Nov;, at that stage, let me say

what those two arguments are.

The first and the broader one,

which, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggested, does not depend on
the immunized status of the Respondent, is simply the
proposition that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule,
including the fruit-of-the-polsonous-tree doctrine, has no
application to Grand Jury proceedings.
The second argument, and a narrow one, is answering
the question whether a witness who is not a prospective
defendant, especially one who has been immunized, can
properly object to the use against others — by definition,
only against others — of evidence illegally seized from him
or of testimony which would derive from an illegal seizure.
On the broader and first argument, we must be
careful not to be saying that personal privileges against
testifying have no application for Grand Juries.
not our position.

That is

We, of course, recognize that the Fifth

Amendment privilege, the lawyer-client privilege, the
doctor-patient privilege and any privilege immediately
derived from the Fourth Amendment would be applicable in
defending against either subpoenas or questions asked by
GRand Jurors.
We find it hard to imagine a case in which the

Fourth Amendment would present a proper defenses either to a
subpoena or, especially, to questions.

However, this Court

has held, in Hale versus Henkel, that a subpoena can be so
overbroad, so sweeping, that the Fourth Amendment stands as a
defenseWe have no quarrel with that proposition.

We are

simply saying that the prophylactic exclusionary rule ought
not be applicable in Grand Jury proceedings.
Q

What if he attempts, in this case, no defense to

a contempt proceeding at all?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

We don't have that situation, but

I think that would follow from our position.
The reason why we take this view, the non­
applicability of the exclusionary rule for Grand Juries, is
that it seems to us inconsistent with the proposition that
Grand Juries are entitled to all probity of evidence and are
entitled to get on with their business expeditiously.

To

allow proceedings on an exclusionary rule to be had before
a Grand Jury would deprive them of evidence which is
uncontrovertibly relevant to the case before you and it would
seriously interrupt their proceedings as this very case
now, finally,in this Court two years after the event, amply
demonstrates.
The hearing on a motion to suppress \tfould,

8
Jury and the only possible justification for it is the small
added deterrent effect that invoking the rule there as well
as a trial might have.
It seems to us that in the balance which must be
struck we ought not give way to the exclusionary rule.

We

ought not view the deterrent effect, small as it is, as
sufficient.

If the deterrent effect were always reason for

applying exclusionary rules, they would apply so as to bar
prosecution at all of any victim of a Fourth Amendment
violation.
They would apply as against nonvictims.
Here, it seems to us sufficient to have a return
of the property, which we don’t challenge, and, of course, to
allow the victim

to bring an action for damages against

those guilty.
We also point out that in this instance, we are
dealing with a warrant.

We are dealing with officers who

acted pursuant to a warrant in good faith, though the
affidavit supporting that warrant was ultimately found
insufficient.

It is hard to see the deterrent effect in a

situation such as this one.
We recognize some difficulty with the Silverthorne
case.

First, let me say that the Silverthorne case, of

course, does not apply, does not have any effect on our
second argument for there, there liras no immunized defendant.

9
Also, there was no interruption of the Grand Jury
proceedings, the

indictment having already been returned

before the subpoena was issued.
But, most important, while it wa3 a Grand Jury
subpoena that was held barred by the Fourth Amendment, the
indictment having already been returned, it is hard to see
why the Grand Jury needed the records.
Viewing the case realistically, Sllverthorne seems
to be one in which suppression was allowed because the
purpose of retrieving the records was not to present them to
the Grand Jury, which had already seen them and inspected
them, which had already returned its indictment, but, rather,
to prevent their future use at trial.
Procedurally, the case was wrongly handled.

The

subpoena should have been allowed and the records then
suppressed when sought to be introduced at trial.

But the

same result would have followed and this was done just some­
what prematurely.

But, in realistic sense, it is not a

Grand Jury case at all, it is a trial case.
Nov/, let me return to the alternative argument v/e
make.

It is, in effect, that a person in the posture of

respondent has no standing to object to the use against
others of either the records seised from him by hypothesis,
illegally, or to further testimony from him derived
indirectlv from that illota! spiwmp.

10

As we see It, this follows from the Alderman
decision and others like it, which hold that only a victim of
a Fourth Amendment violation and one against whom the evidence
illegally obtained is sought to be used, has standing to
object,

We are, of course, here dealing with the victim

but we are not dealing with one against whom the evidence is
sought to be used.

Having been immunized, he cannot be

harmed by the use of this evidence against others.
It seems to us that it would be extravagant to
interpose the exclusionary rule in this situation.
Q

Mr. Claiborne, you would say that for a trial

proceeding under 4l(e) that a movement couldn't come in and
say that he x^anted the property returned, even though there
were no prospect of its being used against him?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

We do not take that view,

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with respect to the return of the
property seized.

We would take that view as to the testimony

of the witness at trial in the same way that if he was
Immunized or if, for other reasons, he were not a defendant
or a prospective defendant.
The immunity situation is simply the most clear
one in which the evidence is not sought to be used against
him.
The other rule would result in the seeming anomaly
that a non-witness before a Grand Jury but whose records were

11
being submitted to it would have standing to

object.

There wouldn’t be any question of testimony, of
course, or he would be a witness.

It would also mean that a

non-party — this is Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s idea, really —
a non-party in a criminal trial would have standing; to object
so long as he were the victim.
It seems to us that the exclusionary rule need not
be pressed so far and that it would be striking the wrong
balance to view the small deterrent effect which concededly
would be served by that as against the important value to the
public of using evidence, the Importance, reliability of
which is not in doubt.
And this is specially so when we are dealing v/ith
a case in which the officers acted In good faith, pursuant to
a warrant which only subsequently was found to be supported
by somewhat insufficient affidavit.
Q

What do you say to the argument, either at the

trial or at the Grand Jury that even a non-party or a non­
witness has an interest in not having his private papers
disclosed to the public?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
Q

Because —

He can get them back, you say he can get them back

all right, but then there is going to be testimony as to
their contents and he may have no criminal liability.

He may

be open to no criminal problem at all or, even if he is, he

12
may be immunized but there is a separate interest of just
not having his affairs disclosed.
HR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, Mr. Justice White, we have

to assume that these are matters not so confidential that
but for the previous illegal search, they wouldn't be
required to be disclosed.

Of course, every person has an

interest in keeping private what he would rather not say
publicly.
Q

Well, you say that if the Government is prosecuting

a man, prosecuting a man, they can subpoena a third party
and tell him to bring his private correspondence and if they
contain relevant evidence to this criminal prosecution, unless
he asserts some Fifth Amendment privilege, he has g;ot to
bring them.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, there may be, Mr. Justice

White, an area where the Fourth Amendment will protect a
witness quite independently of any prior impropriety —
Q

I understand.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

would be a defense here.

I understand.
— against disclosure of his most
If that were the case, then that
Here, of course, we are dealing with

very nonprivate business records, nothing like a diary or
personal letters.

The respondent did not even seek their

return until he was called as a witness and tnis case is not
about those papers, it is about further testimony that would

13
normally be available from him,

testimony with respect to

criminal activities, which no man has a right to withhold.
The only claim here is that he is in the odd
position here of being able to withhold it because at some
previous time he was the victim of an illegal search.
Q

Are these papers of a character that would be

subject to examination by Internal Revenue agents?
MR, CLAIBORNE:

I would certainly think 30,

Mr. Chief Justice.
Q

And at this stage of this proceeding, is there

any problem about their becoming public as distinguished
from merely being disclosed to the Grand Jury in the privacy
and secrecy of their sessions?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, there is no

claim that these papers are confidential in any such sense.
There is a claim that the testimony which is sought to be
compelled from the witness, will be embarrassing, presumably
criminal.

It xvon’t

affect the defendant In a criminal sense

because he has received immunity but he obviously would prefer
not to

confess his involvement in the loan sharking

activity.

That, Indeed, is what would come out, which we

must suppose from his having pled the privilege against
self-incrimination.
But there is no question of confidentiality.

or compelling the testimony.
Q

to be further disclosure.

There is going

I mean, there are going to be

questions about them that don’t appear on the face of the
records.
MB. CLAIBORNE:

Quite true, Mr. Justice White,

but should the question of the disclosure of those
embarrassing bits of Information be determined by the fact
that there has been a prior illegal search?
Q

He should wait until those questions are asked

and then there will be a specific ruling on it then.

It

wouldn’t be just because it has been an Illegal prior search.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

He doesn’t suggest, Mr. Justice

White, any other ground for objecting to these questions, nor
can we conceive that there would be.

With the privilege

against self-incrimination having been overcome, no question
0-f privacy is seriously involved.

The only possible basis

for declining to answer would be the exclusionary rule of
the Fourth Amendment and that is —
Q

Well, I know, but he just isn’t

wasting his time.

Why doesn’t he want to answer?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
Q

Because he would rather keep —

Because he doesn’t want to waste his time or

15
because he doesn't want to talk about the papers?
MR. CLAUBORME:

Of course, Mr. Justice White, I

assume that he wduld prefer not to bear his involvement in
loan sharking activities to the world and that is reason
enough for him to be reluctant.

It is not reason enough for

the Government to be deprived of his relevant evidence.
Q

You say, "To the world."

At this stage, I repeat

again, is there any question of there being disclosed to the
world or only to the members of the Grand Jury the pledge
to secrecy?
MR. CLAIBORNE:
Justice.
Q

I must say that he would take the same view —
When it came to the trial court.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Q

Well, quite true, Mr. Chief

When it came to the trial court.

But we aren't there yet.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes, quite right, Mr. Chief

Justice.
Q

So we don't have to cross that bridge.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

If I may, I'll reserve the few

minutes remaining for rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

You may proceed, Counsel.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
ROBERT J. ROTATORI, ESQ.
MR. ROTATORI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

16
the Court:
I think what we need first of all is to clarify
in what position the Respondent stood before the Grand Jury
and came before this Court in review of the issues.
Respondent stood in the position of a witness
before the Grand Jury.

Respondent, as a witness, as a

citzen witness, had certain rights.

Included among those

rights were the right not to Incriminate himself, the Fifth
Amendment right which —
Q

Is that still a question, Mr. Rotatori?
MR. ROTATORI:

No.

That Fifth Amendment right

which was invoked was satisfied, in effect, by the
Governmental offer of complete transactional immunity.

I

agree with Mr. Justice Stewart that it would make no
difference if it was testimonial or use immunity only.
Or, if there were no immunity grant the issue
would be the same and we would be before this Court.
Q

Well, one of the Government's arguments would

3till be made and one

wouldn't, I gather.

MR. ROTATORI:

Yes, their second argument would

not be made, the moral argument as phrased by Government
Counsel.
Q

Right.
MR. ROTATORI:

I think what we must first

establish is, is there a Fourth Amendment right before the

17
Grand Jury?
And I think, clearly, this Court has held in the
past that there is a Fourth Amendment right.

The Government

acknowledges the fact here in Oral Argument that there is,
‘’Immediate Fourth Amendment rights before the Grand Jury."
Perhaps this Is a difference without a distinction.
I believe what the Government has reference to is the fact
that “Immediate Fourth Amendment right” being if a subpoena
is issued which, in the terms of Hale versus Henkel

violates

the Fourth Amendment because of the nature of its scope and
by virtue of the subpoena on its face that there Is an
immediate violation of the Fourth Amendment.
I submit to the Court that each question asked
of the Respondent before the Grand Jury, which question was
only asked because of a past violation of the Fourth
Amendment, amongst a new, immediate violation of the
Fourth Amendment

just as if a Subpoena were Issued for that

material based upon a past violation of the Fourth
Amendment, a question derived from a past violation, a
question into the privacy of the witness amounts to another
intrusion in

violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Now, the first argument regarding the question of
the propriety of anyone raising the Fourth Amendment
privilege before the Grand Jury either must go by the wayside,
particularly when considering the policy that the

18
Government argues, that this is going to cause a disruption
of the Grand Jury proceedings.

I think we recognize — this

Court has recognized — many disruptions of the Grand Jury
proceedings with regard to privileges, common lav/ privileges,
husband and wife privilege; a witness citizen has a right to
refuse to answer

a question of the Grand Jury, of the

prosecutor, with regard to communications during the period
of the marriage between he or she and his spouse.
Q

But you don’t have that where there is immunity.
MR ROTATORI:

I don't believe, your Honor — we

don’t have the Fifth Amendment privilege where there is —
Q

I mean, you don't interrupt the Grand Jury

proceedings once you grant immunity.

You answer the questions

then, don’t you?
MR. ROTATORI:

You answer the questions unless

the question violates another privilege that you have as a
witness.
Q

No, I mean, the only point was, you say that we,

as of now, we constantly disrupt Grand Jury proceedings.

I

am saying that you don’t disrupt Grand Jury proceedings
today, once the witness Is
Am I

granted full Immunity.

right or wrong?

MR. ROTATORI:

Well, it would depend upon what

occurs after the grant of Immunity, Mr. Justice Marshall.
I can see situations v/here a Grand Jury would be disrupted.

19
For example —
Q

I could conceive of a Grand Jury being disrupted by

a man blowing the building up, but I mean, I am just talking
normally.

In this case he did get full immunity.
MR. ROTATORI:

Q

Yes, that’s right.

You don't complain about that at all.
MR. ROTATORI:

Q

No complaint, no.

And now you are going to explain to us how he is

damaged —
MR. ROTATORI:
Q

Yes.

— by these questions.

That is what you are going

to explain to us.
MR. ROTATORI:

That is correct, your Honor.

I

feel he is damaged by virtue of the fact that, in a nutshell,
each question amounts to an intrusion into his Fourth
Amendment rights, that by answering the question or being
forced to answer the question, that he, in effect, aids In a
violation of his own rights.
We start from the premise that no citizen need aid
law enforcement officials in violating his own Constitutional
rights.
seizure.

We have a right to resist an unreasonable search and
We have a right to resist an unlawful arrest and

in that sense, refusing to answer a question in which the
question conceivably is derived from a past violation of the
Fourth Amendment, gives rise to an additional or new Fourth

20
Amendment right to resist answering that question because the
question itself becomes an additional intrusion, just as if
it were another physical search, because the privacy, the
right to remain free and to feel secure, in the terms of
Boyd, is violated by the question.
Regarding other intrusions upon the Grand Jury
which have been recognized as justified because of a higher
policy reason, we have, of course, the conditions laid down
by this Court in Branzburg, the conditions laid down by this
Court in Gravel.
There are situations where the Grand Jury will be
interrupted because of certain Constitutional rights and
privileges that rise above the expeditious handling of the
Grand Jury.
Q

Are you talking about the Court's opinion in

Branzburg or the dissent?
MR. ROTATORI:

The dissent, primarily.

The Court's

opinion does recognize areas, though, where its decision
could perhaps be different and I feel that once we recognize
the fact that Grand Juries can be interrupted —- and I think
at this point we have to recognize that we are not really
talking about the interruption of a. Grand Jury, we are
talking about the interruption and disruption of a prose­
cutor's plan.
Grand Juries no longer are the bulwark standing

21
between the overzealous prosecutor and our citizenry.

Grand

Juries are no more and no less than a tool of the prosecutor
and sometimes used by prosecutors as a scapegoat for certain
decisions that they have arrived at.
Q

What is your authority for that statement?

I know

it is one that has been made repeatedly.
MR. ROTATORI:

I have — I don't believe there is

any decision of this Court that states it in those terms,
but I think this

Court has recognized in Dionisio the fact

that the original concept of the Grand Jury changed from
common lav/ days to today.

There is language in that opinion

to that effect and I guess my opinion is from my own
experience.

My authority for that position is my own

experience.
Q
true

And what may be true In Cleveland, Ohio may not be
somewhere else.
IiR. ROTATORI:

My experience goes beyond Cleveland,

Ohio, Mr. Justice Stewart and certainly, in any regard, it is
outside the record and perhaps should not have been made.
Q

Well, this Grand Jury has been interrupted now for

two years, has it not?

And, of course, the original Grand

Jury is no longer in existence, I take it?
MR. ROTATORI:

I assume — the record isn't clear,

Mr. Chief Justice, but I assume that that original Grand Jury's
term has expired.

22
Q

It would be a rare thing for a Grand Jury life to

go that period of time, would it not?
I1R. ROTATORI:

Well, I believe under the lav; now,

a Grand Jury’s initial life is for 18 months and can be
extended for an additional 18 months.
Q

But it doesn’t often happen.
MR. ROTATORI:

certainly.

It does not often happen, no;

I haven’t experienced that situation.

But it

seems to me that there is no question there was a disruption.
The question is, is whether the policy considerations for
the disruption override the disruption itself.
Q

You haven’t talked yet, and I assume you will,

about the reasoning behind the idea of the exclusionary
doctrine as applied in the trial of a case as compared with
the application of it to a Grand Jury situation, in terms of
the purposes of the exclusionary rule.
MR. ROTATORI:

Yes.

If it please the Court, I

will address myself to that point right now.
First of all, we must recognize that generally
the exclusionary rule was formulated and applies in a
situation where you have a defendant availing
the benefits of that rule.

himself to

This is not that situation.

The exclusionary rule, in effect, being a right to suppress
evidence in the possession of another, generally the
Government or the state, comes into play when the violation

23

of the Fourth Amendment right is complete and you are, in
effect, intruding into the truth-seeking process because of
higher policy considerations that, primarily being that if
you don’t, you are not going to detour future violations and
that will detour [deter?] future violations because law
enforcement officials will not violate the Fourth Amendment
if they know that the fruits of the violation can’t be
used in the trial.
Q

deterrent
How close is the
/
effect in this particular

case, Mr. Rotatori, that Mr. Claiborne was commenting on,
where the officers did go and get a warrant

and, presumably,

thought they were doing the best they could, acting in good
faith?

How much of a deterrent effect is the suppression

of that type of evidence going to have?
MR. ROTATORI:

Well, I think that it will have an

excellent deterrent effect in the sense that a^hen the
Government concedes, which it has, in effect, done in this
case, that we have conducted an illegal search, they will
stop.

They will acknowledge that fact, admit it to the

Court and not attempt to continue that Fourth Amendment
violation or aggravate it by asking questions.
Q

But what we are talking about is deterring police

conduct, in the first instance, I suppose, rather than
stopping a Grand Jury proceedings at that stage.
I mean, how is suppressing this kind of evidence

2H
going to mold police conduct where here the people did go and
get a warrant and presumed

if they went and got a warrant,

they thought they were submitting a sufficient affidavit,
even though it were ultimately determined that they didn't.
MR. ROTATORI:

Well, I think the deterrence that

you will have is that in the future, they will not apply for
a warrant for an individual's place of business unless they
meet the standards of probable cause to apply for that
warrant and they would benefit, the attorneys drafting the
affidavit

on behalf of the law enforcement officials, will

benefit by a oourt decision with regard to what constitutes
sufficient grounds.
Q

Do you really think so?
MR. ROTATORI:

Q

Yes, I really do.

Well, In that sense, we are not dealing with the

exclusionary rule as such, are we?
MR. ROTATORI:

Unfortunately, Mr. Justice Stewart,

the District Court talked in terms of the exclusionary rule.
Q

Yes, but, Mr. Claiborne, here, said at the outset,

he said that they are conceding the illegality of the search
and they are not questioning the propriety of returning the
evidence that was presumptively wrongfully seized.

So that

is evidence that what was wrongfully seized, that evidence
has not been sought to be introduced before the Grand Jury.
This is not an exclusionary rule case as such, is it?

25
MR. ROTATORI:
Q

No.

I agree.

And I thought you made the very point that the

interrogation and, indeed, as you put it, each question is
an additional and continued violation of the Fourth Amendment.
MR. ROTATORI:

That is correct.

That is our

position.
Q

This

is not an exclusionary rule case.

It is

more subtle than that, and more complex, is it not?
MR. ROTATORI:

I believe so.

I was responding to

questions from the bench —
Q

Yes, I know you were.
MR. ROTATORI:

— with regard to the application

of the exclusionary rule and I didn't want to say in my
opinion it doesn't apply and let it go at that.
Q

Fine.
MR. ROTATORI:

Certainly, the District Court

consideration of this case, and the Court of Appeals
consideration of this case as one in which the exclusionary
rule would result in the decision reached is one I cannot
completely quarrel with.
However, I do accede to Mr. Justice Stewart's
comment that this, in effect, is more subtle than that.
is deeper than that, more fundamental than that.

It

Each

question is an additional intrusion into the protected area
of the Fourth Amendment.

26

Now, I think what effect does that decision have
on the operation of the Grand Jury is a policy decision and
there are certain factors which are present in this record
which I believe correctly led the Court of Appeals and the
District Court to decide that whatever disruption existed
was justified.
We have a case here where the issue of the
validity of the search was a question of law which was
decided on the face of the moving papers, in effect.

It

was an issue in effect then which could be resolved quickly
without a full-blown

suppression hearing.

It was an issue

which could be decided solely on the basis of legal
argument in effect, and was so decided, and quickly and
expeditiously by the court.
The hearing was not protracted, as I have mentioned.
It was limited to arguments of law.

The Government conceded,

and for this they must be applauded, to the District Court
that every question It was going to ask of Respondent was
derived from evidence obtained in that search, which was at
issue.
This allowed the Court to proceed expeditiously
and is another factor to be taken Into consideration.

How,

certainly, I think it is a requirement upon the Government to
make that admission when that is, in fact, the case.
delay between the appearance at the Grand Jury and the

The

27
hearing and resolution toy the Court was really not attributable
to the witness' motion but, rather, to the fact that there
was — no notice requirement was given to the witness concer­
ning the fact that immunity was going to be applied for and I
think that is necessary because it gives the witness — that
notice would give the witness time to consult counsel to
determine whether or not there are rights which he can
avail himself to.
I think — I believe the red light is on —

23
AFTERNOON SESSION
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rotatori, you may

continue.
MR. ROTATORI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

I think I should digress for a moment and speak
briefly about the fundamental difference In the Fourth
Amendment versus the Fifth Amendment reaching so as to
ultimately reach the question of whether or not the grant of
immunity in the facts of this case resolves to a great extent
a great part of the case.
Of course, I don’t believe that It does.
The Fifth Amendment, fundamentally and briefly
in effect states that an individual shall not
be a witness against himself.

If he is not going to be

prosecuted, if the soverign says to the witness, we are not
going to prosecute you for anything about which you testify,
then there is no possibility that that Individual can be a
witness against himself.
questions.

Therefore, he must ansx^er the

On the other hand, the Fourth Amendment protects

privacy, the right to personal security, In effect, and the
Fourth Amendment right of privacy applies regardless of
whether you are in a criminal setting, whether there is a
possibility of criminal prosecution, or whether there is a
possibility of self-incrimination.

That is irrelevant.

I

29
I think that is the teaching of this Court in Camara where we
are dealing with health inspection ordinances ahd the Court
says it is anomalous for us to say that Fourth Amendment
rights depend upon prospective criminal proceedings or the
possibility of self-incrimination.
Q

So, therefore —

Hr. Rotatori, we are quite a ways down the road

from violation of privacy by the time you get to where this
problem arose.
MR. ROTATORI:
Q

In this case, Mr. Chief Justice?

Yes.
I®. ROTATORI:

Well, I guess that is what the

Government means when they talk about immediacy of the Fourth
Amendment violation.

Timewise, from the original violation
%

of the facts in this case, we are some months away but the
question asked in the Grand Jury, albeit some months away from
the original Intrusion, concededly Fourth Amendment violation,
is, in itself, according to Respondent, a3 separate and
distinct violation of the Fourth Amendment which springs
from another Fourth Amendment violation which occurred months
prior.
Q

This is something like, I suppose, the concept of

exclusion by the way of the fruits doctrine, is it not?
MR. ROTATORI:

Well, I'd prefer not to get into the

question of whether this is an exclusionary rule concept or
not.

I really —

30

Q

But that is the question raised by the petition

for certiorari.

So we have to get into it.

MR. ROTATORI:

Right, that is what the

Government has framed this case and they would like the
Court to believe that we are talking about a furtherance of
the exclusionary rule, but the Respondent does not agree.
First of all, it is Respondent’s position that we
are talking about additional violations of the Fourth
Amendment or new violations springing from prior violations
but not necessarily exclusion.
Q

What the Court is doing —

Well, of course, it has nouances, as Justice

Stewart suggested, nuances which perhaps is also true of
the

fruit doctrine, is it not so?
MR. ROTATORI:

Yes, it does.

You can view it — it

depends upon whether you look at exclusion — I look at
exclusion as a remedy, as opposed to a right and I believe
that we are all involved in here in the prevention of a
right violation —
Q

What case of this Court describes the exclusionary

rule as a remedy in the sense you are using it, a remedy for
the party?
MR. ROTATORI:

I think the entire Mapp versus

Ohio really talks about how do we restore this individual or
how do we restore this individual to a point where the
violation is remedied?

31

Q

I don’t recall any case In which the Court has

ever discussed any concept except that the broad range of
keeping the system, the integrity of the system protected
from the use of illegally acquired evidence, not as any
benefit for the individual, but for the benefit of the
system.

Isn't that the rationale underlying the exclusionary

doctrine?
MR. ROTATORI:

Yes, certainly that is the basic

rationale.
Q

We don’t do it because of any right on the part of

the defendant who is asserting it.
MR. ROTATORI:

Yes, they do it in the sense that

what is involved, if the evidence is allovred to be introduced
in the criminal proceeding is we bring about, in effect, a
combination of Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations which, in
effect, bring about a disruption of the system, an infection
of the legal system.
Q

Haven’t some of the cases simply said that the

defendant in a case where the exclusionary doctrine is applied
is merely an incidental and, often, an undeserving beneficiary?
MR. ROTATORI:
Q

Yes.

Language something to that effect.
MR. ROTATORI:

There has been language to that

effect, Mr. Chief Justice and certainly it is on the basis
that this would deter further violations.

32

Q

Can you think of any case in which a defendant who

succeeded in suppressing evidence was a deserving in the
sense that he had earned it in some way?
MR. ROTATORI:

Well, I think if we talk in terras of

Silverthorne, certainly —
Q

Papers, as distinguished from heroin, for example.
MR. ROTATORI: . I really don't think we can — we

can’t place a condition on the Fourth Amendment depending
upon the subject matter of the search which is in question.
Q

Well, you wouldn’t suggest that a man who is

found with 10,000 pounds or whatever it may be of heroin
concealed in the back of a truck deserves anything from
society or from the courts?
MR. ROTATORI:

I think he deserves the full

protection of the Constitution.
Q

Well, deserving in the sense that he, personally,

deserves what flows from the exclusionary doctrine.

Isn’t

it the system that the courts are trying to protect?
MR. ROTATORI:

Yes.

The integrity of the system,

the integrity of the truth-seeking process.
Q

Yes.
MR. ROTATORI:

And, also, to deter future

violations.
Q
wasn’t It?

Yes, the

deterrence was a very major factor,

33
MR. ROTATORI:
type of situation here.

But we are not involved in that
We are talking about here the

District Court initially deciding whether or not it is going
to protect or prevent ongoing immediate violations of the
Fourth Amendment by the questions and the Court has a right
to do that because we have circuit court opinions that tell us
that an individual who can prove

that Fourth Amendment or

Fifth Amendment violations are ongoing and continuing has
a right to get them enjoined by the federal court.
Q

The Fifth Amendment is not in this case.
MR. ROTATORI:

No, it is not in this case,

Mr. Justice Marshall.
Q

I have great problems

on the Fourth Amendment

In this context without the Fifth, as I mentioned this
morning.
MR. ROTATORI:

Yes, I know and that is why I

started out my arguing — my argument after the luncheon
recess by getting back to the fundamental differences.

I

think, for example, if we look at Camara, the health
inspection ordinance situation, if the state in Camara told
Camara that "You are not going to be prosecuted at all and
nothing we find will be used against you but just let us
come in and inspect your building," this Court would arrive
at the same decision that it arrived at because we are
talking about his right to be free from that intrusion and

34
there is no possibility of self-incrimination.

There is no

possibility of criminal prosecution but yet there is the
Fourth Amendment rip;ht to be secure in his privacy and I
think that is the fundamental interest that the District
Court wanted to prevent a violation of when it ordered the
prosecutor not to ask any questions.
Q

Once again, is there any distinction between a

trial and the Grand Jury on that point?
MR. ROTATORI:

In this situation, no.

Respondent

would have to take the position that if these facts are rules
of trial, the decision must be the same.
Q

Well, your cart and my horse are in different —

my point was, assuming that It would be wrong at a trial, is
it necessarily wrong in the Grand Jury?
MR. ROTATORI:

Well, yes and no.

If we think in

terms of the exclusionary rule, we know a defendant hirnself,
a prospective defendant, a person that the Grand Jury is
going to indict, does not have a right to suppress that
evidence in the Grand Jury—
Q

But this is before us now.
MR. ROTATORI:

But he would have the right to

raise it at trial, of course.
Q

This man is not going to be indicted.
MR. ROTATORI:

Q

No.

No, he isn’t.

And you don’t see any difference?

35
MR. ROTATORI:
question is

Ro, I don’t, because whether the

asked of him in the Grand Jury or whether the

questions are asked of him in the trial, in either sitting
they amount to an intrusion into his privacy, an area
protected by the Fourth Amendment.
Q

And if the prosecutor should ask him in his

office, It would be the same thing, wouldn’t it?
MR. ROTATORI:
Q

That is your theory.
MR. ROTATORI:

Q
says that.

Yes, that is correct.

Umn hmn.

Yes.

I have great trouble with the case that

Silverthome didn’t say that.
MR. ROTATORI:

Silverthorne —

Well, I don’t think there has been

any case that says it directly —
Q

Yes.
MR. ROTATORI:

Q

But, certainly — pardon me?

The Court of Appeals In this case said It.
MR. ROTATORI:

The Court of Appeals in this case

said it and I think that Mr. Justice Douglas said It in
Gelbard, in effect.
Q

This case vras, I see, decided before this Court's

decision in Gelbard, was it not?

I know that the opinion of

the Court of Appeals —
MR. ROTATORI:
Q

The Court of Appeals decision?

Yes, it cites Gelbard and Its companion cases

36
indicating that certiorari was granted and so on.
MR. ROTATORI:

Yes, it was.

That is correct and

the, I believe the Government , after Gelbard petitioned
for reconsideration by the Sixth Circuit
Circuit denied reconsideration in view of

and the Sixth
Gelbard.

I think a moment must be given to the policy
consideration of a rule to the contrary of the rule
announced in this case by the Sixth Circuit In the District
Court and I think that brings right to the fore Mr. Douglas' —
Mr. Justice

Douglas’ comments in Gelbard and also the

chief judge of the District Court's comment in this case in
the Sixth Circuit's comment and that is a rule different from
the result below in this case which supplied police with an
added incentive to violate the rights of suspected co­
conspirators in order to marshal evidence against alleged
ringleaders.
Now, before that statement, which is a paraphrase
of Mr. Justice Douglas' statement in Gelbard, that this chief
judge of the District Court said, in effect, the same thing
and the Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously made the same
observation and for those reasons we respectfully request
that this Court affirm the Sixth Circuit and the District
Court's opinion.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Kotatori.

Thank you,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP
LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.
MR. CLAIBORIiE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In light of some of the questions explored by
the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stewart and Justice White,
I think it would be useful to make a further comment on the
proposition that each question of this witness is a further
separate distinct invasion of his right of privacy
guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.
I find it extraordinary that that should be
treated as the stronger side of Respondent’s case.

If he

were arguing that the very records seized illegally ought not
be used even before the Grand Jury, Silverthorne might give
him some support.
Here, we are well beyond that.
about the exclusion of the seized records.

We are not talking
We are talking

about the fruit of the poisoned tree attenuated further down
the line.

We are talking about material that wasn't

obtained directly by any
Government.

illegal action on the part of the

We are talking about evidence that would normally

be available to the

Government* however intrusive it might be

on the witness, however unpleasant it might be for him to
testify, his normal obligation as a witness before a Grand

38
Jury or a trial would be to divulge this relevant information
which, the Government is seeking of him.
Q

Well, would they have known about it had they not

carried out the illegal search?
HR. CLAIBORNE:

It is conceded, Mr. Justice White,

that they would not have known about it.
But, at least, we are not talking about the very
immediate fruit.
Q

Well, isn't that normally what we would talk

about a fruit?

If you happened to learn something from an

illegal search, that is fruits even though if you had known
about it before, you might have been able to get a warrant.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I am not suggesting, Mr. Justice

White, that this isn't covered by the fruit of poisonous
tree doctrine.
I am suggesting that there is no further
separate distinct invasion of Fourth Amendment rights if the
exclusionary rule as applied to poisonous fruits were to
bar the use of this evidence because it is derivative from
an illegal act.
Q

Yes, but you are going to get additional

information.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Yes, but only the prophylactic

deterrent value of the exclusionary rule ttfould justify
depriving the public at trial of —

39
Q

What if one of the questions was now,"We learned

from these papers we seized that you have another paper at
home?
"Now, just, please turn that over.'1
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I would have supposed that insofar

as we are talking about either an immunized witness at trial
or a proceedings before a Grand Jury, the Government would be
free to subpoena that additional paper.
Q

Yes, although there is a further invasion there of

the same kind.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

But that subpoena Is not an

invasion of the Fourth Amendment in itself.
Q

Well —
MR. CLAIBORNE:

That subpoena would have been

wholly proper.
Q

Your argument would be very interesting and very

persuasive were it not for the Silverthorne case.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, I have

attempted to distinguish the Silverthorne- case.

I think it

is fair to say that the Silverthorne case, because it arose
after the man had been Indicted and, therefore, is really an
effort to exclude from trial, not from the Grand Jury,
evidence which would have been useful.
The Grand Jury had already seen these records
seized in Silverthorne.

The man had already been indicted.

40
They used the Grand Jury process to obtain the
same records

to subpoena.

However, it wasn't to produce

them before the Grand Jury, it was obviously to produce them
at trial.
Q

There was a contempt.
MR, CLAIBORNE:

Well, the contempt, It should

have been done under Rule 17.
Q

Silverthorne wasn't a reversal of any conviction.

There hadn't been any trial.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Quite right, Mr. Justice Stewart,

but it was a block to an attempt to use records for a forth­
coming trial.
Q

It was a premature attempt.

You concede everything Silverthorne held by con­

ceding that they could have the records back and keep them.
Q

In this case.

Q

In this case.
-

MR. CLAIBORNE:

That is correct.

But, beyond

that, I must say that if — there may have been a question In
Silverthorne and one doesn't know how broad the ruling was
as to whether the photographs of the records would have been
usable at trial.
Q

That wasn't held, was it?

Q

No.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, the opinion, as we know,

contains language so broad that it would seem to bar —

41
Q

That is sort of the issue here.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

But this Court has long since

repudiated the broad dictum of Silverthorne, if only in
Alderman, by saying the Fourth Amendment does not mean that
illegally-seized evidence may not be used at all.

On the

contrary, It may be used against someone not the victim.
For instance, it may be used by way of impeachment.
How, those would be, seemingly, barred uses under
the broadest interpretation of Silverthorne.
Q

Under Silverthorne, isn't the potential for

disruption of an ongoing Grand Jury investigation more
limited than would be involved here, too, since there had
already been a separate determination 0f illegality.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Quite true, and, also, Mr. Justice

Rehnquisfc, since the indictment had already been returned,
there was no disruption of the Grand Jury proceeding;
Grand Jury had finished its work.

the

We were simply prematurely

barring evidence from trial, or the court was.

It

should

have been done when it was sought to be introduced rather
than when a subpoena was served, but that is, as the Court
viewed it, a difference without Constitutional importance.
But it was plainly barring the Government from
using the illegally-seized evidence at trial and to that
extent is, of course, and has always been invoked by this
Court as the first extension of weeks of the exclusionary

42
rule to reach a second attempt or a derivative attempt to
exploit an illegal activity.
As X repeat, here, the nexis between the
illegality and the testimony sought to be obtained is remote.
It Is therefore less offensive, less of a violation of the
exclusionary rule than it would be if the very records
involved were sought to be used.
Q

What Is the difference between putting in a

record which shows that I loan-sharked you, Joe Doakes, out
of $100 and asking you, "Isn’t it true that you loan-sharked
Joe out of $100?”

The difference is what?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

I would suppose, Mr. Justice

Marshall,that in the second case, if the answer were yes
there could be no argument about it, whereas the record might
be ambiguous or it might supply something which the paper
itself did not.

This may not be that situation, but we must

assume that the Government was seeking to get more than It
already had through the records.
Q

Well, assuming that you can’t put in the record,

then you can answer the question — you can ask the question.
But if the question is exactly what is in the record, what is
the difference as to that man’s rights?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, I may have mislead the

Court womewhat by conceding that a motion to return the
property would be available.

It doesn’t follow, in my

view,

43
that the Government would not be free to use copies before
the Grand Jury.
The reason for the rule of return is that a man is
entitled — if it is lawful property and not contraband — to
its return when it has been obtained in an improper way.
It doesn't either follow that a subsequent
subpoena wouldn't reach it, though Silverthorne says no.
But, again, not in the context, really, of the GRand Jury
proceedings but rather in the context of a forthcoming trial.
We would, if pushed, take the position that it
would be proper to obtain at least copies of the material
itself if it had been improperly seized in the first instance.
The invasion having been not in reaching that material, which
was in no sense privileged, but in the way in which it was
obtained by an intrusive search — or so the court held —
without justification, without sufficient probable cause.
But the material isn't privileged.

It Is very

unlike the Presidential tapes with respect to which a
privilege may exist in no matter what custody, in no matter
what method is attempted to be used to obtain them; or a
lawyer's work papers or a doctor's records of his patients
which can't be reached either by a search or by subpoena.
Here we are talking about material that is not
privileged that could be reached by subpoena.

The only flaw

was that it was reached at the first time by a procedure

which was unduly intrusive but it was that intrusion that
violated the Fourth Amendment, not the obtaining of the
paper which could legitimately be obtained and the obtaining
of which would in no conceivable

way violate the Fourth

Amendment had it been done by subpoena.
Q

You submit in your reply brief that Silverthorne

was wrongly decided.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

We 3ay, Mr. Justice Stewart,

that if the distinctions we attempted to draw are not
accepted and if pushed that far, we would take that view,
understanding it only as holding that subpoena couldn’t reach
these papers on the ground that they cannot be immunized
because at one time they had been wrongly seised.
With that submission, we pray that the judgment
below be reversed.
i

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you,

Mr. Claiborne.
Thank you, Mr. Rotatori, the case is submitted.

was submitted.)
