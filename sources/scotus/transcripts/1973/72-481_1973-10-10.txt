MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hoar arguments

next in Ho. 72-481» State of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe.
Mr. Coniff, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. CONIFF, JR. , ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT 0? GAME OF THE
STATE OF WASHINGTON
MR. CONIFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court:

My name is Joseph Lawrence Coniff, Jr., and I am an Assistant
Attorney General from the State of Washington, and I am here
representing the Washington Department of Game,
As I am sure the Court is aware, this is the second
time that this particular matter has been before the Court,
The previous occasion was of course in 1968, when the Court
hai occasion to render its opinion in this matter, at 391 U.S.
392,

This case basically involves a further clarification of

the treaty language, Indian treaty language pertaining to
claimed off--re servat ion Indian fishing rights.

And I would

like to preliminarily note for the Court’s information that at
the time that this litigation was commenced in .1963, that both
the Washington Department of Gama and the Washington Department
of Fisheries were parties plaintiff and adopted the same
position.

However, I have been instructed to advise the Court

that the Washington Department of Fisheries has not sought
review of the lower court opinion, which is now before you, but

that the Washington Department of Game has authorised and in­
structed me to file the petition for certiorari whir* of course
the Court has granted.
1 should also advise you that the Washington Depart­

ment of Pisher5.es' position.., as contrasted to the Washington
Department of Game's position, is predicated upon its

v&jakivj

of this Court's prior opinion.
The Fisheries’ position appears to he predicated upon
the concept of granting to Indian, treaty Indians special
Indian only commercial netting seasons for salmon in the fresh
»K* •

t i

water streams of the State of Washington.

It is the position

of the Washington Department of Game before this Court that the
position of our sister agency is incorrect and is unlawful,
because a state law prohibits the use of this type of set net •
or commercial netting gear for the catching of ahadroraqus fish
of which both salmon and steelhead are anadrbtaoun fish in offreservation waters, and in reality the positionwhich has been
adopted by the Fisheries Department and which is cdoHu.ly
paralleled by the federal government’s position in this case
i’

- "»

’•?' si

before the Court is predicated upon the assumption that a state
administrative agency director has the authority by regulation
to issue s. regulation authorising activity which the state
legislature has prohibited.

and it is Game's position that a

fair reading of this Court's opinion in Puyallup, and in
particular the language used by Justice Douglas, who wrote for

6
•4 unanimous court, In the concluding paragraph of t'hnt opinion,
which emphasizes the equal protection concepts Implicit in the
treaty fishing clause language, that language is: that the right
fco fish in off-reservation waters, in usual and accustomed
places outside reservation boundaries, is one which might be
exercised in common with all of the citizens of the territory,
And Justice Douglas, speaking for the Court, emphaai^-sd c.v,v
equal protection concepts implicit in that language.

And it

is Game’s position before this Court that the equal protection
concepts implicit in the treaty language itself require a
reversal of the lower court.
In other words, gentlemen, the line of demarcation
should be the reservation boundaries, and that once an. Indian,
a reservation Indian moves outside of the reservation
boundaries into oft-reservation areas, that ha is fully subject
and amenable to the jurisdiction and enforcement, if you will,
of state conservation laws, rules and regulations pertaining
to the taking of fish.

And this would include salmon as well

an steelhead.
I believe that our position, and I mean Game's
position, is further sustained by the opinion of this Court in
the Kescalero Apache decision v. Franklin «.Tones, which is 41,
Law Week, 4451,

This decision I feel is ©f very critical im­

portance to the legal position which has been taken by the
Department of Game before the Court, in that it deals with

7
ofPreservation activities•on the part of the Indian tribe in
the State of New Mexico*

And the facts of the case are that

the Mescaler© Tribe, pursuant to a federal program, constructed
a ski enterprise in an off-reservation, location, and, the
argument was that the State of New Mexico could not impose its
taxing laws to this particular enterprise, and this Court, '
citing interestingly enough the Puyallup decision, held that
tha absent federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond
reservation boundaries have been generally held subject to
nondiscrirainatory stats law otherwise applicable to all
citizens of the state.

See Puyallup Tribe v. Department, of

Game and other cases, a series of other cases.

X think the

following language in that paragraph is sufficiently important
to call it and emphasise it to the Court’s attention.
In discussing Racehorse, it states that principle,
the Racehorse .principia, is as relevant to a state's tax laws
as it is to state criminal laws — see the case — and applies
as much to tribal ski resorts as it floes to fishing enterprises,
citing Village of Kake v. Egan.

'In this case w« have the particular words of a

particular treaty, don’t we. General —
MR. CON IFF;
Q

Ye-S .

— the right of taking fish at all usual and

accustomed grounds and stations, it is further secured as- set
Indians, in common with all citizens in the territory.

What

8
we have in this case is to try to ascertain the meaning of
those particular words in that particular treaty, rtfchcr than
bs guided by the general kind of rules to which you have been
referring.
HR. COHIFF:

Well, X don't believe Ward v. Racehorse

is the kind of general language that you are referring to.
The facts of Ward v. Racehorse involved a treaty with compar­
able language, involving X believe the Vanek Tribe in the
<

State of Utah, and this is of course an older decision of
the Court, but I believe that it has been revitalized.
In that particular case, that happened tc involve
hunting instead of fishing, but I think the same type of
language was involved.
Q

It is not the type of language, it is really

the particular words of the particular treaty here, i n’t it?
HR. COMIFFs

Yes.

Wall, my point is, Your Honor,

the treaty involved in Ward v. Racehorse is so close to the
Isaac I.Stevens treaties that we are confronted with in the
State of Washington that the Court's revitalization, if you
will, of the equal footing doctrine of Ward v. Racehorse I
believe to be extremely significant, and that is why X was
pointing out this Court’s reliance X believe in revitalization
of the Ward v. Racehorse doctrine —
Q

What is

t reated in Puyallup I?

equal footing doctrine and how is it

9

MS* CONIFF:

It was not treated in Puyallup I except

as I understand the final paragraphs of that opinion, as
authorised by Justice Douglas, which indicated that the final
resolution of the problem which the Court did not reach in
that opinion, should include the equal protection concept!?
implicit in the treaty language in common with the citlssas of
the territory*
Now, X would submit that the question certainly is
not foreclosed at this time, particularly in light of this
Court's decision in the Mescalero case and in the citation of
Ward, aha I believe — 1 am sure — when X say equal footing,
we all know what I am talking about, so 1 am net going to go
back and try to run that one through again, unless you want me
to.

But X think it is extremely important, and I think it is

important when we keep in mind that in 1854 and *55, the
Indians who were resident in Washington territory, with whom
Governor Stevens was ordered to treat, were not citizens, and

1 think that the Civil War obviously had not been fought, the
14th Amendment lay in the unforeseeable future.

It of course

was not adopted until I860, and so when we look at the actual
positions of the parties,

the American commissioners on the

one side and the Indian people on the other.

The Indians were

being asked to move to a place where they would have exclusive
rights.

They do have exclusive rights within their reservation

boundaries insofar as the taking of' fish and game is concerned.

10

This is conceded and, as far as I am aware, this has always
been the position that my clients h&va taken.

We have no

jurisdiction and no authority to go into, within the exterior
boundaries of an Indian reservation and enforce any state
conservation laws, rules or regulations, and wo do not do so.
So when w© —
Q

Are there in fact, just as a matter of informa­

tion, tribal regulations?
MR. COHIFF:
instances there aren't*

In some instances there are, in' sore
The larger tribes, for example the

Yakima, the Macaw, the Qulnaielt, some of these larger groups
not only have printed regulations but they actually h.~ve a.n
enforcement, where they have tribal courts, with policemen.

I

happen to know the Yakima Tribe also has a jail, and I under­
stand that they do arrest people for infractions and that they

enforce.
Q

Conservation regulations?

MR. COHIFF:
knowledge.

I can't, answer you on my own personal

I believe that it is true in some instances,

generally, with some of the larger tribes.

I would point out

to the Court that there are over forty-some-odd tribes listed
in the preambles to the Governor — the five Governor Isaac I.
Stevens treaties.

Some of these tribes were in reality small

villages in 1855, and so some of the memberships and some of
the groups that are claiming these rights within the State of

■■

.

X-:.

Washington at this time are .•vary small, rather — if you will
fragmented organisations without any real cohesive political
or governmental authority.
So when we say'the word "Indians," you still have to
take it a stop further in terms of your analysis.

It is

apples and oranges when you get down to the reality cn the
riverbank.
I did want to make the point very clear, however, for
the record that we are not here discussing any attempt at
infringement,-if you will, of any self-government or any onreservation activity on the part of any Indian trite in the
State of Washington.
Q

Conservation isn’t necessarily at stake either,

is it?
MR. CONIFF:

Well, I believe that it is.\ I believe

V '

that the taking, that the use —
I

0

Well, is there challenge in this case of the

power of Washington to forbid commercial fishing, that it will
lead to the extinction of the fish?
MR. CONIFF:

If all we were to be here talking about

is the extinction of the fish, then I would agree with you, but
the fe^erra "conservation" connotes something more than simply
saving the last few,
Q

Isn't really the only issue who is going to b@

permifeted to take the fish first?

m.
Q

COMIFF:

Yes-.

I

Or how the oatfch is going to be divided really;

MR. CONIFP:

Ail right.

I think, if; 1 might, refer

the Court —
Q

It is the same question.

MR. COMIFF:

— refer the Court to the Appendix in

Mo. 247, October Term, 1967, this is the complaint, page 6,
this was the complaint that I drafted when I was out of law
school about one year, here I am —
Q

Well, —

MR, COMIFF:

But I wanted to point out what the com­

plaint was asking the court to do, and I don’t think we have
reached' it, I don’t think we have reached the answer yet.
Paragraph 5 reads:

"The defendants claim special privileges

or immunities from the application of valid conservation laws
of the State of Washington to which they are not legally
entitled.

.By virtue of the claimed special privileges or

immunities, the defendants are fishing extensively in the
Puyallup River and Commencement Bay with set nets and drift
note."

. Paragraph S:

"As a result of the defendants'

fishery, the anadromous fish runs of the Puyallup River will
foe virtually exterminated if said fishery is permitted to

continue, with no adequate
Q

and speedy remedy," and so forth.

Well, let me put it to you this way:

Let's

:i3

assume that whatever judgments came out of this Court, cams out
ultimately/ Indian fishing .was sufficiently limited so that
there would be no problems about extinction of the fishing
runs, as long as sports fishing was eliminated.
MR* CONIFF:

New, that —

You would be trading the resource from

the public interest to the Indian interest.
Q

That doesn’t satisfy you?

MR. CONIFF:

That would not be ray client's position.,

and that is not, I do not believe, and I would submit to the
Court is not a fair reading of the treaty provisions and is
not a fair reading of the decision that might be applicable
or might apply.
I would also add, in response
Q .

Well, assuming that X number of fish may safely

be caught each year, assume X number.
MR. CONIFF:
Q

All right.

Now, you say the Indians shouldn't have first

whack at that number of fish.

You say that they should be on

the same footing with sports fishing?
MR. CONIFF;
sport or commercial.

With all other citizens, whether it be
I would like to point out, there is no

discrimination against Indians to go outside the reservation
and engage in either sports fishing activities or commercial
fishing activities, pursuant to state regulation.
Q

Yes.

14
MR. COMIFF:

So that there isn't this discrimination.

And really the point I — the reason, why 1 went back and read
the complaint —

Q

The question is whether the treaty does give

them a special —
MR. CONIFF:

That’s it.

It is a quantification

question, a question of interpreting the language and attempt­
ing to quantify it.

And I am submitting to the Court that a

fair reading, a fair interpretation of the treaty language in
question would necessarily imply, in light of the historical
circumstances under which it was executed, that Indians were
entitled, were given a right in 1854-55 not to bo discriminated
against, keeping in mind the date, the historical setting, and
in which these treaties were executed, the 14th Amendment was
in the future, and pioneers and settlers, pursuant to govern­
ment policy, were being encouraged to move out, move into this
territory and let’s settle it, lot’s take it over, we just
settled things with the Nation of Great Britain, and vs wanted
to — the Hudson Bay Company was moving and we wanted to
populate this area.

But the government obviously had a

problem., they had to go out and trade with the native popula­
tions , and part of the deal was to give them exclusive rights,
to give them a place to reside and hopefully to be integrated
t .

into society at some time.

But the reservations — -I am off

the subject a little — 1 believe the reservations were

15
intended to be temporary/ but they haven't turned out to be
that way.

I am not quarreling with that.

I believe that is

the law today.
But certainly, whan you compare the exclusive rights
to fish and hunt within the reservation, which clearly was
understood I believe by everyone at that time, I think you keep
that fact in mind when you look at the quantum, if you will, o£
the off-reservation in common right, I think that -Q

Would you answer Justice Stewart's and Justice

White's question in the context of off-reservation, flshin.;?
\

MR. CONIFF;
Q

.

•

Yes.

Yes.

*

I am trying to —

This applies to only steelhead, doesn’t if?

It

does not involve salmon?
MR. CONIFFs

In my view, the question of treaty in­

terpretation dees not depend upon the species of fish.
Q

X thought this issue, I thought all that was

before us was the —
MR. CONIFF:

No, X would not agree.

I would not

agree with that, otherwise you are going to have a bifurcated
analysis., a bifurcated law, if you will, depending upon, the
way the state legislature decides to classify a fish.

The

treaty says the right to fish at usual custom grounds in common.
0

X thought that the salmon issue and the salmon

regulation was not before us here.
MR. CONIFF:

I do not agree with that, because I

15
recognise that the government is urging upon the Court that
this is foreclosed.

1 are pointing out to the Court that the.

treaty does not say salmon.

The treaty does not say steelhead.

The treaty does not say trout or bass or any other species.
It says the right to fish, and I honestly believe that the
impact of this Court’s decision would be to establish a
common rule which would apply to all spades of fish which
might be subject to commercial netting activities in offreservation waters of the state.
Q

Well, that issue is clear with respect to any

kind of fish, but I thought that in fact in this case what the
issue was was the — your state court's treatment of the
steelhead.

Well, if I am mistaken, I am mistaken, but that

is the impression 1 got —
MR. CONIFF:
Q

That is not my impression.

--in reading the briefs before I came into the

argument„
MR. CONIFF:

Perhaps I didn’t express myself well

enough in my statement, of the issues in the brief or in the
petition.

But at page 10, the first issue stated in my brief

is "Whether the Equal Protection concepts implicit in the
Treaty phrase ’...in common with all citizens of the Territory
... * means that treaty Indians must abide by state conservation
laws and regulations when they engage in fishing in off ~
reservation waters."

i?
Clearly, the treaty Itself, which is the fundamental
predicate from which we are going to legally operate, c:<‘s not
make the distinction, and I believe that the actual impact of
any decision of this Court will not be limited to & given
species of fish.
Q

Well, where can I most easily find the opinion

of your state court?
MR. CONIFP:

It would be as Appendix A to the

Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, which was filed on September
20, 1372.
Q

Your petition?

MR. CONIFF:

Yes.

It is an Appendix which is printed

thusly.
Q

This one?

MR. CONIFP:
Q

Yes.

And it is Appendix A of that?

MR. CONIFP:
0

September 21st, it says.

Yes.

Thank you.

MR. CONIFP:

Now if I might add another point here,

to this question of treaty interpretation, which I feel is
quite germane and, frankly» I feel is important as an interpre­
tive aid to the Court in interpreting the content or quantifi­
cation, i£ you will, or meaning to the in common language
as it might pertain to off-reservation fishing and hunting, is
the rather interesting fact that the in common with language

IB
does appear in another context in a Governor SfcercracT treaty,
and that is the treaty with the Yakima,
Now, the treaty with the Yakima provider,„ in addition
to the usual language on the right in common to fish at u.sua.1
and accustomed grounds, it also provides immediately follow!;::j,
as is also the right in common with the citizens of the
United States to travel upon all the public highways.

And X

would submit to the Court that a rather unusual result would
obtain if the application of state police power in the form of
traffic rules and regulations on public highways, if there Ir
a constitutional impediment to the application of the state
laws in that regard in tha terms of the fishing in the context
of fishing, we could really reap some very strange results
if we attempted to apply that rationale to this language which
appears in the treaty with tha Yakima,

And I frankly don't

know what the answer would be to the problem that I have
posed.
But I am relying upon the language in the Yakima
treaty, at least as an interpretive aid, in other words, whera
the same language was used by the same author, in this case
Governor Stevens —
Q

In the development of the decision of this

case or in the interpretation of the treaty, especially- as it
applied today to inquire whether and to what extent, tha state
contributes annually to the steelhead run?

IS
MR. CONIFF:

I do not believe that that is -*• in my

judgment, I do not believe that that would resalva the question
before the Court.
Q
■i >i

It may not resolve it, but is it re*levant though?

• •

•

ir

I take it that, left to its own devices, the stealhead run
adght not maintain itself at the present level.
MR. CONIFF;
Q

That is correct.

That the native steelhead run is only a fraction

of what it would be if the state didn't annually feed the
steelhead in the Puyallup.
MR. CONIFFj

That is correct.

Now, the studies that

the department has undertaken regarding the extent of hatchery
contribution to sport catch have reached somewhat varying
results, depending upon the study, but there are minimum
developments since.
Q

Isn't that a relevant consideration, as to what

in common with others ought to mean in the treaty today?
MR. CONIFF;

Well, I suppose in that sons® it may be.

I still maintain before the Court that what should ba relevant
and what were the relative circumstances of the parties, read
the entire instrument as a whole, keeping in mind the exclusive
nature of the rights which were to be granted and confirmed to
the Indian tribes in terms of their on-reservation fishing and
hunting activities, and contrasting that with the offreservation in common with language, keeping in mind the fact

20
that Indians were not citizens at that time, and keeping in
mind that this language dess appear in another context, in
Article III of the Treaty with the Yakima, and that should
the Court reach a result in interpreting in common with to
mean exclusive, paramount or prior in some sense# so that
they have a right to catch these fish perhaps superior to ail
other citizens# and may be able to catch all the fish ::nd the
citizens not any.
Then suppose at that point# Your Honor# that then
these considerations that you have mentioned of .the extent of
contribution to the resource by public funds would become
relevant and important.

But unless, I believe, that you have

to first .answer or reach the question of soma sort of quanti­
fication, and it is only at that point that you would then
begin tp judicia!3.y inquire into, well, perhaps the native
runs would not be &s high absent the contribution of the
state, and I might add the federal government, for that
matter, to the resource in the form of fish passage facilities,
dams, stream clearance projects, hatchery programs.

As I just

mentioned, the Washington Department of Game, our lowest study
shows on the Puyallup the lowest contribution in a single
year I believe was 60 percent, running as high as 80 percent
of total catch developed from our hatchery program, which for
the most part is financed by the sale, approximately 80 percent
financed by the sale of fishing licenses and steeihead punch

21
cards,,

So the sportsmen themselves are, you might say, paying

for a large part of the resource.

But I still maintain that wa

don’t reach this question unless we first have reached the
fundamental question of what is it that was secured.

And my

primary argument is geared to that level, rather than to’ the
level that you suggested, although in ray brief; X will admit,
I do take an alternative position.
There is a recent opinion, post-Puyallup aud postMescalero, a copy of which I have caused to be lodged wi ‘ *■ X i "S.i i VjClerk of the Court, entitled "Settler v. Yakima Tribal Court."
It was issued by the Federal District Court for the Eastern
District of Washington, by the Honorable George H, Powell, on
September 26, ,1973.

This is the only decision that I am aware

of on the federal level which deals with Puyallup and Mescalero,
and the issue before the Court —• it is not obviously in ray
brief, as I mentioned copies are lodged — the issue before the
Court was whether or not the Yakima's passed

regulation

pertaining to off-reservation fishing by the Yakima Indians
in the Columbia River.

They then want down on the river and

arrested a couple of members of the tribe who ware violating
those regulations, they were about sixty miles off the
reservation# took them back and tried them and convicted them.
The issue then was whether or not they had jurisdiction.
The Federal District Court for the Eastern District
of Washington, relying on the Puyallup-Mescalero rationale,

22

held that the Yakimas did not have extra territorial jurisdic­
tion .
I note the white light is on, and I would like to,
if I may, reserve the two or three moments remaining to me
for rebuttal.
HE. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Sachs©?

ORAL ARGUMENT 0? HARRY E. SACKSE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PUYALLUP TRIBE
MR. SACKSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I want to start out by saying that I think the Bepar
meat of Game’s position, contrary to its own state court's
finding, and contrary to its own Department of Fisheries'
position, tries to take out of nothing at all, just out of air
an argument that would eradicate the third article of the
treaty with the Puyallups, and that would jeopardise almost
©vary Indian treaty in the country.

The idea that when a

state comes into the state, that it can then ignore whatever
treaty had bean made by the United States prior to the time
that it came into the state, because other states dimst have
treaties with Indians, and this would have to be equal footing
But before I get into that in much detail, I want to
say I also think that it is based on a total misunderstanding
of this Court’s prior decision in this case.

Mr. Cohiff

argues that this Court's prior decision in this case, because

23

of the one phrase that In determining whether the regulation is
necessary for conservation# it should take into account the.
issue .of equal protection implicit in the phrase in common
with# means that whatever laws the state passes# they label
as conservation laws, apply equally to Indians and non-Indians
in the state.

That is the exact position that this Court re­

jected when it affirmed the decision below in the prior
Puyallup case,
What had happened there# this was the position that
Mr. Coniff had argued in the lower court in the State of
Washington in 1963# I think it was.

The Supreme Court in the

State of Washington# in 1967# rejected that position and held
that the essence of this opinion is in the decree as r®framed
should so reflect# one# if the defendant proves that he is a
member oil the Puyallup Tribe and# two# he is fishing at on® of
the usual and accustomed fishing places of that tribe; three,
he cannot be restrained or enjoined from doing so unless he is
in violation of the statute or regulation c£ the department*s
promulgated thereunder which has been established to be
reasonable and necessary for the conservation of the fishery.
And when this Court had the case# it made perfectly
clear# I think# that the issue was — the issue was the follow­
ing# that in the treaty, the tribe reserved for Itself the
right of fishing off-reservation, but it limited that right
in that its fishing in common with the people o£ the state.

And the Court —
Q

Usual and accustomed places?

MR. SACHSE:
right.

Usual and accustomed places, that’s

And there is no issue here that, these are —
0

And do you think it also means in the usual or

accustomed manner?
MR. SACHSS:

I think it means more than that and

different from that, and 1 will try to get to that in just a
minute.
Q

Well, what did Puyallup I say about that?

MR. SACHSS:

Puyallup 1 says — the treaty closer;;t

say anything as to the maimer.
Q

Old Puyallup say anything else —

MR. SACHSE:
Q

Sir?

Did Puyallup say anything els© about it in

terms of how Indians could be able-to fish, even if they had
the right to fish in the accustomed places?

Did it say any­

thing about whether they could fish in unaccustomed ways?
MR. SACHSE:

0

Yes.

MR. SACHSE:
Q

The Puyallup 1 decision?

The prior decision of this Court?

Yes.

MR. SACHSE:

1 think it said that the state is free

to regulate the manner of fishing, if it can show that it is
necessary for conservation, and that it does not discriminate

against the Indians in doing so.

I think the real point in

this case, and it is a point that I want to get to in a minute
is whether the regulation of the Department of Gama in this '
case has been shown to be necessary for the conservation of
fish.
Q

Mr. S&chsa, as I read Puyallup, at least ,cn

page 98, it says that the manner may be regulated in tha
interest of conservation, it doesn’t say that it has to be
necessary for conservation.

Do you find other language in

the case that supports -MR. SACKSE:
If is Footnote 14.

Yes, sir, on page 402 in the footnote.

The court said, ’‘As to irragulation

concerning the time and manner of fishing outside the reser­
vation, we said that the power of the state was to be measured
by wehther it was necessary for the conservation of fish."
And the court then contrasts the lesser power of the state to
regulate Indian fishing from its general police power, and X
think that is also implicit in the affirmance of the court
below.
Q

How would you weigh a statement in the opinion

itself that seemed to conflict with a statement in a footnote?
MR. SACHSE:

I would look at the case as a whole

and X would say that this case affirmed the decision below
which held in accordance with several other decisions of this
Court, that the standard is whether it is necessary for the

regulation of fish, and that this Court actually went further
in Puyallup, it said that the Court should show that it is
necessary for the regulation of fish and implicit in that is
the idea that the regulation should not ba discriminatory
against the Indians, in the sense that it shouldn't make
them bear the whole burden of the conservation regulations.
Q

Do you think the treaty would give the — do

you think the treaty fishing right would cover, would
guarantee the right to Indians to fish commercially even
though at the time the treaty was signed, they had never
fished commercially, they simply did it as a matter of sub­
sistence?
MR. SACHSE:

Wall, to start off with, the Court in

Puyallup 1 assumed that the Indians did fish commercially.
Q

That isn't what I asked you, Mr. Sachse.

MR. 3&CHSR:
0

Mo.

I asked you whether -- what is your view of

the treaty, did the -treaty guarantee the right of Indians to
fish commercially when they never had fished commercially at
the time the treaty was signed.
MR. SACHSS:
question.

I think that would be a difficult

I think the better argument would ba, the better

answer would be that, yes, it did, what the purpose of —
Q

Is it a relevant question in this case or not?

MR. SACHSE;

I don't think so, because at the time

of this treaty , these Indians did fish eotnmarcially, and tinrecord. when the case was here before, the statement of an
anthropologist to the effect that these Indians ware supplying'
the Hudson Bay Company with their salmon and steelh&ad at the
time of this treaty.
Q

They caught with nets?

MR. SACHSE:

Which they caught with nets.

fished with nets, they fished commercially.

They

1 think also the

Court has to —
Q

With gill nets?

MR. SACHSE:

Y<as, sir.

Well, let me say this:

The

record of this case doesn’t show that it was with a. gill net.
Indians in that general area did fish with gill nets before
the white men cam®, and there is a statement to that effect in
a book called "Kroeber," on the Indians of the northwest coast,
which describes how they made the nets and how big the nets
were.

Gill nets are not an invention of the whits man.
I think a good deal of what Mr. Coniff has argued

were the same points argued in the Winans case in 1905, and
that were rejected in that case.

Now, I want to take a

minute on that and then 1 want to gat into the question of
these present regulations and what this has to do with con­
servation of fish today.
To start off with, when tine treaty was made, this
treaty, like the treaty with the Yakimas, all the treaties in

28
the northwest coast did three things.

To start off with,

they were peaceful treaties.

Governor Sfcevons was- sent in to

negotiate with the Indians.

In each treaty, there is a clause

in which the Indians cede to the United States & very large
section of land that they had occupied.

There is a second

clause in which the* Indians reserved to themselves a very
small piece ©f land on which they were to live? and there is
a third clause in which they reserve to themselves the right
of fishing at all their usual and accustomed places in common
with the people of the territory and the right of putting up
.houses and so forth to dry their fish at those places»
It is quite clear that that third clause was con­
sidered necessary for them to be able to maintain themselves,
the land they were giving up was large, the land they were
keeping was too small for them to make» a living on.

And the

treaty was negotiated in a kind of jargon, it was called a
Chinook jargon.

And there is also evidence in the first

record here that the treaty was translated to the Indians in
very simple terras, and what it obviously meant to them was
that they had to give up the big land, they had to live on
the small land, but they could continue to fish at the usual
placas that they could fish, but that they would no longer
have that exclusive right, that the settlers would be able
to fish there, too.
There is nothing In it that said they submitted, to

29
regulation by the state, there is nothing in it that says ve
want to be sports fishermen and go out and angle, they were
fishing to feed their families .and to trade.

And since that

time they have continued to fish that way except when the state
has prohibited them from fishing that way.
Nov;, in United States v. Winans, 1905, Wiuans was a
landowners who had set up a fish wheel to make a large commaj- oial fishery on the Columbia River, it was under license from
the state and also under state law no one would have the right
to come on his land anyway to fish.

Winans argued that all

the treaty means is that Indians must obey all the fishing lava?,
of the state, and if they do they can then continue to fish,
but that they have no special treaty rights,

And Win&ns

argued this ease of Ward v. Racehorse, that had been decided
seven or eight years before that, and that. Mr. Coniff relies
on.
He said fch® treaty may have been fine for the old
days, but when Washington came into the state, these Indians
lost any special right that they had prior to that time.

And

this Court strongly rejected both of those arguments in the
Winans case.
The Court explained that the right to fish was part
of the rights, and I quote here, ’’not much less necessary to
the Indians than the atmosphere they breath."

The Court said

in ceding most of their land, they did not cede, their fishing

30
rights, but only limited• them to be no longer ercluslee,

r-

that to interpret, those rights retained as giving them nothin*
more than they would have without the treaty would be, in the
words of the Court, "an impotent outcome to negotiation.?, and
a convention that would seem to promise more and to give the
word of the Nation for more.*
She Court also said the right is intended to be con­
tinuing- against the United States and its grantees, as well
as against the state and its grantees,
And then Tulee v„ Washington, in 1942, Justice Slack,
if it please the Court, in the same vein, strongly supported
the specialness of these Indian fishing rights and their
right to fish even without paying for a commercial fishing
license.

Tht

was argued to the Court as a conservation

requirement, to have them pay the commercial fishing license.
Justice Black said even though this method may be both con­
venient and in its general impact fair, it acts upon the
Indians as a charge for exercising the very right their
ancestors intended to preserve.

It cannot be reconciled with

a fair construction of the treaty.

We therefore hold that

the state is invalid as applied in this case.
Now, Justice Douglas, in the prior Phuyallup case,
cited both of those casas with approval.

He stated that --

the Court stated that it would not say that the fishing regu­
lation had to be indispensable for conservation but that it

31
would, say that ifc had to be necessary for conservation and it
couldn't discriminate against'the Indians, and then remanded
the case for trial on the issue of whether these regulations
were unnecessary,,
Q

The State Suprema Court did that, and we af­

firmed?
MR. SACHSE:
Q

That's correct.

This court affirmed.

MR. SACSSE:
Q

That’s correct.

We didn't remand it to the Stats Supreme Court,

we affirmed —
MR. SACHSE:

You affirmed and remanded for trial on

the merits on the question of whether the regulations were

necessary for conservation and did not discriminate against
the Indians.
Now, I would like to get to that trial.

To start

with, when the case was remanded, the Department of Fisheries
immediately changed its position.

Fisheries had argued that

you couldn’t have a net fishery for any fish in the Puyallup
River.

Fisheries changed its — and they had argued it on

this basis:

They said you can’t have a fishery -where the fish

spawn, and you can't have a fishery where the fish are milling
about and the same fish will be fished over and. over, and it
is that language that the Court -quoted, that you can't have
this fishery where the fish are milling about over and over.

32
Well, the Department of Fisheries; did a reasonable
thing, they said we will prohibit the fishery -it the mouth of
the river, where the fish mill over and over and over,- and we
will prohibit the fishery twenty miles upstream where the fish
are actually spawning and where people are waiting around
there with nets would be destructive to the fish.

But'in the

middle area, we will permit & limited net fishery for salmon.
There is still a dispute between the tribe and the Department
of Fisheries as to hew big that fishery ought to be, but
there is no dispute —
Q

Salmon, that is not before us.

MR. SACHS®:

That is for salmon and it is; not before

the Court, but it does indicate that the net fishery can
properly

be managed in that river.
Q

Well, at least for salmon?

MR. SACHSE:
Q

At least for salmon.

Yes.

MR. SACHSE:

There are at least a dozen statements

in the record that there is no significant difference in the
management of nets and so forth for salmon or stfeelhead,

The

steelhead are very much like salmon in all their habits.

There

are statements that the steelhead is a smaller run.
Q

The size of the population might he quits dif­

ferent in any given stream1 —
MR. SACHSE:

That's right.

33
Q

between the two species?

MR „ •SACHSB:

That's right.

Now#, the -siae .of the. stoelhead population in this
stream has been sufficient every year in recent yoasr —Q

Mr. Sachse, are you asking us to make a review

of the state court's findings on facts?
MR. SACHSB:

No# what I am asking you to do is to

affirm the state trial court’s findings of fact and to reverse
the State Supreme Court’s reversal of the trial court’s
findings.
Q

Nell# what test do we apply here when the

Supreme Court of Washington has reversed on a factual ground
the Superior Court?
MR. SACHSB:

They haven’t reversed on a factual ground,

They have reversed on a misunderstanding of the law, and I think
I can show it to you very simply.
Q

Well, if it. is a misunderstanding of law, why is

it necessary for you to get into all the testimony below as to
whether#.you know, the milling and that sort of thing# if it is
strictly a point of law?
MR. SACHSB:

Well# I just want the Court to undor~

stand that w® are not proposing something that is detrimental
to the fish in that area or that has to do with conservation;
that what we are talking about is whether the state has the
right to appropriate the fish first for sports fishermen and

totally exclude the traditional Indian fishery.
Q
year?

Well, isn't that actually what they did for ora

Isn’t that what you are saying?
MR. SACHSE:

No, I*ia not, because the Supreme Court

of the State of Washington set up a standard that has assured
that every year since then that the Indian fishing will also be
prohibited, and that has occurred in each year since then.
Q

I see.

MR. SACHSE:
Q

And let me show you —

I thought the standard they set up indicatae —

I thought the standard they set up for future years would be
based on what was necessary for conservation.

I guess it is —

I guess it would bo if you said that they had to supply a
sports fishery.
MR. SACHSE:

Let me give you two

answer this graphically for you.

I think I can

The findings of fact of the

trial court were that 15,000 to 13,000 fish were being taken
per year by sports fishermen.
Q

Now, we are talking about steelhead, are we not?

MR. SACHSE:

Steelhead.

I am talking only about

steelhead.
Q

Exclusively, are we not?

MR. SACHSE:
Q

Yes, sir.

1 thought so.

MR. SACHSE:

Steelhead

Q

At least that is what you are talking about.

MR. SACHSE:

That is what I am talking sheet.

tee­

the most succinct statement is in the opinion of the trialcourt.

It says, "In view of the large number of steeahead

caught in the Puyallup River, it would seem the department is
not in a position to say the Indians can be entirely excluded
from the exercise of any special right."
0

Right.

MR. SACHSE:

Okay.

Now, the Supreme Court of

Washington reversed —
Q

Such as a commercial fishery?

MR. SACHSE:
0

Sir?

Such as a commercial fishery?

MR. SACHSE:

As a commercial fishery or a fishery for

their own —- yes, such as a commercial fishery.
Supreme Court reversed that.

The Washington

They didn't reverse the findings

— they didn’t argue with the findings that 13,000 to 18,009
fish are being taken each year by sports fishermen.

What they

said is the catch of the steelhe&d sports fishery alone in the
Puyallup River leaves no more than a sufficient number of
steelhead for escapement necessary for the conservation of the
steelhead fishery in the river.

And so they reversed the

lower court, upheld the prohibition of fishing for steelhead
with net, and said that until — each year this will be
reviewed, and whan there are enough left over after the sports

36
fishermen are through, the Indians can come in and if tha
Department of Game says there are enough r trie Indians can fin;!.
for those.
Q

Mow,, where do you find that language?

tion hare.
MR* SACHSS:

MR. SACHSE:
Q

Okay.

I will find it.

Well, if that is about where it is — X think

what —
MR. SACHSE:

It is Finding No, 4, page S73, it is in

this —
Q

I see it now.

But the holding was, wasn't it,

only, as Justice White has suggested, back on page 571, under
Finding 4, the second paragraph, ”We are satisfied from the
record in the present cess, however, that a regulation of
authorizing an Indian net fishery for steelhead for the year

1970 in the Puyallup River would have been destructive to the
conservation of th-a steelhead fishery, and the Department of

37
Game's contention that there should he no coroner cie l fishviT in
the Puyallup River for, stealhead, should be sustained for that
year.”

That is tha holding in this —
HR. SACHSE:
Q

— with respect to stealhead.

MR. SACHSE:
Q

That is the holding in this case.

That is the holding in this case.

That’s it.

MR. SACHSE:

That is the holding of the Supreme Court

of the State of Washington in this case, but the Supreme Court
clearly established, the Supreme Court of the State of
Washington clearly established a priority for sports fisherme.
in deciding whether an Indian fishery can be allowed in the
Puyallup River, and they established that priority in section
4 of —
0

It is all there.

That is what you are quarrel­

ing about?
MR. SACHSE:

That is what we are qua.rreli.ng about,

and wo are also — 1 think you can see why we are quarreling
about it, because the Department of Gams of the Stab© of
Washington still contests the rights of the Indians to have
any fishery there at all.
Q

You don't attack the finding that if you take

into consideration the number of fish that are caught in tha
sporting business, that to allow the commercial fishery will
endanger the run?

As long as you accept that many fish taken

38
by the sporting industry,, the Supreme Court is quit* right in
saying that a commercial fishery can't be allorad.

You don't

contest that, do you?
MR. SACHSE;

I don't know about that.

The evidence

doesn't show one way or another as to —Q

Well, that is what the court found.

Q

It is a, fact.

MR. SACK51!:
Q

Well, the Court found that —

As a fact.

And let’s assume you accept that

fact, now your real argument is that the sports industry should
not b© able to take that many fish if it means cutting the
Indians out of a commercial fishery.
MR. SACHSE:

That’s correct.

My real argument is

that this treaty provided the Indians with an off-reservation
fishing right beyond the simpla fishing of other people in the.
state, that the treaty should be interpreted in terms of its
meaning in context, which was that these people would be able
to sort?© extent support themselves and feed themselves from
these fishing rights.
Q

And the treaty makes it incumbent upon the state

to cut down the volume of sports fishery?
MR. SACHSE:
Q

That's correct.

So long as the facts remain as they are.

Is

that it?
MR., SACHSE:

That's right, that they can’t take the

33

entire harvestable fishery here and devote it entirely to a
sports fishery to the detriment of the Indians who fish here.
0

I suppose yon would concede that Washington

could, if we-agreed with yen, cease putting steelhead in the
river?
MR, SACHSE:

I have no quarrel with that at all.

And

I wish to point out also that the federal government has a
large fishery development program in connection with Indians
and Indian reservations just in general,, and that the federal
government also plants fish in rivers, though not in the
Puyallup.

And if the state wanted to stop planting fish in

the Puyallup, the federal government very likely would start
planting fish —
Q

But then 1 suppose, Mr.'Sachs©, that what is

necessary to conserve the runs might be considerably different
than what is necessary when the fish is putting in '61 percent
of the fish that are caught?
MR. SACHSE:

To this extent, that it makes a larger

run, it makes a larger harvest able amount., and to take that
harvestable amount and give a preference to sports 'fisherman
for that harvestable amount in an area where the Indians have
traditionally fished and where they have relied on fishing as
part of their life is contrary to this treaty.
Q

Is there anything in the record to indicate

what sise of a commercial fishery the Indians are talking about

or desire to conduct?
MR. SACHSE:
desire to conduct.

Thar® is nothing as to the second part,

There is evidence as to a few years

on salmon when the Indians had a large —
Q

Well, have they ever had —

MR. SACHSE:

— but there is no evidence as to the

sise of commercial fishery on —
Q

They have never had a commercial steelhead

fishery, you say?
MR. SACHSE:

As far as I know they fished steelhead

mainly for their own sustenance, and there is no —
Q

But there has never been a commercial steelhead

fishery'on the Puyallup?
MR. SACHSE:

I can’t say that because there are on

the Quinaielt reservation, for instance, there is a commerciaX
steelhead fishery and sports fishery that are conducted
together by the tribe.
0

But in hearing, in order to find that the

Indians couldn't be allowed to run a sports fishery, there must
have been some evidence put in by the Indians as to what kind
of a sports fishery — commercial fishery they were i talking
about.
MR. SACHSE:

Let me say this, that the Indians

traditionally and to this day don’t make much of a distinction
between steelhead and salmon.

Steelhead is Salmo gaipdnerii,

the big fish like salmon, and it is fished
the eonsaareial markets, the steelhead too-

!•,?!?.£ way in.
But fchsrce in no

solid evidence as to what the Indians would want if- for
instance, they were allowed to fish legally for those fish.
Now 1 should say this:

We are not asking this Court

to determine how many fish the- Indians should got and • how
many fish the aports fishermen should get,

inhere is another

case under way in the District Court, Federal District Court
in the State of Washington, called United Statea v, Wmhingfcon,
where the attempt is somehow to quantify the fishing rights of
the Indians.

It deals primarily with salmon but it al~o

deal with the steelhead issue.

gst-

There is a very big record

there.
But what does seem clear to us is that, in

ror

the 1970 regulations, every regulation since then, based on.
this conclusion of the Supreme Court of Washington, that the

sports fishermen have to come first, that the Indians are
being deprived of their share fo the fishing for csteslhead in

that stream ~0

You don’t claim discrimination against the

Indians here, do you?

MR. SACHS'S:

I claim a discrimination against tl-nir

treaty rights, a denial of their treaty rights.
0

A denial of their treaty rights —

MR. SACHSE:

But there is a discrimination, too, end

I do claim it, and I want to make this clear.
fish in the rivers and there is

The Indians

I don’t want

to get into

the record on this — part of the reason is they don’t have
the money to go out and fish deepsea fishing * and toe

.te

has evidence it would cost $122 per fish fco catch v. atralher
as a sports fisherman.

They don’t have that kind of money.

And they have always fished near where they live it the river
where they can fish on a rather occasional basis, often after
«.i*

they come back from what other job they may have, and it is a
discrimination against the Indians.
Q

But it is not as if the Stats of Washington

were saying to a white man that you can fish commercially but
the Indians can’t.
MR. SACHSE:
Q

Wo.

The regulation applies across the benrd.

MR. SACHSE:

It is like this.

It is like this:

If

all the black people lived in a particular n@lgb.bood and the
whits people lived in a different neighborhood, and the Court
said in this black neighborhood nobody can work in his yard,
in this neighborhood nobody

can work in — nobody can. have

a. business, in the other neighborhood you can.
could find that there is a discrimination there.

I think you
The fishing

has been prohibited in the place where Indians fished, and it
is deliberate.
Q

It is deliberate.
But it is not just a place, it is a manner of

fishing that has been prohibited-, isn't it?

Do you understand that?

MR. SACHSE:

That is correct?

Yes, sir.

You say, on the other hand, that the Supreme

Court of Washington was basically correct, but that they erred
in giving total priority to game fishing and in their approach
that if and-only if there were enough left over after the gam.-

fishermen got all the fish they wanted, only then could the
Indians do any commercial fishing, and that that was wrong.

Thank you, Mr. Sachs©.

Mr. Attorney General, you have got'about three
minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. COMIFF, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GAME OF THE STATE
OF WASHINGTON
MR. CONIFF:

Thank you.

I will be vary brief, Mr.

Chief Justice.'
The first point I would like to make is that steelhead, as a game fish, may only b© taken with hook and line in
waters in the State of Washington.

Thera is no salt water or

marine commercial fishery for this species and no sports

$5
fishery to any substantial extent at all occurs in salt water,
therefore the only place where steelhead my be taken under
state law is by hook and line in fresh water streams at the
very-same locations where these. Indians are claiming rights to
put commercial nets,
0

Your own State Supreme Court didn't eoek to

modify that, did it?
MR, CONXFF:
that is a fact.

No,

I am merely advising the Court tha

That is where the fishery occurs.

That is

where the sports fishery occurs.
Q

Wall, now you are saying that it is a law that,

steelhead may be only taken by hook and line.

That is not a

fact, that, is a law.
MR, CONIFF:
is where this occurred.

Okay.

In the past, up until now, that

There is no commercial marine fishery

these are not commercial fish, there is no commercial market
for steelhead in the State of Washington.

They are & game

fish, and X wanted to make that point.
Tha second point is, I wanted to just simply briefly
reemphasise Mescalero-Ward v. Racehorse as a part of the
reading of the equal protection concepts implicit in the
treaty language.
Q
was correct?

Bo you think Judge Hale's dissenting opinion
Is that right?

MR, CONIFF:

That is correct, and I agree with the

46
statements made by counsel, the way the issues rre delineated
before the court,
Q

Okay.

Q

Well, what was wrong with what the Supreme

Court said?
MR. CONIFF:
Q

X don’t believe —

Basically?

MR. CONIFP:

Okay.

The basic way that they were

wrong is that they are allowing the Director of the Department
of Fisheries to set special Indian only seasons for commercial
harvest of fish in off-reservation waters, contrary to the
treaty language.
Q

They are wrong even though they never did that,

because of the fish?
MR. CONIFF:
Q

I'm sorry, I don’t understand.

Hav§ they ever set a special Indian season?

MR. CONIFF:

The Department of Fisheries has, not

the Department of Game.
Q

Nell, have they set a special season?

MR. CONIFF:
Q

Mot for steelhead?

MR. CONIFF;
0

Yes, they have in a number of rivers.

Not for steelhead,

Steelhead are a —

That is what I mean.

MR. CONIFF:

Steelhead are under Game's jurisdiction,

and the salmon, are under the Fisheries’ jurisdiction under

47
state law»
Q

Right.

Q

How was the Supreme Court wrong with respect to

steelhead?
MR» CONIFF:

With respect to steelhead, it imposed

an additional, burden upon the Washington Department of Gama in
that it has to demonstrate annually that it is —*
Q

You have been able to do that every year?

Q

You succeeded in carrying out that burden every

year, beginning in 1970?
•MR» COMIFF:

Under a whole series of court challenges,

and that leads me to the final point'! would like to make.
Q

But the only way you have been able•to carry it

is because you have to — because you say that yon must satisfy
the sports fishery?
MR. CONIFF;

Under the language of the opinion that

it indicates that a sports fishery being a very inefficient
fishery, a hook and line as opposed to a net, would be
satisfied, and then if it can be demonstrated there is a surplus,
at that point it is then incumbent under the state of the law
under the opinion below, to establish a special commareial
season on game fish, steelhead, in the State of Washington.
I wanted to point out, there is no discrimination
under state law in off-reservation areas.

There is — there

has bean a great deal of civil unrest in the state, a great

4a
deal of confrontations, riverbank shoot-out3,

If you will.

Our Game Department headquarters have oven been taken, over,
offices ransacked and so forth, and I merely pnint out that
in light of these facts, and in light of the fact that there
are a number of pending cases, including U*S. v. Washington,
that there is a definite need for clarification beyond that
given us by the Supreme Court of the Stata of Washington.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The ciise is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 2:20 o’clock p.m., the case was
submitted.]
