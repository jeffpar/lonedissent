PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear

arguments now in docket No. 72-671, Cecilia Espinoza and
Rodolfo Espinoza versus Farah Manufacturing Company, Inc.
Mr. Cooper, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE COOPER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
HR. COOPER:

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
With me today is my co-counsel in this case,
Mr. Ruben Montemayor, of San Antonio, Texas.
The Petitioner in this case, Mrs, Espinosa, is a
lawfully admitted, permanent resident alien of the United
States.

She is married to an American citizen and has two

children who are American citizens .

She applied for a job

and was denied the job solely because she, herself, is not a
citizen of the United States and at Issue in this case is
whether this form of exclusion, of discrimination against
Mrs. Espinoza, is prohibited by federal civil rights acts.
The primary construction to be made in this case
is whether the national origin discrimination prohibition in
Title 7 applies to bar this form of exclusion.
In beginning the argument, your Honors, I would
like to clarify exactly what our position is and remove some
distractions from the case.

4
First of ail, it should be clear that there is no
question whatever that aliens, as persons or individuals,
are, In fact, protected by Title ?.
not limited to citizens.
well.

The scope of Title 7 is

It Includes aliens, noncitizens as

The only question is, what they are protected against.
Second, your Honors, and this is most important

because it is an element of confusion in the case for many
persons, myself for a long time included.
It is not necessary for the Court, in ruling in our
favor on the Title 7 argument — it is not necessary for this
Court to find that discrimination on grounds of citizenship
or nationality is, in

its ovin terms, prohibited by Title 7*

Our basic position is that citizenship discrimination is
prohibited.
Our basic position is that Title 7 bars national
origin discrimination and that phrase should be interpreted to
cover any nonmerit-related discrimination on any ground which
relates to national origin and nationality so relates.
Nationality is nonrelated to merit in performing a job.

It is

related to national origin and therefore, discrimination on
grounds of nationality should be interpreted as covered by
Title 7.
this case.

But we do not press your Honors to go that far in
It is not necessary because whether or not Title 7,

the national origin phrase in Title 7 — whether or not that
is interpreted to include nationality, it

should be clear

that the citizenship requirement for Farah is a requirement
which has a discriminatory impact in terms of national
origin.

The citizenship requirement is, like the test or
diploma
high school/requirement that was before this Court in Gripes
against Duke Power* Company is a standard which, although it
may be neutral on its face, is a. standard which has a definite
and decided adverse impact in national origin terms and that
impact alone is ample to cause the citizenship standard to
be declared unlawful.
There are two ways in which the citizenship
requirement has this adverse effect in national origin terms.
First, it has an adverse impact directly
related

to a person’s place of birth.

One aspect of

national origin, taking the term ’’national origin11 simply and
literally,

one aspect of someone’s national origin is where

they, themselves, are born.
The Respondents apparently deny or ignore that
fact and say that national origin means ethnic origin but
the statute doesn’t say that.
"ethnic origins."

The statute doesn't say

There is nothing in the legislative history

of the statute that says "ethnic origins."

The statute says

"national origins" and there are various aspects of national
origins.

One aspect of a person’s national

origin is

where his ancestors, his forebears, come from, his ethnic
origin.

Buat another aspect of an individual’s national

6
origin is where he, himself, comes from and if an employer
discriminates against an Individual because of his birthplace,
he is discriminating in national origin terms and his acts
should be prohibited by the statute.
Now, Parah Manufacturing Company has not gone so
far as to openly and clearly dj scriminate in terms of place of
birth.

We admit that.

They don't say, "We hire only people

born in the United States and no one born abroad."

If they

had said that, I think the case would be easy and —
Q
this country.

They do have quite a few who weren't born in
Isn't that true?

MR. COOPER:

Yes, your Honor, most of the Parah

employees are born in this country.
Q

They do have some —

But they have a sizeable number.

MR. COOPER:

Yes, your Honor, most of the Parah

employees are born in this country but they don't restrict
their employment to only persons born in this country.

They

restrict the employment to citizens and, of course, some
citizens are persons who were born abroad but that doesn't
alter the fact that the citizenship requirement is a
requirement which has a definite, clear, marked, decided,
adverse impact in terms of a person's place of birth.
If you were born in one place, the United States,
the citizenship .requirement is, essentially, meaningless to
you.

Your citizenship has been handed to you by virtue of

7
your birth.

But if you were born any other place but in the

United States, you must undergo a serious and restrictive
and difficult process to gain citizenship, the process of
naturalization and any standard which imposes a harsher,
more difficult burden on persons because of their place of
birth is a standard which has a discriminatory impact in
terms of the individual’s national origin.
Q

Mr. Cooper?

MR. COOPER:
Q

Yes?

If Parah took the position that it would

confine its employment to persons bom in Texas, would you
be here?
MR. COOPER:

To persons born in Texas, your

Honor?
Q

born In Texas.

Mil. COOPER:

Well, that would not relate to

national origin in terms of the way it excluded other people
from other parts of the United .States, but it would relate
to national origin in terms of discriminating against persons
of foreign birth and you would have to assess the national
origin impact of that.
Is the impact of a Texas restriction a
restriction which has a harsher effect on the foreign-born
than the American born?
would have to pursue.

That would be a question which we
I am not sure what the facts would

8
show.

But it is quite clear that the citizenship requirement

is a requirement which imposes a very differential burden on
the American-born as compared to the foreign-born.

It is just

like the test in the Griggs caseThe test was one which was
given to whites and blacks.

It didn’t exclude all blacks,

just like the citizenship requirement doesn’t exclude all
foreign-born persons.

But the test was one which the blacks

had a more difficult time passing.

The test was something

which operated as a built-in headwind against the blacks and
it is that built-in headwind, making it mere difficult in
practice for blacks than whites to get jobs which caused the
test to be declared unlawful in Griggs and so, too, the
citizenship requirement which makes it more difficult for the
foreign-born to get a job than for the native-born to get a
job, is the discrimination — is a standard which has a
discriminatory Impact in national origin terms, to the extent
that national origin relates to an individual birthplace.
We think that point is simple and clear and that,
alone, is sufficient grounds to sustain us, your Honors.
But if there are no questions on that point, let
me go into our second point.

That is that even if the Court

wishes to ignore this discrimination in terms of place of
birth, which is the effect of the citizenship rule, if the
Court wants, instead, merely to look at ethnic discrimination,
which is what the Respondents urge, nontheless, the

9
citizensnip requirement has a discriminatory impact, a
discriminatory effect in terms of an individual’s ethnic
background.
The citizenship requirement does not, in practice
and effect, apply to all ethnic groups equally.
imposes a harsher burden on some

Rather, it

ethnic groups than on other

ethnic groups, which groups —
Q

What group are you talking about?

The ethnic

group, is not a citizen?
j-IR. COOPER:
from time to time.

Your Honor, the

ethnic group changes

The etlmic group which is most harshly

affected by a citizenship requirement is the ethnic group at
a particular time and place which is most heavily made up of
recent immigrants.
Q

In Boston, in 1850, the ethnic group —

We are not talking about l8’30, we are talking

about now.
iIR. COOPER:
Q

Wow, —

What is your ethnic group that you are

t a .Iking about now?
MR. COOPER:
Q

Yes, your Honor.

You are talking about foreign people who

haven’t been naturalized.
i-ISi. COOPER:
Q

Your Honor, in terms of —

As contrasted to foreign people who have

been naturalized and you are going to break those up into

10

two separate ethnic groups?
MR. COOPER:
Q

No, your Honor.

Mo, your Honor.

I hope you don’t try.

HR. COOPER:

Mo, your Honor.

The two separate

ethnic groups, if we are talking in ethnic terms, without
regard to birthplace, the different ethnic groups are Mexican
on the one hand, Polish on the other hand, Italian on the
other hand, those ethnic — when I‘m talking ethnic groups,
X am talking in those terms now.

If one wants to look at that

aspect of national origin and, again, remember that that is
only one aspect of national origini it is our basic position
that there is more than one aspect and birthplace is a
separate, independent aspect, but If you want to look at
ethnic background, that aspect of national origin, the
citizenship requirement .in Texas right now, primarily hurts
Mexicans.

In San Francisco, it primarily hurts orientals and

Mexicans,

In Boston in 1850, it vfould have primarily hurt

the Irish.

In each case, the citizenship —
Q

And the basis for the fact that it affects

Mexicans right now is what?
!:IR. COOPER:

Because the ethnic group which is

most heavily represented in the noncitizen, category, the
ethnic group which is most heavily made up of recent Immi­
grants in Texas right now is xlexlcans.

Eighty percent of the

alien residents in San Antonio, 70 to 80 percent, are

11
Mexicans.
Q

Well, why —

MR. COOPER:

So if you impose an anti-alien rule,

the primary people you hurt are the Mexicans and that will
always be the case.
Q

You only hurt the Mexicans who aren't

naturalized.
MR. COOPER:

Yes, your Honor, you only hurt the

Mexicans who aren't naturalized.

That's right.

In each case,

you only hurt the people who aren't naturalized, but what's
the effect of the rule?
In the Griggs case, the only people you hurt were
the blacks who couldn't pass the test but that wasn't the
way that the Court looked at It.

The Court said — to the

extent that —
Q

Well, you don't restrict this to those who

didn't pass for naturalization, you restricted it to those
who didn't bother to take it.
MR. COOPER:

Well, your Honor, there are two rea­

sons that people aren't naturalized.
don't bother to do it.

One is because they

The other is because they can't do it,

and there are many reasons why they can't do it, starting
from the fact that you may not have been in the country
long enough —
Q

Do

you have any of that in this case?

Is

12
there any reason why this particular person couldn’t be
naturalized?
MB* COOPER:

Yes, your Honor, she doesn’t speak

English and one of the requirements for naturalization is
that —
Q

You don’t have to tell me that, that you have

to speak English.
MR. COOPER:
Q

Yes.

But she can learn English.

MR. COOPER:
English.

Yes, and she has not yet learned

The record indicates she is in the process of

trying to learn English.

She is in the process of pursuing

citizenship but she has not acquired the ability to pursue
citizenship.
English.

But she is not the only person who can't speak

There are many people who are U.S. citizens who

can’t speak English.

The U.S. citizens from Puerto Rico,

most of them, many of them, can’t speak English.

The mere

fact that you can’t speak English doesn’t necessarily preclude
you from being a citizen, unless you were born abroad, and it
certainly doesn’t have anything to do with this job, here.
The important fact is that —
Q

Doesn’t have anything to do with this job?

MR. COOPER:
Q

Yes.

Yes, your Honor.

I thought you said "any job."

MR. COOPER:

llo, it doesn’t have anything to do

13
with this job and that .is, of course, crucial.
To the extent that the citizenship requirement is
unlawful because of its discriminatory impact, discriminatory
effects, we don’t say that it is per se unlawful.

We say,

rather, that it is unlawful unless the particular employer
can show some job-relate-dness to it and in this case there is
not the slightest suggestion that being a citizen or speaking
English or being anything else with regard to citizenship has
anything to do with the job which is running a sewing machine
in a pants factory.
In terms of ethnic discrimination, again, the point
is, your Honors, that in each case the effect of a citizenship
requirement will be to discriminate against

the particular

group which predominates in the alien population at the time
and that is the group which, at the time, is most vulnerable
to national origin discrimination.
The use of a citizenship requirement mirrors the
national origin discrimination in the country at the particular
time and because of that, because the effect of the citizen­
ship requirement is to single out and have primary impact on
the particular group which is primarily recent immigrants at
the particular time, the effect of it is to impose a
disproportionate burden on certain ethnic groups, the most
vulnerable ethnic groups of the time and place and that impact
also makes — also causes national origin discrimination.

’Wow, your Honors, in response to these two
arguments on our part, the arguments that the citizenship
requirement is a test, a standard, which has discriminatory
effects in terms of place of birth, singles out American-born
people and favors them as compared to foreign-born people or
the fact that it singles out long-time established ethnic
groups and prefers them to recent immigrant and

ethnic

groups, the only —
Q

Does this particular person have a special

preference under present statutes because she is married to
an American national?
MR, COOPER:

Yes, your Honor, in terms of being,

able to become a permanent resident alien, there are various
ways in which you can do that.
Q

The way in which —

Well, is there a truncated procedure to

become a naturalized citizen also?
MR. COOPER:

No, your Honor.

No, your Honor.

She has to meet the same requirements for citizenship —
Q

The same requirements, but aren't there

some time differences?
It's a shorter process, isn't it?
MR.COOPER:

There may be some modifications in the

process because of the fact that she acquired her permanent
residence status through her marriage to an American citizen.

Q

Her marriage, yes.

15
But she Is not exempted from the learning of history
requirements, from the English language requirements end
those requirements of citizenship.
The only response which the Respondent has to our
claims that the citizenship requirement is a standard which
has adverse special extra effects on people born abroad,
special burdens on the foreign born, or on certain ethnic
groups, the recent immigrant ethnic groups, the only response
they have to that is to say, well, that may be true that that
form of discrimination is unlawful in some cases, that
discriminatory effect, but it is not unlawful in our case
because we hire a lot of Mexicans.

We hire a lot of Mexicans

who are citizens.
There are
inadequate.

several reasons why that answer is

First of all, to the extent that the unlawful

aspect of the discrimination is its special burden on the
foreign-born, its differential treatment of the foreign-born
as compared to the American-born, the hiring of Mexicans who
are American-born is no defense at all.

That is essentially

an irrelevant ansv/er.
Now, if we turn to the second way of looking at the
case, analyzing it in terms of the

ethnic effect rather than

the birthplace effect, it is also not a sufficient answer to
say, "We hire a lot of Mexicans," because the Respondent has
not established, first of all, that his hiring of a lot of

16
Mexicans means that he hires other ethnic groups which may
be adversely affected by the citizenship requirement.
Second, It says nothing about whether or not at
least one more person of Mexican background might not have
been hired, had he not imposed thi3 citizenship requirement
and that is all it takes, your Honors.

All it takes is the

possibility that one more Mexican might have been hired.
That is all it takes to justify holding the standard
unlawful because we are not here talking about any kind of
standard which has anything whatsoever to do with jobrelatedness, merit or ability.

We are talking about a

wholly arbitrary standard which the employer has not
attempted to justify at all and even a de minimus
discriminatory effect should be enough to declare that kind
of requirement unlawful.
So, for those two reasons, the discriminatory
effect, the special burden which is imposed on the foreignborn and also, because of the

discriminatory effect and

special burden that this imposes on recent immigrant groups,
the citizenship requirement should be declared unlawful under
the general standard of the Griggs against Duke Power Company
case that any special requirement or hurdle which is non-job
related, should be declared —
Q

The second "inevitable effect," as you call

it, is demonstrably not present In this case, is it?

The

17
first one may be, I grant you,
HR. COOPER:

The first one clearly is, yes, sir.

How, the second one is not present to an obvious extent.
may be present.

We don’t know how many Mexicans.

It

We do know

that the company employs more than 90 percent Mexicans.
Q

Nintey-seven, 96 percent.

MR, COOPER:
do know that,

It varies from plant to plant.

We

but we don’t know whether there might have

been one more Mexican, without this discriminatory effect.
The same kind of argument —
Q

And the person, as I understand it, I

remember this from the briefs, which I read, perhaps, a month
ago, that the person actually hired in lieu of this person
\vas someone of Mexican descent?
MR. COOPER:

No, your IlOnor, the Respondent has

claimed that, but there is, in fact, no credible evidence in
the record to support that.
Q

The only thing in the record —

But the probability would be that it would be

true, based on that 96 or 97 percent.
MR. COOPER:

Oh, yes, your Honor, the probability

the probabilities are clearly true.

But the same kind of

issue was presented to this Court in the Phillips versus
Martin-Marietta case, the case involving sex discrimination
against women with small children.

The employer in that

case said, well, he admitted that his requirement had a

18
discriminatory effect on women, but he then went on to point
out that he hired 70 to 80 percent women and therefore, he
more than made up for whatever discriminatory effect he might
have caused and the Court essentially ignored that argument
and properly so because it is not — it is
“quota defense" argument.

what I call the

I can discriminate so long as I

make up for it with 3ome other positive discrimination.

That

is an argument which seems to us to be inconsistent with the
basic purposes of Title 7 to bring about the hiring of
individuals on the basis of their

own merit and not on the

basis of quotas.
But, as Mr. Justice Stewart correctly points out,
to the extent we are talking about the first effect, the
effect in terms of birthplace, it is quite clear that the
hiring of Mexican citizens has nothing to do with that,
And, indeed, most of the Mexicans hired are native
born Mexicans, if we look in terms of birthplace.

There are

very few naturalised Mexicans in San Antonio.
Q

A minute ago you 3aid — is that statement

in the record?
MR. COOPER:
Q

Pardon me?

Is the last statement you made in the record?

MR. COOPER:

The percentage of naturalised

Mexicans as compared to native-born Mexicans in San Antonio?
Q

Umn hmn.

19
There is no data in the record on
that, your Honor.
Q

The census figures are —

Just a minute ago, you said, when the

question was asked you whether this applicant was replaced by
another Mexican, you answered that it wasn’t in the record.
I just wanted to know why you didn’t say one way or the other
either in the record or out of the record?
MR. COOPER:

The data on the percentage of

naturalized citizens, the data on the percentage of Mexicans
and so on is not in the record.

It is derived from the

Census Department figures.
Q

I don't understand what you are thinking.

A

naturalized Mexican-American would have to be somebody born
in Mexico.
MR. COOPER:
0.

That's right.

Or else he wouldn't have needed to be

naturalized.
HR. COOPER:
Q

That's right, your Honor, that's right,.

Well, then, you say that you are distinguishing

between naturalized Mexicans and native-born Mexicans.

What

do you mean by that?
MR. COOPER:
Q
be naturalized.

Ho, no, I’m not —

They are all native-born Mexicans in order to
Otherwise, they'd be native Americans.

MR. COOPER:

Ho, no, the only point I was making

20

was tnatj to the extent that Far ah employs ilexicans —
Q

Yes.

UK. COOPER:

Most of the people who It employs

are probably native-born Mexicans rather than naturalized
Mexicans.
Q

You mean, born in the United States?

HR. COOPER:

Mexicans who — he hires only

citizen Mexicans, I mean, citizens.
Q

A native-born Mexican means somebody who

is born in Mexico.
MR. COOPER:
I'm sorry.

Oh, excuse me— native — excuse me,

I should have stated it differently,

lie hires

primarily Mexicans v;ho are native-born in the United States,
persons of Mexican background, who were born in the United
States.
Q
Oh, I see.
Hit. COOPER:

There is nothing in the record on

that, your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall.
Q

I3ut yet, the probabilities from the population

make-up of the area, according to the Census Bureau —
MR. COOPER:

The Census figures indicate that only

something like 30,000 out of almost 400,000 Mexicans in
San Antonio are foreign-born and that is our basic Title 7
case, your Honor.

We also make an argument under Section

1981 of 42USC and there, of course, the argument is much more
straightforward.

Section 1981 clearly prohibits

discrimination against aliens as compared to citizens.

The

language of the statute is very clear and as to that
argument, we are prepared to rest in our brief.
I would just make one point to the Court —
Q

Was the 1981 argument argued anywhere before

you came here?
HR. COOPER:
I was about to make.
lower courts as such.

No, your Honor, and that is the point
It was not discussed or argued in the
Thehe was reference to Jones against

Mayer, references to things mentioned in the statute, but the
argument was not presented as such and it is relevant to this
case only in — it is relevant to this case in three
different ways.
One, it certainly bears upon the general statutory
provisions with regard to protection of aliens and to that
extent relevant to the construction of Title 7.

That is the

primary purpose here.
Secondly, it does provide an alternative basis
for this Court's decision if tnis Court should wish to go
anead and decide the case on section 1981 and, thirdly, and I
express this only as a caution on our part, if, in fact, the
Court decides against us on the Title 7 grounds and does not
want to reach the 1981 issue, vie just ask that the Court not
take any action which will preclude us from raising the issue
in tiie case on remand because the case is here now

only on a

22
denial of motion only for summary judgment and on remand, the
case will still be alive for further action.
Q
equating the

Your whole case turns, does it not, on
national origin with making out that your client

is being discriminated against because of national origin and
not simply because of the failure to become a naturalized
citizen.
MR. COOPER:

No, your Honor.

No, your Honor.

We

admit that she was discriminated against because of her non­
citizen status.

That is a pro-citizen discrimination.

Our basic point is that nonetheless, since the
effect of discriminating against people because of lack of
citizenship is to Impose a special burden and to make it —
to lay down a built-in headwind for foreign-born people, the
citizenship requirement is unlawful.

The statute, in Griggs,

the statute did not prohibit test requirements.

The

individual in Griggs was denied a job because he failed a
test but the Court went on to say that you can’t deny a
person a job because they failed the test if the test is one
which has a discriminatory impact on protected groups and
so, too, here.

Mrs. Espinosa has been denied a job because of

her lack of citizenship.

Her lack of citizenship is a

neutral requirement but it is a requirement which has a
discriminatory effect on a protected group, the foreign-born,
because the foreign-born are a protected group in terms of

23
national origin discrimination.
Q

Hr. Cooper, you said, your case is here on

denial of summary judgment.

V/as it certified by the district

courts?
MR. COOPER:

No, your Honor, the district court

granted summary judgment.
Q

It granted summary judgment.

MR. COOPER:

The Fifth Circuit reversed and now

this is an appeal from that reversal so if this Court affirms
the Fifth Circuit, the case goes back do^^m to the district
court with the summary judgment denied, in effect.
Q

So you had won a summary judgment?

HR. COOPER:

We had won a summary judgment in the

district court, yes, your Honor.
I think I have —
Q

Would there be anything left to the case?

MR. COOPER:

If the Court rules for us on the

Title 7 grounds or on the 1981 grounds.
Q

Well, how about if it rules against it, and

affirms the court of appeals?
MR. COOPER:

If It rules against us, there is still

an argument to be made on the merits in the district court,
an argument that in this particular case — that Farah’s
citizenship requirement is applied In a discriminatory
fashion and there is also the possibility of Its raising the

24
1981 argument, if the Court chooses not to reach it,
Q

That 1981 argument is not here before us, is

it?
MR. COOPER:

Well, your Honor, it is a variation.

It is a variation on the same theme and I think the Court
could reach it If it wanted but, certainly, the Court would
have good grounds not to reach it if it doesn't want at this
time.
Q

Was this question presented in your petition

to this Court?
MR. COOPER:

Wo, your Honor.

No, your Honor, as I

said, here’s ample reason not to reach it if the Court
chooses not to reach it.
Q

Well, I am just wondering if we can.

It is not a jurisdictional point, is it?
MR. COOPER:

Oh, no, I don't see it as precluded in

jurisdictional terms, no, your Honor.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Carr.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH R. CARR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

It please the Court:
In reading Counsel’s description and particularly
in his brief, of the plight of the American immigrant

in the

l880’s and up to as recently as 45

or 50 years ago, I was

reminded of the remarks of Mr. Justice Frankfurter In the

Sand - Door case in the Carpenter's Local 1976.
Speaking of the secondary boycott problems in
that case, he said that these afford a striking illustration
of the importance that It is the business of Congress to
declare policy and not thi3 Court’s.
The judicial function is confined to applying
what Congress has enacted after ascertaining what it is that
Congress has enacted.

We are presented here with a simple

and narrow question of statutory construction.

That is, In

1964 did — not should, but did Congress intend to halt an
employer’s policy of hiring only United States citizens where
all parties acknowledge that that policy has been applied in
a nondiscriminatory manner?
We think that the history of the Act clearly
demonstrates that Congress had no such intention.
Before discussing the factors before the United
States Congress, we should note that there has been only
one case other than the district court in this case which has
applied national origin in the way that Petitioner’s brief
suggests that it should be applied and that case decided in
9

Petitioner’s brief Is London Borough of Eeling versus Race
Relations Board and there the Queen’s Bench Division applied
precisely the statutory construction to a national origin

26

statute in Great Britain that Petitioner seeks

here.

That decision was reversed by the House of Lords
in 1972 and aside from that one decision, nobody has yet
agreed with Counsel, aside from that one in the District
Court here.
How, what was before the Congress in 1964?

I'd

suggest that the first and most obvious factor before the
Court was the employment practices of the Federal Government
itself.

From 1914 for 50 years, eight or nine consecutive

Presidents, beginning with President Wilson, had required by
Executive Order that in order to sit for a Civil Service
examination, an individual must be a citizen of the United
States.
How, at various tines there were certain very
limited exceptions which I regard at totally irrelevant to
the basic issue here.

For the last 21 of those years,

beginning in 1943 and under Presidents Roosevelt, Truman,
Eisenhower and Kennedy, these same Presidents who reaffirmed
tiie necessity

that a Civil Service applicant must be a

citizen by Executive Order also forbade discrimination
based upon, among other things, national origin.
How, obviously, for 21 years, no one had raised
the contention and no one had suggested to the Congress that
these two policies could not coexist side by side.

This has

been raised in one case that I am aware of since 1964 in
ho San Wong versus Hampton in the northern district of

California in 1971 where a group of Chinese aliens, again
under a statutory construction case sued the chairman of the
Civil Cervice Commission when they were denied the right to
sit for Civil Service examination and they alleged that the
Civil Service rule was in violation of what by then was
statutory Federal Government policy of not discriminating on
the basis of national origin and the judges there said that
there was no problem, that the two statutes, the two policies
could easily coexist.
Q

Is the case now before us the only case that

you know of in the courts involving this question under
Title 7 of the Civil Fights Act of '64?
ME. CARR:

It's the only case I'm aware of, yes,

your Honor.
The next area that was before the Congress when it
was enacting the Civil Rights Act of

1964 was the fact that

according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
some 28 states had enacted Pair Employment Practices legisla­
tion at the time that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was
passed.

The various Pair Employment Practices Co:amissions of

those states in 19 — pardon me, one other factor, virtually
all of these 28 forbade discrimination based interally on
national origin and/or national ancestry.
Of 19 of these State Fair Employment Practices
Commissions had discussed and considered the question of

28
whether, under their policy, an employer could still require
citizenship.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there

at 10:00 in the morning, Mr. Carr.
MR. CARR:

All right, thank you, your Honor.

[Whereupon, at 3:00 o'clock p.m., the Court was
adjourned until 10:00 a.rn. the following morning.]
