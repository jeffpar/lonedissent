MR. CHIEF. JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Ginsburg, you may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID GINSBURG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR, GINSBURG;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to the Fourth
Circuit.

It arises in Logan County, West Virginia.

The

charging statute is Section 241 of 13 US Code, a conspiracy
statute that has been before this Court many times before,
most recently in Guest and Price, and

before that in

Classic

and Williams and Screws.
The central issue, as we understand this case is
whether an alleged conspiracy to cast fraudulent votes in a
state primary election—in this particular case for the office
of a county commissioner of Logan County, West Virginia—states
a federal offense under Section 241.

So far as we are aware,

this question has not yet been ruled upon by this Court.
The government finds in the record a much simpler
case.

It contends that the indictment alleged and the
f

evidence showed two separate conspiracy violations for casting
and counting fraudulent votes, one, for the election of state
and county officers; and the other for the election of

were indicted on January 12, 1971.

The petitioners

The text of the indictment

is in this white brief, -our petition for certiorari to the
Court.
There were five defendants? all of them were state
officials.

William Anderson was Clerk of the County Court of

Logan County.

John Browning, Clerk of the Circuit Court of

Logan County, its intermediate state court.

Ernest "Rad”

Hager was a deputy sheriff of Logan County.

Bernard Smith was

a West Virginia State Senator.

And Earl Tomblin was the

sheriff of Logan County.
Paragraph 6 in the indictment of appendix B states
that the primary election was held in West Virginia on May 12,
1970, for the purpose of nominating candidates for two federal
offices,, the United States Senate and the U. S. representative,
and—-and I quite—“various state and county offices.”
Q

Single ballot?

MR. GXNSBURGs

On the single ballot, Your Honor.

In the context of the trial, the reference to the
federal offices proved irrelevant.

But we take no exception to

this aspect, this statement of fact in the indictment.

Thank you.

MR. GINSBURG;

Paragraph 9 describes the conspiracy.

From May 1, 1970 to January 12» 1971» the date of the filing
of the indictment» the five defendants are said to have
conspired to dilute the vote of qualified voters» secured to
them by the Constitution and laws of the Uni tec! States, to
vote for the aforesaid offices, that is, for the two federal
offices and. the various state and county offices, which are
described in paragraph 6.
Paragraph 10 of the indictment ties the alleged,
conspiracy to a single precinee in Logan County, Mount Gay
precinct that you will hear a good deal about.
that conspiracy violated state law.

It asserts

There is no contest

about that.
The evidence centers around what happened before
and after May 12, 1970 in connection with the voting that
took place at the Mount Gay precinct.
in this case of racial bias.

There are no allegations

There is no charge that voting

rights were in any way d enied or abridged or diluted because
of race or color.

According to the testimony» these-, five defendants,

Now, what was their purpose?

tion for county commissioner of a man named Okey Hager who
headed a slate for various state and local offices.

Okey Hager

was already the incumbent county commissioner, and h® is the
father of Ernest—that is, Red Hager—who is one of the
defendants in this ca.se *
There is testimony that a man named Cecil Elswicfc
who is one of those three people stationed in the Mount Gay
precinct--and

ha was & co-conspirator granted immunity by the

government—cast false and fictitious ballots on the voting
machinas at Mount Gay for the entire Hager slate.

And he got

voters could not be determined except from flie machine telly.

And the five defendants were all

I'fe find no support in the

record for this view.
So far as we can tell» neither Byrd nor Hechler was
on the Hager slate or part of the Hager faction.

And the

alleged conspiracy of theca five defendants was limited to
certain state and county offices» including particularly—
Q

Mr. Ginsburg, when you say the record, are

you referring to the evidence actually introduced at the trial
or to the evidence and the indictment?
MR. GINSBURG:

In the evidence actually introduced

at the trial» Your Honor.
There is • scvrae evidence that Cecil Elswick did cast
unlawful votes for Byro . y 1 Hochief in the Mount Gay precinct.
But we have found no evidence in the record, Your Honor—-and
’we have examined all of *'he government's record references—
/

that Byrd and Hechler were the object of any conspiracy or
that they were on the Hager slate at all.
Q

Was there any impact?

You suggest that there

was no impact whatever with reference to the federal
candidates?

8
ME, 6IHSBUKG:

Yes, I am about to go, Your Honor,

into the statistics of what act
This was a Democratic Party primary,

Byrd and

Hager were important incumbent federal officials seeking
renomination,

They were clearly supported—that is, Byrd and

Hechler—by both factions.

It happens that Neal Scaggo5

slate is in the record„ and there is no candidate for federal
•office on it.

Yet in the 31, precincts that Scaggs won---that

is, out of the 59 reporting precincts in Logan County-•--Byrd
won by over 94 percent and Hechler by over 79 percent.
When we examine the returns for Logan County as a
whole, counting all of the 59 precincts, including those won
by Hager, we find that Byrd won by 95 percent and Hechler by
some 82 percent.

He went up by three percent in the county as

a whole.
Your Honors, it would have been an absolute absurdity
to set up a single precinct out of 59 in Logan County for
Byrd, who was running .statewide*—55 counties in West Virginia,
60 precincts .in the County of Logan~-set up one- precinct for
Byrd or for Hechler,

Hechler had a large congressional

district, including•eight counties.

There was absolutely no

political justification to set up Mount Gay for Byrd ©r He
Hechler,

Whatever conspiracy these defendants may have

entered into, it had absolutely nothing to do with the
candidates for federal office.

For these defendants, the

9

contest was between Scaggsi -ind Hh.gfi-r.

Even tha government ‘ 3

careful to separate Byrd and Hachler from the Hager slate*
There are excerpts from Eiswick's testimony in the government’s
brief»

But each time that Eiswick refers to Byrd and

Hachler, and there are only two references, Your Honors*, in
the two thousand page transcript, ho speaks of helping to win,
and 2 quote/’for the Okey Hager alate” and for Byrd and
Hechler»

Wholly natural because Hager—the Bed Hager who was

one of the defendants in this case also happened to be the
chairman of the county's Democratic Executive Committee.
We simply invite the Court to examine the govern­
ment's transcript references»

Hon© of them, we believe-*"and

r

we have' examined them all—-supports the government’s conclusion
that the Hager slate included Byrd and Hechler or that this
conspiracy was in any way"direcfced toward Byrd and Hechler *
Let us take a look at what happened at the trial»
What was the government’s theory at the trial below in the
district court before

Judge Field?

Again, although the

?

indictment included a reference to federal officials,
j

indicated in the text of the indictment, the esse was tried in
the district court as a conspiracy to secure the Democratic
nomination for comity commissioner for Okey Hager*

nomination of Okey Hager as county judge»

Both as against the state and the officials?

If it had

p roved any case against the federal officials, yes, Your Honor
we would not foe making this argument.
Q

You indicated™™

MR. GIKSBURGs

Q

We indicate* that in our brief„

You suggested a moment ago that the county

party chairman who was part of this is one of the defendants.
MR. GINSBORGs
Q

Ke was indeed.

Is it not on®, of his functions to see to it fcha

the incumbents of the party get the nomination?

MR. G1NSBURG:

Absolutely,,

And 1 would suppose fcha

what this man did was to go out—«that is, Hager, Red Hager as
county chairman—go out and seek support for his candidates,
Q

But tha problem fiat he had here was that he

was getting support in another way, was he not?

MR. GINSBORG:

But not for this purpose.

There is

11
absolutely no evidence in the record, Mr. Chief Justice, that
indicates that the conspiracy was directed to the federal
offices.

They had only one interest.

This was the county

chairman’s job, which was? a very important job in that

county

controlled patronage-was a job of very considerable import
in Logan County.

And this was the

subject of

the conspiracy;,

not. in any way, so fair as the record indicates, anything h&rlag
to do with Byrd and Hechler.

And, as I said before, it would

have been nonsense for these people to proceed to try to set
up a single precinct in a large county for a man running
statewide.

It did not happen.; it could not have happened as

a practical political matter.
What did the Fourth Circuit do with this case?
the authority of Price and Guest, it affirmed.

On

The Fourth

Circuit felt that Section 241—we are presenting to the Court
an issue of interpretation-"-covered the 14th Amendment rights,
including voting rightsf protected by the Equal Protection
Claus®.

In effect, the Fourth Circuit held that'in a primary

whare federal officers were also on. the ballot, a conspiracy to
cast fraudulent ballots for state office in which state
election officials take part results in a denial of equal
protection and violato;? Section 241, even though the conspiracy
was not directed against federal office.
as we see it.

That is the issue

And this is the first case we.find of this sort

that has come before the Court.

12
The question that I am raising and will consider
now is whether Section 241 does cover State voting frauds„
Q

Let us assume, as Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc. suggests,,

that this indictment had centered on fraud in the Federal
action.

I take it you would say that 241 reaches that.
MR. GINSBURG:
Q

I would certainly agree„ sir.

What is the constitutional right there that

would trigger the application of 241?
MR. GXNS8URG:

Article 1» Sections 2 and 4,

Your Honor„
Q

That is the right to vote.

I mean, it provides

for the election?
MR. GIMSBURG:

Yes, the Court has ruled on this

issue and it seems to me clear and settled.
Q

Where has it ruled on it?

MR. GINS burg .•

I beg your pardon?

G • Where has it ruled on that?
MR. GINSBURG;

oh, I. think the Court has dealt with

this before in classic and before Classic in Saylor.
Q

How about Oregon?

MR. GINSBURGs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

So, it is not just an equal protection approach

to 241?
MR. GINSBURG:
Q

Ho.

This is trite substantive right to vote.

13

MR» GIMSBURG:
Q

Exactly so, sir»

You say that is not Involved here» and so

go

to the State?
MR. GIMSBURG s

Exactly rightf and this is what I am

proceeding to consider,, the 14th Amendment aspect of Section.
241 as contrasted with the Article l, Sections 2 and 4 aspects
of 241.
Q

Gray v, Sanders I guess had something to do

with it.
MR. GIMSBURG:

Exactly.

This is a well plowed field.

As the questioning

has already indicated, and every lawyer who has read the
decision knows, that this field is also well mined.
Obviously the Congress did not intend the 1870 Act to apply
to non-Federal elections unless some form of racial
discrimination was involved.

Indeed,, it was convinced in

1870 *— and -the history has shown in many decisions of this
Court —• that at that time the Congress felt that it had
no constitutional authority in this field.

But today we do

not question the existence of constitutional authority.
The question we are submitting to this Court is
whether without congressional sanction, Section 241 should
now by interpretation of this. Court be extended to cover the
Federal policing of State and local elections where racial
discrimination is not shown and is not an. issue.

That X

believe is the central issue in this nase.
So far, in my view, Your Honor, the Courts could
extend Guest and Price to cover Anderson, although the
indictment and the record in this particular case world, I
think, present the Court with troublesome problema a • at i
will come to in a moment»
We urge, however, that the Court leave thr disci •, ion
on Federal policing of State and local elections to tir
States arid to the Congress where again racial bias is not
shown.

And there is ample legal justification for it,.

The

Congress has considered this matter many times before, moat
recently I think in 1957, 1964, and again the Voting Rights
Act of 1965.

The legislative history is fully set forth in

our brief.
There is no need for the Court to expand tha
jurisdiction of the Federal Court into this area which so
far has been reserved to the States.

The authority which

the Government now seeks- from this Court for its prosecuting
attorneys has been deliberately and consistently withheld
by the Congress.

And it is peculiarly the kind of authority

which lends itself to partisan and even geographically
discriminatory political direction.
The States, we submit, must be given a ful]
opportunity to come to grips with these issues of- corruption.
We have seen it in Maryland.

We have seen it in New

Jersey, what has been happening,

tud even in West Virginia

in this particular case, Your Honor, a state Grand Jury had
been called and had come in to session, and it was the U.S.
Attorney, as we understand it, who asked that the State
Grand Jury not be convened and warned that if it were
convened, the Government would seek an injunction to stop
A 4*

Xu»

Now, let me turn for a moment to the indictment
again.
Paragraph 9 of the indictment charged the
defendants with a conspiracy to injure the qualified voters
of Logan County by denying them the right to have their
votes fully counted by having their votes diluted.
Defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, and
the motion was denied on the ground that the indictment
adequately charged the defendants under Section 241.

At

trial the Government sought to prove a conspiracy that had
as its object not the office of Senator or Representative
but County Commissiones:.
The indictment did. not specify the State or county
office which was the object of the conspiracy.

The indict­

ment did not suggest that the five defendants or their three
co-conspirators were acting under color of State law.

It

did not identify the separate constitutional rights which
were allegedly denied.

And, as a practical matter, it failed

16
clearly to inform the defendant?; of the charges agaiusfc
them.

And all of their subsequent. motion.:- for disccvss.vy

and clarification were denied»
it was not until the trial began that the defendant
and their counsel first learned that the alleged conspiracy
involved a State office»

And it was not until the fourth

day of the trial did they know who the unnamed eo^ccnspiratos
were and. where the acts took place.
If in the indictment ---* and this goes to a point f
the question Mr. Justice Brennan asked — th© Government had
at least; separated the two alleged offenses in separate
counts.

The Court and the defendants would have been'in a

position to challenge the legal sufficiency of Section- 241
in its application to Stata and county offices.

And at the

close of the Government's case, the sufficiency of the
evidence in relation to the Federal charge.

This- was hot

done.
Here the Government was in the enviable position
of being able to dafend a motion to dismiss by arguing that
a conspiracy to cast fraudulent votes in a Federal election
clearly stated an offense under Section 241, and then
proceed to try the case on the basis of a conspiracy to cast
votes in an election for local office,

And on appeal the

Government would then, be free to urge affirmance on whatever
basis it felt emerged from the record.

17
Q

Can you not move for judgment of acquittal *t

'■

MR. GINSBURG:

We did move to dismiss, Your Honor.

It was overruled.
Section 241 is a.conspiracy statute which required
no overt act as an element of defense.

I do not have to

bring to the attention of this Court the kinds of problems
which Justice Jackson dealt with and described in his
separate opinion in -feulewitch.
In this indictment, Your Honors, we are defective.
And it was not cured by the evidence brought out in the
trial.

It was substantively and substantially defective,

This gets to the

term willful, this Court said, in that section must be
construed to mean a purpose to deprive a person of a .specific
constitutional right.

Arid then it said that that issue must

be submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions.

AFTERNOON SESSION
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gi'nsburg, are you

going to continue or reserve?
MRo GINSEURG:

I will continue? I will reserve 3

minutes, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;
MR. GINSBURG;

Very well,

We are dealing here with an alleged

voting fraud in Federal and state elections under separate
constitutional provisions.

These ware the facts.

Under

Screws and Price combined, the Government was required to
demonstrate specific intent to violate each of these
provisions.

And the District Court was required to submit

these issues to -the jury under its charge,
Court, of course, failed to do that.

The District

The. indictment failed

to separate the constitutional provisions., and no such
charge was made.
The essential problem was the defect in the indict­
ment, and that obscurity was not cleared by the evidence that
camr.’ in the trial.

If this was a multipla conspiracy, as

the Government contends, then neither the prosecutors nor
the lawyers that tried the case nor the District Court that
heard it nor the Fourth Circuit that reviewed it appreciated
that fact.
I have one final point and that is on the matter
of the relief we have requested.

Under a very broad

20
Section 241 indictment the Government secured a conviction
on the assumption that this Court had already ruled that 241
permits the Government, the Federal Government# to polica
state voting frauds.

In asking this Court to reverse the

judgment below, we are simply asking -the Court not to extend
the jurisdiction of Section 241 to local elections where
no racial fraud is shown,,
But we do recognise — and this in responsa to
questions that Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Rehnquist
asked — we do recognise that the Government might have
presented evidence, if they had any, under the same indict­
ment, showing a conspiracy by these five defendants to cast
fraudulent votes in a Federal election,

It did not do so.

But if the Court concludes that the Government should now
be given a chance to produce such evidence, if it has it,
than we urge "that the decision below be reversed on the
issue of statutory interpretation and remanded for trial
under appropriate instructions on the Federal issue.
Q

Then your real quarrel is not with the indict-

rmnt but With the proof adduced in support of it, is it
not?
MR. GINSBURO:

No* Your Honor, the indictment

failed to separate these two constitutional provisions, and
there was no, evidence submitted in the trial on the Federal

Exactly so, sir,

This is not exactly the position that was taken

MR. GINSBURG;
frank with this Court,

Your Honor, let roe be perfectly
It is quite clear that these issues

are not sought to be brought out in the District Court, .The
case was -tried without reference to it.

It came to the

Court of Appeals. The issue was not briefed in the Court of
Appeals on oral, argument,

There began to he some awareness

that there was a Federal issue and & problem of statutory
interpretation.

But the case was obscure and the issue has

been finally delineated only before this Court.
Q

Mr, Ginsburg, could I ask, as I read the

Court of Appeals5 opinion, they got to this question of
Stata elections and said that 241 covered frauds in State
elections because of an equal protection rational®.

But

they felt compelled to reach that question because of
a.-Indusibility of evidence issue,

Let us assume that this

court said the indictment was wholly proper because it was
a Federal case, a Federal election.

But than could you avoid the state
Or is everything tainted by the fact, that

there was an evidentiary question here, an admissibility ci:
evidence question?
MR. GINSBURGs: It seems to me that there is
essentially for this Court, as far as we have been able te
analyse the case — and the record, as you have indicated,
is obscure — is that the Fourth Circuit really did rule on
the issue of statutory interpretation,, and it extended your
decisions in Price,
0

But it did so in the name of passing on an

admissibility of evidence question.
MR. GXNSBURG?
Your Honor.

We failed to appreciate that point.

I think, Your Honor, that the issue to which

you have reference arises in this fashion.

There was an

argument before the Court of Appeals that the Federal election
had been certified 15 days after the recount.

And the

defendants argued before the Court of Appeals orally that
after the Federal election had been certified, no evidence
of what had happened in any subsequent investigation should
h«v© bean introduced.

And the Court overruled that,

They

sail ym, go ahead and introduce that evidence.
But the essential thrust, it seems to us, as we
read the decision is that that Court passed on the i 3sue that

23
evidence in this case having to do with a State electior:
fell undor the jurisdiction of Section 241.
Q

Let us assume that, the Court, was wrong in its

construction of 241 with respect to State elections»

Then,

X take it, this evidence they were talking about arguably
was inadmissible»
MR» GIMSBURG:
Q

Arguably.

Let us assume that it was inadmissible.

That

is an independent ground for reversal of the conviction, is
it not?
MRo GINSBURGs

If the evidence was improperly

introduced, my view would be at that point that there would
be no evidence in this record even having to do with the
State elections.
Q

The gravamen in this argument then is that

since there was no contest over the votes for Federal offices,
Federal jurisdiction over the conspiracy ended at that time.
And the evidence of subsequent events that a contest hearing
involving only a State office voted on at the same election
was accordingly inadmissible.

I do not quarrel with that analysis,

as we see the case at the moment*

The Government, at least

as the case has presented it, both below and the intermediato
V

court and here, as it finally reaches here, is simply that
a Federal violation was charged and therefore we have the
right to come in under Section 241.

We say that a State

voting fraud was conspiracy, was shown, if it was shown
there, but had nothing to do with a Federal election and
that statute should not be extended.
Q

Is there no power in any Federal statute to

guarantee the integrity of a State election?

Let us assume

that you had an off-year election and there were no Federal
offices on the ballot at all, just local.

Does not this

statute seek to protect the integrity of the State electoral
processes?
MR. GINSBURG:

The Court, Your Honor, until now

has deliberately refused, after the most mature consideration
to extend it so far,

If it is dona, this would be the first

time in judicial history that Section 241 has sought, to
be applied,

MR. GINSBURG:

No doubt, Your Honorf regarding

constitutional pov?er,

14 th Amendment, Section 5, the Congress can clearly reach it,
and indeed they are debating it.
the past ten years.

They have debated it over

There are bills pending today dealing

with these problems.

And there is no doubt too that the

State could deal with it.

.arid many States have dealt with

it and effectively.
The issue really is whether this section should now
by interpretation of this Court be extended without the
sanction or prior consideration by the Congress.
Q

It already has that reach if there were any

discrimination in terras of voting rights.
MR. GINSBURG:

Exactly right, sir.

If there is

racial discrimination, there is no doubt in our view — we
are not urging that point — that Section 241 in our view
would be applicable.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Ginsburg, we will

allow you 3 minutes rebuttal and adjust all the time accord­

Mr. Wallace?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, there are two questions presented in the petition

25
C

a&Bf;

Title 18 applies to primary elections for State officers.
And tho other is vrlaijor if it doss so apply, an inuictaaant
under Section 241 must charge State action under color of
r

State law.

Those two questions were both decided by the

Court of Appeals and are properly before the Court.

And ws

have argued that they were correctly decided' by the Court
of Appeals.
But we also advance an argument that the Court of
Appeals need not have reached those issues and this Court
need not reach the issues, because the case involved the
casting of fraudulent votes in a Federal as wall as a State
election..
There were some other arguments advanced with
respect to the sufficiency of the indictment or with respect
to the charges to the jury that, in our view, are not
comprised v/ithin those questions presented and are not
*

properly before the Court.
q

Mr. Wallace, you will mention whether you have

to reach the Stata election issue baaed on this evidence
quastion»
MR. WALLACE:

I will. Your Honor, and I will foa

getting to that in just a moment.
Q

Because that seems to be the way the Court of:

Appeals reached that question.

27
'-:2, WALLACE j

tr^doubtodly war: the way h:>.-r Court

of Appeals reached the issue of 2418s applicability to state
elections.

But we think unnecessarily under the Court eh

Appeals * own rulings.
Contrary to on® remark made by counsel for the
petitioner, the Government's theory in this case is not that
there were two conspiracies.

In our view, the entire case

was tried and the.indictment charged a theory of a single
conspiracy to cast and have counted fraudulent votes for
candidates running for Federal and State offices in the

Hay 1970 West Virginia primary.

No distinction was made by

either the Government or the defense between the Federal and
State offices during the entire course of the trial from
beginning to end.
As the Court of Appeals' opinion itself points out,
that issue first was brought into the case in the course of
oral argument in the Court of Appeals.
We think the evidence as Well as the allegations
show that the conspiracy embraced the casting of false votes
for Federal offices.

Wa have set forth in our brief in

the statement on pages 6 and 7 of our brief in a lengthy
footnote, Footnote .No. 11, the most relevant portions of the
evidence dealing with the reach of the conspiracy through
the casting of fraudulent votes for the Federal offices.
Cecil Elswick, who was th© witness during this part

28

of the trial, was testifying about his activities; anti ho. is
the one who did the actual casting of the fraudulevst vop.-a
i.7i the Mount Ray Precinct.

And his testimony, rseovu-ited on

page 6, when he was asked what the petitioner Hager asked
him to do in bringing him into the conspiracy, he answered
that "Ha wanted me to go along with them.
would cause me trouble.

If I did not, he

He was a deputy sheriff,” the

petitioner Hager.
"Did he tell you what he meant by going along with
them?”
And the answer, ’'Go along and help win the Mount
Gay Precinct on election day."
"Question:
"Answers

For whom?
For the Gkey Hager- slate and Senator Byrd

and Ken Hechler."
That was when Mr. Elswick was brought into the
cc -jpiracy and, as the Chief Justice, suggested the record
does show that petitioner Hager was the chairman of the
Democratic County Committee, and he may well have had an
interest in maximizing the votes for the Federal candidates
as well as for his father, who was running in the most hotly
contested election,
Than the testimony goes on on page 7, as that foot­
note continues.

Cecil Elswick testified that he in fact

put fraudulent votes on the ballots at Mount Gay for the

29
Federal officials.
"Mr* Elswick, did you put any illegal votos oa

those machines that day?
"Yes, sir, we did.
"How many?
5*X lost count at ■ about 90.

It was over a hundred,

1 lost count that eveningy and we put more on after I lost,
count.

So, it was over a hundred votes.
"Who ware you putting those votes on there for?
*t was putting them on there for Senator Byrd and

Ken Hechler and Okey Hager slate,81 etc.
And the evidence shows mathematically, as it is
recounted on page 8 of our brief that fraudulent, false,
fictitious votes were, in fact cast for fch© Federal candidates.
More votes were cast for each, Senator Byrd and Congressman

tetchier, than there ware voters who could have possibly
votod in that precinct that day.
There is also on page 7 a footnote that references

i\ tuft record to the. Byrd slate which was apparently
synonymous with the Hager slate.
Y./-opposed

The Federal candidates

in that election as the figures that counsel

v.'j" the petitioner gave the Court indicate.
&

They received

high percentage but not 100 percent•of the vote in that

primary.
Wa have her© a situation in which possibly the

30
■ afeion, the motive of the c
the election for the count// court office that was at staks.
This was not the theory of the defense»

Thera was nothing

introduced in evidence at the trial to show that the
conspiracy was anything other than a conspiracy to cant
votes for the Federal and Stats offices,
The entire thrust of the defense was that the
Government’s witnesses were not worthy of belief and that
if there were a conspiracy, it was a conspiracy just among
the three election officials at that precinct who admitted
to being part of the conspiracy and to casting the false
votes or standing by while they were cast,

And perhaps

what they were really trying to do was cast false votes for
the husband of one of the three who was running for -lustice
of the Peace,

That was the thrust of the defense.

There was nothing introduced at the trial to
contradict that the conspiracy was a conspiracy to cast votes
for the Federal as ’well as the State offices.

And , indeed,

t world he inherently incredible to think that they could
conspire to stuff more than 100 ballots in a precinct of
tills .size; for the State offices alone, because it would be
so conspicuous and so likely to arouse suspicion if the
vote was that much lass for the well knows Federal candio :.l. as
than for the State candidatas, that it would obviously not
be an effective way of proceeding.

And there is some

i; ii-e

is. 'iv? ■

■:,■

44 cA: the prli feed append 3?

that this indeed may have been one of the reasons why hr.?
conspiracy embraced the Federal offices as well as

At-m'.o

ones.
Mr* Elswick testified about what petitioner Browning
said to him at a meeting concerning what wa3 to be done at
the Mount Gay Precinct.

And the question there on page 44,

about 6 or 7 lines down * "You say Mr. Browning was at that
meeting?
"Answer:

Mr. Browning was at that meeting and when

we walked outside the door there, he said, ’Cecil, put them
on there, but don’t put enough on there to get in any
trouble.’

He meant don’t pull all the registration book or

I could get in trouble and they could catch it easy»”
Wall, obviously that at least meant not to cast
more votes than there were possible voters in the precinct.
Q

He did not heed that admonition, 1 take it.

MR. WALLACE?

He may not have anticipated the

proof that would be offered of the number who did not in
fact vote.

But obviously if there were more than a hundred

votes cast for the State offices and not for the Federal,
the conspiracy would have little chance of succeeding.
And so the entire theory of th® case was that this
was a single conspiracy which involved the casting of
fraudulent votes for both the Federal and State offices.

And

32
the evidence introduced, while it. showed that, it also
tended to focus a great deal on what was the principal
contest and the contest, the outcome of which was affected
by the votes cast at this precinct, because county-wide the
difference between the vote for Mr. Hager and the vote tor
Meal Scaggs, his opponent, was only a difference of 21 votes,
and more than 100 fraudulent votes were cast for Mr. Sager,
according to the allegations hare, in this one precinct.
This was enough to change the outcome.

This was the dramatic

aspect of the conspiracy and the aspect that had given rise
to subsequent acts on the part of the conspirators to
effectuate the counting of those ballots in the State
contest proceedings.
Q

In this statute does it make any difference

whether the fraud affects the outcome?
MR. WALLACE:
Q .

It does not, Mr. Chief' Justice..

The effort that fails is just as much a crime

as one that succeeds-.
MR. WALLACE:

Even if the purpose was not to affect

the outcome but just to falsify the votes.

The holdings have

boon the right protected the voters in a Federal election
as to axi accurata count and to have their votes given their
proper effect and weight in the election.

As we know in

political life, the magnitude of victory can be quite
imp-;.*'.tant in determining governmental policy even if they

do not change the outcome of who is elected to office,,
The evidentiary question to which fir. Justice White
has alluded arose because the defendants contended at the
trial that in its instructions — and this was the only
objection mads to the trial court's instructions and pme Greet
at the trial — that the jury should have been instructed
to disregard all evidence of acts that occurred after rive
results of the ©lection had been certified approximately a
week after the election day.

There had been much evidence

introduced at the trial concerning the contest proceedings
about the results in the county court race,, all of which
occurred after the certification in an effort to upset the
certification for the State office.
In the course of passing on whether that evidence
was properly admitted — and that is the controversy about
whether evidence was improperly admitted —• the Court of
Appeals held that it was properly admitted with respect to
the conspiracy charge, confining itself to the conspiracy
for State offices, because it held — and this is on page
18-A of the appendix to the petition for certiorari — because
it held that the true object and purpose of the conspiracy
charge, insofar as its question is concerned was to secure
the Democratic nomination for Okey Hager as county judge,
and that this conspiracy embraced the attempt to effectuate

the evidence that had been introduced concerning -the

Q

Your theory, then is that if the conspirer

embraced in the slightest way the casting of any fraachaLr'n:..
ballots for a Federal officer, that is enough to bring it
under 241?
MR. WALLACEs.

Under the established holdings

under 241.
Q

What would be a Court of Appeals

probably do not know.

you

Then there arose the question that

even so, the evidence was inadmissible because 241 does not
cover State elections.
MR. WALLACE:

That is right.

At. oral argument in

the Court of Appeals for the first time a contention was
made that the casting of fraudulent votes for the Federal
officers constituted som-athing separate in all that 241
covered, and that as to that conspiracy, if it could be
deemed a separate conspiracy, the certification was the cut­
off for possible admission of evidence because no contest
ansuad with respect to the Federal offices.
This is the first time that, any suggestion had been

35
made that this was more than one conspiracy.

Every

indication in the allegations in the trial was that it. was
a single conspiracy to cast and have counted votes for this
slate of candidates, Federal and State alike.
Q

Tha Court of Appeals then did reach the

constructionist ■—
MR. WALLACE?

The Court of Appeals for that- reason,

instead of holding that the evidence as to the acts

f tha

conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy insofar as
they affected only the State returns, was properly admissible
Q

Because it was one conspiracy.

MR. WALLACEt

Because it was one conspiracy.

In

sort of reaching that issue, the Court of Appeals held that
241 applies to a conspiracy just to affect State offices
anyway, to cast fraudulent votes for State offices, and
therefore it need not worry about -—
Q

What should we do if the Court was wrong in

that view of 241?

I am not saying it is„ but assume it is

wrong.
MR.* WALLACE:
Q
Appeals?

We think —

Than do we have to remand to the Court of

You suggest we just reach the criminal conspiracy ~
MR.* WALLACE:

No, we have suggested this as an

alternative ground for affirmance.

It is apparent on this

record that this is. a single conspiracy, an identical issue

36

really, except it did not involve the time gap that was
involved in this case„
Q

Mr, Wallace, do you submit an argument for or

against the Court of Appeals interpretation of 241 as reach­
ing local —
MR, WALLACE:

We do submit an•argument and the

Court of Appeals decided that correctly, and that is our
alternative contention here.
Q

I understand that you ar© saying too that oven

if the different conspirators have different priorities
in terms of the objective, that they war® trading horses in
effect and that each is then charged with the total action.
MR. WALLACE:

The conspiracy embraced the casting

of fraudulent votes as one of its objectives for the .
Federal offices, even though thca motive may have been solely
to get Qkey Hager elected to the county court.

The fact

that the conspiracy embraced the casting of false votes for
Federal offices is enough under this Court’s decision in
the Ingram case for a Federal jurisdiction to apply without
reaching the question whether the statute reaches the
conspiracy to affect the State offices, that aspect of the
conspiracy.

And surely it is of no moment to obvious

Federal interests why it is more than 100 falsa votes were
cast in the Federal election for the Federal offices.

We

Log!zed it in our brief to a conspiracy to rob a Federally

3?
insured bank*

It i

ju.rh as much a crimef regardless of

what it is that the conspirators were intending to use the
proceeds for,.

And wa see no difference here, that their

motive may have been only to affect the outcome of the State
election»

They vara conspiring to falsify the Federal

election»

That is what the deciding cases, hold.
Q

Do you have to go that far in view of the

testimony — I have forgotten the name of the man, but it is
in Footnote 11 -- that it was for the slate of the senator,
the congressman, and the local court?

If the jury had a

right to believe that, then you say that every member of the
conspiracy is charged with that testimony?
MR. WALLACE;

And that, it was a single conspiracy

to falsify returns for that slate in that one primary.

The

casting end the counting was all don© in the one primary for
•the one slate of candidates.

We do not see how this is

really separable into more than one conspiracy.

The

suggestion that is made is that really they did it with
respect to the Federal offices only to serve their purpose
to win for the county court post, which really intertwines
it into on© conspiracy in their contention as well, as we
.understand their contention.
We do nut see how there is a separate conspiracy
here.

At least, no one has raised that defense.
So, under the Court of Appeals' own holding --

Q

1 know, but you must have made this same

argument in the Court of Appeals, the single conspiracy.
HR. WALLACE:
Q

They did not pass on that.

The Court of Appeals reached a much more

difficult, complicated question, it seems to me.
MR. WALLACE;

It is not so difficult, after what

this Court said in Price.

In Price the Court unanimously

held that 241 applies to all Federal constitutional rights.
Q

I do not want to get into the merits of that.

I just wondered, the Court of Appeals must have thought

that the? single conspiracy theory was not as sound as you
might make it sound.
MR. WALLACE;

I have not read the transcript of

>efor@ the Court of Appeals.

I really do

not know to what extent these issues are clarified.

Q

They passed right on by that and reached this

other question.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is the way they chose

to decide the case, and it is quite understandable, because
in add:', tion to the passages that we site from Guest and
Price, there war in Price another passage which is very

39
indicative of this hoi

-

U.S. in which the Court; holds, "We cannot doubt that the
purpose and effect of Section 241 was to reach assaults upon
rights under the entire Constitution, including the 13th,
14th, rind 15th .Amendments, and not merely under part of
it.
Q

Neither of those cases dealt, with voting in

State elections.
MR. WALLACE:

Neither of those cases dealt with

that precise issue, but immediately before that, sentence,
there is a footnote saying in this historical context in
the text it is hardly conceivable that Congress intended
Section 241 to apply only to a narrow and relatively
unimportant category of rights.
And then the footnote cites, among other cases,
for example, United States v. Classic, parenthetical right
to vote in Federal elections.

It is quite obvious that the

reasoning was that 241 embraces more than that, as it was
the reasoning from the Mosley case on through the others
Section 241 that have dealt with voting rights.
The fact of the matter is that although Congress
in 1870 may have had a limited conception of the Federal
constitutional protection of voting rights, this has been
expanded enormously since that statute was enacted, not
only by interpretations of the 14th Amendment but by other

amendments to the Cons titration, including the 17th

.v.

providing for direct election of senators ( the 13 th Amend­
ment —
Q

Is not the question what Congress intended to

cover by 241, not how the Constitution is construed today?
HR. WALLACE: That is what the Court addressed in
all of these cases and decided in Mosley and in trice and
in cases in between, that 241 was broadly written in generic
terms to cover not only the rights that then existed but
all rights that may come into fruition under the Constitution,
including the rights under the 19th Amendment, the rights
under the 24th Amendment, under the 26th Amendment, and
under the 14th Amendment.
Q

If they had put an exception in and said

except voting rights, I suppose you would not make that
argument„
MR. WALLACE:

If they had put that exception in,

of course.
Q

You have got the legislative history as

equivalent to an exclusion.
MR. WALLACE:

That issue was thoroughly mooted

in the majority and dissenting opinions in Mosley, in
Classic, and in Saylor.

And it seems to us that the Court

has disposed of it.
Q

What you are contending though would make

41
ballot stuffing in & school board election a Federal c-ffonso
under 241,
MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, Your Honor,

Contrary to what the petitioners! counsel contends, that
there is no need, for this, this record itself suggest that
there is a need for this.

On. page 31 of the appendix in

which the testimony was about the false story was to be in
the State proceedings which, as we have noted, came to naught
in this case and these votes were not thrown out in the
State proceedings, the bottom of page 31 the question was,
“Did they tell you what the story was to bo?
"Answer:

Well, like Garrett Sullins voting, for

one thing, and if we would stick together" in telling false­
hoods about this, "we could not be convicted of nothing
because v?e had the county court, the judge and. the prosecut­
ing attorney and the sheriff."
Q

Whether one thinks there is a need for that,

Mr. Wallace, on the basis of that testimony, 1 suppose
depends upon one’s view of the Federal system, whether every
time you find a corrupt prosecuting attorney in a county you
feel that the Federal Government ought to step in,

I do not

think that is beyond debate.
MR. WALLACE:

It may not be beyond debate, but

the holdings of what 241 means is that there is Federal
protection for the constitutional rights of individuals under

42

the Fe de r a 1 Con s t i ■: i; t i on,

hxid certainly one of ife ooev

important of those rights is not to have his vote diluted
improperly.

This has been the whole thrust of the retries

of reapportionmo.it cases, and if that is an improper diluti on.
of on®'s vote, it is certainly an improper dilution to cancel
it out through ballot box stuffing, in effect make it a
half vote or a third of a vote.
0

I take it, fir. Wallace, in a local election,

on the hypothesis of Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc*s question, in
a local election if you had a woman candidate and the men
who were in charge of the election machinery agreed among
themselves they were only going to count one in three of
the women's votes, on the assumption that most of them would
vote for the woman candidate, that you say 241 would cover
that?
MR. WALLACE:

We say it would cover it, and the

petitioners8 theory is that it would not cover it even in
a Federal election, because the Congress that enacted 241
thought prior to the adoption of the 19th Amendment that it
did not have power to protect against sex discrimination.

The same thing would be true about the poll tax that is
protected against in the 24th Amendment and the 18-year■•••old
vote that the 26th Amendment affords protection for.
The Court in this whole saries of cases from
Mosley through Price and Guest has rejected the idea that

43
241, which is written in generic terms to apply to all of
these rights, has frozen the constitutional rights protected
to those that existed in 1870.
Q

Was Hasley a Federal election?

MR. WALLACE:

Mosley was a Federal election, Your

Honor«
Q

Mr. Wallace, I did not understand the petitioner

to say that 241 would not he applicable to a Federal election.
Maybe I misunderstood what you just said.
MR. WALLACE:

Ballot box stuff!nq in a Federal

election, that is correct.

That is his theory, that that

could h® protected, ballot box stuffing or racial
discrimination in a Federal or State election.
Q

But do you understand what he does not say

241 applies to in a Federal election?
MR. WALLACE:

That would be the sex discrimination.

The old holdings were that 241 did not. apely under the
Bathgate case in a Federal election to bribery of voters.
Q

1 misunderstood and the petitioners' counsel

can speak for himself, but I had understood that for the
purposes of this case at least he had acknowledged that a
conspiracy for any kind of fraud in a Federal election would
be covered by 241 and indeed a conspiracy to racially
discriminate in a State election would be covered.
will speak for himself

But he

MR. WALLACE;

This is something that •the Court

would —
He does aay

I understood him fcfcrd

too.
MR. WALLACE:

I do not.

My understanding of his

theory is that 241 must be interpreted in light of the
powers that Congress thought it had in 1870.

And if Congres

at that time thought it could not protect against sex
discrimination in Federal or State elections, than 241 would
not cover it.
Q

That inquiry would have to be made.
How about the power to protect against ballot

box stuffing in Federal elections?
MR. WALLACE:

He is not asking the Court to over­

rule Saylor, and Saylor was a direct holding cm that point,
that it does cover ballot box stuffing in Federal elections.
I do not want to make his contention for him and say what
it is.

But it seems to me that the theory of his case, as

I understand it, because there is no other basis on which
he is asking for the limitation of 241 and I do not see
any other basis after Pries and Guest on which he can ask
for a limitation of 241 — his theory has to be that it is
limited to what Congress thought it had the right to protect
against in 1870.

It seams to us that the holding in Guest

rejects that theory, because at that time it was even before
Plessy v. Ferguson had been decided.

But that certainly was

the governing principi® of rights i;n&r the 14th AmendKLn c
at that•time.

And yet the holding in Oweat was that in c

series of cases beginning with Etowf._ vv Boar;l ^ of Bdu f-avicn
another constitutional principle had come to prevail and
was embraced within 'the protection of Section 241«,
So, I do not think that this necessarily .seamed
like the more difficult issue to the Court of Appeals.

It

seemed to them like something that had been decided in
Guest and Price, and we agree with them that the essentia!
thrust of Guest and Frica is that 241 applies to these
rights.

This was thoroughly considered at the time,,

had given the Court a great deal of trouble.

241

And in a

unanimous opinion in Price the Court concluded that 241
does apply to ail rights under the 13th, 14th, and 15th
Amendments« italicising "all” in the Court's opinion as well
as to all other constitutional rights.
Q

But you still do not think it. is necessary

for us to reach that issue in this case?
MR. WALLACE;

We sae no need for it, because the

decided cases involving voting frauds under 241, it, seems
to as, show that the statute protects against falsifying
elections for Federal offices in the manner it was done
her®, and we do not think there was any ambiguity even about
whether this was all one conspiracy.
Q

>fe do have to dispose of that evidentiary

4a
question in some way f and you suggest, we do not do it the
way the Court of Appeals did hut. on another ground,
MR. WALLACE:

Yes, that you can merely hold -- the

Court of Appeals did hold that the .evidence with respect to
the contest proceedings was properly admissible hero bscoooo
the conspiracy lasted this long, even though there was no
longer any contest about the Federal offices *

And our

submission is that that holding was correct as far
went and suffices to uphold this conviction„

it

This is exactly

the question that the Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit
had before it in a case called Davoe v. United States which
is cited in a footnote at the bottom of page 15 of our
brief, a case back in 103 F 2nd.

And what the Court of

Appeals for the 8th Circuit had to say in that case-: was —
I am quoting from page 588 now of 103 F 2nd — "The Govern­
ment’s evidence was not at any time directed towards showing
the existence of a number of separate and distinct
conspiracies but. was directed towards showing one general
conspiracy which contemplated in part a false count and a
false certification of the ballots cast for the congressional
candidates.

So much of the conspiracy has constituted a

violation of the Federal law, was a part of the general
ul'ur. or scheme of those engaged in the conspiracy.
.

The

• ofcion that the Government should have been limited in

its proof to only so much of the evidence as directly bore

upon the portion of the conspiracy which constituted the
violation of Federal law is, we think, unsound.”
The Court of Appeals in the present case could have
used the exact same language in disposing of the case without
reaching the issue whether 241 applies to a conspiracy that
did not involve the casting of fraudulent votes for the
Federal offices.

We think the judgment should be affirms#

on either of these grounds, and we leave to our brief the
discussion of the adequacy of the indictment to allege
action under color of law, if the Court reaches that issue.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID GINSBURG, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GINSBURG:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The Government has said that, this is a single
conspiracy.

And of course the indictment was so framed.

This Is one of the errors in the way the case was tried below
If I might point out to the Court in the appendix that Is
printed, page 54, I am now reading from the Government's
closing statement in the summary of the evidence introduced
in that case.

This is Mr. King speaking:

"I think from

the evidence you can conclude by now that the theory behind
the Government’s case actually is that these votes were cast

and counted by going through the contest and all in order to
get Obey Hager elected to the county court, in order to get
Red Hager's father elected to the county court, that these
defendants, along with others, got the votes cast and got
the votes counted in the long, drawn out procedure that was
involved over there*"
There are other references in there*
The indictment charged a Federal offense*

The

attempted proof was a conspiracy to get Okey Hager elected
County Commissioner,
Q

What about that language that Mr. Wallace read

to us, 6 and 7 of that brief?

Marshall, to which I had reference during the oral argument.

with Byrd and Kechler.

It had nothing to do

They were all for Byrd and Hechler

in Logan County, West Virginia.

Ninety-five percent of the

vote went for them.
Q

Supposing you are right in that, Mr. Ginsburg,

can you raise that under the questions that you have
presented in your petition?
MR. GINSBURG;

Yes, I think so, sir, because as

we read the Court of Appeals* decision, to which we have
had so much reference, the Court felt apparently as we do
hare that the submission of the Government was the submission
of a case on thh basis of a State fraud, and they felt it
necessary to extend Section 241 to a local State fraudulent
voting issue just on the issue of constitutional power.
There is no question of ample constitutional power to deal
with these matters, whether it. has to do with sexual
discrimination or the kinds of vote frauds that are dealt
with in this case.

The issue is whether Section 241 will

now be extended by this Court into -this area on this
record.

Mr. Ginsbhrg, may I ask you one question.

Would

your position be the same?
MR. G1NSBURG:

I think if the Conspiracy

> my

position would be the same on the record in -tills case.
There is no doubt of that.

Because the conspiracy that was

shown, the only conspiracy that was shown under Section 241,
the only evidence in the record -- and that would take you
into a consideration of the evidence in the record — and
the only evidence in the record we can find is that, when
these people talked among themselves as to what they were
going to do, they were talking about Okay Hager, and there
was no consideration, no discussion, no effort to direct
any concerted action in the election of Hechler and Byrd.
Q

But. people like that must have intended to

have their acts have some impact on something besides Okey
Hager, because they-were voting for .a slate and they
necessarily

in .a Federal election.

MR. GINSEURG:

Mr* Justice White, we have played

with this necessary and probable consequences of their
intended act, and wa have tried to analyze it in those terms.
But .the reality is, as this record shows, the transcrip 9
V-

the ’2,000 pages of it, that these people were concerned
with something raal to them, and that real was this County

51
Commis s ioner*s j ob.
Q

That may ba so, but there was a very real

impact flowing from their acts in a Federal election too
Just as many votes were falsified in the Federal election as
there was in the State.
MR. GINSBURG:
Federal office.

But the conspiracy was not for

The only conspiracy that was shown in the

record was a conspiracy that was limited to the local office.
The burden of proof is on the Government,
Q

The on© colloquy in Footnote 11 or 12 would

seem to be cutting across that somewhat, where the man
said ho was assured that if they got the county sheriff,
the county prosecutor, and the county judge, then nothing
could happen to them, i.e., if there was any fraud beyond
that, all the people in the state level, the local level,
to deal with these problems were their man.
MR, GINSBURG:

That was clearly the assumption,

but the issues with which they were dealing, the only issues
with which they were concerned, and indeed the only issue
that was involved in the election context, was what?
Hager as County Commissioner,

Okey

These were their concerns.

They had no concern, no interest, in the problem of the
Senate or the House.
Q

Some of them did from their testimony,

MR. GINSBURG:

No, but only as individuals, not

as conspirators.
Q

This is,, X think, the central issue,

MR. GINSBURG-

Clearly seme votes were ca:rc for

Federal office by e. man named El strict who actually pullet
the lever.
Q

And he was a part of the conspiracy?

MR. GINSBURG%

He was a member of one of the

conspiracies; he was a co-conspirator, actually not a
defendant.

He- was given immunity in this case.

And the

issue is whether he took his instructions from Hager, who
was one of the defendantsor whether he took his instructions
from the conspirators as such.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Ginsburg,

Thank you, Mr. Wallace.
