MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 73-477, Gerstein against Pugh.
Mr. Mellon, before you proceed, 1 observed we have
allowed an hour and a half here.

Having allowed it, we will

honor that, but it occurs to us that this may not warrant it,
and if you gentleman can shorten yoitr submission, it will

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD R. MELLON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MELLON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I am the Assistant State Attorney in Florida, and I
represent the petitioner here, Richard E. Gerstein, State
Attorney in and for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida,
in and for Dade County.
Petitioner was the appellant below and one of the
defendants at trial in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Florida.
We’re here on a writ of certiorari to review the
August 15th, 1973 decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals, in which that court held, in affirming the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida,
that the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States mandated that preliminary

4
hearings be given for all persons being held in custody, even
in instances where they are charged by information filed by
a State Attorney, in which he has certified that there is
probable cause to hold those persons in custody pending
trial.
The respondents at the time of the initiation of
this litigation were defendants then in custody in the Dade
County jail, charged with various crimes, felonies and
misdemeanors, charged by information or informations which
had theretofore been filed by the Dade County State Attorney,
the petitioner here.
In their suit they brought -- in the class action
which they brought, they ask that the District Court declare
and mandatorily compel the Dade County Circuit Court to grant
them a preliminary hearing on the charges then pending against
them.
The United States District Court, in its ruling,
held, among other things, that these defendants were entitled,
under the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth
Amendment, to a preliminary hearing, even though they had been
charged in an information in which, the State Attorney had
certified the issue of probable cause,,
We are here confronted with that question;

Do

persons in State custody, charged under an information in
which there, has been a certification as to probable cause by

the prosecuting attorney, that is the State Attorney, do they
have a right to a preliminary hearing before a magistrate on
that question of probable cause?
Throughout this litigation, the petitioner has
relied on a line of cases by this Court beginning with
Hurtado vs, California, in which tills Court held that a man
need not charged by a grand jury indictment but can in fact
be charged by information.
Lem Woon vs. Oregon • has been argued throughout this
litigation.

This Court has held that no prior probable-cause

hearing is necessary prior to the making of an arrest.
We have relied especially on this Court's language
in Ocampo vs. United States, in 234 TJ.S.

There it was held

that the function of determining probable cause is only
quasi-judicial, and therefore that function need not be
confided to a strictly judicial officer or tribunal.
This Court in recent years, in its decision in
Shadwick vs. Tampa, for example, held that a magistrate must
meet two tests.

First, that he be neutral and detached,-

and tiie second, that he be capable of determining probable
C3US64

When this Court held, in Coolidge vs. New Hampshire,
that the very Attorney General who would act as a magistrate
in the issuance of a search warrant, that Attorney General
who had been the chief investigator in the case leading up to

the application for a search warrant, and who would be the
chief prosecutor, did not have the degree of neutrality and
detachment necessary to ~ in that instance.
We submit that we are not here confronted with a
similar situation of Coolidge vs. Mew Hampshire.
The State Attorney in Florida, and the State
Attorney in tills instance, the petitioner, in his determination
as to whether or not there are sufficient facts to file an
information, has a degree of neutrality, and has certainly
a degree of detachment, for he does not make the case.

The

case is brought to him by a law enforcement agency.
He sits, in effect, at that juncture in the
proceeding in a quasi-judicial capacity.
QUESTION:

He meets —

Mr. Mellon, I wonder if I could interrupt

you to ask you if you can help me get clear the chronology of
how this happens.

Is there first an arrest by a policeman,

presumably, at least so far as this case goes, a valid
arrest, because no arrest, is being attacked in this case? and
then the policeman comes to the prosecutor of the county and
gives him the case that he thinks he has against the man and
then the prosecutor files the information?
Or does the information come first, and then is
followed by an arrest?
MR. MELLON:
Stewart.

it occurs both ways, Mr. Justice

In the majority of cases — the majority of cases in

7
our jurisdiction in Florida, in Dade County, are warrantless
arrests, where the officer corae s upon the scene and makes an
arrest on probable cause»
QUESTION:
MR, MELLON:

Unh-hunh.
In that case the information is filed

subsequent to the arrest.
QUESTION: After the arrestee is in custody.
MR* MELLON:

Is in custody, Your Honor, that's right.

In the ~~
QUESTION:
MR. MELLON;
QUESTION:
MR, MELLON:

Is there a time limit?
Yes, Your Honor,
In which he must act.
Yes, Your Honor, under the present

rules of criminal procedure in Florida, which were amended
effective March 1st of this year, he must file an information
within 96 hours after the initial appearance.

And the initial

appearance is held within — it conforms to your rule, Rule 5;
must be held within 24 hours after the arrest.
But the majority of cases are of the warrantless
variety.
On the other hand, there are instances where a
police officer comes to the State Attorney’s office, testifies
to the State Attorney or his assistant as to the nature of
his case, and thereafter a warrant, a' capias or warrant is
issued when an information is filed.

8
QUESTION:

So in that kind of a case the arrest

follows the .issuance of information, and it's by virtue of a
capias issued by the prosecuting official.
MR. MELLON:

Yes.

The capias issues in Florida

under the Florida rules, unless the man is already in custody,
or unless he is out on bond.
In those two instances a capias will not issue.
However, if he’s at large and has not been arrested
at a prior time, a capias will issue.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

By the same man who files

the information, presumably.
MR. MELLON:

No, Your Honor, the capias is issued

by the court —- by the c.lerk acting at the court's behest.
QUESTION:

Acting in the prosecutor's behest, isn't

it?
MR. MELLON: The prosecutor indicates that — the
rule provides 'that a capias shall issue at the time the
information is filed.
QUESTION:
ME. MELLON:

I see.

Unh-hunh.

Issued by —

Unless the prosecutor requests -that it

be issued at some subsequent time.
QUESTION;

And now that I've interrupted you, can

you tell me what determines, in Florida procedure, whether a
prosecution is to be initiated by information or whether it's
to be instituted by grand jury indictment?

9
MR. MELLON: The only mandatory requirement in
Florida is in the area of capital offenses, that a grand jury
indictment must be handed up.
QUESTION;
MR. MELLON;

Uhh-hunh.
Otherwise all crimes are prosecutable

by information.
QUESTION;

And are they in fact prosecuted by

information, or are they sometimes prosecuted by grand jury
indictment, otiler crimes?
MR. MELLON;

Oh, yes.

Other crimes are — very

many crimes are prosecuted by indictment.
QUESTION; Well, what determines that?
Who is it who decides it and on what criteria?
MR. MELLON; The grand jury generally makes that
determination, and the State Attorney quite often will bring
matters before a grand jury, matters dealing with public
corruption, for example? matters which historically have
been brought before a grand jury.
Florida has a unique law, a Sunshine Law, which
requires that all executive agencies conduct their business
in the sunshine, in effect, in that there are not to be
executive sessions,
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION; Can the grand jury take up a case that the
prosecutor doesn't want them to take up?

10

MR. MELLON;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
How?

MR. MELLON;

Indeed they can.

How?

Simply by directing the prosecutor to

bring that matter before them.
QUESTION:

When you have this hearing before the

prosecutor, are the witnesses sworn?
MR. MELLON;

Yes, Your Honor, all the -- the

prosecutor must certify in his information that he has had
sworn testimony taken, and -they are in fact sworn.
QUESTION: And where is that in the statute?
MR. MELLON: Where is that in the statute?
QUESTION;

I didn’t see that in the statute.

Can

you tell me where it is?
MR. MELLON;

Your Honor, counsel for amicus will

it’s set out in the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure,
that the matter must be *—
QUESTION;

And, you say that this was a detached

person, the prosecutor?
MR. MELLON; At that juncture, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: And, as I understand it, most mine-run
criminal offenses are proceeded against by information;
capital cases have to go by way of an indictment, and some
cases involving official corruption and so on go by way of
indictment, but most mine-run criminal offenses are initiated
-— the prosecution is initiated by information; is that

II
MR. MELLON: That is correct.
QUESTION:
MR. MELLON:
QUESTION;

Do I understand that correctly?
That is correct.
Unh-hunh.

And is this case confined to

Dade County, Florida, or is this a Statewide problem in
question?
MR. MELLON:

It's a Statewide question, Your

Honor, since we’re dealing here with the problem —- Dade
County has a unique magistrate system, which arose during
the time this case was pending on appeal.

And Florida

provides, on a Statewide basis, un.der its rules for a prelim­
inary hearing now.
But its ramifications are clearly Statewide.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.
Mr. Mellon,

since this case started,

I understood it concerned both accused -« persons accused of
felonies as well as misdemeanants.

Is the misdemeanant

aspect of it before us now?
MR. MELLON:

it is, Your Honor.

QUESTION: So we’re concerned both with the —*
MR. MELLON;
QUESTION:

Both with felonies and with misdemeanors.
Mr. Mellon, before you proceed, did I

understand you to say that the State's Attorney would require

sworn evidence before he issued an information, or would he
rely, say, on an affidavit from the policeman?

MR. MELLON:

In Dade County, in instances where

informations are filed after an officer has come to the fitate
Attorney’s office and has exposed the case to the State
Attorney.

In those instances, sworn testimony is taken in

each ins tance.
QUESTION;
MR. MELLON:
QUESTION:
MR. MELLON:

Prom the officer —
From the officer and ~~
— before a court reporter?
Not always — not always with a

court reporter? but he's sworn, when an officer comes into
the office.

There are certain policies set out in the office

that determine as to when a court reporter will be utilized.
But the officer and/or any other witnesses who are
there are sworn, in those instances,
QUESTION: Does the State Attorney adhere to, say,
the same standards of requiring probable cause that a magistrate
xtfould, before issuing a search warrant or an arrest warrant?
MR, MELLONs

Your Honor, under the Revised Rule,

which was effective on March 1st of this ~~ this month,
the Supreme Court has imposed — tine Supreme Court of Florida
has imposed on State Attorneys in Florida

an even higher

burden.
In -the per curiam opinion, which accompanied the
Revised Rule, the Supreme Court of Florida said that
prosecutors now have 96 hours after the first appearance

13
hearing to make a determination as to whether or not an
information shall be filed against that person in custody.
Now,

making that determination, they must not

only look to see if there be probable cause, they must go
beyond it and establish if there is proof beyond, to the
exclusion of a reasonable doubt.

If they are not being

proved beyond, to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt, then
the defendant should be discharged.
That's the implication in the per curiam opinion,
which accompanied the release of the new Rule of Criminal
Procedure.
QUESTION:

This is not stated expressly in the new

rules, is it?
MR. MELLON:

It — Your Honor, in the Appendix

to the respondents' brief, the amended rule appears with
its accompanying opinion, it's trie last exhibit in the
respondents’ appendix.

It was not heretofore brought to 'this

Court's attention, and the petitioner, since the amended rule
and the opinion in which it was released occurred in early
February*
QUESTION: Could I ask you this-:

I take it the

claim is not that convictions that occur without the
preliminary hearing should be automatically reversed?
MR. MELLON; That's not at issue here.
QUESTION: The issue here is pretrial custody.

14
MR. MELLOW:

Pretrial detention.

QUESTION: And this is a 1983 action?
MR. MELLON:
QUESTION;

No, Your Honor/ we're up here on -It was brought in the District Court,

was it not?
MR. fiELLON:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: As a 1983 action, as a federal, asserting
that that was a denial of constitutional rights by pretrial
contention — detention without a preliminary hearing.
MR. MELLON:

No — Your Honor, it was brought as a

class action, seeking «—
QUESTION: Well, I know, but .it's — but the-»- but
it is a 1983 action, in the sense of the jurisdiction of the
District Court.
MR. MELLON:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

*l,‘-

It rested on 1983.

But it has only to

do with custody, doesn’t it?
MR. MELLON:

That's right, Your Honor.

That's

the salient question, Yo\ir Honor.
QUESTION: And do you think that Plorida -— does
Florida have something akin to habeas corpus that permits a
person to challenge pretrial custody?
MR. MELLON:

Heretofore, at the time this suit

was instituted there was —- habeas corpus was a possible
remedy, at any time after custody, to question lack of

15
evidence at all to hold a person.
Florida, by statute, had had a 30-dav period which
allowed a State Attorney to — -that time in which to file an
information.
QUESTION;

And, of course, as far as custody is

concerned, for persons on bail, he's considered in custody,
I suppose, to some extent he's under restraint.
MR.MELLON:
Honor.

We don't reach that question here, Your

Not in the posture in which it came up from the

Fifth Circuit.
QUESTION;

Yes.

But could — but you think

rather than bringing this 1983 action, that the petitioners
here could have filed for habeas corpus in Florida, challenging
their pretrial detention?
MR. MELLON: That was argued below, Your Honor.
I think there is a possibility that they could have filed for
habeas corpus.
QUESTION; Well, why —
MR. MELLON:

However, the 30-day statute that

had existed, which has now been repealed in Florida, had
provided they must wait that period of time before he could
question it, before the judge who was to try him.

However,

it's always been felt in this case, certainly by the
petitioner, that the other type of habeas corpus which could
— which would lie where there is the absence of any evidence

16

to hold that man,, could have been petitioned for.
QUESTION;

Well, how about —* well, which would

have encompassed the preliminary hearing issue, I suppose.
How about federal habeas?
MR. MELLON s

I think that federal habeas corpus was

available in 'this suit.
QUESTION;

And supposing that the incarcerated

pretrial detainee initiates a habeas corpus action in the
Florida Circuit Court, what's the issue there prior to
his trial, whether there’s any evidence at all that justifies
holding him?
MR. MELLOW:

Under the old procedure in Florida,

yes.
QUESTION;

Well, now, is this procedure still

available?
MR. MELLON;
Florida.

Habeas corpus is still available in

However, the Supreme Court decided that the speediest
• :Vi-

■

-

j

way, I think, was by this amended rule, which became effective
on March 1st.
If after the lapse of — in effect it’s 96 days plus
another 24 hours before there's —
QUESTION;
MR. MELLON;

Ninety-six hours.
Excuse me, Your Honor? 96 hours plus

the additional 24 hours in which, the man must be brought in
for a first appearance hearing.

17
If, after the lapse of -that time, an information
has not been filed, the Supreme Court has directed in its rule
that the man be released on his own recognisance.
QUESTIONS

Is he entitled to challenge on State

habeas corpus this lack of any evidence, even after an
information has been filed?
MR, MELLON;

His remedy there is to move by

motion to dismiss, Your Honor,

At the time of arraignment,

the information is read to him, unless he waives the reading.
He can at that time attack the sufficiency of the evidence to
hold him.
QUESTION:

So you say there is, then, some State

remedy available, whether or not an information is filed?
MR. MELLON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, what is this first appearance,

that’s not clear to me.

I'm looking at the rule as

effective from March 1st of 1974, that is this month, the
first of this month, which the general rule seems to be;
in all cases where the defendant is in custody, except capital
offenses, the preliminary hearing shall be held within 96
hours of the time of tine defendant’s first appearance.
Nov;, what is the defendant's first appearance?
MR. MELLONf

First appearance hearing.

The

defendant must be brought before a magistrate within 24 hours
after his arrest

18

QUESTIONs And what's the function of that first
appearance?
MR. MELLON:

He's advised of his constitutional

rights at that time, his right to bail, questions of sanity
are quite often raised at that first-appearance hearing.
He is thereafter advised, generally, of his constitutional
rights <.
QUESTION:

He's advised of his rights, but is any

determination at all made by that magistrate as to the
reason why he's being confined?
MR. MELLON:
QUESTION:
MR. MELLON:
QUESTION:

Not at that — not at that time, no.
Not at the first appearance.
It's ~
And so tile

and that has to occur

within 24 hours of his apprehension.
MR. MELLON:
QUESTION:
MR. MELLON:
QUESTION:
MR. MELLON:

That’s correct.

In —

Excuse me —
Excuse me, Your Honor.
— you go ahead.
Dade County has a unique — I alluded

to it earlier, has a system of committing magistrates which
sit regularly.
QUESTION 5
MR. MELLON:

Unh-hunh.
And which afford preliminary hearings

in an almost overwhelming majority of cases.

The courts

.19

were created, as I say, at the time this case was making its
way iip through the appellate structure.

However, in fact in

Dade County, at the first-appearance hearing, a man is advised
of his constitutional rights and thereafter told the date of
his preliminary hearing, which is a matter-of-course thing.
However, candor compels me to indicate to this Court
that that's •— that the system of magistrates courts in
Dade County are unique, and though other circuits in Florida
offer preliminary hearings on a regular basis, Dade County
is the unique one -that does it as a matter of course.
QUESTION: But in every county there’s a first
appearance within 24 hours after apprehension, is that right?
MR. MELLON: That's right, Your Honor.
QUESTION: And. then the rule provides that the
preliminary hearing shall be held within 96 hours — that's
four days — from the time of his first appearance.
MR.'MELLON:

Unless —

QUESTION: And then, as I understand it, that is
unless an information has, in the meantime, been filed? is
that right?
MR* MELLON;

Yes. And that rule was modeled after

your Rule 5.
QUESTION:

Yes.

I just want to be sure I under­

stand this system.
MR. MELLON:

Yes.

That's it, Your Honor.

20

QUESTION:

That’s really kind of the guts of the

argument, isn’t it
QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION:

— the fact that your rules except from

the preliminary hearing requirement the cases in which an
information has been filed, and your opposing counsel says
you have to have one.
MR. MELLON:
put. Your Honor.

That's as succinctly as it could be

Yes, it is.

QUESTION: Some of the circuits in the federal system
have held that there need be no preliminary hearing once an
indictment is returned.

What’s the Fifth — do you know the

Fifth Circuit situation on that score?
MR. MELLON;

I’m not clear, Your Honor; I am sure

that counsel for the respondents will supply the Court with
that information.
We always submitted in Florida — we also argued

.

Beck vs. Washington below, in which this Court also alluded
to tiie fact that in the State of Washington for almost fifty
years --- this Beck was decided in 1962 —■ that in Washington
for almost fifty years prosecutions were had not by grand
jury indictment but by information, without determinations as
to probable cause.
Now, clearly, the language of this Court seemed a
little to prior determinations.

However, we’ve argued, and

21
we argue here,, that the State of Washington law at that time
and at the present time is such that there are no probablecause hearings given, either prior to the time of an arrest
or after an arrest in the State of Washington.

And that the

prosecutor in Washington proceeds as he does in Florida,
and as he does in several other States which we allude to in
our brief, Wyoming, Montana, Arkansas, Connecticut, and
that the Supreme Court of Connecticut, in discussing this
matter in an early case, has said that the State Attorney,
when proceeding by information, is vested with the common law
power of Attorney General.
And that they cited Hurtado in that case, and
Ocampo, and held that the State Attorney really in effect
acts as a one-man grand jury, and that's what we submit to
this Court:

the State Attorney in Florida is capable of

acting in a detached neutral manner so that his finding,
his certification of probable cause should be entitled to
as much weight, certainly as a finding of probable cause by
a grand jury.
We submit to this Court respectfully that the
decision of the Fifth Circuit Court should thereupon be
reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Marky.

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND L. MARKY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF FLORIDA AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. MARKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas a

the Court;
Three rulings that were decided by the Court of
Appeals disturbs Florida in particular.
No. 1 is that they held the rule which exempted
misdemeanants from preliminary hearings was a deprivation
of equal protection of the law.
The second, they said that the delay in holding a
preliminary hearing in a capital case or in what Florida
calls a light felony case, on the one hand, with general
felonies on the other ~~ let me back up so the Court
understands.
If .it's a capital or a light felony, we have seven
days within which to inform or indict; if it is a normal
felony, we have four days.
The Court of Appeals held there was no rational
basis to classify these different crimes and have these
different periods, and that it constituted a denial of
equal protection.
The third, of course, was that we had ““-mandatory
to have preliminary hearings, notwithstanding the filing of
the information.
Now, all of these, of course, is of interest to the

23
State of Floridaf because these are rules of Statewide
applicatior;.
In so far as the misdemeanants are concerned,
the misdemeanant petitioner in this case is charged with first
possession of marijuana* carries a penalty of 60 days* $500
fine.
We find that this Court exempts from preliminary
hearings petty offenders, six months, $500 fine.
So I would submit to this Court that the Court of
Appeals is either wrong, or this Court's rule is unconstitu­
tional.

Because you are in fact discriminating between a

petty offender and a felon.
That's quite clear, I think it's vivid, and I think
the opinion must fall or this Court's rule must fall.
The second one, the delayed hearing, I think really
misses the mark.
two crimes.

There is a rational basis to classify these

Under our rule, it's Rule 3.130,

first

appearance, we've got to show, in a capital case or a light
felony, presumption great, proof evident; or he has a right
to bail.
QUESTION;
MR.

MARKY:

Who is the first appearance before?

A magistrate, Your Honor,

In other

Words, we're having a bail hearing in 24 hours, and if we
can't show proof evident, presumption great, in a capital or
light felony,

this man is entitled to bail; so he is getting

24
a hearing.
QUESTION.-, But supposing that the prosecuting
attorney goes in on this first hearing and says, We don’t
contest the right to bail?
MR. MARKY;

In that instance, Your Honor, we still

have a rational classification.

I'll tell you what it is.

In a capital offense, under the Florida Constitution, there
must be an indictment.
So the State Attorney, in addition to filtering
tills evidence before himself sworn, he must of necessity
take an additional step, not required in the other felony,
by then taking this to a grand jury and presenting it to
them.
A duplicitous step which is in addition to the
normal felony.

And it is that ministerial administrative

function that we submit to you justifies -the additional
three days on this more serious crime,
QUESTION;

Well, we're not involved here, as I

understand it, with people who are in custody as a result
of grand jury in diet men ts,
MR. MARKY:

No, I'm talking about the discrimination,

Your Honor,
QUESTIONs
MR. MARKY;

Yes.
— of equal protection between the

seven days and the three days. The Court ruled, the Court of

25
Appeals ruled that that statute was — or that rule was
unconstitutional because of equal protection.
QUESTION:

You say this is done before a magistrate.

That's just in Dade County, is it, or —■

‘

MR. MARKYs

No, no, that's Statewide, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Statewide, all right.

MR. MARKEY:

Which brings me to the third element

of the Court's ruling.
Your Honor, under the old system it was no good,
and I'll stand here and tell you that,

A State Attorney v?as

not required to file an information at any particular time.
If the man was in custody, he had to stay there for a period
of thirty days before he could do anything, whether an
information was brought down or not.
Consequently, we had the gravamen of the complaint
in the Court of Appeals and in the District Court, and that
is that a

man languishes in jail for two weeks, three weeks,

months, before an information is even filed.
Now, that's under the old system.
But the Court transposed that historical problem
into the present irules, which it doesn't fit, because the
State /Attorney better be in there with an information in S6
hours, or he's going to a hearing.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the claim in this

the issue

in this case is that if he is in there within 96 hours, with

26
his information, then the man stays in custody if he can't
make bail indefinitely without any hearing as to probable
cause —
MR. MARKY:

Well, that's — that’s not —

QUESTION:

That's what the issue is in this

case, isn't it?
MR. MARKY:

Yes.

But I'm going to the problem,

Your Honor, of this long detention before anything occurs.
QUESTION;

Well, but that's not the issue in this

case.
MR. MARKY:

But after the information is filed,

a whole host of tilings happen.

Including Florida's criminal

rules provides — it’s 3.190(b) — provides for, in the
nature of a summary judgmentF that can come any time, in
the form of a motion to dismiss.
In other words, they come in and say, We admit that
these are the facts, and this is the fact, that this man is
entitled, to release.

It's unique to Florida.

It's the

only law I've ever heard of a criminal summary judgment.
But Florida law authorizes that.
Which gets —

it?

QUESTION:

It is a one-way summary judgment?

MR. MARKY:

Yes.

QUESTION:

That makes quite a difference, doesn't

27
MR. MARKY;

It is, Your Honor.

Which brings me

to the point, you can't take the episode here, in ignorance
of all of the other Florida rules.

Florida has the most

comprehensive rule of discovery.
Mow, under Coleman vs. Alabama, which tells us why
a preliminary hearing is important:

to having the man

discharged? early pretrial release; the discovering of the
State's case? and certain insanity presentations.
Florida provides for your pretrial, your own
recognizance, 24 hours you've got to have that hearing, on
bail.
Secondly, we have these rules of discovery which
are broader than any in the United States.
QUESTION:

Yes, but what does that have to do with

the issue before us here, Mr. Marky?
MR. MARKY:

I think what it has to do with it,

Your Honor, is that what a man gets under our comprehensive
over-all scheme -—
QUESTIONs
MR, MARKY:

Unh-hunh.
— is much deeper in terms of preparing

himself than anything he would get out of a preliminary
hearing.
QUESTION:

But he's not now talking about any

opportunity not to — lack of opportunity to prepare
himself for trial, he's talking about being locked up on the

28
bas.is of an information with no preliminary hearing as to any
probable cause, but —
HR. MARKY:
QUESTION;
prosecutor.

Well, —
— but locked up only on the sayso of a

That's what the issue here is, isn't it?

HR. MARKY:

Yes, it is, Yoxir Honor.

QUESTION;

Right.

MR. MARKY:

But the point that I'm getting at is

the gravamen of the complaint at the District Court and at
the Court of oppeals level was this two-month protraction.
And Florida has, as I'm trying to illustrate, it is a
compendium package of rules designed to stop this long delay,
and that's what the first appearance and the immediate
information is all about? then your mandatory speedy trial
in 60 days on misdemeanors and 90 days on felonies, which
I think cannot be ignored in the totality of the —
QUESTION: But he's talking about being locked up
for sixty days or ninety days on the sayso of a prosecutor.
Now, that's the only issue before us, as I understand it;
and maybe I wholly misapprehend this case, but -MR. MARKY:

Well, look, apparently you and I are

not communicating, Your Honor, because the very purpose
expressed in Coleman by Mr. Justice White was that he was
concerned that we would result in a dispensing with .'preliminary
hearings if we require counsel at them.

29

And this Court cataloged all of the important
features that the preliminary hearing serves.

And I am

merely trying to convince the Court that it’s there.
QUESTION:

Yes, but surely the preliminary

hearing, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggests, would also result
in his release if it was held that there ti?as not probable
cause.

Now, forget that discovery for the moment and —
MR. MARKY;
QUESTION:

All right.
— and why don’t you address yourself to

whether or not it’s constitutional to continue to hold the
man after the information is filed, even in the absence of a
judicial determination.
MR. MARKY:

of course, I understand, the point, and

you are ■—
QUESTION:
MR. MARKY;

Well, that is the point at issue.
— taking the assumption that bail has

been denied and all this.
QUESTION:

In that context, —

We just want you to talk about this

case, that’s all.
MR. MARKY:

In that context then, Your Honor, we

quite agree with the petitioner in the case, that Deck vs.
Washington — Beck vs. Washington very definitely qualifies
the State Attorney as a one-man grand jury.

And that this

is really akin to Morrissey, which was cited by the Court of
Appeals.

He didn't require a magistrate there, it was just

30

someone who was not directly involved in what it was that
brought about the man's incarceration.
QUESTION;

Yes, but there is a little difference in

Morrissey, because the man that you're talking about here is
going to be the man who prosecutes him, presents the evidence
against him.
He's had to make the preliminary determination that
it was a prosecutable offense, and in that sense Coolidge
has something to do with it, because it might be thought
difficult for him to disassociate his decision on the first,
stage from his responsibilities on the second.
MR. MARKY;

I understand the distinction, but

then we are presented with this Court's Rule 5, where a man
happens to be indicted, he gets no —~
QUESTION; But there you had a dozen or more people
making the decision, as distinguished from one.

And the

dozen or more do not have any further obligation with
respect to the prosecution.
MR. MARKY:

I understand the dichotomy of the lay

persons, 12 out of 18 in Florida must return the indictment,
but I would submit to Your Honor that if the indictment is
that different, then why did this Court say that the States
may choose to bring to trial pursuant to an information, as
opposed tc an indictment, that the federal government has.
If it was

31

QUESTION:

This Court at that stage wasn’t

addressing itself to the narrow problem that's before us
here today, though.
MR# MARKY: But I think it — I think it nevertheless
follows, Your Honor,
QUESTION:

in that it is —
Functionally.

It’s one thing to say

that functionally the information charged by the prosecutor
is the same as the action of the grand jury, but that doesn't
mean it's the same for all purposes.
MR. MARKY:

I understand what the Court is saying,

but the treating of these two types of bringing to trial as
sufficiently alike to not require indictments by the States,
linked up with Beck vs. Washington, as counsel has pointed
out and as quoted in the brief, makes it clear that I think
the State Attorney is sufficiently removed to where he is not
directly involved to bring in this charge.
He's certainly competent to decide the question.
QUESTION:

Does the State's Attorney in Florida run

for office?
MR. MARKY:
QUESTION:

By the electorate?

Yes.

And is he any different from the other

State's Attorneys that brag about how many convictions he
got?

Are they different from others?
MR. MARKY:

answer that question.

Well, Your Honor, I'm not prepared to
I'm not familiar with the State

32

Attorneys and their political campaigns that closely to
even answer the question.

I think a State Attorney,and the

statistics and his record bear .it out, is not likely to file
an information in a case where he can't even get by a directed
verdict.
X mean, I think a man would have to be somewhat
foolish to set about a course of filing an information when
he knows he doesn't have the evidence.
QUESTION: And that's what makes him unbiased?
MR* MARKY:

I think — well, I think it makes him

reflective —
QUESTION:

That’s what makes him neutral?

MR. MARKY;

It certainly makes him reflective,

Your Honor.
QUESTION: That makes him neutral, too, doesn't it?
MR. MARKY;

That, I guess the Court --•••*

QUESTION:

Neutral and careful.

MR, MARKY:

— will have to dispose of that.

The State's position is that Florida has tried to
emulate this Court's Rule 5, the spirit of that Rule 5,
notwithstanding the differences between indictments and.
information, and that it has substantially changed the time
within which a man must be picked up, brought to a judge.
And in amicus and in the Court of Appeals they constantly
refer to McNabb, and they keep saying, Well, what we need is

33

McN abb.
And I think that this is somewhat amusing, for our
rule on the first appearance is McNabb, as I understand
McNabb.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume at this

point after lunch.
MR. MARKYs

Thank you, Your Honor.

[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.m., the same day.]

AFTERNOON SESSION

[1:01 p.isi.}
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Rogow, you nay

proceed when you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S. ROGOW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ROGOW;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In Florida, the State Attorney absolutely controls
the question of probable cause.
If he files an information, there is no right to
be heard on the question of probable cause.
QUESTION:

Could I ask you at the outset, was

Preiser y. Rodriguez cited at all, or considered in the
Court of Appeals?
MR. ROGOW:

It was not, Your Honor, but it has

no application in this case.

It has no application, one,

because we have never sought to release from custody in
the District Court.

All we sought was a pretrial procedural

right.
But even if the court felt that Preiser did have
some application —QUESTION:

Yes, but the custody was the only

thing that was at issue, in the sense -that if there had been
no pretrial incarceration and just a summons to come to court,

35

at a certain time, this case wouldn't have arisen, I take it.
MR. PI)GOT?;

It may still have arisen, Your Honor,

because the question of x^hether or not that is custody might
still be a valid question.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but if it wasn't.

MR. ROGOW:

It is true that this is a pure custody

case, but my point is that all we're asking is the District
Court to compel there to be a preliminary hearing —
QUESTION;
MR. ROGOW:

Or release.
No, sir.

Never,

Never asked for release.

The decision on release would have to be that made by the
magistrate.

If he determined there was no probable cause,

then he would release the person.

The State magistrate would.

We never asked
QUESTION;

You mean your object was never to be

released.
MR. ROGOW;

Only if there was no probable cause,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;
QUESTION;

I know, but
But even if you're there under 1983,

certainly the District Court's ruling on your action has got
to be in the alternative, doesn't it; say. Either give this
man a hearing or release him.
MR. ROGOW: The decision of tine District Court in
offering the alternative to the State, in saying this is the

36
sanction was a statement saying, release him.

But that would

assume, of course, that the State would fail to abide by the
constitutional decision.
I don’t think we can make that assumption.
But if I may digress —
QUESTION:

Anyway, the question I

asked was

whether Preiser had been considered at all by the Court of
Appeals, and you say it was not.
MR. ROGOW:

It was not, and let me add one other

thing regarding Preiser, is that even if Preiser has
application in this case, State remedies were futile, and
Preiser makes it quite clear that there is no need to attempt
habeas corpus in State court if if would be futile.

And

it is in Florida.
QUESTION: Well, I know, but the question is the
form of your action in the federal court, whether it should
be federal habeas corpus or not.
MR. ROGOW; And if it should be federal habeas
corpus, if the court felt that this is properly a habeas
corpus matter, we think that —
QUESTION:

Then we would have -- then you would

certainly focus on it and have the District Court’s judgment
as to whether there was a local remedy.
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir, but it’s quite —

QUESTION:

Which we do not have now.

3?

MR. ROGOW;

Yes, your do, Your Honor.

1 think the

record is absolutely clear that there is no local remedy
throughout this litigation.
QUESTION:

Well, I know — did the District Court

MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir, and the Fifth Circuit said so.

say so?

QUESTION: What did they say?
MR. ROGOW;

It said that in Florida, once an

information is filed, it is quite clear there is no way to
test the determination of probable cause.

And the Fifth

Circuit, in a footnote I think in their decision, said •—
QUESTION:

How about federal — local -*• how about

State habeas?

MR. ROGOW: Futile.

Absolutely futile.

Because once

the information is filed under Florida law, you can't go behind
it to determine probable cause.

State Ex Rel Hardy vs.

Blount makes it quite clear, and the Florida decisions for
■a long period of tircie make it quite clear chat a State habeeis
corpus judge will not require —*
QUESTION: Well, you disagree with your opponent
here, where he suggests that State habeas might be available?
MR. ROGOW:

He suggested it, but he did not address

the question of whether or not it would be futile,

!Ie said

you could file a habeas corpus petitionj but we are telling
the Court that if you did file one it would be a futile act.

38
An empty act.

And the record is quite clear on that point.

QUESTION:

There's a footnote. I think, in your

brief or one of the briefs, about what's happened to the
respondent in this case.
MR. ROGOW:

What's his posture now?

He is *— he has been convicted, Your

Honor, and he is in jail, in Belle Glade, Florida.

But we

don't see any mootness problem here, if that is what the
Court is —
QUESTION:

But you're talking about the class

action aspect?
MR. ROGOW:

It is a class action, but it is also

a problem of low visibility in the criminal process, one
which is capable of repetition, yet evading review.
QUESTION: Well, but you are .not then seeking any
relief with respect to the respondent, but only to those
who are similarly situated?
MR. ROGOW;

Yes, sir, exactly,

QUESTION:

And there are no named parties available

now?
MR. ROGOW: At idie time this suit was filed, all
the named parties suffered this exact same deprivation.
QUESTION:

I said now, was my question.

MR. ROGOW:

No, sir.

No, sir.

QUESTION; Well, how can you maintain a class action
without a named party?

33
MR. ROGOW: Because at the time the class action
was maintained originally in the District Court, he was a
member of the class.

And so he had standing at -that point.

And the class action survives him.
But I hasten to add that this is capable of
repetition, yet evading the review.
QUESTION;

I think you should hasten, because I

don't agree with you at all.
QUESTION;

There's a case called Berney v. Indiana,

I think, that rather cuts the other way from what you've just
told us.
MR. ROGOW;

I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the

Berney case, but I am familiar with the cases that talk about
capable of repetition yet evading review.
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. ROGOW: The point is that this issue could never
be litigated in the 30 or 60 or 30 days in which that custody
is deprived.

There would be no way, ever, to successfully

litigate the issue.
And the Court, if it felt that this was not a
capable of repetition yet evading review case, would relegate
people to having no opportunity to raise the issue at all*
Because the Florida law is clear, and the only way to maintain
such an action would be as a class action and pointing
out the capable of repetition yet evading review exception to

40
mootness.
Within recent — I should back up and point out
that even if a preliminary hearing is held in Florida,
because a State

Attorney does not file an information, the

State Attorney can overrule the discharge at that preliminary
hearing.

If the magistrate finds no probable cause, and

the State Attorney is unhappy with that determination, the
State Attorney can file an information and the person is
back in jail again.
So I harken back to my original statement that the
State Attorney absolutely controls the question of probable
cause0
Within recent years this Court has held that before
a person's welfare check may be taken, before -their wages
are garnisheed, before their driver's license is suspended,
there must be a prior hearing.

This case presents idle

issue of whether or not after a person's liberty is taken
there is a right to a subsequent hearing, and recently, in
Morrissey vs. Brewer, and Gagnon vs. Scarpelli, -the Court
held, that persons whose liberty is conditional, people on
parole and probation, were entitled to a prompt subsequent
preliminary hearing, ones it was determined that that
conditional liberty should be revoked.
We are talking here in terms of absolute liberty.
These people are presumed innocent, and it. is their absolute

41
liberty which is being deprived.
The right which we seek the Court to —* which we
ask the Court to accord is not a new or novel right, preliminary hearings are «ancient institutions, they were known in
the Twelfth Century, codified in the Sixteenth Century,
used in the Colonies before and after the Revolution, they
have evolved into imprtial determinations of probable cause
over the years, historically.
The foreranner of the preliminary hearing which we
ask. the Court to grant today was granted in the case of
Aaron Burr, where Chief Justice John Marshall held a preliminary
hearing to determine whether or not there was probable cause
to hold Aaron Burr on a charge of treason.
And the extent of that inquiry was whether or not an
offense had been committed, and whether or not Burr had
committed it.
And that is the kind of preliminary hearing which
we are talking about, and it has been known long ago, in
England and here, and the Marshall hearing was held in 1807.
Our position is that the information process cannot
determine probable cause for two reasons:

one, because it

provides none of the elements of a due process hearing. There
is no right for the defendant to be heard.

There is no

right to confront and cross-examine witnesses,
right to present evidence.

There is no

So it is solely an ex parte non-

42
adversary hearing, and that is not consistent with due process.
QUESTION;

By definition, hasn’t there, in this

case, been an arrest on probable cause?
MR* ROGQW;

Yes, sir, on Fourth Amendment probable

caiis e.
What we are seeking is a test of that Fourth
Amendment doterraination,
It's interesting, I think, to note that if evidence
is seised upon a warrant, stating probable cause, you can test
that determination by a

motion to suppress.

But here in

Florida you cannot test the taking of liberty.
QUESTION;

Well, you don’t get a motion to

suppress -— I mean, the p.rocedures in the States vary, but
sometimes that doesn't happen until the actual trial, that
you're allowed a motion to suppress? isn't that correct?
MR. ROGOW:

I'm not sure about most States, but

in Florida you can move to suppress certainly before trial.
If the evidence has been illegally seised.
It seems that if the evidence has been illegally
seized, or if the taking of the body is improper, to have
to wait for trial and remain in jail during all that time,
only to find out, six month3 later, that there really is no
1

case at all, serves no useful purpose for the defendant or for
the State.
QUESTION:

Well', but here there has been, as I

understood you to agree, a taking into custody on probable
cause.
MR. R0GOW:
QUESTION:
MR. ROGOW:

Fourth /amendment probable cause -For arrest of the person.
— for arrest, yes, sir.

And we are

seeking to test that probable cause in a due process hearing.
Subsequent to the taking.
QUESTION:

Of course, the basic, ultimate test

comes in the trial of the criminal offense, doesn’t it?
MR. ROGOW:

Well, the basic element of the test at

that point, of course, is of no great ~
QUESTION:

The ultimate test.

MR. ROGOW:

It's 'die ultimate test, but it is of

no benefit to a person who has been incarcerated for sixty
days and shouldn't be there in the first place.
And that's what the preliminary hearing is all about,
and that's what the preliminary hearing in Morrissey vs.
Brewer was all about.
Certainly, ultimately, the taker might decide that
there was reason to revoke parole or probation,

;but there

should be a preliminary determination as to whether or not
paro3.e or probation should be revoked.
QUESTION:

Isn't this procedure very similar to

the procedure under Rule S of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure?

44
MR. ROGOW;

Ho, it is not. Rule 5 uses informations

only in misdemeanor cases.

They can only be used in felony

cases if a defendant waives his right to indictment.
So Rule 5 involves only misdemeanors to that extent
it is similar, because this case also presents the issue of
whether or not misdemeanants are entitled to preliminary
hearings if they, too, are in custody.
But it is a .lira!ted comparison.
QUESTION; Well, when is a defendant in a federal
trial first told of his right to be indicted by a grand
jury before he can be tried?
The fact is that many felonies in the federal
system are commenced by the filing of information.
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION;
MR. ROGOV?:
QUESTION:

But the filing —And a waiver.
And a waiver.
Yes.

But when in the federal system

if the defendant first given his opportunity to waive?
MR. ROGOV)':

I think probably at the Ccmmissioner

hearing, the first appearance hearing he might be told that,
I'm not quite sure,
QUESTION:

Well, there's no requirement under Rule

5 that he be told that.
MR.ROGOV):
he be told that.

No, sir, there is no requirement that

But he would obviously have counsel at the

45
first appearance hearing before the commissioner.

And,

seemingly, his counsel would inform him, if he makes a
decision that he wants to waive indictment, that he could be
proceeded against by information.
QUESTION; Well, what -- he often wouldn't have
counsel.

It’s at that first appearance that he's advised of

his right to counsel, isn't it?
MR. ROGOW; And in felony cases, it seems, since
they're going to be determining bail and other issues, at
least the practice is in Florida and the Southern District of
Florida, to appoint counsel at that time.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION:

I understood from prior argument that

there were two types of arrest that were involved primarily:

arrests made in the field by an officer who may have
witnessed the crime, or there were exigent circumstances
justifying arrestj in those circumstances there was probable
cause for the arrest.
Now I understand you to say that where the State's
Attorney issues a warrant for arrest on the basis of testimony
of a police officer, sworn testimony, that probable cause
is created by that act.
by the State's Attorney.
MR. ROGOW:

That is, the issuance of the warrant
Is that correct?

Yes, sir.

That is a Fourth Amendment

ex parte determination of probable cause.

There are

46

deficiencies in it, because of —
QUESTION: Well, the next question I was going to
ask you is that you accept — or you agree that there is
probable cause there, even though the State’s Attorney is
not an impartial officer?
HR. ROGOWs
kind of consideration.

What we have there is a practical
I cannot concede that there is pure

— absolutely pure — Fourth Amendment probable cause there,
because neither the State Attorney nor the arresting officer
is a neutral and detached person.
But in a practical — as a practical matter, there
is — we are willing to have the State Attorney or a police
officer decide that there's probable cause and make an
arrest.
Otherwise, what we would be asking for would be
a prior-to-arrest determination of probable cause? and we
don't ask that.

Because that would be a ridiculous request

to invite possible defendants in to see if they're going to be
arrested some time in the future would work.
So, obviously, when the balancing process takes
place, you have to allow the arresting officer to make that
ijuasi-determination of probable cause, or the State Attorney
perhaps making a similar determination

quasi-determination

of probable cause.
Neither are neutral and detached.

But we're seeking

47
to test -that determination, and so it's a flexible kind of
thing we're asking after the taking of liberty:

an opportunity

to test that determination that was made.
And that is a Fourteenth Amendment request that we're
making.
Nov/, I think it's interesting to note that the
State Attorney is not neutral and detached, not only under
the Fourth Amendment, but under the Fourteenth Amendment.
In Morrissey vs. Brewer, the Court talked about one of the
essential elements of a due process hearing is to have that
hearing conducted by a neutral and detached person*
And we submit that the State Attorney, the chief
prosecuting officer, certainly is not neutral and detached
under the Fourteenth Amendment, and of course under the
decisions of this Court, in Coolidge vs. New Hampshire and
Shadwick vs. City of Tampa, he's certainly not neutral and
detached under the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION:

You’re talking about Morrissey v. Brewer,

do you really think we went that far, to say he must foe
neautral and detahced, or did we say that it must be a
probation officer other than the one who has been
supervising his release? i
MR. RQGOW;
vs. Brewer,

Yes, those were the words in Morrissey

and we respect those words.

QUESTION;

That doesn't necessarily make him

48
neutral and detached, any more than in

Goldberg v. Kelly,

you had neutral and detached, it just meant a person who had
not had a prior connection with the case»
MR. ROGOV?:

Or will not have a future connection

with the case.
QUESTION:
MR. R0G0V7:

Yes.
In other words, at the time he makes

the decision, he is not involved in -the case before or after.
The prosecuting attorney is the chief prosecutor.
.involved in the case afterwards.

He’s

There's no way that he

can be said to be neutral and detached.
QUESTION:

It might not be the same prosecutor,

any more than it would be the same probation officer or the
same agent in the welfare office.

MR. ROGOV?:

We were talking about the head of the

office, the State Attorney, and everyone working under him
are Assistant State Attorneys, so he —
QUESTION;

They're his alter-egos, is that your

theory?
MR. ROGOV?5

Yes, sir.

He is —* he is the one to

whom responsibility finally resides.
who signs the information.

And he is the one

He is the one who charges

probable cause.
It’s true, his assistant may have made the initial
determination, which I think perhaps in some way underscores

49

the kind of procedure that we have here.

And this record,

at page 49 of the Appendix, reflects that, that a police
officer comes in, talks to an Assistant State Attorney,
perhaps a year or two out of lav; school, and tells him what
he thinks is the problem, what the gravamen of the charge
is.
And then the assistant prepares the information.
He passes it on to another deputy State Attorney, who looks
it over, and finally the chief State Attorney signs it.
So you’ve got three people in this process, all of whom are
rubber-stamping the original decision made by an assistant
who is working under the direction of the State Attorney.
QUESTION: Would you have any reason to suppose
that the basic practice is very much different in the federal
system with respect to info mat ions?
HR. ROGOW:

No, sirs I do not think it’s much

different. And, to be quite frank with the Court, if we are
correct, if a person in custody upon an information is
entitled to a preliminary hearing, then, under Rule 5{c) a
person who is in custody prior to trial in the federal
system would also bq entitled to that preliminary hearing.
So we -QUESTION:

Right,

In the federal system, if

there’s ~~ if there has been an arrest with a warrant, and
the person is brought before a magistrate whose only function,

if the arrest has been with a warrant, is to advise him of
his rights, which is like the first hearing in. Florida»
MR. ROGOW;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: And he's then in custody and there has
to be a preliminary hearing within ten days, except that the
preliminary examination shall not be held if the defendant
is indicated, or if an information against the defendant is
filed before the date set for the preliminary examination.
MR. ROGOW;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; And then if an information is filed,
then he comes up before the District Court, and not until
then does he have an opportunity to be told of his right to
be indicted rather than be informed against.
MR. ROGOW;

Well, he would have no right to be

indicted, because it would have to be a misdemeanor, and he
could be informed against.
QUESTION:

As he —

MR. ROGOW;
QUESTION:
I'm talking

So that the information would bs —No, I'm talking about a felony new.

about a felony, in which there is a constitutional

right not to be proceeded against except by indictment.
But he's not told about that until he appears in open court
in the District Court.
MR. ROGOW;

Under- Rule 7»
And the question is, Your Honor, whether

or not -that person 'would have a right, to a preliminary hearing.

QUESTION: Well, I'm just suggesting that that's the
— that that federal system is basically the same as the
Florida system, and it doesn't mean that it's valid, but it
does mean that these rules, enunciated by this Court, are
unconstitutional if
MR. ROGOW:

you're correct.
Yes, sir, I would say that would be

true, if we are correct.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

On the other hand, in the federal system, if the
arrest has been without a warrant, if the arrest has been
without a warrant, then the magistrate has the duty of
finding probable cause.

And to that extent the federal

system is unlike the State system of Florida.

Is that

right?
MR. ROGOW:

Attorney could file an information —«

And if he doesn't find it, the man's released.
Rule 5, of the federal system.

MR. ROGOV?s
QUESTION:

Under the federal rule.
Yes.

And -that makes it different.
Now, were these arrests with or without warrants?
MR. ROGOV?;
QUESTION:

Vlithout warrants.

Without warrants.

So that would differentiate the two

s ys terns, th en.
MR. ROGOV?; There would be a distinction to that
extent between -die two systems perhaps.
I think there's another distinction that has to be
raised, and. that is that we're talking about people who are
in custody prior to trial.
QUESTION:

In the federal system

■

Well, they're in custody as a result

of valid arrests.
MR. ROGOV?;
QUESTION:
MR. ROGOV?:

Yes, sir, but there -—
Are they not?
—- but there needs to be an opportunity

to test whether or not that is a valid arrest, and. not
keep a man, unless he's been indicted, awaiting trial for
60 or 90 days, only to find out that there was no probable
cause to hold him, during all that time.
That's what we’re getting at in this case, and
that's what the issue that's presented in this case is.

raised regarding misdemeanors takes us to our misdemeanor
argument, which is that in Florida they have a classification
which totally excludes misdemeanants from the possibility
of ever getting a preliminary hearing, even if the State
Attorney was willing to tolerate one.
The classification imposed by the rule is that
there is no right to a. preliminary hearing, unless you charge
a felony, and of course unless the State Attorney does not
file an information.
That classification affects a fundamental right,

54
the right not to have your liberty taken without an opportunity
to be heard.
And our position is that there is no compelling
reason advanced by the State for that classification.
The Court of Appeals agreed, the District Court agreed,
in fact the State has really not advanced a compelling
reason nor even a rational reason for that distinction ..be­
tween -—
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps I'm being repetitious,

but perhaps I don't understand your point.
But thousands of times every day in this country
people's liberty is taken away when they tire arrested by law
enforcement officers on probable cause.
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
They are taken down to jail and locked

up.
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Now, what is — are you attacking that,

that there cannot be an arrest and a custodial arrest on
probable cause?
MR. ROGOW:

No, we' re saying there can be a

custodial arrest ohi.probable cause, but there must be a
review, subsequent review.
QUESTION: When?
MR, ROGOW:

When?

The District — the Court of Appeals

55
said in four to seven days.
QUESTION:

What do you say?

MR. ROGOW:

Frankly, I say within 24 hours, if

the sides are prepared.

A man's liberty should not be taken

away for more than 24 hours, without opportunity to test it.
And we look to Argersinger for support.
Because in Argersinger the Court said, You cannot
take away a man's liberty for 24 hours without counsel, and
now we're talking about taking away his liberty for 24 hours
or more without even a hearing.
QUESTION:

Well, if it's constitutionally valid

for 24 hours, why isn't it valid for 36 hours or 43 hours?
MR. ROCOW:

But the line has to be

drawn some­

the State can carry out its obligation to arrest people who
possibly have committed crimes,
QUESTION:

Well, this is possibly, by a definition

it's their being arrested on probable cause.
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir.

Untested,probable cause,

but probable cause, which we concede is sufficient, for the
arrest.

56
The question, I believe that. Your Honor asked me,
was How long afterwards must that probable cause be tested?
and my response was;

In Argersinger, it was 24 hours, but

the Fifth Circuit said four to seven days.
QUESTION: Well, the point of a warrant, of an
arrest warrant is to test the probable cause, isn’t it?
MR. ROGOW:

Not for —

That's a Fourth Amendment probable cause determination,

We are talking about a due process opportunity tc
contest, or test that Fourth Amendment non-adversarial
determination of probable cause that's made.

And we look

to the property cases, which are before your property is
taken you have a right to contest that taking.
And all we're saying is after your liberty is
taken, there ought to be a right to contest that taking.
QUESTION; Well, but for the Florida cases to the
contrary, 'wouldn't this all be handled bv writ of habeas
corpus in the State court?
MR, ROGOW;

Yes, sir.

If the State court had

permitted us to test probable cause through habeas corpus —

57
QUESTION:
MR, ROGOV?:

You wouldn't be here?
No, sir.

We would, not.

It would be

strictly a State matter.
QUESTION;
MR. ROGOV?:

So that's your real complaint,, isn't, it?
That Florida law absolutely forbids an

inquiry into probable cause when an information is filed?
yes, sir, that is our real
QUESTION:
MR. ROGOVI:

By habeas corpus,
By any means.

By any means.

Because information stands for probable cause.
QUESTION:

If you could raise it on habeas corpus,

you wouldn't be here?
MR. ROGOV?;

That’s right.

If we could raise it successfully

in Florida, or

be heard on it in Florida, we would not be here.
QUESTION:

Well, I’m not talking about successfully.

MR. ROGOV?:

Well, I say successfully only because

the habeas corpus petition would be dismissed in Florida
right away, because the issue that would be raised —
QUESTION:

My point was, if it could be raised and

could be considered, and the judge sitting on a habeas corpus
could inquire into it, you would have no complaint.
MR. ROGOV?;

Absolutely.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Then habeas corpus —■

Not automatic.

We agree.

You don't need it

MR. R0G0V7:

Whan you say do you used it automatic,

QUESTION;

Well, according to your rule, every

man that's now in jail has to go before somebody within
24 hours, or turn him loose.
My suggestion is you don't get that release unless
you, yourself, go for habeas corpus.
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION;
MR. ROGOW:

I see what —
Now, which do you agree on?
I sea the point Your Honor makes, and

I may back off a little bit

from my point.

Because if,

in asserting your habeas corpus right it's incumbent upon
you to test your probable cause — to test probable cause,
that may not meet due process.
I really

this case, of course, was raised in

the framework of the existing Florida law *—
QUESTION:

But if you just get rid of habeas

corpus, everybody is automatically having a hearing on

I;m sure you don't mean that.
But a hearing certainly if your

QUESTION: Didn't the State say something this
morning about -die right to move forthwith to dismiss,
which would afford a test of the probable cause?
MR. ROGOV!;

That motion to dismiss, which the

State spoke about, can be traversed, merely by filing a
traverse by the State Attorney.
can

And so the State Attorney

dispute whatever statements are made and then the

trial judge cannot dismiss the case.
So, again, it's certainly within the power of the
State Attorney to make all these determinations of probable
cause.
That motion to dismiss, in a way, I suppose, is
really illusory, because all the State need do is not
acquiesce in it, and it's an unsuccessful and futile remedy.
QUESTION:

What is your position on the question

Justice Marshall asked you a moment ago?

Is it essential

to the constitutionality of the procedure, in your view, that
the probable cause preliminary hearing be .initiated by the
State, or is it enough that the defendant or accused have a
right to initiate if he wants to?
MR. ROGOV”! j

I think that theoretically it ought to

be the State's obligation to provide that proceeding in which
a person can test whether or not probable cause does exist.
If Florida had a different procedure, if it could
have been tested, I don’t know that this case would have been

60

brought.
Frankly, we just had not thought this case through
in light of a non-existent situation.
The situation existed, and that’s what we were
addressing ourselves to.
QUESTION;

May I ask you about the Florida

practice, where there is an indictment pursuant to a grand
jury, what is your position as to an adversary hearing to
determine whether there was probable cause for the issuance
of the indictment?
MR. ROGOW:

We take no position on that question.

We do not s-ay that after an indictment there must be an
aveersarial hearing.
In order to say that, one would have to assume that
the historical protections, which this Court has found in
the indictment procedures, no longer exist.
It reminds one of the fact that John Pieter Sanger,
when he was sought to be prosecuted by the Crown twice, they
sought indictments, and twice they failed.

And finally

they resorted to an information to prosecute him.
Now, if the protection which Sanger had no longer
exists, then perhaps our case might spawn future litigation,
but we take no position on that, and this record does not
accord the Court an opportunity to get to that question,
because there is no showing an indictments do not really

protect, the individual.
The cases cited by the State,

Hurtado, Lem Woon,

Ocampo, Beck, have no application in this case.

Those

cases — and Hurtado, as a matter of fact, as an information
filed after a preliminary hearing, so Hurtado certainly has
no real effect on this case.

The other cases talk about the

fact that there is no need for a preliminary hearing prior
to the issuance of an information.
And we agree with that position.

Fine.

Lei: the

information issue.
But after the information issues, there must be a
subsequent determination of probable cause.
QUESTION;

There is —-

Would you think that — would your

problems be satisfied if Florida procedure provided that upon
request a . preliminary probable-cause hearing would be held
forthwith?
HR. ROGOW;

It might.

It might.

I just — as a

pure due process matter, we think it’s incument upon the
State.

If you can make the request, and it be granted --

notwithstanding the filing of information — I would certainly
say that would lessen our argument somewhat.

MR. ROGOW:

Well, wouldn’t, on 'the contrary isn’t it
t

that they have committed some crime, and that they're not

MR. ROGOW:
right.

And of coruse they could waive their

If the State said, Here's your preliminary hearing

and the defendant or his lawyer could sav,

Y&es, I waive

my right.
QUESTION:

Then we come back to where I was.

Then your answer to ray question is that if they are offered
a prompt hearing, that would satisfy the due process complaint
that you are uring on -the Court?
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, if they were offered.

The only

63
difficulty I find with your question, Mr. Chief Justice, is
that it would require them to initiate that, request .by seeking
out the probable cause hearing,
I think if there is an offer and they say, I waive
it; fine.

That can be waived.
There's another distinguishing characteristic

between Lem Woom,

Ocampo and Beck and this case, and that

the Court of Appeals cases, which have been cited by the State,
all of those cases sought to overturn otherwise valid
convictions.
We do not seek to overturn an otherwise valid
conviction.

We do not say that a man cannot have a fair

trial without a preliminary hearing.
What we say .is that he cannot be fairly deprived of
his liberty without a preliminary hearing.
And that distinction runs through all of the cases
cited by the State and the State Attorney and this case.
There is no bar.

And I’m suggesting you're not really

saying that, either.
Because, as you've conceded, people are deprived

MR. ROGOSJ:

open-ended.

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. ROGOW:

Yes, sir.

The State has also raised the question of Younger
vs. Harris, which in some ways runs along with the Preiser
vs. Rodrigues issue, and I think I should address that very
briefly.
Botli tlie District Court and the Fifth Circuit
agree that Younger vs. Harris was not applicable, because what
we were seeking here was a pretrial procedural right, and
no interference with the State court proceedings at all.
Any decision which would be made would be made by State

69

judges.

There was great respect for coralty.

But even if

Younger vs. Harris had some application in this case, we
have an exception to it, because there is irreparable injury,
the taking of liberty without a hearing, and there is
absolutely no way to test that taking of liberty in the
Florida courts.
QUESTION: Well, I wonder about that.

I understand

the courts, the District Court and the Court of Appeals,
addressed theraselves to the Younger problem, and s,aid it was
not applicable, or at least didn't control here for the
reasons, at -least one of the reasons you give.
But the Court of Appeals said something which I am
not sure would be an answer to the exhaustion requirement of
the federal habeas corpus case, which is considerably
different-.
The Court of Appeals said: While the plaintiffs
might have filed suit in State court for a declaratory
judgment and other equitable relief, based upon the same
grounds as in this suit.
Now, it may be true there wouldn’t be a remedy
in the criminal case.

That doesn^t mean that in an independent

action there would be not be relief available in the State
courts.
MR. ROGOW:
law is clear, the ..case

I believe it does, because the State
would be dismissed.

70

QUESTION: Well, it may be, but this is what the
Court of Appeals said.
MR. ROGOW:

I understand that.

QUESTION: And who are we supposed to believe?
The Court of Appeals says that 'there is a — that they could
have sought these same grounds — that this remedy was open
to them..
Now, it may be that the answer on the merits has
been foreclosed in the State courts.

Maybe that’s true.

Because that’s what you're talking about, isn't it?
MR. ROGOW:
QUESTION:

It is true.

I think —

.But it isn't that there is — that the

remedy — that -there isn't a procedural remedy available?
MR. ROGOW:

Certainly, there is a procedural

remedy.
QUESTION:

Well, that’s what — all right, that's

what I **- you go ahead, then.
MR. ROGOW:

Which is wholly futile.

Justice Frankfurter wrote that due process is
compounded of history and fairness and reason. And our
position is that history and fairness and reason all compel
the conclusion that preliminary hearings for a person
incarcerated, in custody, deprived of his liberty, must be
given, under the due process clause.
