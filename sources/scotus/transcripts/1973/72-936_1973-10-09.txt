PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-936, United States against Robinson.
Mr. Tuttle, whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLAN A. TUTTLE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TtJTTLE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case, as the Court is aware, presents questions
quits similar to those raised in Gustafson vs. State of Florida,
which you’ve just heard.
There are also differences, which I hope to point
out in the course of my argument.
But basically we are concerned here with the scope
of a permissible search for weapons incident to a lawful
custodial arrest.

And the arrest here occurred in April

1968, when Officer Richard Jenks of the Metropolitan Police
Department, here in the District, arrested the respondent
Robinson for the crime of driving after ret'ocation of his
operator’s permit and for obtaining a permit by misrepresenta­
tion.
In the course of a search of Robinson incident to
that arrest. Officer Jenks discovered heroin, and that
heroin became the basis of a prosecution for unlawful
possession of heroin.

4
He was convicted of that offense in August of 1969
and an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals.
The procedural history here is a little involved.
The Court of Appeals, a panel of the Court of Appeals reversed
respondent's conviction on the ground that the seizure had
been illegal.
However, the case was then heard en banc by the entire
Court of Appeals, and they remanded the case to the District
Court for an evidentiary hearing on the scope of the search
incident to the April 23rd arrest.
Then, after the evidentiary hearing, the en banc
Court again heard the case, and this time, by a vote of 5 to 4,
held that Officer Jenks1 search had exceeded the scope of a
permissible weapons search incident to this arrest.
Now, the facts of the search can be briefly
summarized.
The arrest here occurred on April 23rd of 1968.

A

few days prior to that time Officer Jenks had stopped the
respondent Robinson in a routine traffic check.

He noticed a

discrepancy between the birth dates on the respondent's
temporary operator's permit and the birth date on his draft
card.
QUESTION: What do you mean by a routine traffic
check?
MR. TUTTLE:

I mean a stop where the officer will

5

bring a car to the curb that he observes, for any reason that
leads him to wish to check whether or not the driver is duly
licensed and the car is properly registered.
QUESTIONS

What was the reason in this instance?

MR. TUTTLE; The record does not reveal any
particular reason in this case.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that, as I drive home,

an officer can insist that I pull over to the curb where ha
can ask to look at my license?
MR. TUTTLE;

Absolutely.

Yes.

I do believe that —
QUESTION; Well, you said "routine".

Do you mean

"routine" or "random"?
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, I mean it was routine

in that

it is a practice of the Metropolitan Police Department to
do this, this kind of stop, on a random basis.

It is

random, but it's also routine, in that it's not unusual.
That1s what I meant.
I may say —
QUESTION:

Have you ever experienced this in

Washington?
MR. TUTTLE;
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

Such a stop?
Yes.
I have been — I have been stopped, but

QUESTION: Did you ever have that happen to you?

6

MR. TUTTLEs

In that particular circumstance?

No, I haven't.
QUESTION:

Neither have I, in seventeen years.

MR.TUTTLE:

Well, I may say that —

QUESTION:

I wander how "routine" it is.

MR. TUTTLE:

— this is not a question before the

Court, unless the Court wishes to make it a question.
The —
QUESTION: Well, I thought you were relying on the
fact that this was something called a routine traffic —
in support of your —
MR. TUTTLE:

I’m relying -- I’m relying, in the last

analysis, on the fact that this was a concededly lawful
arrest.

Now, perhaps Your Honor is confused between the dates,

and I was trying to make a distinction between the date of
April 19th, when this stop occurred and the license check
was made, because no arrest was made at that time.

And it

was only later, after the officer had checked those dates
which — where he saw the discrepancy, through the traffic
records and discovered, by checking those dates, that
Robinson’s regular operator's permit had bean previously
revoked.
But going back to the original stop, that was never
questioned throughout this trial.

There was a question in the

initial trial of this case, when Robinson had a different

trial counsel, where he suggested that perhaps the scope of
the routine traffic check was excessive, that it was
?

permissible, and under the Minsey case in the District it
has been held permissible, to make these stops.

But he

suggested that having received the temporary operator’s
permit, he had no right to look at the draft card.
Now, that argument did not prevail in the District
Court and has not been advanced since that time.

And 1

think for the purposes of this Court we have to assume, as
the Court of Appeals did, and as has every court which has
considered the matter, that this routine traffic check was
permissible and lawful.
QUESTION: But whether it was or not, I gather there’s
no challenge to the arrest here, is there?
MR. TUTTLE:
here in this Court.

There is no challenge to the arrest
I want to come to a question which is

bruted in the brief a little bit about the question of whether
this second arrest might have been a pretext for a narcotics
search.

And, with the Court's permission, I'll come to that

in the course of my exposition.
QUESTION: All right.
MR. TUTTLE:

After it had been determined that there

had been this revocation of Robinson's regular operator's
permit, the next day, after he made that determination in the
traffic records. Officer Jenks saw Robinson again driving,

8

not far from here, on Eighth and C Streets, Northeast [sic},
and pulled the respondent over in order to arrest him for the
crime of driving after revocation of his temporary operator’s
permit.
Now, the respondent got out of the car and walked
toward the police officer.

The police officer then, asked

Robinson for his operator’s permit, the temporary operator’s
permit which he had previously seen. And, upon receiving it,
informed Robinson that he was under arrest for driving after
revocation of his regular operator's permit and for obtaining
his temporary permit by misrepresentation.
Now, at that point, as required by the standing
orders of the Metropolitan Police Department, he proceeded to
search Robinson.

In this case they were standing face to face

outside the automobiles.

And Officer Jenks placed his hands

on the respondent’s chest, h.is left hand — his right hand on
respondent’s left breast.

Almost immediately he felt an

object inside the pocket of the car coat that Robinson was
wearing.

He felt an object in the left breast pocket.

Now, the record shows that Officer Jenks didn't know what
that object was.

He couldn’t tell its sise or he couldn’t

tell whether it was hard or whether it was soft.
Officer Jenks then reached into the pocket and pulled
the package out.
of cigarettes.

And the package was a crumpled-up package
Officer Jenks at that point, the record shows,

s
knew that the package did not contain cigarettes, because of
its crumpled condition, and he didn’t know what it did contain.
He opened it up and he found the heroin, which is the
subject of this prosecution.
Now, in light of some of the questions asked in the
previous argument, I think I should state that the record
indicates that Officer Jenks was not in any imminent sense
of danger, did not feel in any imminent sense of danger.

He

had a substantial weight advantage over the respondent, and
wasn't in any particular fear in conducting this arrest; nor
did he have any specific purpose in mind when he conducted
the arrest.
What he said was, when asked, "I just searched him,
I didn't think about what I was looking for, I just searched
him,w
He did say that he recognized that the rules which
required the search were designed for his own safety and were
designed to uncover any weapons which might have been used to
harm him.
Now, if I may mention one or two preliminary matters.
First of all, unlike Gustafson, the government here does not
advance any evidentiary basis for this search.

We predicate

the search entirely on the right to search for weapons.
We believe that he had all the evidence he needed when he
had the temporary operator's permit.

10
Now, going to an argument I mentioned a moment
QUESTION;

His right to search for weapons but

incident to a lawful arrest.
MR. TUTTLEs

Oh, of course.

I — the arrest was

conceded by the Court: of Appeals to be lawful when they remanded
it.

They didn't remand it to determine the lawfulness of the

arrest, they remanded it because the original record didn't
show enough facts about the scope of the search.
Now, the search here, or the arrest here was not a pretext
for a narcotics search.
QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Tuttle, I thought your argument

— and maybe it's what you said ■— was that if there is a valid
arrest of a person, then the law, the settled law is that
there is, there can be a, constitutionally a valid complete
search of his person.

The rationale for that being that he

might have weapons or that there might be destructible
evidence.

But whatever the rationale, the law, the

constitutional law is that there can be a complete search of
his person, isn't that your argument?
MR. ..TUTTLE:

It's conceivable, it's conceivable to

me that there might be a search which would exceed the scops
of a permissible search for weapons.
If I see a folded piece — not a folded, but a piece
of paper in a person's pocket, which might be a written
confession of a crime, if I were conducting an evidentiary

II
search, I might want to look at it.

If I were conducting a

weapons search
QUESTION:

How about a sealed envelope?

MR. TUTTLE;

Well, I’d have to develop the

hypothetical a little bit.

If it ware solid or had any

kind of solidity to it —
QUESTION:

No, it’s just a sealed envelope.

MR. TUTTLE:

— so that it might contain a razor

blade or some such thing, then I would say it would be a
permissible weapons search.
But, as I say, it is conceivable.

And that's why I

say that I don't go quite as far as you suggest, Mr.
Justice, because it's conceivable that an evidentiary
search might, in certain circumstances, be of a broader
scope than a permissible weapons search.
QUESTION;

Or a border search, looking in body

cavities and whatnot.

We’re not talking about that.

MR. TUTTLE; Well, of course we're not. Because that
?
would raise the Roachin kind of problem, —
QUESTION; Right.
MR. TUTTLE;

— and that would be beyond the scope

of a permissible weapons search.
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE;

Right.
Our basic position is that it's not

only where there is an arrest that we feel that a complete

12

search for weapons is permissible, but it is where there is a
custodial arrest.
It's important to realize that in this case we’re
not dealing with a minor traffic offense.

The crime of

driving after revocation of your operator’s permit is a
statutory offense, defined by Congress.

It carries a minimum

of thirty days in jail and a maximum of a year.
QUESTION: What’s the distinction between arrest and
custodial arrest?
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, I would — I would not want to

argue that when a police officer stops a car to issue a
summons that that was not an arrest.
restriction on the person's movement.

There is, after all, a
And yet we concede,

and it is the practice here in the District, where there is an
issuance of a summons, not to conduct the full custody field
search that is required in the case of custodial arrest.
That’s why I want to make the distinction, that the
regulations of the Police Department require that this
individual be taken into custody, require him to be taken
down to the station house for booking.

And also the

regulations of the Police Department require that whenever
such an arrest is made, a so-called custody arrest, that a
full field search be made of the individual for anything that
he might have on him, be it evidence or be it weapons.
QUESTION:

Could he be handcuffed?

13

MR, TUTTLEs Excuse me?
QUESTION:
MR, TUTTLE:

Could they handcuff him?
He didn't — could he'br did he?

QUESTION: Could he?
MR. TUTTLE:

He could, but, Your Honor, I think that

that —

QUESTION:

Would the officer be pretty safe then?

MR. TUTTLE: Well, Officer — the Court is probably
aware that last month Officer Fomraining in the Police Porce
in Arlington was shot and killed by a man that he handcuffed,
I think that handcuffing ~~
QUESTION:

I'm also aware of a prisoner that was shot

and killed while handcuffed and shackled.

What's that got. to

do with my point?
MR, TUTTLE:

It has to do, Mr. Justice, with the

point, I believe, that handcuffing is not an adequate
protection for police officers conducting custodial arrests.
And I just cite that as a single recent example.
QUESTION: Well, I ask you what I asked in the other
case:

Once he had this crumpled package of cigarettes in

his hand, I understand you’re not relying on the evidentiarysearch; am I right?
MR, TUTTLE:

That's correct.

QUESTION: Well, once he had this possible weapons in
his hand, how could the prisoner use that weapon?

14
ME. TUTTLE:

He could not use that particular weapon.

But I believe that the search of that container, which could
have contained a weapon, was wholly justified, for a number
of reasons.
First of all, every search which is conducted by any
officer is different, and everything an officer sees tells him
something about how far he has to go to be safe in conducting
the search.
And I think an examination of a closed container on a
person is part of the — helps the officer to know, by
looking at it, whether or not he’s dealing with a dangerous
person.

If there is nothing dangerous in that container, he

would return it, presumably.

If there is, he may feel the

need to go further,
QUESTION: Would that go for a wallet?
MR. TUTTLE:

It. might.

If the officer felt

QUESTION: Well, is there anything on the man's
possession, in his possession, that is safe from search and
seizure; anything?
MR, TUTTLE:

Anything that could contain a weapon

subject, or that could possibly —
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

That would include a handkerchief.
— subject the officer to injury.

QUESTION: Wouldn't that include a handkerchief?
MR. TUTTLE:

I — if it were folded, possibly.

15

QUESTION: So nothing is safe.
MR. TUTTLE: Well, there are a number of reasons
why —
QUESTION:

I'm just trying to have something of mine

that would be safe; that's all I'm trying to do.
MR. TUTTLE: Well, it's all safe.
it.

Nothing happens to

Presumably, if it’s an innocent object, a key case with

nothing but keys in it, it would be returned to you.
QUESTION:
it.

Oh, then it depends on what you find in

That what's found in it justifies the search.

You're

not —
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

Absolutely not.
I'm sure you're not.
I’m saying —
Excuse me there.

Suppose you find in that

carton a razor with a small holder, so that it could be used
as a weapon, and —
MR. TUTTLE:

It would — it could certainly be

introduced in evidence against the person, for carrying
a concealed weapon.
QUESTION:

And would it suggest to the officer, as I

think Mr. Justice White brought out in the prior case, that
the man had a razor in a holder that could be used as a
weapon, he might have some other weapons on him that would
justify a more extensive search?

16
MR. TUTTLE: That was the point, Mr. Chief Justice,
I was trying to make by suggesting that the search of these
containers gives the officer information about the kind of
possible dangers he may be facing,
I also think that the suggestion that Mr. Justice
Marshall makes would create substantial custodial problems
for the police.

In order to be safe, they would have to

remove anything that was a closed container from the person
arrested, and somehow try and handle that while they were
handling the individual subject to arrest.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tuttle, wouldn’t the proposition put

to you by Mr. Justice Stewart earlier and put to counsel in
the preceding case by Mr. Justice Brennan, that is, that
where you have a valid arrest you may have a full field
search without further inquiry, solve a lot of the kind of
parsing of factual situations and at least offer a certain
simplicity of administration of a full field search?
MR. TUTTLE: Well, we do — we do think that such a
rule, of course, would be understandable and managable by
police officers attempting to deal with situations on the
street, and that a rule which required an officer, in every
instance, to determine that a search has an evidentiary
purpose or has a weapons purpose, is perhaps going to be
confusing for police officers.
In fact, the record supports your point, Mr. Justice.

17
There was testimony from an Officer Donaldson, a police
instructor, who testified that time is of the essence in
conducting a custodial arrest.

And that if an officer had to

stop and think "now I'm searching for this? now I'm searching
for that", that he wouldn’t be able to react in a manner that
would enable him to conduct a safe and speady arrest.
It's also true that if we do adopt the kind of
distinctions that the respondent is urging here, we are
going to be faced with a whole new set of problems in
litigation.

We'll be litigating in every instance, whether

a particular kind of crime is one that's likely to produce
evidence, and even where it's conceded that the crime, as
evidenced — I believe one of the Justices mentioned the
possibility of an arrest for stealing a television or some
such thing.

That we'll be litigating whether or not evidence

of a particular size and consistency was likely to have
resulted from a given kind of crime.
And I think that to require officers to try and make
these judgments every time they impose a custodial arrest in
a street situation would be an unmanagable problem, and
would also, as I have indicated, create a whole new set of
litigation problems for this Court.
QUESTION: Well, that's what I thought your argument
was, and that's the reason I didn't really quite understand
your question to one of the — your answer to one of the

18
questions from the bench that it might make a difference
whether a razor blade were found or were not found in a
cigarette case.

I thought —

MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION;
MR. TUTTLE:

No, I never —
— you were basing your argument —
— would make any difference where it

was found —
QUESTION:

I thought your argument was that when

there’s a valid custodial arrest, there can be a full field
search, period.
Isn't that your argument?
MR. TUTTLE; That's — that is our basic argument,
but -—
QUESTION: That’s what I thought.
MR. TUTTLE;

— but we do concede that searches could

be excessive.
QUESTION; Well, since —
MR. TUTTLE;

And searches are justified, in our

view searches are justified by the reason which gives rise
to the right to make the search.
QUESTION;

And

What more reason do you need under your

theory than a valid arrest?
MR. TUTTLE:

If it is, as in this case, a search for

weapons, then the reasonable possibility of finding weapons
would indicate the — would indicate the reasonable extent

19

of the search.
QUESTION: But you apparently want to litigate the
specific facts of every arrest, when there’s a search for
weapons.
MR. TUTTLE: Well, I recognize, Mr. Justice White,
that there are two possible -- there’s more than one real
ground upon which the Court could

is prepared to hold

sustain the search here.
that, as Mr. Justice

Rehnguist has suggested, that a valid arrest ends the inquiry,
then there would not be — then we would solve certain
problems —

That has ended it up to now, hasn’t it?

TUTTLE:

case, that’s

QUESTION: Right.

able to trace it.

And until this case in the Court of

Appeals.
QUESTION: That’s fairly long.
MR, TUTTLE: This is the first case that I know of
where a challenge has been made and made successfully in
the court below, that there ought to be limitations on the
scope of a search incident to an arrest,
QUESTION:

Well, it’s the decision of the court

•*
‘0

.

below that’s
the aberration, certainly, not the , -a~i—
Weeks
case.
• ** r>
MR. TUTTLE: Absolutely.

And I would call the Court's

20

attention to the decision in the Worthy case, which was a
decision of the Court of Appeals, in which the Chief Justice
sat on the panel, where the court below, a panel of the court
below rejected an attempt to impose limitations on a search
incident to a vagrancy arrest there.
And I think it's very significant that the dissent
in that case was written by Judge Wright, who wrote the
majority opinion below.

And in the dissent, in 1969, Judge

Wright was prepared to say that there was no law supporting
his view that a search for an arrest for vagrancy was
impermissible.
In 1972 he has the majority of the court with him.
But it's unquestionably true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that this
is a new idea.
QUESTION:

Do you think the question in any way

turned on the fact that the arrest there was for vagrancy?
MR. TUTTLE: The question — where?
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

You recall in — in Preston, —
Yes,
*— you remember, we held invalid an

automobile search.
MR. TUTTLE:

Yes.

QUESTION: And that search, while not at the scene, as
I recall it — I don't know about that ■—
MR. TUTTLE:

It was back at the police station.

21
QUESTION;

— but, nevertheless, the original arrest

was for vagrancy.
MR. TUTTLE: And the Court held that there was no
reason to think that evidence would be found in the car that
would relate —
QUESTION:

Well, I just wondered, do you think that

Preston in any way rested on the fact that the arrest there
was for vagrancy?
MR. TUTTLE:

I think it did.

But there there was the

question of a search — there there was the question of an
evidentiary search, and that no evidence would be found»
QUESTION: But the Court held there that it was not
a search incident to an arrest, the same as Stoner v,
California.

It was simply not a search incident to an arrest.

MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

Well, but under —
That question doesn't —
— Chamber v, Moroney, if we were to

take the case forward today, the Court — there's a question
whether the Court would come out the same way.

But if they

did come out the same way as they did in Preston, it would be
because there was no reason to believe that evidence of
vagrancy would be found in the search of an automobile,
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't the time factor enter

into it also, that they didn't search the car in Preston until
either several hours, or some substantial time after the

22

original arrest?
MR. TUTTLE:

Yes, which wade it not incident to the

arrest.
QUESTION:

So that it wasn’t incidental to the arrest

in Preston.
MR. TUTTLE:

Yes.

But I'm saying that perhaps that

analysis of Preston is affected by the Court’s decision in
Chambers, which would have allowed a search a few hours later
at a different place, where there's a valid reason to search.
Whereas in Preston, since it was a vagrancy arrest,
there was no valid reason to search.
I'd like to make one final point about Mr. —relating to Mr. Justice Marshall's suggestion about keeping
the object away from the person.

And that is that this Court

has never made such a suggestion before, and, indeed, has,
I think, held the opposite, in one case that comes to mind.
Your Honors will recall, we've been discussing this
morning the Peters case.

Well, in Petersf Officer Laskey

was conducting a weapons search and he patted Peters down, and
he felt an object which, under Terry, he had a right to
remove; namely, a hard object, which could have been a weapon.
He removed it.
But what is significant for the purpose? of our
present argument is that what he found was a closed opaque
plastic envelope.

And of course he then opened it, and

23

discovered not a weapon but burglary tools.
And at that time no one questioned that, having
taken that object away from Peters, Officer Laskey should
simply have held it at a distance.

It was considered

reasonable for him to look at it at that time.
I suggest the same analysis applies here, that it
was reasonable for the officer to look inside this package,
once he had it out of — in his hands and out of the reach
of Robinson.
QUESTION t

And what could he have found in there

that would have endangered him?
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
right?

Well, Your Honor, we —
You said it was folded up like this,

Folded up like this.
MR. TUTTLE:

Yes, a crurapied-up package.

Your

Honor, —
QUESTION:

So it wasn’t a razor blade, was it?

MR. TUTTLE: That was in it?
QUESTION:
MR, TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

Yes.

It couldn't have been, I mean.

It perhaps could have been.
A collapsible razor blade,
Your Honor, we attempted to develop a

record on the question of what kinds of things might be
found in a small container in the hearing on remand, and an
officer, or rather a clandestine weapons expert, a Mr.

24
Newhouser, —
QUESTION:

Got on the stand with things taped all

over his body.
MR. TUTTLE:

He had approximately 25 weapons that

were — had the possibility of subjecting somebody to injury.
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

He had a letter bomb on him?
He did not have a letter bomb on him,

QUESTION: Well, how did he forget that?
MR. TUTTLE:

He — he could have, but, as a matter

of fact, he didn't have such an item on him.

He testified that

many of these weapons were small enough to fit inside a
cigarette package, and, in fact, one of them I think was
carried in a cigarette package.
And I think it's significant that he testified that
only a really thorough-going search, which would have
included going under his belt, going in the waistline, and
turning out and examining all pockets —
QUESTION: But my point is —
MR, TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

— would have revealed the weapons.
But granting that he had the right to

take the package out, the crumpled-up thing, why did he have
to open it?

That's my only point.

MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:
MR. TUTTLE:

I've suggested *—
Other than to search for evidence.
I've suggested several considerations,

25

One is to assure himself that there was nothing like a weapon
inside it.

I've suggested that if he couldn’t do —

QUESTION:

Would he have given it back to him if

there was nothing in it?
MR. TUTTLE:

Yes, he would have.

And if he couldn't,

he’d be subjected to all kinds of difficulties of custodial
obligations attaching to it.

And I've suggested that in the

Peters case the Court has suggested that that is a perfectly
permissible practice.
Now, I'd like to point out one fact that is argued
an argument which is made by respondent's counsel.

He argues

that this expert's evidence shows really the opposite of what
we argue that it shows.

He argues that it shows that a

pat-down is adequate.
And I suggest that the confusion there arises from a
confusion as to what a frisk really is.

And a search of the

record indicates that in this case Mr. Gartlan quoted some
language from Terry to the police officer— or, excuse me,
the weapons expert, which involved a thorough search of the
body, in the groin, in the testicles, and it goes on to
describe that search.
Now, that — the '8xr-ert there testified that that
was not a frisk, and it was not his view of a frisk.

And

I've attempted to demonstrate in the brief that that
language was never intended to be a definition of a frisk.

26
And I think that if the Court reads the record with that in
mind, and with the fact in mind that the expert did testify
that it would be required in order to conduct a really
thorough search, that the officer go into the pockets, that
it's quite clear from the record that a Terry type frisk would
be inadequate to reveal all the weapons that could be hidden.
Now, there is a second point that we raise in the
brief, relating to the question that if the Court finds that
reaching into the pocket did infringe Robinson’s Fourth
Amendment rights, it would have been a minimal violation at
most.

And we suggest that the deterrent purpose of the

exclusionary rule would not be well served by excluding
evidence which is the result of a policeman's protective
search.
But I don't believe that I have to go into that at
this point because I believe *— first of all, ray time is
about to expire; and secondly I believe that this search
was thoroughly reasonable, and that the conviction ought to
be sustained on that ground.
Thank you.
QUESTION:

That last reference to your argument

is, in effect, asking us to overrule Weeks v. United States,
isn't it?
MR. TUTTLE:

It would ask you to modify it, yes.

Because it — we don't ask you to —

27
QUESTION:

That was decided in 1914, was it not?

MB. TUTTLE:

We •— if the Court reached that point,

it would not be that we would be asking for the total
abolition of the exclusionary rule, but for a consideration
of the extent of deviation from normal behavior.
QUESTION:

Yes, but Weeks established the exclusionary

rule, as such, in the Federal Courts.
ME. TUTTLE:

And there’s no question that every

case, including up through, I think, a recent example is
Davis, indicates that the Court has never adopted such a
rule.

That’s quite true.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Gartlan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH V. GARTLAN, JR., ESQ-,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GARTLAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As we understand the Government's position in this
case, it basically takes three things.
First of all, that there is nothing in the Terry case,
the 'Sibron case, or the Peters case, which limits the scope
of a post~arrest search? and that the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia confused two distinct
sets of principles applicable to Fourth Amendment searches
by disregarding the significance of a lawful arrest.

28

The second theme of the Government's argument is that
the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia's
instruction to its police officers, with respect to the extent
of a search in this case, this type of case, is a reasonable
type of instruction and approach, that a Terry type frisk is
not adequate protection in the instance of a full custody
arrest.
And, finally, the attack upon the exclusionary rule
and the request that it be modified in cases of this type.
It seems to us clear, addressing myself to the first
point, that in Terry this Court rejected a notion advanced
by the State of Ohio that the Fourth Amendment doesn't even
come into play as a limitation upon police conduct if the
officer stops short of something called a technical arrest
or a full-blown search.
And this Court went further to say that the sounder
course of analysis, in Fourth Amendment cases, is to recognize
that the Fourth Amendment governs all intrusions by agents
of the public upon personal security, and to make the scope
of the particular intrusion, in the light of all of the
exigencies of the case, a central element in the analysis of
reasonableness.
Then in Peters we had a case where, for the purposes
of constitutional analysis, an arrest had taken place when
Officer Laskey apprehended Peters in the hallway of his

29

apartment.
And this Court said, with respect to the pat-down
type of search that was conducted by Officer Laskey, that this
was reasonably limited in its scope to its evidentiary and
protective purposes and was not an unrestrained and thorough­
going examination of the arrestee and his personal effects.
Mow, the Government has pointed out in this case
Kr. Justice Harlan's observation of that language in the Terry
decision.

Mr. Justice Harlan said that's all it was, an

observation, and that the Court was — and in other words,
the Court was not saying, in Terry, that a protective search
incident to a lawful arrest is limited to a frisk.
.But this Court, in Chime 1, shortly after Terry, said,
as to its decision in Petersand I quote:

"We sustained the

search in Peters, however, only because its scope had been
reasonably limited by the need to seize weapons and to
prevent the destruction of evidence.

We emphasise", again

quoting from this Court's decision, "that the arresting
officer did not engage in an unrestrained and thorough­
going examination; of deters and his personal effects."
So it seems to me that in —* certainly in Peters,
this case was — this Court was taking the scope limitation
principles applied truly enough in a different context in
Terry, and making an application of them in a new context,
a post-arrest situation.

30

And in Sibron, the third case in the trilogy, while
there the Court found that —* this Court found there was no
probable cause for the arrest, and that the circumstances
were therefore the equivalent of the stop-and-frisk situation
confronting the officer in Terry, in its opinion it assumed
arguendo that would, even though — if the circumstances of
apprehension and fear had been present in the Sibron case as
they had been in Terry, thus making it, for the purposes of
protection of a police officer, the equivalent of a post­
arrest situation, then the search into Sibron’s pockets
was going too far, under those circumstances.
QUESTION:

Are you reading the Terry case type

of search as a limitation, as defining the outer boundaries
of the kind of a search which can be made after a lawful
arrest?
MR. GARTLAN:

I am reading it as an articulation cf

principles, Mr. Chief Justice, that apply to all intrusions,
and since a search incident to a lawful arrest is an intrusion
yes.
And I think that the language in Terry is rather
explicit in that regard,
QUESTION:

Peters, if I remember correctly — tell

me if I'm wrong — the Peters case did involve a lawful
arrest, did it not?
MR. GARTLAN:

The Court found —
The Court found that it did, yes.

QUESTION? The Court here found that there was
probable cause to arrest.
MR. GARTLAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And that that search, therefore, was,

by definition, incident to a lawful arrest.
MS. GARTLAN:

That's correct.

But they did, this

Court did take pains to note that Officer Laskey's search
in Terry, even though incident to a lawful arrest, was —
QUESTION:

In Terry or in Peters?

MR. GARTLAN:
QUESTION:

I»m sorry.

In Peters.

That's what I thought.

MR. GARTLAN:

— was not thorough-going and

unrestrained and was limited to the purposes for which it
could be made, which justified it in its inception.
This Court said in Terry;

This Court has held in

the past — and that is why I think the decision in the
United States Court of Appeals for this Circuit was not an
aberration — this Court has held in the past that a search,
which is reasonable at its inception may violate the Fourth
Amendment by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope.
Citing authorities.
The scope of the search must be, quote, "strictly
tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered its
initiation permissible," quoting authorities that go all the
way back to the Agnello case.

32

This, the decision of our Court of Appeals was not
an aberration if Terry was not an aberration.

Because what

Terry was was an articulation of scope limitation principles
applicable to these kinds of intrusions, and our case
presented the first opportunity to apply those limitation
principles to a post-custody arrest explicitly.
QUESTION:

But if you rely on that —

MR. GARTLAN:

I think it was done implicitly in the

Terry-Sibron-Peters trilogy,
QUESTION:

But, you make this argument without

regard to what the offense was for which the petitioner was
arrested. The respondent, rather.
MR. GARTLAN:

Yes.

I think there are scope

limitation principles even where a search is justified by
an evidentiary purpose.
QUESTION:

In other words, there's no significance

here that the arrest was connected only with an alleged
traffic offenseMR. GARTLAN:

Yes, there is.

In our case, in terms

of the reasonableness of the arrest, by all means, because QUESTION:

No, no.

MR. GARTLAN:

Assuming — assuming all that -

You mean the reasonableness of the

search.
QUESTION: Assuming that we're — you mean it does,
the scope of the search, assuming a valid arrest, may be

33
on© thing if the arrest is for a minor traffic offense, and
something else if it's for an armed robbery?
MR, GARTLAN:

For this reason:

Yes, sir.

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.

An arrest for an armed robbery clearly

would justify an evidentiary search of the person for the
fruits or the instruments or the instrumentalities or
evidence of that crime.

And to the extent that those might

reasonably be expected to be found upon the person of the
arrestee, given the circumstances at the time and execution
of the arrest, certainly he could be searched for that
purpose,
QUESTION:

Why could you search in a crumpled

cigarette package?
MR. GARTLAN: Why could you not?
QUESTION:

No, I just ask you:

could you search

in a crumpled cigarette package?
MR, GARTLAN;
QUESTION:

In the case of the armed robbery,

MR, GARTLAN;
QUESTION:

Of armed robbery?

Yes.

MR, GARTLAN;
QUESTION:

In an arrest of a sufficient —

Yes,

In my view.

If you’re relying on Terry, as you say,

to support the judgment of the Court of Appeals, that would
be dicta, I take it, since in Terry there was no lawful
arrest,

34

MR. GARTLAN:

As I — I haven't looked up recently

the technical, law dictionary definition of "dicta",
Yes, it was dicta in that the facts of the Terry
case, Mr. Justice Relinquish, did not involve the precise
facts of this case.
But I think this Court was teaching the Federal
judiciary system in Terry the scope limitation principles
applicable, as it said, explicitly to all intrusions, without
limitation,
QUESTION;

Well, one can teach by dicta as well as

by holding.
MR. GARTLAN: That's correct.

And I think that our

Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia was not guilty
of an aberration, it listened to that teaching in this
decision.
QUESTION: And the Peters case is really on all fours
with your case, isn't it?

Constitutionally.

Because there

there was a valid arrest.
MR, GARTLAN:

Yes, sir.

Well, but factually, in Peters, Mr. Justice, there
was a justification, because of the circumstances, for a
search evidentiary in nature, and we don’t have that —
evidentiary in purpose.
QUESTION:

That was a prowler in a Bronx apartment,

MR. GARTLAN:

Yes, sir

35
QUESTION:

— as I remember tbs case; was it not?

MR. GARTLAN:

Yes.

And we don*t have that in this

case.
QUESTIONS

This was cited as a weapons search in

Peters.
MR. GARTLAN;

No, the Court in Peters, Mr. Justice

White, said that that search was properly limited to its
evidentiary and protective purposes.
QUESTION: And protective purposes.
MR. GARTLAN;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; So, in the example a while ago, you said
you might be able to search in a cigarette package, in case
of arrest, for some purposes but not for others.
Now, if you arrest a man in his house for stealing
television sets, and there's a crumpled cigarette package
in his pocket, you would say you couldn't search for that,
the package, in that case?
MR. GARTLAN:

Examine its contents 3„ncidenfc to the

arrest for the theft of the television set?
I wouldn't think so.

And I don't think that this is

much —
QUESTION:

So it really would depend, in each case,

on what the arrest was for, .and what kind of evidence there
might be of a particular kind of crime?
MR. GARTLAN:

I would not want to get that particular-

36
ized.

I would say, obviously, when the arrest is for a critae

for which there is no evidence, as with the situation in
Willie — with Willie Robinson, there can be no evidentiary
justification for the search.
Where there is an arrest for a crime tdiere an
experienced police officer may reasonably expect to find
fruits, instrumentalities or evidence of that crime, not
something he imagines may have happened, but of that crime
for which the arrest is being made, on the person of the
defendant, then he may go into his pockets.

He is not

restrained.
And if it were for the crime of stealing money, I
would think if he discovered a cigarette package in a. pocket,
he could examine that for that purpose.
QUESTION: Well, let's see, dealing with our case,
the Robinson case, your submission is that a search with an
evidentiary purpose could not, could not be permissible in
the circumstances?
MR. GARTLAN: The Government stipulates that in this
case.
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well now, does that go so far as to

suggest that it was wrong even to go into Robinson's
pocket for the crumpled-up cigarette package?

Or is it

wrong only to open the package?
MR. GARTLAN:

I think, in the light of the record in

37

this case, it was wrong to go into that pocket.
On cross-examination, at the remand hearing, Sergeant
Donaldson was asked by me whether, if Officer Jenks at the
scene had in fact been conducting a frisk, instead of what
he termed a full search, and had encountered what Officer
Jenk6 had encountered when he placed his hand on Robinson's
left breast pocket, namely a package that was — that gave
when it was sgueezed, had no sharp edges, didn't appear to be
of appreciable size, or of mass, what should he have done.
And Officer Donaldson, who instructs Metropolitan
Police officers in search techniques, said he should have
gone on; he shouldn't have even gone into the pocket.
Now, that's in the record of this case, and that's what *—
QUESTION:
is not your case.

May I ask this, then, Mr. Gartlan.
Take the previous case.

This

Suppose what

Mr. Robinson had in his pocket was the stiff box of
cigarettes, rather than the crumpled packaqe.

In that

circumstance, would the officer have been justified in going
into his pocket?
MR. GARTLAN:

If I may answer the question, Mr.

Justice Brennan, by coming really, I think, to what the
heart of this case is, as far as the reasonableness of search,
of this search, it's the balancing job placed upon courts,
which this Court did when it first, when it articulated the
scope limitation principles.

It, — by articulating those

38

principles, this Court did not set out a definite limit for
every kind of search.
The world of the streets of the District of Coltimbia
is not the fictional world of Ian Fleming.

Our streets are

not populated by James Bond type characters, or like Mr.
Newhouser, who customarily walk about the streets with 25
lethal weapons taped or secreted upon their person.

One can

imagine that a James Bond character would secrete in a stiff
cigarette package a potentially lethal weapon.
But X just don't think, in the light of the street
experience of police officers, that they get apprehensive
of danger to themselves, even in a close proximity custodial
situation, because they feel, what their experience and
common everyday knowledge tells them, is a cigarette package.
QUESTION: So your answer to me, then, is it wouldn't
make any difference to your case —~
MR. GARTLAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

-- if it had been a box rather than the

crumpled package?
MR. GARTLAN;

It would not.

Not because that's a

division line that this Court is going to recognise hence­
forth, but it's one that police officers do, as a practical
m atter.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gartlan, do you concede that a pat-

down always may be made in a custodial arrest?

39

MS. GARTLAN:

Yes, sir, I do.

That, was the common

ground of the plurality and the dissenters in the decision
of the United States Court of Appeals.

It is a position

not as extreme as one taken in an amicus brief in this case,
which contends that not even a Terry type frisk may be made
unless there is that apprehension of danger, which the
officer in Terry experienced.
I would agree that the necessity for protection
of the police officer in the full custody situation, whether
he's frightened or not, in the light of common experience,
is serious enough to warrant at least the Terry type frisk
as an initial search following where it will, with reasonably
aroused suspicions on the part of the police officer.
Now, the second theme to the Government argument is,
and I'm not going to dwell on this too much, in view of the
Court's questions, because I think basically we have
covered its

Counsel has referred to Metropolitan Police

Department's standing orders, and Metropolitan Police
Department's regulations, with respect to the scope of the
Eearch of a person incident to an arrest.
There simply is no standing order.

There simply is

no regulation.
What this record refers to is the practice of the
Metropolitan Police, as revealed through the testimony of
Sergeant Donaldson, as to the manner in which it instructs

40

its police officers.
And it’s true that Sergeant Donaldson did say that
in a custodial arrest situation we require a full search.
But where that particular bit of lav.; grew up, and
how it came to be escalated to the status of a standing order,
this record is totally silent.
QUESTION:

But suppose they teach all the policemen

to do that, what's the real difference, then, Mr. Gartlan,
between whether it’s a standing order or a standing practice?
MR. GARTLAN:

Because I think that if there were s

— I think this, Mr, Chief Justice:

the difference is that

when he was explored, when his testimony was explored on
cross-examination, Sergeant Donaldson came out as a much more
sanguine individual about the circumstances of an arrest than
the instructions he gave would make him to rookie policemen.
We have to keep in mind that a warrantless search —
that what this instruction contemplates is a warrantless
search, to begin with, and this Court has consistently held
that that being an exception to the Fourth Amendment
prohibition against such searches must come within a — places
upon those who would come within it the burden of meeting the
zealously drawn outlines of the exception.
QUESTION; Well, you're not questioning that a search
is permitted incidental to a lawful arrest, are you?
MR. GARTLAN:

No,

No, Mr. Chief Justice, we’re

41
not.

We are saying —
QUESTION;

some rule?

Do you regard that as an exception to

Is that the way you frame it?

MR. GARTLAN:

Yes.

As this Court has on a number

of occasions framed the search incident to arrestr has
described it as an exception to the prohibition of the Fourth
Amendment.
And I —
QUESTION:

It's a warrantless arrest, to be sure, but

it’s — no question about its standing and its being
recognized, is there?
MR. GARTLAN:

No, there is not, Mr. Chief Justice.

And what this case is all about is whether or not there should
be some limitation on the scope of that search.
QUESTION:

But Chime1 put a limitation upon the

geographic scope of such a search.
MR. GARTLAN: Exactly.
QUESTION:

Only.

scope, did it not, really?

It only dealt with the geographic
And your submission today is that

there ought to be a limitation upon the scope of the intensity
of the search within that geographic area?
MR. GARTLAN:

Exactly.

Now, I do think that I have to devote some of my
time in argument to the question of the exclusionary rule.
Because even if, in the light of the record of this case,

42
this Court should find that the search of Willie Robinson
exceeded permissible limits, there is still another hurdle
that we must overcome to assure his continued liberty.
The Government urges that this search of Mr.
Robinson was, at most, a minimal violation of his rights,
that it was neither wilful nor flagrant, and that the
exclusionary rule justified, as a deterrent to illegal
searches and seizures, is a demonstrable failure, and
considering the substantiality of this violation this evidence,
even though illegally seized, should be admitted.
I need not remind this Court of its constant — the
necessity for its constant vigilance with respect to
intrusions on personal liberties.
hs long ago as 1886 it held, in Boyd vs. United States
that illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their
first footing in that way; namely, by silent approaches
and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure.
It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the
constitutional rights of the citizens and against any
stealthy encroachments thereon.
If we are to be left to the good faith of police
officers, this Court has already dealt with that situation,
because in Terry it said: Simply good faith on the part of
the arresting officer is not enough.

If subjective good

faith alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth

43

Amendment would evaporate and the people would be secxire in
their persons, houses, papers and effects, only in the
discretion of the police.
I think that it can be fairly said that the
Government stretches a point when it says in its brief that
what Mr. Justice Powell has described in the -Schneclof case
as the most searching empirical study of the efficacy of the
exclusionary rule, when the Government suggested it, is a
failure.
Professor Oakes, the authoi* of that article, does
argue that it is a failure, but he says that, the empirical
data falls short of establishing that the rule does not
discourage illegal search.
But, deterence is by no means the only justification
for the rule.
Sixty years ago, as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out,
in Weeks, this Court took care to define the issue in these
Fourth Amendment cases in this way:

The question is the

right of a court in a criminal prosecution to retain, for
the purposes of evidence, the papers of the accused, seised
in his house, without his authority, and without a warrant
for his arrest and none for the search of his premises.
This Court then held, in that case, that if a trial
court had such a right, the protection of the Fourth
Amendment is of no value, and might as well be stricken from

44
the Constitution,
Six years later, Mr. Justice Holmes said:

If that,

were to be the case, the Fourth Amendment would be reduced to
a mere form of words.
For almost sixty years this Court has not departed
from this essential core of Weeks.

And over those decades,

it has thundered to every court in the Federal system, and
since 1961 to the States:

You have no right, courts, to

obtain, and you shall not keep and use against an accused the
ill-gotten gains of searches which violate the Fourth
Amendment.
This, the Weeks Court said, is one of those great
principles established by years of endeavor and suffering,
and it must not be given up lightly, even in a case where
constitutional liberty and the violation of constitutional
right are separated by the fabric line of a coat pocket,
This Court is urged to analogize to those cases in
which less than perfect Miranda warnings have not resulted
in the exclusion of admissions or confessions.
I respectfully submit that that analogy limps
rather badly.
The Constitution does not require Miranda warnings,
but it does require a warrant from a migistrate to permit a
search, unless the exigencies of the case demand otherwise.
The exigencies being an arrest.

45
The Fifth Amendment right is not violated, absent
Miranda warnings, until the incriminating statement is used
in the trial against the defendant, to make him a witness
against himself,

#

QUESTION: Well, Mr. Gartlan, if the Constitution
doesn't require Miranda warnings, how do you explain the
Miranda decision?
MR, GARTLAN: The Miranda decision, 1 explain, Mr.
Justice Rehnquist, as a tool to insure the voluntariness and
informed making of incriminating statements before they are
used against the defendant.
The Fifth Amendment plainly does not say that a
person has to be warned, but this Court has held that unless
informed of his rights, the incriminating statement may not
be used against him.
But the Fourth Amendment situation is a totally
different thing.

The —

QUESTION:

But the Constitution doesn't say a

warrant shall issue for every search.
It just says warrants shall not issue except on
probable cause.
MR, GARTLAN:

That's correct.

By a magistrate.

But it is all-inclusive with respect to that requirement.
But the Fourth Amendment •—
QUESTION:

It doesn't say when warrants have to

issue.
MR. GARTLAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

It doesn't say when warrants have to

issue.
MR. GARTLAN:
QUESTION:

I didn't mean to imply that, it did.

I thought you said that it did, that the

Constitution said warrants have to issue.
MR. GARTLAN: Before a search can be made, unless
the search —
QUESTION: That isn’t what the Constitution says.
MR, GARTLAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon?

That isn’t what the Constitution says.

MR. GARTLAN: The courts have carved out the
exception to the Constitution, no doubt. But the Fourth
Amendment right is violated when this literally a trespass
is committed.

And that is why the Miranda argument, I don’t

think provides an adequate guide for the Court in this case.
What we seek here, in sum, is a limit to the scope
of a protective search to what is reasonably necessary for
protection.

We ask for a rule which, as this record shows,

is reasonable and compatible with the — in the light of the
f

street experience of police officers, and can be simply
stated:

Officer, where there are no fruits, instrumentalities

or evidence of crime to be gained by a search, limit yourself
to a thorough feeling of the defendant’s outer clothing.

And

47
if you fool anything you think may be a weapon, follow the
lead of the suspicion until your suspicion lifts.

Take

away from the defendant any package, purse, or other container
thich might contain a weapon, but do not intrude upon his
person or effects any further than is necessary to protect
yourself.
QUESTION:

If the arrest had been made here, Mr.

Gartlan, explicitly for driving while under the influence
of some intoxicating substance, would all of your arguments
be the same?
your case?

What effect do you think that would have on

Let's put it that way.
MR. GARTLAN:

I think that is a crime for which

there may be corroborating evidence.

Obviously, you don't

prove a crime of driving under the influence, except by
blood tests or breath tests.

But the presence of alcohol

in a flask might well be corroborating evidence to support,
the charge,
QUESTION:

Or heroin or marijuana.

MR. GARTLAN:

That's correct.

The same?

But while I'm not an

expert in the matter, I think that the discernible odor of
— at least on the breath of an arrestee in a drunk driving
case is different, at least.
QUESTION:

But here the evidence — there was some

indication that there was no odor of liquor, and therefore the
officer was —

48

MR. GARTLAN;
QUESTION;

In this case, Your Honor?

Yes.

Did that arise, or aro I confused

obtained a new one under false pretenses.

And he stopped

him, after having ascertained that, three or four days later.
To make the arrest for specifically that charge.

There was

no improper driving, or any other indication.
And so we say to this police officer;„ Do not
intrude upon the person of the arrestee or his effects
any further than is necessary to protect yourself.
This is part of the law, that an officer —

was "Xi*-mel" by someone who said he knew "Ki-mel".
MR. TUTTLE:

Maybe individual?

[Laughter.3
MR. TUTTLE:

That case itself makes clear that a

search of the person is permissible, and there's language
to that effect also in Mr. Justice White’s dissent.
Secondly, on the comment that Mr. Donaldson was a
sanguine dindividual about searches, I would call the Court's
attention to page 101 of the Appendix, when he is asked whether
a Terry search is adequate in a Terry situation, and he says:
"My opinion would be that before I would put anyone beside

50
me in a cruiser I would like to be able to search him
completely, but we can't.”
I don't think he even feels safe in the Terry
situation, according to that record.
QUESTION: Well, in the Terry situation, you don't
put him beside you in a cruiser; that's just a breach
to the order.
MR. TUTTLE:
that, Mr. Justice.

It's commonplace in ticketing to do
When you're issuing a speeding ticket,

usually the individual sits in the cruiser next to you.
QUESTION:

Oh, I thought you meant to take him down

to jail,
MR. TUTTLE:
QUESTION:

No, I don't; no.
Oh.

MR. TUTTLE:

Yes.

And that's what he was referring to,

I assume.
QUESTION:

I see.

. MR. TUTTLE:

Now, there's also the point about the

concession that a search of a cigarette package would be
permissible in the case of an armed robbery.
I would call the Court's attention to the decision
in Schmerber and also the decision of the Court of Appeals
?

in New York in Shegalez, both of which articulate the basis
of an evidentiary search as being that which is found in
plain view during a weapons search.

51
In other words, that a weapons -— that the justifica'
tion for search at all may be a search for weapons. And I
find it strange that there is a concession that you can do
anything you want to an individual where there's seme
conceivable notion that there might be a weapon, but that
you’re terribly restricted when the idea is protecting
yourself from possible dangerous weapons.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11;49 o'clock, a.m., the case
in the above-entitled matter was submitted to
the Court.]
