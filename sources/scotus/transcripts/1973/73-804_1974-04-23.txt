MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in Ho. 73-804, Baker against Gold Seal Liquors.
Mr. Duke, I think you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. DUKE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DUKE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case presents a single, somewhat simple issue,
which, briefly stated, is whether or not a District Court
has idle power to enter a net judgment in a plenary action
brought by the trustees of a railroad in reorganisation, to
collect pre-reorganization freight charges, and in which
action the defendant has countsrclairaed for pre~reorganization
loss or damage to freight when the court supervising the
reorganization of the debtor railroad has not permitted the
setfcle-up or any other payment of such claims for loss and
damages.
The record in this case is also relatively simple
and consists almost entirely of a stipulation.
Very briefly, the Penn Central trustees, whose
property had entered reorganization in June of 1970, pursuant
to a direction in the initial order in that reorganization,
to go out and collect the property of the debtor wherever they

4
may find it, sued in the District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois to collect some $8200-some-"odd in
freight charges»
The defendant, Gold Seal Liquors, filed an answer
which was essentially a general denial, but also filed a
counterclaim for some $19,000-same-cdd in loss or damage to
shipment, all of which occurred prior to reorganisation.
Thereafter a stipulation between the trustees and
defendant Gold Seal, Gold Seal admitted its liability on
freight charges in some $6999 and some-odd cents, and the
trustees acknowledged liability on the pre-reorganization loss
and damage claims in some $18,000~some-odd.
The trustees then moved

for summary judgment.

And they asked the District Court to enter separate judgments
in the respective amounts, one on behalf of the trustees for
their 6999 and one for Gold Seal for their 18,000,
The District Court indicated that it didn't believe
it had been cited any authority which would justify the
entry of separate judgments, bat concluded that in any event
it would be inequitable to enter separate judgments, so it
entered a single net judgment.
The trustees thereafter appealed to the Seventh
Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.

It thought the

matter was presented to it as one of judicial comity, and went
on to say that the matter of the adjudication of the claims in

5
the Illinois court was a matter of law»
It said the satisfaction of the resulting judgment
is subject to the equitable principles generally applicable
in a court of bankruptcy, and then directed that the resulting
judgment be filed with the reorganisation court for proof
and allowance ,
QUESTIONi

But that was the net judgment.

MR. DUKEs

You’re right, Your Honor»

QUESTION:

Yes,

That's the

trouble.

MR. DUKE;

When once it said resulting judgment,

to say that the satisfaction of the resulting judgment is for
the reorganization court, to me begs the question, because
by affirming the net judgment they had already satisfied
seven-eighteenths of Gold Seal's claim.
I think it can best be seen, if Gold Seal had
sued the trustees for 19,000 in pre-reorganization loss and
damage claims, the trustees defended and succeeded in showing
it was only 18,000, I don’t think anyone would contend that
the Illinois District Court could take $7,000 of the
trustees’ property, which it could lay hands on in Chicago,
apply it in partial payment of that judgment, and then now
say:

as to the remainder, you have to file that in Philadelphia

and collect your $11,000»
We submit that that was the basic error.

We believe

6

that it's perfectly clear that Section 77 of the Bankruptcy
Act confers exclusive jurisdiction on the reorganisation
court for the disposition of property which comes into its
possession, and also exclusive jurisdiction over the payment
of pre-reorganization claims»
QUESTION; What do you concede to be the property of
the debtor that was here involved?
MR» DUKE;

This chose of action, Your Honor,

for freight charges, which came into their possession on
June 21st, 19 70»

Nov?, admittedly, they were not liquidated

at that time»
We say the plenary action in the Illinois District
Court liquidated those and it admitted an amount of some,
almost seven — 24 cents short of $7,000»
QUESTION; Well, do you disagree with Judge Friendly’s
treatment of this, the concept of property in Lehigh and Hudson
case, and Judge Hand's language in the Roman case?
MR. DUKE;

Well, if Your Honor please, In re Roman

was a straight bankruptcy case, inhere there is no right of
setoff, and I think Judge Friendly’s discussion in Lehigh and
Hudson River distinguished it.
But, you see, in Lehigh and Hudson River, Your Honor,
the setoff i*as accomplished prior to the entry of the order
putting Lehigh and Hudson River in reorganization.
In other words, in that case they

went ixi on April

7
— I forget — 16th of —
QUESTION?

But what they're talking about there

is the — what is the property of the bankrupt»
MR. DUKE:
QUESTIONS

That's right.
And I would think whether — when the

particular event occurred wouldn't have too much relevance
so far as that definition is concerned.
MR. DUKE:

Well, I think it would, Your Honor, to

the extent that it goes

to the issi.se of whether or not —•

if you effectuated to settle prior to the entry of an order
barring setoff, you may have raised a substantial adverse
claim to the property.

And I say that's the essential holding

of Lehigh and Hudson River.
QUESTION: But that deals with the summary juris­
diction of the bankruptcy court rather than a plenary action.
MR. DUKE:

That's right.

And in here the plenary

action sought to enforce the chose of action, i.e», the right
to collect for these freight charge which came into the
property — came into the possession of the debtor and to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the reorganization court when the
Penn Central entered reorganization.
QUESTION: Well, do you think the bankruptcy court
has the authority to tell the trustees that you can go into
any District Court in the country and sue, and I'm going to
immunize you against the normal consequences of litigation in

8

that court?
MR» DUKE;

No, I think — v/ell, the normal conse­

quences of litigation, Your Honor, I say, do not mean under 77
that the trustees have to risk their property, risk that an
Illinois District Court will order the payment of these claims
by netting out this judgment, simply because they go to collect
their property»
QUESTION;

Mr* Duke, the damage claims and the

transportation charges all arose out of different shipments,
did they not?
MR. DUKE;

That's correct, Your Honor*

QUESTION;

Would it make any difference if there

was one damage claim and one transportation charge, and it
was out of the same shipment?
MR. DUKE;
obviously,

Your Honor, that's a tougher question,
7
and Linde11, which is the original authority for,

in effect, having counterclaims for damages litigated in
freight charge actions, is not clear*

It speaks in terms of

setoff at one point, and in other terras of counterclaim*
But the law appears to be clear that a counterclaim
for loss and damage, or a claim for loss and damage, let's
not characterise what it is, is not a defense to the trustee's
action for freight charges.

It is a separate independent

claim, which, for reasons of judicial economy and efficiency,
can be litigated and prosecuted to judgment in the same action.

9
Mow, it's perfectly clear that normally, when you
have these two separate judgments, which liquidate these two
independent claims, it would be foolish not to net the
amount and enter a judgment»
We say the intervention of reorganization and the
exclusive jurisdiction which Section 77(a) vests in the
reorganization court for the payment of claims and over
property of the debtor.
QUESTION;

Well now, you've got two completely

different points there.

One of them is this, as I take it,

that if the trustee had never sued, and the other railroad
simply wanted to establish a claim for damages, would it have
had to go to the reorganization court — was this the
liquidated claim that was friable as a claim?
MR. DUKE:

Mo, it was not liquidated.

QUESTION: So it would have had to sue, just like it
did here, the trustee in an appropriate court?
MR. DUKE:

That's right, Your Honor.

QUESTION: But once it was established, the only
way that it collects its claim would be to file it, —
MR. DUKE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
~~ otherwise it would be a preference to

that creditor.
MR. DUKE:

That’s correct.

QUESTION;

And that's what underlies the rule against

10

setoffs»

But in ordinary bankruptcy, Section 68 expressly

permits setoffs»
MR, DUKE; That's correct, Your Honor»
QUESTION; But in reorganisations, as I understand
it, it's been held that 68 is not necessarily controlling,
MR, DUKE?.

And it is a matter for the expression

of the court supervising reorganization,
QUESTION; And wherever

setoff is allowed, it does

effect a preference?
MR, DUKE;

That's correct, Your Honor,

QUESTION; But the other point is, then, not only
the ■— whether — v/ell, you've answered my one question as
to whether the other court had jurisdiction to give judgment
to the claimant.

And you say it did,

MR, DUKE;

We did not contest the jurisdiction to

litigate the claim,
QUESTION; That's right. So it's really the remaining
point as to whether that claim may be satisfied out of a claim
that the trustee had?
MR. DUKE; That's right, Your Honor,
QUESTION;

I see,

MR. DUKE;

Your Honor has already indicated our

second point, which is that through the procedure followed by
the District Court here, this one loss and damage claimant
has gotten payment on his claim, as contrasted with all other

11
loss and damage claimants, including loss and damage claimants
who were brought in before Judge Fullam, shippers —QUESTIONS

It's what would concededly happen in

straight bankruptcy.
MR. DUKE:

Oh, no question about it, Your Honor.

Section 68 gives an automatic right to setoff in a straight
bankruptcy.

But in a reorganisation —

QUESTIONt Well, your policy against preference is
just as strong in straight bankruptcy as it is in reorganiza­
tion, isn't it?
MR. DUKE:

Except, Your Honor, that Congress has,

in effect, granted that preference through Section 68.
Here it’s a court of equity, where it's been held
that it's a matter of discretion for the reorganization court.
And I should make clear that the reorganization
court, in denying setoff up fill now for this type of
claimant, has not done so forever and a day.

He said:

It's

without prejudice to your claiming priority, when we get to
the proof and allowance of claims,
I would finally suggest to Your Honors that there
is another case quite similar to this one, which arose out
of the Eastern District of Michigan, where we have that
opinion as an addendum to our brief, we think it provides
excellent evidence of the proper method for handling such
problems

12

In that matter,, a suit for freight charges,
counterclaims for damages, admittedly the court could not
enter judgment on a counterclaim because it was on a motion
for summary judgment and there were questions of law and
fact raised»

But that court indicated it would enter

judgment for the trustees on their claim for freight charges,
but the exclusive jurisdiction of the reorganisation court
prevented it from satisfying any judgment that it ultimately
entered on the counterclaim for loss and damages9 out of the
property of the trustee, including the proceeds of this
judgment»
QUESTION;

Has that decision been appealed at all?

MR» DUKE;

Your Honor, as far as I know, it has not,

yet? although there have been indications that it will be»
I'd like to reserve additional time —
QUESTION;

May I ask you a question first?

MR» DUKE;

Yes, Your Honor»

QUESTION; What is the relevancy, if any, of Sections
31 and 67 of the Interstate Commerce Act?
MR» DUKE;

That established, Your Honor, the juris­

diction to bring our action»
QUESTION;

Yes»

MR. DUKE;

The relevancy of those sections, as

discussed in some of the opinions we cite, was whether or not
a shipper could have effectuated the extinguishment of the

13

trustee’s claims for freight charges, with a non-judicial
netting of freight charges against — loss and damage claims
against freight charges»
The Third Circuit, in the — what we have described
as the shipper setoff case in this reorganization, affirmed
an opinion by — a judgment by Judge Fullam that such a
netting out could not occur,
QUESTION; That’s a non-judicial netting out?
MR, DUKE;

Because the requirement of Section 67,

Your Honor, that freight charges be paid in cash and that
all shippers pay in the same form, prevented any — and the
general policy of the Act against secret rebate and secret
arrangements prevented a shipper and a railroad from agreeing
off the record, or oxitside the confines of the judicial
proceeding, that they would net out their freight charges
and loss and damage claims,
QUESTION; But this case is different because you
don't have a netting out by the party who has a claim against
the railroad?
MR, DUKE;

That’s right. Your.Honor, and it didn't

occur pre~reorganization,

What we have here is litigation

which established our right to $7,000, that’s clear; litigation
which liquidated his claims of $18,000; and then the court
took one claim, it did them separately, and said, "We'll enter
net judgment for eleven,"

14
Thank you, Your Honor»
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Herst.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. HERST, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HERST;

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it please

the Courts
I think that the basic question that runs through
the entire thread of this case is exactly how much power Judge
Fullam has, sitting in Philadelphia, by his orders to control
the disposition of litigation in Illinois, and actually by
examining the text of those orders, what he actually intended
to do.
Coming first to the most important point, the matter
of jurisdiction, there is no question that the court of
bankruptcy, under Section 77(a), has exclusive jurisdiction
of all of the debtor's property at the time of the filing
of the petition.

But we contend that this chose of action

was not such property.

We say there was no actual possession,

there was no constructive possession, there was in fact a
stabs tanti al adverse claim, because this railroad owed
this company almost two and a half times idle amount they
claimed.
And it being an adverse claim, could be subject to
disposition only by plenary jurisdiction, by a plenary suit,
which the trustees did commence

15
We state further that at this time there was no
jurisdiction, no summary jurisdiction at any time over Gold
Seal Liquors.

We were outside the jurisdiction, we didn’t

even file a claim.
The trustees recorded from the books that they had
the amount that was owed us and advised us by notice that a
claim was noted in the amount, in an approximate amount as to
what we had.
QUESTIONs Why didn't you file a claim in the
reorganization court?
MR. HERSTs

Well, we didn't file a claim in the

reorganization, Your Honor, because we saw the lawsuit
coming, and because, frankly, we were concerned as to what the
effect of participating in Philadelphia would be.
QUESTION!

Do you think it was — did they just

note the claim, or was it —
MR. HERSTs

Your Honor, what they did is they sent

a notice — if we look at the genesis of the lawsuit, the
suit was filed in the end of 1970.

Under date of February 1,

1971, to which was appended a statement of the account as of
March 6, '71, a document which was received by my client at
the end of June '71 — I got it the following day -- they
said;

This notice does not constitute an admission that the

amount set forth above or any other amount is due and owing
to by the debtor, it is merely intended to notify you that

16

the records of the debtor indicate that the attached described
claims have been heretofore been presented by you to the
debtor and to advise you that a formal proof of claim need not
be filed by you in these reorganization proceedings for these
claims.
QUESTION; So it was a — so, in effect# it was#
really wa.s an admitted liquidated amount?
MR, HERSTs

No# it was not# Your Honor.

Because

we filed -QUESTION;

Well# my question is -- my question is#

do you think that that was subject to the filing of a proof
of claim without a judgment?

That's what I asked your

colleague —
MR, HERST;

Oh, I see what you mean# Mr. Justice

White.
QUESTION;

Because I asked your colleague whether

or not this was finable as a claim in the bankruptcy court#
without further liquidation.
Now# I had always thought that if you got a notice
““ that if a creditor got. a notice like that from the trustee#
he was invited to file a claim# and that it was admitted in
that amount.
MR. HERST;
QUESTION;
liquidated

In that amount.
But, if that isn't true# then it wasn’t

17
MR» HERSTs

That is correct.

That is correct.

And the amount was also different, the amount shown
on this claim was different than the amount we originally
claimed and the amount that counsel and I subsequently
threshed out, which was embodied in the stipulation as the
actual amount,
QUESTIONS

The $18,000?

MR, HERST:

Yes, Your Honor,

QUESTIONS The original amount was higher,
MR. HERSTs
QUESTION;
MR. HERSTs

Yes, Mr, Justice Stewart,
Your original claim was higher,
— we actually claimed close to twenty

thousand,
QUESTION s
MR, HERST;

Right.
Nineteen thousand and some figure.

QUESTIONS And that that you just had in your hand
and have read to us was a notice that you -- your client got ~
MR. HERST:
QUESTION;
MR. HERSTs
QUESTION:

Yes.
“•*" from the debtor in reorganization.
Prom the trustees.
Yes, from the trustees, saying — what

did it say — we acknowledge the existence of a
MR. HERSTs

No, they say it does not constitute an

admission, but they simply state, to notify us that the
attached described claims — and actually they are statements

18

of account — have been presented by us •— have been presented
by you to the debtor, because vie had made the claims under
the provisions —
QUESTION;
MR. HERST:

You made the claims prior to reorganization,
Prior to reorganization, under the

Interstate Commerce Act
QUESTIONs Right,
MR, HERST;

— a claim on the bill of lading, ~-

QUESTION; Right,
MR. IIERSTs
QUESTION;

Mr. Justice White.
Oh, I see.

I see.

Yes.

QUESTION; But then they say you need not file a
claim.

Now, what that means to me is that they will take

account of that claim in preparation of the plan of reorganiza­
tion.
MR. HERST;

Yes.

I would suggest -—

QUESTION; Without the filing of the claim.
That’s an admitted claim that would be taken care of in the
planj that’s tine way I would -—
MR. HERST;

In that amount.

I suppose that is the

only way you could regard it.
Now, secondly, *—
QUESTION;

But it's not liquidated, I mean the

amount is not agreed upon, was it?
MR. HERSET;

No, Mr. Justice —

19

QUESTIONs

Or was not at that time.

MR. IIERSTs
QUESTIONS

~~ it was not agreed upon.
But I take it if that's all you wanted to

claim, you wouldn't need to file a claim.
MR. IIERSTs

I suppose if we would walk away, Mr.

Justice Stewart, I mean there are a lot of ifs, Mr. Justice
White — in response to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question, if we
wanted, if we assumed that this was going to be a. solvent
situation, if we assumed that we sooner or later might get
something, if we were satisfied with the approximate figure,
all other things being considered, I assume we could walk
away —
QUESTIONc

Yes.

MR. IIERSTs

Right.

-- and do nothing and, in the ordinary-

course, just watch it.
Secondly, —* well, we believe, continuing on the —
QUESTIONs

When would you take your first step?

MR. IIERSTs

Sir?

QUESTIONS When would you have to take your first
step, with respect to your claim?
QUESTIONs

You wouldn't have to — if you were

satisfied with that amount, you wouldn’t lave to take any.
MR. IIERSTs

That is correct. And in this particular

case, Mr. Chief Justice, we never even thought of taking the
first step, because we were being sued.

By the time we got

20

this notice, we were in the District Court in Illinois, we
had reached the pleading stage, we were litigating? so we
never would have gone to —■
QUESTION;

So your first step would be, after that

lawsuit was begun against you.
HR. IIERSTs Right.

Whatever the results would be

of a lawsuit would, in effect, be our claim.

And therefore,

our claim, in effect, by the lawsuit has been reduced to
$11,000.
Secondly, I just think that this is an unwarranted
extension of attempted summary jurisdiction of the reorganiza
tion court.

But I don’t think the reorganization court

intended so to do.
There are two orders which we would have before us.
The first order to examine is Order No. 1 entered by Judge
Kraft in June of 1370.
QUESTION;

Where is it, if you have it?

MR. HERST;

Your Honor, that order is found in the

Appendix, at page A22 and fallowing.
That order is what might be called a typical stock
order if there be such, because it's the usual order that has
been entered in railroad, reorganization cases.

And the

paragraphs conform to the statutory language.
The key paragraphs for this purpose would be found
at page A31, paragraphs 9 and 10.

These are found in most

21

reorganization cases, the first one to maintain the status quo
is an injunction against interfering with the property of the
debtor by garnishment, by levying, by interfering with liens.
And, in our opinion, against voluntary setoffs.
Because all of the cases urged by the trustees in
the courts below concerning this question involved voluntary
setoffs.

Actions of

self help, some in aggravated

cir corns tanees»
In the Susquehanna case, the Court noted that what
had happened was that the bank, by appropriating deposit
balances, had seized the operating cash of the railroad.
Equitable principles again.

Justice Cardozo's rule in Lowden,

whether or not 68 should apply.

Obviously, in Susquehanna,

from the facts, it shouldn't have applied, and didn’t.
QUESTION?

Lowden itself was that kind of a case,

wasn't it?
MR, HERST;
effect.

Exactly.

Lowden was a loose case, in

Three questions were asked, and Justice Cardozo said

the first two were general, and then, explaining why they
were general, he said that you would have to have a very
flexible rule,
QUESTION?

And there the bank in Minnesota had,

on its own initiative, setoff against the bonds, didn't it?
MR, HERST?

Yes, Your Honor.

And in Order 571, the second order that I would

22

allude to, entered in the summer of 1972 by Judge Fullara.
This involved shippers doing things by themselves, setting off
their own claims? or alleging the existence of prior
contractual arrangements with the debtor, which would allow
them to setoff unilaterally.
There was no instance in that case of judicial
action, and I don't think that Judge Fullam should be accused
— not that he is, but even considered to have intended that.
Because in his Order 571, which is found at page la of our
blue-covered brief, he extends his orders to "all persons,
firms and corporations served with a copy of the petition" —
and we were never served. And he prohibits them from setting
off or attempting to set off obligations.
We humbly suggest and submit that the litigation
under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, of a compulsory
counterclaim in a plenary suit is not the type of thing that
Judge Fullam was talking about in Order 571.
If we want to find out what Congress actually
intended in the legislation, I frankly have had not too much
success in looking over the reports of the Committee on the
Judicarv, chaired by Representative Somers, the Subcommittee
on Bankruptcy headed by Mr. Walter Chandler, about the time
that section 77 was amended in 1935 and subsequent.

We find

much material on the modification of security interests, the
amount of consent necessary to implement a plan, the need for

23
railroad reorganization legislation to supplant the vices of
equity receiverships»

But nothing on this one question.

But we do see one interesting thing.
of congressional intent,

One indication

We find, first, in Section 77(1),

subparagraph (1) of Section 77, the statement that the courts
in reorganization have all the powers of district courts
sitting in bankruptcy.
The creditor’s rights are the same.

The court's

powers are the same.
And, secondly, in Section 77(j) , we find the proviso
to the effect that the courts are precluded from enjoining
actions arising out of the operation of the railroads.
This proviso is reflected in the typical order.
In the single Appendix, at page A31, lines 18 through 21 of
paragraph 9, down near the bottom, the court reflects the
statutory mandate and says?

"provided that suits or claims

for damages caused by the operation of trains, et cetera,
may be prosecuted to judgment,"

Not stayed.

And the Michigan court recognized that to some
extent, although I don’t know what the value of it is, if
you allow litigation of a counterclaim and you do not give
effect to it in the usual manner. There is no indication, we
submit, in the Act of Congress, of any intent to treat a
counterclaim in this situation otherwise than as a usual
regular and typical counterclaim.

24

And we don’t think that the bar against setoff is
a bar against litigation of this sort.
Now, from a policy point of view, I suppose we are
concerned about discrimination, discriminating against various
classes of creditors.

But I think, Your Honors, that

discrimination is the route of the judicial process, because,
as jurists and as lawyers, we discriminate when we try to
separate the relevant from the irrelevant facts in every
situation.
And I think when we look at the situation in this
particular case, when we see the congressional intent in
Section 77(j), I don't think that the result is an outrageous
result,

I think that the courts below did substantial justice

in this case.
Because we were not typical creditors, we were not
customers of this railroad, profiting by our business dealings
with them, we were the patrons of this railroad.

My client,

along with many, many others, made this railroad run by
giving it business? and the more business we gave it, up to
the and, the more we were injured.
And I think, basically, that in this suit that the
courts below did the proper thing,
I checked, myself, because I was concerned, keeping
in mind the Lowden record, the records of the courts, of the
«tdtumwnm n-anmuimi

principal center in the Seventh Circuit, those in Illinois,

25
in Cook County, Illinois, and I found a total of only three
cases where there were counterclaims filed»
pleaded in detail»

None particularly

One in the State court, two in the federal

court, of which one is being removed.
There is no plethora of cases that would cause a
problem to these trustees in the administration of the
railroad.

It isn't the existence of cases like this

involving a little company that have brought the railroad
to the pass that it is right now, where it may not even be
reorganize-able.
But, I think as a matter of law that the decisions
are correct.

I think that the decisions of prior courts

sustain our position, and a reading of the orders themselves
would indicate that they were not intended to have the
effect urged by counsel.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Herst.
Do you have anything further, Mr. Duke?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R, DUKE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.
MR. DUKE:

Just one or two things, Your Honor.

And of course the number of suits is not of record. We find
it difficult to understand the check Mr. Herst made, because
there are many more than three, there are at least 20 or 25»
And in Chicago alone, counterclaims pleaded amount to about
$850,000.

That does not include other places in the Seventh

26

Circuit.
What is of record is that in the reorganization
proceeding, as a part of the stipulation, it is agreed —
or in the affidavit in support of the motion, that of the time
of that motion there were some 9600 claimants, separate
claimants, with loss and damage claims in this reorganization
who had filed loss and damge claims in an amount of approxi­
mately $29„6 million.
QUESTIONS

But have they been filed in the reorganise-

tion court?
MR. DUKEs

Your Honor, the procedure to which Mr.

Herst *— idle notice which he received was a notice prescribed
by Judge Fullam pursuant to Order 164.

This is a big reorgan­

ization, and to try to get everybody to file.
So what they did, and what Mr. Herst got, and that's
referred to in the stipulation also, was a notice saying;
Look, here’s what we’ve got on file for you.

We’ve got about

$17,900 worth of loss and damage claims; we’ve already
approved.
tion.

We've got another couple thousand under .investiga-

If you don’t agree with that, you file a proof of

claim; write in, we’ll give you the papers, you file a proof
of claim.
But unless you —
QUESTION;

Somewhat like an accountant, when he's

auditing, that you're a potential claimant, you just want to

verify, really, the amount of
MR. DUKE:

That’s right»

Justice Rehnquist, in this extent.

It was unusual, Hr.
We indicated to him that

vfe've got a couple thousand we haven't even finished
investigating yet.

We may allow those, we might not allow

them, but we'll notify you when we get finished.
Of course, when we finished and notified him, if we
had disallowed him, he would then have an opportunity.
QUESTION: But you also went on and said:

If you

don’t object to this amount, you needn't file a claim.
Which, as far as I'm concerned, meant that you would
take that amount into consideration in forming a plan.
MR. DUKE:

The amount that we had approved, --

QUESTION:

Yes.

We hadn't —- although

it begins by saying, "We don't admit these amounts, the total
amounts, but here's the way it breaks down."
QUESTION:

Yes»

You would have a very tough time in

making a plan if you didn't provide for him after having
said that.
MR. DUKE:

Oh, we have to, Your Honor.

If we ever

get to him, and if we ever get to unsecured ■—
QUESTION:
MR. DUKE:

Unsecured creditors.
— creditors, sure.

Although, as to

$7,000, the result of the entry of the net judgment is he’s

gotten paid seven-eighteenths of his claim»
QUESTION: Well, it might be worth a penny»
MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
The case is submitted»

Very well»

Thank you, gentlemen»
