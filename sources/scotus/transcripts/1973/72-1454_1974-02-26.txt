PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear

arguments next in No. 72-1^5^, Joseph Anthony Davis against
the United States.
Mr. Karpatkin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN M. KARPATKIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KARPATKIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Please the Court:
This case is here on certiorari for review of
the Ninth Circuit's denial of postconviction relief under
28 U.S.C. Section 2255 to Petitioner Joseph Anthony Davis,
who was convicted of refusal of induction into the Armed
Services.
It is conceded that he was ordered to report as
a delinquent without a prior physical examination and the
statement of acceptability as the Selective Service regula­
tions require for all persons not delinquents.
It is likewise conceded that he was declared
delinquent by his local Board because it unilaterally
determined that he did not comply with a prior order to
report for a physical examination and it is also conceded
that but for his delinquency status, he could not have been
ordered to report for induction without the prior pre­
induction physical examination and a statement of

acceptability issued at least 21 days before the induction
date.
His conviction was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit
notwithstanding an argument made on direct appeal that his
delinquency induction order was invalid under the doctrine
established by this Court in Gutknecht against the United
States.
While Petitioner's case was pending before this
Court on certiorari, a change in the law occurred.

The Ninth

Circuit decided United States against Fox, a case concededly
identical to that of Davis, holding that the Gutknecht
Doctrine required the invalidation of delinquency-based
induction orders when the order to report without a prior
physical examination and statement of acceptability was
based upon a declaration of delinquency.
Postconviction relief was sought on the basis of
this intervening Fox decision and denied by the District
Court and the Ninth Circuit.
Thus there are two principal questions, may it
please the Court, in this case.

The first is whether post­

conviction relief under 2255 is available when there has
been an intervening change in the law to the 2255 Petitioner'
benefit in a case concededly identical to Petitioner's case
on the facts and on the law, which was decided after
Appellate affirmance of Petitioner's conviction and while a

prior petition ofr certiorari was pending.
Based on, I respectfully submit, some unexplained
and inexplicable notion of law of the case which was totally
erroneous, the Ninth Circuit held per curiam that there was
no basis for 2255 relief because Petitioner's claim had been
advanced, albeit unsuccessfully, in the absence of the new
law, on direct appeal.
Indeed, the change in the law occurred four months
after the direct appeal.
The Government has apparently confessed error,
either in whole or in part, on this point but argues against
postcinviction relief for other reasons which, we respect­
fully submit, are without merit.
The second question, of course, and perhaps the
fundamental question, is whether the intervening new law
decision in United States against Fox, which invalidated a
species of delinquency sanction, which was not before this
Court in Gutknecht, the sanction of induction without a prior
preinduction physical examination and a statement of
acceptability, was a proper interpretation by the Fox court
of this Court's decision in Gutknecht and also this Court’s
decision in Oestereich.
Gutknecht and Oestereich, as wi11 be recalled, of
course, invalidated somewhat more dramatic species of
delinquency sanctions than that involved in this case.

6
And the Government admits that Davis, this case,
and Pqx are utterly identical, ifhich the Ninth Circuit, again,
astonishingly refused —
QUESTION:

What if we disagreed with the Court of

Appeals that — on the availability of 2255 and the
circumstances?

Wouldn’t we just remand to have them get to

the issue they

thought shouldn't be reassessed?

MR. KARPATKIN:

That is certainly a possible

solution, Mr. Justice White but I respectfully suggest that
since — that if Fox is the law and if Fox is correct, that a
remand would be an unnecessary waste of judicial time on the
part of the Ninth Circuit and perhaps, I even fear to think,
on the part of this Court because this case has been in the
Ninth Circuit on three occasions and these very arguments
were brought to the attention of the Ninth Circuit and when
we were previously here on certiorari, indeed, we suggested
that this Court might wish to remand to the Ninth Court with
a suggestion for reconsideration, but thus far, nothing has
availed.
QUESTION:

Has the Ninth Circuit continued to

follow Fox since the Fox decision?

Setting aside this case,

then.
MR. KARPATKIN:
the one or two Ninth Circuit

Your Honor, we cite in our brief
decisions which cite and follow

Fox and we find no others and none depart from it.

If I may

7
represent to the Court a.s a member of the Bar of the Ninth
Circuit, I have been informed by United States attorneys in
the Ninth Circuit that it is the uniform proscecutoria.1
process to act as if Fox is the law.

Indeed, a United States

attorney told me that Fox is considered the son of Gutknecht.
QUESTION:

The son of Gutknecht?

MR. KARPATKIN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Umn hmn.

And so the attorney now

would prosecute him for refusing an order to take a
physical exam?
MR. KARPATKIN:

Yes, your Honor, which, of course,

is the very gist of the constitutional defect in the
prosecution here.

The man was prosecuted for a crime of which

he could not have constitutionally committed under this
Court's decision in the Gutknecht case.
QUESTION:

I thought that maybe the Ninth Circuit

was ruling that Fox would not be retroactive.
MR. KARPATKIN:

It is hard to glean that from

the Ninth Circuit's brief opinion.
QUESTION:

It didn't say that in those specific

words, but —
MR. KARPATKIN:

The Ninth Circuit, to the extent

that it said anything in the brief opinion, which is
reprinted in the Appendix, said that they do not agree that
Fox changed the lav/ and it also made the specious, I

8
respectfully suggest, law of the case argument.

But, of

course, the day after Pox, or the same day as Fox, another
panel of the Ninth Circuit in the case of Zack against Benson,
applied Fox, obviously retroactively, since it —
QUESTION:

It is the same kind of situation?

MR. KARPATKIN:

Yes, your Honor.

In our reply

brief we cite the statement of fact from Zack against Benson,
which makes this clear and I am sure the Government won't
contest it.
QUESTION:

What have the other circuits done with

the Fox record, if anything?
MR. KARPATKIN:

Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit, in

the Batiste case, presaged Fox, presaged the Ninth Circuit
and announced the same kind of per se decision, reasoning
from this Court’s decision in Gutknecht, that even though it
might be interesting to speculate on whether or not there was
acceleration in fact, we believe that Gutknecht requires us
to hold that any delinquency-based induction order is per se
invalid.
Battiste.

That is the decision of the Fifth Circuit in
The Government views the decision somewhat

differently but I am sure your Honors can read it.
The Fourth Circuit, in Dobie, took a somewhat
different view.

The Fourth Circuit, in Dobie, stated that

where there is a delinquency-based induction order, there is
a heavy burden of proof upon the Government to show that there

9
was not acceleration in fact.
QUESTION:

In fact.

MR. KARPATKIN:

Yes and the Fourth Circuit in

Dobie, in a very careful decision by Judge Butzner, pointed
out the only proper standard which can be used to overcome
this heavy burden of proof and we submit that that is an
alternative

ground on which the decision below must be

reversed but we would hope that it would be reversed on Fox
on Battiste grounds rather than on Dobie grounds.
QUESTION:

But excpet for Fox, Battiste, Dobie,

et cetera — Battiste and Dobie in those two circuits, the
other circuits have not dealt with it?
MR. KARPATKIN:

No, your Honor, there are various

decisions of district courts but I am not aware of any other
circuits dealing with it.
Of course, the underlying question presented by
this case is the scope and the legal significance of the
constitutional holding of this Court in Gutknecht.

I believe

that it is apparent, from a reading of the Gutknecht decision,
that the essential holding is that Congress never vested the
authority to induct as delinquents in either the President
or the Selective Service System and that any such
standardless delegation would be unconstitutional.
Now, as I noted before, the case has been to
the Ninth Circuit three times and to this Court

twice and,

10

consequently, It has a somewhat elongated history which we
try to set forth and explicate in our briefs.
But the essence, the essential facts which
provided the basic legal posture of the case, is that the
local Board, in effect, accused Petitioner of failing, without
reasonable excuse, I assume, to appear at a physical
examination,that it warned him that he might be delinquent
and that in that warning, stated that he would be denied
various rights under the law and subject to induction and
shortly thereafter, it declared him a delinquent and notified
him that he had been declared a delinquent by reason of his
failure to appear at a physical examination and also by
reason of his failure to keep the Board informed of his
current address.
As we set forth in the record in the briefs,
many of these notices which Petitioner was charged with not
receiving and was being delinquent on the basis of, were not
received by him or, there is no record that they were ever
received by him.
Heedless to say, the determination that he
committed these infractions, if, indeed, he committed them,
was made unilaterally by the Board.

There was no hearing.

There was no opportunity for any presentation of witnesses.
There was- no opportunity even for the personal appearance and
appeal which is normally available under Selective Service

11

classificational process.
QUESTION:

But whatever the cause, he managed for

more than two years to avoid taking a physical.
MR. KARPATKIN:

We don’t know, Mr. Justice Powell,

the facts and the records shox^s that.
QUESTION:

The fact was, he did, although

ordered to do so.
QUESTION:

Although ordered to do so and although

the notices were sent to the address given by him.

I don't

know that this is relevant, but I was just interested in your
statement.
MR. KARPATKIN:

Mr. Justice Powell, it is also a

crime to violate the Selective Service regulation that
requires one to keep the Selective Service Board informed of
current address and, indeed, there are many prosecutions for
that offense, just as there are many prosecutions for
failure to appear at a physical.

But

Petitioner was not

prosecuted for either of these offenses.

Rather, he was

ordered to report for induction and prosecuted for induction
refusal.
I submit that if this Court said in Gutknecht
that Congress never gave the President or never authorized him
to give to the Selective Service any power to set up a
delinquency scheme for priority induction, then, regardless
of what might be the underlying factual situations of other

12

infractions, that the Board never had authority to send him
an induction order.
QUESTION:

I understand your legal position.

I

was just curious that you were trying to elicit our
sympathy for a fellow who managed for more than two years to
avoid the draft.
MR. KARPATKIN:

The only thing I can say in

response to that, Mr. Justice Powell, is that since there was
never any hearing, since there was never any due process
determination, indeed, there was never even any quasi-due
process determination, I don't think it is really fair to
speculate that he avoided the draft or that he had good and
bona fide reasons for not responding to those notices.
Because no finding was ever made.
QUESTION:

Well, what vjould be a good, bona fide

I’m afraid we are off on a wild goose chase, but what would
be a good and bona fide reason for not responding to a
direction to take a physical exam?
MR. KARPATKIN:
QUESTION:

Well, I presume —

In fact or in lav;.

MR. KARPATKIN:

I presume illness.

I presume

unavailability because of some other legal commitment,
impossibility of performance.
QUESTION:

For two years?

MR. KARPATKIN:

Or I presume that Boards often —

13

Boards often postpone physicals upon the request of the
registrant.
QUESTION:

But this Board didn’t.

QUESTION:

It didn't get any request.

MR. KARPATKIN:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry?

It didn't get any request from the

registrant.
MR. KARPATKIN:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor.

It just got a — his absence.

MR. KARPATKIN:

I submit that this is not the

brunt of our argument.
QUESTION:

No, I know it isn't.

QUESTION:

We are wasting his time.

This

question has nothing to do with the Issue.
QUESTION:

No, I know it doesn’t.

QUESTION:

It is tough enough, the one we have to

face, to have to —
QUESTION:

probably
Well,/you are accustomed to answer

questions that are put to you by the Court, aren't you?
MR. KARPATKIN:

I try to as best I can, your

Honor.
In

any event, on appeal of Petitioner's

conviction, the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded to
consider in the light of Gutknecht.

This was Davis I.

remand, the District Court gave the same narrow

On

14
interpretation to Gutknecht which the Government now
advances and which has since been disapproved by the Ninth
Circuit in Pox.
On the remand hearing, the Court held that
Petitioner's induction had not been accelerated in fact,
based largely on the opinion testimony of the local board
clerk to the effect that Petitioner would have been ordered
to report in any event on or prior to the date of his order
to report as a delinquent.
The Ninth Circuit affirmed per curiam, holding
that there was no acceleration within the meaning of
Gutknecht.

Certiorari was sought based on the tripartite

circuit conflict and denied by this Court, after the Court
had been informed of the intervening Fox decision.
A petition for rehearing out of time, accompanied
by a full brief on the merits, was presented to the Ninth
Circuit but denied without opinion and, consequently, this
22:55 proceeding was started and denied by the district judge
without opinion and by the Ninth Circuit in Davis III.
I respectfully submit that a change in the law
occurred, although disputed by the Davis III panel, as
conceded by the Government and is self-evident and the
apparent basis for the denial of relief by the court below
on some notion of law of the case is likewise, concededly
erroneous.

15
Indeed, the Government does not deny that change
In the law is a proper subject for Section 2255.

What the

Government attempts to do is to minimize the statements by
this Court in Sanders and Kaufman that an intervening change
in the laxv is appropriate —• is an appropriate subject for
postconviction relief and then the Government asks some
rhetorical questions and engages in some

handwringing as to

the dire effects of recognizing the change in the lav; based
on nonbinding decisions from other circuits.

But that,

indeed, is a red herring because there is no such issue before
this Court.
Petitioner seeks only the benefit of the law of
the circuit which has jurisdiction over the court which has
convicted him.
QUESTION:

Is there some difference of opinion

between you and your brother as to whether Gutknecht was a
constitutional decision?

That is, a decision based upon a

constitutional violation.
MR. KARPATKIN:
QUESTION:

There is a considerable difference.

I thought so.

MR. KARPATKIN:

And precisely the point that I

am about to address, Mr. Justice Stewart.
QUESTION:

Okay, fine.

MR. KARPATKIN:

It is our view — and this,

perhaps, is the fundamental question in this case, though it

16

Is very hard to find what is the fundamental question, that
the Government’s argument that Section 2255

relief is only

available if there is a denial of a fundamental constitutional
right and there was no such denial here} totally mischaracterizes and minimizes the holdings in Gutknecht and Fox.

In

fact, in our view, Gutknecht is a constitutional decision
of the first magnitude because it holds that Selective
Service Boards are without power to promulgate and enforce
delinquency regulations.
The decision in Gutknecht —
QUESTION:
statute to do so.

Because they were not authorized by the

Is that it?

MR. KARPATKIN:

Basically?

Because they are not authorized —

neither the President nor the Selective Service System were
authorized

by Congress to do so.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. KARPATKIN:

That was the basic holding.

Yes, your Honor.

And if that is

so, it seems to me it is incredibly myopic or worse for the
Government to say that since there was not a specific pro­
vision of the Bill of Rights which the Court pointed its
finger at in Gutknecht that it can't be considered a
constitutional holding.
QUESTION:

What if it wasn't?

a constitutional holding?
MR. KARPATKIN:

What if it wasn't

Does it make any difference?
There are members of this Court

your Honor —
QUESTION:

What is your position?

MR. KARPATKIN:

i

QUESTION:

What is your position?

MR. KARPATKIN:

My position is that it does not

My position is that even —

QUESTION:

You hold that position, too.

You have

two positions, if you are wise.
MR. KARPATKIN:

Yes, your Honor.

The first

position is that Gutknecht is a constitutional holding and I
advance that as the major position but even if Gutknecht is
seen as a nonconstitutional holding, we have, of course,
first, 2255 the statute itself, which has constitutional laws
and we have the absence of any decision by this Court which
states other than indicta that 2255 is only available in a
constitutional case and then, I respectfully suggest, we have
a perhaps commonsense argument, if I may advance it.
There are certain types of rights which it seems
to me that, even though they have not been ensconced with a
constitutional category by this Court, are so fundamental
that their denial would have to be the basis for 2255 relief
and, take for example, If someone is denied the right to an
appeal.
Now, this Court has said on many occasions that
it is not clear whether there is a constitutional right to

18
an appeal but, of course, there is a statutory right to an
appeal and, surely, someone who from mischance is denied a
right to an appeal and if some prisoner sent in a writ three
years after he had been denied a right to an appeal based on
2255s I doubt if he could be properly denied a hearing on
whether he was improperly denied his right to an appeal
which is nonconstitutional.
If I may just pursue the constitutional point
one minute more.

The Government says that there is no

reference to any provision of the Constitution in the
Gutknecht case but Gutknecht relies on Kent against Dulles
and Kent against Dulles, in turn, cites the famous
Youngstovrn against Sirrer case and also, perhaps even more
famous and somewhat older, Panama, Refining case and both of
these cases obviously stand for the proposition that where
there is an absence of law, where there is an absence of
authority, then it is beyond constitutional power and if
one needs to put one’s finger on a constitutional clause, I
respectfully suggest to my learned brother that the
constitutional clause is Article I, Section I.
QUESTION:

I thought Panama Refining turned on

delegation and absense of standards.

Is it a constitutional

holding?
MR. KARPATKIN:
Article

Mr, Chief Justice Hughes cites

I, Section I and we have extracted what we believe is

19

a fair summary and quotation .from that opinion in our reply
brief which we have just recently filed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
But I think to argue that Gutknecht is not a constitutional
holding is to argue that Panama Refining and Youngstown are
not constitutional holdings and I submit such an argument is
absurd.
If there is any more fundamental argument than a
violation of the Constitution because of the violation of
the constitutional provision, it is acting in the absence of
constitutional authority.
Now, of course, there are also Fifth Amendment
procedural due process questions which the Government at
various points in its brief seems to partially concede.
Now, the fact that Gutknecht and Fox must be
retroactively applied, I respectfully submit, is another
reason why Section 2255 relief is appropriate here.
Of course, the retroactivity argument which the
Government vigorously argues against our position, assumes
that Fox is correct, otherwise he wouldn't be here talking
about retroactivity.

Indeed, we wouldn’t even be here

talking about 2255.
Now, of course, first. Fox has already been held
retroactive by the very circuit which decided it.
Second, Gutknecht has been retroactively
applied universally and we cite all the cases on page 46 of

20

our brief.

I would particularly and respectfully invite the

Court’s attention to the very careful analysis of retro­
activity of Gutkneeht by Chief Judge Zavatt in United States
against Kelly.
Moreover, there is no need, there is no
occasion to engage in the pragmatic Linklett -Stovall-type
analysis which the Government urges upon us because this is
not a case which seeks to determine the retroactivity of
procedural rules which govern the conduct of a trial.
Like Robinson against Neil, as Mr. Justice
Rehnquist points out in the opinion for the Court, this case
is similar to a valid claim of double jeopardy because if
Fox is correct, then there will not be any fact-finding
burden and there vd.ll not be any further trial.

There will

be no question of the integrity of the fact-finding process
because the fact-finding process is at an end.
Finally, the ends of justice will be served by
granting posteonviction relief and we are

reminded in

Kaufman and in Sanders and in other decisions that that must
always be borne in mind.
I first may say that the problems which have
been raised by Justices of this Coixrt and by distinguished
scholars, some of which I refer to in Mr. Justice Powell's
concurring opinion in Schneckloth against Bustamonte, are
not, simply not available in this case.

21

There is no problem here of any deliberate bypass
of other available remedies.
Petitioner has been knocking at every conceivable
judicial gate looking for a remedy these past years.
Furthermore, there is obviously no delicate
question of federal-state relations and, as I stated before
and as I think should be stressed, there is no question here
of a guilty person going free because of some exclusionary
rule or some similar prophylactic device.
If Fox is correct — and Mr. Justice Powell, if
I may again respond to your prior question, the Ninth Circuit,
in Fox, indicated that they weren't very happy about his
Selective Service history, either.

But if Fox is correct,

then the induction order is invalid and the indictment just
must be dismissed because the crime of induction refusal has
just not been committed.
Now, the Government, at one point, notes the
various scholarly criticism of 2255 but then at another
point states that even if Fox is right and even if this is a
meritorious claim, there nevertheless should not be 2255
relief because of the Government's own conception of how
narrow it should be.
The Government, therefore, is making its own
unique —
QUESTION:

Which is what the Court of Appeals

22

for the Ninth Circuit said, I take it?
MR. KARPATKIN:

May if please the Court, I just

don’t know what the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit -—
QUESTION:

At least it wasn’t available because

of some Idea of law of the case?
MR. KARPATKIN:

Yes, your Honor, yes, and I

don't believe that the Government is seriously —
QUESTION:

I doubt if they'd espouse that idea.

MR. KARPATKIN:

I don’t think so but there is,

as we note in our reply brief, they sneak it in somewhere
towards the end of their brief as a partial reason.
But I think that the Government is making its
own unique contribution to this
2255.

debate on the

scope of

While many justices and scholars are arguing that it

should be construed so as not to help the guilty, the
Government now argues that it should also be construed so as
not to help the innocent and that, I think, is the import of
the Government saying that 2255 should be narrowed even
beyond that suggested in the various critical literature
which I have referred to.
With the Court’s permission. I’ll save the rest
of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND V/. KITCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KITCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Government in this case has three independently
sufficient reasons that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit
below should be affirmed.
It Is a rhetorical difficulty with our posture
that in order to argue any one point we must, for purposes
of argument, concede the validity of Petitioner's position on
the other two points and then my brother has been, able to
find that, cumulatively, we concede our entire ease.
Our three points are that the subject matter of
the
the claim is not cognisable in/Section 2255 proceeding
brought after the judgment of conviction has become final, that,
in any event, the conviction of the District Court was proper
and that if it was not proper and the rule of United States
against Fox is correct, that rule should not be applied
retroactively.
In our brief, we argue the merits of the
conviction:

First, for purposes of exposition.

However,

24
logically, this Court must reach the jurisdictional issue
under 2255 before it would reach the merits and therefore,
the
I will address/2255 question first.
This is a question of considerable importance
on which even a casual reading of the many court of appeals
opinions dealing with 2255 reveal a need for this Court’s
attention.
For instance, Zack against Benson in the Ninth
Circuit on which Petitioner relies, is a holding on all
points in accord with his position.

In that case the Ninth

Circuit was not aware that there was a 2255 issue to be
addressed before relief should be automatically granted.
I have discussed our position in this case with
a number of members of the Bar of some experience who,
although finding our position persuasive, have expressed
some surprise in saying that although they hadn’t really
thought about it, they always understood that the federal
system was a double trial, double appeal system.
You went in first, your conviction and appeal
and then you had a second bite at the apple.
Now, as I think we have argued in our brief and
on the basis of the authorities in our brief, it is clear
the 2255 plays a very narrow role in the administration of
criminal justice.
The reasons, the policy reasons for this narrow

25
scope of collateral attack after a criminal judgment becomes
final are3 I think, important ones and bear repition here.
First of all, is the importance of finality
through the function of the criminal law itself, the functions
of rehabilitation and deterrence.

If criminal law cannot

rehabilitate, if the convicted defender is constantly faced
with the uncertainty about whether his conviction is really
valid, whether if he just didn't raise one more claim he
would, in fact, discover that he had been wrongly and
unjustly convicted.
QUESTION:

Also, if —
Now, I take it you are talking about

the availability of 2255, no matter what the issue is, if it
is once it has been decided on appeal.
MR. KITCH:

These are general policy reasons

why 2255 is narrowly available.
QUESTION:

Well, we'd have to retreat from some

cases to agree with you, wouldn't we?
MR. KITCH.

No, sir.

I think our opinion, our

position in this case is sustainable under all of the views
of habeas corpus which have been advanced in the opinions of
this Court, your opinion in Fay against Noia or the
dissenting opinion in Schneckloth
Your opinion in Pay against Noia assumes that in
habeas corpus we are talking about allegations of denial cf
fundamental constitutional rights which go to the very heart

26
of the process of justice itself and that is not the kind of
issue and claim which Petitioner makes in this case.
QUESTION:

So you do make — I asked you a

question whether you would distinguish between various
issues and you now say you would.
MR. KITCH:

Oh, I misunderstood.

We certainly ----

there are different kinds of issues which have historically
and under the opinions of this Court been treated differently
under 2255.
QUESTION:

And you would treat 2255 and habeas

corpus together for this purpose?
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And write out the words or weed out

the words "laws of the United States."
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:

No, your Honor.
You wouldn’t ?
The section —
What ones do you save?
The section reads, "A prisoner in

custody under sentence of a court claiming the right to be
released upon upon the ground that the sentence was imposed
In violation of the Constitution or la.ws of the United States."
QUESTION:

And the habeas statute has comparable

words, doesn’t it?
MR. KITCH:

The habeas statute has comparable --

QUESTION:

Except it says, "Detained, by a state

in violation of the law."
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:

That is correct.
Yes.
And not a sentence of a court which is

imposed after error In the trial.
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:

You distinguish that from —
Yes.

QUESTION: — "Detention in violation of the"
constitutional laws and the habeas statute?
MR. KITCH:
not illegal.

No, no, no.

The sentence itself Is

This is collateral attack.

It goes to the

legality of the sentence and the modern habeas corpus
practice, which this Court has developed, has said that
certain errors are of such a fundamental nature that they
affect the very legality of the sentence itself.

But not

every error is an error which affects the legality of a
sentence.
This Court's own policy on finality, on — in
criminal judgments is set out in the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure adopted by this Court.
Rule 33 is the —
QUESTION:
Court."

You don't mean "adopted by this

You mean sent to the Congress by this Court.
MR. KITCH:

Sent to the Congress by this Court

23

after this Court approved them.
QUESTION:

Rule 33 provides —

It just transmitted them.

It couldn’t

approve them.
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:

Well —
That is a continuing debate, Counsel,

which you probably can't solve here.
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:

That’s a House debate.
The Congress has acceded in the rules

as transmitted by the

Court.

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. KITCH: And the rules provide, in Rule 33 in
the motion for new trial which is the great traditional
method for correction of errors after judgment in the trial
court, that errors — and allegations of the discovery of
new evidence

when relief was sought under Rule 33 — relief

should be sought within two years and as to all other errors,
relief should be sought within seven days.
Now, I think that the policy reflected Rule 33,
which is subject to — can be revised
emphasizes the values of finality.

— is a policy which

And 2255 is not a

substitute for or an alternative version of Rule 33»
It Is a statute which makes available to the
sentencing court a remedy in the great tradition of habeas
corpus for errors of a fundamental constitutional nature
affecting the legality of the sentence, not just all errors

of lav; which the court may or may not have made in the course
of its trial.
And "or law" in 23 U.S.C. 2255 does not mean that
all errors of lav; are cognizable in

a 2255 proceedings and

this Court has always described the section and writ of habeas
corpus in precisely those terms.
Some of the other policy reasons for the narrow
scope, the collateral attack to criminal judgments are
spelled out in Mr. Justice Powell’s dissent in Schneckloth
and I will not deal with them further.
QUESTION:

I didn’t think Mr. Justice Powell

dissented in Schneckloth.
MR. KITCH:

You are quite right, his concurring,

special concurring opinion, one concurred in by only three
justices of the Court.

You are quite right.

Another factor, I think, that finality serves
is the important factor of insuring that the effort in
trying criminal cases is concentrated in the first trials
and that there is not a general feeling of an always available,
another remedy that we will try defense line I at this trial
and defense line II —
QUESTION:

Well, your proposition is that habeas

corpus and 2255 are fundamentally the same for this purpose.
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
A state criminal trial, constitutional

30

issue presented to state court, denied conviction, conviction
sustained and constitutional question decided adversely in
the State Supreme Court; petition for certiorari here, denied.
Constitutional question raised in habeas corpus, dismissed for
lack of jurisdiction.
MR. KITCH:

No.

Because it has been litigated

before?
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:

Yes.
In the state courts?
Yes.
No, we do not rely upon the aspect of

prior litigation of the issue.
QUESTION:

If, in this case —

Well, do you think the Court of

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit did?
MR. KITCH:

Their opinion is enigmatic and brief.

They appear to, to some extent.
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:

You disown that, then?
We do riot rely upon that theory and

the reason is that we feel that here there has been a
vigorous and effective effort to pursue all remedies and that
the fact that remedies were pursued in direct appeal should
not result in their denial in collateral attack if they are
available, that this Petitioner should not be in a worse
position than a petitioner who had not appealed.

In fact,

he should be in a better position because he has responsibly

31
pursued his remedies and he is quite correct when he says he
is in that position.

Vie don't think he should be penalized

for failing to responsibly pursue his remedies.
Now, there is a separate issue, related issue in
the habeas corpus tradition about when the failure to pursue
remedies available on direct appeal results In a denial of
the right to the writ and, of course, in Sunal against Large,
in the opinion by Mr, Justice Douglas, the Court said that
the failure to appeal there resulted in denial of the
availability of the writ.
That issue is not before us and the extent to
which that hy-pass of remedies has to be conscious, knowing
or real the level of waiver is a separate issue.
There may be cases where the failure to pursue
a remedy will, of itself, deny habeas corpus relief,
collateral attack relief without regard to the nature of the
issue.

But where the relief has been pursued on direct

appeal, I don't think we can responsibly say that Petitioner
has somehow lost his collateral remedies.
Now, the history of habeas corpus has been
and
canvassed in the opinions of this Court/in the literature
and its limited scope has always been emphasized, and we
rely upon those precedents in that history and there is not,
as far as we are aware, precedent of this Court where habeas
corpus has issued for non — for a claim which did not relate

32
to the denial of a nonconstitutional right.
I’d like to turn now and discuss the — argue the
question as to whether the conviction was proper and
Petitioner’s argument on the merits.
In our view, the Gutknecht decision is simply not
in point as far as this case is concerned.

As we read

Gutknecht, it held that the delinquency regulations were not could not be used by the Selective Service Sytem to punish
registrants for failure to comply with the violations of the
regulations, that the punitive scheme of the statute Is a
criminal scheme and that the enforcement through the
criminal lav; Is the exclusive means for extracting compliance
with the regulations promulgated by the Selective Service.
And in the Gutknecht case, of course, the record
clearly shows an application of just such a punitive use of
a delinquency regulation.

As soon as the petitioner in

Gutknecht had *— the defendant in Gutknecht had sent his
draft card In to the draft board, he was declared delinquent
and immediately ordered to report for induction.
Nov;, the .record here is quite different.

The

record here shows that between the initial notice to report
for a physical examination and the final second order of
induction, there was the long and patient effort by this
draft board to locate and to obtain from the registrant
fundamental substantial compliance with his obligations

33
under Selective Service System.
When lie failed to appear for his first physical
examination, he wrote to the Board and explained that he had
been ill.

The Board responded simply by ordering him for

another physical examination.
Just as he was about to be declared a
delinquent after having failed to appear twice, he appeared
again and gave a. new address and the Board then did not have
him prosecuted for failing to appear for a physical, the
Board merely sent him an order to that address to appear
for induction.
Due to this patience, and the record is
ambiguous as to whether this was a young man who was
confused about his obligations or a young man who was
attempting to evade his obligations and that, I think,
accounts for the patience of the Board, by the time the
induction order came about, he was behind others in the same
age category who had complied with their obligations under
the statute and had been ordered for induction and were
inducted.
So he benefited from the difficulties he had with
the Selective Service System, whatever the reasons that they
occurred.
Now, the delinquency regulations, as they remain
after Gutknecht, continue to serve other purposes than those
held bad In Gutknecht.

34
They enable the Selective Service System simply to
keep track of the compliance status registrant.

They enable

the Service to notify registrants of compliance difficulties
and they reflect, I think, together with the amendment to the
regulation in 1970 to simply provide for induction orders
without medical examination, a policy of minimal
criminalization.

That is, if young men can be induced to

report for induction, even though they did not report for a
medical examination, there is not an effort to escalate the
sanction and to make everyone who does not appear for a
medical examination an immediate subject of a prosecution
under the criminal statute.
In the face of this argument, the position of the
Petitioner is that since, under the regulations, you had to
be declared delinquent to be inducted without a medical
examination, he lost

his right to a preinduction medical

examination, that this right conferred by the regulation was
of such a

substance that it required that he xxot be

convicted and that it be available in collateral attack.
In his reply brief to our opposition petition for
certiorari. Petitioner suggested his real theory was there
was a statutory right relying upon the Castillo opinion to a
preinduction physical.

That argument he has now abandoned.

If there is any technical error in the processing
of this induction order as a result of the complexities that

35
fall out of Gutknecht and the time that this induction order
was issued before the Selective Service opinion system had
the advantage of the Gutknecht opinion, we argue that error is
entirely technical.

It is harmless error and would not be

available in any case at the original trial as a defense and,
therefore, also, the conviction is proper.
Now, as to retroactivity —QUESTION:
or it can be.

It is, Mr. Kitch, a criminal offense,

It is a criminal offense to wilfully fail to

report for a physical examination.
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
And is that an offense of the same

gravity in terms of the permissable punishment and the
offense of failing to report for induction?
MR. KITCH:

Yes, It is ray understanding that it

is ail under the same section of the statute, 462
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:

That is what I thought.
— which provides for, generally,

penalty for violation of Selective Service regulations.
QUESTION:

So if Fox remains the lav/, the

Government could simply bring the charge of failing to
report for the physical examination, couldn't it?
MR. KITCH:

Well, I think that we could do that

or we could — we really have no problem after the
amendment of the regulations in 1970 vrhich eliminated the

36
category of delinquency as the basis for issuing an induction
order without a preinduction physical.
If men do not appear for their physical, the
system can move ahead without the physical and the induction
order can be issued in normal course without any declaration
of delinquency and at that point, the issue is drawn.
QUESTION:

But wouldn’t it, with or without a

declaration of delinquency, would it be procedurally proper
to order a man for induction who hadn't been given a physical
examination under the present set-up?
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:

Yes.
It would.

MR. KITCH:

Yes.

QUESTION:

It is.

MR. KITCH:

Yes.

QUESTION:

The regulations were so drawn.

Whether or not he disregarded a

direction to show up for a physical?
MR. KITCH:

The amended regulation is reprinted

in our brief at page 7.
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:

Seven?
"Notwithstanding any other provision,

when a registrant classified I-A —” and so on — "has
refused or otherwise failed to comply with an order to report
for and submit to an Armed Forces physical exam, he may be
selected in order to report for induction even though he has

37
not been found acceptable.”
In other words, the regulation basically requires
the examination, the statement of acceptability and then it
provides an exception for persons who fail to report to the
Board.
QUESTION:

Who have refused.

My question is,

can —MR. KITCH:

[Overriding]

declaration of delinquency.

But it is not a formal

It doesn't go through the

delinquency regulations.
QUESTION:
isn't it?

But It is basically the same provision,

in substance?
MR. KITCH:

Yes, precisely.

QUESTION:

But for a person who hasn't refused,

it violates the procedures of the Selective Service Act to
call a person for induction who has not been even asked to
have a physical examination.
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION;

Is that correct?

That is correct, yes.

Yes.

And that continues to be true?
That continues to be true.
As it was true at the time of —
Yes.
Mr. Davis’ induction and it continues

to be true as it was at the time of his induction that
person refuses a physical examination, he can then,

if a

38
nevertheless, be called for Induction.

The only difference

now is, you don’t label it as delinquency.
MR. KITCH:

Right, and therefore, we don’t have

the argument that relying

the argument can’t be made that

relying upon delinquency regulations under Gutknecht as a
precondition for issuance of the order.

And this should be

emphasized.
QUESTION:

That continues to be true, therefore,

now, as it was then that the Government can prosecute him for
refusal to report for a physical examination.
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:

That is also true.
And that carries the same penalty, you

just told me, as a refusal to report for induction.
MR. KITCH:

Right, although I think you can tell

from many of the cases that, often, the induction ojr’der is
Issued and then if the induction takes place, that is the
end of it.

If there Isn’t induction, then sometimes the

induction charge is joined with the physical charge.
Here, there was a two-year gap between the
physical and the induction which may have been a factor in
the failure to join the physical — the failure to appear
for the physical In the charge.
QUESTION:
MR, KITCH:

Mr. Kitoh —
But I think it is important to

emphasize that under the preamended procedures, the

39
pre-Gutknecht procedure and the procedure now, the physical
is still given before induction occurs.

It is given at the

induction station and if — if the young man is found not
acceptable by the military, he is not inducted.

He still

has the right, if you will, he is still able to demonstrate
his unsuitability for the Armed Porces and avoid the effect
of the induction order.
QUESTION:

It is just —•
And then :ls he — he cannot be

prosecuted, I suppose, if he is found physically disabled —
disabled, he cannot then be prosecuted even though he has
absolutely defied a previous order to report for a physical.
Is that correct?
MR. KITCH:

Well, no, he could be prosecuted for

that, within the statute of limitations, but I believe it is
our policy not to prosecute for that offense alone where he
has appeared for induction and been found unfit.
QUESTION:

Pound unfit and doesnJt pass his

physical.
MR. KITCH:

That is right.

I think one has to

understand this is difficult business of the administration
of the Selective Service System involving young men, many
of whom are confused about their obligations and rights and
if the induction order, instead of proceeding from the
failure to appear for the physical right to criminal
prosecution but proceeding through the induction order, the
induction order, which has a little more gravity to it, it

may make many of these young men realize that they actually
should appear and have to appear and may keep out of the
criminal justice system any young men of good intent who are
confused and I think that is the policy;, the benevolent
policy that is reflected in the records in this case and
underlines the thrust and so it is just a very different
matter than the Court -was dealing with in Gutknecht.
Sir, you had a question?
QUESTION:

I think you answered the question I

had in mind, that Mr. Davis would have had a physical
examination in any event, he would have had that examination
before he could have been inducted in any event.
Is that correct?
MR. KITCH:
QUESTION:
MR, KITCH:

That is correct.
The district judge so found.
Yes, he did and that is provided for

under the Armed Porces regulations.
On retroactivity, again, the Court in Zaclc against
Benson on which Petitioner relies, seems to have held the
rule retroactive but without stating that it is an issue
present in the case and I don't think the Petitioner urges
that we are now foreclosed from having review of the retroactivity of the Ninth Circuit rule once this case is here
but we do feel the issue is the retroactivity of Fox and not
the retroactivity of Gutknecht.

iJl
Of course, if, as Petitioner contends, the rules
are precisely the same, that there is just no meaningful
distinction between the cases, then this point has no
separate merit, but we think the rules are quite
distinguishable and we think that the analysis of retro­
activity requires that the Court look at the possible purposes
for the Fox rule, an issue on which the opinion of the Ninth
Circuit is not a very expansive.

But as far as we really

make out, the rule does have the effect of just saving the
courts from the kind of collateral factual inquiry that was
made here on remand and examination of the delivery lists
and that kind of inquiry a court might well

feel is not

really essential to the system since induction can be
accomplished through amendment of the regulations without

delinquency declaration and

in that purpose, it seems to me

it is achieved by perspective application and the fact that
the courts are called upon to examine for acceleration in
facts in those few cases where induction orders occurred
before the Gutknecht opinion is not such a burden on the
courts as to require retroactive application of the Fox
rule.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have about six

minutes left, Mr. Karpatkin.
MR. KARPATKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

42
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN M. KARPATKIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KARPATKIN:

It may come as a surprise to the

Government, but we believe that this issue, at least in one
sense, has been before this Court before and that was when
this Court had before it a petition for

certiorari in the

case of the United States against Peet from the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

Peet?

MR. KARPATKIN:

Peet, P-E-E-T, Mr. Justice,

cited in our brief on page 43.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. KARPATKIN:

That, in Peet, on the basis of

Gutknecht, the conviction was vacated and remanded for
resentencing since there was a two-count conviction in that
case and Peet had been declared delinquent for non-appearance
at his physical examination.

Of course, there was no written

opinion but a vacation of a judgment of a court of appeals,
I always understood, is action on the merits.
Now, it is our basic contention that there are
three species of delinquency sanctions which were created in
the delinquency regulations and that each and all of them are
equally invalid because equally without a congressional
authorization.
Congress did not authorize delinquency induction
without a physical examination and without a statement of

43
acceptability any more than it authorized punitive
reclassification as in the ease of Qestereich or accelerated
induction, as in the case of Gutknech.
The offense to the basic constitutional right
that is involved is not so much the facts of any particular
case or the nature of the sanction but the offense is the
existence of this delinquency power because it implies an
extrapenal sanction, the sanction of induction, under extra­
ordinary conditions for asserted wrongdoings.
Now, perhaps. Congress has this power under the
Constitution.

The Solicitor General speculates, at Note 17

of his brief, as to whether Congress might have the power to
induct draft card burners but the fact is, that Congress has
not sought to exercise that power, to either give it to
the President

or to the Selective Service System, and I

submit that in the words of Oestereich and Gutknecht that
what we have here is sheer administrative lawlessness,
blatantly lawless conduct on the part of the executive
authority creating tils power and bestowing it by executive
order to the administrative agencies.
Now, insofar as prejudice is concerned,
Petitioner Davis was prejudiced because he was inducted
without this congressional authorization.

His prejudice was

as great as someone who was prejudiced by being tried and
convicted before a judge without jurisdiction or, perhaps

44
more to the point, for an act, however it might be considered
reprehensible, which had not been declared a crime.
It seems to me that the effect of Gutknecht is,
as in United States against United States Coin and Currency,
is to declare that persons who have failed to report for
induction following a declaration of delinquency are
constitutionally immune from punishment and that any acts
which they may have committed may be susceptible to other
kinds of criminal enforcement, but not susceptible to this
kind of criminal enforcement because it has never been
authorized by the only body under Article I, Section I which
has the power to authorize punishment ot Congress.
Consequently, I don't think that there is any
point to getting into a discussion as to whether Davis and
others criminally situated are prejudiced by not having the
21-day statement of acceptability in time to seek to obtain
review, by not having two physical examinations rather than
one and by not having all of the rights to seek additional
deferments and exemptions which, as this Court knows from
the Elder case, are automatically cut off upon the issuance
of an induction order.
Now, some reference has been made to new section Section 1631.7 in the colloquy between Mr. Justice Stewart
and the Solicitor General.
We respectfully submit that the new section 1631.7

45
which, presumably, allows induction upon a finding of
refusal without the use of the badge word "delinquency" does
not cure the problem and liras not the basis of the Ninth
Circuit decision in Fox.
We would respectfully refer to the Court the
opinion of Chief Judge Consio in United States against
Castillo in the District of Puerto Rico, which liras cited in
our brief but I do not believe the decision has yet been
reported.

And Judge Consio points out that a rose is a rose

is a rose and that a local board making a unilateral due
processless determination that someone refused to attend a
physical, without using the word "delinquency," is just as
much offending the Gutknecht principle as the local board
that does it with the utilization of the badge word,
"delinquency."
Insofar as concerns Zack against Benson, I don't
know whether the Ninth Circuit was aware or was not aware of
what the Solicitor General thinks it should have been aware,
but I do know what was said to the Ninth Circuit in the briefs
which were presented for it and the first line of the
argument points out that this is a Section 2255 ca.se and the
Ninth Circuit is fully aware of the fact, in Zack against
BEnson, the brief of which I just read from that it was a
2255 case and that was before it.
Of course, it does not preclude this Court, but

46
it certainly shows the view talcen by the one panel in the
Ninth Circuit which has ruled on it.
Finally, the Government speaks of the purposes of
deterrence and rehabilitation of Section 2255.

The purposes of

deterrence, it seems to me, are completely satisfied by the
existence of the alternative sanction of prosecution — of
prosecution and conviction for failure to report for a
physical examination which carries the same five-year,
$10,000 maximum penalty as refusal of induction and insofar as
concerns the purpose of

rehabilitation, I wonder what

rehabilitative purpose is served by allowing two men in
exactly the same situations to be in the status of one being
free and the other being under a criminal conviction and
possibly in jail.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:35 o7clock p.m., the case
was submitted.]
