DeFunis against Odegaard.

Mr. Diamond.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEF DIAMOND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DIAMOND;

Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of the

Court;
The plaintiffs ~ petitioners, rather, brought this
action for the reason that Marco DeFunis, Jr., was on two
occasions wrongfully denied admission to the law school.
Nov/, we da not contend that mathematical grades
alone were the sole admission criteria employed by the lav/
school. But the record is clear that taking all criteria in
account, in the law school’s own judgment, its minority
program resulted in the admission of the minority students
less qualified than non-minority students who were rejected.
Particularly .because there appears to be some
misconception of the facts by many of the amici briefs, and
possibly also the respondents*, I’d like to discuss a little
bit of the background and the factual situation with reference
to Marco DeFunis.
At the time we agreed to represent Marco DeFunis,
we had not met him and knew very little about him.

From the

facts related to us, and which we were later able to verify.

4
we Xirere certain that there was something wrong.
Marco attended grade school and high school in
Seattle, was graduated from the University of Washington as
an honor student in 1970„

He received Phi Beta Kappa,

Magna Cum Laude, and notwithstanding the fact that he had
worked twenty to forty hours a week all the time that he was
in college, as manual labor for the Park Department of the
city.
lie also taught Sunday school.

He had a junior-senior

grade point average of 3.71 out of a possible 4, as calculated
by the law school? or 3.8, when you include nine hours of
straight A's he received in Latin in the first quarter of his
junior year, in the summer of 1988s which the lav/ school
would not, for some reason, consider.
In 1971, after he had been rejected by the law
school and advised that if he tried again the following year
there might be room for him, he went to graduate school at
the same University of Washington.
work.

He took 24 hours of graduate

Again working thirty to forty hours a week with the

Park Department.

And he turned in grades of 21 hours of A,

and at the time of his application there were three hours of
incomplete, because he hadn’t got the grade as yet.
He had taken the law school admissions test on three
occasions, and received scores of 512, 566 and 568, and had
writing scores of 62, 5 8 and 54.

5
The law school aptitude test of 668, which is the
final one he took, was within the top seven percent of all
law school applicants across the nation who had ever taken
it in the past several years.
For DeFunis, as well as all other applicants, the
junior-senior grade point averages and the LSAT scores were
combined, using a formula to arrive at what was referred to
a3 the predicted first-year average.
case, was 76.23.

Which, in DeFunis’s

He had little money, and his wife worked as

a dental assistant, to help him through school, and he was
also helped by his parents.
He didn't know why he was denied admission to the
lav/ school.

We didn't know what his religion was, nor his

race, nor whether he belonged to a so-called minority group,
nor what constituted a minority group,

We didn't think it

mattered what his religion was, or whether he was black or
red or white.
It was inconceivable to us that an honor student,
with the grades that he had, Phi Beta Kappa, Magna Cum Laude,
from the same university, would not be qualified and would be
denied admission to the university law school.
To us it wasn't possible that all those who were
being admitted were better qualified than DeFunis.
We first met with the dean of the law school, and
inquired? what was the basis of denial?

He had the chairman

6

of the Admissions Committee,

The only answer we could get

was that there were other students better qualified than
DeFunis.
We told them we couldn't accept that.

We had to

see something to verify that fact.
The records were confidential, even though we said
we weren't interested in names, just

records to establish

that there were 150 or more better qualified.
No, all that was confidential matter.
We next appeared and met with the Board of Regents.
Took his parents with us.

I don't think we took the boy.

Again, the Board of Regents listened, said they
would let ut know.

They advised us that, No, they were going

to stand by the decision made by the Dean of the Law School
and the Admissions Committee, and that there was no room for
Marco DeFunis,
We had no alternative, after he had been denied
twice, but to bring a lawsuit.

And it was only after litiga­

tion was started and during pretrial discovery, in the taking
of depositions, and in fact only during the trial itself,
that we were able to get a court order requiring the university
to produce the files and the records of some of those who were
being admitted.
And we had to look at them during the noon hour,
because the trial was in process, and the court ordered them

7
brought down to the courtroom.

But not all 1500, 1600.

settled for about three or four hundred.

We

And during the noon

hour we went through those records.
And the record here will show you what we found when
we went through them, and we put them in evidence? as to who
they were taking into the school.
Now, what the university admissions class really
did, they admitted two classes, not one.

They took the non­

minority group and they looked at their grades and we're not
saying they looked only at their grades, but what else was
there to look at?

There were no personal interviews.

They looked at their grades and in the file they had their
grades, honors, recommendations, everybody had a recommendation
that they produced, the application of the student? and that's
about all.
And they determined, the chairman of the committee,
that anybody who had a predicted first-year average of 77
would automatically be admitted, with a few exceptions? most
of those came in later, and they actually admitted those, too.
So everyone that had a 77 or higher are automatically
admitted.
Then they took the next list, and any of them that
were 75 —- 74.5, they were automatically eliminated, with the
exception of the minorities.
QUESTION:

Well, of the returning servicemen.

8

MR. DIAMOND:

Yes, there were some returning

servicemen, except those, too; and we're raising no question
about the returning servicemen.

Most of them had previously

been admitted, and they were brought back.
Vie never at any time raised any issue about that.
QUESTION:

Now that I've interrupted you.

You said

during the noon hour you were able to get three or four hundred
out of the sixteen hundred total applications.
MR. DIAMOND:

That's correct.

To look at them,

that's all.
QUESTION:
at the trial.

To look at them during the noon hour,

Vie re the three or four hundred just randomly

chosen, or was —■ did that represent a particular category of
the sixteen hundred?
MR. DIAMOND:

We requested all of the minority

groups that were brought in, and some of the additional others,
they were kind of at random.

There were sixteen hundred,

we couldn't get them, we knew we wouldn't be able to look at
them all.
QUESTION:
MR. DIAMOND:

Right.
And so we got those that we could

look at, and we looked at them in the jury room during the
noon hour.

And there was markings on the cover with most of

them, so we could hurriedly go through them.
QUESTION:

Right,

And did this three or four

9
hundred include all who had been admitted to the law school?
MR. DIAMOND:

Yes, I believe so.

Now, when they divided into two classes, they took
the non-minority group and they determined

they were

left then between those between 77 and 74.5, with the
exception of the minority groups.
Now, the minority groups they took, and the black
minority group they gave to one of the admissions members,
who was a black student, a freshman in law school, and gave
them to him to review.
They took the other non -- the other minority
groups and gave them to Dean Hunt on the admission group,
and had him review that.
QUESTION:

Who besides Negroes were in the minority

group?
MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

What was that?
Who besides Negroes were in the

minority group?
MR. DIAMOND:

In the minority group besides the

Negroes, they had the Chicanos, the American Indians, the -QUESTION:
MR. DIAMOND:

Philippine Americans.
-- Philippine Americans.

And I think

th at * s it.
Now, that, too, was just an arbitrary determination.
So, out of the total number of minorities that had applied,

10

there were some seventy, and some tiling like forty of those
were admitted,,

Something around 60 or 65, close to 70 percent

of all of the minorities that applied were admitted to the
law school.
But, on the other hand, there was only something
less than ten percent of everyone else that was admitted.
Now, idle *— as they singled out the minorities,
they were not thrown out if they were below 74.5, and we find
that minorities were admitted with grades like 69.7, 67.14,
compared to DeFunis with 76.23, when 77 would have admitted
him.
Now, the — in determining that the black Americans
and the Chicanes and the Philippine Americans and American
Indians were minority applicants, there wasn't any determined
actually what constituted them, and how would you determine
that you were a black American or you were a Chicano?

It's

not always that easy; what's their percentages or whatnot.
Well, you made your own characterization on the
application blank, as to what you were, but you weren't
required to, and no one told anyone that if you were one of
the minorities you were going to get special treatment.
But you did get special treatment.

And they set

up two classes.
Now, when they had these two classes, in order to
determine how many you're going to allow in from each class,

11

you had to arrive at a ratio.

There was no other way.

going to allow all the minorities in,, or not?

You're

You couldn't.

Well, the fact of the matter is, they left a great
percentage, some 60 percent of the minorities in, and only
about ten percent of the whites.
But they had to make a determination, and, call it
what you please, it was a quota.
QUESTIONS

V7ho were offered admission, not people

who actually enrolled, is that true?
MR, DIAMOND:

These are the ones that were admitted,

that were offered admission* invited.

Yes, that's correct.

They invited some 311, and it was later stretched
to 330 that were invited, knowing that there were some who
would not come into the class and would go elsewhere, who
had applied in more than one school; so that they could
reduce it down and they would only have approximately 150.
QUESTION:

Is there in the Appendix anywhere a

copy of the application form, either blank or -MR. DIAMOND:

No.

I don't think there is.

But

there is in the special appendix at page 44, I believe it is,
a list of all those and their qualifications as to how they
appear.
QUESTION:

On the application form there was a

blank for filling in the applicant's race or ethnic background?
MR. DIAMOND:

On the application ■—•

12

QUESTION:

Was there?

MR. DIAMOND:

On the application form you were

requested to circle one of the following:

the Afro-American,

American Indian, Caucasian, Mexican-American, Oriental, or
other; specify.
You're asked either to circle or to specify.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. DIAMOND:

But it worded its law admissions

preferences to black Americans, Chicano Americans, American
Indians and Philippine Americans.
Nov/, an applicant couldn't characterize himself as
a Philippine American, and although Philippine Americans were
granted special admission preferences, an applicant could
characterize himself as an Oriental American; but an Oriental
wasn't granted any special preference.

There was no indication

at any time that minorities v/ould be granted some preference.
But you were requested to fill that out, and you could do so
or not, as you pleased, and you made your own self determina­
tion as to v/here you belonged.
Nov/, if Marco had been invited as one of the three
hundred —
QUESTION:

Well, since there were no personal

interviews, I suppose if Mr. DeFunis had circled one of these,
he would have given —
MR. DIAMOND:

We wouldn't be here today.

13

QUESTION:

lie would have been admitted.

HR. DIAMOND:

We wouldn't have any problem.

[Laughter. ]
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. DIAMOND:

None.

Now, as there were 311 and later 330 who were
invited to be enrolled, obviously Marco was very anxious to
get in.

If he had been invited, he would have accepted, and

he would have been in.
QUESTION:

Uhat is his ethnic background?

MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

What was that?
What is he?

What kind of an American

is he?
MR. DIAMOND:

Unh-hunh.

[Laughter. ]
MR. DIAMOND:

Well, he comes of Jewish parents,

I don't know at the time we brought this action, I think
Sephardic Jew, if I'm not mistaken.

His parents lived in

Seattle for more than fifty years, whether they were born
there or not, I'm not sure; grew up there.

He's a middle

family, his father, I think, is a furniture salesman.

He

went to school, as I indicated, worked all the time, got
help from his parents, and help from his wife to get through
school.

And made these grades at the same time.
QUESTION: But his ancestry —

14
MR. DIAMOND:
disadvantaged.

He was neither underprivileged or

\

Now, there was no indication that the minorities

that were being helped were underprivileged or disadvantaged,
or somebody that was poor or needed help.
of any kind.

No determination

If you just fit in this category, why, you got

special privilege.
QUESTION:

So if you just circled one of those

you got special treatment —
MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

If you circled one of those, yes,
— whether or not you fit.

That's your

point, isn't it?
MR. DIAMOND:

That's correct.

They never saw you,

they didn't know anything about you.
Nov; —
QUESTION:

Is Mr. DeFunis still in law school?

MR. DIAMOND:

Yes, Mr. DeFunis is still in law

school.
QUESTION:

When does your last quarter or semester

begin?
MR. DIAMOND:
February.

It begins sometime, I believe, in

This — now.
QUESTION:

So he will graduate this spring?

MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

Well, I'm hoping that he will graduate.

Presumably.

MR. DIAMOND:

DeFunis is in lav; school.

Now, you

15

asked for some briefs on the question of mootness, and we
furnished then to you.

Hr. DeFunis will graduate in June,

and he's doing exceedingly well* provided you do not sustain
the Suprene Court.
If you sustain the Supreme Court, he is only in
law school at the present tine because we have a stay signed
by Judge Douglas — Justice Douglas, which prevents the law
school, the university from doing anything about him being
in the school.
I night go back and say that when the Suprene Court
of the State of Washington reversed the lower court, we had
a problem.

Ilr. DeFunis was notified that he better apply

to the school, and they would, the admissions committee, and
they would determine whether they'd let him back in school
or not, or whether he could stay in school.
QUESTION: When was this?
MR. DIAMOND:

I missed that.

Right after the Supreme Court of

the State of Washington entered their remitter, and it came
down.
And at that time -QUESTION: That was during his second year?
HR. DIAMOND:

That's right.

year in school at that time.

He was in his second

The slow process *— no fault of

any party on either side, but the Supreme Court was a little
bit slow in coming out with a decision; and Marco was in school

16

all this tino.
And when that happened, we got a stay from Judge
Douglas, which prevented the university from doing anything
about it.
Now, what they would have done, I don't know, but
certainly they had the right, and he was, according to the
decision of the Supreme Court of our State, illegally in
school.

And he has been there, in the eyes of his — the

faculty and fellow students, illegally there because the
Supreme Court has said:

You are not rightfully there, but

you're there until this decision is made by this Court
pursuant to a stay.
QUESTION:

Hr, Diamond, somewhere in one of these

briefs — hundreds of them — there's a statement, I think
by the State, that there's an interval in February within
which he must apply for admission to the final semester.
HR, DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Has he applied within that interval?

MR. DIAMOND:

Well, I believe that that application

for his last quarter — we run in quarters at our school —
is some time this month. And I assume that he has applied,
because there's a stay and there's nothing to stop him,
I don't know,

I think he has applied, and I think if he

hasn't, he will apply.
And I might also state, even further:

for the first

17

tine -QUESTION:

This month ends day after tomorrow,

MR, DIAMOND:

That's right.

And I think — so he

must be — I have not been in touch with him in the last
couple of days.

I've been here,

I night state further that for the first time we
have something in writing in the brief, respondents' brief,
they state that Mr, Marco DeFunis will graduate.
QUESTION:

If he makes the application within this

interval,
MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

I think that's right.

Yes.

MR. DIAMOND:

But if this Court reverses this

decision, and assuming they could do it in the next — some
time before June or before he gets his diploma — what have
I got to protect Marco DeFunis?
I don't know who is going to be — we * ve just
had a change in the presidency of the university, We can
have a change in the faculty.

I have nothing but a statement

in a brief that says we're going to let him finish, under a
court decision that says you are illegally in the school,
I don't think we can rely on that.

I think we are

entitled — and I think there's something more —
QUESTION:

Well, if the university should let him

finish, — he's on the Law Review, isn't he?

18

I1R. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

I don't know, I can't answer that.
If he should finish, and graduate, what

about the question of mootness?
MR. DIAMOND:

Well, if this Court —

QUESTION; This is not a class action.
MR. DIAMOND:

If this Court keeps — if this Court

keeps the decision under wraps until after June, and he gets
his diploma and graduates, I don't think, even if you then
reverse it or what happens, I don't think anybody will come
and take his diploma away from him.
But he

I don't know whether you're going to keep

it that long.
I night also say, and we have a brief, there's more
than just this one case, now that we've got this far.
QUESTION: But this is not a class action, is it?
MR. DIAMOND:

No, it is not a class action, and

we're not concerned with that.
But under the authorities which we have submitted
to you, and I think you've reviewed before you probably set
this — granted certiorari, we did point out that there are
other like situations which are going to coma up, and that
this case ought to be decided.
Now, counsel has not taken the position that this
case is moot.
moot.

We have not take the position that this case is

And it is not, as far as we're concerned.

We still

19

have a live situation in spite of the statement which appeared
just when we got the respondents' brief, which was only about
two weeks ago, three weeks ago, where they stated that he would
stay in school and finish if he registers; and he probably
has registered by now.
QUESTION:

Mr. Diamond.

MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

Yes?
Is it possible for you to find out

whether or not he has registered, and what happened if he
did try to register, and let us know?
MR. DIAMOND:

Oh, I can.

But I think you can

assume that he either has or he will.

I don't think anybody

would stop him.
QUESTION:

Uell, I don't speak for anybody but

myself, and I cannot assume anything unless it's in the
record.
MR. DIAMOND:

Uell, first —

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. DIAMOND:

You'll supply that?

I'll be glad to supply that.

QUESTION: Well, why is it you don't want to?
MR. DIAMOND:
whatsoever.

No.

I have no hesitancy about it, none

None whatsoever.

I just don't have the information.
has.

Maybe counsel

I'm assuming that he has, and I'm sure he has, because

he was instructed to go ahead and do it; and there's no reason

20

why he souldn't.
QUESTION:

Mr. Diamond, if he does graduate, and if

this decision of the Washington Court is affirmed, will he,
nevertheless, be eligible to take the Washington bar
examination?
Even though your Supreme Court has said he has been
illegally in law school?
MR. DIAMOND:

I would think so, but I'm not too

sure I can answer that question.

I believe, in the State of

Washington, you can take the bar examination without having a
degree.
I think you can, through association with a lawyer,
obtain it? and I do believe that he would be permitted to
pass the bar.
I think, though, that on the question of mootness,
I think we have decided that, or this Court has, prior to this
time.

I think he is entitled to know and have a degree that

he earned, that is legally his, and that he has not got it
by default.
And I think in the briefs of the respondents, they
say that this question will arise again; and, as a matter of
fact, I have in my office two clients, one girl and one man,
waiting for the determination of this to see whether they can
get into law school.
QUESTION:

But nothing in Justice Douglas's stay

21

order required the university to give him passing grades.
MR. DIAMOND;

Oh, no; not at all.

Not at all.

He's earning them.
QUESTION:

I don't see how you could call his

degree won by default, then, if we held the case were moot»
MR. DIAMOND:
would be won by default.

No, I am not saying that his degree
I am saying that he is in law

school illegally.
The fact that he is making his grades, and he is
going to get his degree because he has passing grades, and
I think he's near the top of his class.

So that on that score

we will have no problem.
But he is not there, as far as his faculty is
concerned, and as far as the other students, he has had a
difficult time because he is there only because of the time
element involved in getting this question decided. And I
think he's entitled to have a decision of this Court, saying
that he is rightfully there.
Now, I did want to make sure, because I don't know
just how respondents are going to present this matter, but I
do want the Court to understand that there is no question in
this case but what the minorities were given preferential
treatment.

And that Mr. DeFunis, if he was black, he would

have been admitted and in the school.

The lower court found

that, the Supreme Court of the State found that

22

Now, the only thing they said

he was given,in the

Supreme Court, he was given preference, he was given special
~ the blacks were given special treatment, and the minorities?
and the only reason that they reversed the lower court was
that they said there was overriding public interest.
And I submit, and we've set it forth in the briefs,
that there cannot be an overriding public interest on this
question to admit those who are not equally qualified into
the law school.
And that's the only basis, and the only reason, our
Supreme Court allowed a reversal of that case.
I want to be sure that we understand.

The testimony

of Professor Kummert —
QUESTION:

Mr. Diamond, let me interrupt just a

minute.
You're not suggesting that a law school admissions

\
committee has to take the hundred and fifty brightest of the
applicants, or the ones who demonstrate the highest scores
on a test, are you?
MR0 DIAMOND:

No, sir,

I'm not saying that.

I am

saying that they have got to treat everybody alike, and
they're not going to set up two classes, one minority and one
non-minority.

They can set up any test they like, and they're

going to have to, in my opinion, going to treat them alike and
not treat them as two separate classes? as they did here.

23
You have two separate groups, separate tests, and
separate considerations for each of these two groups.
And that, I think, is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,
and a violation of the Civil Rights Act, which we have pointed
out, where —
QUESTION:

Was it found here, Mr. Diamond, that

but for the special consideration given the minority groups,
he would have been admitted?
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. DIAMOND:

That's right.

That was found in

the lower court, it was also found in the Supreme Court of
our State; and the only reason they did was they found an
overriding public interest to try and do something for past
discrimination against minority students.

Which, of course,

DeFunis had nothing to do with.
Now, we have no quarrel with any effort that you
can, on the affirmative program, to try and help minorities.
We have no quarrel with that.

We didn't even know we were

in a minority case, when we tried to get Mr. DeFunis into
this law school.

We have no quarrel.

And there are plenty of affirmative action programs
that can be undertaken to get more minorities into the law
schools, and we are in favor of that; we are not suggesting
for a moment that you shouldn't have it.
But we do not think that you can use race, to keep

24

out one group solely and only because of race.

And that’s what

was done here.
If DeFunis had been black, he would have been in.
He was kept out because he was white.
was kept out.

The only reason he

Ho other reason.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Diamond, you're now

MR. DIAMOND;

I better save a little time. Thank

you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SLADE GORTON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS.
MR. GORTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I will vary from my opening argument only in
connection with one of the questions which obviously bothers
this Court, as to the status of the case itself,- and that
relates to whether or not it is moot.
We think it is not moot, though such a decision on
your part, obviously would reinstate the State Supreme Court
decision and vindicate our program.
Mr. DeFunis will enter —

MR. GORTON:

That wouldn’t follow.

Subject to some further challenge.
If we find it moot, I expect we'd

vacate it and send it back for reconsideration.
HR. GORTON;

If you found it moot on the grounds

that he was already graduated, Hr. Justice Brennan?

Or

about to graduate.
QUESTION;

Well, what do you do in your State

about a case when it becomes moot, before it’s final?
HR. GORTON;

I suppose the original action might

simply be to dismiss.
QUESTION;

Well?

QUESTION; Well.
[Laughter.]
HR. GORTON;
QUESTION;

That would validate —
Your Supreme Court might do that if we

found it moot.
MR. GORTON; It might very well.
QUESTION:

If we sent it back to them; that's

right.
HR. GORTON:

That would validate our program in

any event.
QUESTION:

It would what?

QUESTION; Why would it?
QUESTION:

It would validate it for the past.

MR, GORTON;
QUESTION;
MR. GORTON;

For the past,
Yes.
Until someone else brought another

challenge and came back here, probably under the same
circumstances, which is the principal ground on which we
regard the case, not as being moot.
As far as Mr. DeFunis is concerned, the time for
registration for the final quarter of his law school began
on February 20th, it ends on March 1st, the day after tomorrow.
On Thursday, when we left, he had picked up his
application forms; he may or may not, Mr. Justice Marshall,
have filed them.

lie certainly will have by Friday,

He would — even if he had been required to ask
readmission, he would have been granted that readmission,

studies; which
he is.

/

He is not Law Review, Mr, Justice Rehnquist, he's
roughly in the middle of his class.
Once he has registered on the — no later than the
1st of March, there will be — he will then complete his
lav; school studies, assuming he passes his courses in the last
semester.
The only discretion which would then remain in the
law school would be if he failed the course in his last
semester, and requested special permission to come back in the

27
fall to make up for it, in which case, of course, he'd be in
exactly the sane positioii as any other student who had failed
would be.
QUESTION:

What if a decision of this Court came

down, say, on May 1st, affirming the judgment of the Supreme
Court of Washington, what would the Board of Regents do with
the petitioner?
MR. GORTON:

Nothing.

He would — assuming he

passes his courses, he would receive his degree, and he
would take his bar examination.
It is not correct to characterize the State Supreme
Court's decision as saying he was illegally in law school.
The State Supreme Court decision said that the program of
admissions adopted by the law school was valid, and that he
was not deprived of equal protection.
It did not order us to take him out of lav; school.
QUESTION:

How about the others who had 76.4,

would they have an equal protection claim, not having been
given a special dispensation here?
MR. GORTON:

I suspect that they have probably

rested on their rights too long at this point, Mr. Chief
Justice.
The University of Washington Law School has
selected its limited number of students from a large pool
of clearly qualified candidates.

The considerations employed

23

in the difficult but necessary choice between applicants
have included, among several other factors, that of the race
of those applicants»
One goal of that policy has been to improve the
quality of the education of all lav/ students by better
preparing them to practice lav/ in a pluralistic society»
Twenty-four years ago this Court said:

the law

school, the proving ground for legal learning and practice,
cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and
institutions with which the lav; interacts.
Our related gocil has been the improvement of the
entire legal profession, by helping it better to reflect and
to understand and to represent all elements in the pluralistic
society in which the bar plays so important a role.
This system of law school admissions is not unique
or isolated to toe University of Washington,

With minor

variations, it is the system used by a wide range of American
law schools, many of whom have joined in briefs in its
defense,
QUESTION: Does toe State of Washington have a pro •
rata system for admission of minorities to practice law?
MR, GORTON:
QUESTION:

It does not, Mr, Justice Douglas,
Is the race disclosed on the examination

papers?
MR, GORTON:

It is not.

The bar examination in the

29

State of Washington is entirely anonymous as to every person
who takes it, and entirely neutral as to .race.
I can say, however, that ten of the thirteen members
of these four minority groups who were in the Class of 1973
in the lav/ school passed the July 19 73 bar examination.
So they were obviously qualified without any regard to race
whatsoever.
Although

I suspect their so-called predicted averages were

much lower them many others.
QUESTION:

Really, that in and of itself doesn't

prove that. What is the percentage of the others?
MR. GORTON:

The percentage of all last year was

extraordinary, Mr. Justice Dlackmun.

It was 92 percent,,

So that the percentage of the minority students was slightly
lower.

But it still was very highly successful.
QUESTION: Well, three out of thirteen is •—
MR. GORTON:

Twenty — twenty-one percent,

something like that.
QUESTION:

— substantially lower than 92 percent.

MR. GORTON:

The difference between 92 and 79j it

still is quite a high success rate.

And of course you get

more than one crack at the bar examination there.
QUESTION:

Is this the -- this policy at the

university, the outcome of increasing demand for minority
lawyers?

30

HR. GORTONs
QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

A tremendous -—
I mean among the public at large.
It is in the sense that the law school

and the university itself has recognized their almost total
exclusion from the bar in society as a whole, and in the
State of Washington.
One of the major elements in the record in this
case, of course, is Dr0 Odegaard's testimony to exactly that
extent.
Actually, here, in the name of equal protection,
this petitioner asks you to return us to a system of law
school student selection which, at the University of Washington,
which has never engaged in racial discrimination by force of
law, only produced twelve black graduates out of 3812 between
1902 and 1969.
QUESTION:
apply.

Perhaps that was because they didn’t

Do you have anything in the record on that?
MR. GORTON:

I don't believe we do, Your Honor,

QUESTION: Well, then, does that h@lp us?
MR. GORTON:

They applied in very small numbers,

there’s no question about that.

I think it is probable, but

I can't prove it, that they applied in somewhat larger
numbers them they were admitted.
Because in this particular case, if you followed the
guidelines which the petitioner has asked you to follow, we

31

would have had an absolutely white lav/ school,

MR. GORTON:
QUESTION;

Just two?
Yes, just two.

In the State.

Your record somewhere indicates, I

think a Negro population, or at least one of the minority
group populations of 2,2 or some such figure.

Would you

think it would be appropriate for the State of Washington to
say that. We will admit 2.2 percent to the law school of a
particular minority that was, that had a 2.2 membership in
the total population of the State?
MR. GORTON:
feel that way.

I do not, Mr. Chief Justice Burger,

Your statistic is accurate, and it is matched

in connection with the Chicano population of the State.
And I do not, for three reasons;
First, Idle University of Washington is a national
law school.

It is not limited to the State of Washington.

Second, the goal of this policy was an educational
goal.

It wished to have a sufficient variety of students in

the law school, so that their own educational experience,

32

which, as you well know, is largely, at least, in discussions
among students would be broadened.

And so that the outlook

of the white students as well as of the minority students
would be more understanding.

Its goal was also to see to it

that the bar had that same advantage, of representing all
classes and groups in society in the State of Washington.
And simply to pick some kind of quota based precisely
on State population would meet neither of those goals,
QUESTION:

Mr, Attorney General, is this policy

limited to the law school by the university?
MR. GORTON:

No,

There are similar policies in

other schools in the university; but I cannot describe them
in the detail which I can describe the ones in the law school,

QUESTION:

What we call the pro rata system, and

we've had it in other cases.
MR, GORTON:

Right.

But we are not, we do not

operate such a system, and we are not asking you to validate
such a system.

33
What we are saying is that the statistical judgments
or the statistical scores, which are used in connection with
lav; school admissions, are not invariable and totally
accurate predicters of success, nor do they solve the problem
of ending the effects of racial discrimination.
In this particular case, we're dealing with a student
who was only marginally qualified when he was compared with
all of the people who were admitted into the school.
were 1601 applications.

There

Most of them were qualified people.

Three hundred and thirty were eventually given letters or
notices of admission.

On predicted first-year averages,

Mr. DeFunis ranked about 290th in that group of 330.
A number of people above him were denied admission,
a number of people below him were given admission.
Ilad we picked the top 330 students, simply on the
basis of predicted first-year average, one minority person
would have been among it, and he didn't enter the school.
And we would have had a little white school; we might have
been subject to a challenge on the basis that we were —
that we were deliberately discriminatory.
We did give notice to these students that other
matters except for law school admissions test scores and
grades were counted in connection with law school.
You have it on page 0 of our brief.
Each student, before he applied, received a notifica-

34
tion, three paragraphs of which are quoted on page 8, which
says in the last paragraph:
"We gave no preference to, but did not discriminate
against, either Washington residents or women in making our
determinations.

An applicant's racial or ethnic background

was considered as one factor in our general attempt to convert
formal credentials into realistic predictions."
This is precisely what the law school did.
QUESTION: Does it really make any difference to the
basic issues in this case whether he was No. 1 or No„ 290?
MR. GORTON:

No.

It does not, Your Honor.

I think

it was a matter of considerable interest here, and I think it
may have been somewhat misstated by petitioner; but it does
not.
What matters here is whether or not the law school
admissions policy was based on appropriate educational
judgments on the part of the law school itself.
Obviously neither Mr. DeFunis nor any other
individual had a constitutional right to enter the University
of Washington Lav/ School.
QUESTION:

That was impossible.

Well, do you think past discrimination,

either in Washington or elsewhere, is an educational
consideration?
MR. GORTON:

I think that it is — I think that it

is, Mr. Justice White, as long as it is relatively narrowly

35

conceived*.
Remember, to gain —
QUESTION:

I understand*

I understand your argument

about educational considerations otherwise; but I don’t
quite understand that one.

I’m not saying it isn't a valid

qualification; I just wonder why you call it educational,
or why you even think you have to.
MR. GORTON:

All right.

Let me answer the question

more precisely.
Ue feel that in connection with these particular
minorities, the fact of discrimination against and in our
society over literally hundreds of years has had a very real
effect.

It means that fewer of them actually graduate from

college, by percentage, than other groups in our society.
It means those who do frequently have lower grade points,
and certainly have shown up with lower law school admissions
test scores.
So that if we used only these mathematical
determinants of admission for law school, we would continue
to exclude them.
VJe didn't admit any of them who were not qualified.
I think this is vitally important.

Even on a statistical

basis, coupled with other background items not related to
race at all, they were qualified, and they've shown themselves
to be qualified to handle law students.

36

QUESTION:

When you say "qualified", Mr. Gorton,

really by the time you’ve diluted that phrase as much as you
have in your approach to admissions, it doesn't mean a whole
lot; does it?

When you consider the minority applicants

separately, and really don't have any base, any cutoff point
on tiie predicted first-year average.
MR. GORTON:

Neither of those assumptions are

correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

They were not considered

separately, except on the same kind of preliminary basis
that everyone was considered separately.

All of the people,

other than those who v/ere of such high intellectual attairments that they received almost immediate admission after
their applications came in, were considered by an individual
member —
QUESTION:

Cut these were the only groups that

weren't automatically excluded if they were below 74.
MR. GORTON:

That is not true either, Mr. Justice

White.
\

QUESTION:
MR. GORTON:

Except for veterans.

You're right.

No, even beyond veterans.

There were

— there was the ability on the part of the Dean of
Admissions to say that he felt that there were factors
involved in a particular application of a white non-veteran,
with a PFYA of below 74,5, which would cause him to be
considered by the entire Admissions Committee.

37
QUESTION:

But it took the Dean's intervention to

do that with a white person, and it did not —
HR. GORTON:

It did — it did that, Mr. Justice

Relinquish.
QUESTION:

And that was — so that that was a

difference in treatment, was it not?
MR. GORTON:

That was clearly a difference in

treatment, but it was a difference in treatment which was
required by the Admissions policy, which of course was based
on the particular educational and professional goals which
the university adopted.
However, remember that large numbers of the members
of these minority groups were in fact excluded from law
school.
There was *— they had to have a predicted first-year
average, either alone or coupled with other precise academic
qualifications, which would indicate that they could
successfully complete a law school education.

If, for example,

one of them came in with a PFYA of 59, where the lowest
passing grade in law school is 60, he would not have been
admitted.

Very few were admitted below 68, and only in those

cases when something else indicated that they could actually
attain a 68 or better average.
Now, we were faced with a situation, all of society
was faced with a situation in connection with particular

38

minorities, who have been the subject of discrimination in
the past, which could not be cured by a simple application of
a number of statistical formulae.
If we were to continue the old system, we would
have continued the old method of not having these minority
groups represented in lav; school.
Moreover, this particular program is, in effect,
self-liquidating.

As the effects of discrimination lessen

or cease, presumably more of these minorities will graduate
from college, they will get better test scores, they will
have better grades, and in precisely -- to precisely that
extent the preference itself will disappear.
This Court has never —• has never — declared
invalid or even subject to strict judicial scrutiny a program
which was directed at benefitting minorities who were the
subjects of previous racial discrimination.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General —
What do you do with the findings that

there were minority people below this man?

Inferior to him

— I've forgotten what the phrase was»
MR, GORTON:

What we do with those findings is to

admit that on the statistical basis of predicted first-year
averages they were below.

But that the law school was not

simply looking for the 150 persons with the highest predicted
first-year averages.

That it had other valid social values.

39
These people who were below Mr. DeFunis in predicted
first-year average were, nevertheless, qualified to do law
school work, and were determined by the law school Admissions
Committee to be ready and able and, as a matter of

fact,

that they would contribute more, given the nature of the
whole class, first to the law school and to the educational
experience of every student within it:
Chicano, the whole works.

white, black,

And that they could contribute

more to the bar, which obviously is the goal of law school.
Which, of course, is only intermediate, itself.
QUESTION:
law many years ago,

Mr. Attorney General, when::I wasr.teaching
I discovered to my consternation that—,

these tests, these so-called tests had built-in racial
bias.

Is there any finding in this record as to your test?
MR. GORTON:

There is no finding in this record,

Mr. Justice Douglas, because neither party wished even to
bring that subject up.
Obviously Mr. DeFunis would not make that claim,
and the University of Washington did not attempt in court to
prove that it engaged in previous racial discrimination.
I think, however, that you are perfectly capable of
looking, for example, at the Single Appendix in this case,
seeing —
QUESTION:

No, even when I was teaching, I couldn't

find out how they did it; but it was very subtle, built-in

40

system to see that certain minorities didn't get into the
\

\

school.
MR» GORTON;

Mr. Justice Douglas, I don't think the t

there has ever been, at least in this school, any kind of
such deliberate attempt.

I think because of the difference,

because of the effects of racial discrimination, that happens
in fact, even with what you called, in the Griggs case, for
example, a test which is neutral on its surface.

And you

might very well, in a proper case, find that the predicted
first-year average had a built-in racial bias.
But that is not included in particular findings or
particular charges in this case.
What we have done, you see, is to try to — is to
say that the Court, this Court has now for twenty years said
there is a very tremendously high value in an integrated
society.
We don't think this Court says;

You can only get

to an integrated society as a result of orders of this Court;
that you can only walk, not run, to the nearest exit from
discrimination.
We have engaged in a voluntary program, very precise
in its outlook.

Racial discrimination was the problem,

therefore race had to be the criterion for solving that
problem.

We are precisely within Mr. Justice Burger's

holding for this entire Court in Swann v. Charlotte, remedial

41

judicial authority does not put judges in the shoes of school
authorities, whose powers are plenary,.

School authorities

are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and
implement educational policy, and might well conclude, for
example, that in order to prepare students to live in a
pluralistic society, each school should have a prescribed
ratio of Negro to white students, reflecting the proportion
of the district as a whole.
To do this as an educational policy is within the
broad discretionary powers of school authorities.
QUESTION s

Is there any tiling in that context that

would keep anyone out of any school, however?
HR. GORTON:

There is not, Your Honor, but lots of

people are kept out of the University of Washington Law
School.

Only if one characterizes Mr. DeFunis's constitu­

tional entitlement to be to a State-financed law school
education does that become a relevant question.
In the Swann case, parents who expected, in good
faith, to be able to choose their children's school by the
choice of their residence, teachers who, in good faith, felt
that they could choose their assignments, were told that they
could not because integration, the end of segregation, was a
more important social goal.
What Mr. DeFunis was entitled to here was essentially
the same thing.

lie was entitled to a policy,not a narrow

42

policy which says the highest grades get all the positions,
but a policy which took into account valid educational and
professional grounds, which include the effects of discrimina­
tion in the world as a whole, outside of the halls of this
law school,,

And under those -circumstances -—

QUESTION;

But the university --

MR. GORTON;

— he was in exactly the same position

as the schoolchildren in Swann,
QUESTION;

Did the university or the law school

conduct any sort of generalized study to determine whether
grades had a direct correlation with success and effectiveness
in the practice of law?
(Laughter, ]
MR, GORTON;

The university did not do so in

connection with this particular program, Mr, Chief Justice,
But the amici, many of the briefs of friends of the court
here have indicated that the statistics, both grades in
college — for that matter grades in law

school frequently

-- together with the law school admissions test do not make
such predictions.

At the very best, the statistics which Mr,

Diamond uses predict your first-year average in lav; school?
they predict nothing about the contribution you will make to
the bar, the contribution you will make to trie law school,
how much income you will make in the bar, what kind of
legal career you will seek.

43
So the University of Washington was saying that we
have a responsibility to do more than to predict or to pick
those students who will get the highest first-year law school
grades.

We have a duty to pick people who v/ill serve their

nation, their society.

We have a duty to see to it that the

effects of an exclusionary policy, which may not have been
required by law, will be ended, not only in our school but
in our society as a whole.
We were doing, I submit, precisely what you said we
had tiie discretion to do when you wrote the opinion for the
entire Court in the Swann case.
QULSTIOiJ:

hut you haven't pointed out how that would

exclude anyone, as Mr. DeFunis would have been excluded.
MR. GORTOIJ:

It is clear that at the primary school

and the secondary school level no one is excluded, but
whether or not that is a greater or a lesser rate than we
are concerned with here, is really a question, a distinction
without a difference.
livery one goes to school through high school, or is
at least entitled to.

IJo one is entitled to a law school

education at the expense of the State.
Thirteen hundred people wore excluded from this
class of the University of Washington Law School.

Some of

cne race, some of the very races who were the beneficiaries
of this special program.

44
The point is that what the children and their parents
and the teachers lost in Swann was every bit as vital a right,
or every bit as vital a privilege as the privilege which Mr.
DeFunis lost here.
lie wasn’t entitled to admission.

He was entitled

to an appropriate judicial, or an appropriate admissions
process.

But that he is telling you that process must be

limited, it must be — it must be without any regard to its
effects on society as a whole.

He got not only a proper

consideration of his application, he got the best possible
consideration of his application, and his law school career
is much improved now, today, because it includes in it
eighteen members of these minority groups.

This will help

him in his law school career, it will help him in his practice.
But he would have you deny them a position in law
school by the use of mechanical criteria, not in some
theoretical possible model, but in exactly the same system
which we always used before, and which did in fact result in
tiie exclusion of minority students to the law school.
QUBGTIOU:

Mr. Attorney General, I think you haven't

told us who iias formulated this precise policy.

Is it the

Board of Regents of the university?
MR. GORTOII:

IJo, sir.

It is the law school itself.

Committee?
MR. GORTON:

I think it was -- at this particular

time it was five faculty and two students.

policy.

Committee.

No person was admitted without the approval of

the entire committee, though almost every particular applica­
tion was viewed initially by one or one or two of the members
of the committee, and his recommendation is passed on.

would keep a person out?

You made the statement..a while ago that

the law school was a national law school.

Do you charge non

49

residents more tuition than Washington residents?
MR. GORTON:

We do,

QUESTION: So, to that extent, it is something less
than a national law school?
MR. GORTON:

Oh, to that extent, Michigan is

something less than a national lav; school, I suppose, too,
I believe that every State university law school probably
has a majority or at least a plurality of its students from
its own State, and the University of Washington is certainly
that.

It has attempted to be a national law school, and it

has many students from other States,
QUESTION:

Well, it certainly discourages non­

residents from coming, doesn't it?
MR, GORTON:

It is an element with the number of

law school applications? however, I think it's probably a
relatively small element today.
Thank you,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Diamond, you have

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEF DIAMOND, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS,
MR. DIAMOND:

Thank you,

Counsel has stated that a number of minority students
— or a number of non-minority students, that had grades below
74.5, were accepted

50

I call the Court’s attention to Schedule A in the
Single Appendix, at page 37, and there it lists all of those
who were admitted to the class as of August 1st, 1971»

And

you will find that not a single non-minority student was
accepted with grades anywhere near as low as those that were
accepted for the minority.

They are all spelled out, and

there isn’t one.
I also want to call the Court's attention to the
fact that we do not contend that the applicants were accepted
on grades alone, and, as a matter of fact, the testimony of
the witnesses was not that they accepted students with lower
grades alone, they accepted students with lower grades and
qualifications.

They examined the entire record on all the

students, the minorities and the non-minorities; and they
accepted those with lower grades.
The same question answers the other one as to who
set up this policy.

The question which is in the record was

asked of the president of the law school, Hr, Odegaard, in
connection with the new policy with reference to minorities,
tliat you have approved —
QUESTION:

The president of the law school?

You

mean the president of the university, don't you?
HR. DIAMOND:
sorry.

Excuse me.

The president of the university, I'm

President of^- the law school.

If the new policy

51
[Laughter, ]
MR. DIAMOND:

-- with reference to minorities —

university, I'm sorry — that you have approved and the
Regents have approved or adopted, whether that policy permits
the law school admissions to admit minority students with
lower grades and qualifications than the other students.
And his answer was:

I think it does.

And tiie same thing with reference to Dean Roddis,
the dean of tiie law school, he testified to the same thing.
And tiie court found, tiie lower court found, and tiie Supreme
Court found that they were allowing students in with lower
grades and qualifications,

VJe're not just talking about

mechanical grades.
The question was asked, and counsel made the
statement —
QUESTION:

What are the qualifications you're

talking about?
MR. DIAMOND:

What was that?

QUESTION: What are tiie qualifications you're
talking about?
MR. DIAMOND:

The qualifications are what were in

their application file, filled out by them, the recommendations
that they furnished, their grades, their honors, the courses
that they took are listed along with their grades that were
submitted, and their work habits, as was shown in there —

52
QUESTION:

And the record shows that you or the

court or somebody went through all of them and you found that
out?
MR. DIAMOND:

Mo, sir.

The record shows that that's

all that the admissions committee had to look at*
QUESTION: Well, how do you know that there were some
with lower qualifications?
MR* DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

llow do we know what?
That there were some minority people

with lower qualifications, not lower averages.
MR. DIAMOND:
testimony stated so.

Because the university in their
The president said so, Dean Roddis

said so, the chairman, Professor Kummert, said so; that they
were exceptions —
QUESTION:
MR. DIAMOND:

With less qualifications?
Yes, without qualifications.

They

testified that students with lower qualifications and lower
grades were accepted.

They did.

And they said that they were reaching out to ■—
QUESTION:

And you understand that what they

meant by qualifications was just what you said?
MR. DIAMOND:

They had nothing else to go on, it

couldn't be anything else.

All they had was the same thing

that they had with reference to Mr. DeFunis.

QUESTION: Well, as I understand it, the phrase
was in the interrogator’s question, and the answer was yes,
MR, DIAMOND:

In some cases, and that one I

read; but in others it was not.

It was — in Dean Roddis,

it was not; he testified to it himself.
The other question was asked —
QUESTION:

In terms of the university -- in

terms of the law school’s policy, these people were fully
qualified?
MR. DIAMOND:

Well, that’s a relative matter.

The university testified that they were qualified for the
lav/ school, but it's a relative matter,
two classes.

They set up these

If they took those that had better qualifica­

tions, as they admitted, they wouldn't have had room for
these.

So they had to set up a ratio between them.
If they — they did say and they did testify that

any of the 1600 they thought could have just maintained
themselves in school, and would have passed.

But you've got

a relative situation, you can’t take 1600; so they should
be taking, we assume, the better qualified, not necessarily
with the better grades.
QUESTION:

Yes, but perhaps by old standards the -

perhaps by the standards that part of the people were judged
by, these people were unqualified.

But in terras of the ove

all policy, admissions policy of the school, the school did

54

pick people who were best qualified for their/purposes„
I think if you look at the record, and you look
at the findings of the court, you'll find that they did not,.
QUESTION;

Yes, but in terms of their goals, in

terms of their —
MRo DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

University goals?

In terms of the law school's goals and

their policies, they chose the people who would satisfy
those policies.
MR. DIAMOND;

Well, let me — let me answer that --

QUESTION: And the question really is whether they
. the law school may have these priorities and these
preferences»
MR. DIAMOND:

I think if they use the same test

for everyone, they would have that right.

Dut let me answer

you on that with this notation -~
QUESTION:
what test?

Well, what test?

You keep saying test,

Aren't you really banking on the test -- isn't

test and qualification, to use —
MR. DIAMOND:

Whatever they used.

When you have

1600 people making application, you only have room for 150,
you're going to have to make some determination of which
are the best qualified.
QUESTION: Well, —
MR. DIAMOND;

Now, the only thing we've got here

55
is the president of the university, the dean of the law
school? the chairman of the Admissions Committee, telling us
that they did not select the best qualified students.

I

can't give you any more than that.
QUESTION:

I submit that’s not all you have.

You

have —
MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

Let me --

— all the discovery.

You had all the

discovery you could use, if you wanted to use it.
MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

We got enough.

Well, I want you to show me exactly what

any of these witnesses meant by the word "qualifications"?
in the record,
MR. DIAMOND:

Well, there — let me cover this one

for just a moment.
On January 9th, 1974 —
QUESTION:

When you get through, will you cover

mine?
MR. DIAMOND: Sir?
QUESTION; Whenyau get through, will you cover
mine?

When you get through.
MR. DIAMOND:

Yes, I will endeavor to.

On January 9th, 1974, I requested and received a
letter from the Attorney General with reference to the 19
specially admitted students, and this is what they tell me:

56

Of the 19 specially admitted in the class commencing
September 1971, ten of whom are black, three Chicano, three
Asian-Americans, three native American, fifteen are currently
enrolled in the law school*

Seven of whom are black, three

Chicano, three Asian Americans, and two native Americans*
Now, out of the nineteen, then, we have fifteen
remaining today in the law school.

If my mathematics are

correct, there’s 22 percent that are no longer in the law
school*

I don't know why they’re not there, but they are

not there*
And counsel would have you believe that they were
maintaining their percentage.
This does not establish that*

And I submit it does

not,
Nov/, may I answer your question — I don’t remember
exactly what it was, Mr* Justice,
[Laughter. 3
QUESTION:

You may forget it*

MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

You have my permission to forget it*

MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

Thank you,
May I ask a question?

MR* DIAMOND:
QUESTION;

What was that?

Yes*

The guide for applicants that you have

referred to does not suggest that race is a controlling

57
criteria»

It suggests a number of factors, in addition to

the college boards and the cumulative grade scores; it
refers to extracurricula and community activities, to employment
record, to general background, and then states that one factor
in our general attempt to convert formal credentials into
realistic predictions is racial or ethnic backgrounds.
Is it your position that only the formal scores
may be considered, or do you agree that admissions committees
have broad discretion and may consider these factors that
are in this policy guide?
MR. DIAMOND:

Yes, I think they can.

They apply them

to everyone on the same basis,
QUESTION:

So you think — is it your position that

if the guide had been followed, you wouldn’t be here today?
MR, DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

There's no question about that,

In other words, you're claiming that

the guide promulgated by the authorities was not in fact
applied?
MR, DIAMOND:
QUESTION s

Mr. Diamond —

MR. DIAMOND:
QUESTION:

That is correct, it was not.

Yes?

— if the Chief Justice will permit me,

with the red light on —- let me get away from this racial
aspect a little bit.
of medicine,

Let's speak of our sister profession

with which I have a little familiarity in the

58

past.
There's been a great deal of talk about the need
for general practitioners, and the need for newly trained
physicians to get out into small communities.
Suppose in the University of Washington Medical
School there were some applicants who said, I would like to
go into the mountains or into the desert, or wherever it .is,
and I'm not desirous to specialize in orthopedics or
neurosurgery,

I just want to be a general practitioner.

And yet his qualifications, his undergraduate work,
gradewise, was less than a number of others who wanted to
specialize.

Do you think this factor, whether it’s valid or

not, as a matter of medical concern, but today it is
assumed to be, I think --- do you think this factor of the
need for general practitioners and the desire for general
practitioners would be something that the Admissions Committee
of the medical school could validly take into consideration?
MR, DIAMOND;

Not at that level,

I think an

affirmative action program, and I think that's what you're
talking about, I think is good, valid, and I'm all for it,
whether it's for lav/ students or whether it's for medical.
And I think it should be based not on race, it should be based
on the disadvantaged, the underprivileged, the undercultured,
those that need help, the poor; and I think that what you
should do is go out and recruit them, give them some special

59
training,, some special service, set up a special category,
make lawyers and make doctors out of the people that want to
do tiie tilings that you want to do, but not on the basis of
race, not on the basis of anything except the —
QUESTION?

Well, you see, my question was an

attempt to gat away from race, it was an attempt to focus
on the need of a community, not on the qualifications
particularly of the applicant,
I take it you feel that they could not take this
into consideration,
MR, DIAMOND;

I'm not ready to subscribe to the

theory that minority clients are looking for minority
lawyers or doctors,

I think they are looking for the best

qualified doctors and lawyers to look after their needs,
and I submit that they better look for the best qualified,
and not one that matches their own skin or color,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,

above-entitled matter was submitted,]
