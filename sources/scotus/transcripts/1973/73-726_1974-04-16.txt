MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

We will resume arguments

in No. 73-726, Cooper Stevedoring against Kopke.
Mr. Cheavens, you have 23 minutes remaining.
CONTINUED ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. CHEAVENS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHEAVENS%

Thank you, your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

Yesterday

when the argument was interrupted we were discussing the
specific district court rinding.

It will be recalled that the

district court found that the vessel was unseaworthy and the
vessel owner negligent in three respects:

In failing to

secure the cargo in Mobile, in failing to dunnage off the
cargo in Mobile, and because of the presence of the piece of
paper covering the crack which was the immediate cause of
the plaintiff’s injury.
The district court also found that Cooper was
negligent in two respects:

With respect to the failure to

secure and with respect to the failure to dunnage off in Mobile.
Now, the precise legal significance of these findings
has to be rather carefully scrutinized.
First of all, it is to be noted that there is no
finding of joint liability of the ship and Cooper to the
plaintiff.

There is no finding of joint liability because

the plaintiff, it will be recalled, did not sue Cooper.

10
Now, the sigiiificance of this is that since the
plaintiff did not sue Cooper,, there is thus no ~ and I am
quoting here from Respondents' brief — no common liability
for concurrent fault which is — and again to use the words
of Respondents' brief at page 25 —■ which is the sine qua non
of contribution.

That is, there is no joint liability because

the plaintiff didn't sue Cooper.
The second significance of the district court's
finding is that Coopex^s negligence was found to be negligence
vis-a-vis the plaintiff.

That is, the acts which Cooper did,

the failing to secure and the failing to dunnage off were
found on the careful examination of the district court's
findings at 163 and .164 of the Appendix, were found to be
negligence, becatise this created a risk of harm to the
plaintiff and subsequent longshoremen.

But these findings

are legally immaterial because, again, the plaintiff, for
tactical considerations, did not sue Cooper.
The third legal significance to these findings is
that under these findings and under the undisputed facts, there
is not found to be any breach of duty by Cooper to the vessel
because the two things Cooper was faulted for — failing to
secure and failing to dunnage — as between the ship and
Cooper, the ultimate decision there was made by the ship.
was the ship that decided whether or not to dunnage.

It

If the

ship wanted it dunnaged, the evidence shows Cooper would have

II
dunnaged.

If the ship wanted the cargo secured, Cooper would

have been happy to secure the cargo for, of course, an
additional price.

But those decisions were decisions of the

ship.
Thus, regardless of this Court’s treatment of the
more general problem before the Court, namely, the right of
contribution between joint tort-feasors in admiralty, there
are two very specific reasons in this specific case why this
is an improper case for contribution.
First of all, because, as we have seen, the party
which has been granted contribution, the vessel, has already
been fully indemnified.
Stevedore.

It was fully indemnified by Mid-Gulf

So that if we view the case as one where it is

the vessel which is suing Cooper for contribution, the vessel’s
cause of action is extinguished.

The Court might feel, but

while it isn’t the real party of interest here, Mid-Gulf,
because Mid-Gulf has stepped into the shoes of the vessel and
has taken over the vessel’s defense.

But if that’s the

situation, then contribution is doubly unfair because if the
plaintiff — let's change the situation slightly — had the
plaintiff sued Cooper alone --- let’s assume, for instance, the
ship was not — you could not get jurisdiction over the ship; or
hhe vessel owner was insolvent or something of the sort.
So the plaintiff sues only Cooper.
Cooper, even under the rule urged by the respondent,

12

would not be able to get contribution from Mid-Gulf because
Mid-Gulf is statutorily immune from direct action by the
plaintiff.
QUESTION:

But if Mid-Gulf indemnified the ship, it

v/ould indemnify it only for its actual loss.
MR. CHEAVENS:

Its actual loss is measured by the

liability of the vessel to the plaintiff.
QUESTION:
pocket costs?

Yes, but isn’t indemnity for out-of-

And if the ship ultimately is liable for only

half, let’s say, it's only out of pocket for half the liability
MR. CHEAVENS:

With ail due respect, Mr. Justice

White, I think that suggestion is circular.
QUESTION:

Well, somebody is going to — let’s

assume the vessel secures indemnity from Cooper.
MR. CHEAVENS:
QUESTION:

Contribution, assume contribution.

MR. CHEAVENS:
QUESTION:

Indemnity or contribution?

Yes.

Then what?

MR. CHEAVENS:

Well, under the judgment of the

district court, entire liability was imposed on the vessel?
the full amount of the judgment is assessed against the vessel.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. CHEAVENS:

And then?
Then the vessel is entitled to

contribution.
QUESTION:

From?

13

MR. CHEAVENS:
QUESTION:

Fifty percent.

MR. CHEAVENS:
QUESTION:

From Cooper,

Fifty percent.

But then how about Mid-Gulf?

Then the

vessel is out 50 percent of liability, and then how much does
Mid-Gulf have to pay the vessel?
MR. CHEAVENS:

But in the first instance, before we

reach that point, and indeed that point has been reached, the
judgment against the plaintiff is no longer in the case, and
the plaintiff’s judgment has been satisfied and has been
satisfied by Mid-Gulf as the refusal statement in the brief in
the Fifth Circuit says.
QUESTION:

But isn’t an indemnitor ordinarily

subrogated to the rights of the indemnitee?

That's certainly

true in common law; I'm not familiar with maritime law.
MR. CHEAVENS:

I am not sure this issue has ever

been confronted in maritime law.

But in this instance, Mid-Gulf

did not take an assignment of the vessel’s action.
QUESTION:

Of course, subrogation operates without

regard to any formal assignment, just by virtue of having paid
off the amount, doesn't it?

Or assume the obligation to pay

it off?
MR. CHEAVENS:

That's correct.

But, of course, that

assumes, of course, in the first instance that there is a
right of contribution, which is the more general issue in the

14
case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cheavens, I am mildly confused here,

perhaps substantially confused.

Does the record show the

amount of the settlement Mid-Gulf made?
MR. CHEAVENS:

The record shows the total amount of

the judgment, and the refusal statement in the Fifth Circuit
brief says that Texas Employers is

obligated by a contract

of the indemnity to pay any judgment rendered against the
vessel.

So that they are obligated by indemnity to pay that

full judgment.
QUESTION:

You mean the record doesn’t show how much

in fact the vessel has paid the plaintiff?
MR. CHEAVENS:

Only indirectly.

The record shows

how much
QUESTION:

What was the judgment the plaintiff got?

MR. CHEAVENS:

I have forgotten the exact amount —

$33,000-odd.
QUESTION:

And that's been paid.

MR. CHEAVENS:
QUESTION:

That's been paid.

By whom?

MR. CHEAVENS:

By Texas Employers Insurance

Association.
QUESTION:

Who represent —

MR. CHEAVENS:
QUESTION s

Who insured Mid-Gulf Stevedore.

Pardon me?

15

MR. CHEAVENS:
QUESTION:

Mid-Gulf.

The vessel paid nothing?

MR, CHEAVENS:

That's correct.

The vessel got out

of the case in advance of the trial and the suit is prosecuted
only in the name of the vessel., even though Mid-Gulf did not
take an assignment of the vessel's cause of action, whatever
that cause of action may be.
QUESTION:

Well, if the court of appeals is affirmed,

who pays what to whom?
MR. CHEAVENS:

If the court of appeals is affirmed,

my client, Cooper, would be obligated to reimburse the vessel,
actually Texas Employers, for one-half of what Texas Employers
has paid.
QUESTION:

Texas Employers being Mid-Gulf's insurer,

MR. CHEAVENS:
QUESTION:

Insurer.

So nobody is going to have a windfall.

So Mid-Gulf simply gets back half of what it has paid,
MR. CHEAVENS:

That's true, but Mid-Gulf would never

even under the rule urged by respondent, would not be able to
have done that directly because it surely can't be said to
have a right of contribution against Cooper because Cooper had
no right of contribution against it.

Surely there is

mutuality.
QUESTION:

But if the court of appeals is right

below, then Cooper pays half and the vessel pays half.

16

MR. CHEAVENS:

That's correct.

Well, the vessel,

in quotes.
QUESTION;

I mean Mid-Gulf.

Do I understand, or did you tell us yesterday, that
Mid-Gulf had an indemnity agreement with the vessel?
MR. CHEAVENS:

That's correct.

In advance of trial,

Mid-Gulf took over the defense of the vessel.

Counsel were

substituted.
Let us move to the more general ■—
QUESTION;
question?

Before we move on, may I ask you a

The respondent's brief disputes your assertion that

there has already been full indemnification.

Was that issue

addressed by the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit?
MR. CHEAVENS;
of Appeals’ opinion.

It was not addressed in the Court

It was the subject of the briefs in the

Court of Appeals, and in fact it concerned I think the greater
part of the oral argument, and I think it is fair to say both
counsel were somewhat surprised that the problem was not
addressed by the Court of Appeals in its opinion.
QUESTION;

The parties are in dispute as to what the

facts are?
MR. CHEAVENS;

I don't believe that's correct.

think we are in agreement.
QUESTION;

That there was indemnification --

MR. CHEAVENS:

There was indemnification.

I

17
QUESTIONS

— in full.

MR. CHEAVENS:
QUESTION:

Is the record clear on that?

MR. CHEAVENS;
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

Yes, your Honor.

I don't want to interrupt your argument.

MR. CHEAVENSs

The record is clear.

Mr. Smith

testified to that matter at the trial of the case.

This

question, the point I am urging at this point was raised in
the district court.

Mr. Smith, the counsel appearing of

record for the vessel, previously had been counsel for the
stevedore, was called as a witness by Cooper and testified to
these matters.

It appears of record there and it appears of

record in the refusal statement filed in the Fifth Circuit
brief.
QUESTION:

What was the reason Mid-Gulf paid the

judgment recovered by the plaintiff?

Was it because it was the

insurance carrier of the stevedore which had agreed to
indemnify the vessel?
MR. CHEAVENS:

That’s correct.

The more general issue involved in the case involves
the right of contribution in admiralty generally.

For purposes

of oral argument, I would like to suggest, and I see my time
is running short, this problem be approached by seeing what
are the conceivable rules that the Court could develop here.
First, and I submit that the existing rule is that

18

the lav; draws a distinction between collision cases on the
one hand and noncollision cases on the other.

In collision

cases there is right of contribution; in noncollision cases
there is no right of contribution.

This is what the Halcyon

decision says; this was expressly reaffirmed by the Court two
years ago in the Atlantic case.

That's the current law.

The law as urged by the respondents is the opposite
end of the spectrum as embodied by the Fifth Circuit decision
in this case and in its earlier decision in Wats v. Zapata,
which is that there is a right of contribution except,generally,
except where the party against whom contribution is sought
is statutorily immune.
I would suggest that there may well be middle ground
between these two polar

positions, the middle ground being

that a right of contribution could be granted in all instances
solely where the parties' relationship was governed by the
Ryan indemnity doctrine.

Alternatively, a right of contribu­

tion could be granted either in all non-personal injury
cases or in all non-IIarbor Workers* Compensation cases.

If

I have time I would like to discuss possible rationales for
those approaches.
The first approach, that is, the existing law, the
Halcyon-Atlantic approach, may appear at first blush to be
artificial.

Why a distinction between collision and non­

collision cases?

The distinction is a sound one, and that is

lg
that collision cases which are perhaps the oldest form of
maritime litigation had well-developed rules governing these
situations long in advance of any legislative activity in the
area.

These rules even predate the 19th century activity of

this Court in the field.
On the other hand, in non-collision cases, as Justice
Black's opinion points out so clearly in the HalCYqrr case,
there is substantial legislative activity.

That legislative --

this is most pervasive in personal injury, is somewhat less
pervasive elsewhere, but is notable, for instance, in cargo
damage cases.

But all legislative activity in the field has

always stopped short of creating a right of contribution.
Traditionally contribution can only be created by the
legislatures.

Indeed, in the States which have adopted

contribution, it has almost been invariably done by legislation
as opposed to judicial enactment.
QUESTION:

Is that so in the maritime field?

I mean,

the existing law of contribution was —
MR. CHEAVENS.

Developed

judicially.

But it was

developed judicially long before any legislative activity
generally in the fields which are at dispute in this case.
those areas the legislation has never enacted contribution.
And most recently, of course, the rules were substantially
changed in 1972 amendments.

Those amendments to the

In

20
Compensation Act were enacted against the backdrop of the
Sieracki, Halcyon, Ryan, Atlantic line of decisions.

They

were carefully tailored to meet those decisions and make very
precise adjustments in the right of plaintiff versus ship
versus stevedore.
QUESTION;

Your opponents have urged that Halcyon

has never been applied broadly to just all non-collision cases„
that it only had a narrow application, that courts of appeals
have not followed, have not applied it so broadly.
the Fifth Circuit hasn't.
MR. CHEAVENS;

I know

How about the other circuits?
The Fifth Circuit applied it broadly

until the late *6Gss, and it was not until 1972 that the
Second Circuit went along.

This is a very recent phenomenon

where lower courts have felt they could disregard the Halcyon,
the clear language of Halcyon.

All during the. '50* s and the

early !60's ~
QUESTION:

Well, they didn't disregard the application

cf Halcyon to the facts very similar to Halcyon.
MRo CHEAVENS:
QUESTION:

Very dangerous here.

MR. CHEAVENS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.

1 didn't, know the perils of argument.

But you have a right of contribution.

MR. CHEAVENS:

I should hope.

The disregarding of Halcyon, is a recent phenomenon.
I don't think it's fair to restrict Halcyon to the specific

21

facts of Halcyon.

This Court simply cannot just brush to one

side the whole basis for Halcyon.

And likewise*

the Atlantic

case was a totally different situation because there the party
against whom contribution was sought was not statutorily
immune and could have been sued.
QUESTION;

Is there any indication in connection

with the '72 amendments that Congress was mindful of Halcyon
or that general, that specific area of maritime law?
MR. CHEAVENS;

I cannot recall any specific reference

in the legislative history to the Halcyon case as such.

There

are many references to Ryan, and implicit in the Congress1
consideration is that it was Ryan which was the law which
governed the relfcionships between parties and that there was
either all the way indemnity or no indemnity.
respect

a

And in this

decision here must take into account the Ryan

case because an analysis of the given fact situation under
Ryan may yield radically different results than traditional
analysis under the contribution rule, because depending on
the facts they can yield inconsistent results.
QUESTION;

You say that Congress legislated against

the background of Halcyon and on the assumption that Halcyon
applies to non-collision cases.

But when Congress finally

acted to change the rules in this area, hadn't the Fifth
Circuit already departed on its own course?
MR. CHEAVENS;

Yes, that's correct.

The Watz case

22
had been decided.

This case had not been decided.

QUESTION:

How about the Second Circuit?

MR. CIIEAVENS:

The Second Circuit case In re Seaboard

Shipping had been decided —
QUESTION:

Here were two major maritime circuits

that were construing Halcyon not to cover certain kinds of
non-collision cases.

What do you think we should do about that

in terms of what Congress intended?
MR. CIIEAVENS:

I think it's perhaps speculative

because I don't recall, at least in the legislative history,
reference to Wats or Seaboard Shipping, and I don't think it's
really fair for us to conclude one way or another about the
matter.
The rule urged by the respondent would represent, we
submit, a .radical change in the law, maritime law, and it
would be an ill-advised change.

Briefly, it would work to the

disadvantage of plaintiffs; it would discourage settlement;
it cannot be harmonized with Ryan ? the Court would be called
upon —* there is a great body of law under Ryan which would
have to be completely rearranged and changed, putting a
substantial burden on the lower courts and on this Court.
There are middle grounds which would expand
contribution slightly, but these middle grounds would be to
grant contribution in all cases save those governed by Ryan
or to grant contribution in all but personal injury cases or

23

in all but cases where the plaintiff was a beneficiary of the
Longshoremen1s and Harbor Workers' Act.
I would like to reserve my remaining time.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Smith.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE DIXIE SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SMITH:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

First, I want to address myself to the confusion that

Mr. Cheavens has created about this full indemnity.
First of all, after the plaintiff sued the steamship
company, the steamship company sued the Houston stevedore,
Mid-Gulf Stevedore, Inc., on the Ryan theory of indemnity, and
they also sued Cooper Stevedoring Company in Mobile on a similar
type case but for two separate breaches of what the ship felt
like was a breach of the implied Ryan warranty running to the
vessel:

One, the negligence in the way the vessel was loaded

in Mobile, which is entirely separate cause of action that the
ship had against the Mobile stevedore, and they also had a
separate cause of action against the Houston stevedore.
My firm represented the Houston Mid-Gulf Stevedore.
Prior to trial we negotiated out of settlement with our
differences with the vessel.

And as part of the settlement

agreement of that cause of action, we assumed the defense of
the vessel.

There has been nothing in evidence ever about what

24

the real, exact terms of the settlement was. This is the first
time this ever came up.

Cooper filed no cross actions against

us, although they were free to do so.

They are not statutorily

immune, or were not statutorily immune from being sued by
another stevedore, and this has happened.

But they didn't sue

us.
During the trial, Mr. Harmon, the trial attorney for
Cooper, put me on the stand quite by surprise and asked me
about the terms of the settlement agreement.
even make them.

Well, I didn't

The attorney that was handling the case before

I got it is the one that worked out the settlement with the
ship.
since,

I just went in to try the case and I've handled it
But at the time I didn't know exactly what the terras

were; I had a general idea.

But part of the terms of the

agreement was that we would indemnify, we took over the
defense of the vessel as the vessel.

We stepped in the shoes

of the vessel, and then dismissed ourselves out of the case
and proceeded on and just plaintiff against the ship against
the Mobile stevedore,

And that is the way the case has come

up, and the legal issues involved should be determined on
that point.
This can be a very important case, and I think Mr.
Cheavens has done a good job to kind of confuse the matter.
QUESTION;
much money?

Mr. Smith, what were you suing for, how

25
MR. SMITH:

Well, we were pursuing the ship's claim

against Cooper for whatever we might have to pay the plaintiff
if we lost on the basic suit of the plaintiff against the ship.
QUESTION:

You didn't have any idea that it was

$38,000?
MR. SMITH:

No, not at that time.

That's the way these cases developed, Mr. Justice
Marshall.

The plaintiff sued
QUESTION:

At that stage would you have settled for

$5,000?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No.
You wouldn't settle for less than $38,000,

would you?
MR. SMITH:

Mo, sir.

I thought in the court's

findings, it found that the Mobile stevedore breached its
warranty of workmanlike service to the vessel, and under the
Ryan cases, I think we are entitled to full indemnity and thought
so at the time.
But we went ahead and tried the case after the
agreement between the Houston stevedore and the ship was
negotiated.

Then we went on to trial to try the case just as

we normally do with all three parties being present and fighting
it out among ourselves.
But it's interesting to see, to get back to what the
court actually found in the case, that they found that Cooper

26

was negligent in the way they loaded the ship in Mobile, that
as a result of the negligence of Cooper the way they loaded
the ship, they breached their Ryan warranty of workmanlike
service.

The court seemed to find that the ship was negligent,

too, in not discovering the negligence of Cooper, is about the
best way you can read the court's finding.

But the court did

not find that the ship was precluded from indemnity and in
fact just ignored our claim for indemnity under the Ryan
doctrine and just announced he was going to split the damages
50-50

Very standard, really a simple situation

when you look at it in the right perspective.
Nov;, the Fifth Circuit ~ we argue the Fifth Circuit
affirmed the district court, affirmed that the stevedore was
negligent, that it breached its warranty, and affirmed that
50 percent contribution, and more or less assumed in its opinion

28

that the stevedore — the ship was precluded from full
indemnity because the judge didn't give it to us.

There is

no fact-finding, there is no really evidence anywhere in the
case that the ship was precluded from recovery of full
indemnity? it has just been something that has been ignored.

They gave us 50
We paid off the

plaintiff and now we are asking —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

No attorneys' fee.

You got half —

Well, they didn't address themselves to

attorneys' fees.
Normally the way we handle that, Judge, is normally
in this type of situation if we get full indemnity, we usually
agree on the attorneys’ fees between the parties and then if

29
we can’t agree to it*, we go back to the district court and he
awards it.

We usually work these things out.
But our case is up here, and Mr. Cheavens has asked

you to, I think, take a limited approach the iray you decide
this case.

As I see it, the Court can take a limited view and

they can affirm the case and say there is contribution in this
fact situation.

But this leaves, I think, as Mr. Cheavens

pointed out, some conflicts that are going to cause some
trouble in some of the district courts.
You could reverse this case and just hold that under
Halcyon there will be no contribution in any non-maritirae
situation — non-collision maritime situation.

I think this

would be a horrible thing to do because for reasons I will get
into.

I think it would make the lav; a lot more confused and

a lot more arbitrary than it is now.
Or you can take a third solution to the case, and. I
think kind of leave the law exactly like it is.

You can decide

on the fact-findings that I was entitled to full indemnity and
just under Ryan give me full indemnity.

But that won't

change the law. It leaves it exactly where it is today.

And

I don't think the Court granted a writ in this case to do that.
Now, I am going to suggest a rather bold, sweeping
approach that the Court can clear up this whole area for
generations to come,
broad standpoint

if you will look at the case from a

30

Now, before I get to what I am going to suggest, I
would like to review historically the law in this field.

In

1946 this Court passed the Sieracki opinion which in effect
granted the right of the doctrine of unseaworthiness to cover
longshoremen.

Longshoremen could sue vessels for an unsea­

worthy condition which amounts to almost absolute liability
without fault.

As a result, after the Sieracki opinion, the

longshoremen around the country started suing the vessel
owners and recovering substantial amounts of money.
was beginning to get out of hand.

And it

And in 1952, the steamship

company in the Halcyon case sued the stevedore that caused
the unseaworthy condition and. started to get some relief.
They thought if was kind of unjust that the stevedore could
go on board and create an unseaworthy condition and then the
steamship company has to pay for it.
So the Court took the case under review, but because
of the statutory immunity of the stevedore, denied the right
of the ship to collect contribution in the Halcyon case.
QUESTION;

Of course, they didn't say in so many

words they were denying it because of the statutory immunity,
did they?
MR. SMITH:

Well, it's in the opinion that section 5

of the Act — and then there is a lot of dictum in the case.
That * s why I think there is so much trouble as what Halcyon
really means.

31

But anyway, they didn't let the ship collect
contribution against the stevedore.

And then things really

got into high gear until 1956 when the Court handed down
Ryan.

It didn't address itself to the contribution issue, but

came up with this warranty of workmanlike service theory
to grant full indemnity.

So where the man's employer, the

stevedore employer, breaks this heretofore unknown warranty,
that somehow it was a contractual theory and a negligence
lawsuit, then it got to be 100 percent.
to pay 100 percent or the stevedore did.
it has gone since then.
even further;

The ship either had
And this is the way

In Yaka in 1963, you extended it

Then in 1964, you backed off a little bit with the

Italia decision to where the ship was guilty of such conduct
sufficient to preclude, then the stevedore wouldn't have to
pay 100 percent even if it breaks its warranty.
But here again, both ways, because of the Ryan case
which in effect came about because of the Sieracki opinion,
you have got two parties many times equally at fault or both
at fault, one of them having to pay all the money.

And it's

inequitable; it has been criticised by many courts, by many
scholars, and it got so bad that in 1972 Congress drastically
amended the Longshoremen's Act.
One of the things they did was that they took away
the longshoremen's right to sue the ship for unseaworthiness.
This in effect overruled the Sieracki opinion that -ame down

32

ia 1946,
Number two, they said that section 5 of the Act
means what it says, that the steamship company can’t sue the
employer either for implied warranty or expressed warranty.
Even if they contract that they can sue them, they can’t do it.
This, in effect, overruled Ryan as it applied to the injured
man's employer which was what Ryan came out of, that particular
fact situation.

So amendments to the 1972 Act effectively

reversed two prior leading cases that had caused all this,
Sieracki and Ryan.
QUESTION?

Neither of those amendments affect the

situation here.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No, sir, they don't.
Because the vessel was found to be

negligent in addition to being unseaworthy, and also because
Cooper Stevedoring is not the employer of the injured man.
MR, SMITH:

That's right, and even if this accident,

happened today.
QUESTION:

Right.

We would still have the same

problem.
MR. SMITH:

We would still have the same situation.

This is what I am getting at.

The ship can still sue Cooper

Stevedoring Company if the accident happened today.

They

could sue Cooper tomorrow for a breach of a Ryan warranty
of a stevedore that is not the employer.

And Ryan wasn’t

33

intended to come up that way anyway.
What I am going to suggest that this Court do is
go ahead and abolish Ryan completely-»

Congress has done so

drastically where the situation applies most of the time
anyway between the employer,, the injured longshoreman, and the
ship.

But Ryan also has been spread over to cover particularly

in the Fifth Circuit area where we have so much offshore
activity in maritime situations, that Ryan has been applied
and not applied in so many of these other situations where it
doesn’t fit.
QUESTIONs

But here what you are asking us to do is

to completely overrule a case that was just tailored by
Congress two years ago?
MR. SMITH?

No, Congress I think effectively over-

ruled the original Ryan opinion in the context in which it
arose.
QUESTION:

But isn’t that a rather strong implication

that Congress in reviewing this situation wanted it overruled
in that area but left standing where it would apply otherwise?
MR. SMITH:

Well, that's a very, very broad

thing for Congress to do.

I think this Court created the

problem, and I think it's best that this Court under the
historical context, that this Court ought to step in and
correct it.
QUESTION:

You say it’s a very broad thing

for

34
Congress to do.

Surely, it’s an even broader thing for this

Court to do.
MR. SMITHs

Well, not in the law the law is set up

now with the amendments to the Longshoremen's Act, cutting
out or doing away with Ryan in a big portion of the cases.
You are going to have Ryan not applied .in most of the cases
where it was and then still applying in some other cases where
it wasn't intended.
QUESTION;

Well, my brother Rehnquist has just

suggested that the inference would be that that is precisely
what Congress intended when they looked at this problem in
1972 and amended the Act and cut down on Ryan pro tonto, to
the extent they wanted to cut down on it.
MR. SMITH;

Well, Justice Stewart, I don’t believe

the legislative history would indicate that there were a lot
of maritime interests that this Ryan case could or could not
affect were present and negotiated the amendments to the Act.
The stevedoring companies, the steamship companies, and the
labor unions were the ones that hammered this out with
Congress.

There are a lot of other interests that are

affected by Ryan that I don’t think were considered, and I
don’t think they were trying to correct Ryan in every
possibility that it —
QUESTION;

Can you suggest any possible reason for

leaving Ryan in effect where negligence is at issue but not

35

uns eaworthines s ?
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:

No, sir.

That’s my next point.

You think it must have been then just

an oversight or just bad legislating if they took care of the
seaworthiness thing but didn't reach the negligence?
MR. SMITH:
did this on purpose.

No, sir.

That's what's covered.

They

There was the steamship industry pushed

very strongly to do away with all third-party suits by
longshoremen against vessels for unseaworthiness or
negligence.

And Congress and the Department of Labor

expressly rejected this because of the policy they wanted to
encourage steamship companies to come in with safe ships.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

All right.
And if they were to —
We're not talking about ship liability,

we are talking about indemnity.

They did away with the

indemnity on unseaworthiness.
MR. SMITH:

Indemnity as to the employer.

QUESTION:

Altogether, unseaworthiness or negligence.

MR. SMITH:

Well, you can't sue for unseaworthiness.

All the steamship companies have got to worry about now is
a regular negligence case.
QUESTION:

There is no Ryan indemnity left after

the '72 amendments except against the non-employer, isn't that
right?

36

MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

And I think to make —

Except for negligence.
I think the steamship company can sue

any other negligent third party that has caused his own.
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

But that's not Ryan indemnity.
No.

But what I am saying is I think

that since the plaintiff can sue the ship for negligence
and the plaintiff's case is governed by comparative negligence,
that if he is 30 percent at fault, his damages are reduced
thereby.

All right, ha no longer has an unseaworthiness remedy.

Then go ahead to allow contribution

or comparative negligence

between the ship or anybody else that the ship may sue or the
plaintiff may sue.

In this case it's conceivable that the

plaintiff could have sued Cooper directly, so he could have,
gotten a judgment directly against him.

The judge could have

found that we were both at fault and awarded a 50 percent
judgment against Cooper and a 50 percent judgment against the
ship.

It could have done that, but it just didn’t choose to

do it.
What I am suggesting is to go ahead and put it in
the three party suits or" in this whole area of maritime
personal injury law, put it on a comparative negligence basis,
let the plaintiff sue anybody he thinks is at fault on the
negligence theory,comparative negligence as far as contrib. goes.
And as to the negligence or the fault of the co-tort-feasors.

37
let them all pay their fair share.

If you have got two or

more people —•
QUESTION:

That would

...

both Halcyon and Ryanf

wouldn’t it, since one said there is no right of contribution
and the other said there is an absolute liability on a warranty.
MR. SMITH;

That's why you have got this bad conflict.

Congress came back in 1972 and says that the employer will be
immune because of his payments of compensation, they upped the
benefits substantially, and that's all the employer is going
to have to pay.
Now, among other guilty parties, I think the plaintiff
is free to sue anybody he wants to.

And they should be able to

sue themselves or each other on a comparative basis.

And

since there is no more Ryan warranty to the employer, there
ought not to be a Ryan warranty to anybody else.

And these

other situations of where does Ryan apply and where doesn't it
apply has really muddied the water.
QUESTION;
the opinion?

Mr. Smith, how do we explain that in

We say that Congress went half of the way and

refused to go the other half of the way, so we will go the other
half of the way?

Is that the way we explain it?

MR. SMITH;

Yes, sir.

The Moran case, you ruled

standing authority that there was no cause of action in
\

maritime lav;.

You just said you overruled in that decision and

went ahead and did it.

38

QUESTION;
MR. SMITH;

Well, here we overrule Congress.
No, you will not overrule Congress.

You are corning in following Congress' lead.
QUESTION;

Congress said as of now, this is as far

as we want to go, as far as we intend to go.

And we say, well,

since you didn't go, we will goMR. SMITH:

Well, in uniformity and fairness,

everybody agrees this. 100 percent indemnity theory is unjust
and Congress thought so because they did away with it in that
situation.
QUESTION:

It boils down to the proposition you are

really asking us to tidy up and finish up the legislative job
that Congress began but didn't complete.
MS. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

Exactly.

QUESTION:

I thought that's what it sounded like.

MR. SMITH:

It's what I have been trying to say.

QUESTION;

It may or may not be unjust and it may

or may not have been criticized by the commentaries and so on.

it and perhaps even written it many times,

And the

important thing is to know what the rules are, isn't it, and
not keep changing them all the time, even though the rules
are unsyxnmetrical or in a perfect world inequitable.

But

nonetheless, the insurance arrangements are made? it's important

39

that there be certainty, is it not?
MR. SMITH;

Yes, sir.

I think there would still be

just as much certainty here? there would be a lot more justice
in that those that —
QUESTION;

Well, the public pays the bill in the end

anyway and, as we all know, through insurance.

If the

correct?
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION:

Justice Steitfart

-

Halcyon and Ryan have been on the books a

long time and now we have the action of Congress in 1972 which
changed the rules of the game somewhat, but now those are the
rules of the game, and shipowners and stevedores and so on
should be able to make their arrangements with their liability
insurers accordingly, shouldn't they?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, but insurance companies are

entitled to justice just like anybody else.
QUESTION:
doesn't it?

Well, it works out the same in the end,

I say, we nearly all agree that society pays for

these injuries one way or another.
MR. SMITH:

Yes, but I think we ought to make the

guilty pay for the injuries they do and not encourage —QUESTION:

What do you do with the Atlantic case,

incidentally?
MR. SMITH:

Nothing.

QUESTION:
MR, SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

Wall, how do you explain it?
Well, it’s on the same points as Halcyon.
It's against it.
No,, sir, it's not.

That man was paid —

the Atlantic case, they got into trial and almost through
trial before they even knew there was a maritime question.
QUESTION:

Well, but by the time the case came here,

the question was exposed.
MR. SMITH:

In the briefs of his employer, he was

paid Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation benefits,
section 5 of the Act applied? they pled it, they argued it
in their briefs, and under the Halcyon situation where the
employer has paid his compensation under the Federal Act,
there is no conflict at all.

The employer was immune from

contribution.
QUESTION:

Aren't you going much farther than you

have to to win this case?
MR. SMITHs
QUESTION:

Yes, sir,
You are urging us to affirm this judgment

on another, much broader ground.
MR. SMITH: Yes, sir.
QUESTION:

You could prevail by just going with the

Fifth Circuit.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
You don't need to overrule, urge us to

41
overrule Halcyon and Ryan cases.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

No.

Need you do that?

First of all, I am not —

The question is right now if the judgment

below is reversed, we are changing the lav; of two circuits,
aren’t we?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Because in the Second and the Fifth

Circuits Halcyon has been laid to rest in a certain way.
MR. SMITH;
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, distinguished very ...
I suppose you would rather win than lose.
Oh, yes, sir.
Tell me, Mr. Smith, you said the '72

amendments make unenforceable even an explicit indemnity
provision as between employer and shipowner.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
And vet didn’t you tell us that your

former client, Mid-Gulf, made a settlement with the ship?
What was that?

A settlement of what?

A Ryan indemnity, or

what?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

This was before the '12 amendments.
All right.

That's the answer.

We were faced with a Ryan indemnity.
Had this happened after the statute, there

would have been no settlement obviosuly.
MR. SMITH:

No, sir

We would be immune.

We could

42

sit back and watch.
QUESTION: You would still be here, though, probably,
wouldn’t you?
MR. SMITH:

Well —

QUESTION;

No.

QUESTION:

Do the amendments expressly apply only

prospectively, or what?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir.

They "went into effect in the

last part of November 1972.
QUESTION:

I know, but did they have a specific

provision as to whether those .standards would apply in pending
legislation or not, pending litigation?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir.

I have tried a number of

cases since that act was amended, but the actions that happened
before, and we handled them all the way through under the old
Ryan warranty.
QUESTION:

I take it, Mr. Smith, had they been

effective, the ship probably would still be here, but you
would be talking for it.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Well, probably not, but —
As I understood you, you are here for the

ship only because you stepped into the ship’s shoes after
Mid-Gulf paid off.
MR. SMITH:
Brennan.

That’s right.

That's right, Justice

43

QUESTION:

But if the amendments had applied, you

wouldn't have had to pay off.
MR. SMITH:

But addressing myself back to Justice

White's question, contribution, the general theory behind it,
is that joint tort-feasors ought to pay their part of the
wrong that they caused in injuring somebody.

And there is

just no logical reason in a non-collision maritime situation
where you don't have an employer involved, as we don't have
here, is why if the plaintiff just chooses to sue one of them,
why they can't sue a co-tort-feasor, one or more, and divide
the damages as they are proven up.

I just don't think it's

fair or just or equitable that you have — and particularly
where you have contribution in so many other areas of tort

lav/ — to single out maritime law and just say we won't have
it.
QUESTION:

Let's assume we agreed with you that

Halcyon should not be read as preventing contribution on these
facts, in this kind of a situation.

Are you also urging that

there should be a different rule of contribution than 50-50?
MR. SMITH:

No, sir, I think where you have got

two eo-tort-feasors, if you have contribution, it's 50-50?
if you have three —
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:
if

You aren’t urging comparative negligence.
I think comparative negligence would be,

negligence would be the more equitable way to do it.
QUESTION:

But the maritime collision rule is 50-50

no matter what.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

It was divided damages rule, but —
Is that what the Fifth Circuit applied

in this case?
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:
MR. SMITH:

No.

No.

They didn't even mention the

So it’s comparative.
Wall, Judge Singleton, the district

court judge, said, "I am going to find you both equally at
fault, 50-50,"

So that's what he did and the Fifth Circuit

affirmed.
QUESTION:

But in a collision case, all he would

have had to find was some fault on both sides.
MR. SMITH:
QUESTION:

Mutual fault.
And it would have been an automatic

50-50.
MR. SMITH:

Where you add up all the damages and

divide them by half and the one who is the least damaged
pays —•
QUESTION:

And in ordinary tort lav;, apart from

maritime on tort lav;, it's 50-50, isn’t it?
MR. SMITH:

Yes, between two co-tort-feasors.

QUESTION:

If they are both co-tort-feasors.

MR. SMITH:

Yes, sir, 50-50.

If there are three,

45
they divide it in thirds.
This case can be a far-reaching one, it can be
limited.

7. have 1 know suggested something that you probably

didn't expect.

But I think if you give this consideration

and at least, your Honors, please affirm this case as to
contribution anyway, but I think this could be a very dynamic
case in the annals of this whole area of law, if you take thi
one step further, or at least give it some consideration.
QUESTION:

1 think any time we amend an act of

Congress, it will be very dynamic.
MR. SMITH:

Justice Marshall, you will not be amend

ing an Act of Congress.
QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. SMITH;

No, sir, you would be just kind of

dove-tailing and following along behind it.
QUESTION:

Going where they wouldn't go.

MR. SMITH:

No, sir, just going on in areas they

pointed out but didn't quite go that far.
Thank you very much.

This is the common law

They are legislative because they vitally affect

amongst others the rights of injured plaintiffs.

If there is

one category of people, Mr. Justice Stewart, who cannot be
adjusted, whose rights cannot be adjusted by insurance, it is
the plaintiff, the injured plaintiff.

And as Professor James

points out, a .rule of contribution severely restricts the
plaintiff's rights.

About one-third of the States -— well,

first, the States are closely divided on the merits of
legislation.

I refer your Honors to the Yale Law Review

article which analyzes the different State rules.
