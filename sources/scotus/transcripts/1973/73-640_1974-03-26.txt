MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-640, Geduldig against Aiello.
Mrs. Condas,you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JOANNE CONDAS,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MRS. CONDAS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case is here, brought by California, on appeal
from the decision of a three-judge court holding unconstitu­
tional the exclusion of section 2626 of the California
Unemployment Insurance Code, which excludes pregnancy from
coverage under the disability insurance program.
The cost impact of this decision is estimated to be
a minimum of $120 million annually, based on the current level
of operations of the disability fund.
The question we present to this Court is whether
\

a State can establish a disability insurance program which
compensates wage loss from illness and injury but not for
normal pregnancy without violating the equal protection or
due process clauses of the Constitution, when there is neither
discriminator^' intent in the creation of the fund nor
discriminatory impact in its operation.
In order for the Court to understand how this case
arises, I'd like just very briefly to describe how the fund

4
was originated and developed.
In 1946, California became the second State to adopt
a disability insurance program.

This was primarily because

during the Second World War enormous surpluses had built up
in the Unemployment Insurance Fund in California, because
there was virtually no unemployment during the war years.
And the Governor proposed that the one percent which
employees had to contribute to that fund should be shifted
to provide disability insurance instead, and the Governor, in
his message, explained why he thought the one percent should
be the figure and why, since it was coming from employees, it
should be kept low.
That is, that an employer can always pass along
whatever is charged to him in terms of the cost of doing his
business, in terms of providing a service or costs of goods;
but to an employee there is no one else to pass the charge,
and as to him it amounts to a gross income tax.
It should be borne in mind, of course, that there
is no employer contribution to this particular fund.

That

was an illustrative example only.
Well, the disability insurance program has been
financed within the limits of that one percent, and this was
accomplished primarily as a result of incorporating certain
features in the California plan that were different from the
Rhode Island plan, which was the only model that California

5
had to go by at that time.
Rhode Island had begun paying benefits in 1943, and
by 1946, in the middle of the year, they had, gone from a
$2.7 billion surplus to a $1.5 million deficit.

And there

were primarily two factors, omissions, really, from the Rhode
Island plan that accounted for this financial problem.
The first was that they had not provided for the
prevention of double recovery.

It was possible under the

Rhode Island plan to recover both Workmen's Compensation
Disability and Unemployment Disability for the same illness.
7und, secondly, they had included pregnancy coverage.
Pregnancy benefits posed the larger problem for
Rhode Island, and really amounted to more than twice what was
paid for the Workmen's Compensation duplication.
The California plan made changes in both of those
features.

Section 2929 ----- pardon me, 2629 of the California

Unemployed Insurance Code prevents the double recovery, and
section 2626 excluded normal — excluded pregnancy until 23
days after the termination of pregnancy.
Now, the reason I used that in the past tense is
that last year that section was amended, and it now provides
for coverage for complications of pregnancy? instead of the
exclusion.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Condas, you told us about the Rhode

Island experience and the fact that Rhode Island was the first

6
State to have any such plan as this and California the second.
There are nov?, what, a total of five States or six?
MRS. CONDAS;

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

Would you

like an explanation of idle five States?
QUESTION; Well, I just wondered if any of the States
that now have the plan do provide maternity benefits,
currently?
MRS. CONDAS;

Yes, currently, perhaps the best

example of the potential problems that we’re discussing is
the State of Hawaii.

And Hawaii, in May, amended its lav/ to

provide coverage for pregnancy.
The situation there is that premiums for man
employees have remained $3.25 per employee per month.

The

rate for women was always a little higher, and this simply is
standard in the disability insurance field.

The rate for

women was four dollars per female per month.
QUESTION;

It doesn't go on a percentage out there,

it's a fixed sum in dollars?
MRS. CONDAS;

It's a disability insurance premium

charge.
QUESTION: Right.
MRS. CONDAS;

And, as a matter of fact, all but a

certain base period, as California has a limitation on what
the employee can be charged,
QUES TION;

Unh-hunh.

7
MRS. CONDAS;

— Hawaii has a limitation on what

the employee can be charged.

And so the increase in cost in

Hawaii will be picked up by a charge to employers.
But that charge is enormous.

As I say, in the case

of men the rate has not changed, it's $3.25 per man per month;
for a woman it’s gone from $4.00 per woman per month to
$8.76 per woman per month.
And the only thing that has changed is 'the inclusion
of pregnancy.
I might also mention that Mew Jersey provides a
maximum of eight weeks of benefits:
and four weeks after birth.

four weeks before birth

That's the maximum.

And the

New Jersey experience is that between 49 and 57 percent of
its funds go to pay for pregnancy benefits»
QUESTION:

And those two States do pay for pregnancy

do any of the other three -- or California — what are
there, a total of five?
MRS. CONDAS:
QUESTION;

Yes.

So that leaves two others.

MRS. CONDAS:

Yes.

I beg your pardon.

I am somewhat uncertain as to the

but their Human Rights Commission has required employers to

QUESTION:

As sick leave, illness or injury.

MRS. CONDAS:
QUESTION;

Yes.

Unh-hunh.

MRS. CONDAS;

And I don’t know enough about the

details of the plan to know just what financial impact that
i

has, ultimately.
Well, California incorporated the features that it
could from Rhode Island, in order to enable it to carry out
an essential purpose to the fund.

And the essential purpose

to tiie California disability plan is to provide, at low cost,
a fund which provides benefits having significant levels of
benefits.

They've always been a fairly healthy wage

continuation.

And to provide broad coverage, to help as many

employees as could be helped.
The plan pays out virtually all of its income in
benefits.

In the past five years, for example, the ratio or

pay-out to benefits has been 90 percent -— in the range of
90 percent of income to 103 percent of income.
The plan provides for comprehensive benefits, as

9

I've indicated, but it does contain actually three exclusions
one is

and they're all based on the inordinately high

cost of providing them, based on actuarial standards common
in the insurance industry.
The first is the short-term disability.

Unless you

have a waiting period of some duration, you're just swamped
with small claims.

So there's an exclusion of any disbility

which lasts less than eight days.
QUESTION:

Unless the person's in the hospital,

isn't that correct?
MRS. CONDAS:

That’s correct.

The second exclusion is the disability -that endures
more than 26 weeks.
hospital or not.

That doesn't matter whether he's in the

That's simply the maximum benefits allow­

able.
The third one is the pregnancy exclusion,
As I've indicated, the experience of the California
fund is much like that of the disability insurance industry
generally.

It soon became apparent that it did result in

women deriving substantially more benefits than men.

This

results primarily because we do have -the flat rate.
And so when you have a situation in which you
charge people a flat rate, and you have the standard in the
insurance industry that women file more disability claims,
the impact of that is that women derive substantially more

10
benefits than they make contributions.
QUESTION;

Well, it's a flat percentage, isn't it,

rather than a flat rate?
MRS, CONDAS: Well, it's a flat rate of one percent.
QUESTION:

One percent?

MRS. CONDAS:
QUESTION:

Yes.

I was wondering if what you've just

described might be a function of the lower wage levels for
women.

They pay in less, therefore, and even then assuming

they got the same benefits as a man did, they would get
greater proportionate benefits.
MRS, CONDAS;

Well, our brief includes some charts.

One is affixed to the affidavit of an actuary, William Smith,
who is not an employee of the agency here, which shows that
the claim rate, reg'ardless of the income level, the claim
rate is higher in the case of women.
QUESTION;

In absolute terms.

MRS. CONDAS:

In absolute terms.

And we also have that confirmed by figures from our
own fund.

The claim rate at every income level is greater.

Indeed, we discovered recently that perhaps the highest claim
filing rate of all is women who make in excess of $10,000.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

MRS. CONDAS:
fund

Well, that's the background of the

11
The background of this litigation is that there
were two suits;

One brought in the Federal District Courti

the other brought in the California Supreme Court, by
petition for writ of mandate.
Both alleged that the exclusion of pregnancy
amounted to a denial of equal protection.
But since the California court had already ruled
on the constitutionality of its statute, in a case called
Clark vs. California.Stabilization Commission, the cases were
transferred and consolidated in federal court.

A three-judge

court was convened, and the matter was heard on cross motions
for summary judgment.
Now, I want to make one point from the California
case, because I think its key, in terms of what we see as
the rationale for exclusion of pregnancy.

In the Clark case,

the State court said that the Legislature was entitled to
consider, quote, "whether the objects

of the statute would

be best served by including a disability benefit which
reasonably might impose-upon a majority of the employees a
burden disproportionate to contemplated benefits, in order to
favor the minority who are included within th~ classified
group."
In other words, the court was concerned that the
pregnancy benefits would result in a disproportionate amount
of benefits going to a sub-group.

And that is exactly

what

12
has happened in other States# and it's exactly what we predict
will happen in California.
The federal court, the federal three-judge court
equated the classification of pregnancy as one based on sex#
and held that it denied, equal protection to pregnant women#
and also held that pregnancy benefits could not be excluded
simply on the basis of cost.
As we’ve indicated# it's not simply cost# it's the
combination of factors that make up the California plan.
The cost# the broad coverage# and the significant level of
benefits that it's desired to maintain.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Condas# are there any exclusions

in your plan for particular diseases at all?
MRS. CONDAS:

Mr* Justice Blackmun, there are none

that I'm aware of# except that# for example, in tine case of a
diabetic or a person with renal failure# who has to go in the
hospital once a week or who has an intermittent disease.
In effect# his disease is excluded because he never has a
disability period that goes for eight days# but he may be
critically ill and get no disability compensation at all.
QUESTION:

Now, most private plans do have disease

exclusions, do they not?
problems.

I'm thinking mainly of psychiatric

Or am I wrong in this?
MRS. CONDAS:

private plans.

I have not made a very deep study of

I know that there are various combinations of

13
exclusions, which I would like to point out are generally
based on premium cost.

I think perhaps one can get almost

any kind of health coverage he wants on a private insurance
basis, provided he is willing to pay the cost of obtaining
that coverage.

And I believe that

QUESTION:

But doesn't California exclude drug

addiction, for example?
MRS, CONDAS:

Well, there is this one Code section

which deals with dypsomania, drug addiction, and sexual
psychopaths,
QUESTION: So you do have some exclusions.
MRS, CONDAS:

Well, except that it requires that

they be under court commitraent, —
QUESTION:

I see.

MRS. CONDAS:
practice.

— and that’s a fairly archaic

Those provisions are still in the law, but it

would be unrealistic to say that they constitute valid
exclusions,
QUESTION:

So, absent court commi foment, they are

covered.
MRS. CONDAS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

Unh-hunh.

MRS. CONDAS:

Although the issue in all of the

briefs has been discussed in terms of the sex-limited
characteristic, the California plan covers any kind of sex-

14
limited disability, of either sex, with the exception of
pregnancy.
So that what this case boils down to is the question
of what provision of the United States Constitution compels
us to include pregnancy in our disability insurance plan.
We say, California says that the equal protection
doesn’t compel it, because the equal protection clause
requires another class similarly situated.

And the majority

below acknowledged that pregnancy is unique and that no one
is situated similarly to a pregnant woman.
Judge Williams, in dissent below, had difficulty
finding any equal protection factors involved here, on the
basis that women derive significantly more benefit from the
operation of the program than men do.

They contribute only

28 percent of the withholdings, and they draw 38 percent of
the benefit payments.
Now, whether you wish to attribute that to lower pay
for women or not, it’s apparent that there is no disparate
impact in the operation of this fund upon women.
This Court did not treat the pregnancy question
before it recently in Chesterfield Board of Education vs. ,
LaPleur, in the equal protection context.

It rather based

its decision on due process considerations, and that's the
test that we urge the Court to adopt here.
It’s California's contention that we have a valid

15
State interest in maintaining the solvency of this insurance
program,, and also in providing comprehensive benefits to the
maximum number of workers who can be served.
This Court has said that in the area of economics
and social welfare legislation that the Court will just the
relationship of the means and ends on the rational basis
test*
If the Court is willing to do that, I would like to
discuss the five factors which, in combination, we believe
amply justify the exclusion of pregnancy.
Certainly, questions could be raised and qualifica­
tions made on any one of these factors individually.

It's

the combination of factors which California urges requires
the exclusion.
The first is the relative cost factor.
> •

The second is that the condition of pregnancy is

generally, voluntary, and subject to planning.
The third is that pregnancy disabiliti.es have a
significantly longer duration.
The fourth is that treating physicians apply a
different medical standard.
And finally, the fifth, that there is a major
difference in the re turn-to-wo rk rate following disability
from pregnancy.
First, in terms of the relative cost, the majority

16
of the three-judge court accepted the appellant's estimate
that pregnancy benefits would add 40 percent tc the operation
of this plan.

It simply regarded that increase as irrelevant.

As I've indicated, the experience of New Jersey is
that it costs even more than that, in terms of half of their
benefits, approximately, going to pay complications and
benefits of one category of disease»
This cost estimate is also consistent with a joint
statement filed with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance
on February 11th, 1974, by the Health Insurance Association of
America and the American Life Insurance Association,

This

group represents 500 insurance companies who, together, write
90 percent of the health insurance in the United States*
And in that joint statement, they indicate that
for an employer providing a typical disability income plan —
this is not just medical benefits while you're in the hospital
this is the income protection kind of plan — that covering
pregnancy would add between 40 and 50 percent to the cost*
I have already given you the impact in terms of
what it has done to Hawaii *
I would also note with regard to the voluntariness
of pregnancy, that the appellees have conceded that most
births are desired.
On the other hand, the disability fund which
compensates for illness and injuries involves misfortunes and

17
accidents, and the kind of thing, disease and accident are
the kinds of things which no one ever desires.

And because

of that basic distinction in the desirability and the
voluntariness of the condition, there is a significantly
greater incidence of planned use of the program.
While it's true you may put off a cataract operation
until next year, so, to that extent, you could plan the
timing,* you certainly can't plan not to have a cataract.
That's something which befalls you.
QUESTION: What about cosmetic surgery?
MRS. CONDAS:

We conducted a brief study which

indicates that this is truly a de minimis proposition.

It's

the kind —
QUESTION: Even in California?
[Laughter.]
MRS* CONDAS.

Even in California.

At least during

the three months that were surveyed, November through
February of this past period, a three-month survey was made
of all disability claims, and it was found that 0.12 percent
of all claims filed were for purely cosmetic surgery and
85.5 percent of those claims ware filed by women,,
QUESTION:

Of course, I suppose some of those

would run into your short-term disability proposition, anyway.
MRS. CONDAS:

Well, these were claims that were

filed, so they would have to be either for hospitalization

13
benefits, in which there is not the seven-day exclusion, or
for disabilities that ran into the eighth day.
QUESTION;

Mrs. Condas, before you sit down, some

of these original plaintiffs have been fully paid off after
your interim decision in the State court, haven't they?
MRS. CONDAS:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

QUESTION: So that, so far as they are concerned,
the case is moot?
MRS. CONDAS:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

The only claimant

alive, in effect, is Mrs,. Jaramillo, whose claim would be
for a normal pregnancy disability.
I should like to reserve whatever time there is
remaining to me for rebuttal,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mrs• Williams.
OPAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. WENDY W. WILLIAMS,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MRS. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is not as appellant states,
whether ’women should receive benefits for normal pregnancy
under California's disability insurance program.
We do not and could not contend that pregnancy
itself is a medical disability.
Rather, the issue in this case is whether a denial

19
of benefits to otherwise qualified workers is justified
solely becatise their illn ess or injury arises from normal
pregnancy and childbirth.
The purpose of the California disability program is
to compensate in part for wage lost because of sickness or
injury and to reduce to a minimum the suffering caused by
the resulting unemployraent.
In carrying out

the program’s liberal purposes,.

California compensates every conceivable disability without
regard to its voluntariness, uniqueness, predictability, or
cost.
Thus the program compensates workers disabled by
costly disabilities, such as heart attacks, sex and race
unique disabilities, such as prostatectomies or sickle-cell
anemia? voluntary disabilities such as cosmetic surgery,
sterilization, or orthodontia? and pre-existing conditions
which will inevitably result in disability such as degenera­
tive arthritis or cataract operations.
QUESTION:
feminine conditions:

But it also covers, on peculiarly
hysterectomy, —

MRS. WILLIAMS:
QUESTION;

That's correct, yes.

— maste ctomy«,

MRS. WILLIAMS:

The sole exclusion under the

program is the exclusion for pregnancy and birth-related
disabilities.

20
QUESTION: But does it or does it not cover voluntary
abortion?
MRS. WILLIAMS:

There's some question under the new

statute whether it does or does not cover abortions.
Apparently, as I read that statute, it covers non-voluntary
abortions, medically

indicated abortions, but does not

cover voluntary abortions.
That raises an interesting point, which is that when
a woman chooses to have a child and she's a California worker,
or when she chooses to have an abortion and she's a California
worker, she is not covered in either case by the California
program.

And I think this raises some question under the

recent Roe and Doe decisions of this Court,
QUESTION: Well, of course, her choice is not final
in the abortion aspect.

Is this not correct?

MRS, WILLIAMS!

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Could you

clarify that question?
QUESTION:

I say, you referred to a woman having an

abortion when she chooses, and I merely ask whether, under
our decisions, her choice is not the solitary factor that
enters into that decision.
MRS. WILLIAMS;

As I understand the Roe opinion,

it's a doctor's decision, a medically —
QUESTION; Well,

it would depend upon the California

law, which would be limited by the Roe decision? but,within

21

those limits, the California law could take a variety of
different forms and impose a variety of different limitations.
MRS. WILLIAMS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think the primary point here is that the only
group chosen to bear the burden of an exclusion under the
fund is a group whose choice with respect to pregnancy is
a protected one.

Whether the person chooses to terminate

the pregnancy or carry the pregnancy out, under the California
program she uniquely bears the burden of an exclusion from a
program that assists every other worker who might be
disabled.
Hie sole criterion for granting benefits for any
of the disabilities that I just mentioned, that are covered
by the program, is whether the worker is medically disabled.
Women disabled by childbirth meet this medical criterion,
and, like other workers, suffer from the attendant wage loss.
Given that this disabled class of women is
similarly situated with respect to the program's stated
major purposes, we might ask whether scrutiny of the program
structure and operation reveals unstated but no less clear
evidence of legislative purposes which would explain this
singular exclusion.
Quite plainly, they do not.
California has created a wholly pooled risk program.
Workers contribute a flat percentage of their income to the

22
fund and benefits are paid according to a statutory scale
based on wages.
The California program excludes no adverse risk
groupsf and in fact prohibits groups of low-risk workers from
belonging to separata plans at lower cost.
Rather than categorise workers on the basis of
actuarial factors, California has chosen to pool high and lowrisk workers in one comprehensive fund.
Age and income level, two of the most accurate
predictors of disability risk, according to California’s own
and national statistics, are irrelevant to an individual
worker’s contribution rate or eligibility for benefits.
California does not even compile statistics on
disability experience by race, although national health
survey statistics, published by HEW, indicate that the gap
between disability days on the basis of race is significantly
greater than that based on sex.
QUESTION;

Has there been some litigation on

differential disability rates between women and men?
MRS. WILLIAMS;

Yes.

As I understand it, there are

now lawsuits in the New York area challenging the application
of an actuarial basis as between men and women in the granting
of insurance benefits.
QUESTIONs So that if California departed from the
pooled risk approach and took the differential approach, it

23
wouldn’t foe out of the x^roods, 1 take it?
MRS. WILLIAMSs

Minimally it xtfould face lawsuits.

What the conclusion of those might be, I couldn't say.
Under a pooled risk system, none of the actuarial
considerations arise that would be relative there.
QUESTIONs

Well, I suppose an ingenious lawyer

under California's present system could bring a class suit
on behalf of all men, couldn't he, that they are discriminated
against because they get less for what they pay in?
MRS. WILLIAMS:

Well, that really brings me to my

next point.
QUESTION; Because they're men.
QUESTION: Because they're man.
Is that correct?

I mean, isn't that factually true

that men as a class, under the existing California plan,
pay in more and get less under this system?
MRS. WILLIAMS:
and get out less.

Men, per se, do not pay in more

That is not the predicted factor, under

the program.
The first and major predictive
course x-zage level.

factor is of

The California program is structured so

as to benefit low-wage earners at a disproportionate rate
to high-wage earners.

So that a low-wage earner would

receive a 65 percent wage replacement, whereas a high-income
wage earner would receive approximately 55 percent wage

24
replacement.
For this reason the difference in -the income level
between men and women explains almost wholly the difference in
the contributions received from the fund —- in the benefits
paid by the fund.
There is an additional factor, however, that 1 would
mention, since the State has put considerable emphasis on it,
and that is that,wage level aside, women suffer a far larger
number of disabilities than men do.
This is simply hot borne out by the facts.

The

State's own facts or any others.
The actual difference in the disability rate is,
in California, that women receive 44 percent of the benefits,
and they are 40 percent of the work force.
I’m sorry, let me correct that.

They filed 44 per­

cent of the claims, and they are 40 percent of the work force.
In addition, the average duration for disabilities
between men and women is approximately the same.
Now, I think that the other factor that’s important
in determining whether sex is the predictive factor is to
look at the disability rates of persons at different income
levels.

And there again we find that the low-wage earners have

a higher disability rate, and of course women are among the
low-income group and consequently do suffer higher disability
rate

25
Now, what this all amounts to is that sex is not the
primary predictive factor here.

The primary predictive

factor in both respects that I mentioned is the wage level.
And for California to urge that women receive a disproportion­
ate amount of the funds is another example of using the
sex of women against them, when it really has nothing to do
with the benefits they receive or the contributions they
make „
Now, appellant's main contention, as I understand
it, really its sole contention is that the cost of cover£ige
of childbirth-related disabilities is so extraordinarily
expensive that it would be impossible to maintain a program
supported by employee contributions if these disabilities
were included.
As the District Court found, even using appellant's
estimate of cost, it is clear that including these dis­
abilities would not destroy the fund.

The Legislature could

accommodate these costs quite easily by making reasonable
changes in the contribution rate, the maximum benefits
allowable, or other factors affecting the solvency of the
fund.
Even by appellant's own estimate, the difference
that any individual worker would have to pay per month to the
fund amounts to two dollars.

Under our estimate, which is

about half as large, that amount would be one dollar in addi-

26
tion per month.
Now, the primary factor which accounts for the
difference in our estimate of the cost of this particular
disability is the duration estimated by the appellant as
compared to the estimate of duration which we derive from
common medical understanding.
A conservative estimate made by the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is that the disability
resulting from childbirth will average six to eight weeks.
This is approximately half of the duration estimated by the
appellant.
In fact, many of the doctors surveyed by appellant,
in the survey which he attaches to his primary brief, estimate
that the average duration of disability is less than six
weeks.

We don't ask this Court to make a finding of the

average number of weeks of disability due to childbirth,
we simply point out that doctors almost uniformly agree that
the average is, at most, half of the estimate of the appellant.
In a twelfth-hour attempt to justify his cost
estimates, appellant attaches, as Appendix B to his brief, a
chart purporting to show -that one-half of Mew Jersey's benefit
payments are paid for pregnancy-related disabilities.
Because this figure so distorts the actual situation
in the State of New Jersey, appellees would request the
opportunity to submit, within ten days, a short explanation

27
of the true facts, when they can be gathered.
Briefly explained, the figures submitted by
appellant are misrepresentative because they show benefit
payments under only one of New Jersey's three separate
disability funds.
The fund mentioned, or shown in the chart attached
to the reply brief, is the disability during unemployment
fund, which pays out only ten percent or so of all benefits?
but almost all pregnancy claims.
Employers commonly lay off pregnant woman some weeks
prior to disability in that State, thereby necessitating
their claims go under this unemployment fund.
New Jersey's total experience is that childbirthrelated benefits comprise only eight or nine percent of total
program benefits, according to the figures which we've been
able to derive and will submit to the Court within ten days.
In the final analysis, the exclusion of birthrelated disabilities is solely a matter of cost, as I've
indicated before.

The meager legislative history available

to us suggests no other basis.
The California Legislature, which enacted the
program in 1946, looked to and learned from the only State
disability program then in existence, the Rhode Island
program created four years earlier,
Rhode Island's program, in its early years, had

28
severe financial problems which California sought to avoid.
One major drain on the Rhode Island program's funds was the
cost of paying benefits for pregnancy.
The major reason for this high cost was the fact
that Rhode Island paid benefits to a woman simply because she
was pregnant, without requiring a showing of actual physical
disability.
California, rather than control for this overgenerous interpretation of pregnancy-related disability,
excluded such disabilities from the fund altogether.
The desire to save money cannot justify an otherwise
invidious classification.
In Shapiro vs. Thompson, this Court confronted the
determination of Congress in at least forty States, that
public money should not be spent on welfare aid to new
residents.

The primary reason for that one-year residency

requirement was the Legislature's desire to save welfare
cos ts.
This Court held that the Constitution required
inclusion of the class deliberately excluded by the Legis­
lature significantly, although this Court closely scrutinized
the classification in Shapiro, it indicated that the one-year
residence requirement was vulnerable even under the traditional
more lenient rational basis standard of equal protection
review.

29

Similarly, both in Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S., and
Frontiero, at 411 U.S., considerations of economy were
rejected as a basis for discriminating against women.
Indeed,
QUESTION:

Didn't Shapiro have a footnote in it

indicating that insurance claims might be treated differently
than ordinary welfare payments?
MRS. WILLIAMS:

I believe you're referring to

footnote 6 in Shapiro, and that —
QUESTION: Well, you know more about it than I do.
MRS. WILLIAMS:

— and that footnote states that

a State disability program would be entitled to tie benefits
to contribution rate, which California now does; by its
flat one percent rate.
That is not inconsistent with our position here.
Indeed, to permit differential treatment on the
hr

basis of sex, solely because the State wishes to save money,
when perhaps the most pervasive form of discrimination against
women is economic, is to perpetuate the historical discrimina­
tion against -them.
Equality for women, as equality for black persons,
has done and will continue to do, costs money as the
experience under Title VII in the Equal Pay Act demonstrates.
Nowhere is the economic discrimination against
women more apparent than in the rules and practices surrounding

30

the reality that women are the bearers of children.

This

role, which calls for stereotyped notions that women belong
in the home with their children, that women are not serious
members of the work force, and that women generally have a
male breadwinner in their families to support them, has
resulted in laws which force able-bodied women off the job,
which denies them unemployment insurance once they’ve gone on
mandatory maternity leave, denies them sick leave when their
disability results from pregnancy, and disability insurance
as well, which does not permit them to return to work at the
time when they become physically able? often denies them
seniority and other benefits which accrue to workers normally
disabled, and finally, when they try to return to the job
often the jobs themselves are denied.
In light of these realities, Judge Haynsworth's
conclusion in Cohen vs. Chesterfield County School Board,
474 F 2d, that:

"The fact that only women experience

pregnancy and motherhood removes all possibility of competi­
tion in this area" is simply false.
Rather, women who become pregnant suffer a serious
competitive disadvantage, not because their physiological
state renders it inevitable and unavoidable, but because of
overbroad and arbitrary rules concerning that physiological
state.
An example of the kind of discriminatory notions

31
which — upon which the State has focused and made its
arguments, are two exampless

one of the kind I just

mentioned? and another kind which I will describe.
The first is that the reason for the fifteen-week
duration is that women will have to go on mandatory maternity
leave before they’re physically disabled, and the doctors
will provide for compensation during that time.
The second is that doctors, being sympathetic
people, will take into consideration grounds other than
medical grounds in determining whether a woman continues to
be disabled.
This first ground, or rather both grounds assume
that doctors will not make medical judgments in determining
whether or not a woman is physically disabled because of
childbirth.
I think there's no basis for that.

In fact, as

Mr* Chief Justice Burger mentioned in the Roe opinion,
doctors are a group likely to carry out their professional
responsibilities.
There may well be problems at first in California,
as there were in Rhode Island, in educating people as to
what a disability related to pregnancy is? and what I mean
by that is the State itself has shown confusion between
child-bearing leave and disability leave.

And it may be
T

that doctors will have to be informed as to what's expected

32
of them in submitting disability verifications.
That doctors will collude with women in order to
get the benefits which they don't deserve, I think is
contrary to reality, however.
Now, it has been said that disability *— that
discrimination based upon pregnancy should not be considered
to be sex discrimination, for several reasons.

The main one

being that women are not in competition with men in this area,
and, in addition, that it's a unique characteristic.

And

those arguments are related.
It's only true that pregnancy is unique and there is
no competition in situations in which the lav/ is narrowly
and carefully drawn, so that the purposes are so stated that
all that could possibly be covered in that situation is
pregnancy, and pregnancy exclusions would not be irrationally
categorized.
Let me give you an example.
A law which said that a woman was entitled to
nursing leave after the birth of her child would be a rational
statute.
children.

The reason for that is that only mothers can nurse
If it was a leave which said mothers can take time

off to care for their children after birth, that may well
discriminate against fathers, who are perfectly capable of
taking care of their children in ways other than nursing.
Most of the lav/s which we have discussed here today,

33
and which are exemplified by the practice struck down in
Cohen and LaFlear, however, affect women in an area where
they truly do compete with men, and put them at a serious
disadvantage, not just at the time that they go out of the
work force, but sometimes in terms of their whole working
lives,
Now, there are a number of reasons why discrimina­
tion on the basis of pregnancy should be considered sex
discrimination.
Historically we have seen, in cases like Bradwell,
in cases like Muller, in cases like Hoyt the very justifica­
tion for idle discrimination against women in those cases
was primarily based on their child-bearing function, and the
role which was assumed to grow out of that function»
Now, as time has gone on, these generalised
discriminations based on pregnancy, which, for example, kept
women out of the legal profession for a number of years,
have gradually been struck down. But what remains is the
narrow area in which these unique sex characteristics
prevent women from full participation in the labor force,
not because of their physical state but because of rules
which exclude them.
Now, in Frontiero vs. Laird, the plurality in that
case stated that the reason for scrutinizing sex-based
classifications in part was that stereotypes and generaliza-

34
fcions had so grown up around the status of women that laws
often discriminated against them not on any real factors,
but because of these stereotypes.
Pregnancy presents a primary example of that.
Women are thought of, on the one hand, as completely disabled
during the whole pregnancy? and, in the next moment, the
State can assert that women are not disabled at all and should
be excluded from a disability program.
QUESTION5

Well, have they said that they're not

disabled, or that this isn’t the kind of a disability
contemplated by the statute?
MRS. WILLIAMS; They have said that normal pregnancy
that pregnancy is a normal physiological function, and
that it does not give rise to illnesses or injuries.
I think this is clearly contrary to fact.

Any

common medical te&t will indicate that when a woman goes
through the birth process her entire birth canal is, to some
extent, damaged by her giving birth? that when the child
emerges she often has a surgical procedure, called an
episiotomy, which is disabling to her for some period of time.
Interestingly enough, the State will compensate if
the child is delivered through a surgical incision in the
abdomen, but will not do so when there's a surgical incision
at the end of the birth canal.
That women suffer disabilities for other physical
/

35
reasons# such as a change in their hormone level immediately
following birth, is also clear and well-established in the
medical texts.
The centrality of women's biological reproductive
role to historical and current discrimination against worsen
on the basis of sex stereotypes concerning that role leads
to the inescapable conclusion: so long as classifications
based upon pregnancy are thrust outside the bounds of
judicial scrutiny, so long will women suffer unwarranted
and arbitrary discrimination because they.are women.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Williams, what is your comment on

tiie question I asked opposing counsel; do you concede that
some of these named plaintiffs have a moot case?
MRS. WILLIAMS:

Yes, we do.

QUESTION: But you think that the one, Mrs,
Jaramillc, still is live as far as the controversy is
concerned?
MRS. WILLIAMS:

Yes, I believe it is.

She has

not been paid disability benefits.
The aspirations of women are inextricably linked
to fair and realistic treatment of pregnancy in the public
sector.

This case presents one example of a situation where

mythology overcomes rationality, as to the duration of the
disability, as to the nature of the disability# and as to
the nature of the woman's participation in the work force.

36
We agree with appellant that pregnancy is not a
disability.

At the same time, it does give rise in certain

situations to verifiable medical disabilities.

In a program

that compensates for work loss due to every conceivable
disability:

normal, voluntary, unique to one sex, expensive,

frequent, or whatever consideration, the exclusion of
pregnancy-related disabilities unconstitutionally discriminates
against women.
We urge that this Court affirm the decision of the
District Court.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Williams, as I understood your

argument, it depends entirely upon the claim that this is
discrimination based upon gender.

Am I mistaken about that?

What if we had — what if California should decide that it
would exclude, let's say, all emotional or mental illnesses,
and compensate only physical illnesses or injuries? presumably,
again, at least an ingenious lawyer could make an equal
protection claim challenge upon that sort of exclusion.
But yours, you don't make that sort of claim, do you?

Yours

is entirely based upon the proposition that this is gender
discrimination, sex discrimination.
MRS. WILLIAMS:

No, Your Honor, it is not.

We do

believe that this is gender discrimination, but we also
believe that the classification here is totally irrational
under the stated purposes and operation of the program.

37

Mrs. Condas gives, as —QUESTION:

So you are that ingenious lawyer.

MRS. WILLIAMS:

Well, in this particular case I

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You suggested that you

might want to respond to some material.

If you respond in

that sense, rather than introducing new matter, you may
submit it to your friends on the other side and in due
course submit it to us.
MRS. WILLIAMS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I will do

38
that.
These statistics which came in in the reply brief
are statistics that we had never seen before# and came into
the record very late.

And we would like the opportunity to

respond.
MR. ClIJEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I believe there's

another question here, too.
QUESTION:

Mrs. Williams, I'd like to ask a question

that's irrelevant to a legal argument perhaps, but has the
California Legislature been requested to reconsider the
exclusion of normal pregnancy?
MRS, WILLIAMS:

It recently of course considered

complications of pregnancy in tine passage of the bill,
QUESTION:

Yes,

MRS. WILLIAMS:

To mv knowledge it has not been

directly requested by anyone that I know of, but I would have
no reason to know, to change its law.

There have been no

bills forthcoming on this subject recently.
QUESTION: At the time of that change, were there

.

legislative hearings, public hearings, with the opportunity
for members of the public to appear and testify?
MRS. WILLIAMS;

I believe so, yes,

I would like to point out that in terms of the
interest of the workers in this case, which I believe goes to
your point, the California workers appear to be in support of

33
this suit, at least a large proportion of them.

A number

of labor unions are parties to this lawsuit, both originally
and as intervenors.

And I think it's clear that, to them

at least, the one percent contribution rate that the State
argues is so important to the concept of the program is
not so important to them that it couldn't be somewhat
altered to cover this kind of disability.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mrs.

Williams.
Do you have anything further, Mrs. Condas?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. JOANNE CONDAS,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE APPELLANT
MRS. CONDAS:

I should like to respond to the

question concerning further legislative consideration of
inclusion of pregnancy.
It's a matter that comes up every year because, of
course, the Legislature is always confronted with the
request to reallocate benefits among groups, in different
ways.
And I should like to call the Court's attention to
Judge Williams' discussion in his dissent from the opinion,
which is contained in the Appendix to our Jurisdictional
Statement at page 22 and 23.
He discusses the transmogrifications that Senate

40
Bill 419 went through, and there were statistical presentations
made to the Senate Committees that considered that, so that
from a bill which began by offering maternity benefits of
fifteen x^eeks, at a cost increase up to '73 percent in the
premium, the bill finally emerged in the form of one treating
only abnormal and involtunary complications of pregnancy.
And I would also like to respond to the discussion
about involuntary terminations or involuntary complications,
and why that word is used in the existing law.
There is still a good deal of social controversy
over granting a woman the right to have an abortion, must
the public pay for it when a significant segment of the public
still has philosophical objections to doing so.
As a consequence, the bill emerged that way after
full legislative discussion and a good deal of interplay
among interested groups.
I would like to reiterate the five factors that I
discussed before, and it seems to me in a way that what I'm
talking about is sort of like the blind man examining an
elephant:

that if you just talk about the voluntariness,

you can find other conditions that are somewhat voluntary!
and if you just talk about the duration, you can find other
conditions that have long duration? and if you just talk
about the cost, you can probably find others that somewhat
approach the cost of pregnancy.

41
But if you take all of those five factors together,

QUESTION:

That's only three.

MRS. CONDAS:

I beg your pardon, well —

[Laughter. ]
MRS. CONDAS:

— all right.

The difference in

medical standards, and I would like to respond particularly
to the statement which is in the appellees' brief concerning
the position of the American Physicians and Gynecologists
on this point.
It may be that they say one thing in one context,
and they do another thing in another context.
For example, the Railroad Retirement Board provides
full pregnancy benefits for disability from pregnancy. And
the statistics contained in the report of the Railroad
Retirement Board, covering 1970 and 1971, average, per
beneficiary, 110 days per pregnancy.

Nov;, those are all

based, again, on medical certification.
So it's clear that doctors are willing to be a
little bit more generous. And I submit to you that one of
the reasons is, it's not unlike what Professor Thomas Reed
Powell said in connection with having a legal mind:

that if

you can think of one thing and not think of the other
thing

that's inextricably interwoven with it, then you have

a legal mind.

42
Well, I believe that’s the condition that a physician
is in in treating a mother with a newborn child.

And in

that respect let me call to your attention the brief, the
amicus curia© brief filed in this case by the Physicians
Forum, and at page 2 of that brief, in discussing why they
have an interest in this case, they say,three times, the
health of the prospective mother and child, the health of
working women and their' children, and the health of the woman
or the fetus, all are reasons why the disability of
pregnancy should be included.
Well, I think that's just a fairly clear indication
that doctors have, in conservative medical judgments, quite
proper concern for the mother and the newborn child together,
and they're simply not going to be able to sort out the
mother is not disabled but the newborn baby would be better
of if she were with it.
I just believe that's not going to happen.
I should also like to comment that California has
always had a concern about the higher cost of covering
%

women under disability.
history here.

There's no dearth of legislative

There has been in the regulations from almost

the very beginning a restriction that relates to private plans,
which were a significantly greater factor in earlier days?
and that regulation, which is in the California Administrative
Code, Title 22, section 3254(h), required that private plans

43
include at least 20 percent women.

And that was obviously,

perhaps an inartful, but it was certainly an effort to require
that funds have some balance to compensate for the fact that
women simply cost more to cover under disability plans.
Herbert Denenberg, the Commissioner of Insurance of
the State of Pennsylvania, who is no friend of the insurance
industry, has consistently acknowledged that it cost between
two and three times the same amount to cover women as it
does men, without covering pregnancy.
But, finally, I'd just like to leave this one
thought:

that we're not talking about adding a new class of

beneficiaries, there’s not a single woman who would be
brought into the class of beneficiaries who is not there
now.

Every woman who's eligible for disability insurance

in California is getting disability insurance coverage.
The result of this decision would be to skew
that benefit package so that a small percentage of the women
get the lion's share of the benefits.

v

And when our State court had this qxiestion before it
in 1958, that was exactly the problem that they foresaw,
and exactly why they felt it was a legislative decision to
decide how to treat pregnancy, whether to exclude it
entirely, to put a long durational requirement, which is all
they did in the beginning, to extend the durational require*ment, or simply to compensate complications of pregnancy.

44
That was a decision that the Legislature made and
has consistently re-examined with legislative bills that
come up just about every year.
And it just seems to me to be almost inconceivable
that we could alien/ this disproportion to grow larger.
I submit that if pregnancy is required to be covered,
we can expect that approximately two percent of the work force
in California will collect more than thirty percent of the
benefits.
Wow, this is arrived at very simply.

It is

established that approximately five percent of the women
in the work force become pregnant each year, and even if you
were to assume that the work force is made up of fifty percent
women,

which it is not, but let us assume that for the sake

of argument, you then have a condition where you knot/ what
the pregnancy benefits are going to be.

They are going to be

an admitted thirty to forty percent increase in the cost,
so you have whatever small percentage of women who become
pregnant each year taking down a total of thirty percent of
the added cost of the administration of the fund.
And I submit that to do that under the guise of
equal protection or due process would seem to me to be a
very surprising result.
For that reason, California urges that the District
Court decision be reversed.

45
QUESTION:

Mrs. Condas, I interrupted you there,

I wonder if you could just summarize again these five parts
of the elephant,
[Laughter,
MRS. CONDAS:

3
Be happy to.

First of all there is the relative cost.

There is

no question the majority below accepted our estimate.

They

simply said wa couldn't exclude it simply because it was a
high-cost item.
Every State, every private plan has had the
same experience with the high cost of pregnancy coverage.
There is also the factor that because it is a
voluntary condition and because it is a desired condition,
conceded to be desired condition, by the appellees, that it
lends itself to planned use; as illnesses and accidents do
not.
That, thirdly, it has a .longer duration.

In

California the average duration of disability is eight
weeks, and that includes those which go well beyond the 26
weeks and exhaust their benefits,
QUESTION: Well, that's one aspect of cost, isn't
it?
MRS, CONDAS:

It — yes.

Yes, it is.

The different medical standard which necessarily
pertains. We don't believe that that's a matter of fraud and

46
collusion,

We believe it’s a matter of sound medical judgment

in the interest of the mother and child.

A physician in that

area of medical practice would be remiss not to take that
into account.
And also the rate of return to work following
pregnancy.
Since we have not covered pregnancy, we admittedly
have no statistics of our own on that point.

The amicus

curiae briefs filed by the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company and by General Electric Company in this case indicate
that their experience is approximately a fifty percent rate
of return.
QUESTION; Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, ladies.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at. 11:58 o'clock, a.m. , the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
