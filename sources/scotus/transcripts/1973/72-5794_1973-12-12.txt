ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT II. WAGSTAFF, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
■MR. WAGSTAFF;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue presented to the Court in this case is
the virtual confrontation of the confrontation clause of
the Sixth Amendment against a State statute and court rule,
which provides that -juvenile records shall remain secret,
anonymous, in virtually all cases save when the juvenile
is being sentenced as an adult and the court, in its
discretion, feels that the juvenile record would be
relevant or desirable.
In this particular case, this statute and court
rule was applied when a juvenile was testifying for the
prosecution as a chief identification witness against the
accused, Petitioner Davis,
Now, we sought at trial to use this, his juvenile
record, not simply to impeach his character with prior
wrongful acts, but, rather, to show that he had bias,
prejudice, and was testifying out of fear and favor when he

4
identified Petitioner Joshaway Davis at trial.
The court's protective order, or the court entered
a protective order, the trial court did, during the voir
dire examination for jurors, and at that time the issues
were fully raised that are actually presented in our briefs
today? the confrontation issue was argued to the trial court.
There has here been a significant diminution of
cross-examination, and this calls into question the integrity
of the whole fact-finding process, and requires that the
competing interest be closely examined.
The facts of the Davis case really bespeak the
legal issues raised.
A safe was found on some property next to a truck,
approximately 25 miles north of Anchorage, Alaska.

The

stepson of the owner of this property owned this particular
truck, and was on probation for burglary as a juvenile.
He had committed acts which, if he’d .been an adult, would
be burglary.

He had been adjudicated to be a juvenile

delinquent and was under probation at that time to the
Juvenile Court.

lie was sixteen years of age, and lived

on this particular property.
QUESTIONS

Was that his only collision with the

law?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

To our knowledge.

We never

actually were provided with the record at that time.

But

5
respondent, has admitted, in essence# what I’ve* just related
to the Court# in their particular brief; and I don't believe
that1s at issue.
We desired to bring this fact out to the jury in
order to show that this witness was initially afraid that he
was going to be linked into a burglary charge himself#
because this witness turned out to be the chief critical
identification witness, and, indeed# the one essential
witness at trial against Joshaway Davis.
The story that Hr. Green, tine boy Green, gave to
the police officers when they came up to investigate the
situation was that earlier in the day he had been walking
in the area where the safe was found and had observed two
black man to be standing near a recent, a late-model
Chevrolet automobile, metallic in color.
He said that he talked to them briefly and asked
what they were doing there, and they — he asked if they
were having any trouble and they related that, they just
said simply to him:

Is your father here?

And he progressed# he said no, and he progressed on,
and then came back later and stated that he observed these
two men in the same position# one with a crowbar.

He

stated that he probably could identify them.
The next day Green was taken down to the police
station in Anchorage, an inherently coercive environment to

6
begin with, but coupled with this he was taken into a small
room, in the presence of four detectives, seated between the
two chief investigators, the two actual investigating
officers, one of whom was packaging pistols, apparently in
connection with another case, and given either five or six
photographs and asked to see if he could identify one or
both of the persons that he claimed to have seen standing
where this safe was found,
How, at this particular point in time, our theory
of tile case, and the one that we were precluded from
presenting to the jury, was that Green was under a lot of
pressure then to identify someone else.

He, in his own

mind, if not actually, was a suspect of.this burglary and
was under strong impetus to, in fact, pick someone out of
these photographs in order to take the heat off of himself.
Again, the jury was not aware of these circum­
stances .
He did, in fact, pick

a picture out, one of which

was the picture of Joshaway Davis,
There was a subsequent line-up and then an
identification at trial.
Our point is that when this initial photographic
identification was made, Green was then, and from that point
forward, locked into tills identification; and this was the
critical point in time when the identification —

7
QUESTION: Before you leave that police station
situation, I noticed on page 34, that you were referring to
earlier, there was a general question in the course of the
trial, "Had you" *— this is addressed to Green -- "Had you
ever been questioned like that before by any lav; enforcement
officers?"
I would assume, for the moment at least, that that
was some kind of an effort to perhaps lay grounds for
impeaching him; and he answered "No."
When, in fact, as we now know on the total record,
if he had been involved as a juvenile and was on probation,
he must have been at some time interrogated by police
officers in the past.
MR. WAGSTAPP: That’s correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
And ■*•»
QUESTION:

7 iDid you pursue that by way of any

impeachment at a later point?
MR. WAGSTAFP:
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WAGSTAFF:

In the trial?
r. No, I did not.

An objection was

made at that time when I asked that question, there was a
negative response, that -•-* the objection was incomplete;
"he’s attempting to raise in the jury's mind

and the

court said simply, "I'll sustain the objection."
And at that point, I believe that the court, .and

8

the record reflects# was referring to its prior protective
order that we couldn't get into that particular area.
Respondent attempts to limit, the meaning of that
question with the words "like that'.'

I think when the

question is read in conjunction with the prior question#
which was, "And then you went into the investigators' room
with Investigator Gray and Investigator Weaver?"

"Yeah.”

"And they started asking you questions about -— about the
indicent, is that correct?"

"Yeah."

"Had you ever been

questioned like that before by any law enforcement
6ffice rs ?"

The answer was "Mo."
Again we feel that this answer itself was# must

have been# untruthful# and we were precluded from showing
this to the jury.
Also# we not only were prohibited from crossexamining Green on this point# but the police investigators
as well, with respect to particular pressures they may have
put on Green at the time of the initial photographic
identification.
Particularly# Investigator Gray was asked# "Did
you at any time suspect Green to be involved in this
burglary?" and he responded "Mo."
Cross-examination at that point was precluded on
"How is your negative response consistent with your knowledge
that he in fact was a juvenile on probation for burglary#

9

the safe was found on his land, next to his truck?”

Again

that question was precluded.
The prosecution at trial made the most of their
protective order.

The jury was, in essence, given a

distorted view of exactly what Green was and who he was.
The protective order, of course, came during the voir dire
examination, so that any mention of the problem, the
juvenile record, would not come before the jury.
In closing the argument, the prosecution stated
that the petitioner’s entire defense, which our entire
defense was, that Green's identification was unreliable,
that he was under pressure„

We tried to show just by the

fact that he was, the safe was found on his property, next
to his truck, that he would be under pressure.
our defense.

That was

This was developed in opening statement,

throughout the trial, and in closing argument.
The prosecution, in closing argument, claimed that
this was a total red herring issue, one that we had just
made up, and that there was no basis for this belief.

He

also stated, and I'm referring to pages 422 and 424 of the
transcript, that our defense of bias and prejudice and
fear and favor on the part of Green came as a result of pure
suspicion of society and suspicion of law enforcement
officers.

When, of course, the prosecutor must have known

in his own mind, at least, the origins of our attack on

10

witness Green's credibility and any bias and fear and favor
he had in testifying came from other independent sources
than tliat.
As a result of Green's identification at the
station house, a search warrant was obtained for a car
belonging to Petitioner Joshaway Davis; a search was made
of records of rental car agencies the police suspected,
because of the description of the car maybe is a rental car,
they found a ear rented to petitioner? obtained a search
warrant for the premises, his house, and also of the
vehicle.
As a result of this search, they found evidence
inferentially

relating petitioner's car to be present

perhaps at the scene, or actually with having had a safe,
perhaps, in the trunk of the rented car at one time.
That's the extent of the other evidence presented
against petitioner at trial.

The actual evidence in the

trunk of the car were insulation fibers that could have
come from a safe, and paint chips that could have coma
from a safe.

This was the extent of the identification of

these particular substances.
There was no

there were no fibers or paint

chips found on petitioner's clothing or on his shoes or —
nor was the money found that was allegedly in the safe;
none of the things that the search warrant basically was

II
seeking were ever found; just these small item.”- of evidence.
This is important, of course, to the significance
of Green’s identification.

The crucial nature, the essential

nature of his testimony — its essential nature I don't
believe is actually in dispute; it was admitted at trial
during -the motion for a protective order, described as an
essential witness, with that very word.

Also the Alaska

Supreme Court, in their opinion, described him as an
essential witness; that the case could not have been made
without him.
The trial judge ruled on the issue on the basis,
strictly, of the State statute and the rule involved.

He

initially was inclined to rule in our favor, as the record
reflects, and stated when he reversed himself that he really
didn't agree with what he was doing, but he felt constrained
to do so by a specific court rule in Alaska, which is
cited, of course, in the brief.
QUESTION;

Suppose Joshaway Davis had a juvenile

record, would that — would you have allowed that to go in?
MR. WAGSTAPP;
QUESTION;

His juvenile record?

I said supposing that he did have one,

would you have allowed that to go in?
MR» WAGSTAFF:

Absolutely not.

His record would

not be — he didn't testify, for one thing; but assuming that
he had testified, then the State statute would have prohibited,

12

anti the rule prohibited it from being used against him in a
subsequent criminal prosecution# an it should be.
QUESTION:

And the difference is what?

MR. WAGSTAPP: The difference is what.

Well# in

this case# that Green was not being accused of anything#
the record was not sought to be used against him, strictly.
It was sought to be used to impeach his credibility# not
even necessarily to attack his character# but that he was
testifying under fear and favor.
And if there is any conflict between that
particular State law and rule and the Sixth Amendment# then
the statute and. rule must accede to the Sixth Amendment#
the confrontation clause*
QUESTION:

You say you wanted to use the record

to impeach his credibility?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

His# Green's credibility, yes# and

fcc show that he was testifying from fear and favor.
QUESTION: What did the Alaska Supreme Court mean
when it said that Davis claims not to be interested in
impeaching the juvenile# but rather desires to show bias#
prejudice# or motive# in that the witness was under pressure
to shift suspicion from himself onto another?

Is that a

correct reflection of what you want to do?
MR. WAGSTAFF:
about impeachment and —

Yes# it is,

When we're talking

.13

QUESTlOHs

I mean you just weren't interested in

introducing the record to show that he had had a criminal
record and he might not be reliable or truthful?
MR. WAGS TAPP:

Wo, we weren't using it i under" the

State's rule of evidence which provides that impeachment
of character may come about by shewing any specific bad acts
in the past.

We weren't attempting to do that.

QUESTION:

That kind of impeachment goes to sort

of a general attack on credibility.
MR. WAGSTAFF;

On character.

The distinction that

I would make is that would be an attack on the witness's
character; in this case we wanted to make a specific attack
on his credibility, to show bias and prejudice on his part.
QUESTION:

Just for the limited purpose of

showing bias, prejudice or motive, in the sense that he had
some special reason for cooperating with the police?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Yes.

QUESTION: Because he was on probation?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Yes*

That — there would be two

parts to what his special motive for the identification
would be; the first part would be to take the pressure off
himself, when he made that initial identification shortly
after the safe was discovered on his property, next to
his truck, that he was very anxious to do that;
investigation be turned away from him.

that the

At least as he saw

it in his own. mind.
And, secondly, that he would have impetus to
testify just by virtue of the fact that he was on probation
and would somehow hope thereby
QUESTION*

But, in any event, you had a more

limited reason for wanting to use the record than you might
have had?
MR. WAGSTAPF:

No, I don’t think I understand

your question, Justice White.
QUESTION: Well, the appellant

he claims not

to be interested in impeaching the juvenile.

Now, if we

put that aside, whatever it is, you are left with something
that is less than —
HR. WAGSTAFF:

I’ve tried to cover that somewhat

in my reply brief, that when the term "impeachment" and
the term "attack bn credibility” had been used somewhat
interchangeably, and I tried to distinguish them,
at least for purposes of ray argument.

And the cases that

I have cited in support of our position also make that
distinction,
QUESTION: The reason I was interested in it is
that the Alaska — the State Supreme Court seemed to say that
with respect to this limited reason for wanting to use the
juvenile record, that that reason was amply satisfied by
the scope of the cross-examination which was allowed.

15
MR. WAGSTAFF:

I don't think the Alaska Supreme

Court was limiting themselves to strictly impeachment in terms
of the particular civil rule.

I think they were talking

about a general impeachment attack.

And I think that you

could define under two sub headings under the word "impeachment";

attack against character; and attack against

credibility.
The case —
QUESTION:

How do you separate those two?

I confess that I could not understand what the Supreme
Court’s opinion meant when they said that you were not
attacking impeachment.

By whatever narae you call it, if

you try to undermine the jury’s acceptance of the testimony
given,it is impeachment, is it not?
MR, WAGSTAFF;

l agree with that completely, Mr.

Chief Justice.
I think what the court must have made was using —
the reason the term ’’impeachment" is a word of art.
Particularly, and I’ve cited it in the first part of my
brief under Alaska Civil Rule 43, it talks about impeachment
by an adverse party, and then it goes on;

that a party may

not be impeached by evidence of particular wrongful acts,
except that it may be shown by the examination of the
witness or the record of a judgment that he had been
convicted of a crime.

16
1 think that's what the court was talking about.

We weren't attempting to do that, although, as I've argued
in my brief, I think that that even should be allowed and let
the jury determine the particular significance of that.
QUESTION:

But you weren't pushing for that in

the State court.
MR, WAGSTAFF:

Wasn't pushing for that, and we

aren't pushing for that 1101/.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. WAGSTAFF:
case.

Because it’s not necessary in this

But I think it should be allowed,
QUESTION: Because it could be that you could use

a prior criminal record, for impeachment for a purpose that's
wholly aside from showing bias or prejudice.
MR* WAGSTAFF:

Yes.

That simply this person is a

bad person, and he should not be believed,
QUESTION;

Yes, and he may not be truthful.

MR. WAGSTAFF:

Yes,

QUESTION:

But yet —

QUESTION:

And it might be that a jurisdiction

such as Alaska might wholly abolish the rule that permits
impeachment, simply by showing a prior conviction.

And I

take it your argument doesn't go to any such general
abolition.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

No, it does not, and of course

17
there is a perceptible trend in that direction.

But. we

were not limiting, we were not offering it solely for that
purpose.

And actually that was a secondary purpose.

The

primary purpose was to show that this witness, in his own
mind, by virtue of the fact that he was on probation for
burglar/, would feel that he was a suspect.
QUESTION:

You might have had the situation for

showing that if he were simply charged as a juvenile, and
not even finally adjudicated.
HR. WAGSTAFF: That's correct.

It could be —

his wind .is what is critical, and the jury should be allowed
to determine what factors were present in his mind, what
pressures lie would feel.

We relied very heavily on, of

course, two cases where this is discussed greatly;
Alford case and Smith vs. Illinois.

the

And I think those cases

are directly applicable here.
QUESTION;

In reading the opinion of Chief Justice

Boney, that part of it appearing on 59a of the Appendix,
he was simply describing your argument.

He says that you

recognize that the majority of the case law is against you
so far as cross-examining a juvenile prosecution witness,
those in order generally to impeach him, and that therefore
you were trying to take your case out of this general rule
and show that you had very special reasons, special
circumstances to do it here,

Particularly in light of his

13

footnote 40 on that page.
You know what you argued to the Alaska Supreme
Court, I don't.

But this seems to be a reflection of the

argument you madet that you're not under the general rule/
you're under the exception to the rule.
HR. WAGSTAFF:

That's correct.

QUESTION: Because of the special circumstances in
your case.
MR. WAGSTAFF: That's correct.
QUESTION:

Mow, this particular witness having

been found a. delinquent by reason of larceny, and of the
stolen safe having been found next to his truck, and
therefore that he was under some particular reason to
testify against your client? that it wasn't just a case of
general impeachment.

That's the way I understand it.

Is that my *—
MR, WAGSTAFF: That's correct.
QUESTION:

Have I misread it?

MR. WAGSTAFF:

Ho.

I think that's absolutely

correct, Justice S tewart.
QUESTION;

And the court went on to think that if

that was your purpose, at least their view of the evidence
was, and of the cross-examination, that you hadn't had
ample opportunity to satisfy that purpose.
cross-examination that you were allowed.

Within the
That's what they

13

said, isn't it?
MR. WAGSTAFF:
QUESTION:

That's what they found, yes.

Yes.

MR. WAGSTAFF:

But of course -die questions that

were permitted were only self-serving general questions,
such as: Did you feel you were under* pressure, Mr. Green?
Did you feel you night be a suspect?
Questions like this, which he answered negatively,
which would offer —
QUESTION:

And the trial court’s ruling prevented

you from going into the fact that the safe was found on
his property and that he had some relationship with the
owner of the truck.

I mean, you were perfectly free to

follow up that, if you chose.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Yes.

But that's the extent of it.

Me could not bring it home to the jury, as Justice
Rabinowitz points out in his dissent, the pressures that
Green must have felt in his own mind.

And when he denied

that he felt these pressures, and when he denied he had
ever been questioned by a police officer before, these were
questions that were ripe for exposure on cross-examination:
that the witness either had a very bad memory or was lying,
or whatever other reasons can be expressed.
QUESTION:

Couldn't you, under Alaska, have moved

to have his "no" answer to your question of whether he had

20

ever been questioned by a police officer stricken, since the
trial judge sustained an objection to the question?
MR» WAGSTAFF:

I -— it was not my objection, it

was — I think -the motion would have been made, that motion
to strike would have been made by the person making the
objection, the prosecutor.

I think that the normal trial

practice in Alaska is to let the answer stand, it's been
made.
I would like to reserve the rest for rebuttal.
QUESTION: Well, by asking the question, you knew
you were going to be bound by the answer.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Well, I didn't know what the

answer was, of course.
QUESTION:

You knew you were going to be bound by

it.
MR. WAGSTAFF:
QUESTION:

I knew I1d be bound by it.

And you knew that the order was

outstanding,
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Yes.

The order, the protective

order#
QUESTION: Was outstanding, and yet you asked that
question and you got the answer of "no" and you.were stuck
with it.

Because of you asking the question.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

That's correct,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

All right.

Mr. Merriner.

21

ORAL ARGUMENT OP CHARLES M. MERRINER, ESO.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MERRINER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As I read this Court's confrontation cases, in
determining the damage that has been done to the integrity
of the fact-finding process, I see that the focus is on
two things;

one is the cruciality of the unconfronted

testimony; and the other is that this Court looks to see
just how misled the fact-finder has been by not hearing
the confrontation that has been denied.
And I must concede that Richard Green's testimony
was crucial to the State's case against Joshaway Davis.
My argument is that the jury was not significantly misled
by the denial of cross-examination, by not having heard
about the juvenile record, and by not hearing crossexamination in this area.
QUESTION:

Was that the premise of your argument?

MR, MERRINER;

No, Your Honor.

My argument is

that the testimony was reliable enough that the jurors were
authorized to hear it, even though they did not hear these
facts that impeached the testimony, and they did not hear
cross-examination in that area.
In determining just how misled the jurors were,
I would like to emphasize here at -the outset that Richard

Green was on the stand,

lie was immediately cross-examined

in all areas except this one.

He was under oath. The jury

was able to observe this man’s demeanor as he testified.
And although Hr. Uagstaff could not cross-examine
in -this one area, he was able to bring out questions
concerning whether or not this person thought himself to be
under suspicion and therefore whether or not he had a
motive to quickly identify somebody else, or to fabricate
his story in order to help himself in some way.
QUESTION:

Well, apparently we now know, do we

not, that on page 34 he did answer one question falsely,
whether that was -HR. MERRINER:

Well, I would dispute that, Your

Honor, —QUESTION;

You mean that it was a false answer?

HR. MERRINER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice.

What do you suggest it was?

MR. MERRINER:

I pointed out in footnote 3 on my

brief — that's on page 13 — that, this response was not
untruthful, because this inquiry referred to being
questioned as a prospective witness and not as a prospective
accused.
QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. MERRINER:

The words were, "Had you ever been

questioned like that before"

this man was a witness and

23

he was not a prospective accused.
We don't know whether or not the police officers
questioned him at all when he was picked up for his
juvenile violation.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't that then

if that

extraordinary, very extraordinary suggestion that you make
were possibly true, that they didn’t question him, isn't that
something that might appropriately have been the scope of
further examination?
MR. MERRINER:

Yes, Mr, Chief Justice.

Now, I submit to this Court that when this question
was answered in this way, if Mr, Wagstaff

had thought here

that there was perjury involved, he could have asked for
the jury to be excused, could have gone into this further?
but there was an objection.

Mr. Ripley, the prosecuting

attorney, said, "I'm going to object to this, Your Honor,
it's a carry-on with rehash of the same thing.

He's

attempting to raise in the jury’s mind —" and the Court
simply said, "I’ll sustain the objection."
Mr. Wagstaff, at that time, could have made an
offer of proof, an offer of proof that perjury had been
committed.

And if he could have shown that, then I would

think that the court would have had to have allowed him the
juvenile record, because if you've got perjury on the
stand, certainly the defense counsel should be able to

24
impeach with whatever means is necessary to bring out the
fact that 'there has been perjury on the stand.
As the record now stands — and he's never raised
this? in his brief he simply says, this one statement:
"Counsel asked if he had ever been questioned before by
lav? enforcement officers? his ansv/er was no."

And he

doesn't say in there this showed that the man perjured
himself.

The implication is raised, of course, and that's

the reason I put in my footnote 3.

But at the time of

trial —
QUESTIONS

Well, in the face of your Rule 23,

you suggest in the circumstances, you postulate that he
might have got the juvenile record in?
MR. MERHINER:
QUESTION;

Yes.

Well, that would certainly be

contrary to the prohibition of Rule 23, wouldn't it?
MR, MERRINER:

Well, yes, but of course a rule

cannot stand if it's unconstitutional for its application,
to be — for it to be applied.

And there is another rule

in Alaska, Criminal Rules, Rule 57, which says that in the
interest of justice you can dispense with any of the
foregoing rules.
The rule would, I submit, have had to have been
abandoned at that point if, during the offer of proof, it
had come out that Richard Green had perjured himself by

this statement, then I would think that defense counsel
would have been able to bring out the juvenile record at
that point.

Or his right to confront the witnesses against

him would be denied.
But Mr. Wagstaff —■ and getting off this point —
was able to question closely about whether or not Richard
Green considered himself under suspicion, and, as the
Alaska Supreme Court stressed, the jury was able to observe
his demeanor while he was being questioned this way.
The facts that were kept from the jurors did
somewhat impeach Richard Green's testimony; the fact that, he
had been convicted of a crime did somewhat impugn his
credibility, this being a larcenous type crime, a burglary
of two cabins; -the fact that he was on probation showed that
he had somewhat of a motive to quickly identify somebody
else, to foist the blame onto someone else, to take the
suspicion that he felt was on himself, or perhaps even to
fabricate his story in order to aid himself in the eyes of
the lav; enforcement people he had to deal with.
But these facts are not that impeaching, in
themselves.
As for the argument that the conviction itself
impeaches his credibility, in the sense that this was a
larcenous type crime, Mr. Wagstaff does not rely much on
tills argument.

As Mr. Justice White was bringing out, the

26

Alaska Supreme Court indicated in the opinion that this was
not Mr. Wagstaff's main argument, that it should have been
brought in as a conviction itself to impeach credibility.
He has a further argument, that is, that there
was a motive here because of the probation.
Mr. Justice Rehnquist mentioned the possibility of
totally abolishing, for any witness, the use of prior
records.

Now, in February of this year, Alaska, the

Alaska Supreme Court did promulgate a rule that says you
cannot use for any witness any criminal conviction if it's
over five years old.
I can see problems there.

If there’s a perjury

conviction that's six years old, and the State's witness has
the perjury conviction behind him, he is a crucial witness,
I can definitely see there are problems, tin at the defense
counsel would be denied his right to confront if he could
not ask that question*
QUESTION; Well, you then treat the right to
confront, not merely the right to cross-examine generally,
but the r^ght to cross-examine about any subject that the
defense counsel chooses.
MR. MERRINER;

If by not being allowed to go into

this area the jury is rather greatly misled about the
reliability of his testimony, that testimony is crucial,
yes.

27
QUESTION: Well, what if the State recognizes the
husband-wife marital communication privilege, and that
privilege is claimed by a witness on the stand who is
being cross-examined by defense counsel, do you think that
the State court has to abolish that in the interest of
con f rent ation?
MR. MERRIIJER:

Well, I know in Washington v, Texas ,

this Court stressed the fact that they were in no way
indicating that these privileges were being questioned.

But

I could see the possibility of the defense knowing about
some communication made to a husband, and the wife is on the
stand, a crucial State's witness, some communication that,
you know, she tells him, "I'm going to get up on the stand
and lie."

And I can see there that if the State just

went ahead and applied the rule, without much consideration
of the problem, I can see there that the denial of
confrontation would exist.
QUESTION: Well, have any of our cases ever gone
•Hiat far?
MR, MERRINER;

Ho, Mr, Justice Rehnquist.

QUESTION: Well, you're arguing for the State,
aren't you?
MR. MERRINER:

Yes.

But I'm arguing here that the

focus should be, -the test should be on the cruciality of
the testimony to just how misled were the jurors.

Now, 'tills test will apply to any fact situation,
it will apply to any privilege, executive privilege,
whatever, and it may be that all rules, in some situations,
would have to fall.
QUESTION:

Of course, the prosecution always has

the privilege of not raising the rule.
MR. MERRINER:

Yes.

Assuming the court does not,

on its own, do so.
Now, as to the impeaching quality of the fact that
Richard Green was on probation, the record contains no
indication that he stood to gain anything significant at
all by his actions.

The record contains no indication

that he in any way was involved in that burglary, that he
stood to suffer probation revocation.
QUESTION:

Well, of course, had there been the

usual scope of cross-examination, we might have a record
that would disclose some reasons that we can now only
speculate about.
MR. MERRINER:

Yes, but in light of how impeaching

these facts were generally, which, I submit, are not that
impeaching, and in light of the extensive corroboration of
this man’s testimony, it seems apparent that any ftirfcher
cross-examination into this area would not have raised any
hidden doubts in the jurors' minds, doubts that are not
present in this record.

This extensive corroboration shows

29

that his testimony would not have cracked under further
examination.

It's basic, considering *—*

QUESTION:
that?

Well, how in the world can you say

Suppose he asked the question:

Did the police

officers say, Now, look, you’re under probation, you’re
under this and you're under that, you committed a crime
exactly like this, that's the one you were convicted for,
and it's either you or who else?
You mean that wouldn't help?
MR, KERRI HER:

Let me go into just how cor­

roborative this testimony was, and I think that when you
realise just how corroborative it was, then you will see that
by asking these further questions, that testimony would not
have been changed.
QUESTION: Well, I have great difficulty in being
able to take a very careful pair of calipers and find out
what goes through a juror's mind, I've always had great
problem with that.

If I wanted to get all of the facts»

MR, MERRTNER: Well, in these confrontation cases,
that's the question that has to be asked, is what would
the jurors have thought, the test is what the average juror
would have thought, as I believe Schneble brings out.

But

that is the question that has to be asked.
Nov/, the confrontation —QUESTION: Well, do I know what the average juror

30

in Anchorage, Alaska, would think?

You may assume I’ve

never been there, except going through on a plane,
MR, MERHINER:

It’s even colder than this up

there now.
[Laughter. 3
Rut if we look at just how corroborative his
testimony was, we’ll see that these hidden doubts would have
not been raised by further examination, any significant
hidden doubts.
Perhaps most importantly there was a story
given to the trooper on the very day that the burglary
occurred, on the very day that the safe was found out at
his stepfather’s property, and he said;

I saw -these two

men beside a late-model, metallic blue Chevrolet sedan.
The very next day he went down to the police
station, he picked out, out of six pictures, — and I
believe the record will show that, I know it will show that
the Alaska Supreme Court opinion is wrong in that respect?
there were six pictures, they are identified in the record,
Exhibits 25 through 30, I believe — he picked out — and
also the Alaska Supreme Court opinion is wrong when it says
he picked out two pictures; he picked out one picture,
the record will show.

So he picked out of six pictures

the picture of the petitioner.

He was able to do this,

even though it was ten years old.

It did not show the

31

petitioner with a mustache in the picture, although at the
scene of the burglary he had a mustache? at the line-up,
two days after the photo line-up, he had a mustache.
And two days after the photo identification there
was a corporeal line-up, he again picked the man out, out
of a group of seven men he picked two men that time, one as
representing the other man.

So he picked Joshaway Davis.

And, as it turned out, the evidence was that
Joshaway Davis had rented a late-model, a 1969, the burglary
having occurred in February 1970, metallic blue Chevrolet
Impala.
At this point maybe I should mention that Mr.
Wagstaff contends that there was a coercive atmosphere
there, yet there really is nothing in the record that shews
there was anything suggestive about the photo identification,
nothing at all.

He was in a room down at the police

station, true? but there is evidence in the record that no
indication was made to him to pick out such-and-such a
picture.

There is testimony to that effect.

There is none

to the contrary.
Nothing at all in -the record showing that the
photo identification was suggestive.

There is lots of

evidence about how this line-up was conducted, the corporeal
line-up.

Nothing to indicate that that was in any way

suggestive.

32

Now, not only did he rent the car that was
described, but the police developed evidence, or
discovered evidence that on the day of the burglary, shortly
after noon, Joshaway Davis extended the rental contract by
paying, from a large roll of bills, fifty dollars and two
rolls of quarters.
And the story that Richard Green had given was
that he had seen these men out there shortly before noon.
Also, in the truck of the car there were paint
chips and fibers found that, I submit, virtually conclusively
show that that safe was in that trunk.
Now,
QUESTION:

Well, then, are you really not getting

pretty close, if not on, a harmless error argument here?
MR. MERRINER;

No, Mr. Chief Justice,

When you

look at the harmless error argument, you look at whether
or not -the jury would have been swayed to vote differently
if it had heard this evidence.
Now, I’ve just given you some evidence that the
jury hasn't even heard, that is, the contract extension?
the jury never heard about that.
I submit that the test is whether or not this
evidence was reliable, viewing all that we know about this
testimony, viewing all we know, was it reliable enough so
that this jury was given reliable testimony, it was not misled

as to this testimony, so that an innocent man was not
convicted.

It is not a harmless error argument, as such,

in that you do look at other evidence aside from what the
record contains, or that the jury heard.
Mr. Wagstaff says that all that the paint chips
and fibers showed was that a safe could have been in the
trunk.

The FBI agent told about performing a microchemical

analysis on the fibers, and he said that he had never found
this particular composition materials in the fibers anywhere
but in safes,

He compared the fibers from the safe \>rith

the fibers in the trunk, he said they matched*

He said that

just by looking at the fibers in the trunk he could almost
conclude for sure that it came from a Hosier safe.

This

was a Hosier safe.
Then you have the paint. There were three layers
of paint.

Again a microchemical analysis, and each layer

was the same.
The evidence virtually shows beyond any doubt that
that trunk did contain that safe at one time.
Also, Richard Green, when he first told the story
to the trooper, said that the man he talked with, whom he
later identified as Joshaway Davis, was wearing a brown or
black mackinaw jacket.

When the safe was later examined,

there was found to be a little reddish-brown material on
one of the rough edges, where it had been, broken into.

34
Josh away Davis’s description, as given by Richard
Green, did not vary from his actual description.
And as to the tires.

In the reply brief, Hr.

Wagstaff said that I unduly relied upon the evidence
concerning the tires.
out there.

And one set of tire tracks went up to where the

safe was found.
earlier.

There were two sets of tire tracks

There had been a snow two or three days

These were the only tire tracks there.
The officer, Investigator Gray, testified that

he examined the two sets of tire tracks, both of which had
been made by snow tires.
different vehicles.

The two tracks had been made by

And then when he was asked by Mr.

Wagstaff a question, he said the snow tires on the rear of
the vehicle appeared to be the same.

And he meant there,

and it was clear from the questioning, appeared to be the
same on these tracks that led up to the place where the
safe was dumped off, as the tires on the back of the
vehicle.
So you have all of this corroboration.

You have

the fact that he was on -the stand and the jury was able to
observe his demeanor, he was under oath, to the extent that
he was cross-examined, and his testimony contains
sufficient indicia of reliability to have justified the
jury having heard this testimony, even without the denied
cross-examination.

35
The jurors still possessed a satisfactory basis
for examining the truthfulness of his testimony, and
Joshaway Davis was not denied a fair trial.
In the confrontation cases of this Court, the
opinions look not only to the damage done to the integrity
of the fact-finding process, but the cases look to the
\mderlying reasons behind the denial of the confrontation.
And if there has been a significant misleading
of the jury concerning crucial testimony, that reason has
to be closely examined.
In this case the jury was not significantly
misled concerning the crucial testimony, but even if we
closely examine the reason behind denying the crossexamination in the area of the juvenile record here, it
will bear up to the scrutiny.
If juvenile records had to be revealed in cases
that would not benefit — in whioh it would not benefit the
defense, any more than it would have in this case, then
many juvenile records will have to be revealed.

And of

course that will open somewhat of a breach in the juvenile
system structure, and there will be an attendant damage to
the system as such, and it will adversely affect many
juvenile witnesses who have juvenile — many witnesses who
havre juvenile records.

And it will especially affect

those who are still being rehabilitated at the time they

36

have to take the stand, such as was the case here with
Richard Green.
QUESTION:

Mr. Merriner, you began your statement

by saying if juvenile records have to be revealed in a case
that would not be of greater benefit to the defense then
in this particular case.

Are you suggesting, then, that

there be — that the rule should not be that a juvenile
record is always inadmissible on cross-examination of a
prosecuting witness for pxirposes of impeachment, but that
there be a ca3e-by-case rule in the balancing of how much
harm is done to the defendant by non-disclosure of the record,
how much damage would be done to the particular juvenile
by disclosure of the record, and so on?
Or are you telling — is that the rule which you
think the Court —
MR. MERRINER:
QUESTION:

I would, like to —

— tha ought to exist in this

constitutional area, or are you, on the other hand, saying
that there ought to be a per se rule that if a State has
expressed a public policy, as your State of Alaska has,
that juvenile records not be revealed, that that be the
end of it, that they never be revealed on cross-examination,
Is that what you’re telling us the rule ought to be?
Or are you, as your statement just suggested,
suggesting that there be a case-by-case evaluation, and a

37

balancing in each case, depending upon the specific
circumstances of each case?
MR. MERHINER:

I would argue for a personal rule

if I felt that. I analytically could.

But, take the

situation where a juvenile is told by his judge:

Now,

you finger somebody else who was with you there, and
testify about that, or else I'm going to send you away for
as long as I can.
If you had a situation like that, and you forbid
any questioning about his juvenile appearance, you know,
before that court, I can see that confrontation would be
denied.

Here ha had a definite motive, and assuming the

testimony is crucial, and assuming it’s not greatly
corroborated, to show that there would not have been any
doubts raised by further cross-examination.
QUESTION: But your Supreme Court didn't limit it.
MR. MERRINER:
QUESTION:

Excuse me?

Your Supreme Court did not limit the

per se rule,
MR. MERRINER: Well, I read the opinion as hedging
on the matter, yes.
QUESTION:

I think they did, in the sense —
Well, the rule that's before us doesn't

permit what you say, does it?
MR. MERRINER:

No, but —

QUESTION: Well, that's the only thing we have

30

before us.
MR. MERRINER:

Well, we do have the other rule

that I mentioned, about how -the interest of justice can
cause a rule not to be applied.

But the Alaska Supreme

Court, when it discussed this issue, a rather brief discussion,
but ■—
QUESTION:

On page 60a, at the bottom of the

page, they seem to be hedging a little bit in saying that
in tills particular case no great damage was done.
MR» MERRINER:

Yes,

Let me -- in footnote 40

on 59a, they start out with a case xdiere they say it stands
for this "juvenile record not admissible to impeach absent
special circumstances".
QUESTION:

Well, in that they’re citing what

the California case held.
MR. MERRINER:
QUESTION:

Yes, but in citing a case —

Well, you in — to come back to my

question of what your argument is to us in this case:

As

I understand it, -then, from your answer, and you tell me if
I'm wrong, that you concede that there may be cases where
a denial of the right of the defense counsel to ask a
prosecution witness about his juvenile record would be a
deprivation of the defendant's constitutional right,
MR. MERRINER:
would be —

Yes, but I wouldn't think they

39

QUESTION; Am I right about that or not?
MR. MERRINER:

Yes.

But I think these cases

would be very rare, and there will not be a great breach in
the juvenile secrecy structure, as such
QUESTION; These cases would be rare, and this is
not one of them?
MR. MERRINER:
QUESTION:

Is that it?

MR. MERRINER:
the judge tells him:

Yes.

in the case, for example, where

You get on the stand or you*11 be

sentenced more than you would be ordinarily.
Or a case like where there has been perjury that
has come out oil the stand and you've got to bring out the
juvenile record to show it.
QUESTION:

Cases like that.

Yes.

MR. MERRINER: Thank you, that's all I have, if
there's no other -QUESTION;

When the trial judge heard his answer,

that he had never been questioned, did that not — should
that not have suggested to the trial judge that here was an
area in which trie witness was not being completely candid
with the jury?
MR. MERRINER: Well, it should have suggested that
to Mr. Wagstaff, that it would come out like that.
QUESTION:

Do you think Mr. Wagstaff, then, should

40
have asked for an opportunity, out of the presence of the
jury, to pursue the cross-examination in some wav that
would lay a. foundation for an exception to the Alaska rule
on confrontation?
MR. MERRINER:
that.

Yes, he should have at least done

I don't think the judge had any duty to do it on

his own.

And, as I argue in that footnote, this was really

not an untruthful reply.

He had never been questioned

like that, as far as we know’’.

QUESTION:

He had never been questioned

Well, at the very least it was a very

ambiguous answer, wasn't it?
MR, MERRINER:

Yes.

It was ambiguous —

QUESTION: And you say it was the duty of defense
counsel to pursue that —
MR. MERRINER:

Yes.

I don't see why this Court

should focus upon that one question and say, Look, here
was obvious perjury -- when it has not even been raised in
the brief, it has not been raised until argument now.
And tlie lower court has had no chance at all to rule upon
that particular error, if that v^as error, that one point.
QUESTION:

Mr. Merriner, does Alaska practice

provide an opportunity to counsel who finds himself in the
position that Mr, Wagstaff did following the combined
answer of Mr. Green and the objection by the prosecutor and

41
the sustaining of the objection to the question, to at least
allow the party that asked the question and got what is
basically an answer to a question that has been ruled to be
impemissib3.e, and get -that answer stricken?
MR. MERRINER:

Yes.

QUESTION: So that he

isn1t both bound by the

answer and still precluded by the court's ruling from
following it up.
MR. MERRINER:

As far as I know, yes, he could

have argued that this was an unresponsive answer and I'm
not bound — he could have made that argument, and the
judge certainly, within his discretion, could have stricken
that.
QUESTION:
He said:

How could you say that was unresponsive?

Have you ever been questioned? and he said no.
MR. MERRINER: Well, okay, it certainly was

responsive.
QUESTION:

I'd have great problem with that.

MR. MERRINER;

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr.

Merriner.
Do you have anything further, Mr. Wagstaff?

42
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT II. WAGSTAFF, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAGSTAFF:

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.

Nov;, with respect to a follow-up on that particular
answer, whether that should have been done at trial, I
think we should look back to the court's initial ruling
when the protecti.ve order was asked for;

It was unequivocal,

it’s cited, the court said it didn’t want to go in this
area at all.

We were getting into -that area a little bit,

and that’s why, perhaps, it was not pursued at that time.
I don’t think that that particular question is
essential.

It’s another reason why cross-examination should

have been allowed on that particular issue.
Of course, we never know, again, what the crossexamination, what this record would have revealed; and
that’s the whole reason of permitting cross-examination.
QUESTION: Was there anything to prevent you from
asking the court to give you a hearing out of the presence
of the jury, to pursue your question on page 34, which,
at least, was very ambiguous, you’d agree, and then also
to develop what were the detailed conversations between the
police and this witness Green, between the time they first
contacted him and the day of -die trial?

To see if, for

example, there was any suggestion that if he didn't
cooperate, they would refer this to his probation officer or

43

other comparable

anything to prevent you from doing

that?
MR. WAGSTAFF;

I would say that what prevented me

from doing that was the court’s indication, when it ruled
on the protective order, that he essentially felt that his
juvenile record was inviolate.

That’s how I would answer

that questi.on, and do answer it.
QUESTION:

Well, he could preserve the

confidentiality of that by taking this kind of thing in
chambers, but on the record.
MR. WAGSTAFF:

That perhaps could have been done,

and, again, the reason why it was not

is because of how the

protective order was interpreted, and the force of it,
and the rapid objection and the sustaining of it.
Again, the critical issue are not these particular
questions, because we don't know what the answer would have
been to further cross-examination.

The critical point, the

essential point that we’re making is:

the jury was never

permitted to consider what pressure Green was

under when

he made the initial identification at the station house.
Mr, Merriner has urged what he characterizes as a
corroboration argument, in which he cites much evidence that
didn’t even go to the jury.
The proper test, as the Chief Justice suggested,
is harmless error.

A constitutional error was committed.

44
Was it harmless?
Can we say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that one
juror would not have been affected by this information.
And I submit that we cannot.
The jury was out seven hours, as it was.
The evidence that was cited

well, when we’re

dealing with harmless error, I think it should be kept in
mind that usually harmless error is referring to tainted
evidence, evidence that should have been kept out.

Is

there sufficient evidence to convict anyway, without this?
In this case, it’s exculpatory evidence that the
jury should have been made aware of.

In a little different

situation, I think this situation that was discussed in
1
?
the case of Gigiville, a 1971 case; would the jury have
been affected by this information?

Can we say beyond a

reasonable doubt that the jury would not have come in with
another verdict, that this would not have raised a
reasonable doubt in their mind?
And that in the corroboration argument, Mr. Merriner
cites facts again that were not even to the jury;

on a safe that matched a coat.

fibers

This information was

contained in an affidavit for a search warrant; never
submitted to the jury.

Rolls of bills in the search warrant;

never submitted to the jury.

Extension of the contract in

the affidavit for a search warrant; never submitted to the

45
jury.
QUESTION i

Extensiori was for the rental —-

MR. WAGSTAFF;

Of the rental agreement, yes.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. WAGSTAFF: These are not proper considerations
when we’re discussing harmless error; not, well, was this
person probably guilty?

Or looking at the evidence that

could have been presented, can we determine whether it's
sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt a guilt?
Because we don* t know these rulings, how the trial
judge would have ruled, whether this information is
admissible in the first place; whether, in fact, the fibers
did match.

Perhaps there was an identification by an FBI

expert that said they did not match.

We don’t know this.

So that information cannot be considered, and I
think it’s pretty clearly improper.
Harmless error is important, also, because the
crime —- it was burglary and larceny that he was convicted
of, not possession of stolen property.

All the information

that was, the incriminating evidence, if it can be
characterized as that, which really incriminated fir-. Davis’s
car, only indicated that there was stolen property in the
car, not that a burglary and larceny had been committed.
Because there were other fingerprints found at the scene,
not his.

And that's why Green’s testimony was particularly
essential, that he established a link in the prosecution’s
chain of evidence of recent possession, and his testimony
— absent his testimony there could not have been a
conviction.
QUESTION:

Nr. Wagstaff, are you contending for a

rule that would permit defense counsel to cross-examine
a juvenile prosecuting witness as to his previous record
in all cases, even though the State had a policy, such as
your State of Alaska has, of keeping such records
confidential; or are you simply telling us that in this
particular case it was important, to protect the
constitutional rights of your client?
MR. WAGSTAFF:
Stewart.

I’m saying both, Mr. Justice

I think that any time someone is testifying

against the accused in a criminal proceeding, that if they
have a juvenile record, the defense has a right to bring
this out, for whatever weight it might have to the jury.
That fact alone.

In some cases it could be very relevant.

For instance, in the Alford fact situation, that could be
very relevant.

But that’s for the jury to decide.

But we’re even one step more persuasive than
that.

Here we can show specific reason for why the juvenile

record should be brought out.
I think, in conclusion, that it’s —

47
QUESTION:

And yet to the Supreme Court of

Alaska you argued that your case was different.

You said,

as I understand it, that, yes, -the general rule is you
can't bring it out, but this case is special circumstances.
MR. WAGSTAFF:
QUESTION:

Yes, I argued —

Nov/, are you using that argument to

us, or are you arguing that the general rule that seems to
be conceded in the States is simply constitutionally v/rong?
MR. WAGSTAFF:

I argued both, Mr. Justice

Stewart, to the Supreme Court, as I'm arguing now, that it
should be all-owed to be brought out in all circumstances
when someone is testifying against the accused in a
criminal proceeding, unless it can be shown that there's
some really v/ild-fact situation, where it would be
terribly abusive.
But, absent that, it should be brought out and
let the jury determine whether this person in his own mind
v?ould have some hope of benefit of his position with the
prosecution, the government that's offering him as a witness.
That's for the jury to decide.
And again, in this case, it's much, much stronger,
because we can make a very persuasive argument to the jury
that he was under specific reason —
QUESTION:

The only State that has considered

this particular question, I gather from the briefs —- I

40

haven't gone beyond them — that only Michigan has adopted
your proposed —
MR. WAGSTAFF:

The per se rule, yes, Michigan

has adopted it.
QUESTION:

Is that right?

MR. WAGSTAFF:

Although the Mississippi case,

the Hamburg case, the court, the trial court there
permitted testimony, cross-examination showing that there
had been some supervision by juvenile authorities, but
they felt that the record itself should have been offered.
But, clearly, the Michigan court, the three cases
that I cited, have adopted a per se rule.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:46 o'clock, a.m., the case
in the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
