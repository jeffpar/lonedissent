Mr. Stipher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KARL J. STIPIIER, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER.
ME. STIPHER;

Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it

please the Court:
Twenty-one other lawyers and I, of the State of
Indiana, represent the. petitioner in this case, the Honorable
Cale J. Holder, Judge of the United STates District Court
for the Southern District of Indiana.
The general question presented to the Court today
involves the correctness of the order of Judge Holder
prohibiting William-Kunstier from representing a criminal
defendant,' Arthur Banks, in a case ponding in the Southern
District of Indiana.
On December 14, 1972, Banks, an innate of the
federal penitentiary at Terre Haute, was charged with
assaulting a guard at the institution.

Thereafter, on

March 21, Kunstler, an out-of-State lawyer who was admitted
to practice in New York, filed an application for leave to
appear on behalf of Banks.
At tiie request of the government, a Hearing was held
and Judge'Holder denied the application of Kunstler to repte-

&

sent ">•
Kunstler then filed a mandamus action against
Judge Holder in the United States Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit which ordered Holder to vacate his order and
to permit Kunstler to represent Banks.
A

petition for rehearing in the Banks case was

denied by the Seventh Circuit by a vote of 4 to 3, and then
this case cants to this Court.
Judge Holder denied Kunstler the right to represent
Banks in this case because of numerous delays in the trial
caused by Kunstler and because Kunstler, after being retained
as counsel for Banks, made statements to public audiences and
news media, in violation of the rules of ethics of the American
Bar Association, and in violation of Rule 27 of the District
Court.
The following statements were made by Kunstler to
public audiences and news media while this case was pending
in the Southern District of Indiana,
Kunstler said that his client, Banks, was assaulted
by the prison guards; that the charge against Banks was purely
retaliafcive, "a cheap little way of getting back at him for
being a troublemaker".
And, if you want to look at our brief on page 6, I'm
referring to the statements, where they're contained*
That Kunstler was certain that Banks was brutalized

by the guards; that it was a common cover-up tactic in order
to protect the guards to file charges against Banks; that
all the evidence is inside the prison walls, under the control
of the authorities who brought the charges against Banks;
"the word of a guard is always taken over that of an inmate";
that Banks got into all this' trouble because he doesn't act
like most of the black inmates who "Uncle Tom” it inside;
that there is a lot of antagonism against Banks because his
wife is white.
That Attorney Kunstler urged students at Terre
Haute to organize demonstrations in support of Banks and to
fill the courtroom with sympathetic spectators during the
trial;
That "Anything they can do to call attention to
the trial will be welcomed,

I am not asking them to Mow up

the courthouse but that would certainly draw attention,”
That Kunstler was quoted as being proud to be
ociated with Mar. Banks as he represents the finest of the
pacifist anti-war movement;
Tlfat Mr.. Banks is a black man who was sent to jail
for his beliefs in the value of human life and the dignity
of all the people at a time, when many who have much more to
defend chose alternatives to incarceration;
That Mr. Kunstler sees this indictment as a
political attack by the prime

--

by the prison administration

6

on an individual who firmly stands for his beliefs, who is
articulate and a spokesman for "Black Liberation and Pacificism',5
and therefore a threat to -the smooth-running oppression that
is so much a part of prison life in this country today;
That Mr. Kunstler is quoted as saying, "This case
typifies the strategy used to quiet dissent among inmates,
for the case is such that due process is virtually an
imp cs s lb i 1 i ty ,"
"The moment ha, Banks, went into prison he was
doomed."
"The only successful way to defend yourself against
charges such as those against Banks is by creating a complete
support group around the trial, that includes demonstrations
and making sure every court session has a full house and
listing celebrities who are interested in the case".,, and
Kunstler had a comment concerning draft evaders and the
granting of amnesty.
Those were the statements that were made by Mr.
Kunstler while tills case was pending for trial in the
Southern District of Indiana.
QUESTION;

They were made at various times and

places, were they?
MR. STIPHER:

They were to — some of the statements

were made at a meeting at Indiana State University at Terre
Haute, where the case is pending.

Some of these statements

7
were made, and they are so indicated in our brief, at the
Indianapolis Law School in Indianapolis before the law
students.

Other statements were made at press conferences

held by Mr. Kunstler in Indianapolis.

Others were statements

made on the radio concerning this case, and the ones that
I’ve gone over, now.
QUESTION:

They were all made in public, were

they?
MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION;

Oh, yes.
And during what period?

MR. STIPHER;

They were made prior to April 1st,

1972, when there was a hearing before Judge Holder, to
determine whether or not this man should be permitted to
represent the defendant.
QUESTION:

The incident in the prison occurred in

December of ’71, did it?
. MR* STIPHER:

Is that correct?
August of '71?

'72, Your Honor*

QUESTION: Well then, when was the charge brought
against him, the criminal charge?
MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION:

December of ’72, that was the charge.

I: U STIPHER:
QUESTION:

December 14, 1972.

Right.

And then there’s some difference of

opinion as to when Mr. Kunstler
MR, STIPHER:

;as retained, isn't there?

Yes, there’s some argument on the

8
record, but we’ll stand on the record as we have recited it,
and the defendant in this case, Banks, indicated at the
hearing under oath that he had retained Mr. Kunstler a month
before December of 1942, which would have been November —*
1972.

November of 1972.
There’s' some statement 'in the record as to when he

actually filed his appearance.

But the evidence, we believe,

will support the idea that Kunstler had been retained by the
defendant in November <5f 1972.
QUESTION: Before the charge was brought.
MR. STIPHERj

Right.

QUESTION: And then these statements, these various'
statements were made, you say they were all made in public, —
MR.* STIPHER:

Yes, in public, before the groups

that I’ve indicated to you.

While the case was pending and

prior to the hearing on April 1st, 1972, when all these matters
were brought out at the hearing,
QUESTION:
here made?

I see.

During

When was the earliest statement

I’m just trying to get — during what

period were these statements made?
.

3R:

.

511, I think the statements

■ /ere made generally from the first of -the year up until the
from January until April of 1972.
QUESTION:
MR. STIPHER:

All right.
Now, —

9
QUESTION:

To Indian audiences?

MR. STIPHER:

Yes.

Audiences in Indianapolis and

in Terre Haute.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. STIPHER:

After Judge Holder ruled against

Runstier, and while the case was pending in the Seventh
Circuit on mandamus, Kunstler made the following statements
at a speech at the Indiana University Law School in
Indianapolis:
"On a personal level I was deeply shocked by it
because it

the pending case involving respondent Banks —

was the first time in. any federal case that I ever heard a
United States District Judge deny an attorney the right to
represent the peison who desires his services.

It was done in

a cold and crass and criminal manner by a judge — Holder —
who, in doing so, committed a crime.
rights of a defendant.

He violated the civil

Under any ordinary set of circum­

stances, if the law was just and honest., he should be indicted
for what he did.

He violated his oath of office; he violated

his oath as a member of the profession, and he violated every
tenet of human decency in doing it."
"Write a letter to the judge, write a letter to the
newspapers.

Picket the courthouse, do anything that will

contribute to the issue,"
"There is a committee here for Arthur Banks and any-

10

one that wants any information about that can reach that
committee through the law offices of Barnhart and Allison,”
Then, following that, there was a taped interview
in which Mr, Kirns tier made the further remarks about Judge
Holder, who was the presiding judge at the trial •— or at
tills district where idle trial would be held, and has not yet
been held.
"The Judge -here, Judge Holder, has said', that he is
not going to permit me to appear in his Court, which means that
T can't represent Arthur Banks, which means that I am disbarred
as far as this Court is concerned, and he is doing it for no
good reason whatsoever, other than his own innate prejudice
against me."
"... it would seem to me any lawyer worth his or
her salt would be writing to the Editor, 'writing £0 the Bar
Association, writing to the Judge, writing to the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and saying, ’Look," here, we
may or may not agree with William Runstier, but that's not
the issue before us. The issue is, are we going to rape the
Constitution by allowing a Federal Judge to do what the
Constitution says he should never do, and that's to deprive
a defendant of his right to an attorney of his choice,"’
"I don't think anyone should respect the law, not
certainly as it's practiced in .America,"
”... It

— the law

is neither fair nor just,

11
because it’s manipulated and utilised ... And in its own
procedures and practices it’s unfair as well? built in,
deliberately, I think, into the system.

I think the best use

is to distrust it, strip it of all its mysticism; to
demonstrate, to fill courtrooms, to confront it.
”We would think nothing peculiar at all about
picketing Congress or picketing the White House — why not
picket the Court?
"I think that the only answer in all these systems
is con

ion.
QUESTION:

Physical confrontation."
Well, by the content of those statements

ou've just read, they apparently were made after Mr.
irons tier was denied the right to appear pro hac vice.
Mil. STIPHER:

That is right, Your Honor. They were

made afterwards.
QUESTION: So they couldn’t have been the reason
for the denial.
MR. STIPHER:

But I believe that they are

relevant and pertinent in tills case because the action of
mandamus that v;as filed in the Court of Appeals was an
original action.
QUESTION;

Unh-hunh.

MR. STIPHER:

All of this information that I just

read to you, including the remarks concerning Judge Holder
were a part of the record.

12
And, in addition to that, Your Honor, the findings
of Judge Holder not only found with respect to what had
happened, what was happening, but what was going to happen
in the future.

And Kunstler indicated, and I could give you

the record reference to it* that he intended to make further
statements in the future.
QUESTION: Well, I suppose Judge Holder's —
MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION:

Sc it seems to me «—

— findings were — his prediction was

what would happen in the future if he allowed Mr. Kunstler
to repr

Mr. Banks, not if he denied the right,
MR, STIPHER: Well, I think he -- that was further —

that was further basis for his findings,

I know he isn't

looking into a crystal ball, but what had been done would
indicate to him that — a further reason for him denying him
the right to appear was what he was going to do in the
future.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. STIPHER:

Now, after -that was done, Banks then

filed a habeas corpus proceeding in the same case before
another federal judge in our district, Judge Dillin.

And. this

case was still pending in the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit, involving Holder and Dillin.
Dillin denied the habeas corpus, because he felt that
it hadn't been made out properly and so forth and so on, and

13
Kunatier then undertook to make these further statements in
public about Judge Dillin;
"I think it's a frightful thing that has been done
to him, Banks, by the Government of the United States, the
American Bar Association" — and the reason he's complaining
about that is the American Bar Association has filed an
amicus brief in the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit "21 of the so-called prestigious Indiana lawyers who filed
against him," — and I guess I'm guilty of being one of
those -- "and a United States district judge by the- name of
Dillin, who is being sought to be impeached because of his
integration decree in Indiana and while I'd oppose his
impeachment on those grounds, I would wholeheartedly support
it for what he has done to this black man in Terre Haute.
He has violated his oath of office and he has denied this
man the most fundamental of rights."
I'm reading from the brief, I believe it's page 9.
*’ Ic has ignored his habeas corpuse.

He has

succeeded in stalling his case long enough for the Government
to catch up with Justice Rehnquist in Washington and to put
his case in limbo where it cannot move. And these who say to
American citizens, trust in the system and do not adopt
alternative methods, may some day remember this case along
with others when: people refuse to trust the system.

It's

about the worst instance in my career of some 25 years that

14
>ffman pales into insignificance

.

when you compare' him to Judge Dillin, because Judge Hoffman
was at least honest.

Judge Dillin is a fraud.

And, I think

he has done an enormous injustice to Arthur Banks and he
probably has done it because he is trying to avoid the anger
of the citizens of Indiana for his integration decree and so
he has decided to destroy Arthur Banks in order to get back
on the establishment's bandwagon.

It's a very sad and

desperate thing, I think, that a Federal judge will violate
his oath of office in this fashion, but I guess it's not
unexpected since the President of the United STates does it
regularly.
"Well, in this case, it's an alliance between the
United States government, the American Bar Association, the
Indiana Bar or what they call prestigious members of the
Indiana Bar and the Federal Judges in this District, Judge
Holder, Judge Dillin and others.
one feeds into the other.

And it's a vicious cycle,

It's a criminal conspiracy to

subvert the Constitution, And these men like Dillin and
»
.*•
Holder are criminals and it's just too bad that American
people don't recognise who the real criminals are in their
midst.

They are not in tine Terre Haute prison.’5
Now, admittedly, those statements he made attacking

our federal judges in 'the Southern District of Indiana
occurred after Judge Holder's hearing? but keep in mind this

15
man, his trial has not yet taken place.
And one of

ere’s going to be a trial.

And I think all these matters should be

were before the

Court of Appeals and should be before this Court, in making
a determination. as to whether or not Mr. Hunstier will be
able to represent this man during the trial.
Other reasons for denying Runstier the right to
participate in this trial, to represent him, have to do with
delays.,

We've covered that in our brief, and I won't bother

yoii With. that.
. -

Bn't"at issue here today, in addition to the

correctness of Judge Holder's ruling, is the validity of
Wule 2 7 and ‘the Canons of Ethics of the American Bar Associa­
tion.
QUESTION:

Mow, is it your position that -- or would

your position be the same if the judge had refused to permit '
a member of the Indiana Bar to represent Mr. Banks?
.

.

3R:

You betcha, Judge,

all to be treated the same on this.

f think we're

All I'm saying is,

and 1 would stand up with my last gasp of breath —■
QUESTION:

Would you think as a matter of — just

as a matter of power, a district judge has the power to eject
from his courtroom an attorney who violates the Canons of
Ethics over the objection of his client?
MR. STIPHER:

Yes, I do, Judge,

And let me state it

16

in a little different way, ~
QUESTION!

And so that the Sixth Amendment right
y

insel is conditioned \!;pon the counsel of his choice
complying with the Canons of Ethics?
MR. STIPHER:

That's right.

And we've got cases

to :uppert it.
QUESTION:

That's the issue here, isn't it?

Isn't

that tiie issue here?
MR, STIPHER:

Well, that's one issue, and then

there's
QUESTION:

Well, that's one —

MR. STIPHER:

the other issue, about these

statements, whether or not they're in violation of the
First Amendment.
QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals answered that

question the other way.
HR. STIPHER:

Yes, and we think the Court of Appeals

is wrong.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

I know you do.

MR. STIPHER: That's the reason we're here, and we
think the Court of Appeals was wrong in the Oliver case, and
we think the Court of Appeals is wrong in Chase v. Robson.
We think the correct.law is the law that was stated by this
Court in Sheppard v* Maxwell, in' which this Court said, after
reviewing all the publicity that was had in that case? the

17
Court said, and this is Justice Clark speaking on this part:
"The courts must take steps by rule and regulation
tliat will protect their processes from prejudicial outside
fcerferences.

Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,

the accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement officers
coming under the jurisdiction of the court should'be
permitted to frustrate its function.

Collaboration between

counsel and the press as to information affecting the fairness
of a criminal trial is not only subject to regulation, but
is highly censurable and worthy of disciplinary measures,"
And then the Court gets more specific and says:
"More specifically, the trial court might well'have
proscribed extrajudicial statements by any lawyer, party,
witness, or court official which divulged prejudicial matters,
■

■

t ■■

such as the refusal" —
QUESTION:

Well, that may be so, but didn’t —

that case didn’t suggest that if a lawyer violated an order
against making statements about a case that the lawyer could
.

O:,.

.i-a disqualified from representing the defendant,
MR. STXPHER:
QUESTION;

I think what the case means to me —
Didn't it?

• ME. STIPHSR:

Didn't it?

-« and you'll have to write on it to

see what it means, —
QUESTION:

Yes.

ME. STIPHSR:

•—- but I'll tell you what it means to

18
me. Judge, it means to me that this Court was saying in that
case that the district courts have got a right to adopt a
general rule which will set down the guidelines for the
conduct of a lawyer*
QUESTION:

Well, what did Judge Holder do, other

!

.

than to say that this man couldn't represent him?
Did he issue any order, of any kind?
MR. STIPHER:

Had a hearing, Judge, to determine

whether or not —
QUESTION: Did he issue —
MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION:

-» he had violated Rule 27.
Well, you say that Sheppard says you

have to protect the trial and prevent publicity, et cetera.
Did he issue any order about that?
MR. STIPHER:

No, Judge, because our rule does that.

Our Rule 27 very specifically, in our brief on page -«•
QUESTION:
Mr. Kunstler,

Well, did he at any time say anything to

r than "you can't come in"?

MR.STIPHER:

He had a hearing, Judge, and as a

result of this hearing —
QUESTION:

I know he had a hearing, -~

MR, STIPHER:

Right.

QUESTION:

and concluded from the hearing that

the best way to stop this is to keep this man out.
MR. STIPHER:

There were no other orders issued with

19

respect to this.
QUESTION: Well, he could have, couldn’t he?
MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor, but —■.

But he didn’t.

MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION:

He did not.
He took this way.

And, while I’ve

interrrupted you, so far as you know, is he still Mr. Banks'
choice as his lawyer?
MR. STIPHER;

Judge, I don't know.

You'll have

to ask the lawyer, I suppose, when they get up here.
QUESTION: Well, do you know of any change in the
situation?
MR. STIPHER:

I do not.

QUESTION: So far as you know, he still is.
MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION:

Right.
Now, what happens to the Constitution,

which says that he is entitled to the lawyer of his choice?
MR* STIPHER:

Well, I don't think the Constitution

has the words "of his choice", Judge.

I think that the

constiti11ionalprovision, I have it.before me -QUESTION:

I think you'll find some decisions

fch at s ay th at.
MR. STIPHER:

All right.

Maybe so.

But all I'm saying is that we have covered that in
our brief, where we say that you are not entitled, you do not

20

have a constitutional right to a lawyer of your choice.
You have a right to a lawyer, all right, but if the lawyer
violates the Canons of Ethics, as was done in the State v.
Kavanaugh case, a New Jersey case, he may be removed.

And

that one had to do with Hr. F. Lee Bailey, because of the
antics that he had engaged in in that case.
And we've covered that in the brief,

I think — ray

position on that is ~~
QUESTION:
me?

Well, I don't -- you say that binds

The decision in New Jersey binds me?
MR, STIPHER:

Well, I think it’s a very good

decision, and besides that, Judge, I think we have other
cases that we've cited in here.
QUESTION:

All right.

We also have the Seventh

Circuit.
MR. STIPIIER:
QUESTION:

In this case?
Yeah!

Hj , STIPIIER:

which I think is wrong.

The reason

7 think it's wrong is that it went off mainly on the question

of waiver, and then it also applied an erroneous test that
the statements that are made have to present a clear and
present danger to the prejudice of a fair trial in the
administration of justice.
It's our position that's not the correct test at all.
That the correct test is

was applied in the Tijerina case,

21
and in other decisions, is that there must be a reasonable
likelihood.

And that’s a test that was contained in the rules

of the American Bar Association,

which went through the

Raridan Committee, which went through the Judicial Conference
of -this Court, and were approved by the federal judges
throughout the United States.
QUESTION:

Has it ever been approved by this Court?

MR. ST I PI IS Pi;
V.

The rule's — well, only in so far as

Judicial Conference had approved it.
QUESTION:

It's persuasive.

MR. STIPHER:

That's all.

Right?

Well, I want to make ray position

clear, that it seems —- that it's our position here til at
under the Sheppard case, this Court said, after they
reviewed all the evidence in that case, "the courts must”,
■

.

they didn't say "should", "must make rules to cover this
situation.M
Then they went oh' to specify what kind of rules
they're talking about, thd

that have to do with commenting

on the merits of the case, and so on.
QUESTION:
QUESTION':

And your court made a rule?
Th at' s r igh t.

MR, STIPHER:

We made our rule

it's the same

rule in every federal district court in the United States,
■v

and it was a result of -the study by the American Bar
Association, after twenty minutes of — twenty months of fclie

22

•Raridan Committee, and after a study by the Judicial Conference
of tills Court, and approval by the Judicial Conference.
And this rule, I think identically, is in force in eve io­
di strict court of the United States.
QUESTION:
MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION:
MR. STIPHER:

So there was another committee, too?
All right.
That said'the same tiling.
Yes.

All I'm saying, is, what we' re

asking you to do here today, to tell these federal district
judges, what about this rule?

And as I say, and I'm sorry

to repeat, this thing started in this Court under the
Sheppard case.
This Court said, "you must adopt rules".

They did,

and here’s tills rule and, as I say, it's substantially the
same in every federal district court in the United States,
and

if it's in violation of the Sixth

whichwould

—* or, rather,

the First

Amendment, about the

~~

Amendment, I think this

Court ought to say so.
And if it isn't in violation of the First Amendment,
so that there's some guidance, some guidelines that will be
given to these federal judges throughout the United States,
that are

II vitally interested in this question.
QUESTION;

Mr. Stipher, in response to a question

from my Brother White, I understood you to say that it's
wholly insignificant and irrelevant in this case that Mr,

23
Kunstier was an out-of-State lawyer, that you'd be making
precisely the same argument ~~
MR. STIPHER;
QUESTION;

I would.

— just as strong if he were ai

Indiana

lawyer; is that correct?
MR. STIPHER:

I would.

Absolutely.

QUESTION:

Thank you.

QUESTION:

Mr. Stiphsr, Mr. Banks has since beev

released by some other judge, hasn't he?
MR. STIPHER:

They would be in a much better-

position to’ tell you that, but that's my understanding, that
he has been ■— he was transferred from the Terre Haute
prison to the federal penitentiary in Sandstone, Minnesota,
and that while Mr, Kunstier was out there in the Wounded Knee
case, he made a presentation to a federal judge and had -.
got this man released on bond on this particular charge.
But that a mandamus action has been filed —
QUESTION:
MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION;
MR. STIPHER;

On this -- on this particular charge?
Yes.
The very charge that's involved here?
Yes.

Yes.

No trial, of course.

has been held yet.
But that mandamus action has been filed by the
government before the Court of Appeals out there to contest
the validity of this District Court’s ruling.

Was that just an action enlarging him

QUESTION;

MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION;

Well, —
Or you don’t know?

MR* STIPHER:

OPAL ARGUMENT OF MORTON STAVIS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. STAVIS:

Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it

please the Courts
At -the outset I'd like to settle a few of the
questions that arose in the course of my adversary’s argument.
In answer to the questions of Mr. Justices Rehnquist
and Brennan', Mr, Banks is here.
row.

He's seated in the front

He was released on bail by the United States District

Court in Minnesota in. a habeas corpus proceeding, which dealt
with questions as to incarceration based upon his prior
conviction, as well as certain questions which dealt with
the question of his present indictment.
QUESTION:

That's the underlying conviction,

criminal conviction?
MR. 3TAVI3s

That's right, sir.

Mr. Kunstler was his attorney in that matter, and
in view of the fact the Government of the United States trough
a habeas — brought a mandamus before the Eighth Circuit,
Judge Lord in that case requested Mr. Kunstler to represent
him as respondent in the mandamus proceeding.

Mr. Kunstler

is now representing Judge Lord before the Eighth Circuit.

26
An order ha;::

-:«n handed down by the Eight». Circuit, under

date of April 19th, 1974, requiring filing of briefs and
setting a hearing there on June 10th, 1974, at which Mr.
Kunstier expects.to represent Judge Lord.
QUESTION:

What's the. issue, Without going into

details?
MR. STAVIS:

Well, the issue was .that, among other

things, with respect to the prior incarceration, Mr. Banks
had been kept in solitary confinement for approximately
eighteen month's.
QUESTION: But the issue has nothing to do with
f

Mr.i Kunstier's representation as such.’

None whatsoever.
That's what I thought.

But those developments, Mr. Stavis,

have no bearing on Idle issue we have to decide here?

MR. STAVIS:

I don’t believe

I don't .believe

they do, excepting with respect to one question that was also
as to which my adversary said he didn't know the answer; that
is, that Mr. Kunstier indubitably represents Mr. Banks.
I - spoke to Mr* Banks during the luncheon recess, but I dicin'
really have to, he. has said -that the last thing in the world
that he intends to do is to altar his relationship with Mr.
'Kimstier, the man to whom he now owes his freedom.

27

Iro like now to turn to some of th?: questions that
Mr. Jus tic

nd

answers that

onse of tho rather confusing

thought had been given, in response to those

questions.
y
♦

Mr,. Kunstier was not retained until February - 3th, 19 73.
That was*the first time that Mr. Kunstier ever met Mr. Banks,
and, whatever the record may show as to prior statements by
;• V*Al
V
' •

.

Mr. Banks, that he had retained a Mr. Bluroberg, to whom he
haa paid a fee, and also Mr. Kuna tier in some secondary
capacity to Mr.•Blumberg? the fact of the matter is the
first time Mr; Kunstier met Mr. Banks and accepted the
retainer was on February 9th.
Secondly, there was not a continuous range of
statements from January 1st up until April 1st, 1373.

All

of the statements which appeared in the record, all of them,
are attached to our brief, and they consist of the following:
No. 1.

An interview sought out by a newspaper

reporter in. Indianapolis, Indiana, at a cocktail party, which
Mr. Kunstier attended, the result of which was an item
appearing in the Indianapolis Star on February 10th, on page
31.

There was not a shred of proof that that newspaper was

distributed in Terre Haute, Indiana, 95 miles away; and,
moreover, — and we think this is of particular importance —
Terre Haute has separate jury rolls from Indianapolis.
Secondly, *—

Are they in different districts,

QUESTION:
judicial districts?
MR. STAVIS;

Yes.

Different divisions within the

district.
QUESTION:

Different divisions of the same district

MR. STAVIS:

That's right, and separate jury rolls

and we refer to that •— we cite that in our brief.
QUESTION':

You're now talking about Exhibit A on

page la of the Appendix to your brief?
MR, STAVIS:

That's right.

That's the statement,

that's the interview at 'the cocktail party.
The second item is a press release issued at an
organization in New York on the same day, February 3th, with
no proof whatsoever that it ever got anywhere near Terre
Haute, Indiana.
The third item is a one-minute statement by a TV
reporter, which does not purport accurately to quota Mr.
Kunstler, and which refers to a speech that Mr, Kunstler made
again on February 9th.
The last item was an item which appears in Time
magazine, under date of February 26, 1973, which contains the
one-sentence harmless statement by Mr. Kunstler; it has a
whole paragraph of a statement by Mr. Carlson, the Director
of the Federal Bureau of Prisons within the Department of
Justice, stating the government's view of the case against

having its office in New York.

It was a fund-raising

committee on behalf of Arthur Banks.

There's no proof whatsoever in this

record that a copy of this ever got into Terre Haute, Indiana,
or that any portion of this ever got to a newspaper which was
published in Terre Haute, Indiana.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS;

How did it get in the record?
The judge said, "I’ve got this", and

handed it to the government counsel.

The judge never explained

how he get it.
QUESTION;
MR. STAVIS:

Unh-hunh.
Now, you're also told by my

adversary, without reference to the record, that Mr. Kunstler

30
threatened or promises to continue to
We’ve yet to find that in the record.

There's nothing of

that sort in the record at all.
And that, of course, gets us to the question which
Mr. Justice Marshall asked, which is:

Did -the judge issue

any other order, other than the barring of Mr. Kimstier?
And the answer is no.

The hearing of April 1st

consisted of the introduction of these items,mostly furnished
by the judge to counsel for the government, and then the
judge put the axe down and said to Banks:

You can't have

Kunstier as your lawyer.
At no time did the judge say, "I want you to know,
Mr. Kunstier, that's the rule in this District, if you're
going to come in this court, you're going to have to abide
by those rules."
In fact, there was a discussion on the record with
respect to the law of the Seventh Circuit at that time, as
expounded in the case of ■Chase v. Robson.

I wish my colleague,

the Reverend — Father Cunningham was counsel in that case.
And it was clearly enunciated by the. Seventh Circuit that a
rule proscribing speech by counsel could not be adopted
unless and until there had been a finding that such a.
rule was necessary in that, case, in order to avoid interfering
with tlia processes of the court.

felt bound by Chase v. Robson, and he indicated that if the
edge felt, made a finding, then at least the parties could
then proceed to litigate the matter in the Seventh Circuit,
which is exactly what they had done in Chase v. Robson.
There is not anything in the record from which it
could be concluded that Mr. Kunstler said, "1 am going to
continue to make those statements, even if you impose such a
prohibition based upon a’finding" or even if the judge had
said, "Well, the Seventh Circuit decision to the contrary
notwifchstending, 1 say that you shall not make statements."
Nothing in toe record to indicate that Mr. Knnstler
ever would have violated such an order.
Mow, we —»
QUESTION;

There was a Paile 27 — is that toe

MR. STAVIS:

Yes, there was a Rule 27.

QUESTION; And we were told earlier by counsel that
that rule has a counterpart in every district court —
MR. STAVIS:

MR. STAVIS;

I believe that to be the case.
~~ in the country.
I believe that’s — that to be the

case.
QUESTION:

And presumably a lawyer who, even if he

hadn't practiced before in this district court would know

32
about that rule, wouldn't he?
MR. STAVISs

■

.3.

The lawyer

practicing in the

Seventh Circuit would also know, that" the Seventh Circuit
dealt with precisely that problem and made its adjudication,
which was in fact binding on all of the district courts in
the Seventh Circuit, that the implementation or application
of such a rule would have to await a finding by the court
that it. was necessary in the particular case,
And I also point out, Your Honor, that the district
court had adopted not only Rule 27 but also Rule 29, which
we reprinted in our own brief, because Rule 29 is the rule
which provides, in fact, for a mechanism and a procedure for
the court making a finding in a particular case that a
proscription is‘ necessary, and then tailoring the proscription
to the needs of that case,
QUESTION:

Mr. St avis', is it your submission that

Rule 27 is not operative without this advance finding in the
Seventh Circuit?
MR, STAVISs

That is our submission, and that was

the finding and holding of the Seventh Circuit, both in
Chase y. Robson and again repeated by its holding in this
particuIar case.
QUESTION:

You referred to a colloquy between —

I think I understood you to refer to a colloquy between
Mr. Hunstier and Judge Holder about that Seventh Circuit case.

33

MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.
That's in your brief somewhere, I think.

MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.
I was trying to find it — I remember

reading it, but I can't —
MR. STAVIS:

Ch, yes.

Well, I think you will find

it at page 19.
QUESTION:
MR. STAVIS:

Thank you.
It starts on the bottom of page 18.

There are actually two colloquies on this, one of them is
set forth beginning at the bottom of page 18 and going over
to the top of page 19, and the other appears in the footnote
on page 19.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. STAVIS:

Thank you.

Now, having dealt with those questions,

I would like at this point to turn to another aspect of our
argument, and that is that two clays after "the

" Mr. Banks

filed his petition for writ of mandamus with the Seventh
Circuit, and one day after Judge Holder filed a responsive
pleading to that, he filed it actually the day after the
mandamus was filed, the Seventh Circuit ordered that there
be filed with it the transcript of the entire proceedings
which actually had been held before Judge Holder.
That was done.

And it was based upon a study of that

transcript the Seventh Circuit decided this particular case.

34
And one of the difficulties that I think has been had in this
case is that petitioner's brief and his argument this morning
completely ignores the existence of that transcript.
Because it's only there that one begins to find out
the. reality of what this case was about, and it's because of
that conviction, of the decisive nature of the content of that
transcript, that; we caused to be Xeroxed and filed with the
Clerk of the Court, with delivery to each of the Justices, a
copy of that transcript.
Of course, it's at that particular point — it's
at that particular point that you begin to see that v/hat the
case involved was far beyond different from the statements of
my adversary as to these innumerable statements which finally
boiled down to a series of statements on February 9th.
The issue which emerged in that particular transcript
was there was an extraordinary colloquy between Judge Holder
and Mr. Kunstler, in which Judge Holder forced Mr. Kunstler
to disclose his views on a number of matters having nothing
to do with this particular case, matters having to do with
the draft, amnesty, and questions of that sort? having
forced the disclosure of these views in open court, Judge
Holder then turned to Mr, Banks and said:

"Do you want a

monkey on your back?"
The monkey being Judge Holder's estimate of Mr,
\

Runstier's views.

>

35
In a rather eloquent statement, which appears in
•'die transcript, Mr. Banks made absolutely clear that he
carried many monkeys on his back before, that lie knew exactly
what Mr, Xunstier's views were, and he wished him to be his
lawyer.
Following that, Judge Holder decided that Banks was
not to have Hr. Kuristler as his lawyer, but, rather, another
person selected by Judge Holder, whom he described as having
>clivities and operations with which I agree."
And Banks said he was going to stand mute? he
wanted the lawyer of his choice.
Now, it seems pretty obvious to us that a lawyer
of a defendant’s choice is not a lawyer of the judge’s choice.
And thq. fact that the judge may find another lawyer in
Indianapolis or Terre Haute, whom he would like to have
represent Mr. Banks, can’t be allowed to pass in the face of
the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of one’s choice.
QUESTION:

Mr. St avis, does the record show anything

of the practice, either in Judge Holder’s court or generally
in that District Court, of admissions of attorneys pro hae
vice in cases?
MR, STAVIS:

There’s nothing in the record with

respect to that, although the rule provides for routine
admission, pro had vice.

That rule is quoted in our brief,

and provides for routine admission.

36
QUESTION:
MR. STAVISj

That is Rule —
I'm sorry?

QUESTION:

Do you have the page citation?

QUESTION:

— 29, is it?

MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:
QUESTION;
MR. STAVIS;

I think it's 45.
That’s the footnote, isn’t it?
I think it’s the footnote on page 4.5.
That's right.

It goes over to page

it's the last portion of (c), ”an attorney admitted to practice
in any other United States court may, on application to this
court, be granted' leave to appear in a specific action.
And" .there's nothing in the record which suggests any
practice with respect to this matter.
Now, it seems to us that based upon tills record,
and of course that's what -the Seventh Circuit locked at when
they made their decision, and they said that in view of the
court, Judge Holder's indication that he claimed concern for
Mr. Banks' interest, that there was no basis for overriding
Mr. Banks'

pression of desire that he be' represented by

counsel of his choice, regardless of Judge Holder's disagree­
ment with his views.

,' "

Well, of course, none of that is indicated in the
brief or the argument of our adversary, but it's fully and
entirely and completely laid out in our brief, and we had
no choice but to file the extended and detailed statement of

facts, in order that the Court would get the entire picture
in this case.
Having made it clear on the record why Mr. Banks
was denied Mr. Kunstler * s services, the following day Judge
Holder entered what he called an entry, in which he purported
to give reasons why he denied Mr. Banks the right to have
Kunstler as his counsel.

He gavet a series of reasons.

One

is the possibilities of delay in the trial.
There's absolutely no foundation for it whatsoever.
There was no indication whatsoever that had this case been
heard in May, as it had been specified — May of 1373, that
is — with Mr. Kunstler as his lawyer, and it was clear on
the record on April 1st that Mr, Barnhart was then full co~
bounce1 with Mr. Kunstler.

Absolutely nothing to indicate

that Mr. Kunstler would not have proceeded to try that case
in May, or if, for some reason, Mr. Kunstler was not avail­
able, the case might not have proceeded with Mr. Barnhart
alone, particularly if Judge Holder said, "i'll let you in,
but if you're not here the case is going ahead anyhow."
Absolutely nothing to support any indication of
delay.
QUESTION:

What do you think the issue here is, Mr.

Stavis?
MR. STAVIS:

It's a simple issue of the Sixth

Amendment right to counsel.

I think that's the whole case.

38

QUESTION:

But what —• are we reviewing the

judgment of the Court of Appeals?
MR. STAVIS;

That’s right.

The judgment of the

Court of Appeals was that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel
transcended all the other matters in this case, and they
directed, on this particular record, that Mr. Banks —

QUESTION:

That's what I wondered.

Do you think

we have a — if it's a factual question and we are just going
to be reassessing the Court of Appeals, that might be one
matter.

But if we have an issue of law here of some kind,

why, that might be another.

Do you think there’s an issue

of law here that -—
MR. STAVISi

Well, one of the issues of law that

was handsomely conceded this morning, namely, any suggestion
that there was any more power of a court with respect to
out-of-district counsel than there was with reaped- to -indistrict counsel.
QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you this.

Is there any

— is there contention in the case that a judge must permit
a lawyer to continue to represent a client if the lawyer
stood up in open court and said, "I know the rules of the
court, I concede their validity, but I have no intention of
following them"? is that an issue here?
MR. STAVIS:

No, I don't think that's in issue

here, because it seems to ms that there isn't any question that

the eour' . reserve, and have, the -power- to discipline counsel
for violation of rules.
QUESTION:
MR, STAVIS:
QUESTIONs
MR. STAVIS;
QUESTION?

And despite the Sixth Amendment?
Well, I suppose the Sixth Amendment. —
That's my question,
Yes, I understand,
Now, 'if the attorney- gets up and says,

"You've told me to do something, I'm not. going to do it; I
know the rule of the court, I'm hot going to obey it."

Now,

would the Sixth Amendment require the court to permit him
to continue?
MR. STAVIS:

It might depend, because the court

"might decide that the dereliction by the lawyer in that
particular case did not merit immediate suspension.
QUESTION: But there could be circumstances that,
where, I suppose, that would override the Sixth Amendment
right to counsel?
MR. STAVIS;

It could be to this extent, the Sixth

Amendment gives you right to counsel, it doesn't give you
right to non-counsel*
QUESTION;
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

That's righ t.
And I suppose you —
Mr. Stavis, getting back to Justice

White's original question,

What's before us?

What's

before us is m order of the Court of Appeals granting

40
mandamus.
MR. STAVIS:

That's right.

QUESTION: And if I read this correctly, ahd I have
not read the application for the writ, the only question
submitted was alleged prejudicial publicity, as the basis
upon which the order of the District Court rested, and that•
that ought suffice.
And as I read this short opinion of the Court of
Appeals, it says that, in summary, we believe the defendant
Banks has waived any right to object to Attorney Runstier’s
course of pretrial publicity as denying him a Sixth Amendment
right to a fair and impartial jury.
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

That's right.
And, accordingly,the mandamus is granted

Well, that's a rather narrow issue that the order
presents, isn't it?
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

That's right,

.And we —-

Do we have to get into all these far-

reaching questions that you and your adversary have been
arguing?
QUESTION:

It doesn't have to — on that approach,

That's right, and Banks is entitled

I don't think there's any question

that the decision here can be most limited in nature,
limited to the order of the Seventh Circuit, which was that

counsel, of his choice, and if there was any question in the
judge's mind that counsel's conduct might have adversely
affected Banks' chances, that Banks had waived it., and —

QUESTION:

Well, may I suggest, I have some

difficulties with that, Mr. Stavis.

I'm looking at page

46, the last paragraph, in which the Court of Appeals said,
in considering the broader issue:

We conclude that before

a trial court may properly limit, the defendant's right to
a chosen counsel, there must be sufficiently supported and.
specific findings of fact that the conduct of the defendant’s
\

attorney creates a serious and imminent threat of, quote,
"significant prejudice to the defendant himself" — which
'was precisely the issue considered in the original opinion
or of, quote, "disruption of the orderly processes of
justice unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular
case.
So if they treated with another issue besides that
of prejudice to the defendant himself, it was limited to the
second, the disruption of the orderly processes, was it not?
MR. STAVIS:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
I suppose, then, we — the validity of

that standard and the factual underpinning for it, at least,
arc here.
MR. STAVXS:

It could be.

It could be.

But, candidly, as we've stated in our brief, we
do not believe that the Court need go to that

need go to

that point in deciding this case.
For the following reason, among others;

this would

be a vary inappropriate case, we would think, to deal with the
effort to make all the radical, broad and sweeping changes
in the whole question of the relationship between members of
the bar and. the media.
The sort of problems that were originally suggested
in Sheppard v. Maxwell, that are covered in the Raridan
Committee report and again in the; Kauffman Committee report,
find while it may very well be that these rules have been
>pted in all district courts, as Mr. Justice Marshall points
out, they’ve never been passed upon by this Court.
That would effect a most significant change in the /
listory of a hundred and fifty years.

It goes back to the

impeachment trial of Judge Peck, and a series of cases
determined by this Court following that, Craig v. Har.ney_f
Bridges v. California, going right down to last month when it
decided the case of Eaton v. Jin Is a.
I simply suggest that if the Court is to enter into
a consideration of the extraordinarily complicated First

45
Amendment issues -that are involved there, it oughtn’t to do
so in a case which is so weighted with Sixth Amendment
questions.
Of course, nobody had ever dreamt that any procedure
that a court might employ to control expressions by counsel
would be enforced by any means other than the discipline of
counsel.

And to have that issue come before this Court for

the very first time in a case which is so easily determined
nn the issue of right of counsel, I would suggest would be
most unfortunate,
QUESTION 5

l)o you suppose a defendant in a criminal

case in a State court in Ohio has a constitutional right to
have a lawyer who is a member of the bar of California only?
MR. STAVIS:

Well, I would think that the question

in the State courts would be quite different, or might be
quite different than the question in the federal courts.
And I don't think that the Court, in deciding this
case, in respect to its supervisory power over the federal
courts, would have to adjudicate any question with respect to
State courts.

That would simply —

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KARL J. STIPHER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STIPHER:

May it please the Court:

I think I’ve got five minutes.

But I would.like to

urge you, if I may, to pass on all these questions that have
been raised.

Rule 27 has

QUESTION:

Lawyers come here all the time and ask

us to pass on all the broad questions in the universe, but
we'd never get anything done if we did that, so don't
MR. STIPHER:

•

But in this case we do have this

Rule 27 that has quite a history to it, as T mentioned
before.

It was set down in the Sheppard case that the courts

ought to adopt the rules.

Rule 27 is now before this Court,

end. mainly the court did not permit Mr, Runs tier to come in
because he felt he had violated Rule 27,
QUESTION; Well, did you ■— I don't see that the

Court of Appeals has said that .. or even held, that it is
proper or improper to disqualify an attorney for violating
Rule 27.
MR. STIPHER:
QUESTION:

Well, the —
Is that the -- was that a reason given

by Judge Holder that
MR, STIPHER:
QUESTION:

That was part of his findings.
Well, that —

MR. STIPHER:

Part of his findings that he had,

that Kunstler had violated Rule 1(f), which incorporates the
Canons of Ethics of the American Bar, and Rule 27,
QUESTION:

But. that doesn't, seem to be the issue

that the Court of Appeals -thought was presented to it.
MR. STIPHER;

Well, we felt the Court of Appeals

tried to dodge the issues in the case, to be very frank.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. STIPHER:

And tried to put the first opinion,

as they did, purely on the matter of waiver.

And when we

filed our petition for rehearing, we raised these other
questions.
QUESTION:

I see.

MR. STIPHER:

And then they saw fit to file a

supplemental opinion, in which they
QUESTION:

spoke about it.

And they still didn’t face up

to the

issue you ~~ that you say you really were presenting?

R. STIPHER:

Well, I think not.

But all I'm

saying is that we believe the issue was in the case, and
they dodged it*

And I think it is in ’the record in this case.

And I think the two important constitutional questions here
are by violation of the Sixth Amendment,

whether you're

entitled to a lawyer of your own choice by the Sixth
Amendment, and a violation of the First Amendment are
involved in this case.
Arid 1 would hope ’ ~~
QUESTION:

What do you think, Mr. Stipher, with

the last paragraph-of the opinion on rehearing?
This goes to the disruption of idle orderly processes
of justice, and so forth.

Our independent review of the

record reveals that the hearing did not include this broader
issue 'within its focus.

That the evidence with- respect to

the statements which could, be deemed improper would not
support such a conclusion.
)::r. STIPHER;
Appeals on that.

*

Wall, we disagree with • the pourt of

.

We think when you look at the record

in this case that you will find that the findings are supported
by the evidence, and that the issues that we. talked about are
involved.
QUESTION:

Now, if we — I suppose we must disagree

with thorn on this record, then, to reverse, I guess,
MR". STIPHER;

I tliink you're going to have to look

50
at the record to see. whether the- questions that we raised are
presented by the record.
The only other thing 1 would like to suggest is
with respect to the whole question here that we're talking
about generally# about trie lawyer and what his function is
and obligation to meet up with the ethical requirements of
the profession.
I call your attention to the quote from Frankfurter’s
opinion in In re Sawyer# when- he sort of sums up this whole
situation and says:

Certainly courts are not and cannot be

immune from criticism, and lawyers of course may indulge in
iticism.

Indeed, they are under a special responsibility

to exercise fearlessness in doing so.
But when a lawyer goes before a public gathering
and fiercely charges that the trial in which he is a partici­
pant is unfair, that the judge lacks integrity, -the circum­
stances under which ha speaks not only sharpen what he says,
but lie imparts to his attack inflaming and warping
significance.
He says that the very courtroom in which he walks
to plead his case is a travesty, that the procedures and
reviews established to protect his client from such conduct
>re a sham,

do matter how narrowly conceived -this rule may

be, it has been betrayed by a lawyer who has engaged in the
kind of conduct here found by the Hawaii court.

51
QUESTION:

Was that the prevailing opinion in

Sawyer?
HR, STIPHER;

No, it was a dissenting opinion.

[Laughter.3
QUESTION:
MR. STIPHER:

Yes.
Certainly this Court, tlie supreme

tribunal charged with maintaining the rule of law should
be the last place in which these attacks on the fairness
and integrity of a judge in the conduct of a trial should
find constitutional sanction.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:
