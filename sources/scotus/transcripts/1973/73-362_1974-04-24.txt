Mr. Sachse?
ORAL ARGUMENT OP HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ., ON
BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, APPELLANT
MR. SACHSE:

Mr. Acting Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on appeal from decision of a threejudge District Court, for the District of New Mexico enjoining
the Secretary of the Interior from enforcing the employment
preference for Indians in the Bureau of Indian Affairs required
by the Indian Reorganisation Act of 1934, and other preference
acts.
The appellees are non-Indian employees of the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, acting individually and as bring a class
action, who claim to have been denied promotion because of the
preference.

They argue that preference laws are unconstitu­

tional under the Firth Amendment, that they have been taoidlv,
I suppose, repealed by the Equal Employment Opportunities Act
of 1972 - and that in any event they are being interpreted too
broadly by the Secretary of the Interior.
The court held that the acts had been repealed by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972.

The court said that

it could hold that the acts were also unconstitutional but that

5
it did not so hold and, because of its holdings on these points,
it didn’t have to reach the issue of the breadth of the appli­
cation of the acts .
The infcervenor in this case is Amerind, an association
of Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who have
the preference that is under attack here.
This case concerns the exercise by the federal govern­
ment, by the Congress of the United States, of its trust re­
sponsibility to tribal Indians, and its effort to provide them
an opportunity for self-determination and self-help.

I think

that I can show to you that it is not a racial discrimination
involved in this case at all, but a determination to have the
people whose property and lives are affected by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs have prominent roles in the Bureau of Indian
Affairs.
Since we are talking about a preference in the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, I think it is important for both issues of
the case to give some facts about the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
I think it is not well understood.
There are only some 300 employees of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs in Washington.

There are some 2,000 others in

offices in Indian areas of the country, in Denver, Albuquerque,
Billings, Montana, Phoenix, Muskogee, Oklahoma, and other
places.

These are the administrative —
Q

Isn’t there some on the reservations?

6

MR. SACHSE:

Yes, I was about, to get to that.

takes —- this is some 2,300 that I have spoken of.

That

Then there

are 11,500 employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who actu­
ally work on the reservations, and these are not people in some
sort of high administrative jobs; these are the policemen on .
the reservations, the foresters who tend the Indian forests,
irrigation workers, engineers, teachers — a good number of them
are teachers — bus drivers, social workers, employment
assistance personnel, house builders — there is a housing pro­
gram going on ■— and then there are a lot of employees who are
in a kind of work program as a substitute for welfare program
where simply things that need to be done are done through hiring
the people who live there to do it.
Q

Do you have any statistics on the comparison of

the number of Indians with the number of employees in the Bureau
of Indian Affairs?
MR. SACHSE:

Yes.

In the record, the total number of

Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs is 57 percent,
1 believe it is, which is a rise from some 40-some-odd percent
twenty or thirty yearrs ago.
Q

Well, what I meant was the total number of em­

ployees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs as compared to the
total number of Indians.
MR. SACHSE:
Q

Yas.

Oh, in the Nation?

7
MR. SACHSE:

Well, there are about 600,000 Indians

under direct regulation or supervision or assistance from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, and there may be another 400,000 who
would say that they are Indians but who are not affected by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Those are rough figures, about

600,000.
Q

The total is a million?

MR. SACHSE:

I think there are about a million people

who answered the last census and said that they were Indians.
But there was
Q

310

precise definition for that —

600,000 are reservation Indians?

MR. SACHSE:

About 600,000 who are members of federal­

ly recognized tribes, either live on reservations or off reser­
vations but have property that is being managed by the Bureau
of Indian Affairs.
Q

And I think that those 600,000, as you see it,

are entitled to the preference in this case?
MR. SACHSE:
see it.

That is correct,

it is not just as

1

The Chief Personnel Officer of the Bureau of Indian

Affairs testified in the trial of this case.

He testified that

the preference is limited to Indians who are members of federal­
ly recognized —
Q

That is the way they are administering it?

MR. SACHSE:

That's right, but it is not contested

this time, that that is the way they are administering it.

8
Q

But the statute may be broader?

MR. SACHSE:

The statute is capable of a broader inter

prstation but we think that this is the correct interpretation.
Q

But whether it is or not, that issue isn’t here,

is that right?
MR. SACHSE:
Q

That is correct.

There was on® sentence you didn’t quite finish.

Was -the last word tribe?
MR. SACHSE;

I am not sure which sentence it was.

The

last word was probably "tribe."
Q

Okay.

I wanted to be sure what your position

was, and it
MR. SACHSE;

Our position is that an Indian does not

have preference unless he is a member of a federally recognizee
Indian tribe and also is of at least one-fourth Indian blood.
Q

Incidentally, while I have you interrupted, the

Equal Employment Opportunity Act has some exceptions in it,
doesn’t it, Mr. Sachs©?
MR. SACHSE;

0.

Yes, it does.

But it makes no exception for Indians or the

Indian preference laws.
MR. SACHSE:

Do you have any explanation for that?
I do and I would like to say this,

though, that I would like to spend most of my time, if I can,
on t-

3

statement of the case and the constitutional issues here,

and Mr. Sherman is prepared to deal in detail with the Equal

9
Employment Opportunities Act of 1972.

But rather than leave

this hanging, the Act describes in some detail the outer limits
of section 717 cf the Act, which is the issue here, describes
in some detail the outer limits of the Civil Service Commission's
authority, and it is this agency but not that agency to trace
'that.
For instance, there is a problem with the General
Accounting Office.

There is no question that the Act intends

to have its broad outer scope cover everything in Civil Service,
but there is a specific exception to the Civil Service law,
which X will explain,for this Indian preference.

In fact, the

Indian preference statute itself says this shall be so without
regard to the Civil Service law, and was done quite deliberately
that way and has been handled that way.
Now, I want to go back for a minute and talk about
the reason for the Indian preference statute.

When —- the sort,

of romantic period of Indian law is the period before 1880, but
by 1380 Indian wars were about over, the Indians had been con­
fined to .reservations, they had been put. on reservations gen­
erally that didn't give them enough water or land or resources
to provide for their livelihood, so they became, in fact as veil
as xn legal theoryf

wards of the federal government.

If

the federal government didn't feed them in those days, they
i
didn't eat.

There simply wasn't enough to go around.

And

i

there was an increasing period of federal responsibility for

10
the Indian tribes, though the Indians had been promised in every
treaty that they would have a certain level of independence and
that though we can't say today that they are sovereign nations,
there is some concept of sovereignty behind that, as Mr. Justice
Marshall said in the McClanahan case.
But what happened under this period of federal super­
vision and care was devastating to the Indian tribes, and by
1934 it had become one of the greater national scandals.

In

•the 1930’.s, after fifty years of guardianship, both the adminis­
tration and Congress decided that there had to be some complete­
ly new system for handling Indian affairs.

The Commissioner of

Indian Affairs, Colliers, testifying in Congress in 1934,
pointed out that during the years between 1880 and 1934, during
the years when the federal government had the most responsibil­
ity, the wars were over, that the Indians had been — and these
are his words — "drifting towards complete impoverishment,
that they had been disorganized as groups, literally disorganize
by the federal government, as groups, and pushed to lower social
status as individuals, and that their land holdings had
diminished” •— and this is after they had given up most of the
country ~ "their land holdings had diminished from 138 million
acres in 1887 to 48 million acres in 1934," and something had
to be done.
The purpose of the Indian Reorganization Act. was to
reverse the trend towards destruction, to use not too strong a

11
word,,

by ending the Indian allotment policy, which had let

land go first to Indian hands cind then out of Indian hands.
Q

Did that reduction that you just mentioned in­

land holdings, does that — was that a totally a reduction in
all lands held by any Indians in any capacity, or was that a
reduction in tribal land holdings?
MR. SACESE:

No, I think it was the latter.

This was

lands that had passed out of any kind of Indian —
Q

The former then.

MR. SACHSE:

The former.

I know it is. not tribal

holdings —
Q

It is not?

MR. SACHSE;

VJhafc he was referring to is th?5. Amount

of land that had been lost after allotment, where the land was
allotted and then everything that wasn't allotted was consid­
ered surplus land and then was just openly sold off to nonIndians'.
Q

Well, it is not vital

anyway.

• ' 'if. ?

MR. SACHSE:

Anyway, to end this abuse was to termin­

ate the allotment act, to encourage Indian governments on the
t’i ,/• ;•

.

reservation, and there was a third part, and that was to make
the Indian role a prominent role in the Bureau of Indian
Affairs.

It was an attempt at the classic problem of who

guards the guardian, and the federal government had failed as
a plain guardian, and it was felt necessary to have Indians

12

participate strongly in guarding the guardian and self-help in
doing their own work.
A more radical proposal was discarded.

A more radical

disposal was to give the tribes an absolute veto, or virtually
an absolute veto of any Bureau of Indian Affairs person who
would be sent to reservations.

But, rather than do that,

Congress decided on this proposal of giving preference to
Indians in the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
I have seme nice examples of language from the
Congressional Record pointing out the purpose of this, but I
don't think I will read them to you.

We have it in our brief.

One of the pithier and shorter ones was by Senator Norbeck, who
simply said, "I think we have utterly fallen down in the present
system.

The Indian has been excluded.

The reservation is

filled up with white people who live off the Indians."

And

other statements attribute this directly to the workings of
the Civil Service law.

And as Mr. Collier pointed out, there

are actually less Indians working for Indian progress in 1934
than in 1930 — excuse me, than in 1900, less percentage of
Indians, because the Civil Service, law had served to weed out
qualified Indians who may not have been able to compete with
hundreds of non-Indian applicants.

And there are many state­

ments -that the Indians should not have to compete with nonIndians for the jobs in their own service and in controlling
their own property.

13
Q

Does the Bureau, Mr, Sachse, have much responsi­

bility outside of the administration of tribal affairs?
MR, SACHSE:

Well, it does in this instance.

It has

responsibility for the — it has the trust responsibility for
all trust property.

Some of the trust property is allotted

trust property, so in that sense you might say it is outside
of tribal affairs, but other than members of tribes of allotted
property it only has jurisdiction where its view -— its view
is that it only has jurisdiction where it is dealing with
tribal Indians.
Q

And an allottee, if he meets the other require­

ments, could qualify under the preference?
MR. SACHSE:

That is correct,

That, is correct.

I want to point out also that this is not — well,
before I get to this, the Act itself, of course, says specific­
ally that the preference is to be without regard to Civil
Service laws, is to be competent Indians without regard to
Civil Service laws.

And it. is a preference in the administra­

tion of functions or services affecting any Indian tribe, and
that is the way it has been handled by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs.
1 want to point out also that there are many Indians,
many people who racially could be considered tin Indian who
don’t get this preference.

For instance, if someone is a

member of a terminated tribe, such as the Klamaths of Oregon,

their property is no longer being administered by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs.

They don’t get the preference.

Somebody who

is a member of a tribe that has never been, whose property has
never been handled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, such as
Passamaquoddy Indians in Maine.

They don't — if someone is

racially a pure-blooded Indian from Canada, from Mexico, though
they have lived here for three generations, he doesn't get the
preference.

The preference is not a racial preference.

It is

'a preference for the people whose property and lives are
affecte’d by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to serve in that bureau.
That is undisputed in the record of this case, the testimony.
Mow, we think it is clear that the statute was not
repealed by the Equal Employment Act of 1972.

As we demonstrate

in our brief — and I point out also the letter from the Civil
Service Commission that makes this point, that is in the record
of the case, the Civil Service Commission, which has the pri­
mary responsibility for enforcement the Equal Employment Act of
1972 in government service, fully agrees with this.
There is not a word in the Act •— they also had a
role in drafting it •—■ there is not a word in the Act that sets
out to abolish this Indian preference.

Certainly, the broad

language about racial preference or national origin doesn't do
it itself.

The legislative history shows not any intention to

change -the Indian preference.

And it is inconceivable to us

that Congress, in art act setting out to increase minority

15
participation in government, would have abolished the Indian
preference without a word saying that they are doing it.

I

think if they had intended to do that, they would have done it.
And they had the .right to rely on principles of statutory con­
struction that this broad act would not repeal the more specific
act.
Q

Of course, the other side of that same coin is

that if they had intended otherwise, they would have read it
into the exceptions, written it into the exceptions —
MR. SACHSE;
Q

Well —

— so the thing cuts both ways, really, which

brings me to ray question before.
MR. SACHSE:

Well, unless you focus on the purpose,

for those exceptions, which are not really exceptions at all
but simply a delimitation of the Executive Branch of the
government and the outer limits of the Civil Service Commission's
authority.

But I would like to stay out of that so that Mr.

Sherman can get into that.
Q

It seems to me you are cutting right into it

when you made the opposing statements here.
MR. SACHSE:

I am afraid I did, and I know ,you are

unhappy with me for saying it at all.
much of that.

I promise not to do too

But I want you to know that this is also the po­

sition of the United States.
Now, to the constitutional issue —

16

Q

You mean the United States is speaking here with

one voice?
MR. SACHSE:

For a change.

In Board of Commissioners v. Seber, upholding an
Indian tax immunity against a constitutional attack on equal
protection grounds, the Court said this, and I think it is the
key to this case.

It said;

"In the exercise of the war and

treaty powers, the United States overcame the Indians and took
possession of their lands, sometimes by force, leaving them an
uneducated, helpless and dependent people, needing protection
against the selfishness of others and their own improvidence."
Okay.

"Of necessity, the United assumed the duty of furnishing

that protection, and with it the authority to do all that was
required to perform that obligation and to prepare the Indians
to take their place as independent, qualified members of the
modern, body politic.11
Then, actually in an earlier case, Perrin v. United
States, in upholding the laws as to sale of liquor to Indians
on land next to a reservation, the Court said that, in determin­
ing what is reasonably essential to the protection of the
Indians, Congress is invested with wide discretion, and its
actions, unless purely arbitrary, must be accepted and given
full effect by the courts.
Now, I don't know that I would argue for that broad a
standard, but certainly that kind of standard is the test for

17
this case, that this is an area that Congress has to deal with,
it is a difficult area, Congress has dealt with it in good
faith and to a great extent successfully with the 1934 reorgan­
ization act.

And the Court should be loath to un-do that on

constitutional grounds.
Now, I want to make one other point, and that is the
way we analyze this case, .'this is not really ah equal protec­
tion. case at all, because equal protection refers to people
who essentially are in the same relationship to the governs.,
that the government then has passed laws that treat then in
different ways, and then the court uses its equal protection
analysis to decide whether the difference in that treatment is
justifiable.
But here 'there is an essential different relationship
between.; a tribal Indian, whose tribal property is being managed
by BIA, and *—
Q

It isn't quite as simple as if they had had a

preference for farmers in the Agriculture Department, you know,
that that presumably would raise very few equal protection
arguments?

Perhaps X don’t —
MR. SACHSE:

Well, I would put. this the other way.

think this
Q

You think you have got an easier case?

MR. SACHSE:

I think I have an easier, case than that

because of the special treatment in the Constitution itself of

I

13
Indians, the commerce clause,

and the long history of special

legislation in dealing in Indian affairs.
And I point out, in light of the recent decision of
the Court in Arnette, too, that perhaps a non-Indian employee
doesn!t have a vested right in this job in the BIA or, if he
does, it is under the terms that he comes in under.

But I say

that only to you, Mr. Justice.
[Laughter]
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:

Mr. Sherman?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRIS D. SHERMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE IKTERVENOR-APPELLANT AMERIND
MR. SHERMAN;

Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to concentrate my comments on the ques­
tion of whether the 1972 Civil Rights Act repealed by implica­
tion the Indian preference statutes which the lower court so
ha Id.
Section 717(a) of that Act, by its express terms,
barred discrimination based on rac© in the federal government.
Although nowhere in. the terns of the legislative history of
that. Act is there any intention expressed by Congress to repeal
the Indian preference statutes, the District Court held that
the BIA must, come under the broad terms of the Act and thereby
repealed by implication those statutes.
Now, in my argument, I would first like to analyze

19
the legislative background of the '72 Act, which we believe,
without question, shows that Congress could not have intended
such a repeal.
Secondly, I would like to explain why the BIA is not
listed as an exception in that Act.

And, lastly, I would like

to touch on why we believe the District Court failed to apply
basic rules of statutory construction regarding repeal by
implication.
Now, if I may first turn to the legislative back­
ground of the ’72 Act, because I think this is extremely im­
portant s

The 1972 Act amended the 1964 Act, and by section

717(a) merely codified preexisting nondiscrimination statutes
— excuse me — Executive regulations that existed in the
federal government.
The language of these preexisting regulations in
section 717(a) of the 1972 Act are virtually identical.

Now,

we believe this is important because these nondiscrimination
measures have stood side by side with the Indian preference
statutes over the years, and neither the Executive Branch nor
the Legislature viewed Indian preference on the one hand and
nondiscrimination on the other hand as being inconsistent.
And for tills very reason, Congress may well have thought it was
not necessary to make an exception for the BIA in the 1972
Civil Rights Act.
Now, let me give some examples of this.

Beginning in

20
the Roosevelt administration, there were executive regulations
which bar discrimination in the federal government, and there
have been successive executive regulations up to the present
time.
At the same time, because of the 1934 Indian preference
statute, both the BIA and the Civil Service Commission' have given
special preferential rights to Indians as opposed to non-Indians
upon initial entry into the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Neither

the bureau nor the Civil Service Commission have seen these non­
discrimination policies and Indian preference policies as being
1neonsistent.
Now, another example of this is in 1964 when Congress
passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

In barring discrimination in

private employment, Congress reaffirmed its belief in Indian
preference by exempting from the Act Indian tribes and private
employers on or near Indian reservations to allow preferential
employment treatment for Indians.

Congress did not view Indian

preference on the one hand and nondiscrimination on the other
hand as being inconsistent.
Even in 1972, three months, only three months after
the 1972 Civil Rights Act was passed, Congress passed new
Indian preference statutes giving preferences to Indian teachers
and Indian educators and special Indian education programs.
Congress in no way saw any inconsistency between these new
preference acts in 1972 and the Civil Rights Act that it had

21
just passed.
Now, I want to turn for a moment to the legislative
history of the 1972 Act.

Mr. Sachse has pointed out that no­

where in the terras of the Act or in its legislative history,
which is voluminous, did Congress in any way say anything about
its desire to repeal 138 years of special Indian preference
programs.

Surely, had Congress intended'to do so, it would

have said something, especially in view of its recent affirma­
tion in 1964 and in 1972 with these new Indian preference laws.
I think at the very least, Congress' would have intended the
1964 Indian preference statute to do away with the private
preferential right it had given to Indians if it intended to
take away the right that it had given in the Bureau of Indian
Affairs.
Now, the logical question to all of this is why didn't
Congress include an exemption for the BIA in the 1972 Act.

Well,

wo can only speculate on that since there is nothing in the
legislative history to indicate one way or the other.

But I

think the most plausible explanation is that Congress simply
felt that Indian preference was not inconsistent with the gen­
eral nondiscrimination prohibitions and therefore it wasn't
necessary to create an exemption.
Now, one reason for this, and I stress, that this is
for the same reason Mr. Sachse brought out, these Indian prefer­
ence statutes, as we interpret them, are basically not racial

22

statutes.

The thrust of the Indian preference act was to give

self-determination to Indian people, people whose lives are
controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Now, as Mr. Sachs© has pointed out, there are many
Indians whose lives are not controlled by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs.

Those Indians, even if they are full-blooded Indians,

don't qualify for Indian preference.

So in that sense, the

Indian preference laws are more based on a federal tribal
recognition or tribal affiliation, not on the fact that one is
or is not an Indian.

And in that sense we do not believe that

Congress thought that these statutes were based on a racial
classification.
In addition to that, as I just —
Q

Mr. Sherman —

MR. SHERMAN;
Q

Yes?

— I am not sure that I understand what you say

is being the same as what Mr. Sachs© said about who qualifies
for the preference.
are an Alate,

If you are not on a reservation, say you

but. you do trace your origins back to a federally

recognised tribe.

Do you qualify for the preference?

MR. SHERMANj

My understanding as to the way the bureau

interprets tills statute, you do not qualify for Indian prefer­
ence unless you are a present member of a federally recognized
tribe.
Q

But that doesn't mean that you have to be on a

23
reservation?
MR. SHERMAN:

It doesn't mean you have to be on a

reservation, that is correct.
Q

And you have to be also at least one-quarter

Indian blood?
MR. SHERMAN:
Q

You must be both?

MR. SHERMAN:
Q

And you must be one-quarter Indian blood

You must be both, that is correct.

That is my understanding.

MR. SHERMAN:

That is the way the bureau is interpret­

ing the statute.
Now, I think, in addition to what I have just said,
I think an additional reason for the BIA not being part of this
1972 Act was that the thrust of the 1972 Act was to strengthen
Civil Service Commission's antidiscrimination measures; and
this .1934 Act, as Mr. Sachse has said, was instituted, giving
Indians preferences "without regard to Civil Service laws."
We don’t think Congress meant to do away with those
preference statutes when it passed the 1972 Act.

Now, I want

to say that there is an alternative explanation as to why the
bureau doesn't appear in the Act, and that is simply because
it is very, very possible that Congress overlooked the bureau
or overlooked Indian preference when it considered the Act.
think there is good evidence to that in the sense that there
.is not one word anywhere in the legislative history that

I

24
mentions the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Indian preference
statutes.
Q

I don’t know whether you have covered it or not,

but this Indian, this person who is a member of a recognised
•tribe and one-quarter Indian blood, in an ordinary job he has
the protection of 0E0?
MR. SHERMAN:

Well, I think he would also have the

protection of the Office of Economic -Q

So he has both?

MR. SHERMAN;

So he would have both protections, I

presume, because he is a member of a minority, that is correct.
Q

Well, he has more than the protection of 0E0.

A

private employer can discriminate in his favor under 0E0?
MR. SHERMAN:

Only the private employer who is on or

near a reservation.
Q

Right.

MR. SHERMAN:

But that is in the private sector.

We

are dealing here with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the
Indian Health Service, which is an off-shoot of the bureau.
I also want to deal briefly with the issue of statu­
tory construction as it applies to ’’repealed by implication.”
Appellees have contended that the terms of the Indian prefer-,
ence statute and the Civil Rights Act of 1972 are in conflict,
and thus the Indian preference statutes, because they are
earlier statutes, must give way to the latter statute.

25
Now, quite to the contrary, the rules of this Court
generally have been that repealed by implication of a special
statute by a general statute will not take place.

Now, I want

to stress that in our view these Indian preference statutes,
without question, are special statutes.

They only apply to the

Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service and only
in a very limited way.
On the other hand, the 1372 Civil Rights Act, without
question, is a general statute, it applies to virtually the
entire federal government.

Now, if the terms of the special

and general statutes are in conflict, the prior special statute
will only be an exception to the general statute unless the
legislative history of the general statute could be demonstrated
to have expressly intended to repeal the earlier statute, which
is clearly not the case here because we don't have one word ret

la-ting to intention of repeal Indian preference, or if the
basic goal of the general statute would be entirely defeated,
if the earlier legislation were to stand.
Now, the 1972 Civil Rights Act stands almost in its
entirety intact.

It applies to virtually all agencies of the

federal government.

As a matter of fact, it applies to the

Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Racial discrimination, sex discrim­

ination, religious discrimination in tbs Bureau of Indian
Affairs, this is precluded.

Only when an Indian and a non-

Indian compete for a vacancy and the Indian is qualified for

26

that job, and he is from a federally recognized tribe, does he
receive the preference.

Otherwise the 1972 Civil Rights Act in

all other respects applies to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Now, lastly, I would like to just comment on what
concerns the appellant Amerind greatly in this case.

If Indian

preference is to be repealed, or if it is to be found unconsti­
tutional , we believe this would have a devastating effect on
the Bureau of Indian Affairs and on Indian employment.

And I

would like to briefly explain this.
Our brief does go into the fact that almost all
Indians in the Bureau of Indian Affairs enters the Indian
service through what is called the acceptance service.

This

is a special exemption by which Indians, they have to be quali­
fied, but they don't have to take Civil Service examinations,

-s

and they don't have to place their names on federal employment
registers.

Now, the reason for this accepted service was that

the 1934 Congress realized that Civil Service examinations had
long excluded qualified Indians,

They simply didn’t measure

Indian ability, Indian potential.

So the accepted service

was service was set up and the authority for the accepted
service in the BIA was none other than this 1934 Indian prefer­
ence act.
So what, concerns us is if you take away Indian
preference than you in turn take away the accpetad service
and that has been the major vehicle by which literally

27
thousands of Indians have been able to come into their own
service and work for their own people.

And as Exhibit A of

our reply brief shows, that is a study by the Civil Service
Commission of Indians in other federal Indian agencies in
two populous states,. Arizona and New Mexico.

Indians have

been virtually shut out of those agencies and, as that report
explains, one of the reasons is that Indians have not been
able to compete successfully for Civil Service examinations
which don’t measure their true ability.
We are very worried this same thing Would happen to
the BIA if preference were taken from Indians and if the
accepted service were taken from Indians, and that clearly
would defeat the congressional intent of allowing Indians selfdetermination in their own *a£f airs.
So in sum, we believe that if the lower court had
carefully considered the legislative background of the 1972
Act, which it did not, and if the lower court had applied
basic rules of statutory construction relating to special and
oral statutes, which it did not, Indian preference would
have been allowed to stand.

And we believe that the decision

of the lower court should be reversed.
I have nothing unless the Court has some questions.
Thank you.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS:
Mr. Franchini?

Thank you.

23
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE E. FRANCHINI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. FRANCHINI;

Mr. Justice Douglas, and may it please

the Court, Your Honors:
There are still basically two issues.presented before
this Court hers today, Your Honors, the first one being whether
or not the 1972 Equal Employment Opportunity Act repealed the
1934 Indian preference acts by implication, or whether it
tacitly did so.
The second question I think that is presented to the
Court is whether or not the Indian preference acts passed some
forty years ago

I am talking specifically about the 1934 Act,

Yours Honors — is violative of the Fifth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United State© of America.
Now, with regard to the. statement of the case presented
to you here this afternoon, Your Honors, by Appellant, I would
like to bring out a couple of factors with regard to BIA that
the Court may or may not be aware of.
First of all, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Your
Honors, has a dual function, and that dual function are these:
Number one, it acts as a trustee for certain properties for the
Indian nations? and', secondly, it provides services to Indians
through other federal, and state agencies.

Now, when I say

provide services, I am talking about such things as school con­
struction, maintenance of schools, some teachers, providing

29
power or water for irrigation and for lights.

There are some

health services that are put through HEW —
Q

Mr. Franchini, those programs are all limited to

Indians, aren't they?
MR. FRANCHINI;

They are limited to Indians, yes,

Your Honor, but they are services rendered to Indians.
Q

But to nobody else?

MR. FRANCHINI;

To nobody else, no, Your Honor,

through the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
Q

And would you suggest there is also a constitu­

tional question about, those services?
MR.FRANCHINI:

No, Your Honor, Justice White, I am

not here to argue that point with regard to —
Q

I know, but you are here to argue the constitu­

tionality of a preference in employment to Indians.
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Preference in the sense that they will hire only

Indians for certain jobs.
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

And you wouldn't think there would be any —

MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

And that they will promote Indians.

You wouldn't think there would bs any constitu­

tional question about furnishing schools only to Indians or
to furnishing water 03; a lot of other services only to Indians?
MR. FRANCHINI:

No, Your Honor, I don't, and for this

30

reason, Justice White.

I think that it is clear, and it has

been clear, that Congress5 power with regard to Indians is al­
most plenary.

They have -treated the Indians as a subjugated

people for very many, many years, and that their powers over
the Indian nations have been plenary in this regard.
What we are dealing with in this particular case are
government employees who are Indian members of the BXA as opposed to government employees in the BIA who are non-Indians,
and this Court and the Congress and the President can give as
many rights as they want to to these Indians, to these people.
There is no question about that.

What makes this illegal, what

makes this particular act illegal that we are talking about,
and making it unconstitutional, is that they are taking away
from other government employees who are non-Indians to give the
Indians the rights.

They are taking the rights from the non-

Indian employee's of the BIA to give the rights to the Indian
employees of the BIA.
Q

You wouldn't say there would be anything wrong

then if there is a vacancy in the BIA, and there are two appli­
cants, one an Indian and one a non-Indian, to give the job to
the Indian?
MR. FRANCIUM!:
qualified.

Everything else being equal, if he is

You have a question of qualification here, whether

or not the Indian —
Q

Well, I will just ask you again.

You wouldn't

31

sea anything wrong with giving the preference to the Indian in
every case?
MB,. FRANCHINI:

Not so long as, Your Honor, the Indian

is qualified and can pass the Civil Service examination.
Q

Well, no, so you do see something wrong with it?

MR„ FRANCHINI:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, I know, but —

MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

Oh, yes, I do.

Yes.

Well, what rights has the non-employee got that

is being taken away from him by giving preference to the
Indians?
MR. FRANCHINI?

The right that the non-Indian employee

has in the BIA is his right to his job, his —
Q

Well, we are talking about vacancies, that non-

employees who are applying for employment, what rights have
they got to object to a preference given to an Indian?
MR. FRANCHINIs

If they are applying for the job and

they are qualified for the job, and there are no qualified
Indians available ~
Q

You say they have a right to --

MR. FRANCHINI:

—for the job, they have a right to

get the job.
Q

You cay they have a right under the Civil Service

law?
MR. FRANCHINIs

Certainly, and they have a right to

32
the promotions when they become available, which have not been
applied as far as the way this Act is presently being applied,
Your Honors.
Q

What do you do with veterans' preferences?

HR. FRANCHIKfl s

Your Honor, I am not here to argue

the matter of veterans’ preferences, and I am really not as
familiar with veterans’ preferences with regard to these kinds
of
Q

Haven’t you heard that they exist?

MR. FRANCHIKfl;
Honor.

Oh, I realize that they exist, Your

I realise that they exist.

The point that I am trying

to —
Q

If the two are equally qualified, the veteran

automatically gets the preference?
MR. FRANCHINI:

The thing that makes this matter un­

constitutional, Justice Marshall, is not so much giving a
qualified Indian a job over a qualified non-Indian, but when
they are both already employees of a federal agency —
Q

I am talking about those that are applying for

the job.
MR. FRANCHINIs

We are talking here in this case, Your

Honor, not of people that are applying for the job but promo­
tions within the agency itself, not initial hiring.
Q

Well ~

MR. FRANCHINI%

We are talking about promotions,

33

Justice Marshall.
Q

I know that, but 1 thought yon were talking

originally about —- my brother Whits asked you about someone
applying for a job, that is why I was.
MR. FRANCHINI:

If the qualifications are equal, Your

Honor, from a practical standpoint, without a federal statute,
probably the Indian would have preference over the non-Indian
in the BIA.
Q

You don't believe that the BIA could say, as a

matter of policy, there is no Civil Service required?
MR. FRANCHINI;

No, Your Honor, we think that that is

unconstitutional as well.

It is part of the same section of the

Act that we are talking about here.
Q

Well, we have got the BIA, we have got $100,000

— I am using small figures because I can't understand big ones
for water and health facilities, and $100,000 for employment,
so far as the government is concerned, that is $200,000.

You

say they can spend $.100,000 to the exclusion of everybody but
Indians, the one for the water and —
MR. FRANCHINI:

Well, Your Honor, I am saying that

the non-Indian employees in

-the BIA, who are employees right

now —
Q

But the BIA says we are going to put $100,000

into a water purification, plant on the Jacobs Reservation.
MR. FRANCHINI:

Yes, Your Honor.

34
Q

And none of that water can anybody other than

the Indiana touch, and that is solely for Indians.

That is

okay?
MR. FRANCHINI;
Q

Yes, sir.

And if the BIA says we are going to put $100,000

for employment of Indians only, that is wrong?
MR. FRANCHINI;
Q

Why?

It is still $100,000.

MR. FRANCHINI •
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

The appellees in this case —

We are only talking about $100,000, that is all

we are talking about in both cases.
MR. FRANCHINI;

What wa are talking about here though,

Your Honor, in deference to —in deference to what your first
problem was, is that in this case all of the appellees in this
case are non-Indian employees of the BIA right now, and they
have been denied promotions in their jobs, they have been denied
advancement in their jobs even though they are qualified —Q

And they knew it when they took this jobs?

MR. FRANCHINI;

No, Your Honor, they did not know

that when they took the jobs.

That is the reason that we are

before the Court today.
Q

Why did they not?

MR. FRANCHINI;

What makes this unconstitutional,

Justice Marshall, is what I am saying is they can have all of
the rights that they want, all of the privileges that they want.

35
Q

When was this preference act passed?

MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

1934, Your Honor.

Well, aren't some of these employees hired since

' 34?
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

But this promotion is a new policy, isn't it?

MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

Just initial hiring.

— just initial hiring -~

MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, it is —

It was always thought applicable to —

MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

Not as to promotion.

— but promotion is a new policy?

MR. FRANCHINI:

This is a brand new thing that comes

up, Justice Marshall, and ~
Q

But that does not seem to be confined, does it

not?
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

That is true. Your Honor.

I take it we do not have here any question about

present employees being displaced at all?

It is just the

question of promotion?
MR. FRANCHINIs
displaced employees.

I don't know whether we have had any

I doubt it, Justice Blackmun.

What I am

talking about are qualified non-Indian employees not being
promoted and not being advanced within the BIA, although they
are qualified to be advanced.

36

Q

Mr. Franchini, did I understand you to say it

would be unconstitutional for the government not to apply the
Civil Service rules to the Bureau of Indian Affairs?
MR. FRANCHINI:

We are saying that the entire Indian

preference statute that was passed in 1934 is no longer neces­
sary in 1974, and that it is in fact unconstitutional, Justice
Rehnquist, yes.
Q

That is what we are saying.
But certainly one argument I assume you make is

that it is close enough to a distinction based on race or color
so as to come under the Fourteenth Amendment.

But supposing

there were no Indian preference statute but the Bureau of Indian
Affairs was simply exempted from the Civil Service requirements
to take a competitive examination to get in, although most
other government departments require that sort of examination.
There would be nothing wrong with that, would there?
MR. FRANCHINIs

No, but that isn't the case that we

have before the bar, Justice Rehnquist.
Q

Yes, I realise that.

MR. FRANCHINI:

That is really -the problem that is

facing this Court here today.
Now, ws are saying in the first instance, Your Honors,
that — yes, Justice Blackmon?
Q

Mr. Franchini, do you know what brought about

the change in attitude on the part of the Bureau in 1973 as to
promotions and things?

What was it that triggered that?

37
MR. FRANCEINIs
it. Your Honor.

I don’t know exactly what triggered

In 1972 or shortly thereafter, it became a

policy of the Department of the Interior and in the Bureau of
Indian Affairs to advance the Indian employees of the BIA over
the non-Indian employees of the BIA, and they were, as we main­
tain here today, subsequently discriminated against because of
that reason.

And this is one of the reasons why this case has

come before this Court, so that this Court can determine whether
or not the actions taken by the BIA at that time are in fact
constitutional or unconstitutional.
With regard to the argument about the 1972 Act repeal-"
ing by implication the 1934 Indian preference acts, Your Honors,
I ’would like to point out this, that at no time, at no time.
Yours Honors, during the course of the briefs or during the
course of the argument that we have heard from the appellants,
do the appellants at all deny that the Indian employees of the
BIA are government employees and subject to the rules and regulations laid down in the statutes that we are talking about here
today.

There has been no objection and no exception, either in

the court below or before this Court, that they are government
employees.
Now, the 1964 Equal Employment Opportunity Act, which
applied to private employers, contained an exception for Indians
living on or near a reservation.

And I have pointed that out,

that this exception was made for those businesses or enterprises

30

operating on or near a resevation with a publicly announced
policy, Your Honors, of aiding and assisting Indians.
Eight years later, in 1972, whan they took the 1964
Act and applied it to federal employees, there is no exception
in the Act with regard to BIA ox* BIA employees, none, Your
Honors.

It is absolutely absent.
In the briefs, I have pointed out that as a matter of

congressional record, both Senator Byrd of West Virginia and
also Senator Humphrey of the State of Minnesota have made ex­
tensive remarks during the course of the passage of the ’72 Act
applying to all federal employees.

And I think that Senator

Byrd’s remarks are probably even more apropos here than at any
other time.

He said, "I do not favor special treatment or

special consideration or favored employment of any individual
on the basis of that person’s being black or white or male or
female; notwithstanding what I have just said, the fact remains
that discr-imination in employment on the basis of race does
exist and discrimination against sex does persist, wherever
there is such a discrimination in employment, it is violative
of the Constitution of the United States.

In other words, he

should rise or fall on the basis of merit, not on the basis of
his race or religion or sex.

Every qualified individual,

whether he be black, white or else, should be given an equal
chance and not preferential treatment in employment."
I would also like to point out to the Court that

39
section 105 of Title 5 of the United States Cocla specifically
lists therein, Your Honors, Executive Department.

Now, Execu­

tive Department includes the Department of the Interior and is
referred to and included in section 717 of the 1972 Act.

Now,

if Congress had not intended to refuse to make an exception
based upon race in government employment, why would they include
it in the definition?

In other words, Congress did not intend

to exclude namely Indian preference that which they specific­
ally included in the Act.
When the appellants argue, Your Honors, that the 1972
Act is a general statute and the Indian preference statutes are
specific legislation, and that therefore the latter should be
upheld in resolving conflicts, I think we are talking about
semantics.

They both cover the same principle that we are

talking about here, Your Honors.
employment.
together.

They both cover government

They are of equal import.

They should be read

And if the conflict cannot be resolved between the

two, then the most recent civil rights legislation giving us
freedom from discrimination based upon sex, race, creed or
color is the one that should be upheld and not vice versa, an
Indian preference act passed forty years ago, when the situa­
tion today is much different.
Q

How about the Indian Education Act that was

passed in 1972?
MR. FRANCEINI;

Again, Your Honor, this is an act of

40

Congress giving the opportunity to Indian young men and women
to become educated so that they can go back to the Indian
schools and teach the Indian American what life is like outside
of that reservation, that non-Indian world, and that is per­
fectly all right.

We are not talking about that kind of an

action being unconstitutional, but I fail to see its applicabil­
ity with regard to our first argument, the ’72 act in fact
entirely repeals the act of 1934.

This is another action by

the Congress of the United States to give to the Indian American
another way out of tills prison that he has been put in by
virtue of this Indian preference.
What we are saying to these people are, you are
American citizens, you are citisens of the United States of
America.

However, there is something different about you so

we have to take special preferential care of you.
Q

Mr. Franchini, you said there is a great differ­

ence between when the preference act was passed and the present
time.

Is there any record to back you up on that?
MR. FRANCHINIs

Yes, Your Honor, I think there is

considerable information in the record with regard to that.
First of all, I would like to point to the record on page 41,
with regard to the employment in the BIA.

If the Court would

turn to page 41, Justice Marshall, that BIA data at the top of
that page indicates who are the majority and who are the
minority employees of the BIA.

At the present time within the

41
BIA, there are 8,347 Indian employees and 7,176 non-Indian
employees, or a total of 15,523 human beings working within
that area»
Q

What was the percentage when it was passed?

MR. FRANCHIMI:

The percentage 'was much lower, as

was stipulated by counsel in his opening remarks.

In 1930,

between *30 and '34, there 'were very few Indian employees in
what was then called the Indian Service.

But the Indian

Service in those days really did have something to say about
the life and politics of Indians.
Q

You go ahead, but I am not interested in that.

You said the Indians are so much better off now.

I thought

that is what you were talking about.
MR. FRANCHIMI:

Yes, Your Honor, they are better off

than they werein 1934, much better off.
Q

Sure.

So are you.

MR. FRANCHIMI:
Q

I hope so.

I hope.

MR. FRANCHINIs

Justice Marshall, recently in the

Bureau of Vital Statistics of the United States, where in the
1940's I think the average age of the Indian American who
died was 40, it is new something like 68.
Q

Is there any movement to repeal the fvoference

act, or do you want us to repeal it?
MR. FRANCHINI:

No, Your Honor.

I think that the

42
Congress of the United States has repealed it by implication.
Q

Wally I thought you said you wanted us to rule

it unconstitutional.
MR. FRANCEINI:

That is the second argument, Your

Honor. and I am going to get to that very shortly.

1 think

that it was repealed by the 1972 Equal Employment Opportunity
Act -Q

And you can't find —

MR. FRANCHINI;

— and even if it wasn't, it is still

an unconstitutional act.
Q

You can't find one word in. that act that suggests

that, right?
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

Pardon me. Your Honor?

There is no one. word in the act that suggests

the repealing?
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

No, Your Honor.

And the only words you have is the word of

Senator Byrd where he said "all others," and you say that in­
cludes Indians?
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

You don't repeal acts that way.

You don't throw

them all in a big hopper and repeal the whole mess of them at
tli© same time.

Are you really serious that this repeals it?

MR. FRANCHINI;

Yes, Your Honor, I am really serious

that I think that it repealed it.

43
Q

I suppose the court below was very serious when

they held it was repealed?
MR. FRANCEINI:

That is true# Your Honor, they were

very, very specific on the point, as part of the jurisdictional
statements this Honorable Court has the entire opinion of the
court below.
Q

They were convinced that it was repealed,
Well, with two statutes, you can't obey them

botli, can you?
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

No, Your Honor, you can't.

It says "all personnel actions affecting em­

ployees in the Executive Department shall be made without re­
gard to race."

If you obey that literally, you can’t obey the

preference act, can you?
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

And if that —

MR. FRANCHINI:

And the BIA today is in a state of

upheaval —
Q

This is why you say there is a repeal, I take

it?
MR. FRANCHINI:

That there is a conflict and they

have to be read in pari materia to one another and that the '72
act being the more recent civil rights legislation, repeals
the 534 act.
Q

That is exactly the point, Your Honor.
And you were able to convince three New Mexico

federal judges to that effect?

44
MR„ FRANCKINI:

Yes, Your Honor.

Justice Seth, who

is the Chief Justice of the Tenth Circuit, and two District
Judges from Albuquerque.
Q

I can read their opinion and I can disagree with

it, can't I?
MR. FRANCHINIs

Yes, Your Honor, you sure can.

You

surely can, sir.
Q

It depends on what they said in their opinion,

and they just said automatically it was repealed, which is what
you said.
MR. FRANCHINI:
than that, Your Honor.

I think they went a little bit further
But this is a question of an interpre­

tation of what the lower court bald and certainly, Justice
Marshall, you have the right to read it in that fashion.
With regard to the unconstitutional aspect of the
1934 Indian preference acts, Your Honor, the appellees hers are
a woman, a Jewish man, a Maxican-Amerlean, and a black American,
all non-Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Hone

of them are employed, Your Honors, on or near a reservation,
none of them.

They all perform technical and ministerial tasks

and no claim has ever been made that they make any decisions
at all involving Indian matters of participation in government.
For that matter, Your Honors, our point in the brief is that
the BIA today does not make decisions for the Indian tribes.
Those decisions that govern their everyday lives are not made

45
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, they are made in the tribal
councils on the reservations.
We are contending that the Indian preference acts of
1934 discriminate against them on racial basis in promotion to
positions that are likewise not on or near a reservation but,
as a matter of practical fact, is the Indian Polytechnic
Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which is not on a reser­
vation .
Q

The Secretary of Interior though does have an

extraordinary amount of authority, as I recall, over the lives
of Indians.

He can approve wills, he can approve payment of

tribal attorneys fees, and surely in those matters he is
advised by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, isn't, he?
MR. FRANCKIfll:

I don't know, Your Honor.

I don't

know whether the Secretary of the Interior is ever advised by
the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

There are some things in this

brief. Justice Rehnquist, that indicate that perhaps that may
not be the case.

I think that the Secretary of the Interior,

Mr. Rogers C. B. Morton, realises also that with' this preference
act that we now have applied, that the non-Indian employees of
the BIA are in fact second-class citizens and they are not
being provided with their constitutional rights in having their
jobs — in not. having the ability to be advanced in their jobs
and promoted in their jobs —
Q

Mr. Morton, is he the one that is petitioning

46
in this case?
MR. FRANCHINI:

Mr. Morton, Rogers C. B. Morton, the

Secretary of the Interior, is one of the appellants, Your Honor
Amerind, Inc., an Indian organization, which is —Q

But he is one of -the appellants?

MR. FRANCHINT:
o

He is one of the appellants.

And as I understood you to say, he agrees with

you?
MR. FRANCHINI;
Q

I think he does, Your Honor.

Well, how can he be an appellant and be on the

other side, too?
MR. FRANCHINI;
Q

I believe, Your Honor, that —

Now, wait a minute.

A minute ago I think the

other side admitted that, for once the United States government
was in agreement on a case, and now you say they are not.even
in agreement on'diis one.
MR. FRANCHINI;

I don't think they are even in agree­

ment on this one. Your Honor.
Q

I mean they are in agreement with you?

MR. FRANCHINIs

I hope so.

I think that is the way I

read it, Your Honor.
Q

On what issue?

MR. FRANCHINI;

On the issue of as to whether or not,

with the existence of Indian preference, Justice Stewart, the
non-Indian employees that I represent are in fact second-class

citizens in this country because of their inability to be pro­
moted, their inability to be advanced.
Q

They agree that Indians are given preference in

promotion?
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

That is what you mean?

MR. FRANCHINI;

And they don't disagree that they are

every bit, the Indian employees are every bit as much govern­
mental employees as my non-Indian clients.
Q

Mr. Franchini, I don't know if the United States

still has mandate authority over American Samoa or not, but. it
did at one time.

Would you think it unconstitutional for the

Secretary of the Interior, governing that islancfc to give a
preference in local employment preference in promotion to
Samoans?
MR. FRANCHINI;

I think so, Your Honor,

You see, we

are talking about two different things here with Indian prefer­
ence,, Your Honor,

Just Rehnquist, if I could just take a mo­

ment., I will try to explain.
An Indian is defined in this series of acts, section
479 of 25 U.S.C. defines Indians for the purpose of this Indian
preference as follows:

"An Indian, as used in these sections,

included Indian preference, shall include all person-

of

Indian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe
now under federal jurisdiction,

and all persons who are

48

descendant of such members who were on June 1, 1934 residing
within the present boundaries of any Indian reservation, and
shall further include all ether persons of one-half or more
Indian blood."
When we are talking about whether or not an Indian
person is a member of a tribe, some tribes require a blood
quantum, some do not.

But as far as the preference acts that

we are talking about here, Your Honor, are concerned, they have
to have — they are supposed to have one-half or more Indian
blood, but there is no objection, and there is no argument on
the part of the appellants, that they are in fact applying a
one-quairter Indian blood test to exorcise these preferences.
And I don't believe that there ever has been an argument by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Secretary that they are not
applying that, basis.
Now, when they passed this Act — and this is I think
very, very interesting — when Congress passed this act in 1934
giving Indians preference, they said, in section 478 of Title
25, U.S.C., sections 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466 through 470
and 471 through 473, and that includes the Indian preference,
because 472 is the Indian preference of this title shall not
apply to any reservation wherein a majority of the adult
Indians voting at a special election duly called by the
Secretary of the Interior, shall vote against its application»
It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Interior, within

49

one year of June 10 f 1934, t.o call such an election, which
election shall be held by secret ballot upon thirty days
notice.

That election was held, Your Honors.

And I think that

it was clearly Congress' intent that section 472, which was the
Indian preference acts, shall not apply to any reservation
where the male members of the tribe voted against its applica­
tion.
As a matter of practical fact, the largest Indian
reservation in the United states today, namely the Navajo
Reservation, that corn® from where I come from, New Mexico and
Arizona;, voted against it.

And the tribal operations records

within' 'the Bureau of Indian Affairs will show that many other
reservations also rejected chapter 576 in total.
’..-A

.

The Fifth Amendment 'to the Constitution, of the United
Stat'

,; Your Honors, provides in part that citizens of the.

Jn.it:. . States' shall not be deprived of life, liberty and
property without due process of law.
Q

’ -

What is your point about the vote, thafe.for©

this preference Should not be — should not obtain with respect
to employment on the Navajo Reservation, for example?
MR. FHANCHINI:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Well , what about —

MR. FRANCHINI;
intent of the law.

But it seems to me to have been the

Now, I must point out to you, though,

Justice White, that in the lower court, they took a different

50

view of that.
Q

Now, what if the preference is granted that an

office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Albuquerque or in
Santa Fe, not on the reservation, let's assume that is true,
the exclusion wouldn't apply, would it?
MR. FRANCHINIs
Q

I mean the preference would apply?

MR. FRANCHINI%
Q

Oh, yes.

The preference --

It would apply and the vote on the reservation

would be irrelevant?
MR. FRANCHINI:
Q

Yes.

Well, where are these preferences at issue in

this case, where were they granted?
MR. FRANCHINI:

These preferences were granted or the

appellees in the case were not promoted —
,Q

Where do they work?

MR. FRANCHINI:

— off the reservation in Albuquerque

at an Indian school, Polytechnic School in Albuquerque, New
Mexico.
Q

Well, then, the vote against it on the reserva­

tion is irrelevant?
MR. FRANCHINI:

Probably, Your Honor.

Justice White,

I wanted to point out that the section was in there as part of
the Indian preference act to see whether or not the reserva­
tions and the Indians, all Indians of one-half blood, really

51
wanted this to be effective.
Q

Well, that may be so, but the act still applies

off any reservation?
MR. FRANCHINIi
Q

That is true, Your Honor.

Yes.

MR. FRANCHISJI:

That is true, Your Honor.

In this

particular case, this failure to promote and advance qualified
personnel happened off the reservation in the city in a BIA run
school for Indian children.
The case of the Board of County Commissioner's v.
Sober, that has been quoted by counsel for the appellants,
appellees do nob feel decide the issue
case.

or the issues in this

That case decided an issue of whether or not the tax

exemption statutes were violative of the due process clause of
the Fifth Amendment.

It had to do with whether or not the

rights of individual Indians and the United States as a trustee
of property had anything to do with the taxation part of the
matter.

It did not involve a dispute between property rights

of the Indians and non-Indians.

It had to do with something

entirely different than that.
The other, cases cited by appellants in their briefs
and during their argument I think, Your Honors, none go to the
point in issue here.

It is a proposition and they stand for

the proposition that the Indians have a different and probably
a very unique position with regard to other people in the

52
United States of America, bxrfc it. does not decide whether or not
you can deprive a government employee in. the EIA advancement
in his position when he is qualified because of an Indian
preference act.

We believe that is contrary to the Fifth

Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and it is a
distinction based upon race.
Indian blood.

We are talking about one-quarter

When we start talking about blood, we ere talk­

ing about race, Your Honors, and I think that that is clearly
the issue here, that this is strictly a racial preference, and
this is strictly a preference based upon race and nothing more
or less than that.
Finally, Your Honors, I would like to call the Court's
attention to the case of Briggs v. Duke Power Company, 401 U.S.
424.

At page 400 of that opinion, the Chief Justice, who un­

fortunately is not with us her® today, wrote an opinion, and
part of that opinion I think is very, very pertinent here.

It

says that "Congress did not intend by title VII, however, to
guarantee a job to every person, regardless of qualifications.
Xn short, the Act does not command that any person be hired
simply because he was formerly the subject of discrimination or
because he is a member of a minority group.

Discriminatory

preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely
and only what Congress has prescribed.

What is .required by

Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary and unnecessary
barriers to employment when the barriers operate insidiously to

53
discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible
classification."

And that is precisely I think, Your Honors,

what has happened here.
If there are no further questions from this Court, we
confidently submit our case to you for your consideration.
Thank you.
MR, JUSTICE DOUGLAS:

Thank you.

Do you have some more to say?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, APPELLANT
MR. SACHSE:

I have about thirty seconds.

I obviously

can’t answer all of these things.
I ask the Court not to get into the question of the
scope of the preference too ranch.

That is in litigation else-

where and was not —
Q

Mr. Sachs®, could I ask you —

MR. SACHSE:
Q

Yes.

Assume there had never been an Indian preference

-act, and then the later act was passed forbidding discrimina­
tion based on race in government employment.

You wouldn't have

any problem of saying that it applied to the Bureau of Indian
Affairs?
MR. SACHSE:

I want to answer that.

I would have no

problem saying that it. applies to the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
but I would still say —

54
Q

If the Secretary were giving racial preferences,

absent some Indian preference act —
MR. SACHSEs
actually in.

Let me explain this in the context it is

I think your answer, can you apply both acts at

the same time, the answer to that is yes.

The Equal Employment

Act does apply to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

That act would

have been wrong if it had just said exempted, and listed in
those exemptions the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Non-Indian

employees have the benefit of that act, Indian employees as
between each other on the basis of religion or sex had the
benefit of that act.

The only place it doesn't apply is it

allows the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in accordance with another
act of Congress, to continue to prefer qualified Indian employees
«•i

S

for service in the Indian bureaus.
Q

So it is by reason of a prior act that the later

■.

act does not forbid the practice of some — that is now being
followed?
MR. SACHSEs

By reason of the prior act and the fact

recognized by the prior act, I think, that this is not a racial
discrimination, that this is a preference to the people whose
lives are affected by this bureau to have dominance in this
bureau and to do the work in support of their own welfare.
Q

Again, then, I would suppose you would -say that

even absent the prior act, that if the practice of the Secretary
was precisely what it is now, you would say it is not forbidden

55
by the later act because it is not a racial preference?
MR. SACHSEi

X would sav that.

I think the case is

made much easier by the existence of the other act.
Thank you.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS?

The case is submitted.

[WhereuponP at 2?55 o’clock p.ra„, the case was
