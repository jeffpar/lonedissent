PROCEEDINGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 72-1195, American Pipe and Construction, v. Utah.
Mr. O'Malley, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JESSE R. O'MALLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. O'MALLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is before this Court, on a writ of certiorari
to the Ninth Circuit.

The narrow question involved is the

validity of the order of the trial court denying intervention
by respondents in an antitrust treble damage action based upon
a prior government action after the running of the perintent
statute of limitations, section 5(b) of the Clayton Act.
Before beginning, 1 should note that I shall be re­
ferring to the key dates which are pertinent to this statute of
limitations question, and these key dates are set forth in the
record appendix, pages one to four, in summary form.

And I

should also indicate that the statutes which we believe to be
pertinent and controlling in the rules of court are set forth
in the following six pages also of the record appendix.
As I indicated, this case is based upon a denial of
a motion made by respondents in the Central District of
California, in December 1969 intervened in an antitrust damage
action which had been filed by the State of Utah on May 13,

4
1969 as a purported class action.

The Utah complaint alleges

that the action was based on prior government criminal and
unequitable actions and thus by reasons of the prior government
actions, and pursuant to the tolling provisions of sections
5(b) of the Clayton Act, the State of Utah was able to bring
this action based upon alleged acts which ended in 1962.
The government criminal action on which the Utah com­
plaint was based, was begun on March 10, 1964 and was terminated
as to all defendants on June 19, 1964.

A separate government

civil action filed after the criminal action ended was termin­
ated as to all defendants except American Pipe and Construction
l

Company on December 8, 1967.

But the final judgment as to

American Pipe and Construction Company wasn’t filed until May
24, 1968, and it is bv reason of this date of May 24 , .1968 that
• t

the trial court has held that the date of one year later, May
24, 1969., was the date

the statute of limitations finally

ran in this case.
The District Court, on December 4, 1969, entered an
order that the Utah action did not constitute a class action
and subsequently entered an order made after the denial of
the class action by respondent, denying respondent’s motion
to intervene.

It was this order denying intervention at this

juncture that is the subject of these appellate proceedings.
The Court of Appeals reversed the order of the trial
court denying leave to intervene and held that the suit was

instituted on behalf of respondents by the filing of the Utah
complaint on May 13, 1969, even though the prerequisites to a
class action had not been met by the State of Utah, and even
though respondents took no action, no steps whatsoever to inter­
vene until December 1969, a date more than five months after
the limitations period prescribed by 5(b) of the Clayton Act.
The narrow question involved therefore is whether
respondents, who had not filed suit within the period prescribed
by section 5(b), were properly before the trial court by reason
of the fact that the State of Utah erroneously designated its
cause of action as a class action.

Although this case may

appear to have very superficial factual complexity, it turns on
the very simple issue of congressional intent in enacting
section 5(b) of the Clayton Act.
Q

Mr. O'Malley, is there anything peculiar tc the

section 5(b) of the Clayton Act about the Ninth Circuit's
reasoning here?

Wouldn't it apply equally well to any other

claim of statute of limitations?
MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes, indeed, and that is, of course,

as we have pointed out, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in connection
with our petition for certiorari.

This has the effect, as we

see it, of affecting in every federal statute of limitations
by the mere fact that a class action is typed on a complaint,
even though one does not in fact exist, it has the effect by
virtue of that Act of a private party of tolling the statute

6

of limitations *

And I would sav yes, indeed, that is indeed

one of the major issues not only insofar as 5(b) of the Clayton
Act is concerned, which is pertinent to this case, but I think
the principle is applicable equally, Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc,
to every federal statute of limitations.
I would submit that the intent in connection with
5(b) as to what the statute really means is clearly stated in
the barring provision of the statute, and it is also stated,
we submit, with some precision in the legislative reports
underlying the statute.
It should first be noted that the State of Utah is
in court only because of 5(b) which provides for the suspension

of the statute of limitations during the pendency of the govern-*
ment’s antitrust action, and which limits the period in which
the litigant may commence an action based upon the government ’ s
suit to’ the period of the pendency of the government civil or
criminal action and within one year thereafter.

Respondents

didn’t move within that statutory period and were not before
the court until after the one-year suspension period, unless
the filing of the invalid class action by Utah has the legal
effect of bringing respondents before the court.
Now, .in order to escape the barring provisions of
the Clayton Act, the opinion of the Court of Appeals via legal
sanction

treats the respondents as if they had filed suit

simultaneously with the State of Utah.

However, factually, it

7
is not — there is no dispute about this.
in any factual sense at that time.

They had done nothing

They had done nothing what­

soever and they hadn't brought an action of their own volition
and they hadn't moved to intervene, and either of these steps
would merely have required the respondents to file a short and
plain statement of the

alleged violation and its purported

impact upon the plaintiff.

And we submit that in enacting 5(b)

of the Clayton Act, the Congress clearly intended to spell out
the requirement that each plaintiff, relying upon section 5(b)
to toll the statute of limitations, must take the minimal step
of stating its claim within the period prescribed by the statute.
Now, where there is no class action, of course, that
would require the filing of the short and plain statement of
the claim pursuant to rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.
Q

But not if it is a good class action.

MR. O'MALLEY:

But in the case, Mr. Justice White, of

a proper class action, we would submit that it is the legislative
intent in enacting 5(b) of the Clayton Act that each member of
the class respond affirmatively to the order of the court in­
viting the members of the class to state their claims, and that
they do so within the period of the statute of limitations.
The legislative history —
Q

Well, that would be impossible for unnamed

members of the class in this case.

Utah didn’t file until eleven

8

days before the year expired»

By the time the court would, get

around to ruling on the class, the one-year period would have
expired to all unnamed members.
MR. O'MALLEY:

Well, of course, you have to — that

is —
Q

Unless you are going to say — and I was asking

you whether pending the court's ruling the limitations period
is tolled?
MR. O'MALLEY:

No.

To say that pending the court's

action pursuant to rule 23, the action is tolled, is to say
that rule 23 in some manner abridges or modifies section 5(b)
of the Clayton Act.
Q

So you do say then that in this case unnamed

members of the class could not participate in the action at
all?
MR. O'MALLEY:

I am saying that they cannot do so

unless they affirmatively within that period —
Q

Within that eleven days?

MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes.

I would point out, however, that

within the — this action had — this is not a bare bones, this
was not one case, it is a series of cases, and practically
there are opportunities in seven prior class actions and in­
vitations to join, but forgetting that factual background,
the fact is that they did not move to intervene at any time
within the statutory period, and I would submit that unless it

9

had held that rule 23 somehow abridges or somehow modifies
section 5(b) of the Clayton Act,, there is no power in the court
to permit intervention after the period of the running of the
statute of limitations.
Q

Mr. O’Malley, isn’t it possible to defend Judge

Pence's decision in the District Court consistently with the
reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, saying in effect that the
statute was tolled during the pendency of the notion, but in
the time following Judge Pence's ruling on the class action,
the eleven days afterwards, that the plaintiffs were then under
an obligation to file actions of their own, and that his de­
cision denying intervention might be justified on grounds ap­
plicable to intervention without saying that they were cut off
had those chosen to file their own actions rather than to inter­
vene in Utah’s action?
MR. O’MALLEY:

I would think the answer to your ques­

tion is in the affirmative, Mr. Justice P.ehnquist.

I think

very clearly it would be possible to, within the discretionary
realm of the — support the trial court under rule 24(b) to
justify the acts of the trial court only in terms of the motion
as being clearly within the discretion of the trial court, and
the trial court, by reason of its knowledge and experience in
the West Coast Pipe case, in v/hich it receded, and within the
framework of the time that was available to the respondents
during the period prior to the running of the statute, and in

10
the framework of the fact that the facts of this case showed
that counsel for — appearing on behalf of respondents in this
case at this tiine had been studying this action for six months,
and prior to the filing of the suit, and is charged with the
knowledge of the problems of the statute of limitations growing
out of the prior litigation.

I think in the light of that

history, clearly the court is justified in exercising its
discretion, and I think incorporating its decision respecting
the class action in its decision on the motions to intervene,
I think it clearly was exercising the discretion which Your
Honor has referred to.
Q

Well, Judge Pence did say that as a second

reason, intervention just isn't permissible in this case?
MR. O’MALLEY:

Q

Yes.

Now, what happened to that ground in the Court

of Appeals?
MR. O'MALLEY:

Q

Well, it was argued —

They just didn’t reach it?

MR. O’MALLEY:

— in terms of the briefs before the

Court of Appeals, we argued two points, number one, that it
was incumbent upon the respondents to show an abuse of the
discretion which had been exercised by the trial court, and
we argued that they had not shown such an abuse.
Q

Even if they weren’t barred by the statute of

limitations, they shouldn't have been allowed to intervene?

11
MR. O'MALLEY?
Q

That is; correct.

Which Judge Pence did say.

MR. O'MALLEY;

And suffice it to say that except for

the dissenting opinion by the Ninth Circuit, the dissenting
opinion stated in so many words that it was the judgment of the
court that the trial court has considered this and, as a matter
of discretion, and exercising that discretion, that discretion
should be upheld by the Court of Appeals,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

But that —

We will resume there after

lunch, Mr. O'Malley.
[Whereupon, at 12;00 o'clock noon the Court was re­
cessed until 1;00 o'clock p.m.]

AFTERNOON SESSION — 1:00 P.M.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. O'Malley, you may

continue.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JESSE R. O'MALLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — Continued
MR. O'MALLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

The question was raised in the hearing before the
recess as to whether members of the purported class could have
intervened in the eleven-day period before the statute of
limitations ran, assuming there was a valid class action.

Of

course, that is not this case, for the trial court specifically
held, and it has not been the subject of any appeal, that there
is no class action in this case.

But I should point out that

where that has been found, that the members of the non-class
are no worse off than if the class action had not been alleged
or if a litigant was a member of the class or was not a member
of the class.

The mere allegation that there was or was not

a class should not be held to give to parties who may fall
within the designation of the class some privileged status
when Congress has specifically held that section 5(b) of the
Clayton Act is a barring statute under the circumstances of
this case.
That is true because the basic contention of the
respondents and the contention which essentially was adopted
by the Court of Appeals is that section 5(b) of the Clayton

13
Act is somehow abridged or modified by rule 23 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, and we would submit that this is
contrary to the enabling Act which expressly authorizes this
Court to promulgate the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but
which prohibits such rules from abridging, enlarging or modify­
ing any substantive right.
Now, of course, the basic premise of the Court of
Appeals and of the respondents in this action is also contrary
to the elementary and hornbook principle that the court rules,
whatever they may be, are subject to congressional statute.,
The legislative history of section 5(b) clearly
establishes that that statute has a dual purpose to give timely
notice of the claims within the period stated by the statute
and the barring of causes of action not timely filed.

Each of

these purposes is thwarted by the decision of the Court of
Appeals.

The mere filing of a class action, whether it is

valid or invalid, doesn't give notice to defendants as to the
claims of the members of the class or non-class which will be
asserted thereunder until members of the class actually do assert
such claims prior thereto, neither members of the class nor
their claims are identified and, further, if it is under rule
23, members of a class have the option to opt out of this
litigation pursuant to rule 23.
Now -- and it is particularly true that the mere
filing of a pleading bearing the label of class action doesn't

have any meaning, doesn't afford any meaningful notice whereas
in this case there have been seven prior class actions in which
the class has been exhaustively solicited.
Now, the history of this case, in the West Coast Pipe
litigation, establishes in very practical terms that the pur­
poses of the statute, that the filing of the statute give
notice to defendants just doesn't exist in this case.

In his

opinion, Judge Pence pointed out that in the West Coast. Pipe
cases some 300 parties intervened and stated claims in those
seven prior class actions.

In this case, after the action was

filed by the State of Utah, no member of the class ever ap­
peared to state their claims until five months after the
limitations period, and they didn't do so even then until they
were solicited by plaintiffs' counsel, and plaintiffs' counsel
obtained leave from respondents' separate boards to present
such claims, and indeed at that point counsel for respondents
stated to respondents — and this is in the record — that the
statute probably ran on May 24, 1969, which was a date some
five months prior to that time, so that intervenors filed this
motion with notice that the statute had run as to them, and
defendants never did have notice of the purported members of
the claims by — of the purported claims by members of the
class until five months after the period prescribed by the
statute.
A case which we believe comes close to being on all

15
fours with this case is Jocono v. Anastasio, which we have
cited in our brief for another point, where Judge Medina, when
he was sitting on the District Court, with respect to a fair
labor standards act, stated that, in a case where a motion to
intervene was, like in this case, filed after the statute had
run, stated that defendants had no notice whatsoever that any
claim was made on behalf of any of the claimants.

That is this

case exactly, because although no class action was alleged
here, in that case, none exists in this case, and Judge Medina
went on to say it will not suffice — he is talking about the
issue of notice here — that someone else has a pending law
suit against the defendant sought to be charged in which a
similar but different claims are alleged..
Now, the language of House Report No. 422, 84th.
Congress, 1st Session, of 1955, we believe confirms the prin­
ciple that timely affirmative notice by each plaintiff is re­
quired to give defendants notice of each claim, and this
appears from the language of that report which states that in
cases V7here the plaintiff*s action has been suspended by the
pendency of government antitrust proceedings, he would be re­
quired to bring his action either within the suspension period,
i.e., one year after the government suit had terminated, or
within the four-year statute.

This clearly stated requirement

mandates, we believe, affirmative action by each claimant
within the statutory period, and any other construction would

16

I

make the barring provision of the statute without meaning.

To

z

permit intervention as- in this case, after the barring period

3

has run, after the statute has run, is tantamount and the

4

equivalent and is identical to granting an additional tolling

5

period.

I

In enacting 5 (b), Congress clearly stated its intent

action, and to grant plaintiffs a reasonable time thereafter xn j

and efficient enforcement of the antitrust law.

J
And thus it

would clearly appear that the congressional policy as stated in )
■

24
25

such report is to eliminate the very kind of additional tolling j
periods authorized by the opinion of the Ninth Circuit.

1?
We s'ubmit that the decision o£ the Ninth Circuit can5
be squared with the attempt tc eliminate tolling extensions
and exceptions * and it can't fos squared with the requirement
that in a case, which is this case, where the statute of limitat
■

tions has been suspended by the pendency of a government anti- f

]

trust proceedings, such plaintiff would be required to bring
his action within one year after the government suit is ter3

minated.
Contrary to the plain meaning of the statute, the
effect of the decision of the Court of Appeals that if a class j
action is filed, members of 'the purported class would be
granted an additional tolling period beyond the statutory
period until the court determines whether the action may be
maintained as a class action.

In this case, it was five months

In Elsen v, Carlisle, which is now pending in this
Court, pursuant to a write of certiorari, the additional tollI*

ing period would have, been approximately five years, and
during this period, under the decision of the Court of Appeals,j
plaintiffs’ counsel is authorised by such opinion to solicit
class members until a negative class has been reached.

At

that point he is able to bring motions on behalf of those he
solicited, and that is what occurred in this case.

And this is}

contrary, we submit, to the principle that the power to create
4

i

tolling extensions and exceptions is limited by the general
rule that when a federal statute of limitations exists, such

I

as 5(b), it acts as a total bar, extinguishing the right to sue.

z

That concept, was stated by this Court in Helraberg v. Armbrecht, j

3

327 U.S. 395, in this language, "If Congress explicitly puts

4

a limit upon the time for enforcing a right which it has

§

created, there is an end of the matter.”
|

a

The Ninth Circuit stated the proposition in somewhat

?

similar language with respect to the statute of limitations

3

with ssspect to the Federal Tort Claims Act, that a federal

S

district court has no jurisdiction to entertain a suit after

10
13

12

the statute of limitations has run.

Despite their contention,

we believe that respondents8 position, if we understand the
thrust of it, is that the barring provisions of — and it is

13

the preraise of the opinion of the Court of Appeals — that the

14

barring provision of 5(b) are somehow limited by rule 23 of

15

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

13

17
18
13

20
21
22
£3

II

We submit that, consistent with the intent of Congress.
the filing of a class action can have no bearing as to whether
claimants have satisfied the statute of limitations.

If rule

23 affects the limitations stated in 5(b) in any respects, it
constitutes an abridgement of such statute by rule of court.
ii

If the applicability of section 5(b) is dependent
w

upon whether the class action is alleged or found, it is a
capricious standard

.which is inconsistent with the clearly

stated congressional intent and, as I have stated earlier,

j

to California and the first major thing that happened was that
the motion to determine- the class was brought on before Judge
Pence.

Judge Pence indicated clearly in my mind that he pre-

2-1

far red to handle these matters through joinder and intervention.;

£4

He made a reference to his vast experience in handling the

25

West Coast pipe cases, and he indicated that -this was a more

though there were affidavits in support thereof, indicated that

there might foe upwards of some 800 members in that class.

S

Judge Pence pointed out that in his experience there probably

wouldn't really be that many members, and he pointed to the fact

7

that California, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Arizona had been

a

involved in the West Coast pipe cases, their populations were

Your Honor.

When Judge Pence read his opinion indicating we

could not maintain the class action, the first thing that
l

occurred to counsel was that we had better move to intervene
and we had better do it within eleven days, because that is the
number of days that were left when the class action was filed,

\

and the Attorney General thereupon sent a telegram to all of
the cities, counties, water districts, sewer districts, advised;
them that this case had been filed in their behalf, advised
them that the court had new decided that it could not b©

How, there were five governmental bodies that did not

ruling and after the eleven days remaining.

Bo we have got

both situations going here.

I don’t think the Ninth Circuit

focused upon these five Johnny-come-lafcelies.
.

Q

Did you give

any thought on behalf of the clientis
I
,

you represent to filing separate original actions within the
leven days, mther than just moving to intervene in the State
of Utah’s action?
MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor, we did, and we decided

that — there is a great deal of talk, and there is talk running!
through these successive opinions concerning relation back, and s
we thought that our best bet to safeguard their rights was a
motion to intervene in this specific case, that after all it
was fried on May 13> 1969, rather than risk having some court
rule that while there is nothing to relate back to, admittedly
'

it is a fiction, we thought-that this was the best way to pro-

ceed.
The motions to intervene were filed, together with
the proposed complaints which, by the way, tracks the original
complaint in this case, when counsel talked about surprise and

j

appealed.

No, the class action aspect has not been!

The state asked that it might be certified for ap­

These applicants, after all, \
jl

were before the court only in the sense of applying for inter
vention, and that was after the class action ruling,
I could find no authority for an unnamed absent
member of a class that had been ordered not to be maintained to

khell theory, and then the representative party versus the one :
that is appealing, such as in the Bisen case, saying that there!
will be no case if it is not a class action, there will be no

case at all.
Q

Mr. Miller, before you move on, does the record

show whether or not, as a matter of fact, any of these 60-odd
agencies, governmental agencies that tried to intervene, had
relied on the pendency of the class action suit?

j

J

28
MR. MILLER:

Well, I feel that it does.

There are

some six or seven affidavits indicating that they were aware of
the class action suit, they discussed it with me or one of my

f

partners or with someone with the Attorney General’s office,
and ‘tliat they were in fact relying on it.

They were waiting

information from the court, waiting for notices to be sent.
One is from Salt Lake City, and one is from Sale Lake County,

j

■

the City of Ogden, Weaver County,
Judge Pence found specifically that they had no right I
to rely, and so "they did not rely.”

That was one of his find•

»

ings.
How, as to the question on abuse of discretion, which:

j

has been mentioned, Judge Pence did exercise his discretion as
to the specific applicants.

He did get it insofar as the claimri

'

included in the four years preceding the filing of the applica-j
iions were concerned.

In other words, he said these claims arei

not barred, and so these parties are before me, and I cannot
deny their motions to intervene. He did back in March, when hej

was ruling on the motions for intervention, in his opinion on
March 30, 1370, said he had no final orders for the applicants.
It was necessary then to have a meeting of all the applicants
and determine whether or not they wanted to sacrifice their

I
i

claims in the preceding four years in order that we could
secure a final order and appeal it to the Ninth Circuit, and
they decided that that would be the better course to pursue.

29
i
«•a

:•

So then he amended the proposed complaint and inter- ;

&

venfcion to eliminate those years that were not barred by the

3

statute of limitations, whereupon some three months later, on

4

July Bt Judge Pence then entered his order, indicating it was a

\

5

final order, that the claims were barred under the statute of

i

S

limitations, denying intervention.

7

So 1 don't feel that — the Ninth Circuit didn't feels
i
that this case involved abuse of discretion in any way;. And if |

8

in fact, it did, I think the Ninth Circuit properly ruled by
10

application that one® he invited intervention as an alternative

IS

to class action procedure, even though it might include some

12

800 members, as he said, 350 members, I can do it better by

e

intervention, then it would certainly be an abuse of discretion \
v
I
to deny those applications for intervention.

I

one sentence that I read to you earlier?
MR. MILLER:

the import of that one sentence.

13

the whole opinion, certainly that was argued to him.

80

other comment I have on abuse of discretion is I think it is

really a threshold question for the Appellate Court to deter­

23

As Professor Moore points out, it is almost an appellate

fiction if they say, well, we don't want to hear the case, and

2S

they say,, wall, he exercised his discretion, and if they really

And as Professor Moore points out, one way or another

I

they usually have to do this anyway.

Well, the Ninth Circuit

did this and they decided the case.

Q

1 suppose in this case, you are not urging that

the class you wanted to define included people whose claims

MR. MILLER:

Q

No, no.

Their claims were not barred —

With the amendment that the unnamed parties

that is necessary is that they receive notice, the best possible

£2

shocks me with the thought that the State of Utah determined

23

that they wanted to undertake to protect the rights of its

24

cities and towns, it labeled the complaint a class action, it

26

defined that complaint to include those .lesser public foodies

There is nothing at all that

1I

32
that purchased pips from these defendants, that that then com­
menced an action and satisfied section 5(b).
Now, the Ninth Circuit I think properly decided this
question, and I think they gave us in my mind the least they
could have.

They indicated that the statute then be — once -

the court determined the class negatively, determined they
could not be maintained, then the statute began to run again,
the eleven days began to run.

And since at least the majority

of these parties filed -within eight days, they were safely in­
side the statute.
I would suggest to the Court that a better rule would
be the one I think was expressed by Justice Douglas in his
concurring opinion in Burnett v. New York Central Railroad, and
that didn't involve class action but it involved a similar
situation.

In that case,

an FELA case, the plaintiff filed an

action in the Ohio court and the statute then run, and then the
plaintiffs discovered that the Ohio court was the wrong court
and that id did not have venue.

There was no saving statute

in Ohio, and there was no law in Ohio by which that case could
be transferred to a proper court, where it was proper venue.
So that case was dismissed, and eight days later, interestingly
enough, that plaintiff filed an action in the federal court.
And this Court held that that satisfied the statute.

New, the

majority in that opinion indicated that the statute did not
begin to run again until the appeal time had run in Ohio, and

33
1

thus that was a final order»

2

feel a better rule was stated,, and that was one© the action had

3

been filed, the statute of limitations was satisfied, and then

4

the manner in which -the plaintiff pursued that was subject to

laches.
