MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Mr. Ringo, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. RINGO
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RINGO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

The issue before this Court today in this case is
is
whether the U.S, Magistrate/empowered by the Federal Magistrates
Act of IS68 to conduct evidentiary hearings in habeas corpus
cases.
I would like to first briefly tell how the case got
to this Court today.

In 1971 the respondent, Carl James

Wedding, after exhausting all of his available State post
conviction remedies filed a petition in the U.S. district
court for the Western District of Kentucky claiming that his
1949 conviction for willful murder was invalid based on the
contention of the court his plea of guilty was
assistance of counsel.

The district court refused his

petition and summarily dismissed it as being without merit.
A certificate of probable cause was submitted.
The respondent, Mr. Wedding, then appealed to the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The Sixth Circuit reversed

and remanded, the district court's decision saying that the
petition presented certain factual questions which required

4
an evidentiary hearing.
On remand the matter was assigned to the U.S.
Magistrate to conduct the evidentiary hearing;,

The evidentiary

hearing was conducted by the magistrate and recorded by an
electronic sound recorder.

The magistrate, after conducting

the hearing, considering all the pleadings and all available
State records, proposed findings of fact and conclusions
of law and his report and recommendation that the petition
of Mr. Wedding be dismissed.
The district court, upon request by counsel for
respondent, Mr, Wedding, gave de novo consideration of the
recorded testimony, the electronically recorded testimony,
of the hearing.

Thereafter, the district judge, after

reviewing all the pleadings, de novo consideration of the
recording of the evidentiary hearing, adopted the magistrate’s
findings of fact and conclusions of lax? and report and recom­
mendation as his own and dismissed the petition.
Whereupon, the respondent once again appealed to
the Sixth Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit reversed again stating
that the U.S. Magistrates are not empowered by the Federal
Magistrates Act to conduct evidentiary hearings in habeas
corpus cases.
We submit that magistrates are empowered by
Section 636(b) of the Federal Magistrates Act to conduct
evidentiary hearings in post trial cases.

636(b) in Substance

5
says that by concurrence of a majority of the judges of the
district court , they can adopt rules assigning additional
duties to the U.S. magistrate, so long as they are not
inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the United States.
Inherent in this language are two limitations of the
duties assignable to the magistrate.
First, the magistrate may act only pursuant to a
rule passed by a majority of the judges of the district court ,
as was done in this case, and
Two, the duty so assignable must be consistent with
the Constitution and lav/s of the United States.
QUESTION:

Does

the rule of the district court

not also provide that either party upon request may require
the district judge to hear, to listen to the transcript of
the testimony?
MR. RXNGO:
QUESTION:

Yes, that's true, youx* Honor.
You may have said that, but if you did I

missed it.
MR. RINGO:

I didn’t say it, but it’s true.

These limitations which I have just mentioned are
recognised by the drafters of the Proposed Rules Governing
Habeas Corpus Proceeding, which is presently before the
Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the
Judicial Conference of the United States.

These proposed rules

give magistrates the power to conduct evidentiary hearings in

Q
habeas corpus cases, citing section, 636(b) as authority.
We submit that allowing a U.S. magistrate to conduct
evidentiary hearings in habeas corpus proceedings is not
inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United
States.
QUESTION:

Don‘t we know that the U.S, magistrate

has to be a lawyer?
MR. RINGOs

The Act requires, your Honor, that the

full-time U.S. magistrate has to be a lawyer except in
situations where there are none available in the districts.
QUESTION:
MR. RINGOs
QUESTION:

So he might not be.
That’s right, your Honor.
So you might have a situation where a

U.S. magistrate is proposing findings and conclusions when
he is not a lawyer, even though a conviction, for instance,
has been affirmed up through the Kentucky court system.

Does

this bother you at all?
MR. RINGO:

In the instant case it does not because

our magistrate was a member, of the bar,
The duty of appointing the magistrate is upon the
concurrence of a majority of the district judges, and I would
submit that the judges would select a very qualified person
in the event there were no lawyers.
QUESTION:

Do you know whether there are any full­

time magistrates in the United States that have been appointed

7
and now serving who are not lawyers?
MR. RJNGO:

I have no statistics on it.

I know

that the U.S. Commissioner system which this system replaced,
that 30 percent were not lawyers.
The respondent in the Sixth Circuit submitted that
the Magistrates Act was inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus
Act.

In constructing two statutes on like subjects, it is

necessary to look to the intent and purpose of both Acts.

The

intent and purpose of the Habeas Corpus Act was to determine
with regard to the detention of a person held in restraint of
his liberty.

The intent of the Magistrates Act in respect to

haveas corpus petitions, it was clearly the intention of
Congress to have magistrates assist the overburdened courts
which were overburdened by habeas corpus applications by
reviewing habeas corpus applications and conducting evidentiary
hearings if necessary in order that the judge might have
before him all the facts andfcircumstances surrounding the
petition to facilitate his ultimate determination of the
facts of the petition.
Now, in order that this new tier of judicial office
which was created by this Magistrates Act of 1963, in order
that they might be able to perform this function, Congress
upgraded the old Commissioner system not only in position but
in the qualifications so that magistrates would be qualified
to adequately perform the much-needed assistance to the

8
judges of their crowded dockets of habeas corpus petitions.
For tills reason we submit that the Magistrates Act is
consistent with the Habeas Corpus i-\ot and actually fosters
and supports its purpose and intent and that it ensures that
the person who is detained is given a prompt determination
as to the legality of the restraining of his liberty.
QUESTION;

Mr. Ringo, v/hat comment do you have about

the provision in 636(b)(3), zeroing in on preliminary review
of applications for posttrial relief, ending up "to facilitate
the district judge having jurisdiction over the case as
whether there should be a hearing."
MR. RINGO:

The intention of Congress on that

636(b)(3) was clear that this was merely a suggested rather
than a required duty.

Therefore, it is not exclusive on the

subject of ways in which the magistrates might be used in
habeas corpus proceedings.

The Congress intended to make this

636(b) purposely broad and flexible in order that the judges
might be able to utilize the magistrates to the efficiency of
the district court.

QUESTION:

I suppose the district judge might,

report and recommendations and listening to the electronic
recording might then decide to conduct a full-scale hearing

himself.
MR. RINGO:

That is well within his Province.

The

9

district judge can accept, reject, amend, do what he wants to
with the magistrate’s report, findings of fact and conclusions
of law, and so forth.
So we submit also that the Magistrates Act is not
inconsistent with the Constitution.

Argument has been made

with respect to Article III of the Constitution.

Article III

vests the judicial power in the Supreme Court and other
inferior courts, as the district court.
QUESTION:

Did the Sixth Circuit touch upon the

constitutional issue at all?

Or did they decide it as a matter

of statutory construction?
MR. RINGO:

Primarily statutory construction on

the theory of use and generis.
QUESTION:

And if we should disagree with them, do

you think then that the case should be remanded to have them
consider the constitutional issue in the first place?
MR. RINGO:
should be considered.

I really — the constitutional issue
As far as the constitutional issue

concerning Article III, the Congress stated it was their
intention that the magistrates would not have the power to
make the ultimate determination of facts.

And we concede this

point that the ultimate determination of facts must be made
by the Article III judge himself.
QUESTION:

What sort of a proceeding do you have

before Judge Gordon in the district court after the magistrate

has made findings like these?

QUESTIONi

Did the parties have an opportunity to

Judge Gordon?
MR. RXNGOs

I don’t believe there was any objection

by either party.
For the foregoing reasons,

assigning

additional duty to the U.S. magistrate of conducting an
evidentiary hearing in habeas corpus proceeding is neither
inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United
States, and we submit that this may be done.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH G. GLASS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GLASS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

13

the Courts

It j.s the respondent's contention that the decision

of the district court of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals
should be affirmed*

We have contended through these proceedings

from the very inception that the language of 20 U.S.C. 636(b)(3)
is very clear and very explicit in that it provides for a
preliminary review by the magistrate of post conviction and
posttrial proceedings and it provides for a report and
recommendations as to whether there should be an evidentiary
hearing.

And it has been our contention that the language is

very clear on that, that it doesn’t provide that a magistrate
may hold himself an evidentiary hearing.
QUESTION:

What do you think section (2 )of the statute

means — assistance to a trial judge in the conduct of pretrial
or discovery proceedings in civil or criminal.

Do you think

that would embrace a pretrial proceeding for the suppression
of evidence or not?
MR. GLASSs

No, sir, I don't think it does embrace

a -—
QUESTION:

What criminal matters do you think

section (2)covers?
MR. GLASS:

I would think that — it’s my impression,

Mr. Chief Justice, that that would encompass something like a
pretrial conference whereby the party litigants through
counsel —
QUESTION:

Do you have many pretrial conferences in

14
civil cases? — in criminal cases., I meant to say.
MR. GLASS:

There are a few.

There are not many.

QUESTION; Are they directed at the suppression type
motion?
MR. GLASS;

Many of them are the suppression type

motions or motions on constitutionality of statutes, things of
that matter.

But from time to time there are conferences with

the court on legal matters in criminal cases.
QUESTION:

Why is it that you say that a magistrate

couldn *t hear a suppression matter under paragraph (2}? It seems
to cover by its teras» doesn't it?
MR. GLASS:

As I interpret Criminal Rule 41 and as

I have read the cases, that's within the province of the
district court judge and that's a fact-finding process.

laid

I think that's what we are talking about here in these
proceedings, fact-finding processes.
QUESTION:

But paragraph (i)of the rule talks about

services of special master in an appropriate civil action.
Certainly that's a fact-finding process.
MR. GLASS:

Yes, sir, that's an advisory position,

but it's not an evidentiary position.
QUESTION:

•

Is this not advisory when the report is

subject to requiring the judge to listen to the tape recording?
MR. GLASS:

Not as this Court in 1941 interpreted

Holiday v» Johnston and later in 1963 interpreted Townsend v.

Sane

when, it talked about the demeanor of witnesses and the

credibility of witnesses.

That’s within the province, I think,

of the district judge.
QUESTION;

If a challenge is made there, is there

anything in this statute that prevents the judge from saying
after he has listened to the tape recording that, "I think
there are serious and possibly difficult questions of credibility
here, so we will set this down for a hearing."

Isn't that

Now, there are certain things that he

I think the legislative history of the Act goes a

long way towards explaining when it says to alleviate the
judge from having to do the routine task*
QUESTION:

Would that go at least as far as having

magistrates sufficiently examine the matter to be able to say
to the district judge, "It's my recommendation that you do
or don't have a hearing."
MR. GLASS:

I think that’s permissible, because

law clerks have been functioning in that capacity for years.
That’s an advisory —
QUESTION:

But your position is he can't, and so

the Sixth Circuit held.

He can’t go beyond that and conduct

the actual evidentiary hearing and submit the record of that
evidentiary hearing to the district judge.
MR. GLASS:

That is our contention, your Honor,

based on Holiday v. Johnston and actually Townsend y. Sane
when it talks about the province of the district judge weighing
the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses, which is
unquestionably a very important and perhaps in many instances
the most important step in the habeas corpus matter as such,

QUESTION:

masters appointed and the evidence will be taken by the special
master and the judge will ultimately determine the facts without
ever having seen the witnesses.
MR. GLASS:

Well, in civil proceedings I have less

concern about that than I do in habeas corpus.
QUESTION:

But isn't that the case?

Isn't that true?

Isn't it true that that's what happens on the civil side with
special masters?
MR. GLASS;

I'm not that knowledgeable, Mr. Justice

White, to really give you a good answer on that.
QUESTION:

Are not all the cases in the United States

Court of Claims cases that involve many millions of dollars
tried in just that way?
MR. GLASS:
QUESTION;

Yes, as I understand it.
The Commissioner makes a report and

recommendations and the court then reviews it and decides to
accept or reject.
MR. GLASS:

From reading some of the background on

habeas corpus, this is my understanding.

But here again some

of the authors, and I believe that's been covered in "Twenty
2

Am.Jur„Trials," an

article by Mr. Scople

and also in

83 Harvard Law Review, that is, define these type of proceedings

as advisory proceeding’s, it*s my recollection.
QUESTION;

Th±3 is a civil proceeding that we’re

reviewing here, isn't it?
MR. GLASS;

Federal habeas is a civil -—

It’s denominated as such, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, but I don’t think it fully — I would go back to
legislative history on that where Mr. Fred Vinson had some
colloquy.
QUESTION:

Do you think he prevailed?

I doubt it.

Senator Tydings gave him rather a difficult time, didn't he?
MR. GLASS:

Yes, sir, he 3u.re did.

QUESTION:

Didn't he say in response to one question

when Mr. Vinson said he assumed it did not intend to cover
some of these things.

The answer was, "We certainly intend that.

We intend to lift this off the shoulders of the judges — to
lift off the shoulders of the judges as much of the routine
nature of discovery or fact-finding operation connected with
post conviction proceedings and petitions as possible."

So

that the Congress was presented with the two conflicting views
and seems to have adopted Senator Tydings' view of master.
MR. GLASS’;

If the Court please, I subscribe to Mr.

Vinson’s view.
QUESTION:

I suppose really in your emphasis on

Holiday you get back to the fact that the words used to be

And then Congress amended it just

20

MR. GLASS:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

And yet you're certain at least that made

no change, and obviously whatever else may be true of the
Magistrates Act, the Habeas Corpus Act always said "court" and
meant "court" period.
MR. GLASS:
QUESTION:
MR. GLASS:
QUESTION:
MR. GLASS:
QUESTION:

Yes, it does,
That meant an Article III court.
28 U.S.C. 2243 speaks in specific language.
That's really the gist of it.
Yes, sir,
And I gather that's actually the basis

for the Sixth Circuit both in this case and in Wingo isn't it?
MR. GLASS:

Yes, sir.

And here again, going back

to legislative history, initially when the statute was drafted
it provided for preliminary consideration rather than preliminary
review and because of all of the evidence that came out as
a result of the hearings, they redrafted the legislation to
say preliminary revietv of posttrial matters.
QUESTION:

Certainly the statute could have been more

clearly expressed.
MR. GLASS:
QUESTION:

Unquestionably it could have.
Mr. Glass, what is your comment about the

provision in the statute giving the magistrate the power to
conduct certain trials under section 3401 of the Code?

If he

has that power, xirhat is so wrong with giving him the power

21
to conduct a preliminary hearing of this kind?
MR. GLASS:

Mr. Justice Blackmun, there are some

provisions in that statute which I think are important for this
Court to consider.

Number one, the magistrate in those Federal

crimes statutes has jurisdiction of those crimes which are
normally denominated as misdemeanors carrying up to a year in
the penitentiary, up to a thousand dollar fine, or both.
However, there is also the provision that the defendant and
the Government have to agree to the trial before the magistrate.
And there is also, of course, the right of appeal to the
district court.
But I think that’s a very important distinction
because not only does it take the agreement of the parties, but
the magistrate only has that limited jurisdiction.

Whereas,

if this Court were to hold that the magistrate had the authority
to hold evidentiary hearings, he would be weighing the liberty
of people filing habeas corpus

who are incarcerated for a

much lengthier period of time, as for example the respondent
in this case who is under a life sentence.
i ;

QUESTION:

Mr. Glass, how far do you think the

magistrate can go on a habeas?
MR. GLASS:

On a habeas?

I would suggest, Mr.

Justice Marshall, that he can review the pleadings, that he
can appoint counsel when necessary, that with the aid of
counsel he can define the legal issues, that with the aid of

22

counsel

he can set out an order of proof for the evidentiary

proceedings if that should he necessary, that he can submit,
a summary of the case to the district judge, and that with
the aid of counsel on both sides he can project the length of
the hearing that might be required before the district court»
QUESTION:

Can he recommend that no hearing is

necessary?
MR. GLASS:

Certainly I think that's within his

province.
QUESTION:

Doesn't the judge accept that and there

is no problem with it?
MR. GLASS:

If he is recommending as a matter of law,

I don't think there* is anything ~~ I think he's authorized
to do that under the Act.
QUESTION:

Mr. Glass, did you object during the

proceedings before the magistrate that he was not empowered
or ought not to foe conducting this sort of a hearing?
MR. GLASS?

In point of fact, Mr. Justice Rehnquist,

I filed a motion, a lengthy motion with the memorandum brief
to disqualify the magistrate from holding the evidentiary
hearing prior to it.
QUESTION:
MR. GLASS:

Is that in the record?
Yes, sir, and it's contained in the

appendix on pages 15, 16, and the memorandum is 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27.

QUESTION:

That is correct.
I am a little confused.

make recommendations to the judge that no hearing need be
held and if the judge accepts that recommendation, .it's all
right.

But he may not go beyond that and hear the testimony
t

and then make proposed recommendations or proposed findings of
fact to the judge to the same end that no further hearing is
necessary.
MR. GLASS:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that that

would be the postfcriai consideration that he would be
authorized to do.

I think primarily he would be directing

himself as a matter of law, looking towards whether the habeas
corpus satisfies the prerequisites of Townsend v. Sane, 1963,
and _____?

v. Noye in 1963.

But here again, looking towards

the legal aspects and the formality of the pleadings and
thereafter submit a report on whether there should be an
evidentiary hearing.
QUESTION:

Does that suggest, for example, he might

take the State record and go all through that and conclude
that the requirements of Townsend, say, have been satisfied
and that for that reason the case could be decided on the
State record without any further Federal hearing.

25
MR» GLASS:

Townsend v» Sana

allows that, and he

would have to —
QUESTION:
MR. GLASS:

And the magistrate could do this much?
Yes, sir, I think he would have to serve

notice on the parties as to his report and recommendations
along those lines.
QUESTION:

If he had that basis, that goes rather

far because he is now making the decision that there is a
sufficient hearing in the State proceeding not to require
an additional one and that the Federal constitutional claims,
whatever they may be, may be decided on the basis of the
State record without supplementing it with any Federal record.
MR. GLASS:
stood your question.

Mr. Justice Brennan, perhaps I misunder­
I think he can male© recommendations based

upon the law to the judge.

I think the judge — and I don’t

think there is any question within the circuits that the
district judge is the ultimate decider of the question.

And

I don't think that should ever be changed.
QUESTION:

I expect in many of these habeas corpus

cases it ought to be true that the constitutional claims can
be determined on a State record without supplementing it with
a Federal record.
MR. GLASS:
QUESTION

As I read Townsend -That’s what Townsend contemplated.

Can a magistrate be given the responsibility, do you

26
think,of examining the State record, concluding that it
suffices for the decision of the Federal constitutional claims
and therefore recommend there is no reason to have any further
hearing?
MR. GLASS:

I think he can draw his own conclusions

in that regard and submit them to the district judge by way
of documentation and outline in that report and recommendations
why he believes his findings to be correct.

And if the

district judge accepts it, then I suppose perhaps they can
dismiss the petition as having been satisfied in the State
proceeding.
QUESTION:

And then that is, of course, appealable.

MR. GLASS:

Yes, sir, it is.

QUESTION s

That happened in this very case the

first time up in the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appealsf
a little different panel, Judge Miller sitting instead of
Judge Phillips — no, instead of Judge Cecil, remanded the
case for a hearing.
MR. GLASS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
That is what happened in this case, and

that is always appealable.

The question is whether that

hearing was given as directed by the Court of Appeals the
first time around.
MR. GLASS:

Yes, sir.

I think it is very important to consider the cases

27
that have been cited by both parties in the brief and also
as petitioner has conceded on page 12 of his brief,, that the
magistrates do not have the authority to decide and make
ultimate determination of fact ca.ses or controversies.

This

must be left to Article III courts.
QUESTION:

Does anyone contend that they have final

authority?
MR. GLASS:
QUESTION:
MR. GLASS:

I think if you —~
In the Article III sense?
In the Article III, that the magistrates

have authority —
QUESTION s

I have not found anyone who claimed that

there is any finality about the magistrate’s finding or
recommendations any more than there is with a commissioner of the
Court of Claims or a hearing examiner of the Federal Power
Commission.
MR. GLASS:

Not as such, but many of the courts have

expressed, for example, in Rainhow v. Cassidy, the pro forma
laying on of hands of the magistrate's report and recommendations
without, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggested, anyone being there
to review how much input went into that particular review of
the report and recommendations.

I think that is the major

concern in some of the cases that have even upheld or gone
towards upholding the magistrate's holding the evidentiary
hearings.

For example —■

23

QUESTION:

There was no hearing the first time, and

then the Court of Appeals sent it back, not to the magistrate,
but he sent it back to the district court for a hearing in
the district court, didn't he?
MR. GLASS:

That is correct.

And then at that time

the district court appointed the magistrate.
During this intervening time the magistrate had been
appointed, as a matter of fact,
late, as I recall.

fie was appointed in 1971,

Prior to that we had a commissioner during

the first three years that the Act was in effect.
t

QUESTION:

After the magistrate, in this case, filed

his report and recommendations, summary, and sent the electronic
tape up, was there anything to preclude the petitioner's
lawyer from filing a request for -- filing exceptions to the
report and asking for oral argument?
MR. GLASS:

Mr. Chief Justice, the rule doesn’t

provide for oral argument.
QUESTION;

All right.

Does anything prevent him

from doing it?
MR. GLASS:

No, sir, but I did file a memorandum

taking exceptions to the magistrate’s report, and it was a
lengthy —
QUESTION:

Then it is up to the court whether to

grant oral argument on that or not, I guess.
MR. GLASS:

Yes, sir.

29
QUESTION:
MR. GLASS?
QUESTION:

Did he grant oral argument?
NO, sir.
We, of course,

decide an enormous

number of cases here without oral argument, as you know.
MR. GLASS:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Is one of your concerns, Mr. Glass, what

I would consider a perfectly legitimate feeling that although
the rule perhaps contemplates the district judge sits there
and listensto the tapesf if he is busy and doesn't want to
just duplicate the time that the magistrate put in, he may
short-circuit that process a little bit?
MR. GLASS:

I think it is a legitimate concern,

It is not a particular concern of me in that let me just say
that I have a degree of faith in the three district judges
that we have in the Western District of Kentucky.

However,

I do think that to allow the magistrate to hold an evidentiaryhearing and still say that it is within the province of the
Article III judge to hold another evidentiary hearing is just
one more step in the judicial process, and I do not think that
is what the Act was intended for.

It is like another appeal.

If the district judge rules that the magistrate's findings of
fact and conclusions of law are correct, then you go up to the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in our situation, and so on.
And I do not think that is what the Act calls for.

The

Act, I believe, was intended simply to reduce the routine and

30
mundane workload of the district judge so that he could
address himself to things like evidentiary hearings.

And the

Sixth Circuit noted in their opinion in this case that they
could not see how an evidentiary hearing, that is listening
to the tape de novo, would require any more time than an
actual evidentiary hearing.

And along the lines of the

suggestion I have made that the magistrate can do, I think
that he could reduce the time necessary for an evidentiary
hearing and could probably almost pinpoint it by taking these
proceedings through with counsel in the form of prehearing
conferences with counsel, because counsel is appointed.

And.

then submit a report to the judge that the hearing is going
to take 45 minutes? it's going to take an hour and a half?
it’s going to take three hours? these are the witnesses that,
will probably be called? these are the issues that will
probably be determined? these are the facts that will
probably be determined.
QUESTION:

Supposing that the district court held

a hearing under those ground rules.

Would you say that the

district judge v?culd be justified in excluding out of hand
any effort on the part of either party to go beyond the
magistrate's recommendations as to the issues that evidence
should be received on?
MR. GLASS;

I think if it were important, and I

would submit that if that were the situation, that there 'would

in all probability be a proviso that written motions oxrequests or notices could foe filed with the court if the
hearing were going to include anything other than that which
was laid out by the recommendations of the magistrate.
QUESTION:

But supposing you filed your motion or

notice, would the district court be justified on the basis of
the magistrate’s recommendations to say, "No, I don’t propose
to hear that one.

We will limit it to the issues specified

by the magistrate."
MR. GLASS:

I think if you go back — if I can make

an analogy — if you go back to the appellate process and if
the petitioner and/or his counsel knew at the time they had
the prehearing conference with the magistrate that certain
matters were available, that certain people were available,
they wanted to get a certain issue into evidence that they
knew at that time and didn’t disclose it, then I think they woul ■
not be entitled to bring it up by way of notice or within the
hearing itself under those circumstances.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Bo you have anything

further, Mr. Ringo?
Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

['Whereupon, at 3 p.m., the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.3
