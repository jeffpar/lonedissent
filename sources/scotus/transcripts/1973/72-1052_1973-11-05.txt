MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-1052» Rogers C. 3. Morton, Secretary of the
Interior v. Ramon Rule, et ux.
Mr. Sachse, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.f
OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SACHSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is here on a write of certiorari to the
deicision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

That

court held essentially that a supplemental welfare benefit
that the Bureau, of Indian Affairs provides for Indians who
live on Indian reservations and Indians who live within the
jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Oklahoma and
Alaska must be applied, must be made available for Indians
throughout the country.

The court did that not on constitu­

tional grounds but. as an interpretation of the statutes under
which the program is conducted.
We think that that is a misinterpretation of those
statutes and that it would require the Bureau of Indian
Affairs to conduct a program that Congress has not appropri­
ated money for, and it is on that basis that we ask the Court
to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit.
Now, I would like to take a minute to describe what

4
the program is that we are talking about.
Through the Social Security Act, there are four or
five — I think it is four types of categorical welfare
assistance, aid for dependent children, aid for the blind and
so forth, that under federal sponsorship are available
throughout the country through the states.

There is another,

which is under different legislation, the unemployment insur­
ance programs.
But what is missing from this program that is avail­
able throughout the United States is anything in the way of a
general assistance program that will give money to ablebodied people who are chronically out of work.

This is the

issue that the country hats faced in terms of — or perhaps
has failed to face, in terms of a negative income tax or some
sort of income maintenance program.
Because this is missing from the federal legislation,
the states have dons with it pretty much as they please.

Some

states have fairly important income assistance programs, others
do not.

Some states do it on a statewide basis, others do it

on county by county.
The situation became clear that in Indian reserva­
tions , where the Indian tribe itself has the basic government
and where that government is under the direct supervision of
the federal government, that the federal government ought to
undertake this kind, of income maintenance program.

And it did

5
undertake this kind of program in a cash payment program
rather than giving provisions,, which had been done earlier,
in the early 1950?s.

And this is the program that we are

talking about, a program that has some flaws in it, that has
worked fairly well, some people think; other people think
that it tends to discourage people from going out and getting
jobs.

But this is the program, and the question is whether

Indians who live off reservations have a right to this program
under the legislation and eventually 1' suppose the question
is whether it is constitutional to make this discrimination
on the basis of residents on a reservation.
0

Suppose, Mr. Sachse, you had in this particular

company the Indian who is in question hers, and I suppose a
number of white, Caucasians working for this same company,
the;, are all on strike and they are all living in the same
town.

Under the Ninth Circuit holding, is it correct that the

Indian would get some benefits that the white strikers would
not?
MR. SACHSE:

That is correct.

The Ninth Circuit

has held, as we read the opinion, that since the Bureau of
Indian Affairs providas this supplemental welfare program for
Indians on reservations, it must provide it for Indians every­
where, or at least the narrowest reading of the decision is
it must provide it for Indians in the situation of Mr, Ruiz.
That would mean Mr. Ruiz would get these benefits, whereas

strikers would not.
1 would like to take a minute just to state, which
we have already alluded to, and that is the situation of Mr.
Ruis here.

Mr. Ruiz — Mr. and Mrs. Ruiz, really.

Mr. and

Mrs. Ruiz are Papago Indians, as far as I know full-blood.
They lived on the Papago Reservation until 1939 or 1940.

At

that time, Mr. Ruiz moved 16 miles away to a town called Ajo.
Q

A. jo?

MR. SACHSE:

Ajo.

He moved there and got a job in

the copper mines and he. apparently worked steadily in those
copper mines until 1967, at which time the plant went cut on
strike.

Nobody under Arizona law, none of the striking workers

were entitled, to general assistance or unemployment compensa­
tion payments.
Mr. Ruiz,i unable to get the Arizona payments, applied
to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to see whether he could get
payments there, and he was denied those payments on the basis
that he did not, neither he nor his wife resided on the
reservation.
Now, I would like to discuss the statutes under
which the Bureau operates this program.
Q

Mr. Sach.se, could I interrupt you there.

Sup­

pose that this particular applicant was able to work at the
mines but the reservation was right across the street, and he
maintained his residence on the reservation.

Would he have

7
been eligible under some other program at. that time?
MIU SACHSE:

As I understand it, he would have been

eligible for this program,, if he had. resided on the reserva­
tion ,
Q

So that his white counterpart would not?

MR, SACHSE:

That is correct.

That is correct.

It would be very much as if you had people who live in the
State of New York who go to work in the State of New Jersey,
The person who still lives in New York will get whatever
benefits the State of New York offcers, I suppose, and people
who move from the State of New York and move into New Jersey
then are under the — will gat. whatever benefits New Jersey
supplies, rather than New York,
Q

Well, what is the situation as to a person who

lives on a reservation, is he eligible

generally for state or

federal welfare type programs?
MR. SACHSE:

Yes, Your Honor, he is.

The law as we

understand it , and as every court that has ruled on that so
far has held. that an Indian is a full-fledged citizen of the
United States , whether he lives on or off a reservation, and
whatever welfare program that the federal government offers
or that the state offers statewide would have to be available
on reservations as well as off reservations.

And this

program —

Q

I take it your opponents do not necessarily

8
agree with that?
MR. SACHSE:

No, I think they agree with that, though

you would have to ask them that.
Q

It is unusual to find an Indian getting more

than a white man, isn't it?
MR. SACHSE:

I think it is for that reason that this

case is here.
Q

It is almost un-American.

Q

Mr. Sachs©, do these Indians pay federal income

taxes on their money earned?
MR, SACHSE:

On the money — I would assume that Mr.

Ruiz pays normal federal income taxes.
Q

Is he subject to federal income tax?

MR. SACHSE:
Q

I take it the strike is long since over?

MR. SACHSE:
and it is over.

I think so.

The strike lasted about eleven months,

On the statutory dates, I want to say first

that the President, through delegation of the Secretary of
the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, had very broad
authority under 25 U.S.C. 2 and 25 U„S. 9 to make such rules
and regulations and decisions as are necessary in this area.
But the act that we are primarily concerned with here is the
Snyder Act, which was passed in 1922.
clear on its face.

And I think the act is

It is the authorization act for the Bureau

of Indian Affairs to provide health, education, welfare, and.

9

all sorts of other services to Indians wherever they live in
the country«
We don’t say that this act prohibits the Bureau of
Indian Affairs from doing things for Indians off reservations.
But I think it is quite clear that the act simply is the
authorisation act, it created no programs? and the legisla­
tive history is clear on this, too, that to solve points of
order, that there was no authorisation for the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, that Congress passed this particular act.

I

won’t burden the Court with going through what I have done in
detail in my brief there.
The language of it is clear.

The Bureau of Indian

Affairs, under the supervision of the Secretary of the
Interior, shall direct, supervise and expend such monies as
Congress nay from time to tine appropriate f crthe benefit,
cars and assistance of the Indians throughout the United
Staes

for the following purposes:
General support and civilisation, including educa­

tion „
At the time this act was passed, there was no gen­
eral support program, financial support program, either on or
off Indian reservations, or in the country as a whole.

Social

legislation of the 193 05s hadn't been passed at that time.
I think that the respondents are really reaching
to take the language in that act and to say that

it commands

10
the Secretary of the Interior to institute a welfare program,
and that that welfare program must be for Indians both on and
off reservations.

And one I would say certainly neutral

observer of this act, Mr. Wolf, who I think had some role in
representing the respondents in this case, has written a very
Law Review article on this subject.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will take up at that ,

point at 10:00 o'clock in the morning, Mr. Sachse.
[Whereupon, at 3:00 o’clock p.nu, the Court was
adjourned, to reconvene on Tuesday, November 6, 1973, at 10:00
a.ra. ]
