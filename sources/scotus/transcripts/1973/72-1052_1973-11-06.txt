PRO CEEDINC S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume argument

in Morton v. Ruis.
Mr. Sachse, I think you had

the lectern when we

closed last night.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY R. SACHSE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - RESUMED
MR. SACHSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
When we closed yesterday, I was about to say that I
thought the Snyder Act has been well summed up by Mr. Wolf,
who at an earlier stage was counsel in this case, in which he
described the act in a Law Review article this way.

He said,

"The Snyder Act. is a familiar and somewhat distressing
occurrence in the history of Indian affairs.

As in other

instances, Congress enacted a very general measure and left
the rest up to the Secretary of the Interior and the BIA."

I

think that is what the Snyder Act did so, except that I would
add one other thing.

It also left the rest up to future

Congresses in their appropriations procedures.
Now, in all the recent years, including the appro­
priations for fiscal year 1968, which are at issue here, the
Secretary of the Interior has submitted to the Congress a
request for funds for a. welfare program for Indians in this
language:

"General assistance will be provided to needy

Indians on reservations who are not eligible for public assis­
tance under the Social Security Act,”

Each year Congress has

published that language in its reports in favor of the bill.
Q

Mr. Sachse, what is the government's response

to the claims that the Secretary really does provide welfare
for a lot of non-reservation Indians?
MR. SACHSE:
0

Well —

Oklahoma, Alaska —

MR. SACHSE:

— I think there are two problems there.

One is Oklahoma and Alska.

I think it is just simply correct,

that this statement that has been made to the Congress is a
compact

and too abbreviated statement that, for it to be

absolutely accurate, it. should say for Indians on reservations
and in the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in
Oklahoma and Alaska.
Q

Well, why do you provide welfare for non­

reservation Indians in Oklahoma?
MR. SACHSE:

Well, in Oklahoma, the reason is the

following, that a whole section of the State of Oklahoma was
once Indian territory and was totally occupied with Indian
re s e rvations.
Q

I understand that,

MR. SACHSE:
getting at.

The second part of this is what I am

The reservations have been abolished, the tribal

organisations have not been abolished.

The Indians there live

15
on trust property and with a good deal of property still
managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, such as in the Mason
case we had last year„

And the Bureau's interpretation of

that has been that the lands that it administers in Oklahoma
are equivalent to reservations.
Q

Well, what about Indians — they call attention

to another example, the Turtle Mountain Reservation in North
Dakota, the Indians, those Indians can live anywhere they want
to and still get welfare.
MR. SACHSE:

That is what --

The Bureau of Indian Affairs has also

made this interpretation of the statute, that where there are
Indians living on trust land that is administered by the
agency near a reservation, they simply treat that as if it
were on the reservation.

In other words, they haven't been

as rigid in saying that if you are off reservation there is
absolutely nothing, as one might hope for a mechanical appli­
cation of the law.
What they have said in the Turtle Mountain instance,
they have simply equated it administratively, people living on
trust land, allotted land —
Q

Does that go for the

MR. SACHSE:
Q

Rapid City Indians too?

I don't think that is trust land.

I know, but it is said here in the brief that

Indians residing in Rapid City, South Dakota get welfare to
some extent.

That isn't even close to a reservation.

MR» SACHSE:
under this program,

I am not aware of them getting welfare
Now, 1 should mention that there is

another program that does quite openly and under congressional
authorisation provide welfare for off-reservation Indians,
That is what is generally called the relocation program.

If

an Indian lives on a reservation or near a reservation and
can’t get a job and he wants to go somewhere else to look for
a job, the Bureau will try to find him a job and will provide
him with general assistance for several years when he first
begins to work.
Q

You are suggesting that the Bureau doesn’t

give welfare to any Oklahoma or Alaska Indians except those
living on trust property?
MR, SACHSE:

No, I don’t want to go that far.

I

think —
Q
you are giving

I think you would, and you are just saying that
welfare to Indians who are still members of an

established tribal organisation.
MR. SACHSE:

I don’t think that that is the distinc­

tion either, because I am not at al3. sure that Mr. Ruiz is not
a member of the tribal organization.
Q

Of course he is.

I think he probably is, isn’t

he?
MR. SACHSE:

I think what the Bureau has done, and

I think with the knowledge and consent of Congress each year in

IT
making these appropriations is to treat Alaska and Oklahoma
in a separate category, and it may he that at various times
and in various other places they violated their own regula­
tions in giving welfare to people off reservations in particu­
lar instances.
Q

I don’t think so.
What did Mr. Bennett mean when he said "on or

near" — that seems to be his definition — "these are

or

or

near reservations, with a modern service bureau serving as
many as 400,000 Indians and Alaska natives who live on or
near reservations, people who find themselves isolated from
the mainstream of American life."
MR. SACHSE:

If you describe the activities of the

Bureau of Indian Affairs as a whole, it clearly is not
limited to on-reservation Indians.

On or near would be more

accurate, but it does things for Indians who are anywhere
near a reservation also.
Q

These particular Indians in this case are near,

aren’t they?
MR. SACHSE:

They are near a reservation.

What I am

saying is that in the health program, that quite openly is for
Indians who live on or near reservations.

In this work relo­

cation program, it is for the benefit of Indians who live on
or near reservations, but it is actually put into effect even
quite distant from a reservation, in some city where there
may be employment.

IS
So I am not arguing that the Bureau of Indian Affairs
is precluded or does not in fact give assistance to Indians
off reservations.

What 1 am saying is that in their general

■welfare program, this general assistance program, that year
after year they have asked Congress for money for this program
for activities on-reservation.

Maybe they should have

described it a little broader,.

And Congress has appropriated

with that in mind and it appropriates sums of money that only
fit that definition.
Q

Well, are you saying that the Department of

Interior meiy do this on a discretionary basis from time to
time but that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has no such
discretion?

Is that the essence of — the Ninth Circuit has

no authority to say that this; extends to all Indians off
reservations?
MR. SACHSE:

I think what is really happening is

that — I think you have to isolate the Alaska and Oklahoma
situation as special situations.

But then apart from that, I

think that the Bureau of Indian Affairs will try to make as
broad a definition of on-reservation as they can, and that
where there has been trust land involved i3i a few instances
— and I know this is so, people at the Bureau of Indian
Affairs told me so just last week, so I assume it is so -that they have in some instances given welfare to people who
live on trust lands near the reservations, in situations where

19
the reservation was too small for the allotments to have been
made on the reservation, and the government found land for
people off the reservation.

But they have not extended that

to people who do not live on trust, land and thus are not under
the direct supervision of the Bureau in that respect.
Q

Do you draw a line then that the Bureau has

generally between Indians on trust lands and Indians on allotted
lands?
MR. SACHSE:

Well, when I say trust land, I am not

drawing a distinction between that and allotted land.,

I mean

land in which the federal government is still the trustee,
whether it is because the Indian had an allotment and doesn't
yet own the land in fee, or for any other reason.
Now, X think it is clear that Congress has not ap­
propriated money for as broad a program as the petitioners
ask for.

I want to point out also that even — I mean

respondents ask for.
I want to point out also that even respondents say
that they don’t suggest that the program should be made avail­
able to Indians throughout the United States.

At page 23 of

their brief, they say, "We have never argued that the govern­
ment is required to provide subsistence benefits to the fully
assimilated Indian residing in Manhattan."

So if you don't

use the boundary, the line that Congress and the Bureau has
set up, some other line has to be picked.

And I don’t think

20
that the line on. or near reservations is going to get any more
satisfactory judicial answer to this question than the line
that has been drawn now of on reservation and these two
special instances of Alaska and Oklahoma,
Wow, I want to say a word about the Bureau of Indian
Affairs Manual on this.

I would feel easier with this case if

the Bureau of Indian Affairs had publishes its manual in the
Federal Register, because I think what they have done — I
don’t think they had a duty to have rulemaking, public notice
and open hearings, because this is for benefits and so forth,
and there have been cases that have held that it is not neces­
sary there.
But I think to have these be real legislative rules,
that they would have had to have been published in the Federal
Register.

What the BIA actually did is publish in the Federal

Register a notice that it has this manual and that it is
available to the public at the Washington office and at the
regional offices of the BIA, which is something like a sub­
stantial compliance, but I don’t say that it really is com­
pliance with that statute.
So we are left with the rule simply as interpreta­
tions of the acts of Congress.

Now, I think they are correct

interpretations in the sense that this is all that the Bureau
asked money for, and this is all that the appropriations gave
the money for.

So when the Bureau’s regulations say that this

21
is for welfare of Indians on reservations and in Alaska and
Oklahoma, I think it is just saying what the congressional acts
have to be read to say anyway.
But if the Court disagrees on that, I think that the
congressional acts are so vague and that the discretion left
to the Bureau is so large, both in the Snyder Act and in other
legislation and in the general language of the appropriation
act, which is just general appropriations, that the Bureau
does have rulemaking authority here, and that if it did go
through the process of publishing these rules they would be
faced with the problem then of whether that made the same
program valid.
Q

Is there any challenge to the rule about the

difference between reservation/non-reservation Indians in
this context on any ground other than the statutory ground,
that it is just inconsistent with the statute?
MR. SACHSE:
Q

I think that is the only challenge.

At least there was no other one presented

below, no other challenge?
MR. SACHSE:

They made constitutional challenge to

it.
Q

That was made below?

MR. SACHSE:

Yes, the constitutional challenge was

made.

Q

The right to travel.

22
Q

Nov?, that is here?

MR. SACHSE:

I think that is before the Court.

If

the Court agrees with us, that what the Secretary has done
here is in accord with the congressional legislation,, or with
it as legitimately interpreted —
0

Then they have to reach this?

MR. SACUSE:
Q

Then I think you have to reach the —

Well, what does the government say is the pur---

pose of the regulation, just to save money or —
MR. SACHSE:

No.

We sav that the purpose of the

regulation is to —- is so that in areas where there is Indian
government or the most direct federal supervision, that the
federal government dees supply the kind of welfare program
that could be supplied on a county basis within a. state, but
that where people move out of those areas and into the state
in general, decision has been made, at least as far as welfare
goes, they should be equated with the other people in the
state and

have whatever benefit is there.
Q

But not BIA money?

MR. SACHSE:
these particular areas.

Not BIA money off the reservations or
I think it is a decision — I don't

think it is just an economy measure but I think it is a de­
cision to use available funds in the core area of federal
responsibility.
Q

Does the government deny that it has an impact

23
on whether

on movement?
MR. SACHSE:

Yes, we do deny that it has an impact on

movement, of any legal significance.

If you once accept that

the reservation or that the situation in Alaska or Oklahoma
is a legitimate jurisdictional kind, of distinction to make,
then the fact that someone leaves the jurisdiction and he
gives up certain welfare benefits is not an interference with
his right of travel, any more than leaving one county and
going to another is if one county has a broader welfare pro­
gram than another, and on general assistance the welfare pro­
grams often break down county by county.
I think what it is, the government is seeing a
serious problem of unemployment on reservations where it has
the greatest responsibility, and the government reacting
properly to that problem in setting up a program, the govern­
ment simply not setting up a program that goes beyond the
heart area of its responsibility.
Now, I think it might have been a wise decision for
the Bureau of Indian Affairs to have a broader program.

I

don't argue for the merits of their decision to try to limit
this program.

There have been acts presented to Congress

that would have provided broader programs, and the Bureau has
not afforded them and Congress has not passed them.

I don’t

speak to the merits of that,
I do simply say that I think constitutionally this

is within the area of cases such as Dandridge, but there is no
invidious discrimination here.

The difference is based on an

essential jurisdictional difference, and whatever the wisdom
of the decision that Congress and the BIA have made, it is
legitimately their decision to make.
I would like to reserve my thirty seconds, if I may.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Woods?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WINTON D. WOODS, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WOODS:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

My name is Winton Woods, counsel for the respondents

in this case.
I would at the outset like to clear up what seemed
to me yesterday to be an apparent misunderstanding about our
basic position in this case.
First, I think we need to be very clear about what
it is that we are talking about when we talk about general
assistance sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

It is

in fact a supplemental program that is available only to
needy Indians

who do not qTsalify for one of the categorical

aid programs under the Social Security Act.
are generally run by the states.

Those programs

The GA program is run by

the BIA for the benefit of Indians who Congress has determined
by virtue of their very special status in American life, are

25
worthy of some special consideration.
With that in mind, I think, we are talking in this
case not about discrimination between Indians and non-Indians
but about discrimination between differing groups of Indians,
between those Indians who do receive BXA general assistance
and those who do not receive BIA general assistance.
Now, the government has sought to characterize the
holding of the court below in the very broadest possible
manner.

In fact, we think that the

quite narrow.

holding of the court was

And if I might quote, the Court of Appeals

held, "We hold that under the circumstances of this case, it
was improper for the Bureau to deny general assistance on the
basis of residency alone."

Now, there are two elements of

that holding that I think need to be noted if tha opinion of
the court below is to be properly understood.
First, the special circumstances that exist in this
case; and, secondly, the very narrow automatic basis of the
administrative decision to deny welfare.
The respondents here, plaintiffs below, are fullblooded Papago Indians who are members of their tribe, they
are unassimilated, they speak primarily tha Papago language,
they reside in a Papago community 15 miles from their reserva­
tion, they are in every respect, as the Stucki affidavit,
which is in the Appendix at pages 34 and 87, demonstrate,
Papago Indians.

26
Moreover, they reside within the historic boundaries
of their aboriginal land,, land that the Indians Claims Commis­
sion has recently found was illegally taken from them.

And,

finally, there is no question on the record after the fair
hearing in this case that they are needy Indians within the
intent of the congressional legislation that is at issue here.
Against that factual background, the Bureau of Indian
Affairs automatically determined that the respondents were not
entitled to general assistance solely on the basis of the
fact of their residency 15 miles from the reservation boundary.
The result of that interpretation, which in fact is not un­
usual, is severe discrimination.
First, as Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out yesterday,
a Papago miner who happened to live on the western edge of the
reservation and thus was able to commute to the mines at Ajo
would be entitled to general assistance if he needed it, while
persons in the situation of the Raises, who come from South
Komelic, in the far southern part of the reservation, near
the Mexican border, and thus are unable to commute, are forced
to move in the Indian village of Ajo in order to work if they
are to find work.
As we pointed out in our brief, there is very little
work available on the Papago reservation.

What can be found

generally is found in the bordering communities.

Secondly —

and the Court has discussed this at some length with Mr. Sachse

27
— there are some non-reservation Indians who receive general
assistance benefits regardless of the fact that they do not
reside bn a reservation, and we think that they are indis­
tinguishable from the respondents in this case.
The government has suggested that there is some
difference based upon the jurisdiction over the reservation,
and yet the government has admitted in their brief and in the
petition for certiorari that jurisdiction exists in this case,
that the Bureau in fact has jurisdiction to extend benefits
to these people.
I think that we cannot, ass Tima on the basis of the
legislative history that exists in this case that Congress in­
tended that these strange and unusual results would come
about when they approved this program.

We believe that the

results violate the congressional intent and that they also
violate the Fifth Amendment.
Our basic case then is this:

We believe that when

Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior, through the
Snyder Act, to expend such monies as they would appropriate
in the future for the care and benefit of the Indians through­
out the United States, and when they later in 1968, which is
the act in issue in this case, appropriated, money

pursuant to

that mandate, that the plain language of those statutes does
not allow the automatic or conclusive presumption, if you
will, of non-eligibility that is based solely upon the place

of residence.
Now, that is not to say that we believe that the
statute mandates the payment of general assistance benefits to
Indians throughout the United States, no matter where they may
be found, no matter what their percentage of blood may be, no
matter what their degree of assimilation may be.
We believe that the Secretary can and should pursuant
to the congressional mandate create a carefully drawn regula­
tion that draws the very line Mr. Sachse was talking about,
and that line can be drawn by focusing upon the word "Indian"
both in the Snyder Act and in the appropriations act.

A state

that defines or a regulation that defines who is an Indian for
purposes of those statutes might very well mean every conceiv­
able objection that the government has to our case.
For example, the Bureau of Indian Affairs might con­
clude that an Indian ~~ well, in defining an Indian, that they
would look to things such as the degree of assimilation into
the dominant culture, that they would look to such things as
degree of blood.
Q

That series of factors that you just mentioned,

Mr. Woods, sounds strikingly like the range of criteria that
are used in exercising discretion administratively.
MR. WOODS:

Your Honor, I agree, and they are also

the range of factors that have been adopted by the Public
Health Service to determine their jurisdiction.

If I might

29
speak to the point more directly
Q

Wouldn't that bring you at least close to the

Dandridge holding of the Court?
MR. WOODS:

Your Honor, I think that this case is

quite distinguishable from the Dandridge case.

The govern­

ment consistently has suggested that this is a Dandridge
problem.

I read Dandridge at least to say that this Court

will not second-guess legislative judgments of relative need
between competing classes of welfare recipients.
lieve that that is this case.

I don’t be­

If we are to analogize this

case to Dandridge v. Williams, or Jefferson v. Hackney, I
think we could hypothesize a situation in which the State of
Maryland, which has jurisdiction over the entire state, chose
to extend AFDC benefits only to mothers who live in Baltimore
County.

As you well remember, from the facts of that case,

there was a discrimination in Dandridge between Baltimore
County and the rest of the state to the extent that families
in Baltimore County receive slightly more money.
I suspect that this Court, apart from the Social
Security Act issue, on constitutional grounds would have seen
that case quite differently had Maryland said we are only
going to expend money for mothers in Baltimore County without
any factual showing, without any determination that that was
a rational choice.
Q

You don't get to this issue, I take it, unless

30
we disagree with the Ninth Circuit as to their interpretation
of the congressional act?
MR. WOODS:
Rehnquist.

That is perfectly correct, Mr. Justice

We believe that the case can be decided on narrow

statutory grounds on the basis of the obviously unclear legis­
lative history, the somewhat unclear language of the two
statutes and by application of the standa.rd of construction
that this Court has applied since the time of Mr. Chief
Justice Marshall and has most recently applied last year in
the McC.lanahan case.
Q

If the legislative history is unclear and the

statute is unclear, doesn’t that give you a fairly strong
case for following the administrative construction?
MR. WOODS:

Your Honor, it does and it doesn't.

As

a general proposition, it is quite clear that it does, and if
this were an ordinary case I would not be standing here making
the argument that I am.

The fact, is that the government over

the course of years has told the Congress that it is expending
money for the benefit of the Indians who live on or near
reservations.

Now, there have been times when various

Senators, particularly Senator Bible, in a colloquy that is
quoted at length in the Court of Appeals opinion, attempted
to find out just exactly what the Bureau meant when it said
"on or near."

The Bureau has never adequately described to

Congress what the "on or near" language meant.

31
Moreover, they suggest that the existence of this
regulation should under the standard rule be taken to be —
well, be taken to be an expression of congressional intent
since Congress has not overridden it in any way through the
statute.
I v/ould agree again with that as a general proposi­
tion, but the fact of this case is that pursuant to the
policies established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Manual
itself, that regulation is not for public consumption.
a regulation designed for internal administration.

It is

Those

regulations that are designed to inform the public and pre­
sumably the Congress are not contained in the Bureau of Indian
Affairs Manual alone, but they are put in CFR, through the
Federal Register.
This regulation is hidden away in a manual that is
used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in handling its internal,
programs, and we simply don’t believe that the standard and
I believe appropriate rule in regard to long-standing admin­
istrative regulations is applicable in this case.
Secondly, the government points to the fact that the
appropriations request itself has always contained the limi­
tation.

We would suggest that the fact that Congress chose

not to include the requested limitation in its appropriation
is equally an argument for our side.

We might well assume,

particularly following the Squire v. Capoeman standard of

32
liberal construction for statutes regarding Indian affairs,
we might very well assume that the failure of Congress to
enact a regulation requested by the Bureau is in fact a
recognition of Congress' intent to not limit the program to
the degree that the Bureau sought to do so.
Q

Doesn't the long history of the actual applica­

tion. of that provision have some significance?
MR. WOODS;

Indeed it does, Your Honor, and again I

believe that the actual application of that provision — I
assume that you are talking about the Bureau of Indian Affairs
Manual of regulations — the Court of Appeals found, and we
think there is substantial, support for that finding, that over
the course of years the Bureau has administered their program
in a very sloppy way, that they have in fact extended benefits
to Indians who don't reside on reservations, even outside of
Alaska and Oklahoma.

It has never been quite clear, even in

the legislative history which is cited in our brief, just how
far the Bureau has gone to extend benefits to near reservation
Indians.

The Court of Appeals found, however, and we think

found correctly, that they have done so, so that the in fact
practice over the course of years differs greatly from the
specific language of the regulations and we believe that it is
appropriate for this Court not to look only or to look not
only at the specific language of the regulation but to look
as well to the practice of the Bureau under that regulation.

33
Q
Appeals

have

Incidentally, do you believe the Court of
adopted the "on or near" limitation?

MR. WOODS:

Your Honor, I believe that the Court of

Appeals adopted precisely the suggestion that I am offering to
this Court, it is the suggestion that I offered to them, and
that is that it is not the position of the Court of Appeals
or of the District Court or of this Court to draft a regula­
tion for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

We have asked for a

writ of mandamus directing them to draft a regulation in
light of their experience and knowledge.
supposedly with the expertise in the area.

They are the agency
We suggest that

they be directed to draft a regulation that incorporates
functional standards describing who is an Indian to avoid the
discriminations which we see in the program as it is presently
run.
Q

What I had reference to, Mr. Woods, this is

rather broad language in the opinion on page 21 of the
petition for certiorari, "In light of the foregoing, we con­
clude that Congress intended general assistance benefits to
be available to all Indians, including those in the position
of appellants, at the time the Snyder Act was passed."

That

seems rather broader than an "at or near" limitation, doesn't
it?
MR. WOODS:
and the question —

It is, Your HOnor, it is clearly broader,

3^
Q

You are not defending that?

MR. WOODS:

Well, let me say this:

I would defend

that with the understanding that the word "Indian" is subject
to limiting construction.

I would not assert that the Bureau

must pay general assistance benefits to a Manhattan stockbroker
who happens to be one-sixtyfourth Papago.
Q

Well, suppose he was full-blooded?

Q

What would you do with the Sequoia Indian that

gets one of the highest labor prices in the world building
those skyscrapers in Hew York?
MR. WOODS:
0

Your Honor -—

I understood from the brier that you were cut­

ting back, you said it didn’t apply to places like that, I
thought.
MR. WOODS:

I could make a few suggestions, but I

would not ptirport to stand in front of this Court and draft a
regulation without any real expertise in the area of Indian
affairs.
Q

But you wouldn't —

MR. WOODS:

I would suggest, in regard to that

specific question, that the Bureau
Q

You couldn’t say all Indians under any circum-

.stances?
MR. WOODS:
Your Honor.

Depending on how you define "Indian,"

You might define

Q

Well, what about Chief Judge Barefoot, head of

the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma, who is a full
Choctaw Indian?
MR. WOODS:

I think he is clearly a fully assimilated

Indian, and that is precisely the kind of Indian that we think
Congress did not intend to —
Q

So you don't mean all Indians, right?

MR. WOODS:

This is a very difficult point and it

bothers —
Q

Are you talking about assimilated Indians,

reservation Indians — they are all Indians, aren't they?
MR. WOODS:

They are all Indians and all I am sug­

gesting is that for the purposes of the Snyder* Act and the
appropriations act, that the Bureau may adopt a narrower
definition of Indian.

It may say that Indian for this purpose

means an unassimilated Indian of a certain degree of blood who
—- and indeed residence may be a relevant consideration.

We

don't deny that residence is one factor that the Bureau may
consider, in using Mr. Justice Marshall's hypothetical.

The

Indian who resides in New York might, because of that fact
and some other facts —
Q

Not. be an Indian.

MR. WOODS:

— not be an Indian for the purposes of

the program, not for all purposes but simply for the purposes
of the program that Congress has created through the Snyder

36
Act and the appropriations act.
Mr» Woods, you said you brought an action for

Q

a mandamus.

This isn't a mandamus action, is it?

MR. WOODS:

This was originally an action for a writ

of mandamus in the District Court.

It was -—

the complaint

was on cross motions for summary judgment, a judgment was
entered for the defendants, the case was appealed to the Court
of Appeals, the Court of Appeals found in favor of respondents
and the government appealed to this Court.
Q

So this was in this form a mandamus action when

you brought it before Judge Walsh?
MR. WOODS:

It was an action in the nature of mandamus

pursuant to 1361, as well as an action for a declaratory judg­
ment

•
We believe that if the Court disagrees with our po­

sition regarding the legislative history, that there are then
three constitutional issues that it must confront.
those we have dealt with to some extent already.

Two of
First is

the discrimination between some non-reservation Indians and
other non-reservation Indians.

The government has gone to

great lengths to attempt to find a rational basis for that
discrimination.

We simply say that we do not believe that

there is a rational basis that, is evident in the record.
Perhaps more importantly, however, there is a dis­
crimination between reservation Indians and non-reservation

37
Indians.

I would refer the Court to the affidavit of Mr.

Elee Sara, which is in the Appendix at pages 83 and 90, and was
part — an exhibit in support of our motion for summary judg­
ment.

Mr. Sam is a Vice Chairman of the Papago Tribe and he

describes the situation that occurred when the government came
in and built a dam in the northern part of the reservation
called Painted Rock Dam.

A village that was on the dam loca­

tion, the dam site, had to foe removed.

The government built

a new village in the town of Gila Bend, which is directly
adjacent to the reservation.

They purchased the land and

treated it as if it were on the reservation.

However, some 19

families who had lived on the land where the old village was
were not included in the new community that was built by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs.

They had to go some place, and by

the nature of the Papago community they did not feel free to
move to far parts of the reservation, they wanted to maintain
their kinship ties with their village, and so they moved in
to Gila Bend.
The situation now, as described by Vice Chairman Sam,
is that those 19 families are denied general, assistance benefits
l,

even though they reside perhaps a few feet from the reservation
boundary and they reside there by virtue of action of the
government, while other Indians who have been moved into the
new community built by the BIA

are given general assistance

and new houses and all of the other things that the government

38
can do for the Indians.
We suggest that discriminations of that kind, discrim
inations such as the one suggested by Mr. Justice Blackman
yesterday between the miner who lives on the western edge of
the reservation and commutes to Ajo, some twelve miles, and the
Indian who lives in Indian village, that those discrimination
between certain kinds of reservation Indians and certain kinds
of non-reservation Indians are simply in defensible.

We can

find no rational basis to support that classification.
G

This argument, I gather, Mr. Woods, is directed

to the particular facts of this case in terms of the location
of these two Indian groups, not to some general proposition
that somewhere in other states off-reservation Indians are
given general assistance benefit.
MR. WOODS:

Your Honor, it is directed to both points

I am talking now about the precise, facts of this case because I
understand them more clearly.

The other situations that we

have cited in our brief come from statements of Bureau of
Indian Affairs officials to various appropriations committees
and Congress over the years, and they describe this rather

fuzzy way in which they go about administering their programs.
I can't —
Q

I am addressing, of course, your constitutional

argument.
MR. WOODS:

Right.

And we suggest that the

3.9
discrimination created on the reservation in Arizona, as well
as those situations described in the brief, in Alaska and
Oklahoma, Rapid City, Turtle Mountain, apparently in Reno, we
know that there may very well be other situations which we
are unaware — the point is that there are some reservation
Indians or non-reservation Indians who are indistinguishable
from their brothers who reside a few miles away on the reser­
vation, who are denied general assistance benefits while the
class of people from whom they cannot be distinguished are.
granted general assistance benefits.
Q

Well, they are distinguishable on the basis of

their residence, and that is what this case is about.
MR. WOODS:

That is precisely what it is about, Your

Honor —•
0

And that is a distinction.

MR. WOODS:

That is a distinction, but we would sug­

gest that that distinction bears no rational relationship to
the purpose of the legislation which is to help needy Indians.
Q

It is a

different argument, but you cannot

fairly say that they are absolutely indistinguishable because
the distinction is their place of residence, and that is what
the — that is a distinction raa.de in this case.
MR. WOODS:

That is absolutely right, Your Honor.

Finally, if the Court concludes that the traditional
equal protection argument and the legislative history nonetheless

4o
require it, to uphold the Bureau of Indian Affairs regulation
in issue in this case, we believe that the appropriate standard
for judging the constitutionality of the action of the Bureau
and of the Secretary of the Interior is the strict scrutiny
test adopted by this Court in Shapiro v. Thompson.
Q

But you also I think just suggested that even

under the rationality test —
MR. WOODSj

That is right, Your Honor.

grounds upon which we think this is improper.

We have three

We think it

violates the intent of Congress, we think it violates the tra­
ditional equal protection, and we think it infringes upon the
right of an Indian to travel throughout his historical aborigina
land.
The facts of this case, I would remind the Court, are
that the land upon which the respondents live is land that was
illegally taken from the Papago Tribe, as found by the Indian
Claims Commission.

They reside within their historic aboriginal

land, and they have exercised their right — and I have to admit
that it is not a right that this Court has established, but I
think that any fair reading of the right to travel cases must
conclude that an Indian has a right to travel particularly
throughout his historic land.
As we pointed out in our brief, in our added state­
ment to the statement made by the government, there is very
little work available on the reservation, and thus travel around

reservation and off reservation communities becomes a matter o
necessity if one is to work.

If Mr. Ruiz wanted to work in

the mines, he had to move to Ajo and to live in Indian village
since commuting from his village in the southern part of the
}

reservation was impossible.

He could have moved back, he

could have moved back to the reservation, as evidently many
miners did, as Professor Stuck! discovered during his study,
but he wanted to keep his daughter in school in Ajo so that
she would have a better chance than he had, and he did so,
thus he was penalized by the Bureau for having exercised a
fundamental right by having gone to Ajo a few miles from his
reservation to find work.
Moreover, the regulation acts as an .inducement for
him to come back to the reservation, and there evidently are
a number of cases described not only in the various committee
hearings but .in the affidavits in this case in which Indians
have returned to the reservation.
Q

Wouldn’t that have been true in the Dandridge

case if a recipient living in Baltimore had moved over to the
Eastern Shore or some place?
MR. WOODS:

I am not sure I understand your question

Your Honor.
Q

Well, you are saying that by moving, you are

talking about the right to travel, but that right was also
involved in Dandridge, was it not?

^2
MR, WOODS:
Q

You mean if they had moved out of Maryland,

Yes,

MR. WOODS:

If they had moved to some other state.

I quite agree, and I think again this is a different case.

We

are not suggesting, and the government is not suggesting that
the Bureau of Indian Affairs' jurisdiction is limited to a
single state.

They have traveled throughout the area under

the jurisdiction of the governmental agency that creates the
welfare program, i.e„, the United States government, and we
think that that is the distinguishable case from the person who
moves, say, from Maryland to Virginia and then seeks benefits
from the State or Maryland because they are higher than
Virginia.

We wouldn't argue? for that proposition.

We argue

only for the proposition that a parson who travels within the
appropriate governmental jurisdiction has got. a right to not
be discriminated against because they have exercised that
right of movement.

Hew, I understand that perhaps later today,

and at least by tomorrow, another Arizona case, dealing with
the right, to some extent to the right of intrastate travel,
will be before this Court, and I think to some extent that is
relevant to the right to travel argument that we are raising
here.
Q

The BIA jurisdiction, I take it, extends through­

out the fifty states, so that what you are contending for is a
right to travel because of the Indians" relationship to the BIA

anywhere in the fifty states different from that, of an ordinary
citizen.
MR. WOODS:

No, we don't suggest that it is any dif­

ferent from the right of an ordinary citizen.
Q

Well, then, why does it depend on. BIA jurisdic­

tion?
MR. WOODS:

Simply because the question raised by Mr.

Chief Justice Burger creates a situation in which a welfare
recipient moves from one jurisdiction, one relevant governmental
jurisdiction into another, from jurisdiction A, which was pre­
viously paying welfare assistance to her, to jurisdiction B.
Q

I understood his question to you to foe about

someone who moved from Baltimore County to the Eastern Shore
of Maryland, both within Maryland, and I think in Dandridge we
sustained a differential between Baltimore County and other
parts of Maryland.
MR. WOODS:

That's right, Your Honor, you did sustain

T think without a great deal of discussion the differential
between Baltimore County and the rest of the state.
Q

That wasn't an issue in Dandridge.

MR. WOODS:

I take it it was not .in issue.

this is not the Dandridge case.
here.

Moreover,

There isn’t a differential

This is not a case where the Bureau of Indian Affairs

has weighed competing needs among classes of people.

It is a

case idlere the Bureau automatically, without any factual basis,

44
has concluded that off-reservation Indians were not within the
recipient population created by Congress , i.e., needy ursassimilated Indians, and we think that that is very different, from
the previous decisions of this Court, quite properly I believe,
upholding the right of a state legislature to make judgments
about competing needs among competing classes of recipients.
We think it is a quite different matter to say that these
people are not to be included at all, they are not. even to be
given a shot at dividing up that limited pie.
My time is up. Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Woods.

Mr. Sachse, do you have any tiling further?
MR. SACHSE:

No, Your Honor.
