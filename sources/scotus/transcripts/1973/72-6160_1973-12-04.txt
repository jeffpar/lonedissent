P R O C E E D IN G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

We will hear argument next

in Mo. 72-616Q, Mitchell against Grant.
Mr. Hobbs, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. HOBBS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOBBS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, this matter is before the Court on a writ of
certiorari to review the decision of the Louisiana Supreme
Court upholding the Louisiana statutory procedure of
sequestration.

The issue presented by the decision of the

Louisiana Supreme Court and by the arguments of respondent is
whether the decision of this Court in Fuentes v. Shevin should
be applied to the Louisiana procedure of sequestration, a
procedure without any constitutionally significant differences
from the procedures of Florida and of Pennsylvania of statutory
replevin found unconstitutional in Fuentes v. Shevin.
Mitchell is not asking this Court for a novel holding.
The key facts in this case are brief.

On February 2, 1972,

Grant filed a money claim in the First City Court in New
Orleans.

That claim alleged $574 against the purchase price

of four appliances.

In conjunction with that money claim

Grant requested that a seizure by writ of sequestration be
authorized.

In support of that request for seizure by

sequestration, Grant filed a short affidavit which verified

4
the petition and a surety bond.
The judge authorized the seizure.
take place immediately.

The seizure could

As was true in Fuentes, the writ

of sequestration issued upon the minimal showing of the
verified petition and affidavit.

As was true in Fuentes, it

issued only with tlxe filing of a surety bond.

As was true in

Fuentes, the issuance of the writ of sequestration was a
ministerial act.

It is the mandatory duty of the issuing

official to issue the writ of sequestration if the documents
presented to him are proper on their face.

The document need

only show on its face a claim, in this case the $574 money
claim alleged to be due on four appliances purchased eleven
to nineteen months prior to the initiation of the suit.

The

document need only show an interest of the claimant in the
property to be seized? in this case an unrecorded statutory
lien was asserted.

And, third, the document need only show

the defendant's power over the property to be seized? in fcn.is
case delivery of the goods to Mitchell was alleged.
The procedure is broadly available to every
plaintiff who is willing to make these averments.

Once the

writ of sequestration is authorized, the seizure may take
place immediately.

As in Fuentes, there are only post

seizure procedures available to the dispossessed parties.
As in Fuentes, those procedures come too late; the deprivation
has already occurred.

However, to put this case in proper perspective,
I will briefly go through the post seizure procedures which
Mitchell pursued.
The dispossessed party may defend both against the
money claim and against the seizure; in this case Mitchell
sought to dissolve the seizure first.

Mitchell alleged

State grounds, a State exemption statute
to certain of the appliances.

he argued applied

Mitchell also asserted that

the due process clauses of the Louisiana and the United
States Constitutions protected him against this seizure,
A hearing was held.

Both parties appeared.

QUESTION:

Did he make any assertion there was not

lie could do this .in his defense

to the underlying petition for stating a money claim, and that
is

his intent, what he intends to do.

You mean at the trial later.
By pleadings and then at the trial —You claim at this motion to dissolve the

that he could challenge the writ, challenge the

underlying facts on which the 'writ was based, namely, that
there is a debt due and a balance due, would that make any
difference to your argument?
MR. HOBBS:

Well, respondent does make the argument —-

he makes the argument that Mitchell could have raised defenses
in that post seizure hearing,that he had to raise every
defense, and because he did not raise defenses against the under­
lying claim, he only raised defenses against the seizure,
that he has waived all his defenses.
if you reach that conclusion.

It makes a difference

However, as to my constitutional

argument, it makes no difference -™
QUESTION;

It still comes out.right.

MR. HOBBS: — because it comes too late; it comes
after the deprivation.
After the City Court refused to dissolve the seizure,
Mitchell sought immediate interlocutory relief at the appellate
level.

The intermediate appellate court refused to review.

The Louisiana Supreme Court granted review on interlocutory
itfrits of review, certiorari, mandamus, et cetera.

And after

hearing briefs and oral arguments of the parties, Louisiana

7
Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Louisiana
procedure of sequestration»
To uphold the decision below would be in effect
to overrule Puentes v. Shevin.

However, the decision in

Puentes is not the only principle involved.

To uphold the

decision below would be to depart from the sound constitutional
principles applied in a host of other decisions of this Court
stretching over a period of more than one hundred years.

That

principle is the very fundamental principle that the State
cannot seize a person's property without prior notice and
hearing except in the most extraordinary of situations.
To uphold the decision below would be to cause a
new arid almost unlimited exception to that principle.

To

uphold the decision beloxv would also cast out an uncertainty
upon the decisions of more than 60 courts in

more than 29

States which have struck down statutes similar to those
involved in Puentes and reliance upon this Court's decision in
Puentes v. Shevin and Sniadach v« Family Finance.
The basic purpose of the 14th Amendment is to
protect the individual against the State.

The keystone to

this constitutional protection is the right to defend one's
property prior to a State seizure.

This can be accomplished

effectively only by affording the individual notice and an
opportunity for a hearing prior to the State seizure.

This

right to prior notice and hearing can be abridged only by the

8

most overriding of State interests.
The broadly available procedure of statutory
sequestration abridges the constitutional rights of the
individual without any overriding State justification for
that abridgement.
QUESTIONS

I missed something you said.

The courts

of how many States declared similar laws unconstitutional?
MR. HOBBS:

There have been more than 60 decisions

iri more than 29 States.
QUESTION:

More than 29.

And have the State legis-

latures done anything either in those States where the
existing law was declared unconstitutional or in other States
where the courts have not done so, but —
MR. HOBBS:
QUESTION:

There has been —
Have there been modifications of —-

MR. HOBBS:

I am aware of legislatures considering

new legislation to give consumers prior notice in hearing. I
believe that a few States have had sufficient time to enact
such legislation.

If it would aid the Court, I could prepare

a supplemental memorandum on that point.
QUESTION':

Do you have in your brief the judicial

decisions to which you refer, more than the citations?
MR. HOBBS:

No.

When I was writing it I thought
i

it would be to state the obvious in including those 60.
QUESTION:

You say there are more than 60 in at least

9
29 States.
MR. HOBBS2
QUESTIONS

Yes, your Honor*
Do I understand they were all since

Puentes?
MR. HOBBS:

No.

Sniadach and since Puentes.

Those decisions are all since
Sniadach was decided in 1969.

The cases that were based on Sniadach and p re •-Puentes, I
suppose, would have been projecting this Court's decision in
Puentes v. Shevin.
The bases on which the Louisiana Supreme Court
distinguished Puentes

are not entirely clear.

However, none

of those justifications evidenced the type of State interest
necessary to overcome the constitutional protection of prior
notice and hearing.

The Louisiana Supreme Court’s opinion

made it abundantly clear that seizure by sequestration is
available to every Louisiana credit seller who believes that
there has been a default in a credit transaction.

The

Louisiana Supreme Court refused to confine the application of
the sequestration statute to nasrrow extraordinary situations.
The need for prompt action identified by the Louisiana court
is the ordinary desire which any anxious creditor might feel
while enforcing his claim.

The procedure of sequestration

is not confined to situations where a creditor can show the
collateral is actually endangered» The creditor need only
show that the owner has power over that property.

10

QUESTION;

You think if it could be shown that

collateral were actually endangered that that would be a
legitimate exception to Fuentes?
MR, HOBBS:

We then would have the problem of safe­

guards to insure whether that determination to -— safeguard
that the determination is accurate once it is made.

The usual

safeguard is the adversary process, and that's why we say
prior hearing,
QUESTION;

But, of course, given notice and hearing

is also an opportunity for the person who is the object of the
writ to spirit the thing away,
MR. HOBBS:

Well, if we presume that consumers do

spirit things away or sitting in their house with a hatchet
ready to destroy the goods, that would raise that presumption
to a constitutional presumption of malice of consumers,
QUESTION:

It's not a question of malice of consumers.

But I think almost everyone who has had any experience in this
type of practice knows that stuff frequently disappears if
people have notice of the fact that it’s the subject of
sequestration.
QUESTION:
MR, HOBBS:
to indulge in.

They sometimes just sell it,
That is a presumption which I am unwilling

However, I think if there were adequate safe­

guards to determine the probability of consumer destruction,
that then perhaps we would have a statute which would be

narrowly drawn and come within the exceptions of Puentes.
QUESTION:
mind?

What range of safeguards do you have in

I am not sure I
MR. HOBBS;

The traditional safeguard is the

adversarial hearing in which both sides can assert their
interest.

Perhaps we could — there are other traditional

safeguards -QUESTION:

Hov/ does that help if the property has

already been sold?
MR. HOBBS;

It doesn’t.

I’m talking about a hearing

prior.
QUESTION;
MR. HOBBS;

Oh, I see.
Those are the safeguards to protect, to

make sure that the State is not engaging in an erroneous
decision when it decides there is a need to seize this
property, to take it from one individual and —
QUESTION;

You didn’t mean a safeguard for the

creditor; you mean a safeguard for the debtor, purchaser,.
MR, HOBBS;

A safeguard for the State to insure

that the State is not engaging in mistaken deprivation, and
a safeguard for the debtor to insure that he is not deprived
of his property through the State

or inadvertence or

otherwise.
QUESTION;

There doesn’t seem to be any question

under Louisiana law that the seller in this case had a property

interest .in the goods?
MR. HOBBS:

No, thei'e is no contest.

QUESTION:

So yon 'would make the same argument if

there were a chattel mortgage on it or something the size of
just a vendor’s lien.
MR. HOBBS:
QUESTION:
in the goods.

That's correct.
So both parties have a property interest

And the question is who has possession pending

litigation.
MR. HOBBS:
QUESTION:

Correct.
Let's assume there was a hearing, whateve

kind of a hearing you think would be satisfactory.

What

would you think would have to be established at that hearing
in order to change possession?

Or is it your position that

possession may not be changed until the entire litigation is
over?

Would you say that at. the hearing all you would have

to establish is probable cause to believe that there was a
balance due on the debt?
MR. HOBBS:
QUESTION:

There is a —
Or would you have to try out rhe entire

case and make final and conclusive findings?
MR. HOBBS:

The Court in Puentes suggested

at

that hearing that the underlying merits of the claim would be
what the claimant must prove in order to obtain the seizure.
QUESTION:

Not just probable cause to believe.

13

MR, HOBBS;

When you get into probable cause, what

you are getting into is the burden or the specific facts on
which the creditor must show,
QUESTION ;

-That' s right.

MR, HOBBS;

If we have the adversarial context,

I

suppose we could go in the traditional manner where he states
his claim and tries to pi'ove his claim and the defendant ~~
QUESTION;

I know, but in effect you are. saying

that you must have a full adversarial hearing on all the issues
in the case and decide them on the merits before possession
may be changed,
MR, HOBBS;

I don’t think the Court has to reach

that question to •—
QUESTION;

I think it’s very much a part of the

inquiry as to what kind of a hearing are you talking about
as requiring before a change of possession.
MR. HOBBS;

I think that perhaps one of the issues

that could be involved is the necessity of the seizure, and
if it is not shown necessary at that hearing, that is, if
there is no danger to the goods to be seized, that then there
would be no reason —
QUESTION;

How do you show that?

If he has put the

burden on the creditor for that to show that, how does he
show that?
MR, HOBBS;

Well, if you indulge --

14
QUESTION;

In effect, you are just saying let's

wait until the trial is all over.
MR. HOBBS;

That is the ordinary way that we test

claims under our system.

I think it is a good system.

I

would be reluctant to see this Court abandon that system.
But I do believe State legislatures could come up with
possibly new techniques.

I think I would have to examine

those new safeguards to protect the State and the defendant
once they were drawn before I could defend them,

I mean,

possibly we could have a traditional investigation —
QUESTION:

You also think that private repossessions

would be illegal without any aid from the State?
MR. HOBBS;

Well, let me make this clear, that

self help repossession, as it is known under the UCC is not
a part of the law of Louisiana.

It presents different

questions than are presented by this statute,

I do not

think the Court should reach that question in this case.
The Court does not have to.

It presents difficult questions

of State action, and a number of the courts have been splittin
on this issue.
QUESTION;

No self-help remedies under Louisiana

law are permissible?
MR. HOBBS;

Not in the context of a credit sale.

Under the law of Louisiana there are no conditional sales.
Title vests in the buyer immediately upon the agreement of the

3.5

price and the goods and therefore -—
QUESTION;
MR. HOBBSs

Subject to the vendor's lien.
Subject to the vender's lien.

And

therefore, under that rationale, they do not allow self-help
repossession.
QUESTION;

Does Louisiana recognize the conditional

sales type contract for personal property?
MR. HOBBS;

No, it doesn't.

faith and credit to one

It will give full

made out of the State, but it will

not enforce one made within the State.
If the Louisiana Supreme Court's finding is read
to mean that the creditor's interest in the property is
superior to the debtor's right to have his property secure
from arbitrary and unreasonable seizure, it is erroneous.
There are no safeguards prior to the seizure except those
minimal showings that vrere present in Fuentes.

The Louisiana

Supreme Court rules that none of those safeguards were
necessary because it gave an unbridled preference to the
interest of one litigant that was a security interest
without even considering the full legal title of Mitchell or
his right to be secure from arbitrary or unreasonable State
seizures.

Such a use of State power without proper safeguards

is unconstitutional.
Mitchell requests that this Court reverse the
decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court and reverse the

16

unconstitutional seizure of his property.

To do so would he

entirely consistent with this Court's prior decisions.

To do

so would be to vindicate the decisions of more than 60
lower courts in

more than 29 States which have relied upon

this Court's decisions in Puentes v, Shevin, Sniadach v. Family
Finance

and a host of other decisions of this Court.
Unless there are any further questions,, I Would

like to reserve the remainder of ray time for rebuttal,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr, Hobbs,

Mr, O’Sullivan,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. O'SULLIVAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, O'SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this is a case in which though the petitioner
claims the denial of an opportunity for a hearing regarding
the taking of his property, there has in fact already been
a hearing in that regard.

The petitioner has been heard and

his contentions have been decided adversely to him.
One point I might make right off the bat, your
Honor, is that this case arose prior to the time that the
decision had been rendered in the Puentes case, and the trial
court's determination was made at a time prior to the decision
in the Puentes case.
In terms of the argument in the brief, I submit there
are

two basic areas of dispute between the parties with

17
respect to Louisiana law.

The first of those areas is as to

the nature and extent of the hearing which has been had in
this case.

And the second area of dispute is with respect to

the role of the court which issues the writ of sequestration.
Now, in the argument that preceded, there has been
no discussion of that role, and I think that there should be
a fuller development.
But first I would like to turn to the question of
the hearing that has been had in this case.

We submit that

the petitioner comes before this Court and is not in a
position to assert an injury.

The Fuentes case was designed

to prevent mistaken, unjustified, or 'wrongful deprivation of
property.

And that has not happened in this case.

The

petitioner has had a hearing, albeit after the property was
taken from his possession, and he has been heard in that
regard.
Now, as to the nature of that hearing, it was a
hearing that was brought on by the

petitioner to set aside the

writ of sequestration and an endeavor to obtain the return
of the property.
Now, the petitioner in essence claims that he was
not able to go into the merits of the case at that time, but
in fact the petitioner was able to cause the court, the
Louisiana court, to explore into the grounds for the issuance
of v/hat’ s referred to as the auxiliary remedy.

There is a

18

comment that the petitioner has referred to in his brief to
the effect that at that hearing the merits may not be
inquired into.

In fact, we submit that any significant

defense can be raised at that hearing, and the cases that we
have cited in our brief at pages 22 to 25 amply demonstrate
that in cases in which a motion has been brought on to
dissolve a writ of sequestration, the court has inquired into
issues that go to the merits, and that is because the burden
of proof at such a hearing has been placed on the party that
caused the goods to be seized in the first instance.

In

short., the burden was on the respondent at that hearing to
demonstrate that the property was properly seized.
Mow, in addition, at that hearing, after the property
had been taken, there was a stipulation entered into by the
parties to the effect that there was a valid vendor’s lien
on the property.
Mow, in short, this is a situation in which the
petitioner purchased property and then, having gone into
default, after the property was seized came into court and
admitted that there was a valid vendor's lien on that property.
QUESTION:

To have a lien there has to be a balance

due, I take it?
MR. O'SULLIVAN;

Yes, sir, I believe that's so.

In the even*, that there was not a balance due, there would be
no vendor's lien.

19

QUESTION:

You may have a vendor’s lien but not have

the right to possess because the balance may not be due, may
not be unpaid„

Just conceding that there is a valid vendor's

lien doesn't concede that it's unpaid,
MR, O'SULLIVAN:

No, your Honor, I think that's so,

but beyond that —
QUESTION:

What about that in this case?

Was there

ever any concession that it was, that the balance was unpaid?
MR, 0'SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, the allegations in the

petition in the initial affidavit pursuant to which this
action was commenced were to the effect that the balance was
unpaid and was due, and that has never been contested nor
contradicted, and it could have been contested and contradicted.
QUESTION:

It's never been admitted either, has it?

MR. O'SULLIVAN:

No, sir, but I submit there has

been a finding to that effect implicit in the decision of the
court at the hearing to set aside the writ of sequestration.
QUESTION:

There is always a vendor's lien under

Louisiana law when personal property, when a chattel is
sold and the full purchase price is not then and there paid,
there is always a so-called vendor's privilege,
MR, O'SULLIVAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir, that is true.

And that's all the admission amounted to,

wasn't it?
MR. O' SULLIVAN:

No, I think that it goes to

20

something more than that, because it’s the admission that it
has not been extinguished, that it's still — that it has not
been extinguished, that it's still in existence as of the time
that the case has come on for hearing before the court,
QUESTION:

That would simply be an admission of no

more than that the full purchase price has still not yet been
paid, isn’t that right?
MR. O’SULLIVAN:

I think that it goes beyond that.

I think implicitly that there aren’t defenses of such a nature
as would extinguish that vendor’s lien,
QUESTION:

And the only thing that would extinguish

it, as I understand it at least under Louisiana law, of which
I am generally very ignorant, is that until the full purchase
price iias been paid, plus whatever interest and service
charges there may be, the vendor's lien remains and is not
extinguished.

Isn’t that correct?

The vendor’s privilege it

is called in Louisiana.
MR. O’SULLIVAN:
not be so.

No, sir, I would think that would

I think that we have cited case law in our brief

to the effect that, for example, with discharge or with
9

renovation or with, in the past, giving of notes, a vendor's
lien might be extinguished,
QUESTION:

Your argument is, I take it, that at this

hearing you had the burden of showing that your seizure was
proper.

That meant showing not only the vendor's lien but

21

that there was a default*
MR. O'SULLIVAN;
QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

And in order for the court not to set

aside the writ and the sequestration and collect on your bond, if
there was any damages, in order for the court to refuse to do
that, it had to find, you
MR, 0'SULLIVAN;
QUESTION;

argue, that there was a default.
Exactly so, sir,

You and your brother are not in agreement

as to that factual issue or as to that question of Louisiana
law.
MR, O’SULLIVAN;

That is a correct statement.

I think that my brother’s argument goes a little bit
further.

I think that he takes the position that there was

not a final determination on the merits as to the ultimate
right of possession of the property.
With that argument, I am in agreement.
such final determination.
in limbo.

There was no

The property, so to speak, is still

There has not been a final judgment in this case.

But I would submit that the Puentes case does not require an
initial threshold preliminary ultimate determination of the
right to the possession of —
QUESTION:

What do you think the standard is under

Louisiana law at the hearing to quash the seizure such as was
held in this case?

You have the burden of showing, you say,

that the seizure was justified.

Now, what standard does the

22

Court apply?

Probable cause?

Or is it sort of like a

preliminary hearing to establish whether there is a reasonable
basis for the claim?
MR. O’SULLIVAN;

In essence, I would submit, your

Honor, that at that hearing there is an inquiry into the
probable validity of the claim, in a sense akin to the
position asserted by Justice Harlan in the concurring opinion
in the Sniadach case.

That, I suggest, is implicit in that

the burden of proof is on the party that has caused the goods
to be seized in the first instance.

The party has to corne

into court and prove at that time that there is a claim, that
there is a default, that there is a valid vendor’s lien or
some other basis for having taken the property from the
possession of the vendee,
QUESTION;

Well, a vendor's lien standing alone would

not justify it.
Let me ask you this question hypothetically.

Suppose

at this preliminary hearing the debtor had come in and
tendered to the hearing officer receipts showing that he was
paid right up to date.

Would the court then be obliged to

dissolve the writ of sequestration and return the property?
MR. O'SULLIVAN;

Yes, sir, I think so.

I think

that Louisiana State Rice Milling Co. case cited in our brief
is to that effect.

And that case states that the mere

coincidence that a fact j.g relevant both on the writ of

23
sequestration and on the merits does not preclude use of that
fact on the hearing to dissolve the writ.

And we would

submit that if such a showing were made, and in fact we cited
in our brief a number of cases in which a party has come into
court xtfith a meritorious defense and had the opportunity
even before there need be a final determination on the merits
to have that defense heard*
Now, that didn't happen in this case.
QUESTION:

That's the basis for your saying there is

an implicit judicial determination of a default here.
MR. O’SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir.

Your Honor, we submit that in this case given the
facts of this case and the posture of the case before this
Court, that it makes no sense for the Court to order a new
hearing, a new hearing as to the temporary deprivation of the
petitioner's property.

That hearing has already been held.

Now, I would like, if I could, to turn to the
second area of relevant inquiry .here, and that is as to the
role of the judge who issues a writ of sequestration in the
first instance.

We contend that in this case there was a

prior judicial determination as to the propriety of the
taking of the petitioner's property before that property was
taken.
QUESTION:

If that’s true, of course, then Fuentes

in all its ramifications was fully satisfied, wasn't it, in

24

this case?

Is that your point?

MR. O'SULLIVAN;
QUESTION:

No, sir, I don’t think —

If it. was a prior determination of all of

the issues that had to do with who should have ultimate
possession of the property before the property was taken, then
I should suppose if Puentes is broadly read, it was fully
satisfied, wasn't it?
MR. O'SULLIVAN;

Mo, I don't think that that’s so,

your Honor.
QUESTION;

Well, then, what is your point?

MR. 0'SULLIVAN:

The reason for that is that the

prior judicial determination was ex parte, and the question is
whether or not the Louisiana ex parte prior judicial determina-*
tion satisfies the rule that is set forth in Fuentes,
QUESTION:

I see.

You don't say there was a prior

hearing in the sense of any kind of an adversary hearing.
MR. O'SULLIVAN:

It was not an adversarial hearing,

On page 23 of your brief, beginning at

the middle of the page, you say, "In order to meet the burden
of establishing that a writ of sequestration was properly issued,
a vendor must establish," and then you list six elements,

present, and there was argument before the court,
I might say, your honor, in regard to the record in
this case, and we have had questions as to the nature of the
stipulation and the extent of the stipulation as to the
vendor's lien in this case.

The record in this case is a very

meager one, and though I here argue this morning as to the
.role of the court on the motion to dissolve the writ and the
role of the judge as of the time that the writ is issued in the
first instance, there has not been in the record in this case
decisions below of the Louisiana court illuminating exactly
what the functions of the courts are under both those circum­
stances .

practice.

I recognize that problem and fear

that that’s so, your Honor.

We have endeavored to make

diligent inquiry into Louisiana law and we have done our best
to break out the cases.

But I do have some hesitancy in that

regard.
Coming back to the argument as to the prior ex parte
judicial determination as to the issuance of the writ, we
submit in this case there is a significant difference in
Louisiana from the situation both in Florida and Pennsylvania
as came up in the circumstances of the Puentes case.

Now, in

Louisiana we submit that there is effective control by the
State of the use of its power and that there is an official,
an

impartial government official,in this case the reviewing

judge, who must consider the grounds that are presented in the
application for the writ and that the court is entitled to
inquire into those grounds and satisfy itself that there is
a proper basis for the issuance of the writ.
QUESTION:

What is that, the lien as existing?

MR. O'SULLIVAN;
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

What else?

MR. O'SULLIVAN:

And that there is a probable validity

to the claim being asserted by the party commencing the
lawsuit and seeking the taking of the property.

MR. O’SULLIVAN:

No, sir, there was an ex parte

The application was made to the court, and under

the Louisiana decisions that we have cited in our brief, it is
the responsibility of the court to undertake an evaluation of
the claim and look into the facts that are alleged in the
petition, and make a determination as to the propriety of the
issuing of the writ.
QUESTION:

And the two facts are, one, that there

is a lien and, two, that there is a default.

That's all there

is, isn't it?
MR. 0'SULLIVAN:

And that the property is in the

possession of the vendee, yes, sir.

28

QUESTION:

That’s all there is.

MR. O’SULLIVAN:

I think it is, but I'm not entirely

clear on that, and the reason for that is because I do have
some trouble in reading precisely what the Louisiana Supreme
Court —

Louisiana law's Supreme Court opinions.

I think you should

have gone down there and looked at them, because it's civil
law,
MR. O'SULLIVAN:

Yes, sir, and I appreciate some of

the problems in the civil law, and in fact, Justice Holmes has
addressed himself to the question of dealing with problems
under the civil law, and he said,"When we contemplate such a
system from the outside, it seems like a wall of stone, every
part even with all the others, except so far as our own local
education may lead us to see subordination to which, we are
accustomed.

But to one brought up within it, varying emphasis,

tacit assumptions, unwritten practices, a thousand influences
gained only from life may give rise to the different parts
wholly new values that logic and grammar could never have
gotten from the books."
I submit that that quotation may be appropriate.
QUESTION:

You have taken the burden of showing that

you got a full and fair hearing and you now say you don't
know what it was.

29

MR. O’SULLIVAN.

No, sir.

What I am saying is tiiat

the Louisiana Supreme Court in this case held that on the facts
the case fell within the exception to the rule in the Puentes
case.
QUESTION:

Well, their reasoning was, as I understand

it, and I have just reread it here on the bench, was that the
vendee purchased the property with implied in lav/ knowledge
of what the law of Louisiana was.
MR. O’SULLIVAN;

Your Honor, I submit there is an

alternate ground —
QUESTION:

Was that what

MR. 0'SULLIVANs

it

said?

Yes, sir, it did.

But I submit

there is an alternate ground of decision in this case wnich
would be appropriate to consider, and this is set forth on
page 29 of the appendix.

The court stated that this case fell

within the exception to a rule announced in tiie Fuantes case
that there may be cases in which a creditor could make a
showing of immediate danger that a debtor will destroy or
conceal disputed goods.
QUESTION;

But now, what, if anything, in the record

of this case justified the statement tiiat this case comes
within that language in Puentes.

There may be cases in which

a creditor could make a showing of immediate danger tiiat a
debtor will destroy or conceal disputed goods?
MR. 0'SULLIVAN:

The answer to that question, your

30

Honor, is the uncontradicted allegations made in the petition
in this case to the effect that the respondent had reason to
fear that the petitioner would alienate or dispose of the
property
QUESTION:

Is that part of the form used in every

single one of these in Louisiana?
MR. O’SULLIVAN;

Your Honor, I don't know the answer

to that question, but I submit that in this case it was a fact.
It was a sworn statement that was never contested*
QUESTION;

What if it were part of the form used in

every single one of these, or used routinely and traditionally
in every single one of these in Louisiana, would you say that

The exception then becomes the rule,

is that this is a pro forma showing.

The suggestion here

In that regard, I suggest

that in part that may be attributable to the fact that this

was decided, and before

the parties and, indeed, the country knew what was required for
a showing that it had to be —•

31
QUESTION:

By the time it got to the Supreme Court

of Louisiana, Fuent.es had been decided quite clearly.
MR. O'SULLIVAN;

Yes, sir, it had.

Your Honor, one point I would like to make clear is
that we believe we have cited the cases appropriately for the
proposition that with respect to the threshold inquiry as to
at
the issuance of the writ of sequestration,/the ex parte hearing
there is considerable authority vested in the court and the
judge to make inquiry as to the claim that is being asserted
and to test that claim.

And we have seen the petitioner in

his reply brief endeavor to distinguish the cases on tiie basis
that there is a difference between judicial sequestration-- and
these cases only apply to judicial sequestration-- and some other
cases.

The claim is that in cases involving judicial sequestra­

tion there is discretion; in cases involving ordinary garden
variety sequestration there is no discretion.
We submit that attention to prior law under which
these cases were decided indicates that there is only one
kind of sequestration, and that is the judicial sequestration.
We set forth the definition of sequestration on page 30 of our
brief, and that shows that sequestration applies to a mandate
of tiie court to the sheriff to take property without regard
to whether it's made at the request of one of the parties or
both of the parties.

So those cases, we submit, are applicable.

One further point that I think deserves to be made

32

in the context of this case, and that is the unusual feature
of the

civil law.

Here the vendor's lien as the Louisiana

Supreme Court has set forth in its opinion is thought to be an
important creditor's right.
that can easily be

At the same time it's a right

defeated by the debtor»

In the event that

the debtor transfers the property, the vendor loses the right
as against the property.

And so it was for this reason that

the Louisiana Supreme Court, I believe, took the position that
this was an important right that needed to be safeguarded and
that there were circumstances in which it could be shown that
there was an immediate need for action on the part of the
creditor and that it would be appropriate for the government to
lend its power to the taking of that action.
QUESTIONs

On the question that Mr. Justice Stewart

gave you, in your Appendix C, the Supreme Court of Louisiana,

form?

So do you agree

it's just a

33

MR. O'SULLIVANs

Yes, sir, I do.

But we submit that

in view of the circumstances in which the case has arisen, in
view of the fact that initial determinations and initial
proceedings took place prior to the time that the Puentes
decision was rendered and in view of the fact that there has
been a hearing in this case in which it has been determined
that under the facts of this case there has not been a mistaken
or unjustified or wrongful taking of the property of the
petitioner,

we submit that it would be appropriate for this

Court either to vacate the writ as having been improvidently
granted or to affirm the decision of the court below.
If there are any further questions of the Court, I
would be happy to entertain them.
QUESTION:

If not

Mr. O'Sullivan, you are not asking, I

take it, that Fuentes be overruled?
MR. 0'SULLIVAN s

We would be

contending that the Louisiana law and the facts of this case
as well as the Louisiana Supreme Court decision are sufficiently
different from the Fuentes case as to not require its application to the present case.

I would submit, your Honor, that the

great number of the decisions involving an application of that
section of the Uniform Commercial Cede have held that action
under that section was not unconstitutional on the ground that
it didn’t constitute State action.

And just recently both the

3th and 9th Circuit have come down on the side of self-help as
being not unconstitutional.

thing further?

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Let me ask you before you

or whether there was an effort to prove the absence of a
default?

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. HOBBS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR- HOBBS;

Yes.

The law of Louisiana is not clear

as to what is relevant at that post-seizure hearing.

This was

ray position,, one, that I had two good grounds to dissolve that
sequestration
statute.

the constitutional claim and an exemption

But what the Louisiana courts do say, in Louisiana

Code of Civil Procedure, Article 3506 covers the dissolution
of the writ of sequestration.

Comment C to that article states

"This article retains the jurisprudential rule that only the
grounds for the auxiliary remedy can be inquired into on the
motion to dissolve andysignificantlytand not the merits of the
main demand,"
QUESTION:

As a practical matter if you could prove

that you were not. in default, that would end the whole matter
and you would get your merchandise back, wouldn't you?
MR. HOBBS;

Certainly.

If the statutes had been

declared unconstitutional, I would have gotten the property
back.

If the exemption statutes had been found applicable to

this procedure, I would have gotten the property back.

In

fact, the court, the Louisiana Supreme Court, divided on the
exemption issue.

They did not divide on the constitutional

issue.
I would like to point out

Mr. Rehnquist directed

a question to Mr. O'Sullivan regarding my geographical preference.
I would just like to point out that I have been in Boston for
a year.

much, but my entire practice of law prior to that was in the

I was in at the outset.
What is the practice in the Parish of

New Orleans about the issuance of this writ of sequestration?
Is it strictly a pro forma thing, or does the judge who is
asked to issue the writ review the affidavit to see tnat it
complies with the statute?
MR. HOBBS:

I think the practice is that a petition,

which I characterize, and I think, fairly so, as a pro forma,
that is, it's a legal procedure used over and over again, is
presented to the judge.

He is bound by the statute, 3501 of

Perhaps

39

if we had such safeguards as is embodied in the Federal rules
for an injunction, maybe we could say we will allow deprivations
without the adversarial context.

But those safeguards would

have to be examined in the case in which they were used, because
they are not the traditional methods of safeguarding one person’s
interest against the claim of another.
QUESTION;

The hearing you would want before a

seizure, would the standard that would be applied be one of
probable cause or what?

Or would the court have to find

finally that the debt was due and unpaid, overdue and unpaid?

QUESTION;

With your probable cause standard.,, you

think there must be not only notice, but an opportunity to

You can’t just decide the probable cause

issue on the basis of affidavit.

Let's assume you had an

opportunity to counter-affidavit and then argue if you wanted to,
but no witnesses.
MR, HOBBS;

Yes.

If that affidavit was presented

in an adversarial context, that is, where one party presents
his side of the case, we are dealing with an affidavit on which a
judge is acting on one side of the case,
QUESTION;
MR. HOBBS;

Say for summary judgment —
I would suggest if we had a requirement

in Louisiana that there was a detailed showing of all that the
creditor knows and the judge was given the discretion as a
judge in Federal courts are given discretion in issuing a TRO,
that we would have a very different situation, and it should be
closely examined and determine whether those safeguards are
accurate.

But this is not the case.
QUESTION;

Well, it seems to me awfully relevant

as to what kind of a hearing they are talking about as to
whether you are entitled to it.

If you are talking about a

final hearing on the merits before any transfer of possession
is concerned, it might be one thing.

If you are not, it's

41
something else maybe»

MR, HOBBS:

I would also, in conjunction with the

request on what is relevant tit that post™seizure hearing, there
is one case in which a judge at a post seizure hearing did
enter a judgment on the merits against the dispossessed party.
That case was reversed; it was held that that was not to be
determined at that motion to dissolve.

And I cite that in my

reply brief, it's Tucker v. Schonekas.
The question, though, is what standards apply to the
judge at the time he is presented with these documents and
requested to issue the sequestration.

The Louisiana courts

make it clear that mandamus will lie to compel him to issue
the writ of sequestration if the documents on their face are
proper.

He does not have the discretion to go beyond the face

of those documents or even to question what they say on their
face.
In this case there is simply no requirement of the
f'

detailed showing.
I think unless there is any further questions, that's
my case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:34 a.m,, the oral argument in the
above-entitled matter was concluded.)
