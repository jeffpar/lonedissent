§Ll*2C!iLE3.INGS
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Wo. 72-887, American Party of Texas, et al, v.
Bob Bullock, Secretary of State of Texas.
Mrs. Svanas, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLORIA TANNER SVANAS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. SVANAS:
Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and members of the

I am Gloria Svanas, representing the Appellants in this

case, the minority parties in Texas, THE AMERICAN PARTY OF
TEXAS, THE SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY OF TEXAS, and THE TEXAS NEW
PARTY; also representing the independent candidate, Laurel Dunn,
who was a candidate for the United States Congress.
This is a direct appeal from a 3-Judge Federal Court
in the Western District of Texas, finding certain sections of
the Texas Election Code to be constitutional.
It is the contention of the Appellants, these minority
parties, that the Texas Election Code is precisely drawn to
accomplish the goal that is intended to accomplish:

that is,

the purposeful and invidious discrimination against minor par­
ties and independent candidates.

The Legislature in Texas arbi­

trarily and capriciously controls elections in Texas.
It has been said that there are four alternative
routes to ballot position in Texas.

It is urged by the Appel­

lants that there, rather, there are four exclusionary routes

5

from the ballot in Texas»

The first exclusion is based on a

difference of opinion with political philosophy.

You either

join up with the Republican and Democratic parties in Texas or
you are actually excluded — practically excluded — from the
ballot.

You either adopt the political philosophy of the two

major parties, or you surrender your First Amendment freedoms
which allow you to practice the philosophy which you believe,
and to associate and organize political parties for that pur­
pose .
Once you have participated in the Party Primary you
are locked in to that particular party.

Actually, voting in a

Party Primary constitutes registration in the State of Texas,
not only from the standpoint of our continuous registration,
which we now have, but also from party affiliation.

Only through

participation in the major political parties are you allowed
the privilege of absentee voting.

Otherwise, you are completely

excluded from absentee voting, and if you should desire to go
fishing on election day, or should you, by any other reason,
be prevented from participating at the ballot box, you will go
to the County Clerk's office in Texas and be compelled to either
vote Republican or Democrat or forfeit your right to vote.
Q

Do you know of any other state that has such a

provision as to absentee ballots being restricted to one or two
parties?

6

MRS„ SVANAS:

No, sir, I have not found one.

I

found one particular case this Court had decided in McDonald
from the Illinois case, but in that one the absentee privi­
leges were restricted to those who were confined in institu­
tions, even though they may just have been under charges and
had not been convicted.

I find it a little bit harsh to com­

pare the minority parties in Texas to the inmates of penal
institutions in other states.
The added bonus which we have in Texas since the
1971 McKool-Stroud Primary Financing Law, which is also part
of this appeal, is the fact that if you participate in the
Republican and the Democrat Primary you get the bonus of having
a tax-paid-for Primary.

If, on contrast, if you should de­

termine to participate with one of the minority parties, then
you are compelled to pay all of these expenses out of the
minority party account.
There are no write-ins in the Primaries in Texas
since the original time of the rise of the Republican Party
in Texas, which used to nominate by write-ins in the Primaries,
so they excluded write-ins from Primaries when that party
started growing up.
Actually, the nomination for local offices in Texas
by the Democrat Primary, as a practical exercise, is determative participation because nomination for most offices in

7

Texas by the Democrat Primary is tatamount to election.
The second exclusion from the ballot in Texas is by
the numbers of the votes for Governor which were cast for the
candidate of that particular political party in the last
gubernatorial or general election.

For instance, the American

Party, in 1968, polled 584,000 votes for its nominee for
United States President, but because the American Party did
not have a nominee on the ballot for Governor it was automati­
cally excluded from the ballot from that time.

The question

is, is the numbers of vote gained insofar as the gubernatorial
candidate concerned a fair competition, and does that fair
competition constitute a compelling State interest?
We need not speculate what might have happened to
our requirement for vote because of what actually did happen
in Texas after the RAZA UNIDA candidate secured the necessary
signatures and obtained ballot position in the 1972 Primary.
They polled more than 2 percent of their vote for their gu­
bernatorial candidate in 1972, and, consequently, they — the
Texas Legislature, in meeting in its next biennial session,
raised the quota from 2 percent to 20 percent for automatic
ballot position from this State.

And so the numbers game does

prevail in Texas, and if one minority party happens to fulfill
the requirements of that then law, then they'll change the law
again.

And, actually, that was the difference that was made

8

in the law in this 13.45 (2) after the 1968 campaign, when
the AMERICAN PARTY started to rear its head as a competitive
factor in Texas.

And so the law was changed, and so we got

these onerous petitions which we are now required to circu­
late .
This is the basis of the third exclusion from the
ballot in Texas.

If the gubernatorial candidate did not re­

ceive 2 percent of the vote, which has now been raised to
20 percent of the vote, in the last general election, you
have to go out and start the petition route again.

Of course,

this presumes that you had a gubernatorial candidate.

It

would also include new parties, like the TEXAS NEW PARTY and
the TEXAS SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY, which did not have a can­
didate on the ballot of any kind in 1970, and was not organ­
ized on a state-wide basis.
Wa have a statutorily dictated state-wide organi­
zation in Texas for new and minority political parties.
Early as November proceeding the General Election we are
required to file a notice of intent to nominate by convention.
In January, all candidates must file for office on that ballot.
By March, the state rules must be filed.

In May, the county

precinct conventions must be held at the same time as the
party primary conventions are being held.

And suddenly the

whole Texas totalitarian idea takes on the very reflections
of Williams v. Rhodes.

The petitions which are required in

9
Texas are statutorily dictated and exacting in wording.

The

wording must be exactly as it is dictated by the statutes or
they are not accepted and filed by the Secretary of State.
The form is dictated, the form of the signature.
Prior to the holding of the precinct conventions
throughout the 254 counties in Texas in May, there must be
printed and circulated these petitions.

This is the first

step for qualification for ballot position by the numbers game
in Texas.

They must be circulated, they must be in the hands

of the precinct chairmen ir> each of the precincts so they will
be available for signature on that day, because, beginning as
of that day, you have a total of 54 days as in 1972 — there
might be 55 days next year — to secure one percent of the
total vote for Governor in the preceeding General Election
to sign these petitions to indicate this support for some
candidate who might be running on this minority party ticket.
This number in 1972 was some 22,000 plus signatures; in 1974,
will be 36,000 plus signatures.
But these petitions not only must be in this exact
form, but they must be signed before a notary public, and
they carry a criminal penalty that you must have — you must
swear that you have not participated in any of the other
party primaries in any way whatsoever.

You have already been

excluded from the absentee balloting, and it is the contention
of the minority parties, hereon appealed, that certainly if

10
you are to put out a petition after the primary, we should
also be accorded the right to compete for those absentee
votes.

And there are many thousands of absentee votes cast

in Texas in each election.
Q

Mrs. Svanas, you referred to a candidate for

the Presidency of the United States on what you call a minority
party.

Was that the American Party?
MRS. SVANAS:
Q

And that was in 1968?

MRS. SVANAS:
Q

Yes, sir, it was.

Yes, sir, it was.

Was that party on the ballot, as such?

MRS. SVANAS:

We were on the ballot from the stand­

point only of the Presidential candidate — yes, sir.

But,

see, after the 1368 election, when the American Party did
poll 584,000 votes —
Q

For your Presidential candidate...

MRS. SVANAS:

Yes, sir, for the Presidential can­

didate —•
Q

You had no gubernatorial candidate?

MRS. SVANAS:

That's right. But not only at that

time, it was a very simple matter.

13.45 (2) was changed

in 1969 to meet that competitive threat of 1968, to assure
that it would be very difficult to make the ballot in 1970
and '72; and that's were we came up with our petition require­
ment in Texas.

But in 1968, it was a simple matter, by com-

11
parison, for a minority party to get on the ballot, and that
was the method that was followed by the American Party to
secure ballot position.
Q

But since that time the law has been —

MRS. SVANAS:
Q

— changed, making it more difficult for —

MRS. SVANAS:
Q

Yes, sir, it has been changed.

Much more difficult, sir.

— this party to get on.

MRS. SVANAS:

And, actually, the Legislature in

Texas meets every two years, and it seems that the Election
Code changes every two years to meet the threat of the minority
party, or the independent or the competing party, just as the
change has been made.

Now, the 1972 McKool-Stroud Act for

the purpose of State financing of party primaries was a oneyear statute, and it was thought that the 1972 Legislature
would change the election laws to provide for the whole new
primary election procedure.

But since they did not do so,

they did have to pass another financing bill, which is the
Senate Bill 11, which has been filed by the American Party
as a Supplemental Appendix.

And they provided in that, appa­

rently to pay for the major party primaries in 1974, but just
happened to incidentally change 13.45 (2) again, to require
that to maintain ballot position after 1974, that the party
would have to poll 20 percent of the votes for Governor.

Of

course, it's forseeable that this could result in active cam-

12

paigning by those who are now on the ballot to the point
that some one of the three might even be excluded.
The fourth exclusion from the ballot is probably
what is recognized in Texas as the least competition to the
major parties, and that is the exclusion of the independents
and the non-partisan candidates.

It is the contention of Mr.

Laurel Dunn, who was the candidate for United States Congress,
that the requirement of the petition, in addition to the
United States Constitutional specified qualifications for
United States Congress, is actually the super-added idea —
the petitions are super-added to the qualifications, as was
distinguished by the KENT'S COMMENTARIES ON CONSTITUTIONAL
LAW.

This, of course, is the Powell v. McCormick suit which

earlier had been decided as to Powell's additional qualifi­
cations, or attempt to exclude him from the House of Repre­
sentatives .
It is the contention of the Appellants that the
statutory exclusions from the ballot in Texas result in con­
stitutional, unjustifiable inequities.

We don't believe that

there is anything in the record, whatsoever, by which the
State of Texas even attempts to justify these exclusions.
Where is the compelling State interest for the deviations
from these constitutional guarantees that any voter can ef­
fectively participate in the election for the candidate of
his choice, as compared to being compelled to participate

13

in either of the two major parties.

The size of the ballot

falls on deaf ears when we realize the numbers of the candi­
dates who each year file in the Republican and Democrat Pri­
maries for the office of Governor and the other controlling
offices in Texas,

This is particularly true since this Court

has overturned the filing fees requirement in the State of
Texas.
Q

Mrs. Svanas, to come back a minute to the party

conventions which you mentioned.

I think, as I recall, in

Article 13.47, it states that party conventions shall be held
in precincts, county and state.
MRS. SVANAS:
Q

Yes, sir.

Now, is that construed literally to require

that a precinct convention be held in every precinct in the
State of Texas?
MRS. SVANAS;

Yes, sir.

It is not required to be

held, but if we are to secure the signatures, as are required,
then the ballots — the petitions, pardon me — must be dis­
tributed to each of these precincts, and begun at -that level.
The requirement becomes more obvious if one desires to parti­
cipate in the primary in that the attendance at the county
convention is limited to those who attended the precinct
convention, not to those who have signed the petition.

And

then the attendance at the state convention, which nominates
on the state-wide level, is limited to those who attended the

14
county convention, which, of course, has been limited by
the precinct.

So, actually, to have any voice in the minor

political party in Texas, it is necessary that you attend
the precinct conventions and make your voice heard there so
you can attend on up the row.

And it’s this continuous re­

quirements by statute of what we roust do that makes it prac­
tically impossible to attain ballot position in Texas.
Q

If conventions are not held in every precinct,

or in every county, does that disqualify the individual, or
the party?
MRS. SVANAS:

It does not disqualify the party, but

it does disqualify the individual, because of his lack of
participation there is no way for his to go back and become
a participant, that is, in the nomination for the county and
the stat-wide offices.

It is to be noted from the record

that the Republican did not even hold party primaries in every
county in Texas, since we do have so many counties, and some
of them don't indicate any interest in the Republican Party.
So those particular persons, if they did not participate in
the Democrat Primary, and there was no offering of a precinct
convention by the American Party, then they were totally
without a vote in Texas in 1972.
Thank you.
Q

Mrs. Svanas, let me ask you one question.

Ex­

plain to me this 5 percent bonus for the County Clerk under

15
the Financing Law.
MRS. SVANAS:

That's the county — that's the party

county chairman,, Mr. Justice.

The State law in Texas pro­

vides under the McKool-Stroud Act and under the new, recently
passed Primary Financing Law, that the county chairmen of
the major political parties, which this year will include
RAZA UNIDA because they did qualify by the 2 percent vote
in 1972 — they will determine how much it is going to cost
them to hold a primary in each county in Texas, and they will
report that amount to the Secretary of State.
Then they -- after the primary has been held, and
the run-off primary, then they will report the actual amount
spent, and based on the actual amount spent, each county
chairman in Texas is allowed to claim a 5 percent bonus him­
self for his participation in the major party primaries.
Q

Very well, Mrs. Svanas.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Hainsworth?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. HAINSWORTH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HAINSWORTH:
please the Court;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I am here today to speak in behalf of the

Appellant Hainsworth, and also in behalf of those others who
have endeavored to become independent candidates in the State
of Texas over the years, and have not quite been able to make
it.

16
To become an independent candidate in Texas, one
has to meet the requirements of Article 13.50 of the Texas
Election Code, which provides, among other things, that the
candidate must obtain a certain percentage of the votes of
a certain number of the people who cast a ballot for Governors,
both Democratic and Republican, at the last preceeding general
election.

In addition to that, if the candidate is from a

one-county district, he has to get 5 percent.

If the candidate

is from a district composed of one or more counties, then the
candidate is only required to get 3 percent of the vote.

So

there is some variance, even with respect to candidates, de­
pending upon the number of counties in the district.
In addition, the independent candidate has to obtain
notarized signatures from each signer of his application.

And

in addition to that, the independent candidate is proscribed
in making his efforts to canvass for signatures in that those
who have participated in the first primary, either Democratic
or Republican, and those who have voted in the second primary —
or run-off primary — are not eligible to be canvassed by the
independent candidate for that particular office, provided
anybody has been a candidate in those primaries

those two

primaries.
That, in effect, limits the independent candidate
to about 50 percent of the voters in his district.

Now, the

appellant in this case was a candidate for State Representative

17
in District 24 — District 28 86.

And this particular

county is a single-member district.

And there are approxi­

mately 23 to 24 single-member districts in Harris County,
Texas.

There are approximately 74-75,000 people in each state

representative district, and it is difficult to beat those
requirements of the State statute, Article 13.50, in order to
qualify as an independent candidate.
In addition, another difficulty is the requirement
that you must get those signatures within 30 days — 30 days
after the close of second primary day, which usually comes
about 3rd of July.

It did in 1972.

The 3-Judge District Court, in deciding the consoli­
dated cases, stated in its opinion that these consolidated
cases fell in between Williams v. Rhodes and Jenness v.
Fortson, in that the Supreme Court, in the Williams case, was
working on one end of the spectrum, and in the Fortson case
they were working on the other; and that the facts in these
consolidated cases now before the Court fell exactly in
between.
However, it seemed to me that the Jenness case was
the one that the 3-Judge District Court should have applied
in making its decision.

Because, in that particular case

are laid down some rules, or possibly it may be stated that
the State of Georgia had set forth the requirements that it
considered appropriate for independent candidates, and it

18
may be that, they were very, very liberal.

But it seems to

me that they were very, very fair, and I would like to submit
to the Court that they should give consideration, serious con­
sideration, to following the Jenness case in its requirements
insofar as independent candidates are concerned.

In that

particular case, no notary public was required, in that partic­
ular State, insofar as an independent candidate was concerned
in getting on the ballot.
Q

Well, what’s involved in getting a notarized

signature?
MR. HAIMSWORTH:
one thing.

The matter is one of expense, for

And another is the matter of —
Q

How much does it cost?

MR. HAINSWORTH:

Well, the notary public fee, by

State statute in Texas, is 50 cents for each notarization.
However, when you have to go out — whenever a notary public
goes out of his office to notarize something, it always costs
more.

And, of course, if you are an independent candidate,

or trying to become an independent candidate, you've got to
get a notary public who will go around with you and walk and
walk, and notarize as necessary, whenever you can get somebody
who is willing to sign your application.

And it takes a lot

of walking, and lots of people who are employed will not walk
for a dollar a signature.

They may want even more.

Then those

you get are maybe the kind of people who are not able to keep

19
up, so you are kind of hampered.

It puts a burden upon inde­

pendent candidate —
Q

What formality does the notary public have to

follow?
MR. HAINSWORTH:

Well, there is an oath prescribed

by State statute which says something like this:

"I solemnly

swear that I have not participated in any primary, first or
second, held this year to nominate a candidate for the office
for which I desire John Jones, an independent candidate, to
be a candidate for."

And so on.

That is, in substance, x^hat's

in the oath.
Q

The notary have to execute any formal return — ?

MR. HAINSWORTH:

Well, this i3 what the application

is drawn up, so that it can be for each individual signer,
or it can be drawn up so that ten, fifteen or twenty persons
can sign the same application.

But in each instance, the

notary public has to appear — the person has to appear before
the notary public and have him to swear that he is stating
the truth.

And, of course, that kind of limits some people,

because people somewhat don't like to make an oath.
kind of reluctant.

They are

So that kind of deters some individuals

from taking the oath, and that takes away from the applicant
in getting signatures.
Q

As a practical matter, don't they usually get

petitions by sending a notary public out to get them, or at

20
least have the notary public go out with the party worker?
MR. HAIMS WORTH;

Well now,, of course, we are dealing

with an independent candidate.

And usually an independent

candidate is working alone.
Q

Well --

MR. HAINSWORTH:

And he is trying to get somebody

to help him, and he is not able to get —
Q

Most independent —

MR. HAINSWORTH;

•— anybody to go out for him, .and

stay there, too.
Q

Most independent candidates have some friends,

or they aren't likely to get many votes.

Isn’t that a prac­

tical reality?
MR. HAINSWORTH:

Well, I think this, Your Honor,

the friendship comes when the independent candidate himself
goes, and speaks with the individual, and the individual will
readily sign.
Q

I think that is the kind of friendship —
If you carry that to its logical conclusions,

then you would object to the requirement of getting any signa­
tures at all, because that takes work.
MR. HAINSWORTH:

Well, no, sir, I would not object

to that.
Q

Your objection, then, just goes to the degree —

MR. HAINSWORTH:

Well, it goes to the notarization.

And, of course now, if it wasn't for the notarization I could

21

go out myself and get 500 signatures, without any hesitancy.
But when I have to take a notary public along, and if I can
walk faster than the notary public, and I've got to wait until
he catches up, and I've got to go to those, and let him know
that these won't sign, I've got to keep going — well, I can
work all day, and I may get 15.
And that's the way it goes.

But now that, in itself,

the notarization would be all right if you had, say, 90 days,
or 60 days, but you only have 30 days.
ways.

So they cut you both

If the notarisation provision is there, and if I could

work, or any independent candidate could work, 60 days, he
could get the 500 signatures.

But when you have to have

them notarised, you’re only limited to 30 days, and then
you are excluded from those who voted in the Democratic and
Republican primaries •— well, you're cut so far down, and you
don't know who to go to — you have to go from house to house,
and may have voted, and they say, "Well, I would sign, but I
voted already..."

So, there's lots of handicaps and burdens

that you have to undergo in order to try and qualify.

Of

course, it's not impossible.
In fact, if I had been able to have forseen the
many months of work that I would have had to have undergone
to get here, I believe I would work night and day to have
made it.

And I think I would have saved some time.
However, I am hoping that my appearance here will

22

serve to make the Court aware of the problems of an indepen­
dent candidate, in that an independent candidate is striving
to help make the country stronger.

And when an indepexident

candidate goes out for a small office, he does not expect to
wield great influence.

It's just a matter of trying to cham­

pion some idea of government that he has.

And if it meets

with the approval of the people, and he is able to get elected,
fine.
Of course, when an independent candidate gets on
the general election ballot, he still has the Democratic Party
and the Republican Party to defeat.

And he's strictly an

He’s got a hard fight on his hands, and he gets no

funding, or no financing, like the Democratic Party does.
It’s all coming out of his pocket.

is tatamount to election, well, they're in.

Sometimes it's just a

And, of course, it all depends upon what the office

23

is that the candidate is running for.
Now, I hope to reserve 5 minutes for a rebuttal if
I may.

I don11 know whether I've gone over or not.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Hill?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. HILL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES
MR. HILL:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

I want to first thank Mrs. Svanas for filing an

Appendix with this Honorable Court, in which she very promptly,
after the Governor signed Senate Bill 11, filed that as an
Appendix with the

Court, saving us the trouble of doing this.

I think It speaks

very clearly for itself, and we have not

elaborated by any

additional brief with reference to it.

The second thing I would

like to say that, particu­

larly after listening to him, although I'd known him in
Houston, that our Texas admires independent candidates, and
we want people like Mr. Hainsworth to stand, .if they desire,
as independent candidates ? and I think our laws have accord­
ingly allowed that.
I need to speak, if I might, for a moment factually
to the American Party's situation.

This party, of course,

was a very viable political force in 1968 in our State, with
over 91,000 signed up members, and they cast 584,269 votes
for George Wallace for President.

24
Now, since the American Party elected not, for
reasons of their own, to field a Governor nominee in the 1968
general election, that party, in 1970, was required under our
statute to nominate candidates for State and local offices
for the general election by conventions.

And, when the

party did not file with Mark White, whom I represent — our
Secretary of State —• sufficient certification to indicate
the minimum support that our statutes covering these matters
contemplate -- something in the neighborhood of 22,000 con­
ventioneers — or, if that many people don't get to the con­
vention, we permit supplementation by petition, which we re­
gard as a helping hand, not as a deterrent.

An add-on, an

addition.
For reasons that I frankly don't know, nor under­
stand, and the record is silent on it, they just simply had
6,828

names.

And whether they were — that was because of

their tremendous — and the Court can take judicial knowledge
of their great participation in the Democratic Party — or.
not — I do not know.

But those are the facts.

Now, the New Party, on the other hand, which repre­
sents truly just what it is, a new party, a Texas new party.
We don't know very much about it.
about it.

We're not told very much

This Court is not told much about it.

It made no

effort at all, under this record, to have any compliance.
And that’s where that matter stands.

25

The Socialist Workers Party did comply with
our laws, and they were on the ballot.

And they’re, while

filing a brief here, are not here at least verbalizing that,
and I don't know of any substantial complaint they raise.
The Raza Unida, who took no appeal from this matter,
and we're a State of many minority parties, today, which is
the proof of the pudding.

Ran a very fine gentleman for

Governor -- he received a very good vote, and they qualified
under the 2 percent.

And I'll discuss how our procedure

works in a little more detail in a moment.
And then, Mr. Laurel Dunn, who was an independent
candidate for the United States House of Representatives, and
represents himself and the four other independent candidates,
made absolutely no attempt to meet the requirements of our
statutes, with reference to independent candidates, and simply
filed suit shortly after the primary election, which he had a
perfect right to do.
Mr. Hainsworth did try, having not obtained, for
reasons that I am sure the Court has heard here, and whether
that represents inability or what, we can't judge.
peculiarly within the — probably in his mind.

It's a

But nonetheless,

his 328 fell short of the 500, which we believe is not an
onerous burden, and one that many have met.

He filed suit

attacking the constitutionality of these provisions in a very
candid and open way that he displayed here before the Court.

Mow, we were faced in Texas this last session of the
Legislature with this situations

we were faced with Williams,

had read Rosario v. Rockefeller.

We

We had here three cases in

which this Court, a majority of this Court, had been heavily
involved.

In addition to that, you had written Bullock v.

Carter, arising from our State, involving our financing situ­
ation of our filing fees.
If I might, in that context, discuss with you for a
moment Senate Bill 11 that is here as an Appendix, which was
passed and signed by our Governor on June the 15th of this
year.

It provides:

I) a schedule of filing fees that we

believe are in keeping with the rules of reasonableness per­
mitted by Bullock v. Carter —• much less than before — much,
much less —■ not here under attack, and permitting the filing
of a candidate of a nominating petition in lieu of the pay­
ment of filing fees, which we believe is very progressive, in
keeping with Carter v. Bullock, and not here under attack,
provides for State --Q

JSIotarized signatures required?

MR. HILL:
Q

Beg pardon?

Notarized signatures?

MR. HILL:

Yes, sir. Five thousand in a State-wide

27
race.
Q

Notarised.

MR. HILL:

Yes, sir.

And the notarization, Mr.

Chief Justice Marshall, as far as I am aware, has not been
under attack in any decisions of which I am familiar; and the
only decision in which the matter has been discussed, was —
it was not thought to be a constitutional burden.

And, more­

over, if I might — pardon me, Mr. —
Q

And that's much less than the Jenness against

Georgia requirement, is it?
MR. HILL:

Oh yes, sir, much, much.

You see, on the

Jenness v. Georgia — if we used Jenness, and this can be
considered by a State, trying to speak for our Legislature;
but 5 percent of our total electorate in Texas — and that
is Jenness —- it's not 5 percent of a gubernatorial candidate,
it's 5 percent of the electorate.

I don't know what Mrs.

Svanas and others would say that constitutes as of the time
relevant to this case —• something over 200,000 signatures.
And we would be passing clear constitutional muster.

Under

Jenness, we just walk in, doff our hats and walk out.
We have elected, not in any effort to hold down
minority parties, but we have elected in our State in an effort
to have a totally fair system and one that we believe is much
preferable to Georgia, and much fairer to Georgia, to have
one percent — one percent —

28

Q

How many —•

MR. HILL:

— of gubernatorial, which would be about

22,000, under our — in other words, we, like a lot of other
States, Mr. Justice White, don't vote our folks.
Q

But that 22,000 means $11,000.00, doesn't it?

MR. HILL:
Q

No, sir.

Mr. Justice Marshall, I —

Do you agree that it's not 50 cents per signa­

ture?
MR. HILL:

Well, sir, the practical answer to that,

and I realize that we have a Carter problem here, as far as
when you get into the question of wealth and cost —
Q

That's what I was thinking —

MR. HILL:

— I'm not unmindful of that, but the

facts are that notarization is allowed — and I have the
statute open here — is allowed in bulk on certification, for
one thing.

It says that the certifying officer may certify

the petitions — if I might just —
"One certificate of the officer before whom the
oath is taken may be so made as to apply to all to whom it
was administered."

The candidate can be a notary.

I’m not

suggesting that there can’t be some cost here, but it’s an
exaggerated point, in my own judgement.
Q

How long does ne have?

MR. HILL:

He has — you mean in terms of the in­

Well, how long does he have to have to get

the 2,200 -MR. HILL:
Q

Well, sir, you see the basic way we —

22,000.

MR. HILL:

— work, Mr. Justice White, is through

conventions —
Q

Yes?

MR. HILL:

— of minorities' parties.

We presume

that the convention will be held on the same day that we as
Democrats vote, and that the Republicans vote, and all other
parties — that the conventions will be held, and as a result
of the convention, the 22,000 people will attend and certify
their names.

You don't even get into petitions.

The only way

we get into petitions at all, in Texas, is, we allow it as a
supplement to the convention process.
Q

Or a substitute.

MR. HILL:

It — no — well, it could be a total

substitute, but our statutes, frankly are written to where it
is implied in the statute that you will try to have conventions.
Now, for example, the Socialist Workers Party, in qualifying —
Q

I thought your opponents argued they were

strictly limited in time in getting these —
MR. HILL:
Q

They have 55 days —

To do what?

MR. HILL:

their petitions by conventions in Harris County.

In

You are not re­

You can have the conventions

wherever you elect to have those conventions.
When you go to your conventions, a minority party —
and the only ones in our State that are a minority party are
those that didn’t poll over 2 percent of the gubernatorial
vote in the preceeding general election.

So we don’t have a

very harsh rule of threshold to begin with.

But when they

go under that rule, and they come to these convention pro­
cesses, it’s anticipated.

And they can go out all the time

our elections are going on and say, "Don’t vote in that Demo­
cratic Primary.

I want you to come to our convention.

We’re

going to have it the same day."
Q

All right, you can supply the names by certify­

ing that those who attend you convention —MR. HILL;
Q

Yes, sir.

-- or in 55 days between then and the election,

I guess —
MR. HILL:

Wo, sir.

It works this Xvray.

In early

May, we have our -Q

My mistake.

MR. HILL:

— first Democratic Primary, or our first

31

primaries.

On that same day, minority parties who are under

the 2 percent or less rule, have their conventions, any time
from seven to seven.

When they go into those conventions, if

they produce — and they can have them in one county, 50
counties, 30 comities — wherever they want to have them where
they think they have support.

They can bring the voters in —

their people — into those conventions.

They could have al­

ready told them, and had it planned ahead of time, that that’s
what we're going to do.
Then, when they get there, if they have 22,000 —
roughly —
Q

You’ve said that.

Now go on.

Let’s assume they

don't.
MR. HILLs

All right, then they have an extra period

of time, up until the latter part of June —■
Q

How long is that?

MR. HILL:
Q

*— which is 55 days.

All right, 55 days.

MR. HILL:

To supplement the convention signatures,

if they don't have quite enough.
Q

Well, if they don't have any, they’ve got 55

days to get 22,000.
MR. HILL:
Q
he have to do?

Yes, sir.

If nobody shows up —

How about the independent candidate?

What does

32

MR. HILLs

Independent candidate — he, of course,

files along the time that everyone else does.

He has — he

can start getting his petitions signed after the primary,
which would be in May, and he must turn 'em in 30 days after
the second

after the run-off.

I guess, adding that up,

if you could help me, I'd say it's something, if you started
right after May, you’re looking at the better part of 2 months.
Q

I beg your pardon, about 24 or 25 days, not

counting Sundays.
MR. HILL:

Well, if you would — if you started only

after the second run-off — the second run-off — in other
words, if you started after the June run-off to get the inde­
pendent candidate signatures you would be restricted, if you
wanted to exclude Sundays, to something in the neighborhood
of 25 days.

It's my thought about it that there’s nothing in

that statute, once the May primary is held, to prevent the in­
dependent candidate from securing signatures.
Q

So he's got — you •— according to you, you’ve

got —
MR. HILL:
Q

Beg your pardon?

When may they get the petitions?

MR. HILL:

They can get the petition any time after

they've filed for their — announcing their candidacy.

They

file like every other candidate does, back in February.
Q

And they can get the petitions in February?

33

MR. HILL:

They could get the petition, and I don't -

the last thing I would want to do is make a misstatement, and
I don't — first, I don't know for certain.

I believe that

that —
Q

I understand that the petition is not available

until after the primary.
MR. HILL:

I don't believe that's correct, Mr.

Justice Marshall.
Q

All right.

MR. HILL:

I don't believe that’s correct.

I’m not

sure, though, that that — I wouldn't the case would in any
wise depend on the accuracy of —
Q

Well, I'm not sure of it, either.

MR. HILL:

I'm not sure, sir.

But it seems to me

that whether he had the petition in his hands in February or
March or April would be relatively immaterial, because he
cannot get anyone to sign that petition until after the
primary is over.

Unless someone wanted to say categorically,

ahead of time, "I’m not going to vote in the Democratic or
Republican primary, so I'll sign your petition."
But we do have a rule in our State that we think
is very legitimate and very necessary that does prevent those
who sign these supplemental petitions, or who sign the peti­
tion of an independent candidate, not to vote in the Democratic
Republican, La Raza, or any other party primary that we're

34

holding in our State.
Q

How many signatures, Mr. Attorney General, does

the independent candidate have to —
MR. HILL;

The same — one percent of the vote of

the gubernatorial candidates in the preceeding general elec­
tion.
Q

Weil, that is actiial — what offices —

MR. HILL:

But, there is a limitation on the district.

Like Mr. Hainswoz'th, I believe his was down to 500, maximum —
500 maximum —
Q

Is this to say —

MR. HILL:
Q

Vie don't impose that —

Is this to say it depends upon what office the

candidate's running for?
MR. HILL:
Q

If it's a state-wide office it's more —•

It's between two —

MR. HILL:

But the ones before this Court az’e all,

one for Congress and one for Representative, they both — we
put a 500, which is minimum.

If you're going to have a system

of elections and government in a State where you have any
manner or way to, not discourage the independent candidate nor
to discourage the minority party, but to have some stability •—
to have some ability not to have raiding, some ability not to
have candidates come into your primaries —■ whatever the
primary is — and try to vote for the weakest candidate to

35
hurt your party,, and all of the other reasons that the Courts
have approved in connection with anti-raiding provisions, or
provisions to show minimal support, so that you don’t have
total chaos, you don't have total voter confusion.

Why is

Texas here to defend a system with 500 vote — 500 signatures?
I'd be the last to want to just to defend it because it's a
Texas statute, but I do say candidly to the Court, this is,
this —* we have 500, in connection with independent candidates,
we have 22,000, but supplementary petitions — supplementary
petitions, in our State.

We have two minority parties that

that — they contribute that to our process.

Clearly, they

And that's why we have a constitutional mandate that

we're not to burden them, that we're not to deprive them of
their associational rights, we’re not to burden their free
speech, and we're to accord them equal protection.

But

nonetheless, the Courts recognise that we have some compelling
State interest, and when we show that there’s a necessity for
what we do, and that it's reasonable, and that it's not in­
vidiously discriminatory, and not intended to be — how can
one honestly say. ..

But those

But constitutional

issues can't be decided on that type of unsupported rhetoric.
We have dona nothing in our State to injure her party, nor
to injure other parties.

We don't meet in the Texas Legis­

lature just to revise laws for that purpose.

We changed the

laws in our State in 1973 solely because we were trying to
get in line with the United States Supreme Court decisions
written by the majority of the Justices before whom I am now
appearing and speaking on behalf of my State.
We wanted to comply with Bullock v« Carter.

That's

precisely why, Justice Bixrger, you told us in Bullock v.
Carter that you saw, when we suggested that if we went to a
State financing system in Texas we might run into some prob­
lems of equal protection.

And you said, in Bullock v. Carter,

pointing to Jenness — pointing to Jenness, which had the
cut-off line

at 20 percent for parties who "should take on

the burdens of primaries," and under 20 percent, those that
didn't.

So we changed our laws, and we said, "All right,

everyone that polls 20 percent can come in under State pri­
maries ."

was maintained.

And it

But now we’re faced with the very thing that

we were trying to avoid, and fallowing Bullock v. Carter, and
Jenness, to change to the 20 percent and allow those parties
to have State financing to supplement their filing fees.
We have a convention system, true.

Is Georgia to be

accorded constitutionality because she elects solely to follow
the petition system, which has five — ten — times the re­
quired number of people that must be mustered for gentlemen
like Mr. Hainsworth to gain the ballot, as opposed to the Texas
system which says simply, "Conduct conventions on election day."
You don’t have to have a great, big apparatus like was re­
quired in Ohio; you don't have to have primary elections; you
don't have to send delegates to a national convention, as they
did in Williams v. Rhoses.

All we ask you to do, or require

you to do, is simply to have conventions in counties and pre­
cincts where you think you can muster some support.
Q

But you've got to have — but, in any event,

you’ve either got to get to conventions or get signatures that
total 22,000 —
MR. HILL:

Yes, sir, Mr. Justice White.

And if

we're to have
Q

I just wondered — I just wanted to make sure.

MR. HILL:

And I honestly —• how can we say, under

38

constitutional principles that we've been dealing with in
Williams, and Jenness, and Rosario, of the majority opinions
in those cases, and the compelling State interest doctrine,
the necessity, that that — that we"re to second-guess that
kind of a system.

Why?

Twenty-two thousand signatures,

gotten together through convention process, or supplemented —
if you had a minimal — we ought to require some minimal degree
of support before people can —
Q

Yes.

But, now, how would you certify the names

of the people who attended your convention?
MR. HILL:

Oh, simply have their name and addresses.

They come in the door, they sign up and tell who they are,
and where they live —
Q

And do those have to be notarized?

all there was to it.

We have write-ins.

What’s wrong with our

election system?
Q

What about the absentee ballots?

MR. HILL;

Absentee balloting is a remedial piece

of legislation, a very great thing for this country, and
serves a very, very wonderful purpose.

But it’s never been

held by any court that that remedial legislation — which is,
frankly, intended for those who must have it, or should have
it — for reasons of frailty, or absence, or problems beyond
their control.

But we contemplate in this country, as I

understand our election proceedures, that people take the
time and trouble to go vote.

That’s not the purpose of ab­

sentee voting, is to say, "I want to go fishing."

And it's

never been thought nor held that absentee voting must be
opened up to everyone, under whatever circumstances they may
be operating at that particular time in their political de­
velopment.

It’s never been held not only improper, certainly,

never been raised —
Q

Do you think Texas could pass a law that absen­

tee ballots are — would be accepted, provided they are either
Democratic or Republican?
MR. HILL;

I don't believe, Mr. Chief Justice —

41
Q

It's not that wide open, is it?

MR. HILL:

I know it's easy to criticize, and it's

easy to make it
Q

No, I mean it's not as wide open — that, you

mean we have — there’s nothing we can say about absentee
ballots that is outside the jurisdiction of this Court?
MR. HILL:
Q

I don’t mean outside —

Surely you don't mean that?

MR. HILL:

— the jurisdiction of this Court.

1 say

it's outside the pale of the United States Constitution to
protect the rights of those to it.

You and I and others may

agree or disagree about what our law should be on absentee —
Q

Well, then, what we are restricted to the

Constitution, so you do say it's beyond our jurisdiction —
MR. HILL:

I say it's beyond the scope of over­

turning the lower Court's decision in this case.

There would

be no basis, in my humble judgement, for this Court to say,
because Texas has not seen fit to plant on its absentee
ballot in our State the names of every party, and that's what
it boils down to — what happens when you vote absentee in
Texas today is you go down to the county courthouse, and
you're either taken to a voting machine or a printed ballot,
and the people on the ballot are Democrats and Republicans.
It's not designed, though, as a discriminatory matter.
not done in our State for that reason.

It's

It's simply that the

42
absentee ballot, very frankly, Justice Marshall, it would be
obtained today by the Texas New Party in an absentee situation,
is not a great problem.

Now, there're some things that we

shouldn't have —
Q

Is not a great problem to whom?

MR. HILL:
them.

Well, sir, it's not a great problem to

Where is the hue and cry from the Texas New Party for

absentee voting?

Who are they going to vote absentee today?

Is this an imaginary problem, or are we to deal, hopefully,
with real problems?
Now you reach a point, yes — if La Raza has —■ La
Raza may have reached that point.

I don't foreclose, and I

don't foreclose a circumstance arising where another party
was sufficiently strong that a deprivation of absentee ballot­
ing really would dilute down — bear in mind what we're talking
about — their right to get on the ballot — that's all that's
involved in the absentee voting, as far as the minority parties
are concerned.

It doesn't have anything to do with who gets

MR. HILL:

Not at all.

You're not really worried about 'em, are you?

ME. HILL:

No, sir, not at all.

Well, yes, sir# I like to think that I

But my point is that the absentee balloting is not, in

my humble judgement, first, a severe matter as far as numbers
are concerned? and, secondly, it has been held by the Courts
that it does not rise to the dignity that would overthrow an
election lav? or an election process, from a constitutional
standpoint.
If I might very quickly just look over the — well,
did we discuss the 5 percent county bonus that was — That is
just simply a manner and way in which, under our State Finan­
cing Law, we compensate the chairmen and staff of those who
are charged with the responsibility of conducting the election.
Itss not a bonus; it's just a method that we have selected to
accomplish that purpose.

So we do respectfully submit that

pursuant to the law pronounced by this Court in Williams v.
Rhodes, respecting at all times the right of the vote, the
right of the ballot to all citizens, respecting the equal pro­
tection requirements of that case, knowing that you require us
to show a compelling State interest and a necessity for the
type of regulations that we have, we do submit that we have
here a reasonable system, and one that has not been, and is not
invidiously discriminatory7, and one which has served, not

44
hindered, the growth of minority parties in our State, and
one which we feel is reasonably related to the State princi­
ples that we feel, under the law, we have a right to carry
out; that is, to further the notion of requiring, before you
are on the ballot, that you have a minimal degree of support,
and that you not raid other parties to obtain that support.
That, in other words, it’s not wrong to require a different
type of support for a candidate, or for a party, so that he
can have some semblance of a reasonable base to enter the
process, and appear on the ballot.

I think if you did not

have at least those minimal requirements you would have,
simply,

a confused and cluttered, chaotic situation.
Q

Mr. Hill, with respect to the absentee balloting

provision, we"re talking now about absentee ballots in the
primary election —
MR. HILL:
Q

Absolutely.

Anybody, I take it, is entitled to get an ab­

sentee ballot in the general —
MR. HILL:
clear.

Absolutely.

I hope I had made that

Now, that's when I referred — now, I'm afraid I was,

perhaps — I apologize greatly if I offended you, Justice
Marshall; I simply meant to state that the use of absentee
voting in the primary posture, when these other parties are
having conventions — they're not having primaries — does
not really get at the same problem you would be getting at

45

as if after they've gained ballot status through that conven­

That’s what you said —

MR. HILL:

Thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Attorney

General.
Mr. Hainsworth?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. HAINSWORTH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HAINSWORTH:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

there are a few points that I would like

to attempt to call to the attention of the Court,
One, after the case of Bullock v. Carter the party
primary filing fees were lowered in the case of State Repre­
sentative to the sum of $200.

The ultimate nominating peti­

tion provided that 2 percent of the vote cast for Governor
of the party in the last preceeding general election would
be sufficient in that area for the person to get on the party
primary ballot.

.And it should be at least 25 signatures, but

not to exceed 300.

I would like to make this distinction that

the 5 percent of the persons who voted in the area applies in
the Article 13.50 to all who cast a vote for Governor in the
last preceeding general election.

You may have a Democratic

46
and Republican running some other candidate under another
name, but you add all of those in together to get the 5 per­
cent in that particular area or district.
Whereas, the party primary nominee only has to get
5 percent of the — no, not 5 percent, only 2 percent of the
total number of votes cast for the Governor of his party.
So it may be down to 25, and it may be up, but it's not to
exceed 300.

And if the minor major party — like the Repub­

lican Party in Texas — if their candidate for Governor in
this district only gets 1,000 votes, 2 percent of that would
be about 20, and that would put him in the primary.
Now, with respect to notarization.

Under the old

law, with respect to party primary candidates, there was
nothing said in it about notarization.

So I presume that

they could have their petitions signed without having them
notarized.

It also provided that they had 90 days to get

those signatures —■ the party primary candidate.

But the

independent candidate, under Article 13.50, only has 30 days.
Now, the Honorable Attorney General, Mr. Hill, was
talking about both minor party — minor parties — and inde­
pendent candidates.
those two.

And there is some distinction between

Now, an independent candidate, in order to get

on the ballot, has to have 5 percent of the votes cast in
that area, or district, for that particular office; whereas,
the minor party candidate only has to get one percent — only

47
one percenti, of the votes cast either for the general — for
Governor throughout the State, or for —- wherever.

But he only

has to get one percent.
Now, if the independent candidate only had to get
one percent, that would be just fine.

But they have made it

5 percent, and when you add in 30 days limitation, and notari­
zation, I submit to the Court that there is too large a burden
placed upon the independent candidates.
Q

I thought he only had to get 500.

MR. HAINSWORTH:

The independent candidate has to

get 500, yes, sir.
Q

You said 5 percent.

MR. HAINSWORTH:

Well, now, it's like this.

You're

supposed to get either 5 percent —
Q

— or 500.

MR. HAINSWORTH:
Q

I beg your pardon, sir?

You never have to get more than 500.

MR. HAINSWORTH:
Q

And you can take the rest —-

So nobody has to get more than 500.

MR. HAINSWORTH:
Q

Or 500.

You never have to get more than 500.

So —

MR. HAINSWORTH:

However, the 5 percent may be more

them 500.
Q
in every case

Yes.

So you really don’t have to get 5 percent,

48

MR. HAINSWORTH:

Not in every case.

Yes, sir.

Equal protection of the law for independent candi­
dates, I respectfully submit to the Court, that the opinion
of the 3-Judge District Court in Hainsworth v. Bullock, and
Hainsworth v. White, before this Court, be reversed on the
grounds that the requirements under Article 13.50 are so
strict and burdensome that there is violation of the Four­
teenth Amendment, Section One, of the United States Consti­
tution of equal protection of the law; and that there is no
compelling State interest involved in this situation, or in
this case, which requires the State of Texas to have this
particular Article 13.50, with respect to an independent can­
didate getting on the ballot.

Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Thank you, Mrs. Svanas.

Thank you, Mr. Hainsworth.

Thank you, Mr. Attorney General.
