ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEO J. CONWAY, ESQ'.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. CONWAY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may It please

the Court:
Vie seek the review of the decision of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which
affirmed the judgment of the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, issuing
a writ of habeas corpus effecting Respondent’s release from
the custody of the Ohio authorities pursuant to his having
been convicted of the crime of murder in the first degree.
The basis for the finding, that even'.though the
arresting officers had reasonable grounds, to believe that the
• •V

.

’

v

evidence seized was and had,v in fact, been used. iM the
commission of the crime itself, that they had had an ample
opportunity to procure a warrant for the seizure of this
automobile and, therefore, that the seizure of the automobile
was per se unreasonable.

I should like, if I may, to describe the conditions
leading up to the seizure of the automobile.
On July 19, 1967, a man by the name of Paul

Radcliff , who was a Certified Public Accountant, was brutally
murdered.

Nov/, prior to his murder, he had been requested over

the telephone to come to the City of Delaware, Ohio to seek
or to give an interview pursuant to his future employment as
a CPA for this company.
At that same time, this anonymous caller, who
described himself as being an officer of the IBEX Company,
asked Mr. Radcliff if he would stop on the way in at a
factory building which had been abandoned to look over the
factoi’y building to determine whether the company might use
it in future expansion.
As

he got out of his automobile at approximately

quarter to 9:00 on the morning of July 19th, he was greeted
by three blasts from the shotgun which immediately took his
life.

His body then .was dragged over an embankment.

His

car was shoved over an embankment and later on, because of the
fortunate and inadvertent, really, inspection of the river
by a game warden, the car was found.

The police were

informed and after the police had been informed, they went
out and found the body.
No’w, immediately, of course, an investigation took
place and a neighbor across the street had heard three shots
but had thought nothing about it because in this area on
numerous© occasions, the kids were hunting, shooting off guns
and it was rather common.

But shortly afterwards, she heard

the screech of times and gravel being thrown up on the fenders
or underneath the fenders of the car and she went to the front
door and she did, she observed a gold automobile which she
describes as a 1967 or 1968 Oldsmobile accelerating towards
Columbus.
Now, in the investigation that followed, the
Delaware County authorities discovered that Arthur-Ben Lewis,
the Respondent herein, owned such an automobile.

They also

learned that, in the process of their investigation, that he
had looked at this building himself and was thoroughly
familiar with it because he thought he might procure this
building for5 the purpose of setting up a club.
They also knew that he went by this building
every day of his summer occupancy practically because he
had two swimming pools in the near vicinity.
They then found out that he had also been
attempting to sell his

one of his businesses — of which

he had many, to some people who had employed Radcliff as an
auditor to inspect the books of the company to determine
whether, in fact, the company was sound.
A telephone call made to these people a half-hour
after the murder took place, after the shots had been fired
which we assume was the time that the murder took place, the
lady whose husband was buying the business received the call
again, from an individual saying that he was Paul Radcliff,

6
that he had examined the books of the company, that he was
going out of town for a few days and. that the company was
very sound and he recommended that the purchase go through.
Now, based upon all of these — all of this
knowledge on the part of the officers, an arrest warrant
was procured for his arrest on the 20th of October, 1967.
It goes without saying that at the time, although
had they known that they were going to arrest him on this
particular day, that it may have been said that they could
have gotten a. search warrant but — for the automobile, which
they knew, by that time they had — it had been used or they
had every reason to believe it had-been used in pushing his
car over the embankment and which had. been damaged on the
front end because there were paint, yellow or gold paint
flecks on the back of the car that had been pushed over the
embankment.
QUESTION:

Who issued, the arrest, warrant,

Mr. Conway?
ME. CONWAY:

The arrest warrant was issued, by the

justice in Delaware County, Ohio wherein the crime was
committed.
QUESTION:

And that was serveable anywhere in

the state, wasn't it?
MR. CONWAY:

That1s right.

The arrest warrant

was serveable anywhere in the State of Ohio.

But —

QUESTION:

The same judge could have issued the

MR. CONWAY:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?
The same judge had. authority to issue

a search warrant?
MR. CONWAY:

The same judge had authority to

issue a search warrant, your Honor, but only for those things
that they wanted to search in the County of Delaware.
In other words, in Ohio, a search warrant only
may be served in the county wherein it was issued.
QUESTION:

It was served, you say, by what, now

a common pleas judge?
The warrant was not issued by a --MR. CONWAY:

where the car ultimately was seised.

least some of the authorities, already knew that there was

And what county was that?

QUESTION:

Is there any reason why at the same

time they went to a municipal judge to get the arrest
warrant in Delaware they did not go to a municipal judge in

Franklin to get a search warrant?
MR. CONWAY:

Yes, there is, your Honor, because

they didn’t know where the automobile was.
Nov/,

in the State of Ohio, and I think this is

generally true — as a matter of fact, it is required by the
Constitution.
QUESTION:

Well, when did they find out where the

automobile was?
FIR. CONWAY:

but it was on the late afternoon of the 20th day of October.

MR. CONWAY:

And how did they find out?
Well, at the time that he was

arrested, Mr. Lewis took a ticket out of his pocket.

Now,

there is some argument as to exactly what happened, but ■—
QUESTION:
MR. CONWAY:
QUESTION:
MR., CONWAY:

A parking ticket?
A parking ticket.
For a parking lot?
That is right, your Honor.

And the parking lot was two doors from the office

10
of the Attorney General wherein the arrest was made and he
said"Here is my parking ticket."
Nov;, there is really no substantial difference
as to the discovery of parking tickets because at the time he
pulled this out, he says that he gave it to his lawyer and
says, "You take my car and take it to ray family."
The officers say that he said, "Here, here is the
ticket and you take my car and take care of it."
This is one of the debatable things and — but the
significant part is that they did not know where the auto­
mobile was until they saw the parking ticket and until he,
himself, indicated the location.
QUESTION:

Is there any reason once they got the

parking ticket, whatever version is the correct one, once
they discovered where the automobile was, any reason they
didn't then go to a municipal judge in Jackson County and get
a search warrant?
MR. CONWAY:
reason, your Honor.

1 think there was a very good

As a matter of fact, they knew that

Mr. Lewis had had the front end of his car fixed, attempting
to conceal the fact that it was involved in a crime.

They

also knew, and he said, l!I want this car taken to my family."
Nov;, if they had not seized it right then and it
had been, turned over to his family, they probably would have
never seen the automobile again, which they definitely wanted

11
very badly as evidence in the murder trial.
QUESTION:

How far was the judge from the

Attorney General’s office?

Mr. Chief Justice, that had they put a policeman on the car
at that time in order to get seizure, that they, in effect,
would have been seising it right then.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

after lunch.

from 12:00 o’clock noon to 1:01 o’clock p.m.]
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may continue,

Mr. Conway.
MR. CONWAY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Just prior to the break, I was was asked a
question, I believe, who could have driven the car away when
t

the keys were in the posssesslon of the officers?
Of course, there are more than one set of keys
to many cars and It is our contention that the family of
the individual, Mr. Lewis could have as easily gone in and
taken the keys.

They would have had keys.

They could have

driven the car away as well by using those keys as the keys
that the police may have had.
QUESTION:
MR. CONWAY:

Without the parking ticket?
Not, without the parking ticket.

But I am assuming, of course, that the keys and the parking
ticket went together, regardless.
QUESTION:
parking ticket.

I thought you said the police had the

MR. CONWAY:
ticket.

The police did have the parking

Of course, that is our point, Mr. Justice Marshall,

that the police having had the parking ticket placed them, in
the same position as to take the car — as it would had they
put an officer on the car to guard it.
As an example, I think that the court of appeals
and the district court in this case based their entire
decision on the Coolidge case that was decided by this
Court and which they indicated was on all fours with Coolidge,
but as a matter of fact, there was no similarity between
the facts in this case and Co'olidge, except that they
indicated that they knew that they wanted •—- the officers
in this case wanted the car prior to the time the arrest
was made, the same as that in Coolidge but the difference
was in Coolidge and in this case, that in Coolidge, the
officers knew where the car was.

They knew its description.

All they had to do, as the Court indicated, was to get a
valid search warrant to go get the car.
In our case, the officers, at the time that they
made the arrest, did not know where the car was and the only
way that they could have gotten a search warrant and seized
the car prior thereto, would have, perhaps, thwarted their
entire investigation and this Court definitely has
indicated that that was not necessary in the Hoffa case, in
Hoffa v. United States.

The fact of the matter is that- at

15
the time that,the first time that the police knew where the
car was, was right when the arrest took place or immediately
thereafter.
how, again, stressing the Ohio law, in Ohio,
there is no search warrant provided for an automobile,

A

search warrant may only be issued for a home or place and an
automobile, I think, would fit under the term "effects," as
used in the Constitution and if they want an effect, they
want to seise or search an effect, they must, with
specificity, indicate where that effect is before they can
get a search warrant to search for it and as a matter of fact,
since this is not a part of the record, but that is the way
it is done today, even though the police have searched, have
seized an automobile in Columbus, Ohio and it is in the
police pound, they get a search warrant, actually, to search
it and the place, of course, the location, is the police
pound.
So they, in effect, are serving the search vmrrant
upon themselves.
The other aspect, of course, of Coolidge that the
Court indicated or disagreed with insofar as argument was
concerned, is that there was no exigency and, of course, that
gets us back

to the point that anybody in the family could

have removed the automobile and hence, deprive the state of
the use of that automobile as evidence.

16
Now, we attempted, in the court below, to
indicate or to base this search upon a valid arrest.

There

isn't any question in this case as to the validity of the
arrest.

The district judge, as a matter of fact, made a

footnote indicating that the arrest warrant was not good in
that it did not follow the federal requirements for arrest
warrants.

But certainly, in the State of Ohio, that arrest

w&rrant was perfectly valid and in the State of Ohio, all the
arresting officer must do, or the man making the affidavit for
the search warrant, is to indicate that AB killed

CD and that

he has reasonable grounds to believe that he did and that is
exactly what the search warrant provided.

It is not

required under Ohio law that he indicate how and where and
who said and whathaveyou, like, as a matter of fact, is
required in a search warrant.
Now, at the time that Mr. Lewis, having been
arrested, pulled the parking ticket out of his pocket and
said, "This is the parking ticket to my car," the police
certainly had a right, in our opinion, to seize that parking
ticket because they knew it was a parking ticket for the
vehicle that they wanted as an Instrumentality or as evidence
in the crime and, therefore, they, having had taken this
parking ticket validly, they had a right, a continuing right,
to exercise jurisdiction over the automobile.
Incidently, this v/as

this automobile was

17
parked on a private parking lot and there was no reason that
once tnat the police knew where the automobile was, that they
could have gone next door and taken some paint off of the
automobile in itself.

It was in a public place.

It was in

plain view.
QUESTION:

Was the lot open to the public?

Was it

a typical parking lot you just drive into and pay to park?
MR. CONWAY:
QUESTION:

That's right, your Honor.
Would that not have been equivalent to

a seizure if they had taken part of the car?
MR. CONWAY:
QUESTION:

I do not believe so, your Honor.
Even a small part like the paint.

MR. CONWAY:

They would have been seizing some­

thing in plain view, is our position.

Now, the court below

disagreed with that theory because they said that they had to
go down a couple of layers in order to do the real comparison,
which I.agree with.

I mean, they did have to go below the

seeable part of the paint on the car in order to make the
chemical analysis to determine whether or not the same paint
or the same type of paint was comparable to the other but,
nevertheless, I believe that, assuming for the sake of
argument that they had marred the car, they might have
actually been liable in the court action for the scratching
of the automobile but that did not in any way prevent them
from taking what they believed to be valid evidence to use in

18
the murder itself.
When tiie motion to suppress was filed in this
ease, in the trial court, the only precedent that the trial
court had at that time, recent precedent, was, of course.
Cooper and Preston and the Preston case, certainly, was very
dissimilar to the case in our situation for the simple reason
that this Court held in Preston that the reason for which the
car was seized had nothing whatsoever to do with the crime
for which the defendant had been arrested but, certainly, in
this case, there was every reason to believe that this was
evidence of the crime itself and the police wanted it.
Wow, the trial judge relied strictly on Cooper in
making its determination on the motion to suppress that the
car was validly seized.

The Court said —- in Cooper, the

Supreme Court observed that the car in that case was seized
and. impounded because of and in connection with the crime for
which Cooper was arrested.
In this case, the car was seized, impounded and
searched because of the crime for which the defendant was
arrested and then the Court went on to say that it found that,
and, incidently, the Court in that case, did hold that they
believed that the seizure of the parking ticket was, in effect,
constructive seizure of the automobile, but the Court said
further that this, in its opinion, rendered the seizure to
have been, in all respects, reasonable.

19
The Supreme Court of Ohio, likewise, found the
search to be reasonable and I believe by the time it got to
the Supreme Court of Ohio, this Court had decided Chambers
v. Maroney, which gave impetus, I believe, to the decision
in Cooper.
Therefore, it was held that if these officers
had a right to take that car initially as evidence in the
crime on the parking lot, that they had a right, therefore,
to take it to the police impounding area and do such searches
as necessary.
Wow, at no time did they ever enter the inside
of the car for any evidence that was subsequently disposed
of in this case.
I should like to reserve a few minutes for
rebuttal.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. 'Frey.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L, FREY s ESQ..
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. FREY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the Fourth
Amendment was violated by the warrantless seizure of
Respondent’s car and the removal of a small paint sample
from it, which was subsequently introduced in evidence
against him at his murder trial.
Now, we have briefed this case and are arguing
this case on the premise that there was, indeed, opportunity
fox’ the police to get a warrant and that there was no
emergency or other justification for their not doing it in
this case.
We are advancing the contention that they were
not required to get a warrant to do what they did in this
case.
Now, we are dealing here, as in almost every case
in which the issues focuses, on the warrant requirement with
police action that can’t be deemed unreasonable in the normal
sense of the word since, if it were unreasonable in that
sense, no warrant could issue to authorize the action that
they did.
So, was it

unreasonable here for the Ohio law

enforcement officers, knowing the facts that my colleague

21

has just recited to you, to believe that Respondent’s
automobile should be seised and examined for evidence that
they had every expectation of finding and that would be
highly probative at his anticipated murder trial?

Obviously

not.
Similarly, was it unreasonable of them to remove
a paint sample from Respondent's car to compare it with the
foreign paint found on the car of the deceased?

Surely, a

failure to pursue such a line of inquiry would have been not
just unreasonable, but grounds for dismissal for gross
incompetence.
So why, since Respondent was constitutionally
protected only from an unreasonable search or seizure, are
we here today?
It is because this Court has determined that in
many circumstances the kind of reasonableness that I have
been talking about is not enough, that there is an over­
riding policy favoring antecedent judicial determinations of
reasonableness in the issuance of warrants authorizing
searches and seizures before certain kinds of police in­
trusions into the affairs of a citizen will be countenanced.
Wow, in many cases this policy has been expressed
in terms of a per se rule of presumptive

unreasonableness

of warrantless seizures accompanied, however, by a collection
of exceptions, each of which has its own rationale but which,

22
taken togethers leave a substantial area of uncertainty today,
185 years after the adoption of the Fourth Amendment about
when a warrant is required.
We suggest that there is a sound, underlying
rationale that runs through the Court's efforts in this area
but that meaningful understanding of the unifying principle
is beclouded by thinking in terms of a per se warrant
requirement with a, what I might call a "Procrustean Hotel"
of exceptions.
This approach tends to lead the Court into the
inquiry whether there was a reasonable opportunity to get a
warrant, rather than whether the search should beconsidered
reasonable, although, as the Court stated in Cooper against
California, the latter is the constitutionally relevant
standard.
Nov;, to identify this unifying rationale, we must
ask why would the Court ever call a concededly reasonable
■search unreasonable because of the absence of a warrant?
It can only be because there are some circumstances
in which it is simply not tolerable for the police to act
without a prior evaluation of their reasons- by a neutral and
detached magistrate.
So we urge the Court today to adopt a functional
whi ch
analysis of the warrant requirement. The per se rule/says
that a search is unreasonable without a warrant, makes sense

when we are talking about searches of houses, as was
eloquently stated in the Johnson and the McDonald cases.

It

makes sense when we are talking about intercepting conver­
sation or intercepting mail, where substantial privacy
expectations are being defeated.
This point was emphasized in Katz.

Does it make

sense, however, in the case of the automobile?
Mow, I suggest that it is more than just a
freakish coincidence that this Court has never, insofar as I
am aware, struck down a warrantless, probable cause search of
an automobile with the sole exception of the Coolidge case
and in Coolidge, there was a critical extra ingredient, the
intrusion onto Mr. Coolidge's private property.
Nov;, the reason for this goes back to the real
values that underlie the Fourth Amendment protections which
were stated by Justice Brennan in Warden against'Hayden,
page 304 of 387 U.S. he said, "The premise that property
interests control the right of the Government to search and
seize has been discredited.

We recognize that the principle

object of the Fourth Amendment is the protection of privacy
rather than property arid have increasingly discarded
fictional and procedural barriers rested on property
considerations."
Accordingly, we submit that whether a search or
seizure without a warrant should be held per se unreasonable,

24
depends on a determination of whether the privacy interests
at stake are of such magnitude that the interposition of a
neutral and detached magistrate should be required to make
the probable cause determination.
Now, in approaching this analysis, I think the
principle distinction that we would draw is the distinction
between searches and seizures.

While, like the Admiral in

H.M.S. Pinafore, I am not sure that I am prepared to say
never, I find it hard to imagine a situation in which a
seizure, as such, should require a warrant if it is otherwise
reasonable as distinct from a search because when we are
■»

talking about a seizure, we are talking about an invasion of
the individual’s property interests only.
A search, on the other hand, does involve, almost
by definition, some kind of intrusion into its privacy
interests.
In the area of searches, therefore, I think the
Court ought to we1gh what privacy interests are at stake, are
these privacy interests such that, in determining whether the
search was reasonable under the First Clause of the Fourth
Amendment, the Court will impose the warrant requirement.
Now, the per se approach, I think, leads to some QUESTION:

Mr. Frey?

MR. FREY:

Yes?

QUESTION:

You are talking in terms of privacy,

but the Court, in Cox, did say that the Fourth Amendment
can’t be translated into a general constitutional right to
privacy, didn't it?
MR. FREY:

Well, but it recognized also in Katz

that property interests, too, are protected by the Fourth
Amendment.

I am not -— my argument is really addressed to

the case as here, where the infringement is on property
interests of the citizen.

My suggestion is that, 'while

those property interests are protected by the Fourth
Amendment, they are protected by the reasonableness require­
ment and they ought not —- they don’t need the additional
protection of the per se warrant rule which this Court has
spoken about but has frequently declined to apply in cases
where it clearly seemed improper to deem a search unreason­
able because there was no warrant.
QUESTION:

I understood your privacy argument

to be directed to distinguishing this case from Coolidge,
where, in order to take the car in the Coolidge case, they
had to invade, at least, the privacy of a man’s home and
dwelling and garage and here it was a public parking lot and
no privacy, no expectation of that kind of privacy.

MR. FREY:

That is true, although I think our

argument — that consideration is a consideration which
distinguishes Coolidge from this case in two respects; in
Coolidge, they intruded onto a private property and in

26
Coolldge they went Into the body of his car to remove dust
and sweepings from the floor of the car.
What I arn suggesting, however, is a general
approach to this problem which has come up so many times and
where it is difficult to perceive a unifying thread of
analysis and I am suggesting that what really motivates the
court ordinarily is that they see, in some instances, the
kind of intrusion into privacy as in Katz, which the court
is simply not prepared to allow the police to do, just on the
basis of their own reasons for doing so, even if those
reasons are subsequently found to have been sufficient.
Wow, in the

in our brief we discuss the White

case, which the Sixth Circuit decided some months after
they decided Cardwell.

Mow, in the White case, the

Defendant had been arrested for passing counterfeit currency
and they located his car which presumably — if, in fact, the
reasons that they had to believe that he had used it to
transport counterfeit currency were valid, would be subject
to forfeiture.
They went into the glove compartment of his car
and they found their other conterfeit currency which was
introduced in evidence against him at his trial.
Wow, the Court of Appeals, instead of looking at
what it was that the police were doing and looking at what
the privacy interests of the citizen were that were at stake.

27
as they did not do in the Cardwell case, either, the Court of
Appeals said, well, they went in for pome purpose other than
looking for evidence of a crime, so it is all right for him
to do the very same act.
Nov;, I would suggest that, for instance, in
Cady against Dombrowskl, where a somewhat similar rationale
was utilised., that had they known that the gun, or believed
reasonably that the gun was used in a murder, that should not
detract from the right which this Court recognised them to
have to go into the car without a warrant in order to seise
the gun.

If it does, I think it inverts the -— what seems to

me to make sense or to be reasonable in the sense that the
term was used in the Fourth Amendment.
Now, I’d like to address a comment briefly to the
Almeida-Sanchez case and to Justice Powell’s concurring
opinion in that case because there there was a question of
whether a search, on less than probable cause might be deemed
nevertheless reasonable and I think there it v?as the absence
of probable cause which made it necessary to seek a warrant
as a means, in effect, of reinforcing a reasonableness in the
normal, ordinary sense of the word for the police to make
this intrusion on citizens driving along the road near the
border.
Had there been probable cause, I don’t think the
per se warrant requirement would have been necessary or

26
properly applicable.
Now, we also mention in our brief some of the
historical factors that are in the background and I think
these are some of the same fa-ctors that Justice Douglas
discussed in his dissenting opinion in Matlock., although we
read them to have a different impact on this case.
Now, we recognize the Court is not bound
strictly by the understanding of the framers in drafting the
Fourth Amendment.

In some sense, the Constitution is a

living instrument and we are not suggesting that it should
■ Jr--

be narrowly constrained to l8th century circumstances.
■p\

However, we think that it is clear that the
concern was with the kind, of invasion of privacy that is
entailed in going into a dwelling, that the general warrant
concern was with going; into the man's house and we think
that the statute of 1315, which was cited in the Carroll
case and which is one illustration of early congressional understanding of the restriction on searches and seizures,
is very significant.
This was the statute which permitted Customs
searches, not just at the border, but any place within the
Customs district and it made a distinction between going into
a house and; searching a vehicle or vessel or beast.
In the latter case, not only did it provide that
a search could be made on mere suspicion, as distinct from the

29
warrant requirement for searching in a house, but it had a
provisio which Chief Justice Taft did not quote in the
Carroll opinion, but which we think is significant.

It is

quoted at page 27 of our brief and it says, "Provided always
the necessity of a search warrant arising under this Act shall
in no case be considered as applicable to any carriage, wagon,
cart, sleigh, vessel, boat or other vehicle of whatever form
of construction employed as a medium of transportation or to
packages on any animal or animals or carried by man or on
foot. "
Nov/, that statute was signed into law by the
father of the Fourth Amendment, James Madison and I think it
sheds some significant light on the understanding of the
framers with regard to the Fourth Amendment.
So, to sum up, we suggest that in this case, the
seizure of the car and the removal of a piece of paint from
the car, constituted seizures and not searches and that the
Court should recognize, as we think sound analysis compels,
that a seizure does not ordinarily, barring some exceptional
circumstances not present here, have to require the antecedent
justification of a warrant in order to be reasonable but,
rather, its reasonableness can be assessed on the basis of
what the police officers knew, what justification they had
for going and doing

what they did.

And in this case, we

submit that they had every justification .

single word as to why there was, under the facts of this

31
case, a specific burden upon lav; enforcement, a specific risk
be be taken by the procuring of a warrant In this case and
they also do this, it seems to me, without stopping to
consider the potentiality for executive abuse that in
inherent in the positions which they urge.
Respondent, of course, approaches this case from
the perspective of the very fundamental nature of the Fourth
Amendment.
I would like, before I begin, to clear up, I
think, some factual difficulties that have arisen from oral
argument.

Mr. Conway, I think, has supplied some details of

the murder itself, which are at least speculative in the
record and I think that there are some other inaccuracies
that should be corrected.
First of all, it is claimed that the witness at
the — near the murder scene who saw the departing auto­
mobile, claimed it to have been a gold '6? or ’68 Oldsmobile,
In fact, she said that it was a tan or beige car, that it was
of a make similar to her own Corvair but she was not aware of
what specific brand of car it was.
Secondly, with regard to the phone call that was
received by the wife of the person who was purchasing the
business, Mr. Smith, who had hired the decedent, Mr. Radcliff,
to examine the books, the record of the case will disclose

32
that the caller, whoever that caller may have been, did not
specifically say, "I have examined the books of Graham's
Auto Parts,’’which was the name of the business that the
defendant was attempting to sell to Mr. Smith.

It merely

said, that witness at the trial, merely claimed that the
caller said !,I have examined the books and they are in A-l
shape."
Now, it is also a fact In the record that the
accountant was the general accountant for Mr. Smith, not
just the accountant for the specific purpose of this
particular transaction so I think that the state has
inferred more than it should from that telephone call.
One final matter.

It has been suggested that the

person searching the car on the day after it was seised did
not intrude upon the interior of that car.
In fact, he did.

He opened the trunk of that

car and looked in and observed a nearly new tire and he
testified about this at trial.
Now, the reason that that has not been
emphasized in this appeal, or throughout the course of this
case, is that there was other testimony concerning the tires,
whereas the only testimony concerning the paint came as a
result of the taking of the paint from the automobile at the
time of the search.
It seems to me that we have here, essentially,

33
two distinct characterizations of the case.

The State of

Ohio says that this was a case in v/hich almost all of the
traditional exceptions to the warrant requirement were present.
They claim consent.
incidency to the arrest.
urgency of circumstance

They claim that there was

They claim that there was an
that necessitated a warrantless

seizure .
The Solicitor General takes quite a different
view.

He says he explicitly denies that there were exigent

circumstances here and he tacitly seems to concede that there
was no consent and no incidency to the arrest.

But, he

argues, that one has less than a full-fledged Fourth
Amendment interest in his automobile and that the scraping
of the paint in this case was not a seizure as such.
With respect to probable cause, there seems
also to be a disagreement.

The Solicitor General asserts

unquestionably that there was probable cause, although he
does not explain this at any point.
The State of Ohio seems to be in doubt in its own
conclusion — page 35 of its brief — it states that "While
the authorities in our case had information relating to the
car prior to the seizure, there is no indication that such
information amounted to probable cause to obtain a warrant.
I propose to examine in turn, first, the more
traditional exceptions to the warrant requirement that are

34
raised primarily by the state, specifically, consent, search
incident and exigent circumstances and then move to what I
perceive to be the more novel exception which the state
indirectly, and the Solicitor General, more specifically,
has asked this Court to countenance.
With respect to the issue of consent in this
case, I would first point out to the Court that that issue
is, at best, clouded upon the record.

There are essentially

two versions of what happened on October the 10th, 1967,
which was the day when the Defendant was asked to come to
the office of the Attorney General.

He appeared,

he was

questioned throughout the day, despite the fact that the
officers already at that time had an arrest warrarit for first
degree murder for him.

A tape recording was made of that

interrogation session and I!ll refer to that later.
The Respondent says that at that time the —
that he attempted only to turn over the keys and the claim
check of his automobile to his attorney, Mr. Scott, and this
is verified by his two attorneys, Mr. Tingley, who is the
first attorney, and Mr. Scott as well.
Mr. Tingley testified in the motion to suppress
hearing prior to the trial and Mr. Scott testified in the
evidentiary hearing in the district court.
Now, the investigating officials here claim that
what happened was that the Defendant made a request that his

35
car be kept for "safekeeping” but Sergeant Laver,y himself
conceded that this request was made to"no one in particular.”
That may be found on page 58(a) of the Appendix and he seems —
that is, Sergeant Lavery seems also to be at least confused
as to when exactly this occurred.

At a pretrial motion to

suppress, he thought that it was probably before the
Defendant's counsel had arrived at the office of the
Attorney General.
Subsequently, at the evidentiary hearing, he
seemed to be sure that it was after Counsel had arrived.
Now, the district court examined, at some length,
I think, all of the facts surrounding this alleged consent
and determined that even if it took these facts in the light
most favorable to the state, which it was not required to do,
even under that construction, there was not sufficient consent
to allow the taking of the automobile here.
The state court did not find consent, either.
The trial court rested its decision oh a search
incident theory.
The Ohio Supreme Court went off on what could
only be described as an instrumentality of the crime theory,
interestingly enough, never even citing

Warden versus Hayden,

which had been decided some two years prior to that.
The burden of proving consent here'was clearly on
the state, as this Court has said repeatedly, and most

36
recently In the Schneckloth decision and in the Matlock
decision.
It seems to me that to imply a full waiver of
Fourth Amendment constitutional rights from what, at most,
could be characterized as an expression of concern about one’s
property, would be the ultimate paradox.

If It is a

desireable goal to foster citizen cooperation with law
investigation — and Mr. Lewis, In this case, was most
cooperative, it hardly seems to be in furtherance of that
goal to allow sweeping interpretations to be made of a
simple request of the nature of the one here.

much in the line that this Court justified Cooper.

I submit that this Is pure sophistry

that

consent to search is certainly no different than -consent to
take into custody.
Now, with respect to the incidence to arrest, the
Petitioner here proposes a nexus between the arrest and car
seizure based, not upon the physical proximity of the
■-k

'

Defendant and his automobile, but rather upon his possession
at the moment of arrest, of a parking lot claim check for the
car and, perhaps, the keys.

I should point out that there Is

did.

Mr. Lewis says that he

Other witnesses said that only the claim check was,

apparently, turned over and it may have been a parking lot
where the keys were kept at the parking lot.
QUESTION:

Would it make any difference to our

questions here, do you think?
MR. CAMPBELL:

None, your Honor, from ray point

of view.
In effect, I think the Petitioner is urging a
doctrine of constructive possession whereby what one has on
his possession is a part of or a means of access to some
other object, will allow the state, then, to seize that other
object no matter where it may be.
I believe this to be an absurd extension of the
search incidency doctrine and that it is founded upon no
prior case law.

It would seem to me that, as the district

court held, that Incidency in this case must be judged upon
pre-Shimmel standards, that Rabinoid-tz is probably the
controlling case, but even in Rabinowitz, the Court held
that — held only that a tiny office in which the defendant
was arrested and which was under his immediate and complete
control, would be searched.
The Preston case, which, again, was decided
before the facts of this case occurred, involved an

39
automobile on the street and in that case the Court said that
once an accused is under arrest and in custody, then a search
made at another place without a warrant is simply not incident
to the arrest.
QUESTION:

Mr. Campbell, how about the — maybe

there have been cases of this kind,

I don't have any in

mind, let's assume a constitutionally valid arrest and a —
therefore, if a search incident thereto was a constitutionally
valid search, assume further that in the process of that
search, there was found in the pocket of the arrestee, a key
with a number on it to a locker down in the Union Station.
Do the police have to get a search warrant to search the
locker or may they simply use the key and go down to the Union
Station and open up the locker?

Are there any cabes of that

kind?
MR. CAMPBELL:

I am not aware of any,

your

Honor.
QUESTION:

I am not, either.

MR. CAMPBELL:

I believe that that case would be

precisely the same as this case.
QUESTION:

It would be very close, analytically,

wouldn't it?
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

I would think so.

And why, if the police had the key,

perfectly lawfully, as by the hypothesis of my hypothetical

question, they do, why oan't they simply use the key?
MR. CAMPBELL:

Because the key does not subsume

the identity of the object to which it admits one.
I might have, in my possession, the combination
to a safe.

I do not believe that that means that that safe,

if it can be located, can be opened merely because I have a
list of numbers in my pocket.

There is nothing about the

key in the example that you pose that takes over the
identity of the object that is later searched and seized.
QUESTION:

Let me give you a slight variation

of Justice Stewart’s hypothetical.

Instead of a key to a

locker at a train station or an airport or some such place,

they found a pawnshop ticket dated two days before the
time of the interview and the pawnshop ticket showed that a
pistol had been pawned and the police were involved with
trying to check out pistols and ballistics tests.

Do you

think the police with that pawnshop ticket could go to the
pawnshop without a warrant, or would they have to have a
warrant to go and get that gun to test it for ballistics?
MR, CAMPBELL:

I believe that they would have to

have a warrant, your Honor, under the same rationale.
QUESTION:

You have really got to take that

position or abandon your own, don't you?
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And I do take that position.

Well, I take It if you didn’t take

that positions you’d have some difficulty distinguishing, in
this very case, if he had a key ring and on that ring were not
only the keys to the car, but the keys to his house, that if
they can use the key to the car, I take it, that if you
agreed to that, you would have also to agree — would you? —
that they could also use the key to the house?
'

MR. CAMPBELL:

I would think that if the Court

were to hold that the seizure of the car was tantamount of
the seizure of the car itself, then the logical extension of
that would be that the seizure of the house key was, indeed,
the seizure of the house.
QUESTION:

The Court has made some distinctions

between automobiles and homes, has it not?
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

But not between keys.

MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

It has, your Honor.

No.

Mr. Campbell, was I

to understand

the position — if he had driven that car and left it outside
the Attorney General’s office, parked in the lot, could the
state have chipped a piece of that paint off and tested it?
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

At the parking lot, your Honor?

No, sir, in the street, right In front

of the Attorney General’s office.
MR. CAMPBELL:

Your Honor, I would make no

distinction in this case between the parking on a commercial

42
parking lot and the parking in any area that is legally
designated for the parking of an automobile.

I don't think

that this case turns upon the private nature of the parking
lot.
QUESTION:

Well, the private nature of the car?

MR. CAMPBELL:

Yes, your Honor, as long as that

car —
QUESTION:

But this was the bumper.

They didn't go — assuming they didn't go in the
car at all — assuming they didn't have a key, all they
knew was, this was the car and they wanted to get a piece
of that paint off of the front of it so they knocked a piece
of the paint off.

What's wrong with that?

MR. CAMPBELL:

The thing that is wrong with that,

your Honor, is that, in my view, it is a seizure and as such,
it should have been justified by a warrant if, indeed, there
was time to get a warrant.
QUESTION:

Well, that would go for things in

plain view.

There is at the point after the

Once the paint Is seized, it is then examined and

that becomes the search.
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

MR. CAMPBELL:

I do not believe that any of the

cases cited by the Petitioner are helpful here.
Chambers versus Moroni merely said that where the

antecedent seizure at the site of the arrest would validate
a search, it is not unreasonable to move the car to a safe
place.

But here, unlike Chambers, we did not have a vehicle

stopped on the open road.

We had no need to divert manpower

from the arrest function to the search function and here the
search, in any event, was not completed as was the search in
Chambers versus Moroni as soon as it was reasonably practical.
Neither are the Robinson and Gustafson cases
recently decided by this Court helpful here because in those
cases, the Court dealt with a very direct, physical
relationship between the one arrested and the object on his
person.
The Defendant in this case was at some
considerable distance from his car at the time of arrest.
He had been out of his car for at least seven hours by the
time of the arrest.

He had no means of getting to it and

during the day he was held in close confinement.
QUESTION:

After they got the keys and the

ticket to the parking lot, so that they — the police — had
access, they had then placed four policemen over on the
parking lot with orders to the parking lot attendant not to
permit anyone to take that car away and informing the
attendant that they were there to enforce that

direction,

then, meanwhile, had proceded to try to get a warrant.

Would

you think a seizure would have occurred when they put the

45
guard on the car?
MR. CAMPBELL:

Y.our Honor, first let me say that I

do not believe that was required in this case, but if it had
been, I do not believe that that would have constituted a
full seizure of the car.

I realize that there is a problem

there and it is a problem which the Court
Chambers versus Moroni.

wrestled with in

But it seems to me that the Court

should examine, perhaps, the possibility that that lesser
intrusion may solve some very difficult search problems in
this area.

I am aware that guard-posting is a theory that

this Court has not generally countenanced, although I think
recently, in the Dombrowskl — Cady versus Dombrowski case,
there was some suggestion that perhaps what might be
reasonable in a metropolitan jurisdiction where the magistrate
is readily available and there are other police officers on
the scene, might not be reasonable in a rural setting.
Here, I think we had

a very good case for guard

posting, if it were necessary, but as I say, it was not
necessary in this case.

The car was effectively mobilized.

This, I think, brings me to the —
QUESTION:

Well, to make that analysis, if I

may interrupt you a moment more, to make that analysis that
you have just made, you must confront the situation that
while the four policemen were standing guard on the car on
this restriction on its movement, some member of the family

46
or some other person came to the parking lot with a set of
keys, made claim to the car and sought to take it away, in
which case, obviously, the only purpose of having the police
guard there would be to prevent it.
With that confrontation, would you have a
seizure?
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor, I do not believe

If the police refused to let the

man's wife take the car away, let us say, or his lawyer?
MR. CAMPBELL:

I believe that it is possible to

distinguish that kind of temporary keeping for a reasonable
time while a warrant is sought from a seizure itself and I
believe that that kind of distinction might be helpful in
another case but I don’t believe that it was the reality of
this case and necessary here.
Petitioner has also claimed exigency of
circumstance or urgency here, necessitating the warrantless
seizure of this automobile.
three assumptions.

He rests his claim, I think, on

First of all, that the investigators did

not know where the car was.

Second, that confederates may

have absconded with the car and, finally, that probable
cause, If it existed at all, did not come into being until
the moment of arrest.
I’d like to take each one of these claims in
turn, if I may.

As to the whereabouts of the car, there is

47
absolutely no Indication in the record of this case that the
state did not know, at many times throughout this investi­
gation, where the car was.

In fact, they had very specific

knowledge about the car and had seen the car 78 days prior to
October the 10th.
They went to the Defendant's place of business.
They asked him where his car was.
He pointed it out to them.

It was in the parking lot.

They had an opportunity to note

its color and did, in fact, at that moment, begin to consider
him as a suspect because the color of the car matched the
one that they already were looking for.
Nov;, it seems to me that any doubt that the
Court might ha.ve about the specificity of the information
which the state had, by the time of October the 10th,
concerning the Defendant, his car, his home, his general
whereabouts, his businesses, his financial conditions, can
easily be dispelled by reading in the bill of exceptions the
transcription

of the interrogation section which took place

on October the 10th.
You will remember that I pointed out to the Court
that a tape recording was made, unknown to the Defendant, of
that interrogation session.

In the trial of the case, the

state attempted to first introduce this transcript into the
record.

This was objected to an the objection was sustained,

but then the trial judge allowed one of the state's witnesses,

48
Mr. Mann, fco read verbatim, into the record, the record of
that transcription of the Interrogation session and that
may be found on page 485 to 568 of the bill of exceptions.
Throughout that interrogation session, it is
clear that they had very specific knowledge about where
Mr. Lewis had been, who he had talked to, where his car was,
where his home was.
QUESTION:

Mr. Campbell, did Mr. Lewis live in

Franklin County?
MR. CAMPBELL:

Your Honor, it is not clear to

me whether his home was in Franklin County or Delaware
County.

He moved between the two frequently.
QUESTION:

MR. CAMPBELL:

If it does — I'm sorry, I don't

There Is talk In the record that I just told

you about as to where — there is a dialog between the
investigator and Mr. Lewis about his home, but I do not
believe it says where it is located.
QUESTION:

MR. CAMPBELL:

As an aside, I would point out to

the Court that the record of that interrogation is
instructive In its own right of why — as the Court has said
from time to time — zealous officers engaged in the
enterprise of ferreting out crime should not be allowed to
make ad hoc judgments about probable cause matters.

That was

*»9
a brutal interrogation session, not in a physical sense, but in
a. mental sense.

During the course of that interrogation, the

state repeatedly tried to get the Defendant to take a lie
detector test, although, at the very first instance, the
Defendant said that he would not even consider it without
talking to counsel.
At another place in the record of that interro­
gation, the interrogator attempts to help Mr. Lewis fabricate
a non-premeditated version of the facts of this killing in
order that he might not have to charge him with first degree
murder, not telling him that a first degree

murder warrant

was already in existence.
Now, with respect to the assumption that there
was a confederate in this crime, I should point out that there
is no testimony in the record that shows that there ever
was an accomplice, that the state ever believed that there
was an accomplice, that the Defendant's family was in any
way in league with the Defendant or would have removed the
car.

And as to Mr. Scott, the attorney, it seems to me that

once Mr. Scott turned over the claim check and perhaps the
keys to the police, that at that point in time he indicated
that he was not going to run a foot race with the Investigators
*

down to the car and he indicated that he was not going to
take the car.
He had no reason to believe that that car would

50

be fcaken out of the jurisdiction.
Now, the final assumption, I think, deals with
the question of probable cause.
Now, the state claims here that there may not
have been probable cause up to October the 10th to get a
search warrant for the automobile but then, it seems to claim
that somehow during the day, something developed that made
the probable cause argument and made the seizure possible but
the only fact that they suggested that has emerged during
that interrogation on October the 10th was the fact that the
Defendant gave a slightly different version of why he had
had his car repaired than he did when he had it repaired.
Now, there is no showing by the Petitioner why
this tiny fact, added to the others that the police had
somehow became the sine qua non of probable cause.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lewis was there in the office

of this special branch of the Attorney General's office
most of the day, wasn’t he?
MR. CAMPBELL:

He was there from 10:00 o'clock in

the morning until arrested at 5:30, with the exception of a
brief period when he left in the company of the officers and.
went to home and, with his own consent, they searched his
house.
QUESTION:

That was back in Delaitfare County,

over In Delaware County, which is a contiguous county?

51
MR. CAMPBELL:

Well, your Honor, 1 still don’t

know precisely whether the house was in Delaware County or
Franklin County.
QUESTION:

I see, but in any event, for six or

seven hours, is there anything that we know as to what
occurred during that long period of time?
MR. CAMPBELL:

Well, your Honor, other than the

transcript that we have of that interrogation, no.

Or

do I

understand your question correctly?
QUESTION:

Well, no\tf, what — do we have a

transcript of what occurred there for that whole period from
10:00 a.m. until 5:30 p.m., with the exception of the period
that he went back to his house?
MR. CAMPBELL:

We have what the state has claimed

to be an accurate transcript of the questioning that took
place , starting about 10:30 until about 3:00 o’clock in the
afternoon, when — or 3:30 in the afternoon when Mr. Lewis
finally said that "I want a lawyer,*’ and at that point,
questioning apparently was broken off and that is the end of
the transcript.
QUESTION:

And you are just starting to

tell us

now that nothing — nothing emerged from that interrogation
and that discussion that was any different with the
exception of one minor change in his version of something.
Is that it?

52
MR. CAMPBELL:
emerged during that.

And

Yes, that is the only thing that
it is interesting to point out

that that emerged quite early in the record of that
interrogation, probably early in the morning, so that they
had at least the afternoon to obtain a warrant.
Back, if I may, to the question raised by the
Amicus in this case.

He would seem to argue to this Court

that somehow, an individual's privacy interest in his auto­
mobile, at least when it is not parked at home, is not of
sufficient intensity to necessitate full indication of the
Fourth Amendment.

I would first examine the assumption that he
makes that individuals do not expect, in an automobile, the
same kind of security interests that they do in other objects
of their life.

Certainly, there is no basis in the Fourth

Amendment to differentiate between an automobile and other
effects.

The Solicitor General cites no empirical data

suggesting that Americans do not expect a privacy interest in
their automobiles and the only case law which he cites is a
52-year-old Michigan case dealing with a car that was found
upon a fairgrounds.
I submit that the assumption that in 197^ we do
not expect the same privacy interest with respect to our
automobiles that we do with respect to other accoutrements
of our life is simply unfounded.

It might be — or it might

53
have been, a valid assumption in a more pastoral age when
people led a self-contained existence on their own homestead,
but today, if anything, the automobile, for better or worse,
has become the very focus of modern society.

A man’s home,

very often, is a series of rented apartments, motel rooms,
even in a growing number of cases, the

vehicle itself and to

a very high proportion of our citizens, it seems to me that an
automobile may well be a person’s most tangible domain,
QUESTION:

Mr. Campbell, I suppose you would

concede that a number of oases that this Court had, CArroll
and Chambers and Cady, have said that a car is quite
different for Fourth Amendment purposes than a man’s home.
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

I do, your Honor.

That doesn't, I realize, answer the

question you are addressing yourself to, whether conceding
that difference, it still has Fourth Amendment protection.
MR. CAMPBELL:

Your HOnor, I think the difference

is that, whether you start at the outset and say, "Automo­
biles are to be set apart," under the Fourth Amendment, or
whether you say that they are included under Fourth Amendment
coverage but the way in which we deal with them may have to
be different, based on their mobility.
QUESTION:
tantamount

Well,

would you 3ay a motorcycle is

to a car for purposes of your argument?
MR. CAMPBELL:

Yes, I would.

54
QUESTION:

How about a bicycle?

MR. CAMPBELL:

Yes.

I would

that the observations that I have

3Ubrnit

made about automobiles are not merely abstract generalization
but relate specifically to this case because there is evidence
in the trial record to the effect that Mr. Lewis, because he
had three businesses and taught, virtually lived in his
automobile and that may be found in the bill of exceptions
page 889.

I submit that the —
QUESTION:

That would be an interesting analogy

if this were a search inside the automobile, but this is not
quite that.

The Government makes a good deal of that and I

think Mr. Conway does, too, that there is no entry into the
automobile.
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

Well, your HOnor, there was —

If you are analogizing It to a

dwelling that was —
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

There was -—

— there was no entry into it.

It was

simply scraping something off the bumper or the front fender,
wasn't it?
MR. CAMPBELL:

No, I -would take the position

that scraping is an entry into the automobile and also, I
would —
QUESTION:

Well, he didn’t live — he may have

55
lived in his automobile, but he didn't live sitting up on the
bumper, that's the point.
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

I grant you that, sir.

I submit —

What sort of clothing did you find in

the car?
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:
car.

I beg your pardon, your Honor?

They didn’t find any clothing In the

Did they find a toothbrush In there?
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor,

Well, where do you get this living in

the car business?
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

Well —

You pulled that right out of the

sky, didn't you?
MR. CAMPBELL:

No, your Honor, I don’t think so.

He specifically -— I think his exact words in the transcript
were that he lived in his automobile a lot and by that he
meant that he was constantly going from one occupation to
another and he spent a great deal of time in his automobile.
I submit that the only logical and adaptable
concept of the Fourth Amendment is that it be held to protect
one’s sphere of existence, whatever that may , in an
individual case, may be.

I think this is precisely the

approach that the Court has taken.

In Terry, the Court

pointed to the fact that the inestimable right of personal

56
security belongs as much to the citizens on the street as to
the homeowner closeted in his study to dispose of his secret
affairs and I think that the Katz case is yet another
example where this Court has dealt, not with a proprietary
interest, but in an interest in one's sphere of existence.
It Is true Lewis did seek

privacy in his auto­

mobile, as evidenced by the fact that he put his car into a
commercial parking lot to make it safe from the vulnerability
of public areas.

He did not abandon his car in the way that

the defendant did In Cady versus Dumbrowski.
But even if you grant the Amicus the assumption
that there is somehow some inherent Inferiority in an auto­
mobile, the result which he projects from that, it seems to
me, is mystifying.

He suggests that, since we have

declared automobiles to be second class effects under the
Fourth Amendment, that all we have to do is give them a part
of the Fourth Amendment and he arbitrarily picks, I think,
the first part, the reasonableness clause and he proposes to
substitute a policeman's ad hoc judgment for the second, the
warrant requirement.
He seems to see this as a way of balancing
Interests, but yet he never once points to the Interest, the
police interest, that needs to be balanced.
Respondent would submit that there is no need
for, and much mischeif to be expected from , this kind of

57
concept.
It seems to me that if there is to be a choice *
or if there Is a choice between prospective and retrospective
judicial determinations for probable cause, It should be made
In favor of prospective, probable cause determinations, not
only because the Constitution dictates
sense does as well.
QUESTION:

it, but because good

I would suggest that —
I don't quite understand what you mean

by "prospective" and "retrospective" probable cause.
MR. CAMPBELL:

Well, I am speaking of going to a

magistrate in the first Instance and securing a warrant as
opposed to going ahead, making the search and then later, In
court, justifying the probable cause.
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION:

Mr. Campbell, may I ask you a very

different question before you sit clown?
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.

There is no question in this case, is

there, that the Fourth Amendment issue that you have been
arguing was considered at every stage of the state court
proceedings?
MR, CAMPBELL:

There is no question of that,

your HOnor.
QUESTION:

And those proceedings included the

trial court and the intermediate appellate court

and the

58
Supreme Court of Ohio?
MR. CAMPBELL:
QUESTION:

That is correct, your Honor.

And a single federal district judge

set all that aside.
MR. CAMPBELL:

He has, on the basis, your Honor,

that those courts improperly applied —
QUESTION:

I understand.

MR. CAMPBELL:

— the constitutional principles

Involved.
QUESTION:

I understand what his basis is.

MR. CAMPBELL: In conclusion, I would say that
that
I do not suggest here/the positions urged by the state and
by the Solicitor General invite last rites for the Fourth
Amendment.

But they do, as excursions from the general

thrust of that basic guarantee, always do, heighten the
potential for abuse of a citizen by his government.
In some instances, that risk may be worth the
taking but here it was not necessary and it is not worth
the taking and I would urge deferments of the decisions
below.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Campbell.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Frey?
You have about four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.
MR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

59
First of all, a couple of factual matters with
respect to the question of when they knew that the car was
parked on the lot and at page 61(a) of the Appendix, there is
testimony by the witness that they did not know during the day
that the car was parked on that particular lot.
QUESTION::

Are you going to suggest when they did?

MR. FREY:

I think they learned it at the time

that the arrest took place and they obtained the claim check
for that parking lot.

yes.

QUESTION

They could have asked.

MR. FREY

They could have asked.

QUESTION

At 10:00 o’clock.

MR. FREY

They could have asked at 10:00 o'clock,

Also, apparently it was stipulated by Mr. Scott,

Lewis' attorney that the testimony' of Clyde Mann ivas supported
by the full transcript of the taped proceedings which he had
been furnished by the prosecutor.
Now, the consent argument which was discussed —
our argument on the consent issue is that the district court
never resolved the question of whether Mr. Lewis consented to
the seizure of his automobile because the district court held
that it was not relevant, since he did not consent to the
search and the district court found that the taking of the
paint samples was a search and in our brief, I think at
page 20, we make the point that if the Court finds that the

60
taking of the paint samples liras not a search, then assuming
even that the Court held that a warrant would be required for
the seizure, there appears to be a factual issue left
unresolved by the district court here as to whether there was
consent to the seizure as distinct from the search.
QUESTION:

Well, was Mr. Campbell correct that

there wa3 no finding in any —
MR. FREY: No consent.
QUESTION:

— in any of the Ohio courts, none of

the three Ohio courts found this consent.
MR. FREY:

I believe that is right.

Now, we suggest that taking the paint chip from
the car without a seizure would not have required a warrant.
When we

say this, we are not saying that the Fourth

Amendment does not apply to automobiles or that the Fourth
Amendment does not apply to the taking of paint chips.

We

are saying that the warrant requirement that the Court has
adopted as attached to the reasonableness standard of the
Fourth Amendment is what doesn't apply here.
Now, we have not picked arbitrarily beti^een two
clauses of the Fourth Amendment and said, well, he should
have the benefit of the reasonableness clause, but not the
benefit of the warrant clause.
The warrant clause, by its terms, is not
applicable here.

The warrant clause only becomes

6l
applicable if the Court presumes the search to be unreasonable
without a warrant.

lie, of course, is always entitled to the

reasonableness protection, assuming that the nature of the
action is either a search or a seizure under the Fourth
Amendment.
I am advised by one of my colleagues with
reference to Justice Stewart’s question about the key to the
locker that there is a case before the Court now on petition
for certiorari from the Fifth Circuit, United States against
Grille, in which a key was taken from the petitioner upon his
being jailed and police learned of a duffel bap; which the key
fit from a confererate who indicated that it contained evidence
of a cocaine importation conspiracy.

They went to the duffel

bag and they opened it up and found the evidence and the
Fifth Circuit held that they were not required to obtain a
warrant in that situation.

Now, we have not yet responded to

that certiorari petition, but I think in the pawn shop
illustration, there would be a lesser policy of privacy if
he turned his gun over to the pawn shop, I don’t see that there
is the kind of interest there that would require more than a
finding of reasonableness of police action in going to the
pawn shop and seizing the gun.
I see my time is up.

Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
