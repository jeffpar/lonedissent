MR. CHIRP JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in 73-629, Kosydar against National Cash Register.
Mr, Petfcay, you may proceed when you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DWIGIIT C, PETTAY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE PETITIONER
MR, PETTAY;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court;
This case concerns the continuing conflict between
the State's power to tax and the prohibition from taxing
exports contained in the import-export clause, which is
Article I, Section 10, Clause 2.
This case originated by -the Tax Commissioner of
Ohio issuing a tangible personal property tax assessment
against National Cash Register, NCR, and issuing it against
their international inventories, which were located and
resting in Dayton, Ohio, on tax listing date which was
December 31st, 1967.
National Cash Register appealed this assessment to
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, which is an administrative
body, and it did affirm the Tax Commissioner,
Upon appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court by NCR,
the Court, in which we consider an unprecedented decision,
five-to-two, overturned one hundred years of this Court's
carefully developed definition of export, and held that the

4
property in question was in fact, an export.
It is our contention that tangible personal property
located in a State on tax listing date is subject to the
State's right to tax, and that's especially clear where, in
a situation like this, the property has received something
from tine State for which the State can ask something in
return, and where no movement of any sort has occurred toward
a stream of exportation.
The facts in this case basically are not in dispute.
The National Cash Register Company has its world
headquarters, main production facilities and warehouse in
Dayton, Ohio.

It primarily manufactures cash registers,

accounting machines, and data processing machines.
It markets these throughout the United States and
in 124 foreign countries.
When a foreign order is placed with NCR, it's sent
to the factory in Dayton, where the product is manufactured.
NCR maintains no inventory of machines capable of meeting
incoming orders from foreign customers.
This is because many countries will not allow a
partial shipment, and because, in some cases, the import
licenses cannot be gotten.
After the machine is produced and inspected, it is
packaged for export shipment.
The property involved in this case was specifically

constructed for foreign customers, finished, crated, and
in storage in inventory in NCR' s warehouse awaiting foreign
shipment on December 31st, 1967, when Ohio personal property
taxation was assessed.
So on tax listing date, which was December 31st,
1967, payment had not been made to NCR by the prospective
purchasers, no export license had been issued, no letter of
credit authorized, the machines were in complete control of
NCR, and, of most importance, no movement toward a foreign
destination had occurred.
And according to NCR's own witness, this means
the rtens were m inventory, and that is prior to when the
items had been put on board a commercial carrier, or had
actually left the shipping dock.
Some machines have remained in storage in the
warehouse awaiting shipment for up to three years.

The

record does show that no machines manufactured by NCR were
ever diverted or are capable of being diverted to the
domestic market.
Due to special construction, the machines cannot
economically be converted from domestic use and. sale.

The

records shows that against NCR’s profit margin of about
five percent, the conversion costs would be approximately
16 percent of the cost of the machine.
QUESTION:

Do those machines have any scrap value

6
at all?
MR. PETTAY;
Honor.

I would imagine they would , Your

The record does not show that, but I am sure they

would.
It is our position that: in interpreting the importexport clause of the U. S. Constitution, this Court has had
at least seven occasions in which to consider the question,
and these started in 1886 and the last one was in 1949.
In each of these cases, the Court has taken a
consistent position, that being that there is not an export
until movement, final movement does occur.
I would like very briefly to discuss three of these
cases, if I may, which we think represents this Court's
opinion.
The first case of importance is Coe vs, Errol, this
was an 1886 case.

In that case this Court dealt with the

factual situation of spruce logs which were cut in New
Hampshire and placed in a stream, to be floated down the
river to Maine.
They were detained in Errol, New Hampshire, by low
water, and they were taxed there.
This Court struggled with the issue of whether the
products of the State are liable to be taxed like other
property in the State, though intended for exportation.
And the answer was yes.

7
This Court held that,

until there is actual final

movement, that the goods are a part of the general mass of
property of the State and are subject to taxation.
The Court also stated that the owner's state of
mind, in other words his intent, did not cause the exemption
from taxation to occur.
The next important case, we believe, is A. G.
Spaulding, which this Court considered in 1923, and the
reason that case was important was because Mr. Justice Holmes
noted that a point must be fixed at which the export must be
said to begin.
He said it was important to note that, because in
some cases there is a point very near, on one side or the
other, and unless the point is fixed, any determination may
seem arbitrary.
The most recent decision of this Court, and one
in which the facts are most similar to this case, is the
Empresa case in 1949,
In that case a cement plant, in California was sold
to a South American corporation for export.

An export

license was issued, title passed, and a common carrier was
hired to dismantle and package the plant for shipment,.
The county levied a personal peroperty tax on the
parts of the plant that had not been shipped out of the
country

8
Mr. Justice Douglas held that it was taxable,
stating that:

It is not enough, intent to export: is not

enough? it is, in fact, the entrance of the articles in the
export stream that marks the start of the process of
exportation.
and he stated that nothing less would suffice.
QUESTION:

Your recital of the facts just a few

minutes ago would make that case enormously distinguishable;
the cement plant could be used anywhere, couldn't it?
In any country.
MR. PETTAY:

Yes, it basically could, Your Honor.

But —
QUESTION: And you’ve just told us tiiat there's even
doubt about whether there’s scrap value to these cash
registers.
MR, PETTAY:

There’s nothing in the record to indi­

cate whether the re is scrap value or not.
QUESTION: Well, so that it leaves the matter in
doubt.
MR. PETTAY: That is correct.
QUESTION;

And you’ve indicated that they are not

suitable for the American market.
MR. PETTAY:

That is correct, Your Honor, they are

not.
QUESTION:

The cement plant was suitable for the

9
.American market, wasn* t it?
MR. PETTAY;

It may have been, I do not know from

the record.
QUESTION:

In the cement plant, wasn’t the tax

imposed only on those parts thereof not already in the stream
of commerce?
MR. PETTAY:
QUESTION;

That is correct.

Those that --

So it was only part of the cement

plant that was taxed.
MR. PETTAY5

That is correct.

Those that had been

shipped, tl'iere was no tax assessed on them.
QUESTION:

Are you not relying on the Joy Oil case,

when you cite those other three?
MR. PETTAY;

Yes, we did discuss it in our brief,

Your Honor.
QUESTION: The part of the cement plant that wasn't
taxed in Siderurgica had actually left the country, hadn’t
it?
/

MR. PETTAY:

That is correct.

There was actual

movement, and it had left the country.
In this case there has been no actual movement at
all, other than, from the actual manufacturing facility to
the storage facility, which is in the same townt Dayton,
Ohio.
We contend that these cases, which represent almost

10

one hundred years of Supreme Court precedent, stated that —
say that a State can tax tangible personal property which is
located in that State, and -the export exemption only
attaches when the property is exported.

And that means when

it has actually begun, its final movement in -the export
stream.
QUESTION:

Is there any historical justification

for the view that the original meaning of this clause was
to prevent a second State —- was only to prevent a second
State from imposing tax on imports, i.e., take this case of
Ohio and contiguous to Ohio is Pennsylvania, Ohio has no
access to the ocean or the seas or to international trade,
Pennsylvania does, and that -the purpose was to prevent
Pennsylvania from laying a tax on exports from Ohio to the
port, say, of Philadelphia to go overseas?
MR. PETTAY:

Yes, sir.

We believe 'that, to be true,

and Madison's Debates, which we mention in our brief, state
that we believe —* or that the intent was to insure the free
flow of goods among the States, and not from —QUESTION: That the seacoast States couldn't
discriminate against the interior States and thereby get a
competitive advantage in international trade.

Wasn't that

the -MR. PETTAY:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
— historical background of this?

11
MR. PETTAY;

Yesf I believe it to be.

We believe that the test is not whether there is
certainty of export, as the respondent states here.

The

ultimate certainty at some time in the future is not enough.
In -the case at bar on tax listing date, the
property was resting in Ohio.

It was also part of the

general mass of property in Ohio, and it was receiving
something from Ohio, in which Ohio -«* for which Ohio had a
right to ask something in return.
For example, take the property that was in Ohio
for three years.

If respondent's position is correct, then

during each one of those -three years the property was
receiving services from the State of Ohio, yet, since there
was certainty of export, that Ohio could not levy a tax on
these goods.
And we do not believe that has ever ■—
QUESTION:

Would not that same principle that

you're now arguing apply, if they took -these items off of
the end of the production line in the factory and loaded
them on trucks on that very day, took -them to Philadelphia
or Baltimore and put them on ships?
MR. PETTAY:
QUESTION;
MR. PETTAY:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
We've got seme protection.
Some protection, but —
Yes .

12
MR. PETTAY:

— what we're saying is they get a

lot more by staying in the warehouse for three years.
And during that three-year period, the services provided by
the State of Ohio make it more certain that these goods will
in fact be in salable condition when their export journey
actually does commence.
So there is an additional service.
QUESTION: Well, aren't those services covered by
the tax on the warehouse?
MR. PETTAYj
QUESTION;

It may be again in port. Your Honor.
"May be”?

Well, I assume that any

warehouse in the v/ilds is paying property taxes.
MR. PETTAY:

That is correct. Your Honor.

But this is also a tangible personal property tax
assessment.

The question is not whether NCR has paid a

great deal of taxes.
QUESTION;

But you're emphasizing that Ohio was

doing so much for them.
MR. PETTAY:

I thought you were doing it for free.
No, we're certainly not, Your Honor.

We believe that policy also dictates that the Ohio
Supreme Court's decision be reversed.

The effect of

recognizing an earlier point would curtail the power of the
State to tax, and we believe that would be in conflict with
the trend of recognizing the importance of meeting State
revenue needs.

13

There is a tremendous growing need for State
services, and we feel that when property is in a State and
located there, and it's part of the general mass on tax
listing date, that the right should be granted to the State
to tax that property,
I believe I would like to save the rest of my time
for rebuttal if ne cess airy.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr. Day.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER F. DAY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. DAY:

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think that we agree that there is a point in time
where the immunity provided by the Constitution will preclude
a State or locality from levying a tax upon it.

The

question is simply when that time, and if that time has
arrived in this case.
I will not dwell on the facts of this case, because
they are entirely not disputed.

There is no controversy

whatever, I think, between the State and the company over the
facts.
But I would like to spend a few moments in
addressing myself to the question:

Why should physical

motion be required to be shown before the immunity provided

by the export clause attaches?
It's our position that in this case there is no
need whatsoever for showing physical motion before immunity
does attach.
Why not, simply because the physical character of
the goods in question demonstrates conclusively that the goods
can't go any place else but overseas.

These machines are

unique, they were built pursuant to foreign orders, they were
constructed to serve foreign customers, they can't be used
in the United States.

So when these machines have moved to

the NCR warehouse, have been packaged and crated and the
stamp of their exportation destination placed upon them,
they are at that moment exports in every real sense, just
as much as the day when they are loaded aboard a carrier.
Now, the State —
QUESTION: Would that be true, Mr. Day, even if they
were kept in the warehouse for three years in that condition?

MR. DAY:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that is true.

It. has been pointed out that there are some instances where
'this has occurred.

Those instances are not the everyday

occurrence, I want to make that clear.
•There is certainly no incentive for National Cash
Register to keep its goods stored in the warehouse.

The

sooner they can move them out, the sooner they can get paid.
These instances that have occurred like that have

15
occurred not because of NCR's desire,, but solely because of
problems with -the foreign license problem, the foreign
exchange problem that prevents them from sending them.
QUESTION: Well, you don't say that they're not
in movement?
MR. DAY;

These goods that are in question are not

in movement as of tax day.

They are in the warehouse of

NCR.
QUESTION: Well, why are they not being moved?
MR. DAY;
Your Honor.

They are there for about three reasons,

The shipments that are made are made of an

order, and this order may be —
QUESTION;

The reason .is because you haven't got

your money.
MR. DAY: Well, that may be one reason, Your Honor,
yes.
Another reason is we have -QUESTION: Well, if you've got the money, is there
any other reason?
MR. DAY;

Yes, there is, Your Honor.

The other reasons are these;

the goods are not

~~ these machines are not all produced on one, at one time.
They are produced day by clay, so they have to be collected
until the entire order is ready for shipment.
reason.

That's another

16
Another reason is
QUESTION: Well, several reasons — I assume that
whole-order groups are still sitting there.
MR. DAY:

I'm sorry, I didn't understand your

question.
QUESTION: Well, you don't send them until you get
the money, do you?
MR. DAY:

In some — on some occasions, yes.

will sent on open account in some instances.

They

In some

instances they will be sent on letters of credit —
(' IESTION; And there are some countries you won't
send them to until you get the money and put the money in the
bank and make sure it stays there; isn't that right?
MR. DAY;

I think that's probably true, Your Honor.

Yes.
QUESTION s

But the whole point is that they are not

— they are not in transit by any stretch of the imagination.
MR. DAY: That is absolutely correct.

We do not

contest that one bit.
QUESTION: Right.
MR. DAY:
myself .is:

The question to which I want to address

Why should motion be required?
Now, the State, I am sure, would concede immunity —
QUESTION:

Mr. Day, in that connection, how does your

case differ from the old case involving the logs that were

17

detained up in New Hampshire on the way to Maine?
MR. DAY;

It differs in this respect, Your Honor;

we're dealing there with logs.

Logs is a commodity that has

a domestic use equal to a foreign use.

In short, logs can

be used anywhere to make lumber.
Now, in that instance, like ooy Oil, which involved
gasoline, like the other cases which involved goods of that
type, there is no way on tax listing date that you can say
for sure that those products or those goods are going to go
abroad, unless they have been evidenced to be in motion.
QUESTION; Well, then you're placing everything on
fungibi1ity, aren't you?
MR. DAY: Fungibility is one word that can be used,
yes.
I think more accurately, whether or not the goods
have a domestic Use, whether they're fungible or not, is
idie crucial inquiry.
QUESTION: Was the cement plant part fungible?
MR. DAY;

It was not fungible, Your Honor, and

that's why I alluded to the domestic use.
The Empresa case dealt with what was termed a
«I»

cement plant.

i*J**MiMXMBUii a

That was only a convenient term of reference.

As a cement plant, it involved a whole host of things;
machinery and equipment, supplies, parts, and a cement plant
which was in process of being dismantled.

IS
As of tax listing day, 1 think the record in -that
case reveals that about ten percent of it had been shipped.
I don't know what that ten percent was, whether it was ten
percent in weight or value; but ten percent had gone.
The remaining 90 percent rested where it had always been,
and it had been used there domestically year after year.
Wow, my point, is this:

that plant had been used

in the United States, it could be used again.
QUESTION:
MR* DAY:

You mean the 90 percent of it could be?
Yes, I think it could.

could have been replaced.

Ten percent

The record did not show it could

not be.
I wonder if the decision might not have been
different in that case if 90 percent had gone and ten percent
remained.
QUESTION: But 40 percent was crated, wasn't it?
MR. DAY:

There was 78 percent ~~ and again I don’t

know of what — in the Empresa case that remained either
uncrated or unassembled.

There was a small part that was

crated, and then there was ten percent that had been shipped.
QUESTION:

It seems to me what your argument comes

down to, maybe it's perfectly sound, is really certainty of
des filiation.
MR. DAY:

That is the point, I think, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And this sounds to me like it's a single

test rather than a double one that the old cases seem to
propose.
HR. DAY:

I don't believe that the old cases

really set. up a double test, Your Honor.

I think that the

cases that have been cited and argued to this Court show
this:

that’movement, physical movement is one of the

indicia of certainty of exportation.
How can anyone say, with things like gasoline mid
oil, or a cement plant for that matter, that on tax listing
day they're bound to go abroad.
a domestic home.

They might just as well find

You can use gasoline, oil, cement plant,

baseball bats, just as well in Iowa as you can in France or
Germany.
That's not true of all of these machines here.
QUESTION: Well, what you're saying, really, is
that all of these machines were irreversibly committed to
interstate commerce — international commerce.
MR. DAY;

Your Honor, Mr, Chief Justice, that's

exactly what we're saying.

They were committed irrevocably

and irreversibly to the export process.
And they were just as firmly and irrevocably
committed the day before they were shipped as five minutes
after they might have been put on board a carrier,
QUESTION:

How about

were being manufactured?

during the period while they

Would you say that this test would

20
say they were exempt than?
MR. DAY:

Ho, Your Honor, we've made no claim for

any goods during the course of manufacture.
Now, we have not made that claim for two reasons.
Before the goods are entirely assembled, they are
just a collection of parts; and during the course of
manufacture, one part is added to another, and the assemblies
are put together.

So until they are completely made, they're

not so distinguishable from any other machines.
That is why our claim goes only to those machines
which have been fully manufactured, have been moved to the
warehouse and crated and stored there, awaiting the carrier's
arrival.
QUESTION:

With the label on them?

Isn't that right?
MR. DAY:

With the label, Your Honor, yes.

QUESTION:

Mr. Day, before you go on, does

respondent manufacture these machines only where they have
specific orders for them, or does it manufacture them generally
for inventory, the finished-goods inventory?
MR. DAY:
this point.

Mr. Justice, the record is very clear on

The machines in question are manufactured solely

pursuant, to foreign order.
built prior to that time.

Not one of these machines is
None of the machines would have

existed were it not for advance prior order.

21
QUESTION; This is a specific order for so many
machines of such-and-such a type?
MR, DAY:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Or, more

accurately, a collection of machines arising from specific
orders.
QUESTION: Right.
And you said, I think, that they were crated and
the destination of each crate is on the crate, is it?
MR. DAY;

That's correct, Your Honor, they're in

the warehouse, stamped and packaged.
QUESTION; So you know whether it's going to
Venezuela or to Britain?
MR. DAY;

That's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

Does the record show if any of them

in tlie past have ever been diverted and not shipped?
MR. DAY;

The record shows that every machine that

has gone into the international division has, without
exception, found a foreign destination.
Without exception, I say.

There is one — there

was an instance or two where, unfortunately, the original
order aborted because of one reason or another, but the
company was able to find a home for those goods in another
country that could accommodate 'them, or the language was
the same.
But even that is a rarity.

22
I think that your question raises an important
point in this case.
instances.

All the prior cases have been singular

That is, one order for a million gallons of

gasoline, one order for a cement plant, one order for a
thotisand gallons of oil.
Here we don't have one order.

We have here a

continuing business proposition of shipment after shipment
after shipment, day after day, month after month, and I think
that this must affect the legal conclusion.
Most certainly if the evidence sfitowed that only
fifty percent of these machines actually found a foreign
destination, I don't believe we would be here today.

Because

if they all did not go, it would certainly raise a substantial
question as to the remaining machines back in the warehouse.
We can't overlook that point.

I think it's an

element of proof that's almost conclusive.
I would like to address myself further to this
concept of motion.

The State argues and, I expect, would

concede that if these goods were just simply loaded on a
carrier on tax listing date, just bringing them out there
and putting them on a railroad car, a truck, maybe an airplane,
then at that magical moment this veil of immunity would settle
over them.
I think that is a too superficial view of what
immunity means here.

Most certainly -these goods are as much

an export two seconds before they get on that carrier as they
are two seconds afterwards.
And if they are to be diverted, I suppose NCR
could order them taken off, but that does not occur.
Why doesn't it occur?

Because there's no place

else for these goods to go but to the foreign destinations,
to serve those prior orders.
QUESTION;

I guess everybody would agree, too, if

you put them in a railroad warehouse; wouldn't they?
MR. BAY:
QUESTION:

I'm sorry, sir, I didn't understand.
I assume both sides would agree if you

put the cash registers in the warehouse of the railroad.
MR. DAY:

I expect the State would concede, I

wouldn't know’ about that without asking them.
The State argues one further question, one further
point.

It alludes general to ttfhafc I call a quid pro quo

argument.

The state says, "We've done something for you,

we should receive something in return."
QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Day, is there any

average time that a given machine sits the re in the ware­
house?

That is, is there something like an average of two

months, three months, two years, or something?
MR. DAY:

The record does not reveal that, Your

Honor, and I'm unable to answer it.
QUESTION: Well, do I understand that an order may

24
be for a number of different machines, and the order all
has to be shipped at once, and some things are manufactured
and stored but not shipped because you have to wait until the
rest of the order has been manufactured; is that so?
HR. DAY;
QUESTION;

That's one of tlie reasons, yes, sir.
And then what's this about foreign

countries sometimes won't take import permits or something?
What's that?
MR. DAY;

Yes, in order for the goods to be

exported abroad, —QUESTION:
HR, DAY;

Yes.
—- there must be an import license

granted by many countries.
QUESTION:
MR. DAY;

Yes,
They simply will not let goods come in

willy-nilly unless they approve it.
QUESTION; And even though some purchaser there may
be anxious to gat what he ordered from you, he can't until
he gets the permit to bring it in; is that it?
MR. DAY;

That's correct, Your Honor,

QUESTION: Sometimes that takes a long time, does it?
MR. DAY:

That's correct.

It does at times,

QUESTION: And is there any average about that, or
is it -—
MR. DAY;

I cannot answer that.

The record does not

25
state it and I do not know, as a. matter of fact.

All I know

is that they try to speed up the process as much as they can.
QUESTION:

And is there any problem of shipping

which accounts for the delay sometimes?
HR. DAY:

Yes„

They have problems in shipping at

times.
QUESTION:

And then, I gather, there is also, as

Mr. Justice Marshall asked earlier, sometimes problems of
financing?
MR. DAY:
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:

Yes, that is a big problem.
TJnh-hunh.
You cannot -- many countries of the

world will not permit goods to be brought into that country
unless they're sold on certain financial terms.

This is a

balance of trade, balance of payments problem.
QUESTION:
MR. DAY:

Yes.
That's encountered often,

I was going to allude briefly to the State's
argument on quid pro quo, which is simply:

they ought to be

paid something for having done something:for NCR.
Now, I don't know for sure what that something is.
It is ah argument of general governmental services, by and
large.

But we point out in our brief that the National

Cash Register Company has already paid its way here.
The parts, the assemblies of these machines have

26

been subjected to Ohio personal property tax, and we have
paid on those.

And we can scarcely see why the general

argument that the State ought to receive money should in any
way dilute the immunity granted by the Constitution.
I suppose that the State of Ohio is saying that
this Court should in some way waive the export immunity, as
it has in the commerce clause area.
We do not believe that the commerce clause can be
equated -with the export immunity clause.

Simply because

the import-export immunity granted is a very clear prohibition,
there is not the room for interpretation as there is in the
commerce clause area.
X believe that the Supreme Court of Ohio put their
finger on this case,right on the crux of it, when they said
that in this case the certainty of exportation has been fully
proved and it's fully equivalent to any other test this
Court has used in the past, whether it be delivery to a
common carrier, delivered to a private carrier, or physical
movement.
In short, on tax listing day, these goods were as
much export as they would be at any other time.
That, I think, is the only question involved here.
I'll not do more than allude to the national
interest in exportation at this time.
evident proposition.

I think it's a self-

I do not know how much weight that

should be given, but if the State argues that the State's
interest in taxation is a great one, then I would submit to
this Court that the national interest in fostering exporta­
tion at this time is greater than it ever has been in our
history.
This has been evidenced by congressional actions,
executive actions, et cetera, et cetera.
QUESTION: Well, would a decision against your
client in this case prevent or impede or impair exportations?
MR, DAY:

I think it might, but it's very difficult

for us to prove that.

I believe that maybe tills is an

instance where the State should have to prove -this.
Who can say when a tax will become such a burden
that, it becomes difficult or an insurmountable burden?
Any tax is an item of cost, and in order to compete abroad,
all these items of cost build up, to the point where
ultimately — ultimately

you can’t compete.

1 don't

know where the point is, but there will be a time when there,
is an additional straw that will break the camel's back.
I don't know where it is, though.
QUESTION:

And this, Mr. Day, ten years hence

MR. DAY;
QUESTION:

It might indeed, Your Honor.
You're not suggesting that the law

should change because the factor changes?

20
MR. DAY;

No, Your Honor.

I'm not suggesting in

this case that the law should change.

In fact, our whole

argument is that this case in no way cuts across any prior
decisions.
The prior decisions of this Court have been
fashioned for specific factual circumstances;

Those were ail

commodities that could be used here in the United States.
So, in determining when the certainty of exporta­
tion of those goods was to be fixed, it was a very reasonable
conclusion to say:

Not so here.

The time for fixing immunity here
That is when they have become fixed,

QUESTION;

Mr. Day, this is really not very

relevant to this case, but I've had, from time to time,
discussions with some of my brothers about the syllabus rule
in Ohio.

My recollection is that, by reason of a statute

in Ohio, the syllabus is the law and only the syllabus is
the law in the case in the Supreme Court of Ohio, except
when it's a per curiam opinion, in which case the whole
per curiam is the law, and there is no syllabus.
Is my recollection correct, and, if so, is that
still the case?
MR. DAY:

I think your recollection is essentially

29

correct on that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. DAY;

Unh-hunh.
If there are no other questions, that

conducas our argument.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Day.

Do you have anything further, counsel?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DWIGHT C. PETTAY, JR, ESQ,, ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PETTAY;

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

We believe the issue in this case is the State's
right to tax tangible personal property located within that
State, and that that's the primary issue, not whether there
is —- the test is not certainty of export, it's the State's
right to tax.
And in that sense I'd like to quote from Joy Oil,
where this Court said that;
"The export-import clause was meant to confer
immunity from local taxation upon property being exported,
not to relieve property eventually to be exported from its
share of the cost of local services.''
How, there's nothing in the record to show that
these specific machines have been taxed.

They have not.

So that although National Cash Register is paying real,
property taxes and may be paying other types of tangible
personal property taxes on other tilings, it has not paid

30
any taxes on the specific machines in issue here today.
Although some of them, conceivably, could have been in Ohio
for several -*** or at least for a period of time, and derived
services during that period of time.
Secondly, there is no evidence in the record to
show what effect, if any, Ohio tangible personal property
taxation had upon these goods in question, whether they had
any effect whatsoever on their salability or NCR's ability
to compete in the foreign market.
The amount of tax here in question today is slightly
less than $50,000T although the actual assessment was one
million dollars.

When you reduce that by the applicable

percentage, we're only talking about $50,000, not one •—
QUESTION: Annually?
MR. PETTAY:

We don't — it varies from year to

year.
QUESTION: Well, $50,000 what?
MR. PETTAY:
QUESTION:

It would be for this one year 1968.
The one year.

MR. PETTAY:

~~ additional assessment.

There

was another assessment.
QUESTION;

How does this case arise now?

Hasn’t

this been going on for some time; did the Tax Division just
catch up to it, or what?
MR, PETTAY:

No.

An assessment was made, and there

31
generally is a several-yea; ■ lag between when property is
returned and when audit is made by the Tax Coranissioner
staff, and then the various levels of litigation involved.
QUESTION: But I take it NCR has been doing this

for years.

I just wondered what made it important as of

1967, or whenever it was?
MR, PETTAY:

I believe in this specific year

National Cash Register filed what they call a 902 claim,
in which they ask that the international inventory be
released from tangible personal property taxation, based
upon this issue, at the Tax Commissioner's level? and the
Tax Commissioner refused.
QUESTION: Does that imply it was taxed before?
MR. PETTAY:

To the best of my knowledge, it was.

But there's nothing in the record to that effect.
Also •**“
QUESTION:

So that in many respect it has a 1930

character to it, it's the kind of litigation that was
fashionable then rather than now.
MR. PETTY:

It may well be.

Finally, I think it's important to note that the
present test that this Court has provided for us is
objective, whereas the test of certainty of export is very
subjective.

We believe that, contrary to respondent's

position, that the — one of the primary reasons there has

been little litigation on this subject is because the test,
as it currently exists, is objective rather than subjective.
And we believe that the test, if adopted by this
Court, as proposed by the respondent, would become a
subjective test and would be much more difficult for tax
personnel to administer.

And also much more difficult for

taxpayers to perceive and follow adequately.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.

the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
