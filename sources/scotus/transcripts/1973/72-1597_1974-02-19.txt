MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Ue will hear arguments

next in 72-1597, Ulysses Vernon Beasley, efc al., against
Food Fair of North Carolina.
. Mr. Eubanks.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY L. EUBANKS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. EUBANKS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This matter comes on to he heard here on Writ of
Certiorari from the State of North Carolina, and simply
involves our Right-to-vjork Law and the relationship of that
Right"to-Work Law with the Federal substantive and the Federal
National Labor Relations Act.
The factual situation is one where three individuals
who were employed at some food stores in North Carolina were
terminated right after a union election that was conducted by
the National Labor Relations Board.
Now, our Right-to"Work Law provides simply that in
North Carolina a person who has the right to live has the right
to work there, but after the union won the election these three
individuals were fired.
It is our position simply that there is a coexistence
that is possible between a Right-to-Work Law in the State of
North Carolina that protects supervisors and a Federal law which

4
protects employees.
Now, the cases dealing with the right of people
that belong to unions, and whether or not there is a
Constitutional right for that approach,have been dealt with
many times by this Court.
First of all, in the Morton case, back in 1940 »** in
Tborass V. Co 11 ins in 1945, the Court stated that, "Union
membership is protected by the right of association under the
First and Fourteenth Amendments."
Well, what that meant, as has been interpreted later,
was that is true so long as there is no Government interference.
In other words, Government interference can't interfere with the
right of association.
And that gave rise to a lot of cases involving
people excluded from coverage under the National Labor
Relations Act, for example, teachers, garbage workers, and
a lot of cases they have extended up into the present time.
Well, it is our position, simply, that in North
Carolina, as in about nineteen or twenty other States, we have
a law that says one other group of people, and that is
supervisors, have a right to belong to a union.
Now, if doesn't say, nor does our law say, that a
company or an employee is required to bargain with anybody
because that's been covered by the Federal law.
It simply provides that everybody in North Carolina

has a right to belong to a union without fear of being fired.
Now, if, in fact, this case is pre-empted or the
State law is pre-empted by Federal law, then I would agree with
the defendant and respondent in this case that the State courts
have no business dealing with it.
But it is really our position that this Court in
1967, in the Hanna case, has already answered this question.
We submit that the Banna case, in Section 14(a) of the National
Labor* Relations Act, really determines and answers the question
whether or not a supervisor can join a union, and damages for
his discharge because of hie union membership can be given in
a State court.
And that is the question we have here.
In the Hanitta case, the Court dealt with Section
14(a), and I would like for the Court, if I might, to point out
all the roles of 14(a) of the National Labor Relations Act,
and it reads this way, and I quote:

"Nothing herein shall

prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming
or remaining a member of a labor organisation."
But the second phrase of that same section is what
the Court exactly dealt with in Hanna Mining Company.

That

statement says, "But no employer subject to this Act shall be
compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors
as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or
local, relating to collective bargaining."

6
Now, the point I am snaking by reading this to the
Court Is this.

First of all, Congress says, when it removes

supervisors from the coverage of the National Labor Relations
Act in 194? by the Taft-Hartley Amendment, supervisors can
still belong to unions, but no longer will employees be
required to bargain collectively with unions made up wholly
or partially of supervisors.
Now, if that approach is maintained under the
Federal scheme presently, it is our position that there is
no conflict with our Right-to-Work Law and a protection of a
supervisor and the Federal scheme or the Federal law as
passed in Section 14(a).
And, this is why.

In 1964, in the Nor'am case,

this Court dealt with Federal pre-emption.

The Court has

dealt with it many times, but I am referring to cases
generally cited in our brief.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

It is 12:00 o'clock,

counsel.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 o’clock, noon, oral argument
in the above-entitled matter was suspended for luncheon
recess.)

AFTERKOOK SESSION

(1:00 p.ra.)

m.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Eubanks, you may

continue.
MR. EUBANKS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and my it please

the Court:
Thank you, very much.
You will recall that just before the luncheon
recess I quoted to you a quotation from a case called Thomas
V. Collins which provides ’’union membership is protected by the
right of association under the First and Fourteenth Amendments,11’
That was a 1945 case and it was in that posture of the situation
that Congress chose to amend the Wagner Act, as it was then
called, with the Taft-Hartley Amendment.
Mow, I think it is reasonable for the Court

and

we submit to the Court it is reasonable for us to assume that
Congress, when. it included 14(a) into the Act: it had some
reason for all the words if put in that provision.
You will recall that I read to you just before the
recess, also, Section 14(a),
The only time I can find a case in which the Court
had the actual situation where 14(a) was in issue is the case
called

Hanna Mining, which occurred in 1965.
In that case, the Court talks about the Garmon

decision,' the 1959 decision of this Court -- which I am sure the

8
Court deals with it often in pre-emption, setting out that -in effect, that conduct which is protected or by Section 7, or
prohibited by Section 8 of the National Labor Relations

Act,

is certainly pre-empted from any State control.
But then that case and the Hanna case mention that
there may be some other areas in which it may be better that
State regulation not apply.
Now, I would like to point out that one quote from
Hanna Mining which reads that "the ground rules for pre­
emption in labor laws emerging from our Garmon decision” — the
case I just mentioned

~ ’’should first be briefly summarised.

In general, a State may not-regulate conduct arguably protected
by Section 7 or prohibited by Section 8 of the National Labor
Relations Act.”

End of quote.

Thatfs clear.

And it has been clear since the

Garmon decision.
In Hanna Mining, the Court goes on to point out,
"The legislative purpose may further dictate that certain
activity, neither protected nor prohibited, be deemed
privileged against State regulations,” and continuing, '"for the
reasons that follow, we believe the Board’s decision that
Hanna engineers

or supervisors removed from this case most

of the opportunities for pre-emption.”

End of quote.

Now, it is right there, if the Court please, that the
appellant, plaintiff, in this case, rests 'its'position.

9
In the Ban.ua ease, the Court dealt with a situation
where some supervisory engineers «ere attempting to picket to
obtain recognition from an employer.

The employer» really, in

that case, just said «ell, I don’t believe you represent a
true majority.

It didn’t take, really, the position that «as

ended up -- to start with.
But, in that situation, the Hanna engineers were doing
exactly «hat the last part of Section 14(a) of the national
Labor Relations Act says it cannot do.

In other words, that it

cannot -» no employees subject to this Act shall be compelled
to treat supervisors as employees for the purpose of collective
bargaining.
And the Hanna engineers «ere simply trying to get
this employee to do exactly that.
Well, in the Hanna case, the Court mentions that it
is not dealing in that case with the situation «here a person
could become a supervisor and be fired for being a union member.
So, it,specifically, is not dealing with that
situation.

This Court did.
Well, the situation «e have before this Court right

now is the one the Court, in Hanna., said it wasn't going to
deal with in that case.
In 1967, a case called U.3, v. Morton, before this
Court, pointed out that “-or Teamster Local v, Morton is in
377 U.S., in dealing with the question of pre-emption, 1964, I am

10
sorry ~~ it says to explain the pre-emption doctrine further,
ssThe answer to that question ultimately depends upon whether
the application of State law in this kind of case would
operate to first trade the purpose of the Federal legislation.5'
End of quote.
Now, we submit to the Court that in light of Hanna-the Hanna case, and in line with the statement in the Morton
case, explaining what is and what isn't pre-empted, that the
activity of these three individuals who signed membership
cards for the union and were fired as a result thereof, is not
the kind of activity If regulated by the State would first
trade the National Labor policy.
Q

Bid the State Court identify any particular

provision that the State law was in conflict with?
MR. EUBANKS:

Ho, Your Honor.

In the North Carolina

Supreme Court case, the court simply ruled in that decision that
this matter is pre-empted by Federal law.
basis of their decision.
specifically, in citing

And that was the

The Court of Appeals had ruled,
, Hanna and other decisions that it

had not been pre-empted, and the Supreme Court, of course,
ruled the reverse.
How, I submit to the Court that Hanna Mining simply
says, here is a State court trying to enjoin conduct being
engaged in;.by some supervisors, which the National Labor
Relations ;Act says cannot be done.

The employee is not required

11
to countenance this kind of conduct, and therefore when the
State court attempted to enjoin it, this Court said that's
okay, you can enjoin that kind of conduct because it does not,
in that kind of application

of State law, first trade on national

labor policy.
Well, we are asking the Court in this instance
simply to rule if Congress meant anything when if put the
first part of the sentence of 14(a) in there, "Nothing herein
shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from
becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization," to treat
the first half of that sentence the same way, meaning, in
effect, if people have a right to belong to a union, as
Congress has said, then how can the provision for damages in
a State court which only comes into play if these people are
not allowed to exercise that right, first trade on national
labor policy?
Q

But here you don't have the right to work, you have

the right to organize.
MR. EUBANKS:

Is that right?
Yes, sir.

Did the supervisors have a right to organize?
Q

The point involved in this case is whether these

supervisors had the right to organise.
MR. EUBANKS:
Q

No, sir.

What were they fired for?
MR. EUBANKS:

For simply signing the union card.

12
Q

Is that organization?
MR. EUBANKS:

Yes, sir.

That's all the complaint

alleges.
Q

Is that what the Labor Act is set up to control?

Organizing of labor?
MR. EUBANKS:

Yes, sir, but

t

submit to the Court

that organisation includes much more than just joining a
union.

There are many situations in actual life where

frequently people are members of
Q

a

union

All I am talking about is you keep saying that this

is the right to work, that the North Carolina statute is
interested in protecting the right to work.
MR. EUBANKS:
Q

Yes, sir.

And the right to work is not involved, I submit,

in this case.

It is the right to organise that is involved.

Am I right?
MR, EUBANKS:

I respectfully disagree with you,

Your Honor, for this reason.

If I Blight explain, the reason

I disagree with you is this.

I think that 14(a), the second

phrase of 14(a) covers organizing, yes, but I think it also
permits the joining of

a

union by one individual or more

individuals, for that matter, so long as there is no effort on
their part to go through the processes of the National Labor
Relations Act, calling for recognition, or through some action
like was done in the Hanna case.

13

Q

But you did go to the NLRB ™MR. EUBANKS:

Q

But you did go.
MR. EUBANKS:

Q

We were specifically told by NLRB —

Yes, sir.

Me filed charges.

And you filed charges that they had interfered with

the right to organise?
MR. EUBANKS:

Mo, sir.

We filed charges alleging a

violation of Section 881, in that these discharges were l Talla»
bega

Cotton Mill situation, dealing with the firing of super»

visors to coerce the employees covered by the Act into not
participating in the union.
Q

That's right.
MR. EUBANKS:

q

That was my theory to the NLRB.

Participating in the union -- and the NLRB said no.
ME. EUBANKS:

From discouraging employees, Your Honor,

as opposed to anybody else.

You remember the Act covers only

employees.
Q

I throught the NLRB said that we don’t have any

jurisdiction because supervisory employees are not under our
jurisdiction.
MR, EUBANKS:

They clearly said that,, and that was

the decision of the General Counsel, Mr. Nash, when he contacted
me and Mr. Stockton for the company.

The wording of the letter

was
0

Mow you go to the State court on the right to work.

1®.. EUBANKS:

Yes, sir.

Tbe situation is one where

-- is simply that anybody who has filed a brief in this case,
except us, seems to

put union activity or organizing and

the signing of a union card or joining a union into the same
boat.

It isn’t.
I submit to the Court it isn’t the same thing.
Q

You have to establish, don’t you, Mr. Eubanks, that

the North Carolina law is not a law relating to collective
bargaining, under 14(a).

And your contention is that since all

it talks about is membership in a union, it doesn’t require an
employer to do anything once the man is in the union.

It is

not a law relating to collective bargaining?
MR. EUBAMCS:
it would be pre-empted.

We submit, if it were, Your Honor,
We agree with your position, but we

certainly say if it were one relating to collective bargaining
it would certainly be pre-empted because 14(a), in the second
half of that sentence, says

you can't require an employee to

regognize that kind of situation, and we agree with that.

And

we »•* all the cases relied on by North Carolina Supreme Court
in holding against us, or in reversing the Court of Appeals,
we agree with.

We agree with Hanna Mining.

He agree with any

of the cases which spell out the pre-emption doctrine and what
is precluded from State jurisdiction and what is allowable.
You will recall in Hanna that this Court said, in
Hanna, that that State court, since it is enjoining in conduct

that 14(a) says that supervisors can't engage in, therefore, it
is not first rate State law,-« 1 mean Federal labor legislation

Q

The net result of the State court’s ruling is that

under the Federal Labor Law, under the Federal Labor Statute,
the employer has a guaranteed right that can’t be interfered
with by the State, a guaranteed right to fire a supervisor for
union membership.
MR. EUBANKS:

Well, that’s what the court’s position

was, Your Honor, but even
Q

But that’s necessarily where the State court ended up.
ME. EUBANKS:

Q

It is.

And that although the Federal Act says that nothing

herein shall be taken to prevent membership, nevertheless,
there is a guaranteed right to follow if you are a member.
That’s how the State puts it.
MR. EUBANKS:

Well, Your Honor, that’s what the State

court, as I understood it, said, and that's what I so vehemently
disagree with because even,if you recall, I mentioned a case
called Tallabega Cotton Mills

which,I believe, ~~ and it

involved one of these situations where a supervisor was fired
because he was told to go out and engage in some unlawful
conduct on the part of his employer and he said, !‘I ara not
goixig to do it,” and the employer said, ’Well, if you don’t do
it, I’m going to fire you,” and he wouldn’t do it so he sot fired.

and the case want up through the Board and it was ended up
to the situation that the. Board ruled and was supported by
enforcement that that really coerced employees who were covered
by the Act and by firing a supervisor who was being -- in an
effort to coerce employees, we feel that situation is covered
by 881 of the Act.

And I agree fully.

Bo if the employee sits and contends to this Court
and to us and through all the courts that have gone on before
that,look, an employee should have absolute right to fire a
supervisor.

And that's what X want to address this remark to.

How, I remember in the North Carolina Supreme Court
one of the justices asked me the question, look, this means that
anybody can be a union member,

This even means that a manager

could be a union member.
Well, I submit to the Court they can be, and it
doesn’t mean a disloyalty.

Somebody

it’s not

it’s so

common in our everyday life that people who go up through the
ranks of the union, a local union somewhere in the south, or
wherever it might be, can accumulate benefits through membership
and he’s promoted into supervision.

He keeps his membership.

The ruling of this Court that people are fired simply because
they are union members, not for participation in any conduct
disloyal to an employer, but simply by being something, by
belonging to something, would, in effect, mean that the employer
could go out and fire anybody that was a member of a union.

Tha ft ’ s wha t it means.
In a teacher situation where these teachers attempted
to organize in the Horfch Carolina area, for example, this came
up as to whether or not they had the right to organize.

And,

under the First Amendment, of course, if the State said no or
the county, as the case might be, it would be protected under
the First Amendment.
But, I point out to the Court, respectfully, that to
be a union member is not what 14(a) is to protect against, and
there is no way it could frustrate Federal labor policy for
an employee or a person who has got a right to work and as a
part of his right to live go take a job or sign a union card
and then end up getting fired, when the Federal Labor Law has
already said -- by Congress said ~~ that we could do it.
Q

But your example of the ordinary employee is the easy

case because there the Federal law protects that right and,
obviously, it wouldn’t get this far if it were that kind of a
situation.

The thing that makes your problem difficult is the

man who is a supervisor, and so you do have to address this
proviso in 14(a) which doesn't affect ordinary employees.
MR, EUBANKS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

One thing I point out to the Court -- the Court had a
case that it might find interesting as it relates to this
situation.

It is a case called U.S. v. Robey.

Court is familiar with it.

I am sure the

It dealt with the question of a

Communist who had applied for a job with the Defense Department,
and the Defense Department had a regulation or some policy, or
for some reason he was not hired on the ground that his interests
were inimical to that of this country, because he was an
admitted Communist.
Well, there the Court pointed out, and I'd like to
quote that, if I might, to the Court.

The Court said this, that

"The operative fact upon which the job disability depends is
the exercise of an individual's ri.ght of association, which is
protected by the provisions of the First Amendment," unquote.
Mow, I point that out for this reason:

I submit to

the Court that if Congress did not mean,in its enactment of
14(a), that people should be entitled, even if they are a
supervisor, to continue to be able to join a union, and it
didn’t have that right, surely Congress, in the status of the
law in 1.947, would have been, more explicit in the provisions of
14(a).

They don't talk about membership only in 14(a).

talk about membership

They

and then they talk about collective

bargaining.
X 3ufomit when they talked about membership it said,
in effect, that supervisors cap. join, but I further submit if
the supervisors are bound to:.get and force an employee to
recognise them, that's against the law, and 14(a) doesn't
protect.
But, unless a supervisor is disloyal to his employer

19
and the employer learns of that disloyalty in more respect
than just his joining an organisation, he is certainly entitled
to some protection in the State court.
Q

The supervisor here joined the

collective bargaining

agent here?
MR. EUBANKS:

Your Honor, this situation carae up

right after the campaign started.
Q

There was no organising,

Well, let’s assume that the supervisor decides he

wants to join the union who is the collective bargaining agent.
MR. EUBANKS:
Q

Yes, sir.

I take it that this 164 doesn’t relieve the employer

from bargaining with the bargaining agent just because the
bargaining agent has some supervisor members?
MR. EUBANKS:

1 respectfully disagree with that.

I

think It automatically does.
Q

All right.
MR. EUBANKS:

Q

13 that settled?
Yes, sir.

So that if the employer

if the supervisor joins

the wrong union, and if he joins the bargaining agent -MR. EUBANKS:
Q

Yes, sir.

the employer is excused from bargaining with that

bargaining agent.

Is that true?

MR., EUBANKS:

At that point, in my judgment, you

could take the position if that union contained supervisors
working for me I am not going to bargain.

20
Q

1 would think that if it were the other way there

might be a better argument for firing him.
I®. EU&AMS: I think so, too, Your Honor, and I would
agree.
'Gentlemen, I thank you very much.

time.

Thank you, Mr. Eubanks,

Mr. Stockton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH M. STOCKTON, JR., ESQ.
FOR THE RESPONDENTS
MR. STOCKTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case came through the entire court procedures
of North Carolina, from the Trial Court to the North Carolina
Appellate Court to the Supereme Court of North Carolina, and
thence on Certiorari here.
The Supereme Court of North Carolina, in a rather
exhaustive opinion, reversed the Court of Appeals of North
Carolina which had simply recited the Hanna Mining case, and
said that on the basis of .Hanna the State Court was not pre­
empted and reversed the Trial Court.
the North Carolina

The Supreme Court reversed

Court of Appeals and held

it reviewed the

legislative intent carefully of the Taft-Hartley Amendments of
1947, and the statute 14(a)

and, incidentally, Mr. Eubanks

says nothing about 14(b) which requires an agreement and I assume

•*“ we submit that has nothing to do with this ease.

There is

no union security agreement in this case.
The North Carolina Supreme .Court referred to Section
14(a), to the fact that in the 1947 Taffc-Hartley Amendments
Congress specifically removed supervisors from the definition
of employees, and from the general jurisdiction of the NLRB.
Q

I thought Hanna was 7 or 8.

Are you sure it is 14?

Hanna Manufacturing Company -- Hanna Mining?
HR. STOCKTON:
Your Honor.
Q

No.

I didn’t understand your question,

Was it in reference to the citation of Hanna Mining?
Does it involve Section 7 and 8?

HR. STOCKTON:

It involves Sections 7 and 8 and the

fact that in Hanna this Court said that this was a supervisory
union, supervisors' union in Hanna.

The Court — this Court

said, in that case, they are supervisors so they are outside
7 and 8.

lie’ll also go further and look to see whether there

is any other Federal labor policy that would pre-empt the State
Court from acting.
And we say *— this Court says in Hanna the Committee
Reports reveal that Congress’ propelling intention was to
relieve employers from any compulsion under the Act, and under
State law, to countenance or bargain with any union of supervisory
employees.
So, that, this Court said on 7 and 8 it is out, they
are supervisors.

Insofar as the overriding Federal labor policy,

what the State Court did in enjoining Che supervisors * union
from their picketing, was? in accord with Congressional intent
under the national Labor Relations Act, as indicated by the
Committee Reports.
And, therefore, this Court said we will not pre-empt.
But that’s where our Court of Appeals got off the track on
Hanna, because the instant case -~
Q

Getting back to the other question, what did the

Supreme Court say pre-empted what part of the National Labor
Relations Act?
MR. STOCKTON:

The Supreme Court of North Carolina,

Your Honor?
Q

Yes, sir.
MR. STOCKTON:

They referred to Section 211, the

definition,of taking supervisors out of the definition of
employees, Section 14(a), and the legislative history and
the Federal court cases, Circuit Court cases.
Q

What in the Act, any Federal act, says that a State

is prohibited from taking action against a supervisor?
MR. STOCKTON:
Q

I am wrong.

Section 14 —
Of the State taking action against: an

employer at the behest of a supervisor.
MR, STOCKTON:
Q

What says that the State --

is prohibited from giving relief to a supervisor.
MR. STOCKTON:

To a supervisor?

Q

Yes.

Against an employer.

Ml. STOCKTON:
Q

They refer to Section 14(a) —

Which says?
MR. STOCKTON:

~~ which says nothing prohibits the

supervisor, nothing in this Act, the 47th Amendment, prohibits
the supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of the labor
organisation, but -Q

That’s all it says.
ME. STOCKTON:

No, sir.

It says, ’’but no employer

subject to this subchapter which we are, shall be compelled to
deem individuals defined herein as supervisors'5 -- or these
plaintiffs in these civil damage State suits ~~ "as employees
for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating
to collective bargaining."
And this State court action »Q

That's related to collective bargaining.
ME. STOCKTON:

Q

Yes, Your Honor, but this is -~

And is there anything in this action in the State

court that says anything about collective bargaining?
MR. STOCKTON:
Q

No, sir, I said in the action.
MR, STOCKTON:

Q

In the State statute, itself?

In the action of the State --

By the supervisor.
MR. STOCKTON:

There is nothing in the complaint that

says we are relating this to collective bargaining, but as a

24
practical matter, it has to relate to collective bargaining,
because under

— for example, the legislative historj of the

47 amendments is very clear.
Q

Suppose these supervisors are no longer members of

the union.

Gan they bring the action?
MR. STOCKTON:

Q

They are in the brief,

At this time?

Yes, sir.
MR. STOCKTON:

They are no longer members of the

union when they start the suit; is that your question, Your
Honor?

No, I would say'not, Your Honor, because at the time

they were supervisors for the defendant.

They then joined the

union.
Now, the legislative history is clear, if it please
the Court, on this matter.

Senator Taft, in speaking to these

amendments, said, specifically, speaking of supervisors, and
this is in the brief, they are subject to discharge for union
activity and they are generally restored to the basis which
they enjoyed before passage of the Wagner Act.
Q

Of course, union activity isn’t all that clear, is it,

that it would extend to the mere joining of a union?
MR. STOCKTON:

Well, if they join a union in the

process of a union election going on, then we would say this is
certainly union activity.
They are supervisory.
markets.

They are joining sides with the union.

They are managers, actually, in these

25
Q

Do you say that the North Carolina law here that

prevents a man from being fired for either joining or not
joining a union is a law relating to collective bargaining under
14 (a) ?
MR.. STOCKTON:
Q

Yes, sir.

I think it has to, and ~~

All they said they were doing was joining the union.

They weren’t making any demand, as I understand it, that the
employer bargain with them.
MR. STOCKTON:

Mo, sir, but when they join

the union they are, of necessity, affecting the employer’s
collective bargaining rights.

He is dealing with a union which

has his supervisors in it, who may be either frying to override
the rank and file membership in his favor, or undermine him in
the employee’s favor, contrary to the legislative intent which
has been specifically set out backing up these 47 amendments
to provide a balance between employer and employee.
Q

Bo you think the National Labor Relations Board

counts the ballot of a supervisor when it comes to an election
on the union?
NR. STOCKTON:

They ruled him out of the body of the

union insofar as -~

Then, I take it, you are relating their acts -- these

proposition., that when the foreman,or other supervisor, joins,the
union, he may b* giving aid and comfort to the union and

26
indicating an employer attitude in favor of the union, as far

M* STOCKTON:

other possibilities.

That’s one possibility.

But there are

For example, this legislative history says

that no one, whether employer or employee, needs to have as his
agent one who is obligated to the other side.

This legislative

history makes it clear that the conflict is recognised by
Congress in enacting -- in taking supervisors out of the
National Labor Relations Act

in enacting 14(a), and that it

relates to the day to day activities and the possibility of
domination of the union by the supervisor and member of the
union- And says, specifically, evidence before the committee
shows clearly that unionising supervisors, under the Labor Act,
is inconsistent with the purpose of the Act.
Q

What would be the posture of a foreman, these

particular men, supervisors, if a strike were called?

What

would be their obligations with respect to the picket line?
Most unions have a penalty for a member who crosses a picket
line.

Would these supervisors be subject to that?
MR, STOCKTON:

I don’t know the answer, Your Honor,

but L think the question reveals the problems that

and the

fact that we are, actually, dealing with questions of collective
bargaining when you give a State court a right to give a remedy
aocl State court damages in this type of situation.
I might make this point.

If the State right»to-work

21
law is not pre-empted, as to these supervisors, then, insofar
as Interstate commerce employers

employers within the scope

of the Act -- the only people protected would be the supervisors.
The employees are obviously out.

They are within the national

Labor Relations Act.
Q

I notice that Mr. Eubanks' brief, at page 3, has a

short paragraph, third from the bottom.

"The union began an

organising campaign at defendant’s Winston-Salem, Worth
Carolina, stores in the spring of 1971.

In the course of that

organising campaign, the three petitioners named herein signed
a membership application to join the union and were accepted
into membership In April and May of 1971,

There is no evidence

that they actively engaged in any pro-union activity,"
Do you accept that as an accurate statement of facts?
MR, STOCKTON:
here.

Well, if Your Honor please, the case is

This statement made by Mr. Eubanks is a statement he

makes.
Q

The case is here, actually -No.

I am asking you if that accurately states --

MR, STOCKTON:

I don't accept that as the actual facts.

I say to the -~
Q

Did they engage in any other pro-union activity?
MR, STOCKTON:

Yes, sir.

In my judgment, they did.

It is not really in the record before this Court because it
comes on before this Court on the pleadings and affidavit, so
that —

Q
it to

you

Let's essurae that the — well, perhaps I should put
this way:

Is it your position, that standing alone,

the fact that during an organising campaign they signed a
membership application to join and were accepted into membershi
is it your position that standing alone,that brings you within
the proviso of 14(a) as employees for the purpose of any law
relating to collective bargaining?
MR. STOCKTON:

Well, if Your Honor please, I would

hate to restrict it that closely, but I think —
Q

I know.

I ask you whether standing alone you would

take that position?
MR. STOCKTON:

I would take that position, and I

think that's what the Supreme Court of North Carolina has said,
because of the overriding legislative intent to discourage
unionisation of supervisors, clearly evidenced at the time of
the enactment of the 1947 amendments.
Q

I asked Mr. Eubanks about whether or not an employer

could be or would be, under the law, under the National Labor
Relations Act, compelled to bargain with a bargaining agent who
had supervisors as members?

Now, let’s assume that this union

won the election,as it did, and then, other things being equal,
it would be the bargaining agent.

But, now, the employer says

I will refuse to bargain with you because you have some of ray
supervisors as members.
reason ?

Now, is the employer excused for that

i#». STOCKTON:

I am very much afraid the employer

might have to bargain with that union.

I don't know the answer,

Your Honor.
Q

Hell, don't you think that the answer to that question

bears somewhat on the issue in this case as to whether he has
a right to fire or not?
Ml. STOCKTON:

It may, and it, again, indicates

the fact that State court action here is becoming intermeddled
in a field which should be pre-empted by the Federal courts.
Q

Would you be making this argument if the supervisors

had joined a union of their own and never asked for any
bargaining rights?
ME. STOCKTON:
Q

Yes.
MR. STOCKTON:

Q

And they were fired?

Yes, sir, Your Honor, because --

For the same reasons, or not?
ME. STOCKTON:

Well, possibly for other reasons.

I

think there is more conflict where they join the rank and file.
Q

Would you say the proviso of 14(a) gives you any

comfort in that respect, because the supervisors say we have

no interest in bargaining, we don’t want to bargain with you at
all, we are sort of a lodge.
ME. STOCKTON:

1 think 14(a) would be more of a

problem in that: situation, but here they are joined in the rank
and file union belonged to by the other employees of the saute

30
employer.
Q

Who are, and the union itself is a *•» in the business

of collective bargaining.
ME, STOCKTON:
Q

That’s correct.

Do you say, Mr. Stockton, that when these three

supervisors went to the union and asked the union to file a
complaint with the Labor Board for this conduct, that that was
engaging in union activity, to ask the. union to represent theta?
ME. STOCKTON:

1 hadn’t thought of that, Your Honor.

I suppose that could be argued.

They did go to the union.

The union filed a complaint for them.

They are »- it is union

activity in a common sense respect, I think, if Your Honor
please, without any question, and I think we could take that
position.
Q

On this record, do you have anything other than the

fact that they joined?

You don't have anything other than that,

do you?
MR, STOCKTON:
Q

No, sir.

On the record «-

Well, that’s all we have before us —
MR. STOCKTON:

That is correct.

The case came on

a motion on the pleadings, and the record is the allegation
that they were fired because they joined die union, which we
move to dismiss as not stating a claim upon which relief could
be granted.
Q

They could have resigned from the union the next day

31
so far as we know.
£•21. STOCKTON:

Well, that’s the record insofar as the

case is before this Court, if Your Honor please, and in the
procedural manner in which it came here it was the only way
it could be, actually.

q

That’s right.

Q

I am not sure I got fully your response to fche

posture of the business
strike.

fche supervisors in fche case of a

What: about fche picket line?

If they crossed it, the}'

would be fired from fche union, probably, wouldn’t they?
MR. STOCKTON:

If they crossed the picket line, yes,

sir, Your Honor.
Q

And they -Slight bo subject, to penalties from the union,

if the union provided for those penalties as they generally do.
MR. STOCKTON:
Q

That’s correct, Your Honor.

You say that’s a conflict with fche employer’s interest

to have a supervisor who is in that position?
MR. STOCKTON:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Arid the

Congress, throughout the hearings on these statutes, referred to
the conflict, the right to have a loyal supervisor, fche possible
conflict on the other side of the domination of fche supervisor
over the rank and file in a missed union.

And, fche situation

here would be *•Q

Fourteen (a), the first part of ifc says, "Nothing

herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor

»•>

from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organisation.n
So that bridge has been crossed by Congress, this
conflict business about belonging to a labor organization.
Ml. STOCKTOM:

If Your Honor please, the other part

is most important and the reports of the hearings males it
very clear that the supervisors do not need to be treated as
employees
Q

Don’t have to be bargained with.
MR. STOCKTON: That’s right, but that they don’t have,

any longer, the right to join a union which is protected by
the National Labor Relations Act.

They arc out of the Act.

They are restored to their rights before the Wagner Act accorded^as to what Senator Taft. said.
Q

How can you 3ay that, in view of the first section

of 14(a), which says, "nothing herein shall prohibit any
individual employed as supervisor from becoming or remaining
a member of a labor organization”?
MR. STOCKTON:

The legislative history says it, Your

Honor, and some of the cases say it.
Q

If there is a. conflict between the language of the

statute and the legislative history, which do you take?
MR. STOCKTON.:
to keep

Here is the point.

There is nothing

«and it said in here in some of the cases, toe, -**

not from this Court but from the Federal Court

nothing keeps

a supervisor from joining the union, but in the interest of the

33
balance of power la maintaining a loyal supervisory personnel,
nothing keeps the employer from firing him for union activity,
or for joining a union, I would say.
Q

And then you say he can be fired simply for joining

a union.
MR* STOCKTON:

I think we have to say it on this case,

on the record
Q

Well, that really means, according to you, that the

labor law, the Federal statute, guarantees to the employer the
right to fire any supervisor who joins a union.
MR. STOCKTON:

Well **«*
f

Q

Now, that’s pretty hard to take, isn't it, in view of

the first sentence of 14(a) that says, "Nothing herein shall
interfere with the right of a supervisor to join," -MR. STOCKTON:

No, sir, I don’t think it is, taken

in context with the entire statement, and taken in context with
that is the entire statement in 14(a), that the supervisor
does not have to treat him as an employee under the Act,

He’s

got a right to join the union, but the employer, on the other
side, has the right to treat him.not as an employee, at all.
He doesn’t have the protection of the- Act ****
Q

I understand that.
MR. STOCKTON:

not to be fired without — fired

for union activity or joining a union.
Q

Well, that may be so, but what you are saying is that

34
the Federal law also prevents the State from giving the super­
visor some protection, and in order to do that, you have to
say that the labor law guarantees the employer the right to
fire.
Ml. STOCKTON:
Q

I would not go that far.

Hell, then, how do you pre-empt State law?
MR* STOCKTON:

Well, you pre-empt State law simply

because the -«of the conflict created between the State
and the Federal.
Q

There is no conflict unless Federal law guarantees

the right to fire.

The State says,

you don’t have the right

i' you fire, you are going to be sued for **”* you may

be sued for damages.
MR. STOCKTON:

The Federal says, though, you don’t

have to treat him — supervisory employee -«• as an employee.
Q

Put it in any words.you want to, you are saying the

Federal statute guarantees the employer the right to fire,
as against any contrary provision of the State?
MR. STOCKTON: No, sir, X am saying the State law
is pre-empted in this particular field, and that to create a
right of action, civil damage right of action, would create
all the problems that Congress has talked about in the legis- ■
lative history, and that 1 say the latter part of 14(a) is in
there to provide against.

For example, in this particular case,

the employer would be subject to the Federal law as to employees,
t

35
the State law as to supervisors.

The supervisors would be

subject to State law, and the employees would he subject to
Federal law.

So that you would have the resulting absolute

conflict between Federal and State law in situations in which
Congress has indicated and this Court has indicated there should
be some uniform approach, a Federal labor policy.

And we say

that under the previous cases, Hanna, Mining, is the opposite of
this case.

And I think I got into that for a moment.
Hanna Mining threw our Court of Appeals off because

they took, the position that supervisors were involved, so
Hanna Mining says no pre-emption of the State, so that’s what
we hold.

Hanna Mining did not hold that, as 1 attempted to

explain a few minutes ago.
Our position is, if it please the Court, that under
the Federal, statutes, under the underlying purpose of a uniform
approach, Federal labor policy, under the cases on pre-emption
of this Court, that the Supreme Court of North Carolina is
correct, and that the State is pre-empted from applying this
particular statute as to supervisors in a State court damage
action.

m. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Ht. Eubanks, do you have anything further?
Let me begin by putting a question to you.
the supervisors at the time the organization

Suppose

activity began

went around to the employees with cards, asking employees to sign.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY L. EUBANKS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

Ml, EUBANKS:

I think they are engaging in union

activity and that would be insubordination in the interest of
the employer and they could be terminated.
Q

Let's take it one step removed.

Suppose the

supervisors just go around with the union business agent and
stand there and say nothing while they are soliciting?
MR. EUBANKS:

Your Honor, I think that would be

a closer question, but I still think they would be giving
comfort to the enemy to some extent.

And I think, the employer

is entitled to believe that his supervision would not participate
in. such conduct, but the employer owes an obligation, if I may
continue and explain this answer, owes an obligation to hie
what they sometimes later learn to be supervisors, to explain
to these supervisors that, look,if you want a union campaign,
you are our supervisor.

You see, in this particular case, you

have to remember that these three individuals, they just walked
up by some guy and he said here, sign this card, and they said
okay and signed it, and they have a hearing on the election
petition and they are found to be supervisors and that's all the
evidence.

No evidence of anything else.

They don't vote in the

election and the day after the election, they get fired.
Q

I take it that you concede that any activity which

could be regarded as aiding and assisting the union campaign

would be grounds for dismissal.
MR. EUBANKS:

Your Honor, I think that counts In

an appropriate factual context, I agree, but I do believe that
a person in a supervisory position is not any more entitled
or any less entitled to look after his own interests than
people getting paid by the hour,
Q

I don’t see the distinction.

The remedy there is to join a union of supervisors,

isn’t it?
MR, EUBANKS:
not necessarily.

No, sir, because you have to remember "

You see, the factual context in which this

always comes up would generally be where the employee is
promoted up into a supervisory capacity.

And being a member

as an employee would accumulate certain retirement program,
benefits, and that sort of thing, and if he cancels his
membership in a year then he is going to lose his retirement
program, or whatever it might be.
Q

Well, that’s not our case -- point here, is it?
MR. EUBANKS:

No, but the reason I am making this

point to the Court is that if, at that point, he’s got to quit
or be fired, leave the union or be fired, he's put in a
situation of having to give up.
Q

Well, don’t we have an unresolved, possibly, an

unresolved factual question here, namely, whether the conduct
of these supervisors, in whatever they may have done, signing
the card, talking to people, whatever, whether that constituted

aiding and assisting the union's organisation campaign?
MR. EUBANKS:

How, I pray the Court to read exactly

Your Honor, I think that f hat5s the whole point the

that.

Superior Court missed and the Supreme Court missed.
an opportunity to try the case on its merits.

Me

want

If it is proven

before a jury and before a court that these three plaintiffs
did, in fact, sponsor the union, went out and got people to sign
for it, traveled around with the union organiser, or did any o£
those things, that he and any rational man knows is not in the
best interest of the employer, provided he knows he is a
supervisor, then I think that he’s got grounds to fire a man
because the man should owe the employer some loyalty.
But, in the status of this case right now, you’ve
got a situation where three individuals, all they did was sign
a card, and I think people have a right to do that sort of thing
I submit to the Court that the Constitution and the
law and just common sense give us the right to do that.
Q

Mr. Eubanks, suppose the vice president in charge of

personnel, joined the union to which the majority of his employee
also belonged, and which was the collective bargaining agent for
the company, but also assume that this vice president said,
of course, I am not going to take any part in negotiating with
the union.

Under your submission, would the company be entitled

to discharge him?
MR. EUBANKS:

Yes, sir.

39
Q

Why?

Mi. EUBANKS:

I believe the employee would fee

entitled, at that point, to refuse to bargain with the union,
so long as they kept that individual a member of the union
which represented rank, and file.
Q

I have no problem with that.

I assume that he took no part in the bargaining.

He said, "I'm not going to have anything to do with that.
My duties relate to the personnel for this plant.

Somebody

else can bargain."
MR. EUBANKS:

I have no doubt that the employee would

have every right, at that point, to refuse to bargain with the
union, and I think that's exactly what 14(a) says.

Q

Suppose he were the executive vice president?

Nothing to do with personnel.

MR.

EUBANKS:

I don't believe it would matter, Your

Honor, if he were president, except subject to the -- making
the last decision in the company.
Q

Wait a minute.

I don’t understand you.

The

executive vice president could not foe discharged if he belonged
to the union?
MR. EUBANKS:

No, Your Honor.

I don't contend -*•

as I understood the question, that that was what could the
what right did the company have at that point?

I think the

company could say, look, to the supervisor,, as the case might
be, I believe that your interest in belonging to the union of

the rank and file gives me grounds to not recognise this union
and bargain with it for my rank and file.
clearly says that.

And I think 14(a)

Insofar as the right of being discharged

-- if the evidence is that all he did was join, Your Honor, I
submit to this Court that they would have to say to him more
or prove more than the fact that he just did like these three
men did, sign the card.

'I believe it takes more than that,

because I believe people have a right to do that.
Q

You don’t think the North Carolina statute applies

the biblical injunction against serving two masters?
MR, EUBANKS;

Your Honor, I certainly do not,

I

certainly submit to this Court, and to you, Your Honor, that
there is hardly an organizational situation where there is
organised labor in the State I'm from, North Carolina, or in
any other State, in which supervisors are not members of a
union, one or more of them, in any size company.

Not necessarii

to get bargaining rights, or anything like that, because they
came up through the ranks.

Yes, sir, 1 don't agree that being

a member of a union is inimical to being loyal to say employer,
I don't believe it.
I thank you very much.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
{Whereupon, at 1:50 o’clock p.m., the case in the
above"entitled matter was submitted.)
