MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Halvonik?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL N. HALVONIK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS, THOMAS TONE STORER, ET AL.
MR. HALVONIK:
Justice:

May it please the Court, Mr. Chief

My name is Paul Halvonik.

for the appellants here.

I am one of the attorneys

The other attorney for appellants is

on my left here, Mr. Remcho.
30 minutes, and Mr. Remcho 10.

I will consume 20 of the allotted
I would like to speak first fir

15 minutes and then reserve 5 for rebuttal, if I may.
The appellants in these cases are candidates for
public office and their supporters.

All of the candidates are

unaffiliated with political parties recognized by the State of
California.

That is to say none belong to any political party

that has a place on the California ballot.

They brought suit

to obtain ballot space last general election.
Q

You mean recognized —

MR. HALVONIK:

That's right, there is no line for

them on the California ballot.

Two of the appellants are

members of the Communist Party, but the Communist Party is not
a recognized party in California.

The other two appellants,

Storer and Frommhagen, belong to no political party at all in
any sense of the word.

5

In California, people who are not members of political
parties are deemed "declines to state" and are independents in
that sense, and so we have two sets of independents, genuine
independents, and people who are independents because their
political party isn't recognized in the state.
They brought suit to obtain space on the

ballot as

independents and challenged the restrictive scheme of the
California election law for regulating independent access.
scheme in brief is this:

The

They have to obtain five percent of

the registered voters, the signature of the registered voters
in a 24-day period, that period begins long after the primary
elections, August 15, and ended on September 8.

No one could

sign one of those petitions who voted in a primary, even though
nonpartisans vote in California primary elections.

They are

given a nonpartisan ballot that doesn't have such offices as
Congressman and Senator on it but has ballot propositions and
local officers, county and city, which are nonpartisan officers
in California.

You can't have a party designation for those

officers.
Q

Now, what you are getting into now is something

that I didn't quite understand from my reading of the briefs.
A person can go into a Republican primary and vote, say, say it
is a Republican primary, and it i^ould be true about a Democratic
primary, and vote although he declines to state that he is a
Republican in the one case or a Democrat in the other.

And does

6
he vote for a —
MR. HALVONIK:
Q

No.

What does he vote for in the Republican Party?

MR. HALVONIK:

In a primary election you have a

Democratic primary, a Republican primary, two other primaries.
Additionally there are ballot propositions, numbering usually
somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty each year, about twenty
ballot propositions, dealing with all kinds of legislation.
Q

That is to put issues onto the ballot at the

general election?
MR. HALVONIK:

Decide legislation, you decide legis­

lation in California by ballot.
Q

You do that at the primary election and not the

general election?
MR. HALVONIK:
Q

At both.

Either one?

MR. HALVONIK:

Yes, they appear on both ballots.

They

are diferent time periods, and sometimes you make a June ballot
and sometimes a November ballot.

The June ballot comes out at

the primary election, but the nonpartisan is a person who is
not registered with any political party —
Q

I see.

MR. HALVONIK:

— goes down to the place where he

casts his ballot and is given what is called a nonpartisan
ballot, and on that will appear all the ballot propositions.

7
Partisan officers, what are called partisan officers in
California do not appear on that ballot.

That is, he doesn't

vote for anybody for Congress or Senate or President, but he
votes if the election is coterminous for such officers as city
councilman and supervisor on that ballot.
Q

Which are nonpartisan?

MR. HALVONIK:

Which are nonpartisan.

And so you

have a person who goes to the primary election and casts a
ballot and under the California election scheme, although they
haven't participated in the partisan primary, they are not per­
mitted to sign nominating petitions
Q

for independents.

Because he voted at what is a primary election

held on the same day as a primary election, although it itself
is not a primary election?
MR. HALVONIK:

Is that right?

It is not by most persons' terms a

primary: election, although it is so-called in California.
Q

Well, I have always understood a primary elec­

tion to be one where there are candidates for the nomination of
a particular party and I vote for one or other of the candi­
dates.

But that is not what you are talking about?
MR. HALVONIK:

No.

No, California is a bit different.

In the early part of the century there was a great rebellion
against the party system and California set up a cross-filing
system so that people who belong to one party could run in the
other, it removed any party designation from the ballots at

8
local elections.

It set up the initiative in referendums so

that these ballot propositions appeared at that time.
Q

I know, but at the time of the election —

MR. HALVONIK:
Q

THey kept calling it a primary election.

But at the election we are talking about, there

were candidates for nomination in both the Republican and the
Democratic Parties or perhaps other parties for some things.
MR. HALVONIK:
Q

Yes.

And in addition to that there were these non­

partisan things that you speak of.
MR. HALVONIK:

Partisan ballots which Storer, one of

the appellants here, cast —
Q

But it is still called a primary election, is it?

MR. HALVONIK:
Q

Yes.

And anyone who voted, if he voted only on the

matter of those initiatives or whatever those propositions were,
that then disqualified him from signing one of these petitions
after August 15, is that it?
MR. HALVONIK:

The code section so reads and that is

what the lower court held.
Q

So the voter on primary election day, when he

goes dotim to the polling place, and he can say I am a Republican,
in which case he is given a ballot containing the various
aspirants for — to be nominated by the Republican Party, plus
the issues and nonpartisan candidates, or he can say I am a

9

Democrat in which case he gets the Democratic ballot plus the
issues, or he can say I decline to state in which he gets only
the latter?
MR. HALVONIK:

That’s right.

That's it, exactly,

although he would make his declaration before election day.

He

has to be registered before then.
Q

I see.

MR. HALVONIK:

Well, anyway, those people are excluded

from signing the petition and the appellant Storer is also,
since he cast a nonpartisan ballot, excluded by virtue of that
from running for office as an independent; and further he is not
permitted to run as an independent because some ten months
before the general election he was registered as a Democrat,
and California requires you, if you have been a member of a
political party, to wait 17 months before an election before
you can be an independent.
Q

Is that what it says, 17 months?

MR. HALVONIK:

Well, it is a period 12 months before

the primary election, and then you add the five months between
the primary and the general, and it comes out at about 17 months.
Q

But that is before you can be a candidate, not

before you can vote in a primary, isn't it?
MR. HALVONIK:

Before you can run as an independent

candidate —
Q

A candidate.

10

MR. HALVONIK:

— you have to purge yourself of any

party affiliation some 17 months before the general election.
Q

Before you can be a candidate as an independent.

MR. HALVONIK:

Right.

And Storer here sought — and

there is an affidavit in this — he sought to get his nominating
papers out, and they told him he couldn't have them because he
had been a registered Democratic within the preceding 17 months.
Q

Right.

MR. HALVONIK:
Q

Now, this —

Could I ask, to what does the 5 percent in number

apply?
MR. HALVONIK:

It is the entire vote in the area.

So

if you are running for Congress, it is 5 percent in your con­
gressional district, 5 percent of the people who voted at the
last general election.

If you are running statewide, it is 5

percent of the entire vote in the state.
Q

Well, now, for the purposes of the cases we have

before us, what was the elimination from the 5 percent by virtue
of having' voted at a primary election, in numbers?
MR. HALVONIK:

Well, it is our estimate, and it was

the estimate of the Secretary of State at the time the election
was being held, that about 70 percent of the people would vote
in the primary.
Q

You have to get then 5 percent of the total out

of the 30 percent?

11
HR. HALVQNIK:

That is correct, although of course

you can get additional registration, go out with the registra­
tion book and get additional people to register, if you are in
a district with very low registration.

That is one way where

you can conceivably meet these requirements.

In fact, after

we brought this suit, somebody did, a man named Raul Ress, in
the 40th District Assembly of California, which is the smallest
assembly district, where all he needed as 1,800 signatures, a
large Chicano population, and averaging an assembly district,
which is half a congressional district, about, is 4,500 signa­
tures needed.

He needed but 1,800 signatures, very low

registration, went into Chicano communities and promoted him­
self as a La Raza candidate and was able to make the ballot,
the only one as far as we knoxv7 who ever made it under the
current California independent provisions.
The system is justified by the State of California
on the grounds that it makes for a manageable ballot in size,
and their justification, we contend, is transparently unten­
able because the state also points out a few times you could
have a hundred political parties in California.
at the moment.

There are four

Actually, mathematically, it is possible to

have more than one-hundred.

And so the interest in a manage­

able ballot only occurs when you don't want to be affiliated
with a political party, the old party staying on if they have
one-fifteenth of one percent of the registered vote and if

12
they collected only two percent of the vote in the last elec­
tion.

A new party need collect just one percent of the elector­

ate as registered voters in its party and it gets a place on
the ballot.

So the manageable ballot excuse won’t go, and the

state then justifies the provision on the grounds that it may
legitimately promote political parties as distinguished from
independents and even keep independents off of the ballot if it
wishes, and that is where we take issue with the state.
The First Amendment to the United States Constitution,
as we understand anyway, is supposed to promote-a free market
place of ideas, and a statutory system valid in design to restrain
trade and ideas does not seem to us to comport with the First
Amendment but to affront it.

We are dealing here with a funda­

mental right, the right to vote, and the ballot — we are
speaking of the right to vote in First Amendment terms, this is
a quote referred to in Williams v. Rhodes — is sort of a forum,
and while the state, when it opens the forum, in this case the
ballot being the forum that is opening, even though it needn't
open the forum, once it opens the forum it has to use neutral
principles to decide who gets access to that forum.

It can't

decide on the basis of preferred political content or preferred
political associations who get on the ballot.

But that is what

California does, and that is what California claims it is
doing.
Q

Mr. Halvonik, do I understand from what you have

13
just said that you’re posing your case basically on First Amend­
ment principles and not at all on equal protection?
MR. HALVONIK:

Well, it is equal protection principle

that is related to First Amendment principle.

Under the equal

protection idea is when one opens up a park, for instance, a
city maybe doesn't have to build a park, but once it does, if
it is going to issue permits for speakers in the park it has to
issue them in a neutral manner.

And that is sort of the combin­

ation of the equal protection and First Amendment values I
should think.

But we are relying on equal protection of the

laws, that is the basic claim for this, that the state, once it
provides ballot space has to do it in an even-handed manner,
and this is connected and interrelated with the First Amendment
question of political neutrality in deciding what standards are
used to get on the ballot.
0

You are claiming a denial of freedom of associa­

tion here, as I understand it.
MR. HALVONIK:

The state discriminates against people

who seek ballot positions because they don't have

particular

kinds of associations.
Q

And the answer to that is not that — he is

merely asked to forego the vote and he can associate all he
wants to?
MR. HALVONIK:

Has to forego getting on the ballot

— yes, he can forego all the wants to, and the state merely

14
penalizes him by moving him from the process and removing him
— and removing his supporters from the electoral process ef­
fectively and forced to have on their ballots only those can­
didates who they don't wish to support.
Q

Well, this sounds to me. more like 14th Amendment

than First, I think, but —
MR. HALVONIK:

Well, I think the First is helpful this

way, Mr. Justice Blackmun, in deciding what standard is then
used to determine who is being irrationally discriminated
against, and we maintain that the First Amendment sort of stand­
ard applies here, the close scrutiny standard, and that what we
are involved in is the exercise of the fundamental right, First
Amendment rights, as amended in this Court's opinion in Williams
v. Rhodes.
The discriminatory system against those unaffiliated
with political parties is reflected not just in the ballot direct
access question but in the statutes which prohibit it historic­
ally from being on the ballot.

We've already discussed his

casting of a partisan primary ballot excluding them from he
party, and I mentioned also that he was excluded because he
hadn't been a member of a — he,had been a member of a political
party in the preceding 17 months, and we contend that there is
no justification for that provision.
It is one thing to require somebody to be a member of
a party for a certain amount of time before he may run as that

15
party's candidate to establish his adherence to whatever general
principles that party may have, but an independent by defini­
tion you are saying he is not associated with any group of po­
litical ideas, associated with any particular political party.
The State of California says, well, when he goes he is splinter­
ing the party, but splinter is just a jeorative for independent.
And I would think political party cannot stand people disaffectt

ed leaving the party, cannot stand the competition at the ballot
when these people meet reasonable qualifications to get on the
ballot, the political party perhaps doesn't have wares the
people want to buy, and I don't see where the state has a
legitimate interest in insulating
what it would term splinters.

that political party from

I don't know who decides what

the splinter is.
Q

Did you argue this case in the Seventh, too?

MR. HALVONIK:

Mr. Remcho argued it that time, Mr.

Justice Douglas.
Q

Oh, for Mr. Storer?

MR. HALVONIK:

Yes, for Mr. Storer and Mr. Roche

appeared for the state at that time.
Q

And. you thought the law was so well settled that

I should put him on the ballot forthwith?
MR. HALVONIK:

Well, we hoped it was that way.

don't know that it was our hope that it was well settled.

I
We

felt that it followed pretty much from Williams v„ Rhodes that

16
they were entitled to a ballot position, and we thought further
that the state couldn’t make the manageable ballot argument be­
cause, as we pointed out, the interest only arises when you are
unaffiliated with a party, it is a four-party state, and we
felt further that the state can’t maintain that it has a legit­
imate interest in promoting political parties, people affiliated
with them to the exclusion of those who have no political party
affiliations.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You are now to Mr. Remcho's

time.
MR. HALVONIK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Remcho.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH REMCHO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS GUS HALL, ET AL.
MR. REMCHO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
First, in response to Mr. Justice Douglas' question —
Q

I was just refreshing my recollection.

MR. REMCHO:

Okay.

We thought at the time, at any

rate, that the irreparable injury, that there was no injury to
the state but there would be injury to Storer in that case.
I am addressing myself to the issue that independent
candidates, to get on the ballot, may not have been a member of
a political party for the preceding
voted at the preceding

primary.

17 months, and may not have

In our view, that adds

17
qualification for the California Legislature to those set forth
in Article I, section 2.

In this Court, in Powell v. McCormack,

said that the national legislature may not add to those quali­
fications age, citizenship and inhabitancy.

If the national

legislature cannot, surely the state may not, and in fact the
appellees have conceded this point.
They argue, however, that a person can be elected to
Congress in two other ways besides meeting those additional
qualifications.

That is, they argue you can be a party candi­

date or that he can succeed at a write-in, on the write-in in
the California election.

These possibilities really in our

view constitute merely alternative qualifications.
To restate the California scheme, a person, to become
a member of Congress, must either first be a member of a recog­
nized political party, that is the party route; second, must
not have been a member of the party for the preceding 17 months,
and further had not have voted, this is this independent route
we are challenging; or, third, he must run as a write-in
candidate, with no chance of success in California.
I think the issue this Court will want to address it­
self to is the validity of the write-in as an option.

I think

it can be viewed in one of two ways, either it is that alter­
native qualification that a person must be so widely supported
by people in California that he can gain election even when his
supporters have to write in and the supporters of others may

18

merely go down and check them, mark them in a voting machine.
Or, secondly, we can say that the party route and the independ­
ent route are the additional qualifications for Congress, and
that the alternative which the state provides is really an un­
realistic alternative, it is impossible an alternative under
current California procedure.
The appellees attempt, I think, to show that there is
a write-in alternative really shows quite the opposite.

The

only example they can come up with is the case in which a person
who was a Democratic incumbent and already on the ballot for the
Democratic primary won a Republican primary by write-in when no
one was on the Republican ballot.
by write-in.
Q

That is, someone had to win

There was no other way to do it.
Mr. Remcho, if you are right on the ooint you

are aruging here, then wasn't Lippit v. Cipollone wrongly de­
cided?
MR. REMCHO:

I think the Court in Lippit, that is the

lower court, Your Honor, did not address fully that issue of
Article I, section 2.
plored.
decided.

It was passed on, it was not fully ex­

I think I am correct, it was wrongly, maybe wrongly
Secondly, however, that is distinguishable from this

case in that in Lippit there was a fee, and I suppose arguably
the candidate in Lippit could have raised the fee, but in this
case he can't.
Q

But the Ohio rule was surely an added

19

qualification which the state couldn’t impose over and above
those set by Article I, just as much as the California qualifi­
cation.
MR. REMCHO:
Rehnquist.

I think that is right, Mr. Justice

I would say, number one, it was wrongly decided.

This Court dismissed on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction,
did not —
Q

No, I think it summarily affirmed.

MR. REMCHO:
case.

Excuse me, I am thinking of the other

But I think that can be distinguished here because there

is no way that Storer can get away from California’s requirement,
that is, having voted, having exercised his franchise and having
been a member of the party, he is now further incapable of get­
ting on the ballot in California, whereas in Lippit at least
someone else could have come in and said here is the money and
you can go.
Again, as to the write-in alternative, this Court, in
Classic, United States v. Classic, which extended what it con­
sidered to be a fundamental right to vote in congressional
elections, to primary elections, did so on the grounds that the
primary election so profoundly affected the general election —
Q

That opinion used the term fundamental right or

constitutional right?
MR. REMCHO:
Mr. Justice Brennan.

They used the term constituti <nal right,

20
Q

I wonder why you don't.

MR. REMCHO:

I will in the future.

But I think that

case, which also spoke of Article I, section 2, not specifically
to the qualifications but as one of the bases for that constitu­
tional right, did so because it dismissed the write-in because
the write-in procedure in the primary so profoundly affected the
election —
Q

That was a right there whose vote counted?

MR. REMCHO:

No, that is a case — that's right, to be

counted and also to be a candidate, Mr. Justice.
Q

United States v. Classic was a right of a voter

at a primary to have his vote counted.
MR. REMCHO:
Q

That is correct.

That is all that was involved.

MR. REMCHO:

I think not, Mr. Justice Marshall.

The

decision — this was a case in which to decide whether or not
the defendants in that case had violated a constitutional right.
?he Court said it had to meet two issues, first, whether or not
a voter had the right to have his ballot counted; and, secondly,
the Court did say that it had to meet the issue whether or not a
person had a right to be a candidate.

One might say that that

really wasn't necessary in the case.
Q

Right to be a candidate, the Classic case?

MR. REMCHO:

That's right, to be a candidate and to

have those counted for him.

21
I think further that — I think the issue has been
settled by Powell v. McCormack, and that Mr. Justice — excuse
me — Chief Justice Warren in that case gave some guidelines for
looking at cases of this sort, where qualifications are alleged.
And he said that even had the legislative history in that case
not been as clear as it was, and the constitutional history not
been as clear as it was, the Court nevertheless would have been
compelled to resolve any ambiguity in favor of a narrow con­
struction of the scope of Congress' power to exclude members,
because, in Hamilton's words, the people should choose whom
they please to govern them.

I think in this case any ambiguity

as to whether or not the write-in is an effective alternative
ought to be resolved in favor of the people's right to elect to
Congress those people whom they choose and not whom the
California Legislature chooses.
If there are no questions, I will reserve the re­
mainder of my time for Mr. Halvonik's rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Roche?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLAYTON P. ROCHE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. ROCHE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
Our basic position is completely different, of
course, than the appellants'.

The Appellants have very

22
studiously avoided this Court’s decision in Jenness v. Fortson,
and it is our position that we look to Jenness v. Fortson for
the guidelines as to how California's law and its constitution­
ality should be decided.
It is clear, when we look at California's law, that
California has preserved the fluidity of political life and has
not frozen the status quo.

That was the key to Jenness v.

FOrtson, as alluded to by appellants very rapidly as in their
argument.

California has not two parties but has four qualified

parties presently.

Besides the Democratic and Republican, we

have the American Independent Party and the Peace and Freedom
Party.

So obviously we are not at a Williams v. Rhodes situa­

tion, where the political life of California has been frozen
for the Democrats and Republicans.
Also, there has been little said about section 6430 of
the California Elections Code. We feel that section 6430 of the
Elections Code in and of itself, without even reference to the
independent nomination procedure, satisfies all the constitution­
al rights of the appellants and other electors in California.
Under said provisions, as have been explained, an old
party can remain on the ballot if it gets 2 percent of the pre­
vious vote.

Secondly, if they have 1 percent registration

135 days before the election, they also become a qualified
party.

Additionally, they can become a qualified party by get­

ting a petition with 10 percent of the number of voters at the

23

last gubernatorial election.
We also have the write-in process in all elections,
primary, general, state and local offices, federal office, and
the presidential elections.

So we haven't even gotten to the

independent nomination procedure, so obviously if any group of
electors wishes to organize and exercise their First Amendment
rights under the provisions of Section 6430 of the Elections
Code, they may do so as did the American Independent Party and
the Peace and Freedom Party in 1948.

Also in the past we have

had other qualified parties, as alluded to in our brief.

We

have the — in the fifties we had the — and into the sixties we had the Progressive — excuse me — the Prohibition Party
was a qualified party, and also for a while we had the — I
believe it was the Progressive Independent Party in the fifties
Q

And how many voters does it take to organize a

new party, Mr. Roche?
MR. ROCHE:

One-fifteenth of one percent?
One percent of the registration.

Now,

the one-fifteenth is an additional qualification to stay on the
ballot.

There is a provision in section 6430 that says if at

any time the registration falls within one-fifteenth of one
percent, then they are automatically off, no matter what they
got the last time.

Now, that is interesting from the point of

view that in Georgia, in looking at Georgia's five percent of
the last vote requirement, they could have had zero because
they don't have that added qualifications, and the Court still

24
upheld Georgia's five percent requirement in Jenness v. Fortson.
Q

I don't follow that.

MR. ROCHE:
Q

Well, in other words —

I mean, Georgia was more liberal, a party still

stays on the —
MR. ROCHE:

Well, a party can stay — that's right, it

— no, they could have zero, it would be more restrictive in
that even if they had zero registration, even if they had 20
percent, excuse me, not the five percent, the 20 percent of the
vote requirement for an old party to stay on.
Q

Yes.

MR. ROCHE:

Their registration could go down to zero

and they still would have been a qualified party.
Q

They are more liberal and less fluid.

MR. ROCHE:

So basically what X am saying is that with­

out reference to the independent nomination procedure itself, the
fluidity of political life is taken care of in California.

Now,

insofar as —
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume there right

after lunch, Mr. Roche.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 o'clock noon the Court was re­
cessed until 1:00 o'clock p.m.]

25

AFTERNOON SESSION - 1:00 O'CLOCK
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. ROCHE:

You may proceed, Mr. Roche.

Thank you, Your Honor.

As I was saying before lunch, I was outlining hoxtf under
the provisions of section 6430 of the California Election Code
the fluidity of political life is preserved without even refer­
ence to the independent nomination procedure which is solely
attacked in this particular law suit.
Additionally, of course, we have the write-in process
in all elections, so therefore we get to the question of what
scope of review should be used here, and it is our position
that in view of the fact that section 6430 takes in addition and
in conjunction with the write-in process already preserves the
constitutional rights of electors in California, that the
independent nomination procedure really essentially has — its
existence or no has very little impact upon the voters in
California, therefore under the test set forth by this Court
in Bullock v. Carter, the rational basis test should be used in
examining this provision instead of the close scrutiny test.
And in this regard, it would seem that we are essentially talk­
ing about a case which involves a barriers to candidacy as
opposed to the right to vote per se as found in such cases as
Carrington v. Rash and the Kramer case, the Cipriano case, and
so forth, which were direct infringements upon and direct
disenfranchisements.

26
However, despite the fact that we feel that only the
rational basis test need be used, we feel that even should we
examine the California independent nomination procedure in a
vacuum, so to speak, that each of its substantive provisions
are necessary to further compelling state interests of the state.
Now, taking these elements individually, we first of
all have the 5 percent signature requirement, section 6831.
Well, of course, this Court has recognized unqualifiedly that,
in Jenness v. Fortson, that a significant modicum of support is
proper to prevent proliferation of the ballot and to also pre­
vent confusion, deception and even frustration of our electoral
system.
Three-judge district courts have elevated this in it­
self to a compelling state interest.

For example, Bendinger v.

Ogilvie, which is cited in our brief, and Beller v. Kirk, which
was affirmed sub nom., as Beller v. Askew, by this Court.

In

fact, when you examine California's five percent requirement
vis-a-vis Georgia's five percent requirement, you will find that
California's five percent requirement is really about a three
and a half percent requirement, because Georgia uses a different
test.

Georgia used a test of all of the electors who were

qualified to vote at the last election, x^hereas California uses
the test of those people who actually voted for that office,
then using the 70 percent test that appellants use all the time,
that would come out to about a three and a half percent require-

27
requirement on Georgia's scale instead of a five percent re­
quirement.
Additionally, we point out that appellants apparently
do not seriously even contest the five percent requirement in
and of itself, and we presume it would be difficult for them to
do because of Jenness v. Fortson and cases such as — excuse
me, not Bendinger v. Ogilvie, it was Jackson v. Ogilvie, and
Beller v. Kirk.
Now, weaving on to 6830(c) of the California Election
Code, wherein it restricts the signatories to those who have
not voted at the primary election, now there is much discussion
as to what is a primary election in California.

Now, our posi­

tion below at the District Court level was that in California
the primary election held in June is in reality a series of
primary elections, essentially a consolidation of a group of
primary elections, one for each party.

Therefore, in 1972, we

would have had a primary election for four parties and a
separate primary election basically for declines to state.
Now, we have cited a case, a California case —
Q

When you say a series, all on the same day or

on —
MR. ROCHE:
Q

It is all at the same time and —

They all go to the same polling place, don't

they?
MR. ROCHE:

Yes, sir, but there are separate ballots

28
for each party and each party essentially holds its primary
election and then declines to state also nominate nonpartisan
officers, such as county supervisors and then, as was explained,
there are usually a proliferation of ballot propositions that
we all struggle with, at least twice a year.
Q

Mr. Roche, do I not detect a disagreement between

your position and that of your

opponents so far as participa­

tion in the nonpartisan primary leads to disqualification?
MR. ROCHE:

That was our position below, Your Honor.

I feel that —
Q

Is that your position here?

MR. ROCHE:

If required to sustain the constitution­

ality, that would be my position, yes, sir.
Q

Did I correctly detect your opponents' position

to be the contrary of this?
MR. ROCHE:

As I understand it.

Unfortunately, the

District Court considered the primary a single election.

It is

difficult to argue any purpose which would be served by exclud­
ing those who have voted the nonpartisan ballot at the primary
from signing an independent candidate's nomination papers.

It

is difficult to discern any particularly legitimate state in­
terest or compelling state interest in that regard.

But when you

get to those who voted at a partisan primary, well, certainly,
that is when we have the legitimate and compelling state inter­
ests that are being served by excluding them from signing an

29

independent nominee's papers.

These are basically related to

the maintenance of party integrity and party organisation which
had been recognized as compelling state interest.

The

validity of this type of provision has been upheld in two cases,
both of which have been affirmed by this Court, that is Jackson
v. Ogilvie, from Illinois, and the Socialist Workers Party v.
Rockefeller.
If the Court desires some examples, this is not ex­
actly a party rating statute, though it is somewhat analogous
thereto.

For example, if we didn't have this restriction, a

voter could belong to a particular political party, he could go
in and vote against the party's best candidate in the primary
and then go and attempt to further his own candidate at the in­
dependent nomination stage.
Q

Mr. Roche, am I correct that you have five ballots

at this primary?
MR. ROCHE:
Q

And four ballots are party ballots?

MR. ROCHE:
0

That is correct, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

And assuming there is a valid reason for prevent­

ing the persons that participate in a party part of the primary,
wouldn't that put a restriction on the person that doesn't vote
the party?
MR. ROCHE:
Honor.

I know of no reason to restrict it, Your

I mean I have to be candid on that point, and I wish the

30

District Court had made that distinction.
Q

Well, would you want us to strike that down, that

part of it?
MR. ROCHE:

Well, I would be happy if nothing was

struck down, Your Honor.
Q

I suppose you are interested in sustaining the

judgment that brought you up here?

But pursuing Justice

Marshall's question a little bit further, is it possible to
readily identify the people who have just voted, as Justice
Marshall suggested, on some of the other issues but not on any
of the —
MR. ROCHE:

Oh, yes, Your Honor, there are registration

lists posted right outside of the polls, and also the registra­
tion books have the registration or whether they declined to
state.
Q

That would mean checking the petitions against

those lists for verification.
MR. ROCHE:
Q

Yes.

Is that done routinely anyway?

MR. ROCHE:

Yes, I would presume so.

Actually, I

talked to the registrar of voters in Los Angeles County — and
this is not in the record, just off the record — we were talk­
ing about how they did it, and as I understand it their position
was that they counted people who voted a nonpartisan ballot at
the primary, in other words, they permitted them to sign the

31

independent nomination papers.

It is a matter of construction,

I believe, and it is a matter of law.

I don’t think it would

be necessary — you wouldn’t have to overturn the lower court's
decision because it is a pure matter of law and it is sustain­
able under existing California law.

We have this one case

cited in our brief, Schostag v. Cator I believe is the name of
the case, where the court explained that what we called the
primary is essentially a series or a group of primaries all at
the same time, held by the same election officers, and at the
same place.
Q

So, you see, you are telling us, do I understand

you correctly, you are telling us that despite what the Federal
District Court seemed to hold in this case, the California law
may be to the contrary?
MR. ROCHE:
Q

That's right, Your Honor.

Well, then, wouldn't this — if there is an

ambiguity, would this have been an appropriate case fot the
District Court to have abstained to get the California law
construed by the only courts qualified to do it, and that is
the California courts?
MR. ROCHE:

Well, Your Honor, I made the argument, it

was rejected, and we already have a construction at least —
Q

But by a federal court that isn't qualified •—

MR. ROCHE:

We also have an older construction by the

California Supreme Court that the primary is essentially a

32
number of primaries held at the same time.
Q

You mean a construction then contrary to the

holding of the District Court in this case?
MR. ROCHE:
Q

I think basically.

But not really on the point, not on this precise

issue, was it?
MR. ROCHE:
Q

Not with regard to —

I mean, the holding here was, by the District

Court, as I understand it at least, that because one of these
people had voted as an independent, refused to state, declines
to state voter at a so-called primary in which he didn't vote
in the party primary, for that very reason he is disable to run
as an independent candidate within the 17-month period, and you
say that is not the California lav/.

How are we to know?

We

have no power to construe the California statutes, none at all.
MR. ROCHE:

Well, let me put it this way:

If the

Court feels it necessary to uphold the constitutionality of the
independent nomination procedure, I would go for the construc­
tion that it is a series of primaries.
Q

I am suggesting to you that we, this Court

has

no power whatsoever to construe the meaning of a California
statute.

If it is clear, that is one thing, and we accept it.

But you and your adversaries seem to disagree as to what the
California lax\r is, and that is a disagreement that this Court
has absolutely no power to resolve.

That is for the California

33
courts.
MR. ROCHE:

Well, it seems to me that the California

courts, though not in this context, have sufficiently construed
it so that this Court could follow California lav/.
Q

But the three-judge District Court in this case

didn't so understand it.

It said very, very clearly on III of

the jurisdictional statement in the appendix, "Storer will be
barred from independent candidacy if he carried out his stated
intention of voting on nonpartisan matters in the June primary.
MR. ROCHE:

Well, that is how they construed it, yes,

sir.
Q

Is there any point made that the three-judge

District Court in this case that it should defer, should abstain
from reaching the constitutional issues here, pending a deter­
mination of what the California law is by the California courts?
MR. ROCHE:

No, Your Honor.

This is the normal situ­

ation we find ourselves in, where we find ourselves for a good
portion of the time in the Federal District Courts and the
courts may at this juncture be more prone to abstention, but
in the past it seems to me they haven't been.
Q

Well, it is about three weeks before the elction,

too.
MR. ROCHE:

That's right, Your Honor.

They had to get

a decision out awfully fast.
Q

If I might back up a minute, I am intrigued about

34

these five ballots.

The four-party was in the independent one.

How could that independent one be called a primary?
MR. ROCHE:
Q

Pardon?

The independent ballot at the "primary election"—

MR. ROCHE:

You see, we also have nominations for non­

partisan officers, and if a nonpartisan — a number of people
will file nomination papers, for example, for county supervisor,
district attorney, or other county officers, and if they receive
a majority of the votes cast at the primary they will be elected
and the primary is then transmuted into the general election and
they are declared elected.
Q

That is my problem.

How does that become a pri­

mary?
MR. ROCHE:

Because if nobody receives a majority of

the votes cast, then there will be a run-off election at the
general election, so it is also a nominating of election for —
Q

Well, are there primary ballots for independents

that don't have any candidates on, that just have propositions
on them?
MR. ROCHE:

Not that I — not what we would normally

consider the primary election, because at least in general all
counties, the county —
Q

Well, would you think it would be valid for the

State of California to say that anybody that votes in a bond
election cannot run for office?

35

MR. ROCHE:
Q

There is not much difference, is there?

MR. ROCHE:
Q

No.

No, not much difference, Your Honor.

Mr. Roche, let me ask you a question, going on.

I am having some conceptual difficulty.

As I remember Williams

v. Rhodes, this Court approached it on a standard of totality
of the circumstances.
MR. ROCHE:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

And as I remember the Jenness case, we did no

such thing, we approached it on provision by provision separ­
ately.

Do you think those cases are reconcilable in theory and,

if not, which path we should follow here?

I ask this because

you have been taking provision by provision as you have gone
along.
MR. ROCHE:

Oh.

Well, my basic position is that we

should examine California lav; in its totality as we have done
in Williams v. Rhodes and Jenness v. Forston, and that —
Q

I think it wasn't done in Jenness v. Forston.

MR. ROCHE:
Q

As I read it, it was, because —

Well, it doesn't make any difference.

In any

event, here you are arguing totality —
MR. ROCHE:

My recollection was that the Court ex­

amined the totality of the Georgia election laws and then showed
that they all lead to various alternative routes to the ballot,
the same as we say in California, we have all these various

36
alternative routes to the ballot also.

So that we just don't

isolate one and say, well, that one is unconstitutional.

What

we do is we look at California's law in its totality and deter­
mine whether or not the law totally, as a package, satisfies an
individual's constitutional rights to run for office and voters'
rights to vote for them.
Q

Well, if we do that, then why is it necessary to

argue as you are arguing now, to take up each provision separ­
ately?
MR. ROCHE:

Because if any of these particular pro­

visions should be considered onerous, we feel that we should be
able to isolate the unconstitutional from the constitutional and
sever whatever provision the Court might feel is unconstitutional
as the California Legislature would want under the severability
clause of our elections code.
For example, the Court has clearly approved five per­
cent requirements or less, but maybe the Court might feel that
the time requirement is a little too stringent, or they might
not agree with another provision with
not sign the petitions.

regard to who may or may

But what I am doing is showing that

even assuming we have to look at the independent nomination
procedure in the vacuum that its provisions further compelling
state interests.
All right.

As to section 6830(c) and (d) as they ap­

plied to the candidates themselves, that is the one where a

37
candidate cannot run as an independent candidate if he has
voted or if he has been affiliated with a qualified party for
one year, the basic thrust of these requirements are also to
preserve the integrity of our party system.
Now, they are part of a package in California which
insures at the primary stage that party rating does not occur.
There is a similar one-year provision as to candidates changing
between parties, in section 6401, and if you add that up, it
turns out to be more than a 17-month provision for them to
switch parties and run in another party.

And so by a parity of

reasoning, we are not arguing that these provisions are to pre­
vent party rating but they are analogous thereto.

We feel that

these party rating statutes, for example, in Lippitt v.
Cipollone, there was a four-year restriction as to a candidate.
Well, that is basically an objective test, and what we are say­
ing here is we have basically a one-year objective test to show
that the person is truly an independent and isn't striking off
on his own as a disgruntled member of a party to splinter the
party up at the general election stage, or you could have a
whole series of people striking out on their own and the party
system would just disintegrate if that were permitted.

.And the

cases such as those relied upon by the appellants are not in
point because they — such as Yale v. Curvin, and they were
cases involving restrictions as to voters.
Q

Is there really a problem, Mr. Roche, of

38

Republicans and Democrats desiring to vote as

independents in

order to nominate the weakest independent candidates, so that
the Republican or Democratic candidate might triumph at the
general election?

Isn't that how the analogy would go if you

are talking in terms of party rating?
MR. ROCHE:

That is how the analogy would be, yes.

Your Honor, but then there would also be, as I said, the possi­
bility of a large segment of a party being disappointed with the
nominee and say, okay, well, let's get candidate X and x^e will
run him as an independent and we will show them.
Q

That is a good argument as to the prohibition

against those who have voted in a party primary not nominating
an independent, but I take it isn't a very good argument as to
those who have voted nonpartisan not voting independent.
MR. ROCHE:
Q

No, unfortunately.

And then seek to sign a petition for an independ­

ent candidate, have they something like the equivalent of two
votes in the process?
MR. ROCHE:

That is correct, Your Honor, and that is

the case, as I pointed out, the idea is that if they could do
what they virtually had was two choices for office.
Q

There is no reason why not let a man vote in the

Republican primary first and the Democratic primary at the same
time.

Is that analogy —
MR. ROCHE:

Yes, Your Honor, that is very analogous.

39
Now, with regard to the 24-day requirement, this
serves the compelling state interest of letting the people know
who the party candidates are beforehand, and it insures that
current attitudes of the voters are reflected in the petition,
and it permits voters to know ahead of time what the party plat
forms are, because the party platforms in California are not
put together until sometime in August.
Now, as was pointed out, an independent did actually
run in 1972 for assembly in Los Angeles — my time is up.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Halvonik?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL N. HALVONIK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS, THOMAS TONE STORER, ET AL.
Q

Mr. Halvonik, what about that proposition, the

hypothetical question I put.

If a man has gone in and voted in

the Republican primary, let us say, and then he is dissatisfied
with the results of that primary, on your theory he should be
permitted to vote and to sign a petition for an independent?
MR. HALVONIK:
here though.

Well, there are two things going on

The independent can't start circulating his peti­

tion until late August, while the primary occurred in June, so
that in order to get five percent of the electorate to hang
around, you have got to convince them not to get involved back
in that process at all.

If California had a system which gave

40
the independents an equal crack at the same time —
Q

My question is do you think they should have two

bites at it, to vote in the primary of the Democrats or the
Republicans and then in effect get a "vote" by having his
signature on the petition function the same as a vote in a
primary?
MR. HALVONIK:

Well, I don't think it is unconstitu­

tional to have such a system, and Georgia has that system, but
I don't want to —
Q

Well, do you think that is unconstitutional?

MR. HALVONIK:

— require them to make a choice.

I

think it is unconstitutional to give the parties the advantage
of —
Q

You are suggesting it is unconstitutional, are

you not, to fail to allow that, that is if California does not
allow a man to vote in the Republican primary and then when
he doesn't like the results sign a petition for an independent
candidate, you are saying that is a violation of some constitu­
tional law.
MR. HALVONIK:

It is a violation because they won't

let the independent compete at the time of the primary.

If

they are not going to let the independent compete at that time
for that vote, then they can't very well say he is getting two
bites at the apple.

If they want to let the independent com­

pete at the same time —

41
Q

Is there anything to prevent the independents

from saying that "we are going to have a convention of inde­
pendents on the day of the primary, and don’t go to the
Republican, don't go to the general primary but come to our con­
vention and sign a pledge card that you will sign a petition —
MR. HALVONIK:

That is all very well if independents

were in fact like a political party, but they are not, there
are different kinds of people who are independents.

Mr.

Frommhagen doesn't get along with Mr. Hall at all, and he is
not going to get together with him at a convention.
of the independent is that they are not organized.

The idea
If somebody

wants to be an independent candidate, his supporters have an
equal opportunity to canvas and solicit people to sign nominat­
ing petitions at the time when these other people have the op­
portunity to have them go to the polls in the primaries, then I
would say you could make a distinction and say you have got to
make a choice.
Q

I am not —

MR. HALVONIK:

But what happens in California is the

man can't even circulate petitions until two months after the
primary, so he is completely taken out of that arena at the time
when the voters are most thinking about the issues.

The parties

are given this tremendous advantage, and it is argued that that
gives people, oh, make sure that they reflect current attitudes.
Well, the parties don't reflect any current attitudes, it has

42
been two years since an election in which they are relying to
stay on the ballot, and yet an independent can't appear in
January or February and start soliciting signatures for his
candidacy.

By then that independent fairly well knows what

the main issues are going to be in the following year, and
maybe that independent doesn't care who the candidates are.
Maybe that independent, like Tom Storer, just doesn't feel the
political parties at the moment are properly representing the
people, that they are too much dominated by interests who he
thinks are innimical to the benefit of the people in Marin
County.

He doesn't want to form a political party, he doesn't

care what happens in Orange County, at least he doesn't care
any more than he cares what happens in Klamath County up in
Oregon.

He is interested in Marin County, that is where he

wants to run.

We have a Congressman in the district below him,

McGloskey, who would like to run as an independent, he is a
Member of Congress and could win as an independent,

most

political experts think, but maybe he can't get through a
Republican primary.
Q

Did I understand you, that this man doesn't want

a party, doesn't want any backing?
MR, HALVONIK:
0

Doesn't he want to get elected?

MR, HALVONIK:
Q

Doesn't want any backing —

Pardon?

Doesn't he want to get elected?

43

MR. HALVONIK:
Q

Yes, he wants to get elected.

Without any backing?

MR. HALVONIK:

Well, without a political party's

backing.
Q

Well, if he gets backing, won't there be a party?

MR. HALVONIK:

Well, it won't be a party under the

terms that he conceives of a party, if he gets a group of
people behind him to support him that are not connected with an
on-going institutional group tied to particular interests, he
feels he can win.

He doesn't want

to be tied to those inter­

ests, he would rather lose, but it is not a gesture candidacy,
he is a genuine candidate, as Mr. McCloskey would be running as
an independent, and McCloskey would probably win.

For sure, it

is very likely he would win in his district, because it is
Democratic district, in which he has won as a Republican con­
stantly.
I wonder if I could just briskly on a couple of other
points.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked whether Lippitt was not in­

consistent with our position that requiring you not to have been
a member of a party for a year and a half violated Article I,
section 2.

The issue was never raised in Lippitt.

There is

another distinction in Lippitt in that we were talking there
about a party primary, so we don't know in Lippitt, at least
from what occurs in the lower court opinion, whether that
person was absolutely foreclosed from appearing on the general

44
election ballot, or just foreclosed from appearing as a
Democratic nominee.
But here we have somebody absolutely foreclosed be­
cause he belongs to a class from which he can't escape.
Q

Well, of course, your argument of Article I,

section 2 isn't absolute foreclosure, it is burdening or increas­
ing, and it seems to me they are the same on that point, whether
you might reach a different result because of the foreclosure
argument or not.
MR. HALVONIK:

Well, what I am saying, in Lippitt the

issue was raised essentially as an equal protection one, and you
can go into all kinds of balances at that point.

But Article

I, section 2 doesn't allow for balance, if it is a qualifica­
tion then the states can't add it, and that issue wasn’t raised
in Lippitt, and cases do not stand for propositions that weren't
raised.

I think that goes for Lippitt, it goes for Miner v.

Happisset, which is sort of the dread scot of women's libera­
tion.

That did not involve the equal protection clause which

is the principal clause we rely on.
immunities case•

That is a privilegesrand

So that case, which seems to be the only one

to suggest that voting is not a constitutional right protected
at least in congressional elections, that case doesn't go to
the principal issue.
On that point, Justice Marshall raised the question
about whether Classic involved the right of a candidate to run

45
for office.

It is on page 309 of 313 U.S.

It says they were

charged with interfering x*?ith the free exercise of the right
of candidates to run for the office of Congressman, and to
have —
Q

And to have the votes counted.

MR. HALVONIK:
Q

Right.

But there was more than one running for office in

that case.
MR. HALVONIK:

No, it was a group — it was a section

1920 case, it was a criminal prosecution for people interfering
with the rights of those candidates to run for office.
Q

No, no, right of the people to vote.

MR. HALVONIK:

Well, I would say, Your Honor, at page

303 it is the right of the candidates to run for office.
Q

I just read the xvhole case, for the fourteenth

Their response was filed on

they filed their response and did not raise the abstention

That was after the election, wasn't it?

MR. HALVONIK:

No, it was August 18, 1972.

Well, the election was in November?

MR. HALVONIK:

Yes.

abstention was raised below, doesn’t it appear here, as was
disclosed by my Brother Blackmun, that there is an argument be­
tween you and your brothers on the other side as to what the
California law is?

At least with respect to the man who voted,

refused — what do you call him — declines to state —
MR. HALVONIK:
Q

Declines to state.

— declines to state in a primary as to his

eligibility to run as a candidate?
MR. HALVONIK:
Q

I don't really —

And you seem to disagree as to what the California

law is, and as you well know, that is a questionwe cannot re­
solve.

We have no power to.
MR. HALVONIK:

When I brought the case, I had to as­

sume that the language in the code section meant what it said,
and I had

to attack that section.

And then Mr. Roche came in

and found that he couldn't come up with any justification for
that section and says it doesn't mean that, and I said that is
fine with me, let's not argue about it.

However, the District

47
Court ignored the concession and so here we are.
Q

I know.

MR. HALVONIK:

Now, it seems to me that if you inter­

pret it in any way other -- if you interpret it the way the
District Court interprets it, it is clearly unconstitutional.
Nobody can come up with a justification for it.
that if the state tells you that

It seems to me

it ought to be interpreted

the other way, you don't have any real problem of abstention.
Q

I don’t know what your California law is in this

respect, but I would guess maybe that Mr. Roche is hardly
authorized to tell us that a statute means something other than
what it appears to say.
MR. HALVONIK:

Well, I suppose the only answer is that

if, as I contend, that it is clearly unconstitutional, is to
hold it unconstitutional and if the state court wants to say you
made an error in the way you read it, it can do that and revive
it.
0

Well, that is not the only alternative.

Another

alternative would be to remand the case to get an authoritated
construction from the California courts as to —
MR. HALVONIK:

Well, one

difficulty with that is that

we didn't file the suit three weeks before the eiction.

The

fact of the matter is we have got another election coming up in
1974, now if we go back and we abstain and we have got to go to
the Superior Court of California and appeal that to the Court of

40
Appeals, effectively we are talking about a couple of more years
of litigation, and we are talking about a very fundamental
right here, and I don't know that when you are talking in this
election context about the very fundamental rights that if the
states come up with an ambiguity — I don't agree that it is an
ambiguity, but if the state wants to create an ambiguity by
saying that is not what we meant, I don't think they can by that
ploy force us past another election without knowing whether we
can run on a ground somewhat equivalent with the parties, you
know, some sort of parity, people who are not affiliated with
a political party, so that they are not invidiously discrim­
inated against.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think your time is up,

Mr. Halvonik.
MR. HALVONIK:

It is indeed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Thank you, gentlemen.
