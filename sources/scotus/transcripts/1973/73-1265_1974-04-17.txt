MR.- CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-1265, Saxbe against the Washington Post.
Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
(

MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
The respondents, the Washington Post Company and
reporter Ben Bagdikian, brought this action in the District
Court for the District of Columbia challenging, as a violation
of the First Amendment, the Federal Bureau of Prisons policy
prohibiting members of the press from obtaining personal
interviews with preselected inmates.
Petitioners here, the Attorney General and Mr.
Carlson, the Director of the United States Bureau of Prisons,
were defendants below.
In the court below the plaintiff-respondents'1
complaint sought, by way of declaratory judgment, an injunctive
relief to gain access to any and all inmates in the Federal
Prison System.
Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals,
however, gave more limited relief in which the presumption

4
appears to be, according to the relief granted, that press
interviews will be allowed unless there are serious
administrative or disciplinary problems likely to result.
That order of the District Court was, as I say,
affirmed with slight modification by the Court of Appeals.
The positions of the parties, 1 think, have shifted
slightly in this Court.

Respondents now adopt and defend

the decision of the Court of Appeals, and I have informed
this Court and will mention again that the Bureau of Prisons
will soon promulgate a new policy which prohibits interviews
of preselected inmates only in those institutions where the
Bureau deems it essential, that is, maximum and mediumsecurity institutions.
All other institutions, prison farms, halfway
houses, youth and juvenile institutions, for example, will
permit press interviews under reasonable regulations as to
time and place.
This policy now correlates the rule about interviews
with the Director’s judgment about which institutions are
tension filled, in which institutions that policy is
necessary.
QUESTION:

With which institutions are "tension

MR. BORK:

Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.

filled"?

QUESTION;

I just wanted to be sure I understood you.

5
MR. DORK:

Tliis case comes down now, therefore,

I think, simply to -the question of the Bureau's power to
maintain, a no-interview rule in maximum-security and mediumsecurity facilities.

Those are facilities with strong

perimeter guards, walls, double fences, and so forth.
How, I think it's important to be quite clear about
what -this case involves and what ‘this case does not involve.
And I think I ought to say that I believe that the First
Amendment claim here is not at the core of the First
Amendment and is, I think, a relatively attenuated First
Amendment claim? and I say that for two reasons.
One is tli at it does not involve any inhibition on a
right to publish.

This is a claim of a right of access to

newsworthy information, which 1 think is not at the core of
the Firs t Amendment.
tod secondly, we have the claim made in a prison
context, which is a regulated context, in which many
constitutional rights vary because of the nature of the context,
and in which primary discretion is entrusted to the Director
of the Bureau of Prisons.
What 'this case does involve is a restriction on one
of many modes of access to news.

It is not enough to argue,

I think, as respondents do, that they could do a more effective
job of reporting if this mode of access were also available
to them.

6
As I’ve said, the core of the First Amendment's
guarantee is the freedom to publish.

The .Amendment‘ s

application to rights of access is ancillary to the freedom
to publish, and, as the Branzburg opinion reminds us, rights
of access may be limited by government for reasons which would
not give government the power or the right to limit
publication.
The Branzburg opinion gives examples of that.

I

think Zemel v. Rusk and Kleindienst v, Iiandel are other
instances, where access may be denied lawfully, although
publication could not lawfully be prevented.
That’s frequent in governmental life, and I think
it's properly so. Surely a judge could tell his law clerks
that they may not give interviews to the press about pending
cases, and I assume he could discharge a clerk who did,
even though he might not be able to enjoin the publication of
the information, once given.
Mow, in this case, the press has so many sources of
information, and the minor restrictions placed on this one
journalistic technique is so vital to prison administration
that I find it difficult to think there is a valid First
Amendment claim.
I would -think, and I would urge, that the proper
method of review is to ask whether the Director of the Bureau
of Prisons has adopted a regulation which lies within a zone

7
of reasonableness, which accommodates the competing policies
in a manner than can be said to be rational and to be
reasonable? because any other mode of review will involve
courts, in effect, in second-guess.1 ng the administrative
decisions of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons in detail,
in the guise of constitutional adjudication.
It would also prevent the evolution of prison policy,
and policy in these matters and other matters does evolve in
the Federal Prison System —

MR. BORK:

Has the Congress ever entered this area?

Mr. Justice Douglas?

MR. BORK:

much of the control is delegated to the Director of the Bureau
of Prisons.
QUESTION:

I've often wondered, but I've never

thought through the question as to whether or not Congress,
under the First Amendment, would have the power to take
affirmative action, to make sure that the freedom of speech
and of the press, which may not be abridged, is not abridged.
MR. BORK:

Well, Mr. Justice —~

QUESTION: That may be far afield here, but I just

8
HR. BORK:

No, I think —

QUESTION:

We’re getting close to a federal

regulation.
MR. BORK:

We are in the field of federal

regulation, Mr. Justice Douglas, and I think Congress would
not need to legislate under the First Amendment.

It could

just regulate the prisons as it sees fit, and,if it wishes
to do so, of course, may implement First Amendment values.
Although it need not use the First Amendment as a source of
legislative power.

These are federal institutions.

But recalling that this is a regulated context,
where regulation of constitutional rights is permissible, and
I think that the zone of reasonableness is the proper standard
to judge the Director of the Bureau of Prisons standards.
I think we might examine the actual claim in this
case o
Respondents and various amici pitch this case on
the press's need to learn about prison conditions, and the
allegation is that prison conditions require reform, and if
the press can't tell us about them, we won't know about them,
and won’t reform them.
I would suggest that there is almost nothing about
prison conditions, certainly nothing about general conditions,
that the press cannot now learn with ease.
I would like just to run through the sources of

9

information available to the press now about prison conditions,
even, for example, in a maximum-security prison like
Leavenworth.
It’s been pointed out that the press are completely
free to correspond at any length, as many times as desired,
with any or all inmates, and to do so confidentially,
that is a new policy*

And

That was a policy adopted by the Director

recently, it was not in existence before, and is his attempt
to experiment, to find out means of getting information out
without causing serious problems to discipline and rehabilita­
tion .
QUESTION:

Is this because of the pressure of this

litigation?
MR. BORK:
Justice Blackmun.

No, nor this

I don't believe so, Mr*

If I'm wrong, I'll correct myself later,

I believe that policy was promulgated as part of a general
review of the problem*
QUESTION: Aren't the prison bureaus, in the Federal
System in any event, aren't these regulations being altered
from time to time, with some changes almost every year in
terras of administration?
MR. BORIC:

That is entirely correct, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

Their recent establishment of grievance

procedures is something that's been evolving for quite a long

10

time, has it not?
MR. BORKs

It has been.

And these policies are

under constant review and discussion with the wardens and
with other persons within the central office who have
specialized knowledge, sociologists, psychologists, and so
forth.

And experience causes modification of these

policies.
And the tendency now is towards more openness in
so far as that can he done, and that's a process that's
going forward.

I would hate to see it set in concrete all of

a sudden by constitutional rulings.
A concept of a zone of reasonableness gives the
system a little elbow room, a little play in the joints.
There is the correspondence.
Secondly, the press is given liberty freely by the
warders and tire other personnel of the Bureau of Prisons.
Third, the press is free, and is encouraged, to
tour the prisons and to inspect any and all facilities and
equipment, programs; and on such a tour there is no part of
the prison that is closed to the press.

They may go into

the segregated facilities, and they may converse with
prisoners in segregation as well as with any other inmates
they drop into.

In fact, Mr. Bagdikian was offered an oppor­

tunity to do precisely that.

The inmates at a prison, who had

led a strike, were in segregation; he was offered the chance

11
to tour the segregated facilities and converse with them,
not at length, in-depth interviews, but to converse with them.
He chose not to.
Fourth, members of the press may obtain interviews
with groups of prisoners where randomly selected.

Mr.

Bagdikian was given such an interview, with no prison
officials present.
Now, members of the press, of course, may also
interview any visitors who have been to see an inmate, his
lawyer, his family, his attorney? all of these persons may
talk to the inmate in complete confidence and may then talk
to the reporter.
And sixth, I think if we’re talking about general
prison conditions, it ought to be noted that members of the
press may of course freely interview all of the inmates who
are being released from prison.
men at any one time.

And that’s a constant flow of

I think it's approximately half of the

entire Federal Prison population will be out within one year.
At Leavenworth, for example, during first 1973,
415 men were released, which is an average of 34 or 35 men a
month.
Now, most of those men are processed out through
prison farms or halfway houses, but they, under this new
policy, can be reached as soon as they leave Leavenworth and
get into the halfway house or the prison farm.

12

So we have a constant flow of inmates 'who can
tell you immediately about the conditions they just left
behind, aside from the correspondence, the tours, and
everything else that’s provided,
Now, those are six channels of information that give
the press, I think, complete ability to learn what they want
to know about prison conditions accurately and promptly.
Respondents’ brief refers to these rules as a dam against
information,

I think these general rules, view in context,

act more like a sieve.

Information comes out freely and

easily, and the only kind of journalistic technique which is
forbidden is the one that raises severe

problems for

discipline and for rehabilitation.
Well, what’s left?

Respondents concede they may

be properly denied interviews during times of riot or
heightened tension in the prison.
of

So all that’s really left

the First Amendment claim is the right to preselect an

inmate for a confidential interview when there isn't riot
or tension in the prison.

And in practice that, usually means

the right to interview a celebrity, interview a Jimmy Hoffa,
Philip Berrigan, or to interview a disruptive inmate who has
just made the news because he’s led a work stoppage or a
riot.
And it is the latter, of course, that's particularly
troublesome, because that man becomes a leader by leading the

13

trouble and then by broadcasting his inflammatory charges in
rhetoric through the press.
And oddly enough, the very rule that respondents
are arguing for would cut off access to that man as soon as
he did it.

Because he would become the disruptive figure.
So I think the rule they're asking for is really not

a rule that makes a great deal of sense from anybody's
point of view.
It ought to be said that it's very odd to claim this
kind of right of access in the prison context.

The maximum

and medium-security prisons constitute the most tense, volatile,
violence-prone societies, I suppose, on the face of the earth.
The Bureau of Prisons simply cannot maintain
discipline and effect rehabilitation, which they have done
with increasing effectiveness, if press interviews are
permitted to create or maintain disruptive inmate leaders.
That much is conceded by the courts below and
apparently by the respondents.

But they think a case-by-case

approach will cure it.
I don't think so.

I think it would damage

rehabilitation and harm discipline.
In the first place, there is inherent disagreement
discrimination between inmates.

The man who is disruptive,

who is alienated, who is hostile, will not be allowed to have
interviews, while a man who says more pleasant things v;ill be.

14
Not because the warden is trying to control content, but you
do get a control of content when you say the disruptive,
hostile, alienated man cannot speak.

It’s inevitable.

And you also get tension and unhappiness as between
prisoners.
Furthermore, wardens are going to be required to
guess under this new policy about who is likely to be
dangerous, and there is some

•

QUESTION;

Whose policy now?

HR. BORIC;

Oh, the Court of Appeals policy, Mr.

Chief Justice.

It suggest they have to have some past

experience with this man to believe that he's disruptive.
Well, they may have a subjective feeling that he's disruptive,
and they may be quite right, but they are going to be
required to guess, and sometimes they're going to guess
wrong, and you may have seriously harmful, even tragic,
results«
And I would add this.

Even if a notorious inmate

i

proves not disruptive within the prison,it seems to me that
constant press attention, which could not be denied him if he
was not disruptive, is totally inconsistent with the idea of
an opportunity for penitence and for rehabilitation.

A man

who has become the object of the press and whose opinions are
cited everywhere is not likely to repent; he will maintain
his status and come out of the prison, I would think, in much

15
the same condition — at least that’s what the Director of
Prisons thinks»
Finally, I would suggest that there will be increased
litigation.

The Court of Appeals opinion suggests we have to

have certain kinds of experience in order to deny him an
interview.

I think we’re going to have a case made, a

record made, and we're going to be in the courts all of the
time; and that's a heavy administrative burden.
I would say one last word.

I think the First

Amendment itself cuts against this case-by-case policy.

If

the press has to have full access to the prisons, we are
going to have to decide who is the press.
Now, respondents say you've already done that, you
have a definition of the press.

That was a definition

adopted as a matter of administrative discretion without
constitutional pressure.

Once it is stated that the definition

is controlled by the Constitution, then we have a government
official, in the first instance a warden of a penitentiary,
deciding who qualifies as the press and who does not.
That becomes something like an official licensing
policy, if made under the First Amendment, and I think that's
a concept that's anathema to the First Amendment.
We submit, in short, that considerations of the
First Amendment, considerations of the prison context,
considerations of the deference due to the Director of the

16

Bureau of Prisons suggests that the case be reversed, and
that the Director be allowed to go forward under the policy
statement he has promulgated»
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, Mr. Solicitor

General*
Mr. Califano.
ORMj ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH A. CALIFANO, JR,, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR* CALIFANO;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The issue in this case is clear.

The question is;

does a reporter for a newspaper, the Washington Post, have a
First Amendment right to interview a prison inmate when that
inmate is willing to be interviewed and the interview
presents no serious risk of administrative or disciplinary
problems to the prison*
And secondly, there is no need to speculate, as I
believe the Solicitor General has done in many of his remarks
this morning, as to correctional problems, as to the importance

QUESTION:

Well, haven't you denifed now

haven't

(

you just defined away the reason for the rule?

You said,

"and no serious administrative or correctional problems*"
I thought the basis for the rule was that it would lead to
serious problems.

1?

MR. CALIPANO;

That the particular interview

presents no serious risks.
QUESTION:

Well, that one would contribute to the

— the assertion is that that face-to-face interview would
raise serious problems, along with others.
MR. CALIFANO:

Mr, Justice, we have in the record

the testimony from several wardens, including federal prison
wardens, including State prison wardens.

Nineteen States,

whose prison population, as the record indicates in this
case, are —•
QUESTION:

Well now, you're -- all right, you're

just taking the — you're addressing yourself to the merits
of the risk problem.
MR. CALIFANO:
QUESTION:

The reason —

Okay.

MR. CALIFANO:

— for the risk problem.

With respect to that problem, while we're on it,
I would note that we do have in this record testimony from
those wardens; we do have in this record the fact that 19 of
the 24 American jurisdictions, whose regulations ~ who have
regulations that are introduced in the record —• permit either
press interviews on a virtually without exception or on a
discretionary basis; and we new have a situation in which
the warden, at least at the lesser secure prisons of the
federal government, will have to make discretionary judgments,

18

because, presumably in times of emergency or in times of
particular individual disciplinary problems, they will not
permit a particular interview.
That change in policy, I believe, makes relevant
the Bureau of Prisons policy with respect to the way men are
assigned to the various prisons of the Bureau of Prisons,
and that is their policy statement 7300.13C.
I would simply note for this Court that of the many,
many reasons listed as to why individuals are assigned, only
one or two of them deal with security problems; -they deal
with hospital care, the availability of training programs,
whether prisons are overcrowded, whether they are close to
the home of the particular inmate involved.
So I would hardly consider it a rational distinction
in the context of a First Amendment right.
And lastly I would note that the record contains
idle fact that the federal prison population is not a highly
volatile, tense prison population, as the Solicitor General
has speculated, but that the bulk of the individuals in
federal prisons are there for white-collar crimes.
That's the record in this case.
QUESTION;

Well, are they the people who are in

the maximum-security institutions, Mr. Califano?
MR. CALIFANO;

I think some of them are.

We were

just informed of this policy on Friday, when we were informed

19

they would cover thirteen institutions, and then we were
given a list of these —
QUESTION;

Well, long before that —

MR. CALI FASO;

— just yesterday, when the list was

increased to twenty.
QUESTION:

— long before that policy, wasn't it

— .isn't it a matter of public knowledge that the assignment
is made of the people thought to be more dangerous on certain
established criteria, and assigning them to the maximumsecurity institutions?
MR. CAL IF.AH 0:

There is

there is testimony in

our record as to how individuals are assigned.

Surely, the

more dangerous people are assigned to the maximum-security
ins titutions.
QUESTION;

Just by definition, isn't that the —

MR. CALIFANO;

But the —

QUESTION:They may be wrong, they may make mistakes
in judgment.
that.

I think that the Solicitor General conceded

But that's at least the objective of the assignment

policy, the classification, when they come into an institution
they spend a period of six or eight weeks studying the
prisoner, to try to determine where he should go and where
he can best be rehabilitated, if he can be at all.
MR. CALIFANO:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

Now, assuming, for the purposes of your

20

case for the moment, that the decision is a correct decision,
to send a man to a maximum-security prison, then do you say
tiiat there are no potential problems?
MR. CALIFMTO:

I say tliere are no problems when

we're talking about 75 percent of the federal prison popula­
tion, which will still be subject to this total ban.

I say

that there is no — that there are no problems serious
enough to justify a total ban.
If there are problems at a particular institution,
at a particular time, because it is in a high state of
tension or because there is disruption there, we recognise
that there is — that the First Amendment values have to be
weighed at those times, and that the warden can make a
judgment as the courts, as both courts below did; that they
would not be appropriate for an interview.
If there’s a problem with a particular inmate, we
recognize that it would not be appropriate to have an
interview under circumstances in which he's a disciplinary
problem.

But —
QUESTION:

But I suppose you —

MR. CALIFAN0:

But we have testimony in the record,

I would note, at Terre Haute, which is a maximum-security
prison,

Warden Alldredge testified that only at the top

ten percent of the prisoners at Terre Haute, at a maximumsecurity prison, could be regarded as troublemakers; and of

that —* and then at most five percent would be entitled to
this sort of nebulous pejorative of Big Wheel.

So it's

eighty percent of those prisoners that are not a problem.
QUESTION:

If you concede that in a time of

emergency you wouldn’t be entitled to go ahead with the
proposed rule, and yet even that would be litigable, I
suppose, in the District Court if the warden says, "We have
an emergency here"i the people that want the interview said,
”No, it’s not that kind of an emergency."

The District

Court then decides?
MR. CALI FANG: The District Court would 'then decide.
I would simply note that in all the cases cited by
the Solicitor General, by us in our case and the other case
that this Court heard prior to ours, that all the litigation
deals with the total ban.

But that with one exception there

is not a single case that I’m aware of that deals with any
of the nineteen jurisdictions that were introduced in the
record, or the twenty-nine jurisdictions in fact that have
discretionary policies or generally permit interviews.
So that I think that the litigation point is not a
point of serious concern.
I would note that in the context of our record and
the evidence that was submitted in the findings of the
court below, all, virtually all of the evidence deals with
maximum and minimum-security prisons.

Those are the wardens

22

who testified,

those are the wardens who testified on our

behalf.
We submit, and it is our point, that under Branzburg
v. Hayes, newsgathering was firmly hitched to the First
Amendment by all nine Justices, and by all opinions in that
case.

And that in that case the Court applied to newsgethering

the same kinds of tests that it has applied to the right to
publish and other protections guaranteed by the First
Amendment; namely, that the infringement of the protected
First Amendment rights must be no broader than necessary to
perceive

to achieve a permissible government purpose;

and, secondly, that a State's interest must be compelling or
paramount to justify even an indirect burden on First
Amendment rights.
We think that the

that in this case in which the

government had two hearings, two opportunities to present
evidence, that they clearly did not establish that kind of
a governmental interest.
We also believe, as the Court of Appeals and the
District Court found, that the record provides substantial
evidence and uncontroverted testimony that face-to-face
personal‘interviews are not simply another technique, but
that they are essential to effective newsgathering in this
situation.
The Bureau of Prisons method of permitting an

23
exchange of letters with 'die prisoner’s letter to the reporter
not examined, but the reporter's letter to the prisoner
examined for contraband and for content which would incite
illegal conduct, is patently inadequate as far as the press
is concerned, and we think as far as First Amendment values
are concerned.
The reporter has no opportunity to test the
credibility of the prisoner, or to follow up in his
questioning; indeed, he does not even have the assurance
that the prisoner who is signing the signature block of that
letter is the prisoner who is answering the questions he's
writing to him about.
We all know that in prison life one prisoner writes
for another, one prisoner answers and helps other prisoners
ans we r q ue s t i ons«
And I would note that such a policy makes an
assumption that prisoners and inmates can read and. write
clearly; and, as the Chief Justice has noted, the percentage of
inmates in all institutions who cannot read or write is
staggering.
j

We think the public interest in learning about
prisons weighs heavily on the First Amendment scales, and
there I would simply note that there are more than 1.5 million
Americans in prison in this nation, on any given day,

QUESTION:

,

How do you relate that to the First
Mr» Califano?

MR. CALIFANO:

We think, Your Honor, that the

public -— the fact that these are public institutions, that
the taxpayers

of this country are paying for them, that

they are a significant part of our government, is a weight
in the scale of the right of the public to know about what's
going on in our prisons.
We think that the right of the pi-ess here is
essentially their right as surrogates of the public, to
inform the public.

And that that should weigh in these

scales.
We believe that the record in this case, which I
said puts us in the position of not having to speculate,
does not justify a government's sweeping ban, the kind that
here exists.
I mentioned Warden Alldredge's comments about
Terre Haute, I would mention that all warden directors who

25

testified on the issue of Big Wheels, Wardens Alldredge and
Directors Wainwright and Bensinger in the court below all
testified that Big Wheels come into prison Big Wheels or
become Big Wheels in prison, whether or not they are
interviewed.

That what is involved here is a kind of

negative .leadership function.
They also noted that prison officials are easily
able to identify the disruptive prisoner, particularly in the
federal prison system, for the reasons mentioned by the
Chief Justice in the context of the testing that now goes on,
the more sophisticated psychological and aptitude testing
that now goes on for prisoners.
We do not think that there is any significant
evidence in this record which indicates that press interviews
create disturbances at prisons.

Theres were three items of

testimony in this area, in this case, one related to the
warden or the head of the State correctional system in Iowa,
Mr. Brewer.

He testified 'that during a period of tension he

was overruled by the Governor, who ordered him to permit
press interviews, and that this increased the tension in his
institution.
There was still no violence at the institution, I
might note.

And, moreover, Iowa still has the discretionary

interview policy.
In -die other

the other instance mentioned was in

26
the State of Florida, in which a warden from -the State of
Florida said that some articles that were written created
tension in Florida four months later, where there was
violence»

I think the causation — when this Court looks at
the record, the causation is highly tenuous, and the warden
admitted that there were severe racial tension problems in
his prison before any px-ess interviews, or articles actually,
were written.
In the context of the questions that have been
raised by -this Court, I think in the context of an attempt to
define the press, I do not consider that a difficult problem.
The press is defined in many, many ways, and if the Solicitor
General is concerned, about how the press is defined, he
should be concerned about the fact that it's defined by
every department of this government, every day.

The

Justice Department has regulations defining what time press is,
who is entitled to use their press facilities, who is
entitled to go in there.
There are press definitions here, and this is not
proposed in the Bureau of Prisons — 'which are in existence
in the Bureau of Prisons policy, this is not a situation like
Branzburg, where we have an inherently unlimited number of
people that might claim to be reporters.

In the Branzburg

case, any individual who, at any given point in time, might

27
claim to be a reporter, claim to be entitled to First
Amendment rights, and therefore create a problem in terms of
investigation by the grand jury, where he had witnessed a
crime.
We don't have that situation in this case.
In this case we — there's a recognition by the
press that there has to be soma —■ has to be reasonable
judgments made, as they are made every day by this Court, in
who sits in its own press box.
QUESTION: Who would make those judgments?
MR. CALIFANO:

I think in the — those judgments

would have to be made by the warden in the institution.
That's what we would suggest, or the chief of the Bureau of
Prisons.
QUESTION: Would they be raviewable by the courts?
MR* CALIFANO;

I think in cases of severe abuse,

they would be? but I think that -- I mean, tine right, the
First Amendment right is a personal right, but it is not an
absolute right.

It is subject to reasonable regulation.

That's recognised in case after case by this Court,
One of the implications of Estes, for example,

is

that there will be a limited number of reporters in a courtroom
during a trial.
And I do not think that that means that all
reporters should — that everyone who ever claims to be a

28
reporter, or every reporter for every established newspaper,
or every one should be banned from having interviews,
personal intervie*ws with pre-idantified inmates.
I v?ould note that it is not simply a situation
where we can speculate that the press will always want to
interview the man creating the disturbance or always want to
interview a Jimmy Koffa.
Surely, they will want to interview people that
are celebrities.

For example, on television Saturday night,

CDS had an interview with Bud Krough, who is out at
Allenwood, at a time when the policy prohibited personal
interviews, and he was photographed for ten minutes.
But Hr. Bagdikian, in the record of this case,
was not after people who had created a disturbance, he was
net after celebrities, he was after a group of people that
had been selected to sit on a negotiating committee with the
prison officials, after a non-violent demonstration at
Lewisburg and at Danbury.

And he wanted to find out, as

the record shows, why the problems were resolved in those
prisons non-violently? how that came about.
He was not after the Big Wheel, if you will, or
the major celebrity.
Ity own closing with respect to this is that, as
far as the Washington Post and Mr. Bagdikian are concerned,
and as our brief reflecte, it is our firm conviction, that one

29

of the reasons why prisons are in the condition that they
are in today, a condition that’s been described by the Chief
Justice many, many times, is because the First Amendment has
not been permitted to operate the way it operates on
government, the way it operates in schools, the way it
operates in virtually every other facet of our society.
The First Amendment has not been permitted to let a
little sunshine in to those prisons, and let the reporters,
whose right becomes even more critical when the average
American, when the citizen cannot walk through every prison and
interview every prisoner he desires, and let them go into -the
prisons and get the story of the prisons out.
The First Amendment is part of that process.
I can understand, as anyone can, that this policy
is very convenient and very helpful for the warden
administrators, wardens and administrators in the Bureau of
Prisons System,

There isn't a single member running in a

United States government department or bureau or court or
university or anything in this country, or military base, that
wouldn’t be delighted to have a regulation that prohibited
interviews in tills context.
But that's not what our system is all about, and
that’s not what the First Amendment is all about.
Thank you, Your Honor.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Califano.

Do you have anything further, Mr* Solicitor General?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OP ROBERT H. BORK, ESQ*,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS*
MR* BORK;

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
I would just rise to note that the federal prisons
~~ we hear about the white-collar prisoners, and the federal
prisons, in fact, are not staffed entirely by white-collar
criminals who just violated the antitrust lav/s.

Systemwide,

fifty percent of the prisoners are convicted of crimes of
serious violence against the person or are major narcotics
traffickers, who are also regarded as a violence threat in
the prison.
Those members are much higher in 'die maximum and
medium-security prisoners.

We are dealing with a dangerous

and volatile population.
The testimony of the wardens below, the federal
wardens said that they perceived, on the experience of the
States —- and we have the experience of California which
thinks it perceived it — they perceive that this kind of
interview was quite troublesome to their efforts to
rehabilitate and to maintain order.
It is always difficult to link one event with a
result in human activity.
is such a link,

Their best judgment is that there

California's best judgment is that there is

31

such a link»

I think that’s a judgment that they are

entitled to make.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER?

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:37 o'clock, a.m. , the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.3
