ORAL ARGUMENT OF LuUIS NIZER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OP’ APPELLANT

MR. NIZER:

May it please the Court,

This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of
Georgia, which affirmed a criminal conviction for the
exhibition in a local theatre in Albany, Georgia of a
motion picture entitled "Carnal Knowledge."
The Defendant, Billy Jenkins, whc was the
manager of the theatre, was fined $750 and sentenced to
one year probation.

The fine has not yet been paid and the

probation has been stayed pending all appeals.
There Is no question that only persons of 18
years of age or older were admitted or would be admitted to
the theatre.

Minors or juveniles are not involved in this

case.
Also, this case does not involve obtrusive
exhibition to unwilling persons nor does it involve
pandering, despite the trial judge's instructions to the
jury, held to be a proper charge by the Supreme Court of
Georgia and despite the undisputed fact that there is not an

iota of evidence in the record of pandering»
This, alone, I shall later allude to,as in my
argument on due process, as sufficient for reversal.
The issue in this case is obscenity.

"Carnal

knowledge,“ which has been decided obscene by the Supreme
Court of Georgia, has been proclaimed by discriminating
critics throughout our country as a serious, artistic work
and its distinction derives from the combined talents of
many of America's leading contemporary artists.
There is Hike Nichols, the well-known stage and
motion picture director, Jules

Feiffer, the satirist and

playwright, Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen and Ann-Margret,
who, incidentally, won the Academy Award nomination for her
performance in this very picture and "Carnal Knowledge" has
played to 17-million,500,000 people in some 5,000. theatres in
small and large cities, including the State of Georgia,
enoying popular and discriminating acceptance and then an
investigator from the Sheriff's Office in Albany, Georgia

seized the film.
One month later, Jenkins was arrested for having
exhibited this film and the sole charge was public indecency.
He was tried by a jury which was instructed that
he could also be convicted of two other crimes for which he
had not been charged, namely, obscenity and pandering,
reversible again.

The jury, after announcing it was hopelessly
deadlocked, "If we stay here until July 4th," finally
brought in a general verdict of guilty so that we cannot
tell on what of these three counts, two of them

illegally

charge, improperly charge, he was convicted of.
On appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court and with­
out hearing oral argument, the Supreme Court of Georgia
upheld this decision by four to three and our appeal from
that decision presents one particular constitutional issue,
which is the profound significance to cultural freedom and
that is, will the sensitive regard for First Amendment right
evidenced by the clear announcement in the Miller decision
that hardcore pornography and only hardcore pornography,
may be suppressed, be permitted to be stretched and
grievously misinterpreted so as to strike down a work of
serious literary and artistic achievement such as "Carnal
Anowledge."
The dissenting opinions in the Georgia Supreme
Court expressed shock that exhibiting so meritorious a
motion picture should be a crime and that apprehension, your
Honors, has swept through all the creative elements of our
nation as the plethora of Amicus briefs in this case
indicates.
From producers, who fear to risk production, to
theatre owners xtfho fear to exhibit on

pain of criminal

6
involvement, to book publishers, who fear to print beyond the
safe norm, to authors, who fear to be innovative and, most
important of all, to the public, which may be deprived of
access to aesthetic diversity, which flourishes best when the
artist is not reined in , when he must not conform, to the
lowest common denominator of safety and limitation and the
damages here is not only to the work which has been barred,
but the less visible and subtle encroachment, self-censorship,
due to uncertainty.
In short, your Honors, the decision appealed from
will have a chilling, indeed, a freezing effect oh the
exercise of First Amendment rights of expression, unless
unless the threat of this holding of obscenity is dealt with
by vigorous renunciation and the limitation of hard-core
pornography is limited to be what the Hiller decision so
emphatically stated it to be, the sole exception bo the
protective shield of the First Amendment.
Professor Bickel had written in 1962 that the

radiating consequences of decisions impinging on the First
Amendment would encourage Cornstockian tendencies and recently
he stated that this decision on "Carnal Knowledge”’ does not
conform to the ruling of the Supreme Court in Miller.
Indeed, your Honors, it doesn’t.

It is unthinkable

that this picture should be confused with hardcore pornograpny.

7
The film depicts two college students over a span
of about 30 years.

They grow older, but they don't grow up.

They are preoccupied with sex, but the picture is not.

It

does not involve the senses with erotica, driving out all
other ideas, which is the typical characteristic of hardcore
pornography.
On the contrary, it depicts the failure of the
boys’ lives, though they are successful in their professional
careers, because they cannot establish meaningful relation­
ships and they are ultimately crushed by boredom, loneliness
and impotency.
The picture deals with the human predicament
resulting from the enthronement of impersonal detachment,
the inability to love and the sequelli of cruelty and spychic
illness and this artistic treatment of

this problem which

besets this decade and has evoked many social and philo­
sophical studies, has been the subject of plays in the past
from Strindberg to Tennessee Williams and that is why the
new York Times reviewer called it “Profound," the Saturday
Review, "Mature," the Atlanta General, "One of the best films
in a long time," and the Catholic Film Newsletter, despite
some reservations, "A preceptive and brilliant put-down of a
certain lifestyle," and the many critics throughout the
country who have heaped similar praise upon this picture
certainly all could not have been fantasising.

8
The language in this picture, your Honors, is
blunt, although not within dictionary distance of the erotic
poem in Kois against Wisconsin, which this Court understan­
dably held was not obscene because it bore "some earmarks of
an attempt at serious art, even though the author's reach
exceeded his grasp," as your Honor said.
Here it can be claimed credibly that a literary
and artistic standard was

achieved and it was not beyond the

grasp of the multiple talents which reached for it.
The story in "Carnal Knowledge" predominates over
any visual presentation.

The greatest care was lavished on

sets, lighting, camera effects, musical score, brilliant
ensemble acting, all under the direction of Nichols, acclaimed

among the most gifted of cinema techratic artists who
synthesized the ancient arts of painting, writing, composing,
acting in a new universal medium and the resulting dominant
effect of the picture as a whole is a sincere and earnest
effort to create a literary and artistic work and to confuse
that result with pornographic imbecility is cultural
illiteracy.
The decision below ignores inexcusably the
Miller distinction between commerce in ideas and the commer­
cial exploitation of sex for its own sake and it thus makes
the distribution of films and books a more hazardous
enterprise.

9
How, this Court has reserved the right of
independent review of the constitutional fact of obscenity
and

we submit respectfully that the answer is clear that

itCarnal Knowledge" is not obscene.
How, another reversible error which we urge was
that the Supreme Court of Georgia, in its opinion, made be
interpreted to have applied the community standard to
determine whether the work had value.

It is somewhat

ambiguous, but the ambiguity is cleared up, your Honor,
because in subsequent decision by the same court, the
Supreme Court of Georgia, in Slaton against Paris Adult
Theatre, it was clear that expressly-applied community
standards to all parts of the obscenity test — now, of
course, this is fatal error.
Even if a majority of people in a community
thought otherwise, Chaucer and Boccaccio and Rablaise and
Fielding would still have literary value.

The test is

quality, not popularity and it is based on the inherent
evaluation of the whole work, not by poll-taking.
A work which has literary value has, therefore,
the impregnable shelter of the First Amendment.

It cannot

be subjected to the other two tests of obscenity, to forfeit
its immunity.
So we need go no further.

But the fact is, that

the remaining two tests of obscenity are also not met in this

10

case.

"Carnal Knowledge” does not appeal to prurient

interests, nor is it patently offensive, nor does it depict
hardcore sexual conduct.
The work belies any purpose to titillate or to
exploit sex commercially for its

own sake.

The camera is

almost always on the faces of the characters, not below.
The

camera angles are deliberately discreet, picturing the

least, not the most and when the point is made, it terminates
the scene, not extending it with explicitness.
And sex is treated in this film as a sometimes
baffling and exasperating part of life, but without looseness
or lascivity and briefly stated there for your Honors, material
cannot be obscene unless it meets all three tests of Miller.
"Carnal Knowledge" is a film which meets none of
these tests.
How large should a muster community be which
determines the applicable standard for pruiency and
offensiveness?

The state decisions, your Honor, have varied

and conflicted with each other, some applying state, like
New York and Washington, some applying local, like Florida
and Alabama and one state both, Texas.
In this case, the Supreme Court of Georgia held
that a local standard was permissible but gave no clue as to
whether that local meant county, city, neighborhood, block or
whatever and that local standard is therefore void

for

11

vagueness„
Moreoverj even if the local area were specified,
were defined precisely, vte believe it would create
constitutionally intolerable consequences.
Let me cite a few facts in support of that
contention because we urge that the state geographic limit
ought to be the minimum required.
Q

Mr. Nizer, could I ask, please, let’s

assume you are correct in saying that under Miller a movie
or a book would not be obscene unless it was

hardcore and

let me assume that it is hardcore in whatever you might
mean by hardcore.

If that is so, doesn't a good deal of

the argument about local or national standards wash out?
MR. NIZER:

It would end the case there, quite

likely.
Q

Well, I know, but there is hardly any room,

then, for a local standard to be whatever the local standard
might be, but if a work didn’t happen to be hardcore, the
work would not be obscene.
MR. NIZER:

That is right and It wouldn't pass

the test.
Q

And the hardcore standard, if that Is the

standard, is the national standard.
MR. NIZER:
Q

Is it not?

Yes.

It is the First Amendment standard.

12
MR. NIZER:

Right, and not only that, in support

of that view, it seems to us, inhere you are dealing with the
literary and artistic value, community standard is irrelevant.
Q

Well, again, I just suggest that if it is

hardcore pornography, that is, that Miller limits the
obscenity definition to, the argument about national or local
standards is a great deal beside the point.
MR. NIZER:

Yes.

And I — the only reason I

address myself to this is that this case raises several issues
and it seems to us that in the interest of what Justice
Brennan has referred to as the institutional burden on the
Court to stop, perhaps, hundreds, maybe thousands of
applications as to what is the area, the geographical area of
a community's standard, that it might be worthwhile for this
Court to examine this matter and I address myself to it, even
though the case would be over if the picture isn't obscene,
that is the end of it.

Reversal would be required.

Indeed, it would be required on due process
entirely apart even if obscenity.
Bo I wish to, if this Court should wish to
further examine this matter, because as we read the Miller
decision, it didn’t specify what the geographical area must
be, it merely was permissible with respect to local or to
state and their indications, it meant state to us.
Now, I wanted to point out that even if the local

13
area were precisely defined, we think that it would still
create an intolerable burden on the First Amendment for these
reasons.
There are more than 78,200 separate political
subdivisions in the 50 states.

There are approximately

14,800 motion picture theatres in the United States and in
many states, these subdivisions overlap.

Thus, a single

theatre or a bookstore could be located within a number of
different subdivisions.
This creates a sort of a crazy quilt of con­
flicting standards and all of this would pass intolerable
burdens on the distribution and dissemination of communi­
cations .
Nov;, as your Honors, I am sure, recognize, it
is not feasible to prepare different versions of books and
films for distribution in different parts of each state.
These practical considerations invade the constitutional
realm for they have a chilling effect on the expression of
thoughts in that they compel the author, the producer, to
run the gauntlet of thousands upon thousands of uncertain
determinations on pain of criminal punishment.
Q

Why is that argument any stronger, Mr. Nizer,

than the argument that the producer ought not to be compelled
to tailor his product to the, perhaps, vagaries of 50
different states?

i4
MR. NIZER:

If the — If this Court would

recognize a review of its consideration as to a national
standard, which is what your question, Justice Rehnquist,
inplies to me, we would not be unhappy, but we think —
Q

But having rejected the national standard,

how much force is there in the argument that, although we
concede we have to do it for 50 different states, we
shouldn’t have to go beyond that?
MR. NIZER:

Great force, in that the balkanization

of this issue of submissions to 73,000 potential divisions as
against 50 states seems to me to be a. great difference in
degree and what we are dealing here with is the rule of
reason, as this Court has said, no provision will be perfect
and furthermore, there is a natural division for state rights
since the statute is state statute and it seems to me rather
natural to follow that sovereignty of that geographical area,
rather than permit its fragmentation to dozens of thousands
of local communities, each of which require definition.
So I think it would at least diminish the
chilling effect of these limitations.

At least, I respect­

fully submit that is a great possibility.
Now, another form of constitutional inhibition
caused by local standards is that an affirmance by the
highest court of that state of a purely local finding of
obscenity, in effect, forecloses other local areas within

15

the state from their right to make their own test, not
legally, but psychologically and as Jut ice Ilawes wrote in
the dissenting opinion below, ’'Local standards," he said,
"place in the hands of the few the tastes and cultural
advancement of the many who are members of the greater state
community."
So where there is a state statute, it is more
reasonable to insist upon a state standard, thus also
limiting the number of confusions and the hodge-podge of local
areas overlapping with each other and coming to this Court
a
to ask whether they are/constitutionally viable standard.
I now proceed to —
Q

Mr. Nizer, there are many city ordinances

in this general area, aren't there, throughout every state in
the union, or most states.
MR. NIZER:

Yes, and it seems to us that a city

ordinance defines by its own arrangement this specific area
but where we are dealing with a constitutional question, and
after all, the Constitution is national, it seems to me that
we ought to tend towards this theory, which I respectfully
submit to you, that as you widen the circumference of the
geographical area, you decrease the possible inhibition of
the First Amendment.
The little town or the block or the neighborhood,
in all probability, have inhibitions upon First Amendment,

state less and. even national, still less.
Therefore, I think the

tendency ought to be to

make the geographical area larger and

by natural boundaries*

At least the minimum requirement ought to be the state, which
I read the Miller decision to tend to, although I am not
certain.
Q

Well, I also read the Miller decision, even

though I olid not join it and it talked about local standards
and I rather gathered that that was self-defining, meant
that jurisdiction from which the jury came from

that was

trying that case.
MR. NIZERr
Q

Yes, but —

That is at least arguable, isn't it?

MR. NIZER:

It certainly is arguable, but I

think it would be most unfortunate If we didn't make a
standard, community standard, the minimum requirement for
constitutional reasons, to delimit the impact upon the right
of expression.
It is difficult enough as

it is, as Mr. Justice

Rehnquist just indicated by his question, really.

It creates

the practical problem, but it invades the constitutional
realm,

how are we going to make the book into so many

sections that we can give it to each local area?

At least,

if you have 50 states it is bad enough, but it is a little
easier and that is true of motion pictures.

17
Q

What would you do on the state area as between

Rhode Island, Texas and Alaska?
MR. NIZER:
question.

I would have each state area —
Q

on?

I am not sure I understand the

Well, you are not — what are you putting It

Size, number of people?
MR. NIZER:
Q

No, no.

You said geographical area, solely.

MR. NIZER:

The state statute ought to be

interpreted as a minimum requirement the community standard
must be gauged by that state in which the standards would
exist.
Q

Tha.t doesn't touch it.

That doesn’t have

anything to do with the number of people.
MR. NIZER:

Exactly.

That's right, sir.

That is

the way I would interpret It.
Q

Mr. Justice Stewart just suggested, however,

the city ordinances vary, for example, on the First Amendment
area of raid permits and a good many types of demonstrations,
do they not?
MR. NIZER:

Yes, they do, your Honor and I

suppose we will never have anything but an approximation of
a practical solution where you are dealing with constitutional
prerogatives and the divisions In the states in the 14th
Amendment applying them.

18
Q

Your argument seems to run a little bit

counter to the traditional idea — and maybe you reject the
traditional idea — that a jury is the conscience of the
community from which it is drawn.
MR. NIZER.

I believe very strongly in the jury

system when they decide facts; 'when they decide constitutional
facts, I think, as this Court properly said, you reserve to
yourselves the independent review because of the overall
umbrella constitutional requirement and I would distinguish
jury inviolability between ordinary facts in which I trust a
common sense.

They have seven senses, not five.

They add

horse and common and I believe in them.
But when it comes to a constitutional fact, as
Professor Bickel said, if a jury decided that a woman's leg
was obscene, this Court would be heard from or if it was
decided that the statue of David must have a fig-leaf on it,
this Court would be heard from and we wouldn't aceept the
jury's decision, even though I trust their wisdom generally.
And it is because of this question being
instinct with constitutional problems, that we urge that
special consideration.
I go — I may say, in all candor, since the
question of national standard has come up, understanding
your Honors' ruling and accepting it respectfully that there
is too much diversity in a large country such as ours to have

19
a national standard, but if this Court were to give further
consideration to that matter, I would like to submit
diffidently three reflections.
First, there is what I would like to call a
"technological equalizer" in the nation, the media today, the
same columnists in different newspapers, Newsweek, Time
Magazine all over the nation, the ease of travel, et cetera,
have reduced the diversity in the nation, not entirely, but
have reduced it.
Secondly, I think there is diversity within the
state and within the locality.

Upstate is different from

downstate in many areas and, indeed, in the locality the
urban and the other citified aspect of even a small town is
quite different.
Finally, in the Federal Obscenity Act, your Honor,
and in other such areas as mail and transportation, inter­
national transportation, we take a national standard and I
would think that we would not be unhappy if your Honors
decided because of these considerations to perhaps set a
national standard on a matter of this .importance, but we
urge only that the minimum standard ought to be the state or
there would be hopeless confusion and more impact upon the
First Amendment rights.
Time does not support me — and I would like to
lean on our brief with respect to due process, but I would

20

like to make just — point a finger at two propositions.
Pirstj Jenkins was charged with Section 26-2105,
which is public indency.

That was the only charge in the

accusation.
Then the court below — and that charge was
approved by the Supreme Court of Georgia or else I wouldn't
raise it here — the court below charged the jury that it
could also find him guilty of obscenity, which was another
section and another crime, 26 01, not 26 05 and they could
also charge him with pandering, which is quite preposterous,
there is not even a word of evidence about that and this
case does not fit pandering anyhow.

It is not a close case,

such as Ginsburg, where that became an issue and therefore,
when the jury brought in a general verdict, noone can tell
what they found.
In addition to that, the Supreme Court of Georgia
construed 2105, which is public indecency, together with
2101, which is obscenity, construed them together.

Thank you, your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Wiser.

Mr. Hight.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TONY H. HIGHT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. HIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice and might it

please the Court:
First, I'd like to, if I may, go back a little
further in the chronology of the case to point out that
sometime prior to the instant case, in a case involving
Martin Theatres, which you'll find on page 66 of the record
below, some remarks brought to it.

This same film, ‘'Carnal

Knowledge," was involved in the city of Albany, Georgia, which
is seme approximately four hours drive south of Atlanta and
after a hearing in federal court, after bringing the matter
back to state court, the Martin Theatre chain and the district
attorney reached an agreement concerning the film, "Carnal
Knowledge," and Martin Theatre agreed not to show this
particular film in Albany, Georgia and this is not an issue
where the film, "Carnal Knowledge" is just thrust out for the
first time in this particular case, but it was in the
community.

This was an issue in the motion picture industry

and Albany, Georgia some time prior to that.
>

In the present case, prior to the matter coming

22

up for trial, the Court will notice that there were a number
of demurrers filed to the indictment or accusation as such
and there were six of these demurrers prior to attacking the
accusation.

At the trial itself, the film "Carnal Knowledge"

was shown by the state.

The state rested.

evidence presented by the defense in this

There were other
particular

instance of other books and et cetera on the local market,
wich the Georgia court disposed of and said that it would not
be relevant

to judge one by some other particular matter.
But there was no more else.

The only other thing

that carae in touching the film "Carnal Knowledge" was the
unsworn statement of the Defendant stating that this was
being shown or had been scheduled to be shown in several
places in Georgia and reference to the fact that it had been
acclaimed

as one of the particular pictures.
.•

i \

As we pointed out in our brief, under'he
Georgia law, you cannot, by the use of an unsworn statement
introduce evidence and make it admissible in probative value
for the jury through the use of an unsworn statement.

There

are other means to get this material in evidence to bring in
any critical reviews, anything that would go to show other
facets as to the film, "Carnal Knowledge."
But what the jury had in this case, the jury
that had to decide this issue, \/as the film "Carnal Knwoledge"
and this was it.

23
I think if the Court will look at the record to
see, this is what they had to decide it on, not any reviews
by the New York Times or anywhere else, but they —■
Q

Mr. flight?

MR. HIGHT:
Q

Yes, sir.

Excuse me for interrupting, but I was under

the impression that the court instructed the jury that it
could believe the unsworn statement entirely, if it so
desired.
MR. RIGHT:

Yes, sir, they can consider the

Defendant's statement,but it cannot be used, sir, for the
purpose of Introducing evidence.

That would have to be

introduced in another fashion.
Q

Well, the court told the jury that "You may

believe it entirely as true."
MR. RIGHT:
Q

Yes.

What is the difference between that and

evidence?
MR. HIGHT:

I think it is the part the court con­

siders and has in the past and could support with the court
as probative value in evidence in a particular case.

The

court says that you can believe his statements, his statements
if
as to knowledge and et cetera, but as to the other facts,/it
comes in, it would have to be brought in by some other
means, such as the best evidence rule, he cannot utilize

hio unsworn statement to introduce evidence that would have
to come in through another means and in this case, there was
no such problem because you had a situation where other
evidence was introduced.
There was no question about him relying on an
unsworn statement as his sole purpose.

He could have brought

in any other evidence in a proper manner and presented it
before the court.
Q,

Mr. Right, what was the difference of the

role of the jury in this case and a board of censors?
MR. RIGHT:
different view.

Well, sir, I think that is quite a

The jury ■— I think a board of censors, as

you may apply it to Maryland, may set down and say, "We have
set a particular group."

We make thi3 particular distinction

with a person having a review from that particular issue.
But under our system of jurisprudence, the jury is the
ultimate trial fact in a particular case.
Q

And so they look at the movie.

MR, RIGHT:
Q

Yes, sir, they looked at the movie.

And they decided its obscene.

MR. HIGHT:

Yes, sir, this is what the court

decided,
Q

And what is the difference between the censor

looking at the movie and deciding it is obscene?
MR. HIGHT:

Well, I think it is the — just the

25
difference between the requirements of the two.

The censor

board would simply, in my estimation, just —
Q

The censor board would say, you shouldn’t do

it and this jury says, you go to jail.
MR. MIGHT:
Q

But they perforin the same function.

MR. HIGHT:
Q

This could be so.

No, sir, I don’t believe so.

Well, why couldn’t you take the board of

censors and say that if the picture is obscene, the man goes
to jail?
MR. HIGHT:
system.

Because this is not in our particular

I think what they are doing, the court of Georgia

does not have a board of censors as Maryland does, and I
think you have certain review's from the board of censors
that you do not have from your juries.
Q

You did have a board of censors.

MR. HIGHT:

Well, we do have — far back, we did,

yes, sir.
But what I would point out to the Court is that
this is the status of the case as it came up and as it left
the trial court.

Then when we came to the appeal in the case,

there were basically two areas that was gone into.
The first was the six demurrers or the actions of
the demurrers filed below and the only other issues raised in
the Georgia courts were the judge either failure to charge or

26
a charge of error on what the judge, in fact., did charge.
In that particular case, the Court will notice
that as to demurrers numbers one and two below, these were
expressively waived in the Georgia court.
As to the demurrer number six, this was
expressly waived in the Georgia court.

On page 7 and 9 of

the Appellant brief — so what the court had before it in
the Georgia court was an attack on the demurrer or the
accusation as such, saying that this accusation did not
include the particular language of 2101(B) and this was the
in
attack in number three and/number four, the attack was the
fact that the particular accusation did not have — or the
statute on which it i^as based did not have this language
contained therein.

And the fifth one has been dropped on

the basis of the Paris Theatre versus Slaton that this Court
decided as to public and nonpublic place.
Now, this is what was raised in the court above,
though.

It was simply the judp^e's charge and the question

as to whether or not the accusation — not the statute but
whether the accusation should have had this particular
language included in the accusation.
Third, is the point that -— they said that this
on
did not have — or the statute/which it was based did not
have this language on it, they attacked the accusation and
not the

statute itself.

27

The Georgia court, in applying the Miller decision,
used the very language of the Miller decision.

It stated

that local or state standards, the very, in fact, the very
language of this Court in the Miller decision, "local or
state standards," it did not go past that particular point.
So the State would argue to the Court in this
case that there has never been a constitutional attack on the
statute in the lower state court.
It has been an attack on the accusation itself and
it has not been an attack on the statute for being overbald or
being vague.
Nov/, an issue was raised in that particular area,
as I pointed out, on the fact that the code section involved
did not include the Georgia definition of obscenity.

If the

Court will look at the entire statute section, you'll see that
it is defined as the distributing obscene materials section;
that in this section 2105 is included and the definition of
obscenity is included in the section 2101(B) as part of this
particular provision and in 2105, the Georgia Court required
that 2011 — that means that you have got to go to the
indecent exposure statute to see v/hat the prohibitive acts
would be under indecent exposure but in this particular
section, it requires this and it has to be the distributing
of obscene materials.
Now, in this area, the court charged in the lower

28
court — it wasn’t done in the Supreme Court for the first
time — the lower court charged the language of all three,
told them that charged with the crime of distributing obscene
material, that he was charged with these particular acts and
then charged the jury in very explicit language — and the
court said., the question is not whether these acts were done
as such, but if these acts were, in fact, done, would this
be obscene under this provision of distributing obscene
material?
And the court charged him.

It is not the question

of public indecency or exposure, but it is the question if
these acts that are depicted were done on the screen, does
this, talcing into view the Georgia statute and test on
obscenity, does this show that this movie is obscene under
those particular standards?
In the judge’s ruling, the jury so found but to
call the Court's attention first to one point, there was
never any enumerations of error raised in the Georgia courts
on the general grounds that the jury could not have found
this particular film obscene under any standards, on the
general grounds and Georgia courts have liberalized in the
last few years its

rules on bringing the matter before them,

saying that any time before oral argument, before the court
decides the issue, that any defects in the enumerations there
or the notice of appeal can be accrued at that particular

29
time and. there was never an attack made or any charge made in
the Georgia courts that this .film was not obscene.

It was

never an issue raised In the Georgia courts.
Q

Well, you mean, not constitutionally obscene?

because, certainly, the Supreme Court of Georgia, both the
majority and dissenting spent a fair amount of time on the
subject, whether or not the film was obscene or not, didn't
they?
MR. RIGHT:
enumerations of error

I think if the Court would review the
you would find that there are a

number of situations where the request was that a Judge erred
In making this particular charge because there was nothing
in the evidence to support any such charge or any such
findings by the Jury and the court below in the majority
opinion — and I don't believe the court of Georgia has any
problems citing where something is — this is obscene and we
find it to be obscene.
But in this particular case, the Court says,
after reviewing the record and reviewing this court, we
affirm — hold the record in this case amply supports a
verdict of showing the film "Carnal Knowledge" in violation of
distributing obscene material and what I am saying to this
Court now is this is an issue that has never been raised
below in the Georgia courts by the Appellant in the proper
manner

30

Q

Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc suggests that the

Georgia court actually decided the question, anyway.

I mean,

if they dealt with the issue —
MR. HIGHT:

Yes, sir, he suggested this.

What I

would suggest back is that the court did not reach this
particular point because it was not an issue but

it did

reach the issues that were raised below and that was, whether
jury could, on the basis of the charge of the court, could
find this were included in the film itself.
Q

Did the court say it was obscene?

MR. HIGHT:

No, sir.

Q

It didn't say that?

Q

The court said, the jury found this obscene

and we affirm,
MR. HIGHT:

It said,.we affirm the jury’s finding

of guilty.
Q

The jury's what?

MR. HIGHT:

Yes, sir.
’ 7

Q

Well, what did the jury find?

MR. HIGHT:

It found them guilty of the

distribution of obscene material, yes.
Q

And the court of appeals upheld

that

judgment of affirmance on the question of obscenity,
MR. HIGHT:

Yes, sir, but this issue, as I would

point out to the Court, was not raised below.

31
Q

Well, is it before us, now that the Georgia

court has passed on it?
MR. HIGH?:
not, sir.

No, sir.

My opinion is that it is

It is that the —
Q

Even though the Georgia court passed on it?

MR. HIGH?:

I think what the Georgia court said

was to go back and look at issues that were before them,
that they had to make such a ruling on.
Q

And they did.

MR. HIGH?:
Q

Yes, sir.

Is that ruling before us?

MR. HIGH?:

Yes, sir, the ruling they made is

before you, yes, sir.
Q

Well, I am a little confused, too.

On

page 30 to 31 of —
MR. HIGH?:
Q
large

Yes, sir.

— a rather brief charge which embraces a

part of the relatively brief charge of the court to

the jury, I note that the word"obscene" and "obscene conduct"
appears five times at least.
MR. HIGH?:
Q

Yes, sir.

I may have missed some.

So the judge

certainly submitted the issue of obscenity to the jury.
MR. HIGH?:
to the jury and

Yes, sir, the issue was submitted

the jury made a determination, if the

32
Court please.

There was, as under the Georgia rules of the

enumeration of error, that you have to delineate the issues
that you are appealing upon for the court to reach a deter­
mination as this Court.

This issue was not ever raised by

any enumeration of error at any time prior to the court's
determination.
Now, if the Court can say that by affirming the
jury's finding in this fact, this does decide the issue of
obscenity, then that

would be this Court’s decision that

they did reach that particular point.
Q

If you look at Justice Jordan's opinion at

pages 53 and 5^ of the Joint Appendix, he says the "Trial
court correctly charged this definition of ofscenity as the
guideline for the jury to apply in this particular case."

He

goes on to mention the Roth case. Memoirs against Massachu­

setts, our decision in Miller against California.

You know,

whether or not the Supreme Court of Georgia had to pass on
that in view of whatever the bill of exceptions before them
was, it seems to me that they did say that it was
constitutionally permissable to find the film obscene.
Do you disagree with that?
MR. HIG1IT:
tion.

I think you could reach that assump­

What I am saying to this Court is that this was not an

issue raised before that court as one of the issues in the
case.

33
Q

But our rule on review is that even if the

Supreme Court of the State might not have had to deal with
the thing under its procedure, if it in fact dealt with it,
then it is before us also, or at least, that is my under­
standing.
MR. HIGHT:

Yes, sir, and my point in — I may be

wrong, but this is what I read in the entire facts, in going
back through the entire view of the thing, is that issues
were raised as to the requested charge that the court had to
find that certain evidence was available for the jury

to

consider on other matters that did not reach the issue of
obscenity.

Whether this is wrong, then it would be — if I

am wrong, then it would be considered.
In any case, the state below — or the Georgia
Supreme Court below stated that as they have done in a
number of cases, as in the Miller versus California
-V

In Georgia, you also have in your murder cases,
situation as to murder, we have got some other sections that
go and limit murder when you get into the question of
justifiable homicide, which would apply in a particular case.
In this case, the Georgia court said only that
in 2105, since this was under the distributing obscene

34
materials, that the entire code section had to be considered
together, which included the definition of obscenity in
2101(B) and that particular provision it just delineated the
Georgia obscenity test and incorporated that as part of the
2105.
How, this is not a new ruling.
thing they brought out for this case.

It is not some­

This has been the

same thing for a number of years where they have to consider
the entire code section and not just pull out one section, if
you are to construe it as the same basic materials.
And the Georgia court considered them together
and we urge to the Court that this decides if the court
did reach the question of obscenity as to 2105, that this
does cover that particular matter — material on nonfederal
grounds, that the state court has so construed and included
in the definition of

obscenity 2105 and the 2101 tied

together and that should solve that particular matter.
The only other thing raised below other than
the charge itself knowingly, as I pointed out before, was
waived.

On page 7 they have made an issue that the use of

the word "knowingly" in 2101 was not properly done and was
specifically waived.
But in this particular case — if the Court
please — there was no attack below on the Georgia statute
involved here on the question of overbreadth of the

35
particular statute or any vagueness on the statute.
not raised before the Georgia courts.

This was

There is nothing in the

Georgia court’s determination of the case as to overbreadth
or vagueness.
Getting into the area of due process, if the
Court pleases.

In this particular area, the Georgia court,

as I pointed out to the Court as to the facts of the situation,
i

this is not something that just simply jumped out at these
individuals at this one time.

This is something that had

been pending in Albany, Georgia for some time.
This statute xvas on the book and the same statute
that had been applied previously in the Martin Theatres case.
The Georgia court had previously said much before
that point, that this, in each case when you have got a code
section that pertains to foe same matter, that you have to
construe the entire code section together to reach a deter­
mination as to what the contents would be and the court
reached and said that when 2105 •— and it falls on the area
of distributing obscene material — applies, that the
definition that is given in the code section on distributing
obscene material would apply in that particular case.

This

is what tiiey did in that particular case and it was not an
unforeseen or something that would not particularly come out
in that particular area.
Going into several areas, if the Court please,

36
particularly in the area of national standards as to local
standards, the only issue raised below as to any type of
standards was the question whether the trial court erred in
charging national as versus local standards.
There was no issue raised at all anywhere as to
a state versus local.

In the Georgia court, the trial court

refused to charge national standards.
The court did charge, in that particular
instance, the same community standard that has been the test
since Memoirs used it in the community.

That is to say, local

community, they use the same language that has been used
throughout most of the nation as to community standards.
But they didn't define it as local.

In this

particular instance, the Georgia court did not reach the
issue again because there was no issue raised as to state or
local.

The court simply held, the trial court was correct

when it said that national standards would not apply and
this is the only issue as to state versus local standards
raised below, was as to local versus national, there was
nothing raised here.
I think the thrust of the state’s argument, if
the Court please, is basically is that all of these points
raised here are raised

ab initio before this Court for the

first time and they were not properly raised below in the
state court, that the state court did not have the

37
opportunity to pass upon them in the issue they now raise.
The state court didn’t meet the objection raised in the local
state court.
Wow j I think if the Court xi/ould look at the
difference in. the enumerations of error in the arguments
made below to the state court and the arguments made at this
time to this Court, the Court would see there is two entirely
different set of arguments and a complete new set of points
that are being raised, to this town.
One further thing I would like to call to the
Court's attention is the question as to the jury.

We feel

that in the Miller case the court for the first time placed
the obscenity area in a situation where the jury 'would make a
determination as to standards and judge the film to eliminate
a lot of review by the jury having a standard that worked
very much like your reasonable man theory where the jury would
make a determination and the court, having the opportunity to
review if there is a constitutional question involved, the
court then reaching it on that particular case and on those
limited number of cases.
We think that the fact that the court has
delineated the fact that local or state standards applies
and that the jury has an important part makes a great step
forward in the area of the obscenity cases.
