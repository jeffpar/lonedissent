MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will resume arguments

in Village of Belle Terre against Boraas.
Mr. Gegan, I think you have about ten minutes
remaining, altogether,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD E. GEGAN, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS - [Resumed]
MR. GEGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Yesterday I had tried to make two basic points.
First, the general proposition that the Village has a
legitimate interest being zoned as a one-family community, a
legitimate interest in imposing some kind of limit on the
number of unrelated people who may aggregate together under
the roof of one private residence.
QUESTION:

But that is«the two, as I understand

MR. GEGAN:

That is tlie particular figure set by

it.

the Village, Your Honor.

And yet, at the same time, an

equally legitimate interest in not imposing the same kind of
numerical limit on the occupancy of a traditional family.
That's the basic principle.
But, as Mr. Justice Douglas said,

our Village has

a limit of two.
Additional public purposes are particularly relevant

20

to the number two.
The legitimate interest of the Village in equalizing
the competitive position of families seeking to rent a
residence, with an aggregation of unrelated individuals seeking
to rent a residence.

Families have usually one income,

perhaps two incomes, whereas a group of unrelated individuals,
each leading separate lives, can have a pooling of frar
greater financial resources and could easily bid a family
out of any market to occupy a residence.
The case of Dandridge v. Williams turned in part on
a similar consideration.

The ceiling in that case put on

Aid to Families with Dependent Children was justified by a
parity between what a welfare family would be earning and
what a wage-earning family would be earning.
Indeed, this is an easier case than Dandridge,
because in Dandridge the classification placed at a disadvan­
tage the underprivileged group, whereas in our case the classi­
fication seeks to benefit and give a break and a parity to
the entity that would otherwise be at a disadvantage, namely
the family*
This seems obvious to us, yet the plaintiffs have
suggested that this is not a real concern of the Village,
that it's a fictitious or spurious concern.

I don't know

where they get their crystal ball to make such an assertion,
but I'm here to tell you that the Village has a legitimate

21

and a real governmental concern with this problem.
We're fifteen minutes from the State University at
Stony Brook, which has a potential of thousands of unrelated
people.

The exact figure at Stony Brook is not in the record,

but it's a matter of public record, so it can be judicially
noticed; over 12,000 students are at Stony Brook.
Several houses — a few houses in the immediate
neighborhood of the Dickman house have already been rented,
at about $350 a month.

The Dickman house, which is rented

to the group of students, rents at $500 a month.

The disparity

is tiiere.
And under the lav/ of supply and demand, houses that
are not presently on the rental market can come on the rental
market, once it is seen that we have an abundant demand on
the part of unrelated people who are willing to pay plenty
to occupy a one-family residence.
The last major public purpose underlying this
ordinance is the community's legitimate interest in
stability.

If it may reasonably be thought that groups of

unrelated people tend to be more transient and provide a less
stable community, then it seems to us that a one-family
zone, limited primarily to families and small twosomes of
unrelated people, promote this additional legitimate interest.
Indeed, on the point of stability, one need only
look at the record in this case, Appendix page 11, the

22
plaintiffs' own allegations were that it was never planned
that these students would be permanent residents.

Two of

them were on the lease; four of then were not on the lease.
And it was contemplated that they would come and go.
The only constant tiling was that the total would
remain at six.

So this is clearly a more transient situation

than family occupancy.
The plaintiffs say that we live in a mobile society,
and even families move.

And they cite some figures.

those are gross figures.

But

They don't give a breakdown, as

between families, non-families, people who rent, people who
own,
Your Honor, I'd like to reserve a few minutes.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Hr. Sager,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE G. SAGER, ESQ.,
ON BEIIALF OF THE APPELLEES
HR, SAGER:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Belle Terre ordinance, which is challenged here,
and which was invalidated by the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals below, is in many respects an extraordinary piece of
municipal legislation.
It's important at the outset, I think, to recognize

23

what the Belle Terre ordinance is not.
It is not an ordinance of the kind which this Court
validated in its sweeping decision in Euclid vs. Ambler.

And

it is not, in like fashion, an ordinance of the character
which has received widespread acceptance as a tradition of
comprehensive local zoning has taken hold in this country as
a result of this Court's Euclid decision.
It is different because it in no sense purports to
segregate incompatible physical uses of land, or to encourage
the productive use of land.

What this ordinance does in its

substantial purpose, in its operative criterion, and in its
effect is to exclude persons who are regarded as uncongenial
from a community; and exclude them, not merely on the basis
of a random criterion of uncongeniality but on the basis of a
criterion of deeply personal choice; namely a person's choice
of household associates.
In justification of its ordinance -—
QUESTION:

Well, under your view, could somebody

open a rooming house and have a constitutional right, despite
this zoning ordinance, to open a rooming house?
MR« SAGER:

No, Your Honor, I don't think that is

our view,
QUESTION: Why not?
MR, SAGER:

Why not, under your argument?

Under our argument,

essentially, the

Village has proffered two characters of legitimating interest,

24
On the one hand, they've proffered an interest —
and they acknowledge this candidly, Your Honor -— in social
and in creating a socially homogeneous community? and on the
other hand they've proffered

their more orthodox interest,

which they’ve expressed in oral argument before you.
Our argument, Your Honor, is simply, first, that the
creation of socially homogeneous enclaves is not a legitimate
interest of government.
QUESTION:
HR. SAGER:

And, second,

Well, I don't —
— that this ordinance bears no

rational relationship whatsoever to the interests which have
been discussed before this Court,
Now, to get — and I'm sorry that I deferred your
question.

In the situation involving a boarding house, it's

entirely possible, in most communities, that there would be
substantial legitimate governmental interest, justifying
the prohibition of a boarding house.
This is not such a situation in the instant case.
QUESTION;

As I understand, they are fencing out

socially undesirable people.
HR. SAGER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: But I understand that two socially
undesirable people could —
MR. SAGER:

Yes, Your Honor, this was the point made

by Hr. Justice Rehnquist —-

25
QUESTION:
MR. SAGER:

Pardon?
— in argument yesterday.

It's

interesting to note, hoever, if you refer to the appellants'
brief in this case, eit page 30, the appellants give their
explanation for permitting an unrelated household of two
person? and that explanation makes it perfectly plain that
they regard this as a grudging exception, which violates
their basic policy of excluding unrelated persons.
Their rationale expressed on page 30, in essence,
runs as follows:
We recognise that, says the Village, that there
may be some single persons who own a house in Belle Terre by
themselves, and we think it would be unjust to make them move.
7Bnd we're concerned that they may be lonely, and so we permit
them to have one associate.
Nov;, I don't criticize the policy, let me make clear,
of allowing two unrelated persons; but I do want to make it
perfectly plain that the Village, by its own description,
of its reason for this exception to the exclusion of single
families, does not purport to be saying, Yes, we in fact like
single, traditional -- non™traditional household groups, but
we want to regulate their size.
Rather, it says, We want to keep unrelated persons
who form households of such persons out of this community,
but we realize that the equities become so great in some

26

situations that we make an exception.
That's the Village's own characterisation of that
exception, Your Honor, not mine.
QUESTION:

Hr. Sager, I'm not sure I track your

response to Ilr. Justice Stewart's question, but let me try
another one that might be somewhat like it.
What about a fraternity house?
I1R. SAGHR:

Again, Your Honor, I think that the

question in each instance would be at a minimum, as in any
governmental classification which deprives a given group of
people of a substantial benefit:

Is there a legitimate

interest which substantiates or supports or justifies this
classification?
I think in the case of a fraternity house, in many
communities there might indeed be such legitimate interest.
There might be serious concerns about the supply of parking,
for example, there might be other legitimate concerns.
Where those concerns existed, our quarrel with such
legislation would largely cease.
QUHSTION: But why wouldn't there be serious concerns
about parking here, where you have six individuals in a house
and very likely each of the six might have their own car?
MR. SAGHR:

In this instance, Your Honor, there are

several very important reasons I think for believing that
this ordinance does not rationally advance.

First, this

27
ordinance does not advance any such concern, and secondly,
that the Village has no such concern.
If I can start with the second half of that argument,
this Village has 220 homes, distributed over an area of more
than a square mile.

The present density of population in the

Village of Belle Terre is 1,1 persons per acre.

An

extraordinary low density.
Parking, by the Village ordinance, v/hich we cite to
this Court — I believe at page 5 3 of our brief — parking by
virtue of the Village ordinance is prevented on any street
of the Village at this time.

There are no cars parked on

the streets of the Village for these 220 homes and 700 people?
there are four municipal parking lots provided.

There is

absolutely no showing that this Village has or has ever had
any concern with a parking problem of any kind.
Nor is there any reason to believe that were we
confronted with a village which had a parking concern, that
this ordinance would in any way rationally advance that
interest,
The parking argument, among other things, is tied,
of course, to the argument v/hich Hr, Gegan made yesterday
concerning the density of population.
And I'd like to examine that argument briefly for a
moment.
QUESTION; Well, how about the parking argument — or

23

is tills going to be an —
HR. SAGER:

I think — well, let me say that I

think that if there is a relationship between parking and
tiie relationship of the people who live in the house, it
must turn on one of two suppositions, neither of which, I
think, is accurate*
Either that more people will live in Belle Terre
if this ordinance is invalidated, or if this ordinance did
not exist, or that more people who drive cars will live in
Belle Terre.
I don't think either supposition can be sustained.
On the first question, of whether more people will
live in the Village, let me make perfectly plain what this
ordinance permits and what it prohibits.
It permits any number of persons related by blood
or adoption or marriage to live in a household unit-

They

may be related by any remote degree of consanguinity, as in
their own brief the appellants admit they may be brothers,
sisters, cousins, grandfathers, or uncles,
Iloreover, under this ordinance, they may have living
in their household any number of household servants whatsoever.
They may have, in other words, more household servants than
may live in an unrelated household independently in the
Village.
So an extraordinarily large number of people may

29

live in a house of any size in the Village of Belle Terre
if they bear the magical relationship of familial tie.
If they do not, three persons violate this
ordinance.

Three spinsters, as was suggested yesterday; three

schoolteachers; or, as the Court of Appeals below noted,
three judges violate this ordinance.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sager, I'd like to understand at the

outset whether you are attacking the concept of single­
family residential zoning wherever it may be.

I would suppose

that most cities in the United States have single-family
residential zones.

Are you saying that all of those are

invalid?
I1R. SAGER:

Hot at all, Your Honor.

If by single­

family zone, —
QUESTION:

Well, what is --

MR. SAGER:

— what one means is detached

residential dwellings on individual parcels of land, nothing
in the attack which we have successfully

mounted below on

this ordinance, and press here, nothing whatsoever speaks
to the invalidity of detached single-family dwellings.
We challenge merely the notion that a community can say
who will occupy those houses.

And, moreover, that they can

select a criterion of household association in so saying.
That's solely the attack we make on this ordinance.

And we

don't intend, and I don't believe our attack has, any

30

implications which speak to the invalidity of single-family
dwellings in residential communities.
QUESTION;

But you do saiy that the Village cannot

define the families, that you can define them any way you
want so long as you live in a detached house?
Isn’t that correct?
HR* SAGER:

That is correct.

QUESTION: And so, to that extent, it is a general
attack of -die kind that’s suggested —
HR. SAGER:

If by —

QUESTION:

—■ in the question of my. brother Powell

HR. SAGER:

-— single-family zone one means to

characterize die household unit in terms of the kind, the
quality of the relationship which exists between those people
and particularly to draw on a delicate choice like that, of
living or not living with one to whom one is related by
familial ties, to that extent necessarily we attack die
single-family residence zone, only if that's what one means
by that.
QUESTION:

And you say diat the Village, in diis

case at least, has no constitutional power to define the
family, die way, at least the way diey did.
MR. SAGER:
QUESTION:

I tiiink diat's right.
And could not confine it to, what I

think what sociologists now call a nuclear family.

Is diat

31

it?
MR. S/vGER:

Yes.

Although I — just to be perfectly

accurate about what this ordinance does, Your Honor, it is
not restricted to what I think sociologists would characterize
as a nuclear family, because the familial bond which
satisfies this test can be a good deal more remote than the
nuclear family.

It can be, for example, a remote cousin,

uncle, grandfather,
QUESTION:

Well, tribal.

They can’t define it in

tribal terms.
MR, SAGER:

Tribal terms may be more accurate,

Your Honor,
QUESTION; Well, your clients do not form a family,
do they?
QUESTION;

By your definition they do, don't they?

MR. SAGER: They do not — I think we'd have to ask
whose definition was being drawn on, Your Honor.
sociologists' definitions, I'm not sure? by

By

the Village of

Belle Terre's, certainly not. By mine, they certainly formed
a single housekeeping unit.

As a practical matter, their

dinner was —
QUESTION:

My question was:

is it family —■

f-a-m-i-l-y.
MR. SAGER: They are not what I would call a family,
Your Honor.

32
QUESTION: So they wouldn't qualify under the
regular ordinance if they are restricted to single-family
dwellings.
MR. SAGER: Well,, many of those —
QUESTION:

Isn't that right?

MR. SAGER:
ordinances are read.
QUESTION:

It depends very much on how those
Ordinances —
13ut the ordinance says no more than

one family may live in any dwelling in this Village.
MR. SAGER:

Many State courts confronted with

ordinances like that have said that groups like these
students may live in such a — in such a community.

It

depends —
QUESTION:
MR. SAGER:

You mean it’s a family?
Many State courts have held so, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Many ?

MR. SAGER:
QUESTION:
MR. SAGER:

A substantial number.
Over two?
Over two.

I can't give you the exact

number.
[Laughter.]
QUESTION:

What's the limit on the numbers.

have six in this case, haven't we?
MR. SAGER:

Yes

We

33

QUESTION:

Well, what about twelve?

Would you

make the same arguments with respect to twelve?
MR. SAGER:

I wouldn't — I would not quarrel, and

the appellees would not quarrel, Your Honor, with any
ordinance that imposed reasonable occupancy standards, in
terms of numbers, on household residencies, and did so not
merely to people who are unrelated by blood, adoption or
marriage, but across the board.
Many communities in the United States, for example,
have addressed the problem, which we don't believe the Village
possesses or was addressing here, of density by stipulating
density of occupancy on the basis either of the square feet
of dwellings or on the basis of the number of bedrooms in a
household unit.
Such a neutral standard, which spoke not to the kind
of person who lived in the community but to the extent to
which they adequately use or surcharged the residential
facilities in that community, we would and could have no
quarrel with.
QUESTION: Then, I take it your answer is that if
the house is large enough, you'd be making these same
arguments with a community group of twelve?
MR. SAGER: Except, Your Honor, I think if this
Village or another community wanted to, it could also
regulate the size of its houses,

I mean, if the community

34

has at its disposal simple constitutional and socially
unobjectionable ways of securing the end of regulating
density.
QUESTION; Well, the Village might find it very
socially objectionable to penalize an impoverished large
family by saying that you couldn't have more than one child
to a room, or some tiling like that.
The Village might find that intolerable as a
matter of social policy.
HR. SAGER:

I think they might, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

So don't — I think you're quite wrong

in indicating this would be very easy for them to do as an
alternative.'
HR. SAGER:

I think -- I think, Your HOnor, that

if density were a serious concern of the community, it could
certainly impose standards which would secure a maximum
density in the community in this way.

It could permit very

large structures for families or other groups in so doing.
Let me say that, and make perfectly clear, because
I think the argument of the appellants here has been a little
misleading, this ordinance has been justified below and
justified in the brief by the appellants here on two very
different kinds of grounds.

And it's critical, I think, to

separate out those grounds, and to delineate the two
different positions that, as appellees, we take to

.each of

35

tliose grounds.
On the one hand, the Village has candidly
acknowledged that it intended, as it clearly must have when
it passed this ordinance, to project into law the social
preferences of the residences of the Village of Belle Terre
for a socially homogeneous community, for a community in
which neighboring households would be comprised exclusively
of traditional families.
And, on the other hand, the community has argued
that very much more orthodox interests, such as density of
population, transiency of population, and rental level,
support tiiis ordinance.
I low, as to the former, we claim, and I believe that
tiiis is the crux of the case, that it is simply not a
legitimate interest of government to divide the society into
socially homogeneous residential enclaves.
QUESTION:

Mr, Sager, how do you define socially

homogeneous families?
MR. SAGER:
QUESTION:

Socially homogeneous families?
Yes.

You keep referring to the purpose

of the ordinance being to create a community of 220 houses
all containing socially homogeneous families," how would you
define such a family?
MR, SAGER:

Your Honor, —

QUESTION:

No restrictions on what types of families

36

may enter this community, are there?
MR. SAGER:

There are no restrictions on what kinds

of families nay enter this community, —
QUESTION:

IIow can you say they are socially

homogeneous, then?
MR. SAGER:

I don't think I can, Your Honor.

The Village clearly, by its own statements, hopes that the
kinds of people who share these ties of blood, marriage, or
adoption, will in some way comprise households which are
more congenial to the present residents of the Village,
QUESTION:

Isn't the difference really what you

consider family and what I consider family, and what we were
talking about a minute ago; isn't that what it is?
MR. SAGER:

I'm not sure, Your Honor, because I

think the question may be *— one may have to ask a question
which precedes the discussion of what a family is:

namely,

whether communities should be allowed to divide themselves
into enclvaes for families, however divided, into enclaves
for single people — ,
Since the establishment of comprehensive
municipal land-use regulation in this country, there have
been a variety of attempted which sound of the quality of the
Belle Terre ordinance.

As we suggest in our brief,

communities have attempted to exclude the physically or
psychologically infirm; communities have attempted to exclude

37
the old; communities have attempted to exclude the young;
communities have attempted to exclude families with children;
communities have attempted to exclude families without
children.

And the Village of Belle Terre and some other

communities have attempted to exclude those people who form
a household, whose ties do not enjoy the familial blood,
marriage or adoption ties,
QUESTION:

Well, those are quite different cases,

very interesting cases, but quite different ones, the ones
you just talked about; Belle Terre hasn't presumed to
exclude children or old people or young people,
MR. SAGER:
QUESTION;
anything else.

Just unrelated people.
Or people of any particular race or

This is quite a different case, is it not?

MR. SAGER;

I think, Your Honor, it is not a very

different case from the ones I've set out.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that government has

no interest in the preservation of the nuclear family?
MR. SAGER:

I think, Your IlOnor, as this Court has

made clear, as recently as its decision in Weber vs. Aetna,
the government clearly does have a legitimate interest in
the preservation of the nuclear family.
QUESTION; Certainly.

That's what all the laws, the

civil laws about marriage and divorce and child dependency
and all of domestic relation law is all about.

38

MR. SAGER:

Absolutely.

QUESTION: For centuries it's been considered a
legitimate interest of government, has it not?
MR. SAGER;

It has, Your Honor.

I think 'the

question is whether the Village's ordinance in any way
speaks to the preservation of the nuclear family.
All that the Village has argued that this does,
vis-a-vis the nuclear family, is to provide the nuclear
family with residential neighborhood — neighbors who are
similar to it in being nuclear families.
I

How this speaks to the preservation of the institu­
tion of the family.is not something which —
QUESTION: Well,
MR. SAGER:
QUESTION:

— is indefensible.
— that you will price families out of

the market in Belle Terre.
brother's argument.
MR. SAGER:

tile argument is —

You're familiar with your

You can't disregard it.
No, I —> and we certainly don't, Your

Honor.
As regards the argument which has been advanced by
the Village, in terms of pricing the families out of the
market, there are several propositions which I'd like to make
very clear, because I think the Village has failed entirely to
demonstrate either that this possibility exists in Belle Terre
or that this ordinance in any way would address such a

39

possibility»
Let me make clear the state of the record on this
matter.
First of all, there's no indication whatsoever that
in this small, middle-class suburban community that there are
any substantial number of rental units available at all.
In their canvass of the Belle Terre community, in their one
affidavit speaking to this question, the Village was able
to come up with only two other houses available for rental,
other than the Dickman house, which was the original subject
of this litigation below.
So this is a Village which, in all probability,
does not today and will not in the future have any substantial
number of rental units available at all.
QUESTION: But, of course, that itself is a matter of
supply and demand, isn't it?

If, in fact, you succeeded in

invalidating the ordinance, and owners find that they can get
two or three times as much as they now could by renting to
groups of six students, maybe there will be a lot more
rentals available.
MR, SAGER:

Your Honor, there's no indication in

the record, and I think it's no intuitive justification for
the proposition that six students occupying a house are
going to be willing or able to spend any more than the middleclass families that live in Belle Terre today.

40

QUESTIONS Well, but the question is whether the
Belle Terre Village board could reasonably have thought that
might be the case.
HR. SAGER:

Your Honor, if there was a shred of

evidence —
QUESTION:

Like three judges or five judges, they

might not pay more, either; hunh?
HR, SAGER:

Three judges or five judges might,

Your liOnor, although it's significant to note that by the
Village's own definition of its perception of the problem,
it was the student population that it was concerned with,
and not a set of wage-earners that it was concerned with in
this instance.
Your Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in response to
your question, I think that if it were the case, that the
Village could have shown itself to have in any sense perceived,
examined, analyzed the existence of a problem, namely, that
ther'e was an inadequate supply in the Village or in the region
of which it’s a part of single-family homes for single
families, in that situation and in the situation where there
was some coordinated effort on the part of the Village and
other communities to adjust to this need, I would say that
this was entirely the kind of governmental judgment which
could be made.
There is, however, in the record absolutely no

41

indication that the Village had this in mind when it passed
the ordinance, that it examined the situation, or that it
set out to adjust this need.
QUESTION: That isn't the test, as I understand it,
under economic equal protection.

The test is whether the

legislative body, under any hypothesis, could have rationally
conceived this to be the case.
I don't believe, at least as I read the cases,
they have to come into court and prove that they in fact
considered it, or that they did research and here's what
they come up with.
QUESTION:

We don't have -- it would overrule

Euclid v. Ambler, couldn't it?
MR, SAGER:

I don’t ~

QUESTIONs And the whole doctine of the presumption
of validity of zoning lav/s.

There is a presumption of their

validity, .isn't there?
MR. SAGER;

There is a strong presumption, and a

justifiable presumption —
QUESTION:

Right.

MR, SAGER:

•— of their validity, Your Honor.

I do not believe that to hold that in this case
would in any sense threaten that presumption, because again I
want to make very clear that you have here a situation where
an ordinance, by its operative criterion, addresses itself to

the kind of person who lives in a community, and where the
Village, by its own admission, has as a primary interest the
exclusion of uncongenial households.

In this situation, it

seems to —
QUESTIONj Well, that may be one way of putting it,
but wouldn't you make the same argument if they just came at
it by way of the density?
MR* SAGER;

No,

Then I think one could address

density very much more on the merits, if one had an
ordinance which was •— which, by its terms, was rationally
adopted to addressing the density problem,

I think one would

have a totally different case here.
What I think we have here is a case that is very
much like this Court's decision in Department of Agriculture
vs, Marino, and very much like this Court's decision in its
in the recent Le Fleur case, in particular Mr. Justice
Powell's concurring opinion in the Le Fleur case, in this
important respect;
You have iiere an obvious -- and also I should say
this Court’s decision, I think, in Eisenstadt vs. Daird
you have here a case where the obvious primary and dominant
motivation of the community was one which is either patently
invalid or highly suspect.
And you have here what I think we must agree are
really, to use Mr. Justice Powell's term, after the fact

43
rationalizations for this ordinance.
Now# if this Court adopts literally the language of
McGowan, or the Lindsley case# long before McGowan# in
addressing these after-the-fact rationalizations# then what
really happens is

that an ordinance motivated# and admittedly

motivated# by what I think this Court must conclude is a
legitimate — is an illegitimate interest of government# will
necessarily pass constitutional muster —
QUESTION:

there's nothing — I didn’t understand your brother even

this ordinance.

And, demonstrably# it isn't.

Nothing about the families having to be compatible#

QUESTION:
MR. SAGER:

It isn’t — excuse me.
Excuse me, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well — never mind.
MR. SAGER;

I just wanted to go on to say that is,

I think, significant to note, and I have not yet said it,
that the District Court found as a matter of fact that this
ordinance was not rationally related to any of these
orthodox interests, be they density, transiency, or rent
level.
And the Court of Appeals concurred in that judgment.
There is a substantial analytical disparity between
the position of the District Judge and the majority below,
but the one tiling they have in common was a complete and
comfortable rejection of the view that these more orthodox
interests of government could be the basis for justifying
this ordinance.
Their discrepancy was in the District Judge's
perception that the interest in having families arid, in having
family organization was the justifiable interest, and the
Court of Appeals concluding that that had no place in a unit
or subdivision of government.

And that, I think, is the crux of this case.
I think it's critical to examine the more orthodox
or traditional interests which are proffered, but critical
to examine them only to realize that they are indeed afterthe-fact rationalizations of an ordinance which should rise or
fall on very different constitutional grounds, I think.
I think, with the aid of your questioning, I’ve
addressed two of the governmental interests which the Village
has advanced, namely density, where I've tried to show that
the community has no density problem.
community.

It's a fully developed

It could regulate overcrowding of its facilities

comfortably, if it wished.

And it presently enjoys or suffers

a density of population of 1.1 persons per acre.
There's no demonstration whatsoever that in 1371,
when til is ordinance was adopted, as late as 1971, there was
any reason that this community did or could have feared a
sudden influx or change in the density of population.

And,

more importantly, even if it could, I hope that I have
demonstrated that it's an — this is an utterly hopelessly
crude and arbitrary way of achieving it.
The one fact which I did not mention in this
connection is that Census data indicates that far from the
intuitive proposition that somehow families are selfregulating in unrelated households or not, that the average
size of families is considerably larger than the average size

46
of unrelated housdholds.

And that you would --

QUESTION;

In tills community?

MR. SAGER;

Throughout the country.

QUESTION:

Well, we're not --

MR. SAGER:
QUESTION:
MR. SAGER:

The Census data, Your Honor, is -We’re concerned with this community.
~~ not broken down by communities that

we have; however, it is broken down by kind of community, and
it's very plain that these figures hold for suburban
communities on the urban fringe, like Xelle Terre, as well
as for the city and as well as for the rural areas,
QUESTION: Suppose the City Council in, or the Zoning
Board, governments, in laying out their plan for this kind
of a city, said:

Our objective is to try to maintain not

more than an average of three per household acre, and that
while we may not be able to achieve it perfectly, that's our
objection.

That being articulated, you say that their

density now is 1.5 —
MR, SAGER:

1,1.

QUESTION:

1.1 per acre.

So they've come well

under the three that I postulate.
Then you say that's not a legitimate governmental
interest to say that one way to keep that in control is to
eliminate boarding houses, fraternity houses, and households
of unrelated people more than two?

47
MR, SAGER:

I think that it — that it may be very

sensible to limit a certain patent high-density uses under
certain circumstances , where reasonable densities are at
s take.
The actual numbers involved, I think I'd have to
consider much more closely.
I don't think, however, that, unlike the boarding
house and the fraternity house, that in any way one rationally
addresses density of population by speaking to the familial
tie that exists between the residents of a household* in
letting in any number of household servants on the one hand,
any number of people related by this tie on the other hand,
and then choosing a number like two on the other hand,
I think it's also important to note that the number
two not merely is unusually low in this regard, and therefore
makes the ordinance, in some sense, less rational? it seems
to me it supports strongly the view that this ordinance was
not designed, in any sense, to regulate density of population.
The choice of the number two I've already described
to you.
QUESTION:

If the number were five, would you

still be here?
MR, SAGER:

I think I would, Your HOnor, yes.

QUESTION:

What provision, specifically, of the

Constitution are you relying on?

48

MR* SAGER:

We're relying,,Your Honor, primarily

on the first section of the Fourteenth omendment.

Let me

make —
QUESTION: Due process clause,
HR, SAGER:

Well, the due process and equal

protection clauses,
QUESTION: All right.
HR. SAGER:

The reason I am so guarded in that

statement is, in addressing, as Your Honor knows, in
addressing the issue of whether this is a legitimate govern­
mental interest, we make substantial reference and rely
heavily on the rights of privacy and the right of travel.
And while this Court has indicated a strong tendency to found
those very explicit, now explicitly recognized and wellarticulated rights in the Fourteenth Amendment, I think that
this Court has avoided ever firmly concluding the debate as
to precisely where the right of travel and right of privacy
derive their force from in the Constitution*
And I certainly would be hesitant to be any more
explicit than this (ourt has been on that subject.
QUESTION:

And of course the courts have said

that the right of interstate travel is not derived from the
Fourteenth Amendment,

Haven't the courts said that?

HR. SAGER:

I don't think it has —

QUESTION:

I wrote that in Guest v. United States.

49

MR. SAGL'R;

,

I think however, in Shapiro vs.

Thompson, this Court specifically eschewed finding a specific
location for the right of travel at all.
My time is up.

Thank you very much.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Sager.

Do you have anything further?

You have five

minutes left, Mr. Gegan.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD E. GEGAN, ESQ.,
ON BEIIALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. GEGAM:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Well, certainly we don’t believe that this zoning
lav;, which is the most local of matters, interferes with the
right to travel.
QUESTION:

On that argument, I suppose, any law

would interfere with the right to travel? you'd say it
impairs my'right to travel to this place, because they have a
law here that I don't like.
MR. GEGAN:

Anything would, Your HOnor,

QUESTION:

Isn't that correct?

MR. GEGAM:

I only pose to note that there's no

allegation in this case by the plaintiffs that they engaged
in interstate travel, to get where they are.
The Census data, which seeks to indicate that
families are, on the average, larger than unrelated households,
is — could be misleading.

The Bureau of the Census, which,

50

incidentally, defines family in terms of blood, marriage and
adoption, defines household to include single people living
alone.
So, of course, the average household, being
weighted with single people, will be low; will be low, so it's
not fair to compare it with families, which begin with two.
I again wish to say that, to the extent that the
one-family zoning ordinance embodies both the physical
benefits and the

social well-being of family organization,

I'll stand by that principle and don't consider it an
illegitimate purpose,'
It is not the same as saying that this is some kind
of a morals law to keep out undesirables.
The recent Wisconsin District Court case, furnished
in the appellants — in the appellees green supplemental
brief.

Two families occupying a one-family residence.

They would — and following the Belle Terre case, the District
Judge said;

they can't be kept out under the zoning law.

Well, if that's not the end of one-family zoning, I
don't know v/hat is.

And it certainly has nothing to do with

keeping out undesirables.
And my last point is, that while some families
may be larger, some families may even have a servant, whereas
a group of three spinsters may be small, Euclid v. Ambler
itself said that uses, whether it's a boarding house, a

51
fraternity house, or private residence occupied by a group of
individuals, uses tend to fade into each other by imperceptible
gradations.

And that does not put the stamp of invalidity

on a zoning ordinance which seeks to draw some reasonable
line, based on the average family.
QUESTION: If ^ou could draw up an ordinance and
prevent fraternity houses and boarding houses, you wouldn’t
have any trouble, would you?
MR* GEGAN:

You could do that*

We would risk the possibility that the

court might interpret six students living in a private
residence as not being a fraternity house.

This seeks to

dot the I and cross the T, so to speak.
QUESTION; Well, I think you'd be in much better
shape.
Do you admit that this is aimed at those students?
MR. GEGAN:

The primary source of the influx into

Belle Terre, should it ever happen, I anticipate would be
students.

But the ordinance itself covers any — as I say,

two families that moved in —
QUESTION:

Who else around there would invade your

privacy other than students?
MR, GEGAN: All right.

The practical source of

unrelated individuals in the case of Belle Terre is students.
But the ordinance is not limited to students, it's not that
kind of —

52

QUESTION; There's nothing in your ordinance that
prevents two students from coming in and renting a house.
MR. GEGAN:

Exactly

so, Your Honor.

And I would only conclude by saying that zoning
has traditionally been considered a matter of local
responsibility, and this Court has wisely refrained from
becoming a national board of standards and appeals to hear
applications of variances from zoning,
I thank the Court,
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted,
[Whereupon, at 10:56 o'clock, a.m., the case in
the above-entitled matter was submitted.]
