ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH A. JONES, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OP THE PETITIONERS

MR. JOtmS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it P,lease the

Court:
The issue here is whether in a case involving a routine tenni.nation action against a federal probationary employee
the federal district court may enjoin the termination Pending
that employee's appeal to the Civil Service Commission.

The

£acts are as follows:
In 19- -- In January, 1971, the respondent was hired
as a P,rogram analyst by the General Services Admin;.stration at
a salary of about $18,000 a year.

Pour months later, her --

one of her l'll\lllediate SUT>ervisors sent to his supervisor, a Mr.
Sanders, a 1aemorand\D'll recommending that her employment be termina.ted.

His recommendation set forth a variety of reasons why

her work performance was considered to be unsatisfactory and
inadequate.

Among these were her failure to follow the instruc-

tions of her su-oervisor, to follow office direction generally,
and her inability to get along with her fellow enrployees.
The memorandum went on, however, to state that she

4

had experienced similar difficulties with her previous employer ,
Defense Intelligence Agency.
After studying this recommendation, ltt. Sanders issued to the respondent a notice terminating her employment ,
effective the next week.

The termination notice stated ex-

pressly that the reasons for her termination were her failure
to abide by office procedure and to accept the direction of
her supervisors.
Upon receiving this termination notice, the respondent filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission, and
lodged a complaint in the United States district court for the
District of Columbia.

In her complaint in the court, she

alleged, or she asked for, injunctive relief pending the appeal
to the Civil Service Commission, and she alleged that if an
injunction would not issue permitting her to stay in employment,
she would lose income for the interim period, and unrebutted
charges against her would remain in her personnel record.

The

district court immediately granted a temporary restraining
order against her termination and set a hearing for the following
week on the merits.
Before describing the events at that hearing, it is
helpful to first suramarize briefly the civil service regulations pertaining to federal probationary employees, so that the
grounds for her appeal to the Civil Service Commission can be
better understood.

5

Under the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, permanent employees
in the competitive service, that is, eml_)loyees who have finished
their one year probationary term, may be disch~rgcd only for
cause.

But the Act does not provide similar protections for

p robationary employees durinq their first year of service; under
tne Act, such P.mployees may be terminated at will.

Under the

regulation,:;, however, of the Civil Service Comrnis!'lion, certain
i:ights are granted to i:,robationary em1)loyees.

Among these are

ri<ihts not to be ter.ni,1ai:ed because of i.1vidious class-

thA

based discrimination, :narii:al status, political activities, or
im".lroner discrimination because of physical disability.
In addition, although a probationary emoloyee may be
terminated upon the discov~ry of preemploy:uent misconduct, termination on ti,at ground does invoke, under the civil oervice
regulations, certain procedural orotections.

The employee must

be informed of the charges of '_)reemployment misconduct against
him,
<. 1 •

However, at that time, tmon her reJ.nstatewent, ha,: era-

requested that !~. Sander11, the G.S.A. official who had ordered

Our

t!n.t the general statutory and adminis-

trative sc;tlcrr.e a,:werni.ng federal el'lplcyrnent precludes the exe:rcis3 of es1u.itable jurisdiction in cases such as this.

This

e1che;,:e, whic. I ,1ill describe in a mo:n,mt, must be understood
in its dec~sio~al oontev.t.

uneor the decisions of this Court ,

a federal e,11oloyee, in t,1e absence of a.1y protective legis l ation or regulations, has no right at all to employmEent -- h i s

8

elll'9loyment 111ay be terminated at will.
Following this general rule, the Court expressly
held, in White v. Berry, which we cite in our brief, that the
federal courts have no general equity jurisdiction to enjoin
the discharge of a t>robationary -- or of a f~deral employee,
rather.

That case involved a discharge which allegeclly 1,ms

in conflict ,1ith the pertinent civil service regulations at
In short, White v. Berry involves essentially the

that time.

ident-.ical issue here, and this Court could not affir111 without
overruling that case.
In any event, w:i.th that decisional background, Conq:res~,, in 19 lZ decided to er.tend certain additional t>rotections
to ceLtain (~deral employees,

It enacted the Lloyd-LaPollettc

Act, 1-rhich, as 1. have prev-Lously stated, affords to nonprobaticnai.-y employees in the coniocti ti ve service the protection
that they may be di•;charged only for cause.

Subsequent enact-

1\ltlnts and promulgated regulations have established for such employees t:he ell.'borate appeal procedures which are now before
diis Court in Arnetc v. I~ennedy, which was argued last week.
~owevar, in enacting the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, the
Congress determined tnat ~here should be a one year probationar:y ':arr, during which the emplcyee would nut be afforded such
pt·~cedn;.·es, could. he termi~ated without a "for cause" ter111inat:io11 ·- ... detevr\ri:tation.
Q

Mr. Jonesc, if the government loses this case,

9

could the requlation in question be revoked ,,ithout any constitutional overtones?
MR. Jom:s:
Blackmun.

Yes, I believe it could, Mr. Justice

There is nothing in the statute which requires the

Civil Service COlTil!lission to provide the pr.obntionary employees
the kind of procedural protections which the respondent here
is relying upon.
Q

In :·!hite v. &rry, of course, you didn't have the

claimed violation of the administrative regulation, did you?
MR. ,TONES:
was such a cla;_m.

Ur. Justice Rehnquist, I think that there

Thi,; -- t-.hat case, oi: course, took place

before th'-' enect·.cnt of the Lloycl-·LaFollette Act, but in 1883,
C.O11grcss had established the Civil Sc-rvice Connnission, and the
Comni:Jsion ha<l pror,1v.lgated certain regulations.

And I think

the claim in Wnite v. Berry was that the dismissal was in 7iolation of one of those regulations.
Q

Incident~lly, just a tag end --

Is the respon-

dent still working with G.S.A.?
MR. JONES:

Ic's my understanding that she is, Mr.

Ju.'3tice Blackmun.
A c~ntral fe~ture o~ this scheme, hm,ever, which applies to both probationa,:y nnd nonorobationary emoloyees alike,
is that taminai:.ion becomes effective prior. to appeal to the
Civil Sei:vic~ Corr.mission.

The employees have certain rights

of appeal; as to probationary e,nployees, those rights are lirn-

10
ited.

But, nevertheless, there's no otatutory or regulatoxy

provision for them to remain in their em~lo-Jment pending the
appeal to the Civil Service Commission.
Q

As I understand it, Mr. Jones, your -- the govern-

ment's position is that there's no equity jurisdiction at all
in this kind of a case because there is a fully adequate remedy
at law in terms of reinstating the employee and giving back
pay with interest, and, perhai:>s, costs --

MR. JONES:
Q

Yes --

if the dcteX1nination, for any reason, is de-

tel:'l!lined to h.:iv0 been irorop.;ir.
MR.

Jm,.:s:

That involves the l.lack

tlP time of the aTJneal to ~he Civil Servic.i Commission, and
there w;;i,; no mechanism for the orovision of such back pay.
l'nd this, of courz:e, was a problem wi1ich was aggravated by the
ra<.t that th,r; courts would not grant interim equitable relief,
b. cau:-:;, followi.ng chi;; Co.irt • s decision in lihi ta v. Berry,
·-iiat kind of ralicf w.:i::: de~med unavaila!:>le.
No,1, confronted •-1ith this dilemma, Congress could

11

It could have pro-

have dons any cornbinatio."l of three things.

vided the Civil Service Colll':lisaion with authority to grant back
pa~• upon ru·.nstatement.

!t could have granted the Civil Service

Commission the power to stay a ter.nination, pending appeal before the C011Ullisston, in aopropriate case.

Or it could have ex-

olicicly granted to the courts the power to provide the kind of
interim equit.':1.ble reli.ef that the district coii.rt here thought
that it could provide.
The Congress chose only to do the firs~ of these th ree
things:

only to provide the Civil Service Commission with the

po11c-r to award back pay, upon rainstatement.
,1a,:i a del.ib0):ate policy choice which \-:as
dc1l:e

j

This, we believe ,

ntended to accommo-

he rcsocctive intt'!r'3~ts of both the e·nployees and their

.rn,J oving agencie&.

On tho othei- hand, u.r1der. the Ace, he !>as no right to

romiu.n in <11'.'-?loyuent pending hoaring of his appoal by the Civil
Service Commission.
We be:ieve that the exercise of equitable jurisdiction,
which the district court here engaged in, is disruptive of the
bal,mc"1 which CoT\gress was seeking to achieve between the federa 1. cmplc>yees and the intsrast of the government in an effi··
cient civil service.

Th9 retention of a di3charged eraployee - -

a~ emplc:ree •.Iho has :ceC<!iV'!d his terruination notice

pending

reviei· before the C-:xmnission, which could take as long as six

12

months in some cases, would be bad for morale of the agency
and bad for discipline within a particular deoartlllent in which
she was located.

And if the termination had any basis -- that

is, if, in fact, it was for poor Performance, then it would be
bad for the efficiency of the government of the emi>loying agency
as well.
The citizens of this country rely upon the government
to provide a wide array of necessa:cy services, from national
defense to social welfare.

And the abilitv of the government

to provide tilese services quickly and efficiently shouldn't
be interfered ~it.~, or hampered by the forced retention of an
employee found by his supervisors to be incomoetent or unwilling
to fol.lo·-, direction, or for sone other reason -- unqualified
Zor further service.

JO~lES:

The exact scope of the ruling -- well, I

glm'Vi it wo·1ld, tr. Chief Justice.

The court did not restrict

itself: to any narticu1ar class of employee, and I suppose this
would apply to permanent employeos as well as Probationary employees.

And it •~ould apply to -Q

;iell, if it applies to probationai.y it would be

a fortiori that .it uould apply to permanent emoloyees, with
thei.r greater degree of orotection --

13
MR. JONES:

I WOlild assume so.

And, so far as I can

tell, it's not limited to any particular group of effl?loyees -it's not limited to employees whose services may not be important to national defense, or any other important government
operation.

So that, although in a futura case the Court might

decide not ar,oly that rule in a special case, there is nothing
in the Court's language itself which would so limit it,
There isn't -Dees the Act e:icpressly forbid the Civil Service

Commission from keeping the person on the job, pending appeal?
MR, JONES:

I believe there is nothing cxplici t to

that effect, however, there is nothing which g.cants the Co!Ullli.ssion power to do that, and the Commission has never viewed its~lf as having th~~ power.

•m. JO~.C::S:
ment, tl1at the rerr.cdy

I su,:,pose, in essence, that's our arguthat Congress has, in fact, provided

a gene>:al l·0mcdy at law, available to all federal employees,
and that, therefore, there should not be a case by case determination of the matter of adequacy.
N~,,

r think it's important to realize that the in-

terests of the employee do not outweigh the cost to the public.
If the employee is -- if the el!lPloyee succeeds uPOn his appeal

to the COll'roission, then int:erim injunctive relief would have
provided h:L"!l with absolutely nothing, because he is reinstated

Respondent, in her brief, I think, essentially i gnores the policy consider.ations that we've stated here.
relies prima.1:ily for her
upon the All Wrlta Act.

She

almost entirely for equitable relief
It seems clear to us that that Act

must be read in light of the oertinent statutory scheme.

The

Act, itself, rflquir~n the issuance of writ,:; to be, and I quote:
"agreeable to the u:;,ages and principles of law."
And this Court, in Arrow Transportation and other
ca.sos, has held that

d

federal court• s equitable pot<7ers \mder

the Act, if gran-.:.ed, can bE: implicitly withdrawn by the pertinent statutory schr.rro; that is, can he ,-,i thdrawn by the necessary implication of the statutorJ scheme.

In Arrow T~anspor-

tatior; th€lra was nothing in the Interstate Commerce Act which
would have expressly taken away from the district cour-W the
t:'!U:ltal.>le relief they sought there to grant.

l{evertheless, the

vie \·1ould contend, further, that the
e.oe··

'\?!:

J\lJ. Writs Act

r.rc;,crly extend to the kind of interim relief respon-

dent seeks h~re, at all.

That Act simply provides that the

federal cour.ts "may issue all writs necessary or appro-priate
h-1 aid of their raspeoti ve jurisdictions.•

This Court has

never read that Act as providing a broad power to grant preexhaustion relief in all cases.

This Court has permitted preex-

16
haustion relief of the !cind respondent seeks only in cases

where it's necessary to right a constitutional wr.ong, or to
preservC? th<! jurisdiction of the Court upon subsequent review;

t:..~~t is, to preserve the possibility of effective judicial
relief.

In the conte;•t. of this case, I th.illk that a ,:eading
of the 1>.11 Writs Act, w;1ich is so lirr.ited, and respondent concef.c?s in her brief that the All ,frits Act is so limited, I

ti",i11k that it practicc.'.lly dispos~s of this case.

•r:1e cou,ts h .. low did not r<;)ly upo11 their power to
p4~servG jurisdiction.

They didn't discuss that issue at all.

Ti1ey, ins1-cad, asserted a !)road newer to provide preexhaustion
relief: whenever and wherever they thought it necessary.

The

cou:r.t of ap?e~l~ explicitly saw its role as that of breathing
life into the civil service r.:;gulations; that is, of giving

The resoono€',1t: caeeks to defend the decision below,
finally,

0,1

the g-:-ound th.it irrterim injunctive relief here,

po"lding exhaustion of he:c administrative remedies, may have
been necessary to preserve jurisdiction.

Respondent, however,

17

does not suggest how, in this kind of case, interim injunctive
relief could be relevant to the subsequent assertion of jurisdiction.

The i1~~ediate discharge of the respondent from the

G.S.A. would in no way limit this Court's reviewing authority

over the subsequent ao1:>eal from the Civil Service Commission
detcnnination.

Nor would it prevent the Court from providing

the kind of relief, and the only kind of relief, which Congress
has made available here:

reinstatement with back pay.
