MR. CHX2F JUSTICE LURG3R:

tvo will hear arguments

next in 72-1188, Schlesinger against Reservists Committee.
Mr. Solicitor General, yon may proceed whenever yoii
are ready.

Let me say at the outset that 1 am not sure just

what considerations impelled us to enlarge the time to an hour
and a half hare.

I want to assure both counsel that there will

be no penalty imposed if you confine yourself to one hour total,
half hour each or something near that.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT II, BORK, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BORKi

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
I will try to please the Court in just that regard.,
if I

can.
This was a suit brought by the respondents, the

Reservists Committee to Stop the War

and several named

members of the military reserve, in order to compel the
Secretary of Defense and the.Secretaries of the Army, Navy,
and Air Force to remove active—to remove Congressmen now in
office from the military reserves and to reclaim pay and for
other remedies not now in issue.
The theory of the case is that Article 1, Section 6,
Clausa 2, which—the second half of that clause,, which states,
"No Person holding any Office under the United States, shall

\

4
is C

be a Member of either House dura

tinuane

The theory of the case is that that clause places a-a
obligation upon the executive brand
courts, to purge from the reserve ranks all Congressww:. ■ . :.v
in office»
The court cf appeals held for the plintiffs, the
respondents here, in a summary judgment, denying the
government summary judgment, and issued a declaratory judgment
only.

I am sorry, the district court did that.

The court of

appeals affirmed that opinion except for one remark concerning
standing, which we will come to. •
The government will urge reversal here upon each of
three grounds.

We will urge first that under no theory of

standing have these respondents standing to maintain this
action either as taxpayers or as citizens *
We will argue, second, that the question ok whether
a reserve commission is an office that disqualifies ifcr holder:
from membership in Congress is an issue of qualification for
membership of Congress and therefore by Article 1, Section 5,
Clause 1, is committed to the exclusive determination of the
Ho«--o in which the member sits.

It is a political question

and therefore non-justiciable.
We will contend finally that membership in the
reserves, particularly of the type involved here, is under
no construction of the word "office" an office within the

«

We have discussed standing at length in our brief,
and iri"October, in the Richardson case, it was discussed at
length, and I think it is possible to be fairly brief about
the standing issue here.

It is a streightforward one.

Respondents8 complaint claims standing as citizen.-',
and taxpayers and the injury alleged is that the presence of
Congressmen in the military reserves deprives respondents of
a right to unbiased consideration—this is a quotation. •from
their brief—of measures before the Congress affecting the
military establishment and appropriations therefor and
measures relating to military action, war, and peace.
The district court, as I say, denied taxpayer
standing but granted citizenship standing.
appeals in affirming, cited Flant

v.

The court of

Cohen and thus seemed

to say that perhaps there was taxpayer standing her a as we li­
as citizenship standing.
I think it is clear that no standing exists under
either theory.
Our brief discusses cases such as the students*
challenge to the regulatory agency procedures, the SCRAP
case? and we discuss at some length the fact that this Court
has extended the concept of standing by adding to the ksnds ot
injury that may be considered.

But, so far as

we know, there

has never been a case that says there need not be direct

6
injury, specific and perceptible harem,

it lias naver b-ten

enough in this Court for a
good government or in constitutional principles, and we think
that is absolutely clear from the brief and froic. Frofchlngham
v. Mellon, the Sierra. Club case, the SCRAP case, Ex Parte
Levitt, and so on.
Respondents attempt to evade this body of law with
the contention that their complaint alleges very specific
injuries, and those very specific injuries turn out to be
their inability to influence Congress, which is not specified
we do not know exactly how they were unable to influence
Congress.

And an inability, let us say, to

join with others

in an effort to make political advocacy effective.
Q

I suppose that the theory is that the 117 or

whatever number of members who hold reserve commissions are
not receptive to the arguments, political arguments, that
they want to advance, that they are not as open-minded as
Congressmen generally.
MR. BOEK;
Mr. Chief Justice.

I think that is part of the allegation,
I think it is an allegation that fails

because it is entirely speculative.

We do not know

specifically what measures were affected by this attitude.
We do not even know in fact that the attitude exists.
Respondents assume a one-way relationship between aentbership
in the reserves and a political attitude.

Respondents

:o hold

-

attitudes not in conformity with those they
Congressmen hold who are in the reserves.

that .the citation that HA&CP v. Button is utterly beside the
point -because there is no allegation herd**~indeedthere could
be none—that anybody and most particularly not Congress has
taken any action which prevents respondents from joining
together to make their political advocacy effective.

The

only claim is an attitudinal cle^im they claim about the
attitudes of Congress or about congressional reservists.
So that for these reasons they have alleged no
specific injury, no specific action.

Secondly, they are realty

complaining about attitudes that do not correspond to rhexr

own and assume, as I say.., a simple one-way relationship that
is not shown and I do not think could be shown.

And indeed

it occurs to me, as I think about that, that i do nor. icnow
f

how one would try an issue like that if you tried to

a

question of congressional attitudes, a question of fact -vu
show injury, you would have to try the issue ox congressional
motivation on particular pieces ot legislation, the.; motivation
of individual Congressmen, and that is an issue which this
Court has been loathe to gat into, at least, since Flefccner
v. Peck in 1810.
Finally, I think it is clear that respondents are

a
asse t'

of government, and that is precisely the InterestCourt has again and again—in Baker v. Carr and :m
Levitt—said does not suffice to confer standing»

I. think the political nature of respondents: thsory
of standing and what they—the breadth of that theory realty
appears at page 10 of their brief, in which they discuss the
fact that this Court, by expanding the concept of standing,
has done much to permit grievances of private citizens against
something described as an increasingly all-powerful government
to be litigated in the courts, not fought in the streets.
So, I taken it, it is a general right of petition by
citizens directly to the Court that is advocated here for
political grievance, and that is a theory of standing the
Court has never accepted and 2

I think should not accept tor

obvious Article III policy reasons.
They do attempt to analogize their case to Baker
v. Carr.

That, however, was a case in which uhderrepresantea

citizens could prove arithmetically that thexr votes were
devalued as much as if their ballots had been burned or the
voting age had been raised selectively for their counties.
And vie have already seen the reasons why that kind of

*

perceptible, calculable injury is not present in this case.
I should say about Ex Parte Levitt the respondent*
say of it in their brief at page 16 that Levitt's only

Si

i •'i t r v e 31 1r a -a;;; k i. n g / 'i:.a i.::: ■;; ■: a S i ication of Mr. Justice
Black on the first sect, i cm ox irt.icle X;, Section € r Clause
about senators not being appointed to civil office if the
emolument® have been increased daring the time he was a
senator—they say of that that Mr. Levitt’s status was only
that of a member of the bar, and he did not assert that
Justice Black’s alleged ineligibility could in any way deprive?
him, Levitt, of unbiased

consideration by the Court.

The moving papers in that case, as a matter of
fact, state only that Mr. Levitt was a member of the bar of
this Court.

However, the Court took it in the opinion as

both a citizenship claim and & mamber-of-the-bar claim, and
disallowed standing in the case.

I think it would be

instructive to—
Q

Ex Parte Levitt, a motion filed originally in

this Court, was it not?
MR. BORKs

That, is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.
not a lawsuit filed in the district

court.
MR. BORKs

No, a petition filed directly in this

Court.
Q

That was the original action?

MR. BORK;
Mr. Justice Douglas.
Q

That is correct.

It was not a complaint,

It was just a motion.

It was a motion to file an original action.

MR. BORK:
Q

Right.

It vas a motionperiod, vms’ it not?

MR. BORK:
Q

Yes.

Was net the- motion to start a suit in the

district court?
MR. BORK:

No, Mr. Justice Douglas, it was a motion

to have the Court issue an order to show cause why
Mr. Justice Black should not be disqualified from sitting
on this Court.
Q

But it did not invoke the original jurisdiction

of this Court as such.
MR. BORK:
Q

It was a motion filed here.

MR. BORKs
It

Not as such.

Yes.

would be instructive, I think, to imagine*

whether the result would have bean any different in that
petition had Mr. Levitt alleged that this clause was designed
to eliminate bias and that Mr. .Justice Black's service in
the Senate was likely to bias him in favor of broad national
powers, a position which Mr. Levitt did not like.
I cannot believe that that allegation, which would
make this case, which would make the Levitt case, just like
the case before usf would have bean enough to get Hr. Levitt
standing in that case.
Q

Was not the main burden of Mr. Levitt's

11
complaint that one of th.s nine member;;; of too Court vor;; not
legally here at all?
MRc -BGRK;
Q
litigant, if

That in correct,

Mr. Chief Jiv.Ctoo.,

And as a member of the bar or as a potential
he had a case here, and it might otherwise

.

eaually divided without the vote of that ninth member.
would be quite important
MR. BOSK*

to -him, would it not?

It would indeed, Mr. Chief Justice. I

think in that sense he would have had a much better claim to
standing than respondents here have.

But if you turn to it as

citizenship standing in the Levitt cosse and make the additional
allegation that. I have supposed, that as a citizen he was
disturbed by the judicial attitudes of Mr. Justice Brack and
that the Court would perhaps do things that he disapproved
of politically or judicially or some other way,

l

do.

nor.

think that allegation would have conferred stadninc? in tlm
Levitt case.

And yet that allegation makes the standing

issue there precisely the same as it is in this case.
Of Flaat v. Cohen 1 will say only that taxpayer
standing here does not enist, because Flaat v. Cohen lay»
down two requirements.

The first is that the-congressional

action challenge must have been an action taken under the
taxing and spending clausa; and the second is that the action
must be in derogation of the constitutional provision which
was intended to operate as a reatriction upon the taking and

speeding power»

leit es

is true here obviously

because the status hff Congresr-mc-n ns reservists is not
congressional action under the taring and spending clause».
And the second test is not met for the reason that this
Article I, Section 6, Clause 2, is obviously, as X thins foota
sides in this case agree, designed to prevent executive
domination of the legislative branch,

It is not arno'-on

n"

limit the taxing and spending power.
The district court denied taxpayer standing on
precisely this ground, and I would refer the Court, if X may,
to pages 2.9 and 30 of the government9 s petition for certiorari
where the district’s reasoning on that point xs contained«

I will not dwell upon 1 think the Article XXX
reasons, why standing remains a crucial concept to the
function of constitutional review or

judicial reviewr a

concept that requires that cases come up in specific factual
contexts which are instructive as to what general -principles
mean and to prevent the federal courts from being drawn into
philosophic debates immediately after the passage ot
legislation before anybody can show any direct opec:u:xc harm
or hot-? the legislation works.
I would like instead to pass, if 3
second of our arguments, which is that this claim xs a polivi.c
question,

which is therefore nontjusticiable.

As Baker

v. Carr tells us, a political question arises among .other

.13

ways when there is a demonstrable commitment of an issus

a coordinate branch of government»

And the qualification,

clause under Article I, Section 5, Clause 1, states that each
House

shall foe the judge of the elections, returns? and

qualifications of its own members.

The only question,

therefore, is whether the second half of Article X, Section 6,
Clause 2, states a qualification for membership in Congress.
If it does, I think that it is clear that it is a nonjusticiahle issue.
Q
Schlesinger

X thought that the remedy sought against
was to remove them from the list of reservists,

not for us to remove them from Congress.
MR. BORK:

That is quite true, Mr. Justice Douglas,

but if Congress is the exclusive judge of this issue, then ,1
think-“pardon me?
Q

It depends on what you mean by "this issue.”

MR. BORK:
Q

That is correct, but in order to—

This is not a challenge to their power to sit

in Congress.
MR. BORK:
Q

Not like the Powell case.

MR. BORK;

That is quite correct, it is not.

That is quite correct.

That is quite

However, the issue of the qualifications

would

have to be decided by the Court in order to issue an order
the executive branch to remove these Congressmen from the

reserve rolls# so that, the Court
judge the issue which we think is committed ercl.^rv-sly co
Congress.
If a man has been seated by
still there, we do not have to go any further, do wo?
MR. BORKi

Mr. Justice.Marshall, if -by that you mean

if he has been seated by Congress and he is stx.il tnere, tha-c
Congress is therefore, in that sense, to judge the issue, •think you need go no further, because I think the xssue xs
solely for Congress to decide.
Q

Is that not what is involved here?

MR. BORK:
q

That is correct.

Would you think it might ba different if after

a man was elected either House you were then confronted
a situation of a new commission emanating from the ©xscutxve
branch to the member of Congress for the .errsc nixae*
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, 2 do not think that

would be different, and the reason 2 do not is that it

seems

to :ra if the issue were exclusively committed to Congress,
then distinctions like that are not for the courts»*

xn«y

might be for Congress.

saying that that is no defense anyway, that until or unless
you are terminated from the service, there is an obligation
to pay your salary.
MR. BORK:
Q

I would suppose so.

Even though you were a deserter or a prisoner

of war or anything else.

So, that simply would not be a

defense.
MR. BORKs

X would suppose so, but I think that if

the Court, Mr. Justice Stevrvrt, reached that—

That is the Bell case.

Q

Congress would still retain the right to—not

MR. BORKs

commissions in the ar.oo.d services were incompatible with
membership in the House and did constitute—
Q

So that the. matter is not closed when they are

MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, the matter is not

Repeatedly Congress has acted under this clause to

vacate seats.

And as recently as 1963 the Senate passed a.

resolution which was not acted upon requesting the Senate
Judiciary Committe3 to consider the issue of reserve
memberships.
I think the issue is too clear actually for much

xi
discussion

I think the facta of the kiefs of xesass :•

consuls3ions that these C
would conclude that they
States»

n hold axe such that nob
were officers under the United

So that 1 think

entirely explicable.

But 2 would like to reserve the facts

of those for the moment to a demonstration that in fact this
does state a qualification.

The text and structure of this

statute, no person holding any office shall be a memberr
sounds very much like a qualification for membership in
Congress and indeed that is precisely the same structure that
the Constitution uses in Article I, Section 2 and 3, when it
states no person shall be a. member of the House and states
the age and the residence requirements and so forth.
In addition to' that, if you look at the two parts
of Article I, Section 6, Clause 2, the first part says no
senator or representative shall be appointed to office under
certain circumstances.

The second half says no person who

is in office shall be a member of either House.
So that obviously the first part states a
qualification for office and the second part states a
qualification for memberhip in the House.

And we know that

that the age and residence requirements of Article. I,
Section 2 and 3, for the House and Senate are not the
exclusive statements of qualifications, because the case of
Roudebush v. Hartke is where it is stated that indeed the

18
Seventeenth Araenclateeifc states a re /lilio; 5 .lor.
I think the history of the adoption of this clause
is adequately treated in our brief at pages 34

35,

think that history of the way this clause came into toir-,
demonstrates that it was intended as a qualification far
membership in the House and that this different way of stating
the two halves of the clause was intentional, and indeed I
would refer the' Court particularly to the quotation on page
35 of our brief of No. 52 of The Federalist in which James
Madison listed this precise part of Article I, Section 6,
Clause 2, as a qualification for Congress.
Q

I take it you suggest then that being in

Congress is not a disqualification for holding another
office?

MR. BORK?

Yes, I think that it is, Mr, Justice

White.
Q

So, the President or the services could

terminate anybody holding a reserve coirr,lesion when he was
elected to Congress?
MR. BORK:

I am sorry, Mr. Justice White,

1 thought

we 'aera discussing the first half of the clause.
Q
it

You are saying that it is.a qualification for—

states a qualification for being a member of the House

as though that is all it did.
MR.- BORKs

I think that is all it does do,

19
Mr. Justics Whita
Q

So, you do say that it is not & disquaiificatio*

for holding another office?
MR. BORK:

No, Mr. Justice White.

I' think it is

optional with the executive, should he decide that it is bad
policy to have two offices of any kind.

I do not think this

is an office with two positions of any kind combined.
do not think he is under any obligation, to refuse rroorve
membership to Congressmen.

I think both because Z thin

this is not an office under the United States but, more
importantly in the present context, because it is a political
question committed to Congress.
Q

When passing on the Levitt case back in the

thirties, the Court assumed that there was direct violation of
the constitutional provision, did it not?
MR. BORK:

Mr. Chief Justice, 1 do not believe so.

X do not believe so.
Q

Oh, you mean necessarily assumed it?

Yes, necessarily assumed it.

MR. BORK:
Mr. Chief Justice.

It depends on which issue you reach first
I

would think 1 could not honestly answer

that in the affirmative, that it necessarily tifirmad that.
I think it just did not get to the—Q

Assumed it arguendo, so to speak.

MR. BORK:
Q

So to speak.

At least for the purposes of the courts of

io
opinion there, the Court would hat® ruled the same

to"„•

if it had satisfied itself that there had be
of the Constitution, because that affected in no' way its
determination of the standing.
MR. BORK:

That is entirely correct, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist.
Q

The remedy there is that the President in 1937,

the Court was saying impliedly, should not have nominated and
the Senate should not have confirmed but having done so, the
Court was not going to get into it.
MR. BORK:

That is entirely correct if one tabes

that as an arguendo position; that is entirely correct,
Mr, Chief Justice.
We have in addition in our brief,- which I shall not
recapitulate on, a lengthy history of Congress's treatment
of Article I, Section 6, Clause 2, as a qualification over
which it has exclusive control.

The earliest case which is

cited is that of, in 1803, of Representative Van Ness.
Respondents cite that case to argue that the militia
commission there involved was like a reserve commission today.
I do not. know about that.

X do not know the historical

record well enough, and the record I have does not disclose
enough about that militia, commission.
Be that as it

may, what it doss show is that

Congress thought it had control of that issue as a

22
qualification issue, and that ■hhe'r.-o early cascae-

which

our brief are really quite important, bscauaa they ere a- .r;
close to the time of the Constitutional Convention

t-.

Congress clearly thought it was in control of this iacuc»
And I should stress. that Congress also has t--.icv.ght that it
deicd.es the meaning of this clause as well as the facts.

ftr.

wo chow in our brief on page 39 that in 1806, for exemplo,
the Congress

decided that a government contractor was not an

officer within the meaning of this clause.
I should say that respondents’ brief on this point
seems to me to contain a non sequitur.

At pages 28 and 29,

the respondents argue from the purpose of the incomp&tibi lity
clause, which is to insure the separation of the executive
and the legislative branches.
Then in the middle of page 29, they

say the purpose

is obviously equally well served, and the incompatibility
eliminated, whether the’ one office or the other is vacated.
Hence the incompatibility clause operates as a -restraint on
both the executive and the legislative.

Both are under an

equal obligation.
I think that is a non sequitur.

Of course, if

there is an incompatibility, which I think there is not, it
would be cured equally, whether the legislature or the
executive operated.

But that kind of argument means that

there is no issue in the exclusive control of another

.

22
.

...........

.

•

whatever is troublesome is cured equally well if the Court
acts instead of the Congress or if the executive acts
instead of the Congress»
So, the statement that the incompatibility, if it
exists would be eliminated if the executive were required he
act, in no way demonstrates that the issue in fact is ccrmitfed
to the executive or to the courts, suu the Constitution msthink in fact demonstrates the contrary.
I think it would be well to say just a word in
:

reserve cc

.....

I think they have beers overstated.
We have her® in the activa standby reserve, which
1 think is the only reserve status that even arguably could
be called an office, 20 members of Congress.

In the inactive

standby reserve we have 12 members ef Congress.

1 will not

mention the inactive standby reserve again because an inactive
standby reserve receives nothing and may not train even if he
volunteers for it.

It is an honorary status.

Than there are 58 members of Congress who are
retired without pay, and I take it one ought not to include
them in this—they are in the 107 Congressmen we are talking
about, but there certainly is—it co-id hardly ba called an
office to be retired without pay.
There are 16 Congressmen retired with pay, of whom

six are .retired for disability, ten for after a period of
service.

So, we have 20 res

I think it is demonstrable that in the active standby, that is
not only not an office unde

United States, but there is

no executive control over these men.

And recall the

Hartwell case, which is discussed in both briefs,, which
suggests that an office under the United- States is defined
by tenure, duration, emolument, and duties.
None of these categories, except the; active
standby, has any possibility of falling within
definition.

An actives standby reserve may apply for training.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DOBROVIR:

Mr. Chief Justice and Justices, may

it pleas® the Court:
The question before this Court today is the
interpretation of the incompatibility clause of the
Constitution, Article I, Section 6, Clause 2„ which prohibits
the same individual from holding at the same time an ore sative
branch office and a seat in the Congress.
The Solicitor General has stated the three issues
which are raised before this Court.

First of all, it see?***

to us whether or not this kind of reserve commission is an
office which the clause prohibits a member of Congress from
holding while, he remains a member.

Secondly, whether the

plaintiffs here have standing or that we are proper parties to
raise that issue.

And, thirdly, even if the pnswer to the

first two questions is yes, whether this is a politica-',
question that the Court should not decide.
The clause is older than our Constitution.

It

appeared first in the Articles of Confederation, and I believe
was first proposed eight days after our nation was born on
July 12, 1976 [sic] in the Continental Congress.

The entire clause or just the latter half

MR. DOBRQVIRs

The

the Continental Congrega should not hold any office at that
time under any of the states, because ve had a very rudimentary
national government, was in Article V, I believe,

And tha clause was stated in the

Articles of Confederation as in terns that no member of the
Continental Congress shall hold any office as to which there
are salaries, emoluments, or other.-Article V, Clause 2, of
the Articles of Confederation:

“Nor shall any person being

a delegate he capable o£ holding any office under the United
States for which he or any other for his benefit receive'::" <v.v*
salaries, fees, or emoluments of any kind»"
The matter was debated at considerable length during
the Constitutional Convention, and the debates are recorded
in our brief and also in the Solicitor General* n brief,,
will not repeat them»

;

But it is quite clear from the statements

of Mr. Blbridge Gerry, Mr. George Mason, Madicon, Hamilton,
and others, that the purpose of the clause was to prevent an
evil, which was quite palpable and obvious to the framers,
an evil that they saw rife in the English parliamentary
system under which the- officers of the Crown, by holding out.
the possibility of office and appointing member's of Parliament
to office, was able to control votes in the Parliament.
And so they erected an inflexible and absolute
barrior, as they thought, against any member ct the legislative

Would you say that the'bar was any more

Article I, Section 6, in which they were speaking directly to

And this, was rather

something more directly aimed at preventing any activity by
the members of Congress,
The second, half of the clause, the debates made
quite clear, were aimed not only at the Congress but indeed
oriv&rily, according to the debates, at thu- executive i,.*..anen
to prevent the executive

branch from encroaching upon, rrora

influencing the CoJcgrens.

The bar is more or less absolute

but i think it is important to note there were
different evils that they

5?

two

were aiming at.

The clause had a curious history and in attempting to
find why it ended up with the language it presently has,, ws
found that as it came out of the committee of detail os
August 6 th, and this is in the district court’ft csisics in
the appendix to the. ;

Lt3

for certiorari at page 19, it

said the members of each House shall be ineligible to and
incapable of holding any office under the authority of the
United States during the time for

which they shall respective!

be elected, and the members of the Senate shall be ineligible
to and incapable of holding any such office for one year
afterwards.
This was the incompatibility clause on that date.
It then came out of the committee—it went into the committee
of eleven, and this is quoted on page 34 of the government's
briefs

“The members of each House shall be ineligible to

any civil Office under the authority of

the United States

during the time for which they shall respectively be elected
And no person holding any office under the United States
shall be a Member of either House during his continuance in
office."
In that form the clause stated two things.

It said

no member shall hold any office while he remetiris a member, and

In the committee of eleven, according to ?s:crand,
that language was amended by the insertion after tha wo res
"United States" the following wordss

w...created or the
Because the clause,

as it stood, did not have within it the prohibition that yon,
Mr* Chief Justice? just referred to against—the one -that was
involved in Levitt--against the Congress creating offices
and then obtaining their own appointments to them,

hnd the

way in which this was accomplished was by insertion of that
language.

The rest of the clause remained the rwua.
We cannot speculite, because there is nothing in

the debates as to what the framers had in mind in doing
this.

It seems to xae that it

would be wrong to say that

by ioing that they intended to make the clause expressly
applicable only to a member, only to say that a person holding
an office shall not be a member, which is the interpretation
that the government has urged upon this Court.
It seems to me that what happened to the clause
during the debates does not, cannot lead us to that conclusion,
and that the history of it and its final language doss support
our contention that the clause is intended as an absolute bar
against members holding any office.
This is in turn supported by the later history of
the clause and in particular I would refer the Court to the

1899 House report, House Repos

which

Portions of which oar quoted, in or.-; brief.

Dure on yngc f‘; sb

that report the Congress refers to the interpretation of the
provision by James Wilson, who was one of the framers,

Indeed

who was one of the framers who him*
insertion of 'the incompatibility clause in the Constitution
and who"'also was one of the first members Of this Court.
And the report states that in lectures he delivered
in 1790 and 1791, he took the view and stated with respect
to this clause that it is a provision by which members of the
legislature will be precluded while they remain such from
offices.

And then he said that this provision binds with

great propriety a place in the Constitution of the United
States.

And in this important particular, it has a decided

superiority over the constitution of Great Britain.
Q

Where is that in your brief?

There is a second principle which is likewise expanded

In this case, as I understand it, every member who

Q

That he should have or that by being sworn into

the Congress that automatically vacates it? which?
MR. DOBROVXR;

As we read these

authorities, it

seems to say automatically.
Q

What you are suggesting then is that when each

of these members of Congress took his seat, automatically his
rus-.-rvv.. commission di 'appeared, terminated, or whatever?

MR. DOBROVXRs
I vv' f.f sny that.

Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Brennan,

Of course, that did not occur because there

had to be: some further action by one or the other of the

parries, either the person holding the commission who had just

33
been.elected to Congress, or the executive branch which continued .to maintain him in that status in c
status to end.

But in law it would seen, according to these

authorities, that he

should foe held to have vacated the

office and ail that remains is that that vacation foe deelere4
by a body competent to declare it, which brings mi to ' hquestion whether or not the clause establ
which is exclusively committed to the Congress.

fobs Solicitor

General has argued that it speaks as a qualification; and juat
like the qualifications of age and inhabitancy and oitironship,
it is the kind of qualification which this Court in Powell
v. McCormack said was committed only to the -Congress and
which could not be adjudicated by a court.
First of all, there is a difference in that those
:

tti

■-

■

vs

ot

pre-existing fact which no one can change.

.
And I snppse that

even the doctrine that, these are matters which are exclusively
committed to the Congress, cannot be absolute.

That, for

example, if the Congress were all of a sudden by vote to
say that a senator who wad SO years old

was only

years

1d

and thereby expel him from the Congress, that one way or anotnsr
that senator would

have the right to have some court, a

federal court and ultimately this Court, somehowor other
review that determination.
Q

What ie the relief you asked for in this case?

Has anybody raised the question if one of

these people here is not a Congressman?
MR. DOBROVIR:

ask, what

is the point?

We do not believe that the

qualification matter is a significant issue in this case,
but it has been raised and it has been argued effectively by
\

government, and we felt that we should respond to it in the
way in which we fe.lt it could be best answered.

I .think

Your Honor's answer is perhaps the simplest and the best
answer»

Q

I n connect: ic i with the language of Baker

v. Carr having to do with

textually committed

.a

branch by the language of the Constitution t and ti at t
argument of the government on one leg here, that this who!
subject was textually

committed and therefore it la act a

justiciable question.
MR. DOBROVIR;

That is the argument, that it is a

textual and demonstrable commitment of the matter to a
coordinate branch of the government.
Q

Your standing argument is dependent to a

certain extent, is it not, on the question Mr. Justice
Marshall asked you about, about the fact these people are
Congressmen?

I doubt that yon would claim standing to go

into the district court and say Mr. X, who is not a member
of Congress really should not be on the reserve rolls
because he has got bad eyesight,

your standing argument is

dependent on the fact that, these people are not only
disqualified from the reserve but that they are Congressmen.
MR. DOBROVIRj

Our standing argument is premised upon

the fact that this clause was intended to prevent this duality
of office in order to benefit the citizens of this nation as
a body politic, in order to prevent an influence upon the
Congress that the executive branch might exercise.
Q

Which a normal garden variety reserve requirement

that a guy have corrected 20/20 vision would not be anything

36
like.
MR. DOBROVIR:
Q

That is correct, Mr,. Justice Rehnquist.

Mr» Levitt had much the same thing in mind

when he came here, that he was going to try to enforce f .
all the people of the United States the very explicit prorle r re­
in the forepart of that clause that absolutely precluded the
appointment of a member of the Senate or the House to this
Court under those circumstances.
MR. DOBRXVIR:

Any litigant who comes to thin Court,

who comes into the federal courts, raising a constitutional
issue is going to seek

and,if he prevails, obtain the

enforcement of that constitutional provision generally for all
of the people of the United States.
What this Court has said, However, is that a
litigant must himself show some particularized injury.

And 7

think contrary to the characterization of the record made in
the government's papers, we have shown that kind of pur tier la::.;""'
ized injury.

We have shown as much injury as

person damaged

by the violation of this clause could show, we have alleged
in our complaint that our attempts to influence members of
Congress

in connection with particular kinds of issues have

bee.u. inhibited because these members of Congress, because of
their reserve connection, which' we allege is absolutely barred
by the Constitution, are biased, biased not rn any

corrupt

or fraudulent sense but biased by reason of this reserve

framers never to exist.
Those allegations were wade in our complaint r and
there was never any answer filed to the complaint.

And

therefore under Rule 8D of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, those ©negations must stand admitted.
Q

You did not gat your injunction from the

district court, 1 take it.
The district court did not issue a:a

MR. DOBROVIR:
injunction.
Q

The district court issued a declaratory judgment.
Did you appeal that?

MR. DOBROVIR;

Ho, Your Honor, we did not appea

becasue the Declaratory judgment Act expressly provides that
if the

defendants against whom a declaratory judgment has

issued do not comply with it, the district court retains
continuing jurisdiction, and vie could go back and ask for
further equitable relief.

So, you have never asked any other court to

MR. DOBROVIR;

court's refusal of an injunction?
We have not because we do not feel it

is yet an issue in this case,.

The district court stated in its

opinion that it was of the opinion that it had no doubt that

Q

If they do not, however—-take your hypot!

case—-if they simply say the court has no power, even if the
court

says it has, then you have the confrontation that was

discussed to some extent in Baker v. Carr and several other
earlier cases, do you not?
MR» DOBROVIR:
seriously;

I would be—let me say this very

It would almost be the end of our Constitution if

the ex4cutive branch failed to follow an order of the
district court,
Q

Let us pursuit and say the executive branch

follows it, that Congress passes an act unanimously reinstating
the commissions of these officers.

Is that not the type of

confrontation that the framers talked about and the courts have
talked about from time to time?
MR. DOBROVIR:

I would have thought that that kind

of confrontation was the very thing dealt with very specificin Marbury v« Madison and Kilbourn v. Thompson and is
established principle of our jurisprudence.

Rut if Congress

passes an act which turns out to be unconstitutional, the

39
courts declare it to be unconstitutional-Q

Bat. Baker v. Carr then want into some specific

details about that, did it not?
MR, DOBROVIR:

I im afraid I do not heme in ;nine-

the passages in Baker v. Carr you refer to, sir,
Q

No matter.

I do not want to interrupt your

argument any further.
MR. DOBROVIR;

1 am happy to try to armer the

questions, if perhaps you could help me,
Q

The confrontation problem is-theirs, is it not,

just as the confrontation problem was inherent in the Levitt
case?

In the

Levitt case the President of the United States

in the 1930’s had nominated and the Senate had confirmed as a
member of this Court a person in, according to the allegations,
direction violation of the explicit provisions of the
Constitution.

So that the Court then was confronted, among

other factors,- standing and other questions, was confronted
with making a decision which the other two branches had already
passed on, had they not?
MR. DOBROVIR;

I see Your Honor’s point.

I will

only say this, that—
Q

The Supreme Court said this is the kind of

question that courts will not get into.
MR, DOBROVIR:

There are some kinds of questions the
If the Congress were to enact the

40

:t

■3

■

c

from this

ffice,

you would have an act of Congress which presumably wa:.
unconstitutional.

In Kllbmrn v. Thompson, which has been

quoted often and recently by the Court, the Court said th.*rf
the declaration of a constitutional provision is the province
and the duty of this Court*

And while I suppose in those

early days too the Court may have had in mind the possibility
that there would be a direct confrontation, nevertheless the
Court had to do its duty and presumably the Congress would do
its duty.

And I do not suppose there is much difference

between an act of Congress that would declare in effect
reserve commissions that have been declared unlawful and any
other act of Congress insofar as it may be declared
unconstitutional by this Court and the executive prohibited
from enforcing it.
We are not asking for any relief against the
Congress , and an all of the cases in which acts' of Congress
are declared unconstitutional no relief is sought against the
Congress.

Relief runs to the executive branch which is

thereby prohibited from taking action or enforcing the
unconstitutional act of Congress.

And what we would have here

then would be an act of Congress, abusive legislation,
unconstitutional by the previous declaration of this Court,
which the executive would be prevented from enforcing because

41
the writs of this Court do n-e to the; executive ant the act
of Congress would sit fchei
thoce other acts of Congress which have bean declared
unconstitutional»

I think that- would be tha resolution under

our governmental system of this conflict.
I would like to close with some discussion of
standing.

Tha principles of Flash vr Cohen are not, I do not

think, a procrustean bed.

St does-not say if-.you have 18

different items and if you have 16 of them, you have
standing? but if you only have 15

of them, you do not.

Flast v. ..Cohen is a very subtle exposition of constitutional
principles under Article III, what makes a case a controversy
and., secondly, what then» assuming there is a case or
controversy, should make this Court stay its hand as a matter
of self-restraint.
And 1 do not think we can talk in terms of that was
only a. taxpayer's ease.

The Court was expounding on what

kind of specific relationship between the litigant and two
things, the matter he was challenging, the specific action or
the government that he. was challenging, on the one hand, and
a constitutional provision that he was invoking on the other.
If those two relationships ware sufficiently specific, then
that established the clear controversy which give this Court
jurisdiction under Article III.

And X think without trying to

push the facts of this case into a specific channel, I think

42

MR. DOBROVIR:

No, Your Honor.

1 do not think it is imagining, Your

I would say this., that we would rely on the allegations

in our complaint.

We think that they are—-

of them.
MR. DOBROVIR:

the merits?

Yes, Your Honor.

Would it ba relevant if you went to trial on
This is highly hypothetical now.

if the 117

members of Congress showed that in 99 percent of the time they
voted just the way your committee has been advocating that
they vote, would that be a relevant inquiry?
MR. DOBROVIR:

If we went to trial on the merits

and that turned out to be the proof, then we would lose.
Those allegations of our complaint*—we

would lose on that

point, and J. suppose

we would than--no* we would not have

standing if there were a trial on the merits on this assue.
The point is that the government did not choose to challenge
these allegations and there

was no ferial on the merits.

So,

they stand uncontroverted in the record.
But I suppose 1 should conclude by just, replying
very briefly to the question raised by my brother, that this
office is so minor and so tenuous an office that it is not
intended to be prohibited by the clause.
I think in response to this I will—
Q

This is also very relevant from the standing

point, is it not?
MR. DORROVIR:

That is right, Your Honor.

I quote again from the 1899 report in which it was
said, "It may be said that there are many offices under the
United States of little importance and carry little or no pay
and that it cannot be possible that the framers of the
Constitution contemplated 'forbidding a member of the national
legislature to hold one of these small offices.

This is not

No line could be drawn between the large and

the small office.

The principle declared was that a member of

the Congress of the United States shall not hold any office
under the United States and retain his seat as a national

HR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Dobrovir, do you have

something further now?
MR. DOBROVIR;

Tee, Your Honor.

First, with respect to the

question of jus­

ticiability, I would like to hold out very simply that the
question of a conflict, which I yhink is the prevailing
principle behind justiciability, what is intended to be
prevented, will not exist in this case, that here as in
Powell v, McCormack--and I am referring to the opinion at 395
U.s. at page 548—-tha determination of our claim here would
require no more than an interpretation of the Constitution,
and this falls within the traditional role accorded the courts
to intepret the law.
To refer also ho Roudebush v. Hartke, in which this
Court held that it did not violate the justiciability
principle to permit a court to order a recount in a senatorial
election because to do so would in no way impinge upon or
interfere with the function of the Senate in later determining
the qualification of its own members, that the Senate is free
to accept or reject the apparent winner.
Q

That wss a personnel function in the Roudebush

case, was it not?
ME. DOBROVIR:
Q

Yes, it was.

Not a federal matter.

MR

DOBROV:

Cot

in footnote 23» mention;

:

he

it this

committed to. the Senate and discussed it in
Q

sssly,

:ase ver

those terms»

That function was just like counting the

ballots in the first instance.
MR. D0BR0V1R:

I would only submit that

nothing

this Court does will interfere with the power of the Senate
or the House itself to determine the qualifications of any
of its members, and there are political considerations both
ways involved in what the Congress may do, which is not what,
this Cour t does or any court does» and that this Court * b
determination will in no way either inhibit or impose any
requirement on the Congress with respect to the qualification
of a member„
Perhaps there is. indeed wisdo

in the court

deciding questions like this, because as this Court said in
Brewster, this is not the kind of thing that—Congress perhaps
should not lay aside its normal activities and take on the
responsibility in the Court’s words "to police and prosecute
the myriad activities of its members«.”

So, it may me that

this is the kind of decision which in the separation of .powers
under our Constitution the

courts should undertake<,

With respect to standing, which is an important issue
in this case, I think it is important that the injury here be
viewed in light of the intent of the framers, and the intent

of the framers, 1 think it is clear, was to avoid even the
potential of any conflict, o
any

executive influence.

-

"

at :

And I would refer the Court to the

Dixon Yates case, the United States v. Mississippi Valley
Generating Company} and in particular at 364 U.S. at page
349, in which discussing another conflict of interest
provision, that in a statute, the Court said that the statute
is directed not only at dishonor but also at conduct that
tempts dishonor, and thus as in Board off Governors v. Agnew,
which was cited by the district court, at a potential»

And,

as the Court continued on page 351 of the opinion in
Mississippi Valley, that it was intended by the Congress in
that statute to establish a rigid rule of conduct, and X thin
that the incompatibility clause is no less rigid.
With respect further to this matter of injury, 1
would like to refer the Court to the recent decision in
United States v. SCRAP and to point out that there where
users of the environment, users of the parks, were able to
§ow the possibility of injury by way of the littering of the
areas that they use for recreational purposes.

That is much

like what we have here, where we have shown very clearly the
potential for harm, the possibility of littering there, the
potential for damage to our ability to influence members of
Congress here.
And there is a further analogy, I think, in that

there the Court found th;t those i:rd:Lvidr-.roiaintif ::b' ■■■ re­
users of the specific recreational areas in question»

bara

we too have shown that we in that sense are users of the
Congress, we attempt to influence the Congress, we lobby the
Congress.
Finally I think in view of the emphasis the Court
has put on Ex Parte Levitt, it might be well—
Q

Then your standing, according to you, depends

partly on the fact that you are a lobbying organization,
trying to influence legislation or whatever you want to call
it?
MR, DOBROVIR:

That is right.

That is right.

The Ex Parte Levitt is a very peculiar kind of
decision in that, as the Court has pointed out, it was
reached on the basis of a motion filed in this Court for
permission to file a. petition that Justice Black not be
permitted to take his seat.

And I went back and read the

cases that were cited by the Court.
The first esse was Tyler v. Judges, 17<$ U.S. 405,
whore the Court there, citing Chitty on pleadings, discussed
the fact that a party, to have standing, must be one whose
legal right has been affected.
And then Southern Railroad v. King-—that one I
did not undersrand, because that seemed only to involve the
sufficiency of an answer to raise the issue of the

repugnance oi s statute to the cct.iSnerce clause.
X.n Newman

Freyall, that was a suit in quo

warranto to challenge the appointment of a D. C. ccoamiseioner,
and the Court held that the writ quo warranto was not
available to someone who himself did not claim a right to
hold the office.
Fairchild v. Hughes was a suit to declare the
h

ale suffrage amendment to the Constitutio

and Justice Brandeis said that this was not a case or
controversy because, among other things? in Mr. Fairchild's
own state? New York, women had been granted the right to
vote, so that the amendment did not do him any greater
injury than he had already suffered by the act of his own
legislature.

And I think it is implicit in that case that

if it had been otherwise, he might well have had standing.
And finally of- course the Court cited Massachusetts
v, Mellon, and I will not go into that any further.

X think

that what Frothinghain v. Mellon means today was very
carefully explained by this Court in Flast v. Cohan.
Why Levitt is important is 'that it has been cited
by this Court in two or three recent cases > in -.particular in
Laird _vn_ Tatum.

And there 1 think it !s important to note

the context in which it was cited, cited in the context of a
situation where the individual plaintiffs in that particular
case themselves had admitted that they had not been injured.

that they had suffered no inhibition of their own emrcise
of their First Amendment rights e.n the basis of the
surveillance that had visited upon them.
And so I would submit that Esc Parte Levitt does
not, this very brief and per curias» opinion on a motion by
Mr. Levitt as a member of the bar, should not be adopted by
this Court as a limiting principle and as taking away what
this Court has granted in effect in FIa.sfe v» Cohen.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Solicitor General?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ROBERT II. BORK, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BORK:
Q

i think not, Mr! Chief Justice.

Is this the case years age in which the distri

cov.rt said, at least in the District of Columbia Circuit,
that standing was no longer anything to be taken very
seriously or words to that effect?
MR. BORK;

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

The district court said that the concept of standing, I
believe, had been almost abandoned in this circuit.
Q

Something like that.

I was trying to find it.

I did not remember whether it was this case or another case.
MR. BORK:
Q

Fine.

This is the case»
Thank you.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.
