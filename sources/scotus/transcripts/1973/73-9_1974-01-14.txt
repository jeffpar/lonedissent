MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Company.
Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This income tax case comes here on a writ of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals to the Tenth
Circuit.

It involves the question whether amortisable bond

discount, which is deductible as interest under Section 183
of the Internal Revenue Code, arose out of a transaction
accomplished by the respondent corporation in 1957.
Specifically, the transaction involved was an
elimination of respondent’s outstanding fifty dollar par,
five percent cumulative preferred stock, and a substitution
for this eliminated preferred stock of an issue of fifty
dollar face amount, five percent bonds to be issued to the
holders of the eliminated preferred on a dollar per dollar
basis.
The detailed facts underlying this transaction are
briefly as follows.

4
In 1957 respondent had t

riding-,

first an issue of $2. par common stock, secondly an issue of
47,059 shares of fifty dollar par, five percent cumulative
preferred, on which there were in 1957 dividend arrearages
amounting to $10 per share.
According to the certificate of incorporation, the
preferred stock was redeemable according to a fixed downward
sliding scale, so that in 1957 the redemption pries was $51
per share, plus the ten dollar dividend arrearages.
The preferred shares redeemed could not be reissued
but, pursuant to provisions of the articles of incorporation.,
had to be cancelled upon, receipt or ultimately returned to the
s'

redeeming shareholders a

On April 8, 1957, respondent’s directors proposed
a three-part plan which they characterized as a reorganisation
of the company by way of a recapitalization.

The three steps

to the plan were as follows.
First, the directors proposed a series of three
amendments to the certificate of incorporation.

Under the

first amendment, the preferred issue would be eliminated.
Secondly, the par value of the common would be increased from
$1 to S3 and the authorisation of the number of common shares
would foe increased from some 763,000 to one million shares.
Finally, the corporation was to be authorized to issue
warrants for the purchase of common stock.

2
The second part off the plan involved the issvrn.ca off
18-year bonds bearing a stated interest rate at-

ptrce:ot

and a fifty dollar face amount to the holders of the
eliminated preferred.

These bonds ware fee- be subordinate to

bank loans for inventory end to supplier obligations.

The

bonds were to be redeemable at par, plus accrued interest.
And like the preferred stock for which they were to serve as
a substitute, they ware subject to a sinking fund redemption
‘ *■ -■?•

provision.
Finally, the third step of the plan was to issue
to the preferred shareholders a warrant enabling them to
\

purchase common stock.

The terms of the warrant enabled the

holders ©f the eliminated preferred to purchase one half of a
»

share of common stock at $10 a share.

This warrant was to be

V

in lieu pf the dividend arrearages of $10 which

existed in

1957.
The shareholders approved the plan, and the focun of
this case is on the second step of the plan, that is, the
issuance of bonds in substitution for the eliminated preferred
stock.
A total of some $2 million of face amount bonds
were issued., which was exactly iqual to the par amount of the
eliminated preferred.

Thus, the capital of the: corporation

was reduced by some $2 million in the preferred- stock account,and the bonds payable account was correspondingly increased -by

s
the same amount.
At the time of this transaction in 1957 there had
been sporadic transactions involving but a few hundred shares
on an over-the-co-nfcer market of respondent's preferred
stock.

The price range of these transactions wore bid

ranging from $29 to §33 a e-hare and an offering price of
$32 to $35 a. share-.
Respondent claimed discount deductions for the
seventeen dollar difference between the face amount of each
bond issued, that is, §50, and the asserted fair market value
of the preferred stock which was eliminated, that is, $33.
This case involves the propriety of that deduction.
Q

There is no argument about the $33?

MR, SMITH:
Q

No, there la no argument-—

About the accuracy of that "figure,

MR. SMITH:

The accuracy of that figure is qnly

questionable from the point of view of the sporadic nature of
the transactions, since it only involved but a few hundred
shares of the 47,000 shares outstai Ling.
of this case, fchere is nc

• •

But for purposes?

at the fair

• \ :.ue

could have been $33.
The tax court upheld the commissioner's disallowance
of the deduction in a unanimously reviewed, decision, but the
Tenth Circuit, reversed with one sudge dissenting.
In a series of decisions of this

Court, this

7
amortizable bond, discount has bean correctly recognized a •
essentially in the nature of interest, and this Court has
also defined in numerous decisions interest as the compensation
for the use or forbearance of money, which has long been
deductible under the Income Tax Acts and which is currently
deductible under Section 163 of the Code»
The best way to understand how bond discount works
we believe is by reference to the prototype transaction set
forth in our brief at page ten.

In this prototype transaction

a corporation issues a bond with a face amount of $1000,
bearing stated interest at a rate of five percent over a tenyear term.

The bona is issued for $930,
The

stated interest of five percent produces an

interest obligation of five percent of $1000 or $50 a year.
But because the issuer of the bond must pay back the holder an
additional $50 after the bond'is retired, that additional $50
is also a cost of borrowing money and, as such, is deductible
as interest.
Because it is payable over the term of the bond,
this Court and the appropriate Treasury regulations have
permitted a rateable deduction over the term of the bond or
amortization, if you will.

Thus, the allowable deduction to

the issuer on the prototype bond would be $55 a year and not
$50 a year.
The critical question in this case is

whether this

transaction is analogous to the prototype transaction.

ae-re-

we have a situation where the corporation issued a fifty
dollar debenture in substitution for a share of eliminated
fifty dollar par preferred stock.
There is no question that respondent, upon the
original issuance of the preferred stock, received $50 in the
corporate till, so to speak*

It has now transformed that

preferred stock investment into a liability which will be
payable at the end of 18 years.

It originally received this

$50 and it now promises to pay $50 out over the end of the
term.
This equivalence has been reflected in the journal
entries of respondent where they have reduced 'chair capital
account by the fifty dollar par amount for each bond r for
each preferred stock, share, which has been eliminated and
have increased bonds payable account by a like amount.
This simple siubstifcufcion of one security for another
does not involve &n obligation to pay in the future any more
than use $50 originally received for the preferred stock.
And we believe that as a matter of numerical equivalence there
(•

gam be no discount in such a transaction.
Respondent and the Tenth Circuit have focused on
these sporadic sales of the preferred shares at $33 a share.
It held that there was $17 of discount on the issuance of each
debenture.

But recalling that discount simply involves an

9
obligation to pay in excess of an amount borrowed, just as
the corporation in the prototype transaction has promised, to
pay $1000 f although it has only borrowed $950, wa submit, that
there is no such excess in this case.

For discount to exist

in this case* the amount borrowed must be somehow analogous
to the $33 in the same way that the $950 in cash is analogous
to the amount borrowed in the prototype transaction.
But unlike the prototype transaction, the
corporation has fully available $950 of cash for its use in
the business.

Here all respondent has is a. certificate of its

preferred stock, which is immediately canceled by the terms
of the articles of incorporation.
Thus the so-called thirty-three dollar fair market
value of the preferred stock is meaningleas to the respondent
an in no sene can it be said to have received $33 in a
borrowing transaction.
Respondent disputes this analysis.

it argues that

it only entered into this transaction because it did not
have $33 in cash to redeam its preferred shares.

As a result,

it had to issue bonds in the face amount of $50,and the
argument goes that the $1? ©f excess is interest or
deductible discount.

It analogizes its preferred shareholders

to a so-called financing medium as it uses the term in its
brief.
Q

What was the life of the bonds?

10

MR. SMITH:

The life of the bond here was 18 years.

But respondent's argument assumes that it could have
redeemed the $33 for cash.

But recalling that the preferred

shareholders were entitled to a redemption price of $5.1 a
share in 1957

,

plus the $10 of dividend arrearages, this is a

sixty-one dollar obligation per share to each preferred
shareholder and not a thirty-three dollar obligation.

There

is no basis for inferring that the excess over the asserted
fair market value of the preferred stock is a cost for the
use of borrowing money.
Indeed, the inference that discount exists in this
case becomes even weaker when w® recall that the bonds
themselves were a stated interest rate of five percent.
Indeed, if respondent had redeemed the shares for- cash at any
price, the cases are clear that it would be entitled to no
income tax deduction at all.

It therefore becomes apparent
t

that it is simply absurd to infer a seventeen dollar
deduction for deductible interest when the redemption price
was possibly as much as $61.
Q

What if the respondent had sold the bonds to

third parties, gotten cash from them, and used the cash to
redeem the preferred stock?
MR. SMXTHs

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that kind of

analogy was one of the bases of the reasoning of the court
below.

And we feel that it is simply a variation, as X will

II
point out, of respondent's fir acing medium argument...

t';.'-.

the Tenth Circuit did waj to rnalogiss the transaction s:n&
to break it down into two elements—one, the issuance of a fifty
dollar face amount bond for $33 in cash and then the use of the
$33 in cash to redeem the preferred shares *

The court claimed

that looking at the transaction that way, that there would
have been discount as a result of the first aspect of the
transaction«
But this analogy we feel is erroneous from several
differant perspectives.

First of all, it is the transaction

at issue here, the unified transaction, which must be
scrutinised and not a breakdown into what we regard as
hypothetical non-existent components.
But there are also two factual misapprehensions
about the analogy,

To begin with, it is entirely unsupported

in the record to make .an-assumption that respondent could have
issued a—if It had issued a fifty dollar bond in 1957, it
would have only received $33 in cash, especially unsupported
in view of the fact that the bond itself carried a stated
a stated interest rate.
But, as 2 have also pointed out, there is no basis
for assuming that respondent could have redeemed its preferred
shares for $33 in cash, because the redemption price in
1957 was $61.

And if this sixty-one dollar obligation was

settled for $50, which got put on the face amount of the

12

bond, there is ho reason to infer that any part of ';h&t $50
is the cost of borrowing.
Q

Sven if respondent ha#—

How do you know there is no obligatior on the

part of the corporation to redeem?
MR. SMITHs
Q

There was no obligation.

They could have redeemed at sixty-one. uni -r-r

the sliding scale at that particular time.
MR. SMITHS

Q

Yes.

There is no obligation, unlike the maturity of

a bond? there is no obligation at all.

what happened here

was that each shareholder turned in a piece of property worth
$33 in return for a fifty dollar bond? is that not right?
MR. SMITH;
Q

In the marketplace.

MR. SMITH;
Q

Worth $33—

Right, but not worth $33—

It was not worth $61 because ha had no right to

compel redemption.
MR. SMITH;

exchange of a piece of property worth $33, i.e.,

the preferred stock of the company, in return for a fifty
dollar bond bearing a five percent rate of interest, an 18year bond, is that not it?

13
MR. SMITH:
Q

That is correct,, but—

You do not need to cut this thing into—

dichotomize it.
MR. SMITH:

No, exactly.

And we feel that the

Tenth Circuit having done so, that it was error to have done
so.
Q

You think that is an error.

there was error.

Let us assume

Just look at it as a unitary transaction,

an exchange of property worth $33 for a bond with a fifty
dollar face value and a five percent interest

rate, with an

18-year maturity.
MR. SMITH:

If we look at it that way, first of
'* f

all, the corporation did not receive property worth to it $33
in the same way that the corporation, the prototype transaction,
received an amount less than an amount which it had obligated
itself to pay in the future.

There was no obligation to pay

an excess over an amount borrowed.

Here the numerical

equivalents are such that the corporation originally took in
$50 for its preferred shares.
a fifty dollar liability.

It has transformed that into

And we believe that the reference

to the thirty-three dollar asserted fair market value of the
preferred shares

becomes irrelevant, because this is simply a

substitution of one security for another.
Q

Is this the bookkeeping transaction?

MR. SMITH:

A bookkeeping transaction in the sense

14
that it is a reshuffling of one security for another,
technically called a recapitalization.
Q

‘They are very different kinds of securities,

however, are they not?
MR. SMITH;

One is debt and one is ownership.
They are different kinds of securities,

but we do not think that makes any difference in this case.
In fact, the similarities, Mr. Chief Justice, far outweigh
the differences; because just as the bonds were subordinate to
supplier obligations and bank loans, the preferred shareho Iders could only get their $50 upon a voluntary liquidation
of the corporation, so to speak.
in somewhat the same position.

So that both really stood
We think that the similarities

far outweigh the differences.
Q

But the relationship to the parties very

drastically changed, did it not, from ownership to a debtorcreditor relationship?
MR. SMITH;

That is from a technical corporate point

of view, that is correct.

But we do not think that should

make any difference in this case where we have simply $50
going into the corporation through the par value of the
preferred stock.

There is no dispute that the corporation

received $50, and then it simply promises to pay $50 in the
future.

Discount involves the existence of an obligation to

pay something in excess of an amount borrowed, and there was
no obligation here to pay anything in excess of the $50 the

15
corporation had originally received on the issuance of its
preferred stock.
Finally,, the Tenth Circuit's analogy becomes’"~f lie a
squarely in the face, we beliefs, of this Court’s decision i
Great Western Power Company v. Commissloner, which specifically
held that such a substitution of one security for another is
a unified transaction and not a transaction involving a
breakdown of the issuance of the second one for cash and then
the use of that cash to eliminate the first security.
It seems to us that the Tenth Circuit misconceived
the basic essentials of this transaction.

So, what we have

here is simply the substitution of one security for another,
and we submit that a corporation's issuance of debentures for
stock is simply a capital readjustment that does not give
rise, with those facts alone, to an inference
existence of discount.

for the

Thus the thirty-three dollar asserted

market value of the preferred shares becomes completely
irrelevant.

And the correctness of this proposition, we

believe, is amply demonstrated by two things in this case,
where you have a dollor-fordollar exchange and where as a
matter of corporate mechanics the corporation received
nothing upon the exchange because the stock was immediately
canceled.
The tax court decided this case on the basis of a
dollar-for-dollar exchange.

And, in so holding, it followed

16

the reasoning of a aeries of a recent court of claims
decisions which had

alto premised the non-existence of

discount in transactions like these on a dollar-for-dollar
equivalence between the par value of the eliminated preferred
stock and the face amount of the bond.
We think while this rationale is certainly sufficient,
to reverse the judgment belowr there are other ramifications
of this problem which we believe this Court should consider
in formulating a basis for its decision.

As I have saidr as

a general proposition, we do not believe that a capital
readjustment of this type gives rise to amortisable bond
discount.
Consider the situation of the corporation having
issied a fifty-five, dollar face amount bond, for the fifty
r

dollar preferred stock.

In such & situation we still think

tha . there is no basis - for inferring bond discount.
The court of claims has suggested and two district
courts have more explicitly held that discount might arise in
such a transaction.

A district court decision -has proposed a

formula for the measurement of discount an the following
transaction

which v$uld be as follows.

It •would measure

the difference between the faca amount of the bond in the
example, $55, and the greater of the following two quantities,
first the par value of the stock--here $50—or the value of
the preferred stock to the corporation at the time of the

1?
exchange„
Under the district's formula, the v&lvfz to the
corporation of the preferred e took may ? . grsa

th -v vi .

par value of the preferred stock hut could in no instance be
less than the par value.
Thus, for purposes of the example under the
district court’s approach,, there could be as much as $5 of
discount in this transactionr in the fifty-five/fifty
transaction, but might be less»
Q
measured?

How would the value of the corporation be

Would it be the sixty-one dollar figure?
MR. SMITH:

It is not entirely clear, Mr* Justice

Stewart, exactly what the district court had in mind, and that
is one of our complaints about this test.

We think that the

concept of value to the corporation introduces a vague and
meaningless term.
Q

-

If they would have cost the corporation $61 in

cash to redeem any one of these preferred shares as of the
time of the conversion, would it not?
MR. SMITH;

Yes.
't

Q

So, I would suppose that would be the "value"

to the corporation.

That is what it

would have cost the

corporation to get it.
MR. SMITH:
Q

Yes.

Oh, On a redemption.

18
MR. SMITH:

The problem with

is that—
Q

Although the corporation could go out to

:o.o

open market and buy it for $33.,
MR. SMITH:

Yes, but

if

estate market mechanics, I wo—Id assume that if the
'here attempted to buy up as many shares as it could on tho
k< t, its intention, to retire the whole is
have become apparent, and the market price would have boon
pushed up toward the redemption price.
Q

But you do not understand, in other words,

what the court meant by the alternative.

It is either the

par value - assuming that par value had been the; true amount
paid in- capital, or you would say alternative3.y the value to
the corporation, and your reprepresentation is that you

m

vo-c

understand what it means.
MR. SMITH:

I do not think the courts, quite

understand what the value to the corporation
the court of claims has suggested that, fair market value of
preferred stock is a relevant consideration for determining
the value to the corporation, but it is not a determinant of
consideration.
Thus it seems that the courts know that this
approach wants to get away from fair market value, which of
course we also contend is erroneous.

But it is not clear to

the courts exactly
is.

what this; term value to the corporation,

Whatever it is, we submit that there still is no basis

for an inference that discount arises in such a transaction,
To begin with, if the term value to th a corporation
means what the corporation, 'would be willing to pay for the.
preferred stock, then even under the district court's formula
there would be no discount because there would be & ff.-,?:
amount of $55 for the bond, and the corporation would be
willing to pay $55 for the stock»

Thus there would b& no

element of that fifty-five dollar figure would constituta a
cost of borrowing.
Indeed, there are many instances which,

we might cal

to mind to suggest why a corporation would be willing to
purchase its preferred stock for more than its par value-.

It

could be a call premium or whatever, which might force the
corporation to be required to pay from its shareholder more
than the par value of the stock.
So, if that value to the corporation means the
price at which the corporation pays for the stock, there would
be no discount.
But even conversely, if the face amount of the bond
represents somewhat more than tha corporation would be
willing to pay for the stock, there is still no reason to
infer the existence of discount.

There are a variety of other

corporate reasons completely unrelated to the cost of

bor:

ai ng money which could fos

why a corporation would enter into a transaction like this.
For example, in this very case respondent wanted to
eliminate the dividend arrearages.

It could have decided that

it wanted to transform non-deductible dividends on preferred
stock into deductible interest.

It could have decided it

wanted to eliminate preferred shares which were held by a
dissident group.
In any event r we submit that there are a variety
of other independent reasons which would form the "basic for:
decision why a corporation would be willing to pay more for
its preferred stock than the so-called market value or its
value to the corporation which are. totally unrelated to the
cost of borrowing money.
Q

What voting

the preferred shares have?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES WHITE HESS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HESS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My name is Charles Hess.

I am an attorney from

Kansas City, Missouri, and with the firm of Linde Thom-?on
Van Dyke' Fairchild & Langworthy.

We have represented the

respondent National Alfalfa Dehydrating and Milling Company
for many years and have represented them throughout this
litigation.
Mr. Smith's presentation of the facts has been
relatively accurate.

However, we cannot agree with the facts

which ha emphasises nor with his characterization of the
redemption or exchange transaction which occurred in this
case as a suhfcitution of securities.
In its simplest form. National Alfalfa issued a
fifty dollar face amountt five percent debt obligation,
repayable in 18 years, to its preferred shareholders in
exchange for or redemption of each share of their preferred

stock;, which had a fair market value of $33 at the data c.V the

The economic realities surrounding the exclar-.■,
which are substantiated • in the record, dictated that tru issue,
price of each debenture was $33 or the fair market value*. of
the preferred stock, and that fchx difference of $.1.7 b&tzuan
the face amount of the debenture mid its issue price of $33
represented discount•
The economic facts surrounding the transaction
which dictated that $33 was the true and meaningful value to
be attributed to the issue price of the debentures., are
numerous.

The preferred stock for which each debenture was

issued had a fair market value in the over-the-counter market
of $33 per share, seventeen—
Q

2s that stipulated?

MR. HESS:

Yes, it was a stipulated fact in the too

court«
Q

Did they stipulate to the extent that it would,

have been possible to

purchase it on a market at that figure

or just that it had a value?
MR. HESS:

There are two or three exhibits.

stipulation refers to the exhibits.

The

One is the national-

stock summary which summarizes the activity in over-the-counter
stocks, and it is used by the Internal Revenue Service for

23

told and asks and exchanges: made during two or htroe ;.r-:v:'. a
around July of 1957.
The other esehibit is a letter from Francis I» Dupont
which was the chief market maker in the stock at that tire,
quoting the bid and ask prices•ten days either side of the date
of the exchange.

And the stipulation refers to this and

states that the value was §33.
Xn addition to the preferred being worth $33 in the
market, there were four years of dividend arrearages on the
preferred.

National’s credit rating was so poor at that tim&«.

that it could not borrow sufficient funds from banks to finance
inventory requirements for its operations.
National’s balance sheet and operating statement,
which are reflected in the tax returns which are exhibite in
our record, reflected that its overall financial picture was
very poor.

It did not have sufficient cash or liquid asset?!

to redeem the preferred for $33 in cash.
The fact that the preferred shareholders were to be
removed by this redemption as equity owners in National
through the. redemption r-erat that the negotiations preceding
the exchange and the exchange itself were arm's length dealings
taking into account the relative positions of each of the
preferred shareholders at the time of the exchange.
The ruling letter issued by the Treasury prior to

the exchange properly deec.ribiere exchange re r

d eer tie 1

and. requiring the recognition by the preferred eharaholderc of
gain or loss on the exchange, clearly acknowledged the aria’s
length dealing inherent in such an exchange, which took into
account the economic status of the parties at that time.
Judge Phillips for the court of appeals recognised
the economic realities existing in the transaction which led
him to the proper conclusion that the debentures were issued
for $33 and that the seventeen dollar difference was interest
in the form of discount.

He recognized that the financial

statute and negotiating position of the parties in 1957

and

the then current value of the preferred stock determined the
face amount, the stated interest rat®, and the discount on
the debentures, all of which are variable factors, depending
upon the circumstances of any given exchange.
Q

Mr. Hess, I suppose if National

-Alfalfa had

actually done that, gone out into the market and dona what
was supposed, you would not be here, there would be no case.

MR. HESS:

That is true.

And of course in tax law we have a lot of

distinctions in cases, depending on what actually was done,
not on what might have been done.

But you feel that what

might have been done equates with what was done?
MR. HESS:

Very much so.

I think his analogy,

although it sets up slightly differing facts, really explains

Q

Your tax court decision was reviewed by the

full court, was it not?
MR. HESS:
Q

Yes.

It is a little surprising

you did not pick up

somebody in your favor among that array of tax judges.
MR. HESSs

In all the cases.that have been decided

on the varint issues here, the court of claims and the tax
court are the only ones that have gone in this direction.
The courts of appeals have gone the other way, various
circuit courts of appeal, and I think that they got off on a
wrong tangent and I ecnavt explain that, their decision.

2

think it is wrong.
They purposely refused to follow the decision of the
court of appeals of the

Tenth Circuit in the Atchison,

Topeka and Santa Fe case, which was a decision that was
made in 1970, which allowed bond discount in a railroad
.

reorganisation situation.
q

of course the tax court has been wrong before,

!

but you hope they are wrong agait,,
MR. HESS s
Q

Right*

.1 sure do.

Mr. Hess, in the real world, of finance, aro

there many debentures with a face value of $50 that you would
market for $25?

I mean, is this something that happens with

any frequency?
MR. HESSj
to tell you that.

I am not sure that I have the background
I do know that from the calculations that

Judge Phillips made, the actual dollar effect of this was that
an additional 1.9 parcent interest Would be added to the
stated interest rate of five percent.

So that although the

discount in terms of $1? on $50 sounds high, if you
recognise it in the form of 6.9 percent total interest, that
is not all that high,,
Then a five dollar discount-say $45 out of

Q

$50 has just really a very insignificant effect on the stated
interest rate, if seventeen would have that small.
MR. HE IS:

Yes.

I cannot cal culate-it, quite that

fast, but X assume it would be much smaller than 1.9 percent.
It Blight be .5.
0

It might bring it up to 5.5.
You can get a very substantial discount

sometimes, depending upon the stated interest rate in the
debenture.

If if were two percent, say, an old debenture,

compared to today’s interest rates, it would be & tremendous
discount, plus the condition of the issuer.

A debenture by

2?
definition is a basically nnseci cad debt obligation as
contrasted to a bond, and that could amount to—you could get a
very substantial discount in that area of magnitude.
MR. HESS:

The discount will vary directly with the

stated interest rate as one factor and—
Q

And the strength of the issuing company , the

financial strength.
MR. HESS:

Yes.

And National at this time was rot.

strong.
Judge Phillips noted that the preferred shareholder.*;
were acting as a financing medium to the extent of the $33 of
actual value of the debentures received by them, an amount
which National did not have in cash to pay them.
Underlying these economic facts, the court of
appeals understood that the preferred shareholders upon
receiving the debentures became creditors and that National's
relationship to them after the exchange was entirely different
than before,
First of all, there was a requirement for
repayment of $50 after maturity in 18 years.

Secondly, there

was a fixed interest payments that had to be made.

The

default provisions of the indenture exposed National's assets
in the event that the interest or principal wore not paid.
Restrictions in the indenture prohibited numerous financing
and operational activities of National, and the establishment

2D
of and payments to c. sinking £n:.r2 farther protected the
debenture holders»

In fact, the sinking fund was used

entirely properly,

it was funded at every point that it was

supposed to be funded, and the debentures have been retired
in proper order.
In contrast to the economic analysis approach in
our case, which the court of appeals took, the Erie
Lackawanna case, which is a court of claims case, takes an
historical approach, and it was mentioned by Mr. Smith.
Erie Lackawanna, being a court of claims decision, is the
cornerstone of all of the cases supporting the commissioner's
position in this case and from which he has attempted to
develop some theory which would prevent the use of fair market
value of the preferred as the issue pries of the debentures.
The dissent in our case relied on the rationale of the Erie
case.
But the approach used in Erie has been termed
the arithmetical equivalence theory or the numerical
equivalence theory, which Mr. Smith used today.

Basically

that approach is since §50 was originally received upon
issuance of the preferred by National and ultimately many years
later National will pay $50 to a debenture holder, then the
corporation has not bean hurt.
The total inadequacy of this arithmetical
equivalence approach is threefold.

First, it ignores the

29
basic qualitative differences betw
instruments , namely, the fifty dollar face amcarat on the
debentures must be paid back.

The fifty dollar par on to

preferred is never required to be paid back.

The debenture;-:

appear as a long term liability on the balance sheet.

Too

interest of the preferred holders appears in a. stockholders
equity account, and these entries reflect the basic transferor
tion that occurs in an exchange.
The debenture holder is a creditor and not an owner
He has no residual interest in the corporation or its
profitability.

He has no voice in corporate policy.

And he

takes no risk.

None of these are true with the preferred.

The arithmetical equivalence theory also ignores
tiie economic realities surrounding an exchange, in rpite cf
the fact that the economic facts at the date of the exchange
determine the elements of ' consideration given by each of the
parties to the exchange.
The amicus, Norton Simon, set forth a hypothetical
which 1 think is very appropriate in showing tl
of this arithmetical equivalence theory.

If National's

preferred had been ten dollar per* but the fair market value at
the elate of the exchange were $50 and National went ahead and
issued a fifty dollar face amount debenture for the preferred,
under the Erie Lackawanna case and the arithmetical
equivalence theory, we would be entitled to a deduction for

a discount of $40» the difference between the fifty dollar
face amount of the bond and the ten dollar par value of the
preferred.
Obviously this is not right.

We would be giving up

a face amount debenture worth fifty and receiving 301ne.thij.xg
with. & fair market value of fifty, and I think this polvitc cot
the weakness of that arithmetical equivalence theory.
The arithmetical equivalence theory finds no support
.in Internal Revenue Code Sections dealing with bond discount.
In analysing the appropriateness of National's
deduction for interest.in the form of discount, you must
realise that the Internal. .Revenue Code contains counterparts
of the interest deduction for amortized bond discount.

These

provisions provide the symmetry to the tax elements of a
transaction normally found in the Internal Revenue Code.

The.

debenture holder reports the interest which is"iri the form of
discount as ordinary income.

If a corporation repurchases

its debentures in the market at less than face value, which
National did in this case, the difference between the face
value and the lesser price paid in the market is reported as
ordinary income by the corporation on its tax returns,
If for policy reasons the commissioner or others*,
such as the court in Erie, feel that a corporation should not
obtain a deduction for discount in a case such as this where
it is clearly authorized by the code sections dealing with

31
interest deductions and where it in clearly supported by the
economic facts in the situation, then we believe that the
place for them to look is to Congress.
However,, it may be too late at this point, because
Congress in the 1369 tax reform act resolved this problem for
the future, and we believe did so in a manner consistent with
the decision of the court of appeals in this case.

The

court of appeals decision in tills case was appropriate.
Respondent respectfully requests that the decision of the
court of appeals for the Tenth Circuit be affirmed.

Thank

you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Hess.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Smith?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF.OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

Just a few

points.

Mr. Justice Blackraun

asked about the fair market value of the preferred stock.

The

reference in the stipulation in the tax' court is at page 21
of the record, paragraph 13.

There is no stipulation

between the parties with respect to fair market value.

All

the stipulation says is attached hereto and marked as
Exhibit 17, is a letter from Francis I. Dupont & Company in
which the bid and ask range prices are quoted.

That la the

only thing in the record with respect to the fair market value
of the preferred stock.

32
Did the governme
contradicting that?
MR. SMITHs

No, vecause from our point of view, tha

fair market value of the preferred stock, whatever the
market value of the preferred
difference o

stock, it doss not make any

Since discount involves an obligation to pay

an

amount in excess of an amount borrowed, we do not think there
was anything in excess of §30.
With respect to the similarities and alleged
differences between the preferred stock and the debentures,
let me just refer tha Court to the discussion on pages 14 and
15 of our brief in which it is pointed out that both the
preferred stock and the debentures were both subject to
comparable sinking fund provisions which retire both of them.
I think that simply ac a matter of realism, both the
preferred shareholders here and the debenture holders were
both subject to the risk of tha business.

If the business

did not make any money, then the debenture holders would not
get paid nor would the preferred shareholders' investment
really be worth anything.
I think in closing

what I simply want to emphasise

is that what the taxpayer is arguing for here is an automatic
rule which would insist upon tha existence of discount between
the face amount of the debenture and this asserted fair
market value of the preferred stock.

We say on those facts

33
alone there is no basis for inferring discount*
for a lack of discount is graphically illustrated in this
case by the equivalence between the par value of the
preferred stock and the face amount'of the debenture.

The

corporation took in $50 and promised to pay out no more than
$50 over the end of the term.
But simply if the corporation had increased th« fac2
amount of the debenture* we do not think—to $55—we dc not
think that there is a basis for inferring the existence of
discount.

We think that the taxpayer should be put to the

burden of demonstrating that that excess really repres 'nits
a cost of borrowing and that since there are a variety of
reasons why a corporation would want to enter into a trans­
action like this—I sea ray time is up, 1 would just finish
my sentence—we think that those, reasons should control
unless there is strong evidence inferring an additional cost
of borrowing.
Q

Thank you»
Mr. Smith* may X ask you a questions

Do you

attach any significance to the 1963 amendment to the code
arguing the amicus briefs arid also in the reply brief?
MR. SMITH;

We have filed a reply brief,

Mr. Justice Powell, which discusses this point.

Briefly we

do not attach any real significance to the 1369 amendment.
But we do know that the approach of Congress in 1969 is
parallel to the approach we wo“Id take in this case, that as

a general rule, when a corporation issues bonds for property,
Congress has declared in 1969 that the issue price is equal
to the face amount of the bond with only two exceptions-, that
either the bonds be traded on a public exchange or that the
stock be traded on a public exchange»

Neither of those

facts exist in this case, and we think that the general

.air,

without the exceptions, lends support and is parallel to the
approach we take here»

JUSTICE BURGER?
