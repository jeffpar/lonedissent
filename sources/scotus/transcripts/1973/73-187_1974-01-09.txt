MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 73-187, Kewanee Oil Company against Bicrcn
Corporation.
Mr. Griswold.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N, GRISWOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER.
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to
review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit.
That court, by a divided vote, held that the Ohio
law of trade secrets was preempted by the federal patent
laws.
On this basis, it reversed a judgment which had
been entered by the District Court, following an extensive
trial, which had enjoined the respondents here from using
and disclosing trade secrets which they had learned while
they were in the employ of the petitioner.
The facts are relatively simple, as far as the
issue before this Court is concerned.

They may be said,

I think, to present a classic case of equity jurisdiction.
The petitioner, through an unincorporated division
called Harshaw, manufactures various products in the chemical

4
field*

And these include synthetic crystals.

The particular

product involved here is sodium iodide thallium activated
crystals.
That means that it is basically sodium iodide, but
by introducing some thallium in it the crystal becomes
effective in detecting radiation.

And these crystals are

useful in locating uranium ore and oil exploration, and for
various medical purposes such as detecting malignant
tumors.
QUESTION:

Mr. Griswold, I — excuse rne for

interrupting you — I think you said that the Court of Appeals
decided this case by a divided vote?
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

I missed that.

Is there a dissenting

opinion?
MR. GRISWOLD:
wrong.

Well, I'm sorry.

Apparently I am

My recollection was that it was a divided vote, but

QUESTION:

I think it was unanimous,

MR,GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

— it was unanimous.

Unanimous, unh-hunh.

Right.

I just

wanted to be sure I hadn't missed something.
MR. GRISWOLD;
QUESTION:

Well, —

Yes, that just means that you think they

were unanimously wrong

5
MR. GRISWOLD:

I now say they were unanimously

wrong, yes.
[Laughter. 3
MR. GRISWOLD:

Harshaw was a pioneer in this field,

and has been actively developing it for 25 years.
In 1949 it grew a sodium iodide thallium activated
crystal

less than two inches in diameter.

By 1966, after

the investment of much money and effort, it was able to grow
a crystal seventeen inches in diameter.
And I may say that these crystals are grown in
platinum crucibles, it comes out a very substantial mass?
it is then sliced, which is a very delicate operation, it
must be quiclcly encapsulated because it is heavily hydroscopic,
it will absorb moisture.

When it absorbs moisture, it melts.

This is full of delicate operations.

And the size of the

crystal is significant, among other things, because that
seventeen-inch crystal will more or less cover the chest of
a person who is being examined, whereas the smaller crystals,
you'd have to use many, and you might miss places.
Worldwide there are several companies that compete
with Harshaw in this business.

There are three in the United

States, other than the respondent? two in Japan? and one each
in Great Britain and in France.
Up to date, however, no company has grown or sold
a seventeen-inch-diameter crystal except Harshaw.

In producing such a crystal, Harshaw developed
many confidential processes, procedures and techniques, which
it claims as trade secrets.
There are six individual defendants.

Each of them

was employed by Harshaw or by a subsidiary of Harshaw.
QUESTION:

There’s no patent involved here, though?

MR. GRISWOLD:

There's no patent involved here,

no claim is made based on a patent.
Each entered into a contract with his employer that
he would not disclose the confidential information of Harshaw.
Each of these employees occupied a position of trust and
confidence with Harshaw, and was given access to the secret
operations in connection with his employment.
Thus, each of the individual respondents was bound
by contract and by fiduciary relationship resulting from his
confidential employment* not to disclose Harshaw's confidential
information.
It's one of the traditional functions of equity to
enforce such obligations.
While still employed by Harshaw, four of the
individual respondents discussed the possibility of forming
their own business.

In order to have a going business in the

shortest period of time, they decided to make scintillation
detectors using sodium iodide thallium activated crystals.
During the summer and fall of 1969 they associated

the other individual respondents to them,, who had recently
left Harshaw's employ.
They built a plant which was completed in late
1969, or early 1970, and soon had produced the seventeen-inch
sodium iodide thallium activated scintillation crystal.
The District Court found that there was imminent
danger of disclosure of plaintiff’s trade secrets to Bicron,
which was the company they organized, and the use of these
trade secrets by Bicron,
In April 1970 Kewanee filed this suit, to enjoin
the individual defendants in Bicron from using and disclosing
Kewanee's trade secrets.
There was an extensive trial.

The District Cou.rt

found that Kewanee had a protectible interest in twenty of
the forty trade secrets on which it relied.

It held that

the other twenty were common knowledge, and could be freely
used.
Accordingly, it entered an injunction enjoining
Bicron and the individual respondents from disclosing and
using the twenty trade secrets unless and until they became
validly publicly known.
Both sides appealed from this decision,

Kewanee

contended that all forty trade secrets should have been
protected, while Bicron cross-appealed, claiming that none
of the trade secrets should be protected.

8

And the Court of Appeals, after reviewing the record,
held that the findings of fact made by the District Court were
not clearly erroneous within the meaning of Rule 52 of the
Rules of Civil Procedure *
The Court further concluded that the District Court
properly applied the Ohio law relating to trade secrets, and
then it said, and I quote from the opinion as it is set out
on page 16 of our brief:
"On this record, as a whole, it appears clear to us,
as it did to the District Court, that the individual
defendants used the information obtained during their employ­
ment by Harshaw for the benefit of Bicron,

There can be no

question on this record but what these individual defendants
appropriated, to the benefit of Bicron, Harshaw’s secrets,
processes, procedures and manufacturing techniques."
And the Court of Appeals then concluded that it would
"affirm the judgment of the District Court" except for the
conclusion that it reached that the Ohio law of trade secrets
is in direct conflict v/ith the patent laws of the United
States.

That is, that the lav/ of trade secrets is pre­

empted by the patent lav/s.
And on this basis the Court of Appeals reversed the
order of the District Court, which had entered an injunction
against respondents? and that is the issue which has been
brought here

9

Now, there is nothing unusual about the Ohio lax»/
relating to trade secrets.

It's similar to the law xxrhieh

has been long in effect in most of the States, and which is
derived from English sources, going back over a century.
It is, indeed, simply an application of the traditional
equity principle for dealing with threatened breach of
contract or violations of fiduciary obligations.
Obviously, the value of the trade secret depends
upon its being kept secret.

This does not mean that it

cannot be disclosed in confidence or with suitable safeguards
as a means of utilizing the secret.
But unless the safeguards can be enforced, that is,
the safeguards arising out of contract or out of fiduciary
relationhip, the secret will soon no longer be a secret,
and accordingly will have no value.
A trade secret is not the equivalent of a patent.
A patent, when valid, gives a right reaching to the boundaries
of the United States, effective against every person in the
United States.

It is a true governmental grant of a

monopoly.
When a patent is granted, there is disclosure to
the public, but no one may utilize the device or process
without license for a period of seventeen years.
This is true even as to a person who has independently
conceived the same idea.

It's true as to everyone within

10

the outer limits of the United States.

It's a true monopoly.

But a trade secret is much more limited.

It finds

its substance,, as I've indicated, in ordinary principles of
equity.

It's enforced against persons only who have, one way

or another, undertaken an obligation not to disclose.
It may be enforced, too, against persons who obtain
the secret wrongfully, as by bribery or by burglary *

As to

all the world, though, other than those who are bound by
contract or by fiduciary duty, the trade secret may be
utilized by anyone who obtains it without wrongdoing.
Thus, it may be uncovered by inspection, by what
is called reverse engineering.

You take the thing that you

have and the trained engineer works back to see how it was
put together.

Or by trial and error.

It may also be developed by anyone who carries or
the same steps of research and development which were
utilized by the original developer of the trade secret.
In this particular case, the record shows that there
are a number of competitors who are in no way bound by
contract or by fiduciary obligation, and all of them are free
to develop the same trade secrets, if they can*
How, tills would not be true with respect to a patent
which binds all others, no matter how independent or original
their activities may be.
How, the issue here is whether the State law of

trade secrets long in effect and prevalent throughout the
United States has in some way been preempted by the patent
laws „
It's true, of course, that Congress has been given
power to grant patents,

Historically the States granted

patents in the early days, but I don’t believe they do now.
It may well be true that Congress could, under the
necessary and proper clause, preempt the State law of trade
secrets.

Just as I suppose that Congress could preempt the

copyright field, so as to invalidate all State legislation
in that area.
In the last term, in Goldstein v, California, this
Court refused to find such an effect in the constitutional
provision, which is identical with respect to copyrights and
patents, and refused to find it as to a matter not covered by
the patent law as enacted by the

by the copyright law as

enacted by Congress,
And we submit that the same conclusion should be
reached here with respect to the impact of the patent laws
on the state lav/ of trade secrets,
QUESTION; General Griswold, there were some of us
who dissented in Goldstein last term.

Do you think our

position is inconsistent with yours here?
HR. GRISWOLD;
I think that there is a

No, I do not think so, Mr. Justice.
well, let me put it this way;

12

If your position was that because of the
constitutional clause no State or

no State can enact either

a patent or a copyright law,, then I think it would follow that
a State could not enact a patent law, just as it was your
position that they could not enact a copyright law.
QUESTION:

Your position, you keep saying that we've

never decided Goldstein -- or we've decided it the other way,
I take it?
MR» GRISWOLD:
the same*

Yes, our position would be exactly

Our position is that we're dealing with the trade

secret which we're seeking to enforce through ordinary
equitable principles, which is in no way inconsistent with
a patent and is not a functional equivalent of a patent?
although, of course, it is in — has a related -- it is in
a related field, dealing with what might be broadly called
industrial property.
There's nothing in the patent lav; which expressly
requires preemption.
As a matter of fact, State trade secret law has
co-existed with the patent law in this country for more than
a century without interfering with anything that Congress has
written in the patent lav;.
Trade secrets have been clearly established in Ohio,
at least since the decision of then Superior Court Judge Taft,
in the case of Cincinnati Bell Foundry v, Dodds, decided in

13
1837.
This Court has many times recognised the existence
and validity of trade secrets in its decisions.

We have

cited several of these cases in our brief, and many more are
cited in the numerous amicus briefs which have been filed
here.
In the Dubilier Condenser, this Court said that
the inventor, and I quote, "may keep his invention secret"
and that didn't mean just keep it to himself, because it
went on to say "and reap its fruits indefinitely".
These decisions were outstanding and unqualified
when the patent law was completely overhauled by Congress in
1952.

There's nothing in the statute which indicates any

disapproval by Congress of the continuing validity of the lax<r
of trade secrets.
Moreover, this Court recognized the validity of
trade secrets in the Rules of Civil Procedure, which were
adopted in 1938.

And Congress has, both before and since

1952, enacted many statutes which recognize the continuing
validity of the State lav/ of trade secrets.
How, these statutes, both before and after 1952,
are cited in Appendices B and C of our brief.
The issue which we see here, I think can be put in
this ways

Congress could, no doubt, by its action, pre~

empt the State law of trade secrets.

14

Now, Congress has taken no such action*

The

pressure in that direction comes from several decisions of
this Court, all dealing with other factual situations, and
not involving trade secrets
In this connection I would like to call the
attention of the Court to an article which is cited in our
brief, by Professor Wydick of the University of California
at Davis.

When we cited it we had it only in manuscript,

but I am now advised that it has been published in the
December 1973 issue of the Journal of the Patent Office
Society, 55 Journal of the Patent Office Society, 736.
That issue publishes only the first half of the article;
the second half will be in the January issue.
And I will lodge a copy of the entire article
with the Clerk, so that it will be available for the Court.
Now, it's said that the trade secrets in this case
are invalid because the petitioner has lost his right to get
a patent on them.
The argument is based on section 102(b) of the
patent law, which is set out on page 3 of our brief, just
above the middle, which reads that:
entitled to a patent unless ...
in public use

"A person shall be

(b) the invention was ...

, in this country, more than one year prior

to the date of the application for patent in the United
States."

15
What this says is that where the idea has been in
public use for a year, no patent may be obtained.
course we don't contest that.

And of

It may well be that Harshaw

has lost its right to obtain a patent on any of these trade
secrets»
However, Harshaw is not claiming under the patent
laws.

It does not seek a monopoly against the world.

It

seeks only to invoke the traditional function of equity, to
provide protection against breach of contract or violation
of fiduciary responsibilities.
Some of the arguments against us in this respect
seem to beg the question.
Thus, in the amicus brief filed on behalf of
SCM Corporation, it is said on page 13 that the petitioner’s
rights are, and I quote, "forfeited to the public by commer­
cial use in excess of one year, coupled with failure to file
a timely patent application."
And there are similar statements near the top of
pages 18 and 19, and elsewhere in that brief.
Now, of course, if the petitioner's rights have
been forfeited, then it has no rights remaining, and can
get no relief here.
However, that is not what the statute says, nor is
there any basis for reading the statute to reach such a
conclusion

16

What -the statute says is that a person shall be
entitled to a patent unless the invention has been in public
use more than one year.
The only appropriate conclusion from the language is
that the right to obtain a patent is gone after one year.
There's nothing in the statute to support the contention that
the petitioner forfeited to the public, under the patent
laws, every right available to it, including the protection
of long and traditionally made available rights extended by
courts of equity against breach of contract, or violation of
fiduciary duty.
The court below and the respondents here rely
heavily on this Court's decisions in 1964 in Sears, Roebuck
and Company v. Stiffel Company and Compco Corporation y.
Day-Brite Lighting Company,

both in 376 U,S*

Those cases seem to us to be clearly distinguishable.
They did not involve trade secrets, nor did they involve any
threatened breach of contract or violation of fiduciary
duty.
Both have some rather sweeping language applied to
other facts, but which may well not be properly applicable
on the facts involved here.

Both of the cases involve lamps.

In each case a design patent had been obtained on the lamp,
and in each case the design patent had been held invalid.
There was, of course, nothing secret about the lamps.

17
They were sold fco the public and they and their design were
available for inspection.

They could be photographed and

detail drawings could be made of the design.
What the Illinois court did in each case was to
hold that the plaintiff whose design patent had been held
invalid could nevertheless obtain, in Mr. Justice Black's
words in the Sears opinion, the equivalent of a patent
monopoly on its unpatented lamp*
It's obvious, of course, that such an injunction
by the Illinois court was the functional equivalent of a
patent*

It would be effective against anybody who sought to

make the lamp.
The relief obtained was as wide and as broad as the
protection under a patent*

It did not depend in any way on

breach of contract or violation of a fiduciary duty.
It applied to anyone who sought to make and market
a copy of the lamp, despite the fact that the design patent
had been held invalid.
This Court did recognize, in the opinion in the
case by Mr. Justice Black, that it was not foreclosing all
relief.

It indicated that if there was evidence of passing

off, that the Court could require labeling and otherwise
designating the source of the particular lamp.
But here the respondents are not seeking to
utilise material which is known to the public or otherwise

18

in the public domain.

On the contrary, the respondents are

personally bound by contract and by fiduciary relationship
not to disclose what has been communicated to them in
confidence.
There is, of course, an interrelation between the
patent law and the lav/ of trade secrets.

This has been known

to the profession, to businessmen, to this Court and to
Congress for a great many years.
Some of the briefs, including particularly two of
the amicus briefs, present arguments to the effect that the
economy would be better served by reducing the protection
which has long been granted to trade secrets.
These are arguments on which Congress has never
acted.

They are essentially legislative arguments, calling

for a change in the law in this area, and it has

as it has

long been known and understood, and as Congress has written
it.
In the constitutional field it may well be that
the Court should sit to some extent as a continuing
constitutional convention, bringing about changes in the
interpretation of the Constitution from time to time, since
no one else has power to authenticate the effect of new
developments and new undertakings.
But there’s no reason for this Court to sit as a
continuing legislative body.

Congress is almost continually

19

in session,, and it has undoubted power not only to enact a
patent lav/ but also to determine the impact of the patent
law on the State law of trade secrets.
Many of the arguments presented in support of the
decision below are essentially legislative arguments, and
should be presented to Congress*
The fact is, of course, that Congress has never
taken any explicit action which affects the State law of
trade secrets; and, on the contrary, it has on many occasions,
both before and after the enactment of the Fafcent Code of
1952, and in the Patent Code of 1952, recognised the
existence and continuing validity of trade secrets as they
have long existed under the laws of the several States
pursuant to the traditional doctrines of equity.
For example, in the Patent Code itself, Congress
provided that patent applications should be kept secret,
so that if the patent is eventually denied, the applicant
still has whatever protection he is entitled to from the
trade secret laws»
QUESTION;

You mean, Mr, Griswold, that applications

for patents are, by statute, secret?
MR. GRISWOLD;

They are kept secret, with certain

exceptions, which are specified in the —**
QUESTION’;

And you think that when the -- if the

application is denied, that it is never made public?

20

MR. GRISWOLD:

Then it is not. made public, and the

applicant continues to have whatever rights he may have under
the law of trade secrets»
QUESTION; Do you have a reference to that provision,
by any chance?
MR» GRISWOLD:

Yes, it’s cited in our brief.

I'll

ask Mr. Springel to —
QUESTION:

All right.

If it's in your brief,

that's fine.
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

— to find it.

Thank you.

MR. GRISWOLD:

That's all.

Finally, I would call the Court's

attention to the fact that trade secrets play a major role
in the economy of the United States, both domestic and
foreign.
Many businesses have been founded and conducted
on the basis of trade secrets, of which the Coca-Cola
Company is perhaps the classic example.
This is 35 U.S. Code, section 122, Mr. Justice
White, and it is cited in a footnote on page 35 of our brief.
There is similar provision in the regulations of the Patent
Office.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.
I wanted to be sure about your

reference to Coca-Cola.

This has been my impression that

21

this is the long-term, classic example of a trade secret
that has never been discovered; right?
MR. GRISWOLD;

That's my ■understanding.

± think

it's part of the folk law, the legal folk law of the
country, I might say.
In recent years, much American know-how, many
American processes and procedures have been licensed abroad,
and the royalties received for these ideas have a very
substantial impact on our balance of payments.
It seems odd, indeed, that because of the patent
laws, designed to protect American inventors and American
industry, this whole structure of industrial property which
has been widely and effectively utilised, not hoarded, not
suppressed, should be in danger of destruction.
There's nothing in Sears and Compco, we submit,
which is inconsistent with the continued application of the
State lav; of trade secrets.

The court below misconstrued and

misapplied those decisions in reaching its conclusion, and,
accordingly, the judgment should be reversed,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Griswold.

Mr. McCoy.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. McCOY, JR,, ESQ;,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. McCOY;

May it please the Court — pardon me

— Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;

22

Permit me to begin by reference to the specific,
precise injunction that's before the Court, and that appears
at page 92 to 94 of the Appendix, and this is a Permanent
Injunction; the only aapegt of it that is not permanent is
paragraph D, where it says:

It is ordered that defendants,

Bicron and the individual respondents, "shall not be restrained
by this injunction from using any trade secret of plaintiff
after it has been released to the public by plaintiff, such
as by the issuance of a patent, or has otherwise become
generally available to the public, or other members of the
industry, or is obtained by defendants from sources having
the legal right to convey such information,”
And I also call the Court's attention to the title
of this injunction; it says "Order for Permanent Injunction"*
Now, there was no award of damages by the District
Court, and the action of the Court of Appeals was to reverse
the District Court and remand for dismissal of the complaint*
The action of the Court of Appeals appears at page
26 of the Petitioner's Appendix to their Petition for Writ
of Certiorari.
Now, still going to the — if I may, Your Honor,
refer to the decision of the Court of Appeals, and it's at
page A7 of the Certiorari Petition, where the Sixth Circuit
characterized the issue that it felt was in front of it,
and the Sixth Circuit said:

"Therefore, the issue presented to this Court, in
the instant case may be summarised as follows:

Whether a

state trade secret law which protects an invention which
would be an appropriate subject for a patent under the
Patent Laws of the United States, and which has been used
commercially for more than one year conflicts with the policies
and purposes of Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, of the
Constitution and the Patent Laws adopted pursuant thereto."
Now, this is the last thing I'll read.
go back to page 6 of the Appendix,

If I may

also in the same Sixth

Circuit opinion, they — this is setting up their question,
the Sixth Circuit sayss
"We must determine whether the trade secrets laws
of the State of Ohio are required to be struck down in this
case as being in conflict with the United States Patent
Laws, and, if so, to what extent.

Kewanee urges that the

issue presented to this Court requires a determination as to
whether the enforcement of any and all state trade secrets
laws conflict with the policies of the United States Patent
Laws.

Thus framed we consider the issue too broad for our

consideration in this case»"
Nov/, as we have set out in our brief, we say the
issue is a permanent injunction, granted by a District Court,
as to subject matter, the trade secret subject matter, in
conflict with the patent laws of the United States.

24
The specific —
QUESTION:

Is that because it's that much longer

than seventeen years in part?
MR. McCOY:
QUESTION;

Yes, that is.
Of course, Coca-Cola has managed to keep

its secret for more than seventeen years, haven't they?
HR» McCOY: Well, Your Honor, yes, I was coming to
that; but the thing is we don't think that Coca-Cola is —
that's a trade secret that's outside of the scope of x/hat
we're dealing xvith nox*.
The kind of trade secrets we're dealing with are,
first, trade secrets that are patentable subject matter, as
provided in the Patent Code, 35 USC 101,

And Coca-Cola, in

our view, is a food recipe and it would not be susceptible
of getting a patent,
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that if a man applies

for a patent and it's rejected as not patentable, say, no
invention, no — that that would be subject to, under your
argument could be validly subject to a trade secret?
If it's rejected by the Patent Office,
MR. McCOY:

I suggest — I would say that under

the decisions of this Court in Sears, Compco and Lear, that
if a man applies for a patent and it's held not patentable,
and it's been in public use for more than a year, he could
not get an injunction

25

QUESTION;

Yes.

MR* McCOY:

To prohibit somebody else, even if

there is a

what is argued as a —
QUESTION:

Do you think the

this you spin out

as an intent of Congress to prohibit that, by the virtue
of the patent laws?
It's a preemption or a conflict sort of argument,
isn’t it?
MR. McCOY:

I would say it's a conflict, yes.

QUESTION:

And so you say Congress couldn't

have intended the State trade secrets law to stand along
with the patent law?
MR» McCOY:

I'd want to be careful, Your Honor.

I’d say that the aspect of the State trade secret law that
is in front of this Court is the injunction only.
QUESTION:

Yes, unh-hunh.

MR. McCOY:

And I say as to, if a man files for a

patent application and it's rejected and he can't get a patent
application, he should not be able to get injunctive relief.
QUESTION: Well, why do you suppose Congress provides
for secrecy of patent applications?
MR. McCOY:

Well — the circumstances in which

patent applications are filed.

A number of patent applica­

tions, there's no license activity whatsoever.

And I think

that the idea, there is an election theory and this is what —

26
QUESTIONs Well, there is a specific provision in
the Code that says patent applications will be kept secret
unless the applicant permits the publication.
MR. McCOY:

Correct.

Yes,

But actually the word

used is not "secret”, it’s " confidential*'.
QUESTION:
MR. McCOY:
QUESTION:

Yes.
That's correct.
And do you agree that the Patent Office

interprets the statute to require or permit confidentiality
if the application for a patent is denied?
MR. McCOY:

Well, I think, with all due respect,

Your Honor, you're — the Patent Office, as I understand it,
would never disclose a patent application.
QUESTION:
MR. McCOY:
QUESTION:
MR. McCOY:
QUESTION:

But —

That's to avoid publication, isn't it?
Why, sure.
Yes* I know.
And it's *—
Then what's the difference between that

and what Justice White is asking you?
QUESTION:

The question is:

does Congress

if

Congress •— it seems to me if Congress, in the patent laws,
has recognized there is a role for secrecy or confidentiality
with respect to certain processes or designs, or patentable
material or unpatentable material, you at least have to get
over that in arguing that the patent laws were intended to

preempt. State laws.
MR.: McCOY:

Well, Your Honor, I think you're

attaching much too much importance to that provision.
QUESTION %

X gather you'd think that.

MR. McCOY:

The other people have --

You say you have to get around it.

All right.

statutes.

All right.

They've cited a number of other

For example, when a corporation deals with the

SEC, it discloses its inner workings and financial informa™
tion, and the government is forbidden against disclosure of
that information.

And they've cited a number of statutes

here where the idea is, in our view, that when you deal with
the government, if it's important to the person making the
submission, the government says, Well, we’ll keep that
confidential, we'll not disclose.
Now, the government isn't, in the patent statutes
or the SEC statutes or anything else, they're not saying:
We thereby put — we thereby put an. impermanenture on the
sort of relief that's provided, that was provided by the
District Court in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't — let me go back to the

28

question I asked and you didn't answer»

Do you -— is it the

practice of the Patent Office, when an application is denied,
a patent application is denied, to still treat the applica­
tion confidentially?
MR* McCOY:

Yes.

QUESTION; And they will not reveal it to anyone
without the consent of the applicant, I take it?
f

.

MR. McCOY:
QUESTION:

That's the practice, yesi
And would you suggest that that's wholly

consistent with the Act of Congress?
MR. McCOY:

Certainly, yes.

I see no problem

with it.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.
And what's the purpose of that?

To

protect the secrecy or confidentiality?
MR. McCOY:

I think the real purpose is to let a

man with an invention deal with the Patent Office in
confidence, in knowing that he has an invention and he
thinks it's a ~
QUESTION:

I know, but when his dealings are over,

which they are, substantially, at the denial of the applica­
tion, —
MR. McCOY $
QUESTION:

Yes.
— then what is the rationale for

continuing the confidentiality of that information?

29

MR. McCOY;

Well, I think it's the same rationale.

The man has —QUESTION:

It's a secret, just keep it a secret.

For what purpose?
MR. McCOY:

Well, it isn't saying it v/ill keep

the — what they say is, We'll not disclose v/hat you've
disclosed to us.

So the man feels free to disclose an

invention.
QUESTION:

Do you know why?

QUESTION;

What is the purpose of it?

MR. McCOY:

I think the purpose is to make people

feel free to deal with the U, S, Patent Office.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose then you would say

there would be a federal cause of action against the
Commissioner of Patents if he proceeded to disclose a patent
application, whether pending or denied?
MR, McCOY:

You mean by an individual against

the —
QUESTION:
MR. McCOY;

Yes,

By the applicant.

I suppose there would,

I'm not aware

that anybody has done that,
QUESTION; Well, I know, but if they would, you’d
nevertheless say that that same owner, in the interest of
protecting confidentiality, couldn't sue somebody he had a
contract with to maintain that trade secret.

30

MR. McCOY:

No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor,

QUESTION:

You're saying you couldn't get an

injunction against him*
HR. McCOY:
QUESTION:

Correct.
But he could get an injunction against

the Commissioner.
MR. McCOY;

Ho, he couldn't.

I don't think he

should be able to do that, either.
QUESTION:

Well

QUESTION:

Suppose three members of the Patent

Office technical staff, who had dealt with the patent
application, resigned from the Patent Office and set up a
company, after the patent application was denied, and then
began producing the very substance that was involved in the
confidential file? would you think the court of equity could
enjoin them?
Laying aside any statutory violation which there
might be, could a court of equity stop them from using this
secret information?
MR. McCOY:

I think the relief in the court of

equity should be, in that situation, against disclosure of
the trade secret, because there they're ~ assuming it's
not disclosed in the product that they're selling.
As far as the use is concerned, that is, can
always be measured by reasonable royalties.

The idea of a —

QUESTION;

Well, but if there's no patent, how

do you get any royalties?
MR. McCOY:

Well, they have the same concept with

respect to trade secrets, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Oh,

But then they could be — they

could not be enjoined but they could collect royalties?
MR. McCOY:

No, Your Honor, I’m saying that if

three examiners in the Patent Office, taking your example,
leave the Patent Office and there's been a disclosure in
confidence to them, and they then set up and start abusing
the disclosure, that —
QUESTION:

The fiduciary information,

MR» McCOY:

Yes.

Yes, I'd say that they should

that they should be enjoined against any further disclosure
of their — of the secrets, assuming it’s not disclosed
when they use it.

In other words, if the irreparable

harm has not been done, then they should be enjoined from
doing it; as for use, I v/ould say that you can always measure
the damages by the use, by, in effect, the same rules that
you apply in a patent royalty accounting,
QUESTION:

Well, then are you suggesting that

the remedy here is to get some kind of an equity decree
fixing a royalty for the use of this material, this
information?
MR» McCOY:

Well, I’m not sure what case you're

32

talking about, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

We're now on your case.

MR. McCOY:

If it's the case right in front of

you.
QUESTION:

No, your case.

MR. McCOY:

Well, there's been no use of the

invention in this case.

Our people haven't used these

secrets at all, and I say that they — that the — and there's
no real threat of disclosure.

So I say there should be no

injunction whatsoever.
QUESTION:

But if, then, this was follov^ed by use

and production, then you have indicated, I take it, that
a court of equity might fashion some kind of a decree for
royalties or damages.
MR, McCOY:

Well, I'd say if our people use it in

production and abuse the confidence, then there should be
damage relief.
But there should not be any injunctive relief.
Because, when they give injunctive relief, you're enjoining
somebody from doing something where the Kewanee people
rejected the idea of federal patent protection, they could
not get a patent -- they couldn't get a patent, they couldn't
get a patent injunction? they're getting better relief under
the State trade secret laws than they could get under the
patent laws.

And that's where I say there's a conflict.

33

QUESTION:

Well, isn’t -that why some industries

now deliberately refrain from seeking patents, where they
might get them, if the structure of the situation is such
that they can preempt the market in the field by simply
producing, and hoping that no one will be able to exercise
the reverse engineering and figure out how to make it,
make the particular product?
MR, McCOY:

Well, Your Honor, by the nature of the

amici briefs that seems to be the case, yes.

There seems to

be a flight from the patent system over to the trade secret
system.
QUESTION:

But it does give only — the trade

secret system gives relief only against those who are
subject to the trade secret restriction.

It certainly

doesn't give a right against the public or anybody who
independently arrives at this —
MR, McCOY:
QUESTION:
MR. McCOY:

Mo, but that is so
—- particular information.
That's, in a way, an illusory argument.

The relief that you want — in this case there are three
U. S. companies, three U. S. competitors of Kewanee, Bicron
is the fourth.

Now, there — assuming they had a patent,

there are only four people they'd even consider suing.
What I'm saying is that I don't say that it's
equivalent to a patent monopoly, but, for practical purposes,

34

it's very close to it.
QUESTION:

Well, if any of ’their competitors

came by this information independently, through their own
staff, they certainly wouldn't be subject to any litigation
under the trade secret law.
HR. McCOY:

No question about it.

If I may go back to Mr. Justice White's — yonr
other question was the man who gets the abandoned patent
that's rejected.

There is a Sixth Circuit case of

American Gage vs. Mazdem, that's 245 F. 2d 62, where an
individual made a contract with a corporation for the
manufacture of a wire stretcher for fences, and a patent
application was filed and the patent application was rejected,
and the individual received royalties for a period of time,
and then he did not advise the corporation that the patent
application had been rejected.

And then the corporation

terminated its contract, and the corporation continued to sell
stretchers.

So the individual sued for unjust enrichment.

And the Sixth Circuit said that the individual had
the right, along with the rest of the world, to produce and
sell wire stretchers? and they cited Singer v. Jones, Kellogg,
West Point, that series of cases which are cited in Sears and
Compco.
QUESTION:
somewhere.

How does that help here?

You lost me

35

MR* McCOY:

Well, I think it helps me on the idea

that if a person submits an idea to the Patent Office and
the Patent Office says that it's not patentable subject
matter, then that — he should not be -- he should not be
enjoined from doing that.
QUESTION:

Under any circumstances.

Well, in that case it wasn't a secret,

though, was it?
MR. McCOY:

Well, it was disclosed in secrecy to

the corporation, and it was in a factory;

I think it

certainly was a secret, yes,
QUESTION:

But publicly used.

MR. McCOY:

Well, it would be publicly used in

accordance with the patent laws? yes. Your Honor.
QUESTION;
MR. McCOY:
QUESTION:
MR. McCOY:

Yes, but there was no patent here.
That's correct.
In your case,
The Patent Office said, The Patent

Office considered the development; and said, It doesn't
rise, it's not a patentable subject matter.
So if the Sixth Circuit had granted an injunction,
the effect would be to give injunctive relief, under State
trade secret laws, where there would be no such relief under
the patent statute.
QUESTION:

In that case was there any contract

between them not to disclose?

36

MR* McCOY:

I don’t know, Your Honor»

QUESTIONt

That would be quite important, wouldn't

it?
MR. McCOY:

There would probably be an implied

contract to that effect.

But I don’t know whether — I don’t

know the nature of the contract.
I’d like to pick up where General Griswold was
talking about the subject matter that's before the Court, and
by that I mean the sodium iodide thallium activated crystals,
that they are used in — that this is a subject matter which
is very vital to this country at this point in time.

It’s

detecting malignant tumors in medicine, it's used in oil
exploration, it's used in the location of uranium oil.
This is the substance.

And I, of course, am drawing

a parallel with the subject matter in Goldstein, which,
depending upon your age group, is or is not substance.
Now, the specific trade secrets involved in this
case are set out in Volume 1 of the Appendix in the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals, pages 108 to 110, in case you want
to look at them.
The point I want to make there is that those trade
secrets are not described in the way a patent is described,
they are merely identified.

You just look at them, they're

just -- it's a one or two or three lines, that’s all.
How, the cases

37
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we'll pick up

there right after lunch.
MR. McCOY:

Okay,

to reconvene at 1:00 p.xn. , the same day.]

38

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1;00 p.m.3
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. McCoy, we've taken

perhaps a little inordinate amount of your time and you have
a, we have a complex case before us, so we'll enlarge you
five minutes, and add something to the Solicitor General's,
the former Solicitor General, as well.
It's hard to break habits here.
MR. McCOY:

Thank you.

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may proceed.

So

that will give you fifteen minutes yet.
MR. McCOY:

Thank you.

May it please the Court:
I'd like to pick up on this matter of the section
122 of the patent statute.

I have two very brief points.

The first one is that, in our view, the purpose of
that statute is no different than any of the other statutes
that have been cited in the brief of the petitioner.
And, secondly, that if somebody violates any one
of those statutes, the relief is provided in section 19 USC
1905, at page la of petitioner's appendix.
QUESTION:

Would you tell me what an abandoned

patent application is?
MR, McCOY s
QUESTION:

Pardon me?
What is an abandoned patent application?

39

MR. McCOY:

Well, you file —
Does that include one that’s been denied

MR» McCOY:

Yes.

It would, it would

would include other kinds, too.

but it

application where it's been denied and you determine that ™~
QUESTION:
MR, McCOY:

There’s no use.
— you don’t think you're going to get

good enough protection, so you don’t, press it.

QUESTION;

I mean it's

I notice the regulations speak of

pending applications and abandoned ones; but it doesn't
speak specifically of denied ones»

I take it, the abandoned

category includes the denied ones.
MR. McCOY:

Yes.

Yes.

Thank you.

The cases we rely upon, and that the Sixth Circuit
relied upon, were the Sears, Compco and Lear.

In a nutshell,

we read those cases to hold three things.
First, that there is a strong federal policy
favoring the full and free use of ideas in the public domain.
Secondly, that the public domain is anything which
is not protected by a patent, copyright, or trademark.

That

concept is developed in our brief, but I think that's a faildefinition of the public domain; and, if I may, I believe
it's discussed in a somewhat different context in the majority

40

opinion in Goldstein.

I'm not — I don't have the official

report, but where this Court said: "In regard to mechanical
configurations, Congress has balanced the need to encourage
innovation and originality of invention against the need to
insure competition in the sale of identical or substantially
identical products.

The standards established for granting

federal patent protection to machines thus indicated not
only which articles in this particular category Congress
wished to protect, but which configurations it wished to
remain free.
"The application of State law in these cases to
prevent the copying of articles which did not meet the
requirements for federal protection disturb the careful
balance which Congress had drawn, and thereby necessarily
gave way tinder the supremacy clause of the Constitution."
Now, I believe a further development of that concept
is the thought that this word "public" when you speak of
public domain may be a little confusing*
thrust of the Sears, Compco cases ares

I think that the
if you have

intellectual property and you wish to protect it, get
yourself a patent or a copyright or a trademark.

Mr. McCoy, —
And that you can't protect yourself by

a contract.
MR. McCOY;

Pardon me?

4.1
QUESTION;

And that you can't protect yourself by

a contract.
MR, McCOYs
Your Honor,

You can protect yourself by a contract,

Like these disagreements —

QUESTION:

But I gather your argument is that

the contract made with these respondents not to disclose
what they learned while employed with the petitioner, that's
irrelevant to the case entirely?

The argument that you’re

making.
MR, McCOY: Well, I can't say it’s irrelevant.
QUESTION:

But I —

QUESTION:

You say it's specifically enforoible,

though?
MR. McCOY:

I say they're not enfcrcible, as far

as an injunction is concerned.

I say they can’t enjoin them

from using.
QUESTION:
MR. McCOY:

How about damages?
I say you can get damages.

And the

cases that discuss, there’s a dissent in a Second Circuit case,
it's Pranke v, Wiltschek,

/ 209 F.

2d,

493, a dissent by a

Judge Frank, where he made that very point.

He said you

can't get an injunction, you can get damages,
QUESTION:
MR. McCOY:

Is that in your brief, by the way?
I'm afraid it isn’t, Your Honor, no.

QUESTION: Well, what’s the cite again?

42

MR. McCOY; All right.

It's Franks v. Wiltschek,

209 F. 2d. 493.

QUESTION:

209 F. 2d. 493.

Mr. McCoy, you've used the words

"public domain" twice now.

Do you draw any distinction

between public domain and public use?
MR* McCOY:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, I take it that Coca-Cola is in

public use, I suppose the Coke people would question whether
it’s in the public domain.

And I take it that the Solicitor

General would take the same position here.
MR. McCOY:

Well, my — with respect to Coca-Cola,

I'd say this, Your Honor, that a Coca-Cola is not patentable
subject matter,
QUESTION; Well, suppose it were.

What would your

answer be?
MR. McCOY:

My answer would be there would be a

public use.
QUESTION:

But I take it, then, you would say it is

not in the public domain?
MR. McCOY:

I'd say it is in the public domain,

too.
QUESTION:

It is?

HR. McCOY:

By the definition of this Court in

Sears, Compco and Lear.
QUESTION: Well, then, how can you say you could get
damages?

You get damages because there's a wrongful use,

a vise that's forbidden, that the law forbids.

And you get

damages because the law forbids you to break your contract.
MR* McCOY:

Yes.

QUESTION: And so it's a wrongful use, but you say
equity could not enjoin the use.
MR. McCOY:
QUESTION:

Should not; correct*
Although the same court could give

damages based on the fact that it's a wrongful use.
MR. McCOY:
QUES TION:
MR* McCOY:

Correct.
Unh-hunh.
And if I may go back, Your Honor, the

Sixth Circuit has had, really, three cases before it on trade
secrets.

Your confusion arises by reason of the way the

petitioner is characterizing this case*
They're saying we're trying to outlaw all trade
secret agreements, all know-how, we're trying to upset the
balance of payments.

And we say no.

44
All we’re concerned with is the narrow question of
an injunction of former employees in this case, where the
Harshaw Chemical Company, dealing with subject matter of vital
interest to this country, these are the sodium iodide thallium
activated crystals, they chose to avoid the patent system
where, if they had patented, they could have gotten their
injunction.

Instead of going through the patent system, they

said, We're smarter, we'11 stay out of it.

And suddenly a

situation arose, and then they come in and they want to be given
and they got, a permanent injunction; which is better than
any relief they could have gotten in the patent system.
And we say that is a —- there is a — they are
defeating the purposes of the patent system; and that isn't
correct*
QUESTION; Well, you have another element in this
case, and that’s violation of a fiduciary relationship
alleged.

And apparently, to some extent, found*
MR» McCOY;

Well, Your Honor, with all due respect,

where the language of the Court of Appeals came from about that,
I don't know.

If there — the findings of fact are referred

to in our brief, and there was no violation of any fiduciary
relationship here*
QUESTION; What did the District Court find on 'that?
MR, McCOY;

The District Court found there had been

no use or disclosure of the trade secrets.

The findings are

45

referred to in about the third page of our brief.

7md in the

transcript, we’ve cited you to the record on that.
There wasn't any.

Our people didn't do anything

wrong, that's the reason they're so concerned.

They try to

go out and start their own business, and they say, It's a
free country, isn't it?

And they didn't do anything wrong,

and they're put under an injunction.

And the injunction is

a severe handicap on their — that they're trying to raise
money.
QUESTION:

But they did break a contract.

QUESTION:

Any of the secrets —

MR. McCOY:

No, they didn't.

MR. McCOY:

There are expired patents, there are

publications of government research laboratories.

And,

incidentally, the government paid Harshaw a million dollars
to develop ~ oh, I don't know exactly how much, but a lot
of money to develop these secrets.
QUESTION:

Did they use anything that they learned

at the other company?

Anything?

Thank you for admitting

that much.
MR. McCOY:

Right,

Certainly,

But all I’ll say, Your Honor, —

QUESTION:

And in doing that, didn't they violate

the terms of the contract?
MR, McCOY;
QUESTION:
MR. McCOY:

No.

They didn’t,

Why not?
Because the contract says they can't

disclose confidential or secret information.

It doesn’t

say they can’t use what they learned there, other than
confidential and secret information,
QUESTION: Well, you think that — well, who else
made a seventeen-inch one?
MR, McCOY:
QUESTION:

Well, there are actually -If this was so public, I mean, how come

the other companies didn’t do it?
MR. McCOY:

Your Honor, at page 1410 of the

transcript in the District Court, the Karshaw man finally
admitted, in response to questions of the judge, that —
and this is cited in our brief, too, -- that there is no
magic in the trade secrets in seventeen inches.

They said

48

there were secrets that applied to all different sizes»
QUESTION:

But the District Judge found to the

contrary, didn't he?
Didn't the District Judge find that twenty of these
were trade secrets?
MR. McCOY:

Yes.

QUESTION: Didn't he?
MR. McCOY:

He found that.

Yes, he did.

Yes, he did.

QUESTION: And you still say they weren't trade
secrets?
MR. McCOY:

We say none of them were

trade secrets.

the patent argument.

QUESTION:

Just the remedy was all they disagreed

MR. McCOY;
QUESTION:

Mr. McCoy, as I understand your

position now, it is that there has been no violation of the
contract.
MR. McCOY:
QUESTION:

Correct.
I thought you had said earlier that

there could be a suit for damages, but I suppose you mean
if there had been a violation.
MR. McCOY:

No, Your Honor.

I was speaking

generically as to the relief — the point I'm trying to make
when I speak of suit for damages is that we're not seeking
to outlaw all these technical service agreements between
various companies and so forth.

In this case, no, there

shouldn't be a suit for damages, because there was no
violations found.
The instructions of the Court of Appeals are to
reverse and dismiss the complaint.

QUESTION;

Mr. McCoy, may I ask yon one more

gues tion?
You’ve emphasized the fact that, this injunction
could extend longer than the seventeen-year period covered
by a patent.

Suppose the contract had provided for limitation

on the use of secrets only, say, for three years; would
you think an injunction would be appropriate there?
MR. McCOY:

My position on that, Your Honor, is

no, I don’t think it's appropriate to give any injunctive
relief under a trade secret contract, because you are
enjoining somebody from doing something that, at that point,
is supposedly in the public domain.
I'll go back to that American Gage case of the
Sixth Circuit, and these — and other cases to the same
effect.
The — I started with Sears ,Corapco, the other case
we do rely upon is Goldstein.
brief.

We've touched that in our

I don't think that -— and I've read what I feel is

the relevant language there.
QUESTION;

From Sears and Compco, Mr. McCoy,

the object was something you could see as to its configura­
tion, just, as you could this thermal drinking cup.

You

can't —• a stranger can't look at this mass of crystals, or
whatever they are, and know how to make it, or copy it,
can he?

52

MR. McCOY:
QUESTION:

Wo.
So that there is some distinction between

Sears and Compco cases and tills situation in that respect.
MR. McCOY5

Well, legally, I donst know, I don’t

think so.
I think that what you said in Sears, Compco was
that if you have intellectual property and you want to
protect it, then get yourself a patent or a trademark or a
copyright.
QUESTION:

Well, you can't keep a secret of

something that you actually issue to the whole world, as you
do with a book if you. publish it without a copyright, or
the lamp stand in these other cases, can you?
That's distinguishable from a trade secret
situation, is it not?

Nothing very secret about the lamp

involved in these earlier cases.
MR* McCOY:

Well, no, Your Honor.

But the concept

of the lamp case was that there was a design patent involved
there, I believe, and the Illinois

I mean the courts in

Illinois said that's an invalid patent.

So therefore there

was no protection under the patent laws.
But then the court turned around and said;

But

we'll give you protection under Illinois unfair competition
laws.
And I would go back to the language I quoted from

53

your Goldstein decision, and that -- and I'm saying that the
Supreme Court and the Congress have said, this is the
patentable subject matter, and anything that's outside that,
in the penumbra, or whatever you want to call it, that
people can use.
Your Honor, I see my time is up.

X do — may I

read very briefly this Pain tor, v. Bourns , language in that
case where the decision was —- it's relied upon substantially
by the petitioner.
And I want to say that, about two-thirds down in
the second column at page 225, the Court clearly cuts itself
out from the injunction concept that we're discussing now,
the -— this is the majority opinion of the decision there.
It says:
"Provisions against competition not utilising trie
secret after expiration of agreement are a different matter
which must be judged on their ox^rn facts,"
And I think that's the case we're after.
I thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr, McCoy.

Do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN N, GRISWOLD, ESQ,,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

I wish you would straighten out for me

54

whether there was a contract or not,
MR, GRISWOLD:
Justice*

Oh, there were six contracts, Mr,

There was a contract with each of the employees.
The contract in the case of Hamner was with a

predecessor company, which was taken over by Harshaw.
QUESTION:

And the contract had a succession clause

in it, did it not?
MR. GRISWOLD:
QUESTION:

Succession clause»

MR, GRISWOLD:
successors, yes.

It had a what?

It applied with respect to

And Hamner was in the employ of Harshaw

for a while before he left,
QUESTION:

Now, what about the Menefee trade secret

agreement; was that only with Menefee or were there other
trade secret agreements like that one?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Menefee's, I know —

There were contracts with all —

there were contracts with all six; some of them were employ­
ment contracts, some of them were more sweeping trade-secret
contracts.
QUESTION:

Yes,

MR. GRISWOLD:

There was not a trade-secret

contract with every one, but there was an employment contract
with every one, or a trade-secret contract,

This is spelled

out in the finding, that there was a contract; and either
contract

is broad enough to cover what's involved here.

Moreover.,

they were all employees, so that they

are all covered by — were all confidential employees, so
that they were all covered by the fiduciary relationship.
QUESTION: And I take it the District Court found
that there was an imminent danger of disclosure of trade
secrets that they were forbidden, that the defendants were
forbidden to disclose,
MR. GRISWOLD:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

This is on page

89 of the Appendix, in conclusion 6 of the Court.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR,GRISWOLD:

"The plaintiff has submitted

convincing proof not only that the Riehert formula will not
grow such a crystal but also that in order to grow a
sodium iodide thallium activated scintillation crystal the
defendants must, of necessity, supplement the Riehert
formula with plaintiff's trade secrets,
"The Court concludes that there is an imminent
danger of disclosure of plaintiff's trade secrets to Bicron
and the use of these trade secrets by Bicron."
QUESTION:

And they found that that disclosure

and use would be violative of contracts that had been
signed by —
MR. GRISWOLD:

Would violate the contracts and the

fiduciary relationship.
Nov;, I would like to make a further answer to the

56

question which Mr* Justice Blackmun asked me at the beginning
of the argument, with respect to the opinion of Justice
Marshall, in which Justices Blackmun and Brennan joined, in
the Goldstein case.
That did not turn, at all, on the constitutional
question.

It turned on the fact that the statute involved

there, that is, the Federal Copyright Act, uses the exact
wording of the Constitution? specifically, the words "writings
of an author"±

And from that, those three Justices reached

the conclusion that Congress had occupied the field and
that there was no room for a State statute in the area.
There is nothing comparable to that with respect to
the patent lav/.
And then with respect to Mr. Justice White's
question, I should have been quicker in bringing to your
attention that the statute, the Patent Office statute, is
printed in full in our brief, Title 35, section 122, is in
the Appendix, at page 6as
"Applications for patents shall be kept in
confidence" and so on.
And then on page 3a is the Patent Office regulation
which that statute puts into statutory language, "Pending
patent applications are preserved in secrecy."
regulation used the word, though

The

I don't think that there is

QUESTION:

How about the denied patent applica­

tions, are they published?
MRa GRISWOLD;
QUESTION;

What applications?

What about applications that don't

succeed, that they are not ---•
MR. GRISWOLD:

They are not published, they are

kept in secrecy.
QUESTION:

Where do you find that in the statute

or the regulation?
MR. GRISWOLD;

That is discussed in footnote 35

— in footnote 11 on
QUESTION;

It just talks about abandonment.

MR. GRISWOLD;

Well, that's -- there's a good deal

of this patent language that I'm not —■
QUESTION;

Well, I take it you're --

MR. GRISWOLD:

It's my understanding that patents

which are abandoned, that you are free to terminate your
patent application at any time you want to, and that the
material remains secret.
QUESTION;

Yes, but —

MR. GRISWOLD;

The only thing the Patent Office

publishes is patents which are granted.
QUESTION;

Or where it's waived,

MR, GRISWOLD;
QUESTION;

Or where?

Or where it's waived, and there's anothe

MR. GRISWOLD:

Oh, if it's waived, yes.

Yes, if

you want to make it free, you can.
Thank you.
MRa CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:24 o'clock, p»m., the case in the
above-entitied matter was submitted.]
