Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the i.

Court;
Blair & Company was one of the larger stockborkers in

10

New York, and it apparently ran into very severe financial

trouble at the end of its fiscal year 1969.

'2

that between 1969, that is September of 1969 and September of

13

1970, they gradually liquidated their company by giving away,

literally giving away branches of their stockbrokersge concern

to other concerns to which some of their employees or officers

16

went and became members of.

subordinated debenture holders who were members of their

board of directors to get their money out of the money, and

form, the Special Fund loaned $1,000 to Blair & Company and

proceeded to appoint a man, Mr, Scorese, as a liquidator, in a

very carefully drawn, and very ornate and very carefully

Well, now, this is one of the issues in

Apparently the position taken by the New York Stock

Exchange is that it is a power greater than the court, because

powers were limited to arbitration within the New York Stock
Exchange.

eliminated

by referee Herzog and were not pursued inasmuch as he has in
favor on the basic issue of the appointment of the liquidator.
Our position was, as with Shakespeare, that a rose

24

smells as sweet no matter what its name, that this Mr. Scores©,

25

although named as the liquidator, and at other times as an
i
j

8
agent * actually caste within the intent of this statute, and a
reading of the history of this statutes bears this out.

This

statute was? first enacted in the Bankruptcy Act of 1903. and it
was subsequently amended on several occasion into its present

I
form.

And throughout the several amendments, the basic ex-

AI

pression that was involved here was the doctrine of the appoint-;
mailt of somebody to take charge of the liquidation.

This was

the essential concept, in the use of the words in the statute,

it apparently was limited to a receiver or a trustee.

But at the time this petition was filed, every case,

I

every text, as I have cited in ray brief before this Court,
which I' won't bother to repeat here, held that a liquidator
came within the scope of this statute.

It could have been a

i.
very simple thing for these petitioning creditors to have gone

Scorese came within the acope of section 3(a)(5) of the

Bankruptcy Act, despite the fact that in their wisdom the

attorneys who represented Blair & Company or the New York Stock

of naming Mr. Scorese not as a trustee, which he actually was,

12
sir, and,

interestingly enough, in one of the cases on which I

draw heavily in ray approach to this Court, Bank of Marin v.
England, the same question was also raised as to whether the
decision was moot, and this Court held that there was going to
be further litigation even outside of the bankruptcy proceeding.
And there will be further litigation in this case.

The deter^

mih&tion of what happens to our Rogers stock is specifically
keyed to whether or not there is going to be an adjudication
here by an exhibit which I attach to ray memoranda.
Q

Except there isn’t going to be an adjudication

now, is there?
MR. RAINES:

Wall, I am asking this Court to reverse

til© Court of Appeals and direct an adjudication.
Q

Well, do you mean in face of the chapter 11 con­

troversy?
MR. RAINES:

Yes, the chapter 11 order of confirma­

tion tends to be satisfied.

There is a six-month period within

which a motion can be made to set aside an order of confirma­
tion.
Q

Can there be --

MR. RAINESJ
Q

Sir?

Can there be an adjudication until it is set

aside?
MR. RAINESs

Well, the adjudication is separate from

the order of confirmation.
r

13
Q

Yes, but normally chapter 11 proceedings or after.:

chapter 11 proceedings supersede a bankruptcy adjudication.

|
MR. RAINES;

They supersede it in the sense that they I

set it aside.
Q

That’s right.

MR. RAINES:

That’s right.

They do not dismiss it.

The problem — one of the problems in this case is that when we j
*

moved to rdismiss the chapter 11 proceeding early in the proceed!II
ing, Referee Ballard held up the decision for about nine or ten ]

|
i

months, and when the Court of Appeals came down with the de­
cision reversing the court below and vacating the order of
adjudication, in part of his decision, which I put in my
i

memorandum, he said "I can’t dismiss the proceeding now because j

1

in view of the fact that there is no order of adjudication,
this court would lose jurisdiction of this case and it would be
sort of throwing the case to the wolves, and this was one of
the reasons that Referee Ballard gave for refusing to dismiss
the chapter 11 proceeding.
Q

Do attorneys for petitioning creditors in an in­

voluntary bankruptcy proceeding —- are they normally allowed
fees?
MR. RAINES:
Q

Yes, they are allowed fees.

On the other hand, if yon petition alleging an

act of bankruptcy, and it turns out not to be an act of bank­
ruptcy, you may not get fees?

14
MR» RAINES:

t

If

Wall, that is a question before Referee

Ballard with which there might be some disagreements,
Q

Yes»

And the attorneys for petitioning creditors

in an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding is entitled to fees —
MR. RAINES:
Q

Yes, sir.

— and if that proceeding is superseded by a

chapter 11 case
MR. RAINES:
Q

— he is still entitled to his fee.

MR. RAINES:

Q

He is still entitled to fees.

Yes.

But if he is superseded by a chapter 11 proceed-

|| ing and the bankruptcy proceeding itself was invalid, you may
not be entitled to fees?
MR, RAINES:
Q

May not be.

I. am not —

Is that enough to make this case not moot?

MR. RAINES:

1 think it would — I did not so state in

my memorandum because I felt that my personal affairs is of no

concern to this Court.

ft
»

But. sine© you have been good enough to

raise it, it certainly is one of the elements that I am deeply
concerned with.

There

also is a question of costs.

My client

has lost S3 million and he is now faced with a bill of costs in
the Court of Appeals in excess of $4,000.

Q

Well» the costs outstanding don’t prevent some-

thing from becoming moot. I think.
!5

MR. RAINES:

Well, it is a consideration.

It is an

I

;i

IS
I

element of consideration.

z

not moot is because, as I argued in ray memorandum of lav? judge,

3

this decision of Judge Friendly’s of the Court of Appeals, is

4

in ray opinion one of the most dangerous.

S
S
7

Q

But basically the reason I say it is

But that doesn't prevent it from being moot, even

if it is totally 100 percent wrong, the case still might foe moot

MR. RAINES:

It could be moot on the matter of theory,

0

but it isn't moot because there is much litigation that is still

9

to follow in this case.

29

IS
12

13

And the question of adjudication be­

comes of paramount importance in this subsequent litigation.
Q

I want to make it clear what you — a while ago

you answered that if you were entitled to fees in the involun­

tary bankruptcy proceeding, if you were, and then a chapter 11

14

proceeding cams along, the chapter 11 proceeding would have to

I have rested, if X may go back to ray case in chief,

19

I have rested my position on this appeal, as I did below, on the

fact that this Court has ruled again and again on basic para-

mount issues that the bankruptcy act and the federal courts

'ia G

-

22

have paramount and exclusive jurisdiction of the liquidation of

.23

insolvent estates.

And based upon the cases of Bank or Marin

24

v. England, and Pepper v. Litton, there is doctrine that sub­

28

stance will not give way to form, and that technical

n

17
considerations will not prevent substantial justice from being
!

:

done»
Now, these princip3.es were followed by other courts.
In 1941, in the District Court of Oklahoma, a petition was filed

| which was technicall incorrect, and the court itself, in render-I
| ing its opinion, stated that it had very serious doubts whether
?
; technically it can within the specific scope of the statute, but?
the court said the court will not stand on the technicality

?
with reference to form when substance is alleged.

And it held

.

that, despite its doubt, that the appointment of a liquidator
by contract constituted an assignment for the benefit of
creditors, nonetheless firmed it sufficient to constitute an
’

act of bankruptcy.
Now, this case, in the matter of R. V. Smith, was
cited in Colliers, cited in Remington, the two leading texts on
e,"-,. ■

• -i

the subject as the guide to which we attorneys follow.

And as if
5

have cited in my brief, Colliers specifically said in so many
_

words that a liquidator appointed by contract came within the
'

scops of the statute.
i

In 1953, Judge Weinfeld, who I am certain Your Honors
will recognize as one of the outstanding jurists on the question!
of bankruptcy, wrote a landmark decision in which he argued and i

I

in which he stated — if I may, I have cited it in my brief
here —

again, following the principle of Pepper v. Litton:
"It. is not required that the transferee of the property

6

poses appoints the transferee a ’trustee to take charge of his

11

It is the end result that counts.

Now, this is the point we make here.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY R. MILLER, ESQ.,
1

2

OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. KILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the
I

4

Court:

My name is Harvey R. Miller, and I represent the
•:

§

respondents in this case.

i

It is our position, Your Honors, that the cause pre-

e

1
7

sented today is moot by reason of the termination of the

8

chapter 11 proceedings.

l
!
Approximately two weeks ago, we filed a memorandum in

'0

*
10

which we suggested that the cause is moot.

Subsequently to the

1!

filing of that memorandum, Mr. Raines filed a reply or an

IZ

answering memorandum, and basically Mr. Raines has raised twelve|

13

points.
He agrees one-hundred percent with each of the author­

14

18

ities which we have cited to show that the cause is moot. How■
ever, he says that the court should consider the merits of this

17

matter for the following reasons:

IS

.

j

■

IS

One, he did not receive notice of entry of the order

Ii

IS

of confirmation.

Notice of the hearing to consider confirma­

m

tion of the arrangement was given by the bankruptcy court to all;

zt

parties in interest, including Mr. Raines and his clients.

22

Under rule 77(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as

23

well as rule 922(a) of the Rules of Bankruptcy Practice, which

M

became effective on October 1, 1973, there is no requirement

23

that notice of entry be given, and it specifically states that

22
lack of notice of the entry does not affect the time to appeal
or relieve or authorize the court to relieve a party for fail­
ure to appeal within the time allowed.

The order of confirma­

tion is final for all purposes, distribution has been made to
creditors, administration expenses have been paid,
Q

Mr. Raines mentioned a motion to set aside your

confirmation ■—
MR. MILLER:

There is.

We were served. Your Honor,

with a motion, which I believe is returnable to December 5, to
reconsider his clients’ claims, and I will get to that, if you
will, Your Honor.
Mr. Raines says in his second point that the order of
confirmation was entered prematurely.

Mr. Raines, cm behalf of

his client, made a motion to dismiss the chapter 11 proceeding,
and the basis of the dismissal of the chapter 11 proceeding was
that you could not have an arrangement in this type of a case.
And as I have found in practicing in the bankruptcy court, when
you don’t have much law it becomes almost academic to cite
Pepper v, Litton, because the bankruptcy practitioners take the
position that under Pepper v. Litton you can do anything.
'-Tell, the motion to dismiss was denied by an order
and an opinion of Revere© Babbit, dated February 16, 1973, and
in the final paragraph of that opinion, Referee Babbit said,
"Foley’s motion must be denied in all respects, and upon this
order becoming final, it is expected that Blair will move

23
1

promptly to confirmation or its arrangements.

2

have waited long enough.”

Its creditors

Subsequently to February 16, and with the constant

3
4

prodding of the bankruptcy court, over 9,500 claims were objected

S

to and were resolved, over 9,000 claims were expunged, distribu­

6

tions were made to all of the customer creditors during that

j

7

period of time.

j

8

after it was filed.

9

that it was a premature confirmation.

I respectfully submit that nobody could say

Further, Your Honor, in the brief in opposition that

10

1?

The arrangement was confirmed thirty months

we filed in this proceeding, at least three times we say that

12

confirmation of the. arrangement was imminent and that we were

13

moving toward confirmation.

24

The point which Mr. Raines --

15

Q

Do you think it would have any impact whatsoever

IS

on the finality of the confirmation if the Court of Appeals were ;

17

reversed?

18
19

MR.MILLER;
Q

Hone whatsoever. Your Honor,

II

You would say that because the case — you think

the case is moot?
MR. MILLER;

The proceeding is terminated, Your Honor,

under the authorities which we have cited in the memorandum
suggesting —

24

Q

Well, what about the fee question?

25

MR. MILLER;

5

Mr. Raines has reserved his right to file;
i
I

i

24
an application for allowance.
Q

But the confirmation in paying administrative

expenses did not schedule his fee claim?
MR. MILLER:

Mr. Raines — in fact, Your Honor, I
j

happen to be in the court house that day when Mr. Raines*

<!

partner appeared, and I was called in by Judge Babbit who asked
me if I had any objection if Mr. Raines filed his application
subsequently, and I believe there was a letter from the referee ;
in which —
;I

Q

I know, but he is not entitled to his fees unlessj

this was an act of bankruptcy.
MR. MILLER:

No, X am not. certain, Your Honor, that I ]

would agree with that principle.

H© is entitled to a fee.

Maybe- the quantum of the fee would be different.
■

Q

I

Well, let’s assume that it would be for a moment.

MR. MILLER:
Q

,s

It may well be, Your Hour .

If this was an act of bankruptcy and he was en­

titled to have an involuntary adjudication, he is entitled to
fee.
MR. MILLER:
Q

He may be entitled to a lawyer's fee.

And as an expense of administration the chapter

11 proceeding would have to recognise.
MR,. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would agree with that!,

Your honor.
The third point which Mr. Raines has raised is that

12
s

I

25

2

arrangement was voted and approved by the slim vote of general
'
ji
unsecured creditors. We have set forth in our subsequent memo­

3

randum the actual findings that the bankruptcy court made in

4

respect cf the acceptance of the plan, and of the 7,633 customer

S

creditors whose claims aggregated $37,380,000, 6,350 customer

s

creditors whose claims aggregated $33,100,000 accepted the

7

arrangement.

!

Of the general creditors, 93 creditors, whose

&

claims totalled $3,261,000, 66 accepted the arrangement, and

S

their claims aggregated $2,800,000, hardly a slim majority.

MR.MILLER:

In my terms, Your Honor?

MR. MILLER:

precedents in connection with the matter is if you sustain the
petition, then you are entitled to a greater fee, depending upon
the type of opposition you met, the complexity of the problems,
the amount of time which was devoted to it, the quality of your I
opposition.

So there is a possibl ity that he could be entitled!

MR, MILLER:

If the bankruptcy proceeding, Your Honor,]

j
is superseded by a chapter 11 proceeding, whether there has
•

",

- v '.

been an adjudication or not •— for example, if Immediately sub- .
sequent to the filing of the involuntary petition, without going j
!
to trial cn the issue of adjudication, Blair had filed a chapter;
11 proceeding immediately, the question of adjudication was never
resolved because you have a constructive adjudication in the
Chapter 11 proceeding —

sj

27
S

Q

If the adjudication is resolved adversely to the

2

petitioning creditor, though, then there is no question of the

3

fee?
MR. MILLER:

4
S

I would think not, Your Honor, although I

have heard from Mr. Raines’ partner to the. contrary.
Mr. Raines' fourth point, Your Honors, in respect to

s
7

the mootness point, is that I made a statement before the Second

8

Circuit Court of Appeals that if the District Court decision

9

was reversed, Blair would move to dismiss the chapter 11.

10

never made any such statement.
His fifth point is that 80 percent of the claims in­

31
12
13

I

cluded in the schedules of distribution are subject to objections
as to allowance.
ii

V' '

Mr. Rains pays no attention to the fact that

;

f'

14

approximately 9,500 claims were objected to, trials were heard

IS

before the bankruptcy court, and those claims were resolved.

m

Moreover, there aren’t objections pending as to 80 percent of

u

the claims.

S8

tions, if necessary.

19

23

'

All Blair did was reserve its right to file objec­
If Blair does not file objections within

90 days, then those claims are allowed automatically.
His next point is that Foley’s motion to dismiss the

1\

chapter 11 petition was denied by the referee in bankruptcy who

P?

was strongly influenced by the decision of the United States

23

Court of Appeals.

24

memorandum that an appeal was filed from the denial of the

25

motion to dismiss the chapter 11 proceeding, was heard in the

Mr. Raines does not advise the court in his

i

2S

United States District Court for the Southern District of Mew
York, and the referee in bankruptcy was affirmed, and former
Chief Judge Sylvester Ryan held that the grounds argued by
Folwy for dismissal to be frivolous and without merit or
substance.

Mr. Foley never took an appeal from that decision,-

and that is a final decision.
His next point is that New York Stock Exchange is
being unjustly enriched and creditors might possibly get a
greater return in liquidation under the supervision of the court:
appointed trustee.

Well, even if this Court were to reverse

the chapter 11 proceeding as finished, besides which — and
specifically provided by chapter 11 of the bankruptcy act, you
may have a provision in an arrangement whereby upon the con­
firmation or the conclusion of the proceeding, the remaining
assets of the debtor are transferred to a third party.

Usually

it is the party who put up the money.
Mow) in the case at bar, the Mew York Stock -Exchange
advanced $20.4 million to satisfy customer creditor claims in
this case.

The assets remaining to Blair in no way measure up

to $20.4 million.

In addition, in order to confirm a chapter 11

proceeding under section 365 of the bankruptcy act, the bank­
ruptcy court must make a determination that the arrangement is
for the best interest

of creditors.

The phrase "best interest

of credits” has been construed to mean and require a determin­
ation by the bankruptcy court that the creditors will receive

K
29
more in satisfaction of their claims pursuant to the chapter 11
arrangement than they would receive in a liquidation of the
©state in ordinary bankruptcy.
There was an evidentary hearing before the referee in
bankruptcy and he made a finding that this arrangement was in
the best interests of creditors, that they would receive more
under the arrangement than they would receive in the event of
a liquidation under ordinary bankruptcy chapters 1 through 7.
Mr, Raines® next point is that an adjudication in
bankruptcy can be use.d as a fulcrum upon which a more complete
investigation and interrogation to the very justice of the plan j
:
:

j
'

'I.

and a reconsideration of the best interests of creditors should
be predicated.
This arrangement was proposed by Blair on May 25,

He never once, mentions that there are other acts of

4

bankruptcy which could.be alleged if Blair was engaged in fraud.

5

If Blair did make a fraudulent conveyance, section 3 has six

acts of bankruptcy , if he missed on this one he could have

filed a petition in which he alleged there was a fraudulent

His next statement, and which he persists in making,

17

is that Blair is guilty of a give-away of $100,000 which has

called give-away was in connection with the sale of the manage­

That so-

j

ment contract for the Blair Fund.

It is the position of Mr.

Foley that Blair should have received a profit on the sale of
that management contract.

Subsequent decisions by the Second

Circuit Court of Appeals in Rosenfeld v. Black have established
;;

24

now that you cannot make a profit on the sale of that contract.

25

In any event, that transcation was never consummated.

Blair did

31
1

deposit with the prospective purchaser $100,000 to serve as

2

liquidator damages in the event that it did not perform in ac-

3

cordance with the contract.
Mr. Foley and Mr. Raines keep insisting that nothing

was done to recover that $100,000»

have told Mr. Foley that an action was commenced in the Supreme

7

Court of the State of Wew York that every effort was being made

The action was commenced in 1971.

In point of fact,
$

:o

it was tried three or four months ago, and by decision dated

i!

October 31, 1973, was decided by the Supreme Court of the State

52

of New York, unfortunately for the defendant.
His next point is that Blair seeks

sold.

Some of the securities are sub­
Otherwise they would have been

He has no right to those securities, the arbitration

award was confirmed by an order of the Supreme Court of the
State of New York.

Mr. Foley never took an appeal from that

decision.
In point of fact, I might also add that Mr., Foley has
pending at the present time two plenary actions.

He is sueing

all of the officers and directors of Blair, alleging 10(b)(5)
violations and common law fraud, efc cetera, he is also sueing
the Mew York Stock Exchange in a plenary action in which he is
asserting that the New York Stock Exchange failed to exercise
and perform its duties of self-regulation.

So that point has

nothing to do with what this Court may do with this particular
matter.
His next to the last point is that he is liable, Mr.
Foley, for costs awarded by the United states Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit.

As Mr. Justice Rehnquist has pointed

out, there is an unbroken line of cases which establishes the
rule that controversy as to costs alone does not salvage an
otherwise moot case.

And a lead case is Walling v. Rooter &

Cos, 321 U.S. 671, and other cases are cited in the footnote
of Mr. Justice Forfcas in the back of the Marin case.

MR, MILLER:

At the time the Second Circuit decided

motion to dismiss the chapter 11 proceeding.

7

never took an appeal from the motion to dismiss the chapter 11

petition, in which he raised exactly the same points he is

and there were many — in fact, at the!

time of the appointment of the liquidator, there were many
plenary actions pending.
Q

Q

Mr. Miller —

MR. MILLER:
Q

Yes, sir.

— am I right in thinking, under New York law,

that if there had been a state court receiver appointed, then
the remedies of the creditors would have had to be directed
against the receiver rather than against Blair?
MR. MILLER:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And in effect,

19
20

21
22
23
24
25

what would happen upon the appointment of a receiver would be
that the property would pass into custodialegis, and creditors
would be constrained to file claims with the receiver and they
would share pro rata.

This is exactly the point in Bonnie

Classics, which is relied on very heavily by 'Referee Herzog
and Judge Cooper.

39
I

In the case of Bonnie Classics , when the corporation

2 '/decided to liquidate under the New York stock corporation law,
1
■

the board of directors became vested with title as trustees and

3
4

j creditors were restrained from proceeding against the property
I
of the corporation a

5
8

They had to wait until the assets were

/ liquidated, the assets v?ere distributed*
Every case in which it has been held that there is a

7

if receiver or trustee appointed under 3(a)(5), there has been an
j
9 ;I inhibition against the creditors proceeding. This was not the

8

SO jfcase in connection with Blair.

In fact, there is a District

: Court case in re Ambrose Matthews & Co., which we cite in our

I!

ji

12

; brief, in which there was a similar type agreement, and the

13 ?i court held — and this is a District Court decision in New Jersejj
14 i! — as the instrument brought about no change in title to the
property, either absolute or conditioned, nothing was conveyed

15

'

13 || or transferred by it, and it could not hinder to delay or de17

jg

|fraud creditors because any creditor could proceed to satisfy
rhis claim from the corporation's property to the same extent as
though the instrument did not exist.

IS

Essentially, Mr. Scores® was an agent of the board of

2i

23
£4
C;“

That is exactly the situa­

tion which occurred in connection with Blair.

20

22

s

1!

| directors of Blair.

He had no greater powers than the board of

| directors had, and he dealt with the property — in fact, he
i
*

l could be removed by Blair.

All Blair had to do at that point

!• in time was pay back the New York stock Exchange $1,000 and Mr.

40
Scores®3s appointment was vacated.
And I might add, on the $1,000, Your Honor, it is
simply a question in order to trigger the appointment o£ a
liquidator.

The Exchange had to advance some money.

Eventu-

ally, $20.4 million came into this case.
How, in connection with the merits of the matter,
under section 3(a)(5), the statute is very specific in talking
about a receiver oar a trust®®.

It is our position that the re­

ceiver or trustee must be judicially appointed or appointed
pursuant to a statute.

And fir. Raines has alluded to the da-

velbprafenfc of section 3(a)(5).

W© have set forth in some detail ;

in otir' brief how the statute was developed.

:i

'-f.y

The point which is ;

relied upon very heavily by the petitioners here is that in the ;
19'26 amendment to section 3(a)(5), the words "appointed pursuant
to the laws of any state or territory" were deleted.
_

As Chief

!

CC"

I

Judge Friendly has noted in the majority opinion in the Court
•
'
■ v /
of-Appeals, that is also sot forth in our brief, the elimination

vf v

j

of those words were described in the House report as only a
phraseology, there was no intent to change the substance of the
k

statute.

And Chief Judge Friendly has gone into great detail
t

in connection with the legislative history.
Furthermore, when Congress intended to use the language

I

|
an agent authorised to liquidate property, Congress has used
that langucige in section 2(a) (21), which was amended as part of j
the -— brought into the bankruptcy act as part of the Chandler

i

41
■

fjj Act in 1938,, it specifically refers to an agent authorised to
■

liquidate property.

s

In 1952, the statute was amended again, section 69{d),i
!
and that language was put into the statute, and 69(d), the
|
statute puts under the jurisdiction of the court an agent authorized to liquidate for the purposes of accounting.

We submit, on

the basis of the amendments and the legislative history that if \
Congress had intended to include as an act of bankruptcy the
I

appointment of an agent authorised to liquidate, it would have

|
j

said so, as Chief Judge Friendly has pointed out.
We believe, and we submit to the Court, that this is

,
Iv

a matter for the legislature to deal with.

And I might point

out to the Court that there is presently pending before the
■

?

House and before the Senate a new bankruptcy act, K.R. 10792,
which, is legislatively going to change the acts of bankruptcy
and will include in those acts of bankruptcy an agent authorized

I

to liquidate property.

How, on the basis of that, we submit that this is some}thing that should be left to the legislature.

This Court should
J

not enlarge section 3(a)(5) so that a petition can be filed
simply because an agent is appointed to liquidate.
Filing a bankruptcy petition is not a matter which
should be taken lightly.

There are many, many factors that are I

involved, there, are many, many people that are affected by the
filing of the petition.

In this case, customers were adversely j

1

affected.
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued a re­

2

3

lease in which they pointed out that the administration of these

4

proceedings had cost an additional $5 million by reason of the

S

bankruptcy petition.

■S

They criticise the filing of the petition

and the allowance of the commission.

This situation could never
