You have 15 minutes left.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH C. BARTON, ESQ.
MR. BARTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
1 believe at the conclusion of yesterday's session,
the Court had addressed itself to the 6{c> argument concerning
the application of state law, and in that connection. 1 would
like to point out to the Court that the Securities s Exchange
Commission, in their amicus brief filed under the auspices of
the Solicitor General, considered that very argument made by
the Petitioner, and stated on page 9 of its brief that there is
no basis for suggesting that Rule 347(b) was required to
implement the literal language of the Act or any Commission
rule.
It further concluded that the application of
California law was proper in this case and urged affirmance of
the California court decision.
I would like to point out regarding section 6(c) that
it specifically provides that any rule enacted by any Exchange
must conform to the rules and regulations of the Securities G
Exchange Act, as well as the rules and regulations of the
Securities s Exchange Commission; and that this Court has held

20
•in Silver v. New York Stock Exchange that & rule of on
Exchange may be judicially invalidated as being beyond the
great purposes of the Securities & Exchange Act.
I submit that 28(c) and Rule 347(b) as adopted by the
New York Stock Exchange is a stipulation within the meaning of
section 78(cHc)(a) of the Act and is void by reason thereof.
Moreover, it is inconsistent with the grant of
judicial authority that Congress gave the courts in section 27
v

•:* .

(

of the Act, which would be 15 USC 78aa, and that provides that
the District Courts of the United States shall have e y»c 3/cis x v't',
jurisdiction of violations of this chapter with the rules and
regulations thereunder.
In addition, Rule 347(b) is Inconsistent with th®
provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, since admittedly it­
is an agreement which concerns interstate commerce and which is
a part of th® esaployruant contract.
As this Court noted in the Prima Paint decision, the
Federal Arbitration Act was not meant to apply to contracts of
employment between parties of am equal bargaining strength.
Justice Black, in his dissenting opinion in that case, spelled
cut the legislative intent behind the Federal Arbitration Act,
and that was that it was not meant to apply to contracts of
employment♦
Now, both this Court, in Silver and the Senate Subcom­
mittee

or

Securities, in its extensive analysis of the

functioning of the New York Stock Exchange, conclu dad that
judicial review was necessary regarding the self**r i-/u.lato:\y
powers of the New York Stock Exchange.

And I woul cl like to

observe at this point that it is not the New York Stock
Exchange which is a party to this law suit but, rather, a
private corporation that came into existence by virtu© of
state law, and that Merrill Lynch, like being a member of the
Hew York Stock Exchange, is also a member of the Pacific Coast
Stock Exchange, which is physically located in California.
Now, if Congress meant, physical location in section
6(c), it would lead to disunity in decision because there are
many stock exchange© located throughout the country which ar©
not in New York, and that would give a stock exchange moreover
the opportunity to physically locate itself in a state whose
laws are favorable to its policies and thereby effectively
emasculate the laws of 49 other states.
Q

You are suggesting that if the Pacific Coast

Exchange had a rule like the New York Stock Exchange does, it
couldn’t enforce it under Merrill Lynch’s theory, because it
is physically located in California?
MR. BARTON:
under one rational®.

Yes, I submit that would he correct
I believe that Congress intended by

location to mean the application of those laws of a state
which have significant

which have a significant interest in

the case, such as California in this case.

Q

Does the Pacific Coast. Stock Exchange have any

rules touching this area of relationship between

or the

termination of employment-of a registered customer's employer?
HR.BARTON;■ Your Honor, the Pacific Coast Stock
Exchange does have rules concerning arbitration which are very
similar to Article VIII, section 1 of the New York Stock
Exchange Constitution, which provides in essence that a member
-* Merrill Lynch in this case — cannot compel 'a non-member to
arbitrate.

That choice is given to the non-member, if he

willingly wishes to invoke arbitration.

And the rationale

behind that distinction is that obviously Morrill Lynch bas a
voice in the exchange rules which an employee does not have, so
they do not have equal bargaining strength.

Go they give the

non-member —
Q

An option?

MR. BARTON;
Q

— an option to request arbitration.

Do you think the federal courts should order

arbitration in a case like is now before ns if the employee
demands it?
MR. BARTON;
0

Under California law?

MR. BARTON;
Q

If the employee demands it, I would —

Excuse m®, Your Honor?

Under California law?

MR. BARTON;

Yes, 1 think that if the employee demand

it, that would be an exception to the application of —

23
Q

Of California law.

MR. BARTON:

—• a waiver of section 229 ox the

California Labor Code, yes, Your Honor„
Q

You have no difficulty with the waiving of a

provision that was made for his benefit in this context of tho
employer -erap 1 oy©e re la ti onships?
MR. BARTON:

Is Your Honor referring to the arbitra­

tion provisions?
Q

Yes.

MR. BARTON:

Well, Your Honor, it is not my opinion

that the arbitration clause or the rule was mad© for the bene?::»
of the employee but, rather, to benefit the members of the Hew
York Stock Exchange, because the employe© would foe compelled he
arbitrate before what I consider a less than impartial panel.
Q

Speaking of the California law, as you were

engaged in a colloquy with Mr. Justice Stewart, waiving the
benefits of California statute —
MR. BARTON;
Q

Can you waive that?

— you have no difficulty with his waiving that?

MR. BARTON:

Wall, Your Honor, there is a body of

decision that Indicates that an individual may not waive a
law enacted for his foanfit, that represents public policy/

1

would say that the California courts would have to consider in
a factual context whether or not —
Q

Then 1 misunderstood you, because 1 thought you

just fold Justice Stewart, xn response to

quastion,

could waive it.
MR. BARTON:

Well, the employee -could waive it, i'ovu

Honor, but whether the California courts would recognise that
waiver is a different question.

And X should also point out:

that Rule 34?(b) does conflict -Q

Well, 1 don't follow that.

If I react 229 cor­

rectly, what if says is that the individual may maintain an
action without regard to the existence of any private agreement
•to arbitrate.

Wow, if the employee didn't bother bringing an

action but, rather, submitted to arbitration, how would the
California courts aver get to it?
MR. BARTON:

In that context, Your Honor, they

wouldn’t 'unless the employer moves the court to compel the
matter not be arbitrated but go to court.

They would reach it

in that case.
Q

Well, after the arbitration was completed, the

employee might then make a collateral attack or other attack cn
the arbitration claim
MR. BARTON:

That is not permitted under California

law, Your Honor, if the employee —
Q

I said it couldn't get there any other way, it

might get there if ha brought such an action.
MR. BARTON:

In the courts, correct, Your Honor,,

the employee submitted to arbitration and the employer rejected

be in the position of
Tho issue would arise in

that context, and I guess it could also arise in the context
where both parties submitted to arbitration and then after the
arbitration award was made the employes, being dissatisfied
with it, would petition the courts«

But under that circum­

stance, Your Honor, the California courts would not consider
that objection, as 1 understand existing California law.
I should also —

One® he voluntarily goes to arbitration, he

can't take advantage of 229, is that correct?
MR. BARTON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

bound by it, since 229, as it states on its face, is not
compulsory.

It doesn’t say '’must,'' it says "may.”

MR. BARTON:
Q

»

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Mr. Barton, is this motion to arbitrate that the

petitioner filed in response to your complaint in the Superior
Court, is that an independent proceeding under California law,
or is it just a part of the defense raised to your claim for
wages?
MR. BARTON:

Your Honor, under California law, it

could bo. either an independent action or it could be part of a
law suit.

There are situations arising under California law

where you may go in to court on just a petition to arbitrate.

26
0

But that isn't what happened hare?

MR. BARTON:

That isn't what happened, no.

And actually the decision of the Court of Appeals

Q

isn't -a final disposition of this case, is it?
MR, BARTON:

Wall, Your Honor, undor accepted — we I"

under California law, no, it isn't.

It established the law of

the ease as far as the illegality of the forfeiture provision,
that is, the Court of Appeals indicated there are other issues
that remain to be decided by the trial court»
0

And if the California Court of Appeals disposition

were followed here, the case, would go back to the Superior Court
for trial to the court on, your client*» claim?
MR. BARTON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

However,

in all fairness, 1 should note that if the court consider
arbitration to be an outcome determinative, as was indicated in
the Bernhard decision, then that part of the California decision,
would be final.
I should also like to note, Your Honor, that if I
understood counsel’s opening argument, ha indicated that the
profit-sharing plan by virtue of Article 18.1, which is con­
tained on

which is noted at page 41 of the Appendix —-

specifically stated that the profit-sharing plan was not to be
construed as part of the employment contract.

And 1 submit

under that theory, then Rule 347(b) would have no application
in this case because it specifically relates to employment

27
disputes.

And by the functioning of Article 18.1, it would be

excluded from the application of Rule 347{b),
Now, concerning counsel*s statement that Respondents
have somehow been guilty of forum shopping, I submit: that that
is not accurate,

Now, each and every respondent is a citizen,

a resident of the State of California.

All they have done is

petition their own state courts for a decision regarding this
dispute.,

They have not sought to go outside their home state

to, for example, Nevada or Wyoming, to forum shop.

This is

not a case of forum shopping.
How, the policy of California is spelled out in
several cases.

California courts deem it a matter of important

strong public policy concerning the right of a wage earner to
all lawfully accrued wages, and in this context 1 would like to
note that although technically Merrill Lynch made all contribu­
tions to the profit-sharing plan, those contributions evolved
because of the work and labor of the employees who contributed
to the profit of Merrill Lynch.

And it is no different than

Merrill Lynch writing out a check to Hr. Ware or any other
respondent for their weekly wages, because profit sharing, even
as interpreted by a federal court, results because of a man's
labor and is not construed as a gift.
Now, the concern of the courts to avoid forfeitures
has been manifested I think most recently by the action of the
Senate in adopting and passing 8.R. 4200, which is the private

pension plan .bill.

And that statos ia no unequivocal t ; ..e5 the

to qualify under the Internal Revenue Code, a pension plan may
not contain a forfeiture provision.

It also provides that an

individual who works and is given retirement benefits c. :

erwy

those benefits from employer to employer.
Now, this is more or less a parallel to profit sharirt
It shows the great concern not only in the state courts but i;
Congress that a man not be deprived of his lawfully accrued
benefits, and that he be paid them.
Now, I submit
Q

You still don't have a stronger case than for -

contributory plan, do you?
MR. BARTONs
- 'if

■

Well, Your Honor, that is kind of a

•... •

theoretical question, because if David Ware and thv rest off tr.-a
Respondents didn't work and contribute to Merrill Lyv.ohJ c
profit, they wouldn't get paid anything.
Q

Well, Merrill Lynch probably feels this is a

gratuity on their part, it is something that builds up loyalty.
2 mean there are two sides to the issue.
MR, BARTON;
Your Honor.

That is correct.

I would agree to that,

1 do not make that distinction, though, between

contributing to -~
Q

Well, in any event, that really goes to the

merits of what would be tried in a court, if you're correct,,
or tried by an arbitrator, if your brother on the other side is

29

correct, doesn't it,?
HR. BARTONs
Q

It goes to the merits of the case?
That is correct, Your Honor.

There is no question, is there, but that —

isn't it conceded that these are wages, if that is what the
statute —
MR, BARTON;

That's correct, the Petitioner concades

that.
0

X didn't think there was any question.

HR. BARTON:
Q

There isn't, Your Honor.

Being tried on the merits, what is your idea of

the scope of the issues that will be covered?

Will they in­

clude, for example, any claim that there was a breach of the
fiduciary duty, when, you open?
MR. BARTON:

Well, Your Honor, I believe that Merrill

Lynch will mak<a such a claim.
Q

That is open, to bo tried cut, then?

MR. BARTON:

Yes, there is a breach of a fiduciary

duty.
Q

Taking customers lists and that sort of thing,

if they can establish that?
MR. BARTON;

That is correct, as against each indi­

vidual employe® or former employee.

That would fee one of the

issues that I believe the Court of Appeals in California left
open, so obviously Merrill Lynch’s rights were not prejudiced
by having a trial, one trial, I should note, Your Honor, that

30
would include everyone in the class and to decide at one time
and for all time what the respective rights of the parties are.
Now, on the opposite side of the coin, we have
Merrill Lynch suggesting that it would be more efficient and
effective to have 90, 100 or more separate arbitration hearing?.’to decide each case individually.

And, as the Court knows,

there is no principle such as stare decisis that binds arbitra­
tors.

A group of arbitrators could decide one case cue way,

could decide the next case the other way.

It is not a necessary

corollary of arbitration under the New York Stock Exchange PXas,
that one panel of arbitrators would adhere each and every one
of those cases.
Q

Is there any indication as to why your state

Court of Appeals changed its course by 180 degrees?
MR. BARTON:

Yes, there is, Your Honor.

When the

case was presented, Frame v. Merrill Lynch, the Labor Code,
section 229 argument was not made; neither was there an explica­
tion of the effectiveness of Rule 347(b) in relationship, for
example, to the New York Stock Exchange Constitution, Article
VIII.
Now, in the exhibits before this Court, after argument,
oral, argument before the Court of Appeals, the issue of Frame v.
Merrill Lynch came up.

Thereafter, the court sent a letter to

respective counsel, which is Exhibit D, requesting —

Of the Appendix?

31
MR. BARTON;

It: in not in the Appall?.,. Your Hcncr,

it is in the exhibits,
Q

All right.

MR. BAOTOiIs

It is Exhibit

D — requesting further

written argument regarding five separate points.
points was related to Labor Cod© section 229.

One ci: those

The court

specifically held in War© v. Morrill Lynch that the court Sic
net consider the application in Frame v. Merrill Lynch of
Labor Cod© section 229, and I think the court should be eovaraended for having the judicial courage to reverse what X con­
sidered an incorrect decision at the outset.

And I should

also note that under the class aspects of this case, that Mr.
Pram© I believe would be covered.
Q

Even though he lost?

MR, BARTON:
Your Honor.

Well, lie didn’t lose on the I'aerits,

All it said was that there should be arbitration,

and I believe —

Q

Well, that is on the merits of the issue that

is now before ns,
MR. BARTON%
Q

Right.

That is the issue, isn’t it?

MR. BARTONS

well, I should not© ~ that is the

issue, Your Honor, arbitration — I should not® that there was
extensive discussion between myself and Mr. Frame’s counsel
regarding his position before the argument on appeal, and there

32
was an invitation^: that time that was extended to him to join
in the class and, of course, we considered in great detail-what
position he was going to take on his briefs, which was differ­
ent from the position that 2 took on behalf of the class* in my
brief.
2 believe, Your Honor, in conclusion, that 1 would
like to note that 2 just feel that it is inconceivable that
Congress could have meant that New York law, which has no
significant context with California residents in this case,
should apply to the exclusion of the law of 49 other states,
many of which would have significant context as far as their
own residents are concerned, at least.
0

Well, that isn’t really the issue, is it?

Isn’t

the real issue whether this rule of the New York Stock Exchange
should apply, which incorporates or refers to New York law?

\V,,. *

*

But it la a rule of the New York Stock Exchange.
MR. BARTON:

That is correct, Your Honor, pursuant to

its rule-making authority granted under 6(c).
Q

Right.

MR. BARTON;

Right.

If there are no further questions, 1 would like to
thank the Court at this time for its attention.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Orrick?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H» ORRICK. ESQ.
MR. ORRICK;

Mr. Chief Justice —

33
Q

Mr, Orrick, at some point would you mind dealing

with the government's argument that, while 6(c), the language
of 6(c) ia very broad, any rule, it says, any rule —
MR. ORRXCK:
Q

That's right.

But I read the brief amicus of the Securities a

Exchange Commission ae saying, no, any rule should be limited
to rules related to investor protection, fair dealing or fair
exchange administration, 1 gather based on what they give us
in the way of legislative history of 6(c) and of the general
purposes of the Act.

And as 2 read their conclusion, it is

that any rule does not embrace 347(b)„
MR. ORRICK:

No, sir, and with that I take exception.

The legislative history of the Act is replete with discussions
of the efficiencies in employees of the securities industry,
both as to their competence and to their integrity, so even the
1964 special study mandated by Congress had similar references
\

to these deficiencies.

And indeed if the Court would look at

the agreements made by Mr. Ware and his colleagues —

and I

call attention to them, the -on® in question here, w ich is on
page 8 of the Appendix to our brief, it is subsection (J) of
Rule 345, and it reads in English as plain as it can be written,
”1 agree that any controversy between me and any member or
member organisation or affiliate or subsidiary thereof arising
out of my employment or the termination of my employment shall
be settled by arbitration at the instance of any such party in

accordance with the arbitration procedure prescribed in the
Constitution and rules then obtaining of the New York, stock
Exchange.“
And then if you read Mr. Ware's affidavit, which
appears in Volume I of the record, at page 171, and ha says,
"As far as 1 knew# this was nothing more than an application
for registration.

At no tine were the provisions contained ix

that form discussed with me-or explained to me, nor was I s~-,3r
provided with any sort of study guide referencing the provision;
before X signed it.

X did not understand.it to be a contract

or agreement of any type.”
1 suggest that this record itself is reason enough
for the Securities « Exchange Commission to regulate the con­
duct of employees.

Here are these employees who were dealing

with — giving financial advice to widows and orphans who will
say under oath that they don’t understand what they read and
back out on their agreements.
Q

Xs there anything in the record indicating

whether War© was also a member of the Pacific Coast Exchange as
a result of his employment with Merrill Lynch?
MR. ORRXCK;

I don’t recall that there is anything in

the record on that.
How, the position of Merrill Lynch is, first, we have
an agreement to arbitrate under a rule of the New York Stock
Exchange which is valid in the State of Haw York, and under 6(c)

35
that rule should be adhered to.

Whatever vanear th . SEC car-

put on the rule by saying that this in within oversight« the
purview of our oversight safely enforces the status of this
rule which we claim here has the —
Your whole case depends on 6(c), the language of

Q

5(c), rules and regulations- including 347 (b), doesn’t it?
MR. ORRICKi

The whole case — yesterday, X said

first we have a right to arbitration under the California
Arbitration Act, which is the same as the Federal Arbitration
Act,

We have a right to arbitration under these —
Q

But that is not a federal question, that is not
So far as your ease in this Court, ifc turns on

our problem.

your persuading us, does it not, that 6(c) covers 347(b)?
MR. ORRXCKs

Wall, 347(b) was enacted pursuant to the

saiae rules —
Q

That is the sans© regulation within 6(c), isn’t

it?
MR. ORR1CK:

Wall, X think it is also a rule and

regulation enacted pursuant to Article 111, section 6 of the
New York Stock Exchange, and is an equally valid, binding
agreement.

What we have here is an agreement to arbitrate.
Q

section 6?

Well, where is th© —• what is Article IX,
What is that?

MR. 0RR1CK:

Article III, section 6, I don't believe

that we have it printed, it is in th© Constitution of the Mew

36
York stock Exchange, which authorises the directors to make
such rules and regulations as are necessary.
Q

Well, isn't part of your argument -—“and it is

certainly related to the S(c) argument that the California
rule such that not an important objective of the federal la-s —
MR. ORRXCE;
Q

Exactly so, Mr. -Justice.

— wholly aside from 6(c), you would argue that?

MR. ORRXCK;

That's right, an important federal

policy.
Q

You don’t need to argue that except in connection

with 6(c), if you are right about it, 6.fa) automatically picks
it up.
MR. ORRXCK:

That is what X have been trying to

the rules are set out by itself.
Q

What about the important federal policy, is it

uniformity or is if a preference for arbitration?
MR. ORRXCK:

The New York Stock Exchange and the

securities industry has a federally mandated self-regulation.
In order to accomplish this self“regulation — and as Judge
Medina has indicated in the Coenen case — it is necessary, a
necessary element of it if it is to be able to enforce
arbitration.

And if you are unable to force the arbitration

with respect to a rule governing the conduct of employees in
one state, where* you ’can do it in another stat©, X think that
defies the very purpose of this federally mandated self-

37
regulation.
Q

Yet, if Bet* York ware to change its law tomorrow

so that its law would be the saraa as California’s, undor your
theory that arbitration ml® Couldn't be enforced anywhere.
HR. ORRICK:

Bo, to ha fair with the Court, I think

if New York had a rule like 229, we would have a different
case, and that is net our case hare, however.
Q

Well, so New York can set it not, this important

federal preference for arbitration under your own theory.
MR. ORRICK:
0

I would think that it could, yes.

If New York had a 229, then section 6(c) would

role out the arbitration provision of the New York Stock
Exchange because the only rules that the exchange may adopt are
rules and regulations not inconsistent with the applicable laws
of the state in which it is located.
MR. ORRICK:
Q

Well, that is —

So, If New York had a 229, that would nullify,

would it not, the arbitration provisions of 347(b)?
MR. ORRICK;
Q

That is correct.

But the commission itself required it by regula™

tion.
MR. ORRICK:

Right.

Thank you, Mr. Justice.

On© other point I want to make, Justice Rehriquist
asked Mr. Barton as to whether or not that California court
order is final.

It is indeed final as to Merrill Lync where

38
the petition to arbitrate is denied.

Q

Weil, this was something that you. jaisacl ae a

defense when you were brought Into court .by Mr. Barter'r oli-:'

It wasn’t a separate action that you bror.co..:- to

compel arbitration.
MR. ORRICK:

We filed in effect -- what v

did,• wo

filed an answer and we filed a petition to arbitrate, and the
court denied the petition to arbitrate, and that wan what way
on appeal.
With respect to the question that Justice Stewart
asked Mr. Barton as to whether or not section 229 was a part «
the Frame case, h© asked if there is any explanation for these
two diametrically opposite opinions.

Mr. Barton ooxraeily

said that it wasn’t discussed in the Frame case, but it »mj
briefed in the Frame case.
