MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 72-782 , Gateway Coal Company against United Mine
Workers.
Mr. Scheinholtz, I guess we can safely go ahead now.
You may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY LEONARD L. SCIIEINHOLTZ, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The primary issue in this Case is whether a Federal
Court, acting under Section 301 of the Labor Management
V

Relations Act of 1947 as amended has the authority to order
arbitration of an alleged safety dispute and to enjoin a
work stoppage which gave rise to that dispute.
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in a
2 to 1 decision vacated a preliminary injunction issued by
the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
The District Court acting on the complaint of Gateway Coal
Company had issued an order directing arbitration of a dispute
as to whether the Gateway Mine was rendered unsafe by reason
of the presence of two foreman in the Mine, had directed that
the foreman be suspended pending arbitration, and had issued
*

■*

an injunction preventing the Gateway employees from continuing
a work stoppage in furtherance of that dispute.

4
The sequence of events leading to the ristrict
Court's order began on April 15th of 1971 when shortly before
daylight it was reported and discovered that in one working
area of the Mine there was a reduction in airflow.

There was

still an adequate supply of air substantially above the Federal
and State minimum requirements.

No one had noticed any

difference in the methane level in the Mine, which was normally
2-10ths of 1 percent, substantially below the minimum
requirements of Federal Law of 1 percent.
detected every 20 minutes.

Methane is

There is a requirement of Federal

Law that the operators check for methane.

No one had noticed

any diminution or, rather, any increase in the methane level.
There are also methane monitors on the cutting machines which
are to detect changes of methane, and no one had noticed any
change in the methane level.
The problem was traced to a pattial blockage of an
intake airway, which is believed to have occurred at 4:30
a.m.

This resulted in a slight short circuiting of the airflow

in this working area of the Mine.

Repairs were made immediately

and the normal airflow was restored.
The miners who had reported to work on the first
shift, which begins at 8 a.m., were held on the surface until
the repairs were completed.

They were told to stand-by.

Iloweve

a number of them, approximately half the work force, left.
The remainder of the work force went in at about 10:30 in the

5

morning.

And the Mine worked without incident until the

following morning when the first shift employees reported
again.

At that time, when those who had left the Mine,

contrary to instructions, found out that they were not to
receive reporting pay, they struck.

They refused to arbitrate.

They struck.
Subsequently , the Union requested that the Federal
and State Safety Inspectors come in to inspect concerning
the adequacy of the repairs.
April 17th.

This was done on Saturday,

In the course of that inspection the Inspectors

discovered that the three third shift foremen had failed to
notice and detect the reduction in airflow which was caused
by the fall of an overcast, which is believed to have occurred
at 4:30 a.m.
Their pre-shift examination should have taken place
between 5:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. under Federal Law.
The following day on April 18th, the Union had a
special meeting.

And at that meeting the Union, attended by

approximately 200 of the 550 miners of the Gateway Mine —
the men voted not to work with the foremen.

By this time

the company, Gateway, had suspended two of the foremen.
However, the third foreman it had determined not to suspend
pending further investigation, because he was the one that had
reported the problem.
position.

They felt that he was in a different

6
However, the company reluctantly agreed to the Union's
demand to suspend all three foremen.

But the company President

advised the District President of the UMW that when there was
any basis to put the three foremen back to work, when the
State clarified their certification status, that he intended
to do so.

At that time he believed that action would be taken

to determine their certification status.

Under Pennsylvania

Law a foreman cannot work without being certified, and there
is a procedure for revocation of certification.
There was also a possibility — and it turned out
to be actuality — that the men would be subject to criminal
misdemeanor charges.
The men returned to work on April 19th and work
without incident until June 1st.

In the meantime, the

criminal misdemeanor charge was filed against the foremen,
and on April 29th, or, rather, May 29th, the company received
a letter from the Department of Environmental Resources advising
the company that it did not intend to revoke the certification
status of the miners or, rather, the three foremen, and that
the company was at liberty to return the foremen to work.
Acting on this letter which, as I indicated, went
to the Union with a copy to the company, the company reinstated
the two foremen.

One had retired in the mean time on June 1st.

And upon the act of the company in returning the foremen to
work, the Union struck, took unilateral action and struck.

7
Q

Whatever happened to those criminal charges, Mr.

Scheinholtz?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

About six weeks later the three

foremen pleaded nolo contendere and they v/ere finded, I
believe, $200 a piece.

Nothing was ever done with respect

to the certification status of the active foremen, because
the Department of Environmental Resources decided that the
criminal processes were an adequate method of resolving the
problem.
Q
strike?

What is the company's position with respect to the
That is, the reason for it.

Was it the reinstatement

of the foremen or was it the earlier company position not
to allow pay?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
reporting pay issue.

The dispute had it origins in the

The strike that started on April 17th

started before there was any — or, rather, on April 16th,
started before there was any knowledge of any problem with
respect to the foremen's logs.

However, after the strike

started initially over this reporting pay disoute, it was
converted into a safety dispute or an alleged safety dispute
by the Union.
Our position is that the dispute as to whether the
Mine was rendered unsafe by the foremen is clearly one which
is subject to resolution under the Collective Bargaining
Agreement between Gateway and the UMW,

This Collective

8
Bargaining Agreement contains a very broad grievance arbitration
clause.

It would be difficult to write a broader grievance

arbitration procedure.

The contract states that the parties

will submit to the settlement of local and district disputes
procedures, all disputes between them as to the meaning and
application of the agreement, all other local matters, and
any local trouble of any kind arising at the Mine.
Q

May I ask, Mr. Scheinholtz, would the fact of the pleas

of non vult be relevant in any arbitration proceeding?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
Q

Would that be relevant?

Yes.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

yes, Justice Brennen.

I believe that it'might be relevantr

I think this is something which an

arbitrator could and I believe in this case did take into
account.
Q

And would you mind stating again, what is the

connection between the certification proceeding and the pleas
of non vult, the nolo?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

The distinction is this, under

Pennsylvania Law a man cannot serve as a foreman unless he is
certified by the State.

There is a specific period of experience

he must have in the mine, there is a certain training that he
must have before he can achieve certification status.

There

is also a procedure under Pennsylvania Law for revocation of
that status and if his license to practice as a supervisor in

9
mine is revoked, then it is a little bit like a driver’s
license, he cannot drive»
Q

And the certification is not revoked merely because

of the pleas?
*

MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
record.

No, no.

That is clear in the

There maybe times when a revocation will result from

a finding of a criminal violation.

But this is by no means

automatic,
Q

It is an independent proceeding —
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

Completely independent proceeding.

The one is in the Court, and the other is an Administrative
Proceeding initially with the Department of Environmental
Resources.
The District Court in enjoining the work stoppage,
as I say, directed arbitration of this dispute, which was
whether the Mine was

rendered unsafe by reason of the

presence of the foremen in the Mine.

And he directed that

the foremen be suspended until the arbitration was held and
that if the arbitrators sustained the company's position, that
the foremen be returned to work.

If the arbitrator found

against the company, then they would not be returned to work,
which I think was a very sensible solution under the
circumstances.

The case was heard by an arbitrator.

He found

in agreement with the District Court that the dispute was
arbitrable.

It was the first issue that the Union presented

10

to them.

They challenged the arbitrability.

He found that

it was arbitrable.
Secondly, he found that the decision of the Gateway
Miners to refuse to work with the foremen was unfounded, and
he also found that the Mine was not rendered unsafe by reason
of the presence of the foremen in the Mine.
However, when the case got to the Court of Appeals,
which was after the arbitrator's decision, the majority of
the Court ruled that the dispute was not arbitrable.

The

conclusion of the Court was that safely disputes are sui
generis, and by virtue of their being sui generis, that the
ordinary presumption of arbitrability of disputes, as set forth
in 203D of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 and
as stated in Warrior & Gulf and the other cases in the
Steelworkers Trilogy, did not apply to a dispute regarding
safety.
The majority found support for that position, it
said, in Section 502 of the Act.
Q

The majority did not say that the arbitration clause

did not cover this dispute.
MR. SCHEINHOLT2:

It said it was unenforceable.
It said that the arbitration

clause did not expressly provide unambiguously provide that
safety disputes were to be arbitrated.

That is the way the

Court handled —
Q

Would that have made any difference under the Court's

11
reasoning?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

Actually X do not believe that

it would, because in Footnote 1 —
Q

It is not much of a case if all you have to do is

to include in the arbitration provision "including safety
disuputes.”
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

Well, Your Honor, if you said that,

then you would have a problem with seniority disputes.

Here

you have got a broad, overall, all encompassing arbitration
clause.
Q

I sort of had the impression that Justice Brennan

indicated, the Third Circuit would have come out the same
way —
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
Q

Yes, it would.

In Footnote 1 —

It purported to leave the question entirely open

in the Footnote.

In the second paragraph of Footnote 1 on
?

page 18A of the Petition for Writ Assertuary

it says,

"It is alB© unnecessary to decide whether in the unlikely
clause of a contract” -- well, you know what it says.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
not expressly decide it.

Yes.

Certainly the Court did

I think that it left no doubt and

in view of its holding that safety disputes are sue generis
by their nature, it seems likely to me in reading Footnote
1 that even if this contract had specifically provided for
arbitration of safety disputes, that this majority, with

12
Judge Rosen dissenting, would have concluded that the promise
to arbitrate safety disputes was unenforceable.
Q

How can you say that when the opinion of Judge

Hastey explicitely and expressly says it is unnecessary to
decide that question?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

The very tenure of his Footnote

— in the unlikely event that a safety dispute, that the
agreement to arbitrate included safety disputes — I think
that coupled with his reasoning in reaching the

conclusion

that he did would justify an assumption that even if this
contract had specifically provided for arbitration

of safety

disputes, that the majority of the Third Circuit, that majority,
would have ruled that promise unenforceable.
Q

Did he not at any rate apply a much stricter standard

in determining whether a general arbitration clause embraced
a safety matter than has been customarily applied by Courts
in determining whether a general clause pertains to a
particular matter?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
question.

Yes, I do not think there is any

In effect, Judge Hastey created what I would call

a presumption of non-arbitrability, which is exactly the
antithesis of 203D and 301 as interpreted by this Court.
There is nothing in Section 502 that deals with
arbitration of safety disputes.
deal with that issue.

It just does not purport to

And consequently there is nothing in

13
502 which requires the result which Judge Ilastey came to.
It seems clear to us that the sui generis approach of Judge
Ilastey certainly nullifies the ordinary presumption in favor
of arbitrability and the intent of Congress that all disputes ,
of whatever kind, arising out of a Collective Bargaining
Agreement should be resolved by peaceful means by the method
that the parties chose.

And in this case the parties

arbitration as the terminal point or terminal procedure for
resolving those disputes.

I think that there is good reason

for that, because a mine is not rendered anymore safe if
Gateway were to have starved these people into submission.
Assuming that there was a bonafide safety problem, for the
sake of argument, here you have got a test of wills.

If the

Union goes out on strike, maybe it can force the company to
change its position, but maybe it cannot.
But the point is that if it cannot, that if the
Gateway had starved these people into submission, that would
not have made the Mine any safer or any less safe.
not have changed the underlying circumstances.

It would

The only way

that those underlying circumstances can be corrected , if there
is need for correction, is by some third party determination.
Under the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act there is
a provision for on site inspection by the Federal Mine
Inspectors.

They make a third party determination when they

decide whether there is an imminent danger which requires

14
withdrawal of the men from the mine.
The Labor Board under Section 502, and ultimately
the Court of Appeals — it makes a determination of the
bonafidedness of a claim of abnormally dangerous conditions
when 502 was brought into play.

So that there are many times

when third parties make these decisions, and it is the only
intelligent way to approach it.
Q

Self help is not the answer.

Did the Court of Appeals consider what I read to

be the basic argument in the Respondents' Brief, that is,
the argument that the Collective Bargaining Agreement itself
expressly under Subsection E of the Mine Safety Program
expressly permits miners to walk out?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

It did in this way — first, let

me answer the question somewhat differently.

First, there

is no evidence that the procedures of the Mine Safety Program
were ever utilized by the Gateway miners.

And the District

Court so held.
Q

That is what you say in your reply brief.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

Secondly, if you read the Mine

Safety Program, it does not permit as the Union contends that
the miners have the right to engage in a safety strike anytime
that they believe that a dangerous condition exists.

That

is not what the Mine Safety Program provision says.
Q

I know.

And you are repeating now very clearly what

you say in your reply brief.

My question was, Did the Court

15

of Appeals consider that argument?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ.;
Q

Yes.

Was it made to the Court of Appeals?
*

MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

In this context, it said that

here you are faced with a general arbitration clause which
is vague or general.
Safety Program,

You are faced with a specific Mine

And consequently the Court interpreted the

Mine Safety Program to mean that safety disputes were not
• ■

arbitrable.

But that is the very function of an arbitrator,

not the Court.

The function of the Court is simply to

uecermine whether on its face the claim is subject to
resolution under the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

Here

the District Court made that kind of analysis, ruled that
the dispute over the foremen was subject to resolution on
its face subject to resolution under the Grievance Arbitration
Clause.

And the arbitrator ruled that the dispute was

arbitrable too.
In effect, what Judge Hastey did was to nullify
that arbitrator's decision by interpreting the clause on
the merits to preclude arbitration of all safety disputes.
I think that that was improper.
Q

Was that clause of the contract brought to the

attention of the arbitrator?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
in Appendix G —

Yes, yes.

As a matter of fact,

16
Q

Appendix G of what?

?
HR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

To the Petition for Writ Assertoty,

the umpire's award, and there is the coiitentions of the parties
with respect to these matters are set forth in Appendix G.
It would be on 43A is where the Union's contention on that
subject is and also on 44A.
Essentially the same argument was made to the
arbitrator as was made in this Court; that is, that the Mine
Safety Program Provision operates in such a way as to preclude
arbitration of safety disputes.

The arbitrator decided that

that was incorrect.
Q

Mr. Scheinholtz, may I ask, you suggested that 502

or something under 502 might have been cognizable by the
National Labor Relations Board.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
Q

Yes.

How does that come about?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

It comes about — Section 502

provides that the quitting of labor by an employee or employees
in good faith because of abnormal conditions at the place of
-e» plyment shall not be deemed a strike under the act.
Q

Could the company have initiated an unfair labor

practice proceeding?
MR. SC1IIENHOLTZ:

No.

company discharges employees.

It comes up this way, the
They assert 502 as the dissents

for their engaging in a refusal to work.

And then they file

17
an 8A1, 8A3 charge, and it cones up in the 8A1, 8A3 context.
At that point the Labor Board must decide as it did, for
example, in Redwine Carriers , which we have cited in our
brief, and other cases, whether the activity of the employees
was protected under 502.

If so, then the discharge and

discipline violates Section 8A1 and/or 3.
Q

But the company could not —
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

Q

— itself initiate it?
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

Q

No.

No, it comes up the reverse way.

I suppose you would agree that if a factory building

were burning and the foreman ordered everybody to go in the
factory building and haul some machinery out, that that would
not be a strike.
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

No, we would agree with that.

We would agree with that, and that is not this case.
Q

I was deliberately picking an extreme case.

That

is probably what the provision was meant for.
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:
Q

That is right.

That is right.

On the other hand, if a mine was filled with gas,

fumes, or arguably so filled, creating an immediate danger
situation, that would be comparable to the burning building,
would it not?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
true.

It would if in fact this were

Under those circumstances you would have something far

13
different from what we had here.

And 1 think that is the

problem here, is that the Court of Appeals constructed a
subjective test rather than an objective test in interpreting
502.

That is one of the basic problems with this case.

They

said that if these men believe that a safety hazard exists,
that belief is unreviewable by Court.
502 says.

And that is not what

That is not the way any other Court of Appeals has

ever interpreted Section 502.

That is not the way the Labor

Board has interpreted 502, and I think the Labor Board's
interpretation of the statute is entitled to considerable
deference.
Q

Would you arque that wholly aside from the arbitration

provision this strike was enjoinable by reason of the Union's
failure to follow the safety provisions of the contract?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
Q

No.

They did not, did they?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

They did not utilize the Mine

Safety Program Provisions.
Q

And they did strike?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

They did strike.

And we say that

even if the dispute was over the foremen — and, as I indicated,
there is at least a serious question as to whether it was.
Q

The safety provision would say you may be ordered off

the job in the area where the dangerous safety condition
exists.

19
MR. SCHEINIIOLTZ:
Q

Only in the unsafe area.

And that all employees walked off.
MR. SCIIEINHOLTZ:

All employees, both above and below

ground —
Q

Where these two foremen had no authority whatsoever.
MR. SCHEINIIOLTZ:

Absolutely not.

They struck from

the coal tipple to the preparation plant, both of which were
above ground.
Q

Tell me why you would not make that argument about

the enjoinability of this strike?
MR. SCHEINIIOLTZ:

Because we do not have to.

We

have a far stronger ground.
Q

But part of the case against you is that the provision

against the arbitration should not apply because there is
another provision in the contract governing the situation.
MR. SCHEINIIOLTZ:

If you look at it in that light,

we would have an additional basis for our position.

But

the other basis is so clear that we did not feel we had to
fall back on that position.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH A. YABLONSKI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. YABLONSKI:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

20

I am somewhat appalled that Counsel has indicated
to this Court precisely what he thinks about Norris-La Guardia.
Throughout 25 minutes of argument Counsel has failed to even
mention the words Norris-La Guardia Act.

The question before

this Court is whether your decision in Boys Markets should
be extended to cover a safety dispute at a coal mine.
This Court carved out in the words of Hr. Justice
Brennan a very limited exception to the Norris-La Guardia Act.
Counsel has failed to even mention the words Norris-La Guardia
Act, the basic charter, the Magna Carta of American Labor.
What we have in this case is the coal industry,
particularly the Gateway Mine.

Not once in Counsel's argument

has he mentioned the fact that Gateway Mine is classified by
the United States Bureau of Mines as an especially hazardous
coal mine.
Not once has he mentioned the fact that at that
mine there is liberated daily 4 million cubic feet of deadly
methane gas.
Nor does Counsel mention that at the Gateway Mine
it is one of the largest underground mining complexes in the
United States.

That the failure of these foremen interrupted

the airflow to the five face area of that mine.
Counsel has said here that there are regular
requirements in the five face area, regular ventilation
requirements or 28,000 cubic feet per minute at the last open

21
cross cut.

The Federal minimum ventilation standard is

9,000 cubic feet per minute.
is 6,000 cubic feet.

And the State minimum standard

It gives Your Honors some idea of the

gassy nature of this mine.

The Federal Bureau of Mines was

requiring them to pump three times the minimum amount of air
into that section.
The law requires — the 1969 Coal Mine Health and
Safety Act — requires foremen that are working on the shift
to protect the safety of the men coming into the mine, to
make a pre-shift examination.

That inspection must be carried

out within three hours prior to the commencement of that
shift.
Q

Is that done, Mr. Yablonski, with equipment or

is that done with —
MR. YABLONSKI:

That is with an anomometer, Your

Honor.
That inspection should have been conducted on
April 15th between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.
These foremen purportedly made that test, and logged into
their log books 28,000 cubic feet.
The record in this case conclusively demonstrates
that this overcast fell around 4:00 a.m. in the morning.
Counsel would now seem to be arguing here, contesting that
>

matter.

♦*v

lie did not argue it in the District Court, because

there was a water gauge on the main fan of that mine.

And

22

when that resistance was created when that overcast fell, it
showed up on that water gauge.
It is conclusively established in this record that
that overcast fell and that it fell before the foremen were
required to make their pre-shift examination, including the
testing for ventilation.
Counsel has not said that the Boys Markets case
decided by this Court involved an economic dispute.

The

question before this Court, as you recall was whether or not
supervisors were performing bargaining unit work by stocking
shelves in a supermarket in California.

I submit to Your

Honors that that is not the case here.
The case here involves coal miners — in the words
of Judge Hastey, "Men in an industry which is dangerous at
best."

This mine classified by the Federal Bureau of Mines

is especially hazardous.

Counsel does not say that in the

Boys Marketsccase it was admitted before this Court that the
grievance should have been submitted to arbitration.

Here is

there is a very serious dispute that has started in the District
Court and still exists here, that safety disputes are not
arbitrable under the 1968 Coal Wage Agreement.
Q

In what status does this case come here?

Has there

been a final decision in the case?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Preliminary injunction entered by

the District Court, Your Honor

23
Q

Air . affirmance?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Q

A reversal.

A reversal, yes.
MR. YABLONSKI:

A reversal by the United States

Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
Q

So, you were defending the preliminary injunction?
MR. YABLONSKI:

No, we were not defending, Your

Honor, —
Q

Did not the preliminary injunction forbid these

forement to go back to work?
MR. YABLONSKI:

It also ordered us. Your Honor, to

submit the matter to arbitration.
Q

And it was in fact arbitrated?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Q

In the meantime?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Q

Yes, it was.

It was arbitrated.

But without the foremen being at work?
MR. YABLONSKI;

The foremen were not at work.

The

foremen were returned to work.
Q

After reversal?
MR. YABLONSKI:

No, they were returned to work,

Your Honor, after the arbitrator ruled that they could be
returned to work.
Q

Because that is what the injunction —
MR, YABLONSKI:

That is what Judge McCune's decision

24
permitted.
Q

You were ordered to go to arbitration by the District

Court?
MR. YABLONSKI:

We were ordered to go to arbitration

by the District Court.
Q

You went to arbitration without at that point

challenging the validity of the order upon you to go to
arbitration?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Your Honor, we had Judge McCune's

order in the Court of Appeals at that time.
Q

But you did not get a stay?
MR. YABLONSKI:

We did not get a stay.

Q

That is the problem.

Q

Did you ask for it?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Q

Yes, we did.

In what way?
MR. YABLONSKI:

We asked for a stay, I believe,

Your Honor, after the umpire's decision came down.

We sought

in the alternative before Judge McCune.
Q

I gather that what your basic argument is is that

this is not an arbitrable dispute because the contract itself
did not make it arbitrable?
MR. YABLONSKI:
Q

Precisely, Your Honor.

And yet you did go to arbitration.
MR. YABLONSKI:

Why?

We went to arbitration, Your Honor,

25
because Judge McCune required us to arbitrate within 60
days this issue.
Q

We did not want to go to arbitration.

Why did you not take his order on appeal?
MR. YARLONSKI:

Q

We did appeal Judge McCune's order.

You did not get a stay?
MR. YABLONSKI:

We asked for a stay after the

arbitrator had ruled, Your Honor.

We sought a stay of the

return of the men, of the foremen, to the mine; or, in lieu
thereof, we sought a five million dollar bond.
Q

Yet nevertheless appealing the basic determination

MR. YABLONSKI:

We contested throughout, Your Honor,

that safety disputes were not arbitrable.

We resisted the

submission of these matters to arbitration.
Q

When you say safety disputes were not arbitrable,

you do not mean vel non; you mean under this agreement they
were not?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Under this agreement, precisely.

Your Honor has hit the nail precisely on the head.

What is

involved here is a construction of the 1968 Agreement.
Q

You have already taken the position that this is

a contract case; it is not a 502 case in anyway?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Precisely.

case on this score is rather clear.

And the record in this
The President of our

District Four testified that safety disputes had not been

26
arbitrated under the '68 Wage Agreement.

The company's own

President, Gateway's own President, testified that Gateway
had never arbitrated a case.

He could not speak for the rest

of the coal industry , but he testified that Gateway had never
arbitrated a safety case.
The record in this case, the evidence presented to
the District Court, I think rather conclusively establishes
that.
Q

The original general agreement with the industry,

did you get back into the history of that?
MR. YABLONSKI:
Q

I have not yet, Your Honor.

I mean, in the record?
MR. YABLONSKI:

No, we did not.

We believe with

respect to the Petitioner's contention that these matters are
not in the record.

We believe that they are in the public

record and they maybe observed by this Court.
The Centralia hearings, which were conducted in
1947 — incidentally, those hearing were being conducted in
the House and the Senate at the very same time that both the
House and the Senate were considering Taft-Hartley.
Q

Mr Yablonski, before you get into that, let me

ask you one more question about this stay and District Court
order business.
Did the District Court's injunction order you to do
anything more than arbitrate?

27
MR, YABLONSKI:

It ordered us to submit the matter

to arbitration and ordered the strike terminated# Your Honor.
Q

Well# then# why do you wait to seek a stay in the

Court of Appeals until you have actually gone to arbitration?
I mean# is not that aspect pretty well mute by then?
MR. YABLONSKI:

At that particular point in time

the foremen had not been returned to work.

We did not have,

at least in my view at that point# the kind of persusive
argument that we could make after the foremen were ordered
back.

A Court might say you are premature in coming in here

and asking for a stay.

We do not know that an arbitrator might

say that the mine will be rendered unsafe.

We waited until

the arbitrator’s award came down and the foremen were to go
to work.

Then we felt we had a right issue to take before

a Court and to ask for a stay.
Q

And you were refused?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Q

We sought it and we were denied it.

By the Court of Appeals?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Your Honor, I honestly cannot say

that we applied to the Court of Appeals.
mistaken# I believe we did.

If I am not

I can recall arguing the matter

before the District Court.
Q

The Court of Appeals agreed with you.
MR. YABLONSKI:

The Court of Appeals agreed with

us and we sought before the Third Circuit# Your Honor,

28

expeditious oral argument under the Norris-La Guardia Act,
and it was granted.
Q

But you do not know whether you asked them before

that for a stay?
MR. YABLONSKI:

No, I cannot recall, Your Honor,

whether in this record we had asked the Court of Appeals for
a stay.
Q

I gather the complete record is here, Mr. Yablonski,

if even if not printed?
MR. YABLONSKI:

I would assume that it is, Your

Honor.
Q

Mr. Yablonski, one other question.

do not know your Pennsylvania system.

I, of course,

But is there anything

out of line between the continued certification of the foremen
and their being subject to criminal charges and ultimately
pleading nolo?
MR. YABLONSKI:
procedures.

There is no dove-tailing of these

I think Counsel for the Petitioner has indicated,

Mr. Justice Blackmum, that one is an administrative proceeding
and the other is a regular routine criminal proceeding.
Q

But does it surprise you that they can go off in

different directions this
MR. YABLONSKI:

way?
Well, Your Honor, nothing surprises

me after I had Petitioner's President on the stand in terms
of the administrative procedure.

Petitioner's President

29
conceded under cross-examination that he had spoken with
the man who was responsible for conducting decertification
proceedings and had informed him that Gateway was suffering
a foremen shortage.

All of this predated the letter that

was sent to Gateway saying, "You can send these foremen back
to work."
Given that ex parte communication between Gateway
and the Administrative Agency, Your Honor, nothing would
surprise me.
Q

Mr. Yablonski, when you appeared before the

arbitrator, did you make something in the nature of a special
appearance protesting contact —
MR. YABLONSKI:
counsel can appear.

Your Honor, I did not appear.

No

And it is very unfortunate that under

our arbitration system, which Judge McCune ruled — we
believe incorrectly so — counsel are not permitted to appear
at any stage of the arbitration process.
Q

The umpire maybe a counsel, I guess.
MR. YABLONSlvI:

Yes, the umpire or arbitrator can

be counsel.
Q

Bid the Union make a record of proceeding under

protest, challenging the contract?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Yes, I think at the very outset of

those proceedings the Union contested it.
the arbitrator found.

Counsel says that

did was simply follow Judge McCune's decision.
decision is before you, it is before this Court.

The arbitrator’s
It is

before this Court despite the fact that Counsel sought to
submit it to the Court of Appeals.

The Court of Appeals

struck it from the record.
Q

I gather that what we have here in Appendix G is

the arbitrator’s — at least beginning at page 40 — is that
the arbitrator's opinion?
MR. YABLONSKI:
Q

That is correct, Your Honor.

I notice at page 44A under the subhead Safety, it

starts out, "The Union's position in this hearing and also
in Federal Court is that Safety is not an arbitrable issue."
Is that what —
MR. YABLONSKI:

Yes, Your Honor, and I think the

next sentence indicates that he was fairly following Judge
McCune's order submitting this matter.
i

Q

.

:

Whatever, this indicates that the Union did protest

that it was not arbitrable.
MR. YABLONSKI:

Yes, it did.

I would also direct

Your Honor's attention to page 38A of the Appendix submitted
at the time the briefs were submitted, and it is in the little
brown book.

Page 38A, the Petitioner sought when it was a

party'before the Court of Appeals to submit the arbitrator's
decision.

And as a supplemental Appendix, page 38A reveals

that the Court of Appeals, an order signed by Judge Kalodner

31
3truck

from the record the arbitrator's decision.

It

nonetheless appears in the Appendix to the Petition.
Q

Do the Petitioners make the argument that even if

it was not in the record there, it was in the Public Record?
MR. YABLONSKI:

No, I do not believe that this

opinion was ever published anywhere, Your Honor.
A question was raised, Mr. Justice Blackmun, regarding
this being a serious safety case, that this was in reality
a reporting pay case.

This was adopted by Judge Rosen, in

all candor; and it is repeated here by the Petitioner and
by amici in support, in support of the Petitioner's position.
In point of fact, Counsel has admitted that the reporting
pay dispute occurred on April 16th.

The strike which resulted

in the commencement of this litigation occurred a month and
a half later.

It appears to me that if there is a red herring

in this case, if there is a pretext being argued by any
party, it is not by the Respondents but by the Petitioner.
The Petitioner has dragged in this reporting pay.
In the Appendix in this case the complaint at page
7 of the Appendix in paragraph 10 in the Complaint, the
♦

Petitioner when it filed its complaint in Court said, "The
employee members of the defendants have notified Plaintiff
that the illegal work stoppage occurred because defendant
Local No. 6330 had passed a resolution that its employee
members would not work with certain assistant mine foremen

32
designated and assigned by Plaintiff to act as supervisors
at Gateway.”
In their own verified complaint they stated exactly
what we are asserting right now.

They seemed to have abandoned

it.
In addition to this disjointed time frame that they
present to Your Honors, all of a sudden a work stoppage
occurred a month and a half later after the reporting pay
dispute occurred and coincidentally exactly at the same time
these foremen were returned to their position; they would have
Your Honors believe that they lost their holiday pay.

The

company reinstated these foremen on the day following a
holiday, a day the coal miners were required to work if they
were to collect their holiday pay.

They would have you

believe that the miners forfeited their entire holiday pay,
forfeited two weeks work following that, some $296,000 in
lost wages because of a dispute involving perhaps a hundred
men over four hours reporting pay.
I repeat if there is a red herring, if there is a
pretext in this case, we are not asserting it.

They is the

Petitioner that is asserting it.
Basically, what is involved here is the construction
of the 1963 Agreement,
10 of the Appendix.

The relevant provisions begin at page

The settlement of local and district

disputes appears at page 13.

It is a broad grievance procedure.

33
We do not deny that.

The Petitioner would appear to assert

that if there are no limitations appearing in the settlement
of local and district disputes, then there are none.

And

that is where we differ.
Petitioner acknowledges the fact that National
disputes cure carved out in another section of this agreement
and are outside the grievance procedure.
page 15A.

That appears at

What we are submitting is that mine safety disputes

Are carved out and made a separate part, separate procedure.
Under the Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement, two
committees are recognized at the mines.
Q

May I ask you, Mr. Yablonski, that which carves it

out, safety matters, are they the provisions at page 12A and
13A?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Yes, Your Honor, they begin at

page 10A, the Mine Safety Program, a rather comprehensive
program, and runs to the middle part of 13A.
Q

And that all precedes the provision on settlement

of local and district disputes in the text of the contract?
MR. YABLONSKI:
Q

Yes, I believe it does. Your Honor.

Of course, as you said it is awfully broad language,

is it not, at 13A, "..,or should any local trouble of any
kind arise at the mine."
MR. YABLONSKI:

We acknowledge that, Your Honor.

We say that looking at the agreement, looking at the

34
establishment of two separate committees at the mine, you will
note in the settlement of local and district disputes at the
second step of the grievance procedure, the dispute is between
the mine management and the mine committee, referred to as
the pit committee at many

:mines.

The pit committee or the

mine committee handles grievances.
handles safety.

The safety committee

When this agreement was set up at the local

union level, grievances were handled by the mine committee,
safety disputes were handled by the safety committee.
You can construe a contract in many different ways.
Look at the four corners of the agreement.
relationship of the provisions.

Look at the inter­

Directing your attention to

the bottom of page 12A of the Appendix, it talkes about what
can occur if the safety committee declares an imminent danger
to exist in a section of the mine or in the entire mine.
"If the safety committee in closing down an unsafe
area acts arbitrarily and capriciously, members of such
committee maybe removed from the committee.

Grievances that

may arise as a result of a request for removal of a member
of the safety committee under this section shall be handled
in accordance with the provisions providing for settlement of
disputes."
We submit that the parties including that last
sentence in there, meant to say that everything else, impliedly,
everything else in the mine safety program that precedes that,

35
is exempt and outside of the arbitration provisions.
Q

Who is it that removes members of the committee

who act arbitrarily and capriciously?
MR. YABLONSKI:

The local union.

The'company requests

that that be done.
Q

But if the union refuses it, then it goes to

arbitration?
MR. YABLONSKI:
Q

Yes.

And the issue at stake then is whether the committee

acted arbitrarily or capriciously?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Right, for which they may only be

removed from their office.
Q

But do these provisions contemplate that in addition

to carrying out the procedures of the Mine Safety Provisions
—- should the union also strike while these provisions are
going on?
MR. YABLONSKI:

I think the contract. Your Honor,

contemplates a work stoppage.
Q

I thought these provisions themselves say only if

the mine committee determines that a section of the mine is
unsafe will employees be removed from that section?
MR. YABLONSKI:
Q

That is right.

Or should the union before that determination is

made walk out?
MR. YABLONSKI:

No, Your Honor.

And that is a

36

question that Counsel has raised, and I am happy you raised it.
Here we did comply with the provisions of the Safety
Procedure.

We requested an inspection to be made of that

mine by Federal and State Mine Inspectors.
Committee men accompanied them on that trip.

The Mine Safety
They reported

to the local union the grievous violations that had been
committed, the logging of improper entries, the falsification
of entries by these foremen.

The supported a resolution

brought before the entire membership that they would not work
with these foremen.

And all of this was communicated through

management.
Q

Did the Mine Safety Committee act?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Yes, Your Honor, the Mine Safety

Committee did act.
Q

What did it say?
MR. YABLONSKI:

It made the tour.

the membership of the local union.

It reported to

And the local union, in

the words of Judge Hastey, acting as a committee of the whole,
declared that none of its members —
Q

Did it do this, Mr. Yablonski, in those special

instances where the committee believes an immediate danger
exists and the committee recommends that management remove
all mine workers from the unsafe area, the operator is required
to follow the recommendations of the committee?
MR. YABLONSKI:

It did with the local union as a

37
buffer between the committee and the mine operator.

It added

that.
Q

And this is the basic language upon which you rely?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Q

That sentence that was read by my Brother Brennan?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Q

Yes, it is, precisely, Your Honor.

Yes, it is.

I take it before the arbitrator you said that

whether not the committee acted arbitrarily was an issued
opened to arbitration.
said:

I take it that is what the arbitrator

;"The Union states that it feels the only issue which

can be arbitrated in this hearing is whether or not the
Safety Committee acted arbitrarily and capriciously."
MR. YABLONSKI:

That is the only thing under the

contract —
Q

Your position, nevertheless, is that even though

the management challenges the action of the Committee and
claims it is arbitrary and capricious and therefore the
issue becomes arbitrable, you claim that the Union may strike
pending that determination of whether the Safety Committee
acted arbitrarily or capriciously?
MR. YABLONSKI:

There is nothing, Your Honor,

in the contract or anywhere else that —
Q

What about Boys Markets?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Your Honor.

That is precisely the question,

38
Q

That issue of arbitrariness or capriciously of

the Committee is arbitrable?
MR. YABLONSKI:
Q

Yes, it is.

And pending that arbitration, you claim that Boys

Markets does not prevent a strike?
MR. YABLONSKI:

What I am claiming, Your Honor, is

that pending that decision, the contract gives these men
that right.
Q

As I remember it, some years now, Mr. Yablonski,

I wrote Benedict Coal, and I think, as I recall it, the
National Agreement had no strike provision in it at all, did
it?

And we divided equally, as I remember it.

I think Justice

Stewart then was Judge Stewart, as I recall it, on the Sixth
Circuit.
Q

Yes, because I had written Benedict Coal before

Justice Brennan wrote Benedict Coal.

I had done it as a

Circuit Judge.

And Mr. Chief Justice Burger wrote

Court and the Court of Appeals.

The Court of Appeals never

Q

Do you think that when there is a promise to arbitrate,

39

does it make any difference whether the contract has a no
strike clause in it?
MR. YABLONSKI:
Q

We raised and litigated the question.

Did not Boys Markets sort of settle that?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Your Honor, in Boys Markets there

was an express no strike clause.
Q

Here there is none.

We also held before — was it Lucas Flour or Dowd

i

exists a split in-» the Circuits.
is a question before this Court.

We do not believe that that
We think that it is a

contract question.
Q

Do you think it is a Norris-La Guardia question?
MR. YABLONSKI:

Yes, we do, Your Honor, because

this Court said in Boys Markets — Mr. Justice Brennen's
language was that you created, you carved out a very limited
exception.
Judge Hastey's decision is supported by Section 502
in terms of public policy.

It is supported by the 1969

Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act.

It is supported

by the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970.

It is

supported by the common law of the shop that has emanated
in arbitration after arbitration since seminal decision of
Harry Schulman in the Ford Motor Company Case as far back

40

as 1944.
All of these, we believe support Judge JIastey's
conclusion that safety disputes are sui generis.
In conclusion, in dealing with Norris-La Guardia,
Your Honors, and Boys Markets, this Court said in Boys Markets
that you did not — I am quoting — undermine the vitality of
Norris-La Guardia.

You said that it was not every strike over

an arbitrable matter that was necessarily enjoinable.
Given the nature of the contract involved herein,
the nature of the dispute, the relevant public policy and
common law of the shop, the ordering of injunctive relief
here by the District Court collides with the most fundamental
of equity principles.

If injunctive relief is appropriate in

a case such as this, then surely the class of dismites falling
outside of the ambit of Boys Markets is infinitesimal,

and

Norris-La Guardia is truly a dead letter during the contract
term.

Thank you.
I1R. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Scheinholtz, you have

a few minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

LEONARD L. SCHEINIIOLTS, ESQ.

May it please the Court:

I would like to take up several statements that
Hr. Yablonski made.

First, his reference to the fact that

Hr. Kegel, the President of Gateway, testified that he did
not recall any arbitration over safety with respect to Gateway.

41
That in itself is meaningless because Mr. Kegel also
testified that he believe that there had been safety
disputes arbitrated under this agreement with other companies
and in fact the brief submitted amicus curiae by the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association at page 15 to 16 states
that at least 40 cases have been submitted to arbitration
under the 1968 Agreement in the three years preceding this
case.
Secondly, I do not even read the Respondents brief
as saying that safety disputes are not arbitrable.

What they

say in their brief is that they have the choice, that they
have the right to either submit them to arbitration or elect
to strike.
Q

That is not what Mr. Yablonski —
As I understood Mr. Yablonski in answer to my

Brother White — and this is 43A — he agreed with what
the umpire said here, namely, that although the company has
not made any charge against the safety committee — and I
gather you did not —
MR. SCIIEINHOLTZ:
Q

That is right.

— the Union states that it feels the only issue

that can be arbitrated in this hearing is whether or not the
safety committee acted arbitrarily and capriciously.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
rejected by the arbitrator.

They made that claim, and it was
He ruled that other kinds of

safety disputes may be arbitrated.

In essence there argument,

42
as Mr. Yablonski states, he says that by virtue of the fact
that the Mine Safety Program states that the removal of the
Mine Safety Committee can be subject to arbitration and that
this impliedly excludes all other types of safety disputes.
It does not say that.
Q

Let us assume for the moment that the regular

arbitration clause in the contract does not reach safety
disputes; just assume that for the moment.

Then the only

other grounds for arbitration is the safety clauses itself,
which are limited to deciding whether the safety committee
acted arbitrarily and capriciously.
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

I do not agree with that.

The

mere fact that the Mine Safety Program says that this type
of dispute may be submitted to arbitration does not necessarily
rule out the fact that other disputes regarding safety may be
submitted to arbitration.
Q

Yes, but under another provision, not this one.
MR. SCIIE INHOLT Z:

provide for arbitration.

Even this provision does not
It refers the parties to the

settlement of local and district disputes procedure for
arbitration.
In other words, the Mine Safety Program provision
contains no provision specifically dealing with arbitration.
Q

But it refers you to another provision.
*

MR. SCIIEINHOLTZ:

To the settlement, to the regular

43

grievance arbitration procedure.
Q

Only on one issue.
MR, SCHEINHOLTZ:

No, it just says that that kind

of dispute way be submitted to arbitration.
Q

That.is right, and that is the only reference with
* «.
respect to that issue.
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

I do not think that that means

necessarily that all others are not subject to arbitration.
In any event, that is a question concerning the interpretation
and application of the agreement that the arbitrator is in
a position to determine.

lie determined that against the

Union.
Finally, I would like to mention the fact that
Mr. Yablonski says that Judge McCune ruled —
Q

Is that an issue we have to decide?
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:

I do not think you have to decide

it, because the arbitrator has already decided it.
Q

Even if there had not in fact been an arbitration

in this case, I am sure your position would be that that is
for an arbitrator to decide, not for the Court,
MR. SCHEINHOLTZ:
right.
Q

That is right.

That is exactly

That is my position.
■The provisions under the Mine Safety Clauses for

arbitration were

not triggered because the company did not

challenge the safety committee?

44
MR. SCIIEINIIOLTZ:

No, before you ever get to that

point, the Union has to invoke the Mine Safety Procedures,
which it never invoked.

They had never made the request to

management for withdrawal of the men or any of those things.
The only way you get to the terminal point of the Mine Safety
Program is if they invoke the procedure.

They are in a

position of relying upon a procedure that they never invoked.
One other thing that I would like to mention is
the fact that there was no

ruling here by Judge McCune that

Counsel could not be present in this arbitration.
There is a specific provision in the settlement of
local district disputes procedure that specifies that.
is right in the Grievance Arbitration Clause.

That

I do not know

how it got there, but it is there.
Finally, the reason the arbitration award was
stricken was became in point of time it happened to come
down after the record had been transmitted to the Court of
Appeals as we stated in Footnote 12 to our reply brief.

In

a companion or related case, the United States Steel Corporation
versus UMW, in point of time the arbitration award came down
before the record was transmitted to the Court of Appeals, and
it is part of the record in that case.
And finally, obviously the Court must have considered
the arbitration award material to this proceeding because it
placed great emphasis on it in its decision and it is a part

45
of this case.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Scheinholtz.

Thank you, Mr.

Thank you, Mr. Yablonski.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 3:00 o'clock p.m., the case was
submitted.)
