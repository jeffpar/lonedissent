JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 72-1554, Super Tire Engineering against McCorkle.
Mr. Cohen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE M. COHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This case presents two issues for decision.
First, are substantial State welfare subsidies to
strikers, which are payable solely because of the strike,
an impermissible intrusion upon the National Labor policy
of free collective bargaining?
And second, whether a declaratory judgment action
to resolve that important issue, because — is rendered moot
when the particular strike during which the payments are
made is settled?

Notwithstanding that such payments continue

and continue to have an effect on both the same employer and
on other employers in the State.
This case arose on May 14th, 1971, when employees
of Super Tire Company, who were represented by Respondent
Teamsters Local 676, struck to obtain an agreement as to
their proposals for a new collective bargaining agreement.
During the first thirty days of that strike, many
of the strikers received public welfare assistance under a

4
totally funded, State-funded program, New Jersey General
Public Assistance Program.
Subsequently, after a thirty-day waiting period had
elapsed, the strikers became eligible for and received
assistance under a joint federal-state program, Aid to
Families of Dependent Children.
That program is no longer in effect in New Jersey,
and has now been replaced by another totally State-funded
program, Aid to Families of the Working Poor.
This action was filed on June 10th, 1971, after the
strike had continued for approximately three weeks.

It

sought both declaratory and injunctive relief.
The crux of the case was the issue of whether the
supremacy clause embodying the Federal Labor Policy precluded
the State and federal welfare subsidies to strikers,
The argument was that such payments, and the
availability of such payments, violated the National Labor
Policy of free collective bargaining.
This issue came before the court on June 24th, 1971.
The corap any argued two things:

First, it argued that as a

matter of law it. was correct, that there was a substantial
State inference by the statute itself, by the regulations
itself, and therefore that was an impermissible intrusion
on the free collective bargaining.
It further offered to demonstrate, through the

5

testimony of State officials who were present, through the
testimony of expert witnesses who were present, that there
was substantial interference in this particular case, where
the collective bargaining relation sits between Super Tire
and Teamsters Local 676.
The District Court, however, orally dismissed the
case under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.
Four days later, on June 26th, the strike ended.
The employees returned to work.
The company thereupon appealed to the Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit, which, in a lengthy, divided
opinion, dismissed the appeal as moot.
The basis for the Third Circuit's opinion was the
belief that this Court's decision in Oil Workers v. Missouri
required a separate, distinct rule for labor cases as opposed
to other controversies? and that in a labor controversy, as
least where the government is a defendant, a finding that
settlement of a strike would moot the determination of any
issues that could arise as a result of that strike.

do with it?

MR. COHEN:

Well, there are several reasons.

We're

dealing with an issue here, welfare to strikers, which has
been presented on numerous occasions to this Court.

It's

probably the most controversial, one of the most controversial
labor cases we have today.

I think the case can be decided as a

There's no need to take testimony here.

There's no need for an exhaustive analysis required.
Nobody — there's no need to do anything but look
at 'the State statutes and the State regulations, which have
been presented and are part of the Appendix, look at the
briefs of the parties in which this issue has been fully
briefed to this Court, and then, I think, based upon those
two considerations, a decision is possible.
I think that's —
QUESTION:

Have you cited any case to us in which

7
this Court has taken that route, that you're now suggesting?
MR. COHEN:

This Court has decided cases where, in

the interest of economy,, they felt the record was complete
enough to decide it, even though the lower court had found
no jurisdiction.

We do not cite any case of that, but I'll

be glad to supply the Court with those in a supplemental
brief, if necessary.
I have one specific ~~
QUESTIONs

Can you tell me, Mr. Cohen, are the New

Jersey statutes, or statute, whatever it is, is that a
counterpart precisely of similar statutes in other States?

General Assistance Program, has a counterpart in every State
in the United States,

does.

Iowa doesn't pay strikers; Mew

Maryland doesn't pay strikers; Massachusetts

And so on down the line.
We also have a federal, the Aid to Families of

Dependent Children program, that was in effect then but is not
now in effect in Mew Jersey.

It's an optional State program,

the youth program under that, the latest statistics I've
seen are that 29 States have a youth program at this time.
Of those 29 States there are approximately seven who
have qualifications to strikers.

Maryland says we don't

pay anybody who has, who is ineligible for unemployment
compensation.
Kansas and Nebraska say we don't pay anybody who's
engaged in unlawful strikes, as I believe

some States say

we pay people but we don't pay anybody who's engaged in a
lockout.
And there's limitations of -QUESTION:

Are you trying to suggest that, despite

these differences —
MR. COHEN:

Well, I think the principle is what's

9
involved —
QUESTION;

that if we decide this, it's going to

be of national **“
MR. COHEN;

I think what the principle is that

needs to be decided is whether States can pay welfare under
the -- whether it's to people engaged in any form of
economic pressure which is permissible under federal law.
That's really the question of whether that type of issue,
which pervades —• I agree, it pervades State programs, it
applies to Unemployment Compensation.

The States have

generally many forms of assistance.
But their general principle, it seems to me, is an
important principle -that needs to be resolved. And we think
that this Court -- you should decide it, or, at the very
least, provide guidelines for the District Court here, if it
does remand, so that the District Court will know how to
apply a standard here.
This is an issue that, as I say, is being litigated
throughout the country, and at this time there is no real
guideline as to how the lower court should operate.
So, even if the Court disagrees with me and finds
that there is an incomplete record here and it needs a better
record to decide it, I would hope that it would provide some
assistance to counsel, such as myself, who have to litigate
this case throughout the country, and would like to be able to

10
be informed whether the huge test that the First Circuit
applied in Grinneil, for example, is an appropriate method
of proceeding in this area.
I'd like to first address my comments to the mootness
argument, because that certainly was the basis for the
decision below, and. the on3.y basis for the decision below.
I think the first consideration in the mootness
area is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in saying
that there should be a different mootness test for labor
controversies or for controversies where the government is
fclie defendant rather than the plaintiff, or whether we should
have a series of variables that will regulate mootness in
cases that come up for appellate review.
Or whether, conversely, as we contend, there's
an avox-zedly mootness concept, most recently articulated in
cases such as Sibron and Moore, which apply to all cases
and gox^erns the disposition of all cases regardless of
what field of law is involved.
The court below, at the outset of its opinion,
seemed to indicate that that was the rule.

They articulated

four criteria of rnootness, which we think are appropriate.
They said the test whether there's an effect — possibility
of an effective decree; second, whether the controversy is
concrete; third, whether 'the parties are in a sufficiently
adverse context to assure effective litigation; and, finally,

11
apart from all the other tests, whether we fall within
Southern Pacific or the Moore test, where this is a recurring
controversy that's likely to evade judicial review.
We think that under any of those four standards
in this case there can be —' we've met each of those four
standards.
Super Tire sought

a declaratory judgment, not an

injunction, an effective decree that regulates the State
*

policy as to both Super Tire and other employees is still
possible.

Super Tire is going to be affected in the future

and that's what it sought to have determined, its rights
both present and future by means of a declaratory judgment
as to whether the State can engage in the payment.
There's nothing in this record to show this is a
feigned or a hypothetical or an abstract controversy.
Super Tire was harmed on one occasion, it will continue to
be harmed.

Other employers have been harmed and continue

to be harmed.
This isn't a need for an advisory opinion, there's
been actual injury in a live controversy that's taken place
and continues to take place.

And that’s whether we regard

this as a challenge to payments to strikes or availability
of strikers.
The parties continually remain in the adverse
posture.

Super Tire has collective bargaining agreement, the

12
contract is up this year, new negotiations will start?
there’s a possibility of strike again.
More than that, we have the fact that over thirty
percent of all strikes in this country take place during
the contract term, notwithstanding no-strike clauses and
the inhibitions on mid-term contract strikes of Boys Market
?
and Gateway Call.
The collective bargaining negotiation is more than
something that takes place once every three years ..and stops.
The continuing day-to-day ongoing relationship, and as long
as strike benefits are payable to a striker, that's affected
by the availability of the Mew Jersey policies that we
challenge here, that both the First Circuit in ITT and
Grinnell cases, the two-judge District Court in Francis,
each of these courts was confronted by a mootness contention
in the precise same situation we have here today, and each
of those found the controversy not to be moot and that there
was continuing relationship.
The Third Circuit said one strike of the length
requisite to raise the issue has already occurred, and
nothing in the record suggests the unlikelihood of future
repetition.
We think that same principle is applicable to
this case.
Finally, this case presents what we believe to be

3.3
a clear example of the continuing controversy, the type of
controversy that might otherwise evade appellate review, of
the type that this Court found to fall within the ambit of
Southern Pacific and such cases as Moore v, Ogilvie and
Roe v. Wade,
Strikes, on the average, as we point out in our
reply brief, last eleven days.

That’s even a far shorter

time than the period of pregnancy involved in Roe or the twoyear ICC orders that were called short-term and evasive of
review in Southern Pacif1c.
If this case is found moot, every challenge to State
welfare laws on the basis of preemption in the country is
likely to be similarly rendered moot before we can have an
appellate decision.
An entire class of cases will be denied review, and
avenues of appellate decision will be denied for an important
State-federal controversy in an important preemption area.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cohen, if you're challenging a New

Jersey State regulation, doesn't the New Jersey court system
provide some way for challenging that through a system of
administrative appeal and then go to the court?
MR. COHEN:

It can be challenged — well, the

challenge to New Jersey — there is no — it's not like
Unemployment Compensation, as far as I understand, that you
can bring an administrative determination to —

The administra-

14
tive determination has been made,, the payments are being
dispensed during the strike, we have no choice at that time
but to go

the only way we could enjoin those payments, to

prohibit the strikers from getting them, and thereby not
irreparably injuring our situation.
QUESTION:

But a typical State Administrative

Procedure Act will provide that a regulation can be challenged
just on the declaratory judgment type of basis.
MR. COHEN:

But this — there was no

ch allenge here would have been

the

whether there's such a

procedure, I'm not sure, but the challenge in this case
would have resulted

There's been a decision by the

New Jersey Department that administers the law.

The State

Attorney General has said has said that's a correct decision.
QUESTION: Well, why didn't you take that to the New
Je rsey courts ?
MR. COHEN:

Because what we're — I suppose we

could take it to the New Jersey courts, but the New Jersey
courts would not be in position to say that, to agree with us,
that what we are challenging here — I suppose they could —
that what we are challenging here is a violation of a federal
right.
QUESTION:

But they're sworn to uphold the Federal

Constitution, too, aren't they?
MR. COHEN:

That's right.

But that's not our

15
exclusive forum.

We think the federal courts are the appro­

priate place, not necessarily the only place, but certainly
the appropriate place for resolving questions of federal
preemption.
QUESTION: Well, your mootness argument, then, really
is that, when we're talking about evading reviev; and that sort
of a thing, that the moofcness ought to be tailored so that
you can, even with a short-lived controversy, get a review
in a federal court every time the —
MR. COHEN;

Well, presumably, if it's moot in the

federal court, it would be moot in the State courts as well.
QUESTION;

Well, I don't -think — if you recall

the Doremus case some years ago in this Court, the Supreme
Court of New Jersey apparently has different rules as to
mootness than we have.
MR. COHEN;

Well, the court, this Court has said on

occasion that mootness of a preemption issue can be — is a
federal question, so that even if the State court, for
example, had a different rule, this Court will still apply its
own rule.
I til ink we could go to the New Jersey court.

My

feeling was, at the time, that that would be a futile act.
The New Jersey courts have issued, not ruled on this question
precisely, but there's certainly been determinations by
New Jersey officials here.

16

We felt that this was presenting squarely an
important federal issue that ought to be resolved, not just
for New Jersey but generally, and that, 'therefore, our
appropriate forum was, rather than go to the New Jersey
courts, to go to -the federal court.

And that's why we

commenced this action.
Now, the point I was making is that if that is
going to be decided moot, whether under

by reason of the

fact that the strike is settled, then there is no way that
we're ever going to be able to get, we or any other employer
throughout the United States is ever going to get review of
the question.
You're going to — and going to this Court’s opinion
in Liner v. Jafco, that's the particular, that’s the exact
type of situation which should not occur when you’re dealing
with a preemption problem.

Preemption issues are particular

problems where the Court should be very careful to avoid
hindrances in the way of decision.
And that's what we think, as I say, would be the
result here, and wotild certainly be the result with an eleven»
day average strike period, should this Court agree with the
Third Circuit on mootness.
Before I turn to the merits, I just wanted to address
the Oil Workers case, which is the basis for the decision
below.

1?
We don't think that case stands for the proposition
that there's a distinct or different or new rule fojr labor
controversy.

Rather, we submit that that case was -- which

was a situation involving the emergency seizure by the Governor
of the State as to — which is a discretionary power, of a
public utility confronted in a labor situation.
The crux of that case, we think are threefold where
it's different from our cases
First, the emergency discretionary speculative
nature of any reoccurrence.
Secondly, the fact that if the Governor seized
another utility, and there is no showing that some other
plaintiff couldn't have come in, that didn't fall within the
Southern Pacific doctrine.
And finally, and perhaps most significantly, the
plaintiffs in that case had sought to enjoin only a specific
act, namely the seizue of the utility.

They did not seek, as

we sought here, a declaratory judgment which would affect
future as well as present rights.
For all those reasons, we think that the defendant
in Oil Workers perhaps had met his burden of showing that
there was no likelihood or reasonable expectation that the
wrong would be repeated.
In this case we don't think the defendants have
met this burden, that there's been continuing and irreparable

18

injury that continues to occur as long as there is the
availability on the books, and that ought to be a controversy
•this Court ought to address.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cohen, in Moore v, Ogi1vie, which you

cite, had the case been deemed moot from the beginning by the
lower courts, or had it become moot between the time of the
lower decision and this Court’s proposed decision?
MR. COIIEN:

It cams --it was certainly moot before

it reached this Court.
QUESTION:

Isn't that somewhat different than to

say that Moore v. Ogilvie, in effect, protects -this Court’s
right to review a recurring problem, when the lower courts
have decided it in a concrete non-moot context, as opposed
to what you’re asking here, which is basically that you start
out in the federal District Court, your court of first
jurisdiction, with something that may already be moot?
MR. COHEN:

No, that’s not what we have here.

We

had a controversy that when it reached the District Court it
was not moot.

The District Court here did not find it to be

moot.
There was no —> there was no argument that it was
moot before the District Court.
it on the merits entirely, if —QUESTION: Against you.
MR. COHEN:

Against us.

The District Court decided

19

QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

Yes.
The District Court said that there was

no way that we could ever prove that welfare payments to
strikers constituted a substantial interference.

It read the

ITT v. Minter case in the First Circuit as- ruling out any
possibility that we could ever make proof to meet our — the
allegations of our complaint.
Now, subsequently, the First Circuit, in Grinnail,
explicated ITT, to say that's precisely what it didn't mean
ITT to say.

So that I think there's no question that the

District Court's reading of ITT, which was the basis for its
decision, is wrong.
The District Court -- it was the appeal on their
basis, similar to the appeal that the employer took in
Grinne.ll and the same, where the District Court did the same
thing, that was the basis for our appeal, and it was after ~
four days after the District Court decision that the strike
settled, and therefore raised the mootness controversy.
That's when the employees returned to work.
tbw, there was a statement made at the hearing before
the District Court that the employees had ratified the
agreement and were going to return to work the next working
day, which was Monday, the 28th.
But there was never any contention nor argument nor
finding by the District Court that that mooted the controversy

20

at that point.
I!d like to turn to the merits of the case, which
again I think are significant and worthy of decision, and
which this Court should either decide or provide significant
guidelines for these to the lower federal courts.
The crux of our position is this;
The federal labor law, the basis of the federal
labor law is the voluntary, private
QUESTION:
MR, COHEN:
QUESTION;

May I ask you one more thing on the -Sure.
— mootness.

This was Unemployment

Compensation?
MR. COHEN:

No, this is welfare assistance, State

and joint Federal-State welfare.
QUESTION:

Does it — is the same argument about,

arise about Unemployment Compensation?
MR. COHEN;

The same mootness argument would arise.

The Grinnell case —
QUESTION:

No, how about the same preemption

argument?
MR. COHEN; The same preemption argument was raised
in Grinnell,
Now, I think that the Unemployment Compensation
presents a similar different principle, in the sense that
Unemployment is a direct tax on the employee, there is no

21

need standard.

But I think fcha same general principle should

govern in that type of case.
QUESTION!

Well, there might be a completely different

mootness argument.
MR. COHEN:

No, I don't think it is, because in each

case, in Grinnell, the Grinnell -- ITT involved welfare;
Grinnell involved Unemployment Compensation.
QUESTION:

Yes, but if you can pay — you would

certainly have a stake in what your rate's going to be.
A continuing stake in what your rates are.
MR, COHEN;

That's right.

Except

except in

Grinnell, it wasn't directly charged to the employer.
QUESTION: But, anyway, this doesn't involve that?
MR. COHEN:

This involves welfare.

The Grinnell --

Grinnell was, it was taken out of a general pot, so that the
employer there did not have to pay a particular share, as
opposed to other States where it's directly taxed to a
single employer.

There was no argument to that.

The court found it not to be moot because of
Southern Pacific, and because of the likelihood that there
would be another strike involving the same employer.

And

that's really the basis of our position here.
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

Thank you.
I want to save a few minutes for

rebuttal, but I would like to spend some time on our merit

22

argument.
The federal labor lav/s, we believe, is the core of
the federal labor laws, the voluntary private adjustment of
disputes.

The federal labor law has set up a framework which

indicates that certain types of conduct and the disposition
of disputes, certain types of economic pressure by unions,
secondary boycotts, violent to partial strikes are forbidden?
but where there is no such regulation, it's an area which
Congress has specifically intended to be free.
Congress, in order to decide which area is to be
free and which area is to be prohibited, has waived the
interest of employers, of unions, of the public, and of the
employees involved.
Where the area has been decided to be free, where
Congress has not regulated it, they needed the Labor Board in
cases such as Porter or American Shipbuilding, or the States
in cases such as Morton may impinge upon that area.
In Morton, for example, the State attempted to
provide damages for certain types of union economic pressures,
which the federal labor law had held to be lav/ful.

This

Court held such damage awards to be impermissible.

That the

State had interfered with the balance struck by Congress.
Nov;, we think that principle is similarly applicable
here.

A state by insulating one party from the economic

disadvantages of a strike, by allying its treasury on the side

23
of the union's economic power, has tipped the scale.

It's

affected the balance.
A strike who's receiving substantial State welfare
payments is going to have a different resolve and a different
determination, and approach negotiations in a different manner
than a striker who's not getting any money from the State.
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

How generous are these State payments?
Well, the estimate is — according to

the expert testimony contained in the Appendix, is they
run anywhere from 30 to 70 percent, and maybe even higher in
cases of the pre-strike takehome pay for strikers.
If you look at a striker's pre-strike takehome pay, -—
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:

Yes, but how about in New Jersey?
In New Jersey, there's no — the record

does not contain any evidence.

The testimony we were prepared

to put on shows that the benefits in this case ran 70 percent
or more of pre-strike takehome pay.

Based upon the wage

rates for the employees involved, and the level of assistance
in the State of New Jersey.
If the boys were making more money, it would have been
a lov/er percentage.
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN;

Pretty affluent State, isn't it?
Well, this is not uncommon.

As I say,

the expert testimony is that that's pretty standard.
Now, this can increase, you've got other forms of

24
assistance,, Unemployment Compensation, for example, that can
also kick in, and you can have several different benefits.
New Jersey — I think the important point here,
two points, before I close:
The important point here is that New Jersey has
created a special rule of law which is applicable only to
strikers.

These are benefits that would not be payable to any

other person seeking benefits, seeking welfare in the State of
New Jersey.

Anyone else in New Jersey, who is physically or

mentally capable of taking a job is ineligible for welfare
assistance if he refuses to take the job.
A striker, by federal lav?, has a federally protected
right to a job, and yet he is not taking that job,
Nov?, we submit that that is a special exception, not
of general application rule, as the State would have urged,
but a special exception that's been carved out only for
strikers, and which necessarily affects the area which Congress
designed to be free.
The second thing that I think is significant here is
that what we're talking about is not something that would
have existed and continued to exist, before the strike, but
something that has tilted the balance right before the
beginning

right at the status quo before the strike

commenced.
And this type of interference, v/here the Governor of

25

the State has gone in and created a special policy that applies
only to strikers and is a direct interference with State law,
regardless of the State interests involved.
QUESTION;

I think this

But you wouldn't object to welfare if

employees were locked out, I guess?
MR. COHEN;

I think that as long as the ~ as long

as the employees are engaged in a federally protected
activity, if there's a permissible lockout, then they ought
to get welfare assistance ~ they ought not to get welfare
assistance, and they ought not to get any State help.
I think that private parties can go in and always
assist, the union is entitled to use its strike funds, it's
entitled to get other assistance as well.

But once the State

gets involved in allying its economic power with the economic
power of the union itself, then I think we've tipped the
scale.
That's really the crux of our position.
There's been much discussion in the briefs about
the federal policy on AFDC.
Let me say this again, that the AFDC program is no
longer operative in New Jersey. The program that we think that
the

the only program in — the only program now operating are

State-funded programs; but, more than that, —
QUESTION;
MR. COHEN;

JiFDC is not operative in New Jersey?
That's correct.

26

QUESTION;

What did they — did New Jersey withdraw

from it?
MR» COHEN;

New Jersey withdrew from the Youth

Program of the AFDC, the one that benefits were payable under
he re.
Secondly, even if we go to the AFDC policy, for
the reasons that we1ve covered in our reply brief, we think
Congress has not sufficiently spoken in that area to give
any indication of its intent,
I'd like to reserve the remainder of iny time for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Mr, O'Brien.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT F. O'BRIEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT TEAMSTERS
LOCAL UNION NO. 676
MR, O'BRIEN;

Your Honors:

We represent the Respondent Teamsters Local Union.
By leave of Court we've been permitted to divide our oral
argument with the counsel, Deputy Attorney General, who
represents the public officials in this matter.
The State has not argued mootness.

We, hoever,

have argued mootness.
We'd like to make several points, if we may,
relative to the record below.

27

Initially, Your Honor, we would think that the Court,
in reviewing this case, should have as its starting point the
coraplaint which was filed by Super Tire.
If the Court examines the complaint, I think that
the Court can see, in effect, that Super Tire was complaining
not about welfare benefits in general but, rather, the
granting of welfare benefits to the particular employees of
Super Tire during the time that they were on strike.

And

I think that's rather important, since;, in effect, I think
it puts this particular lawsuit into a certain timeframe.
Additionally, Your Honor, at the hearing below, and
I think this is important, Judge Kitchen in the District Court
took no testimony.

However, he did allow oral argument of

all counsel, and it was at that time that we raised the issue
that this case, in effect, was something that the court should
not get into, under ITT vs. Minter.
But we also raised, Your Honor, and I think it's
important, and it's in the Appendix rather clearly, that
we raised the issue of mootness.

We told the court at that

time, in the Appendix I thinJc it's rather clear, that the
strike was over, that the day before the hearing, June 23rd,
the employees voted to return to work, and that the employees
were about to go back to work on the next working day.

And

employer counsel agreed that the strike had ended, and that
the employees were making preparation to go back to work.

28
So, in effect, what we have is a suggestion of
mootness, not on appeal, but a suggestion of raootness at
the District Court level.
The United States
QUESTION:

-

Well, what do you have to say about

Mr, Cohen1 s argument that, by definition, a striker is
refusing to take available work and is therefore, under
New Jersey law, automatically ineligible for New Jersey
welfare relief?
MR. O'BRIEN:

If Your Honor please, I'm going to

defer to my co-counsel, the Deputy Attorney General, who
will get into the merits of it.
I would simply note that you can also take the
opposite view and in effect say that a man who exercises his
federal right to strike, in effect, would be discriminated
against by the State of New Jersey denying him welfare benefits
is the argument that's been raised.
We would go on to ask -the Court to particularly
examine the rather erudite opinion of Judge Adams below, who
pointed out -that there are generally different kinds of
mootness criteria which have been applied.
We'll take issue with counsel for the Petitioner,
who says that the type of case involved is what's important.
We think that the particular criteria spelled out by Judge
Adams below are somewhat criteria which have always existed,

29

but which come up with different results, depending on the
type of case.
Judge Adams put particular emphasis upon Oil Workers,
and we think it was well placed.
Oil Workers, in effect, concerned a labor dispute
where the State seized, or the State declared that a private
employer was a public employer and therefore the employees
had no right to strike.
By the time the case got up to this Court, the Court
said the labor dispute is over.

There we could again say

that the Court would never really have that kind of a case
before it, but yet, three years later, the labor dispute
continued in Bus Employees vs. Missouri, and the Court did
get an opportunity to review the case.
So what I'm suggesting to the Court is that we're
not faced with the situation where this is continually
evading review.
There's a case now pending in the Eastern District
Court for Michigan, where the strike itself has continued
for two years.

So we're not faced with something which was

pointed out in ICC vs. ^Southern Pacific that's going to
continually evade review? rather, we think this is something
that the Court should really decline to look at and decline
to act upon under the Article III clause that we've got to
have a concrete case.

30
QUESTION;

You say all the employer has to do is

wait for a good, long strike.
MR. O’BRIEN;

Well, I think the employer has got to

he personally affected by what's going on, that he has got
to have something,: harm

befalling him, and I don't think we

have the harm befalling Super Tire, at this posture of the
case.
In effect, Super Tire claims that there's a continu­
ing effect upon it, but then, in Oil Workers the employees
said they could have a continuing effect upon them since they
didn't have a right to strike.
But the Court said that's somewhat speculative.
And here, too, we think to say that the employees,
that this employer has a continuing controversy and that the
case is still alive ignores -the realities of the situation.
We, as the union, have a contract with this employer.
at peace with the employer.

We're

We don't feel that we have an

antagonistic interest with him.
The State of New Jersey, as such, is not doing
anything to this employer.
We would also point out to the Court, in Oil Workers,
Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out a very good point, that if
the Court acted, they could not really issue an effective
order, because, in effect,
was over.

in Oil Worlcers, the labor dispute

31

Here, too, if the Court were to issue an order, it
would be ordering the respondent State officials to do that
which they've already done, which is already done with.
They would be ordering them to ~ would be ordering them not
to make welfare payments to the particular employees involved.
And, as such, it would be impossible to do anything, because,
quite frankly, they're no longer making these welfare payments.
We would therefore think the case of Oil Workers,
and the four criteria relied upon by the judge below, Judge
A-daros, should be affirmed.
I think, in closing, on the mootness issue itself,
I think the words of Judge Adams are quite -QUESTION;

Although in doing that you would lose

your favorable decision in the District Court.
MR. O'BRIEN;

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I don't

understand.
QUESTION:

Well, it was vacated.

MR. O'BRIEN;

The decision below was vacated in the

District Court, and a new order was told to be entered by
the
QUESTION: To dispose.
MR. O'BRIEN:
QUESTION;

Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.

Unh-hunh.

MR. O'BRIEN;

In effect, tiie words of Judge Adams,

that a court acts only when called upon to act, can it

32

legitimately act at all.
Here, I don’t think the Court can say that it's
really required to act, since the strike has ended, since
this matter has now, in effect, terminated between this
employer and this employee, these employees; and we would
therefore ask the Court to look at the four criteria, to
look at Oil Workers, which is very, very applicable in the
rationale, and in effect declare this case to have been
mooted out below.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SKILLMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS McCOKKLE AND ENGELMAN
MR. SKILLMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The single issue on the merits of this case is one
of congressional intent.
Has Congress expressed the intent to prohibit the
payment of welfare benefits to strikers?
I think the Petitioner would agree with that formulation of the issue.

issue?

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:00 p.m.j
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Skiliman, you may

continue.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SKILLMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS McCORKLE and ENGELMAN
[Resumed]
MR. SKILLMAN:

May it please the Court:

As I started by indicating, prior to the luncheon
break, I think that the State is on common ground with the
Petitioner in saying that this case on the merits involves
an issue of congressional intent.
Our area of disagreement, however, is whether, in
ascertaining that, the intent of Congress, the Court should
look to the National Labor Relations Act as urged by the
Petitioner, or whether, as urged by the State, it should look
to the federal categorical assistance provisions of the
Social Security Act,
If Congress had not dealt comprehensively with the
subject of welfare in the Social Security Act, then it would
be arguable, certainly, that the Court should look to tine
National Labor Relations Act, look to certain underlying
principles in the National Labor Relations Act with regard
to collective bargaining, whether or not those principles
require a principle of neutrality by the State in labor

35
disputes, and whether or not there's an important counter­
vailing State interest, as we certainly would say that there
is, in providing assistance to the needy.
However, the primary welfare programs in effect in
this country today are themselves federal programs, enacted by
Congress, as was the National Labor Relations Act.
A.nd since the provisions of the Social Security
Act, dealing with those welfare programs, specifically outline
conditions of eligibility for the receipt of welfare, rather
than — it is to these provisions enacted by Congress, rather
than the general provisions of the National Labor Relations
Act, dealing with collective bargaining, that the Court should
look in ascertaining whether or not it was the intention of
Congress to prevent the payment of welfare to needy
individuals who happened to be on strike.
Now, when you look to the Social Security Act, you
find no such expression of congressional intent.

Rather, with

the main federal categorical assistance program and the one
remaining principal federal categorical assistance program
still in effect in New Jersey, that involving the so-called
one-parent household, there are two criteria of eligibilitys
One, that a parent be dead, absent from the home, or
disabled; and
Two, that there be the requisite need.
Now, for the Court to hold that there is a dis-

36

qualification from the receipt of benefits under this program
for strikers, it would in effect hcive to read into the Act
a further condition of eligibility, which is simply not in the
provisions of the Federal Social Security Act.
QUESTION:

Has there been any practice in New

Jersey before New Jersey withdrew from AFDC, payments in
situations like this under AFDC?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Your Honor, it’s my understanding,

and its difficult to piece this back before '57, which is
the date of the regulation in question here, but it's my
understanding that New Jersey, under the federal categorical
assistance pjrogram, has never disqualified strikers.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

There —

"Never" goes back how far?

MR. SKILLMAN:

"Never", I assume back to 1935.

But my source of knowledge is —•
QUESTION:

My recollection is not that.

MR. SKILLMAN:

My source of knowledge, as I say,

is memoranda, internal agency memoranda from the middle
1950's, which indicate that that was the case with respect
to the federal categorical assistance programs,
QUESTION:

That's the middle 1950's?

MR. SKILLMAN:

That's the date of the memoranda

which, I say, are my only vision of what occurred prior to

37

the middle Fifties.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. SKILLMAN:

But those memoranda indicate that

benefits have been paid under the federal categorical
assistance program, but not under State general assistance.
And it was because, there was considerable controversy with
respect to the State general assistance that we had several
bills that went into the State Legislature in the middle
1950’s, and finally the regulation, which has become the
focus of this case, and which, although by its terms, is
only applicable to State general assistance, has, as a matter
of administrative application, been applied to the federal
categorical assistance programs as well.
QUESTION:

Mr. Skiliman, Mr. Cohen, in his

presentation, suggested that by definition a striker was
ineligible under New Jersey statutes because New Jersey
limited payments to a person who was ready to accept work if
that work was available, and again by definition a striker
is rejecting work which is available.

What have you to say

about that, in terms of the Mew Jersey statutes?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Your Honor, first of all, with respect

to New Jersey's participation in the federal categorical
assistance programs, which is the main part of this case,
we are of course required to abide by federal requirements
and not by State requirements, except to the extent that the

30

State may have the option to augment or supplement federal
req uirements.
But my understanding is that under both the
applicable federal and State provisions, that there ordinarily
~ and there are certain exceptions to this; but ordinarily an
applicant for assistance must be prepared to seek and accept
work.
And I don't think that a striker would be any
exception to this.

In other words, he has an obligation to

seek and accept work other than work with the employer from
whom he is striking.
QUESTION;

Well, who puts in this "other than";

is that your reading of the statute, or is that — does the
statute say "other than"?
MR. SK.ILLMAN:

No.

All the statute says is that

anyone who applies for categorical assistance or general
assistance must be ready to seek and accept employment.
QUESTION;

Yes.

Well, now Mr, Cohen’s point is

that a striker is automatically ineligible because he is
refusing to work in a very vigorous way, isn't he?
MR. SKILLMAN:
particular employer.

Well, he's refusing to work for one

He is not refusing to work for another

employer, and it's not that uncommon for someone who is out
on strike, particularly when you're speaking about a lengthy
strike, to ~~

39

QUESTION:

What I'm trying to get at:

in this exception that you're talking about?

who writes

Where does that

come from?
MR. SKILLMAN:

I don’t think that it is an exception.

I think, on the face of the statute there's an obligation of
any applicant for assistance to seek and accept employment.
That is not limited to any particular employer.
QUESTION:

And the --

Well, what's New Jersey's position on

that?
MR. SKILLMAN:

New Jersey's position on that is that

the striker may be called upon to seek and accept employment
with an employer other than the employer from whom he's on
strike.
QUESTION: Well, we're going around in a circle.
Where does New Jersey get the authority for making the
exception, if the statute is as Mr. Cohen described it?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Well, I think that all the statute

says -~
QUESTION:

That he is to accept work if available.

MR. SKILLMAN:

That is correct.

QUESTION: And he is declining to accept work which
is available with his regular employer, is he not?
MR. SKILLMAN;

That is correct.

With his regular

employer, but not —- but not generally refusing to accept
employment.

40
QUESTION: Well, each time you come back and I'm
still unenlightened.

You write an exception into the

statute for the particular employer who has been strude»
What is New Jersey's position on that issue?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Well, the position has to be that

the employee is permitted not to

not to go back to work

with that particular employer. And I think that the foundation
for that position by the State of New Jersey itself draws
sustenance from the National Labor Relations Act.
QUESTION:

Well, this has to mean, I gather, that

if the only possible work available is at the struck plant,
that he's striking, New Jersey nevertheless pays him welfare
payments, because New Jersey does not require him to accept
work at the struck plant? is that it?
MR. SKILLMAN;
QUESTION:

That is correct as --

Well, I gather what the Chief — and

I'd be interested, too,,

Is this a matter of administrative

interpretation of the requirement, or is there a —
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

It's certainly a —

-- New Jersey court decision that says

this?
MR. SKILLMAN:

There's no court decision on this

point, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. SKILLMAN;

And certainly on the face of the

41

in the face of the regulation, which is the focus of the
case, all that regulation says is that an individual is not
disqualified from receiving welfare benefits by virtue of
being on strike.

It doesn't go on and deal with the various

situations which may arise under the ■— satisfying the various
conditions of either federal or State statutes.
QUESTION:

Do I understand you, Mr. Skiliman, to

say that if New Jersey did disqualify him, at least in so far
as the federal categorical assistance programs are concerned,
New Jersey would violate the provisions of the federal
req ui rerne n t s ?
QUESTION:

No.

MR. SKILLMAN:

No.

No.

Well, tile federal requirements are

quite — are quite similar with respect to an individual being
willing to accept work, so I would say no.
QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

So that New

Jersey could disqualify him because he refused to accept work,
without violating any federal statutes.
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

So that there’s no

there would be no

conflict at all between the federal welfare laws and the labor
laws, if he was disqualified?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Ho.

No, there would not.

But that has not been the focus of
QUESTION;

of this case.

Well, some of the argument is that you

42

should look to the welfare lav/s for guidance here, not to the
labor laws.

Well, if you look to the federal labor — the

federal welfare law, which is thought to preempt here, or
thought to require — or thought to be forceful enough to
preempt the labor requirements.

If you look to that, there's

just no conflict between that and the labor lav;, is there?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Well, when you say that and the

labor lawsthere's certainly a great conflict between the
provisions of the Social Security Act and what the Petitioner
would like to read into the labor law.
QUESTION:

Why?

MR» SKILLMAN:

Because the federal Act requires two

principal criteria of eligibility:

one, that you have the one~

parent home; and, No. 2, that there be need.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SKILLMAN:

Once those two criteria are

satisfied —
QUESTION:

I know, but I just asked you if a man

if a man refuses to take a job, is there need?
MR» SKILLMAN;
QUESTION:

There still is need, certainly.

I know, but it doesn't — it wouldn't —

you just told me it would not violate the federal law if
this man was disqualified.
MR. SKILLMAN:

Individually he may be disqualified.

His family may not be disqualified.

So that you're talking

43

in other words, in that type of situation, if I can get away
for a second from the labor part of it, let's just take an
individual who refuses to work.
QUESTION:

He says, I don't want to work,.

Yes?

MR. SKILLMAN:

The family may still receive

assistance under the federal categorical assistance program.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. SKILLMAN:
will not

That particular indolent individual

his needs will not be included in the calculation

of the needs of his family.
QUESTION:

But New Jersey includes him?

MR. SKILLMAN:

Weil, New Jersey would not include

him if in fact he has not taken available work.

New Jersey

requires, as does the federal -~
QUESTION: But you don't interpret a strike —- staying
away from work on account of a strike as refusing to take
aval 1 ab le erap loy me a t ?
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

That is correct.

Although the federal law would not «--• it

would not be inconsistent with federal law if you did disqualify
him?
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

Not inconsistent with federal —

— law if you did disqualify him.

44
It would be consistent with federal law if you
did disqualify him.
MR. SKILLMAN:

I think it would be consistent with

the Federal Social Security Act to disqualify the individual,
but not his family, —
QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. SKILLMAN:

-- if he's available for work.

But we get right back around to the same question, and that
is:

what's the meaning of refusing to take available work?
And when you have a strike situation, can it fairly

be said that there is available work?

Taking into account,

as the Petitioner would have the Court in other respects,
taking into account the policies which underlie the National
Labor Relations Act, which make it permissible -QUESTION:

Let me say this:

Now, that interpreta­

tion is by virtue of a regulation, that construction is by
virtue of a regulation of the New Jersey Welfare Department?
Or just their policy, their attitude?
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

In terms of "available for work"?

Yes.

MR. SKILLMAN:

It's my understanding that this is

the policy of the New Jersey Division of Public Welfare,
not expressed in regulation, and that it is also the position
with respect to the federal categorical assistance programs
of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

45
So that it is not

we are not talking here about

position of the State of New Jersey alone, but I think a
position in common with that held by the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare with respect to the meaning of
"aval1able for work".
And as I say
QUESTIONs

Hr. Skiliman, I gather that all that

New Jersey’s withdrawn from, effective June 30th, /71, is
the unemployed parent segment of AFDC.
MR. SKILLMAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

New Jersey still participates otherwise

in the AFDC program, and the
MR. SKILLMAN:

-

The other parts of the program that

it participates in are the principal parts of the program.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SKILLMAN:

In the present time in New Jersey

we have 422,000 people on AFDC.
QUESTION: But so far as unemployed parent segment is
concerned, to the extent he's covered, he's covered under
New Jersey's own Assistance to Families of the Working Poor?
MR. SKILLMAN:

That has taken the place, as of

July 1, 1971, of the unemployed parent segment.
QUESTION:

All right.

we have here is a regulation

Now, -die regulation that

• what ~~ applicable to that

State program, Assistance to Families of the Working Poor?

46

MR, SKILLMAN:

By its terms, it's applicable only

to general assistance, which AF17P does not technically fall
under.
QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. SKILLMAN:

As a matter of administrative

application, it is applied to general assistance, to AFWP and
to the federal categorical assistance program; so it's, as a
matter of administrative application, it's applied across
the board.
QUESTION:

I don't see what — how it's applicable

to the unemployed parent segment of the AFDC program, if you've
withdrawn from it?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Well, we're not — it doesn't apply

to programs that we're not participating in, but it's
applicable to all programs the State of New Jersey is
participating in.
QUESTION:

Where the unemployed parent is a

consideration.
MR, SKILLMAN:

No, it's not — that's the one

program —
QUESTION;

You know, Mr. Cohen suggested that if

we get to the merits, we ought to decide it here without
sending it back.

For the life of me, everything you've said

only indicates more forcefully than even that if we agree
that this case is not moot in the first instance, we better

47
send it back and let the three-judge court wrestle with it.
They'll know a lot more about the Mew Jersey situation than
we can possibly know, including me.
MR. SKILLMAN:

Your Honor, if I may briefly direct

myself to that question, because I think it’s important.
I think that when this case is fully analysed, it
will be shown that the case really turns on an analysis of
the meaning of the federal statutes, but most specifically
the Federal Social Security Act.
If we're wrong in this, and if the case requires
factual development, then I think it's obvious this Court
can't decide the case —
QUESTION:

Well, I think it may involve more than

that, it may involve some questions of the construction of
the New Jersey statutes.
MR, SKILLMAN:

Likewise if it involves those sorts

of questions, I again agree the case would have to go back
before the Court could reach the merits
QUESTION;

Well, it's my suggestion that some of

the things you've been saying to us indicate that the matter
of construction of the New Jersey statutes may be very
significant.
MR. SKILLMAN:

I may, Your Honor, have ~ to the

extent that my response to certain questions may have suggested
that there is not a congruence between the New Jersey statutes

48
and federal statutes, and between New Jersey administrative
interpretations and federal HEN interpretations, I think I
might have suggested that.
But I think that that is incorrect.

That essentially

all that New Jersey is doing with respect to both the
federal categorical assistance programs and its own Statecreated programs is what is required by the Federal Social
Security Act, and what has been recognized to be required by
the Federal Social Security Act.
QUESTION:

That's what we held in Davidson v. Francis,

isn't it, in affirming per curiam that District Court decision
from Maryland?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Well, I think that there is some

dispute as to exactly what the Court did hold there, because
-— and I think that the Petitioner rightly points out in his
Reply Brief, that the jurisdictional statement filed by the
State of Maryland did not specifically raise the issues that
are being raised at this time? a jurisdictional statement
filed by the Chamber of Commerce did, however.

But, as a

technical matter, that was dismissed on procedural grounds
and not on the merits.
So, as a very technical matter, it may be said that
this Court hasn't already reached this issue in Davidson, so
I think —
QUESTION:

Well, what do you think was decided in

49

Davidson?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Oh, I think that that case involved

specific questions of interpretation of the unemployed parent
segment of the AFDC statute.
QUESTION:

Right.

And we held that it was — the

District Court held, and we affirmed it, as I remember, that
Maryland was required, under the federal statute, to make
payments to unemployed parents who ware unemployed by reason
of a labor dispute.

Isn't that correct?

MR. SKILLMAN:

I think that’s what the Court held,

but I would have to concede that that District Court opinion
is difficult reading, it can be read to have dealt solely
with the conformity of what Maryland was doing with certain
federal regulations, without going through to the next step
of examining the provisions of the Social Security Act, which
those regulations were predicated on.
It’s a difficult decision.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION:

Mr. Skillman, you have said that there is

a distinction, for purposes of your discussion, between a party
on strike and an able-bodied person not on strike who just,
nevertheless, refuses to take a job.
I’m thinking about how you would define who is on
strike.
Assume for a moment that you had a supervisory

50

employee who just decided he didn't like his employer, and
he quit and came into the Welfare Office and said, "I'm on
strike, I'd like to collect my welfare check."
What would New Jersey do with respect to a fellow
like that?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Well, first of all, Your Honor, if I

may answer that by correcting what I think is perhaps a
misconception.

He doesn't -*• he wouldn't come in to the

New Jersey Welfare Office and say, "I'm on strike"; he'd
come into the New Jersey Welfare Office and say, "I'm needy."
And the only question would be whether or not New
Jersey should disqualify a needy individual who otherwise
would be eligible simply because of the fact that the reason
for his being needy is that he is on strike.

And New Jersey

wouldn't draw any distinction between the lockout situation,
the supervisory employee situation, the employee who was on
strike but had dissented on the vote as to whether or not a
strike should be taken, and the employee who had voted to
go on strike.
In eitiler instance, what New Jersey would look to,
and what I think the Federal Social Security Act would require
New Jersey to look to under its provisions, is;
individual needy?
QUESTION:

Is the

That's the —
If you concluded this supervisor was

in need, even though a job were still available for him, and

51

he were able-bodied and he said, "I’m out on strike"; if he
were in need under those circumstances he'd receive welfare
benefits?
MR. SKILLMAN:

Well, you're talking about the

individual who is, in effect, refusing to cross the picket
line.
QUESTION;

No, I'm talking about a man, there's no

strike except his own private little strike; he says, "I just
don't like to work there."
MR. SKILLMAN;

I would think, although those

sections are not involved here, I would be quite sure that
the Stats Ttfould find that individual to be disqualified as
not being willing to take available work.
QUESTION:

Do you see any equal protection

implications in drawing the line you suggest?
MR. SKILLMAN;

We have not suggested any federal

equal protection consideration in this case.
QUESTION:

I know you have not, but I ask whether

you saw any such implication?
MR. SKILLMAN:
in which there might be.

I can conceive of factual circumstances
But that's not what we're relying on

here.
QUESTION:

But you would qualify everybody who's

protected by the Labor Act and disqualify everybody who isn't?
MR. SKILLMAN:

That — that, I think, is the line

52
that New Jersey would take.

It's not what is said by the

regulations before the Court.
QUESTION:

Oh, it isn't.

You said, but that's the

line you think that would -“?
MR. SKILLMAN;

That’s the line I think the State

would take as a matter of interpretation of the underlying
federal and State law.
QUESTION:

You think that would present no equal

protection problem?
To clarify it, the man who’s on strike against the
world as against the man who’s on strike against a particular
employer.

Do you think that Mew Jersey may say yes, if

you’re striking against Westinghouse Electric, you're
qualified to receive welfare; but if you're just on strike
because you're mad at the world, we won't give it to you.
MR. SKILLM/iN;

Nell, the striker who’s on strike

against an employer is doing something that has cesrtain
protection under the National Labor Relations Act.

That’s

not true of the individual who has his own private war with
respect to some private interest.
QUESTION:

Maybe he’s got a First Amendment right

not to work.
MR. SKILLMAN:
I can

Conceivably.

Conceivably.

And then

maybe there would be an equal protection question if

he could spell that out.

Rut I think I would have some

53
difficuity with that.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You have about four

minutes left, Mr. Cohen.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE M. COIIEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF TIIE PETITIONERS
MR. COHEN:

I'd like to spend those four minutes,

I think, trying to unravel some of the confusion which Mr.
Skillman has perhaps left the Court with.
There's a clear regulation in New Jersey which is
contained on page 129 of the Appendix, that has been in
effect since 1957 in the State of New Jersey, which governs
the State welfare programs of New Jersey, which is the main
part of this case.
QUESTION:

Now, —

MR. COHEN:

Yes?

QUESTION:

-- didn't Mr. Skillman — I thought he

said the main part of this case was the federal categorical
assistance program.
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:

That's where he‘s wrong.
I see.

MR. COHEN:

The strikers did not receive benefits in

any substantial amount under the AFD — ADC program, single­
parent household.

The likelihood of a single parent being

absent from the house because of a strike, there is no

54
unemployed provision under that section.
Strikers became eligible for federal welfare
assistance and became

and started collecting it in

substantial amounts only with the adoption of the Youth
Program.

The Youth Program is the key to federal welfare

assistance to strikers.
Their program provides, specifically, that anyone
who is involuntarily unemployed, the term that's used in
Unemployment Compensation laws to bar strikers, and "who does
not refuse work for good cause ~ a term that’s limited to
physical disabilities or safety hazards — collects benefits.
And unless you are going to make an exception to
strikers, which is what New Jersey has done under their Youth
Program, then you are, under federal law, not eligible for
assistance; because "for good cause" does not include
participating in a labor dispute, unless you want to define
it that way.
What New Jersey has done is to finance federal
program, the Youth Program, when it had it, and define its
State programs, which it still has, consistent with the
regulations contained on page 129, which is to make a special
rule for strikers.
And that's what we're attacking.
QUESTION:

He said that HEW has agreed with that.

MR. COHEN:

HEW said:

we will approve any State

55

program, whether it pays strikers or doesn't pay strikers;
we're not going to at all get involved in the decision, under
Francis.
Now, incidentally, in Francis, the District Court now
has dissolved that injunction, since IIEW has passed new rules
which permit -- and permitted Maryland to go ahead and refuse
to pay strikers.
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:
MR, COHEN:

They either pay or not pay.
Either pay or not pay.
And so —
They said:

we're not going to get

involved in the constitutional question here, we're going
to let the States do whatever they want in this area.
QUESTION:

Right.

And that's the present regulation,

as I understand it, of HEW.
MR. COHEN:

That's correct.

They're contained in

the Appendix.
QUESTION:

So that what New Jersey has done, wrong as

somebody might think it is, is perfectly within its power to
do, so far as IIEW goes —
MR. COHEN:
QUESTION:

As far as HEW —
— and certainly so far as its own State

policy goes, and the only question is whether it's conceivably
unconstitutional, is violative of the equal protection clause,
or some other provision of the Constitution; or whether it is

55
invalid because of the federal labor legislation.

Isn't that

it?
MR. COHEN:

That's correct.

That's correct.

And what we're saying here comes down to this:
the federal labor law creates — has a policy of not having
governmental participation in strikes.

The federal welfare

lav/ has a policy of only providing money to those who are
involuntarily unemployed.
Those two statutes can be reconciled and harmonized
by not peiying welfare to strikers.
But if you go ahead and pay welfare to strikers,
then what you have done is interfere with the labor law and
deviate from the general policy of the welfare law.
That's a construction of the lav/ which serves the
purposes of neither Act, and conflicts with the purposes of
both.
QUESTION; Do you think there’s any need for the
State courts of New Jersey to determine whether the policy
of the State welfare authorities in Hew Jersey is consistent
with the State statutes?
MR. COHEN:

I don't think so.

The regulation has

been in effect in New Jersey since 1957.
QUESTION:

Nov/, your friend, speaking for New Jersey,

says that it was not a regulation but merely an attitude or
a policy.

57
MR. COHEN;

Well, I think it’s contained on page 129

of the Appendix, and it spells it out pretty clearly.
QUESTION:
interpret it.

Well, I know, but you want us to

Why should we interpret it?

MR. COHEN;

No, I don’t — because the regulation

is clear and concise and I don't think there's any •—
QUESTION: Well, that's your view of it.
MR, COIIEN:

Well, I don't think .it's open to any

possible interpretation, it's never been interpreted in any
other way.

It says specifically:

strikers get .welfare

benefits.
QUESTION:

I imagine the three-judge court

was

this a three-judge court?
MR. COHEN:

No, it was a single judge.

QUESTION:

A single judge.

MR. COIIEN:

Judge Kitchen in —

QUESTION:

Well, he's now dead, isn't he?

QUESTION:

Do you think it applies to legal and

Who was it?

illegal strikes alike?
MR. COHEN;

I think it applies to any strike that's

protected -** that's consistent with a strike under the National
Labor Relations Act.

It says:

QUESTION;

Well, it isn't protected --

QUESTION:

Well, the regulation doesn't say that.

A strike when lawfully authorized and conducted.

MR. COHEN:

I'm sorry, I neant — I meant ray

interpretation read in the regulations.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:
MR. COHEN:
get into.

Well, if it's not —
When is it lawful?

When is it lawful?

Well, that's what the State should not

The State shouldn't get into the policy of saying,

We’re going to pay some strikers but not other strikers? we’re
going to pay people who are lockouts but not in other kinds
of disputes.
That's the kind of decision that ought to be made
under federal labor law by the National Labor Relations Board
and not by State agencies.
I see my time is up.
Thank you.
HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:29 o'clock, p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
