PROCEEDINGS

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-1513, Con F. Shea against Ascension Vialpando.
Mr. Doane.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS D. DOANE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. DOANE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may It Please

the Court:
Colorado is here today to ask the Court to
assist Colorado to remove the federal courts from the
administration of the welfare program.
The facts of this case are that the Respondent,
Mrs. Vialpando, was working and receiving Aid

to Families

with Dependent Children, and she was provided certain work
expenses under the Social Security Act which requires that
the state agency, In determining need for Aid to Families
with Dependent Children, must take into consideration expenses
reasonably attributable to the earning of income.
The statutory language is not specific as to how
this Is to be done

and Colorado, prior to July of 1970, had

a policy which provided for consideration of employment
expenses by the itemization of each and every expense which
the welfare recipient had and under this system,
Mrs. Vialpando was able to reduce her income by a certain
amount of employment expenses and under the previous system

4
she was able to deduct approximately $l8l of her

income and

her income was about $28l per month so this made her
eligible and made her needy under the Colorado program.
After July of 1970, however, Colorado changed
its policy and provided for taking into the consideration
employment expenses, expenses reasonably attributable to the
earning of income by allowing deduction of mandatory deductions
from income, also a $30 flat allowance which was statistically
based and the way Colorado arrived at this $30 figure was to
take for a period of months, during 1969 and 1970 all of the
actual employment expenses of all of the recipients for Aid
to Families with Dependent Children and strike an average
and in our brief, in the Appendix, as indicated, these
figures range from about $32 to $36.
.Vi

Colorado, therefore, in its policies said, we
will strike an average allowance for employment expenses at
$30.
QUESTION:

I have a little trouble understanding

that as a matter or arithmetic.

If they ranged from $32 to

$36, why is the average $30?
MR. DOANE:

Well, the State of Colorado felt

that it was taking into consideration expenses attributable
to the earning of income by basing it upon what the employ­
ment expenses were and not using the actual figures.

In

both of the lower court decisions, they do not pass upon

5
whether the $30 is an actual sufficient amount or whether it
is statistically correct.

What they say, in the lower courts,

is that the state may not use •—
QUESTION:

I know that.

I know, and that is the

basic question, of course, in this case.
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:
a low of 32

Yes, your Honor.
I was just wondering why an average of

and a high of 36 turned out to be 30 in

Colorado because where I went to school it doesn't.
MR. DOANE:

It seemed to be sufficient, taking

into consideration of expenses reasonably attributable.
In other words, they based it upon that.

The

statute does not, In our opinion, say that you have to allow
what the actual average was.

It Is, I think, similar to

a case the Court had previously in Rosado versus Wyman, where
the Court found that you could use statistically-based
averages as long as they were fairly priced and that some
people would have an advantage by the use of that average,
other people would be disadvantaged.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't see how anybody could

come out ahead on this, frankly.

If it ranges from 32 to 36,

how does anybody gain when he gets 30?
MR. DOANE:

The person who gains is the person

who does not have the $30 of employment expenses.

This is

not actual payment of expenses up to a ceiling of 30;

6
regardless of whoever walked in, whatever their expenses
were, they got the full $30.
QUESTION:
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:

You mean some people have no expenses?
Some people —
As I understand it, those who do have

expenses, their expenses range from 32 to 36.
MR. DOANE:

Is that it?

No, this is the average figure,

your HOnor.
In our brief, or in the Appendix, rather, at
page 40 it is set out how the average was determined.

For

example, for the month of March 1969, the average per case
was $32.44.

Now, the very nature of an average would mean

that some persons would have expenses less than the average,
others would have expenses higher than the average.
QUESTION:
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:

Which page is this on?
Page 4l.
And your 32 to 36 range was at

different times?
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:
MR. DOANE:

Yes, your Honor.
And it was a range of averages?
A range of averages, that’s correct.
I see.
In other months, it would run 36.

The last one, April of 1970, ran 36.

But the state does not

claim that the $30 is all that a work-expense allowance

I
should be.

The State of Colorado is here today stating that

the statute does not prohibit the use of an average.
QUESTION:
MR. DOANE:

Right.
And the lower courts seemed to feel

that the statute —
QUESTION:

Did prevent the use of it.

been any change since this case was begun?

Has there

Has there been

any increase in the sum allowed?
MR. DOANE:

No, your Honor, it has not been

adjusted, but I would assume that it would have to be
adjusted upward with the cost of living.
QUESTION:

Umn hmn, but It still remains the same.

Incidentally, while I have already interrupted you, I
presuem you have a copy of the Solicitor General’s letter of
February 25th addressed to the Clerk of the Court?
MR. DOANE:

Yes,

your Honor, I do.

The federal statute in this case provides that
the states in determining need must take into consideration
expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of Income.
Reasonably attributable would seem to require that someone has
to decide how you determine what expenses are reasonably
attributable.
The federal regulations in this case are, both In
the Federal Register and in the form of handbook material
and circulars, this type of regulation, both of which we feel

8
are binding upon the state, mainly restate what the statute
provides.

There is some statement in the federal regulations

that certain items may be standardized but prior to the time
Colorado implemented this standard flat expense allowance.
The federal regulationss both the

Federal

Register regulations and the circulars allowed for the use of
a standard expense allowance.
Now, Mrs. Vialpando alleges that Colorado can
only only accommodate this requirement of the statute by
itemizing all expenses and that there is no other way to do
it.
As I mentioned previously, in Resado, the Court
did allow the use of standardizing and averaging as long as
the items in the average were fairly

priced.

The Court has also held in the welfare areas
and, recently, in the Dublino case, that the federal law is
to be looked at carefully and if there is not a specific
statutory requirement or if there is not a. condition of
elibility being added by the state, that the states do have
discretion in this difficult area and the courts are, the
lov/er courts, have been cautioned by this Court to not get
into the area of determining what might be, in its opinion,
the best way to administer the welfare program.
Colorado’s position is that this AFDC statute
is merely a setting out of the basic state plan requirements.

9
It doesn?t spe3.1 out every detail, period and
comma to have a program which complies with this statute but
there are other requirements in the statute that have to be
accommodated also.

One is that the states must, in a prompt

manner, determine eligibility and provide benefits to those
who are

eligible.
The determination of employment expenses only on

an item-by-item basis would have to be done every month for
every welfare recipient, not only to determine eligibility
but to determine the

amount of assistance and the cost of

administering this type of a determination would take a lot of
money from the actual benefits going to the welfare
recipient and use it up for administrative expenses.
QUESTION:
MR. DOANE:

Is that something that HEW requires?
HEW requires that the states must

promptly determine eligibility for assistance and the
amount of assistance.
QUESTION:
MR. DOANE:

Individual by individual.
No, your Honor.

Their position, as

stated in the Solicitor General’s Amicus brief, is that
averaging and standard employment allowances —
QUESTION:

I am talking about this letter that

Justice Stewart mentioned.
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:

The most recent letter?
Yes.

QUESTION:
his brief.

Which we must treat as a supplement to

I am sure you would agree, would you not?
MR. DOANE:

Yes, your Honor.

I think the letter — pardon?
QUESTION:

It takes a different position.

QUESTION:

It takes a different position but it

makes it even stronger than his brief.

His brief indicated

that back in 1964 the Secretary took the position that you
had to allow actual expenses when they exceeded the lump
sum and he now tells us that they determined that in 1964
that was not the practice.
That is the way I read this letter.
MR. DOANE:

Yes, your Honor, that is correct.

The Solicitor was advised by the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare that even that —
QUESTION:

Their reasoning doesn't affect the

practice here, does it?
MR. DOANE:

Well, yes, your Honor, it does.

We

are saying that at the time Colorado implemented the standard
employment allowance, it was permitted by HEW and that was
their Interpretation of the statute and this letter even goe3
further back, way back to 1964.
QUESTION:
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:

I understand.

I read the letter.

Yes, your Honor.
Mr. Doane, the fact notwithstanding,

11

that may have been the HEW position, there is still a question,
isn't there, of that may be their interpretation but the
language of the statute is, "As \*ell as any expenses
reasonably attributable to the earning of any such income."
So there still isn’t the question of conflict
between the standard allowance and the statute, even though
HEW apparently, from this letter, now, has approved the
standard allowance as satisfying that requirement.
Isn’t that so?
MR. DOANE:

Yes, your Honor.

The question before

the Court is, does the statute allow both HEW and the state
to standardize the allowances —
QUESTION:

That’s right.

MR. DOANE: —for instance, when this language
in the statute —
QUESTION:

Whether any expenses is satislfed by

standard allowance.
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:

Exactly, your Honor.
As I gather, this Respondent, her

actual expenses were $126.11, weren’t they?
And I gather1 that had been under the former
practice in Colorado, she had been allowed that, had she not?
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:

Yes, she had, your Honor.
Then I take it your point is that

any expenses means any expenses but the question is whether

12
the statute's requirement that you take them Into considera­
tion, require that you pay them all?
MR. DOANS:

Yes, your Honor.

That is exactly

correct.
QUESTION:

I mean, it does mean any, it means

just what it says.
MR. DOANE:

Any means any and any would mean all

and the language we think is most important is the first
part that says, "The State, in determining need —” and in
determining need, the State has always had large discretion
as to how they do this, "shall take into consideration," and
"take into consideration does not mean, "shall be ducked,"
because it
QUESTION:

For example, I suppose you say, under

that language you could just say, "We will take into con­
sideration and
90 percent."

allow half the expenses, or 10 percent or
Instead of that, you say we are going to have

a standard deduction.
MR. DOANE:

Well, I would question that type of

an allowance.
QUESTION:
MR. DOANE:

Why?
Because In that case you are not

really giving full consideration to the actual expenses.
QUESTION;
MR. DOANE:

Well, you are considering them.
It could be argued —

13
QUESTION:

You are considering them and, certainly,

for people above $30, you are not giving them full consider­
ation in the sense that you just spoke.
MR. DOANE:

Well, it depends how the state is

required by the statute to take into consideration expenses.
QUESTION:
MR. DOANE:

All right.
And the following section of this

statute, after the one that we are concerned with, talks
about, "And the state shall disregard certain income."
Now, If Congress had intended the state must
deduct all employment expenses, they could have vex-y easily
put this provision on deducting employment expenses down in
the next section which really says, "Disregard," which means
"deduct" to me.
The language is a lot different, "Take Into
consideration and deduct."
QUESTION:

While I have got you interrupted,

could I ask you — there was a constitutional claim in this
case, too, I take it?
MR. DOANE:

No, your Honor, it is strictly on

interpretation of statute.
QUESTION:

Well, I think there probably has to be

to get into federal court.
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION;

Yes, your Honor.
you didn't make any motion to dismiss

14
for jurisdictional grounds?
MR. DOANE:

Well, your Honor, I think pendent

jurisdiction would have allowed —
QUESTION:

Well, only if the constitutional

claim was worth something.
Now, the judge just moved to the statutory claim
directly, I guess.
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
There has never been any consideration

of whether there is federal jurisdiction here?
MR. DOANE:
QUESTION:
or would you?

Well —
You wouldn't suggest there would be -~

If there had only been a statutory claim

that there would have been federal jurisdiction?
MR. DOANE:

No, your Honor, I don't think we

would have.
QUESTION:

Did the complaint allege a

constitutional —
MR. DOANE:

Yes, it did.

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Page 14 ~ there was no consideration

given to it as to whether it was substantial or not?
QUESTION:

I think maybe that question should be

asked of the other side.
MR. DOANE:

Yes, your Honor, but if the Court is

15
interested in that area, the —It would appear3 then, that the federal statute
does provide the State of Colorado the option as to what
method

to select in determining and considering what

expenses are reasonably attributable and that the lower
court determination that there was no such discretion, that
there only was one

way to meet the requirement of the

statute, gave no effect to the words "reasonably attributable"
that the lower court should be reversed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Armour.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOM ¥. ARMOUR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ARMOUR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Please the Court:
In this case, we are concerned with a particular
section of the Social Security Act of 1935, in particular,
section 402(a)(7) and it is the Respondent’s position that the
question presented in this case is whether, consistent with
this section 402(a)(7), the State of Colorado may refuse to
take into consideration expenses of employment which are
reasonably attributable to earning of that employment but in
excess of a flat $30 per month allowance.
The controlling statute, your Honors, requires
states which participate in the AFDC program to disregard any
expense reasonably attributable to the earning of income.

16
The Colorado regulation permits the disregard of
$30 per month in addition to child-care expenses and
mandatory payroll deductions.
We believe it is also important to state what this
case is not about.

The Respondent is not arguing that

Colorado must allow unreasonable work expenses.

In fact, it

is our position that the states have a duty to inquire into
the reasonableness of work expenses both as to amount and as
to whether or not they are necessary for employment.
There cannot be a tenuous relationship between
the particular work expense and the particular job.
The State of Colorado made that inquiry prior to
July 1, 1970 and

determined that in this Ascension Vialpando’s

case, that she had reasonable work expenses in the amount of
$126.11 per month.
That has never been at issue.

But, however,

after July of 1970, the State of Colorado disregarded a flat
$30 per month and because the State of Colorado failed to
take into consideration $96.11 per month, Mrs. Vialpando,
finding it difficult to make ends meet, left the

job

market.
So, therefore, the question before the Court is
whether Section 402(a)(7) permits states to use flat
amounts based on statistical averages to determine work
expenses when the individual's work expenses exceed that

17
flat amount and we think that., properly, this analysis begins
first by looking to the text of the statute and trying to
determine its plain meaning.
And that statute says that a state plan must,
except as may be otherwise provided in Clause 8, provide that
the state agency shall, in determining need, take into
consideration any other income and resources of any child or
relative as well as any expenses reasonably attributable to
the earning of that income.
First of all, the word ''shall" is used.

It

mandates the state agency to look at both income and expenses
of the recipient.
QUESTION:

To "look at."

They did look at It,

didn't they?
MR. ARMOUR:

Yes, your Honor, and it is our

position that they did not look fully at those work expenses
and they failed to disregard reasonable work expenses that
were reasonably attributible to the earning of income.
It is not our position that they may simply look
at or take into consideration an average of work expenses.
They must disregard any expense as long as it is reasonably
attributable to the earning of income.
The statute, in fact, requires them to determine
need — to determine need in the individual case.
QUESTION:

Administratively

would there be any
9

18
point in determining the average and then allowing everyone
the average or approximately the average, including those
who had no expense at all, and then allowing supplements for
those who went above this hypothetical average?
MR. ARMOUR:

Well, your Honor, Judge Arraj in

the trial court asked whether it made any sense to allow
$30 per month to recipients who, in fact, had no expenses or
less than that.

But as far as administrative efficiency is

concerned, we would agree that the use of the flat amount
for all recipients based on a fair average, together with
the right of individual recipients to demonstrate an
entitlement of greater reasonable work expenses, would both
meet the goals of administrative efficiency and stay within
terras of the statute.
QUESTION:

Would it be administratively feasible,

given — if you know -— given the number of people involved,
to

allow $10 a month and then such additions as people could

demonstrate by vouchers or by whatever process they do it?
MR. ARMOUR:

Well, your Honor, this question of

administrative efficiency has never been actually litigated
In the courts below.

It has just been alluded to.

We are

not quite sure how much administrative efficiency, if any,
would be generated by the use of a flat amount.
I don't believe the State of Colorado could use
the figure of $10 per month because, as Mr. Justice Stewart

19
mentioned, three years ago in the State of Colorado, average
work expenses ttfere close to $37 per month.

We would maintain

that expenses have gone up since that time, so we wouldn’t
want to accept the use of the $10 per month.

But as to the

use of a flat amount, together with your right to demonstrate
an entitlement to a greater amount, we accept, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, could not the State of Colorado

constitutionally allow no expense except that which was
demonstrable by the same kind of evidence which this lady
has produced here?
MR. ARMOUR:

Your Honor, I think the State of

Colorado, by its participation in the ADC program, has to
follow this statute, (a)(7) and that statute requires both
the recipient to demonstrate an entitlement to each and every
expense and also, the State of Colorado to disregard each and
every expense as long as it is reasonably attributable to the
earning

of income, yes.
The words of the statute"take into consideration"

perhaps, in and of themselves, are flexible, as the Tenth
Circuit Indicated, but when you look at this particular
statute in its entirety, it takes on a particular meaning.
First of all,"take into consideration" modifies
the words "any other Income and resources."

The word "any"

is used to introduce "income and resources."
The State of Colorado and the Secretary of HEW

20

certainly don't put forth any averaging argument for outside
sources of income.

The state wants to take into consideration

every cent of outside income and they properly should.

ADC

is to be given to needy children and naturally, the state
should take into consideration any outside source of income.
You can’t average child support payments.

You certainly

can’t average the earnings of all employed recipients in the
State of Colorado.

You have got to take a look at each

individual’s outside income.
Wow, this statute goes on and adds an expense
section.

It is introduced by the words, "As well as."

We

think it reasonable to conclude that Congress intended work
expenses to be treated in the same manner and that is why
they used the phrase "as well as."
And this language requires any expenses to be
disregarded, not some, not an average, but any.

Section 402 of the Social Security Act in sub­
section

(a)(8), your Honors, uses the words "other than

any" when talking about the state’s option to set aside
earned Income for the future needs of the child.
In that part of the statute, Congress has said
that states may permit any — excuse me — all or any
portion of the earned income to be set aside.

I think this

demonstrates that Congress knows how to use specific
language and allow the states to disregard something less

21
than 100 percent.

In that part of the statute, they use the

words "any — all or any portion."
In our section of the statute, they use the word
"any."
In addition to the plain meaning of the statute,
which we think supports the Respondent’s position, we also
think that the legislative history

supports us as well.

Prior to 1962, when this part of the statute was
added, it was optional for states to disregard work expenses.
But the Senate Finance Committee, in reporting out the bill
which amended 402(a)(7), stated that it believed it only
reasonable for the states to take these expenses fully into
account.
QUESTION:

circuit
How many other/courts have given this

same interpretation?
MR. ARMOUR:

Your Honor, we believe that our

position is supported by decisions
QUESTION:
MR. ARMOUR:

There is no conflict, as I understand it.
Mo.

There is a decision in the

Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the Connecticut State
Department versus HEW, which we believe supports our position.
There

is

the decision In the Tenth Circuit and on

December 23, 1973, the Eighth Circuit, In Anderson versus
Graham,took the position that any expenses require states to
disregard all actual expenses, so we believe that there are

22

three circuit opinions in point, your Honor.
QUESTION:

Is that December 23 decision in your

briefs anywhere?
MR. ARMOUR:

Your Honor, I believe Anderson

versus Graham is set out in Appendix E to the Respondent's
brief.
QUESTION:
MR. ARMOUR:

Thank you.
Yes.

Mr. Justice Stewart has alluded in Petitioner's
argument to a letter submitted yesterday by the Solicitor
General.

Respondents would like the opportunity to that

letter in writing, briefly, if we may, your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, we will speak

to your friend, of course.
QUESTION:

May I ask what the tenor of the

response may be?
MR. ARMOUR:

Well, your Honor, we have not

carefully analyzed the contents of this letter, but we do
agree that, apparently, the Secretary of HEW is now taking a
position that they didn't take on October 4 when they filed
their original brief.
The letter goes to sections 3140 of the Handbook
and we simply think that they have misstated the
Secretary’s position.
QUESTION:

Mr. Armour?

23
MR. ARMOUR:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
At page 14 of your

Appendix, where the

complaint appears, apparently at paragraph 9, you had a
constitutional claim and you say "Section such and such of
the Colorado Manual of Public Assistance imposes an arbitrary
maximum on employment expense in violation of the Equal
Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment."
Your opponent was asked about that point.

Was

there any particular line of cases from this Court which you
were relying on for the proposition that that was a
constitutional violation?
MR. ARMOUR:

Your Honor, ma.y I first answer your

question by saying that Petitioner has correctly stated that
this issue was not ai’gued at any point.
QUESTION:

It Is jurisdictional though, I would

think.
MR. ARMOUR:
QUESTION:

Yes.
So if we were troubled by it, we would

have to address it here.
MR. ARMOUR:

Well, your Honor, our complaint was

filed under Title 42, Section 1983 and the jurisdictional
sections that

we relied upon were in 28 United States Code

Section 1343.

We believe that there is — there was at the

time and there remains a substantial constitutional question,
and that the Court had pendent jurisdiction to decide the

24
statutory issue and properly should have gone to the statutory
issue first but we don’t think that there is a rational
justification for steps from two classes of working welfare
recipients, those with less than $30 per month in expenses
and those with more than $30 in expenses.
I think we could establish clearly jurisdiction
In the trial court and I properly agree that the courts below
have also, because they have been able to decide this case on
the basis of the statutory issue, not gone to the
constitutional issue.
QUESTION:

Well, don’t they have to go to it at

least to assure themselves that it is not frivolous or
insubstantial?
MR. ARMOUR:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
Did you urge it at all upon Judge

Arraj ?
MR. ARMOUR:

Your Honor, at the time this action

was commenced, there was different counsel arguing the case
but from my best knowledge, the constitutional issue was
presented and we did, in fact, want to argue it.
Judge Arraj that simply took the statutory issue.

It was
But, yes,

your Honor, we did fully intend to argue that point.
QUESTION:

Well, did you press it upon him in

briefs or anything at all?
MR. ARMOUR:

Or orally?

Your Honor, it was done orally.

The

25

first time briefs were filed were in support of motion for
summary judgment which was considerably after the time of
filing the action, almost a year.
So it was not urged in the actual brief writing,
but it was urged orally before the court.
QUESTION:
it?

It is pretty important to you, isn't

Otherwise, your case
MR. ARMOUR:

goes out of court.
Yes, your Honor, it certainly is.

But we think there is a substantial constitutional issue
and that this Court, I believe, in Rosado versus Wyman,
which has been cited for other purposes before by Petitioners
states that this Court does have jurisdiction to decide
statutory issues raised along with claims of constitutional
violations.
QUESTION:

Was the jurisdictional question as

such brought to the attention of the District Court or to
the Court of Appeals?
MR. ARMOUR:
QUESTION:

To the District Court, your Honor.
Was the motion to dismiss for want of

jurisdiction?
MR. ARMOUR:

No, not a motion that was either-

filed or argued.
QUESTION:

And so how was it brought to the

attention of the District Court?
MR. ARMOUR:

At the time that Plaintiff went to

26
U.S. District Court in Denver to seek a temporary restraining
order enjoining enforcement of the regulations.

That

restraining order was not granted but the — I believe, your
Honor, the issue of jurisdiction was brought up at that point.
There was a hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction.
QUESTION:

Umn hmn, and I think your fellow

counsel may have some help for you there, on this question.
No?

Does the Appendix show that a question of jurisdiction

was brought to the attention of the District Court?
MR. ARMOUR:
QUESTION:

The Appendix, your Honor —
You have ansx^ered, if I understood it

correctly, that if there is a, colorably, a substantial,
constitutional claim, this statutory claim is pendent to it
and there can be no question of jurisdiction.

But on the

other hand, if the constitutional claim is frivolous, then
there is a very great question about whether there is
jurisdiction, under these jurisdictional statutes.
MR. ARMOUR:

Your Honor, we certainly think that

we have a substantial statutory argument, one that —
QUESTION:

I know, but that is not enough,

arguably.
MR. ARMOUR:

Yes.

But in addition, I mean, I

think it can be well-recognized that whether you have two
classifications of working welfare recipients, one with less
than $30 per month work expenses and another with more than

27
$30 per month

work expenses, 1 don’t see the reasonable —

you know, understand that classification,

I think we could

sustain and, in fact, have sustained the burden of presenting
a corable constitutional issue.
QUESTION:
don't mean to be
your answer.

And was that, again — I’m sure I

repititous, but I am not sure I understand

Was this question brought in any way to the

attention of either the District Court or the Court of
Appeals?
MR. ARMOUR:

Your Honor, it was brought to the

attention of the U.S. District Court judge at the time there
was a hearing to determine whether injunctive relief should
be granted.
QUESTION:

Does the Appendix reflect that fact

anywhe re ?
MR. ARMOUR:
QUESTION:

No, your Honor, I believe it does not.
The District Court opinion reported

on page 44 of the Appendix has a sentence saying that the
’’Respondent also raises constitutional questions which are not
under consideration at this time,"at the top of page 44.
Is that the opinion you were talking about?
MR. ARMOUR:

Yes, your Honor, that is the first

memorandum opinion, I believe, of the U.S. District Court.
QUESTION:
MR, ARMOUR:

Were they considered at a later time?
No, yDur Honor, they were not.

28
QUESTION:

Well, I gather footnote 4, Mr. Armour,

suggests that — or implies, at least, that Judge Arraj
thought that there may be enough for a convening of a threejudge court, but that, in your constitutional claim, but that
he wouldn't recommend that since the case could be disposed
of under statutory —
MR. ARMOUR:

Judge Arraj was the chief justice

of the District Circuit Court.
QUESTION:
a three-judge court

Yes.

But he said he couldn't convene

— or, would convene one, only if the

case can’t be disposed of under statutory grounds.
MR. ARMOUR:

I think, your Honor, that clearly

implies that he thought that the question wa3 presented.
QUESTION:
MR. ARMOUR:
QUESTION:

Was presented and justified —Yes.
— and in Goosby, last year, I guess

we set down the standard of what kind of constitutional
claims required the convening of a three-judge court.
MR. ARMOUR:
QUESTION:

Yes, your Honor.
And it was a non-frivolous or — I’ve

forgotten — it was rather broad language.
MR. ARMOUR:

Well, your Honor, we think we

certainly have a non-frivolous constitutional claim, as well
as a statutory argument that holds up under close analysis.
The use of averaging, we don’t believe it is

permitted either by the statutory language or the legislative
history.

Apart from the Secretary’s novel argument about the

hunter and canoeist, the only other argument that he had, in
essence was that this Court, in Rosado versus Wyman,
sanctioned the use of averaging.

We'd all believe that

Rosado stands for a blanket approval of averaging without
taking a look at the particular case and we think that this
action can be distinguished.
This Court, in Rosado, held that Section 402(a)
(23) had been violated by the State of IJew York in its
conversion from a system of special need grants to a system
of flat grants.
However, the Court did say that, in determining
standard of need, the states could use a fair averaging
process, but this Court, in Rosado, \tfas concerned with
Section (a)(23), not (a)(7).

There is nothing in (a)(23)

that requires states to meet all needs, just to make cost of
living adjustments periodically.
In contrast, (a)(7) requires specifically that
any expenses be disregarded.

As the Petitioners have

correctly stated, the states have traditionally had great
flexibility in determining standards of need.
This Court, in King versus Smith 397 to 392 U.S.,
made that very clear.

But we are not talking about a

hypothetical standard of need in this particular case.

We

30

are talking about Mrs. Vialpando’s actual work expenses.

And

even in Rosado. I believe that this Court stated that this
laudable goal of administrative efficiency may not be
furthered in such a way as to violate a specific statutory
command.

So for this reason, we do not believe that Rosado

is in point or sanctions the use of averaging in determining
work expenses.
In fact, what we believe that the State of
Colorado has done, with the Secretary's approval, has cut
into the incentive that Congress intended for welfare
recipients to go back into the

job market.

It may well be that what Congress did in 1962
was wrong.

We don’t think so.

However, if the Secretary of

HEW is actually convinced that administrative efficiency is
a more important policy than encouraging self-support and
helping parents of needy children and relatives claiming aid
to attain or retain the maximum capability for selfsufficiency then this argument should properly be addressed
to the Congress of the United States.
There have been a number of proposals since 1962
before the Congress to combine the work-expense disregard
found in

(a)(7) with the earned income exemption found in

(a)(8).
However, today, Congress has rejected those
arguments.

But that is a. proper forum for the Secretary of

31
HEW to take its argument.

We firmly believe that Congress

intended, by the enactment of (a)(7), to give recipients a
powerful and a meaningful incentive to go back into the job
market.
Mrs. Vialpando has tried on three occasions to
return to work.
Parents of needy children need to be able to
break their cycle of poverty and one way to do this, your
Honors, is to disregard all their reasonable work expenses
and for those reasons, we respectfully submit that the
judgment of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals should be
affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Armour.

Mr. Lennahan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES B. LENNAHAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LENNAHAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Please the Court:
I'd like to comment on several aspects that have
either been brought up by the Court or by Mr. Armour and I
might start with this situation that existed in July of 1970
when Colorado chose to change its method of taking into
consideration work expenses.
As Mr. Armour has suggested, prior to July, the
method involved an itemized treatment of work expenses for

32
each individual recipient.

The state’s position is that

Mrs. Vialpando did not have a vested right to that earlier
regulation, or to that method and that the state, as long as
they acted consistently with the Social Security Act and with
the requirements of HEW, could elect a more efficient or less
costly method to take work expenses into consideration.
And I would also like to bring out that we have
all, at the counsel side of the case, dwelt upon the $30
aspect of the work expense allowance but it should be noted
that the work-incentive purpose of the Social Security Act
was accomplished not only by the $30 work expense allowance,
but by the provision of the Colorado rules that permitted
the deduction of mandatory payroll deductions, such as state
taxes and social security and also, the actual cost of child
care was deducted from income in determining need.
So this work incentive in Colorado, after July
of 1970, consisted of this three-part work expense.
QUESTION:

How do you view the purpose of your

standard allowance rather than actual?
MR. LENNAHAN:

The purpose of the standard

allowance is largely to reduce the amount of time that an
individual eligibility technician at the county level has to
spend dealing with each case and there is a —
QUESTION:

Would the other way of doing it, going

to the actual expenses, also delay the starting of welfare?

33
MR. LENNAHAN:

Unless the staff was increased

considerably, we could anticipate that it would delay the
processing of the individual case.
QUESTION:

And, hence, the beginning of welfare

payments?
MR. LENNAHAN:
QUESTION:
tant, Mr. Lennahan.

Right.

There is a fact that may not be impor­
I noticed that there are

$63.80 or some

such thing allowed for the payments on this lady's car.
What happens when she has got the car paid for?
Is that disallowed?
MR. LENNAHAN:

Under the old rule, where v/e would

give itemized consideration, once she was no longer making
car payments, they xv'ould no longer be actual work expenses
and her work expense allowance would be reduced
QUESTION:

by that sum-

So, in effect, her claim now is that

capital expenditure is one that is properly taken into
account as an expense?
MR. LENNAHAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

The purchase of a car is, for these

purposes, a capital item, is it not?
MR. LENNAHAN:

Yes, your Honor.

This is another aspect that concerned us.

This

was an Individual decision in an individual case in El Paso
County, Colorado.

The same facts could have been presented

to an eligibility technician in another part of Colorado, who
would have made a decision on a rather subjective basis,
equally valid, saying that the car was a personal expense,
that a job was available closer to the home of the recipient
or that she could use public transportation.
This is another reason why Colorado prefers to
use a flat amount so that will be a more accurate and more
consistent determination in each case than is possible with­
out some type of numerical guideline on what is a reasonable
work expense.
I would also like to point cut that in connection
with the statistical tables that appear.in our

Appendix,

this may have been adequately brought out, but I would like
to specifically point out that each of the pages, '41(a) and
thereafter, consists of a printout of all of the Aid to
Families itfith Dependent Children cases in Colorado for the
particular month and Mr. Freeman, in his analysis on pages
^4 0 through 4l of the Appendix, took the items from the lefthand column of each of these computer printouts and pulled out
the general work expenses, the transportation expenses, he
excluded child care because that was going to be allowed
separately, took out union dues, tools, telephone and
computed a 100 percent average.
The people who had more than

$30 prior to July

of f70 are included in each of these printouts.

It’s a 100

35
percent

sample of the high as well as the low work expense

allowance cases.

So this is a primary part of our position

that a flat amount does take into consideration, not only
any type of expense, but also considers the specific amounts
that were being spent in Colorado by this class of
recipients.
Then I’d like to comment briefly on your question,
Mr. Chief Justice, on the — whether or not it would be
permissible for Colorado to have a $30 work expense
allowance and then, if a particular recipient wanted to
present evidence of expenses in excess of $30 —
QUESTION:

I thought my question was $10.

MR. LENWAHAN:

All right, $10.

This adds another

touch to it.
QUESTION:

It would keep it below the average.

MR. LENNAHAN:

Right.

What the state’s position

is In this case is that once the dollar amount is fixed by
a reasonable statistical basis, it could, if it wanted to,
pay in an excess of that average figure but it doesn’t
have to, that it is permissible under the Social Security
Act to stick with the flat amount and I think, as Mr. Armour
responded, the position of HEW and, I think., the state’s
response would be that if the flat amount is too low, this
would present a problem that we would then take up in the
district court.

36
QUESTION:

According to the Solicitor General's

letter of yesterday, at least as I read it, the next to the
last paragraph on page 2, he says, "Furthermore, we are
informed that no state plan containing a standard workexpense allowance has ever granted beneficiaries the
alternative of itemizing."
So if I understand that —
MR. LENNAHAN:
QUESTION:

Right.

— language, he is telling us that

no state has ever done this, adopted the suggestion implicit
in the Chief Justice’s question.
MR. LENNAHAN:
QUESTION:
a standard allourance.

Correct.

It is either an itemization or it is
None has ever combined it, as I

read this, no state has ever combined it.
MR. LENNAHAN:

I think that is true but, none

have ever done it.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. LENNAHAN:
I must apologize.

On the question of equal protection,

We dorft have the record with us today, but

it is my recollection that there is a pretrial order early
in the trial court record, where it was agreed by the counsel
at that time for Mrs. Vialpando and by state counsel that the
constitutional issue Xfould not be litigated in the case and
that, again, this is my recollection, that is the basis for

37
the footnote in Judge Roger’s opinion saying that the
constitutional question will not be taken up.
QUESTION:

Well, I don’t suppose the parties or

the judge can stipulate the jurisdiction.
MR, LENNAHAN:

I forget the exact text of the

pretrial order, but I would presume that the context was that
there was a constitutional question sufficient to give
pendent jurisdiction and then they proceeded to handle the
case on the statutory basis.
QEUSTION:
that?

Well, what is the significance of

Was it an agreement that they would not litigate It

and whoever loses on the statutory issue was not in a position
to raise it constitutionally?
MR. LENNAHAN:

No, I think Judge Arraj, In his

footnote —
QUESTION:

No, I know what he said but I want to

know about your stipulation that you — or the agreement that
you referred to.
MR. LENNAHAN:
the exact text.
We did not.

Well, as I said, I do not recall

We should have included it in the Appendix.

But I suggest to the Court that there is a pre­

trial order in there with a provision on the constitutional
issue which is the basis for that footnote In Judge Arraj*s
initial opinion.
QUESTION:

And. that provision may not be a

38
stipulation, but at least a tentative determination by the
judge that there was a nonfrivolous constitutional question
but let’s go on and decide the statutory one.
MR. LENNAHAN:

This is my recollection of what

happened.
If this Court was to raise the constitutional
issue, I believe the State of Colorado would be relying on
the case of Dandridge v, Williams and pointing out that there
was no invidious discrimination in the use of a flat amount.
We would point out that the rational basis for the use of a
flat amount would include such things as, it does encourage
employment.

It maintains an equitable balance, economically

between people who earn low salaries and are not on public
assistance programs as compared to people who are on public
assistance programs.
And it does serve a purpose of helping to allocate
public funds to serve a larger number of individuals.
Then I’d like to comment upon the fact that, I
believe it was reflected In our Appendix, that the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare has consistently permitted
the

use of average amounts, flat amounts for at least some

types of work expenses, both prior to and after the 19&2
statute that is being litigated here.
I believe our brief might be more helpful to the
Court if, on page 24 of the brief for Petitioners, after that

39
second full paragraph, a reference were Inserted to Appendix
F of the Amicus brief of the State of Colorado — or of the
State of California, I'm sorry, the Amicus brief of the State
of California follox^ed in this case.
I am suggesting a reference be inserted after the
second full paragraph.
QUESTION:

The one beginning, "The new

regulations"?
MR. LENNAHAN:

Yes, we are talking about new

regulations and then, this letter that I am referring to In
the California Amicus brief in Appendix P is a letter from the
Cpmmissioner, a memorandum from the Commissioner of the
Social and Rehabilitation Service, indicating that the Hand­
book sections that had been previously utilized we're obsolete.
Because I think that bears upon the consistency of the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare's interpretation
of the statute —
QUESTION:

Was your page reference to the

California brief?
MR. LENNAHAN:

It is Appendix P.

It would be on

page 29 in their Appendix.
QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. LENNAHAN:

Because it is really not

completely clear what the legal effect of the Handbook is,
we are suggesting to the Court that the — and really, I think

40
this is why the State of Colorado is here.

Mr. Doane was

saying the State of Colorado looked at the Social Security
Act, back in 1970, looked at the federal regulations
published in the Federal Register, looked at the letter
dated September 29th of 1969 from the Commissioner of the
social and rehabilitation service and that letter is printed
on page 7 of the joint Appendix, clearly permitting the use
of a flat work expense allowance.
Against this — another thing I think that is
involved here is that there is really no apparent legal
difference between this September 26, 1969 letter in the
joint Appendix on page 7 and the circular that was involved
in the case of Thorpe versus the Housing Authority

of Durham.

True, the circular in the Durham case v/as a
mandatory requirement.

In this case, it provides an option.

But we are suggesting to the Court that the exercise of the
discretion of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare
is indicated by this letter and should be given effect by
this Court.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Lennahan.

Thank you,

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case Is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:34 o’clock a.m., the case
was submitted.]
