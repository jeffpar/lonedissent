We will hear arguments

next in Mo. 73-786, Ross and North Carolina against Moffitt.
Mr. Safron, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACOB L. SAFRON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SAFRON?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
This case is before the Court upon a petition for
writ of certiorari to the Fourth' Circuit Court of Appeals, to
review that question

reserved by this Court in its opinion

in Douglas vs. California.
That is, whether or not the Constitution mandates
the requirement of counsel to be appointed for indigent
defendants to seek discretionary review.

That is, discretion

review from the highest court of a State to this Court, and
to the highest court of a State in those States which have
multi-tiered appellate systems.
In the consolidated Moffitt cases, the Fourth
Circuit reached the conclusion that the issue reserved in
Douglas should be answered in the affirmative, although all
courts which had reviewed the question prior to Moffitt had
answered this question in 'the negative.
The Fourth Circuit drew an analogy between the
North Carolina appellate system and the Virginia appellate

4
system, and, by drawing this analogy, found the North Carolina
system to be inadequate,
We argue that this analogy is itself faulty.
State of Virginia there is no appeal as of right.

In the

All review

in the Commonwealth of Virginia is by writ of error to the
Supreme Court of Virginia.

And counsel is appointed, I’m told

by the Fourth Circuit, to represent all petitioners seeking a
writ of error to the Supreme Court of Virginia? and that the
Supreme Court of Virginia accepts enough cases to keep the
law of the Commonwealth of Virginia current.
In North Carolina -QUESTION:

There's no intermediate appellate court

in Virginia?
MR. SAFRON; None at all, Your Honor.

Nor are there

any appeals as of right in Virginia.
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON;

Unh-hunh,
Now, that is the Virginia system.

Counsel is appointed to seek the writ of error to the Supreme
Court of Virginia.
QUESTION; We're talking about criminal cases only
here.
MR, SAFRON;

Oh, yes, Your Honor, we're talking

about criminal matters here.
QUESTION;

Only.

MR, SAFRON; And I'm advised that in the State of

5

Virginia, the writ of error, if it's denied, is summarily
denied.

There is no briefing, there is no opinion.
Now, in the State of North Carolina —
QUESTION:

Does Virginia have a full court

situation?
MR. SAFRON:

I really can't speak for -the State of

Virginia, Your Honor.

I'm told that it is possible, and

this is according to the Fourth Circuit, that oral argument
can be had by the attorney for the petitioner in support of
his petition, but —
QUESTION:

I just wondered, does it take a majority

vote of the Supreme Court of Virginia?
MR. SAFRON:

To reject,

I have to plead ignorance on that

fact, Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:
a multi-tiered system.

How about in North Carolina, is it —
All right, in North Carolina we have
We have the North Carolina Court of

Appeals, and we have the Supreme Court of North Carolina.
Appeal is as of right from the trial courts to the North
Carolina Court of Appeals, except in a case in which the
sentence is death or life imprisonment, and in that case the
appeal is of right to the Supreme Court of North Carolina.
QUESTION; Directly?
MR, SAFRON:

Direct appeal as of right.

If the

sentence is death or life imprisonment, you bypass the Court

6

of Appeals and go to the Supreme Court.
All other cases, appeal is as of right to our Court
of Appeals.
In each one of these cases, counsel is appointed.
In each one of these cases, a full record is
prepared.
In each one of these cases, a full brief is prepared
oral arguments are had, and an appeal is filed by the Court of
Appeals or the Supreme Court, as the case may be.
QUESTION:

You mean an opinion?

You said an

appeal is filed by —MR. SAFRON:

Oh, I’m sorry.

What I meant, Your

Honor, we have a full appellate system, and there's full
record filed, briefing, oral argument, and at the conclusion
the applicable court, either the Court of Appeals or the
Supreme Court, files its written opinion.
So the first question we're confronted with —
QUESTION:

May I just ask -- to go from the Court of

Appeals to the Supreme Court on an application, what do you
call it there, cert?
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

Petition for writ of certiorari,
Petition for writ of certiorari.

Is

there any situation of appeal of right on a division in the
Court of Appeals?
MR, SAFRON:

Yes, Your Honor, that is one of the two

7
instances.
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

Yes.
One, a dissent in the Court of

Appeals permits an automatic appeal; two —
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

Of right.
Of right.
Yes.
And, two, if there is a substantial

question presented under either the Constitution of the United
States or of the State of North Carolina.
These are the two instances in which there is an
appeal as of right.

And all other instances, the appeal is

purely discretionary by petition for writ of certiorari.

r

QUESTION: And how many votes dees it take to greint
in the Court of Appeals — I mean in the Supreme Court?
MR. SAFRON;

I must, admit, Your Honor, I never even

thought about that question in North Carolina, because —
QUESTION:

Because what you've been describing is

the system with which I'm familiar.

That's exactly the New

Jersey system, except that it takes three votes of the seven
of the Justices of the Supreme Court to grant review on what
we call a petition for certification, rather than petition
for certiorari.
MR. SAFRON:

I must admit that. I never fchought

about that in North Carolina.

All my discussions with members

8

of the court have never really raised that question.
Now, of course, the Moffitt case goes beyond that»
So Hoffitt says that the issue reserved in Douglas requires,
as a matter of right, that counsel be appointed in all cases
from the Court of Appeals to seek certiorari to the Supreme
Court of Worth Carolina.
QUESTION:

Was Moffitt's case one which could have

been appealed as of right?
MR. SAFRON;
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON;

No, Your Honor, —
From the Court of Appeals.
— I don't believe so at all.

I have

that discussed in our brief, and I believe it's conceded by
the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that there are no questions,
there was no dissent and no substantial constitutional question
involved.
Now, the —QUESTION;

Mr. Safron, before you go on, who makes

the decision as to whether or not there is a substantial
question of federal or State constitutional law?
MRS SAFRON;

That, of course, Your Honor, makes the

distinction whether or not it's an appeal as of right, which
wotild require briefing,- or certiorari which can be
summarily
QUESTION;
MR, SAFRON;

No, I'm thinking about certiorari.
We have no guidelines, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION;

Well, somebody must make that decision.

Does an intermediate appellate court make it?

Or does the

Supreme Court of North Carolina make it?
MR. SAFRQH;

If tile court, upon review of petition,

determines that it is a matter of right, then of course counsel
is appointed for full briefing and oral argument.
I have to admit, I don’t believe we have any firm
guidelines,
QUESTION;

You think there's no certification by

the intermediate appellate court.
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

There is none, Your Honor.
Right.

MR. SAFRON: The only certification that truly
exists is the certification based upon a dissent which
triggers the appeal as of right,
QUESTION: Well, I suppose a person could appeal
asserting, asserting that an important or substantial, or
whatever your words are, question of federal or State
constitutional law were involved, and then it’s up — might be
up to the Supreme Court of North Carolina to decide whether
or not it was,
MR. SAFRON:

Your Honor, this is the typical

catechism of these cases.
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

Right,
In fact, in the case from Guilford

10

County in which Mr. Moffitt was represented by the Public
Defender at trial, on appeal to the Court of Appeals and the
Supreme Court, you will find that that is the note appended
to the Supreme Court's denial of cert, that there's no
substantial constitutional question involved in the petition,
and the purported appeal is denied»
QUESTION: And that's where the decision is made,
I suppose, isn't it?
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

That's right.
The assertion is made by the appellant,

and the decision is made by the
MR* SAFRON: By the Court.
QUESTION:

~~ Supreme Court:

No, you're mistaken,

there isn't a substantial constitutional question.
But possibly they might go on to say, However, we’ll
consider this as a

what do you call it — motion to

certify or •*—
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

Petition for writ of certiorari*
~ petition for writ of certiorari.

We

will grant it because there's an evidentiary question involved
here.

Or something like that.
Could that happen?
MR. SAFRON: Well, the criteria for certiorari are

also scheduled in our brief, and the situation there is whether
or not it appears to be in conflict with an opinion of the

il
Supreme Court, or whether or not it’s an issue of Statewide
importance»
QUESTION: Right.
MR. SAPRON:

The same criteria which this Court

uses in making its determinations of whether or not to grant
certiorari.
QUESTION:

I suppose if there is a lawyer, he'll

both -- he'll denominate his pax>ers both in appeal and,
alternatively, a petition for writ of certiorari.
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

Or he will file both.
Separately?
Yes, Your Honor.

Quite often the

attorney will file both the petition seeking discretionary
review -■-*
QUESTION: And an appeal.
MR. SAFRON:
right.

~~ and an appeal, claiming it's as of

And we have to respond to both*
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

QUESTION;

Who decides it in the court — I'm still

not certain? maybe you can answer — in the Supreme Court,
does one judge, two judges, the whole court, or what?
MR* SAFRON:

Your Honor, whether or not to grant

certiorari is determined in conference, and the number of
justices of the seven who would have to vote on it is a
number I'm unaware, and I don't believe it's ever been
4 b

12

released outside of the doors of the conference room»
Perhaps if we inquired, we might be told? but it's
not a matter of common knowledge at all.
QUESTION:

And so we don't know who determines this

question as to whether there's a substantial question there,
MR. SAFRONs Well, that is determined by the court
in conference, Your Honor; but I just cannot respond to the
number of the seven justices who are required to vote to
bring up certiorari,
QUESTION;

Well, in these cases where there is

assertion of a substantial constitutional question, on appeal
from the

or whatever it is •— from the Court of Appeals

to the Supreme Court, in a criminal case, where the assertion
is made of a substantial federal question, if true that would
be an appeal of right —
MR, SAFROM:
QUESTION;
MR. SAFRON;

Yes, Your Honor,
-- is counsel provided?
If the court determines that it is a

substantial —
QUESTION;

Well, how about the preparation of the

— whether it would be on appeal?
MR„ S/iFRON;

We've had a -- up till now there's

been confusion in the matter, Your Honor.

The trial judges

have been unable to really determine what our statute meant,
and idle Administrative Office of the Courts had not provided

13

them with guidelines.

So determinations were made on an ad

hoc basis , to find a schedule of all the petitions that are
listed in the front of each volume of the North Carolina
Court of Appeals and Supreme Court.

All the petitions are

scheduled, and it's a good number of petitions which are
scheduled there.
Now, we go beyond the State question, because the
Fourth Circuit then held that there is also a constitutional
^ v

right to the appointment of counsel to come from the highest
State court in which review may be had. to this honorable
Court, and that this, too, is a constitutional right.
QUESTION: This v?ould be even in casas where the
North Carolina Supreme Court refused certiorari?
MR. SAFRON;
is the very case.

Yes, Your Honor.

The — in fact that

The Moffitt case from Guilford County,

he was represented by counsel to the Court of -- to the
Supreme Court, by a Public Defender, and counsel was not
then provided

oh, excuse me -- and in that case the

Supreme Court entered an order that there was no substantial
constitutional question.
And in that case, the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals held that he was denied his right to counsel to seek
a petition for a certiorari to this Court.
QUESTION:

Does the North Carolina criminal

defendant get his right to petition for certiorari to this

14
Court from a North Carolina statute or from an Act of Congress?
MR. SAFRON: Well, from an Act of Congress, Your
Honor.
QUESTION: So it's no right the State confers on him?
MR* SAFRON:

Oh, none at all.

But the Fourth

Circuit found that this is a constitutional right, and I
think taking a simplistic approach to the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION;

You said that there was an Act of

Congress?
MR. SAFRON: Well, the jurisdictional srtatute,
Your Honor, which establish review and -QUESTION:

Oh, I’m sorry, I thought my Brother

Rehnquisfc was asking you about appointment of counsel,
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

Oh, no, I believe ~~
No, the certiorari jurisdiction —
The certiorari jurisdiction of this

Court, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Oh, yes.

Right.

MR. SAFRON: And so —
QUESTION:

Now that you're interrupted, if I may-

ask one other question about North Carolina practice.
Is there an argument ever on the papers on appeal or petition
for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of North Carolina?
MR. SAFRON:
argument.

No, Your Honor, there is no oral

The oral argument is had once certiorari is

15

granted*
QUESTION;

Only if there's a grant?

MR, SAFRON;
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor»
Similar to this Court?

MR, SAFRONs Exactly, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

The system you have described is almost

identical to that of my State of Ohio, except that in Ohio
there is a 15-minute argument on the motion, what we call a
motion to certify.

You don’t have that?

MR. SAFRON: Ue have no oral argument in the Supreme
Court on a petition for writ of certiorari.
OUES TION:
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.
And is the denial of a writ deemed a

matter of substance, or is it just ignored?

Does it create

any precedent?
MR, SAFRON: The only precedent. Your Honor, would
be an exhaustion of State remedies, so it's going to federal
habeas corpus.
QUESTION:

Yes, but on a — does anyone ever argue

that the denial of certiorari is a legally significant
matter in some subsequent case?
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

It’s the equivalent of a —
I've never heard that, Your Honor.

I've never heard that argued in that regard.
QUESTION:

Unh-Vnunh.

16
MR. SAFRONs

Mow, we go, of course, on this

question to this Court, and I would submit that the analogy,
the easy analogy dram between Virginia practice and North
Carolina practice fails upon an analysis.
I would further argue this, that of all the cases
decided by this Court up till now have not automatically and
directly gone to the Fourteenth Amendment.

That in Kirby,

the Kirby case, this Court held that the right to counsel at
a pre-indictment lineup wasn't constitutionally required
because a pre-indictment lineup was not a critical stage of
the proceeding,
Similar3.y in the Simmons case, this Court held, that
counsel was not required at a photographic lineup, because a
photographic lineup was not a critical stage of the
proceeding.
What we have here, the Fourth Circuit has now
characterized a petition for writ of certiorari as a critical
stage.

Because I would argue that the predicate upon which

tdie right to counsel is based is a previous determination
that this is a critical stage of the proceeding.
And 1 believe that is not possible to characterize
a discretionary review by petition for writ of certiorari as
a critical stage.

That discretionary review and critical

stage are words which are not compatible.
To further characterize why it is not a critical

17

stage, the denial of a petition for writ of certiorari by
this Court has always been stated not to be of any significance
in the use by -this Court.
Furthermore, the seeking of a petition for writ of
certiorari is not a necessary prerequisite to the exhaustion
of available State remedies as a prerequisite to going into
federal habeas corpus.
QUESTION:

Of course the denial of certiorari

may be of no precedental significance in this Court, but
it certainly is of significance to the litigant that
petitioned and then lost,
MR. SAFRONs To the litigant, yes, Your Honor.
But to the criminal defendant, I don’t believe it's of any
significance, because the denial of cert is of no significance,
failing to seek certiorari is of no significance, because the
criminal defendant can immediately go into federal habeas
corpus.

Or

into State post-conviction.

We have a very complete State post-conviction
remedy in North Carolina, with the appointment of counsel,
with the appointment of counsel to seek certiorari from our
Court of Appeals, which reviews post-conviction matters; and
thorough review can also be had of constitutional questions
by, one, State post-conviction matters, where there is
counsel as of right, —
QUESTION:

You don't entertain matters in collateral

18
proceedings if an issue has been raised on direct appeal?
And actually decided.
MR, SAFRON; We have a case, State vs , Wh 1 te, which
says we don’t.

But, as a practical matter, most superior

court judges will review the question.
QUESTION s

Even after your Supreme Court has

decided it?
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON s

Yes, Your Honor.
My heavensi
But then again we have the complete

federal —
QUESTION;

But the federal court wouldn't insist

on utilizing your collateral remedies if the issue has been
raised and decided on direct appeal?
MR. SAFRON; No, there would be no — the federal
judges would not require that for exhaustion if the issue has
been raised and decided.

But there is a complete federal

remedy, by writ of habeas corpus, and there is no preclusion
from seeking this remedy by the failure to seek certiorari.
And I would argue this, that more complete review
can be had of the record in the case in a petition for writ
of habeas corpus in the federal district court, in which the
judge reads that entire record, in which an opinion is written
in each and every case, than can be had by the petition for
writ of certiorari to this Court.

19

1 don’t roean to say anything which might sound
slanderous, but the orders of the district court which review
the contentions in detail are more meaningful than the denial
of the petition for writ of certiorari by this Court, as this
Court is aware.

The last figures I saw was 3»3 percent of

all petitions for writs of certiorari filed in forma pauperis
are granted.

Statements of this Court have said that 96

percent of such petitions are frivolous.
Wow, if we are going to say that counsel is
required, what we're doing, first of all, is turning the
pyramid which has been accepted in the past, cases funneling
up, filtering up to this Court.
QUESTION:

You're addressing yourself now just to the

writ in this Court, I take it, not to the Supreme Court of
North Carolina?
MR. SAFRON: This Court, yes.
Up till now historically we've considered the
appellate system a filtering system, and the figures I've
seen, approximately 70 cases per week are filed here, about
4500 a year.

And the cases filter up.

Wow, if we are to follow the Fourth Circuit's
re asking that the appointment of counsel is constitutionally
required in each and every case, to seek certiorari from this
Court, we take that judicial pyramid, we open it wide, and
we turn it more into a flood pipe, where this Court will then

20

become the ultimate reviewer of each and every conviction
affirmed in the appellate courts of the United States.
QUESTIONS

The —

You mean the State courts in the United

States, do you not?
MR. SAPRONs
QUESTION;

Oh, yes, Your Honor.
1' don't follow that.

Whether or not we

would grant cert doesn't depend on whether or not the
petitioner is represented by an attorney.
MR. SAFRON; But the Fourth Circuit has said, Your
Honor, that he has a constitutional right to the appointment
of counsel to seek certiorari from this Court,
QUESTION;

Yes„

MR. SAFRON; And so, if you have a constitutional
right, just like the other constitutional .rights where you
have a right to counsel, you have that right unless you freely,
binderstandabiyf and voluntarily waive that right,
QUESTION;

No, no, no, but you're not arguing

•that we have to hear the case —>
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION;

No,
-- because he has a constitutional right,

if he does.
MR, SAFRON;
QUESTION;

No.

Hardly.

But I'm saying --

I think that you're ax*guing that instead

of 4,000 more or less, we might have a great many more,
MR. SAFRON;

I’m arguing, Your Honor, that the

21

factor by which cases would — filings would multiply in
this Court would probably be in the nature of three to four
within the next two terms*
QUESTION;

But wouldn't we be in better shape if

we had an opinion of the Supreme Court of North Carolina?
MR* SAFRON:

Of course, Your Honor, this case had

never come through that procedure.
QUESTION; Well, if the Supreme Court had taken it.
And decided it.

Wouldn't we have been in better shape than

to get it without an opinion of the Supreme Court of the
State?
MR. SAFRON;
QUESTION;

Of course, Your Honor, —•
If you

want to help us out, maybe that

would help.
MR. SAFRON;

The Fourth Circuit has disregarded

questions of State law.
here.

We don't have State law questions

The Fourth Circuit disregarded that and went directly

to the Federal constitutional issue, and determined that as a
matter of constitutional right the appointment of counsel is
mandated.
QUESTION;
separate two points.

Well, I can understand ~ I'm trying to
Why couldn't, one, he have counsel in

the Supreme Court of North Carolina, have an appeal as a
matter of right, and have an opinion as a matter of right?
MR. SAFRON;

if Your Honor please, we have a multi”

22

tiered system.
Now, the very idea of establishing our Court of
Appeals in 1968 was to take the work load off the Supreme
Court of North Carolina, to permit it to have discretionary
review and not be bogged down to review each and every
conviction.
Now, to follow through with Your Honor's suggestion,
the Supreme Court of North Carolina is back where it was.
it now is burdened to review each and every conviction.

We

might as well do away with our Court of Appeals, because they
won't really serve a function.

And that was the idea when

we established the Court of Appeals.
Appeal of right to the Court of Appeals —*
QUESTION:

You established it in order to get away

from the Supreme Court having automatic appellate jurisdiction.
MR. SAPRON:

Well, in the first instance, prior to

the change, our Supreme Court did have, as a matter of right
— well, all appeals were as a matter of right to our Supreme
Court and they were totally ova worked.
QUESTION:

Was that not substantially the same as

the passage of the so-called certiorari bill in 1925, with
reference to this Court?
MR. SAPRON:

Exactly, Your Honor.

The idea was

to give the court discretionary review and remove the
requirement that the Justices of the Supreme Court, who are —-

23

QUESTION;

Mr. Safron, I'm just puzzled.

I don't

understand — assuming the Fourth Circuit were affirmed,
why does this mean that the Supreme Court of North Carolina
has to decide more of these criminal cases on the merits,
which I gather they don't when they refuse certiorari.
Now, why does the appointment of a counsel to
prepare a petition for certiorari mean that there is going
to be that much more for the North Carolina Supreme Court to
decide cn the merits?
MR. SAFRON %

Your Honor, the question — when I was

answering Mr. Justice Marshall's question, I don't think I
was answering that question.
Of course, any time, that there is an additional
Workload, it diminishes the time available by an appellate
court to do other matters.

Were this Court to hold here that

counsel is constitutionally required from the highest State
appellate courts to this Court, and if the filings increase at
what would probably be a geometrical rate-, I would submit
til at the Justices of this Court would have less time to
consider the matters which they believe to be of real merit,
and would probably so super-saturate the functioning of this
Court —
QUESTION: Well then, you must — I gather what you
must be arguing, then, is that if there is a constitutional
right to a counsel, that counsel must prepare a petition for

24
certiorari.
MR» SAFRONs
Fourth Circuit says.

Yes, Your Honor, that's what the
That's what the Fourth Circuit said,

Nov/, there is another point I'd like to make —
QUESTION;

Incidentally, while I have you inter­

rupted, did the Fourth Circuit say that counsel provided in
the manner that the court said he constitutionally had to be
provided, also say that the State had to pay him for his
services?
MR. SAFRON:

Yes, Your Honor,

QUESTION; Said it in so many words?
MR. SAFRON:

Well, let's say this —■ they didn't

say it in so many words, but they said the State has to
appoint; and if the State must appoint, —
QUESTION;

Well, I know North Carolina — I think,

does it not — ordinarily compensates attorneys -—
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION;

Your Honor, this —
>— hot only at trial on direct review,

but also on your State post-conviction —
MR. SAFRON:

Yes, Your Honor.

In fact, this year our General Assembly has
appropriated $3,230,000 for the appointment of counsel for
indigent defendants.

And I would submit that a figure in

excess of three and one-quarter million dollars for one year
certainly illustrates our good faith.

25

In closing,, because I see my time is short, I'd
like to say this :

that tine Fourth Circuit has directed the

issuance of a writ of habeas corpus in this case to secure
floffitt's release from custody*

Because the Fourth Circuit

found that his constitutional right to the appointment of
counsel has in fact been violated.
Now, if this were to be retroactively applied, and
counsel have been appointed in so few cases, we would be
opening wide the doors to most penitentiaries, because the
States have not appointed counsel to seek review in this
Court.
Additionally, I point out tinis, that there would be
a floodtide of post™conviction hearings and a floodtide of
federal habeas corpus hearings to determine whether or not
any question which might have been reviewed in this Court
was presented.
QUESTION:

Nr. Safron, what's the posture of that

mandate, did we stay it?
MR. SAFRON;

It was stayed by the Fourth Circuit,

Your Honor.
QUESTIONs

I see.

Very well.

MR, SAFRON; And so, Your Honor, it is our contention
that the Fourth Circuit’s determination in this case is not
founded in law nor required by the Constitution.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Anderson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS B. ANDERSON , JR., ESQ.,
»

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ANDERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Gideon and Douglas are now a little over ten years
old.
in

Since their decision, the principle, that fundamental
due process and equal protection, .is that in trial and

on appeal an indigent defendant must have counsel appointed
for him if he cannot afford it.
And that principle has been expanded or further
delineated to hold that the right is not diluted by the
nature of the offense so long as imprisonment is threatened,
or by the age of the defendant? for instance, in juvenile
cases.
As Mr. Safron pointed out that right attaches at the
beginning or at the issuance of formal adversary proceedings,
usually by indietment»
Now, the question which we have before us today is
whether or not, after the right accrues, and further along
in the adversary process, whether or not the right
diminishes or disappears.
Or, to be put another way, whether or not the right
attaches according to the nature of the court, or haw far
along the adversary process the court might happen to be.
In 1969 the Tenth and Seventh Circuits decided that

27

indeed the right to counsel stopped after the first appeal,
the courts there limiting their decisions to the facts in
Douglas y
More recently, however, the Fourth Circuit and now
the Sixth Circuit find that the right does continue on
throughout the adversary proceedings.
This Court is already familiar with the background
of the case, how it arrived in this particular Court.
In the Mecklenburg case, the defendant received a
letter from his attorney, stating that after his first appeal,
that he had approached the Superior Court, the trial court in
our State, and had been informed that he no longer could
represent him because there was no longer the right to
counsel.
Thereupon, the right to counsel in that particular
case ceased.
In the Guilford County case, the Public Defender
in that County represented the defendant and carried it
through discretionary review in the North Carolina Supreme
Court, but did not carry it to this Court.
We have before us today — perhaps it is better to
define what we do not have before us.

We are not deciding,

or this Court is not going to decide, nor has to decide,
whether right to counsel exists before or after the
adversary process begins or ends.

28

QUESTION;

Well, what do you mean by the adversary

process, Mr» Anderson?
MR, ANDERSON; The Kirby decision, Mr. Justice
Rehnquist, delineates that the right to counsel accrues when
the adversary, formal adversary proceedings are instituted
by indictment or warrant.
QUESTION;

Are you suggesting, for instance, that

federal habeas is not part of the adversary process?
MR. ANDERSON; Well, it's adversary in nature, it's
not —" it doesn't emanate from the actual accusation, the
trial? it's an attack, in fact, that's civil in nature as
viewed by the courts, and is the defendant's attack upon his
conviction, rather than the other way around.

He's defending

in what I term the adversary procedures on direct review»
But federal habeas corpus, I think is a little bit
different nature, even though it does involve the adversary
process, it is not the criminal process, because the defendant
is already convicted, his judgment is final.
And it's that particular judgment he’s in fact seeking
to overthrow.
So we're not asking for counsel on post-conviction
or federal habeas corpus? although, on many occasions, they
are appointed.
QUESTION;
clarify it for me;

Let me ask you, to see if this will
Suppose you went through all the tiers

23

that are provided by your State, the trial court, the Court
of Appeals, the Supreme Court, and then you go into the
federal District Court on habeas corpus, and you're still
losing, and so you take an appeal to the Court of Appeals,
and then, at that stage, the man runs out of money, no longer
can finance an appeal or a petition for cert; then, under the
Fourth Circuit holding, is it —* who is required, if anyone,
to provide counsel to prepare a petition for a writ of
certiorari to this Court?
MR, ANDERSON;
QUESTION;

On habeas corpus?

Unh-hunh,

Coming up through the Court

of Appeals, the federal Court of Appeals.
MR. .ANDERSON:

I know of no provision other than

the Criminal Justice Act, and that Act provides that once
counsel is appointed by the Fourth Circuit for argument
xn the Fourth Circuit, that the attorney shall not abandon
his client, that if he wins that he shall ™- and petition for
certiorari is made by the opposita side, he shall answer
the petition and shall continue in the case until this Court
either relieves him or further appoints him.
QUESTION:

Nov;, in my hypothetical illustration,

the man has had five tiers of the judicial process, State and
federal, and your position is that he must be provided with
free counsel to prepare a petition here?
MR. ANDERSON;

No, Your Honor,

30

QUESTION ;

Oh, I thought — I misunderstood you,

MR, ANDERSONt

No, that is — that is what I would

term a collateral proceeding as opposed to direct review,
where the defendant has had his conviction affirmed by an
intermediate appellate court, and seeks discretionary review
by the highest State court, or discretionary review by this
Court after failing to gain either review or reversal in
the highest State court.
QUESTION;

You're carving out these last two

stages, because it's not direct review and it's partly, I
gather, because you view it as a civil action in forma
pauperis,
MR. ANDERSON:

Well, traditionally, it has been

viewed as civil in natu.re, and they are not direct review;
although the courts have used their discretion to appoint
counsel in particular cases where they are needed.
Indeed, that's not what I'm arguing.

Here the

judgment isn’t final, so to speak, until the final appellate
court has made their decision, either to review it or to
affirm, or to reverse.
QUESTION:

To the extent that Douglas is based on

the equal protection clause, the idea that if the State grants
a right of appeal, it has to make it equally available to
everybody, regardless of money, I take it — would you agree
that your claim for appointment of counsel in this Court is

31
a weaker one than your claim for appointment of counsel in the
Supreme Court of North Carolina?
The thought being that North Carolina doesn't
confer any right on the criminal defendant to come to this
Court? it’s an Act of Congress,
MR, ANDERSON;

That's true, Your Honor,

But the

State does convict the defendant, and it’s that State trial
that’s being reviewed.

And for the defendant of means, who

can afford to take review, whether by Act of Congress or by
Act of the North Carolina Legislature, the particular
criminal proceeding being reviewed is a State prosecution,
QUESTION; But Douglas made it perfectly clear that
tiie State didn't have to give any right of appeal at all.
MR. ANDERSON:
QUESTION;

That's true.

I would think that if your reasoning is

right, that part of Douglas is wrong»
QUESTION:

Well, why should the State have to

finance an appeal here?
MR. ANDERSON;

Well, the State, as I read the

statute, Your Honor, the statute requires the State to do so,
I've set that statute out on page 3 of my brief.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but we're talking about

the Constitution,
MR. ANDERSON; The Constitution,
QUESTION:

I see no ~~

And that's what the Fourth Circuit

32

decided.
MR. ANDERSON: Weil, the Fourth Circuit's decision
remanded it for a determination of whether or not there was a
substantial constitutional claim; and, if there was, then the
State had to appoint counsel to —
QUESTION:

So if there is a substantial

constitutional claim, there's a constitutional right to
counsel in preparing a petition for certiorari here,
MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Which the State ultimately is going to
pay for under the Fourth Circuit decision?
MR. ANDERSON;

That's correct, Your Honor.

They

will pay for it, but still it's their conviction.
QUESTION: Well, I know, but it's nevertheless the
federal Constitution, the federal court system that is involved.
MR. ANDERSON: Well, the State of North Carolina, of
course, will be the — the court will be the executive
agency which will imprison the defendant; and it is the State
which initially sought the conviction, and Congress, of course,
puts a remedy by way of certiorari to this Court.
QUESTION:

What is the percentage of criminal

cases that are sought to be reviewed here from affirmances
by the North Carolina Supreme Court?
MR. ANDERSON:

I do not — I have no statistics as

to how many are or whether or not they are represented by

33

counselor! that,
I might say this, that if •—
QUESTION; Well, do you know how many petitions -what percentage of cases in the Courts of Appeals, criminal
cases in the Courts of /appeals are sought to be reviewed here?
MR» ANDERSON;

I don’t know the answer to that one»

I do know that a very small majority, or very small number of
cases are even appealed from the trial court level»
cases are disposed of by guilty pleas.

Most

So, very few cases

even reach the first appellate level.
I think the argument that affirming the Fourth
Circuit would create a flood of litigation in this Court not
heretofore seen might be stretching our imagination.

And I

also —
QUESTION;

Are you familiar with idle figures in the

federal courts on the increase in appeals in criminal cases
from district court judgments to the Courts of Appeals, after
it became free under the Criminal Justice Act, accompanied
by the Bail Reform Act?
MR. ANDERSON;

You are asking me, Mr. Chief Justice,

am I familiar with the figures?
QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. ANDERSON;

This Court --

QUESTION; What the trend was.
MR. ANDERSON:

I think the trend —> and I'm only

34
reaching back in my memory ~~ was that there was no substantial
change„

I think the trend was first encountered in, when

this Court was concerned about right to counsel for probation
?
?
and before Marcey and Scape 11.1 , at that point.
I do not
know, and I cannot say whether or not that has increased or
decreased,
However, I would submit that the denial of equal
protection still remains the same.

If the State were to

establish a five or ten-tier system., and I don't mean to be
facetious, that the indigent should have just as much right
to have counsel before the third, fourth, or fifth tier as
his more wealthy companion.
QUESTION: But if it's established by the State, I
certainly see that, that you can make a point on the
Supreme Court of North Carolina? but do you think the equal
protection argument really has any weight at all in the
dis caret ionary review here?
HR, ANDERSON;

I would, Your Honor, based upon the

fact that the remedy exists to review a. State court conviction.
QUESTION;
MR. ANDERSON:

But North Carolina doesn't give it.
It doesn't give the remedy, that's

correct, Mr. Justice Rehnqtiis t, it doesn't.
QUESTION: And if the test is conviction, that you're
attacking a conviction, it seems to me that your argument is
equally applicable to habeas, where you're certainly attacking

35

a State conviction.
MR. ANDERSON s

It's the process that you're

attacking, the conviction, I would say, would be the difference.
In one, the defendant or the former defendant is an adversary
seeking to overturn a final judgment; whereas, in one, the
final judgment is still, theoretically at least, open until
he has let the time run.

And that would be my position in

answer to your question.
The federal practice, of course, does provide right
to counsel in all stages, and I think that this is, of course,
done by statute and not by decision of this Court, except,
of course, by interpretation.
The argument that there would be created a floodtide
presents another problem, in that they would be admitting
that there are defendants who are deterred from seeking a
higher reveiw because they can't afford a counsel.
And I would say that this, this deprivation itself
is, on its face, a denial of equal protection.
/

If counsel is appointed, on the other hand, I don't
think that counsel, either being a member of this Court or a
member of the Supreme Court bar of our State, would be so
presumptions as to insist that he take every appeal or
petition for direct review that every client asked him to take.
If he ~
QUESTION:

Well, he would be taking some risk if he

36

didn't,, wouldn't he?
MR. ANDERSON:
QUESTION;

If he did not.

MR. ANDERSON;
QUESTION:

If he did not or if he did?

He —

Of an attack later in post-conviction

or something, of ineffective assistance of counsel.
MR. ANDERSON; Well, that would be presuming that the
defendant and the counsel had no. dialogue, which, in most
cases, they do.

And it was my personal experience, in most,

in fact every defendant I've ever represented has taken my
advice not to proceed further than the highest State court;
because there is no substantial —QUESTION:

You're more persuasive than some

counsel, because the pattern in many districts has been that
when one counsel refused to take an appeal, there was a demand
for another counsel.

And that continued until they got

someone who would take it.
MR. ANDERSON;

I would say that would be the

exception rather than the rule, Mr. Chief Justice.

That in

most cases you would find that the defendant would see thcit
his counsel is not his adversary but is his representative,
and therefore seeking the roxrte or the remedy that is best for
him.
In those cases where the man insists on a petition
for certiorari to this Court or to the North Carolina Supreme

37

Court, he'll take it whether or not he has counsel, if he's
going to be so insistent.

He’ll take it anyway.

Which

puts this Court and our Supreme Court with the problem of
trying to decide, from his illiterate petition, in many cases,
whether or not his case does have merit.
The burden is very small, I would think.

In fact,

I would submit that it’s a grievous waste * you already have
counsel through one appeal.

He’s familiar with the issues?

ha, more than likely, has tried the case? he has gone through
the record; has appealed it? and now all that's left is to
fashion a petition for certiorari to our highest State court
or to this Court.
Other than any other method, will require someone
new taking over the case, perhaps a law clerk and -*•- or even
perhaps a writ writer in one of the State’s prisons.
QUESTION:

Well, what do you think of the financial

burden on the State to compensate attorneys if the Fourth
Circuit is right?
HR. ANDERSON;
be very small.

I think the financial burden would

It's my experience that State superior court,

judges who award counsel fees after the process is through,
the counsel submits a time list to the superior court judge,
who then determines the nature of the case and how much time
is involved, what the fee award is.
QUESTION; And does that include petitioning your

38

Supreme Court?
MR. ANDERSON:

Every — I would put it this way,

I read the statute, the enabling statute, to say that we are
required to do so.

And --

QUESTION:

You mean your North Carolina statute?

MR. ANDERSON:
QUESTION:

I do, Your Honor.

Unh-hunh.

MR. ANDERSON:

And in the Appendix to the Fourth

Circuit brief, there is a letter from the Administrative
Office of the Courts which states that the Administrative
Office pays for at least in those cases where the petitioner
or the defendant went to idle highest State court, and the
statute itself reads:

direct review even in the Supreme

Court of the United States.
So the Legislature has already provided a financial
remedy for our situation.

Now all we've got to do is to

get the courts to uphold the, what I would say is the intent
of the Legislature? however, the Attorney General's office
and the courts have interpreted the statute very narrowly,
QUESTION: The State has done this as a matter of
/

policy up to this point, have they not?
MR. ANDERSON:

I think there's been no policy, Mra

Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

It sounds like a pretty good policy, the

way you've described it

39

MR. ANDERSON:

Maybe I misinterpreted your question.

Are you —
QUESTION; Well, the decision by the State of North
Carolina to provide this assistance has been one of a decision
of public policy by the Legislature, perhaps influenced by
the views of judges or perhaps not.

But the question before

us now is not a policy question, but whether the Constitution
requires it, is it not?
MR. ANDERSON; That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,
it is.
And the policy of the Legislature, however goodintended it might be, is of no import when the courts don't
interpret the policy the same way,

Which is what, I would

submit, we have here; that the policy of the Legislature
was to give full right to counsel on any direct review,
which would include tbs full tier from the superior court
level all the way up to this Court.
QUESTION;

Just let me ask you a hypothetical

question that may seem extreme, but I want to test it;
Suppose that the Fourth Circuit position became the law,
and they've gone all the way through and filed a petition for
a iirrit here, the writ is denied.

Query:

Is there a

constitutional requirement to furnish a lax^er to prepare a
petition for reviewing on the petition for a writ of
certiorari?

40

Since that's open to every litigant as a discretionary
matter.
MR, ANDERSON:

I would say that the only constitu­

tional mandate that would be there would be vrhether or not
the traditional notions of when this Court does rehear a case
are met.

The same value judgment which is made by counsel at,

after the first appeal stage, whether or not there is a
substantial constitutional question, whether or not there is
a substantial question of public importance or intesrest to
the judicial bar of the State.
Those -- all these value judgments are made along
the way.

And I would say, in answer to your question, that

it would be required if counsel thought it would be.

And

if, in this particular instance, the demand by the defendant
that he be afforded a review, when the review has already
taken place in the same court, it could be carried —
QUESTION:

No, no; you're going to turn this last

decision over to the counsel and take it away from the client?
Suppose the lawyer advises the clients

No, there's no point

in filing a petition for rehearing, the court almost never
grants them. And the man, the client now, responds:

I want a

petition for rehearing filed.
MR. ANDERSON:

In that particular case, I think he

is required to do so.
QUESTION: At public expense?

41
MR» ANDERSON;
QUESTIONs

At the public expense,

You might get some help if you get the

figures from the Solicitor General's office, that handles
sixty percent of the work in this Court, to find out how many
petitions for rehearing the United States has ever filed.
That would help»

It would be close to zero*

MR. ANDERSON: Well, I would say that in most
instances that the average defendant, even after being advised
that you can have rehearing,.would not take advantage of that
and would follow his counsel's advice.
QUESTION;

Well, that doesn't really bear on the

constitutional question before us, does it?
MR. ANDERSON:

It does ~~ it does if we're worried

about the balancing of the burden in implementing the
decision, as opposed to the mandate or the strength of the
mandate the Constitution requires.
In conclusion, I would like to say that our notions
of basic fairness and justice would mandate that the defendant
not be sent off on his own, that he be given the guiding hand
of counsel, so to speak —
QUESTION:

Would it satisfy you if, under the North

Carolina rules, a copy of the brief in the North Carolina
Court of Appeals and a copy of the opinion in the North
Carolina Court of Appeals would be -- if filed in the North
Carolina Supreme Court would be adequate, an adequate filing,

42
would be considered, a petition for certiorari?
MR. ANDERSON:

No, Mr. Justice White, I wouldn't,

for two reasons:
First of all, if it was considered adequate,

then

I think it would have been done before.
Secondly, the criteria which the Supreme Court uses
on discretionary review is quite different than those that
the appellate court uses.
QUESTION; Well, it might be, but they could apply
whatever criteria they are going to apply to whatever is
revealed by the papers filed in the court of Appeals.
MR. ANDERSON; Which would require the court to take
the task of reading —
QUESTION; Well, that may be, that's the burden on the
court, that doesn't create a constitutional right in you.
MR. ANDERSON; Well, it does in the sense that the
indigent defendant therefore puts the court to a burden,
which is more
QUESTION;

I know, but if the North Carolina Supreme

Court wrote in its own rules, said, It shall be an adequate
petition for certiorari to file here the brief and the opinion
in the Court of Appeals.
Now, if it accepts that burden, what objection would
you have to that?
MR. ANDERSON; The only objection is that the defendant

43

of means has counsel who can lay out the contentions which
he feels will catch the court’s eye, which will, when the
petition comes across their desk for review, will be to,
so to speak, jump out at the justice, as opposed to here is
another brief -QUESTION:

Well, that’s a good theory about

petitions for cert? but only a theory»
MR. ANDERSON:

Well, in — I would think that with

this Court’s burden that the counsel would aid the court, and
by aiding the court it would aid the defendant, because he
would have the assurance that his cause had been passed upon
by having his cause stated clearly, rather than having it
stated in terms aimed at either a different court or by
his own words.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr.

Anderson.
You have about three minutes left, Mr. Safron, if
you need them.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JACOB L. SAFRON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SAFRON:

If Your Honor please, in my first

presentation I did not reach the question of our State
statute, which I did say was in a state of confusion.
Our General Assembly just adjourned last week, and

44
in the dying hours of the 1974 General Assembly, they passed
a bill amending the provision which Mr. Anderson spoke to.
That particular provision now reads:

Review of

any judgment or decree pursuant to G.S„ 7A-27, that is,
direct review to the Court of Appeals, or direct review to
the Supreme Court in an applicable case, G.S. 7A-30(l),

that

is the substantial constitutional question from the Court of
Appeals to the Supreme Court, G.S. 7A-30(2), that is the
dissent case, and G.S. 35-222, that is the petition for writ
of certiorari in post-conviction.
So the language which was causing the trouble and
which the justices or the jud'.es of our superior c

irt had

difficulty in applying has be n rewritten, and our

satute

now reads;

that the right to counsel in these instances is

counsel to the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals, when it's
as of right, and in post-conviction matters.
So it's a clearcut constitutional question without
any State statute being involved.
QUESTION;

Mr. Safron, can I ask you what your

understanding is —- I perhaps should know, but — on federal
habeas corpus, where a State prisoner files in the United
States District Court, if there’s a hearing required, counsel
is appointed.
MR. SAFRON;

Under the Criminal Justice Act,

QUESTION; And if he — if the petition is denied,

45
counsel stays in the case or is reappointed in the Court of
Appeals?
MR. SAFRON:

My experience,, Your Honor, in

several hundred cases in the Fourth Circuit, has been that
counsel is only appointed upon the issuance of a certificate
of probable cause
QUESTION;
MR, SAFRON:
QUESTION;

Right.
— by the Circuit Court.
All right.

I agree with that, because

that's the only time there will be an appeal.
MR. SAFRON;

Counsel is not appointed to seek the

appeal to the Circuit Court.
QUESTION; But he doesn't stay in?

He doesn't stay

in the case?
MR. SAFRON; Rarely.

It's been ray experience that

most certificates of probable cause are granted through -QUESTION;

All right, but now -- now let's assume

the Court of Appeals decides the case after having appointed
counsel, and then the prisoner wants to, or the defendant
wants to seek a petition for certiorari here.

Does the

Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit's rule, court rule,
say that counsel should stay in the case until, for the
purposes of the petition?
MR. SAFRON;
is —

Your Honor, the Criminal Justice Act

46

QUESTION:

I know about the Criminal. vTustice Act;,

but that doesn't reach this»
MR» SAFRON:

I don't believe it reaches this, and

I'd like to point this one —
QUESTION:

But some of the court rules, themselves,

have not only reflected the Criminal Justice Act's requirement
on direct appeal, but in connection with collateral proceedings
to have counsel stay in to
MR. SAFRON:

The Fourth Circuit, in the Moffitfc case,

made it perfectly clear that the rule announced in Moffitt has
no application to collateral attack.
QUESTION:

I see.

I see.

Okay.

QUESTION;

Mr. Safron, is there more than, one

Court of Appeals?
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON:

In North Carolina, Your Honor?
Yes.
One Court with three panels.

QUESTION;

One Court with three panels.

QUESTION:

Now, three or four counties, experimentally

have provided counsel, haven't they?
MR. SAFRON;

Although the General Assembly has

established a Public Defender system, experimentally, in
three counties at the present time; each time the General
Assembly meets, they keep adding a county, and no doubt
within several years the entire State, except for some purely

47
rural area.3, which could not really support it, will probably
have Public Defender systems,
QUESTION:

So that, at least from these three

counties, the — and at least to the State Supreme Court,
apart from —■
MR. SAFRON:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
— apart from petition for certiorari

to this Court, the State is now providing what the Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said they must provide —
MR, SAFRON:

Let me just say this.

I received a

phone call from one of our Public Defenders about two weeks
ago, an order had been entered requiring him to petition this
Court, and he said, "What am I supposed to do?

There are no

constitutional issues involved, but an order has been
entered."
QUESTION:
MR. SAFRON;

By — ?
By a State superior court judge from

a reading of our statute, and I said, "Re ad Anders vs.
California."
But it's very difficult.

If it's a constitutional

right, then counsel cannot disregard the right; and if he
disregards -- and if he makes his determination, he's in post­
conviction as the defendant in the next case.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Safron.

48

MR. SAFRON: Thank you, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Anderson, you

appeared in this case by our appointment and at our request,
and on behalf of the Court I want to thank you for your
assistance to the Court and to your client, of course.
MR. ANDERSON:

It's been an honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

The case is submitted.

[Whereupon, at 2:17 o’clock, p.m,, the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.]
