MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Ho, 73-78, Kahn against Shevin.
Mrs. Ginsburg, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
If you'd like to lower the lectern, you are quite at
liberty to do so.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. RUTH BADER GINSBURG,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS, GINSBURG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Appellant Hel Kahn, a Florida resident, is a widower.
In January 1971, based on his status as a surviving spouse,
he applied to the Dade County Tax Assessor for a property tax
exemption.
The statute under which widower Kahn sought
exemption provided:

A widow, along with disabled persons,

is entitled to exempt $500 yearly from her property tax.
Mel Kahn was denied the claimed exemption, solely
on the ground of his sex.

Requesting judicial review, he

alleged that the statute under which he claimed exemption had
been interpreted and applied in conflict with the equal
protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

Actually he didn't allege that in the

trial, though? didn't he expressly say that he didn't want to

4
raise his federal question there?
MRS. GINSBURG:

In the original complaint, he

suggested that he might save out the federal question till a
later time.

But then the federal question was raised, and

decided, with the agreement of all parties.
QUESTION; But he didn't simply say he "might save"
it, but he said he wanted to save it? didn't he?
MRS. GINSBURG;

Yes. But apparently, with the

understanding of the court and the agreement of both sides,
the federal question was heard and decided, both in the trial
court and in the Florida Supreme Court.
Appellant sought a declaration that the exemption
provision is unconstitutional in so far as it excludes
widowers.
On cross motions for summary judgment, the court of
first instance held that the statute according exemption to
all widows and excluding all v/idowers discriminated
arbitrarily between widowed persons and therefore violated
the equal protection guarantees of the State and Federal
Constitutions.
On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court reversed. The
Florida Supreme Court held that the distinction between
surviving spouses, though based solely on gender, did not
deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.
It is appellant's position that the gender-based

5

distinction upheld by the Florida Supreme Court discriminates
invidiously in two respects;
First, most obviously it discriminates against men
who have lost their, wives»

More subtlely but as surely

it discounts the contribution made to the marital unit and
the family economy by the female partner, for her death
occasions no exemption for the surviving spouse.
By defining the exempt person as widow rather than
surviving spouse, this provision now covering the blind and
the totally disabled along with the widow, is kin to a
classification delineated by the president of one of our
nation's leading educational institutions.
Anticipating an increase in conscription not too
many years ago, this distinguished educator complained;
We shall be

left with the blind, the lame, and the women.

This Court's decision in Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S.,
and its judgment in Fronfciero v. Richardson, 411 U.5» indicate
genuine concern to analyze sex classifications free from the
generalizations of the Victorian Age.
Appellant maintains that the Reed standard is not
met by a surviving spouse tax exemption that uses gender as
the sole criterion for qualification.

For, if need is the

concern, then sex should not be a substitute for an income
text.

And if widowed state is the concern, then it is

irrational to distinguish between taxpayers, based on their

6

sex.
Far from constituting a rational shorthand for
distinguishing between taxpayers on the basis of need or
life situation, a widow’s only classification is a crude
device that originated in, and today perpetuates, Victorian
assumptions concerning the station of men and women.
To resolve this case, the Court need not go beyond
the scrutiny employed in Reed and followed by the Tenth
Circuit in Moritz v, Commissioner, 469 F0 2d,
The decision in Reed and the judgment in Frontiero
indicate the Court’s clear willingness to give sex classifica­
tions more than surface examination.
However, if the Court wants to consider application
of a suspect classification doctrine, then it must face the
fact that problems of race and sex discrimination are often
different, and that neither women nor blacks are aided by
lumping the ti7o together for all purposes.
Thus far this Court has applied the label "suspect
classification” only in opinions involving discrimination
hostile to groups not dominant in society.
Rut whatever may be said for a one-way suspect
classification doctrine in cases involving racial
discrimination, a one-way approach in sex discrimination cases
would be fraught with danger for women, because of the
historic tendency of jurists to rationalize any special

7
treatment of women as benignly in their favor.
With respect to race, the effects of officially
sanctioned segregation are still very much with us, but
complex doctrines directed to the continuing impact of
racial segregation are not necessarily applicable to sex
discrimination.
The difference is perhaps best illustrated with
respect to the educational experience.

Most public education

is co-educational, though females have been segregated and
restricted in some areas, most notably vocational training
and athletics.
But generally females participate with males in
academic programs in elementary and high schools, and, in fact,
tend to do better there than males.

For many females this

record of achievement continues into college and university.
For example, females outscore males on the law
school admissions test.
The problem for women is that along the way an
attitude is instilled insidiously.

This attitude is described

in a nutshell in graffiti etched on a college library carro
in the early 1950's.

The epigram readss

Study hard, get

good grades, get your degree, get married, have three kids,
die, and be buried.
From the first line, the sex of the writer is
impossible to determine, from the second, her sex is impossible

8
to mistake.
To cure the problem felt so acutely by the young
woman who wrote those words and so many others like her, the
law must stop using sex as a shorthand for functional
description.

It must deal with the parent, not the mother?

with the homemaker, not the housewife? and with the surviving
spouse„ not the widow.
To appreciate the character of the challenged
classification, the widow's own exemption must be viewed in
historical context.
in 1885.

Exemption became part of Florida's law

At that time, indeed well into the Twentieth Century,

Florida law routinely differentiated between the roles of men
and women and particularly married men and married women.
Women could not vote, nor did they serve on juries,
for example.
Well past the middle of the Twentieth Century, in
fact up till 1968, a Florida married woman could not
transfer even her own interest in real property without her
husband’s consent.
Wot surprisingly, the married woman was deemed worthy
of special solicitude on the death of the person the law
regarded as her guardian, her superior; not her peer.
While the widow's only exemption was designed with
the Nineteenth Century status of married women in mind, the
Florida Supreme Court found contemporary justification for it

9

in this unquestionable fact:

women workers, as a class,

do not earn as much as men.

This well-known and still wide

earnings gap, according to the Florida Supreme Court, supplies
a fair and substantial basis for the tax classification
"widow" rather than "surviving spouse".
But, beyond doubt, a widow's only exemption has no
impact whatever on the conditions responsible for the earnings
gap.
QUESTION:

Excuse me, I'm not too clear.

You are

arguing that sex ought not to be treated as a suspect
classification?
MRS. GINSBURG:

I am arguing that if, first, that

it is not necessary to deal with that question in this case,
but, second, that if sex is treated as a suspect classifica­
tion, which I think properly it is, then the Court must be
aware that the arguments that we give special scrutiny only
to lines that appear to disfavor women, will be ultimately
harmful to women, because the history has been -QUESTION:

So it's suspect plus?

MRS, GINSBURG:

It is the classification, it is the

criterion sex that is suspect, not female, but the criterion
sex,
QUESTION: Generally, isn’t it the fact that the
Court has found classification to be suspect when it involves
a discriminatory classification against a minority group?

MRS .., GINSBURG s
QUESTION:

Yes.

Would that *— is that accurate?

MRS. GINSBURG:

In this Court's precedent, the

suspect label has been used —
QUESTION:

So that the paradigm is race?

MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

And national origin *—

The minority race — the minority race

MRS. GINSBURG:

Yes.

Andrwhat was looked at was

only —■
QUESTION:

And alienage is another, presumably?

right?
MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Alienage, yes.

So the suspect classification can be

found only with respect to discriminatory classification
against a minority group; is that correct?
MRS. GINSBURG:

That is how it has been used in

this Court's precedent.
QUESTION:

Traditionally up until now.

MRS. GINSBURG:

Yes.

Actually —

QUESTION: And your point, I gather, is that —* I
don It know that you've mentioned it, but women, first of all
are not a minority group? and, secondly, since courts have
been in the habit to view any classification of women as a
beneficent -MRS. GINSBURG:

Yes

11
QUESTION?

— provision, of course, should be

on guard in not —*
MRS.

GINSBURG:

Yes.

My point is that for women

the ~ what will aid women most is not looking to see whether
a classification is benign or invidious.
QUESTION:

Unh-hunh.

MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

But whether it is a sex criterion —

Right.

MRS. GINSBURG:

-- as a shorthand for what should

be a functional criterion.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Right.
In other words, you don't want it

whether it helps — even if it helps.
MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Mv question is if it ever does help,

Ever does.

MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But, even if it does, you would assume,

on that assumption that —
MRS. GINSBURG;

But I have not yet found any

such classification in the law that genuinely helps. From a
very shortsighted viewpoint, perhaps, such as this one, yes.
But long run —no, I think that what women need is, first of
all, a removal of exclusions and restrictive quotas.

They are

the only population group that today still faces outright
exclusions and restrictive quotas.

12
And then what is necessary is a welcome sign, a
notice that in professions, in trades and occupations, women
are now as welcome as men»
But the notion that they need special favored treatment, because they are women, I think has been what has
helped to keep women in a special place, and has kept them
away from equal opportunity for so long»
In other words, take this exemption, it's not the
purpose of this exemption to eliminate discrimination against
women, it isn't the purpose to eliminate discrimination in
pay or to equalise training study, job opportunities for them0
In stark contrast to this widow's exemption are
measures that are realistically designed to promote
equal opportunity, free from gender-based discrimination.
Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example.
These measure focus on eliminating sex typing of
this very order as the essential task.
Nor can an exemption of this kind be regarded as a
rational welfare measure to alleviate the effects of class
discrimination against women.

As a welfare measure, supposedly

directed to the ability of women property owners to pay taxes,
the exemption is incredibly designed, it encompasses the
independently wealthy widow, and at the same time it excludes
the woman who encounters, perhaps, the sharpest discrimination,
the female head of household who never married

13

In some the classification is obviously unrelated to
any biological difference between men and women.

It is not

fairly and substantially related to the need or life
situation of the individual man or woman, but it is very
much related to underestimation of the woman's contribution
to the family economy.
Significantly, the Florida Supreme Court on other
days has demonstrated its understanding of the very real and
substantial economic contribution made by the female partner,
whether as homemaker, through gainful employment, or, as is
increasingly the case, through productive effort both in and
outside the home.

QUESTION:

Well, in so far as the statute does not

differentiate among various widows, or various categories of
widows, it's very typical of tax legislation generally, isn't
it?
MRS. GXNSBURG;
QUESTION;

Yes.

The —

And certainly the federal income tax,

which gives every taxpayer an exemption of $750 for each
dependent, regardless of his circumstances, or the dependent’s
circumstances if he's below a certain age, is certainly very
a very blunt instrument.
MRS. GINSBURG;
QUESTION;

And in so far as this *—

Yes.

— this legislation fails to discriminat

14
as among various categories of widows, you don't really
attack it, do you?
MRS. GINSBURG:

The classification "surviving

spouse" is a well-known classification in both State and
federal tax law.

It does reflect the Legislature's recognition

that loss of a spouse is a unique episode in a person's life.,
and I am not challenging the classification "surviving
spouse".
QUESTION:

No.

My point was — perhaps I didn't

express it very well.
You, a few moments ago, spoke and said that the
legislation is applicable whether the widow be —
MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

— a millionairess, or whether she be a

poor working widow, and whether she have children or not have
children, and so on.
I didn't really understand that your basic attack
upon this legislation was premised upon that formation.
MRS. GINSBURG:

That's right.

I am not suggesting

that the tax assessor call in each individual exempt person
and see if that person really needs the exemption; not at all.
QUESTION;

I didn’t think so.

MRS. GINSBURG:

What I am suggesting is that the

sex criterion is invalid.
QUESTION;

Mrs. Ginsburg, assuming I agree with

15

everything you said, how do you get any relief in this case?
MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Well, —

Assuming that we declare the statute

unconstitutional.
MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, if this Court —

Who gets any relief then?

MRS. GINSBURG:

Mel Kahn gets the tax exemption

for the tax year in question -QUESTION:

How?

MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

How?
First, ~

I said if we declare the statute

MRS. GINSBURG:

In so far as it discriminates

against widowers, I think that if you declare the gender line
unconstitutional, which is the only thing that the Court has
been requested to do, then the Florida Supreme Court should
be free to consider whether total demolition of this exemption,
or repairing it to fit the constitutional requirement is -QUESTION:
just end it.

I'm assuming that ~ assuming that they

that, and nobody gets anything, that's not the proper place
for an equity court to act.
MRS. GINSBURG;

I'm asking this Court to take the

same approach that was taken in Frontiero last semester.
Where a group of service spouses, in that case husbands, did
not qualify for the exemption because the statute excluded
them.

And all this Court held was that the statute was

unconstitutional in so far as it excluded that class.

MRS» GINSBURG;

Florida Supreme Court»
QUESTION;

Mrs» Ginsburg, pursuing this

discussion,

do I understand you to say that the Florida Court would have
not only authority, but I think on page 26 of your brief you
said;

if it's a responsible court, it would, in effect,

rewrite this statute, contrary to what you concede to be its
plain language and intent»

That a court would do that rather

than the Florida Legislature?
MRS» GINSBURG; The Court has two choices in that
situation»

It can either nullify the statute, in which case

it is totally thwarting the Legislature’s will? or it can
modify the statute to meet the constitutional equal protection
requirement»
If it guesses the wrong way, in either direction,
the Legislature of course has the final word»
faced with the questions

But the Court,

should we take this exemption away

from the three-quarters of the population, the widow
population, that now gets it, rather than extend it to the
one-quarter that doesn't, in order to preserve what the
Legislature did do, it seems to me it is eminently more
destructive of the Legislature — legislative will to say that
we remove this exemption altogether; than to say We'll keep

19

what you wanted, and then add this much smaller group.
QUESTIONS

Did you —

QUESTIONs

I might agree with that

excuse rue,

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Go on.

QUESTION;

I was going to say I could be persuaded,

I think, to agree that it would be more constructive if you
prevail here for the Legislature, in the end, to equalise it.
But I was curious by your suggestion that the Court itself
could rewrite a perfectly plain statute, conceded by you to
be plain.
MRSo GINSBURG:
just that.

A number of State courts have done

We cited Schmcll v. Creecy, for example.
QUESTION:

We have gone quite far, but I didn't

know we had gone that far.
MRS. GINSBURG:

Hunh?

These were all cases where an exclusion

where

a statute was constitutionally infirm because of under™
inclusion? a group had been left out.

And then it was the

Court's choice to determine whether it wanted to knock out
the provision a 3. to gather or to do, well, as Mr. Justice
Harlan once put. it, the choice is between amputation and
a skin graft.
QUESTION:

That's what he suggested in Welsh, —

MRS. GINSBURG:

Yes.

20

QUESTIONS

*•— but the Court's never done that, has

it?
QUESTION?

That was just his point of view?

MRSo GINSBURGs

That was his concurring opinion,

yes.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

But that was the fifth vote in

determining this.
MRS. GINSBURG:
QUESTION:

Yes.

But, incidentally, I gather you recognize

— your suggestion at page 25 of yoiir brief, that if we agree
the statute’s unconstitutional, that we should remand for
"consideration, whether consistent with the dominant legislative
purpose, the constitutional infirmity should be remedied by
holding the exemption available to all widowed property
owners."

We wouldn't do that, would we?

All we would do,

if we agree with you, would be simply remand for proceedings
not inconsistent with
MRS. GINSBURGs

Exactly right, yes.

QUESTION: Without making any suggestion to the
Florida Supreme Court.
MRS. GINSBURGs

Quite so, yes.

What we seek in this Court is a declaration that
the qender line is unconstitutional? that it is unconstitutional
to exclude widowers, and, on a remand for further proceedings

21
not inconsistent with that opinion.
QUESTIONs

Is that the only way we could do it, or

could we simply say the statute's invalid, period?
If we —
MRS. GINSBURG:

I think that you would be clearer

and provide more precise instruction to the Florida Supreme
Court if you said that the statute was unconstitutional in so
far as it excluded widowers.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

Right.
You take the risk — "you", I’m speaking

in broad terras; a litigant takes the risk of destroying an
entire statutory scheme when they attack it in this Court, as
one of the risks; is that not so?
MRS. GINSBURG:

Justice Brandeis once made the

point that when a taxpayer is in this situation, that taxpayer
cannot be expected to have his situation equalised by asking
the taxpayer to increase the taxes of others similarly
situated.

So that when a taxpayer is subject to discriminatory

tax, through favoring others, the only equalization possible
is to grant that taxpayer the exemption afforded by the
decision; and then a change for the future can be made, so
that all persons similarly situated will either be included or
excluded from the exemption.
QUESTION:
do th at?

But you don't *— you still agree we cannot

MRS. GINSBURGs

I think it is the province of the

Florida Supreme Court to decide what should be done with that
Florida statute.
QUESTION:

But, do — are we obliged to suggest to

them what they should do, or can we do anything more than hold
that statute unconstitutional?
Can we do anything more?
MRS» GINSBURG:

Well, you can do what Justice

Brandeis suggested in the lowa-Des Moines case, 284 U.S., and
that is to say that this — this appellant must be granted the
exemption because there is no other way that his claim of a
denial of equal protection can be redressed.
QUESTION: Which is entirely different from this
case?
The exemption in that case is entirely different.
MRS. GINSBURGs

It was a different kind of

exemption, but the same situation that —
