MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in No. 72-1660, Elackledge against Perry.
Mr. League, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD N„ LEAGUE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRe LEAGUE;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court s
I am Richard N. League from Raleigh, North Carolina,
to argue this case for the petitioners.
Before beginning argument, I'd like to apologize
to each of you for the shabby condition I understand the
briefs and records came up here in.

I hope you will accept

my apologies in that regard, and that ifc won't let your -jaundice your view of the case too bad.
This case presents two issues to the Court for
decision:
First, whether or not double jeopardy is a matter
that would be waived by a voluntary and intelligent plea of
guilty.
And, secondly, if the record in this case is good
enough to show that such plea made here was voluntary and
intelligent.
The facts on which tlyis arises are briefly as
/

follows:

4
Jimmy Seth Perry was tried in the lower level of our
two-tier system in North Carolina, the District Court, on a
warrant charging him with misdemeanor assault,,
After conviction there and sentenced to a consecutive
six months' sentence, he appealed to the Superior Court
division, the higher division of the two-tier system, in which
there is trial by jury.

He appealed for trial de novo as a

matter of right.
Prior to the case coming on to be called there, then,
the Solicitor obtained an indictment charging him with a higher
grade of the offenses

felonious assault.

And to this he

pled and received a sentence in the Superior Court of some
five to seven years.

However, tills sentence was consecutive

to the sentence he had-at the time he made the plea, and,
accordingly, the actual extension of time beyond the six
months' consecutive sentence he received below, something
like about three and a half months at that time.
Subsequently, in this proceeding in the Eastern
District, he obtained habeas corpus relief on the issue of
pretrial credit also.
QUESTION:

Mr. League, could you speak up a little?

I'm having a little bit of difficulty hearing you.
MR. LEAGUE:
QUESTION:
MR. LEAGUE:

Oh, I'm s orry.
I am, too, Mr. League.
Right.

I think to say, in point.of the facts as I've just
mentioned then, Your Honor, was that the five to seven-year
sentence concurrent with the sentence he was then serving
operated to give him about a three-and-a-half-month
increase over the six-month

consecutive sentence he had

received in District Court, until the time of this action
when he received pretrial credit on the first penalty, which
created a greater disparity between the two.
My position briefly, on the first issue, is that
double jeopardy is a matter which would be waived as an
independent, basis of collateral attack by virtue of his guilty
plea, in tills case.
That he can only use that in a habeas corpus action
as evidence of some other basis for relief? such as
ineffective assistance of counsel.
Mr. Keenan has suggested to you that you ought to
adopt a system-related, guilt-related distinction with regard
to determining whether or not such waiver has been made in a
given case.
But our eulogy should not accept that, it is not
always clear just what is guilt and what is system-related.
In fact, part of the rationale, as I understand it, of the
double jeopardy clause is to prevent punishment, the conviction
of the innocent through repeated prosecution,,
Accordingly, I think this right would definitely

6

partake both of being a system-related right and a right which
is guilt-related as well.
What it —
QUESTION; Did I understand you to say innocence is
involved in double jeopardy?
MR. LEAGUE;

To preventJ one of the bases for the

prohibition against it, Your Honor, is to prevent the likelihood
of the conviction of the innocent through repeated prosecution.
So, in that sense, I would view it as possibly guilt.
QUESTION;

Do you give a citation for that?

MR. LEAGUE;

Sir?

QUESTION; A citation for that.
MR. LEAGUE:

I believe it is in Denton v. Maryland.

I believe it's in Green.
QUESTION;

That innocence is a part of it?

MR. LEAGUE;

Just what I said, Your Honor, that one

of the rationale, one of the parts of the rationale against
double jeopardy, is what I said? like —
QUESTION:

Double jeopardy is against being twice

tried,
MR. LEAGUE;

Yes, sir; but I'm going beyond

what

I said, down to that ~~
QUESTION;

What has innocence got to do with ■—

oh, you want to add that to it?
MR. LEAGUE;

Sir?

7
QUESTION:
MR. LEAGUE:

Yon want to add that to it?
No, sir.

I believe it's been stated

in those decisions , that a part of the rationale underlying
prohibition on double jeopardy is the possibility of conviction
of the innocent through repeated prosecutions.
Now, that's not the only part, prior to that, I
believe, in the quotation, something like relief of anxiety,
embarrassment or

? a State with all its resources should

not be permitted multiple attempts.
mentioned idle re.

All these things are

And I do recall that they are in both the

Benton and the Green decisions.
Perhaps I'm wrong on the latter, but I believe I'm
right on the former.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR, LEAGUE:

Yes, sir?

MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. LEAGUE:

Mr. League —

— keep your voice up.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’re all having-a

little difficulty.
MR, LEAGUE:

I am terribly sorry.

In addition, as a second reason, I would urge upon
you for rejecting the system, guilt-related distinction, the
basis for weight, is that if you look at the things that are
normally not wavied by a guilty plea, such tilings as mental
incompetence, coercion, ineffective assistance, failure to

8
plea? you see that while they are in some sense system-related,
they also have a common factor which isn't present in this
case.
And I think that common factor is that in none of
those cases is the plea a reliable indicator that there may be
a valid basis for it.
Certainly in Perry's case, if we're just to throw
aside his accusation — or his allegations, pardon me —
QUESTION:

Well, what are

is the State's position

that there was double jeopardy but that it was waived, or —why v;as it even double jeopardy in the first place?
MR. LEAGUE;

Your Honor, I don't agree that it was,

but the thrust of my argument would be you wouldn't have to
reach that because it would he waived by his plea.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, that seems to me like

that's a special sort of a consideration; you don't need to
get to waiver if there was never any double jeopardy in the
first place, do you?
MR. LEAGUE:

Well, I understand you avoid the

constitutional question if possible, as to go to waiver -*QUESTION; Well, waiver is a constitutional question.
MR. LEAGUE:

Well — I guess so, Your Honor.

At

initial outlook, it's less of a constitutional question than
double jeopardy.
QUESTION: Well, why would it be a double jeopardy

9

here?
MR. LEAGUE;
QUESTION;

I don't think it would be, Your Honor.
He never was — he was never tried for

the more serious offense but once, was he, and even -then he
pleaded guilty to it.
MR. LEAGUE;

That's true.

That's true,

I don't believe —
QUESTION;

Well, when was he ever tried — what's

the double jeopardy involved, then?
MR. LEAGUE;

Double jeopardy, according to Judge

Larkins, is the raising of the offense in betxceen the initial
trial in the lower court and the subsequent trial.
QUESTION; Well, yes, but it was a different offense,
with different elements.
MR. LEAGUE;

That's why he claimed ~~ or Judge

Larkins held it was double jeopardy, I believe.
QUESTION:

But how — I thought double jeopardy was

a — that it wasn't double jeopardy if .it was a different
crime, that he's tried for the second time.
MR. LEAGUE:

I don't know that, Your Honor.

I

wouldn't have thought it was double jeopardy in this case,
though, just by virtue of the State's bringing forth the
higher degree of the crime for which they could have
initially tried him? at least in terms of a probable-cause
hearing at the first level.

10

QUESTION; Well, let me see if I get —
QUESTION;

But you say there was double jeopardy?

MR. LEAGUE;
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

I say there was not.
Not.

Yeah, I see.

Let me see if I get this correct.

He

was convicted initially on a misdemeanor of assault with a
deadly weapon.

And he appealed that, and had he been

successful on the appeal he would have had a trial de novo
on the misdemeanor charge.
MR. LEAGUE:
trial de novo.

Is that right?

No, sir.

He automatically got a

Now, the normal expectation would have been

that it would have been on the misdemeanor charge; but,
in the interim, the Solicitor obtained an indictment charging
him with the higher offense.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

Well, now, in other words,

when he went — he appealed the misdemeanor charge, did he?
MR. LEAGUE:
QUESTION;

Yes, sir,
And did he

v/as he tried de novo on

the misdemeanor charge?
MR. LEAGUE;
QUESTION;

No, sir.
No.

Because intervening the trial de

novo was the indictment on the felony charge.
MR. LEAGUE;

Yes, sir.

QUESTION; And what's the difference between the
elements of the felony offense and the elements of the

11
ruis deme ano i' offense?
MR. LEAGUES

Two additional in this case, Your

Honor.
QUESTION: What were they?
MR. LEAGUE:

One was inflicting serious injuries,

and the other intent to kill, to my recollection, there
was —
QUESTION: Well, I know, but it was the same, the
same event, wasn't it?
MR. LE/iGUE:

Same event, same person, same act.

QUESTION: The same assault.

Except that -- and

the condition of the victim was the same in respect of the
trial on the misdemeanor charge as it was in respect to the
trial on the felony charge, wasn't it?
MR. LEAGUE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So the only thing that happened — well,

then, why isn't that

why isn't it double jeopardy?

MR. LEAGUE:

Your Honor, I don't think it's

double jeopardy because the thing is

there's no real

risk of jeopardy in this lower, lower system unless the man
accepts tiiat he can —
QUESTION:

But you didn't need any different

evidence on the felony charge than you had —* than the State
had to introduce on the misdemeanor charge?
QUESTION:

Or you had to prove some elements that

you didn't have to prove,

Yes, sir.

What?

I thought yon said the

condition of the victim was exactly the same.

have on the felony trial that you didn't introduce in the

record of —
QUESTION:

I see.

QUESTION: Did he ever go to trial on the misdemeanor
charge?
MR. LEAGUE:

I understand he did, from his

allegations, Your Honor,

MR. LEAGUE:

Well, I'm reading from your brief -In the —
— I'm reading from your brief, and it's

your brief that says he was initially tried and convicted
in August 19 69 on tine misdemeanor assault; he appealed it,

13

and then you say;
the Superior

"Perry appealed tile assault conviction to

Court and received a trial de novo."

MR. LEAGUE:

Yes, sir»

He pled guilty at the trial

de novo, sir.
QUESTION: Then you've got;

"However, during the

interim between appeal and trial de novo, the solicitor
obtained an indictment" **MR. LEAGUE;
QUESTION:
MR. LEAGUE:

Yes, sir.
-- "charging him with a felony."
That much, Your Honor.

QUESTION: And he pleaded guilty to that.
MR, LEAGUE:

Right.

QUESTION: Well, then, I misread what you say:

"and

he received a trial de novo"; he did not in fact receive one,
is that it?
MR. LEAGUE:
he pled guilty.

He received a trial de novo, at which

No evidence was put on.

QUESTION: That wasn't a trial de novo on the
misdemeanor charge, that was
MR. LEAGUE:
QUESTION:

That was on the event, that was on —■
— that was on the trial on the felony

charge.
MR. LEAGUE:

That was on the event, Your Honor.

QUESTION: But had they gone to trial on the prior
charge, the second or de novo trial, they would have had to

14
prove intent, which was not required in the first case? is
that true?
MR. LEAGUE;

Intent and serious bodily injury.

QUESTION; And serious bodily injury.
MR. LEAGUE;

Right.

QUESTION; Those two elements.
MR. LE.AGUE;

And pray for whatever -— it may have

been the same in either, but it would have had to also meet
the requirements to sustain those two elements, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Had he not appealed, could he have been

indicted?
MR. LEAGUE:

No, sir.

QUESTION; So, because he appealed, he was indicted.
MR. LEAGUE:

I would say so, yes, sir.

QUESTION: Thank you!
MR. LEAGUE:

But I would not attach perhaps the

same significance as- — to it as Your Honor.

MR. LEAGUE:
QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

for a felony?

MR. LEAGUE;
QUESTION:

Even though that were the case,
That’s — is that State double jeopardy

law, or is it statutory law, or what?
MR. LEAGUE:

It would be State law.

It well may be

Is there any decision of your Supreme

Court that supports that proposition?
MR. LEAGUE;

What I just said about the lesser

QUESTIONS That would say that if this misdemeanor

MR, LEAGUE;

or the interior cite within relies on one of the Philippine
Island casea, decided by this Court back in the early 1900’s.

I do not know, Your Honor.

Without violating

the double jeopardy clause, whether in your State or in any
other court in the federal system?
MR. LEAGUE: That’s right;, yes, sir,

MR. LEAGUE;

Isn't that correct?
That's what I understand, .yes, sir.

I'm sorry for that, Your Honor.

voice has no carriage, I knew that.
Returning to why this matter should or should not
be waived, I would just say that in reference to these things
that we know are not waived, that there's no dispute about
whether or not they're not waived.
They seem to have, at least one common factor, which
is absent from this case, and that is that the plea is not
a reliable indicator, the valid basis for it exists here, if
we cut out Perry's allegations, that he pled to receive a
totally concurrent sentence.

That was his expectation.

We see he traded, an argument over double jeopardy,
for a sentence of about three and a half months.
So I think under that basis it could well be assumed
that there was a basis for the plea —
QUESTION: Does that bring you up against the Pearce
.J

.2S—7KKSM33

case, about increasing sentences, in any way?
MR. LEAGUE:

No, sir, I don't think Pearce is

applicable to this case, by virtue of really what we said in

18

the Colten decision, that the possibility for vindictive
punishment does not occur sufficiently within the two-tier
system to warrant the imposition of the prophylactic rule
in Pearce*
Nov/, in any given case, Your Honor, it could be
the case, but there's not the incidence of it to warrant the
placing of the Pearce restrictions on this type situation,
QUESTION;

I suppose some of this comes down to

precisely what the word "offense” means in the Fifth Amendment
double jeopardy clause.

If you treat "offense" as being

synonymous with "criminal acts", you perhaps get one result.
If you treat "offense" as describing and meaning the offense
described in the indictment or charge, then perhaps you. get
another result.

Isn't that true?

MR. LEAGUE;
QUESTION;
MR. LEAGUE:
QUESTION;
MR. LEAGUE:

Yes, sir, you would.
Which do you think it is?
The former,
The same act?
Yes, sir,

QUESTION: Well, then, how could he be — then why
haven't you got a double jeopardy problem?
MR. LEAGUE;

I think you don't get it, Your Honor,

because there's no real risk of punishment, that inherent in
the double jeopardy system you have to have that risk, and
you don't have it in the lower District Court, so long as the

19

plea is voidable by the defendant.

Pardon me, the verdict is

voidable by the defendant.
That would be ray impression of the case.
It was also suggested, I believe, that a basis would
be, from Judge Larkins’ standpoint, was that the reason was
— pardon me, the right was fundamental.
I don't think much need be said about that. They are
all that way. And I believe this Court rejected that idea
recently in the school taxation cases.
It's true that if sustained this plea could bar
the prosecution entirely, but that would be the case, I think,
with any given constitutional right in a particular case.
And, lastly, the retroactive decision idea of
Mr. Keenan, I had thought x^ould not aid him if he won on his
major contention, there wouldn’t be any necessity to come to
this; and if he did not, it wouldn't help.
Absent any questions, I’ll rest there, and thank
you very much for your attention.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
Mr. Keenan.

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OP JAMES E. KEENAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KEENAN:

Mr, Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
I appear on behalf of respondent Jimmy Seth Perry.
With the Court's permission I would like to run
briefly back over the facts because, though they are a little
bizarre, I nevertheless think that what happened in this case
was rather clear.
On August 1, 1969, Jimmy Perry was serving a five­
to- seven-year sentence in the North Carolina Department of
Corrections for uttering a forged instrument.
On that day a fellow inmate by the name of Eugene
Sawyer received a fourteen-inch cut in his back.

An

investigation ensued by the authorities of the Odom Farm Unit
in Northhampton County, North Carolina, and on the 13th day of
August 1969, a warrant was sworn out by a prison guard
charging Jimmy Seth Perry with the misdemeanor of assault
with a deadly weapon.
On August 20th, 1969, Mr. Perry was brought to court
in the Northhampton County District Court, which is the
proper court in North Carolina for the trial of misdemeanors.
All misdemeanors must be tried in the first instance at the
District Court level.
On that date the solicitor or the District Attorney

21

who was trying the case, after conferring with the officer,
felt that the conduct necessitated a charge of a felony.
Therefore he made a motion in open court to amend the warrant,
to charge the felony of assault with a deadly weapon with
intent to kill, resulting in serious bodily injury.
Under North Carolina lav? they would then proceed to
hold a preliminary hearing in the District Court, but not a
trial.
However, later that same day, the solicitor learned
that the victim, Mr. Sawyer, would refuse to testify against
Mr. Perry? and, in fact, was claiming total lack of recall
as to what happened.
Therefore he had a very practical problem.

He did

have a statement that Mr. Perry had made to the officer, who
had sworn out the warrant:

yes, he had cut him, but it had

been an accident.
Therefore, the solicitor made a deliberate choice
to move again, to reamend the warrant to charge the misdemeanor.
QUESTION:

Had the trial court granted the first

motion?
MR. KEENAN:
the charge to a felony.

Yes, sir, it had.

It had been ~~ amended

And the record of the warrant shows

the various markings on it, that it was first a misdemeanor,
then a felony, then a misdemeanor again.
He proceeded to trial in cistrict Court on a plea of

22
not guilty to the misdemeanor.

He was tried before the court

alone, because under North Carolina law one charged with a
misdemeanor is not entitled to a jury trial in the District
Court.
He then, after conviction, —
QUESTION:

And as to that, there couldn't have

been a felony charge in that court?
MR. KEENAN:

He could not have been tried for a

felony in that court.
QUESTION: That's what I mean, yes.
MR. KEENAN:

That court could have conducted a

preliminary hearing on the —
QUESTION: But he couldn't have been tried there?
MR. KEENAN:

No, he could not have been.

He then appealed to the Northhampton County Superior
Court, which is his absolute right under North Carolina, law.
Upon giving a notice of appeal, the solicitor then
asked the judge if they could go up on the felony.
judge said:

Fine.

The

And found probable cause on a felony

warrant, which at. that point didn't even exist.
The State then took an indictment to the Northhampton
County Grand Jury —
QUESTION:

Here now — I think you lost me there.

You said the solicitor asked the judge if he could go up on
the felony.

23

MR, KEENAN:
QUESTION;

Yes, this was -Now, what do you mean by that?

MR. KEENAN;

This was after Mr. Perry had been given

a six-month sentence ~
QUESTION;
MR. KEENAN;

He had been convicted of the misdemeanor?
Appealed ~

QUESTION; And sentenced.
MR. KEENAN;
QUESTION;

And sentenced, and appealed.
And appealed.

And an appeal sets aside

that conviction and sentence, does it not, automatically?
MR. KEENAN:

Yes, it does, and it entitles him to

a trial de novo —
QUESTION; Right.
MR. KEENAN:

— in the Superior Court.

QUESTION: Right.
MR. KEENAN:

The solicitor then inquired of the

judge if he could go up on the felony.
QUESTION:

Now, what do you mean by can I — may I -—

"Judge, can I go up on a felony"?
MR. KEENAN:

What does that mean?

In effect it means that:

since he's

appealed, I've decided I want to try him on the felony
rather than the misdemeanor, the second time around.
QUESTION:

Well, why did he have to ask the District

Judge's permission?
MR. KEENAN:

Well, I would contend that he had no

24

right to ask anybody's permission, —
QUESTION:

No.

MR. KEENAN:

because, at that point he was bound

by his election to trial on
QUESTION: Well, I know that’s your contention. But
why do you suppose he thought he had to ask anybody's
permission?
MR. KEENAN:

Because I think he wanted to find a

probable cause on the question of a — on the subject of a
felony.

To take to the Grand Jury for proper action by the

Grand Jury.
QUESTION:

Then he would proceed to a preliminary

hearing, does he?
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:

Pardon?
Did the judge then have a preliminary

hearing?
MR. KEENAN:

No, there was no new hearing conducted.

The ~
QUESTION: Well, what kind of proceeding is it?
QUESTION:
MRo KEENAN:

Yeah.
It was a farcical proceeding in this

particular case.
QUESTION: Well, is there any provision for it under
North Carolina law?
MR. KEENAN:

No.

Under North Carolina law they could

25

have conducted a trial, which they did conduct, on a
misdemeanor? they could have conducted a preliminary hearing
on a felony.
QUESTION;

And then bound him over to the Superior

Court.
MR. KEENAN:

And then bound him over to the Grand

Jury.
But they did conduct a trial on the misdemeanor —QUESTION;

You mean on both, sort of.

MR. KEENAN;

They only conducted one set of factual

hearings.
QUESTION:

Yes. Right.

MR. KEENAN; But, in effect, made two judgments.
The first judgment was to give him a six-month
sentence ~~
QUESTION; They tried him and convicted him on a
misdemeanor —
MR. KEENAN;
QUESTION:

Yes.
— and then they more or less had a

preliminary hearing and bound him over on the felony.

Is

that it?
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION;
QUESTION;
of order?

No new evidence was heard.
No.

But on no

new evidence.

Did they enter a judgment or any kind

26

MR, KEENAN:

Yes, tile judge — the minutes of that

day show that the judge, on his trial calendar, did enter a
notation of a six-month sentence.

It also shows that on the

official minutes he entered the finding of a probable cause
after a plea of not guilty to a misdemeanor and a finding of
guilty®
Under North Carolina procedure, that is an
impossible set of circumstances:

where he, in effect, was

tried on a misdemeanor, pled not guilty, found guilty, then
the minutes say probable cause found and is bound over to
the Grand Jury.
That is, just simply, not a possible procedure; but
that is in fact what the minutes show.
QUESTION; Do you ordinarily have a preliminary
hearing before the solicitor takes the case to the Grand Jury
in North Carolina?
MR. KEENAN:

It's not required to, Your Honor, but

it is the normal procedure:

that a person charged with a

felony in the first instance will be brought into District
Court, will be appointed counsel if he needs counsel, is
entitled to counsel.
will be conducted.

At that point a preliminary examination
If the judge finds probable cause, it

will be bound over to the Grand Jury.
The solicitor does have the option of going directly
to the Grand Jury.

27
QUESTION:

Mr. Keenan, is any of this in the re corcl?

MR. KEENAN:

Yes.

Tlie original petition, the pro se

petition of Mr. Perry, basically set forth the facts that he
had been tx'ied, given six months —
QUESTION: Well, you're not talking about this, though?
MR. KEENAN:
in the record.

No.

No.

I'm talking about his petition

I'm not talking about the brief.

QUESTION: Right.
QUESTION; But this is not the brief, this is the
Appendix I'm looking at.
MPv. KEENAN: The Appendix just contains excerpts
from the petition.

I believe the record itself shows that

Mr. Perry pled in his petition that he had been tried in the
District Court —
QUESTION:

Mo, I'm talking about all this you said

that the man came in and said, and he said, and she said, and
the solicitor said.
MR. KEENAN:. .. No.

No, that's not in the record.

That has been gained from my discussion with the counsel
involved in the case.
The record -QUESTION:
MR, KEENAN:

So it's third-hand.
Second-hand, I reckon.
»

QUESTION;
MR. KEENAN:

Second-handed hearsay!
The record does show that Mr. Perry was

28

tried on a misdemeanor, given a six-month sentence, appealed,
and then indicted on a felony.

The State, in its answer,

admitted these allegations.
So there was no evidentiary hearing conducted in
the District Court on these allegations.
We contend -- well, to finish up briefly.
After — after the matter had been bound over to
the Grand Jury, he was indicted for the felony, the ten-year
felony.

He came in to court.

He had a disagreement with his

lawyer, a new lawyer was appointed.

And at that time a plea

of guilty was entered, as charged, to the ten-year felony.
And he was given a five to seven-year sentence concurrent
with the sentence being served at that time.
Which, the District Court found, effectively raised
his sentence by one year, five months, and one day over the
sentence received in the District Court.
How, our basic contention is, first, that the act
of the State in proceeding to charge Perry and attempt to try
him with a felony in the Superior Court denied Perry double
jeopardy, and that, therefore, there was ~~ there is an
independent constitutional violation we can show.
QUESTION :
MR. KEENAN:

Granted —
Pardon?

QUESTION:

Granted it's —

QUESTION:

Subjective, yes

29

MR. KEENAN;

Granted? right.

We contend this because Perry, in appealing the
misdemeanor conviction, we allege, did not waive his double
jeopardy right as to a felony charge with which the State had
chosen not to :.fcry

him in the first instance.

QUESTION;
not that is

Do you have an authority on whether or

Federal authority on —

MR, KEENAN;

We think Green and Price control this

particular instance.
QUESTION;

Well, he was never charged with the -—•

he was never charged with the felony when he was first tried
fpr the misdemeanor.
MR. KEENAN:

That is correct.

But we think what's

important is that the State had the full opportunity to make
a decision whether they were going to proceed on the felony
or the misdemeanor.
QUESTION;
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION;

No, that isn't Green.
It's not Green exactly —
And there's no case that you can cite,

is there?
MR. KEENAN:

Well, Wood vs. Ross in the Fourth

Circuit.
QUESTION:

Well, it’s not here, you haven't any

cases here on that, have you?
MR. KEENAN;

No, but I contend that the rationale

30

of the —
QUESTIONs
MR. KEENAN:

Oh, I knov? what you contend
—» of Green and

Rice cannot be

distinguished.
Excuse me/ Green and —
QUESTION:

Green was a case in the federal system/

wasn' t it?
MR. KEENAN:

Right.

And Price was a case in the State

system/ in which I think the Green test was basically applied.
QUESTION: But he was never acquitted — he was
neither convicted nor acquitted of the felony?
MR. KEENAN:

That is correct.

In the District

Court,
QUESTION: Well, he was never — he was never — when
he was tried for the misdemeanor he was never either acquitted
or convicted of the felony.
MR* KEENAN: That is correct.
QUESTION:

He couldn’t have been tried for it there,

even.
MR. KEENAN;

He could not have been tried for the

felony in the District Court.
QUESTION:

So when was he ever tried or convicted or

acquitted of the felony, twice?
MR. KEENAN:

Our contention is that the State, in a

matter like this, has to make en election. They are not free,

31
through a series of successive courts, to keep elevating the
charge up, simply by arguing that the lower court did not
have jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

Well, they don't have to make an election

as to — -they could have tried him for both in the first
instance.
MR. KEENAN;

Ho, they could not. Because there was

only one incident here.
QUESTION:

Well, they could have — they could have,
think
I suppose, had one -— do you/this one was a lesser included
offense?
ME. KEENANs

There's no question, under North

Carolina lav;, that it is a lesser included offense,
QUESTION;

All right.

So they could have tried,

him for both of them, then, in the —- not in the lower court
but in the court to which it appealed?
MR. KEENAN;

Absolutely not.

QUESTION; Well, suppose the State had tried out —
started out with the felony.
MR. KEENAN;
QUESTION:

Okay.
And indicted him in the Superior Court.

Now, they would have tried him for the felony and they could
have found him guilty of the lesser offense?
MR. KEENAN: That is correct.
QUESTION: So they could have tried him for both

32

tilings?
MR. KEENAN:

No. they — tliey could have tried

him on the felony and found him guilty of the misdemeanor.
They could not — they could not, in effect, have two
successive trials —
QUESTION:

Well, he could not have been convicted,

I gather, on the felony indictment, both of the felony and the
misdemeanor.
MR, KEENAN: That’s correct.
QUESTION:

He could have been convicted of the

felony or the jury could have convicted him of the misdemeanor.
MR. KEENAN: That’s correct.
QUESTION: And if they had tried him on the felony
and the jury convicted him of the misdemeanor, certainly then
he could not be tried again for the felony.
QUESTION:
MR, KEENAN:

Under Green,
That's correct.

QUESTION: That’s Green.
MR. KEENAN:

Right.

But x/e contend that the State was not free, having
made their election in the first instance, to then reverse
course and attempt to try him on the felony in the Superior
Court.
QUESTION:

You're saying, in effect, that they’ ve

done the same — attempted the same thing as they went through

33

with in Green.
MR. KEENANs Right.

Right.

And the major point I would make is that we would
contend that if Perry had not appealed

for instance, he

had been given the six-month sentence in the District Court;
if he had said, Fine, that's a just sentence and I'll take
my punishment and go off to jail — we certainly contend, at
that point, the State would not have been free to turn around
and say:

Well, you're going up to Superior Court on this

felony charge.
QUESTION: Well, I gather that you — your brother
agrees, at least under North Carolina law, they could not
have tried him on the felony charge had he not appealed the
misdemeanor conviction.
As I understood his argument, it is that they could
try him on the felony charge because his appeal from the
misdemeanor conviction reopened —
MR. KEENAN:

I know of no other way they could have

tried — could have retried it.
QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION: What is the North Carolina rule?

Is it

a constitutional rule or statutory rule or a rule of
practice, or what?
If you
conviction —

assume he had an appeal from his misdemeanor

34

MR. KEENAN;
a rule of practice.

Well, in North Carolina, it's basically
But I would also contend it's a

constitutional rule.
QUESTION:
in North Carolina?

I see.

But actually how .is it articulated

Just as a rule of practice?

MR. KEENAN:

Yes.

I mean that it's not articulated

in a written form.
QUESTION:

You just — as long as a misdemeanor

conviction stands, they just don't convict him

they just

don't charge him with a felony.
MR. KEENAN:

Right, Because if it's a felony, they

can try him for that in the first instance.

They're not

forced to, in effect, try him for the lesser included offense
and then go on and try him for the felony later.

They have

the option in the first instance to proceed with the —
QUESTION:

Well, anyway, that's your practice.

MR. KEENAN:

— with proceeding with the felony.

QUESTION: But you also submit that that practice is
required by the United States Constitution, don't you?
MR, KEENAN:

Yes.

That’s exactly what we submit.

We submit that when the State has made an election,
they are bound by that election, that they are not free then
to proceed and try to elevate the charge at a de novo proceeding
in the Superior Court.
QUESTION:

And as my brother Brennan suggested, I

35

understood your opponent here to agree with you, if the case
we re that the original misdemeanor conviction had been
unappealed, and been undisturbed.
I think the representative of the Attorney General
of your State says:

yes, in that case, we would not.

understood him to say:

And I

We could not then bring a felony

prosecution for precisely the same event.
MR. KEENAN:

That's our position.

QUESTION:

And the only question is whether that

rule is different or disappears when, at the defendant’s
behest, the original conviction was set aside.
MR. KEENAN:

Right.

And we contend that a price

cannot be put on an appeal that one must face a more
elevated form merely for exercising the right to get that
appeal.
I want to touch on
QUESTION:

Well, that's a different point. That's

not a double jeopardy point.
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:
MR. KEENAN:

Right, It's a due process point.
Yes, due process.
But I think that the due process and

double jeopardy, at this point, begins to merge.
QUESTION: Wall, what you're saying is that it's a
burden on the appeal.
MR. KEENAN: There's no question about that.

36

QUESTION:

To try to defeat it or attempt to, as

the State did here, by bringing in a felony indictment.
QUESTION;

Is there anything in the record to show

what happened on the trial de novo on the misdemeanor?
MR. KEENAN;
QUESTION:

Pardon?
Is there anything in the record to show

what happened, this man said I'm appealing —
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
Is there anything on the record to show

what happened to that?
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:

In the trial de novo of the misdemeanor?
Yes.

MR. KEENAN: There was no trial de novo.
QUESTION: Well, what happened to it?

It just

disappeared?
MR. KEENAN:
indictment.

It disappeared into the felony

Ihat's what happened to it.

He was never brought

to Superior Court on the misdemeanor.
QUESTION: What was the maximum sentence that he was
subject to on the misdemeanor?
MR. KEENAN: Two years.
Under North Carolina law, —
QUESTION: And what did he get on the felony?
MR. KEENAN;

He got five to seven years concurrent.

QUESTION: Right.

37

MR. KEENAN:

With the sentence being served, which

effectively raised his sentence by one year, five days and
one month,

[sic]
QUESTION:

In your de novo appeal to the Superior

Court on your misdemeanor, I take it it's then up to the State
to reinstitute the prosecution all over again in the Superior
Court,
MR. KEENAN: Right.
QUESTION:

It isn't a question of a hearing on the

record or of the defendant having to take the initiative to
bring the case to the court's attention.
MR. KEENAN: That is correct.

The solicitor sets

the matter down for trial on the warrant, generally, the
misdemeanor warrant, and the case is heard, all over, the
judgment is stricken, in effect, and the defendant is given
a jury trial in this instance, which he cannot waive.
I would like to make one brief point regarding the
jury trial.
In order to get a jury trial, which he was
constitutionally entitled to because the matter on which he
was being tried carried a. maximum sentence of two years,
he had to first submit to a non-jury trial in District Court
because there is no provision under North Carolina law fox- a
jury trial in the District Court.
We contend that this was unconstitutional and that

38

it deprived hira of the right of a jury trial for two reasons :
First, this Court held in Ward vs. Village of
Monroeville that there is no authority for the proposition
that a constitutional right can be deferred on the ground that
it is available at a subsequent de novo proceeding.
QUESTION:

Before you — excuse me; I apologize

for interrupting you, but I'm curious.

Does the record show

or do you know why, after having pleaded not guilty to a
misdemeanor, he then pleaded guilty to a felony?
MR. KEENAN: The record doesn't show because there
was no hearing held in the District Court.
QUESTION: But you told us that at the earlier stage,
the first trial, the man who x-ms cut would not testify against
him.
MR. KEENAN:

And the man would not testify at the

second trial, either.
QUESTION: Well, why did he plead guilty?
MR. KEENAN:

He pled guilty —■ and I base this on

conversations with him and his attorney
no evidentiary hearing.

again there has been

He pled guilty because, all of a

sudden, tills charge which carried a maximum sentence of two
years, he was faced with a ten~year felony, which we contend
he could not constitutionally be placed in jeopardy of, and
was in effect offered a deal —
QUESTION:

Well, then it was plea bargaining.

39

MR. KEENAN;

in which he was told that lie would

get a concurrent type sentence if he pled guilty.
QUESTION;

I see.

MR. KEENAN;
QUESTION:

So, in effect, he ran.
Unh-hunh.

MR. KEENAN;

If I can come back to the jury trial

issue for just a moment.
In Colten, this Court held that a sentence on trial
de novo could be increased in a two-tier court system, such
as that held in North Carolina.
We contend under this decision and under the
decision of United States vs. Jackson this creates a dilemma,
in that a defendant who has to appeal to get his jury trial
of right, because this was a two-year misdemeanor, has to
run tiie risk of an increased punishment.
find we contend this is precisely what the Court said
in Jackson cannot be the case, with the exercise of a right
to a jury trial.
QUESTION; Well, but he was never sentenced as a
result of the District Court's judgment -MR. KEENAN;

Yes , he was .

sentenced to six months.
QUESTION;
MR. KEENAN;

Yes , he was,

He was

He appealed.

And that vacated the tiling, without more.
That's correct.

But he was placed in

jeopardy of receiving up to two years in prison in the District

40
Court without his constitutional right to a jury trial.
That's our point.
QUESTION s

But he was never charged in the Superior

Court.
MR. KEENAN:
Superior

He was charged with a felony in the

Court.
QUESTION:

Yes, but not with the crime he was

charged with in District Court.
MR. KEENAN:

No, he was charged with the greater

included offense to what he was tried in the District. Court.
QUESTION:

Well, the State says a separate offense.

MR.KEENAN:

No, it's trial *— I don’t think there's

any question but it's a greater included offense.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

"greater included" — what's that?
That's a novel term:

greater included

offense.
Tiie State says the elements of the crime tried in
the Superior Court were different than the elements of the
crime tried in the District Court.
QUESTION: They were, weren't they?
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:

They included txtfo additional elements.
Which you didn't have to prove in the

misdemeanor trial.
MR. KEENAN:

Which did not have to be proved in the

misdemeanor trial. That is correct.

41

QUESTIONS And on de novo, misdemeanor trial would
not have to prove either.
MR, KEENANs

That is correct also.

QUESTION: But I gather, had he got his de novo
Superior Court trial ~~ this is Superior Court, is it, in
your State?
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.
— ha ran the risk of getting his

sentence increased if found guilty by the jury, from six
months to two years?
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct.
Whereas, what in fact happened to him,

instead of ~ he could have got up — not more than two years,
instead of which he gets five years and seven months.
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:
MR. KEENAN:

Well, what could have happened —
I mean five to seven years.
Right.

Though it was concurrent.

Nevertheless, it did

effectively raise by a year and a half the sentence he
received in District Court.
QUESTION: Does the State have the option of
starting a misdemeanor trial in the Superior Court?
MR. KEENAN:

No, it does not.

It must try a

misdemeanor in the first instance in the District Court.
The statute is cited in my brief on that score.

The State

42
has to proceed in the first instance to the District Court on
a misdemeanor,,

On a felony it can proceed directly to the

Superior Court, or it can proceed to the District Court for a
preliminary hearing and then on to Superior Court for trial.
A misdemeanor can be tried twice;

first in the

District Court, secondly in the Superior Court de novo.
QUESTION:

When was this Code — when was this

codified in your State?
MR. KEENAN r

This has been the procedure for years.

I really can't give you the date, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION;
MR. KEENAN;
QUESTION:
MR. KEENAN;

A hundred years or so?
Pardon?
A hundred years or more?
I would think so, yes, sir.

It’s an

old established procedure, in the State of North Carolina.
Of course we've got a problem in that Mr. Perry
pled guilty in the Superior Court to the felony, and I realize
the burden to distinguish that from the Brady

trilogy and

from Tollett vs. Henderson.
We contend that there are several telling distinc­
tions .
In the first place, and of course this is -- I'll
state this is, in effect, taking, as granted, the validity of
the double jeopardy argument, on which the whole argument is
based.

The first argument is that in each of those prior

43

cases there was a legitimate State interest in punishing the
person for the crime to which the guilty plea was entered.
We disagree with Mr. League that the double jeopardy
clause is designed just to protect the innocent.

I think

it’s clear that it also is designed to protect the guilty from
repeated punishment.
And we contend that the State had no legitimate
interest in this particular instance in punishing Jimmy Seth
fef .
W

Perry on a felony of assault with a deadly weapon with
intent to kill, inflicting serious bodily injury.

They lost

that right when they made a determination to proceed with a
misdemeanor in the District Court.
Secondly, we contend that on the issues involved in
the other cases there was a situation that existed where, if
the infirmities involved were corrected, the trial could proceed
and punishment could be imposed.
For instance, in the case of Tolletfc vs. Henderson,
4

.Vi

in an illegally constituted grand jury, this was not to tell
the defendant he is free to go, it —
QUESTION: Well, what would you 3ay if the defendant
says to his lav/yer:
And he says:

well, can I be tried on this felony?

Well, that’s an unsettled issue; it’s about

fifty-fifty, I would gu<»ss, in the Supreme Court.

I don’t

know whether you’ll win or not, but mw we’ve got to make a
choice now.

44
The prosecutor says:
two years if you plead guilty.

Well, we'll give you a deal,
How, it may be that you

shouldn't plead guilty at all, because that would be double
jeopardy.
The prosecutor doesn't think it's double jeopardy?
I think it is, but I don't know whether I'm right or not.
MR* KEENAM:

In that particular instance, where

there is a conscious discussion of the fact that the issue
was there, and that it can be presented or not presented,
based on tactical considerations, I think that it could
properly be held to be a surrender of double jeopardy to plead
guilty.
But what I am saying is that in an issue such as
double jeopardy, that fact has to be there.
QUESTION:

Well, neither Tollett nor McMann

certainly spoke in terms of conscious decision and consultation,
they said that once you have the guilty plea that's the end
of it, so far as everything that antedated the guilty plea,
regardless of any waiver type test like yo*i have in your
right of counsel cases.
MR. KEENAN:

Right.

That is correct, but what we're

alleging is, in those particular instances the fact that the
person pled guilty was significant, because of the fact that
the guilty plea, in effect, resolved the factual matters at
issue in the case

45

QUESTION;

Then the guilty plea would have

based on — entered after adequate representation by counsel.
MR. KEENAN:

Yas.

In this particular instance,, the fact that Jimmy
Seth Perry may in fact have been guilty of a felony, we
contend is just totally irrelevant.

If our double jeopardy

claim is valid.
The fact that he may have in fact committed the
felony would not, in effect, give the State the right to —
QUESTION:

Well, if you were representing a defendant

and you were as sure of your double jeopardy point as you are
here, you would never permit him to plead guilty, would you?
MR, KEENAN:

That is correct.

I would not have

pleaded Mr. Perry guilty.
QUESTION;

Now — so, in Brady and the cases

suggested suggest that perhaps these cases, once the guilty
plea is in, should turn into a representation of counsel
case.
MR, KEENAN;

That is correct.

QUESTION: Would you think that in view of the state
of the law that the attorney representing Mr. Perry was —
furnished inadequate representation by not permitting ■— by
permitting him to plead guilty?
MR, KEENAN:

I'm, in this instance, speaking out­

side the record, because I've had frequent discussions with

46

the attorney recently regarding this.

At the time the

attorney had no comprehension that such an issue existed.
He did not discuss it with Mr. Perry.

He thought in terms of

the fact that it was trial de novo, and therefore the State
was free to do what they
QUESTION:

pleased.

Well, you —* it's hard for you to find

a case anywhere also supporting you, isn't it?
On double jeopardy.
MR* KEENAN:
Price support me,

I don't think so.

I think Green and

I don't think the double jeopardy question

is that hard to see.

I think — in fact I think it's a clear

double jeopardy question.
I think that the attorney should have been aware of
the fact that it did exist.
QUESTION:

You speak rather readily of what you

would do, but what if the defendant said:
pleading guilty.

I insist on

And it's quite clear that he has that right,

isn't it?
MR. KEENAN;

Yes,

I think a person has a right to

waive double jeopardy, so long as he knows he's waiving it.
I don't have any problem with that.
If he makes an intelligent and knowing decision that
yes, it’s in my best interests for tactical reasons to, let's
say, plead guilty, even though I may have
QUESTION;

Well, would you say that if — would

47
you say that if the concept of double jeopardy were an
absolute bar to a second prosecution, where it applies?
MR. KEENAN:

There might be a situation, Mr,

Justice Brennan, where a person, let's say, is charged with
ten felonies —
QUESTION: Well, what is the concept of double
jeopardy?

Isn’t it supposed to be an absolute bar to a

later prosecution, in any situation where it applies?
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:

That’s what I believe it to be.
Well, I must confess I'm surprised to

hear you say it can be waived.
MR. KEENAN:

I would say it only can be waived

only in the instance where a person knows in fact what he's
doing.

I can see tactical situations where it might be

waived.
QUESTION:
QUESTION:

I don’t follow that.
The exclusionary rule of Ilapp v. Ohio

is an absolute bar to the introduction of evidence wrongfully
seized? but certainly that could be waived, couldn't it?
MR. KEENAN:

Certainly.

QUESTION: That’s quite different from double jeopardy.
QUESTION:

I didn't suggest it was the same right

as the double jeopardy right.
[Laughter. 3
MR. KEENAN:

One other point we wish to make is that

48
with regard to double jeopardy the law on which Mr. Perry
primarily was basing his claim in the District Court, Wood vs,
Ross r a Fourth Circuit decision, post-dated the entering of
his guilty plea.
We contend that the fact that double jeopardy has
been given retroactive effect is significant on this particular
score.
I realise in prior cases this Court has held that
when a guilty plea is made it's not set aside merely because
later developments of the law may in fact give a person a
valid claim.
But, again, we would go back to our position that
in these particular instances the State did have a legitimate
interest in punishing the person for the charge involved,
in this particular instance there is no legitimate interest.
And, secondly, to perhaps join the point Mr.
Justice Brennan just briefly made, this is an instance where,
if a person knew of the double jeopardy bar, particularly
in the facts of this particular case, there would have been
no reason in the world to waive it.
QUESTION; Well, there was no legitimate interest if
there was double jeopardy.
MR. KEENAN:

If there was — I'll grant you, I've

got to convince this Court there was a double jeopardy viola­
tion, or the denial of the right to a jury trial? one or the

49

other.

I can't prevail if there was no constitutional

deprivation.

I’ll concede that.

QUESTION:

Well, what's the State supposed to do

when the double jeopardy question is unsettled?
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION:

I think —
Try him or not?

MR. KEENAN:

I think the State has the right to

pursue to trial.
QUESTION: Well, then it has an .interest, doesn't it?
MR. KEENAN:

Yes, it does.

But the State — if the

double jeopardy issue should be decided against the State,
then the State's interest is forfeited -*~
QUESTION: Well, in that context, the question is
about a plea of guilty.
MR. KEENAN:
QUESTION;

Ri gh fc.
In that — against the background of

that unsettled state of the law,
MR. KEENAN:

The State

the State does have an

interest, but the question of whether or not the guilty plea
surrenders or forfeits the double jeopardy claim, we think
in the question of double jeopardy, which we do see as an
absolute bar to retrial, brings about the fact that the State
must in fact shew that the person consciously made a decision
to surrender the right.
A second conceivable situation would be where a

50

person deliberately bypassed State remedies, though again
this would be a very, very rare case, because why would a
defendant forfeit a possible State remedy.
The other question that was brief related to what
Boykin requires, that a defendant be warned of.

If the rule

is to be a flat rule, that one who pleads guilty surrenders
any prior constitutional right, with no qualifications
whatsoever, we would contend that a defendant ought to be
told that, at the time he pleads guilty.
So that there can be no question in his mind that
this is not a matter that's going to be resolved through
later risk or through later court proceedings.
In this particular instance, the judge did run
through a series of form questions, which are in the record,
with the defendant, x^hich indicated that he was warned that
he could receive a certain maximum sentence, and that he did
have a right to trial by jury, and that he did have a right to
be represented by counsel, and so forth.
However, there is nothing in the record that
indicates — and in fact it wasn't asked — there's nothing
that indicates that Mr. Perry was informed;

If you plead

guilty here, don't ever come back to court on any constitutional
claim.
And we contend that if that is to be the rule, then
the defendant should be told precisely that.

Thank you very much, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Did Judge Larkins rule on the double —

on the Boykin type claim, or did he just not reach it?
MR. KEENAN:
Rehnquist.

He just didn't reach it, Mr. Justice

He held that there was a violation of double

jeopardy, one, and secondly that it wasn’t waived by the
plea of guilty.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. League, do you have

anything further?
