MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in 73-439# Lehman Brothers, 440 and 495, the related#
consolidated cases.
Mr. Hagan# you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES J. HAGAN, ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OP 9BS PETITIONERS
MR. HAGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice# and may it please

the Court:
These three cases are here on the grant of a writ
of certiorari to the court of appeals for the Second Circuit.
The issue has been limited to the question of whether the
court of appeals erred in failing to certify the question of
Florida law to the Supreme Court of Florida# pursuant to its
cortification statute.

I will

speak for the petitioners in

the three cases which have been consolidated for argument. ■
And 1 would ask to reserve three minutes for rebuttal# Your
Honor.
It is the position off petitioners here# Your Honor#
that it was error for the Second Circuit to refuse to
certify the issue of Florida law to the Supreme Court of
Florida.
The decision below exemplifies a new doctrine under
Florida law or in fact the law of any state.

Although

purporting to find support under the case of Diamond v.

5

Orecmvag in the Court of Appeals of the State of Mew York,
the decisi m below here is in fact a radical extension of the
Dispond ce;ie.

The question of Florida lav? here is significant

under th® public policy of Florida.

It involves a Florida

corporation, and. it involves the regulation of that corporation's
relationship to its fiduciaries and to its shareholders and to
those who buy and sell its stock.
The decision below adopted a remedy here which could
interfere with recovery by shareholders of that corporation
when they sue- on an insider trading case.
Therefore, we believe that in light of the significant
question of Florida law and public policy that was involved,
the Court of Appeals should have certified the question as it
was requested to do by Judge Kaufman in his dissenting opinion.
Your Honors,, I would briefly discuss the underlying
facts in this case and the opinions below.
This case arose out of an alleged misuse of inside
information and subsequent insider trading.

Lum's Inc. is a

Florida corporation which was engaged in the fast food
franchising business.

During 1969 in an attempt at diversifi­

cation it acquired a gambling casino in Las Vegas known as
Caesar's Pale.ce.

And to acquaint the financial community with

its new acquisition, it held what if described as a seminar in
Caesar's Palace in November of 1969.
Apparently during that seminar it released an

6
earnings forecast of

$1 to $1.10 par share.

Subsequently in

January of 1970 ifc was alleged—and when I am making these
claims of allegations, I am basically stating the allegations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed a
complaint for injunctive relief in December of 1970»

All of the

subsequent civil cases are basically copiest if you will, of:
the SEC complaint.
Lit was alleged that one Melvin Chasen, who was
chief operating officer of Lum's, learned of a decline,
substantial decline, in the earnings for Lum’s second quarter
that he advised

Mr» Benjamin Simon, who was a registered

representative employed by Lehman Brothers in its Chicago
office, of this decline, and that Mr. Simon in turn passed on
this information to representatives of Investors Diversified
Services in Minneapolis.

All of these events were alleged to

have occurred on january 8th.

And on January 9th two of the

IDS funds sold 83,000 shares of Lum’s stock.
Trading was suspended on the 9th.

Lum’s issued a

press release later in the afternoon, announcing the decline, of
earnings.

When trading resumed the following Monday, fcha

stock was off $3 to $4..par share.

The sales on the previous

Friday had occurred at $17»
The SEC investigated and in the following Decttlsr,
as I said, they filed an injunction action.
followed by a rash of civil suits.

And that was

And those suits basically

7
fell into two categories.

One category consisted of derivative

actions sacking recovery by bum's of the trading profits.
second category was a class action.

The

Several suits constituted

class actions on behalf of sellers or purchasers of the stock on
the day of the tradeoff.
So, at the commencement of the litigation there
were three prongs to the regulatory structure, the SEC
injunction action, the derivative suits, and the class actions.
The defendants below moved to dismiss before Judge
Tyler the derivative action.

The derivative actions were

premised on the rule of Diamond, v, Oreamuno, which is a New
York case,

And that case briefly stated that officers and

directors of a corporation who trade on inside information are
required to remit their profits to the corporation, even though
the corporation has not been damaged in any legal sense.

The

court espoused this doctrine in the context of a situation
which was really a gross instance of misuse of corporate
information.

The two top officers of the company, MAI, had

learned of an earnings decline and sold their own stock,
triggering an enormous decline in the price of the shares.
As the case reached the Court of Appeals in New York
there were new other actions pending.
menced' a proceeding.

The SEC had not com­

Section ISb did not apply because the

stock had been held more than six months, and there were no
class actions or any actions pending by any of the defrauded

8
purchasers of that stock.

And so the argument before the

Court of Appeals and strongly urged in the brief by the
respondent was that if no remedy is fashioned here, these parties
escaped with the illegal profits.
Diamond case.

That was the context of the

It is the law in Mew York.

research, it. has never been
in any other state court.

To the best of our

cited or discussed in any decision
It is five years old now.

It came

down in 1969.
So, the derivative suits here were premised on the
Diamond case.

But It was the defendant's position that it was

the law of Florida that applied to the responsibility of
insiders to the corporation.
Q

The defendants here?

MR. HAGAN:

The defendants, Your Honor, were Lum's

Corporation, Mr. Chasen, Lehman Brothers and its employee
Benj&mift Simon, Investors Diversified Services and two of its
funds and two employees of IDS who are alleged to have
received the tip and recommended the sale of the stock.
Q

In the Diamond case the defendants were

corporate officers or directors?
MR. HAGAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

They were actually

corporate officers and directors, including directors who had
not actually mads the trades but had acquiesced in a situation
after they learned of the matter.

And the lower court had

dismissed the case against those directors.

And the appellate

9
division had affirmed and the Court of Appeals affirmed on that
point, holding only the wrongdoing officers and directors—
Q

Who had actually done the selling, who had

actually sold shares.
MR. HAGAN:

That had actually sold the shares»

In this case were any defendants corporate

officers or directors?
MR» HAGAN:

either.

Other than that, there was no relationship there

So, the only conceivable nexus between our ease and

Diamond was Mr. Chasen»
As I said, the defendants moved to dismiss on the
ground that Florida applied.

Under the law of Florida, you

first must show damage to your corporation before a derivative
suit will lie.

That even under Diamond, assuming arguendo

Diamond applied, there were no profits here on the part of any
defendant other than arguably the idea of funds.

And other

than Mr. Chasen, who had no profits, there were no fiduciaries:
involved.
Q

Mr. Hagan, I take it that Florida law does

10
apply here,
MR. HAGAN:

Your Honor, in the lower court before

Judge Tyler, the defendants argued that Florida law applied,
but the re;-:poriCu5nts disputed this point.

They argued

strenuously before Judge Tyler that New York law applied, and
they urged that the Diamond rule be imposed and that the rule
be expanded.

And the expansion, of course, had to proceed on

two grounds.

It had to go beyond the officer-director holding

of Diamond, because that was holding of Diamond, officers and
directors? and the rationale was encouragement of private
attorneys general to regulate the corporation.

It was phrased

in that manner.
They also had to go beyond Diamond to pick up
parties who had not profited, because again in Diamond only
the directors who had actually profited had been held liable.
So, there were two extensions of Diamond, and in
effect they ware urging a rule which really had very little
relationship back to the Diamond case, although that was the.
springboard for the argument.

Q

Did your clients make any request to Judge Tyler

that he certify that Florida law question to the Florida
courts?
MR. HAGAN:
Q

No, we did not, Your Honor.

The Florida statute does not take references.

MR. HAGAN:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan,

11
The Florida statutes- unlike other

.tutes in many states, only

©emits an appellate court to certify the question.

Subsequent

statutes in many of our states that have been adopted in the
last number of years have adopted the recommendation of the
uniform commissioners, the Uniform Act, and permit district
courts to certify.
But, in any event, the question was never raised
before Judge Tyler.
Q

When did you first request that this question

be certifified?
MR. HAGAN:

The first request was on the petition

for rehearing before the Second Circuit, Your Honor.
Q

It was after the decision came down, including

Judge Kaufman's dissent?
MR. HAGANs

That is correct.

Judge Kaufman’s

dissent was the first time the certification question was
raised, to the gesfc of my knowledge, by any 'litigant or
judge.
Q

Was there a reason for not moving for

certification before the decision?
MR. HAGAN:

Your Honor, 1 think as far as the present

petitioners were concerned, it was their position that the
law of Florida was not unclear or uncertain.
least let me clarify that.

Florida law—-at

It was not unclear to the extent

that Florida's law required that you show actual damages to

12

your Corporation before a derivative suit would lie.
Dia»y >nd. cave in Hew York flatly contradicted that.

The
It held no

damage requirement was necessary.
Secondly, to the extent that Florida had naver
discussed the Diamond, rule, it could have been argued, I suppose,
that if. war

therefore uncertain.

So, to that, extent, you could

either say the Florida law was settled against the respondents
or uncertain because they had never discussed Diamond and one
could, only speculate what they wovild do if Diamond was argued
to them.

But again, even if yon argued Diamond on the facts of

this case, this is not a Diamond situation.
Q

Have you answered Mr. Justice Blackmuns

is

there any dispute among the parties bow that Florida law is—
MR. HAGAN:
Mr. Justice Brennan.

Yes, 3: was getting to that.

I ©m sorry,

In the lower court, respondents argued

New York law? Judge Tyler found Florida law.

On appeal the

respondents, here, appellants before the Second Circuit, conceded
Florida law applied.
So, when Mr. Justice Waterman wrote his majority
opinion, ho pointed out both parties concede and we so find
that Florida law applied.

So that although there was a dispute

in the district court as to the proper choice of law, there was

no dispute before the Second Circuit on this point.
Q

And none here, of course?

MR. HAGANs

There appears to be none here, no.

13
Q

1 was jtist going to ask whether Judge Kaufman’s

dissent on the certification issue was really his own idea.
MR» HAGANs
9

Yes, Your Honor.

It was not discussed at oral argument.

MR. HAGANs

Not discussed at oral argument and not

discussed in the briefs.
Q

I presume if you had prevailed in the Second

Circuit without over certifying to the Supreme Court of Floridaf'
you would not be interested in certifying.
MR. HAGAN:

Your Honor, it was not our position

before the Second Circuit—-first of all,, the predicate for
certification is a finding that the law of the state is
unsettled or uncertain, and it was never our position and it is
not our position today actually that the law of Florida was so
uncertain ore unsettled.

It became that way for the first

time on the opinion out of the Second Circuit.

Prior to that

opinion, the 1aw of Florida as enunciated in four intermediate
appellate court opinions was that damages were required in a
situation like this.
Q

The Second Circuit cannot change the law of

Florida, can it?
MR. HASAN:

Your Honor, what the Second Circuit did

here, I subr.it, was impose a new rule on the law of Florida.
The Second Circuit here adopted as Florida's rule a doctrine
which no one can find in the law of Florida, at least none of tha

14
pas:--.;:lcvv

5

be-sr Ab.1© tv find It in the law of Florida.

Certainly

lry

friend from the respondents has been unable to

point out any Florida authorities in support.

And the majority

in the Second Circuit agreed that there were no Florida
precedents on point.
May 1 say5 Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it disregarded
the four decisions of the Florida intermediate appellate courts
on the damage point, exemplified
was 1966.

by Palma

v. Zerbey , which

It disregarded those in a footnote as not

persuasive because there had not been any extensive discussion
of th® question, and there had been some rather conclusory
statements citing earlier opinions,

And the only analysis of

it is in. that footnote where the court said it found these
cases not persuasive, and that was the end of the Florida
law as far as the majority opinion below was concerned.
Of course, our position had been that to that
extent the law is settled, and here you cannot state a claim
unless you can prove damages.
In any event, Judge Tyler™-X am sorry, Mr. Chief
Justice.
Q

And some of these cases that are cited here on

certification were suo sponte by the appellate court, were
they not?
MR. HAGAN%
Q

Which case?

1 am sorry.

I do not recall which one, but it was very, very

15
often.
MR. HAGAN:
here.

Yes, Your Honor.

This has happened

This Court has svto sponte certified questions on many

occasions.
Q

I do not know about many? but we did in Aldrich?

did we not?
MR. HAGAN:

You

did in Aldrich and you did in

Clay and’you did in, I believe, Dresner v. City of Tallahasee.
Q

I remember Aldrich was suo sponte.

MR. HAGAN:
suo sponte.

Was Clay?

I believe Clay also? Your Honor, was

2 do not believe that anyone had requested

certification there.

In fact? I believe that is the first

reported decision that I am aware of where the question arose.
And this Court has many times of course expressed
its views on certification, the appropriateness of it? even
those on the Court that have expressed reservations about the
whole abstention doctrine and the problems it raises have
often times endorsed certification.
In any avent--1" am sorry, are there any other
questions on that point?
Judge Tyler found that Florida law applied.
found that damages were required.

He decided the question

The ones that

profited were not officers or directors.
Whan the case went up to the Second Circuit, the
majority in effect—-they did reverse Judge Tyler.
that there was no Florida law on point.

They found

They believed they hat

the right to look to the law of other states, specifically New
York

and the Diamond rule, and they then extended the Diamond

rule in several respects.

They extended the concept of the

fiduciary beyond the officer and director category to pick up,
as they put it, anyone who receives inside information becomes
ipso facto a fiduciary.

Although they did not use the term,

I suppose the concept would be something akin to a constructive
fiduciary once he received the information.
They then postulated a common enterprise theory,
cited certain anti-trust cases to support the proposition, and
then said as in a conspiracy

situation or a joint tort that

all of the defendants wore liable for the profits of any one.
They spent some time discussing the problems with law of inside;
trading and the necessity to tighten the doctrine.
Judge Kaufman's dissent agreed, of course—and there
is no issue here—on the condemnation of insider trading.

He

held; however, that the majority had invented a totally new
concept of law, even under the law of New York.

Petitions for

It was urged on the court that the matter

be certified, but it was not, denied, and we are now here on
certiorari.
And we urge, Your Honor, that it was error for
the court to refuse to certify in this area.

This decision

has imposed, in effect, a new regulatory framework upon
trading in the stock of•Florida corporations.
‘0

May I ask, Mr. Hagan, if there were not this

Florida procedure, would this

be a case for a federal

abstention?
MR. HAGAN :
Q

We believe it would be, Your Honor.

There i~. no constitutional question to be

avoided„
MR. IIAGAN:
cuacioion

in

’Your Honor, we feel that -under this Court5-

Thibodaux and in

Kaiser Steel, this would be

the type of question--fchere is no neat characterisation of
when a question like this can really.be said to support

—j ■
i

abstention, but we believe that even if you did not have a
certification statute, strong argument could be•made here for
abstention because of the policy questions involved.
After all, this is a Florida corporation.

The

State of Florida has expressed its own public policy by
adopting a certification statute, the first state to do so in

v

18
1945, that it would like to have a say in what the law of
Florida is.

And for a federal court to discuss the duties and

liabilities flowing from certain factual situations involving
a Florida corporation seems to me-—
Q

That is an argument whether this would habe been

a case for absrention»
HR. HAGAN:
Q

That is; you are right.

As long as Florida has this statute, the federal

courts ought to avail themselves.
MR. HAGAN:
Q

That is our position, Your Honor.

Mr. Hagan, do you think it makes any difference

that Thibodaux arose in a district court in Louisiana and
depended an Louisiana law and Kaiser arise in a district court
in New Mexico and depended on New Mexico law, whereas this
arose in the Southern District of New York and depended on
Florida law?
MR. HAGAN:

I think it makes our case much stronger,

Your Honor, because—
Q

Why?

MR.. HAGAN:

Because in those situations presumably

the federal court sitting in those districts would be
knowledgeable in the law of. the jurisdiction.

The district

court sitting in Louisiana could be presumed to be more
knowledgeable of Louisiana law than say
court.

a New York federal

And it is rather ironic here, Your Honor, to think that

19

if this case had arisen in the Fifth Circuit within which
Florida lies, this question would undoubtedly, if one can read
the Fifth Circuit precedents correctly, would have been
certified to the Supreme Court of Florida,

The Fifth Circuit

has used this procedure on many occasions,
Q

What does the district, according to the

Southern District of New York, tell these litigants to do
when it abstains?

Does it just dismiss their action and tell

the plaintiff to go get service in Florida?
MR, HAGAN:

Your Honor, if a state has a certifica­

tion statute—and today 12 states do, and there has been quite
a trend here in the last number of years—depending upon
whether the statute of the state permits district court
certification or appellate court certification, the parties
fram'i a certified question to the court of that state.

There

is a briefing period of 60 days under" the Florida statute.
The question is presented? the parties brief it? oral
argument is optional; and then the certifying court responds
back and answers that the law of Florida in this situation is
thus and so.

That is reported back to the federal court.

This

raises none of the problems that have plagued the courts over
the number of years since the abstention doctrine was first
enunciated»
First of all, the delay problem is minimized.
do not hear of a situation where you have to proceed in a

You

20

lower court and up through the appellate procedures in a
state.

You go directly to the supreme court of that state

for a final and definitive ruling on the law.
But I would say, Mr. Justice Rehnquisfc, that here
if the Fifth Circuit had had this, 1 am sure it would have
been certified.

The fact that the Second Circuit had it and

did not certify it when presumably it is not that knowledgeable
on Florida law is an even stronger case for certification.
If I might, I would like to briefly discuss the
trend here, which I think is important, Your Honors, because
there has been since i960—since this Court first used the
certification doctrine—there has been a development here
which I know this Court is aware of.

And if in fairness the

Court disagrees with this trend, presumably this would be the
case to discuss it, because since 1960 in the Clay case, when
there was only one state with a certification statute, this
Court followed up with certification suggestions in Aldrich,
in Dresner, in .1963; in 196 4 in his concurrence in the
England case Mr. Justice Douglas, although expressing strong
reservations about the abstention doctrine, strongly endorsed
certification as a possible solution to these problems.
Q

You say there-are now what, 11 states?

MR. HAGAN:

Now we have 12, Your Honor.

We had 10

in out main brief, and we actually picked up two more in our
reply briefj Minnesota and Oklahoma adopted it at the 573

21
sessions»

And wa cited those ip. our reply brief»
Q

Are they all rather similar statutes?

MR. HAGAN:

Basically, yes, because in 1965 you had

four states adopt, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, and Washington.
There was some difference among them.

But in '67 a uniform act

was adopted by the commissioners of state law.

This was

basically the Florida statute, with some minor variations.
Q

Except that it expands to the district court.

MR. HAGAN:

It goes to the district court also,

permits district court certification.

It was approved by the

ABA in ’67. by the ALT., American Law Institute, in ' 69; and
since that time you have had a number of other states, so that
you now have 12 states that have adopted this doctrine»
So, we submit, this was a proper case for certifi­
cation.

It should have been certified.

.And failure to do so

when requested by Judge Kaufman was error sufficient to just:fy
reversal and remand.
Q

Is there anything in any of these statutes

which permit, where there are federal questions in the case,
a reservation of the federal questions as we held in England,
a litigant in an abstention case might be—
MR. HAGAN

%

Yes.

They do not really extend to that

problem that we had in England, the danger of deciding : the
federal question in the res judicata problem that arises.

They

are limited to the question of state law and where the question

22

linafcive of the issue, not just—
Q

And the Uniform Act is so limiting.

MR. HAGAN:

Yes, that is right, Your Honor»

MR» CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr, Ruby.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD N. RUBY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. RUBY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleas© the

Court:
As the petitioner has acknowledged this morning,
the only question before this Court is whether the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit committed reversible error in
this action, which is based upon diversity of jurisdiction.
In. deciding the question of Florida common law, rather than
certifying it to the Florida Supreme Court, pursuant to
Florida's optional certification procedure.
This Court denied petitioner's request that it
review the merits of this decision or whether the court below
violated the principles of Erie v. Tompkins in reaching its
decision.
Petitioners, I suggest, no doubt recognizing the
weakness of their position on the question which is before this
Court, had nevertheless argued the merits of this decision at
groat length in their brief and also this morning.

Since the

merits itself of the decision are not before the Court, I shall
net address myself to them this morning.

But I would say only

23
in passing that an examination of the decision below I think
clearly reveals that the

Court of Appeals for the Second

Circuit was quite mindful of its obligations under Erie to
decide this case under Florida law and that the Court's decision
is well supported by authorities, including Florida case law5
and 1 might add they cited a decision of the Florida Supreme
Court in support of their decision.
Petitioner referred to four cases in his oral
argument which he alleges the Court of Appeals disregarded or
over looked.

1 might say only in commenting upon that that

only one of these cases was even cited by the petitioners to
the Court of Appeals.

Three of them have been referred to in

their brief to this Court but were not even included in their
brief to the Court of Appeals.
Q

May I ask, Mr. Ruby, the way the Florida rule

reads, there has to ba an initial determination (a) whether
Florida law would be determinative and (b) that there are no
clear controlling precedents in the decisions of the Supreme
Court of Florida.

I take it that initial determination has to

be made by the dertifying court, does it?
MR. RUBY;
Q

Yes, Mr, Justice Brennan.

You are not suggesting that an fact the majority

below did even make that inquiry,did they?
MR. RUBY;

I would not say that the Court of Appeals

believed that the question was settled.

I am not suggesting

24
that.
Q

My question was rather whether the majority

in the Court of Appeals even addressed themselves to the two
questions whether Florida law would be determinative—I guess
they did say that—but about the other, that there are no
clear controlling precedents under the decisions of the Supreme :
Court of Florida.

Did they address themselves to that?

MR. RUBY;

1 think there is a threshold question,

if I may answer your question in this fashion.

1 think the

fesic question is, Is this an appropriate case for certification?
In that Judge Kaufman, in his dissent, did make a passing
reference to the possibility of certification, I would assume
that the court in their deliberations probably considered the
whole question, and they may have corns to the conclusion—and
I believe it is well supported—this was not an appropriate
case for certification.
And I might also say, since I think you have really
brought this point up, petitioner refers to the fact that tha
Florida legislature has enacted this certification statute,
and suggest to this Court that that is a reason for having a
federal court in effect abstain through certification in a
diversity case.
i

First of all, the Florida statute, of course, is
optional in tha sense that it leaves it up to the federal
court to decide what to do.

But I think the more important

25
a&s.i-.v.r is that the Florida legislature cannot, by enacting the
statute, take away the rights which are given to litigants
under the diversity of

jurisdiction statute to go into a

federal court and to have their claims adjudicated there.

And

whether firry have that right and whether the Court erred in
this case I think must be determined under federal law, which I
will coma to.
Q

Mr. Ruby, before you get to that, once Judge

Kaufman raised this certified question point, is if not
significant that the other two members of the panel did not
say anything?
MR. RUBYs

You Honor, I cannot of course search into

the minds of the other two judges, but X would assume from the
fact that—**

Yes, that is true, Your Honor.

So, they did not make a ruling on this at all,

did they?
MR. RUBY:

I would. sa,y that in effect

Q

But they did not say that w® find that this is

not the proper case to be certified.
MR. RUBY:

They never said that.

They did not say it in those words,

Mr. Justice Marshall, but X would say the clear inference from

26
the fact that they did go ahead and decide the case on the
merits is that they determined that this was not an appropriate
case for certification.
Q

But they did not give any reasons for it.

MR. ROBY2

They did not

express any reasons? that

is correct.
The basic rule, turning to the federal law, governing
the (

ligation of federal courts to decide questions of staff-

law in actions based upon diversity jurisdiction was of course
set forth by this Court in the Meredith case, which is
generally regarded as- a landmark decision covering the
obligation of federal courts to decide questions of state law
in diversity cases.
This Court said, and 1 will quote briefly, !3It ha-;
£ rout the first been denned to be the duty of the federal courts *
if their jurisdiction is properly invoked, to decide questions
of state law whenever necessary to the rendition of a judgment.
This Court then went on to say that

in the absence

of exceptional circumstances a failure to decide such
questions of state law—and again I quote—"merely because the
answers to the questions of state law are difficult or have not
yet been givea by the highest court of the state would thwart
the purposes of the jurisdictional act.”
The principles that have been set forth by Meredith
have been reaffirmed by this Court on several occasions,

in

diilb oulty of an issue of state law to deter a federal court
in deciding the issue of state law in a diversity case would

no reason for referral of the problem to the state court.”
Q

What reason, do you think, could be imagined

to do it?
MR. RUBY:
Q

l am sorry, Your Honor?

What reason cars you imagine would be necessary

to have the question certified?

Are you not arguing that you

do not certify any?
MR. RUBY:
0

Wo, Your Honor.

You are not arguing that, are you?

MR. RUBY:

Ho, Your Honor.

But it is our position

that certification is a form of abstention.

In effect, by

certifying the question, the federal court abdicates- its
responsibility to decide the question of state law in a
diversity case, and it submits the issue to the state court.
Q

So, you do not do it on a diversity case?

HR. RUBY:

You do it, Your Honor, in a case, we

submit, would be a proper case for abstention, since it is in
effect a form of abstention.

Now, it may be preferable to

28

outright di; mitral as a form of abstention.

But X think the

question remains whether it is proper for the federal court at
all to abstain from deciding the case in a diversity case
and to submit the issue to a state court.
Q
it not?

It is a form only of qualified abstention

,

is

When you certify, it retains jurisdiction.
MR, foti'BTs

X think th.fc nevertheless it is abstention in the sense that
if the duty of the federal courts under the jurisdictional
act is to decide all questions necessary to the adjudication
of the judgment in a diversity Case—
Q

1 have difficulty seeing why there is any incom­

patibility with the idea of asking the highest court of

the

state to declare what the law is so that the federal court
can be aided in the exercise of its diversity jurisdiction.
Mr. RUBY;

X think there is no incompatibility,,

Your Honor,, if it is a proper case for a federal court to say
to the litigants we will not decide your issue.
we have

X think if

to choose between, for example, outright dismissal

and certification, there is no question that the certification
statute may serve a useful purpose.

And, of course, many

commentators have indicated that in such circumstances it does
serve a useful purpose.

But I would

respectfully submit to

this Court that the issue in this case is not in effect the
general proposition where the

certification may serve a useful

functionQ

Mr» Ruby, 1 gather had there been a decision of

the Supremo Court of Florida, a white horse case with your
own, since this whole case depends on Florida law, were that
true, the Second Circuit and the district court would not
necessarily have had to apply that Florida case, would it not?
MR, RUBY?

There is no question about tnat, Your

Honor o
Q

So, really what is involved here then is there
ease, I gather.

MR. RUBY:
Cf

Right.

There is no case directly.
Or at least it is debatable whether

there is anything that even points to the Florida answer.

And

here is a way that you can get, because there is not presently
one, a decision of the Florida Supreme Court on what the
Florida law is, and that certainly is more definitive than
anything either thin Court or the Second Circuit or the
district court can provide.
MR. RUBY?,

I think that is true, Your Honor, but 1

think you do so and what you give up, 1 think, is really what
has fco be considered.
0

I do not see what you are giving up here.

MR. RUBY:

What you give up, I think, first of all—

and perhaps it is more than just giving up something-—1 think
it does represent a disregard of what the duty is on the

30

federal courts under the diversity of citizenship act.

I

believe that imposed upon the federal courts—
Q

I suggest, Mr. Ruby, rather than not doing

their job, they are doing it more effectively if they take
advantage of this opportunity.
MR. RUBY:

First of all, of course, they are not

deciding the case themselves.
0

I will not belabor this point—

But they have to decide it as it would be decided

under Florida law.
MR. RUBY %

That is correct.

And that being so, and there not presently being

any decisions of the Florida Supreme Court that provide the
answer—and here you have an opportunity to gat the decision
that is applicable to your very case.
MR. RUBY:

That is true. Your Honor, but I think

this Court has considered this kind of situation in other
cases.

If I might for example, perhaps in responding to you,

refer to what this Court said in the Propper v. Clark case, in
that case I think this Court clearly indicated that a federal
court should not submit questions of state law to a state
court where the federal courts have been granted jurisdiction
of the controversy in the absence of special circumstances.

"The submission of special

issues"—in effect here we are talking about a special

Those were all classic

Q

Hr. Ruby, what happens if the Supreme Court of

Florida this morning renders an opinion in another case on all
fours with this one?
MR. RUBYs

Your Honor, I suppose an application

could be made to the Court of Appeals in that unlikely event.
And 1 recognize that there are instances which occur where a
federal court may decide a case and then subsequently a ssjjate
court may decide it differently.

That is a problem that in

involved not only in the diversity area? it is involved in
every case where you have a conflicts of .law rule, where one
state has to decide what another state would do.
Mr. Justice Marshall, I might add that if this case
had been brought, for example, in the state courts of New York,
which it might have, the New York State courts would have had
the obligation under their conflicts of law rule to decide what
Florida law was and then to apply it.
Of course, there is always the danger that their
decision could be wrong.
Q

1 am just talking about this case.

You are

And this opinion comes down and a

week later the Florida court has an identical case on all fours
and in its opinion says, "The Second Circuit is completely

32
wrong in its interpretation off Florida law."

Does that do

anything for good judicial precedent?
MR. RUBYs

Certainly not,*. Your Honor.

Certainly

not.
Q

And is not that what this is for# is

sure that does not. happen?

to make

It could not happen,could it?

If the question had been certified, it could not happen.
HR. RUBYs

It could not happen if the question was

certified, but, Your Honor, if the question was certified,
not only would you have what I have referred to as in effect a
denial of the rights under diversity jurisdiction, but you would
have what this Court I think has talked about time and time
again, the desire not to compsi litigants to go down, if I
may borrow the phrase from Mr. Justice Douglas, a long and
expensive road to obtain an adjudication in a case that they
have brought.
Q

Where we have invoked this Florida procedure in

Clay and in Aldrich and in Dresner, we did not have any
federal questions-’-or did we in those cases?
MR. RUBYs

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.

Clay was a

classic abstention case.
Q

So, we had a federal constitutional question

we would, have had to decide?
MR, RUBY;
Q

Precisely, precisely.

Was that true in the other two, Aldrich and

33

MR. RUBY:
diversity cases.

Neither Aldrich nor Dresner were even

And in both of those cases you had a problem

in one case about due process under the federal Constitution
which could fca avoided.

And in the other case you had an

interpretation of the full faith
Q

and credit clause.

That was a divorce case, was it not?

MR, RUBY:

Yes, that is correct.

So that both of

those cases really do not support the proposition in this case
because they involve the classic type of abstention.
If I might just continue mv answer to Mr, Justice
Marshall, 1 believe that one of the real problems in any kind
of abstention, including certification, is the delay and the
extra burdens, the added expense.
those burdens.

Certification may lesson

But it certainly does not eliminate them.

It

has been reported that certification to the State of Florida
increases the length of a case maybe by at least a year.

It

in effect produces two full dress appeals where one had taken
place before.
And I might say that this particular case is really
an inappropriate case to permit this kind of certification,
since the delay involved here is even more pronounced because o
the fact that the petitioners here did not even request
certification—
Q

Does the Supreme Court of Florida near oral

argument?
MR, RUBY;

Yesf they do- Mr, Justice Rehnquist.

They have c. full dress appeal.
Q

So, the parties would then go down to

Tallahasee and argue their case?
MR. RUBYs

That is correct.

I'm this case, the petitioners in effect allowed
the parties and the court to go through the whole appeal
before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

They

allowed the court to deliberate,, to reach its decisionand
then finally, seising really upon what Mr. Justice Kaufman
had added in his opinion—-because his main part of his opinio*
is he r issanted on the merits.

However, he added at the end

that perhaps, certification should have been used.

Seizing

upon that, the petitioners then made a motion for rehearing.
And 1 think it is interesting to note that even in their
petition for rehearing they did not come out in a forthright
way and say this case should be certified.
rehearing en banc

They asked for a

on the merits, in effect asking the

Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit again to decide the
case on the merits,

and then in the final paragraph of their

12~p-ige petition for rehearing, in effect what they said is,
"If you art not going to decide in our favor, then please see
the case down to the State of Florida.”
1 might say perhaps in support of some of the points

35
X have said before, that commentators have said ir. many
instances—I will refer to Professor Wright as an example of
this—-that certification, and I quote, "is an undesirable
innovation if it will lead to an abrogation of the
doctrine."

Meredith

And similar expressions are found in other

commentaries.
The threshold question that I would submit to this
Court is whether this was basically a case for abstention of
any kind.

And 1 think if you look at the nature of the ease

and the instances in which this Court has granted abstention,
X think it is clear it is not.
There is no constitutional question that can be
avoided in this case,
involved.

There is no constitutional question,

There is no state regulatory scheme involved; and

try as they may, the petitioners attempt to create some kind
of regulatory scheme.

And yet the issue in this case

essentially involves the breach of a fiduciary duty, alleged
breach of a fiduciary duty.

I suppose if certification were

appropriate or abstention were appropriate in this case, one
might say then in virtually in any case where one alleges a
breach of a fiduciary duty, if there is an unsettled issue of
law, that that is a proper case for certification,
Q

But you still agree that Florida law controls?

MR. RUBYs
Mr. Justice Marshall.

Thar© is no question about that,
Under the Erie case I think the Court

36
of Appeals clearly recognised that, and it did its duty, I
would submit, enrur Erie as required by Congress under the
Diversity cf Jurisdiction Act to decide the case unless there t-;
special circumstances which this Court has said warranted
abstention.
No one in this case was asking a federal court to in
effect enjoin state officials from carrying out their act.
There is no peculiar local issue involved here such as eminent
domain that was involved in Thibodaux.

There was'no issue

here, as there was in the Kaiser case involving the control of
vital natural resources.
Q

The inquiry under Erie is actually—for the

court sitting in the Southern District of New York--is, What
conflicts of law would the New York Court of Appeals apply in
this case?

Is it not?
MR, RUBY:
Q

That is correct.

And thea.you would look to that new York lacy

end if that New York low in turn refers you to Florida law,
than the district court goes to Florida law.
MR. ROBY:

That is correct, Mr. 'Justice

The main issue in this case is not even the
propriety of the petitioners3 conduct.

Even the petitioners

have conceded here that the act that was committed—that is,
trading with inside information—has been subject to univsrs.: 1
condemnation.

So that we are not even talking, as we are in

37
Host abstention

cases, with whether certain conduct within

e state is proper or not.

What we are talking about in this

case is whether or not Lina’s should have a remedy to recover
recover the profits which were made by these defendants as a
result of their alleged trading with the use of confidential
corporate information.
We would submit only to the Court on this point that
it cannot be seriously urged that it is the public policy of
Florida that persons should be permitted to engage in trading
with confidential corporate information in the stock of
Florida corporations and

that the decision in this case would

interfere with that public policy.
Therefore, we would submit that this case does not
present the classic conflicts where special circumstances which
would have warranted abstention.
I would say recognising really that this is not a
proper abstention case, the main thrust of the petitioners’
argument is that any case which involves an unsettled issue
of law, of state law, is a case which is a proper case for
certification.

And they go even further.

They say if the

court dees not certify,, even if it was never even requested
to do so, that it has committed error.
I think'this Court has made it clear that—-and if I
may borrow a phrase from Mr. Justice Brennan—there is a very
narrow corridor through which a federal court may escape from

38
its obligation to decide state law questions when federal
jurisdiction is properly invoked. We would respectfully submit
that to accept the petitioners' contention that where there is
an unsettled issue of state law—-and I might say parenthetically
in a majority of cases it might be reasonably contended that
the state law issue is not settled—that this would be to open
the door wide and really to turn this narrow corridor, which
the Court has vary carefully limited into what I think might be
described as really a wide canyon.

And I think these are the

clear implications of the petitioners8 argument.
There is no support that the petitioners can gain,
as I have indicated, from either the Clay case or Dresner.
Aldrich, since in those cases you are dealing with classic
abstention cases.

In fact, Aldrich and Dresner were not even

diversity cases.
In Clay I think it is also appropriate to note—and
1 have referred to this, the remarks by Mr. Justice Douglas,

where he gave protest to the practice of making litigants travel
a long and expensive road in order to obtain justice.

And I

might add that the case has already been pending three years.
Certification will now require the parties to perhaps spend
another year on an appellate level by going down to Florida.
If certification is appropriate here, it may well be appropriate
after trial, assuming that the plaintiffs prevail on the
allegations of the complaint.

The proof in this case may be

39
different than the allegations of the complaint, and the issue
may arise haw
law.

the plaintiffs prove the ease under Florida

And again the argument ecuId be made that that is an

issue which should be certified,

and the case may go on for

many more years, with the consequent burdens to the parties
as a result of that.

MR. RUBY: .I believe that it is still pending.
Your Honor»

I do not know its precise status, I know they are

still pending and being litigated.
As i have indicated before, I would like to just
turn for a moment to the equities of this case.

I think this

is a particularly inappropriate case, I would submit to the
Court, to find that the court below erred in not certifying
'where the petitioners never even requested certification before
an adverse decision on the merits.
This Court has said I think time and time again that
such a procedure is to be criticized and certainly should not
be sanctioned

where one goes into court, submits his rights

to court, gets an adverse decision, and -then wants to go to
another court to litigate the same issues.
In the Kostetfcer case, in holding that it was not
error in not abstaining, this Court referred to the fact that
neither party had requested it.
In the England case, in somewhat different
circumstances, this Court indicated that where a party like th;
petitioners freely litigates his claims in one court, even
though ha may not be required to do so, he should not be allowed

41
to ignore the adverse decision and then start all over in
another court.

And that is precisely what the petitioners

are seeking to do here. As Mr. Justice Relinquist aptly noted,
we would not be hare today seeking certification, if the
petitioners had prevailed in the Court of Appeals.
This Court in England said that such a procedure,
the kind that the petitioners are seeking to follow now, would
countenance an unnecessary increase in the length and cost of
litigation.
! nd there are many other cases along those lines.
Those cases involving disqualification of a judge at court
indicate that the litigant cannot experiment with the Court to
see what happens, and this is precisely what the petitioners
have done hare.

They were quite willing to let the Court of

Appouls decide tha case.

But then when it was decided against

them after they, so to speak, tested the water, found it not
to their liking; then they urged that the court should not have
decided the case to begin with.
Mr. Hagan this morning in his reply brief I think
made remarkable statement in response to Mr. Rehnquist's
question.

He said that there was no occasion for certification

until after the decision below, since the law of Florida was
not debatable or uncertain.
I might say in passing if the law was not uncertain,
then you would not even have a proper case for certification-.

42
But the implication of what the petitioners are
saying is that you do not even determine whether certification
is appropriate by considering the nature of the case or the
issues before decision.

What you do is that after the

decision you look at the decision and if you think it is wrong,
then you argue that certification should have taken place.
I would suggest respectfully to the court that
this procedure has nothing to commend it and certainly

should

not be sanctioned by this Court in this case.
One further point on the procedure.

The petitioners

attempt in their reply brief to overcome the obvious inequity
of the procedure they followed by making reference to the
decision in the Kaiser case where, after an adverse decision,
the petitioner made a motion asking the court of appeals to
abstain, ponding a determination in a pending declaratory
judgment action in the state.

The Tenth Circuit denied that

motion, with Judge Brown, who was sitting by designation from
the Fifth Circuit, dissenting.
This Court of course then went on to reverse and
order abstention.
The Kaiser case, however, certainly is a different
kind of case and does not sanction the kind of procedure that
the petitioners have followed here.

of New Mexico had come in and ask
Where you have this classic

abstention case, then the fact that a litigant did not ask for
certification

perhaps is not determinative, because there

you are dealing with great public stakes.
I will close just by referring to what Judge Brown
said in his dissent in the Tenth Circuit.

He said, "If we

were not dealing with serious matters of great public moment
and importance to New Mexico, 1 would he quite willing to say
to Kaiser that it must live with the consequences of a federal
court diversity jurisdiction."
Finally he went on to say, "Similarly the fact that
the motion is now made after the adverse decision of this
Court, while a powerful circumstance in many situations, does not
prevent the exercise of abstention now in view of these great
public stakes."
And X

would only urge this court that here where

we are not dealing with those great public stakes or considera­
tions that are present in abstentionf that the failure to
request certification before an adverse decision should either
constitue a waiver or bar to argue that the court erred in not
doing so or, at the very least, should represent, in Judge
Brown's words, powerful circumstance in determining whether
the court of appeals, assuming that it had any discretion to

44
certify, abtas«:

Thank you.

Mr. Ruby, had the petioners her© suggested

it be certified, what is your guess as to the reaction of the
panel?
MR. RUBY:
they would do.

Mr. Justice Blackmun, I cannot say what

I would say what 1 think

they should do.

I

would think because this case does not involve those considera­
tions which justify a federal court abstaining from deciding
the question itself, I would say it should not have certified
in this case.

Because in ray judgment this court has indicated

that a federal court is under a duty which is placed upon it
by Congress in the Jurisdictional Act to decide questions of
state law except in those very narrow circumstances.
would respectfully submit that an examination

this case would reveal that those circumstances are not

Appeals would come to that conclusion,

And 1 would assume,

Your Honor, that since Judge Kaufman at least alluded to it,
that there was some discussion among the judges, and this may
well have been a consideration which influenced the court to
decide the case, as well as I have indicated the failure of the
petitioners to request it.

45
Q

Do you fa'el that the failure of the majority

ever* to mention it in their written opinion is not necessarily
indicative of the fact that they felt the case had gone too
far for certification?
HR. RUBY;

I certainly do not, Your Honor. I think

the fact that Judge Kaufman at least did mention it would
suggest that the court did give consideration to it and decided
on various grounds that it should decide

the case and not

certify„
If there are no other questions, thank you very
much,
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

Mr. Hagan, you have about

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES J. HAGAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HAGAN:

Your Honors, I believe that Mr. Ruby

has overstated the position of the petitioners hare and over­
stated the argument.

We do not argue here for abstention.

His entire argument and rebuttal and response is based on an
abstention argument on behalf of the petitioners.

Of course

this does not take away the right of any party to go into
federal court.
The argument in favor of certifacation it that it
preserves that right, that federal fact finding is available,
federal rules of discovery are available.

The only -issue that

They argue merit.
hero.

They are setting up a straw man

We do not claim abstention.

There is no need for it.

That is in effect the beauty of the new certification statutes.
These arguments that have plagued the courts and the
commentators for £0 or 30 years may in the future start to
alleviate because abstention in this area may not be necessary
any more.
Mr. Justice Marshall has well pointed out that
their basic position is that certification is not. justified
in any case, because obviously you always have delay.

The

delay involved may be several months, if may be six months or
more-«

But I would say that the answer to this delay

argument, which is always brought up by the party opposing
either abstention or' certification was well answered by this
Court back ,n 1942 in Field ere st D alries, where Mr. Justice
Douglas said, "Considerations of delay, inconvenience, and
cost to the parties,which have been urged upon us, do not call
tor a different result."

They were there granting abstention.

So, we are here concerned with a much larger issue
as ho the appropriate relationship between federal and state

authorities functioning as a harmonious whole.
exactly before the Court today.

That issue is

The problems that have been

raised by abstention over the years have now started to result
in the statutory certification process.

And I submit the

Court should now encourage it.
And finally this point that who gets certification,
whether you grant certification, should almost be a form of
gamesmanship as to who asks first or who doss not ask for it.
It is simply inappropriate.

When wa were before the Second

Circuit, we parties to a litigation where our view was that
Florida lav? did not support the claim and the district court
had so found and respondents here were unable to cite a single
Florida case supporting their position.

It was not our position

before the Second Circuit that Florida law was so uncertain as
to require certification,

It became that way when the majority

here developed the doctrine it did.

Only then did the question

of certification come to the forefront.

Prior to that time,

our position was not that the law of Florida was unsettled or
uncertain.
With all of the problems Mr, Ruby points out about
classical abstention, certainly the court that has had the most
experience with certification in a federal context has not found
it to be a burden and has found it in fact to be a greet
benefit.
As recently as 1963 the Fifth Circuit in Martinez

v„ Rodriguez said the following:

"We would be remiss if we

did not once again seise the opportunity to extol the virtues
of the Florida certification procedure.

For example, while

this court, following the footsteps of the stalwarts below
might have reached the same conclusion as that of the Florida
court with respect to the issue in this case, our decision
would have had no assurance of predictable correctness.

No

matter how many federal judges, trial, appellate, three-judge
panel, or the full panoply of the court en banc, any decision
would have been an eerie guess.

Now the guesswork has been

eliminated and we are quickly presented with a definitive
explication of Florida law.”
That is the view of the Fifth Circuit, not just
these petitioners, and we submit that this Court should reverse
the decision below and direct the Second Circuit also to
certify this question of Florida law to the Supreme Court of
Florida.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:36 o'clock a.m., the case
was submitted.3
