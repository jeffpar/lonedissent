And it adjourned its first session sine

H.R. 4042 was met

with Presidential inaction.

4

The President neither signed it nor returned it to

5

Congress with his objections.

6

This suit was brought by the Congressional

7

respondents to obtain a declaratory judgment that by

8

operation of Article I, Section 7, Clause 2, H.R. 4042

9

became a law just as if the President had signed it.

10

Now, it’s important to recognize at the very

11

outset that H.R. 4042 would have expired by its own

12

terms on September 30th,

13

judgment of the Court of Appeals was entered in this

14

case, and more than six months before their opinions

15

were filed.

The question of mootness ties in to the

17

question of whether the Congressional respondents have

18

standing on any theory to maintain this suit for

19

declaratory relief.

20

I should point out, however, that we have no

21

doubt of the power of the courts to decide the meaning

22

of the Pocket Veto Clause in a real case or

23

controversy.

24

could sue to enforce those rights, and in the process,

4042 is or is not a law.

2

Such were the claims of the plaintiff Indian

3

tribes in The Pocket Veto Case, or the individual

claimant in Wright v. United States.

Here, however, we have a completely different

basis for standing asserted by the Congressional

respondents.

Now there are two different ways that this

The

Now it*s certainly clear that that theory of

21

standing is completely moot, because K.R. 4042 has

expired, and the law governing military aid to El

what

about the argument they make about some auditing

consequences about whether compliance with the bill

3

would have had fiscal consequences?

4

MR. WILLARD;

Justice Stevens, it's our view

5

that these collateral consequences, or asserted

6

collateral consequences, do not involve the parties

7

before the Court in this case, and thus, do not provide

8

a basis for avoiding mootness;

9

involve the Secretary of State, allegedly, or the

And there’s no indication that the

I think there is an aspect in which they

But setting aside the mootness issue, even if

10

H.R. 4042 did not have a sunset provision and were still

11

ongoing, their broad theory of standing, that Members of

12

Congress can sue because laws are not being executed and

13

thus, their votes are being nullified, is one which

14

would be quite novel for this Court to recognize, and,

15

we think, inconsistent with the Courts teaching in

16

Chadha and Synar.

17

interest in the lawmaking process that ends once laws

18

are made, and that they do not have an ongoing power to

QUESTION:

I take it that Congress

11

couldn’t ever insist that their public laws be -- that

That's cur

That’s the narrower theory.

HR. WILLARD;

Presumably if Congress wanted to

hire its own printer, that would be another matter.
QUESTION:

Well, what about a joint resolution

by Congress saying, we want to sue?
MR. WILLARD:

It's our position that would not

be effective in creating standing.

QUESTION;

So it just isn’t an individual

Congressman or a Senator or one House.

3

Congress itself, by a joint resolution, couldn't

authorize a suit?
MB. WILLARD:

5

It's just that

In this kind of a situation,

6

over execution of the laws.

7

printing of the laws is of course the narrower theory of

8

standing that the respondents seem to be relying on

9

mostly here.

10

Now, the business about

It ’s our position that whether or not a law is

11

printed has nothing to do with whether or not it*s a

12

law.

13

Wright case, the Court did not treat publication as

14

dispositive.

In, for example, The Pocket Veto Case, and in the

QUESTION;

15

That may be so.

That may be so.

16

Eut the question is whether they have standing to insist

17

that public laws be printed.
MR. WILLARD;

18

I understand, Justice White.

19

But that’s not the same as standing -- that’s not a

nullification of their vote on H.R.

That’s a — it’s a separate

3

QUESTION;

—

So we just leave these cases to

political settlement?

4

MR. WILLARD;

No,

Justice White, not at all.

5

If a party has a legal right, if a party’s adversely

6

affected one way or another by a bill that is asserted

7

to have become a law, they can sue as in The Pocket Veto

8

Case and get a judicial determination.

about it?

Yes, but Congress can’t do anything

MR. WILLARD;

They did not hold

that there would have been a sufficient injury in fact

— as to whether it's correct or

not in this case.
But I think that whether or not Coleman is

11

correct, that it’s also distinguishable by the

12

difference between the Federal relationship and the

13

Federal-State relationship.

14

In

Gillock, for example ,- this Court said that

I think that the separation of powers

not necessarily apply in the same way when you have a

You know, we’re always accused of that.

asking us to do just that?

3

MR. WILLARD;

And aren’t you

No, Justice Marshall, actually

4

what we're asking you to do is tc simply vacate the

5

Court of Appeals’ decision as moot, or to find that

6

there is no standing here, and not tc reach the merits

7

of this case.

8

10

QUESTION;

You don’t want us to reach the

merits ?
MR. WILLARD;

No,

we don’t, Justice Marshall.

11

In an abstract sense, of course, it's an important issue

12

on the merits that we would

like to see resolved.

13

But we think it has to await resolution in a

14

traditional case or controversy, and that just because

15

Congress and the President are ready, willing and able,

16

as we are today, to debate the merits of the issue —

MR. WILLARD;

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. WILLARD;

(Inaudible.)
We do believe it is moot.

And that’s all you want decided?

sufficient to dispose of the case.

think there’s no standing, and that would be sufficient

23

to dispose of it.

the publication statutes, if they are not being carried

2

out faithfully by the executive, involves the same kind

3

of question of nonexecution of the law as H.R. 4042

4

generally .

5

And that is that if in fact the Presid ent is

6

not complying with the bill publication statutes, a suit

7

to compel him to publish a bill would be like a suit to

If I could turn briefly, though, to the merits

21

in the event the Court reaches those merits, of our

interpretation of the Pocket Veto Clause, the

respondents repeatedly accuse us of advocating a

formalistic interpretation of the Pocket Veto Clause.

Case, pocket vetoes are not the President’s fault, but

2

instead, are attributable solely to the action of

3

Congress in adjourning before the time allowed the

4

President for returning the bill.

5

Now, much has been made of the fact that many

6

bills are in fact presented to the President shortly

7

before an adjournment in the modern practice of

8

Congress, and that therefore, allowing the President's

9

pocket veto power to be exercised would give — would

10

allow a lot of these bills tc be absolutely vetoed.

11

But that’s really a static-state analysis.

12

That’s assuming that Congress would handle its

13

adjournment and bill presentment practices exactly the

14

same without regard to how the Pocket Veto Clause is

15

construed.

16

Congress has the power, under existing

practices, to control the presentment of bills, and to

control adjournments, so if it doesn't want

If

should not be that much of a problem .

2

The main — the position of the respondents

3

about how the pocket veto should operate is, that the

4

President should be required , when Congress has

5

adjourned between or within sessions, to return a bill

6

with his objections to an agent who will hold the

President’s message, and then present it to the

8

originating House of Congress when it returns and

reconv enes.

10

We have no doubt that this kind of a rule

11

could work, or that it would not drastically alter the

12

balance of power in the government.

MR. FRANKEL;

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
When the Court last examined the

14

Constitution's veto provision, in the Wright case, it

said that those provisions should be interpreted to

further two equal purposes;

President to accomplish the veto.

Mr. Frankel, can I just give you

Your opponent suggests that you have the

5

solution to this problem within your own hands.

Couldn’t you do something like what this Court did a few

The only thing stopping a bill from becoming a

And then the

The plain words of the clause show that this

The fact that Congress was in an adjournment

not one that prevents return of the bill.

This textual reading of the clause is

confirmed by

21

returning them to Congress.

an examination of the purpose of the pocket
The pocket veto

The framers determined that the President

23

would have the power to return unacceptable bills, but

24

that Congress must have the power to override the

President's objections if two-thirds of its Members were

not persuaded by them.

2

The pocket veto was adopted solely to

3

guarantee adherence to this distribution of the

4

lawmaking power, by ensuring that Congress could not

5

provide the President of the opportunity to exercise a

6

veto.

7

If Congress were to adjourn out from under the

8

President, depriving him of the chance of vetoing, he

9

could simply pocket the bill .

10

Thus the pocket veto was intended as a

11

defensive mechanism solely to guarantee that the

12

President would retain the ability to effect the veto.

13

The attempt to pocket veto this bill during an

14

interim adjournment of the Congress failed to respect

15

the purpose of the provision and the plan of the

16

framers.

17

During this adjournment, each House had

18

assigned to an officer the duty to accept veto messages

19

from the President.

20

precisely to assure that by adjourning Congress would

21

not prevent the President from returning a till.

22

The purpose of doing that was

Thus, the decision to pocket this bill was a

23

decision to use a pocket veto in lieu of a

24

constitutionally available alternative of a return veto.

This understanding is consistent with the

21

But the executive ignores that several years

As Judge McGowan* wrote for the Court, there

The executive maintains that this adjournment

12

President Reagan has returned mere than

one-third of his bills in precisely that fashion.

14

The executive's argument would require the

finding that the Constitution in fact required that all
