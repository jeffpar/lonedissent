Any kind of

It is our position that the

^

5

alien's options are to appeal to the Board of

Immigration Appeals and then to the Court of Appeals or

failing that, that they can apply to the attorney

general for permission to reenter the United States

following a deportation*
QUESTIONS

10

But you wouldn't think that even a

11

so-called gross miscarriage of Justice in the course of

12

a 1326 proceeding could be raised?
MR* WRIGHTS

13

That's correct*

It is our

14

position that it can't be raised there, that the correct

15

approach is to raise it on appeal or to apply for

16

permission to reenter*

17

How about if the right to appeal

was not known by the person deported and therefore the

waiver of the appeal was invalid?

may stili not take the self-help remedy of re-entry*

Self-help —

Oo you take the position that there

are absolutely no due process limitations to the

enforcement of Section 1326?

10

MR* WRIGHT*

11

QUESTIONS

That's correct.
Mr* Wright* there Is certainly some

12

authority that at least when you are talking about a

13

District Court Judge* which I take it Is every bit as

14

sacrosanct as an immigration officer judgment* that If

15

you would find actual bias on the part of the judge*

16

that could be set aside after the judgment has become

17

final*

18

what you are talking about?

Would you include these within the rubric of

MR* WRIGHT*

19

We don't think these should be

20

raised in 1326*

we would think would be good reason for a Court of

that a new proceeding be held*
