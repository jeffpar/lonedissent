that law other than the law of the source state has In

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUISTS
Reardon.

Thank you, Mr.

Me will hear next from you, Mr. Langrock.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER F. LANGROCK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. LANGROCK.

Mr. Chief Justice, and aay it

please the Court, what we have here Is a private
nuisance action brought by citizens of the state of
Vermont against a New York corporation which was removed
from Vermont courts to the Federal court based on
diversity of Jurisdiction.
Me are seeking compensatory damages for actual
damages done to property owned by ay clients.

Me are

seeking punatlve damages and we are seeking injunctive
relief If under usual theories of equity jurisprudence
injunctive relief is appropriate.

Me are suggesting to

thIs Court that Vermont law in the Vermont courts or the
Vermont Federal court in this case Is appropriate.
In full candor the solicitor's position is
such that they ask for a division in effect of Vermont
law and New York law based upon the compensatory versus
punitive injunctive relief.

Me don't think that will

make any difference In our case.

As far as we know

Vermont taw and New York law are identical on the.
question of private nuisance, in effect that unless this

There are

There Is the Article IV
There are equal

11

unlimited and* of course» Congress can always limit it

12

further» but what is apparent in the Act is that

13

Congress meant to preserve damage remedies» and as this

14

Court held In Silkwood» and the Court was unanimous with

15

respect to compensatory damages that even though there

16

is a comprehensive Federal regulatory scheme» if that

17

the ordinary assumption is that Congress continued to

rely on state law to provide for the damages.

QUESTION.

The state Is not wholly

But the Interstate problem is not

MR. WALLACE:

It is not* which Is the reason

we think the punitive damages situation Is different»

24

because as in Silkwood we think punitive damages were

25

preserved in this scheme» but only in the source state»
45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

and Silkwood did not address the problem of interstate

2

punitive damages which seems to us to come within the

3

Milwaukee I principle of a regulatory measure* and there

4

isn't the same compelling need to recognize the

5

interstate punitive damages because punitive damages are

6

still available if the source state is willing to

7

provide them.

QUESTION.

8
9

It isn't a question of ail or nothing.
Nr. Wallace* may I Just follow up

with one question on this?

As I understand the

10

government's position* the receiving state retains the

11

compensatory damage remedy but it is precluded — this

12

is where you differ with the District Court — it is

13

precluded from the abatement and the punitive damage

14

remedy.

15

MR. WALLACES

16

QUESTION.

Exactly.

And in your view what is the legal

17

source* not the practical argument* of that preclusion?

18

Is It the statute?

19

exist?

20

Is it Milwaukee I?

MR. WALLACE.

Or did it never

It Is ultimately the principle

21

of Milwaukee I because as we read Milwaukee II what

22

Milwaukee II said was that the provisions* and they are

23

elaborated in Milwaukee II much more than we did In our

24

brief* the provisions for the affected states'

25

participation in the process give the affected state
46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

sufficient recourse under the Federal Act that It no

2

longer should have to resort to Federal common law and

3

the need to create Federal common law has been

4

superseded by the ability of the affected state under

5

the Federal Act to influence the standards that are to

6

be applied so l>t no longer has to resort to Federal

7

common law for abatement» but Milwaukee II never said

8

that the Federal Act changed the Inhibitions that

9

Milwaukee I recognized on out-of-state regulation that

10

necessitated resort to a Federal common law in the first

11

place in the abatement context*
QUESTIONS

12

So you are saying that before

13

Milwaukee I was ever decided it would have been

14

perm isslb Ie.for the receiving state to bring an

15

abatement action in a punitive damage claim?
