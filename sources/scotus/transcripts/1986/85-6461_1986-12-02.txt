ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. WILLIS, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WILLIS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
The issue, simply put, in this case is whether

11

Ohio can punish one as a murder when it is just as

12

likely that they acted in self-defense.

13

To more properly isolate the issue, it is

14

important to note that in this case the court instructed

15

the jury that the defendant had the burden of proving

16

that she acted in self-defense by the greater weight of

17

the evidence.

18

The court went on to indicate that the

19

defendant must establish that the other party was the

20

aggressor, and the defendant did not herself provoke or

21

cause the injury.

22

The court then further indicated that if the

23

weight of the evidence is equally balanced, or if you

24

are unable to determine which side has the affirmative

25

defense as to — has the preponderance, then the

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

defendant has not establish

such affirmative defense.

In essence, what the court was telling the

2
3

jury,

that if the evidence was in equipoise on the issue

4

of self-defense, then the defendant had failed to

5

establish her defense.

6

The critical aspect of this was that this was

7

the defendant’s sole defense.

8

law can be understood as indicating that Ohio can, in

9

fact, require a defendant to prove themselves not

10

guilty .

11
12
13

So in effect, the Ohio

I think this offends principles that have been
in —
QUESTION:

That assumes -- that assumes that

14

the self-defense — the defense of self-defense

15

implicates some element of the crime.

16

MR. WILLIS:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. WILLIS:

Yes,

in one aspect it does.

What is it?
Well, certainly self-defense is

19

directed against the element of purposefulness,

20

unlawfulness, in the context of the Ohio statute.

21

QUESTION:

Well, now the State has to prove by

22

a — beyond a reasonable doubt that this murder was

23

purposeful, doesn't it?

24

MR. WILLIS:

25

QUESTION:

Yes,

it has to do that.

And that burden always stays with

1

it?

2

MR. WILLIS;

3

QUESTION;

Absolutely.
And it's like -- it's like a lot of

4

-- the defendant may want to come in and say, I didn't

5

shot them -- shoot this person at all, or I didn't have

6

any purpose to do — but if the State convinces the jury

7

beyond a reasonable doubt that he did have that purpose,

8

what's

left of this self-iefense argument?
All you're saying — all the self-defense

9
10

instruction says is that you — if you succeed in

11

putting in enough evidence that you acted in

12

self-defense, you're excused.

13

MR. WILLIS;

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. WILLIS;

That's exactly what it’s saying.
Yes.
But it's saying that the

16

defendant has to prove, by the same token, that he's not

17

guilty .

18

The point is that

self-defense is different

19

from all other defenses.

20

when he asserts self-defense is that he was engaged in

21

lawful conduct, and that he has a right not to be

22

punished for having done this.

23
24
25

QUESTION;

What the defendant is saying

Well, do

you think the instruction

reduces the State's burden in proving purposefulness?
MR. WILLIS;

It certainly does, in the context
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

where you have a case that has a self-defense

2

component.

3

self-defense is submitted to the jury, it certainly

4

ought to be submitted under proper instructions.

And certainly, when the issue of

5

The critical point, as I understand it --

6

QUESTION;

7

8

the State had to prove purposefulness beyond a
reasonable doubt.
MR. WILLIS:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

14
15

Yes,

it did.

And then you say -- then the

instruction on self-defense lowered that burden?
MR. WILLIS:

12
13

Well, the instructions did say that

It absolutely did.

Because

inherent in that instruction, of course, is the
presumption that what the defendant did was unlawful,
and I can develop that.
Back in 1872, or thereabouts, there was a case

16
17

in Ohio known as Silvers, which referred

18

law cases out of England, the Forest Crown cases and

19

20
21
22
23
24
25

to seme common

King v. Winoncby, and at that point, in the Silvers
case, the defendant requested an instruction that the
jury be told that the defendant -- that the state had to
prove the lack of self-defense beyond a reasonable
doubt.
The court in its -- the Supreme Ccurt of Chic
indicated that that would eliminate the presumption that

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

what the defendant had done was unlawful.
Now, that presumption is the same presumption

2
3

that this Court has declared unconstitutional in such

4

cases as Sandstrom, Franklin v. Francis, and ether

5

cases.
We know that even in England, in

6

1937, the --

7

the House of Lords indicated that that reading of these

8

English cases was wrong; and that those cases, the

9

Forest Crown cases and others, had indicated that the

10

burden was on — the defendant had to prove the lack of

11

provocation.
And given that context, which is referred to

12
13

in Mullaney,

14

indicated, in Sandstrom and

15

presumption is an unconstitutional one.

in Franklin, that the

that presumption.

And it*s interesting --

QUESTIONS

18

Mr. Willis, doesn't that all hinge

19

on -- on the implicit assumption that a State could not

20

make it a crime to kill somebody in self-defense?

21

that the premise of your argument, really?
MR. WILLISs

QUESTIONS

Well, why couldn't a State -- bear

in mind that in order to be convicted, the defendant

He intended to kill, right?
MR. WILLIS:

Deliberate and premeditated

malice .

5

QUESTION:

Right;

so he intended to kill.

6

couldn't a State court -- a State say, you shall not

7

kill in self-defense?

8

-- but you cannot intentionally kill somebody in

9

self-d efense?

10

MR. WILLIS;

Why

You can main, you can, you know

Because self-defense is one of

11

those fundamental or inalienable rights that were part

12

of the rights that the people had when this Union was

13

formed.

14

More specifically, if my recollection is

15

correct, George Mason, who wrote the Declaration -- the

16

Virginia Declaration and the Virginia Constitution,

17

indicated that there were certain rights that the people

18

possessed almost absolutely that could not be traversed.

19

About weeks later, this was engulfed by

20

Madison and written into the Declaration of

21

Independence.

22

preamble to the Constitution, also written by Madison,

23

we have inalienable rights.

This then tells us - and then in the

24

QUESTION:

25

right to act in self-defense.

I'm persuaded that you have the

2

intentionally to kill in self-defense?

3

MR. WILLIS;

Well, I think you have the right

7

MR. WILLIS;

8

QUESTION:

9

Must that be a right that the State

I think -In order to prove the defense of

self-defense, what has to be shown in Ohio?
MR. WILLIS:

10

In Ohio, they would have to show

11

that you didn't precipitate the controversy that gave

12

rise to the need, to the necessity of self-defense.

13

must not have violated any duty to retreat, and you must

14

not have used no more force that was reasonably

15

necessary.
QUESTION;

16
17
18

You

No more than was reasonably

necessary .
MR. WILLIS;

Under the circumstances.

19

Although, you have the right to act on appearances, and

20

even if you're mistaken in those appearances, if in fact

21

you believe that you are confronted with a situation

22

where you might suffer death or grievous bodily harm,

23

then you can act, and the jury would be compelled to

24

acquit under those circumstances.

25

QUESTION;

Mr. Willis, what you're saying, I
9

(202) 628-9300

think, in another way, is that there are limits to what

a State may make a crime.

MR. WILLIS;

Absolutely.

sail that in Spelser v. Randall.

and Patterson.

And I*ti convinced

that there are limits beyond

7

which a State cannot go in defining its crimes and in

8

allocatings its burdens of proof.

9

Indeed, this Court has gone so far as to say

10

that there are certain facts that need not be elements

11

that have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt .

12

statement was recently indicated in McMillian where it

13

interpreted Patterson as having given rise to that

14

position.

15

And that's exactly what I'm saying here.

16

Now, the State of

That

Ohio has indicated that if

17

you prove points — prove fact A, B, C and D, that you

18

have proved unlawful conduct; and

19

raise the issue of self-defense, if you are challenging

20

exclusively unlawfulness, that you are not challenging

21

any of the elements in Patterson.

therefore, when you

Well, let's deal with Patterson.

22

Patterson

23

was a situation where New York created a gratuitous

24

defense.

25

effect of Patterson was that a particular crime was

It was created by legislative grace.

(202) 628-9300

The

1

designated as murder.
However, the defendant was given the right to

2
3

reduce that crime from murder to manlslaughter upon

4

certain proof .
As I read Patterson, what this Court said was

5

6

that it is all right, and due process considerations are

7

not offended, if New York elects to convict one as a

8

murderer when it it just as likely that they were acting

9

— that they only committed manslaughter because they

10

were acting under extreme emotional stress.
This is to be distinguished from what Ohio’s

11
12

done.

13

when it is just as likely that they were acting in

14

self-defense.

15

Ohio has said, you can convict one as a murderer

Now, if self-defense is a basic right, and I

16

contend that it is, then something benefits the

17

defendant, at least to the extent that the State should

18

prove that he was not acting in self-defense.

19

It’s significant that 48 of the 50 States

20

require the state to ultimately carry the burden of

21

persuasion on that issue.

22

Some of the states, Maine and a few others

23

that we can possibly name, have indicated that the

24

defendant has the burden of production, that he has to

25

establish that there is enough evidence in the case to

QUESTION;

2

Well, certainly, that’s not

3

unreasonable, is it?

4

defendant would have that knowledge far better than the

5

State?

6

MB. WILLIS:

Because most of the time the

I accept that proposition.

7

agree with that.

8

the inference in the Court's question.

9
10

I

That's not the issue, but I adopt it,

And we do not question the fact that the
defendant ought to be burdened with that of production.

11

But once the issue is in the case, it just

12

seems clear to me that the State ought to be able --

13

ought to be required, under fundamental criteria, to

14

prove that the defendant was not acting in self-defense.

15

As

I said, 48 of the 50 States require this.

16

Now, the State is talking in terms of the difficulty in

17

doing this.

18

courts, the Government has the burden of proving the

19

lack of self-defense, and I do not quarrel with this.

20

Even the United — even in the Federal

QUESTION;

Well, if you prove beyond a

21

reasonable doubt that it was purposeful, you've gone a

22

long ways to prove that it wasn’t done in self-defense.

23

MR. WILLIS;

Well, it depends on the

24

circumstances under which the killing took place.

25

it’s a life and death struggle between two people, then

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

If

1

obviously, he may very well intend to kill.
But that's the problem with Martin v. Ohio.

2
3

Martin v. Ohio, the opinion in the Supreme Court of

4

Ohio, is to the effect that self-defense is likened to

5

confession and avoidance.
They state that when one claims self-defense,

6
7

he admits the facts as alleged by the prosecutor.
Hell, certainly, one can kill in self-defense

8
9

without intending to kill.

He can shoot to wound in

10

self-defense.

He can shoot to scare in self-defense.

11

It can be a reflex action in self-defense without any

12

particular purpose whatsoever.
Are we to say that mens re has no -- that

13
14

self-defense doesn't impact on mens re?

15

it does.

17

MR. WILLIS:

22

Absolutely.

They have to prove

that there was an intent to kill.
QUESTION:

20
21

Well, I know, but the State -- the

State has to prove the mens re beyond a reasonable doubt.

18
19

That's —
QUESTION:

16

Well, certainly

If there wasn't, they shouldn't be

convicted.
MR. WILLIS:

Because he was acting — he did

so -- she did so, if it please the Court, while she was

acting in self-defense.

under these facts that we --

Well, go ahead

Now, back to my concern about Patterson.
QUESTION;
have it.

Let’s talk about the 48 states that

You say they apparently get along with it.
MR. WILLIS;
QUESTION;

Yes.
But I find it difficult to see how

you can — if you’re being genuine about proving it
beyond a reasonable doubt, how can you ever prove beyond
a reasonable doubt, in a private struggle between two
individuals, with no witnesses, as occurred here, how
can you prove beyond a reasonable doubt which one was
the aggressor and which one wasn't?
MR. WILLIS;

Well, in that context, you would

simply have to look at the circumstantial evidence to
the same extent the State would have to look at — rely
on circumstantial evidence to prove the contrary.
QUESTION;

And you really think you can prove

beyond a reasonable doubt which one was the aggressor?
MR. WILLIS;

I’ve seen it done.

And so

therefore I believe it can be done.
QUESTION;

And so what if the State succeeds

killing?

And no matter how difficult it is, the

whatsoever with accepting that.
And had that happened here, I would not be

And I would have no problem

here.
But I really want to make this point involving

— involving Patterson.

12

question asked by Justice Scalia.

13

And it goes back to the

If this case is truly analogous to Patterson,

14

and if it's controlled by Patterson and not by Mullaney,

15

New York can eliminate the statute that created that

16

gratuitous or mitigating defense.

17
18
19

Are we to say, then, that Ohio can likewise
eliminate, by statute, the right of self-defense?
Now, we talk in terms of the right to

20

self-defense.

21

statutes is that right written in.

22

It's significant that nowhere in the Ohio

What the Ohio statute says on affirmative

23

defenses is,

simply put, that the defendant shall be

24

burdened with proving self-defenses — proving

25

affirmative defenses.

And than we have these cases — Poole, which

2

relies on Silvers, which takes us back to the English

3

common law cases which have been repudiated by the House

4

of Lords.

5

What happens, then, that in Ohio a defendant

6

is burdened to this extent;

7

evidence that a crime occurred, a homicide occurred,

8

Ohio is willing to say that if you raise the defense of

9

self-defense, it's confession and avoidance.

If the State produces

16

circumstances that I was currently confronted with; and

17

that my actions were lawful, and the State ought to be

18

required to prove to the contrary.

19

QUESTION;

I was defending myself under the

Well, Mr. Willis, is it your

20

position that the State of Ohio does not allow a

21

defendant to plead self-defense unless the defendant

22

pleads guilty to the substantive elements of the crime?

23

MR. WILLIS;

No, you don't have to say, I

24

plead guilty.

But if you read Martin, that's the

25

essence of what they're saying.
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

They’re saying that self-defense seeks to —

1

2

to justify admitted conduct.
Now, we admit that we shot and killed this

3
4

man.

But we don't admit that that was criminal.
So to say, as the State of Ohio said in Davis,

5
6

which was State v. Davis, which was relied on in State

7

v. Martin, and Davis came from the same circuit court of

8

appeals as did Martin, and was cited in that case as

9

well, if that’s a valid premise, that the defendant is

10

admitting that she did an act which would otherwise be

11

unlawful and then seeks to justify it, that’s the

12

essence of what she’s doing.
She’s pleading — she’s actually pleading

13
14

guilty.

She’s saying, I’m guilty if I don’t prove I

15

acted in self-defense.
The opposite of that is that she then has to

16
17

prove herself innocent, ani

18

it, to all the cases that this Court has ever decided,

19

including Patterson and even Leland -QUESTION;

20
21

24
25

that runs afoul, as I see

But your client did not plead

guilty?
MR. WILLIS;

She plead, not guilty.

Her

defense was absolutely self-defense.
QUESTION;

And the trial court required the

State to prove the elements of murder against her, I

take it

2

MR. WILLIS:

That's exactly what the trial

3

court did.

4

included offenses of manslaughter and -- murder and

5

manslaughter coming down.

6
7

And the court submitted, as I might add, the

And of course the court instructed the jury on
self-defense with reference to all of those issues.

So

8
9

QUESTION:

Mr. Willis, can I come back briefly

10

to what a State can do by way of eliminating the defense

11

entirely?
I find it hard to conceive of a situation

12
13

where you couldn't defend yourself without intentionally

14

killing the other person.

15

incapacitate the other person, to render the other

16

person unconscious.

I mean, it’d be enough to

So why couldn't the State say, you may not

17
18

intend to kill somebody in self-defense?

Now, that's

19

what we're talking about here, intentionally killing in

20

self-defense .
Why can't a State say, you can do anything in

21

22

self-defense, you can maim,

23

you will not intentionally kill somebody in

It was developed out the jury nullification

Because there was no right of self-defense way

back yonder in the common law.

But the jurors would

simply not convict in certain circumstances.
And I take it obviously would be -- some of
those circumstances would include those where it was
obvious that the accused had no choice.
So the murder charge would be submitted to the
jury, and the jury simply would not convict.
So early on in the common law, the concept of
self-defense developed.

So in answer to your question,

Mr. Justice Scalia, jurors would not convict under those
circumstances, because traditionally, we have recognized
that we have the right of self-defense.

Whether or not this is true, I have no way of

I think that other states place different

9

QUESTION:

Yes, right.

10

MR. SADD:

I think Ohio’s burden by placing it

11

by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, affords a defendant

12

even greater protection than other states; and that it

13

gives you a measurable standard upon which

14

is to be evaluated, and nothing more than that.

16

QUESTION;

your conduct

Mr. Sadd, at the time that this

-- in 1983, there is language in

the argument as I show what the elements of Ohio law is

9

with respect to the analysis, which I think the major

10

analysis under Patterson and this Court's decision in

11

Patterson.

12

But I'd also like to note that Engle v. Isaac,

13

through your opinion, and through, I believe, Justice

14

Stevens' concurring opinion, consistently held that even

15

the statute at that time did not mandate that the State

16

of Ohio disprove the affirmative defense of

17

self-defense.

18

And that's the holding of rngle v. Isaac.

As I was saying, this Court's decision in

19

Leland and Patterson compel the conclusion that the due

20

process clause is not violated when the legislature

21

places the burden of proof on the defendant to establish

22

the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the

23

evidence, especially when the affirmative defenses

24

constitute separate matter;

25

relationship exists between the elements of the crime

and that there's no direct

4

and the affirmative defense.
Chronologically, I*d like to start my analysis
with the decision of Lelani v. Oregon.
The proposition that the petitioner has raised

5

before this Court is certainly not novel.

6

proposition was raised 34 years ago in the Leland case.

7

That same

There, the individual petitioner contended

8

that to place the burden of proving the defense of --

9

the affirmative defense of insanity upon that individual

10

by proof beyond a reasonable doubt violated the

11

Fourteenth Amendment.

12

In rejecting that claim, this Court noted in

13

Leland, and established the broad Constitutional

14

principle, that due process is not violated where Oregon

15

placed the burden of proof on the defendant to establish

16

a — beyond a reasonable doubt the affirmative defense

17

of insanity.

18

And contrary to the petitioner's argument that

19

insanity and self-defense are different, they really do

20

not differ in that both are separate matters and both

21

constitute conduct which arguably could be lawful.

22

And I think in Leland we look to the

23

Constitutional principles that this Court sought to pass

24

on to us to this very day.

25

And one of the first arguments they made was
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

to establish the elements of the crime.

that the defendant was presumed innocent and the jury

burden of proof on the defendant.

if its evidence about self-defense raises a reasonable

Again, the issue in Patterson was whether the

states to assume the burden

of disproving affirmative defenses beyond a reasonable

In rejecting this Constitutional argument,

2

Patterson cited to Leland, and observed the following.

3

Again, that the New fork, statute in question require

4

that the burden of proof would be on the state to

5

establish its elements of the crime; and second, that

6

the jury was instructed that the defendant was presumed

7

innocent.
Patterson undertook a quite extensive

8
9

historical approach to the entire question, noting that

10

in common law, affirmative defenses and the burden of

11

proving these defenses, were properly placed on the

12

defendant.

13

The historical approach further indicated that

14

this was the rule when the Fifth Amendment was adopted

15

and when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.

16

Patterson is literally a gold mine of some of

17

the most beautiful Constitutional quotations ever issued

18

from this Court.

19

Patterson stresses, for example, that

20

affirmative defenses are matters separate from the

21

elements of the crime.

22

and not negation.

23

They are matters of exception

Secondly, there’s an implicit recognition in

24

Patterson that the defendants, not the prosecution, are

25

in the best position to know the defense that these

2

And lastly, there was an explicit recognition

3

that the states m ay define their crimes, regulate their

4

procedures, and also, to regulate the burdens of proof

5

as they see fit.

6

The conclusion that I’d like to make that Ohio

7

law, like Patterson, contains numerous similarities both

8

to the Patterson decision and the Leland decisionk
For example, the Ohio law explicitly states

10

that the burden of proof for all elements of the crime

And this was the instruction given to

16

And we

Third, that self-defense was a separate issue

17

under Ohio law, and a recognition that it was a common

18

law approach.

19

And fourth, that the Ohio statute, and the

20

elements of the crime, bear no direct relationship to

21

the elements of the affirmative defense.

22

Patterson is significant because it stresses

23

that in determining what facts must be proved beyond a

24

reasonable doubt, the state legislature’s definition of

25

the elements of the defense is usually dispositive.

Consequently, Patterson establishes a bright
line standard to be applied, and it's a twofold test.
Number one, first you look to the determination of the
elements of the crime for which the petitioner was
convie ted.
Aggravated murder in Ohio consists of three
elements, and that's coming from State v. Martin;

It's

purposeful, which is the criminal intent portion of the
statute, which means a specific intention to kill; prior
calculation and design; and lastly, causing the death of
another.

that she shot her husband six times while he was talking

QUESTION;

But the jury is told how to measure

the evidence, what consequence to attach to the

4

MR. SADD:

would submit that the

elements of self-defense, in this particular case, do

6

not conflict with the elements of aggravated murder in

7

this particular case under Ohio law.

9

And I would like to save the remaining portion
of my argument to simply state that, in rejecting the

10

due process argument, Patterson explicitly states that

11

the proof of nonexistence of all affirmative defenses

12

has never been Constitutionally required, and we

13

perceive no reason to fashion such a rule in this case

14

and apply it to the statutory defense at issue here.

15

Finally, I think this Court has recognized

16

both in Patterson, and more recently in McMillian v.

17

Pennsylvania, that states enjoy wide latitude in the

18

definition of their crimes,

19

procedures under which its laws are carried out,

including the burden of producing evidence and the

And lastly,

10

to make it more difficult and to

eliminate false claims of self-defense.
We would conclude that the due process clause

11

does not mandate that the prosecution disprove

affirmative defenses beyond

13

a reasonable doubt.

This is the more reasonable approach, rather

14

than requiring the states to disprove negatives.
