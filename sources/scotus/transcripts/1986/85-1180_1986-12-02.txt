AYER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

We will hear

MR. AYER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

12

The issue in this case is the power of federal

13

courts to edit an act of Congress at the behest of one

14

who is not directly restricted or obligated under the

15

statute, but who rather guarrels with

16

impact of the particular words that Congress has

17

chosen.

18

the indirect

The Appellee is a California state senator who

19

brought suit in 1983 to enjoin the application of the

20

Foreign Agents Registration Act to three films

21

distributed by the National Film Board of Canada.

22

said that he was deterred front showing publicly those

23

films by the Act's use of the term "political

24

propaganda" to apply to the material as to which the Act

25

imposes labeling and

reporting requirements.

1

The Foreign Agents Registration Act as enacted

2

in 1938 and amended several times since then sets up a

3

scheme of registration and reporting by agents of

4

foreign principals.

5

required to first register and provide information

6

concerning themselves and concerning their foreign

7

principals, also to provide information in separate

8

reports about the dissemination of political advocacy

9

material, which is referred to under the statute by the

10

The agents under the Act are

term "political propaganda."

11

Finally, the agents are required to label any

12

such political propaganda or foreign political advocacy

13

material as defined in the statute with a label setting

14

forth certain information, including their identities

15

and the identities of their procedure principals and a

16

number of other matters as well.

17

The label itself which is required to be

18

attached to the material dees not use the sords

19

"political propaganda."

20

The district court in this case noted in its

21

rather lengthy opinion that the definition of "political

22

propaganda" as set forth in the statute is in fact

23

neutral and in no way carries negative connotations.

24

Notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the fact that

25

this statute by its direct requirements and restrictions

in no way touches upon

2

foreign agent, who is not an agent of a foreign

3

principal, who is not a foreign principal, and who is

4

not required to file any report under the statute, and

5

indeed is not even barred from removing or omitting to

6

show a label attached to any material which he does have

7

which comes within the statute, the district court

8

nonetheless found;

9

this defendant, who is not a

First, that the Appellee had standing, on the

10

ground that he was a person whose reputation would be

11

impaired by association with material that had been

12

classified as political propaganda;

13

And secondly, on the merits of the case, found

14

that the negative impact on the reputation of anyone

15

associated with the material was such as to amount to a

16

First Amendment violation; and indeed, went on to say

17

that Congress in enacting the statute deliberately set

18

forth to suppress speech, that is the category of speech

19

covered by the terms "political propaganda."

20

And on that basis the district court enjoined

21

the enforcement of four sections of the statute which

22

apply with reference to political propaganda.

23

Which sections are these, Nr.

MR. AYER i

That’s correct.

That’s section

QUESTION;

That although the statute says that

(c).

" copies of political propaganda required by this

10

subchapter to be filed with the Attorney General shall

11

be available for public inspection," the district court

12

enjoined the enforcement of that part of the statute?

13
14
15

MR. AYER;

I believe that’s Section

(c) , Your

Honor, and that is correct, yes.
We think that the character of the challenge

16

which was brought here — that is, a challenge to

17

terminology rather than a challenge to the substantive

18

requirements of the statute -- is very important to both

19

the standing and merits issues that are presented.

20

Because it is that sort of narrow challenge tc the

21

precise use of words by Congress, any analysis both for

22

standing purposes and for merits purposes must go

23

forward with the idea in mind that the substantive

24

scheme, leaving aside the words "political propaganda,"

25

is itself valid.

So that what is at issue here is not the power

19

of the Congress or the Government to in the abstract

22

Congress can use the words "political propaganda" as an

internal legislative classification device, defined in

"propaganda," and in a statute whose clear purpose is tc

2

disclose and to require disclosure of information,

3

rather than to suppress or in any way restrict the flew

We think the narrow character of that

challenge is relevant, first of all, on the question cf

of the statute, because he is not affected by them in

I

10

any way, we think that he had no standing to nitpick

11

about the particular terminology that Congress chose to

12

use.

Mr. Ayer, in that regard I guess

efforts.

HR. AYER:

Well, when one looks at the

19

declarations that were filed in this case, declarations

20

in particular by Mr. Bistrin and Mr. Freed and Mr.

21

Peterson, at least two of those, Bistrin and Peterson,

22

deal with the re-election campaign problem.

23

I think what one sees is a primary concern

24

with resentments in the district toward foreign

25

influences, particularly foreign competition.

What you must be measuring, since the

10

challenge is only to the words "political propaganda,"

11

we must be looking at how the words "political

harm which I think is clearly implicit to some degree in

14

the statute itself.

We're talking about a statute that registers

and discloses information about foreign — dissemination

of foreign information.

harm, if any, that results within that statute from the

MR. AYER;

That’s correct, yes.

One is that the^ words themselves are defined

19

in the statute in a neutral way, and so we have to

assume that people are going to learn about the words,

21

which do not appear on the label, but not learn about

22

how they're defined in the statute and not try to find

23

out, and jump to the conclusion based

24

connotations which people do sometimes draw from these

25

words that the material is somehow to be viewed in a

2

with it, who show it, giving whatever introduction they

may want to give, that they too suffer from whatever the

negative connotations are of the material.

QUESTION:

How would you distinguish the

6

Lamont versus the Postmaster General case?

certainly discusses the coercive effect of labeling for

8

standing purposes.

9

MR.

AYER:

That

Well, I think in Lamont that the

10

main distinction that

11

requirement of some affirmative action, which I take to

12

mean something more than private affirmative action like

13

snipping the label off of a film.

14

was drawn by the Court was the

The affirmative action required was the actual

15

request to the post office to deliver what had been

16

described under the statute as "communist political

17

propaganda."

18

sort of public record saying that one wants that

19

material delivered to one's house.

20

Sc that one has to go essentially on some

QUESTION:

Would this be a different case if

21

we were dealing with something that the Congress had

22

labeled communist political propaganda on these films?

23

MR.

AYER:

It would be a different case, but I

24

think the outcome would be the same.

25

because attaching the word "communist" would accentuate

The different case

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the negative connotations and perhaps increase the

2

argument for a genuine cognizable, recognizable injury.

3

But I think, that the outcome would be the

4

same, primarily because the Congress ought to be free,

5

within some fairly wide parameters, to define its

6

terminology and use it in a way that it desires to.

7

I think the important point here is that Congress has

8

not made up a definition that’s completely unrelated to

9

the word.

10

And

It has taken one of the main line conventional

11

meanings of the word "propaganda" and applied it to the

12

word, to the word.

13

district court itself found tc be completely neutral and

14

without negative connotations.

15

And it has done it in a way that the

To suggest that Congress can’t take a word and

16

select one of its definitions and say, now, we don’t

17

want any mistake, this is what we mean, I think is to

18

say that courts are ready to invade very far into the

19

scope of Congress’ authority

20

QUESTION;

—

Mr. Ayer, I think that goes to the

21

merits rather than the standing question.

Confining it

22

for the moment to the standing issue, supposing they use

23

the word obscenity or obscene or pornographic or

24

something like that to classify a certain category of

25

motion picture, and it was an overly broad description,
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it covered wearing your shirt sleeves or something like

2

that.

3

Could an exhibitor object to that cn the

4

ground that it adversely affected his reputation to be

5

described as a person showing obscene films when he

6

didn’t think they really were obscene?

7

8

MR. AYER;

I think it would require an

analysis of the extent of the harm that might result.

statute *
MR. AYER i

I think if the word was defined in

21

a way that was consistent with a conventional meaning

22

such that Congress was not making it up —

23

QUESTION!

In other words, it seems to me that

24

whether the definition is a good one or not goes to --

25

you say that determines the standing as well as the

(202) 628-9300

1

merits?
MR.

2

AYER;

Well, I think in standing what

3

we're trying tc look at is the nature of the injury, and

4

we're trying to determine whether there is a cognizable

5

injury, whether it rises to a sufficient level that it's

6

recognizable.

7

And I think that --

8

QUESTIONj

9
10
11

You think in my obscenity example

it would depend on how good,

how accurate the definition

«as?
MR.

AYER i

I think that would be a factor.

12

think you would have to at least consider wh ether

13

Congress had taken a word which has --

14

QUESTION;

Well, he alleges in h is complaint

15

that the definition is an inaccurate one, as I guess

16

this — here he concedes that the definiti cn cf

17

"propaganda" is a neutral definition, does he?

18

judge found that, I know, but did the plai ntiff alsc

19

concede that?

20

The

He doesn't object to the definition of

21

"propaganda"?

22

MR.

AYER;

I don't know whether the — I think

23

the plaintiff may not concede that it’s a neutral

24

definition.

25

I

I believe that's true.

QUESTION;

So in my hypothetical he's

challenging the accuracy of the definition of obscenity

2

and he also says that it harms his reputation because he

3

wants to show seme films that would fit within the

4

definition.

5

object?

6

MR.

You’d say that he'd have no standing to

AYER:

I think

I can't answer that without

7

going to another question, which I think ultimately the

8

Court doesn't have to resolve here, and that is the

9

question of whether Government speech in pursuit of any

10

goal that Government, Congress, whatever, has the power

11

constitutionally to pursue, whether that speech may ever

12

be attacked on First Amendment grounds.
And

13
14

I think -- I don't know the answer to

that, but —
QUESTION:

15

Well, but even if it can't, that

16

again would be a merits answer, wouldn't it?

17

wouldn't suggest that no one would ever have standing tc

18

challenge it?

19

absolute right to say what it wants tc, but are you

20

suggesting that no matter how harmful the speech might

21

be, calling a person vile names and all, that there

22

would be no standing to challenge that?

It may be that the Government has an

1

Well, I'm only inquiring about the

2

standing at this point.

3

MR.

AYER;

I guess my answer -- maybe it's not

at all a complete one, but my answer is that

have to look, at the particular case, at the nature of

11

this one on pregapanda.
I don't see that that really changes the

think, assuming a power in Congress or in the

I think the Government would have the power to do that.

But

Again, I think the analogy to this case is a

8

good one, in that if the statute which otherwise

9

regulates the material does in itself cast seme sort of

10

a light over someone, but nonetheless it's within the

11

power of regulation, then the incremental effect of the

12

terminology may well be such

standing to challenge the statute as a whole.

MR. AYER;

going to the effect on this

14

basically yes. Your Honor.

the material that's been subm itted is the one I alluded

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

think it supports the position that we are taking here

2

that there is no standing.

3

is that there were three aspects in Block to the

4

standing issue.

The reason we believe that

14

On that basis, Mr.

I think that's a different case than

QUESTION;

on the part of Mr. Block,

100 copies.

Mr. Ayer, do you plan to discuss

the merits as well as standing?
MR.

AYER;

I would like to, Your Honor.

On

23

the merits of the case, we think first of all that the

24

merits can be resolved without deciding the extent of

25

the First Amendment protection of Government speech as
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

speech, that is Government simply speaking and stating

2

its view.

3

We think the issue here is simply whether

4

Congress in carrying out on unchallenged legislative

5

scheme, which is what we have, may for internal

6

classification purposes only utilize terminology which

7

it defines in a clear and non-derogatory way consistent

8

with one of several accepted common meanings of those

9

words .
Or on the other side, taking the other view,

10
11

Congress can be barred from doing that because some

12

terms that it uses and defines neutrally may be

13

misunderstood as having negative connotations, which in

14

everyday usage at times at least it may have.

15

this falls plainly on the permissible side of the First

16

Amendment line, first of all because it is, in terms of

17

sorting different kinds of speech, it is viewpoint

18

neutral.

We think

on.

The closest cases I think that the Appellees

13
14

have come up with are the compelled disclosure of

cases.

17

I think one is that there is no affirmative disclosure

required here at all, as there is in that case.

19

And there are several distinctions tc be made.

Another is that I think the governmental

20

interest here is more substantial.

21

you accept that those cases apply and you apply the test

22

which was invoked in those cases for creating an

exception to the disclosure requirement, the test is

MR.

EONHQFFi

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
Unlike the characterization of Mr. Ayer, my

opponent, about the issue in this case, I'd like to

5

begin with what we think is the issue and the district

6

court felt was the issue, too.

It classifies speech as the political

propaganda of a foreign power on the basis of nc more

substantial determination of what that speech contains

14

than that it does contain political material that either

material of high quality journalistic standards for

3

If that kind cf material is produced without

4

any intent to inf1uence the A merican public, if somebody

5

in this country who wishes to receive that material may

6

so reasonably adapt that material to influence this

7

country's public policies, persons connected with those

8

public policies, then that material too may be

9

classified as political propaganda under the Act.

10

QUESTIONi

Would it make any difference in

11

your argument, Mr. Donhoff, if instead of political

12

propaganda Congress had used the term "foreign

13

advocacy," so that you had to say it was a foreign

14

advocacy film?

15

MR. ECNHGFF;

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it

16

would make enough of a difference so that this case

17

wouldn't have been brought, except for two matters.

18

There is no evidence in the record that denominating

19

objective journalism or any other kind of speech,

20

singling it out from the stream of commerce and

21

classifying it as foreign political advocacy would be

22

any less harmful to Senator Keene's reputation or any

23

more harmful to Senator Keene’s reputation, or is at all

24

cn a par with

25

the harm that arises from the “political

2
3

QUESTION;

So you would regard it as something

for another evidentiary inquiry, really?

4

MR. ECNHGFF;

I think some ether plaintiff,

5

some other time, perhaps might have some question

6

regarding that particular characterization.

7

argued that political advocacy is something in and of

8

itself a term that we have a problem with.

However, one must look at the classification

14

by the district court, Mr. Chief Justice, because they

15

each use the term "political propaganda" and refer to

16

the material classified as "political propaganda," and

17

thus could not be enforced with regard to these

18

particular films because the Department was enjoined

19

from classifying these films in a pejorative manner.

QUESTION;

Well, what I'm trying to get at is

21

how far the district court’s pejorative manner ruling

goes.

the case may be, status as defined by a statute to the

extent that it harms his reputation, if he quarrels with

I'll go this far,

I think, in

meeting the government's objection with regard to the

21

camel's nose under the tent argument.

22

when we're dealing with the expression of pure political

23

core value protected speech and nothing else, that the

24

government is constrained from sc classifying the

25

material, irrespective of the regulations that they may

That is, at least

the material as to impair the usefulness of that

3

material to citizens of this country or those within its

4

borders and expressing themselves in public debate.

But so classifying

To the extent that labor organizing or

5

6

disorganizing also is a matter of activity which mav he

7

illegal or made illegal or otherwise regulated that is

8

not pure expression, then maybe the standard would be

9

lesser.

10

However, when you're dealing with pure speech

11

one must ask,

12

think we can start, certainly, with talking about

13

standing and the harm, and I intend to get to —

14

what's the reason for this designation.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF

DONALD B. AYER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. AYERi

Mr. Donhoff indicated that it would

be a mistake tc determine these issues piece by piece in

10

this instance by singling out the words "political

11

propaganda" and taking them in isolation.

12

to agree with that and go a step further with the

13

standing argument which I made earlier, focusing cn the

14

injury, the palpable injury, and the redressability of

15

the injury.

I would like

And I'd like to suggest that perhaps this case

16
17

is much like other cases that this Court has decided,

18

where it has found no justiciable claim to exist, where

19

the claim is of incidental effects, but there is no

20

direct regulation, proscription, compulsion, or any

21

ether kind of direct adverse treatment involved.

pick at words because they are arguably affected in seme

5

litigation focusing on pieces of statutes, rather than

going to the main crux of what someone is arguing

about.

If we're going to let people come in and

I think that’s particularly important here,
where the issue is whether Congress can shcose words and

10

indeed also, because this is a case involving foreign

11

policy, where I think if any case is proper to Congress’

12

choice of words and Congress’ judgment this is one.

Thank you very much .
