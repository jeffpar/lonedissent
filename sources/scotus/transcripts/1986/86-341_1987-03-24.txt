CHIEF JUSTICE RERNQUIST;

You may proceed

whenever you're ready, Mr. Yavis.

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF

5

JOHN C. YAVIS, JR.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

7

MR. YAVIS:

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice, and

8

may it please the Court:

9

the conflict between ERISA and a Maine statute upheld by

10
11

This case presents for decision

the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.
ERISA makes employee benefit plans a subject of

12

exclusive federal concern.

13

all state laws that relate to such plans.

14

And expressly preempts any and

While the Maine statute requires payment of

15

severance pay benefits included within ERISA coverage.

16

summary, our position is, first, that ERISA Section 514

17

preempts state mandated or state created plans.

18

And second, that the Section 4(B)(3) exemption

19

does not extend to the Maine severance pay law.

20

that Maine may not impose a severance pay plan any more

21

than it might impose a pension plan.

22

In

We submit

Briefly with respect to the facts of this case,

23

Fort Halifax is part of a larger group of companies headed

24

by Corbett Enterprises, Inc. which in 1981 had operations

25

in approximately

11 states.

These were poultry operations

1

and Fort Halifax operated its plant in Maine from 1972

2

until May of 1991 when the plant closed because of adverse

3

market conditions.

4

Fort Halifax had a collective bargaining

5

agreement in force at the time of the plant closing and

6

pursuant to that plan it had provided a retirement plan to

7

its production workers and various employee welfare

8

benefit plans including life insurance, combination life

9

and health, major medical and accident and sickness as

10
11

well as other employee benefits.
The collective bargaining agreement however did

12

not call however, for the payment of severance pay.

And

13

in this action, the Maine Department of Labor, sought to

14

enforce that Maine Severance Pay Statute which covers

15

establishments with basically 100 or more employees that

16

relocate or close, that is the establishment relocates or

17

closes, the statute requires payment of severance pay to

18

eligible employees.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Yavis, is the employer’s

20

compliance with that statute subject to ERISA?

21

regulations govern anythin? that occurs in order to comply

22

with that statute.

23

MR. YA7I3;

Do ERISA

I don’t believe that the ERISA

24

regulations would apply because ERISA in cur opinion would

25

preempt the application of the statute.

MR. YAVIS;

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. YAVIS:

11
12

in implementing that statute,

The statute does not call for that.

The Maine statute does not call for that.

6

10

Make

But does ERISA call for it?
ERISA does —
If it’s not preempted by ERISA, --

QUESTION;

Yes, ERISA then —
-- would there have to be compliance

with any ERISA regulations?
MR. YAVIS;

ERISA

does cover severance pay plans

13

expressly and that’s in 3(1 )(A) where some courts have

14

held that ERISA covers severance benefits as benefits as

15

benefits in the event of unemployment.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Which means what?

What would ERISA

require to be done with respect to this plan?
MR. YAVIS:

There would be, for example,

19

disclosure to employees, reporting, there would be

20

fiduciary standards, there would be access to federal

21

courts, there would be potential intrusion by the Federal

22

Department of Labor.

23

assure that the benefits were received.

24
25

QUESTION:

Various protective measures to

I assume it’s also true that if there

were no state statute, but if a private employer had a
5

(202) 628-9300

plan, a severance pay plan precisely the same as vhat the
statute requires that private employer would also be
covered by ERISA.
MR . YAYI3:
20ESTI3N;

That is correct.
(Inaudible) to that plan.

MR. YAVI3:

I should add, Your Honor, that there

are alternative grounds in the statute for including
severance pay as an ERISA benefit.

In 3(1)(B) there's a

severance pay specific reference to severance benefits and
in 3(2)(B) which was adopted by Congress in

19B0 there’s a

reference to severance pay arrangements and Congress gave
authority to the Department of Labor, to the Secretary to
define severance pay arrangements as welfare benefit plans
instead of what might have been the case to have them
treated as pension plans.
The Department of Labor regulations do define
severance benefits as welfare plans and therefore for
purposes of ERISA, they are employee benefit plans.

The

Maine statute presents an employer with a choice.
Either have a private contract granting,
providing is the statutory word, providing severance pay,
or pay severance pay according to the statute.

The

statute defines eligibility, the type of benefit that will
be provided,

who may obtain that benefit and when, and

what procedure one will follow to collect it.
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The eligibility is basically three years or more

2

of employment.

The type of benefit is defined as

3

severance pay.

The amount is one weeks pay for each year

4

of employment at tie establishment, and in this case that

5

meant that the judgment below covered periods before the

6

date of acquisition of the plant by Fort Halifax.
The statute covers when payments are due and it

7

8

provides a procedure for collecting benefits and strangely

9

provides for suit in state or federal court.

The statute

10

has within itself, in other words all the indicia of a

11

plan .
The term plan itself is not defined as such in

12
13

ERISA.

Is it referred to as a plan fund or program but

14

there's otherwise no formal requirement for what must

15

constitute a plan.
On

16

its face therefore, the Maine plan,

the §iainc_

17

law purports to regulate a defined ERISA benefit plan,

18

that is severance pay.

19

preempts that law to the extent the law relates to any

20

employee benefit plan.

21

contend is apparent on the face of the statute.
QUESTION:

22

And ERISA Section 514 then

Now the relationship here we

r.na definition in the ERISA is it's a plan

And you contend that when the statute was

1

passed, well how does that language fit the statute?
MR. YAYIS;

2

Well in this case, Your Honor, the

3

plan has been initiated by the statutory action of the

4

state of Maine.
QUESTI3N;

5

Do you think that this language in

6

ERISA covers that plan established or maintained by the

7

state of Maine.
MR. YAVIS;

8
9

If the plan were solely established

by the state of Maine and not maintained by the employer

10

then perhaps the answer would be no.

11

that the —
QUESTION;

12

But we do maintain

Say for, take for the example, say

13

you didn't have a plan at all.

14

just didn't provide for severance or benefits or anything,

15

but you would have to comply with the statute.

16

compliance with the statute in your view fall within this

17

definition (inaudible).
MR. YAYISi

18

You're an employer that

Would your

Yes, it would because we would be

19

required to maintain that plan.

The company would be the

20

one that would have to pay the benefits.

21

would be the one that would have to administer the

22

benefits.

23

forth; to perhaps defend claims if any were raised.

24

our position is yes, it is the employer that is required

25

to maintain the plan --

The company

To find tie people to write the checks and so

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

So,

QUESTION:

1
2

Not to establish it, but to maintain

it.

3

MR. YAVI3:

4

QUESTION:

5

That's correct.
And you say the act of the writing

the checks is enough to be maintaining a plan?

6

MR. YAVIS;

Yes, and

7

QUESTION;

8

when you fire them, I'm sure.

9

MR. YAYIS;

—

If you know who the employees are

But there may or may not be

10

eligibility.

For example, if someone at a covered

11

established is someone employed for three years or not,

12

are there breaks in service and so forth.
QUESTION;

13

So, --

But that's not a plan that the

14

employer, that's all a matter of statutory compliance

15

isn't it?

16

MR. YAVIS;

Well those ace, what we say is that

17

the statute in effect presents the plan to the employer,

18

that the employer must thereby maintain that plan.

19

QUESTION:

You say that, in other words, what

20

you're saying is compliance with the statute is equivalent

21

to maintaining a plan.

22

MR. YAVIS;

That is correct.

And in this case

23

it would, if we had

24

that would be the maintenance of the plan.

25

QUESTION:

the same plan apart from the statute

Well if you had it voluntarily -9

This is not something that you

you had said --

We are compelled to do it by the

force of the statute.
QUESTION:

9

10

Yes, yes.

But here of course,

the employer did

have some sort of ERISA plan in effect.
MR. YAVI3:

11

Yes it did.

Yes, it had the

12

retirement plan foe production workers.

It had a

13

retirement plan for administrative and clerical personnel.

14

And it had the four employee welfare benefit plans that I

15

mentioned.

16

I'll taka this opportunity to say that in the

17

state of Maine's brief they say to the contrary that we

18

had no other plans besides the retirement plans.

not correct.

QUESTION;

EBISA doesn’t require that either?

2

MR. YAVIS:

It does not.

It does not require a

3

trust.

4

reasonably currently after the severance.

5

As long as the payment is going to be made out

QUESTION;

So even if a private employer set up

6

the same kind of a plan under his own authority without a

7

statute compelling it, he would be doing no more than what

8

your client does writing a check.

9

MR. YAVIS;

Right, Your Honor, a person subject

10

to such a plan should go through the publication and

11

disclosure aspects, but up to the time of payment there is

12

no requirement for funding, no requirement for a trust.

13

The ERISA and the regulations do not require that in the

14

case of the severance pay category of plan.

15

QUESTION:

Does the Maine statute require you to

16

do that publication?

17

MR. YAVIS;

18

QUESTION;

19

MR. YAVIS:

20

QUESTION;

21

It does not?

and notification that ERISA does.
MR. YAVIS;

23

QUESTION;

25

Does it require you to do what?
To do the same kind of publication

22

24

No, it does not.

No, it does not.
So unless your plan is covered by

ERISA those duties of
MR. YAVIS;

the employer would be eliminated,
That is correct and those are, of
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

course, the duties considered important by ERISA.
QUESTION!

But if it were held, and I am not

saying it should be,

but if

it were held that there is no

preemption here then those duties wouldn’t apply to
compliance with the Maine statute.
All you would haye to do with regard to
severance pay is do what the statute requires if it were
held that there was no preemption.
MR. YAVISi

I suppose that's right.

If ERISA

doesn’t apply at all.
QUESTION!

You wouldn’t have to give notice or

any of that.
MR. YA/ISi

The structure of ERISA supports the

congressional intent to have broad preemption of any and
all state laws.

That is the phrase, any and all in

Section 514 (A) and the relationship here is that one
either has to have the statutory plan or the private
contract providing for severance pay.
I'd like to point out other aspects of the
structure of ERISA that bear on that congressional intent.
The definition of the term,

state, in Section 3(10), ten

in parenthesis, applies to the overall statute and
basically says a state is a

state.

But in Section 514

there is a second definition of state in 514(0(2).
QUESTION!

(Inaudible).

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

SR. YAVT3:

Your Honor, 514(C)(2) is at page 66

2

of the jurisdictional statement appendix.

3

definition of state for the purposes of preemption is now

4

refined, expanded, clarified in a very significant way.

5

And the

The term state now includes a state which

6

purports to regulate directly or indirectly the terms and

conditions of employee benefit plans covered by this

subchapter.

10

And as I 'va indicated a severance pay plan is

State law on the same page, the preceding

11

subsection 1 , is also broadly defined, again to indicate

12

Congress* intent to broadly preempt any and all state

13

laws, and it*s defined to include other state action.

14

QUESTIDNi

So you

would make the same argument

15

if the state just said, we’re not going to say anything

16

about what should be in a plan, but you have to have a

17

severance plan.

18

MS. YAVI3;

Yes.

Otherwise,

Congress contemplated that state

attempts to mandate EBISA benefit plans would be within

13

ERISA’s coverage and subject to preemption.

14

have been subsegaent proposed amendments to 4(B)(3).
None have been adopted.

15

Now there

There was an amendment

16

in 1983 that followed this Court's decision, this Court's

17

affirmance in Agsalud, but the decision was left in tact.

18

Basically, the statute was amended in minor ways to

19

accommodate the Hawaiian statute in part, not in total.
And the basic preemptive scope of 514 was left

20
21

in place following those amendments.

Those amendments

22

then themselves show Congress* desire to have a broad

23

preemptive scope, broad preemption of any and all state

24

laws.

25

its statute means in order to avoid 514(C)(2).

Now in this Court, Maine is trying to redefine what

MR. WRIGHT*

6

I hope I, what I, let me clarify.

7

An employer who establishes on his own a plan or any kind

8

of arrangement with his employees to pay severance pay

9

either in the event of a plant’s closing or to pay

10

severance pay generally is,

11

Maine law by the vary terms of the Maine statute.
QUESTION;

12

13

we believe, exempted from the

Well that may be so.

But now here is

an employer who established it because of the Maine law.
MR. WRIGHT;

14

Well, if an employer creates a

15

plan, they exempt themselves from the Maine law.

16

sure, if an employer merely pays what is required by the

17

Maine law we are not suggesting that that creates an ERISA

18

plan.

MR. WRIGHT;

22

Well, what we're really suggesting

23

is this.

The statutory obligation created by Maine law

24

does not bear any resemblance to the kind of employee

25

benefit plan which Gongress was intending to regulate

QUESTION:

2

Why?

You said that if there was a

3

private plan that reguired severance payments only upon

4

removal of the plant, it would be covered.
MR. WRIGHT;

5
6

I think, in that instance it would

probably be covered.

7

QUESTION;

Okay.

So now you're telling us that

8

Maine can, or any state I presume, can take its employers

9

out of the coverage of ERISA, by simply mandating by law

10

what ERISA would cover had the employers done it

11

voluntarily.
That's a great out for a lot of employers.

12

Just

13

get the states to enact a law that covers the kind of plan

14

they want to adopt and that plan is out of ERISA.

on, I care about the law they wrote.

of distinction.
MR. WRIGHT;

8
9

What

Now why is there

we're suggesting, Justice

Scalia, is that the wording of the statute has to be

10

interpreted in light of the underlying policies of the

11

ERISA statute.
QUESTION;

12

What word would enable this

13

distinction that you can yank a, what would otherwise be a

14

covered severance plan out of ERISA simply by adopting a

15

state statute that covers it but you can't yank anything

16

else out of EPISA by adopting a state statute that covers

17

it?

18

MR. WRIGHT;

What you've got, the definition of

19

an ERISA plan is a plan or fund which provides certain

20

kinds of employee benefits and which is either established

21

or maintained by an employer .

22

So what we're suggesting is that if you don't

23

have something wiich rises to the level of an ERISA plan,

24

and if you don't have a plan which is created by an

25

employer, or which is maintained by an employer, then we

You would draw a distinction, as I

take it, to follow up on Justice Scalia's hypothetical,

MR. WRIGHT;

That's correct.

That's correct.

20

And I'm referring to both.

The plans that I think

21

Congress was focusing on were these private arrangements

1

I’m sure of that.

But what I’m

2

worried about at least, is that I’m sure that Congress

3

didn’t intend to enable one of those private plans that

4

is, the same kind is if it had been adopted in

5

negotiations with a union to be yanked out of ERISA simply

6

by having it required by state law.
And so, if this severance plan is in fact no

7

8

different from what the employer would be doing under

9

ERISA, I’d be very reluctant to find that the state can in

10

effect, yank it out of ERISA by mandating it.

11

MR. WRIGIT:

12

QUESTION;

Your Honor -It is not the mandating of it by the

13

state alone that can possibly take it out of ERISA right

14

here.

15

MR. WRIG'iT;

No.

And maybe I can clarify that.

16

We are not suggesting that it’s the state mandate that

17

that takes a plan out of ERISA.

18

what the state is mandating is an ERISA covered plan.

19

The question is whether

And that is really, I think, the question that’s

before the Court today.

we’re interested in arguing about.

QUESTION;

6

Do we know what position the

Secretary takes on this?
MR. WRIGHT:

7

I think the Secretary's position is

8

that the Maine law itself requires the creation of an

9

ERISA covered plan and following from that premise, it

10

would argue that the Maine law is preempted.

11

think that if the Secretary

And, I think that the Secretary -QUESTION;

Well, I'm not sure that's accurate

because apparently the Solicitor General's speaking for

the Secretary would say that states cannot direct specific

20

benefits to be provided if they are the type of benefits

21

covered by ERISA.

22

MR. WRIGHT:

And I think that’s both right.

23

Justice O'Connor, and what I'm really suggesting is that

24

the Secretary's position, or at least as reported by the

25

Solicitor General, seems to be that merely requiring a

(202) 628-9300

1

benefit is, that statement alone, that requirement alone

2

is sufficient to create an ERISA covered plan.
QUESTIDN;

3

That's'--

One of the things that the Solicitor

4

General relies upon is the fact that in ERISA and in the

5

preemption section.

6

Hawaii’s law which provided for a specific kind of health

7

benefit.

Congress specifically carved out

8

MR. WRIGHT:

9

QUESTION;

That's correct.
And opted not to protect any other

10

type of state law.

That might indeed be an indicator that

11

Congress was trying to be very specific about what states

12

could do or not do, and intended to preclude a law like

13

Maine’s.
MR. WRIGHT:

14

Well

the Hawaii Fre-paid Health

15

Care Act which is the Act that you’re referring to is an

16

Act which really goes way beyond what Maine does.

17

doesn't just require a one-time payment in the event of a

18

plant closing, it required employers to establish a

19

comprehensive, on-going system of providing health

20

benefits .

21

It

And it included within that, it was, that system

22

was imposed upon existing ERISA plans.

It required

23

employers to alter and amend their existing ERISA plans

24

and it also contained certain reporting requirements which

25

went beyond,

or conflicted with, what ERISA itself

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

requires

2

So it seems to me that the issue of the Hawaii

3

Act was a fairly easy case ani what Congress then did in

4

response to a court decision was to suggest that certain

5

features of the Hawaiian law, not all of them, not the

6

conflicting reporting provisions, but certain features

7

would not be preempted.

8
9

And the legislative history on that as the
Solicitor General's brief I

think itself includes is

10

somewhat conflicting in that the Senate Committee said

11

that it felt that preemption of the Hawaii law was

12

inadvertent.

13

And there is other statements made that the

14

decision in the Hawaii case was exactly correct.

15

would suggest that the statements are not necessarily a

16

reliable guide to what Congress meant when it enacted the

17

original preemption provision.

18

And we

But in any event that those statements really

19

don't provide guidance here in view of the fundamental

20

differences between this law and the Hawaii law.

21

that, I think, gets me back to the issue of why this law

22

does not create an ERISA covered plan.

And it seems to me that there’s really three

reasons for that.

4

What I really want to, in focusing on this

5

there's this one principal I'd like to get back to and

6

that is this, that the issue of preemption and the

7

interpretation of the preemption provision it seems to me

8

has to be interpreted in light of the fundamental

9

principle that preemption is not a favorite doctrine and

10

that has been stated by this court in, I think, as early

11

as the Florida Lime and Avocado case is saying that

12

preemption should not be found unless Congress

13

unmistakably intended to displace state law.

14

from principles of preemption which we believe this court

15

is fully familiar with.

16

That follows

It follows from respect for state law.

It

17

follows from

a respect for the states as sovereign

18

entitles and a respect for state's authority to meet the

19

problems of its residents through its police power and we

20

submit that that's exactly what Maine has done here.

21

The problem of plant closings is not unique to

22

Maine, but it's a particular problem in Maine because of

23

the number of Maine towns where one major plant is a

24

dominant employer.

25

other state has adopted to meet this problem.

So Maine has adopted a statue which no

unemployment problem created by a plant closing and we
