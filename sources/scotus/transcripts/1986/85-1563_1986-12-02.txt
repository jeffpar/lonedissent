2

verdict may be.
The jury was also instructed that they were to

take into account and be guided by various aggravating

5

and mitigating factors contained in instruction known as

6

"Caljic 8.84.1.”

7

and mitigating factors and also indicated the jury could

8

consider any other circumstance which extenuated the

9

gravity of the offense, even though not a legal excuse

10

That laid out the various aggravating

for the crime.
The jury was finally instructed with Caljic

11

8.84.2 which indicated the jury could consider, take

13

into account, and be guided by the applicable factors cf

14

aggravation and mitigation upon which it had been

Mr. Bloom, where in the

MR. BLOOM;

Well, it is our position, Your

(202) 628-9300

1

Honor, that Caljic 8.481 which deals with the various

2

aggravating, mitigating factors, it discusses the jury

3

is to consider the circumstances of the offense, prior

4

violent conduct, any mental defects of the individual,

5

and under the "K" section, any other circumstance which

6

extenuates the gravity of the offense, even though not a

7

legal excuse.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

Did it say -- was the instruction,

"any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of
the crime"?
MR. BLOOM:

No.

The exact language, Your

12

Honor, was "any other circumstance which extenuates the

13

gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal

14

excuse for the crime.

15

QUESTION;

And do you think that that makes it
I

16

clear to the jury that they could consider evidence

17

going to the background and character of the defendant?

18

MR. BLOOM:

Yes, Your Honor, because in the

19

first place this instruction tracks exactly penal code

20

190.3 which this Court discussed in California versus

21

Ramos, and in that decision this Court indicated in

22

footnote 19 of the opinion that the instruction allowed

23

the jury to consider all evidence to show a penalty less

24

than death was appropriate and met the standards of

25

Lockett versus Ohio.

This Court also noted, citing to
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

190.3,

that the California scheme like the Texas

2

sentencing scheme insures the jury will hear all

3

relevant mitigating evidence.
Now, in addition, in Pulley versus Harris

4
5

which dealt with the 1977 California law, this Court had

6

occasion to also discuss 190.3, which was substantially

7

the same language, and the Court indicated that the

8

statute and the California system was constitutional.

9

So, since the instruction given here tracks

10

exactly 190.3, which in essence has been upheld by this

11

Court in Ramos and Pulley versus Harris, to permit a

12

defendant to present all relevant mitigating evidence,

13

it is our position that the instruction does allow the

14

jury to consider all the relevant evidence.
Basically,

15

what the position of the state in

16

this case is, is the instruction telling the jury not to

17

be swayed by mere sentiment, sympathy, conjecture; tells

18

the jury, the best it can, to divorce itself from

19

emotion.

20

factors but are motions of the jurors, as Justice Mosk

21

indicated below in his dissent in the Lamphear

22

decision.

23

then is to consider all the relevant mitigating evidence.

24
25

What these factors are, are not mitigating

And, when followed by Caljic 9.481, the jury

This Court indicated in Gardner versus Florida
that a motion has no place in decision to impose the
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

death penalty.

In addition, the Chief Justice,

2

dissenting recently in Caldwell versus Mississippi,

3

indicated, "There is nothing wrong with urging a capital

4

sentencing jury to disregard a motion and render a

5

decision based on the law and the facts."
He then said, "I do not understand the Court

6

7

to believe that motions in favor of mercy must play a

8

part in the ultimate decision of a capital sentencing

9

jury.

Indeed, much of our Eiahth Amendment

10

jurisprudence has been concerned with eliminating

11

emotion from sentencing decisions."

12

It is our position that what these

13

instructions do is, the instruction telling the jury not

14

to be swayed by sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, et

15

cetera, tells the jury, put aside these emotions.

16

have no place in determining life or death.

17

you are to do is to view the facts and the law as given

18

to you in Caljic 8.84.1 and

19

They

But what

Caljic 8.84.2.

In addition, the amotions dealt with here,

20

sympathy, sentiment and conjecture, aren't necessarily

21

beneficial to the defendant as respondent alleges here.

22

Sentiment, sympathy and conjecture could just as likely

23

be engendered for the victim, or just as likely be

24

engendered against the defendant in a death penalty case.

25

QUESTION;

Mr. PI ooi, may I follow up on a

12

question that Justice C'Con nor asked you about the

13

adequacy of the instruction s to take into consideration

14

the mitigating evidence, an d I have in mind particularly

15

the argument of the prosecu tor at the Joint Appendix at

16

page 90 and 91 where he ref ers to the fact that they

17

brought in a parade of rela fives who talked about the

18

background of the defendant as a child and then argued

19

that that testimony was a b latant attempt by the defense

20

to inject personal feelings in the case to make the

21

defendant appear human, to make you feel for the

22

defendant and so forth, but that the judge would in

mitigating evidence?

2

MR. BLOOM:

Well,

no, Your Honor.

What he was

3

telling the jury was to consider the facts and the law.

4

At the opening of his argument, for example, he says,

5

"You are not

6

these factors.**

7

to consider sympathy, sentiment or any of

But then he goes on and says, "You are to

8

consider the mitigating factors," and he goes through

9

them and lists them.

10
11

That’s the opening of the

prosecutor's argument.
Now, in addition he also notes at one point in

12

his argument that the jurors are not to be swayed by

13

sympathy for the victims.

14

facts and the law of the case.

15

QUESTION:

They are to consider the

Well, I understand that, but is

16

there an instruction in there that -- T don’t think --

17

you responded to Justice O’Connor, I believe, by

18

referring to the instruction that says, you should not

19

-- you may consider matters that reduce the character of

20

the offense or of the crime, the quality of the crime.

21

But is there anything that suggests to the

22

jury that they may consider the sympathetic aspects of

23

the defendant’s personal history?

24
25

MR. BLOOM:

Well,

I think my point was that

the instruction as a whole allows the jury to —

QUESTION;

2

It allows them to do it/ but does

it tell them to do it?
NR. BLOOM;

3

Well, yes.

It tells them that

4

they are to take into account and be guided by the

5

following factors, and then it lists the various factors

6

and some of the factors, for example, are the age of

7

defendant, whether at the time of the offense he had the

8

capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or

9

to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law,

10

whether he acted

11

domination of another person, whether the offense was

12

committed under a circumstance which the defendant

13

reasonably believed --

15

But none of those mentioned his

background, his personal background?
MR. BLOOM;

16

17

under duress or under substantial

QUESTION;

14

the

circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime.

18

QUESTION;

The gravity of the crime.

19

MR. BLOOM;

Even though it is not a legal

20

excuse.

Now, the California Supreme Court in the Easley

21

case did indicate that it felt that instruction dealt

22

only with the offense and not the offender.

23

this Court as I indicated in the Ramos decision,

24

indicated in footnote 19 that 190.3 of the penal code,

25

which this instruction is a

However,

verbatim statement of that,
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

does comport with Lockett and Eddings and allows the

2

jury to consider all relevant mitigating evidence.
So, my point is in essence that this Court has

3
4

already upheld the validity of this instruction by

5

upholding 190.3 because they are the exact same language.
QUESTION;

6

But in

doing that, did we have

7

before us an argument or — like the prosecutor made

8

here, or the other statements that were made to the

9

jury?

Maybe that catchall instruction is a little bit

10

ambiguous, but what happens when it’s coupled with the

11

argument that was made to the jury?
MR. BLOOM;

12

I think there are two answers to

13

that.

14

before the Court, it is the facial validity of the

15

instruction.

16

First of all, I think as I understand the issue

Now, there may ba cases where a prosecutor may

17

go beyond bounds.

18

but the issue is whether the four corners of the

19

instruction comport with the Eighth Amendment.

20

We’re not saying this is the case,

QUESTION;

Why is that, now?

That the

21

prosecutor’s instructions -- the prosecutor’s argument,

22

you say, are not before us and cannot be considered?

23

MR. BLOOM:

Well,

I’m saying that I don’t

24

understand that to be the issue before the Court.

25

understand the issue to be the facial validity of the

1

instruction itself.

That was what cert was granted on.

Now, of course a prosecutor may make arguments

2
3

in some cases that go beyond the limits of this

4

instruction.

5

arguments were consistent with that instruction.

In addition, in this case the prosecutor's

QUESTION;

6

Well, do you think so?

7

addition to the other things that have been

8

said, there is mitigation.

9

activity, no mitigation, right?

I mean, in

Now, is it really possible to say that there

17
18

was no mitigation in everything that had been brought

19

forward, other circumstances, no mitigation?
MR. BLOOM;

20

But in California the jury is

21

instructed that the arguments of the prosecutor are not

22

the law.

23

He's saying, the defense evidence does not constitute

24

substantial mitigation to determine a punishment less

25

than death.

The jury — the prosecutor presents his case.

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The defense then gets up and says, we've put

2

on all this evidence of mitigation.

It's an argument

3

between both sides as to wnether the evidence is

4

substantial mitigation or not.

5

the jury is precluded from considering it.

It does not mean that

6

It's just the argument of the prosecutor.

7

He's not saying, you cannot consider this evidence.

8

He’s saying, divorce yourself -- first of all, he is

9

saying, divorce yourself from the emotions and look at

10

the facts and the law.

11

at the facts and the law, there is no mitigation here.

12

QUESTION;

And then he says, when you look

Hell, I think a jury could

13

reasonably understand

14

the instruction were clear enough.

15

instruction says, "any other circumstance which

16

extenuates the gravity of the crime," the gravity of the

17

crime, you know, you could read that to mean, it has to

18

be a circumstance connected with the crime, not with the

19

defendant's prior life.

20

MR. BLOOM;

that polemic language that way if

Well,

But when the

I think you have to view

21

that in the context, though, of the other provisions of

22

the instruction where they talk about the individual.

23

If “A” through "J” for example had been limited to just

24

dealing with the offense itself, it’s possible the jury

25

would believe that.
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

But all the other previsions deal with the

2

offender as well as the offense, as I indicated, age,

3

mental defect, duress, things like that;

4

reason to suddenly conclude that when you get to the ”K

5

provision, that that’s only limited

6

And again, I think that —

QUESTION:

9

so there is no

to the offense.

Did the defendant’s counsel object

to the prosecutor’s argument on this point?
MR. BLOOM:

I don’t think he did, Your Honor.

10

I’m not quite sure, in all candor.

11

that the issue as I understand it is what the validity

12

of this instruction is, and not if the prosecutor may

13

have misstated --

14

QUESTION:

But again, I think

But, Mr. Bloom, on that point the

15

state court's opinion first states the instruction and

16

then it goes on to say, "The prosecutor made similar

17

arguments both during the voir dire of the jurors and

18

the close of the penalty case.

19

these admonishments" — that is, covering both the

20

instruction and the prosecutor’s argument, and then it

21

goes on and says, "defendant is correct."

22

So, it seems to me the ruling of the court

23

that we are reviewing

24

argument and the instruction.

25

Defendant contends that

MR. BLOOM:

is one that relied on both the

Well, but the question that was
15

(202) 628-9300

1

certified — we filed a petition for cert, and as I

2

understand the guestion that was certified was question

3

one of our petition which was, whether an instruction at

4

the penalty phase on these issues violates the Eighth

5

Amendment where the defendant has been permitted

6

unlimited opportunity to present mitigating evidence,

7

8

and the instruction merely advised the tryer of fact not
•
-—
to consider matters not relevant to the offense or the

9

offender.
QUESTION:

10

Well, if we adhere to that and we

11

agree that the instructions alone would not be bad but

12

combined with the argument would be bad,

13

do?

14
15
16

what would we

Would we reverse and remand to the state?
This is a capital case.

It seems to me we

want it to come out right, don't we?
NR. BLOON;

Well,

I think what happens,

17

though, is the Supreme Court of California viewed the

18

prosecutor's arguments in the context of what we would

19

construe its misunderstanding of the validity of the

20

instructions.

21

The Court historically, as all the briefs have

22

indicated, has found that giving of a sympathy

23

instruction violates the federal Constitution and

24

previous deferment indicated that it violated the state

25

Constitution, and it viewed

the prosecutor's arguments
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

in that context.

2

Now, if this Court were to adopt our position

3

and conclude that the giving of this instruction is not

4

improper in that it just tells the jury to put aside its

5

emotions and view the facts and law of the case, if the

6

Supreme Court of California would look at the

7

prosecutor's arguments in that light it might reach a

8

fully different conclusion.

9

QUESTION;

Sc, you would say, then, we would

10

remand for separate consideration of the instruction —

11

of the argument if we have a problem with that?

12

MR. BLOOM;

I would think that that would be

13

an appropriate wav to do it because anain, I think the

14

Supreme Court of California has what I believe is a

15

misunderstanding of

16

instruction mean versus concepts of mitigation.

17

what the concepts in this

These are emotions, which as I have indicated

18

the law of this Court is, really has no place in the

19

equation of determining life or death.

20

QUESTION;

Of course, part of the problem is,

21

it’s not just the instruction in this case.

22

sure of the appropriateness of it, but in one of the

23

briefs there was a listing of instructions in other

24

cases which present the same problem.

Weil,

again those cases are not

this case, and our position would be that If you are

21

going to reach the merits of the arguments to the

22

prosecutor, that they are consistent with what we are

23

saying here because at one point in his argument he

24

tells the jury, don't consider sympathy for the victims

any more than you would consider sympathy or any of

about the fact that, don’t be swayed by these emotions.

You must consider the law.

7

And then he goes through the

And of course, he makes his argument that they

8

are not to -- therers no mitigation as to these factors

9

but as to others.

10

Our point, essentially, here, is that in

11

California versus Ramos this Court indicated that within

12

reason each state nas a right to determine what factors

13

should weigh in the life or death equation.

14

in Skipper versus South Carolina, Justice Powell in his

15

concurring opinion noted the same thing, that within

16

certain reasonable standards a state has a right to

17

determine what these factors should be.

18

And again,

It is our position that when a jury is allowed

19

to consider all relevant mitigating evidence, as it is

20

in this case, there is nothing inappropriate about

21

telling jurors tD try and circumscribe their discretion

22

as much as possible and put aside these normal, human

23

emotions and give both sides a fair hearing and

24

determine the case on the law and the facts.

Again, the final line of the instruction is,

Thank you, Mr.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
In

1976 in Gregg versus Georgia this Court

noted that the admission of relevant mitigating evidence

13

under fair procedural rules is not alone sufficient to

14

guarantee that the information will be properly used in

the determination of punishment, especially if the

sentencing is performed by a jury.

17

Respondent here was allowed to put on all of

18

his mitigating evidence.

19

denied the proper use of that evidence by the

20

prosecutor’s argument and the Court's instructions.

given to the jury adequately told them that they could

than it is.

It was whether the giving of that

instruction was all right where the defendant has been

permitted unlimited opportunity to present mitigating

It talks about the sympathy instruction.
It says, "Where the defendant has been

21

here that the trial court excluded mitigating evidence

22

23

MS. KNOX;

I think that brings up the

24

issue of California versus Ramos, which the State seems

25

to be relying on very heavily.

(202) 628-9300

opinion, this Court did say that the California penal

2

code. Section 190.3, was consistent with Lockett

3

principles.

4

What penal code Section 190.3 says before it

5

gets to the list of factors that the jury is to be

6

instructed on is that the defendant should be able to

7

present evidence on any matter relevant to mitigation

8

including evidence of his character, background,

9

history, mental condition and physical condition.
That is quite consistent with Lockett.

6

that relates narrowly to the actual commission of the

nothing to do narrowly with the commission of the crime,

It seems to me, in that context it would be

uinreasonable to read "K" alone and again, leavinn aside

But, it all has to do with what he was like at

When you get to factor "K," the

If you look

at the opinion of the California Supreme Court in People

since 1983 and since the opinion in Easley, what courts

And the reason for that is,

because of what the jury is supposed to be doing at the

14

penalty phase, that it's clear from decisions of this

15

Court that what the jury does in the penalty phase is

16

not a rigid and mechanical parsing of statutory factors;

17

that it's a highly discretionary decision, it calls for

a highly subjective opinion by the jurors; that it calls

6

were to instruct the jury to disregard emotion and not

7

say anything further, yes, that would be wrong.
There are clearly some types of emotion such

8

9

as prejudice, for example, which are not supposed to

10

play a part in the jury's determination, whether at

guilt or at a penalty trial.

12

there are many amotions which validly play a part in the

jury's determination at penalty, for example,

14

retribution.

3ut it's also clear that

Retribution is the primary justification for a

17

yet it plays a proper part in the jury's determination

In

Retribution is clearly an emotion, and

QUESTION*

You know, if we were a commission

12

or a committee of the California Bar sitting down to

13

compose jury instructions, maybe we wouldn't come up

14

with this one.

15

you’ve got to show that this instruction is not just a

little bit off the mark but that it’s actually

unconstitutional, that it doesn't come within the

latitude that Pulley and Kamos sain there are for states

20

But to win your case, it seems to me

MS. KNOX;

And I think we can do that.

It

21

seems to me that the jury -- when you tell the jury that

22

they can't consider sympathy, that because we believe

23

that juries pay attention to jury instructions and they

24

follow them, the jury is going to try to make some sense

25

of what that means in the context of the decision that

Do you think we’d approve that?

Well, I think that the comments

this Court has made in cases such as Gregg versus

QUESTION;

16

Well, the state in setting up a

17

criminal system can have retribution as one of the

18

purposes of its penal system.

19

can be instructed that -- what about sympathy for the

20

victim?

21

may consider your feelings of sympathy including

22

sympathy for the 15-year old girl who was raped and

But what the State is trying to do is

21

If the jury cannot use their sympathetic response

It’s the only use their mitigating evidence

has, and if you tell the jury that they can't use it

that way, essentially what you’re doing is telling the

That’s what they’re telling -- it may be hard

MS. KNOX;

9

Yes, because to say that you put

12

you’re doing is something that is very mechanical, that

MS. KNOX;

No, I don’t think it did, but one

of the factors specifically given to the jury as

something they could consider, the age of the defendant.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, I know, but -- well,

I take it that -- wouldn't the age just provoke

Or, what would it do?
Would it help -- would it say, we ought to

how he might have committed this crime?

MS. KNOX;

What is it?

Well, I think the factor of age can

work in several different ways.

It can work as

way.

But, see, if you believe -- let's say that

12

there was a mental disturbance at the time of the crime,

13

and that's one of the things that the jury is

14

specifically told on their list of factors to consider.

15

If you believe that they will consider that as

I believe that there is a

QUESTION;

Well, io you think this instruction

forbade the jury from taking that into consideration,

saying, well, he just doesn’t deserve the death penalty,

he’s probably never going to do this again, this was one

8

of those crimes of passion that will never happen again?

9

MS. KNOX:

Yes, I believe that’s exactly what

the instruction does.

11

12

can even consider that type of evidence.

13

that they were given a more expansive standard

14

type of evidence, then I think what happens when you
