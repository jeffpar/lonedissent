ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEE

MRS. AKERSi

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Courts

10

This case presents the ouestioc , can a police

11

officer who reasonably suspects that an object in plain

12

view is stolen make a closer inspection of that item to

13

dispel or confirm his suspicion?
This question raises three issues.

14
15

all, is a Fourth

Amendment privacy interest implicated?

Secondly, is a Fourth Amendment possessory

16
17

First of

interest implicated?
And finally, if such a Fourth Amendment

18
19

interst is implicated, either in the possessory aspect

20

or in the privacy aspect, can an officer cn reasonably,

21

articulable suspicion, make a closer inspection of that

22

particular item.
The State submits that there is no possessory

23
24

interest.

There is no privacy interest.

And

25

furthermore, if this Court finds such an interest, it is
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

so de minimus that an officer may on reasonable,

2

articulable suspicion make a closer inspection of that

3

item and confirm or dispel his suspicion.

4

Here Officer Nelson, on April 18,

5

entered an apartment,

Mr. Hicks' apartment,

investigate a shooting.

1984,
tc

He entered the apartment tc look for the

7

8

assailant, his weapon, and perhaps other injured

9

parties.

They found guns, a mask, drug paraphernalia.

10

And Officer Nelson noticed, as he entered the apartment,

11

a stereo that appeared to him to be out of context with

12

the mean surroundings of the apartment.

15

other items,

It was cn

And it appeared to

the apartment.

This raised a suspicion in his mind.

He

17

suspected, having seen the other items that .indicated

18

the instrumentalities of crime, that indicated to him

19

that a crime had been committed, that perhaps this

20

stereo was stolen.

21

22

He took the serial number of the stereo down.
He called it in to the identification bureau.

23

QUESTION;

24

MRS. AKERS:

25

Where was the number?
Your Honor, the record reflects

that he couldn't recall if it was underneath the stereo

He had to move it?
He had to move the stereo in

order to ascertain the serial number; that's correct.
QUESTION:

And if it was under it, he had to

turn it upside down?
MRS. AKERS:

If it was under it, that is

correct, Your Honor, he did.
The government's position, however, is that

12

that is such a de minimus -- that inspection of a stereo

13

unit already in plain view is sc de minimus sc as net to

14

raise further privacy interests in the serial number in

15

that the only information that can be conveyed from that

16

serial number is whether or not the item is stolen.

17

And if it is stolen, then the legitimate

18

privacy interest that would

19

one that society is willing to recognize.

20

come into play there is not

Officer Nelson called in the number.

It was

23

have been stolen, and took it with thim.

He vent back to the police station, pulled the
robbery reports, ascertained that the other items that

1

he had seen there in plain view, that he had noted the

2

serial numbers on, were also stolen.

3

sworn cut and a search warrant was executed.

4

QUESTION:

An affidavit was

Suppose the government sets up a

5

monster telescope across the street from my house and

6

looked through my window to do nothing else except get

7

the stereo number off of a stereo in my room.
: Would that be all

8

MRS. AKERS:

9

right?

Your Honor, if the only

10

information that can be conveyed from that serial number

11

is whether or not the stereo or whatever the appliance

12

or item that has a serial number on it is stolen, then

13

in that respect, there is no legitimate expectation cf

14

privacy, and the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply in that

15

respect.

16

So if you can ascertain it by aided sight, as

17

you have indicated here, I mean, I think you could also

18

draw an analogy if an officer had glasses on; needed

19

glasses to inspect the serial number.

20

Once he's legitimately where he has a right tc

21

be -- and perhaps that is the threshold question that

22

ycur question raises here, is that --

23

QUESTION:

I'm assuming that they have no

24

business being in my house.

And if a telescope won't do

25

it, it's some fancy electronic technique that has

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

nothing to do with sight, but it reaches into my

2

apartment and derives the serial number of my stereo.

3

And you say that's -- that's okay, because that's not

4

very important information.
MRS. AKERS;

5

In your hypothetical, the officer

6

does not have a right to make the observation that he

7

makes.

8

observe that serial number.
QUESTION;

9

11

He doesn't have a right to be where he can

MRS. AKERS;

In that case, then, we would say

that under the Fourth Amendment -QUESTION;

12
13

much in that case;

14

number?

15

That's right.

But why?

You could say just as

What's the big deal about a serial

It's not very important.
I mean, that's the argument you were running.

16

That the search here is okay because the serial number

17

is not important.

18

And what I'm suggesting is, it doesn't matter

19

whether it's important or not, does it, for purposes of

20

whether there's been a search?

21

MRS. AKERS;

Okay, for the purposes of whether

22

or not a legitimate privacy interest has been invaded,

23

that is correct.

24

be gotten from the serial number is whether or not that

25

item is stolen; and that is it.

Because the only information that can

You couldn’t have gotten the search

3

looked at the serial number, but he bad these

suspicisicns ; he went back tc the magistrate and said, I

want a search warrant.

These things don’t look like

I think

MRS. AKERSi

Suppose the officer hadn’t

they’re stolen.

Do you

Your Honor, under these

circumstances, the test is, in Texas v. Brown, of

10

whether the facts would warrant a man of reasonable

11

caution in the belief that these items are stolen.

12

On that basis, we are very close to probable

13

cause here, but I don’t believe we had probable cause.

I’m sorry, I -Well, what the magistrate should

say is, you dcn't need one.
MRS. AKERSi

To inspect the serial number,

that's correct.
QUESTION:

Except you’d have to -- you’d say,

24

well, I have

to reenter the house.

So I want a warrant

becaue I want to get the serial number.

MRS. AKERS:

You're saying, get a search

2

warrant to get the serial from the -- the -- whatever it

3

is that's stolen?

4

In that situation, Your Honor, it*s the

5

State's position that he doesnot need a search warrant

6

to ascertain what he can ascertain when he is

7

legitimately and lawfully present.

8

QUESTION:

9

MRS. AKERS:

10

QUESTION;

Already in there.
And that was the situation.
Mrs. Akers, to the extent that

11

you're arguing there's no reasonable expectation of

12

privacy in the number, I'm not sure that that argument

13

was made below, or that it's even encompassed in the
•■

14

petition -- question on petition for certiorari.

15

it seemed to me the question presented was whether

16

police can seize the IE numbers in the course of

17

conducting a search, based on reasonable suspicion as

18

opposed to probable cause.

19

Where

And it just seems to me maybe you're making

20

some arguments here that were neither raised below nor

21

fairly encompassed in the questions.

22

MRS. AKERS:

Your Honor, it's the position of

23

the State that the Fourth Amendment application must be

24

decided first of all, because the Fourth

25

what is involved here on a reasonable, articulable

Amendment is

1

suspicion case
In this situation, in briefing that, you are

2
3

quite correct, it was not raised below.

4

was encompassed within our question presented, because

5

if there’s no Fourth Amendment applicability, then we

6

never really reach the reasonable, articulable suspicion

7

question .

8
9

QUESTION

And we felt it

Well, I thought the ouestion as it

was presented to us just assumed the application of the

10

Fourth Amendment and assumed the existence cf a search

11

and a seizure, and asked us to determine a much more

12

limited question under the plain view exception.

13

MRS. AKERS:

In reviewing the cases, and

14

especially United States v. Jacobson, we could not reach

15

that determination, and felt it best to brief the issue.

16

In United States v. Jacobson, this Court found

17

that there was a legitimate expectation of privacy in

18

the information that could be gained from testing a

19

small amount cf white powder to determine whether or net

20

it was cocaine; the only possible information that could

21

be conveyed through that test.

22

And in reading that case and comparing it to

23

the facts of this case, that is, in testing the serial

24

number, all that could be ascertained was whether or not

25

the stereo was stolen, under those circumstances we
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

could not conclude that there was a legitimate

2

expectation of privacy that society was willing to

3

recognize, ergo there was no Fourth Amendment

4

application.

5

6
7

QUESTION;

Hell, I just think that's a new

question, personally.
QUESTION;

Why do you say that the only

8

information that could have been obtained by lifting up

9

an object and looking underneath is whether it was

10

stolen or not?

11

underneath or something?

12

Couldn’t there have been a letter

For example, in your other -- the Vin case we

13

had a year or two ago, you had to pick up a piece of

14

paper to read the number.

15

And do you think it’s always true that when

16

you pick up a piece of paper or lift an object to look

17

underneath it, you’ll never discover anything except

18

what’s on the bottom of the object?

19

20
21

22
23

MRS. AKERS;

Your Honor, all we are asking

this Court -QUESTION;

Suppose you hide your jewels under

your stereo, or something like that?
MRS. AKERS;

All we are asking this Court to

24

hold is that a police officer may, on reasonable,

25

articulable suspicion, examine the exterior cf an item
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

if something is revealed in plain view by -QUESTION:

2

But you need not merely examine the

3

exterior# but he must move the item in order to make

4

that examination.

5

something, you may reveal something hidden behind it.

And I take it, when you neve

MRS. AKERS:

6

Your Honor, that’s entirely

7

possible, and that would have to be assessed under the

8

set of criteria that would be available tc the officer,

9

and if he may then examine that in plain view, if it's

10

contraband or what have you.
All we're asking this Court to hold is that we

11
12

may examine the exterior of an item to determine the

13

brand name or serial number of an item.
QUESTION:

14

What do you mean, "to determine"?

15

You're asking us to evaluate the intrusiveness of a

16

search on the basis of what happens to be found, on the

17

basis of what is being looked for and what happens to be

18

f ound .

19

But it seems to me to be the point of Justice

20

Stevens’ question that its intrusiveness does not

21

necessarily depend either upon what you’re looking for

22

or on what you in fact find; it depends on what you

23

might find.

24

There might be a private letter under there,

25

or when you lift it up, there may be something else on
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

the top of the table.
Don't you have to consider that in deciding
how intrusive this activity is?
MRS. AKERS;

I don't believe you do, Your

Honor, in the respect that you can -- if this Court
finds that you can examine the exterior of an item in
plain view for serial number or brand name, you do net
have to encompass, then -- for example, you mentioned a
letter.

The State does not advocate the position that

you can read the letter that would be found under there,
or anything else.
If, perhaps, it was contraband, then it could
be seized.

I'm not going to tell this Court that --

that if an officer sees contraband, he can't seize it.
Eut I believe that under these circumstances the
petitioner would submit that he may make that limited
inspection on reaasonable, articulable suspicion.
QUESTION;,

Supposing that the exterior of the

stereo had a little notice on it, serial number on

Could he open the

desk drawer and pick out the warranty and get the serial

MRS. AKERS:

is that you may look for the serial number cr the brand

suspicion, which I believe is a standard that the Courts

2

can employ to protect the Fourth Amendment interests of

3

an individual, where the item itself is already in plain

4

view; it has already been subject to visibility by a

5

police officer, and that's unquestioned here.

6

It's conceded that the exigent circumstances

7

that brought the officer into the apartment was such

8

that the officer could look

around him and observe the

9

items within the apartment.

And those included, as I

10

said before,

guns, masks, instrumentalities of crime.

There were incriminating objects already

present.

MRS. AKERS;

9

For the reason -- no, I am sure

10

about unplugging, and I would defend that to this

11

Court.

12

But that’s not this case.
And I would defend the -- the taking of the

13

serial number from the stereo, but the problems raised
•»

14

by the opening of the stereo unit are the same as

15

Justice Stevens has alluded to here, which is, whatever

16

you find underneath may be an additional problem.

17

And what I'm suggesting to this Court is, the

18

police are in great need of flexible standards by which

19

they may respond to those things that they see in their

20

everyday investigations.

21

QUESTION;

Well, Mrs. Akers, do you think the

22

MRS. AKERS v

QUESTION;

No, Your Honor -The trial court's finding was
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

certainly not clear to me.

2

MRS. AKERS;

3

QUESTION;

4

The trial —
And it could he interpreted that

way .
MRS. AKERS;

5

The trial court's finding, I

6

believe, was not clear; I agree with you in that

7

respect.

8

immediately apparent aspect, that is, that he could net

9

look at the object and immediately ascertain that it was

10

But it seemed to he focussed on the

stolen .

11

And in light of that, the court held that you

12

did not meet -- he did not meet, the State did not meet

13

the third prong of the Coolidge test, which

14

that the trial court employed.

15

was the test

But I submit to you that had -- the record is

16

replete with an indication by the officer that he

17

believed, he had reasonable, articulable suspicion, in

18

other words, that the object was stolen.

19

And I believe it's like a mixed question of

20

fact and law, in that respect, and that this Court may

21

review the record that is presented to you.

22

And in applying the law -- applying the law as

23

this Court finds it, may so find

that there was

24

reasonable articulable suspicion on the record we have

25

presented to you, even though the trial court focussed
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

on the immediately apparent aspect of that stereo, and

2

how the officer viewed it under that particular test.

3

Even if this Court finds --

4

QUESTION;

Let me ask one other question.

5

Would you draw a distinction if the item were not

6

thought to be stolen, but merely were conclusive

7

evidence of a crime?

8

9

instrument was used to kill

someone.

Would you apply the same test, cr is your test

No, Your Honor, I would apply the

same test to a situation such as you have described.

The ironic thing is, I believe,

19

under the status of the laws that exist, under Terry v.

20

Ohio, that an officer could stop you, that is seize your

21

person briefly and momentarily, to ascertain some

22

identification and explanation from you if he has

reasonable, articulable suspicion, or reason to suspect

24

that you and

MR. ROOD;

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

That's a great relief, because it

MR. ROOD:

15

per se unreasonable, unless there are circumstances,

16

which this Court has delineated previously, that fit the

facts of the situation.

The State contends that the plain view

doctrine is simply an exemption tc the warrant

requirement.

21

They do that in their reply brief.

My understanding is that the plain view

doctrine, according to Coolidge, merely supplements the

earlier, states that this was a seizure.

2

To take the argument to its logical

3

conclusion, police -- when police are in someone's heme

4

legitimately, they can begin a general rummaging about

the place to determine if there is stolen property, with

6

no relationship to the fact that they're in there on a

7

domestic violence call or an emergency call.

8
9
10

And all they have to say, at a later point in
court, that they were suspicious of the circumstances.
The other argument is that this search is

11

minimally intrusive.

12

first of all, I believe there is a higher degree of

13

protection in a person's home than necessarily

14

elsewhere; that it certainly isn't minimally intrusive

15

for individuals to handle personal effects.

And it would be our position that

that the major basis for the search is the

circumstances, and the circumstances presented at the

any cases that have been decided by this Court.

2

The State, in actual fact, in the court below,

3

in the trial court, never argued anything other than the

4

fact that they believed that the Leon case should apply

5

to them.
In other words, in the trial court, that was

their large argument.

was their argument, that no matter what, that this

officer had relied on a good faith belief that these

they appealed the case, that

items were stolen, and therefore, the items should not

In fact, I believe that Judge Livermore, in

his decision in the case, took care of that by saying -• •

14

well, first of all, that this wasn't a warrant case; the

15

other thing being, you can't present the fruits of an

16

illegal search, or as he put it, the police cannot

17

launder the fruits of their illegal search by having a

magistrate put some sort of stamp of approval on it.

THE PETITIONER

Thank you, Your Honor.

Just

briefly .

4

In response to questions that the respondent
/

5

received, there are some eight circumstances that appear

6

in the record that would indicate the reasonable,

7

articulable suspicion that the officer had.
First of all, there were guns that they

found.

He had

12

He had heard the name of one of the occupants

16

of the apartment as being an individual who was involved

17

in a criminal investigation.

18

There was a shooting, and indeed, an injury,

19

just shortly before the officer came into this

20

apartment; that is, more criminal activity.
