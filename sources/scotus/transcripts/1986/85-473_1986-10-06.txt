An acquisition -- if you mean

2

competitors as opposed to competition, it can indeed.

3

But an acquisition can harm competitors in any one cf a

4

number of ways.

QUESTION!

But how can it harm

7
8

Well, I know.

MR. CARRi

An acquisition can harm competition

by so significantly increasing concentration

9

QUESTION!

That what?

10

MR. CARRi

-- and raising entry barriers as to

11

make the market perform less competitively.

12

13

QUESTION;

Well, that may be so.

Eut then who

could ever sue for it besides the government?

14

MR. CARRi

In the event that an acquisition

15

had those effects, the standard effects predicted by

16

Section 7 horizontal merger analysis, consumers,

17

large-scale consumers particularly, would have an

18

interest in preventing the acquisition.

2

MR. CARR;

Well, of course.

The predator has

3

to be willing, as well as able, to deploy that dominant

4

market position in such a way as to drive rivals from

5

the market.

QUESTION:

(Inaudible) cause of action on a

competi tor?

8

9

It is an elaborate and difficult scheme --

MR. CARR;

Consumers are directly injured by

any sort of significantly increased concentration in the

10

market that gives rise to the possibility of

11

oligopolistic conduct.

But oligopolistic —

12

QUESTION:

Which is like what?

13

MR.

Raising prices, reduce supply.

14

QUESTION:

which wouldn't hurt competitors?

15

MR. CARR:

Far from it.

CARR:

Raising prices?

Any competitor, faced

16

with the possibility of diminished competition, that is,

17

an increased likelihood of oligopolistic conduct, market

18

interdependence, whether tacit or express collusion,

19

should, faced with such an acquisition, be delighted.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Carr, is there a difference in

/

21

your view between Section 7 of the Clayton Act and

22

14

MR. CARR:

The purpose of Section 7 is to

15

predict probably future impacts on market conditions.

16

As a consequence --

got a large enough segment of the industry, and then the

prices went up .

9

There was very intense competition until they

MR. CARR;

Well, what happened, as I recall,

10

under the Standard Oil case is, there was a kind of

11

competition which was of a sort that led to increased

12

concentration and a monopoly .

13

QUESTION:

Through a whole bunch of mergers.

14

MR.

Partially -- partially through

CARR:

15

mergers.

But that is not the consequence that Monfort

16

predicted here, nor is the mechanism the same.

17

On the record here, Monfort challenged the

18

acquisition solely on the ground -- as a substantive

19

antitrust — Section 7 matter, solely on the ground that

20

the acquisition would increase concentration in the

21

markets, and hence, diminish competition at seme

22

reasonably foreseeable point in the future .

23

QUESTION:

Do you think Monfort proved enough

24

to -- that if the government had brought this suit and

25

proved exactly what Monfort did, that there would have

2

MR.

CARR;

Had the government established the

facts --we, of course, believe that on the merits the

facts do not show an antitrust violation.

for the moment that they did, there would be no question

QUESTION;

The market always works?

8

MS. CARR;

I'm sorry?

9

QUESTION;

The market always works?

10

MR. CARR;

No, the point is not that the

And

11

market always works, but that the antitrust laws are

12

designed to identify only those circumstances in which

13

firms behave anticompetitively, or, through their

14

voluntary actions, increase the likelihood that the

15

markets in which they participate are likely to perform

16

anticompetitively.
And it's vitally important that the antitrust

17
18

remedy of an injunction against acquisitions-be

19

restricted to those circumstances.
These kinds of questions are extraordinarily

20

difficult to answer with any confidence at all in their

accuracy.

extreme market circumstances, would ever say that he

2

knows with complete confidence what the likely effects

3

of an acquisition would be.

4

But exactly for that reason, it's critical

5

that the plaintiff before the Court, and asking for the

6

Court’s judgment on these sorts of difficult questions,

7

assert a kind cf harm that is at least consistent with

8

the anticompetitive theory on which he’s relying to

9

establish a violation.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Carr, I take it you’re not

11

urging the position of the Solicitor General, that there

12

can never be standing for a competitor to sue?

13

you are arguing on these facts, no substantive claim of

14

anticompetitive conduct was made out?

15

MR. CARR;

Father,

As a matter of policy, as a matter

cf general principle, it may be that the rule the

Solicitor General is urging is very wise.

it, precisely because of the danger the competitors may

challenge competitive conduct.

4

Equally, in Section 7 cases, where you're

that they are going to compete so fiercely that I*m just

No.

Fierce competition is simply

IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS
MR.

COHEN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court of Appeals recognized in this case

6

that a competitor cannot legitimately object to the

7

merger of two of its rivals on the ground that the

8

merger will reduce competition and raise prices, but

9

because, the Ccurt of Appeals said, the competitor wculd

10
11

surely benefit from such a transaction.
The transaction might violation Eecticn 7, and

12

consumers or customers — here, we're talking about

13

customers like Safeway and ALP -- customers might have

14

-- would have standing to challenge a merger cn that

15

ground; but not competitors.

16

Let me answer the question that I think was

17

implicit in some of the questions addressed to Mr. Carr,

18

which is, why shouldn't we let any interested person,

19

particularly, a well informed competitor, challenge a

20

merger cn the ground that it will reduce competition?

21

First, the statute, Section 16, says that the

22

plaintiff must allege threatened less or damage.

And

23

this Court said as long age as the Borden case in

1954

24

that this must be of a sort personal to the plaintiff.

In fact, we think that the

notion of predatory pricing is, as this Court observed

of conduct on the form of predators, and so rare in

Justice Scalia, there really were

two quite contrary contentions made for purposes of

We are arguing that a competitor does not have

standing to make either sort of claim, the first because

must be alleged and proved when the change in the price

structure might occur in order to establish a

What it really boils down to is

that no private party can sue until the market is

MR. COHEN;

9

No, a private party can sue on the

10

basis of an expectation that the consequence of the

11

combination will be to reduce competition and increase

12

prices.

13

And if Safeway had thought that that would be

14

the consequence of this acquisition, they would have

15

brought suit.

16

QUESTION;

Mr. Cohen, I suppose that some

mergers might hurt competitors in nonprice ways that are

anticompetitive, like foreclosing a source of supply, or

something of that kindas.

6

Before turning to the question of standing,

7

I'd like to take just a moment to describe why this suit

Monfcrt's father had been a cattle feeder

The company went into the beef packing

court below did was to give effect to the — what

one of the basic purposes of the antitrust laws.

that is, that businesses are expected to acquire profits

say, Mr. Chief Justice.

One of the things that occurs, and that the

8

government suggests in its papers, is that somehow or

9

other allowing competitors to sue here would lead tc a

10

flurry of abusive suits.

11

the Court suggested, there really isn't anything in the

language of Section 7 that says you can draw a

distinction between permitting or a competitor or a

supplier or a consumer to bring this lawsuit.

quite agree with that.

The notion, however, that the government

11

Mr. McClearn, you have claimed

12

standing up here, although you did not below, not just

13

in your capacity as a manufacturer of boxed beef, but

14

also on the basis that Monfort is a supplier of fed

15

cattle.

16

MR.

KcCLEARN;

17

QUESTION;

That's true.

Now, as I recall, it was conceded

18

below that suppliers of fed cattle would have standing.

19

If that was so, why didn't you -- and if indeed you are

20

so clearly a supplier of fed cattle, why didn't you

21

simply say, well, we're that, too, below?

/

22

MR.

KcCLEARN;

23

Indeed, I confess, we looked at the question

3

but we didn't look very far.

4

Areeda,

5

competitors have got standing.

We looked at Professor

for example, who just said, of course

6

And I — and I have to say to you that I did

7

not, as a standing matter, regard it as a serious

8

question.
