ORAL ARGUMENT OF
TIMOTHY

A.

BAUGHMAN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. EAUGKMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court*
The constitutional issue before the Court in
this case is

whether

Respondent's right to confront the

witnesses against her was violated at her joint trial
with Benjamin Williams.

Primarily the question is

whether or not Benjamin Williams, through
of his redacted confession,

became a

the admission

witness against.

»

Respondent.
Put another

way, the question is

whether the

ordinary presumption that jurors can understand

and will

follow instructions should be put aside in this case in
favor of a presumption that

the

jurors here disregarded

two strong limiting instructions that Williams'
confession was not to be considered against Respondent.
Now, the facts very briefly put are these.
Some eight years ago,

as the culmination of a robbery,

Knighton's four year old son Koran Knighton were taken
to the basement of the Scott home to be executed.
Knighton and Ollid Scott were shot to death.

Koran

Cynthia

Knighton, though shot three times, lived and testified.
The trial was a joint trial with Eenjamin
Williams and Clarissa Marsh.

Kareem Martin remained at

large at this time, who was the third participant.
Williams had confessed and the confession was redacted
to remove all reference to Clarissa Marsh .

From the

confession as admitted, one would not know that any
other individual, any third person, was involved in any
way in this crime.
At the time of the admission of the confession
\

into evidence, the trial judge gave a limiting
instruction including a statement, to the jurors that to
consider the confession against Respondent would be most
unfair and a

violation of their oath as jurors.

He

repeated this instruction at the time of his full charge
to the jury before deliberations.
The Michigan Court of Appeals found no
confrontation violation in the admission of the
confession, relying on United States versus Hell, a case
also cited in our brief.
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, however,

The court therefore held that the jury could

not be trusted to follow the limiting instructions and

13

that, since Williams did not testify and Respondent was

14

unable tc cross-examine him as to what went cn in the

Trial by jury is perhaps the cornerstone of our

But the jurors as community fact finders must

find the facts within the context of the law as given

them by the trial judge, including instructions on such

9

things as the nature of the accusation, the burden of

10

proof, the standard of proof, and in many circumstances

11

the limited consideration that the jurors are to give to

12

certain evidence which has been admitted.
Our theory of justice relies upon the jury to

13
14

follow all of these instructions.

Because we rightly

forbid a post-trial inquiry into the character of the

focus.

19

We submit that our system of trial by jury

20

requires that the presumption that jurors are capable of

21

22

most compelling of circumstances, and that 3ruton

Standing alone, the

13

confession in this case is not incriminating of the

14

Respondent one whit.
Moreover, in Bruton this Court, as I

15
16

indicated, referred to the unreliability of

17

co-defendant*s statements due to the recognised

18

motivation to shift blame, which was an important peg of

19

this court's holding in Bruton.
For reasons largely given in part two of our

brief, I submit that in this case we have a different

situation.

Under this Court's confrontation cases -- Lee

v. Illinois is a recent one — this Court has recognized

7

that it is possible for a co-defendant's confession to

be reliable, and we submit that the confession in this

9

case was in fact reliable.

So that peg of Bruton, as

10

well as the directly incriminatory peg of Bruton, does

11

not exist in this case.
I would hasten to add that it is net my

12

argument that, while jurors are capable of following

limiting instructions in some very, very difficult

circumstances, they are incapable of putting inferences

If

we did not think they had the capacity, there would be

no need for the instruction.
This case presents a different situation, we

13

submit, from

one where the confession itself powerfully

14

incriminates the defendant.
Now, I would like to turn for a moment to your

question, Justice Stevens, about the prosecutor’s

17

argument.

18

have a further point to make regarding it.

19

Let me first address that directly and then I

The prosecutor in

this case I believe did make

20

a comment about Respondent’s testimony.

She did choose

21

to take the stand and testify that she was in the

22

vehicle with Hilliams and Martin, in the back seat, she

23

testified, with the radio on and, though there was

24

conversation going on between Williams and Martin, she

25

did not know what it was.

The Petitioner as a preface to his lengthy

1

2

argument as to how the jury could discern Respondent's

3

involvement in the crime commented on that testimony by

4

saying:

5

said them; it's in her interest to say that she did not

hear the conversation.

7

Respondent said these things, and of course she

involved in the plan, in the crime; and then proceeded,

9

with some vigor and quite a

bit of detail, to explain

10

how apart from that the jury could know that the

11

Respondent was involved.

12

She did not act surprised when Martin pulled a

13

gun in the house.

15

She took

a position of a lookout by

Mr. Baughman, on that point, it

really is pretty obvious she was involved in seme of’the

18

about that inference.

19

I don't think there's much doubt

But is there evidence that she would have

20

known about the particular statement that one of the two

21

men made to the other about, we have to take the lady

22

out, or I forget the exact language, which would

23

indicate a plan in advance to kill her?

24
25

Was there any evidence, other than perhaps her
overhearing it from the back seat, that she would have
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

known about that?
MR. BAUGHMAN;

2
3

No, there’s no other evidence

of that in this case.

4

QUESTION;

Okay.

The question that troubles

5

me about it is, do you think that particular fact might

6

have affected the degree of culpability that the jury

7

would assign to her?
MR. BAUGHMAN;

8
9

I think not, and particularly

given the nature of the charge in this case.

The charge

10

here was felony murder , which does not require either

11

the intent to kill or premeditation.

12

would amount to a second degree murder, which requires

13

malice, the intent to kill, do great bodily harm, or

14

wanton, willful disregard.
QUESTION;

15

It requires what

Well, the state didn't have to rely

16

on the confession to put the defendant in the car.

17

admitted she was there by her own testimony.
MR. BAUGHMAN;

18

That's correct.

She

Had she not,

19

there would have been no evidence that she was in the

20

car.

21

testim ony.

22
23
24
25

The linking testimony in this case is her own

QUESTION;

Well, it needs the confession to

establish what conversation had gone on in the car.
MR. BAUGHMAN;

The confession was the only

evidence of the conversation in the car and what its
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

contents were, that's correct.
QUESTION!

And if you accept her testimony at

3

face value -- and of course, it may or may net have teen

4

true -- that she was in the back seat and there was a

5

radio on, I suppose it is credible that she might not

6

have heard that particular remark.

7

8
9

HR. BAUGHMAN;

That — it is credible.

The

jury could believe that if they so chose.
QUESTION;

And if the person who made the

10

remark had been on the stand and cross-examined, he

11

might have confirmed that the radio was on and she was

12

in the back seat.

We really don't know.

13

MR. EAUGHMAN;

That's correct, we don't know.

14

But again, my point would be that,

15

particularly given the nature of the charge in this

16

case, the evidence from Cynthia Knighton as to

17

Respondent's participation in the crime was more than

18

adequate to convict her of felony murder.

19

Indeed, if it was not this case should have

20

resulted in either a directed verdict or a reversal for

21

insufficiency.

22

the confession to support this conviction, and there was

23

in this case.

24
25

There had to be evidence independent of

I would also point out that I wculd view the
prosecutor's closing argument really as a different
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

issue than the confrontation issue.

The question would

2

be whether the prosecutor may have committed

3

constitutional error in his closing argument, which he

4

could do even if the confession on its face in no way,

5

even with other evidence, implicated the Respondent.
The prosecutor could err in the use put to the

6
7

confession in his closing argument, and in that regard

8

there was no objection made to that statement by the

9

prosecutor.

It was never raised.

QUESTION:

10

Your point is that, even if there

11

were no evidence of her advance knowledge of a plan to

12

kill, as opposed to just advance knowledge of a plan to

13

rob, that she still could have been convicted of the

14

same crime?

15

MR. BAUGHMAN:

16

QUESTION*.

17

MR. BAUGHMAN;

Absolutely.

I see.
If there had never been a

18

confession in this case by anyone, Cynthia Knighton's

19

testimony would have been ample to convict her of the

20

crime.

21

Finally, I would like to take just a moment to

22

point out that it is my view that, even if the

23

presumption that jurors can and will follow instructions

24

is viewed as overcome in this case, that is not in and

25

of itself a finding that the Constitution was violated.
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

It is a finding that Benjamin Williams became a witness

2

against Respondent.
Under this Court's confrontation cases, Lee v.

3
4

Illinois being the one that

I mentioned earlier, the

5

further question remains in order to find constitutional

6

error of whether or not the uncross-examined confession

7

of Williams,

8

violated confrontation principles.

even if admitted against Respondent,

We would submit that even if the jury

9
10

considered the confession as redacted substantively,

11

disregarded the instruction, that constitutional

12

confrontation principles would not be violated because

13

the statement is reliable under this Court's cases,

14

again Lee v.

Illinois being the principal one.

The confession was devastating to Mr.

15
16

Williams.

He admitted that he was part of a

17

preconceived plan to rob the dwelling and to kill the

18

victims.

19

himself.

He was given a gun by Martin and had one

He does say that it was not himself, but

20
21

22

is corroborated by Cynthia Knighton.

23

blame-shifting; it is an accurate reporting of what went

24

on.

25

But that testimony
That is not

In large regard, the confession is

(202) 628-9300

1

corroborated

by Cynthia Knighton’s testimony.

The only

2

point in which the confession is unreliable, we believe,

3

is where Williams states that he was not present in the

4

basement when the shootings occurred.

5

inconsistent with Cynthia Knighton's testimony and we

6

believe to be that is untrue.

That is

But that attempt to curry favor on the part of

7
8

Williams in his confession in no way reduced his

9

culpability for the events,

nor did it diminish the

10

reliability of the rest of his statement, again

11

corroborated in large part by Cynthia Knighton.
So we believe this case is distinguishable

12

13

from Lee v. Illinois and that, even if Benjamin Williams

14

is viewed as a witness against Respondent, for him to be

15

a witness against Respondent through his redacted

16

confession is not a violation of the Constitution in

17

this case.

grabbed Cynthia Knighton and her child when they tried

to escape, at a time when she knew that the confederates

had drawn guns, had forced people on their knees or face

This Court

before a jury in a joint trial was through redacting

2

references to the defendant, a point picked up by the

3

American 3ar Association in

1968.

And while the Court in terms has never said

5

precisely what kinds of redactions will satisfy the rule

in Bruton, a good deal of what the Court has said ought

7

to focus trial courts and courts of appeals* attentions

8

on the appropriate standard.
Ve take as our point of departure the remarks

9
10

and the holding of the plurality in Parker against

11

12

to the premise of jury competence, that juries follow

instru ctions;

ouoht to be tied closely to its facts, and those facts

are important for the purposes of what is a sufficient

redaction, because the facts of Bruton deal with a

18

co-defendant's confession that named Bruton by name and

19

made it as clear as could be that he was a participant

20

in the crime.

21

It seems to us that when you redact a

22

confession and when you move away from the paradigm that

23

Bruton was expressly dealing with, it makes all the

24

difference in the world; and that there's increasingly

observed in Tennessee against Street, sometimes you

can't redact quite that far.

15

cases, the redactions consist of using blanks or symbols

We think the general rule should look like this;

MR. WHALEN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
The issue in this case is whether Bruton

4

versus United States applies to a redacted confession

5

that becomes powerfully incriminating when it's viewed

6

in the context of all of the evidence, even if it may

7

not be sc incriminating viewed in isolation.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION;

Well, from your point of view you

have to say viewed in the context of the evidence given
by the defendant herself in this case.
MR. WHALEN;

Actually, Mr. Chief Justice, if

12

you look at the facts of this case you'll see that

13

before the defendant Clarissa Marsh ever testified,

14

there was in fact testimony from the prosecutor's case

15

that linked Ms. Marsh to being present in the car.

16

Specifically I'm referring to Cynthia

17

Knighton's testimony that Kareem Martin and Ms. Marsh

18

entered the house together.

19

portion of Williams' confession where he says, Williams

20

says that he parked the car and then Kareem went up to

21

the house and went inside, I think that dees provide

QUESTION;

If you link that with that

leaves no question.

QUESTION:

4

True, that Ms. Marsh’s testimony
It is an ineluctable inference.
Well, it isn't just an inference;

it*s a fact.
MR. WHALEN:

5

The problem that I see is that in

6

giving that testimony she found herself in a situation

7

which I believe you alluded to, Mr. Chief Justice, in

8

Parker, which is where an inference is created prior to

9

her testimony here linking Cynthia Knighton's testimony

10

that they entered the house together to Williams’

11

statement.

12

She is unable to challenge that.

She is

13

unable to challenge the existence of this alleged

14

statement of Martin through

15

only way that she can challenge it, if at all, is to

16

waive her Fifth Amendment, take the stand, and set forth

17

herself the circumstances of what went on in the car.

So the

19

she can't go to the very heart of the question, which is

20

whether Martin even made the statement.

some question about whether he did.

22

have attacked that.

I think there’s

Certainly she could

23

The key to this case, I believe, is

24

elucidating what Bruton meant by the phrase "powerfully

25

incriminating."

It said that, the case said that the
31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

confrontation clause would be violated when a

2

co-defendant's statement was powerfully incriminating as

3

to the non-confessor.
It's our position

4

that Bruton necessarily has

5

to involve looking at the statement in context, because

6

the focus of Bruton was not whether the statement named

7

the defendant, but how much eight it added to the

8

prosecutor's case.
I believe the language was a statement is

9
10

powerfully incriminating when it adds substantial,

11

perhaps critical, weight to

12

form not subject to cross-examination.
QUESTION:

13

the prosecutor's case in a

The trouble with that is you can't

14

tell at the outset of the trial.

15

16

until the whole trial weighs out whether or not it will

The prosecutor doesn't

case,

21

for example, I think the prosecutor should have

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not talking about your

22

case for example.

I’m just saying we’re talking about

23

framing here a rule that would not allow the prosecution

24

to know beforehand whether it should put in a particular

25

confession or not, because it won't know for sure

Now, if we had a rule that says if it names

the defendant it's out, if it doesn’t name the defendant

5

it’s in, that's something you can predict beforehand.
NR. WHALEN*

6

I think superficially that looks

7

like a workable rule, but it ignores what the Sixth

8

Circuit in this case termed the true incriminating

effect of the evidence.

there is an instruction to the jury that you disregard

cautionary instructions.
First of all, the cornerstone of the
prosecutor’s case in relation to the murder charge was
that there was a preconceived and prediscussed plan to
not only rob but to kill the victims, and that this
discussion, this plan, was hatched before they ever got
over to the house.
That was his theory as to both defendants, and
arguing Clarissa Marsh's case to the jury I counted new
fewer than 13 times that he told the jury that Clarissa
Marsh was part of the plan,

that she was in on the

planning stages of the robbery and the killing.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Whalen, do you agree with your

adversary that if she merely were in on the planning of
the robbery and then there were the killings by her
co-defendants in the course of the robbery, she could
have been convicted of precisely the same offense?
MR. WHALEN;

No, I don’t agree with that.

If

she were in on the robbery -- and I believe that there
is probably sufficient evidence of, circumstantial
evidence of her participation in the robbery, but -QUESTIONi

I think there’s circumstantial

evidence of planning of the robbery.

The question is,

2

the degree of her culpability, when you get to the

3

question of -- and I’d like to point out that both she

4

and ;Williams were tried as aiders and abettors, so under

5

Michigan law it was necessary for the prosecutor to show

6

that she had knowledge of the principal’s intent, and of

7

course that knowledge is strongly shown by the -- would

8

be shown by a discussion that, yes, we’re going to have

The question really isn’t so much as to

whether there is sufficient evidence of even the felony

12

murder.

14

The question is how much weight does the --

MR. WHALENi

Yes.

The problem again being

2

that it’s a close question, as the Michigan Court of

3

Appeals termed it.

4

add the co-defendant's confession, which you can't test

5

by cross-examination, how much weight does that add?

6

And what Bruton looks to is when you

And when you get to the point where this is

7

the only direct evidence — and in fact, when-the

8

prosecutor was arguing Williams* case to the jury he, of
I
course and properly so, referred to Williams* statement

9
10

that Kareera Martin discussed the plan and said, yes,

11

this is direct evidence of intent.

12

he ever got over to the house.

13

He knew that before

So you can imagine a situation where the jury

14

in their discussions begins by discussing Benjamin

15

Williams' case and they say:

16

— he heard about the plan to kill and he knew about it;

17

the prosecutor told us, this is direct evidence.

18

19

that, discussing the statements.

20

Well, look, we have this

He

Then when they go ever to discuss Clarissa

21

Marsh’s case

— and again, she's tried on the same

22

theory, that she's part of the plan, that she was in on

23

the planning stages -- I think it's unavoidable that

24

they're going to — I think

25

that they're going to be able to put that confession out

it's unrealistic to think

1

of their mind
And really, that's the whole point of Bruton,

2
3

that there are circumstances where the evidence is so

4

powerful, adds so much to the prosecutor’s case, that

5

it's just not realistic to think, given the limitations

6

of human nature, that the jury would be able to follow

the instructions.

against Williams but, as you pointed out. Justice

She’s the one who was the access to the house

and she’s the one who most might readily be remembered

5

tend to be again circumstantial evidence that maybe it

6

was for that very reason that Bespondent would have

7

wanted

HR. WHALEN:

8
9

to have had her killed.
But I think what we have to ask,

Justice Stevens, is that what if the jury didn’t draw

10

that inference, what if they didn’t believe that.

11

that is a permissible inference.
QUESTION:

12
13

Because it is clear, is it not,

that your client was the only one who knew the victim?
HR. WHALEN-:

14
15

Yes,

That’s clear.

That’s true, she

QUESTION:

16

Mr. Whalen, let’s assume that I

17

thought that a redacted confession would, normally be

18

okay, but I felt that the comment of the prosecutor in

19

his summation undid what the redaction had achieved.

analogous to that which Justice Blackmun discussed in

acknowledge that there are circumstances where redaction

doesn’t work and where a redacted statement can become

subjected to a harmless error analysis.

out, the circumstances of the case could make it as

4

clear as pointing and shouting that the defendant was

included in the statement.

6

I think, at least tacitly, this Court has

7

recognized since Bruton that statements can become

incriminating in context.

And as long as we subject

I think we have a rule which fairly protects

the right of confrontation and at the same time doesn’t

QUESTION:

Yes, but all I’m suggesting is that

you’re saying that it’s argued on both sides different

the prosecutor’s decisions as to introducing evidence

are made at the beginning of trial.

And so it isn't a bright line rule at all.

9

It’s simply, how did everything work out, and no one

10
11

knows in advance how itr'll all work out.
NR. WHALEN:

Why couldn’t the prosecutor in

12

our case have been held to the burden of foreseeing

13

through his own testimony, through Cynthia Knighton’s

14

testimony and through the statement, that there was a

15

great risk?

16

Yes, there are some issues that, especially

17

issues that we’re subjecting to a harmless error

18

analysis, that will be looked at by an appellate court.

19

For example, sufficiency of the evidence issues are

20

continually before the courts on appeal.

21

But as long as we have — are subjecting the

22

harmless error rule -- on the one hand, I don’t think

23

we’re going to have wholesale reversals of convictions.

24

I think the problem is going to be fairly infrequent.

25

Cn the other hand, the per se rule that the Petitioner
47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

is suggesting, that you simply look at the basis of the
statement in isolation, is not workable because it
doesn’t sufficiently answer the concerns of Bruton, it
doesn’t sufficiently answer the concerns of the
confrontation clause.
Yes, let the jury decide the issue of guilt or
innocence, but let them do it fairly, let them do it in
a way that they can assess the reliability of the
evidence before them.
If we’re going to send people to prison for
the rest of their lives, ve have an obligation to make
sure that the verdicts are reliable, the process by
which those verdicts are reached is reliable.

And in

our case, I have serious questions about the reliability
of this verdict.
QUESTION;

Well, did you raise the question of

the sufficiency of the evidence in the Michigan courts?
MR. WHALEN;
QUESTION;

Yes,

I did.

And how did they rule?

MR. WHALEN;

The Michigan courts ruled against

me in that question, although they noted that it was a
