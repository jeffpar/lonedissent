HOLL, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. BOLL;

7

Mr. Hol1, you may

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court i
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to

9
10

the Third Circuit Court of Appeals/ and it involves a

11

purely legal issue of the interpretation of Federal Rule

12

of Appellate Procedure 23(c), specifically the

13

permissible factors that federal courts can take into

14

account in determining whether or not to release a

15

successful habeas petitioner pending an appeal by the

16

state.

17

Relying almost exclusively on the decision of

18

the Third Circuit in Carter against Rafferty, the Third

19

Circuit has held and the district court below have held

20

that they will only take into account the possibility of

21

flight in making this decision.

22

The State of New Jersey, Petitioner herein, is

23

arguing that there are additional factors that are

24

properly considered under 23(c), including the chances

25

of success on appeal by the state as a factor that the

Initially, I would note with respect to the

The Respondent is a party in a federal action.

There is an appeal to a federal court.

So the outcome

of that appeal is certainly an issue which the federal
courts have an interest in,

factor under 23(c) even if you accept the Carter

analysis
However, »3 don’t think that the Carter court

2

3

interpreted 23(c) properly.

We think that there are a

4

number of reasons to reject the narrow interpretation

5

that the Carter court adopted here.
The first one is, the Carter court held that

6

7

the only interest, the only factor, is a probability of

8

flight.

9

is extremely broad and which says that a petitioner is

10

presumed to be released -- it doesn’t specifically use

11

the word of presumption of release, but the state would

12

concede that the rule does contain a presumption of

13

release.

We think that the language of the rule, which

The presumption of release is there when a

14
15

petitioner is successful in district court, but it can

16

be overcome.

17

order otherwise.

He shall be released unless a court shall

In those instances -- that’s kind of broad

18
19

language right there.

20

and we don’t think there’s any reason to believe that it

21

narrowly confines the federal courts to the probability

22

of flight.

23
24
25

It’s extremely broad language,

You’re here arguing for the state,

That’s correct, Justice White.

But

it's our position that it is the rule which is most

QUESTION:

Well, why shouldn’t we really know

that for a certainty before we decide what the rule that

the federal court should apply in this case?

it’s a state interest, not a federal interest, and that

if the states wouli not -- if the state would in fact

So

MR. HOLL;

That's correct.

So the only reason he should be

me.
MR. H3LL;

Well, I think that the law of New

But aside from tiat, the federal courts -- if

you reach a -- if you take the position that the

MR. HDLL;

I think the answer is that in this

21

case and in all cases the state courts will have

22

considered the same claims that are being raised on

23

habeas and will already have made the decision that the

24

individual involved is dangerous and should be

incarcerated.

QUESTION:

14

Mr. Holl, are you suggesting that

because of the delicate relationship of the federal

MR. HOLL:

a state interest in seeing

I think that there are federal

21

interests here, there's no question about that.

There

22

are a number of federal interests, including and

I think

23

the most important one is the interest in comity between

24

there is some appropriate inquiry in the federal court
to try to preserve the status quo pending an appeal?

13

MR . ROLL:

Yes, I do.

QUESTION;

In which the court might consider

the likelihood of success on appeal and the fact that
the defendant was incarcerated, and so forth?
MR. HOLL:

11
12

Well, Mr. Roll, do you think that

interest here.

I believe that's a very important

\n important federal interest in comity

is to maintain the status juo and to take into account

14

all factors that are relevant to this decision as to

15

whether or not to stay.
There's no good reason in law or justice, and

16

the courts are required under Section 2243 of the habeas

That's a broad standard.
Dangerousness and likelihood of

success, and they find this man is very -- they think
he's very dangerous, but that he's almost sure to win on

What are they supposed to do with him?
MR. HOLL:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
Although both parties in this case invoke

7
8

federalism and comity to support their positions, their

9

views of what those phrases mean in the context of Rule

10

23 could not contrast more starkly.
The Third Circuit's opinion in Carter versus

11
12

Rafferty resolves the tension in federal-state relations

13

that is a necessary byproduct of habeas corpus

14

litigation by construing Rule 23 in light of the basic

15

interests that habeas serves, which is the vindication

16

of constitutional rights, along with the unquestioned

17

interest that any court has in seeing that parties,

18

defendants or otherwise, will be available to answer to

19

later court judgments, and by leaving other purely state

20

interests to state courts themselves to resolve under

21

state law, however it may be defined.

released on a surety unless the court otherwise orders
refers to the conditional writs and nothing more.

state simply to have a reasonable period of time to make
up its mind of what it is going to do.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor has to separate the

8

10

Even

if Your Honors rule that the federal courts have and
should have the power to stay an order of release based
on likelihood of success, the dangerousness component

11

has to be very strictly delineated from it,

because the

dangerousness to the community is a purely state

federal courts to be used as means of defying — and

Johnson, the logic of the constitutional provision in

QUESTION:

It’s not as if they have thought

there was reversible error in the rase.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

All that proves, it seems to

me, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice,

is that the state

judgment has gotten all the deference it deserves up to
the point at which a federal district court

judge, a

judge of competent jurisdiction, no matter how much the
attorney general's representatives denigrate that
judgment, that the state has been given all the
deference it deserves by having the state be the first
line of defense, if you will, for the vindication of
constitutional rights.
Once the case is properly in the federal
courts, then it is certainly within the power -- as a
matter of fact, it is the essence of the power -- of the
federal courts to disagree with the state judges and
indicate that there have been constitutional violations
that require his conviction be vitiated.
QUESTION;

But I don't think it follows from

that that New Jersey would necessarily insist that he go
free on his appeal from the federal district court
habeas to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

Jersey Constitution says what it says.

He

But the fact remains that the position they are taking

in this Court is contrary, I would say, to the position

19

of the law in New Jersey on the subject that we’re

not think that what the state court does should affect
what the federal court does, because all that proves is
that under certain situations the state can handle the
problem of its defendants any way it pleases.

Your question raises the ultimate issue in

6

this case, particularly as regards dangerousness.

The

7

fact is that there is no roving commission in either the

fedecal courts or the state courts to sweep dangerous

9

people off the streets wherever they find them.

10

Dangerousness and the determination of who shall be held

11

because they're dangerous follows the forms of the law.
The area of preventive pretrial detention or

12
13

the area of detention of unconvictad defendants,

14

whatever analogue you use, is a quintessentially state

15

concern, and Carter pays deference to that state concern

16

by allowing the states to act on this defendant, who is

17

no longer subject to conviction, in any way they please

18

as long as their decision is constitutional.
And after all, this Court has not determined

whether preventi/e detention is unconstitutional in any

appeal from going focward.

10
11
12

If the state instead, as I indicated earlier
to Justice Scalia’s question, decides that they wish to
retry this person, then as Justice Scalia indicated
earlier, by submitting the defendant once again to state
processes on retrial, they cannot hold him.
tfhat avenue is that out of their Hobson’s

choice?

The fact is that the state’s right to appeal

has ample protection in this Court, in the appellate
court,

regardless of what nappens to this defendant in

terms of his custody.

Their interests are protected in

that sense.
Allowing the defendant to be held while the
appeal goes on would do nothing more in a case like this
one, where we’ve already passed the first anniversary of
this appeal in the Third Circuit, than extinguish the
defendant's rights to an effective remedy.

And the

Since the state has presented no such interest
