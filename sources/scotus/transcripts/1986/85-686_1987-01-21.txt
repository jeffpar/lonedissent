Corporation to the federal district court based on a

2

claim that the claim arose within the original

jurisdiction of the federal court and that any claim for

4

benefits had to arise under federal law.

'6

In 1981, the District Court considered a
motion to remand filed by the plaintiff.

The plaintiff

7

at that time conceded that he sought disability salary

his motion to remand was denied.

They found that based on three reasons.

They further felt that the plaintiff had

20

limited his complaint to state law principles and thus

21

the well-pleaded complaint rule precluded removal.

22

lastly, they interpreted General Motors’ reference to

23

ERISA as raising only a defense under federal law and

24

thus interpreted the Franchise Tax Board decision of

25

this Court as precluding removal.

arising under federal law.

The Federal Removal Statute applies to

ERISA, at Section 502, authorizes a
participant to commence a civil action to recover

10

benefits due him under the plan, to enforce his rights

11

under the plan, or to clarify his rights to future

12

benefits under the plan.

13

specifically provide that such claims seeking benefit

entitlement are within the original jurisdiction of the

federal courts regardless of

and regardless of the amount in controversy.

17

QUESTION;

ERISA at 502(e)

and (f)

citizenship of the parties,

I think all of that is probably

18

conceded, Mr. Davis, and what the fight here about is

19

the conflict between the well-pleaded complaint doctrine

20

and the rules that you're talking about.

21

MR. DAVIS;

Okay, I think it's important to

22

recognize that under 502 Congress, in the legislative

23

history, specifically advised that claims seeking

24

benefit entitlement were to be considered arising under

25

the laws of the federal, of the United States in similar

Act.

3

And that ref erence is extremely import ant.
QUESTION ;

What the plaintiff has said here,

4

as I understand it , is, yes,

5

Perhaps I could ha ve brought it under federa 1 law, but

'6
7

I'm pleading th is case.

I’m bringing it an der state law.
HR, DAVI S:

Okay.

And that’s why the

8

reference to 301 i s extremely important.

9

indicated that a c laim based

on a collective ly-bargained

10

agreement under Se ction 301,

although the pi aintiff

11

attempts to rely o n state law remedies, or s tate law

12

breach of contract principles, that claim ne cessa rily

13

arises under feder al law.

14

Th is Court has

In Avco, this Court indicated that 3C1

15

actions, and Ccngr ess intended ERISA to be t reated the

16

same, are controll ed by federal substantive law that

17

arise under the Un ited States, laws of the U nited States.

18

In Franc hise Tax Board again, this Cour t

19

considered that pr emise and indicated that A vco stood

20

for the propositio n that if a federal cause of action

Section 502 of ERISA and indicated that it may well be

if a complaint attempting to rely on state law comes

within the bounds of Section

Whatever way you put it, the

argument is that state law is not put aside.
HR.

15

DAVIS:

One difference between the Labor

courts have fashioned federal remedies under section

cases ?

2
3

HR. DAVIS;

"6

That would be my

position.

4

5

That’s right.

It’s clear that Congress, in enacting ERISA
remedies in Section 502, and claims procedures in
Section 503, intended that those provisions be exclusive

7

and preempt state law.

8

statutory language of ERISA as well as the legislative

9

history under EPISA.

This can be demonstrated by the

10

Congress recognized that federal governance of

11

a growing body of employee benefit plans that implicated

12

as participants the vast majority of citizens of this

13

country, they declared the policy to be to protect

14

participants by establishing standards of conduct,

15

responsibility and obligations for fiduciaries of

16

employee benefit plans, and by providing appropriate

17

remedies, sanctions and ready access to the federal

18

courts.

22

QUESTION;

Hell, Mr. Davis, you heard the last

case argued, did you not?
'

MR. DAVIS;
QUESTION:

Yes.
Supposing that in deciding that

23

case this Court were to decide either 5-to-4 that it was

24

preempted, or 5-to-4 that it wasn’t preempted; does that

25

mean that the defend ant in the last case, had it been

MR. DAVIS:

2

Yes, it does.

It means that the

express grant of federal jurisdiction.

I’m focusing more so on Section 503 and 502 as an

QUESTION:

'6

You're saying that no matter how

7

debateable the preemption point may be, if it ultimately

8

turns out to be preempted then removal was proper?

9

MR. DAVIS:

That's right.

I would refer to

10

the Merrill Dodd decision v.

Thompson, recently decided

11

by this Court, where you considered whether a private

12

remedy existed in a federal statute.

13

split, the majority rejecting removal because of the

14

absence of a federal remedy in the statute.

That was a 5-4

The dissent nevertheless explained the

15

16

rationale of the Court in advising if the FDCA had a

17

federal remedy in it, then removal would have been

18

proper even if the plaintiff —
QUESTION:

19
20

Well, you can't always rely on the

dissent to explain the rationale of the majority.

MR. DAVIS:

I understand.

But in this

23

particular case the dissent was summarized in the

majority.

In

ERISA we have that private federal remedy.
So I think Congress clearly intended to

regulate the remedies under ERISA and preclude states

from doing the same.

And it's evident by 502, and it’s

QUESTION:

So that any action trying to

collect a claim is a federal claim?

8

MR. DAVISi

9

QUESTION:

That’s right.

That’s my position.

Of course, you would argue that

10

there was original jurisdiction even if there wasn’t a

11

federal claim and it was just a state claim.

12

MR.

DAVISt

I would argue no matter how the

13

complaint was written, if it was one seeking benefits

14

under the plan then it arises under the federal law and

15

it’s a federal claim.

16

QUESTION:

What if

it doesn’t arise under

17

federal law?

18

under federal law there’s no jurisdiction in the federal

19

district court?

20
21

MR.

You acknowledge that if it doesn’t arise

You’re really saying the

when on its face the state claim is frivolous.

it’s frivolous to claim that it’s a state claim.

That’s right.

I mean,

I

think this Court recognized that in Franchise Tax Court

2

and in Avco, and the same si tuation exists here.

3

When that happens,

the well-pleaded complaint

4

rule doesn't preclude the Co urt from looking behind the

complaint to determine the t rue character of the cause

In this case, it *s a federal cause of

action.

8

legislative history under ER ISA .

9

I think also that i s very clear from the

In reviewing the 1 agislative history it's

10

apparent Senator Harrison Wi lliams stressed that the

11

substantive and enforcement provisions of ERISA are

12

intended to preempt the fiel d for federal regulation,

13

thus eliminating the threat of conflicting and

14

inconsistent state and local regulation of employee

15

benefit plans ,

16

Congressman John D ent made note cf what to

17

many is the crowning achieve ment of the legislation, the

18

reservations of federal auth ority of the sole power to

19

regulate the field of employ ee benefit plans.

20

the Conference Committee ref erred to actions for claims

under Section

23

States in similar fashion to labor laws.

Senator Javits, on e of the two principal
Senate sponsors, in presenti ng the Conference Committee

report indicated that it was also intended that a

2

federal substantive law be developed by the courts to

3

deal with issues involving rights and obligations under

4

private welfare and pension plans.

5

'6

Allowing the plaintiff to pursue state
remedies would undercut these congressional goals.

7

These goals were recognized by this Court in Alessi v.

8

Raybestos-Manhattan and Shaw v. Delta Airlines where

9

state statutes were held preempted and the benefit plan

10

regulation was declared to be an area of exclusively

11

federal concern.

12

This Court noted that Congress minimized the

13

need for interstate employers to administer their plans

14

differently in each state in

15

And participants, if state remedies survive, will be

16

able to avoid the carefully designed claims procedures

17

mandated by ERISA for all plans, both insured and

18

self-insured.

which they have employees.

19

This Court, in Allis Chalmers v. Lueck, held

20

that a state tort claim for breach of the duty of good

21

faith was preempted by federal labor law.

22

this Court noted that the most harmful aspect of the

23

Wisconsin decision rejecting preemption was that it

24

would allow essentially the same suit to be brought in

25

state court without first exhausting the grievance

Importantly,

procedures established in the bargaining agreement.
That same undesirable result would be here as

3

well if the plaintiffs were allowed to avoid these

4

federal remedies and federal claims procedures and

5

proceed directly to state court under state claims.

'’6

Additionally, exhausting of the state remedies

7

of the claims procedures and

8

have the tendency of providing the participant with a

9

reasoned knowledge of why his claim was denied and would

the remedies in ERISA would

10

have a tendency to reduce litigation rather than

11

encourage it.

12

The claims procedures and remedies set forth

13

in ERISA would be rendered ineffectual for the vast

14

majority o.f plans if plaintiffs were allowed to pursue

15

state remedies.

16

Justice O’Connor, the figures you cited were correct --

17

I would say about 90 percent of the welfare plans are

18

insured and administered by insurance companies.

As the Solicitor General noted — and.

\

19

Allowing different remedies for insured versus

20

self-insured plans would act to lessen the protection

21

for participants because employers would tend to move

22

toward self-insured plans.

23

United States in its amicus brief filed in Pilot Life,

24

the case preceding, noted that Congress intends the

25

remedies provided under Section 502 to be exclusive.

Not surprising that the

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The government recognized that Congress had

2

established a detailed enforcement scheme,

3

made clear that federal lav applies and that federal

4

common law was to be developed, that Congress declared

5

that all actions arise in similar fashion as those under

'6

the Labor law# and, further,

that Congress

that the legislative

7

history under

502 failed to mention, or even

8

contemplate, that participants could pursue alternative

9

state remedies .
The government felt that was important because

10
11

had such been the intent it surely would have been

12

mentioned.

13

preemption of state law.

14

supersedes any and all state laws that may relate to a.n

15

employee benefit plan.

16

Congress enacted Section 514 as an express
No doubt Section 514

And further, Section 514 provided for an

17

insurance savings clause preserving the state’s ability

18

to regulate the business of insurance.

19

the deemer clause limited the exception so that state

20

laws would not be applied directly to the plans, not be

21

applied directly in areas where ERISA comprehensively

22

regulated the plans.

23

Nevertheless,

The Metropolitan v. Massachusetts case is not

24

to the contrary.

In that particular case a

25

Massachusetts-mandated benefit law survived preemption.
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

That was an area under ERISA that was not regulated.

2

ERISA does not regulate the content of a welfare benefit

plan.

provide direct regulation of the plan? it only provided

5

regulation of an insurance company in the type of policy

'6

That was a — that was a result that did not

7

In this case, ERISA comprehensively regulates

8

remedies available to participants.

9

comprehensively, if state remedies survive that would be

ERISA

10

state law acting directly on the plan, not on any

11

insurance company, directly on the plan and its claims

13

than that in the Metropolitan case.

14

That result was far different

Lastly, Taylor's complaint contains a claim

15

for an uninsured or self-insured benefit, that being the

16

salary continuation benefit.

17

not governed at all, no relevance to the insurance

18

savings clause under Section

19

that's self-insured and self-funded, independent.

20

claim alone would support removal and along with the

21

removal of that claim would come the rest of the

22

complaint.

23

That's a benefit that's

In Avco an employer brought a

Well no, the preemption issue is,

On the preemption

What was unclear, and there was a split between the

question of whether or not, because of the limitation on

remedies, the federal court could actually take the case.

12

QUESTION;

13

SR. SCHEER;

I see.
And the obviousness test

14

subscribed to by the Court of Appeals below in our case,

15

as we are urging here is one that focuses on preemption.

16

The question is, is preemption obvious at the

17

time the law suit is filed?

18

derives from the well-pleaded complaint doctrine.

19

the well-pleaded complaint doctrine a plaintiff has the

power of choice.

by means of that choice select his forum.

and, in so doing, preclude removal of his case from

2

federal court.

3

Now this power of choice guaranteed by the

4

well-pleaded complaint doctrine is subject to a very

5

narrow exception and the narrow exception is that the

6

courts will not honor the plaintiff’s choice of law if

7

it is patently unreasonable,

8

art in removal cases, if the plaintiff has engaged in a

9

fraud on the court, or has engaged in artful pleading.

10

QUESTION;

or to use the legal term of

So, whenever we have a removal case

11

such as this,

where the issue comes up, the case comes

12

all the way up to the Supreme Court and really the only

13

thing we can determine is whether it is obvious that

14

there was preemption and we shouldn’t get any further

15

because that’s as far as we have to go.

16

If it was not obvious, even though there is

17

preemption, we have to say, well, that’s for the next

18

case -- right? -- and we send it back down and it goes

19

back to state court and the state court finds, yes,

20

there is preemption, and then it comes up to us on cert

21

and then we can say, yes, there is preemption.

22

MR. SCHEER;

23

QUESTION;

That is correct.
That's a really strange way to run

24

a system, don’t you think?

Why can’t we say the first

25

time whether it is or is not preemption?

QUESTION:

5

MR.

I see.

SCHEERi

It has been stated here again and

"6

again this morning that Congress intended Section 502

7

remedies to be exclusive and that any state law claim

8

that might possibly fall within their sphere, like a

9

breach of contract action against an insurance company,

10

is simply because it falls within the scope of Section

11

502 preempted.

12

It*s worthwhile, I think, to step back for a

13

moment and consider what the, what is essentially at

14

stake here.

15

possibility of remedies under state law, punitive

16

damages, extra contractual relief and so forth that

17

would be excessive, harmful to the insurance industry.

18

There has been talk here about the

There have been arguments about disuniformity

19

created by state tort systems and state breach of

20

contract claims co-existing with remedies under Section

21

502.

22

under Section 502 a claim for benefits is subject to the

23

highly deferential, arbitrary and capricious standard.

24
25

But the real, what is really at issue here is that

That is a standard review in federal court in

feels so strongly about Section 502 exclusivity.

case.

But Congress had good reason not to make that

7

Section 502 remedy and the deferential standard that

8

goes with it exclusively applicable precluding state

9

remedies in cases against insurance companies.

10

knd it’s

simply this, insurance companies are interested parties.

11

It may be one thing for Congress to make 502

12

remedies exclusively for suing a neutral trustee, or a

13

neutral plan administrator, but when you’re suing an

14

insurance company, the insurance company is a

15

contracting party.

16

for breach of contract does it make any sense to defer

17

to one party of a two party contract and its

18

interpretation of the contract language?

19

If you’re suing an insurance company

I think it does not and that is why Congress

20

meant to permit de novo judicial review under state

21

breach of contract principles of the meaning and

22

interpretation of an insurance policy.

Scalia.

SCHEER;

No, I

would disagree, Justice

I mean, when a company is self-insured it is

7

concerned about continuing good relations with its

8

employees.

9

When a company is self-insured its plan very

10

frequently is a result of a collective bargaining

11

agreement, arm’s length negotiation between a union and

12

the company.

Well, I

mean there may be some

differences but don’t tell me that it's not a
self-interested party that you're allowing to adjudicate
the rights under this contract.

17

MR.

SCHEER;

I think it is a party that is

certainly less directly Interested in the outcome of a

19

particular benefit claim case than is an insurance

company.

MR.

SCHEER;

None of those things,

In Section 502 of ERISA Congress

20

intended to provide minimum remedies.

21

to provide all-inclusive remedies to regulate, to

22

legislative comprehensively in the field so far as

23

claims against insurance companies are concerned.

24
25

It did not intend

There's nothing in the legislative history,
obviously nothing in the language of the statute to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

suggest that Congress meant to deprive a policyholder of

2

the pre-existing body of state law protections simply

3

because that policy holder was a participant in ERISA

4

plan.

5

'6

Conversely, there's nothing in the legislative
history to suggest that Congress meant to immunize

7

insurance companies from the vast body of pre-existing

8

state insurance regulation simply because the insurance

9

company was insuring an ERIS A-regulated plan.

What 502

10

does is simply provide additional supplemental remedies,

11

remedies that supplement the state law.

12

Congress, when it was enacting ERISA, had had

13

no experience whatever in regulating insurance.

14

the McCarran-Ferguson Act that had been the exclusive

15

domain of the states for many decades.

16

wanted to do here was to defer to that expertise, to

17

leave those state remedies intact, and at the same time

18

provide Section 502 remedies which would be minimal

19

remedies, advantageous in many instances particularly

20

for small claims, but would not be exclusive, would not

21

be the only remedies available.

22

under state law, one could pursue a remedy under state

23

law.

HR. SCHEER;

SCHEER;

That may be in some

circumstances.

It may not be in others.

It does waive jurisdictional amount

2
3

requirements which might apply in some state courts.

4

And for small claimants suing insurance companies, it

5

makes sense frequently to use Section 502.

"6

But it makes

no sense to think that Congress wanted to preclude de

7

novo judicial review under state breach of contract law

8

of the meaning of a clause of an insurance policy

9

drafted by an

insurer, and to force plaintiffs to go to

10

federal court and to have that issue subjected to an

11

arbitrary and capricious attack.

12

QUESTION;

Hr. Scheer, are these clauses

13

typically drafted by the insurance companies, or are

14

they typically the product of a union management

15

negotiation as to just what the benefits will be and the

16

conditions of eligibility and all the rest?

17

a group interest rather than an individual claimant

18

here?

19

MR. SCHEER;

Isn't there

It is my understanding that in

20

the vast majority of cases, not necessarily the plans

21

covering the vast majority of employees who are subject

22

to ERISA, but in the vast majority of individual plans

23

the insurance company has a policy and it drafts the

24

policy and it sells it to the employer.

want, to continue to do business with this particular
insurer.

So you do have some built in protections here.
MR.

SCHEER:

Well you have some built-in

protection, but I should also point out that ERISA

10

permits a fiduciary to delegate his fiduciary

11

responsibility to an insurance company.

12

It

And in the vast majority of these small ERISA

13

plans it is my understanding, simply having talked to

14

lawyers who practice ERISA full-time, that that

15

delegation takes place such that the only party you can

16

sue under Section 502'is the insurance company.

17

You don’t have available to you the

18

opportunity to sue someone who might be more neutral --

19

QUESTION:

If the insurance company

habitually was slow paying because it wanted to, you

MR.

SCHEER;

Obviously market forces, you

point an insurance company's intransigence in dealing

with claimants with bona fide claims would certainly,

one could see that it would be to termination of that

relationship.

QUESTION;

MR.

9

Yes.

SCHEER;

Eut'the mere fact that, you know,

the marketplace is at work doesn't.--

10

QUESTION s

What we started with was the

11

question of the drafting of the — in this particular

12

case, was the General Motors* plan drafted by

13

Metropolitan or was it drafted by the company and the

14

union?

15
16
17

MR. SCHEER;

That I don't know.

The record

does not make that clear.
QUESTION;

Why would the Congress want to save

18

these important state rights only in the case of

19

insurance companies and not where you have a

20

self-insurer ?

21

MR.

SCHEER;

Well,

I think again, I'm not sure

22

that Congress first of all necessarily focused on all of

23

the possible permutations of plan arrangements that

24

might exist under ERISA.

25

certainly on their minds because of the

But one category that was

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

McCarran-Ferguson Act was the insurance industry.
And in £he insurance industry I think Congress

2
3

could well understand that it would be dangerous and

4

perhaps reckless to restrict claimants under Section 502

5

for benefits for breach of a contract to the

'6
7

determination of the insurer subject only to an
arbitrary and capricious standard of review.
QUESTION;

8
9
10

Mr. Scheer, aren’t we dealing here

with a self-insurer, in effect, who just uses the
insurance company as an administrator?

11

MR. SCHEER:

No, Justice O’Connor, that is not

12

correct in this case.

13

insured by the insurance company save one, according to

14

petitioners, and that is the separate claim regarding

15

salary continuation benefits.

All of the benefits here are

They say that because that is not an insured

16
17

plan the savings clause for insurance does not apply.

18

The short answer to that, Justice O’Connor, is that the

19

argument was not made below in the Sixth Circuit and so

20

i.t should not be made here.
A somewhat longer answer, a different answer

21

22

is if the Court wishes to consider what matters there is

23

that the claim was nonetheless made against an insurance

24

company.

25

power to pay the benefit that was sought gees to the

Whether or not the insurance company had the

merits of the contract claim

2

But the fact is that it was a claim against

3

the insurance company and to that extent was fully

4

subject to the ERISA savings clause.

5

"6

Now, there’s been reference again and again
under the savings clause to this alleged distinction

7

between laws of general applicability and laws or

8

statutes or regulations of a state that are more

9

specifically focused on the insurance industry.

10

The distinction cannot withstand scrutiny

11

under ERISA for several reasons.

12

contrary to the law of the statute.

13

law for purposes of the savings clause, as well as the

14

basic preemption provisions,

15

the courts of appeals have been absolutely uniform in

interpreting the word, "decisions" to mean common law

17

actions for breach of contract, for tort and the like.

Under ERISA it is important that it was
