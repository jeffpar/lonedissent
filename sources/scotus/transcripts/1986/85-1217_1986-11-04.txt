Suppose a municipality is running a jail, and it just

Now there's no written policy that says, it’s

that you need food there.

Would that be a policy?

not?

MR. PIKULA:

I don’t believe so, no.

It vculd

certainly be a violation of Massachusetts state law.

QUESTION:

But it

would be -- it would be

unconstitutional if they, in addition to that, said,

ahead and shoot to kill.

MR. PIKULA:

10

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Then it would be bad .

They have to

give an affirmative instruction to do something wrong?

12

MR. PIKULA:

Or an instruction such as was in

13

14

certainly intended that deadly force be used against a

15

nondangerous felon, even though they didn’t go out and

16

say, shoot every nondangerous fleeing felon, that

17

conducted was permitted by the statute in that case.

where --

You're saying that anybody who

took no step to stop it would be so grossly

negligent that you can attribute almost willful
permission from it?
MR.

PIKULA:

Well, in any case, before

anything could be attributed to a policymaker, some
conscious decision on the part of a policymaker needs to
be shown.
Without that, it would just be liability based
on respondeat superior.
QUESTION;

What if the only decision was not

to fire any of these officers?

A, not to fire them; and

B, not to give them any more training?

And then they still don't train.

Would that failure to train be an
unconstitutional policy?
MR. PIKULA:

I don't believe so.

If there was

13

a prior pattern of misconduct -- if this Court does not

14

choose to impose-a standard of requiring an

15

unconstitutional policy, if there's a prior pattern of

16

misconduct, at least you could infer some kncwledqe cn

19

that they had an

In this case, we have simply a single incident

20

which occurred very -- during a very short period of

21

time; it did not provide any opportunity for

22

policymakers to respond or prevent.

6

But once that's been happening, it's very

MR. FIKULA:

Well, gross negligence is an

7

insufficient standard for liability, because it does not

involve any cognitive element which is necessary to shew

9

any state of mind on the part of policymakers.

10

QUESTION;

Well, I'm not sure I agree with

11

you.

12

negligence is, negligence that approaches such a point

13

that you almost have to intend the result in order not

14

to have done something to stop it.

15

It seems to me that’s precisely what gross

MR. FIKULA:

The violation of the due process

16

clause has historically involved deliberate or conscious

17

decisions rather than a lack of due care.

18

care has not historically been the type of conduct which

19

is implicated in the Fourteenth Amendment.

Amendment was designed to prevent.

MR. FIKULA;

Only if that training policy

intends conduct which violates the Constitution, or

permits conduct which violates the Constitution?

inadequate, it’s going to permit conduct which would

difficult to follow.

20

MR. FIKULA*

Not necessarily.
Doesn’t it go to fault rather than
I find your argument

I believe that the issue of fault

21

on the part of the city is shown when you show that

22

policymakers have made some sort of conscious decision,

23

or acted deliberately, rather than inferring that they

24

have done something without any evidence to show

25

policymakers have acted at all.

One shot’s okay, but don’t do it twice.
FIKULA:

No.

It's certainly -- if one

shot was fired pursuant to an unconstitutional policy,
that would be sufficient to impose liability.
On the other hand, if all we have is one shot
that's fired, it’s really uncertain whether or not that
shot was fired pursuant to any policy to violate the
Constitution, rather than just the conduct of — or
misconduct of an employee.

to march.

That's all they're trained.
And then they just turn them loose in the

city.

Don't tell them how to serve search warrants, how

to arrest people, how to stop vehicles, or anything.
They just train them to the extent I described.

And

then there are a lot of mistakes made thereafter.
Would there be a constitutional violation or
not?
MB. FIKULA:
QUESTIONi

I don't believe so.
(Inaudible) I'm not sure what you

can say about it except that it happened.

The

instruction at trial specifically said that the jury
could find liability if the city had failed to train,
supervise or discipline, and if that failure is reckless
or grossly negligent.
And the city did net object to that.

In fact,

the city itself asked for an instruction which included
the statement that the plaintiff has the burden of
proving the city was not merely negligent in its
training, but grossly negligent in failing to train its
police officers.
And now you're arguing before us,

although you

asked for that instruction, that that is not enough.
Now why should ve hear this at this point ?

Did you challenge this point before

One of the points was that

negligent training wouldn't be enough.

QUESTION;

And what about at the Court of

14

MR. FIKULA;

At the Court of Appeals, it was

15

not specifically laid out in our brief that way,

16

although we did ask for some higher standard of

17

culpability.

18

as I said, we were kind of unsure what the standard

19

should be.

20
21

And we were searching for a standard.

And then I think this decision in

Now —

23

QUESTION;

25

-- the

Court's decision in Tuttle clarified that.

22

24

And

May I ask this before you proceed?

What evidence was there of gross negligence?
MR. FIKULA;

None whatsoever.

There was no

standa rds.
QUESTIONS

If there was no evidence, why was

the instruction not objected to?
MR. FIKULA:

“Well, again, once the trial judge

had denied my motion for a directed verdict, some jury
instruction did have to be put forward, and therefore -QUESTION:

And then -- how would you object to

requested it and your request was granted?

MR. FIKULA:
QUESTION:

I —
How did your motion for a directed

verdict put it in issue.
MR. PIKULA:

The first point -- our first

point -- our first point in

cur motion for a directed

verdict was that there was no proof of an
unconstitutional policy.
Our second point had to do with, there’s no
evidence of negligent training.

be insufficient.

that’s specifically what it was.

MR. NAGEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case the City of Springfield is asking

19

the Court to reverse a modest jury verdict in favor of

20

Clinton Thurston who was shot, beaten, and then denied

21

medical care, and died in Springfield.

22

The scope of this review is necessarily

23

somewhat limited narrowly by the Seventh Amendment and

24

Rule 51, and

25

that you brought up in the questions to Mr. Pikula

I'd like to clarify a few of the points

regarding exactly what was preserved for review in this

case.

Regarding gross negligence in particular, that

4

issue, in our view, is completely waived in this case.

5

There was no objection to the instruction regarding

gross negligence.

HR. NAGEL:

Yes.

MR. NAGEL:

And as far as

inadequate training, I think we’re on a different

footing than the gross negligence question.

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe you asked that

There were two theories of liability in this

6

theories .

7

This is not the Tuttle case.

There were two

that there was failure to train amounting to gross

QUESTION:

And what was the unconstitutional

policy in this hypothesis?
MR. NAGEL;

Both courts below — Chief Judge

14

Frank Freedman of the Massachusetts District, and the

15

Court of Appeals — found that there was evidence

16

sufficient to warrant a finding that it was a policy of

17

the Springfield police force to allow the use of deadly

18

force at the first moment at the first moment at which

19

it was technically -- appeared technically permissible

to do so under the rules.

which indicated that the police had operated under a
rule which allowed them to create a danger, or create
the appearance of an attack, and then use deadly force.

three shootings, and two 'beatings in this case -- but

And there was plenty of evidence

from which you could have found -- or with the jury, I
should say, because that is who we're concerned with —
the jury could have found that Mr. Thurston was driving
along at a legal speed straight down the road, and the
motorcycle came up next to him and shot him in the head
because he wouldn 't stop.
And there's a uolice rule which appears on its
face to allow that, a rule that is completely at odds
with Garner,

which would be rule 2813, which says that

can shoot a dangerous felon fleeing, or a felon; you can
shoot a nondangerous fleeing felon on the face of this
rule.

And your claim is that your client,

MR. NAGEL;

seconds when he came over the hill.

the hill, there was a policeman standing in the road in

And that was

a colorable attack.

MR. NAGEL:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

2

result of that failure to train, it doesn't make a bit

of difference.

4

MR. NAGEL:

That's true.

And there is

5

testimony in this case that the officers were not

6

trained at all with regard to shooting at fleeing

7

vehicles.

8

9

There's testimony directly on that point,
which takes us right outside of Tuttle.

I mean, Tuttle

10

-- the only thing in Tuttle, because of the defective

the training question, whether training can ever be a

2

would submit to the Court that in that direction lies

even more confusion than we need to engage in.

I don’t think there's

And what Mr. Pikula said regarding the
question -- I believe it was from Mr. Marshall, from Mr.

10

Justice Marshall, and Justice Stevens alsc asked,

11

regarding the effect of no training.

12

to the effect that the inquiry seems to collapse into

13

one of causation.

And his answer was

14

In other words, if there's no training at all,

15

and it causes a constitutional violation, then why do we

16

need to bifurcate the inquiry into whether the policy

17

itself is unccnstituticnal or the resulting activity of

18

the police is unconstitutional, when the statute itself,

19

as interpreted by Monell, says that if A causes B to

20

inflict a tort on C, then B’s tort becomes A's tort.

21

I mean, that language is right in Monell, and

22

it comes right from the statute, which says that any

23

person who causes -- who subjects or causes to be

24

subjected to a constitutional violation.

25

3

MR. NAGEL;

No, I don’t believe it would.

I

4

think that a better traditional category cf tort law to

look to is agency law, which --

QUESTION;

Well, that's where the idea of

It may come from the great body of

There’s no reason to treat them as anything

As to the question of gross negligence, while

we’re on the subject of the language of the statute and

negligent construction of a building from negligent

MR. NAGEL;

If the Court is going to impose gross

The — there is also statutory history in the

of the amicus curiae, regarding the fact that this

15

Again, language of simple negligence.

So there’s really no reason to go beyond a
gross negligence standard.

16

Finally, I would just like to come back again

17

to the Tuttle issue, or the Tuttle nonissue in this

18

case.

19

that the single incident of outrageous brutality on the

20

part of the police officers was not a logical basis cn

21

which an inference of failure to train could be drawn,

that single thing -- that single shooting, because you

could just as easily infer that the man who did the

Now, there were some questions about, whether

21

no training at all can be a basis for liability.

22

Obviously, the unleashing of the police officers on the

23

city, having them be armed,

24

with rules that tell them they can shoot nondangerous

25

fleeing felons, is foreseeably going to cause this kind

Could I ask, do you believe that if

some member of the community or some organization

interested in law enforcement thought that the city had

an inadequate training program or one that evidenced

deliberate indifference or gross negligence could just
