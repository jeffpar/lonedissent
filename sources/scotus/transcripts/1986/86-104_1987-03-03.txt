Mr.

Chief Justice, and

may it

please the Court:

QUESTIONi

1

2

question or two?
There was a resolution passed by the airport

3
4

board, whatever it’s called.
MR.

5

6

KAPEL;

Yes, the Board of Airport

Commissioners.
QUESTION;

7

8

Mr. Kapel, may I ask a preliminary

Was that resolution .binding without

city council approval?
MR.

9

KAPEL;

It is binding without city council

10

approval.

11

associated with it without the city council approval.

12

So it is a rule —

13
14
15

It does not have a criminal penalty

QUESTION;

Has the city council ever approved

it in fact?
MR.

KAPEL;

No, it has not been presented to

16

the city council. The Board of Airport Commissioners has

17

the power and ability to adopt rules and regulations

18

regarding the use of the airport.

19

They cannot adopt criminal penalties.

20

QUESTION;

And in another preliminary inquiry,

21

would the airport be a public forum under California

22

constitutional law?

23

MR.

KAPEL;

No, I don't believe so.

Under

24

California constitutional law, I believe it tracks very

25

.closely the federal law in this case.

There are some distinctions

2

QUESTION:

3

How about the Hoffman case making a

railroad terminal a public forum?

MB. KAPEL:

In that case there was no

5

indication that the owner of the property ever attempted

6

to restrict the uses of the terminal facilities.

In addition, as a --

Yes, it was argued.

Neither court

addressed those issues.

12

QUESTION:

Thank you.

13

QUESTION;

Say I ask a question before you

14

proceed, Sr. Kapel?
Has this ordinance ever been enforced against

15
16

anyone?

17

MB.

KAPEL:

18

QUESTION;

19

KB.

Yes.
Specifically?

KAPEL:

Yes.

It has been enforced from

20

the standpoint that police officers have informed people

21

and requested people to leave, and people have left.

22
23
24
25

The police officers have escorted people out
of the buildings and onto the sidewalks.
QUESTION;

When people have not left, have

.they been prosecuted?

They have not been prosecuted.

however until the constitutionality was

8

QUESTION;

9

MR.

KAPEL:

QUESTION:

10

\

So this is a facial challenge?
Yes, it is.
That means, I take it, that if we

11

disagree with

you that it is a public — if we disagree

12

with you that

it's a public forum, what result should

13

accrue?
MR.

14

KAPEL:

I believe that the d etermin ative

issue is the public forum issue.

15

QUESTION:

16

Suppose we're worried about the

allegations of unequal enforcement of it?

17
18

MR.

KAPEL:

19

QUESTION:

Excuse me, I'm sorry?
Suppose we're worried about the

20

allegations of unequal enforcement, the Christian

21

Science reading room, for example, and the advertisement

22

about environmental matters that are alleged to have

23

been in the airport.
That issue is not before us?

24
25

,

MR.

KAPEL:

I don't believe that issue is
6
AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

before you, because I believe both of those matters are

2

airport-related matters, or matters the Board could

3

determine were airport related.

4

The Christian Science reading room sounds very

5

bad.

However, the issue with regard to our resolution

6

is not the name of the tenant, but the purpose or the

7

activity they're conducting within the terminal

8

buildings.
If the Christian Science reading room were

9

10

merely a religious activity and did not provide an

11

airport related activity, it

would not be permitted.

If United Airlines wished to conduct a

12

non-airport-related activity, it would not be permitted.

13

QUESTION:

14

What I'm asking is, do we have to

15

reach that?

Suppose we find, as you want us to find,

16

that this is not -- that this is not a public forum, but

17

suppose we're also concerned that the rules against

18

First Amendment activity have not been applied

19

even-handedly.

20

What should our disposition be?

21

MR. KAPEL:

If you

find that there has been

22

viewpoint discrimination, where the Board has picked

23

improperly and decided that an activity is airport

24

related when it fact it isn't, then I believe our

25

»

resolution should not be enforced until we remedied that

HR. KAPELt

5

QUESTION:

6

And we can make that determination

Yes, I

believe you can.

Did the

lower court base its

decision in part on that?
HR.

7

KAPELi

No.

The lower district court

8

found that the airport terminal facilities were public

9

forums.

10

They did not specifically indicate traditional

or otherwise.

The Ninth Circuit --

13

Ninth Circuit did the same7
MR.

14
15

So we wouldn't have to -- and the

KAPEL:

That's correct.

They found that

it was a traditional public forum.
QUESTION;

16

So if we're worried about these

17

other matters, we could remand and let them decide

18

whether there's been unequal enforcement, couldn't we?

19

MR. KAPEL;

20

QUESTION;

Yes, you could.
Counsel, is your position one of

21

all or nothing, that it either is a traditional public

22

forum or it is not?
Do you have any room at all for what the Court

23

has recognized in some cases, a limited public forum

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. KAPEL

1

There is room for that in this

2

case.

However, I believe that it is not necessary to

3

reach that.; I believe the non-public-forum issue is

4

determinative.
There is no question that speech occurs within

5

6

the terminal.

7

information boards and 'things like that.
Again, those activities, whether they be

And there is no question that there are

speech or nonspeech, are airport related and necessary
for the operation of the airport.

10

To allow information, so long as the Board

11
12

limits it to that information that is needed by the

13

travelling public in their travels, I believe it’s

14

airport related and permissible in a nonpublic forum.
QUESTION;

15

Of course, you have presented

16

nothing by way of evidence to counter-balance the

thing.

22

That’s true.
May I ask, you said airport

related, and you said, things needed by the traveller.
You don't airport related in terms of

Maybe it helps, but -- is that your test?

MR. KAPEL:

2

The test is airport related, and

3

it is what the Board has determined aids the travelling

public in their travels.

5

The

Board has —

6

QUESTION;

7

MR. KAPEL:

But not necessary for the traveller?
Not absolutely necessary.

Clearly

8

it would be possible to operate an airline terminal

9

without food.
QUESTION:

10

And without a Christian Science

reading room.

11

MR. KAPEL:

12

It is not necessary to board an

airplane.

13

QUESTION:

14

However, if it's something like the

15

reading room that provides a

16

waiting for planes, and maybe to obtain peace of mind

17

before you get up in the storm, or something like that,

18

why wouldn't the literature that is passed out by these

19

people perhaps serve some airport related function?

Absolutely.
Why wouldn't reading the literature

that these people pass out be airport related in the

same sense as reading a newspaper is?
MR. KAPEL;

9

would be.

However, the activity of passing it out -QUESTION;

I believe reading the literature

Well, why is that any different

12

than passing -- than offering it for sale by the news

MR. KAPEL:

14

I think it is different, because

15

the Board of Airport Commissioners has determined that a

16

certain amount of space within the terminal should be

17

devoted to loading gates; a certain amount to nevstands;

18

a certain amount to —

HR.

14

KAPEL;

Clearly they could come to us and

do that.

And clearly they could lease space just like

16

the Christian Science reading room has, if they were

17

willing to provide a waiting area, and were not just

there to hand out their pamphlets.

That’s correct.
Why isn’t it equally conceivable

Jews for Jesus?

NR.

KAPEL:

They nay well wish to read it, and

they’re welcome to bring that in the terminals and read

it in the termals or anywhere in the airport.
QUESTION:

9

Are the news people allowed to hawk

10

their newspapers by walking around in the terminal

11

selling them?

12

NR.

KAPEL:

Absolutely not.

The news and gift

decided were appropriate.

MB. KAPEL:

not prohibited.

The activities conducted within the

MR. KAPEL;

No, I believe you could give the

Congressman a piece of paper.

3

QUESTION;

Well, isn’t the ordinance designed

4

in part to prevent obstruction of the passage of people

5

along the concourses on the wav to the planes, and

6

coming out from the planes?
MR.

7

KAPEL:

Of course.

The ordinance here was

8

adopted because the Board of

10

Airport Commissioners had a

it’s not a traditional public forum.

11

They could limit it to the official business

12

of the aiport, or they could open the facility for all

types of activities,

and adopt a time, place and manner

They chose the former option, to limit it to

15
16

the official business of the airport.

Granted,

17

activities occur within the facility between individuals

18

which are not directly airport related.

19

activities occur in every building.

Is that in the record?
MR.

2

KAPEL:

It is in the record from the

3

standpoint that the city has stipulated that the Jews

4

for Jesus, the individual who brought this lawsuit, was

5

not interfering with the travelling public, and was not

6

grabbing onto anybody.
However, the offensiveness of his activity I

7

8

don't believe is the issue here.

The real issue here

9

is, can the Board exercise its option to reserve the

10

facility to only those activities that directly aid the

11

travailing public in their travel.

KAPSLt

Nothing is wrong with what they do.
Well, how can you prohibit

something that doesn't do anything wrong?
MR. KAPEL;

19

Because we are trying to control

20

the uses of the interiors of the terminal facilities.

21

The mere fact that it is not wrong does not

22

mean that it is airport related and is the best use of

23

the terminal facilities.

Ke'ce saying that the

distribution of literature by the Christian Science --

in the Christian Science reading room, allowing that

activity to take place, and denying Jews for Jesus the

5

right to disseminate its religious literature inside the

central terminal area, those messages for First

The fact that one leases the space and one

does not, it would be our position that that would be

basically irrelevant in a publicly owned facility.

What we have here is, in our opinion, a

viewpoint discrimination.

The other issue that exists in this thing is,

13
14

one that walks into the airport terminal and is made

15

aware of this resolution, doesn't even know what the

resolution says.

situation is the existence of a limited or open public
forum.

The activities of Jews for Jesus and other

religious, political, social organizations have taken
place at the central terminal area of LAX.

They've

taken place for at least 12 years.
The petitioners have made much of the fact
that some groups have been denied access.
First off, we would say, some groups may have
been denied access, but other groups have done First
Activities there.
Furthermore, there is nothing in the record
showing why these groups were denied access.

For all we

know, the reason they were denied could be one of
legitimate concerns.

The activities that were going to

take place would be inappropriate in an airport
facility.
So that is not a dispositive — in our
opinion, that is not a dispositive issue.
QUESTION*

Well, we don't know that either.

; We could certainly leave that to the lower court to
figure out if there was some problem there.
MR. SEKULDWi

That was the point I was making

Your Honor, is, there's nothing in the record which
shows why they were denied it, so saying some people
have been denied it, when effectively people have

exercised First Amendment activities inside the central

2

terminal area, in our opinion shows that they are,

3

again, compatible.
QUESTIONi

4

Mr. Sekulow, would you explain to

5

me, because I really don't understand

this from your

6

argument, what is it that makes a public forum special

7

as opposed to any public building?
Because as I undertand your argument, I think

8

what it boils down to saying is, that any public

9
10

building must be allowed to be used for free speech

11

activities to the extent that such activities are not

12

incompatible with

the other uses of the building.

Sow, if you adopt that as a principle, why do

13
14

you need a public forum doctrine?

You don't need it.

15

Doesn't it totally gobble up the concept that there are

16

some buildings where you cannot — you don't even have

17

to have reasonable time, place and manner restrictions?

i

MR. SEX3LDW;

18

Your Honor, one important

19

element of our analysis on this compatibility issue is

20

that there's general access open to the public.

21

—let's take an office building as a good example —

22

you have an office building,

23

an — an argument can be made that the activities taking

24

place inside an office building may not be compatible —

25

narrow guarters .

But it's that general public access, coupled

2
3

with the compatibility.

QUESTION;

But even in a public forum, you are

allowed to place such restrictions as are necessary to

make the speech compatible with whatever else is going

SEKBLDW;

QUESTION:

That's correct.

In a park, and so forth.

So then

10

what difference is there between a public forum and a

11

nonpublic forum, in your view of the world?

12

MR. SEKUL3W;

A nonpublic forum — and

13

arguments have been made regarding a nonpublic forum

14

concerning the internal mail school systems.

15

public access was lacking, Your Honor, in that

16

particular situation, and many others.

It's that

17

There are also cases like Greer v. Spock.

18

There are special functions of facilities, military

19

bases, where that special constitutional function is

20

what this Court determined that special constitutional

21

function justifies -- the concern for national security

22

— justifies -- and national defense — the regulation

23

24

activities from taking place.
