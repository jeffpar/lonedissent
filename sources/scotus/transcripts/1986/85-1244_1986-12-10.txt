ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. CORCORAN, JR., ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

7

8
9

MR. CORCORAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The City of Pleasant Grove submits that it has borne

10

its burden in this case to show, as it must show, that the

11

two annexations which it voted to carry out do not have the

12

purpose of discriminating with respect to the right to vote

13

on grounds of race.

14

To show that we have done this, I'd like to start

15

with the general physical surroundings of Pleasant Grove, and

16

move on and discuss then the annexations that the city has

17

attempted to make, and then discuss the annexation which we

18

decided — the city decided not to make.

19

20

I'd like to start with the highway map of Jefferson
County to place Pleasant Grove in perspective.

Pleasant

21

Grove — this highway map is attached to the Parmley

22

deposition.

23

you can see the city just to the —

24
25

It's reduced.

QUESTION:

It's not in color.

But I think

It is a part of the record, then; it's

a part of the deposition?

MR. CORCORAM:

Pleasant Grove is the first city

It's to be noted, Your Honor, that it's almost a

6

perfect square.

Can you point it out?

10

MR. CORCORAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. CORCORAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

It's right here.

Yes, thank you.
Next I'd like to draw the Court's

13

attention to a reduced copy of the postal map of Pleasant

14

Grove.

15

Appendix.

This is Exhibit B to — it first appears in the Joint
It's referred to on page 5.
It is a reduced copy of what's already in the

16
17

record, and it's not always legible but it does show the

18

annexations.

case are on the far west of the city, the area marked 1979.

20

That's the western annexation.
Then, there is a small area in the northwest corner

of the city.
acres.

It's just a quarter section.

That's marked 1969.

It's just 40

That's the Glasgow addition.

It actually was annexed in 1971 but the petition was in 1969.
I'd like the Court to note that if you go all the

5
1

way around Pleasant Grove, there are no — there are basically

2

no roads except in the south, the southeast of the city.

3

those areas except for the southeast of the city are rural

4

areas.

5

All

The testimony of this map is corroborated by two

6

geological survey maps which are also in the record.

They are

7

defendant's Exhibits 28 and 29, and they are attached to the

8

Parmley deposition.
It is important to note that Pleasant Grove, even

9
10

after all its annexations, is almost completely surrounded by

11

uninhabited territory because, the fact is, before the

12

Highlands area was — the Highlands area was developed in the

13

late 1970s, and the Highlands is a little -- is one 40-acre

14

square to the southeast corner of the city, and it's called

15

West Smithfield Petition, because that's the old name of

16

Pleasant Grove Highlands.

17

It's right here, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION;

Thank you.

19

QUESTION:

Does it say "West Smithfield"?

MR. CORCORAN:

20
21

here.

It does, Your Honor.

It's right

It's hard to read, I'm sorry.

22

QUESTION:

It sure is.

23

HR. CORCORAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CORCORAN:

It's easy to read on the original.

That's not much consolation.
True, Your Honor.

6
1

It's important to note that before the Highlands

2

was developed, there were no contiguous black areas to

3

Pleasant Grove, and there were no close black areas except the

4

Dolomite area, which is in this corner of the map.

5

Under Alabama law, to annex a — for a city to

6

annex territory, it has to be contiguous.

7

the Pleasant Grove-Highlands area was developed, there was no

8

conceivable annexation partner for Pleasant Grove, and there­

9

fore there can be no evidence of a pattern of selective

10

annexation.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. CORCORAN:

13

Therefore, before

What was annexed?

You're saying —

Before the development of Pleasant

Grove Highlands, which is here called West Smithfield --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CORCORAN:

Right.
— which was in the late 1970s,

16

there can be no evidence of a pattern of selective annexation

17

because there were no blacks to annex.

18

contiguous co the city.

19

They weren't

If you wanted to annex blacks, you would have to

20

get the permission of the intervening land owners and reach

21

out to areas of black concentration outside of the city.

22

There were no contiguous areas.

23

was contiguous.

24
25

Everything that was annexed

I'd also like to call the Court's attention to the
third exhibit, which is not part of the record but it's

7
1

referred to in my — it's referred to in my reply brief.

2

is a decision which came down this year from the Tenth

3

Judicial Circuit of Alabama, and we're under an obligation to

4

keep the Court apprised of developments which may affect the

5

case.

6

This

Birmingham annexed all of the area, all the way

7

around Pleasant Grove, and it was set aside in this opinion

8

and it's now on appeal to the Supreme Court of Alabama.

9

But what I'd like to bring the Court's attention to is the

10
11

language on page 4 in the last complete paragraph.
There's a finding there that the area of Pleasant

12

Grove Highlands and Dolomite together, if annexed by the

13

City of Birmingham, would not pay the City of Birmingham in

14

taxes enough to cover the cost of services, and I'll get back

15

to that when I get to Pleasant Grove Highlands.

16

The other developments in this case are that four

17

additional black families either have moved into Pleasant

18

Grove or have houses under construction, so we now have three

19

black families in Pleasant Grove, two houses under

20
21

22
23
24
25

construction.

We have two black voters in Pleasant Grove.

I just determined this today.
Four of these five houses are in the area of the
1967 annexation, which is relevant because as we have argued,
all annexations to Pleasant Grove tend — well, they don't
tend very much — but they do tend to integrate the city.

8
1

We submit, Your Honor, that the annexation of the

2

western addition, the time it was made, it's already been held

3

there was no discriminatory effect.

4

shown that there can't be a discriminatory purpose, because

5

if you look at what could have been in the minds of the

6

city councilmen at the time that they voted for this

7

annexation, there's no way, there's no rational, racial

8

purpose that can arise.

We contend that we've

First of all, at the time they made this decision --

9
10

this is February of 1979 — there's been no annexation in

11

eight years.

The last one was the Glasgow annexation.

The last considerable annexation was in 1967.

12

The

13

'67 annexation was in three parts, but the main parcel which

14

is about 1,600 acres

15
16

It surrounds the city to the west and the south, and the
western addition tacks onto that.
That was almost entirely undeveloped land.

17
18
19

20

record bears that out.

25

That annexation, the one in 19-67,

was pre-cleared by the Justice Department.

That's number one.

Number two, they're adding vacant land owned first
by the city and second by developers living within the city.
Third, it's uncontroverted on this record that

23
24

The

city's conviction is that it gets money from that, and the

21

22

is very much like the western addition.

taking in undeveloped land yields substantial fees for the
city.

The Mays affidavit, which is at the end of the Joint

9
1

Appendix — we have to do some additions and subtractions —

2

but the Mays affidavit shows that development fees

3

contributed 25 percent of expenditures in the two years

4

before this vote in 1979, about 25 percent.

5

6
7

Fourth, Pleasant Grove was all white.

It doesn't

have a white majority that it needs to defend.
And finally, all annexations, logically, because

8

they add new houses, because we have fair housing laws, every

9

time we add a new house, every time we put a house on the

10

market for sale, if you're all white and you want to stay all

11

white you don't add new houses.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. CORCORAN, JR., ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - RESUMED

9

MR. CORCORAN:

The other annexation that is at issue

10

here today is the Glasgow annexation.

11

for us to justify under Voting Rights Act criteria because

12

it was — Glasgow's petition in 1969 at a time when Jefferson

13

County schools were being desegregated and Pleasant Grove was

14

attempting to set up its own separate school system, the

15

Glasgows were in that school; that is, they were in the

16

Pleasant Grove school at the time the changes were made, and

17

they wished to remain there.
So, they asked to be taken into the city, and

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

This is more difficult

because they were good friends, basically, of a city
councilman named Mr. Parmley, as Judge McKinnon found, they
got in.
When the District Court required us to add the
Glasgow annexation to our complaint, to pre-clear the western
annexation, we told the court that rather than do that we
would prefer to abandon it, and the court told us that they

11
1

wouldn't allow us to do that.

2

That's not relevant except if the argument is made

3

that we're trying to add white voters, we certainly tried to

4

get rid of these white voters, as soon as any difficulties

5

were presented, in favor of an area with no white voters,

6

to wit, the western addition which has no people in it at

7

all, at least for the moment.

8
9

But if we look at what goes through the mind *of a
city councilman, and if the issue is, are they discriminating

10

with respect to voting, at the time they make that decision,

11

we submit, they are not discriminating with respect to

12

voting.
There are no black areas petitioning at that time,

13
14

for the reason that we stated before, there were no black '

15

areas continguous to Pleasant Grove until the late 1970s,

16

and this is 1969.

17

school.

18

they let them in so they could stay in the school.

They were friends of people in Pleasant Grove, and

This brings us to the area which the government

19

20

They got in because they were in the

claims we should have let in and we did not let in, on

21

racially discriminatory grounds, and that is the area of

22

Pleasant Grove Highlands which is that 40-acre section to the

23

southeast of the city which is marked, "West Smithfield

24

Petition."

25

When this petition came to the attention of the city

12
1

council, they appointed a committee to study it and the

2

committee basically concluded, based not on any new study it

3

made but on its practice in the last — since 1967, to take

4

in undeveloped land to get the development fees, that it was

5

not economical to take it in.

6
7

What they did give them was free fire and paramedic
protection.

They did that because what precipitated --

When in 1979, after the decision to take in the
western addition, they decided that there were too many
strings on their fire and police — basically their fire and
paramedic -- and they announced that they were going to
withdraw it, and immediately they got — not immediately, but
first from Pleasant Grove Highlands and later from Dolomite
that same year, they were asked to be annexed.
It’s uncontested, in any event, the government did

of the cost of services in 1930.

That's services to them, or services

everywhere?
MR. CORCORAN:

It's a estimate of the cost of

7

services to them, and the estimate is based on an assumption

8

that they will cost exactly the same as everyone else does

9

per capita.

10

The way the figure was created, Your Honor, is they

11

took the total cost of services for Pleasant Grove.

12

divided it per household, or per capita, I'm not sure which,

13

either per capita or per household, and they figured out how

14

much it cost per household.

16

23

They

And then they figured out how

many households there were in Pleasant Grove Highlands and
assumed that they'd pay the same per capita taxes as
everyone — no, they didn't assume that,
Sarah Mays, as the city treasurer, went through what
you get in taxes, and made an estimate which was conceded by
the government as to what would go up in rough proportion to
population if Pleasant Grove Highlands was annexed.

And the

figure that came out was 14 percent, and the government
conceded the accuracy of the figure.
QUESTION;

Mr, Corcoran, this evidence that you

are referring to now, I take it you cite it to show the

14
1

absence of a discriminatory intent or purpose on the part of

2

the city council?

3

MR. CORCORAN:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, the District Court found otherwise.

5

If we should say that that finding isn't clearly erroneous,

6

do you nonetheless — did you lose your case?

7

MR. CORCORAN:

Yes.

You have to find that that's

8

clearly — you have to find that the District Court's

9

findings were clearly erroneous.
QUESTION:

10

But if we find that the District

11

Court's finding on this question of purpose was not clearly

12

erroneous, and that the city council did act in on or more

13

of these transactions with a discriminatory intent, does

14

that mean you lose your case?
MR. CORCORAN:

15

If you find that with respect to the

16

decision on the western addition or the Glasgow annexation

17

there was a discriminatory purpose, then we fail.

18

lose.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Then we

If you find there was no discriminatory purpose on
the Glasgow addition or the western annexation but there was
in the Pleasant Grove Highlands decision, then our argument
is that we win,
QUESTION:

And why is that?

Why is the presence

of discriminatory intent with respect to a couple of those
annexations controlling, but not with respect to the other?

15
MR. CORCORAN:

1

Because those two annexations are the

2

two annexations which are the subject of the Voting Rights

3

Act, of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

4

Rights Act only covers changes.

The Voting

It doesn't cover non-changes.

The decisions to take in the Glasgow annexation and

5

6

the western addition were changes, and thus covered by the

7

Act.

8

was not a change and thus not covered by the Act.

The decision not to take in Pleasant Grove Highlands

And thus, if you decide that there was

9
10

discrimination in not taking in the Pleasant Grove Highlands,

11

the government can sue and undertake the burden of proof and,

12

as in Gomillion v. Ligntfoot —

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CORCORAN:

15
16
17
18
19

But that's not a Voting Rights Act —
That's not a Voting Rights Act case.

And the important fact, of course, is who's got the burden
of proof.

Putting the burden of proof on the city is very

onerous, and we submit Congress only intended to change the
burden of proof in the cases which it set out in the statute,
and that's just changes.
QUESTION:

Well, I'm still not quite sure why you

20
21

22
23
24
25

think that you lose the case if there is a discriminatory
purpose in taking in the western and Glasgow,
MR. CORCORAN:
QUESTION:

Well, perhaps I shouldn't —

It couldn't have any impact on the

Voting Rights, could it?

16
1

2

MR. CORCORAN:
White.

We have to show under Section 5 —

3
4

QUESTION:

Do you think that you — are you agreeing

with Judge McKinnon or not?

5

MR. CORCORAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

On the whole, yes.

Well, what do you think he thought about

discriminatory purpose, about the western —
MR. CORCORAN:

8
9

Well, that's the question, Justice

Kis argument, as I remember it is,

how can there be a discriminatory purpose if there is no

10

discriminatory effect.

11

if you pretend there's a discriminatory purpose where there's

12

no effect.
Now, there are some factual situations, as in the

13
14

Busby case, which is cited.
QUESTION:

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

You're just creating a legal fiction

Well, why do you say there was

coverage on those two annexations?
changes?

Were they?

You say they were

Changes in what?

MR. CORCORAN:

Well, you can make an argument —

we haven't made this argument because we didn't think we had
to make it, but you can make the argument that adding vacant
land is not a Voting Rights — is not a change of Voting
Rights pradtice, because there's nobody there.
That argument —
QUESTION:

Why is taking in the Glasgow a change?

MR. CORCORAN:

Taking in the Glasgow is a change,

17
1

because there are voters in the Glasgow addition.

2

it has no discriminatory effect, obviously, because there are

3

no black voters in Pleasant Grove to have their vote diluted.

4

Well, finally, it's also not contested that $45,000

5

in development fees are given up if you take in the 79 houses

6

in Pleasant Grove Highlands rather than building them out in

7

the western addition and getting your development fees up

8

front.

Now,

9

Also, there's a racially discriminatory effect if

10

you take in the Pleasant Grove Highlands, because they vote

11

as an insignificant minority in Pleasant Grove instead of as

12

a considerable minority in Jefferson County.

13

correctly puts out that they still get to vote in Jefferson

14

County, but the essential services of local governments will

15

be protected by — will be provided by Pleasant Grove and not

16

Jefferson County.

17

The government

Finally, Your Honor, we concede that you can look

18

at the Pleasant Grove Highlands decision to determine whether

19

there was a discriminatory purpose as to the decision made

20
21

two months earlier on the western addition, or the decision
made eight years earlier on the Glasgow addition.

It's

22

technically relevant but it's not very probative, because

23

first of all, they don't know it's coming.

24
25

The reason that Pleasant Grove Highlands petitioned
was that they got their paramedic and fire cut off a month

18
1

later, and we also say it's not very probative because

2

Pleasant Grove Highlands is so unpersuasive from an economic

3

point of view as a rational annexation partner.

4

May I reserve the rest of my time?

5

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

6

We'll hear now from you, Mr. Ganzfried.

Yes, you may.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERROLD J. GANZFRIED, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9

MR. GANZFRIED:

10

may it please the Court:

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

The issue in this case is whether the City of

12

Pleasant Grove has sustained its burden of proving that its

13

decisions to make two annexations, the western addition in

14

1979 and the Glasgow property in 1971, its burden of proving

15

that those two decisions were made without a racially

16

discriminatory purpose or effect.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION: Tell me, were there people in both the
western addition and the Glasgow annexation?
MR. GANZFRIED:

At the time of the annexation, the

Glasgow annexation, there were people living there.

They

petitioned for that annexation four days after the Federal
District Court had entered its desegregation order for the
Pleasant Grove Schools, and four days after Pleasant Grove
announced that it was going to secede from the county school
system to set up its own.

19
1

2
3
4
5

In the western addition there were no people living
there at the time of the annexation.
QUESTION:

Well, how did the annexation dilute

anyone's voting rights?
MR. GANZFRIED:

Our contention is not that it did

6

dilute anyone's voting rights.

7

annexation, which expanded the borders, political borders of

8

the city, expanded the franchise, was a step that was taken

9

with a discriminatory purpose.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GANZFRIED:

12

Our position is that the

Well, but what's the effect of this step?
It has no present effect.

It has

a potential effect.

13

franchise and the size of the electorate.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gansfried, I'm a little worried

about having a continuous unit with white and black people,
and then you bring in 1,000 white people and say it doesn't
dilute anybody's vote.
MR. GANZFRIED:

It doesn't dilute the vote of

anyone who is presently voting in the city,
QUESTION:

But it does, in the present —

MR. GANZFRIED:
diluting the vote.

It certainly has a potential for

20
1

QUESTION:

2

MR. GANZFRIED:

It doesn't dilute —
— any black citizen that ever moves

3

into Pleasant Grove, whether by way of moving or by way of

4

being annexed into the city.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GANZFRIED:

7

But their vote —
It affects their vote.

It would

affect their vote.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GANZFRIED:

And will that dilute the Negro vote?
It will dilute the vote when the

10

day comes that there are black voters in Pleasant Grove.

11

As Mr.Corcoran tells us this morning —
QUESTION:

12

Okay.

You've got this 1,0.00 white votes

13

in Jefferson County, and you've got 4,000 Negro votes in

14

Jefferson County, and you annex 2,000 white votes.
MR. GANZFRIED:

15
16

It will still be in Jefferson

County.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. GANZFRIED:

19

Jefferson County —

20

QUESTION:

Well, they'll be in Jefferson County.
Jefferson County — the borders of

Jefferson County will have 2,000 more

21

white votes and no more Negro votes.

22

it?

23

MR. GANZFRIED:

And that doesn't dilute

It dilutes the vote in Jefferson

24

County, but Jefferson County in this case has only grown

25

internally.

It hasn't expanded its boundaries.

So that, had

21
1

there been an expansion of Jefferson County, and that was the

2

jurisdiction that was before us, absolutely there would be a

3

present dilution of black votes, no question about that.

4

This is the city that comes in and says, because it

5

has been absolutely successful in excluding black people from

6

every aspect of life in Pleasant Grove, and as a result there

7

are no black citizens of Pleasant Grove and no black voters

8

in Pleasant Grove, they now seek to be rewarded for the total

9

success of the past discrimination.

And they say that that

10

has created an exemption for them from Section 5 of the Voting

11

Rights Act because, after all, since we don't have any black

12

voters in the city, how could anything we do possibly affect

13

the voting rights of black people in the city of Plesant

14

Grove.

15

QUESTION:

Hr. Ganzfried, if I understood your

16

response to the Chief Justice earlier, you concede that the

17

city does not bear any burden of showing no discriminatory

18

motive in not annexing the Pleasant Grove Highlands?

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

MR. GANZFRIED:

Well, Pleasant Grove Highlands,

because if was a decision not to make an annexation, did not
constitute a change that triggered the Section 5 pre-clearance
QUESTION:

So, that's relevant in view —

MR. GANZFRIED:
QUESTION:

It is relevant —

It is relevant only because it is

relevant to what their motive was in making the other,

22
1

earlier annexations?

2

MR. GANZFRIED:

Well, the western addition is not

3

an earlier annexation.

4

contemporaneous with the decision with respect to the

5

Highlands, Your Honor, because the state statute that

6

permitted the annexation was not signed by the Governor until

7

many months after the Pleasant Grove Highlands petition

8

had —

9

QUESTION:

It's a contemporaneous decision,

What was the order of the decision on

10

the two, and how much were they separated in time?

11

Pleasant Grove seek the annexation of the western --

12

MR. GANZFRIED:

When did

That was voted by the council on

13

February 5th of 1979.

The date of the petition from the

14

Highlands was in April of '79.

15

Governor, authorizing the western addition in July of 1979.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. GANZFRIED:

The Act was signed by the

February, April?
February, April and July, at the

18

time that the western — that the Highlands petition was

19

presented, the western addition matter was still pending in

20
21

22
23
24
25

terms of being advertised in the local newspapers and was
before the state legislature.
So, there were certainly contemporaneous decisions
made by the same decision makers.
QUESTION:

The theory you're asking us to accept is

that we should consider it a dilution of voting rights if

23
1

it has a potential to cause a dilution in the future, when a

2

black person would have moved into Pleasant Grove, right?

3

Because at the time there was no dilution of any minority

4

vote.

5

MR. GANZFRIED:

At the time there was no dilution

6

of anyone who was living in the city, at the time of the

7

annexation.

8

QUESTION:

Right.

MR. GANZFRIED:

The question of dilution is really

10

a question that arises under the effects prong of Section 5.

11

Section 5 has two prongs.

12

that its actions were not taken with a discriminatory

13

purpose, nor with a discriminatory effect.

The city has the burden of proving

The question of actual, immediate, present dilution

14
15

goes to the effects aspect of it, and that is not part of

16

this case.

17

QUESTION:

What case here would say that if there's

18

a discriminatory purpose that violates the Act, even though

19

there couldn't possibly be any discriminatory effect?

20
21

MR. GANZAFRIED:

Well, let me refer to the City of

Richmond case in which, after a long analysis in which the

22

Court concluded-that there was no unlawful effect.

23

said, so much for the effect prong of Section 5.

24
25

It then
We are now

turning to the purpose prong of Section 5 because the
presence of a discriminatory purpose will invalidate a

24
1

decision even if there is no unlawful effect.

2

And, the Richmond case was remanded on the question

3

of purpose, even though this Court had decided that there was

4

no unlawful effect.

5

QUESTION:

6

Is that the closest case in this Court?

Is that the only one?
MR. GAHZFRIED:

7

I believe — it's not the only one.

8

The Court has said many times that because the statute is

9

written in the conjunctive, that the jurisdiction, seeking

10

approval of its change, has the burden of proving both the

11

absence of a discriminatory purpose and the absence of a

12

discriminatory effect.
QUESTION:

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

But, Mr. Ganzfried, doesn't -- to trigger

the application of the statute at all, doesn't it have to have
some effect on voting qualifications or practices or
procedures, and how does taking in vacant land have such an
effect?
MR. GANZFRIED:
QUESTION:

It has that effect.

Even the statute alone —

MR. GANZFRIED:

There are two aspects to the way

20
21

22
23
24
25

I'd like to answer that.

The first is, it has an effect,

particularly when it is an annexation of vacant land intended
for development, we agree that the annexation of vacant land
for building an airport, or to construct a public park, does
not constitute a voting change and therefore, as we. indicate

25
1

in our brief, the Attorney General does not require pre­

2

clearance of those sorts of annexations.

3

But when it is an annexation that is intended for

4

the purpose of development, to expand a franchise by adding

5

residential areas to the city, then Section 5 is triggered

6

and there must be clearance before anyone is permitted to vote

7

in those areas.
Now, as it happened, the City of Pleasant Grove

8
9

chose to submit that annexation for pre-clearance

10

immediately following the passage of the legislation, at a

11

time when there was no population in the western addition.
QUESTION:

12

May I come back to your reliance on the

13

City of Richmond case.

14

at issue involved thousands of people in Chesterfield

15

County who were proposed to be annexed, and —

16

MR. GANZFRIED:

17

QUESTION:

18

23
24
25

Do you think that case is analogous to

MR. GANZFRIED:

It's analogous with respect to the

point that Justice White's question goes to.
QUESTION:

21

22

The point I was making —

this one?

19
20

Actually, in that case the annexation

Is it analogous to our decision in this

case?
MR. GANZFRIED:

It certainly is, because it's a

case that turned exclusively on the purpose, even though
there was no unlawful effect.

26
1

2

The City of Rome case was one where there were
uninhabited territories that were annexed.

3

QUESTION:

The effect would have been substantially

4

to dilute the black vote in the City of Richmond.

5

statistics prove that.
MR. GANZFRIED:

6

The

But the Court concluded that because

7

the plan that would be in effect subsequent to the annexation

8

provided fair representation that there was no unlawful

9

effect.
QUESTION:

10
11

It was opposed by the black community

only because their vote would be diluted.

12

Well, let's move on.

13

MR. GANZFRIED:

Let's move on.

But it affects the point I was

14

responding to Justice White on, namely that there was -- it

15

was a case that turned only on purpose where there was no

16

unlawful effect.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

The City of Rome case is one where there

was uninhabited land that was annexed, and the Court found
that —
QUESTION:

What's your position?

MR. GANZFRIED:
QUESTION:

City of Rome, City of Richmond?

City of Richmond.

MR. GANZAFRIED:

Indeed, I would refer also to

Perkins versus Matthews in which one of the three
annexations that were at issue there, it was pointed out,
involved an increase in the population but that added no

27
1

white voters.

2

Let me get back to the procedural point, Justice

3

O'Connor.

4

Under Section 5 the Attorney General has only 60 days in which

5

to make a decision on an annexation.

6

that annexation is pre-cleared and that means that when the

7

day comes that the western addition is populated, as the city

8

intended and anticipated, by the increase of substantial

9

numbers of white population, that there would be no further

10
11

The city came in immediately after the annexation.

If he fails to object,

opportunity for Section 5 pre-clearance.
That would defeat the purpose of Section 5 by

12

allowing jurisdictions to manipulate by the timing of their

13

submissions, around the burden of proof, by saying because

14

there's no present effect, therefore there can be no

15

discriminatory purpose.

16

purpose prong has been written right out of the statute.

17
18
19

20
21

QUESTION:

And if that's the case, then the

Does that sort of thing happen a lot?

Are we seeing a lot of this annexations of vacant land?
MR. GANZFRIED:

Annexation of vacant land is a very

common form of expansion, and we've indicated in our brief,
the report of the United States Civil Rights Commission to

22

Congress, pointing out that most of the annexations that have

23

been objected to by the Department were to annexations of

24

land populated largely by white people, or to annexations of

25

land that was vacant.

28
1

It has certainly been made known to Congress that

2

that is the Attorney General's interpretation and Congress

3

has re-enacted Section 5 without change.

4

QUESTION:

You may have already answered this.

5

Did the Attorney General turn these down, turn these

6

annexations down?

7

MR. GANZFRIED:

8

down.

9

Attorney General.

The’ Glasgow annexation was never submitted to the

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GANZFRIED:

12

It turned the western annexation

And is his — did he write an opinion?
It is a letter to the city that is

in the record in this case.

13

QUESTION:

Now, where is that?

14

MR. GANZFRIED:

It is attached to the Motion for

15

Summary Judgment.

That's document No. 24 in the record, and

16

the letter from the Department of Justice is Exhibit F, for

17

that submission.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. GANZFRIED:

20
21

But it's not in the Joint Appendix?
That letter's not in the Joint

Appendix.
QUESTION:

I assume, Mr. Ganzfried, that the effect

22

which you must purpose is the same as the effect that is

23

referred to in the other part of the injunctive provision in

24

the statute, okay.

25

that there is an invalid purpose, then would it not follow

So that means that if we hold in this case

29
1

that it is always an impermissible effect for the municipality

2

that's covered by the Act to annex any portion in which white

3

voters will outnumber black voters?

4

MR. GANZFRIED:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GANZFRIED:

No.

Why not?
Because the effect that — let me

7

restate our position in the case.

8

things a bit.

I think it might clarify

9

Our position is that when a covered jurisdiction

10

makes a change that calls for Section 5 pre-clearance, and

11

certainly this does, and the City sought that pre-clearance,

12

and it makes that change with a racially discriminatory

13

purpose or fails to sustain its burden of proving that it

14

did not have that purpose —

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Which purpose is to bring in more white

voters than black voters?
MR. GANZFRIED:

Which purpose is to discriminate on

the basis of race.
QUESTION:

But here you're saying, is to add white

voters in excess of black voters, right?
MR. GANZFRIED:

In this case the intent is to

expand the size of the monolithic white electorate.
QUESTION:

That's right.

But my point is, If

that is a bad purpose in and of itself, then that would
always be a bad effect in and of itself as well, wouldn't it?

30
1

MR. GANZFRIED:

No, because under the court cases

2

that you would look to is whether as a consequence of that

3

change the voting system in that jurisdiction would provide

4

fair representation to minorities on the basis of their share

5

of the population, and —
QUESTION:

6
7

the relative status of —

8
9

Don't you look to see if it diminishes

MR. GANZFRIED:
diminishes.

Well, you look to see if it

But for example, once again in the City of

10

Richmond case, the changes there did diminish the percentage

11

of the black population in the City of Richmond.

12

found that it did not have an unlawful effect under

13

Section 5.

14

By the same token there are instances —

15

QUESTION:

16

The Court

I know, but proportional representation,

fair representation is not the test.
MR. GANZFRIED:

17

Well, let me focus on the purpose

18

prong, because that is really the submission that we're

18

making here.
QUESTION:

20

Now, my concern is that what we do on

21

the purpose prong may affect what we do on the effect prong

22

later on.

23

voters is enough to establish a bad purpose, I would think

24
25

And if a prospective influx of additional white

that a prospective influx of white voters is enough to
establish a bad effect as well,

So that, every time there

31
1

is an annexation, one will have to figure out what the

2

likely demographic population in the future is going to be,

3

and if it's likely to be —

4

MR. GANZFRIED:

I think it oversimplifies this case

5

somewhat to say that we have simply a potential influx of

6

white voters.

7

as indicated not only by the decision not to annex the

8

Highlands area, but as also indicated by the City's decision

9

as early as 1969 not to annex white areas or largely

We also have a fencing out of black voters,

10

unpo;ulated areas because of what the Mayor described as the

11

"mushroom" or "snowball" effect that might increase the

12

pressure upon the city later to annex black areas that were at

13

that point a little more on the outskirts of town.

14

QUESTION: That's all very helpful.

15

MR. GANZFRIED:

16
17

We have a fencing out of black

voters.
QUESTION:

It's all very helpful when you're

18

deciding a purpose case. But I — which is what this is, but

19

I'm wondering whether your description of what it is that

20
21

22
23
24
25

must be purposed will not affect us in — should we use that
word — will not alter the kind of decision we have to make
in effect cases later.
MR. GANZFRIED:
QUESTION:

I don't see that it would.

I'll just follow that up with — I

guess what you're saying is that if they had developed the

32
1

land before they sought to annex it, and they have added

2

1,000 white people in the new development, would that be an

3

unlawful effect or wouldn't it?

4

I think what Justice Scalia is suggesting is, under

5

your rationale here, you'd have to say that effect would be

6

unlawful.

7

MR. GANZFRIED:

8

that is probably yes.

9

because —

10
11
12

QUESTION:

In this jurisdiction, the answer to

We haven't taken a position on that

Without proving any wrongful purpose

in connection with that acquisition?
MR. GANZFRIED:

Okay.

If there is no unlawful

13

purpose and it is simply that as a matter of happenstance,

14

and we are assuming out any unlawful purpose in that

15

instance, then it may well be that that would not be an

16

unlawful effect.

17

Simply the fact that demographics move in a

18

particular direction isn't something that we have any control

19

over under Section 5.

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

It seems to me you are saying that it's

not a bad effect because there's no bad purpose, and there
goes the end of the —
MR. GANZFRIED:
hypothetical.

Well, I just followed along on a

If the hypothetical is that a city can be in

this position, namely, to be an all-white city ringed by

33
1

concentrations of unincorporated black communities which

2

Pleasant Grove is, and for it to happen just as — without

3

any motive or purpose behind it that only white people

4

continue to move into the city, and there's no racial

5

discrimination involved in that hypothetical, which seems

6

rather remote, then maybe in that instance there's no

7

unlawful effect.

8

But it may also be —

9

QUESTION:

MR. GANZFRIED:

10
11

Mr. Ganzfried —
— also in that instance you're

likely to find that there is an unlawful purpose.
QUESTION:

12

Why doesn't the Attorney General take

13

the position that unless there is some change in voting, that

14

an application to him for review and approval under this

15

Voting Rights Act section is just not timely?

16

save your right to examine it when in fact there's some —
MR. GANZFRIED:

17

And then you

Because of the way the statute is

18

written.

19

60 days, it's pre-cleared. There's no second opportunity.
There's no chance to say, well, wait a minute

20
21

22
23
24
25

If the Attorney General does not object within

now.

Now there are people living there.
QUESTION:

The statute — I mean, as I look at the

statute anyway, it doesn't even come into effect unless
there's some change in voting qualification prerequisite to
voting, or standard practice or procedure with respect to

34
1

voting that's different.

2
3

And if there isn't one, how doss the statute ever
figure at all?

4
5

MR. GANZFRIED:
under Section 5.
QUESTION:

6
7

So, why don't you say, you can't file

one?
MR.

8
9

because the city made a submission

GANZFRIED:

Because it may very well be that

the legal consequence of saying, you're too early, and not

10

objecting to it within 60 days, is that it will be pre-cleared,

11

because the statute says that if the Attorney General has not

12

interposed an objection within 60 days after such submission,

13

then the city is permitted to pursue the change.
QUESTION:

14

May I pursue some of these other

15

questions a little bit?

16

one all white and one all black, and the law in Alabama or

17

whatever state the state may be permitted the white community

18

to annex.
Let's assume it decided not to annex any of the

19

20

black area.

23
24
25

Would that be unlawful?

MR. GANZFRIED:

21

22

Assume you had two communities,

review.

It would not trigger Section 5

It may well be unlawful under other sections or the

Voting Rights Act, but it would not trigger Section 5 because
there would be no change.
QUESTION:

And why is this case different, because —

35

MR. GANZFRIED:

Because here the city has voted

2

to make an annexation.

4

the franchise.

QUESTION:
choice?

It has decided to enlarge its

It doesn't.

If it makes no

annexation, there is no Section 5 review triggered because
then, there is not a change.

11

QUESTION:

12

annexation by black citizens.

Suppose there had been no requests for

MR. GANZFRIED:

14

15

evidentiary facts to be considered.
QUESTION:

16

That wouldn't change the equation
It might change the

If there were an area occupied by

17

black citizens and an area occupied by white citizens, and

18

the latter was annexed and the former was not annexed, if

19

there were no requests from the black citizens to be

20

annexed —

21

MR. GANZFRIED:

If there is an annexation, and as

22

I understand that hypothetical there would be, but we have

23

the white area.

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

25

MR. GANZFRIED:

Then Section 5 would be triggered.

36
1

The question before the Court would be, is that jurisdiction

2

permitted to annex that white area.

3

The question is not, and it's not in this case,

4

whether it must annex the black area.

5

rejecting one and accepting another are indicative of the

6

purpose.

7

QUESTION:

But its actions in

So, the fact that there was an area

8

here, a black area that wanted to be annexed at an earlier

9

date makes no difference to this case?

10

MR. GANZFRIED:

It makes a very important

11

evidentiary difference as to the city's purpose.

12

no difference as to whether there is an obligation to file

13

for pre-clearance under Section 5 because that obligation was

14

triggered only by the decision to make an annexation, not by

15

a decision not to make an annexation.
QUESTION:

16

It makes

Even though there is no change whatever

17

in voting rights of the black citizens, or indeed the white

18

citizens?

19

20

MR. GANZFRIED:

There is no present change, but

what we have here is a —

21

QUESTION:

— there will ever be a change —

22

MR. GANZFRIED:

If there was never to be a change,

23

the Attorney General does not take the position that the

24

city would ever have to come in and submit for pre-clearance.

25

If they wanted to build an airport, if they wanted to leave

37
1

it as a forest preserve, that would not trigger a voting

2

change.
But what we have here is the city making an

3
4

annexation for purposes of development for residential

5

housing.

6

for the city to pursue that development to know in advance

7

that it is part of the City of Pleasant Grove, that it

8

submitted for pre-clearance.

9
10
11

And because it makes it much easier, apparently,

QUESTION:

It may not have any effect on voting for

ten, fifteen, twenty years.
MR. GANZFRIED:

It may or may not.

It presently,

12

however, has the potential to affect voters and it is

13

QUESTION:

So, we decide this case on the basis of

potential conduct that may or may never occur?
MR, GANZFRIED:
of the city's purpose.

Well, you decide it on the basis
Let me say that when it's suggested

that the potential conduct may or may never occur, is to say
that the city must lose that case because it is the city's
burden of proving that its annexation will have no effect.
To say "may or may not" is to say the city has not
met that burden.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ganzfried, why is that even a

33
1

plausible purpose to attribute to the city?

2

that has not a single black voter at the time the annexation

3

is made.

4

every time you sell a house you're taking a chance if you

5

want to preserve that kind of an electorate.

There are fair housing laws.

You have a city

So, it's clear that

You're taking a chance that a black will buy that

house.

Why is it even plausible that if the city wanted to

8

keep an entire white electorate, it wouldn't annex anything —
MR. GANZFRIED:

9

— writing on a clean slate here,

10

the City of Pleasant Grove made a similar annexation in 1967.

11

The history of that development has been with all of the laws

12

you have just referred to, is that in the areas annexed in

13

1967 that have been developed, they have provided residential

14

housing for white people and not for black people.

So, when this submission --

MR. GANZFRIED:

24
25

In every Section 5 case there is

always a chance that the effect that the Court looks at from
the statistics may not occur.

Section 5 is a pre-clearance

statute.
The determination is made before the changes to into

Every time a

house is sold there's a chance.

19

Always a chance, though.

effect.

There is never an actual effect in a Section 5 case.

There is always some measure of prediction.
We are saying that in this case, based on this

39
1

record and what the District Court regarded as the astonishing

2

hostility to the rights of black Americans, that the evidence

3

is sufficient to make that determination here, that the

4

city's purpose rightly or wrongly in terms of what the future

5

may bring in terms of — into this area, that its present

6

purpose was to enlarge the white electorate, to fence out

7

black voters so that should any blacks move into Pleasant

8

Grove their votes — they would be an even smaller minority

9

than they are today.

10

The fact of the matter is that the city was building

11

on a history of some 40 years in which there were no blacks

12

who lived in Pleasant Grove.

Did the District Court find there was a

In this annexation, not in the —
There are two annexations.

In the two annexations —
In these annexations.

I mean, not in the aggregate of the two

annexations plus the refusal to annex?
QUESTION:

I mean —

The court weighed all of those as

8

probative evidence of the purpose, and the court then found

9

that the city has a discriminatory annexation policy that it

10
11

implemented in these two cases.
If we had a city, for example, that was going and

12

annexing individual houses, one at a time, and it turned out

13

that they were only houses that white people lived in, you

14

might — and it sought pre-clearance, you might look at each

15

one and say, well, we can't see that annexing this one house

16

with a few people in it makes much of a difference.

17

But when you look at the pattern and you see what

18

the policy is, that it's creating this checkerboard and that

19

they've had 500 similar annexations like this, there comes a

20

time when it's fair to say that we know what's going on here

21

and we know what the purpose is.

22

And, while the consequence is simply that this

23

annexation is not permitted, it is certainly available to

24

the Attorney General and to the Court to weigh the probative

25

evidence indicating the city's purpose.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. CORCORAN, JR., ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - REBUTTAL

7

MR. CORCORAN:

First of all, Justice Scalia, what

8

Mr. Ganzfried said about sales in the 1967 addition — I

9

mean, annexation, that every single house was sold to white

10

people is inaccurate.

11

have now been sold to black people.

12

As I represented this morning, four

Secondly, the city is not ringed by unincorporated

13

black communities as Mr. Ganzfried said. As we pointed out —

14

as I pointed out in the beginning of my argument, supported

15

by the postal map of Pleasant Grove, unincorporated black

16

communities — the postal map of Pleasant Grove and geological

17

survey, except for the southeast of the city, it is

18

surrounded by empty land.

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Third, it doesn't really mean much to say that the
1979 decision to take in the western addition is
contemporaneous with the decision not to take in Pleasant
Grove Highlands.

It's true, there's some overlap but the

timing is as follows:

in late 1973 the people who owned —

the people who lived in Pleasant Grove, who owned the western
addition, came to the city and started talking to the Mayor.

42
1

The Mayor presented the question to the City

2

Council on February 5th.

3

State Legislature of Alabama, which was willing to consider

4

it only because it was completely unpopulated.

It was immediately sent to the

The State Legislature of Alabama will not vote to

5

6

take one community into another community if there are people

7

in there unless they get a chance to vote on it.

8

the two — if they decided to take in the Highlands, they

9

couldn't combine these two decisions.
Then in March of 1979 they took away the fire and

10
11

paramedic protection.

12

annexed.

In April the Highlands asked to be

So that,

at the end of 1979,

they said,

we'll give you your fire and paramedic protection back.
there was some shilly-shallying.

Then

Eventually they didn't do

anything.
QUESTION:

I take it your argument — all of this

is revolving around the validity of the conclusion below,
that you hadn't carried your burden of showing no
discriminatory purpose.
MR. CORCORAN:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's all it's about,

isn't it?

Do you

agree with your opposition that the District Court actually
found a discriminatory purpose?
MR. CORCORAN:

It's not a holding.

They suggested

43
1

that.

They said they would find —

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. CORCORAN:

They would have found —
I think — I mean, I have to really

4

look at the language, but ray memory is that the District

5

Court said, not only do we find they haven't carried out

6

their burden of proof, but if the burden of proof was the

7

other way would we rule the same way.

8

QUESTION:

We would have had no difficulty in .

9

finding and reading it?

10

MR. CORCORAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. CORCORAN:

13

Your Honor.

Yes.

They spoke in the subjunctive?
Yes.

Well, it wasn't a holding,

Judge McKinnon went the other way.

14

With respect to the City of Richmond case and the

15

City of Rome cases, of course we depend heavily on the City

16

of Richmond case because it's our contention that if Pleasant

17

Grove tried to bring in the Highlands, it would be a violation

18

of the Voting Rights Act because the effect -- it would be

19

an effect of diluting their vote, diluting their vote for

20
21

22
23
24
25

essential city services.
So, we rely very heavily on the Richmond case,
against the government.

What makes Richmond and Rome

different from this case, in both of those cases you had
large cities with large black minorities. In the Richmond
case, Richmond actually had a black majority before the

44
1

annexation.

2

So, there's a reason to attribute to the white

3

people some sensitivity to bringing in a few more white

4

people, but we don't have that here.

5

people, no black voters in Pleasant Grove at the time these

6

decisions were made.

There were no black

7

In the City of Rome case we have a lot of

8

annexations of vacant land, but there, if my memory's correct,

9

there were 60 annexations in four years.

So, it's plausible

10

the — to put together all the annexations and say, well,

11

there's one common purpose.

12

four annexations in 50 years.

But here you're talking about

As to the point about — Justice Scalia's point

13
14

and Justice O'Connor's point, I think that the government's

15

position in this case does ask us to make decisions based on

16

speculation as to future impacts on voting, and you can argue

17

that one way or the other on the literal language of the

18

statute.

19

with cases in which there's going to be no impact on voting

20
21

22
23
24
25

But as a practical matter, what are you going to do

for five or six years except to say, for the immediate future
there's no effect.
QUESTION:

Well, why did the city ask for

pre-clearance?
MR. CORCORAN: Because of the City of Richmond case,
the City of Richmond case, Perkins v. Mathews, City of

45
1

Richmond case, suggested that annexations were covered by

2

the Voting Rights Act.

3

I certainly think, Justice O'Connor, that if the

4

Justice Department came out with regulations and said, in

5

cases like this case you're not to petition until you have

6

an immediate effect, that the Court would defer to those

7

regulations and there would be no problem in upholding them.
But of course, they don't have those regulations,

8
9

and there was a holding from this Court, and the practice of

10

the Attorney General, of course, was to look at these things

11

immediately.
Finally — and I end on a weak note here, but

12

13

finally, as to the so-called mushroom problem, I'd like the

14

Court to entertain our argument that the mushroom problem

15

refers not to Pleasant Grove Highlands but to Dolomite.
Dolomite is a very poor area.

16

The city did not

17

want to be in a position where it had to offer services to

18

Dolomite.

19

offering free services to small communities around its

20
21

22
23
24
25

As I've said before, the city has a custom of

borders, when it doesn't have any problem covering its own
area.
Dolomite is a very large community and the city did
want to have to take in Dolomite. And at the time they made
these decisions about the mushroom problem, the mushroom
problem was not directed towards Pleasant Grove Highlands

46
1

because these communities that they were thinking — that

2

they didn't take in didn't abut on — either didn't abut on

3

the Highlands, or two, the Highlands didn't exist at the time

4

the decisions were made.

5

Thank you very much.
