the Government at the Circuit Court level, reversed.

2

Petitioners submit that the Claims Court

3

correctly interprented the implementing agreement on the

4

basis cf its plain language, its structure, and the

5

negotiating history, and therefore we seek reversal cf

6

the judgment below.

7

Analysis of the implementing agreement

8

obviously must begin with the plain language used by the

9

signatories,

as that language is understood in context.

10

The language, we submit, is strikingly favorable tc

11

Petitioners, and provides in relevant part;

12

"United States employees shall be exempt frcir

13

any taxes, fees, or other charges on income received as

14

a result of their work for the Commission ."
No reference appears in that language to

15
16

Panamanian taxes, and it stands is stark contrast tc the

17

other two paragraphs of Article 15.

18

differs significantly from parallel language in Article

19

16 of the agreement in implementation of Article U cf

20

the Panama Canal Treaty, which concerns members of the

21

military .

22

This language also

That provision, which the Government has

23

acknowledged was the model for this one, contains a

24

specific reference to Panamanian law.

25

was deleted,

That reference

for reasons that are not altogether clear.
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

But the inference to be drawn from that has been made

2

clear by this Court’s decisions both in Air France and

3

in Santo Vicenzo that the deletion of language, of

4

parallel language, has meaning.

5

6
7

And the meaning in this instance we submit was
to exempt United States citizens from taxation.
Based on that plain meaning argument, the

8

natural question that will necessarily arise is, why

9

would United

States negotiators agree to exempt United

10

States employees from taxes.

QUESTION;

Mr. Phillips, could

I ask you about

the language of the implementation agreement itself,
which T suppose is where we need to start.
MR.

PHILLIPS;

QUESTION;

Yes, ma’am.

Under your view of it,

U.S.

employees are exempt from taxes by any government cn
income received from their work for the Commission.
MR. FHILLIPS;
QUESTION;

That’s correct.

And likewise from payment of taxes

on income derived from sources outside Panama.
MR. PHILLIPS;
QUESTION;

That's correct.

But I gather under ycur view, if

there were outside income from sources within Panama
there is no exemption and both governments can tax?
MR. PHILLIPS;

Well, our view is that the way

to read the second sentence is to incorporate by the
language "similarly," which is what precedes — which is
what initiates the second sentence.

It says,

"Similarly," that these things are taxed.
And that is derived -- what that refers to,
excuse me, is Commission-related income, that is from
outside —
QUESTION;

So I gather if there were income

earned within Panama that wasn’t earned from the

Right

QUESTION;

I supposed they could, although

would.
And that's a little bizarre, isn't

it?
MR. PHILLIPS;
Your Honor.

Well, not terribly bizarre,

The primary concerns of the negotiators

10

were the sovereignty over the Commission, and so the

11

bilateral agreement not to tax any income either

12

directly or indirectly arising out of work for the

13

Commission was the primary purpose of the agreement and

14

the compromise.

15

The fact that they may have left open one

16

potential for U.S. citizen employees — and this is

17

clearly going to be a very small subset of people who

18

are U.S. citizen employees --

(202) 628-9300

1

language with respect to military personnel.
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, remarkably similar, wouldn’t

you say?

4

MR. FHiLLIPS:

5

QUESTION;

Except for the --

What is your position there?

Is

6

the income of military personnel stationed in Panama

7

subject to U.S. taxation?
MR. FHILLIPS:

8
9

Well, it’s not easy for me to

give a definitive answer on that, because I don’t know

10

about the negotiating history that would have led up to

11

that part of the agreement.

12

however, there is clearly a significant difference

13

between Article 15 implementing Article 3 and Article

14

implementing Article 4.

Based on the language,

15

The second sentence --

16

QUESTION;

16

Well, but the first sentence says:

17

"Members of the forces and dependents," and so forth,

18

"shall be exempt from any taxes, fees, or other charges

19

on income received as a result of their work for the

20

United

21

22
23
24

States forces."
Now, that’s very similar to the language

you're relying on in your case.
MR.

FHILLIPS;

That’s true, Justice C’Connor,

but if you read the next sentence, which is the sentence
»

25

i

that grounds Article 16 into Panamanian law, "Similarly,
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

as provided by Panamanian lav," and then it goes on,

2

that language which grounds the second paragraph of

3

Article 16 to Panama has been deleted from Article 15,

4

thereby taking it away from 'concern specifically with

5

respect to Panama.

6

QUESTION!

But do you take the position, if

7

pressed, that military personnel income is taxable by

8

the United States?

9

MR. FHILLIPS:

My basic position would be that

10

it is clearly a much stronger case for U.S. taxation of

11

the military.

12

that way, because again, even if that language might

13

support no tax exemption, you'd have to go to the

14

negotiating history, and that we don't have before us.

15

In.fact, we're not sure that the Government has ever

16

made the history surrounding Article 16 available.

17

I would not concede that it has to be

QUESTION!

Is there any other place in the

18

world to your knowledge where the United States has

19

agreed to make income received by United States citizen

20

or military personnel not taxable by the United States?

21

MR. PHILLIPS!

Well, the United States has

22

entered into agreements, none cf which have been

23

ultimately ratified by the Senate, that would provide

24

for some bilateral exemptions.

i

But I think the more important point is, I
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

don't think there is anywhere in the world that is like

2

Panama.

The Panama Canal Commission creates its own

3•

income.

This income does not come from the United

4

States Treasury; it comes frcm the Panama Canal

5

Commission's tolls, and it is then paid over to United

6

States employees.

7

The whole point of the negotiations and the

8

compromise during those negotiations was that that kind

9

of income ought to he taxed ty the Panamanians, and the

10
11

United States and Panama compromised on that issue.
QUESTION;

I thought you just did in your

MR. PHILLIPS;

I thought in my response tc

21

Justice CConnor, Justice Scalia, I had indicated that I

thought you cculd incorporate into the second sentence

23

the word "similarly" a limitation on the scope of the

24

second sentence referring to income derived frcm
1

25

i

Commission-related work, but from outside sources; and
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

that that’s a much narrower and clearly less important

provis ion.

3

7

QUESTION;

That’s the weight you’re putting cn

the word "similarly”?
MS. PHILLIPS;

Well, I think it follows.

It’s

a reasonable interpretation of the word "similarly."
QUESTION;

Well, but Mr. Phillips, if that’s

8

the interpretation, then Panama could tax one of these

9

employees’ income from bonds in the United States.

10

you think that's right?

11

read that sentence that way.

12

ME. PHILLIPS:

Panama could do that if you

Except that there's no

13

indication that -- whine it

14

of the treaty, I don’t know that Panama has ever

15

attempted to do that.

QUESTION;

MR.

may be able to as a matter

Mr. Phillips —

FHILLIPS:

And I don’t know that it was a

18

concern to the United States and the Panamanian

19

negotiators.

20
21

22

QUESTION;

Do

I imagine it would be a concern to

one of these employees, though.
QUESTION;

Mr. Phillips, how much income do

23

you suppose there would be that would be covered by your

24

interpretation of the second sentence of paragraph 2 of

25

Article 15?

It’s income derived from their work for the
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Commission, but derived outside the Republic of Panama.
MR. PHILLIPS;

2

Well, I think the best example

3

of it would be the annuitants who had worked on the

4

canal prior tc the treaty, who were then rehired after

5

the treaty, because their income for work on the canal

6

that they receive as annuitants would be from sources

7

outside.
It comes from the United States, but that

8
9

would then be exempt from taxation.

It also makes good

10

policy sense, because usually those are individuals who

11

are very highly skilled technicians in terms cf working

12

at the canal and would have teen heavily sought after.

13

So I think that there is a body of people who fall

14

within that category, and it would have been quite

15

reasonable to try to exempt them.
QUESTION;

16

But do you maintain that, even if

17

the construction that you say should be attached tc the

18

word "similarly" in that sentence would not be adopted,

19

nonetheless it makes seme sense tc say that these

20

people, if they're earning income from bank deposits in

21

the United States, nonetheless should be not taxable on

22

them ?

23

MR. PHILLIPS;

24

QUESTION;

By whom?

By the United States.
1

25

MR. EHILLIPS;

i

As I would understand it, the

United States could

2

interpretation.

3

and say that they are not taxable, that the limitation

4

of "similarly" permits the United States to tax and is

5

only a limitation on Panama, then obviously it is a

6

little skewed .

7

8

tax that income, under my

Now, if you reject my interpretation

That means that income outside the United
States would be taxable.

9

QUESTION;

You say that the United States,

10

under your preferred theory, the United States could tax

11

and Panama could tax income outside, from outside

12

Panama ?

13

MR. PHILLIPS;

14

QUESTION;

15

MR.

16
17

Under my preferred

theory?

Yes.

PHILLIPS;

Yes, that that was not a

serious concern to the Government.
QUESTION;

Why wouldn’t that be a serious

18

concern to the Government?

19

States, that had Zonians who previously had been

20

entirely exempt from Panama

taxes, and you’re saying

21

that what we negotiated for

was above all things to make

22

sure that they couldn’t be taxed on their income from

23

the canal, but we didn’t care whether they could

24

thereafter be taxed by Panama on income from elsewhere.

25

It seems to me that would have it absolutely

upside-down
It’s much more natural to allow them to be

3

taxed for their income from the canal than to allow

4

Fanama to tax them on income from elsewhere.

5

to me much more an assertion of --

6

MR. FHILLIPS;

That seems

But Justice Scalia , the problem

7

with the alternative interpretation is that then you

8

have to go back and say, well, what does the first

9

sentence mean?

And it is the first sentence that was

10

clearly uppermost in the minds of the negotiators in

11

1977.

12

And under the alternative, any ether

13

alternative interpretation of the second sentence that

14

forces the United States — that allows the United

15

Statesm to tax this income, you have to assume that the

16

negotiators for Panama receded, they gave up, they

17

caved, even though it had been described to the United

18

States as essentially a treaty-buster if the sovereignty

19

of Panama was not recognized.

20

The debates leading up to the final agreement

21

consistently — and most of

22

— indicate that they would not be able to reach an

23

agreement unless the sovereign concerns of Panama were

24

taken into account.

25

them come from Minister Royo

So that any other interpretation of Article 1
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

means that somewhere between the last messages we have

2

on the subject and the final agreement, without any

3

indication that Panama would give it up, had completely

4

abandoned its interest in this.
It makes much more sense to assume that a

5

6

compromise was reached, that the concerns of the

7

negotiators for the United States were not based on tax

8

policy; they were based on diplomatic and political

9

concerns.

Those negotiators, who are diplomats and not

10

tax lawyers, had one uppermost, or two uppermost

11

considerations.

12

The first one was that they be able to get

13

this treaty through the Congress, which they could net

14

do if Panama was allowed to tax these citizens; and two,

15

that they not be in a position where this would cause a

16

precedent for future negotiations with respect to the

17

issue of taxation.
QUESTION!

10

It was clearly chosen to provide a bilateral

And the language deleted from the second

11

sentence, which would have made it refer to Panamanian

12

law, was deleted; and that deletion was significant, and

13

from that we can immediately support that basic plain

14

meaning argument, that a bilateral tax exemption was

15

supplied here.

16

To demonstrate the merit of that

17

interpretation, based on the traditional standards of

18

interpretation, one need only look at what the

19

Government relies upon for its position in this case.

20

Interestingly, it never even cites the Restatement

21

Second of Foreign Relations Law, which provides a set of

22

traditional criteria ordinarily employed in order to

23

reach an understanding as to what the parties

objectively had intended.

MR. PHILLIPS:

The most recently filed

Yes.
— from the official.

Yes.
Well, we have never received a

copy of it, sc it's difficult to make that ccncession.
:We also sought to find it published in the TIAS and have

16

not been able to find it there, either.

So it's

17

difficult for us to knew, you know, to concede that

18

point.
It would have been easier, obviously, if it

19

20

had been supplied to the Claims Court sc that at the

21

trial level those matters could have been resolved.

because what you have to do is assume that the

2

Government may have heen acting tc a certain extent in

3

bad faith and I can’t do that.

4

And the whole point of the problem with

5

respect to that note is that the Government never

6

brought it to the Claims Court’s attention through the

7

ordinary rules of litigation, which is Rule 60(b), sc

8

that its authenticity could have been established.

9

QUESTION;

Hell, I grant you that that’s

10

frustrating,

but it would be helpful to know whether ve

11

have to be concerned with its authenticity in your

12

view.
MR. PHILLIPS;

13

Hell, in this instance you’re

14

saved the burden of having to worry about that, because

15

even the note under any circumstances, that note cannot

16

serve as a legitimate basis for interpreting the

17

treaty.

18

In the first place, the most that you can

19

derive from the note is that what it says Panama

20

believes the treaty means now, which is eight years

21

after the fact and is therefore very little evidence of

22

what the parties intended in 1977.

23

Second, the circum stances underlying the note,

24

the letters themselves which purport to serve as the

25

basis for the interpretation, are particularly

individuals who did not directly negotiate Article 15,

1

OS BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

2
3

NR. GANZFRIED;

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;

4

The question in this case is simply whether

5

Petitioners have to pay federal income taxes, just like

6

all the rest of us, or whether they alone amcng all the

7

citizens employed by the United States Government and

8

its agencies at home and abroad, they alone are exempt

9

from United States taxation.

10

Now, when

we clear away the smoke and we put

11

away the mirrors of Petitioners* argument, several

12

simple points remain and they are dispositive of this

13

case.

14

The first is that

when the language of the

15

agreement is read in context Petitioners* ccnstructicn

16

is implausible.

17

Second, the consistent and uniform

18

construction of the executive branch is that there is no

19

exemption from United States taxes.

20

Third, the executive branch’s view was

21

authoritatively communicated to the Senate at the time

22

of ratification on behalf of the offices cf the State

23

and Defense Departments that were responsible for

24

negotiating and drafting the treaty.
*

25

«

The same position was adopted and restated in

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the Senate report, and the consistent administrative

2

practice of every affected executive branch department

3

-- the State Department, the Department of Treasury, and

4

the Internal Revenue Service -- also reflects that same

5

interpretation, namely no exemption from U.S. taxes.

6

In addition to that, both governments that

7

signed the treaty and its implementing agreements concur

8

in the interpretation that we present.
And finally, the 1976 tax reform till now

9
10

awaiting the President's signature restates and

11

reconfirms that Petitioners are not exempt from United

12

States taxes.
In short, the correct result in this case

13
14

could scarcely be clearer.

15

sole responsibility in this area, to give effect to the

16

intent of the parties, this Court should reject

17

MR. GAHZFBIEDs

2

Well, I think I should get

3

4

issue of United States taxation or exemption from United

5

States taxation was never a part of the discussions

6

leading up to the treaty and the implementation

7

agreements .
As a result, the Claims Court essentially

8
9

required the Government to prove a negative, namely to

10

point to a place in the negotiating history where

11

somebody would say, we are not discussing the following

12

subject.

13

That was an impossible situation.
Inasmuch as the question of an exemption from

14

United States taxation was not a part of the discussion,

15

we could not say to the Claims Court that it was a

16

subject on which the Panamaian Government had ever

17

expressed a view to us in any formal sense.

18

But what we did knew was that the agreement

19

had never incorporated any agreement to exempt anyone

20

from United States taxation, certainly not U.S. citizens

21

employed by the Commission.

mean that there would be an exemption for anything else

reconfirms and restates with all the precision and

there really isn’t any serious doubt that as a matter cf

domestic law there is no exemption from U.S. taxation,

none was intended, and none was created.

CARTER G. PHILLIPS, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

11
12

13

You

MR. FHILLIPS:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just a

couple points.
First, Mr. Ganzfried consistently tells the

14

Court that the negotiating history preceding this

15

agreement contains no discussion of United States

16

domestic taxation.

17

he discusses the tax credit issue.

But at the very end of his comments

18

When the United States responded to a proposal

19

for a domestic tax credit, the United States negotiators

20

didn’t savi

21

taxes with foreign governments.

22

23

consistent with cur view that the sovereignty concerns

24

that were paramount among the State diplomats were

concerns
As Mr. Oanzfried said, this was not a tax

2
3

proposal.

These were not tax lawyers who negotiated

4

this treaty.
Second, with respect to Justice White's

5

6

question concerning who has — to whom is deference owed

7

with respect to the operation of the treaty, there is

8

evidence from the Panama Canal Commission supervisory

9

board that it did understand this treaty to provide a

10

bilateral tax exemption.
That board denied

11

a cost of living increase to

12

all of these employees in part, by the foreign minister

13

who presented this note to the United States, for

14

reasons that he said clearly; that there’s an exemption

15

already for U.S. taxes; they are not entitled to any

16

additional allowances, they don’t need that; they've

17

gotten all of the protection they have.

18

of living adjustment was denied, largely cn the basis cf

19

that.

20

24

So the only agency that really does implement
this particular agreement has reached that ccnclusicn.
QUESTION;

QUESTION;

Do you in your brief identify

specifically the material in the negotiating history,

page by page, in the record that you think best supports

your position?
MR. PHILLIPS;

Yes, Justice White.

materials —

MR. PHILLIPS;

In the O’Connor brief.

There

is an extensive discussion, with very clear quotations

from Minister Royo setting out specifically the

this was in fact.
