MR. GRISwOLD;

7

that calls upon the issuer to perform under an

Company just kept the monthly payments and took them to

16

MR. GRISWOLD.

It is my view that there is

17

nothing that the holder could do except to sue Ginnie

18

19

in the now United States Claims Court because of a

20

contractual obligation of the United States to the

MR. GRISWOLD;

yes.

Ginnie Mae can remove the issuer. It can require
