CONSTANCE E. BROOKS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

MS. BROOKS;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
This case is governed by the principles that

10

were established by this Court in Wygant versus Jackson

11

Board of Education, that before embarking upon a

12

voluntary affirmative action program a public employer

13

must have convincing evidence that remedial action is

14

warranted and, finding that convincing evidence, develop

15

a remedy which is narrowly tailored.

16

In this case, we have neither ccnvincing

17

evidence that there was a remedial purpose nor was this

18

remedy narrowly tailored when the Santa Clara County

19

Transportation Agency deprived Petitioner Paul Johnson

20

of a well-earned promotion.

21

First, again, in the ideal world, before

22

developing a program an employer would look at his work

23

force statistics, compare them with the relevant labor

24

market, consider if there was other probative evidence

25

of discrimination, and finally, as a third step,

1

eliminate explanations other than discrimination, and

2

these are the kind of explanations that an employer

3

would ordinarily consider in rebutting a Title 7 case.

4

But even if the employer doesn't do this at

5

the outset, the employer could certainly do that when

6

the program and an employment action taken under it is

7

challenged.
The agency neither went through the process at

8

9

the beginning nor was the agency able to come forward

10

with convincing evidence cf remedial purpose.

19

that imbalance if in fact it is the result of

discrimination.

First of all --

21

So you say just statistical

QUESTION:

2

Do you agree that if the employer

has a firm basis for believing remedial action is

necessary, because otherwise the employer is likely to

Title 1, that that justifies or can justify taking

7

affirmative action?
MS. BROOKS:

8

9

Yes, Your Honor.

But I would

equate that firm basis with convincing evidence.

And

10

what we would require, and which I think is what was the

11

problem here, is that the employer in developing that

12

firm basis needs to consider why its statistics are what

13

they are.
And there were a number of explanations

And you think that is not enough

2

for the employer to think that there might be a firm

NS. BROOKS:

In this case no, because, first

trial, it was conceded that the reason you had zero

22

NS. BROOKS:

Your Honor, when the agency

23

developed its program and when this case was tried there

24

was no evidence of what the relevant labor pool was.

25

And in fact,

the agency relied entirely on the

We offered a Petitioner’s lodging showing that

was only five percent?

7

MS. BROOKS;

No, Your Honor.

The goal set at

8

the time the Petitioner was denied the promotion was

9

36.4 percent.

They didn’t institute those short term

10

goals until after Petitioner filed suit against the

11

agency .

12

13
14

At the time Petitioner lost his promotion, the
goal was 36.4 percent.
QUESTION;

That’s the goal on which we have to

test this case?

We have to compare it with the 36

21

there was a provision in the plan that said if there are

22

any substantial work pools, such as 238 skilled craft

Would that also be equally invalid?

appropriate to have these employees moving up through

MS. 3R0QKS;

QUESTION;

You think Weber, the Weber case,

affirmative action program.

We were in a second plan.

They already had it in place for three years and they

7

the promotion.
I think, that there are a lot of other narrower

8
9

tailoring aspects to the plan that are troublesome, arid

10

this really focuses on the fact that we’re dealing with

11

a promotion rather than hiring.
That is, the plan applied employment goals and

12
13

doesn’t take into account that there might be other,

14

less intrusive measures to bring women into the work

15

force.

16

we’re not challenging many aspects of this plan that had

17

good affirmative action programs.

18

We already know from the plan -- and indeed

We are challenging the application of an

19

employment goal that applied throughout the work force.

20

And I think there are some aspects of the plan that

21

illustrate how difficult it was.

22

It's a broad plan.

It seeks to achieve racial

23

and sexual parity in each job classification.

24

goes into substantial detail in order to achieve this

25

balance for every ethnic group, by Filipinos and by

That an affirmative action plan

MS. WQODSIDE;

MR. WOODS IDE :

5

If I may, Your Honor, the suggestion that's

Yes.

6

made by the Petitioner's counsel, for the first time in

7

this case, is that the relevant labor pool was seven

8

percent or five percent as she stated in the reply

9

brief.

If that is the case — and it's too bad that

10

that was not litigated at trial or not even mentioned at

11

the Court of Appeals.
But if that is the case, then it's clear from

12

13

those numbers alone that tnere would have been a case of

14

discrimination against the agency.

15

between zero, which is what we have here, and five

16

percent or seven percent or any of the higher figures

17

makes us vulnerable to a charge of discrimination and

18

gives us good cause, it seems to me, to take remedial

19

action.

QUESTION:

The difference

Without even considering at all

21

whether you can bring forward any patently valid

22

justification for the statistical discrepancy, for

craft or this particular area?

MR. WOQDSIDEi

I think that your cases held

3

that in the context of the problem that we have here is

4

that where there is a firm basis upon which an employer

can infer that its own practices may have been

discriminatory, then the employer can voluntarily take

affirmative action which is not victim-specific.

I don’t think the case law says

it has to be particularly egregious.

there would be a prima facie case of discrimination, the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF

20

CONSTANCE E. BROOKS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

21

22

MS. BROOKS:

I just have a few points to

23

respond to.

I think that the facts of this case show

24

why we would suggest that an employer has to show more

25

than a prima facie case before he adopts a voluntary

affirmative action plan.
And by a prima facie case, I'm talking about a

2
3

naked statistical balance, because here the agency

4

clearly never went behind and considered

5

women had ever applied.

6

whether no

It's not quite correct to say that Petitioner

7

didn't ask for applicant flow data.

It was requested

8

during discovery and ve were told it wasn't available

9

because the county never got the computer program.

10

That's really not here or there, but I do want to make

11

it clear that we did look for applicant flow data and

12

were told it just wasn't available.
QUESTIONi

13

Ms. Brooks, can you explain one

14

thing to me?

15

make whether the proper proportion in this particular

16

labor pool, if we're claying statistics, was 30 percent

17

or 5 ?

18

I'm a little -- what difference does it

What difference does it make?

Inasmuch as

19

there were no women in this job category at the time

20

anyway, even if the percentage were, the proper

21

percentage were 5 percent instead of 30 percent,

22

presumably in implementing the affirmative action plan

23

the employer would have been justified in preferring

24

this woman.

25

MS. BROOKS;

We don't agree that the employer

would have been justified in preferring the woman,

2

because if you look at the road dispatcher job you had

3

20 percent of the employees, 3 out of 18, were already

4

women at the time.

5

applied.

So the plan should never have

But if you look at the plan in general, the

6
7

fact that they never looked for a relevant labor market

8

gees to the overall crudity of the affirmative action

9

plan.

10

You don't have an employer here who made a good

faith effort to develop a plan.
You have an employer who basically looked at

11
12

the overall population, slapped some number in, and then

13

went forward, again without taking into account the

14

rights of the other employees.

15

relevant, because this plan

16

with respect

is facially discriminatory

to all of the unprotected employees.

QUESTION;

17

That’s why it's

You don’t believe there's a

18

harmless error rule?

19

had used the right percentages, an affirmative action

20

plan based on that would have justified preference to

21

this -MS. BBDOKS;

22

That is, that even if the employer

Not in this case, because there

23

are other explanations for the statistical disparity.

24

And in fact, you find these in the county’s own

25

documents.

They admit that they attribute the lack of

2

it to societal attitudes.

3

And I don't think

they attribute

that this Court has ever

held that women will necessarily occupy the same jobs in

5

direct proportion to their representation in the working

6

force.

7

prefer things differently.

8

always good,

I think itrs rather obvious that women and men

9

I’m not saying that that’s

but attitudes based on sex are different.

And I think it’s an important factor here that

10

you have women applying for non-traditional jobs in the

11

transit agency and getting them.

12

hiring in terms of women bus drivers and women utility

13

workers, which was the position below becoming a

14

mechanic.

15

You had extensive

I think what you have here is an explained

16

statistical disparity in that women were going into

17

other jobs and choosing not to work for the roads

18

division, where you had fewer openings and less future

19

opportunity for advancement.

20

But we don’t know, because this agency never

21

looked and never considered other alternatives than

22

their assumption that they discriminated.

23

that's wrong and that’s why you should have more than

24

just a prima facie case when we talk about convincing

25

evidence that it is appropriate to go into a voluntary
