and there are many Court of Appeals cases where in an

instance, usually an off-duty instance and many times in

an off-base instance where in order tc define a concept

out what the rule is there for and whether or not it

We do not believe that the fact that the Court

has taken that approach and other courts have taken that

It is our position, and I think it is clear,

that where an injury does arise incident to service, as

18

is the fact here, when we have a Coast Guard person sent

19

on a military rescue mission, in that situation it is

20

easy to say that that is incident to service and there

21

is no need to go beyond the basic rule in order to

22

determine the outcome.

Now, in passing, I would like to note that

24

this is a case which, if a case by case approach were

proper, we think it clear that suit would in fact be

arguments raised

appeals, because of the alleged civilian tort feasor or

in every case, as respondents argue,

to do, where it won’t be possible to raise questions

about military authority.

I think is an impact on discipline.

QUESTION;

7

Mr. Eaton, I don’t think I read the

Shearer case the same way you do, but as I recall the

part of Shearer that’s talking about Feres repeats the

10

holding, and then as a quotation saying that the best

12

opinion.
MR. EATON;

Feres.

The distinction I am going to draw between

17

Feres, Shearer, this court’s incident to service tests

18

on the one hand and the facts in this case on the other

19

hand are that this is not an essentially intra-military

4

Cour t * s cases .

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. EATON;

Why do you say that?
Because Brooks, Feres and Brown

7

taken together are the three decisions that the lower

8

courts hve struggled with in an effort to come up with

9

some kind of a definable hold as to what those three

10
11

12
13

decisions mean.
QUESTION;

Well, are you saying then that

Brooks and Brown in effect partly repudiated Feres?
MR. EATON;

No, Your Honor.

The three cases

14

are consistent.

15

partly repudiate some of the rationales advanced for the

16

Feres doctrine in the Feres case.

17

The thing that Brown did, however, was

The Feres case came up with the notion that

18

there's no parallel private liability, for example.

19

That notion was repudiated later by this Court in the

20

Indian Towing case and the Bayonnear, Inc. versus United

21

States case, and it clearly no longer survives.

22

The VA benefits rationale,

which was

23

articulated in ^eres, does not survive Brown because

24

Brown says, even though this man gets VA benefits, it's

25

not an exclusive remedy.

That didn't survive Brown.

11

of those cases were essentially servicemen versus

13

The incident to service line was meant to draw

14

a principled line between two types of servicemen versus

15

servicemen cases, and the facts in this particular case

16

were not contemplated at the time, in my judgment.

17

Those two groups of servicemen versus servicemen cases

18

were those which were incident to service and those

19

which were not, and this Court apparently felt that

20

those servicemen versus servicemen cases which arose out

21

of a military man’s official duties which were incident

22

to his service would, if allowed to be maintained,

QUESTION;

Mr. Eaton, can I ask you if your

government when the tort feasor is a serviceman,

those where the tort feasor is not, where do you

classify a case in which the tort feasor is an employee,

a civilian employee of the Defense Department, for

and

You can make a very good argument

21

in those cases that they ought to be treated the same

22

way the Eleventh Circuit treated the FAA in this case.

Wherever there are civilians, you don't have a military

disciplinary rationale problem.

25

On the other hand, the lower court —

MR. EATON:

On the other hand, the lower court

7

lumped those particular cases in what it called the

Feres factual paradigm, serviceman versus serviceman, or

9

serviceman versus employee of the military.

To the

10

extent that an employee is integrated into the military

11

structure, there is probably good reason for fear that

12

the military disciplinary structure will be implicated

13

if you allow those kind of suits.

14

But, by giving away that point, and it can be

MR. EATON;

What T think that page means and the way the

3

lower court read it, and the way lower courts have

4

consistently read this Court's Feres cases up until that

5

footnote was penned, means essentially this;

6

other rationales, the VA benefits rationale, the

7

distinctively federal relationship, the different state

8

laws and those things are no longer controlling of the

9

issue of whether Feres -- by themselves, are no longer

that the

controlling of the issue of

the primary reason must exist, the primary reason being

whether Feres applies to bar

Let me explain what T think the military

15

disciplinary rationale means, because this is probably

16

the most critical question that the Court will have to

17

face in this case, and I don't think the government has

18

fairly represented really what the problem is.

19

The government has suggested that when the

20

court, any civilian court passes judgment on a decision

21

by a member of the military or some action on the part

22

of the military, any judgment or any decision of that

23

sort, that it has no business doing that and that Feres

bars inquiry into those kinds of decisions and that
