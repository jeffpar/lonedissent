It didn't survive Step 2?
It did not survive Step 2.

QUESTION!

Hell, wouldn’t it perhaps be

2

appropriate even if you are correct to remand Ms.

3

Yuckert’s claim at least, leave it open in light of the

4

new guidelines?

5

MS. KNEEDLER;

I think not, because

6

applying -- first of all, we would have a concern there

7

about courts sending cases back in light of the new

8

ruling because it suggests the potential for reopening a

9

lot of past claims, even those that are not currently

10

surviving, and in our view because the ruling did not

11

change the substantive standard of disability, there is

12

no occasion to send it back.

I am having trouble finding it.

MR. KN'EZDLER:

Do you

It is in the Appendix to cur

certiorari petition at Pages -- beginning on Page 37A.

5

On Page 41A the Secretary explains that the

6

standard is that a claim will be not severe if it would

7

have no more than a minimal effect on an individual’s

8

ability to work even if his age, education, and work

9

experience were specifically considered, that is, that

10

the person's impairment would have no more than a

11

minimal effect on his physical or mental abilities to

12

perform basic work activities.

13

If we look at the preamble to the notice of

14

proposed rulemaking in 1978, that is exactly the

15

description of the severity regulation itself, not the

16

ruling but the {regulation itself that the Secretary

17

gave, sc this does not establish new ground.

MR. KNEEDLER;

the portion of the preamble to the 1937 -- yes, it is on

Page 9296 of the Federal Register from 1978.

24

How does that language go?

Frankly, the fact that the Secretary said in issuing

this interpretive ruling that he was making no change

does not mean that he vas making no change.

me that is not something he can make happen ty just

4

saying it has happened.

MR. KNEEDLER:

It seems to

Well, in terms of what the

6

department's official position and what the regulation

7

meant, now, if there were individual applications of the

8

regulatio during the interval in which ALJs had

misapplied it, that Is a different question, but we are

10

talking about what the substantive legal —

11

QUESTION:

No, if in fact he meant something

12

earlier and he now says, no, what I meant all along was

13

something different, he can't change what the past was.

14

MB. KNEEDLER:

Well, in the preamble in 1978

15

the Secretary explained it,

16

range of impairment severity below which the effects of

17

the impairment have such a minimal effect on the

18

individual that they would not be expected to interfere

19

with his or her ability to work irrespective of his age,

20

education, or work experience.

Mr. Kneedler, the hard thing about

past but nevertheless could be as a matter of law

that is spelled out in the --

10

Even though it is clear that it

impairs her from doing a particular job, but that is not
necessarily --

11

MR, KNEEDLER:

Yes,

Now, the most recent

12

ruling does identify an accommodation of the past work

13

principle.

14

premise is that the definition of a nonsevere impairment

15

is one that dees not significantly limit the ability to

16

do basic work activities that are necessary for most

17

jobs, so the assumption is,

19

do most jobs, and therefore would be able to do her own

allows the sequential evaluation process to progress

beyond that point.

No, only under the new ruling --

But then it isn't related to the

uniqueness of the job.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

is not related, and this is

spelled out in the sequential evaluation process, and

would point out that that was well known to Congress at

the time that Congress ratified --

QUESTION;

But you say the regulation can

still be dispositive in a nonunique job such as this.
MR. KNEEDLER;

Yes.

Yes, because the premise

of the regulation is that the claimant has the ablility

10

to do basic work functions necessary for most jobs to

11

stand, to — or that that is not signficantly affected.

MR. KNEEDLER;

Then she would.

If there is

any one -- if there is any one of the job requirements

19

20

jobs that she can't do she would pass beyond Step 2.

Well, I think -- see, I am puzzled

as to this case whether she lost because cf the severity-

QUESTION:

work, and the ALJ also noted in

You mean she was denied cn the

8

basis of ability to do her last work.

Did you state it

9

correctly, or did I misunderstand it?

She was denied on

10

the basis that she, was even able to do her past work,

11

wasn't she?

12

MR. KNEEDLER;

The ALJ did not rest it at Step

13

4 of the sequential evaluation process, but when he said

14

she is able tc do basic work activities he said, for

15

example, real estate salesperson, so I think this case

16

is a good example of how the regulation does not

17

unfairly weed out people who would be weeded out later

18

on.

19

The materials that we cite in Footnote

11 of

20

our reply brief show extensive Congressional awareness

21

of how this regulation works, including the explanation

22

that as more people were screened out on the nonsevere

23

step, fewer were screened out on the basis that they

could do their past work.

QUESTION;

If a pilot should have 20-20 but

He could be, although the

15

MR. KHEEDLER;

Why would he?
Well, I think in every case he

16

will be found not disabled at that stage, too, because

17

he would not have an impairment that has significantly

18

affected his ability to do all the other jobs in the

19

national economy.

but

1

this point, because whatever the prior law might have

2

been, Congress ratified the current severity regulations

3

when it enacted the 1584 Act.

And this is clear from

4

looking at the text of the provision that, was added in

5

1984, which is bn Page 27 of our brief.

6

The first sentence of that says -- first of

7

all, the purpose of the 1984 amendments was to require

8

the Secretary to consider the combined effect of

9

multiple impairments, but Congress otherwise left the

10

sequential evaluation process untouched, and that

11

appears -- the significance of that appears in the very

12

language Congress used in the Act.

13

It says, "in determining whether an

14

individual's physical or mental impairments are

15

sufficient medical sevrity that they could be the basis

16

of a finding of eligiblity, the Secretary will consider

17

the comined effect."

18

says medical severity, and it states it in terms of

19

whether it could be a basis of eligibility,

20

language of a threshold test.

21

says, if the Secretary does find a medically severe

22

combination of impairments, he will consider that

23

combination throughout the disability determination

24

process, in other words, throughout the subsequent steps

25

of the sequential evaluation process.

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that a different

question than asking whether the person can perform his
or her old job?

MS. GROSSMAN:

It is the preliminary question

to the ultimate determination of whether or not the

7

person c-an perform any work in the national economy.

8

The cases which have interpreted the Act, all 12

9

circuits have interpreted the Act to show, to require

10

the claimant to prove that they could not dc their prior

11

work.

12

Once that showing is made, there is an

13

evidentiary shift of burdens to the Secretary to produce

14

evidence that there is other work in the national

15

economy which the claimant can do.

That is no exception at all.

stops you from doing your current job, it qualifies.

therefore the conflict between the regulation and the

The Tenth Circuit has

The First Circuit has read 3528 as an

indication that the Secretary has changed his policy and

11

says that if there hadn’t been that change there would

12

be a serious Question in the circuit’s mind, whether or

13

not more judicial interference were necessary, but the

14

First Circuit, it is important to note, reads 3528

15

consistent with a de minimis standard insofar as it says

16

that if a claimant cannot do their prior work, then it

17

does not matter the particular level of severity that

claimant is entitled to an evaluation under the Act.

19

The Secretary in his reply brief has repudiated that

That's correct.

And you are telling me that at the

time the Secretary was using a particular system to

determine medical severity which the Congress presumably

knew about and it was not that system that the *84

amendment meant to approve but the system that had

previously existed in

MS. GROSSMAN:

They -- the conferees noted

that the Secretary was in the middle of reevaluating the

criteria.

that this reevalaution be done expeditiously.
