ORAL ARGUMENT OF WENDELL R.

BIRD, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

8

MR. BIRD:

9

3ird,

We vill hear

please

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it

the Court:
This case is an appeal from an

11

Court of

Appeals for the

8-7 decision cf

12

the U.S.

Fifth Circuit.

13

involves a facial Constitutional challenge to

14

Louisiana's law for balanced treatment of creation

15

science and evolution in public schools.

It

That law defines evolution as scientific

16
17

evidences supporting evolution, and

18

those scientific evidences.
In

19

inferences from

parallel, it defines creation science as

20

scientific evidences supporting creation, and inferences

21

from those scientific evidences.
The State today hopes to address two key

22
23

questions:

first, the procedural question of the

24

material factual issues, and particularly, the

25

uncontroverted affidavits, which must be addressed in

order to apply the tripart test# and which preclude

2

summary judgment; and then, second, the Ccnstitutiona1

3

question, particularly of the abundant evidence in the

4

record of a secular purpose, although not an exclusively

5

secular purpose, we concede.
I'll mention the relevant facts in connection

6
7

with each of these two major issues.
The first major question is the procedural

8
9

question which the State believes should be decisive.

10

The decision under review contradicts the unquestioned

11

procedural rule for summary judgment regarding

12

uncontradicted affidavits and material factual issues,

13

as the seven dissenting judges acknowledged.
The uncontroverted factual issues of the State

(Laughter.)

6

MR. BIRD;

7
8
9
10
11

Yes, Your Honor, that's

correct.

3
4

SR. BIRD:

And in

this case, they certainly

upheld that tradition.
The uncontroverted affidavits of the State on
factual issues erroneously were not taken as true or
admitted for purposes of summary judgment and appeal.
The other factual issues raised by the State

12

in its Brandeis memorandum of 630 pages, with nearly

13

2,000 citations, were not viewed in the most favorable

14

liaht, like the affidavits,

15

given credence at all.

16

as true for purposes of summary judgment.

and in fact, were hardly

They certainly weren’t accepted

17

The facts in regard to this procedural issue

18

are that the State filed affidavits by creationist and

19

evolutionist scientists; by a creationist philosopher;

20

an evolutionist theologian;

21

22
23
24
25

and a creationist educator.

They were not only Protestants, but two Roman
Catholics and one agnostic.
QUESTION;

Hr. Bird, what would you say was

the factual issue that had to be resolved?
MR. BIRD;

Your Honor, the definition of

creation science is one very important factual issue,

2

what the statute’s about.
QUESTION;

3
4

You don’t think the statute defines

the term adequately?
MR. BIRD;

5

Well, Your Honor, it does give a

6

definition that’s highly scientific, and

7

to scientific evidences, and inferences from those

8

scientific evidences.
QUESTION:

referring only

But the factual issue was, what

10

does -- what does the statutory term mean, is that what

11

it is?

12
13
14

MR. BIRD:

Yes, sir.

A very important factual

issue in order -QUESTION:

And these people, whc had nothing

15

to do with enacting the statute, are able to tell us

16

what the statute means?

17

MR. BIRD:

Because it is bringing a term from

18

a technical term into a statute, yes, Your Honor, much

19

like in some of the technical regulatory statutes that

20

might take a

21

attempting to give a plenary definition in the statute.

22

term of art from another field without

And besides the definition, another factual

23

issue is the religious — the nonreligious nature of

24

that scientific evidence supporting creation.

25

And a third factual issue, the scientific

nature of creation science as compared with evolution.
QUESTION:

2

Why is the meaning of the statute a

3

factual issue?

4

issue.

5

abstained from passing on the Constitutionality of

6

statutes until the State courts could tell us what their

7

own statute meant?

8
9
10

I would think that that’s a legal

And indeed, haven't we in earlier cases

Isn’t the meaning cf it ultimately a question
of Louisiana law for the Louisiana courts?
MR. BIRD;

Your Honor, taking those questions

11

in reverse, the Louisiana Supreme Court has reviewed

12

this statute on different grounds, and has upheld it

13

under applicable provisions of the Louisiana

14

Constitution regarding prescribing curriculum.

15

It did not see fit to give a definition of

16

creation science, or even to indicate that it regarded

17

that as within its prerogatives.

18

I’d suggest —

19

QUESTION:

As within its prerogative?

20

whose prerogatives would it be, if not within the

21

prerogatives of the Louisiana Supreme Court?

22

MR. BIRD:

Within

Because a term that is a technical

23

term, a term used within the scientific field, was being

24

embodied in the statute, the State submits. Your Honor,

25

that the definition of that term is a factual matter,

9

So if we, as a Feder al court, say

that the Louisiana statute means X, the L ouisiana

10

11

HR. BIRD;

12

Well, Y our Honor, I would suggest,

13

in the context of the proced ural issue, t hat this Court

14

should not be saying, the st atute means X , but instead,

15

than the Louisiana courts?

21

And why is that our bus in ess rather

MR . BIRD;

Your Ho nor, with all respect, what

22

we would like you to say is that this Cou rt should not

23

have to say whether it means X or Y, but that a trial,

with factual development, ou ght to occur to enable

25

expert witnesses on both sid es to give de finitions.

After which — after which a

Federal court will say whether it means X or Y.

3

that what you're saying?
MR. BIRD:

Not quite, Your Honor, because a

Federal court —
QUESTION;

You're just quarreling that it was

done too soon; not that it shouldn't be dene by Federal

8

courts.

9

MR. BIRD;

Your Honor, I'm suggesting —

10

QUESTION;

And I'm questioning whether —

11

MR. BIRD:

-- that the only thing a Federal

12

court ought tc do is review whether the factual

13

determination by the trial court, after a trial, is

14

clearly erroneous.
This Court, in Lynch v. Donnelly, used the

15
16

clearly erroneous standard in reviewing district court

17

findings.

18

same thing in footnote 11, recognizing the heavily

19

factual issue of many issues of that nature.

20

And in fact, the dissenting opinion did the

The role of this Court, the State would

21

suggest, is not to determine, as the two lower courts

22

did, out of thin air, what a technical term means, but

23

to recognize that that is a factual issue, or at least

24

involved factual issues that this Court is entitled to a

25

trial record cn before this Court is asked tc apply the

clearly erroneous standard.
QUESTION;

What if Louisiana chooses to use a

3

technical term in an inaccurate sense?

4

if it wants to?

5

6
7

NR. BIRD;

Can it do that

A State certainly could use a term

and define it differently.
QUESTION;

Of course it could.

And isn't it

8

up to Louisiana State court to say whether it’s using a

9

technical term accurately or inaccurately?

10
11

It could use

that term any way it wants, couldn’t it?
HR. BIRD;

Your Honor, recognizing the

12

correctness of your point about. State interpretations of

13

terms that have a -- have a State law background behind

14

them, the term in this statute was a term borrowed from

15

a technical field .

16

And it's our suggestion that the trier of

17

fact, at the trial court level, can correctly determine

18

the meaning of that term, based on the legislative

19

history and expert testimony, whether that trier of fact

20

is a State court or a Federal court.

21

QUESTION;

Well, Nr. Bird,

I understood the

22

opinion of the Fifth Circuit, from which you're

23

appealing, to say that the statute was unconstitutional

24

because it had no secular purpose, and it failed that

25

part of the so-called Lemon

test.
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Is it really necessary to get into all this

2

meaning of technical terms in order to review that what

3

seems to be a rather narrow ruling of the Fifth Circuit?

4

NR. BIRD;

Well, Ycur Honor, first, I think

5

it's very important to notice that the Fifth Circuit and

6

the District Court did not rely at all on the

7

legislative history in reaching that determination.

8
9

They instead said, effectively by judicial
notice we submit, creation science means X.

It means

10

religious doctrine including a creator.

11

any factual evidence in the record, but just a priori.

12

And consequently,

Not based cn

those courts were not even

13

applying the purpose prong of the establishment clause

14

test in the way that this Court has indicated it should

15

be applied.

16

QUESTION:

Well, Nr. Bird, if we were to do

17

that here, wouldn't we just look at the legislative

18

history and the stated purpose of the legislature in

19

making that determination?

20

Why would we have to perpetuate the alleged

21

error you think was made below?

22

the record here and determine whether the court was

23

correct in its decision on the purpose prong of the

24

Lemon test?

25

MR. BIRD:

Why couldn't we look at

Your Honor, that might be possible
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

given two caveats
The first is that the legislative history does

3

involve technical terms of science, not only terms such

4

as creation science and

5

also terms about mathematical probability, paleontology,

6

and so forth.

7

creation and their meaning, but

This Court could assume that all of the

8

State’s allegations are correct on those factual issues,

9

and in that context, could interpret the legislative

10
11

history, including those terms.
Now, the appellees are also arguing that the

12

social context is relevant to a determination of

13

legislative purpose.

14

particularly where there is a clear legislative history

15

and where there is a clear statute.

16

We do disagree with that,

However, addressing the social context

17

involves questions of history which similarly are

1.8

factual issues.

19

My second caveat is, if this Court were to

20

apply the purpose prong of the tripartite test, ab

21

initio, it again ought to determine all historical,

22

factual type questions in the light most favorable to

23

the State, just as it should the definitional questions.

24

In that sense, it might be possible for this

25

Court to reach a purpose determination based on a full
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

review of the record.
I*d urge the Court not to do so.

Because

3

certainly for effect and entanglement, the definitions

4

of terms are highly critical .

5

But if the Court did so, I — I would urge

6

this Court to give the kind cf full review of the

7

legislative history I know it would.

8
9

We have, for the convenience of the Court, in
our reply brief, footnotes 56a to 56c, cited some of the

10

most important portions of the legislative history on

11

the purpose to advance academic freedom, students right

12

to hear, by teaching additional scientific information,

13

a nonreligious information.

14
15
16

It's critical that the legislative history be
read in context.
It’s also critical that the standard applied

17

by this Court, at all times in the past for purpose

18

review, be applied; that it is not necessary to have an

19

exclusively secular purpose; but instead, it is

20

sufficient to have a secular purpose.

21

In fact, I think, the legislative history in

22

this case indicates a primary secular purpose, although

23

the State does recognize that there are tertiary

24

religious purposes indicated in the record.

25

We would suggest that the appellees highly

QUESTION;

2
3

Rhat are those reliqious that you

acknowledge are indicated in the record?

4

HR. BIRD;

Your Honor# we’d suggest that the

5

legislative history indicates that there were a variety

6

of reasons for this Act being passed.
QUESTION;

7

No, I just asked you what were the

8

religious purposes that are — that you acknowledge are

9

presen t.

10
11

MR. BIRD;

As a tertiary purpose only, not as

the primary --

12

QUESTION;

I understand.

13

MR. EIRD:

-- or even the secondary purpose,

14

we’d recognize that, doubtless, some legislators had a

15

desire to teach religious doctrine in the classroom.

16
17
18

We feel that was a small minority of the
legislators, as indicated by the record.
But certainly there’s no question that in this

19

mixture of many different purposes that would certainly

20

be a tertiary or less important purpose, along with

21

basic concepts of fairness; the academic freedom concern

22

of students’ right to receive --

23

QUESTION;

Do you

think there was also a

24

purpose -- do you think there was also a

purpose to

25

exclude the teaching of evolutionary science, or

whatever you might call it?
MR. BIRD;

No, sir, I don't.

It is true that

there are —
QUESTION;

So to the extent that there's a

5

religious purpose, it's to add to the curriculum, rather

6

than to subtract from it?

7

MR. BIRD;

Yes, sir.

And if that were the

8

case, I'd suggest that the courts could properly address

9

any — that issue if they -- if they saw that issue

10

being a sufficiently significant purpose, simply by

11

stating what the State agrees wholeheartedly with, that

12

the teaching cf the Bible, as part of implementing this

13

statute, would be unconstitutional.

14

The State has consistently taken the position

15

that that, in a science classroom, would not be

16

appropriate under the Constitution or under the statute.

17

QUESTION;

Mr. Bird, do you think that it is

18

Constitutional within the establishment clause to teach

19

a purely religious concept in public school in order to

20

balance other concepts that are perceived to be

21

anti-religious?

22
23

MR. BIRD;

Your Honor, not in this case, and

not in the general case.

that creation

The State’s Erandeis memorandum, in fact,

5

6

cites 170 pages of that scientific evidence in defining

7

creation science and its content.
QUESTION:

8

Does it necessarily require the

9

teaching of a God, a personal God, as opposed to a first

10

cause that may be quite impersonal, or a giant slug, for

11

all we know?
MR. BIRD;

12

Your Honor, teaching creation

13

science does not entail, necessarily, the teaching of

14

any of those concepts.
In other words, with creation science

15
16

consisting of scientific evidence, such as the abrupt

17

appearance of complex life in the fossil record, the

18

systematic gaps between fossil categories, the

19

mathematical improbability of evolution, the vast

20

information content of all living forms, the genetic

21

limits of viable change -- in none of that is there any

22

concept of a creator, and certainly no concept of

23

Genesis.

24
25

That is scientific data.

1

I am.

I'm talking about what the

2

word "creation" means, according to Webster.

3

it seems to me, is what in all likelihood the Louisiana

4

legislature dealt with.
And what the word

5

And that,

means, according to Webster,

6

is, the act of bringing into existence, from nothing,

7

the universe or the world or the living and nonliving

8

things in it.
Now, the statute,

9

of course, also uses the

10

term "creationism".

And Webster defines that, too:

A

11

doctrine or theory of creation holding that matter, the

12

various forms of life and the world were created by a

13

transcendent God out of nothing.
That's what Webster's Third, published in

14
15

1981, the year this statute

was adopted, gave as the

16

definitions of these two key words.
Now, maybe that was a little ahead of its

17
18

time.

Let's go to Webster's Second.

difference.

Webster's Second, published in

"creation":

The act of creating or the fact of being

the fact of being brought into existence by divine

power, or its equivalent.

Mr. Topkis, you're arguing here in

support of the Fifth Circuit, not only the judgment but
the rationality, I take it,

that there is no secular

purpose for this statute?

Right, Your Honor.
But I didn't understand the Fifth

Circuit to rely as heavily as you apparently do on
dictionary definitions of the terms in the statute?
KR. TOPKIS:

Sell, I thought, as I read the

Fifth Circuit opinion, that they said, everybody knows
what creation and creationism is.

It's a basically

fundamentalist point of view.
And I would not think that we would have much
uncertainty about it, were it not for the fact that
people whose objectives are plain seek to invoke

QUESTION;

Well, I thought part of the Fifth

Circuit opinion could be read as saying that if there
was — if the statute was passed for religious purposes,

bad.
You wouldn't go that far, would you?

Now, again, where does this come from?

Let me

17

note one unusual fact about one of those five affidavits

18

that Mr. Bird came up with.

19

He offers an affidavit by a Dr. Terry Meith,

20

who tells us that he's a philosopher and a theologian,

21

and that he possesses three graduate degrees, two

22

doctorates and a Master’s.

MR. TOPKIS;

I don't care about their purpose;

as long as what they do is get the true historical facts

QUESTION:

Okay.

So it does come tack to

whether this statute requires the teaching of creation

in some divine sense.

of faith over the issue at hand to apply the tripartite

test to an unknown subject.
If this Court chooses to rely on

3
4

Constitutional grounds/ however# there's a great deal of

5

argument in support of the State's position that, we

6

submit, should lead to a favorable conclusion:

7

the Engel line of cases; not only the historical

8

evidence; but the tripartite test itself shows the

9

Constitutionality of this statute.
The purpose was stated as to advance academic

freedom.

QUESTION:

May I ask about --

MR. BIRD:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

-- academic freedom for a moment?

15

Would you say it would advance academic freedom if the

16

school was told you cannot teach a German -- a student

17

the German language unless he's also willing to study

18

French ?

19

MR. BIRD:

If they were within the same

subject area, such as conversational German versus

21

formal German —

22

QUESTION:

No, no, just German

— they didn't

particularly like Germans and they do like French.

So

what they say to the student is, you can’t study German

unless you study French.
