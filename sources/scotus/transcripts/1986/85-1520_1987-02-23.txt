Mr. Chief Justice,

the

robbery by obtaining information from the tellers and

2

other witnesses, and concluded that the robbery had been

committed by Vadaain Dixon.

Agent Anderson was familiar with Dixon as a

result of his investigations of previous bank robberies

that Dixon had committed.

escaped two days earlier from a halfway house in which

8

he was confined prior to sentencing for some of those

11

Based upon information that Dixon’s wife had

18

been staying with respondents, who are his sister and

19

brother-in-law, and that a car resembling respondent’s

20

car had been used in the bank robbery, the officers then

21

went to respondents' home.

22

Respondents did not consent to a search of

23

their home, but the officers nonetheless entered and

24

searched the home to look for Vadaain Dixon.

search are in dispate, but Vadaain Dixon was not found
Respondents subsequently commenced this action
for damages against Agent Anderson and the St. Paul
police officers, alleging that the warrantless entry in
their home violated the Fourth Amendment.
Agent Anderson moved for summary judgment, and
the District Court granted his motion, holdina that the
entry into the home was lawful because it was justified
by probable cause and exigent circumstances.
The Court of Appeals vacated the District
Court’s judgment but found that factual disputes
precluded a determination on summary judgment as to the
constitutionality of Agent Andersen's conduct.
The Court of Appeals then turned to consider
an issue that was not decided by the District Court,
whether Agent Anderson was entitled to immunity under
this Court's decision in Harlow v. Fitzgerald.
The Court held that Agent Anderson was not
entitled to immunity, because the legal standard
governing his conduct, the requirement of probable cause
and exigent circumstances to execute the warrantless
search , had been clearly established at the time of the
challenged search.
And the Court of Appeals remanded the case for
a trial concerning the merits of respondents' Fourth

And we similarly do not seek a determination

20

by the Court as to whether Agent Anderson is entitled to

What we are seeking is review of the Court of

23

Appeals’ conclusion that Agent Anderson was not entitled

24

to immunity simply because the legal standard was

settled .
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

In our view, the Court of Appeals simply
applied the wrong test in determining whether immunity
was appropriate.
We think the question is not whether the legal
standard is appropriate, but whether the particular
officer -- a

reasonable officer in Agent Anderson's

position should have known that the conduct was
unconstitutional.
The Court of Appeals did not even consider
that question, and we think therefore improperly
deprived Agent Anderson of his immunity defense.
Now the starting point in determining how
Harlow should be applied in

this context is the Court's

decision in Harlow itself.

And what —

QUESTION:

Hr. Pincus, can I just interrupt

y ou ?
Do you think it's perfectly clear that the
Court of Appeals said that he simply does not have an
immunity defense, or he doesn’t have one that can be
decided on summary judgment?
QUESTION:

Well, Justice Stevens,

the way we

read the Court of Appeals’ opinion is that it simply
disposed of the immunity issue altogether.
And I guess in the passage of the opinion
that's reprinted on pages 16A and 17A of the petition
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

for certiorari states that Officer Andersen has cited no

2

persuasive reason why he could not reasonably have been

3

aware of this clearly established law.
And we think that's a determination that the

4
5

immunity issue is just out of the case.
QUESTION;

6

Well, he hasn’t done that at this

7

stage of the proceedings.

But I don’t knew that that

8

would have foreclosed him from making a further record.
Because as you point out, the District Court

9

10

decided the case on the constitutional issue, said there

11

was no probable cause and no exigent circumstances as a

12

matter of law, and it didn’t even reach the immunity

13

issue.
So I’m not clear whether the record had been

14
15

fully developed on the question of whether he was

16

entitled to immunity or not.
QUESTION!

17

(Inaudible) his submission is that

18

even though the Court of Appeals may not have finally

19

decided the immunity question, they applied the wrong

20

standard in guiding the District Court as to how to

21

decide .

standard was clearly established, do you?

5

MR. PINCUS:

No, Your H'onor, but we think they

were wrong in saying that was the end of the inquiry.
QUESTION;

Well, I know.

Well, you would be

6

very happy if we said there's more to it than that, and

7

the record isn't fully developed, and go back and -- you

8

don't object to further proceedings?

9

11

MR.

FINCUS:

No, we in fact -- we submit that

further proceedings are entirely appropriate.
QUESTION:

So Justice Stevens' point, you'd be

12

very happy if we just said that -- affirmed that there's

13

more to it than that?

14

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, Your Honor, we'd be very

15

happy if the Court did in this case just what it did in

16

Malley v. Briggs, which is to point out what the

17

ultimate question is on immunity, and then remand the

18

case to allow the District Court to decide whether or

19

not that standard has been met on the facts of this case.

20

QUESTION:

So you

22

proceedings should be?

MR. PINCUS;

Yes,

as long as what the Court of

21

Appeals -- as long as a portion of that judgment doesn’t

22

take the issue out of the case.

23

If the Court reads the Court of Appeals

24

judgment as leaving that question open, then we’d be

25

perfectly happy with the judgment being affirmed.

If

the Court — on our reading of the opinion, that -- the
judgment disposes of that issue, so we think that the
judgment has to be vacated to allow the District Court
to conduct these further proceedings.
QUESTION;

Mr. Pineus, I understood your brief

to request us to reverse the judgment because the Court
applied an erroneous principle.

How can we affirm it if

we think the hollow standard was incorrectly framed?
MS. FTNCUS;

Well, Your Honor,

I agree.

Our

position is that the Court of Appeals’ judgment was
wrong, and that it has to be either vacated or reversed.
Justice Stevens -QUESTION;

Well, reversed or remanded.

MR. FINCUS;

Yes.

Justice Stevens question, I

think, posited that the Court of Appeals did not
foreclose further proceedings on the immunity issue, and
in that technical sense, I guess, its judgment would
have left those proceedings open in the District Court.
But we think, in any event, the Court of
Appeals was wrong, and what has to be set right is what
the proper legal standard is to guide a court
considering immunity questions in a Fourth Amendment
context such

as this case.

And we think that the resolution of that
question turns upon the standard that this Court set
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

forth in Harlow, which is that a government official is

2

entitled to immunity unless his conduct violated clearly

3

established statutory or constitutional rights of which

4

a reasonable person would have known.

5

And in order to decide when a right is clearly

6

established,

7

reasons that the Court adopted this immunity test in the

8

first place.

9

we think it’s necessary to look to the

violations; and on the other side is the need to protect

13

government officials from liability so they will not be

14

reluctant to vigorously perform their duties.

15

On the one side is

in permitting recovery for constitutional

QUESTION;

If that's really what, we meant in

16

Harlow, we really should have put it differently then,

17

shouldn ' t we ?

18

I mean, that's a strange way to say that,

19

clearly established constitutional riqhts of which he

20

should have known.

21

If

we meant what you're saying, wouldn't it

22

have been better to say if he clearly violated clearly

23

established constitutional rights?

24
25

The "clearly" part you're talking about is not
the constitutional right, but whether what was done

constituted a violation
MR. PIN' CUS:

2

Well, we think that the questcn

3

here is whether on the facts of this case it was clearly

4

established that respondents had a right not to -- for

5

Officer Anderson not to conduct a warrantless search of

6

their home.
So the right in this case doesn *t turn just on

7

8

the legal standard, it turns on how the legal standard

9

interacted with the particular facts here.
But in any event,

10

I think the Court —

11

although that particular phrase may have been less than

12

clear,

13

made clear that the question was whether the officer

14

reasonably coull have known

15

violated the Constitution.

the Court in other places in Harlow specifically

that what he was going to do

In another portion of the opinion , for

16
17

example, the Court said, where an official could be

18

expected to know that certain conduct would violate

19

statutory or constitutional rights, he should be made to

20

hesitate .

21

And it made clear that in that context, that.

22

-- that that's the context in which a government officer

23

should be held liable, and only that context.

24
25

So Harlow, we think, makes it quite clear that
the way the Court struck the balance between liability
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

and immunity was to say that only where an officer

10

that what he was about to do

And as I understand it. Justice Scalia asked,

11
12

well, should

the standard in Harlow then mean that

13

conduct which clearly violates clearly established

14

constitutional rights, that’s the inquiry you have to

15

make.

16

Is that right?

17

MR. PINCUSi

Yes,

yes.

I think that’s right.

in Malley v.

And it said quite specifically that the

22

inquiry was whether a reasonable, well trained officer,

25

would have known that the

And we think it’s clear that what that
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Standard requires is to look at the particular facts of

2

the case, and to decide whether a reasonable — any

3

reasonable officer in that situation would have known

4

that it was unconstitutional to go ahead and do what the

5

defendant actually did.
And only in that situation, if that inquiry is

6
7

answered affirmatively, that any reasonable officer

8

would have known that it «as unconstitutional, then

9

immunity fails and liability is permissible.
QUESTION:

The ACLU brief suggests that under

would get us back to a subjective inquiry

13

Mould you like to comment on that?

14

MS. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, we don’t think

15

that a subjective inquiry will be necessary in every

16

case.
First of all, in the warrant context, the

17
18

relevant facts, of course, are what are in the

19

affidavit.

20

with subjective -- with the need for a subjective

21

inquiry.

22

So there’s no problem in the warrant context

In the warrantless context, of course, the

23

relevant facts are the facts that are known to the

24

officers that conduct the search.

25

QUESTION;

And objectively whether a
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

reasonable well trained officer would -MR . PINCUS:

2

Yes,

Your Honor, it's a two-step

3

process.

First, t.ie relevant pool of facts has to be

4

ascertained.

5

facts, would any reasonable officer have known that the

6

challenge — that what the officer went ahead and did

7

was unconstitutional.

And then the question is, taking those

8

So, although that

initial inquiry, gathering

9

the pool of relevant facts,

does require some -- it is

10

not a wholly legal inquiry,

it requires seme looking at

11

the facts of a particular case.
QUESTION:

12

But a particular defendant could

13

not -- the government officer could not prevail simply

14

by testifying that he subjectively thought there was

15

probable cause.
MR. PINCUS:

16

No, the Court's made clear that

17

that’s irrelevant under the Fourth Amendment, and we

18

think it would be irrelevant here.
The only part of the inquiry that's subjective

19

20

is simply gathering the pool of relevant facts.

21

those are then examined on an objective basis.

And

But even though that inquiry is necessary in

22
23

some cases, we don't think it will be necessary in every

24

case.

25

an affidavit, and there won't be a dispute about whether

First of all, it may be that an officer will file

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

or not he knew those facts.
Or it may be possible for a court to say, even

2
3

if he knew all those facts,

4

entitle him to immunity.
QUESTION:

5

that still is not enough to

Yes, but I don't see why you say it

6

doesn't come up in the warrant context.

7

up in the warrant context gust as well.
Let’s assume that

8
9

It surely comes

the facts on which the

warrant was issued do not, in fact, establish probable

10

cause.

You’d still have to inquire whether it was close

11

enough

that the officer could reasonably have believed

12

that they established --

13

MR. PINCUS;

Yes,

sir, and I was just -- I was

14

responding to Justice O’Connor's question about whether

15

a subjective — something that wasn’t on an objective

16

piece of paper would be required.

17

In the warrant context, the pool of facts

18

doesn't have to be obtained by either an affidavit from

19

the officer or deposing the officer because it’s the

20

facts that are in the affidavit.

21

QUESTION;

You still have to inquire into his

22

subjective judgment.

23

to inquire into what facts he knew.

24
25

MR. PINCUS;

You're just saying you don't have

Yes,

and that second question,

the question about whether his judgment is reasonable,

with those facts.

to his judgment.

It's a judgment about

And so that particular — that phase of it

4

5

will be easy for a court; it doesn't require any

6

fact-finding .
QUESTION;

7

There is a little bit of a romvoire

8

situation when you’re dealing with an area like the

9

Fourth

Amendment, that -- the legal standards are these

10

of a reasonable person, and

then you get to the ouestion

11

of, even though they didn't

satisfy that, could they

12

satisfy the objective belief or objective view of

13

another reasonable man.

14
15
16

MS. PINCUS:

Well, it's true, and the ACLU and

respondents dc make that point in their brief.
But we think, although both inquiries are

17

denominated reasonableness tests, actually,

they're

18

quite different.

19

recognized in the Malley case, and also in Leon, where

20

the Court, in both cases, the Court has recognized that

21

although conduct can violate the Fourth Amendment, and

22

thus be unreasonable in that sense, it may have been

23

objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that

24

that conduct was lawful, and therefore he would be

25

entitled to immunity.

And it's something that the Court has

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

And we think that same distinction applies

2

here .
The — let me just say one more word about the

3
4

difference betwen the two tests.

5

think, is that the -- the objective reasonable test in

6

Harlow is not a general reasonableness inquiry, it's an

7

inquiry that takes as its guide the established case

8

law, and sees what the officer could have thought based

9

on that.

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, obviously we

think that Agent Anderson is entitled to immunity, and

that's what the

It’s hard to predict in advance exactly what

But we think that

at this stage what's

3

important is to get right the legal standard that those

4

courts have to apply in deciding immunity in this

5

context, and then it will be necessary to see whether

6

they in fact

7

apply that standard correctly.

Let me just turn for one moment to the rule

8

advanced by respondents, because we think it makes clear

9

why the Harlow standard has to be interpreted in the

10

manner for which ve contend

11

the Court applied it in the halley case.

12

-- and in the manner that

The rule that respondents support and that the

13

Court of Appeals applied is that the existence of a

14

settled legal standard just automatically eliminates all

15

immunity for actions taken where that standard applies.

16

And we think it*s clear that that

quite a breathtaking

18

19

would work

reduction in the immunity availale

For example, just taking law enforcement

20

officers as a single example, settled Fourth Amendment

21

standards govern a lot of routine law enforcement

22

activities, such as searches, seizures, and

23

investigatory stops.

24
25

And under the Court of Appeals rule, officers
would never be entitled to immunity in connection with
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

any of those activities, and thus an officer would have

2

no leeway for miscalculation in the performance of those

3

duties .

4

Everytime he misjudged the requirements of the

5

Fourth Amendment, even if it was a very close question,

6

he would be required to answer in damages .

7

And we think holding officers tc that standard

8

is counter to the Court’s repeated affirmation that

9

Harlow allows ample room for mistaken judgments,

and

10

assures immunity for all but the plainly incompetent or

11

those that knowingly violate the law.

12

QUESTION;

Well, what do you do about the

13

argument that, at least when you’re dealing with a

14

probable cause question, the slack is already built in?

15

You don’t have to be correct that there's criminal

16

activity, or that it’s the product of a crime; you just

17

have to have probable cause to believe, which means a

18

reasonable person would think it’s there.

19

MR. PINCUS;

Well, Your Honor,

the problem

20

with that argument is that the probable cause standard

21

assumes that officers will be able to act up until the

22

limit of where probable cause exists.

23

The reason that the standard is set low is

24

because often at the initial stage of an investigation

25

an officer can’t have enough facts to know precisely
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

what's going cn

2

And what society has decided is that where the

3

officer has facts that amount to probable cause, even if

4

they're just barely probable cause, his action is

5

legally correct.

6

And if he was required to be absolutely right

7

in that judgment

or answer in damages, an officer would

8

obviously not -- would be quite reluctant tc take action

9

unless he was quite sure he was way over the boundary,

10

because the alternative would be for him to be liable in

11

damages for any misjudgment.

12

So we think the effect of that approach is

13

necessarily going to be to make officers extremely

14

reluctant to

15

quite a lot more than probable cause, and to harm law

16

enforcement activity as a result.

17

act unless they have something that is

QUESTION;

There isn’t any real necessity,

18

though, to equate admissibility of evidence, where the

19

aim is to deter illegal action, and you wouldn’t deter

20

anything where an officer could reasonably have believed

21

he was satisfying probable cause and immunity questions

11

NR. FINCUS;

Well, Your Honor, an officer, we

12

think, has an incentive to act according to the

13

Constitution, just because that is the requirement of

14

his office, A, and B, because the goal is to apprehend

15

someone and convict them later.
So if he takes an

16

action that violates the

17

Constitution, the evidence may very well be sunpressed

18

later.

19

20
21

So that, and the possibility of damages, gives
him we think a significant incentive to act properly.
The question is whether damages -- the threat

22

of damages for any miscalculation will skew the

1

I think, it is an interesting point to note that the

2

Halley decision was based on a standard that was

3

appropriate in malicious prosecution, where there would

4

be an immunity without probable cause.
But in a trespass case, or false arrest case,

5

6

you could never have an immunity without probable

7

cause.

8

9
10
11

That’s my understanding of the common law, and
it’s derived

mainly from the Pierson case, where they

said you needed probable cause and good faith.
That leads me to a point that I'd like to make

12

about the government’s claim that our standard of

13

immunity is somehow a breathtaking reduction in the

14

immunity from what Harlow established.

15

I don’t think it is at all.

Because Harlow

16

did two things.

17

where there was a novel constitutional right being

18

asserted, or a new development.

19

Harlow eliminated a lawsuit in a case

And it established an immunity right up front

20

in the case,

21

based on the state of law, a purely legal question.

22

I think that's clearly what the Court held in that case.

23

where you could get summary judgment just

And it also did one other thing:

And

It

24

eliminated the malice prong of the standard, which

25

allowed a defendant to get summary judgment more easily
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

right on the merits, because there wouldn't be that

2

factual question still existing that was always a

3

fact-based question that precluded summary judgment when

4

it came to malice.

5

So even accepting our standard, as we

6

formulate it under Harlow, the government has still a

7

broader defense because that malice has been eliminated.

And I don't think
the standard

MR. SHEEHY:

That's true, Your Honor.

But the

2

3

that the Fourth Amendment principles that apply, make it

4

appropriate, that the officer should get immunity in a

5

situation where he gets the warrant.

6
7

8

Because in doubtful cases, where the officer
goes to get the warrant, the search should be upheld.
What we're asking

the Court to do in this case

9

is to apply the second part of that standard, and that

10

is in doubtful cases where there is not a warrant, the

11

search should fail.

would -- in my view of the immunity standard, Halley is

consistent with it because he got the warrant.

20
21

22

And we believe that that represents a special
circumstance in the Fourth Amendment.
I think that the Fourth Amendment is a much

23

more unique area of the law.

The Court has attempted to

24

develop a standard that is a broad doctrine that cuts

25

across every constitutional

Because there, the officer, if he has any

Justice Scalia, I think that is a

And I have two responses for that.

First of all, that simply because an officer

violate a right does not mean that somebody is going to

receive a huge damage award, and that there are ways to

15

deal with that in the damages area, or in just settling

the suit up front if they think there was a violation,

17

or if there’s a holding there was a violation.

20

You don’t have to go through the rigors of
litigation necessarily in all these suits.
Now the Justice Department, under the

21

regulation I’ve cited in ray brief, takes the position

22

that we’ll never settle a lawsuit unless there’s a

judgment, and that we’ll defend to the last ditch

They were in the Selby Dale area

There were within, I

believe, a three to four mile radius of the bank.
Turning to what I call the collapsing of the

12

immunity standard, is, is that the government makes the

13

argument that Russell Anderson’s position was, is that

14

either he’d be charged with dereliction of duty if he

15

didn’t act, or he'd be mulcted in damages if he did.

16

That isn’t the case, really.

Because I think

17

that over the years, as the Court has been applying

18

these immunity standards, the defense on the liability

19

and the immunity itself has kind of become confused in

20

some sense.

21

Because if you take Pierson v.

Pay, which is a

22

case that would be, I think, one of the cases most

23

dicectly applicable in this context, the Court there

24

didn’t really hold that he had immunity; they just said

25

that in a 1983 action a police officer would have a

that in Butz v. Economou , there's a foot note in the

do there is provide a defense to that action, so there

should be a federal cause of action like we have here

today.

And that was right in the Butts decision.

I

took a look at the briefs, and the government argued it

there; they thought it was sufficient back then.

now they don't think it's sufficient to protect them,
