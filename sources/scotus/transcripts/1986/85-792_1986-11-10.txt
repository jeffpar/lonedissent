Paise that argument later?

3

MR. RUSH

The guise, if you'll --

4

QUESTION:

Why aren't they precluded from

d-oing that?
Well, the court below held that

MR. RUSH:

6
7

they the jurisdiction to determine whether the

8

Commission had improperly failed to clarify at the

9

request of the petitioners.
We did not argue that they did

10

not have what I

11

would call the limited jurisdiction to determine whether

12

that denial was arbitrary and capricious.

13

The majority of the court then went on --

14

QUESTION:

You took, the position that it was

15

perfectly all right for them to come in later and

16

the issue; is that it?
MR. RUSH:

17

No, that's not our position at

It just -- I don't

understand.
MR. RUSH:

Well, I think that an argument can

be made for waiver of rights not raised at the proper
time before the agency's procedure.
And that was one of the arguments, of course,
that we raised before the court below.

supposed to.
MR. RUSH:

That's correct. Judge Scalia.

But

at the same time —
QUESTION;
here?

So how

do you get around that

And that's jurisdictional, so you really

shouldn't be talking to the merits if we don't have
jurisdiction.
MR. RUSH;

Well, our view of jurisdiction is

that there was at least jurisdiction in the lower court
to determine whether the Commission abused its
discretion by refusing the clarify its earlier ruling.
QUESTION;

Okay, now how is that?

The

Commission denied the petition to clarify, right?
MR. RUSH:

That's correct, Judge Scalia.

QUESTION;

1

2

Then there was filed a petition to

reconsider the denial of the petition to clarify, right?

3

MR. RUSH:

Right,

correct.

4

QUESTION;

And the appeal that we have before

5

us is from that denial of the petition to reconsider,

6

isn’t it?
MR. RUSH;

7

and the petition to reconsider.
QUESTION:

10

Both the petition for clarification

Was an appeal filed from the

petition to clarify?
MR. RUSH:

11

It was embraced within the denial

12

of the petition to reconsider, it seems to me, because

13

clearly, upon denying the petition to reconsider, the

14

initial petition would be in issue.

It’s not what the statute reads

goes on to say that, notwithstanding this subtitle, an

that is, the denial of the petition to clarify, is final

MR. RUSH;

That's correct, except viewed as an

deem the two petitions to reconsider the denial of

clarification to be -- tolls that period and commences

MR. PUSH;

It commences the time running for

13

seeking judicial review, much as denial of a petition

seeking certain --

16
17
18

QUESTION;

Judicial review of what?

Of the

original order7
MR. RUSH;

No, no, no.

Of the denial of

19

clarification.

We've contended all along that all that

20

was open to the court was denial of clarification.

21

The question of whether --

Why was that even open?

Why was

MR. RUSH;

Within the time limit.

12

QUESTION:

And then the 60 days expire.

13

Nay

the 60 days?

That’s not how the Hobbes Act reads.
MR. RUSH:

14

Well, that -- there are a number of

15

cases that are not included in our brief, I regret to

16

say, that address that issue.

17

QUESTION:

It’s net what Eag.1 e-Fi cher says.

18

It's not what any D.C. Circuit case says that I’m aware

of.

20

practitioners explicitly that they should file the

21

motion for reconsideration with the agency, and

22

simultaneously file an appeal to protect their rights,

23

because the motion for reconsideration does not preserve

the 60-day period.

25

In fact, the D.C. Circuit has advised the ICC

MR. RUSH;

I will supply them to the Court.

have acquiesced in that interpretation for the last,

about, eight year.

Now, I understand

And at the Commission we

issue, as being another issue that you're very concerned

11

with, and so are we.

12

improve things greatly in review of our decisions,

13

particularly in cases like this, where the issue

14

certainly ought to have been foreseen, because the

15

parties, the MKT here, and the DR GW, explicitly

16

requested the right to crew with their own crews under

17

the trackage rights that were being granted.

18

QUESTION;

And Eagle-Picher, we think, will

Let me make sure I understand your

19

argument now.

We had here the denial of the petition to

20

clarify, all right.

21

MR. RUSH;

That's correct.

22

QUESTION;

And your argument is that the

23

petition to reconsider the denial, what,

tolls the

24

60-day period as long as that petition is pending, the

25

60-day period is tolled?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. RUSH

1

Made the 60-day period, for appeal

2

of that denial of clarification, run from the date the

3

administrative appeal is denied.

4

QUESTION;

But what do you do with the statute

5

that says, notwithstanding the ability to file a motion

6

for reconsideration, notwithstanding it, an action of

7

the Commission under this section is finaI on the date

8

in which it was served, and a civil action to enforce or

9

suspend it may be filed after that date?
MR. RUSH;

10

Well, I think we look at the ”mav"

11

in that, and

12

administrative remedies, which is implicated in a D.C.

13

Circuit case shortly after that very provision was

14

passed.
QUESTION;

15
16

also consider the issue of exhaustion of

It may be filed.

It must be filed

for purposes of statutory limitation purposes.
MR. RUSH;

17

Well, we have not so interpreted

18

it.

We've interpreted it to mean that you cannot be

19

required to seek an administrative appeal.

20

directly to court.

You can go

21

But should you choose to file an

22

administrative appeal, that your time to go to court

23

runs from 60 days after that appeal is dealt with.

24

QUESTION;

25

within the 60 days?

So long as the appeal is filed

MR. RUSH

That 's correct

QUESTION;

That does seem -- that dees seem to

-- that does seem to disregard the 60-day reference in
the statute.
QUESTION;

Well, isn't this a matter for your

opposition as well as for you?
MR. RUSH;

Yes, I'm sure it is, Justice Black.

QUESTION;

(Inaudible) real substance to it,

you'll win.
MR . RUSH;

But on a very narrow ground .

initially moved to dismiss,

We

and the court then took the

issue, in part I presume because of the suggestion that
we might be required as a matter of law to have
addressed the question.of the relation between the
Interstate Commerce Act and the Railway Labor Act.
QUESTION;

And you want a ruling on the merits?

MR. RUSH:

Yes, we very much do, having

exerted this much time and effort in the case to date;
and I believe that the respondents want the same thing.
We want vastly different rulings.

But

nonetheless, a ruling seems very much necessary to guide
the parties for the future in these matters.

And there

are innumerable matters pending, as we've noted in our
petition for the writ.
QUESTION;

One more question.

We've just been

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

talking about filing the reconsideration for the

2

petition to clarify*
Okay, the petition to clarify itself was filed

3
4

more than 60 days after the original decision here was

5

rendered, right?

6

MR, RUSH:

That’s correct.

7

QUESTION*

So your theory would not even cover

9

MR. RUSH;

No, I --

10

QUESTION;

How do you enable us to get into

8

that?

11

the merits of the original order on the basis of the

12

petition to clarify?

13

MR. RUSH;

I think that very much as with a

14

rule, and there are a number of cases from the D.C.

15

Circuit on that, that rather than go to court with an

16

untimely challenge, you can ask the agency to amend,

17

reconsider, in this case clarify —

18

QUESTION;

Well, that’s all you need to get

19

around the 60 days of the Hobbes Ret?

20

petition to clarify, and then the 60 days can be

21

extended indefinitely?

22

MR. RUSH;

Just file a

Well, we believe, as we’ve

23

indicated in our brief, that an Eagle-Picher analysis

24

can and should be applied to whether that request for

25

clarification is proper.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION;

Well, how does it work, out here?

2

Why couldn’t all of the points raised in that petition

3

for clarification , which is really more like a petition

4

for reconsideration, it seems to me, why couldn't all of

5

them have been made at the time of the original

6

proceeding, or urged before a court within 60 days after

7

the original proceeding?

They can, and unquestionably,
The issue is --

QUESTION:

Well, that’s the end of it then, as

far as Eagle-Picher is concerned, isn’t it?
HR. RUSH:

Well, of course, Eagle-Picher has

13

been -- not been applied

14

when this case was in the pipeline.

15
16

QUESTION:

retroactively, if you will,

Well, nor is Eagle-Picher -- nor is

Eagle-Picher a decision of this Court.

17

MR. RUSH;

That’s very correct.

18

QUESTION;

Hr. Rush, if the respondents had

19

raised the issue of their collective bargaining rights

20

during the original ICC hearings on the merger, would

21

the agency have considered them, the ICC?

22

HR. RUSH;

I have no doubt they would have,

23

Justice O’Connor.

24

all of the matters in tension presented at cne time.

25

I mean, that’s the point of having

QUESTION;

Well, the respondents seem to be

(202) 628-9300

1

suggesting that had they done so they wouldn't have been

2

heard.

And I wondered what your position was.
MR. RUSH:

3
4

I think they have absolutely no

basis for that assertion.
QUESTION:

5

Are there any limits as to what the

6

ICC can exempt under this statute?

7

action have to be germane to the transaction?
SR. RUSH:

8
9
10

Or does the exempted

Well, the ICC does not exempt.

That is a critical aspect of the case.

The ICC

approves, and the statute exempts.
But yes, certainly, the exemption, effected by

11
12

the statute could raise an issue of germane ness to the

13

transaction.

14

revisited would come out differently if, in that case,

15

that had been a central aspect of the merger as crewing

16

was here.

And in that context, perhaps Palestine

Instead, in that case, the situation was that

17
18

they said, since you're approving the merger, by the way

19

can you get us out of this agreement that we're not very

20

fond of.

21

And we said, sure, ignore it.
But had, for example, the consolidation of

22

yards, of which Palestine was one, been a public benefit

23

associated with the merger,

24

different analysis.

25

essence, is involved here.

I think you'd get a very

And I think that's what, in

QUESTION;

1

2

Why don’t you spend a couple of

minutes on the merits before your -MR. RUSH;

3

Well, I had hoped to reserve some

4

time.

But the issue on the merits seems to be very

5

simply the question of the Commission's approval of the

6

transaction effecting a statutory exemption from all

7

other laws and impediments to the carrying out of the

8

transaction.
And the problems presented are classically

9
10

illustrated by the case here, where a condition which

11

the Commission imposed upon

12

most significant rail mergers ever approved by it has

13

been thrown into doubt and left open with a cloud

14

hanging over it for three, close to four, years.
The Commission approved it in 1982, and that

15
16

approval was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit in 1983.
Hence we believe that unless the view

18

its approval of one of the

expressed by

the Commission is carried out here, the --

question.

23

or later on, when all the petitions were denied?

being overturned, if some aspect of the decision is

Well, that's not quite right, I

guess, because — well, okay.

16

MR. RUSH;

In the context of this case, my

17

answer would be that it took place in 1932 when the

18

Commission approved the transaction.

And if I may, I'd like to reserve the balance
of my time.

please the Court;
Mr. Rush has just told you that the ICC wants

3

a ruling on the merits.

4

Missouri-Kansas-Texas would be delighted with a ruling

on jurisdictional grounds, if the ruling of this Court

is that the Court of Appeals did not have jurisdiction

to hear the appeal of the unions below.

Let me assure you that the

That’s precisely what we argued to the Court
of Appeals.

We moved to dismiss the action.

The decision of the ICC approving the merger

filed by the

unions, the BLE in this case, was not filed with the

16

Commission until April the 4th, 1983.

17

The Administrative Orders Review Act, cr the

18

Hobbes Act, provides that any party aggrieved by a final

19

order of an agency may within 60 days file a petition

20

for review.

In our judgment, the Court of Appeals below

MR. MANSONi

1

Well, it's not raised in our cert

3

preliminary matter in its belief.

4

subscribe to the government's view on that point.

And we would

Turning to the merits, the Commission

5

6

conditioned its approval of the Union Pacific-Missouri

7

Pacific-Western Pacific merger upon a grant of a

8

competitive trackage rights application,

Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad .

filed by the

In that application, Katy proposed to use its

10
11

own crews, and to operate over the lines of its

12

principal competitor, the Missouri Pacific, between

13

Kansas City and Omaha.
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and

14
15

the United Transportation Union represent employees on

16

both the Katy and the Missouri Pacific.
Despite the fact that both of those unions

17
18

entered into implementing agreements with Katy, on

19

behalf of Katy employees, that provided that the Katy

20

employees would provide the operations in this trackage

21

rights application, those unions argue in this case that

22

Missouri Pacific employees have rights under the Railway

23

Labor Act to bargain with the Missouri Pacific

24

concerning the crewing of Katy's trackage rights

25

operation.

1

If the unions are correct that this

2

negotiation is governed by the procedures of the Railway

3

Labor Act, then the unions would have the right to

4

strike over this issue.

5

We agree with- the government’s analysis of the

6

fundamental errors in the Court of Appeals

7

interpretation of the consolidation provisions of the

8

Interstate Commerce Act.

9

We

would emphasize that this statutory scheme

10

was enacted by Congress to encourage railroad

11

consolidations? and according to the legislative

12

history, to restore to the carriers all initiative in

13

formulating consolidation proposals.

14

Indeed, this Court noted in United States

15

versus Interstate Commerce Commission, that although the

16

Commission in fulfilling its statutory responsibilities

17

is to carefully review all of the terms of a merger

18

proposal, and determine whether they are just and

19

reasonable, it is not for the agency, much less the

20

courts, to dictate the terms of the merger agreement

21

once this standard has been

22

met.

Unions or other parties contesting trackage

23

rights applications have never been given the rights to

24

change the terms of the carriers’ proposals, as the

25

unions in this case seek to do.

Rather, those parties

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

are given an opportunity to demonstrate to the

2

Commission that the proposed terms and conditions are

3

inconsistent with the public interest.
The Court of Appeals* decision is inconsistent

4
5

with the decisions of this Court, particularly

6

Schwabacher v. United States and Texas v. United

States.

In Schwabacher, the Court held that once the

7

8

Commission approved a railroad merger under Section 5 of

9

the Interstate Commerce Act, the predecessor of Sections

10

1130 -- 343 and 11343, the approved transaction goes

11

into effect without the need for invoking any approach

12

under State authority.

13

This answers the question that you raised,

14

Justice Stevens, about the date of the effect of the

15

Commission’s exemption.

15

effect as soon as the Commission approved the decision.

17

And in this instance, after the Court of Appeals ruled

18

on the appeal from that decision.
If the Court of Appeals* necessity standard in

19

20

That exemption was -- went into

this case —
QUESTION;

21

Would that also -- would that also

22

have been true if the terms of the trackage lease

23

agreements had not said anything about who would do the

24

crewing ?

25

KR • MANSON:

Yes, it would, Your Honor.
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The

1

focus, in my

judgment, and in our judgment, has to be on

2

the impact of the statute, and vbat vould happen under

3

the statute if the carriers were not exempted from it.

4

Sven if the crew provisions were left blank,

5

giving the unions the right to negotiate under the

6

Railway Labor Act, the identity of the crews would also

7

give them a concomitant right to strike.

8
9

And if they’re given the right to strike, then
the trackage rights operation can be frustrated.

And

10

that’s what the Commission recognized in its decisions

11

in this case.

12

reasons Congress intended for these exemptions to apply.

And that’s what — one of the main

13

But under the Court of —

14

QUESTION:

But Hr. Hansen, what did the

15

statement in

16

effect that collective bargaining rights shall be

17

preserved, mean?

18

the ICC labor protective conditions, to the

HR. HANSON:

That provisions means. Justice

19

O’Connor, that the collective bargaining agreements, the

20

rights of the employees, are preserved, but in the

21

context of the Commission’s approval.

22

You’ll see that there’s another provision of

23

the labor protective conditions that provides that the

24

carriers have a right tc arbitrate over the

25

implementation of their agreements, in Article I Section

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

4

And clearly this right to arbitrate is not

3

found in the Railway Labor Act.

4

disputes in implementations necessarily involves the

5

overriding of collective bargaining agreements,

6

especially in seniority matters.

7

This right to arbitrate

And so we believe that that Article I Section

8

2 on the preservation of collective bargaining rights

9

must be read in the context of the other labor

10

protective conditions that are imposed; and more

11

importantly in this case, in the context of the

Commission’s approval of the transaction at

QUESTION;

issue.

I’m not sure what you’re saying.

14

You meam it preserves collective bargaining rights

15

except with respect to those matters that are

16

specifically disposed of by the agreements?

17

MR. MANSON;

Well, except, T would say

18

principally -- the principal exception would be with

19

respect to the implementation of a transaction.

20

If, for example, a collective bargaining

21

agreement provide that there could be no layoffs, and

22

the Commission found that in order to satisfy the public

23

interest, there had to be a consolidation of facilities

24

as proposed by the carriers, then that prevision of the

25

collective bargaining agreement must give way to the

Commission's approval.
And I think it's important to note that the

3

employees are not left out in the cold.

4

whole series of benefits, of compensation benefits, that

5

the statute provides, including the receipt of full pay

6

for up to six years in the event that they are dismissed

7

as a result of the transaction.

8
9

QUESTION

They have a

Well, why wasn't the Commission's

order qualified then?

You say that the statement

10

doesn’t mean literally what it says, that not all

11

collective bargaining rights are preserved.

12

wasn’t it qualified?

13

ME. MAN SONi

So why

Well, because I think that it’s

14

clear from the — from reading Article I Section 4 in

15

conjunction with Article I Section 2, and it’s certainly

16

clear from the decisions of

17

Commission, from

18

of the courts, that provisions of collective bargaining

19

agreements must give way to implementation of

20

Commission-approved

21

the Interstate Commerce

transactions.

If the Court of Appeals' necessity standard

22

that it adopted were applied to the facts of

23

Schwabacher, the carriers would not have been able to be

24

exempted from the Michigan State law at issue there,

25

since the State law did not preclude the merger from

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

being implemented.
Likewise, applying the majority’s rationale to

3

the facts of

4

the conclusion that the carriers could not be exempted

5

from the State statute at issue in that case, for the

6

same reason.

7

Texas v. the United States would lead to

But the most glaring error in the majority’s

8

opinion is its failure to assess whether the Railway

9

Labor Act procedures sought

to be enforced by the unions

10

could frustrate the implementation of Xaty’s trackage

11

rights operation.

12

Putting aside for

the moment the fact that the

13

unions never demonstrated that they had any

Railway

14

Labor Act rights that were being violated by the Katy’s

15

crewing decision, the court below failed completely to

16

focus on the fact that the application of Railway Labor

17

Act procedures, and especially the fact that the unions

18

may strike under the statute, could frustrate the

19

implementation of every rail transaction approved by the

20

Commission.

21

The most pertinent decision to this case on

22

that score is the Eighth Circuit decision in Missouri

23

Pacific Railroad v. United Transportation Union.

24

enjoining the UTU from striking the Missouri Pacific in

25

an effort to shut down Katy’s trackage rights operations
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

In

1

at issue in this case, in that decision, the Eighth

2

Circuit found it inconceiV3ble that Congress could have

3

intended that a labor union

4

in an ICC proceeding, as UTU did, and then, if

5

dissatisfied

6

a carrier to obtain the advantage it desired.

would be able to participate

with the results or a part thereof, strike

That is the same conclusion reached by the

7

8

Commission in its October, 1983 decision in this case,

9

when it specifica 11y found that its approval of the

10

transactions under Sections

11343 and 11344 necessarily

11

carries with it an exemption from the Railway Labor Act.
The Eighth Circuit decision again in Missouri

12
13

Pacific v. UTU refutes any argument that a Railway Labor

14

Act exemption is not necessary in this case.
In its opinion enjoining the UTU*s threatened

15
16

strike, the District Court of Missouri found that the

17

threatened strike of UTU would cause irreparable injury

18

to Missouri Pacific and to thousands of shippers that it

19

serves .

20

The Eighth Circuit reasoned that the balance

21

and efficiency which Congress sought to achieve through

22

the Interstate Commerce Act provisions relating to rail

23

consolidations would be essentially and materially

24

frustrated if employees were free to strike.

25

For these reasons, we suggest that the Court
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BROTHER HOOD OF

MR. ROSS;

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
As petitioners state, this case arises out of

10
11

a petition to review an order of the Interstate Commerce

12

Commission which purported to automatically exempt the

13

participating railroads from the provisions or

14

requirements of the Railway

15

contracts.

Labor Act in their labor

The case, however, involves much more than a

16
17

question of administrative law.

And as -- by the

18

questions of the Court today, apparently there is a

19

timeliness question that also arises.
However, that issue was presented to the court

20
21

below.

It was only an oblique reference in the petition

22

for writ of certiorari that

23

government in regard to the timeliness issue.

24

only, as I understand it, to the scope of the

25

Commission's order or what had been presented before the

was filed in the case by the

Isn't the Hobbes Act juridictional?

4

MR. ROSS;

Yes, Your Honor.

However --

5

QUESTION;

Well, if that’s the case, the

6

parties simply by agreeing not to raise it can’t confer

7

jurisdiction on us, can they?

8

MR. ROSS;

9
10

However, there are certain

exceptions that even the Court of Appeals below
recognized are applicable.
For example, in Eagle-Picher — and this was

11
12

also used in

13

that the instant case clearly presents a situation which

14

the petitioners claim ripened after the expiration of

15

the statutory period due to changed circumstances

resulting from a misleading

MR. ROSS;

20

But I'm

21

just referring to the fact that what really is present

22

before the Court today basically gets to the merit of

23

the case.

24

25

Commission’s past practice and its well-established

Whether the Court should enter into the

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

precedent was in this case.
QUESTION;

2

But if all that was properly

3

brought to the Court of Appeals was a refusal of the

4

Commission to, in effect, rehear a petition to clarify,

5

I would think the standard of review would be

6

dramatically

7

the merits before it properly?
MR. ROSS;

8
9

different than if you were really bringing

Well, Your Honor, the thing was is

this, that it's come up in previous decisions of the

10

Court;

11

had no idea that the Commission’s order that was issued

12

in October of 1932 had the function that is now being

13

claimed by the Commission that it had; that in other

14

words that the collective bargaining agreements had been

15

effectively abrogated by the Commission’s decision.

16

The organizations, the employee representatives,

All past precedent that the Commission had

17

ever issued before indicated that it had no jurisdiction

18

over collective bargaining matters; that it had no

19

authority in labor relation

20

matters.

Rather the Commission even as -- in 1977, it

21

says that we have no jurisdiction, either to impose crew

22

assignment provisions or to remove crew assignment

23

provisions.

24
25

QUESTION;

But the merger agreements it

approved specifically said that the railroads would or
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

might use their own crews,

Those were the agreements

that were approved.
HR. ROSS;

But, Your Honor, that had never

represented what actually was going to take place.

In

every previous case that had come before the Commission,
the Commission merely put -- approved the financial
transaction between the railroads.
It

never indicated that by doing that that it

was making employees rearrangements.
that it wasn't tampering at

.And it always said

all with the collective

bargaining agreements, or making any accommodation
insofar as to the employee work rights.
QUESTION;

Had all these other ones contained

specific provisions like that where the railroads said
that they would use their own crews?
HR. ROSSr

Yes, Your Honor.

For example, I

was going to get to that, this Court, in PLEA v. ICC in
1964, remanded the Southern

Central of Georgia case back

to the Commission because the Commission purportedly had
not inserted Sections 4, 5 and 9 of the Washington
agreement in the employee protection.
And when it went back to the Commnission as a
result of that, the Commission was confronted with the
very same case that is here before the Court today.
Southern Railway in that case, on remand to the
31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The

1

Commission, said, since the rearrangements were

2

contained in oar initial application, that means that

3

the Commission’s approval of the transaction permitted

4

us to discharge the Central employees and give all of

5

the jobs to the Southern Railway employees.

6

Further, the Commission said at that time that

7

as a result of that the carrier was not required to give

8

notice as would normally be required — they would

9

normally be required to do under Section 4 of the

10

Washington job — or the Commission-imposed conditions,

11

which at that time were the Mew Orleans conditions.

12

The Commission said, no, you have to file

13

notice.

14

organizations .

15

You have to give notice to the employee

And the reason for that is, is that when we

16

imposed the condition, we did not make any

17

rearrangements of work forces.

18

except place into effect the monetary conditions for the

19

protection of employees who might be displaced or

20

dismissed; and also provided a means whereby there would

21

be a selection and allocation of work forces.

22

meant, in effect, that the parties would sit down and

23

negotiate, after a certain period of time vhen the

24

notice had been served, and

25

the equities, or if they were unable to dc that,

We didn’t do anything

that

that would be submitted to arbitration.

2

And that's the glue --

3

QUESTION:

4

That's the case in which the

consolidation agreement said specifically that -HR. ROSS:

5

The Southern Railway employees

6

would have all of the jobs, or most of the jobs.

7

specifically stated that.
QUESTION:

8
9

It

What is the citation -- is that the

only example that you have of how the Commission

10

prevoiusly has written opinions like this that didn't

11

mean what they appear to me to mean on their face?

12

HR. ROSS:

13

and the discussion,

14

173.

15

mentioned this Court's decision in HcLean v. U ,S ., an

16

antitrust case, in which the Commission read that -- and

17

I believe that the Court's decision specifically say

18

that there had to be an accommodation between Interstate

19

Commerce Act

20

Section 11341*s predecessor did not automatically exempt

21

the railroad from the antitrust laws; that there had to

22

be something

I believe, was at pages

165 through

And I believe that at page 165, the Commission

and the Antitrust Act, that it didn’t --

more than that.

The Commission also cited the decision of the

24

Fifth Circuit in the Texas and New Orleans case, which

25

they — the Commission said required it to achieve some

type of accommodation with Section 5 paren 11 of the

2

Interstate Commerce Act which was the predecessor of the

3

Section 11341, did not automatically exempt the carrier

4

from the Railway Labor Act requirements or the contracts

5

that were in effect at that

6

As

time.

we see it, Ycur Honor, actually the

7

Interstate Commerce Act and

the Railway Labor Act are

8

consistent with each other;

that the bond that holds the

9

two acts together is the employee protection; that the

10

only thing in this case that had to be done under those

11

employee protections would be the selection and

12

allocation of work, forces.

13

,

And as I indicated, that strictly is a

14

determination as to the equity between the various

15

employee groups that were involved.

16

Insofar as what would occur after that, the

17

rates of pay, where the home terminal and away-from-home

18

terminal would be, suitable lodging at the

19

away-from-home terminal, or those kinds of matters,

20

those would be dictated by the existing collective

21

bargaining agreements.

22

And as we’ve indicated, consistently

23

throughout 63 years of the ICC administering the

24

Interstate Commerce Act and the Railway Labor Act, the

25

two acts have existed together.

And therefore, we had understood that those

As a matter of fact, we thought that Section

11341*s language, which says, as necessary to effectuate

6

the transaction, that that language has some meaning.
As we find out now, the ICC some 20 years

7

8

later,

following Southern Central of Georgia, says, that

9

that is superfluous language.

That really is not

10

necessary at all.

When in the Southern Central of

11

Georgia case, it said that there had to be an

12

accommodation between the Railway Labor Act and the

13

Interstate Commerce Act.
And in regard to the suggestion that this

14
15

Court’s decision in Schwabacher v. United States

16

disposes of the entire case, I think that Schwabacher --

17

which arose in 1943 -- must be read in conjunction with

18

this Court’s decision in Burlington Truck Lines v.

19

United States, where the Court said that the Commission,

20

when it got into labor relations, was dealing in a very

21

delicate area; and therefore, it was required to

22

accommodate the Interstate Commerce Act with the Railway

Labor Act.

MR. CLARKE:

Thank you, Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
At

the beginning it might be wise to go back

18

to the jurisdictional questions that's been raised here

19

in the arguments.

20

When the ICC's order — and that's the

21

controlling aspect -- is looked at, the order shows that

22

rail labor's position was what the order imposed; not

23

what the Katy and the Missouri Pacific several months

24

later said the order meant.

25

The ICC’s order that was issued in October of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1932 said that the trackage right application of the

2

Katy and the Bio Grande were approved, but to the extent

3

specified in the decision, and subject to the conditions

4

for the protection of employees.

5

The conditions for the protection of

6

employees, as required by 11347 of the act, specifically

7

required two things that are relevant to what we're

8

dealing with here.

9

One, that the carriers, in consummating the

10

transaction, had to preserve rates of pay, rules, and

11

collective bargaining agreement of the employees.

12

they shall be preserved until changed by applicable

13

statute or collective bargaining.
Secondly,

14

And

the conditions required that the

15

and imposing an obligation on the parties to consummate

those transactions in compliance with those orders, with

the employee protective conditions.^

5

Now, implementing agreements under the

6

Interstate Commerce Act are not to implement the

8

carriers are saying, but historically, back from the

time they were first -- the requirement was first

requirement in Article 1, Section 2, that they preserve
collective bargaining agreements.
Historically, as we've shown in the
arbitration decisions attached to the brief by the UTU,
the Commission's decisions have not been viewed as
abrogating or authorizing the abrogation cf collective
bargaining rights.
QUESTION:

Well, MR. Clarke, I still don't

understand, if you're right that the ICC just doesn't
have authority to upset these collective bargaining
rights, and if you read in the application what the
intention of the merging railroads was with regard to
the crews, you could see for yourself that that was not
in accord with your view.
MR. CLARKE:
QUESTION:

That's correct, ma’am.
Why, then, wouldn't you have gone

into the ICC hearing initially and said, eliminate that
from the application?
MR. CLARKE:

We did.

We did. Your Honor, and

that's the one thing that’s being ignored in this case.
When the applications were filed by the Katy and the Rio
Grande for the trackage rights, rail labor, the UTU in
particular along with other unions, filed an opposition
to that -- to those applications and said, that if

(202) 628-9300

MR. CLARKE;

Yes,

Your Honor, because what

you’re dealing with in this case — and tc take it out
of the theoretical and put it down to the concrete -prior to the consummation of the transaction, January
3rd, when the Katy began operations, Missouri Pacific
employees performed that work.
Nov, suddenly, Katy employees are performing
that work.
QUESTION;

No, I’m assuming there’s no loss of

work on the landlord railroad.

Just, you supplement

additional operations over the same lines at different
times.
MR. CLARKE;

In that case.

Your Honor, the

employee protective conditions would most likely work
out an arrangement that would give the other carrier all
the rights, because it has the eguity to perform the
work.

But they’re still talking about it.
Now, in this case, the Missouri Pacific

employees who performed the work as of January 3rd or
January 6th suddently stopped.
Secondly, the Missouri Pacific employees went
to the Missouri Pacific and they said, negotiate with us
over two things;

One, whether or not the Katy can come

onto the property and leave us out of the picture; and
two, negotiate with us over what you are going to do

3

And the Missouri Pacific said,

we can’t

the parties were not goino to negotiate,

do it, become an order of the Commission?

2

Historically, it has never been an order,

3

because the carrier does not have to do -- consummate

4

the transaction in the way in which it says, in its

5

application,

6

it will do it.

If it says in the application, we’re going to

7

use one train crew for 200 miles, the ICC*s order

8

certainly doesn’t exempt that carrier from the hours of

9

service laws, which prohibit more than 12 hours of work.

10

And as a result of that, the application to

11

the Commission is nothing more than a general blueprint

12

which the Commission then uses to determine whether or

13

not the financial transaction, namely, trackage rights,

14

is in fact within the public interest.

M3. CLARKE:

Your Honor, that’s — I would ask

18

that you take a look at the Texas and New Orleans case.

19

Because in that case, the carriers did exactly what

20

they’re doing here.

21

They put in their application an employment

contract which they said would govern the consolidated

23

work.

And it put all of the Southern people on the rosters,

And the Commission said that our order didn't
go that far.
You go back and you take a look at the
arbitration decisions that were filed, up until

1983.

And two of them were attached -- two arbitration

decisions were attached to the UTU brief.

a tremendous history, including a

But I think perhaps the most fundamental issue

is the question of Commission approval, and the effet

that it has in connection with the employee protection

6

First, I would note that in every case cited

actual combining consolidating carriers themselves.

The Missouri Pacific, the Union Pacific and

the Western Pacific have honored the employee protection

14

displacements resulting from their acquiescing in the

15

condition imposed by the Commission that the Katy and

16

DSGW be permitted to operate trackage rights utilizing

17

their own crews.

18

There is no case anywhere hcldina that in the

context of an imposed condition, or even in

20

of a trackage rights situation, where the Commission has

21
