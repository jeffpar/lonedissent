CRAL ARGUMENT CF THECDORE B. OLSGF, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. CLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case comes to this Court on writ of

11

certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals after

12

that Court reversed a District Court summary judgment in

13

favor of petitioners.

14

This case presents a conflict between two

15

statutes.

16

for any employment purpose on the basis of pregnancy.

17

California law, on the ether hand, requires

Federal law forbids employers to discriminate

18

employers to provide special job protections to

19

employees disabled by pregnancy.

20

The question presented by this case is whether

21

the federal mandate of equal protection prevails ever

22

the state policy of special protection.

23

The facts of this case are as follows.

Title

24

VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the

25

1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the PDA,

makes it an

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

unlawful employment practice to discriminate against any
individual on the basis of sex, including pregnancy.
The PDA expressly

requires that women affected

by pregnancy shall be treated the same for all
employment-related purposes as persons experiencing
other disabilities similarly affecting their ability to
work .
Petitioners comply with Title VII by
implementing employment policies which treat pregnancy
exactly the same as other temporary conditions which
might affect an employee's ability to work.
Such policies vary, but as relevant here, do
not provide immediate guaranteed reinstatement rights on
return from disability.
In contrast, California's statute requires
employers to

grant up to four months' leave for

pregnancy, with a right to return to the same or similar
position.
As respondents' brief puts it, and summarizes
the California requirement,

the California statute

guarantees reasonable unpaid leave and reinstatement of
female employees disabled by pregnancy; and thus ensures
that pregnancy disability will not cause female
employees to lose their gobs.
Petitioners' declaratory relief action was

(202) 628-9300

1

resolved in District Court on cross motions for summary

2

judgment based on stipulated facts.

3

The District Court ruled for petitioners,

4

concluding that the state law requires preferential

5

treatment for female employees, and

6

inconsistent with, and preempted by, Title VII.

7

The Ninth Circuit reversed.

8

There are two basic conflicts presented by

9
10

this case.

was therefore

In summary, they are as follows.
One, the equal treatment versus special

11

treatment issue.

12

States, the National Organization of Women, the United

13

States Chamber of Commerce,

14

Union, and numerous others contend that federal law

15

categorically and unambiguously forbids pregnancy

16

discrimination and requires that employers treat

17

pregnancy on

18

disabilities.

19

Petition,

along with the United

the American Civil Liberties

the same basis as other temporary

California adheres to a diametrically opposed

20

philosophy, that pregnancy requires that women be

21

treated differently in order that may be treated equally.

22

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Olson, I guess in theory,

23

an employer could comply with the California state law

24

by offering female employees the pregnancy leave, and

25

comply with Title VII by offering comparable leave tc

And if that is the case, how is the California

3

law preemptive?

4

way to approach it.

MR. OLSON;

suggest.

It is in theory one way to

And it is theoretically possible, as you

We submit that that is an end run, as the
United States put it in their brief, around

the

10

extension versus validation issue, which is the same --

11

which is the second issue that I was going to mention

12

and summarize; that in essence, it would require

13

employers to bring up the benefits that they are

14

required by California law to give to female employees

15

who are pregnant, to all employees suffering any

16

disability that would take them away from work.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. OLSON;

Hew would you dc that?
How would -- you would do it by

19

adopting a leave policy that would guarantee

20

reinstatement to work.

MB. CLSCN:

1

The thrust cf Justice C ’Connor 's

2

question, and the argument that has teen presented by

3

some of the participants in this litigation, is that

4

there isn’t tension between

5

statute because the California statute mandates

6

treatment for pregnancy in a certain way.
And the simple answer tc that is to give that

7

8

same treatment to all people for all disabilities.
Our response to that, in addition to what I've

9

10

Title VII and the California

already said

--

QUESTION:

11

Kr. Olson, is it quite fair tc

Justice C’Conncr’s question

13

disabilities, or for all comparable disabilities?
MR. OLSON:

14

to say, for all

All disabilities -- well, it would

15

have -- any -- as I understand the thrust of Title VII,

16

as amended by the Pregnancy Disability Act, it requires

17

that ail disabilities be treated the same based upon

18

comparableness in terms of the ability or inability to

19

work..
So that if a broken foot, an open heart

20
21

surgery, whatever it might be, would take you off for a

22

week or a month or two months -QUESTIONi

23

Well, if it would take you off for

24

a week.

Let’s say you had a broken foot that took you

25

off for two hours; or a sprained ankle or something.

That’s correct.

That’s correct.

And I don’t think you’ve discussed

that.

6

ME. OLSON:

The thrust of the requirement of

7

the California statute is that the job remain open.

If

8

you have to take leave because of pregnancy, Title VII

9

specifically

requires that women affected by pregnancy

10

shall be treated the same for all employment-related

11

purposes as other persons not so affected but similar in

12

their ability or inability tc work.
We submit that the — this continues to, in

part, respond to Justice C'Ccnnor’s question -- but that

15

the federal statute -- and in addition, summarizes the

16

first issue in this case — is that the federal statute

17

clearly mandates that pregnancy be treated the same as

other disabilities.

I just don't think it’s that clear cn the face
of the statute how far it reaches.
NR. CLSON;

Well, I suppose we wouldn’t be

15

here unless there was some debate on the other side of

16

that question.

17

At least the parties on the other side of this

18

case have made the argument that the statute does not,

19

in fact, say

20

what to me is its plain meaning.

But to the extent that it’s necessary to go to

21

the context in which the statute was passed, and the

22

legislative history which led up to the passage of the

23

statute, those produce for me, for the petitioners, the

24

same result.

25

This statute was passed in the context of
10

(202) 628-9300

1

Title VII, and against a backdrop of a concept that

2

special protections, given tc women, over the decades

3

and the centuries, in this country and elsewhere, while

4

intended beneficially to help women, have turned out tc

5

be -- to inhibit women in the workplace.
They've created the same type of stigma and

6

which have been selected out for special classification.

Congress specifically recognized the fact that

10

that kind of stereotype that had occurred was damaging

18

There's no question that it was -I mean, that was the immediate

cause of the passage of this act, as I understand it.
MR. CLSGN;

19

That was the immediate cause of

20

it.

But of course it was against the backdrop of

21

centuries, and more immediately, decades of legislation

22

which had provided special protection to women which had

23

been determined by many individuals, including many

24

women's organizations, as ultimately destructive to

25

women because they put the Image of women inside this
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

stereotype that somehow women needed to have extra

2

special protection in order tc be brought up to the

3

leve 1 of men .

4

The best way to put that, it seems to me, is

5

what your opinion, Justice O'Connor, for the Court in

6

the Mississippi University case was that if the -- and

7

this is a different situation, but the words I think are

8

appropriate -- that if the statutory objective is tc

9

protect members of one gender because they are presumed

10

to suffer from an inherent handicap, or tc be innately

11

inferior, the objective is illegitimate.

12

The American Civil liberties Union has said

13

the same thing in its brief, and I think better put than

14

anything that I could say.

15

State of California calls its disparate impact analysis,

16

which is in the state's brief, the American Civil

17

Liberties respcnded tc that in footnote 30 on page 24 of

18

their brief with these words:

19

without proof the state is willing to confirm what has

20

been said all along by the practitioners cf

21

discrimination, that pregnancy renders women less

22

reliable, less productive employees, absent more often,

23

more expensive: that is to say, fundamentally different

24

and handicapped.

25

In referring to what the

It is troublesome that

That is the backdrop against which the
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Pregnancy Discrimination Act was enacted.

2

it was the Gilbert case that was the immediate impetus

3

for Congress to pass that legislation.

4

QUESTION;

And of course

Mr. Olsen, supposing that this

5

Court were to affirm to the California judgment and say

6

that ycur employer, your client, had to treat all of its

7

leave policies the same way that it treats the

8

pregnancies which are required to be treated under

9

California lav.
How would that require you to change your

10
11

existing policy in the concrete situation?
MR. OLSON;

12

The concrete situation

-- and I

13

alluded to this in response to Justice O’Connor’s

14

initial question, is that it would require the change of

15

Cal Fed’s — the addition of Cal Fed’s policy, and all

16

other employees of the State of California, with respect

17

to every disability, their leave policy.
QUESTION;

18
19

20

Well, hew specifically, would it

work.?
MR. CLSON ;

It would have to be changed to

21

guarantee the right of reinstatement in the same way

22

that that’s guaranteed by the State of California and as

23

set forth in their policy as interpreted by the agency

24

interpreting it.

25

QUESTION:

In what situations new where a
13

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

person takes leave because of Illness or disability is

2

it common not to allow the person to gc back to the job?

3

HP. OLSON;

Well, employers policies vary, as

4

you might understand, all across the lot.

5

employers, depending on their size, might indeed give

6

employees the right to return to the job if the job is

7

open .
The California statute imposes a rebuttal

8

9

Seme

presumption that the precise same job may be held open

10

for the individual upon the individual's return.

11

for some business necessity, which is a very difficult

12

thing to prove in California under the requlatcry

13

standards, that job isn't available, then resort must be

14

had to finding a similar job.

15

And if

Other employers in the State of California

16

vary their relief policies,

17

adjustments tc persons returning from a broken foot cr a

18

19

circumstances that prevail at that particular employer

22

as California —

But there is no guaranteed statutorily mandated

What is California Federal's policy?

7

And Cal Fed will attempt to find

And the other petitioners, which are thousands

8

are California employers, have varying degrees of

9

reinstatement policies, none of which comport

10

necessarily with the requirement of California that it

11

be a guaranteed return to the same position.

12

QUESTION;

And also I suppose that if you can

13

imagine an employer without any disability leave policy,

14

in order to comply with both California and the federal

15

law they would have to adopt one.

16

NR. CLSON:

They would have to adopt a

17

California policy.

And the ether aspect of the answer

18

to the question, if one looks at the practical

19

consequences, if suppose California, as it does,

20

requires the reinstatement of the employee, and if an

21

employer decides voluntarily to reinstate other

22

employees, and if suppose a pregnant employee and a

23

person returning from a bypass surgery arrived back at

24

the same day, and if suppose circumstances, economics,

That is the effect of the

7

There is no question, I should say, that the

California authorities recognize that their statute is

10

QUESTION;

Mr. Ciscn, let me just ask you a

11

question about that example again.

12

Justice O’Connor’s suggestion, you say both statutes

13

apply,

14

those people

15

either statute?

It, in response to

I suppose the employer would have to give both cf
jobs, and then there *d be no violation of

ME. OLSON;

16

Well,

that’s theoretically

17

correct.

18

the employer will have to create another job.

19

There may only be cne job, which means that

QUESTION;

But under the California statute,

20

if we didn’t have Title VII, there might be no job; and

21

you’d still have to make cne available, wouldn’t you?

22

MR. OLSON;

23

QUESTION;

24
25

Maybe I misunderstand the statute.
With the limitations that are built

into the statute from a standpoint -QUESTION;

But it’s the same problem.

I mean

1

the difference between zero and one, and one and two, is

2

exactly the same, isn't it?

3

MR. OLSONi

Well, I think the practical effect

4

of that, Justice Stevens, is that these situations in

5

the real world, and we’re talking about thousands of

6

employers and large workforces and so forth, are going

7

to differ when one statute -- the whole California

8

mechanism for enforcement, to bring actions and provide

9

penalties and so forth, requires that you treat the

10

pregnant employee a certain way, and the employer is

11

deciding to voluntarily give certain rights to other

12

employees, it should be --

13

QUESTION;

No, but your hypothesis -- under

14

your hypothesis, I think you're assuming that the

15

federal statute applies and

16

requires that the male who has just had a bypass

17

operation coming back at the same time as a female who

18

just had a child must be treated alike.

19

20
21

22

And the minimum treatment for them is defined
by the California statute.
MR. CLSCN;

Well,

it would create practical

problems, because you would have --

in light of this Court's deicision Shaw v. Delta Air

14

bring a declaratory relief action as a facial challenge

against a state statute as approved by federal law; we

did not pursue that.

So what the state statute does is really a

very minimal intrusion on any employer's practices.

it requires them to do is to keep the job available for

2

pregnant workers.

3

MS. JOHNSTON:

I believe that’s a misreading

4

of the statute to say that pregnancy discriminat ion is

5

forbidden the same way as discrimination cn the basis cf

6

other disabilities is forbidden.

7

What it says is that you are to treat

8

pregnancy the same as other persons in their ability or

9

inability to work.

What California’s statute says is

10

that once women are once again able to work, they should

11

be given their jobs back just as anyone who has not

12

suffered from pregnancy.
And in fact, Cal Fed's analysis would lead tc

13
14

the absurd result that the guarantee against pregnancy

15

discrimination would have no substantive content; you

16

could treat pregnant employees as harshly as you treat

17

employees with other medical conditions.
For example, there is nothing unlawful under

18
19

Title VII if an employer chose to fire all employees

20

with, say, diabetes, whether or not that person was able

21

to work.

22

Clearly, they couldn’t do that under the PDA.

23

The flaw in Cal Fed's analysis, I think, is to equate

24

pregnancy discrimination with discrimination against

25

other disabilities.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And it's a very

5

of the PDA is that if the same treatment always

that you can treat pregnancy as badly as you treat every

other medical condition, then that undercuts this

We do argue that the disparate

in a Title VII case would have to be able to establish

MS. JOHNSTON;

That’s true.

And I think that

2

one interpretation of the second clause of the PDA, and

3

a very logical interpretation in view of this Court’s

4

dissent in Gilbert, which the PDA was intended to

5

affect, is that where there are other disabibilities,

6

other traits, which are inevitably linked to a

7

prohibited basis of discrimination, such as sickle cell

8

anemia and race, that it would be as unlawful to

9

discrimination on those characteristics as it is to

10
11

discriminate cn the basis of pregnancy.
QUESTION;

Why does the State of California

12

resist amending its statute to provide for complete

13

equality based on disability?

14
15
16

MS. JOHNSTON;

It

simply hasn’t gene that far,

Your Honor, and neither has Congress.
QUESTION;

So --

Well, Congress under Title VII, at

17

least the language of Title VII can be read, I think --

18

and this is the argument presented to us here today, and

19

I’m not suggesting vhat the answer is -- that state

20

statutes must treat employees equally.

21

MS. JOHNSTON;

And if that is the

22

interpretation that the Court chooses to adept of Title

23

VII, California has no problem with that.

24

is in maintaining our state statute.

25

VII also requires, obviously, employers also have to

Cur concern

And whatever Title

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

comply with.
So/ since it's a preemption case, ve really

2
3

don't advocate one interpretation of Title VII or

4

another, except to say that cur statute is not

5

preemptive, because we don't make any practices unlawful.

6

But when you consider providing pregnancy

7

disability, I think it’s important to keep in mind that

8

Title VII forbids sex discrimination , including

9

pregnancy discrimination.

And providing pregnancy

10

disability leave doesn't discriminate on the basis of

11

sex.

12

And maybe it doesn't even make sense to talk

13

about disability — pregnancy disability even in terms

14

of whether or not it discriminates against men.

15

that may be why in the Newport News case, this Court

16

found that it was ordinary sex discriminaticn, not

17

pregnancy discrimination, to provide the same benefits

18

to male employees and their

19

female employees and their spouses.

On

the other hand, it would be disastrous to

2

women if they risk losing their jobs if they decide to

3

have families.

4

So when it’s viewed in that light, it's

5

neither preferential nor prejudicial to either men or

6

women; it's simply an equalizer making sure that women,

7

like men, don't have to choose between employment and

8

childbirth, that they can combine both, and

9

can compete equally with men on that basis.

that women

10

And the concept of equality that California

11

would like the Court to keep in mind is that although

12

the basic principle is that

occur when persons are not similar situated.

basis of sex, and insuring that discrimination on the
basis of pregnancy does not

occur.

The PDA was intended to give effect to the
Court's dissent in Gilbert.

And one very critical

statement in that dissent, which the Ninth Circuit
relied upon in upholding the California statute, was the
statement that a realistic understanding cf today's
labor environment warrants taking pregnancy into
account *
And that's precisely what California has dene
as well as either other states.
Congress specifically noted

And in passing the PDA,

two of those states, Montana

and Connecticut, that at that time already had a statute
very similar to the one that's under consideration here.
So Ccngress was obviously aware of those
statutes, and said, federal law may not go that far.
But we're not preventing states, if they wish to, to do
something in addition .
And the state obviously has a very strong
interest in protecting the rights of both men and women
employees to keep working and not to lose their jobs on
a basis that the other group is net subject to.
But it's not just an adverse effect upon
pregnant employees.

It would be an adverse upon their

men to combine childbirth and employment; and can become

believe it’s still correct that California dees have a

The problem with a statute that singled out

persons from other countries, for example, for a higher
