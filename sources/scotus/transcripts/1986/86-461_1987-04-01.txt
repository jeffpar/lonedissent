The statute further provides that the Board may release

2

on parole prisoners only when the Board determines that

3

such release is in the best interest of society and only

4

when the Board concludes that the prisoner is able and

5

willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding

6

citizen.
The Montana Supreme Court in a series of cases

7

8

commencing in the early 1960*s has construed parole

9

under our statute as creating only a privilege or an act

10

of grace and not a right.

In 1962 in the case of Goff

11

versus State, the Court held in the context of an

12

initial parole decision denial that, "Because of the

13

discretion vested our Board

14

decisions were not reviewable by state courts.”

under our statute, such

Several years later in another case. In Be

15
16

Frost, our Court held that merely because an inmate

17

satisfied the minimum time of incarceration requirement,

18

that parole was not automatically required under the

19

statute.
The issue before the Court today must in the

20
21

petitioner’s view be resolved by answering a single

22

question;

23

reasonable expectation of favorable action upon his

24

parole application simply by virtue of the inmate’s

25

having satisfied the minimum time of incarceration

does the Montana

law convey to an inmate a

(202) 628-9300

1

requirements

which under the law are a condition

2

precedent to the right to even submit an application for

3

parole release.
This is question which, we respectfully

4
5

submit, was not straightforwardly addressed by the Court

6

of Appeals below, nor has it been addressed directly by

7

the respondents in their briefs before this Court in

8

this case.

believe must be answered negatively.

It is a question which the petitioners

In resolving this question —

11

QUESTION:

General Smith, may I just ask, the

12

statute certainly doesn’t give them that right because

13

it says they can't be released unless they meet the time

requirement,

15

the opinion of the Board, there is reasonable

16

probability the prisoner can be released without

but it says they shall be released when, in

Is it your view they don't have a duty to
release him even whan they make that finding?
NR. SMITH:

Your Honor, under our statute once

the Board of Pardons determines that the facts

underlying a

criteria the statute specifies, then under our law the

QUESTION:

2

So, he has a right to release if

those conditions ace met?
SR. SMITH:

3

If the Board determines in its

4

discretion that those conditions are met, that is

5

correct, sir.

6

QUESTION:

What are the three conditions?

7

SR. SMITH:

The three conditions are as

8

follows:

in Subsection 1 of 36-23-201 the statute

9

states that a prisoner shall be released on parole when

10

in the Board’s opinion such release can be effected

11

without detriment to the prisoner or to the community.
In Subsection 2 of that provision it states

12
13

that release shall only be ordered if the best interests

14

of society will be furthered and only whan the Board

15

concludes that the prisoner is able and willing to

16

fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen.

17

consequence, in the petitioner’s view, the statute sets

18

forth three general criteria which govern its decision

19

making .

20

As a

In resolving the question before the Court

21

today, the Court has substantial guidance from its

22

previous prisoner entitlement decisions involving rights

23

alleged or held to arise under state law.

24

importance today, of course, is the Greenholtz decision.

25

Of particular

There the Court initially held that the
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

existence of the mere possibility of parole, at least

2

under a state statute, did not give rise to a protected

3

interest.

4

Greenholtz is especially pertinent to our case.

5

The rationale for the Court's decision in

Because parole decisions depend, as the Court

6

stated in Greenholtz, upon an amalgam of factors some of

7

which are objective but many of which are purely

8

subjective evaluations by Board members based upon their

9

expertise or experience in the difficult and sensitive

10

task of evaluating the advisability of parole release,

11

there is no set of facts which have shown mandates a

12

favorable decision to the inmate.

13

Stated another way, under a typically worded

14

parole statute in this country an inmate has no

15

legitimate expectation at the outset of the parole

16

application process that a Board will rule favorably

17

upon his application because the nature of the decision

18

making that goes into that determination is so general

19

and so subjective.

20

Thus, as the Court further noted in

21

Greenholtz, a prisoner has at most a unilateral hope

22

that the benefit sought will be obtained, but not a

23

reasonable expectation of affirmative relief from the

24

involved decision maker.

25

QUESTIONi

What did the court of appeals say
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

here, that there was an expectation but they didn't

2

prescribe any procedures, did they?
MR. SMITH;

3

The court of appeals did not

4

directly address the question of whether a reasonable

5

expectation of parole release arises simply by virtue of

6

a prisoner satisfying certain time of incarceration

7

requirements.

8

stated that,

9

the Board determines that the three general criteria

The court of appeals instead apparently
"Because our statute requires release when

10

that I referred to before are satisfied, that the

11

construct of the statute is such as to create a

12

reasonable expectation -- excuse me, to create a liberty

13

interest.

14

QUESTI3K:

And your contention is that because

15

the second criteria is because it requires the opinion

16

of the Board as to reasonable probability that the

17

prisoner can be released without detriment to the

18

community, that is sufficiently subjective so there is

19

no reasonable expectation?

20

MR. SMITH:

The petitioner's view of the

21

statute is that it sets forth three general criteria.

22

The criteria

23

the first that appears in Subsection 1.

24

others in Subsection 2.

25

that the Chief Justice just referred to is
There are two

It is the petitioner's position that because

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

those criteria, taken in the aggregate, impose such

2

general release considerations that an inmate can have

3

no reasonable expectation that his set of facts will be

4

deemed by the Board to warrant favorable action on his

5

parole or release application.
QUESTION:

6
7

MR. SMITH:

9

Doesn't he expect it be decided in

way, Your Honor,

That is correct.

Stated another

the Board must conclude that the facts

10

underlying a particular parole release application are

11

such that its action to effect parole is not constrained

12

or inconsistent by any of the three criteria.
QUESTION;

13

Well, is it your position that — I

14

guess the complaint here is that the Board not only

15

didn't grant parole but it didn't say why.

16

MR. SMITH;

17

QUESTION;

Well -And it doesn't make findings.

18

you say that because there is not a liberty interest

19

there is just no constitutional imperative that the

20

Board make the findings the statute states, or deals

21

with ?

22

MR. SMITH;

The statute does not require the

23

Board to make specific findings with respect to a

24

particular parole release application.

25

QUESTION;

Do

Doesn't require them to write it

down or to say anything to the applicant?
MR. SMITH:

The second claim for relief in the

3

complaint states that the due process clause was

4

violated, or is being violated, by the absence of an

5

appropriate hearing process.

6

QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals, I take it

7

would, finding a liberty interest, does it dictate or

8

did it dictate that there should be a hearing or —

9

MR. SMITH:

No, four Honor, it did not.

The

10

only guestion before the court below was that upon which

11

the complaint in the district court had been dismissed,

12

namely whether our statute in the first instance creates

13

a protected liberty interest.

14

There was no issue of whether -- if it did

15

create a protected liberty interest, the hearing

16

processes accorded tie respondents sufficed under the

17

due process clause.

18

2UESTIDN:

19

your position, General Smith.

20

interest at all, does that mean in your view that the

21

Parole Board as a matter of federal law at least, could

22

whenever a prisoner served the requisite time and he

23

files an application for parole, reciting what the

24

statute says, and he says that he thinks he can behave

25

in the community and so forth, that the Parole Board

could simply sap, "We’re just not going to look, at your

2

application because we’re busy doing other things.

3

will arbitrarily deny it for the next six months."

We

Could they do that, consistently with the

4
5

Constitution?

Do they have any obligation to decide

6

whether he is entitled to parole or not?
MR. SMITH;

7

Your Honor, I believe that

8

question must be answered with reference to the statute

9

itself.

It states that within two months of a

10

prisoner’s eligibility data for initial consideration,

11

in other words within two months of that date upon which

12

he has served the minimum time of incarceration required

13

in the statute for consideration, the Board must review

14

his files.

15
16

There is no requirement in that provision for
hearing unless it grants a parole release application.

17

' However, a latec provision states that any person who

18

wishes to appear before the Board shall be allowed to

19

appear before the 3oard.

20

So, if an inmate submitted a parole release

21

application, and not all do at such time they become

22

eligible to submit an application, but if an inmate does

23

submit an application and does wish to appear before the

24

Board, then the Boari will schedule an interview.

25

Typically the Boari ioes that even without a request.

QUESTI3N;

question.

is it your position that the Board could simply say,

QUESTION:

But you do have some duties as a

2

matter of state la# but you say they are not sufficient

3

to impose any duties as a matter of federal law?

4

NS. SMITH:

No.

\s the Court held in

Hewitt

5

versus Helms and in Olin versus Hakinekona, the mere

6

existence of mandated procedures in a penal system

7

setting does not in itself give rise to a protected

8

liberty interest or warrant

9

under the due process clause.

10

QUESTION:

protection in and of itself

Mr. Smith, do you take the position

11

that Montana state law requires the state to do exactly

12

what Greenholtz would say are the minimum requirements

13

in any event if it were a matter of federal law: namely,

14

an opportunity to be heard by the prisoner and to give

15

some reasons for denial?

16

MR. SMITH:

It is our position that the

17

current procedures being utilized by the Board are

18

consistent with due process requirements, but again that

19

is an issue which has not been litigated.

20

QUESTION:

Are they consistent with the

21

requirements espoused in the Greenholtz case?

22

Montana state law comply with what this Court said in

23

the majority opinion in Greenholtz was required under

24

the Nebraska statute?

25

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

1

So, what's at stake here is not any

2

change whatever in Montana's procedure.

3

point you ace hoping we will make that whatever Montana

4

requires is not a federal requirement?

5

MR. SMITH:

6

QUESTION:

7

That is correct. Your Honor.
It wouldn't alter your handling of

the cases at all?
MR. SMITH;

8
9

It's just the

Well, what I would state is that

the respondents might disagree with my contention, and

10

it might be a matter of substantial litigation below at

11

the District Court level, or a protected interest to be

12

held created by the statute.
QUESTION:

13

One of

the difficulties for me with

14

this case is the very abstract proposition that's

15

presented.

16

interest kind of floating up there in the air and we

17

don't have any idea what the court of appeals thought

18

were the procedures that federal law required to

19

implement that interest.

The idea, is there a protected liberty

20

That's not your fault, I realize.

21

MR. SMITH:

The case, of course, went to the

22

court of appeals on dismissal of complaint for failure

23

to state a claim, and since

24

issue presented and that issue was the only question

25

addressed by the court of appeals --

it was a singular discrete

QUESTION;

But what did the plaintiffs ask for

2

in their complaint?

3

weren’t being provided by the Montana Parole Board did

4

they claim they were entitled to as a matter of federal

5

law?

What sort of procedures that

MR. SMITH;

6

Well,

the complaint is

7

particularly skeletal in nature and did not set forth

8

the precise kinds of procedures that the respondents

9

believed would be appropriate under the due process

10

clause.

11

that parole applications were being denied

12

inconsistently witn the criteria in the statute.

13

They suggested in their first claim for relief

They suggested in

the second claim for relief

14

that the parole release applications were being denied

15

without an appropriate hearing.

16

based on the Eight! Amendment that is not relevant to

17

our case today.

18

There was a third claim

So, to answer your question, the complaint is

19

not of much assistance in what respondents believe is

20

appropriate in this case.

21

QUESTION;

-- this lawsuit seeks to compel the

22

Board of Pardons to use proper criteria in determining a

23

prisoner’s eligibility and also when it denies parole to

24

explain its reasons?

25

MR. SMITH;

That’s right.

But again, I would

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

suggest that foe this case to be litigated on the merits

2

of what amount of process is due, the issue would expand

3

beyond a mere explanation and greater detail of the

4

reason .

5

There it ay be other hearings, for example,

6

access to files or perhaps whether or not notice of

7

hearings is timely given, matters of those kinds that

8

are not directly mentioned or referred to in the

9

complaint but which nonetheless might well become an

10

issue before the district court.
QUESTION;

11

General Smith, would you tell me

12

precisely why you think that the discretion conferred

13

upon your prison officials is greater and therefore the

14

expectation of release is less in this case than it was

15

in Greenholtz?

16

flabby language too.

17

I mean, Greenholtz had some pretty

Well, that's not

25

will substantially enhance his capacity to lead a

You could drive a

5

truck through those things,

6

couldn’t you?

Does somebody really say he could count

7

on being released in Greenholtz, and why is your system

8

conferring any mora discretion than that did?
M3. SMITH;

9

Your Honor, the statutory

10

construct in the Nebraska statute in Greenholtz stated

11

that a prisoner shall be released unless the Nebraska

12

Board of Parole determined that one of four statutory

13

criteria foe

14

presumptive right absent an affirmative finding by the

15

Nebraska Board to parole release.

deferral existed.

There was, therefore, a

Under our statute there is no presumptive

16
17

right to parole release because at all times the inmate

18

is required to justify his eligibility for release

19

consistently with the criteria under the statute.
QUESTION:

20

I

Why is that, because of the

21

"unless”?

mean, instead of using "unless" all your

22

statute does is use "subject to."
In Nebraska it said, "He shall be released

23

MR. SMITH;

The principal difference is a

6

difference which the court of appeals has noted,

7

there is under the Nebraska statute, again a presumptive

8

right to release simply upon fulfilling certain minimum

9

eligibility requirements under Nebraska law.

10
11

is that

Those

requirements also relate to time of incarceration.
I would respectfully submit that the

12

difference between the Nebraska law and not only the

13

Montana statute but virtually every — a large majority

14

of parole statutes in this country which contain release

15

criteria comparable or almost identical to those in the

16

Montana law, lies not in the amount of discretion which

17

is given to the parole decision makers, but in the

18

unigue -- as the Court put it in Greenholtz -- structure

19

and laguage of tie Nebraska

20

created a presumptive right subject to the feasance in

21

favor of parole release.

I would further note that there was an absence

23

it was noted in the majority

14

the question which we believe must be answered in this

17

suggestion that any statute which imposes substantial

18

limitations on a decision maker's discretion would

19

essentially eviscerate the first holding in Greenholtz

20

which was that the mere existence of a right to parole

21

release does not give rise to a protected interest.

22

The respondents*

It seems quite obvious that the respondents

are uncomfortable with the well-established standard and

24

that as a consequence they have been forced into the

MR. PEVAR:

Under this Court's decision,

MR. SMITH;

Thera are just three points I

Justice Scalia pointed out, through its regulations,

5

specifically in Section 20.25.505, the Montana Board has

6

adopted many of the criteria, in fact all the criteria

7

contained in

determining parole release applications.

First, as

There are, however, two critical differences.

10

In the introductory paragraph in that section the word

"shall" has been cianged to

12

order parole unless it determines that one of the

13

reasons for deferral does not exist.

HR. SMITI;

Well,

in the second section of

5

that portion it lists various factors which may be

6

considered by tie Board in determining whether to defer

7

or to grant release and the last of those factors is

8

factor "M" and it states, "any other relevant reason."
In conclusion, I would simply note that the

9
10

proposed standard suggested for resolving this case by

11

the respondents is in fact no standard whatsoever.

12

is a standard which essentially repudiates the reasoning

13

of the Court's prisoner entitlement cases beginning with

14

the 1974 decision in Wolff versus McDonald.

It

It leaves state decision makers, if adopted,

15
16

in the guaniary of determining at best fine and at worst

almost metaphysical guestions concerning the degree of

18

discretion that exists under a particular state

19

statute.

20

a standard which bears no support from previous

21

decisions of this lourt and it is a standard which we

22

respectfully submit should not be adopted .

It is a standard which is not workable.

May I ask just this, General

24

Smith.

In your view did the 1055 statute change the law

25

in any respect, or was it just precatory?

MR. SMITH;

1

I think the '55 law changed the

2

procedures and the substantive law significantly.

3

would simply note that the term, "subject to

4

restrictions," works both ways and for example —

MR. SMITH;

I believe it had no measurable

impact on the discretion of the Parole Board since

It was a substantial change in the

law because it imposed various procedures and it set

Purely procedure, no change in the

MR. SMITH;

Well,

to the extent that it

21

required the Board to determine that, for example, a

22

prisoner's release was in the best interests of society,

23

I suppose under prior law it could have determined that

24

a release was not in the best interests of society but

25

the prison was too overcrowded so it was going to

Under the new law, of course, that discretion

is minimized , so t.nere may have been some incremental

change in discretion but it certainly bears no logical

relationship to whether the statute creates a reasonable

expectation of release.
