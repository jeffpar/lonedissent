QUESTION;

Was there ever a judgment that the

use of secret testimony was illegal?
MR. SAYLOR;

No, Your Honor.

There was a

statement of the law by the

8

Appeals on that point, saying that the use of the

9

informant testimony by the officials under the facts of

this case was violative of Mr. Helms' due process rights.
No judgment, Your Honor; there was a remand at
that time to the court of appeals to consider —

To the district court?

MR. SAYL1R;

That was the only issue before the district court on

Well, what it it had held that they

were not immune?

had to do was determine the damages?

Then all the district court would have

Correct, Your Honor.
Because there would

have been a

judgment already — it would have been required by the

9

court of appeals' a aiding or opinion for the district

10

court to say

11

violative of due process?

12

that the use of the secret testimony was

MR. SAYLOR;

On remand, Your Honor, the court

13

of appeals instructed the district court to enter

14

summary judgment for Helms unless it found the officials

15

to be immune.

MR. SAYLOR;

QUESTION;

20

Right,

right.

And it also -So that, the district court had

nothing more to do with the law?

That's correct, except to

determine whether that law was clearly established at

the time of the --

QUESTION:

Exactly, exactly.

And if it had

So, his prison record included in

Right.
He asked for declaratory

judgment, and he asked for an injunction enjoining

22

prison officials from doing certain things, but also to

expunge his record.

24

QUESTION;

25

MR. SAILOR;

Correct .
He never got an injunction.

In

point of fact, on remand to the district court after the

Third Circuit had stated the law. Helms abandoned his

Well, he abandoned it, but isn't

I can't imagine they still have on his record .the fact

that he is guilty of a crime for which there is no

Hell, I guess he’s back in now.
That’s my understanding, but he

19

So, as

QUESTION!

So, what you are saving is, even if

20

one could construe the proceedings as removing the

21

stigma of conviction, whatever it is, it really wouldn't

22

have made him a prevailing party because he had no

23

interest in the nature of his prison record after he was

24

released ?

MR. SAYLOR;

Correct, Your Honor.

position, it

is going to encourage of necessity litigation beyond the

point vhere the results have any effect on the relief

available to the parties.

5

from statements of the law merely because defendants

6

want to avoid liability for attorneys* fees.

7

no effect on the relief available to their clients.

Of coarse, we took one part of the

MR. SAYLDR:

Your Honor, the

I think that the

whether

those awards take the form of damages or of fees.
Again, at least in some instances if you award

12

a plaintiff like Halms attorney's fees, officials are

13

going to be litigating statements of law despite their

14

entitlement to immunity even where there is no effect on

15

the relief available to the parties.

16

In

the absence of liability for damages and in

17

the absence of the entry of any other relief, a

18

government official's immunity is seriously weakened if

19

they are nonetheless held liable for attorney's fees.

20

As this Eourt has pointed out, as recently as

21

in the unanimous decision of Kentucky versus Graham a

22

liability on the merits and responsibility for fees go

23

hand in hand.

against, either because of legal immunity or on the

merits, Section 1983 does not authorise a fee award

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. WALLACE;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;
The civil rights attorney's fee provision and

20

other fee award statutes enacted by Congress provide for

21

the award of attorney's fees to prevailing parties as an

22

incident of litigation in which those parties succeed on

23

the merits of their claims.

24

intended to exalt attorneys' fees into a self-generating

25

force that will drive the merits litigation or transform

These statutes are not

1

the nature of the merits litigation.
That is the basic theme of the brief that we

2
3

have filed, and we believe a fundamental principle

4

reflected in

5

fees statutes, and preservation of that principle

6

requires in our view insistence that the statutory term

7

"prevailing party" be given meaningful and manageable

8

content.

9

this Court's decisions under the attorneys'

To be a prevailing party, the plaintiff must

10

receive some practical relief or benefit for himself on

11

the merits of his claim, whether by judgment, by

12

settlement, by consent decree or by voluntary action

13

taken by the defendant, and here the respondent did not

14

receive any such benefit or relief.

15

His damages claims were held barred by

16

immunity, and he failed to pursue any of his equitable

17

claims presumably because they were moot since he was no

18

longer in prison.

19

appeals said on his first appeal that his rights had

20

been violated but it did not rule on whether he was

21

entitled to any relief.

22

Now, it is true that the court of

This Couct's decisions make clear that a

23

litigant is not automatically entitled to equitable

relief, whether declaratory relief or injunctive relief,

MR. WALLACE;

Yes.

I would say my second

I don’t think he was entitled to a declaratory judgment

because his case was moot, in seeking equitable relief.

You don’t think if he had asked for

9

MR. WALLACE;

Probably not because he was no

longer in jail and the only basis on which his case

11

would not be moot would be for the court to be willing

12

to assume he might commit another crime and go back to

ON 3EHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. VESELY;

Mr.

Vesely.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

8

The case before you today is one dealing with

9

statutory construction, and

in the process of statutory

10

construction there are several things to look at, among

11

which are the statute itself and the legislative history.

17

Third Circuit's decision was correct, and I will attempt

18

to address that language today.

However, we feel there is strong

There are three basic focuses in the language

20

of the legislative history as to when we decide to shift

24

enforcing congressional policies; and third, when the

Where these policies have been furthered,

That is the pure and simple language we

As to the issue of the vindication of rights,
this language is repeated constantly throughout the

10

legislative history and it is repeated, not to be too

11

picayune about this but at least nine times within the

12

language of the legislative history.

13

Significantly, what is not contained in the

14

legislative history are concepts of personal benefit and

15

formal relief.

16

vindication of constitutional rights is the concept and

17

the expressed language of the fact that when an

18

individual succeeds on an important matter in the course

19

of litigation, that is a point at which Congress as

20

decided it is proper to shift the costs --

Obviously the concept of

10

"prevailing party" is the concept that all the courts

11

have been struggling over, so the word "prevailing" does

12

not have a finite definition.

13

The only point at

which there is reference to

14

that specific word "prevailing party" in that specific

15

context is they state, "A party can be perceived to have

16

prevailed when he succeeds on an important matter in the

17

course of litigation or he can prevail without obtaining

doctrine of immunity of federal officials such as was

11

involved here if you know you can get a judgment for at

12

least your attorney's fees so long as you get a court to

determine the issue of the merits before it determines

14

the issues of official immunity?
Doesn't it in effect invite lawsuits, which is

16

just exactly what the statute -- the doctrine of

immunity is designed to forestall?

18

MR. VESELY:

'

Well, I don't think it invites

lawsuits because what in fact invites lawsuits is the

fact that someone's constitutional rights have been

22

where that has happened all you are going to require is

that the same actions to accomplish the exact same

The damage concept in that

I think the simple answer to that

The very fact that the conclusion

I would be persuaded simply

by guotations from the legislative history in one House,

if the result seems that illogical.

16

MR. VESELY:

Well, I don't believe it is in

fact that illogical, because what you have is, you have

18

an expressed desire by Congress that in these certain

19

situations where these policies have been furthered, we

20

are going to shift the costs.

21

Now, they then leave it to the states to

22

decide how they are going to deal with that thing, but

it's really in essence, it's a legislative determination

way around it, to basically say under the facts -- even

QUESTION:

Well, what if a plaintiff in a case

1

MR. VESELY:

So, I don't believe that that’s

2

— for one, if we consider that to be a declaratory

3

judgment, the Declaratory Judgment Act specifically says

4

that declaratory judgments are reviewable.

5

However, if we do not specifically consider a

6

declaratory judgment, I believe this Court has held,

7

where you can show that a decision that has made — even

8

where the ruling has been in your favor is appealable

9

for purposes of -- if it has adverse consequences

10

against you and in fact, then you still have a live case

11

or controversy.

12

QUESTION:

So, then we are going to expand the

13

class of appealable orders from the district court by

14

virtue of the potential for attorneys’ fees?

15

MR. VESELY:

Well, I don’t necessarily think

That's a very important concept, I think, and

that's why Congress has said in this situation, even

5

though it may at times seem harsh, we are going to shift

7

QUESTION:

You would also agree, wouldn't you,

that you are going to have more appealable orders under

your theory than under your opponent's theory, officials

are going to be able to appeal more often and will

11

12

NR. VSSELY:

Well,

I -- the reality is, I

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. SAYLOR, JR., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL
MR. SAYLOR:

Briefly, Your Honor, in drafting

18

the fee statute Congress struck a balance, and that is

19

clear from the legislative history, between encouraging

20

civil rights suits to vindicate rights, on the one hand,

21

and fairness to the defendants that have to pay

22

attorneys’ fees on the other hand.

23

Congress didn’t take the private attorney

24

general concept to its logical extreme and it didn’t say

25

that all plaintiffs who bring non-frivolous claims are

entitled to fees, nor did it say the plaintiffs who

2

secure a favorable legal ruling are entitled to fees.

3

What Congress did say is that in order to receive fees

4

you need to prevail.

5

Helms didn’t prevail.

He got no damages.

He

6

got no injunction and he got no declaratory judgment or

7

declaratory relief, and I think, we need to be clear that

8

what he got from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals was

9

not relief.

10

The court said, "We therefore leave the issue

11

of official immunity to the district court on remand."

12

But it also said, "Further proceedings will also be

13

required to determine the appropriateness and the

14

availability of the requested relief."

15

In other words, they gave him no relief.

They

16

didn* come close to giving him relief, and they made it

17

clear thar if the man’s going to get relief on his

18

claims which

19

judgment that’s going to be done by the district court.

20

are damages, injunction and a declaratory

You also need to understand, Your Honors, that

21

shortly after Helms filed his suit he was parole from

22

prison.

23

That is the fact.
QUESTION:

24

Suppose -- the new regulations were

the result of his lawsuit?

25

Would you think then that

his release from prison -- say he was released from

prison the same day that they adopted the new

2

regulations so that he himself could never have gotten

3

any particular benefit out of the new regs.

4

Now, I take it that it's your position, is it,

5

that he's not entitled to attorneys' fees, even though

6

it's clear that there’s a connection between his suit

7

and the new regs?

8

NR. SAYLOR:

9

can I answer that in two parts, please, Your Honor?

All right.
Yes,

if the State changes its

response to a lawsuit so that the effect of

that change or cessation is to moot plaintiff's claim, I

think plaintiff is a prevailing party and entitled to

fees.

the government’s, that unless he himself is going to get

2

a benefit from the result of his case he isn’t entitled

to fees?

4

SR. SAYLOR:

That’s correct, because he

wouldn't have benefited nor

grievances — and Congress didn’t say, we’re taking the

So, even if he was the cause of the

new regulations he gets no attorney’s fee if he is
