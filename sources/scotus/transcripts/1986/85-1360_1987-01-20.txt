ORAL ARGUMENT OF

LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7
8

HR. GOLD:

Chief Justice Rehnguist and may it

please the Court:

9

In January 1982, Ms. Sally Hechler was employed

10

by the Florida Power & Light Company in a collective

11

bargaining unit representated by the International

12

Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and its Local 759.

13

that time, Florida Power S Light assigned Ms. Hechler to

14

do particular work, and in doing that work she was

15

injured .

16

Two years later, Ms. Hechler sued the IBEW and

17

Local 759 in the Florida state courts.

18

removed and the federal district court dismissed the

19

complaint.

20

We petitioned for certiorari and the case is now here.

21

At

The unions

On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit reversed.

Two sets of issues are presented:

First,

22

whether this case is governed by the federal labor laws;

23

and second, if so, whether the complaint was properly

24

dismiss ed.

25

Given the nature of the questions, we’d like to
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

begin by pointing the court to the complaint in this

2

case, most particularly paragraph 4, which is on page 4

3

of the joint appendix, the buff-colored document.

4

I’d like to read that if I could.

5

And

The complaint says;

"The defendants" — which are the unions --

6

"and each of

them, pursuant to contracts and agreements

7

entered into by and between these said defendants and

8

the said Florida Power, to which contracts and

9

agreements the plaintiff was a third party beneficiary,

10

and pursuant to the relationship by and between the said

11

defendants and the plaintiff

12

Hechler was a dues-paying member of said defendants, the

13

defendants owed the plaintiff the duty to assure that

14

the plaintiff was provided safety in her workplace and a

15

safe workplace; and further,

16

required or allowed to take undue risks in the

17

performance of her duties which were not commensurate

18

with her training and experience, or to work in an area

19

which was not safe as commensurate with her training and

20

experience."

21

whereby the plaintiff Sally

the plaintiff would not be

In other words, the complaint alleges that the

22

unions owed Ms. Hechler a duty to assure that she was

23

provided safety in her workplace and a safe workplace.

24

And the complaint alleges that the source of that duty

25

was first and

foremost in contracts and agreements
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

entered into by and between the unions and Florida Power

2

6 Light/ and the only agreements entered into between

3

the unions and Florida Power £ Light were a collective

4

bargaining agreement and ancillary agreements to that

5

collective bargaining agreement.

6

QUESTION;

Hr. Gold, the language you did quote

7

said too, though, that "and pursuant to the relationship

8

by and between the said defendants."

9

HR. GOLDj

Yes.

That’s why I said there are

10

two sets of issues. Chief Justice.

11

whatever duties are stated in the collective agreement,

12

and the second rests on the basis you just noted.

13

The first concerns

I would emphasize in that regard that, aside

14

from that phrase in the complaint, as we demonstrate at

15

length in our reply brief, this case was litigated

16

solely on the theory that the collective bargaining

17

agreement was the source of those duties.

18

That was the basis on which the district court

19

proceeded, that was the basis on which the Ccurt of

20

Appeals proceeded.

21

plaintiff’s paper in response to the motion to dismiss

22

and in the courts below focusing on the same document.

23

So in regard to your question, I would say two things;

24
25

One,

And we have quoted from the

we believe that this case is about what

duties, if any, were created by the collective
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

bargaining agreement and «hat law applies to those

2

duties.
Secondly, to the extent we're wrong about that,

3
4

we believe that, insofar as the plaintiff’s theory is

5

that there was a relationship between the union and the

6

dues-paying members the union was representing in

7

collective bargaining, that relationship too is governed

8

by federal law, and that the federal law preempts any

9

state law claims.
In other words, we believe that the phrase you

10
11

noted is not properly part of this case any more, but

12

we’re prepared to demonstrate on the merits that even if

13

it were it doesn't help the plaintiff.
It’s common ground here, I believe, that under

14
15

Florida law employers have an obligation tc provide a

16

safe workplace, but that members of -- employers have an

17

obligation to provide their employees a safe workplace,

18

and that negligence in that regard, to the extent that

19

you don’t have workers compensation blocking the claim,

20

is actionable as a matter of

Florida law.

So far as the complaint indicates or anybody

21

22

has argued in

this case or anything that we have found

23

in this case, in researching this case, Florida law does

24

not impose any such obligation in general cn third

25

parties.

There is no general law that each citizen of
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Florida must do whatever is in his rower to ensure other

2

citizens as employees a safe workplace or that

3

membership associations generally have such an

4

obligation.
Bather, the first theory that plaintiff alleges

5

6

here is that the union’s contracts and agreements with

7

Florida Power 6 Light constitute an undertaking whereby

8

the union assumes a'duty to the individuals the union

9

represents to assure safety in the workplace and a safe

10

workpla ce.
And obviously, the beginning then is what does

11
12

the collective bargaining agreement say and what dees

13

the collective bargaining agreement mean.

14

regard, it seems to us that this case is

15

indistinguishable from Aliis-Chalmers versus lueck, 471

16

U.S. 202.

17

And in that

In that case, the plaintiff, an individual

18

employed by A1lis-ChaImers and represented by a

19

different union, the UAW, brought a lawsuit alleging

20

that Aliis-Chalmers had breached a tort law obligation

21

to pay disability benefits due under a provision of the

22

collective bargaining agreement there in a prompt good

23

faith manner.

24
25

The court held that that claim in essence
stated a Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Act claim, even though it was denominated as a state law

2

tort claim.

3

Lueck is that state law rights and obligations that do

4

not exist independently of private agreements governed

5

by Section 301 are federal Section 301 claims.

The test as we understand it stated in

Beginning with Textile Workers versus Lincoln

6
7

Mills, this Court has held that all claims that it

8

denominated as claims resting on a collective bargaining

9

agreement are governed by a uniform set of federal

10

common law rules derived from the national labor policy,

11

and that that was Congress' intent in passing Section

12

301.

13
14
15

QUESTION;

Mr. Sold, do you characterize this

as a fair representation claim?
MR. GOLD:

We think that the true gravamen of

16

the complaint here , when you go through the collective

17

bargaining agreement, is that the union did not

18

undertake any threshold duties to run the Florida Power

19

£ Light Company or to make job assignments, and that the

20

plaintiff's real complaint here is that the union failed

21

to properly police the collective bargaining agreement.

22

In that sense, Your Honor, we do believe that

23

when all is said and done, the claim here, as was true

24

in Vaca versus Sipes, is a claim that the union failed

25

in its representational capacity.
3

They should have grieved and they

MR. GOLD;

That's -- the plaintiff here never

4

filed a grievance.

5

QUESTION;

2

didn * t.

This is what bothers me, because

6

your brief does characterize it as a fair representation

7

claim.

8

kind of situation has surfaced in that capacity.

9

And yet, I don't know of any case in which this

MR. GOLD;

Your Honor, if I could, it seems to

10

me that in that, in the sense you are referring to, Vaca

11

was precisely the same kind of case.

12

happened was that an individual was adjudged by the

13

company to be unfit to continue work.

14

examination, they told him he had a heart problem.

15

he complained

16

him back to work and brought a duty of fair

17

representation case against the union, claiming that the

18

union's position didn't advance his job-related

19

interests in a proper fashion.

In Vaca what

He had a medical
And

that the union hadn't done enough to put

20

What is at the bottom when you go through the

21

collective bargaining agreement here is that there are

22

various provisions providing that the company will make

23

assignments setting standards concerning the extent to

24

which the company is to take into account training and

25

safety considerations in making assignments.
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The claim here is that Ms. Hechler, who was

2

assigned to job A on a particular day and injured

3

very day, shouldn’t have been assigned to that job and

4

that the union should have done something about the

5

assignm ent.

The union did not assign her to the work, nor

did the company consult wi th

that

3o it is the claim --

QUESTION;

That the union should have objected

to her assignment, that’s the claim?
KB. GCLD;

That is the essence of the claim.

12

Now, the plaintiffs are not admitting that that is the

13

essence of the claim, and that’s why I begin by saying

14

that the threshold question here is who determines what

15

this collective bargaining agreement means and by what

16

law is the meaning of the collective bargaining

17

agreement to be determined.

18

And we believe that under Lincoln Mills and all

19

the cases through Lueck, whether the plaintiff

20

denominates her threshold claim, the one that rests cn

21

contracts and agreements between the company and the

22

union, as a contract suit, a tort suit, a state suit, or

23

a federal suit, in reality it is under this Court’s

24

decisions and

25

claim based on the collective bargaining agreement, one

under Congress’ enactment of Section 301 a

QUESTION;

Mr. Gold, what if the Respondent

4

here says, my claim has an independent source in Florida

5

law just by virtue of the relationship these people had

6

with one another; we're not relying on — she's not

7

relying on any particular provision in the collective

8

bargaining agreement?

9

MR. GOLD;

Well, insofar -- our answer to that.

10

Chief Justice, is

11

is that the relationship is the relationship between a

12

company and a union which is the exclusive collective

13

bargaining representative, that claim is a federal

14

claim, however it is denominated; that the relationship,

15

that relationship, has two components;

16

that insofar as the plaintiff's claim

Component number one is, where the parties have

17

reached a collective bargaining agreement, the promises

18

exchanged in the collective bargaining agreement fairly

19

read against a background of federal common law.

20

second relationship is this triangular relationship

21

between the company, the union, and the individuals who

22

are employed under the collective bargaining agreement,

23

and as to that relationship we believe that it is the

24

federal common law, expressed in the duty of fair

25

representation, which is the sole measure, that the

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. GOLD:

Thank you, Chief Justice.

Before lunch we were discussing the point that

11

the plaintiff’s primary claim and, as I noted to the

12

Chief Justice, the only claim she pressed in the Court

13

of Appeals and in her brief in opposition to certiorari
l

14

in this Court is that under the collective bargaining

15

agreement between the Florida Power & Liqh t Company and

16

the unions in this case, the unions have a duty to

17

assure employees covered by that agreement a safe

18

workplace, and that the union had breached that duty and

19

in doing so the plaintiff’s claim is that the union had

20

breached a common law obligation imposed by the tort law

21

of the state of Florida.

22

Our first response to that claim is that under

23

this Court’s decision in Allis-Chalmers versus Lueck,

24

the plaintiff’s claim is perforce one which arises under

25

Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act,
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

because it depends on the collective bargaining

2

agreement and is governed not by state law but by the

3

uniform federal common law of collective bargaining

4

agreements stated in Section

301.

I noted that, and I’d like to develop a bit

5
6

more, that under the National Labor Relations Act and

7

the Labor Managment Relations Act, Congress has created

8

a system of free collective bargaining, and Congress

9

enacted Section 301 as a component part of the free

10

collective bargaining system to provide the means by

11

which the meaning and effect of collective bargaining

12

agreements would be determined.
The federal interests that Congress determined

13
14

were paramount are the interests in uniformity and

15

predictability.

16

should mean the same thing in Florida that it means in

17

Georgia.

18

national in scope.

19

A collective bargaining agreement

Many collective bargaining agreements are

And the parties, if they are going to do what

20

Congress wished, which is to create their own system

21

within the limits of the law that meets their particular

22

situations, should know that if they include a

23

particular provision in their agreements it will mean --

24

it will be given a meaning that is consistent with and

25

derived from the common law of contracts based on the

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Gold, is it clear that th ere is

3

no conceivable sta te cause of action that could h ave

4

come within this c omplaint that would be based ne ither

5

on the collective bargaining agreement nor union the

6

union’s duty of fa ir representation?

7

What if t ha state said that all unions h ave an

8

obligation to assu re that their members are adequ ately

9

trained for the jo bs that they do?
MR. GOLD:

10

First, Justice Scalia, it's t his

11

complaint, and we* re saying that nothing pleaded in

12

paragraph 4 of thi s complaint goes that far.
Secondly, it would be our view that the sta te s

13
14

could not impose t hat kind of obligation, at leas t

15

insofar as the uni on was a collective bargaining

16

representative, th at that would conflict with the body

17

of —

18

QUESTION.*

Shy?

That has to do with the direct

19

obligation between the union and its members.

20

doesn 't require th e employer to be brought into t he loop

21

at all.

22

MR. GOLD:

It

Well, insofar as the state im poses a

23

general obligation on unions and membership

24

associations, incl uding the AAA, to train people, that

25

may be one thing.

But what I was visualizing is that a
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

state then uses that law to provide that a union which

2

does not stop

3

untrained --

an employer fro.m hiring somebody who's

4

QUESTION;

That gets into fair representation.

5

MR. GOLD;

That's right, and that's what this

QUESTION;

And your point here is that the only

6
7

case —

8

thing alleged in the complaint has to be some claim that

9

the union should have gotten the employer to do

IO

something?

11

MR. GOLD;

That's right.

12

QUESTION;

Not that the union itself should

13
14

have done something.
MR. GOLD;

That's right.

If there was a claim

15

that in essence the state of

16

basic common law on volunteers and so on and that unions

17

had some general obligation to provide training or do

18

good, I don't know where we would be.

19

Florida was changing the

But the practicalities are that here what

20

happened was that the employer hired Ms. Eechler and the

21

employer assigned Ms. Hechler, and she was injured doing

22

the work the employer had assigned.

23

is not that the union had some general duty to train; it

24

was a duty to provide her with a safe workplace.

25

And the allegation

And the only status the union had to provide
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

her with a safe workplace, since it was not the employer

2

itself, was in its relations with the employer, and the

3

only relationship the union had with the employer was as

4

an exclusive bargaining relationship.

5

And what we argue is that under Lueck, insofar

6

as the union and the employer consummated that

7

relationship under a collective bargaining agreement,

8

the meaning and effect of the agreement ought to be

9

determined under Section 301

10
11

by federal law.

And we

don't say what the agreement means.
We don't say that there are no implied

12

obligations under the agreement.

13

is a federal question, and we say that insofar as it is

14

alleged that the union, because of the unicn-member

15

relationship, has an obligation to provide members with

16

a safe workplace, insofar as the union is acting as

17

collective bargaining representative, that obligation is

18

to be measured by the duty of fair representation.

19
20

QUESTION:

We just say that that

Mr. Gold, just how much notice did

Ms. Hechler have before she was assigned to that job?

21

MR . GOLD:

So far as --

22

QUESTION;

The record doesn't show, does it?

23

MR. GOLD:

It doesn't show. Your Honor-

All we

24

know is that she was assigned and on the very day she

25

was assigned she was injured.

notified that she had been assigned to that job?
MR. GOLD:

3

After she was injured, and that

obviously in terms of the union's situation,

ability to do anything about it, was all after the

fact.

grievance about the assignment.

MR. GOLD:

aren't they?

The earlier A1lis-ChaImers

Absolutely.

I mean, insofar as the

union undertakes to do things outside of its

representational capacity, that presents issues that are

entirely separate.

21

have no doubt that there are many other examples, that

provides a place to meet and so on, if it doesn't have

The best case for that is the Kuser-Cardinal

7

decision in 1966, which permits in a certain kind of 301

be 50 different state statutes implicated in a given

offend the policy of the labor laws.

12

Therefore, the adjudication even of a federal

participation in the safety council which was set up by

9

the collective bargaining agreement to make sure that

13

I think it

Appeals consider that

Now we move from the issue of -- from the

14

question of whether there are federal issues in our

15

complaint to the question of whether a complaint based

16

on purely state law obligations would be preempted under

17

the Machinist’s theory because it is the duty of fair

18

representation that occupies this field, this field of

19

pre-grievance relationships.

20

And I can't stress too strongly -- first of

21

all, we haven’t abandoned that in the slightest.

22

there’s something ironic about the claim that we would

23

be held to have abandoned a theory which is admitted to

24

be explicitly pleaded in the one pleading which ve have

25

2

after ve filed that pleading, and this theory is

3

explicit in that complaint.

4

In addition, we submit that it is inherent in

5

the circuit court's opinion in this case.

The circuit

6

court certainly had no trouble recognizing that we were

7

embracing state and federal law claims. . It said at page

8

794 of volume 772 that, though the contract may be of

9

use in defining the scope of

the duty owed, liability

10

will turn on basic negligence principles as developed by

11

state law.

12

The circuit -- the Court of Appeals certainly

13

understood that, while a contract may be of use in

14

defining the duty, it certainly wasn't the exclusive

15

source of that duty.

16

And of course, in our response to the cert

petition we said the same thing.

18

Hechler*s claim is that the unions were negligent in the

the fact that the duty of fair representation is to

assure that the union treats members and non-members the
