ORAL ARGUMENTS MARK L. ROTERT» ESQ.*
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR* ROTERT*

Mr* Chief Justice* and aay it

please the Court;
Your Honors* the petitioners have raised three

11

issues for consideration by the Court in their briefs*

12

but today I*a only going to discuss the first and the

13

second issue* and I*d like to divide my tine roughly

14

equally between the two issues*

15

First* today* I'd like to discuss the first

16

issue in the brief* and that question is whether or not

17

it is always Inappropriate to attempt to apply the

18

standards of Chapman v* California to an asserted

19

violation of due process of law that arose under the

20

rule of Ooyle v. Ohio*

21

And the petitioner's position in this regard

22

nay be very succinctly stated*

We believe that it is an

23

oxymoron* and an Inherently contradictory statement* to

24

say on the one end that error occurred which was so

25

serious that It rose to the level of a deprivation of

Well* If that were In fact the rule* It would

be an unusually harsh rule*

It would read more facts

into Doyle than Doyle itself contains*

5

a rule that was disproportionate to the harm suffered by

tradition that due process clause cases are not designed

It would create

Therefore* we submit that the more appropriate

9

10

analysis In this case Is to examine a violation of the

11

Doyle rule* and to treat that examination in what we

12

might refer to as the traditional due process model*
This would require that a defendant would bear

13
14

the burden of showing that when the Doyle violation Is

QUESTIONS

And once you find that there has been a

T

lack of fundamental unfairness* there's been a lack of

2

fundamental unfairness*
It seems to me the logic of your position Is

3
4

that you don't make any kind of a harmless error Inquiry*
HR. ROTERTs

5

Well* I don't equate the

6

violation of Doyle rules with a violation of due process

7

such as creates a fundamental unfairness*
I believe If Doyle is read as a case that was

8
9

10

decided on the basis of its own unique facts* Doyle
makes some Implicit assumptions*
One of the implicit assumptions in Doyle is

11
12

that post-Miranda warning silence were used by the Jury

13

to draw negative inferences about defendant Doyle's

14

credibility! that resulted in a breach of the Implicit

15

promise of Miranda* and rendered the trial fundamentally

16

unfair•
But by describing Doyle in that fashion*

17
18

Justice Scat la* I hope I have demonstrated that there

19

are more elements to Doyle than merely looking to see

20

whether the prosecutor commented* in the presence of the

21

Jury* on post-Miranda warning silence*
QUESTION:

22
23

that*

Oh* well no* I didn't understand

So every Doyle violation is not a Doyle violation*

24

MR* ROTERTs

25

QUEST IONS

Every Doyle —
I mean* every time you make that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

ir

kind of a statement you haven't violated Doyle?
MR* ROTERT;

2

You may violate the rule of the

3

Doyle case* but that does not end the inquiry of whether

4

or not you have violated due process of law by creating

5

a fundamentally unfair proceeding*
QUESTIONS

6

So every Doyle case involves a

7

haraless error inquiry before you even find a Doyle

8

violati on?
HR* ROTERT;

9

No* It's not precisely a haraless

10

error inquiry*

I would analogize it to the Strickland

11

v* Washington inquiry*

12

there is a violation* you must assess prejudice*

Before you determine whether

Prejudice is a necessary component of

13
14

declaring that there has been a violation of due process

15

of law*
Now 1 think that this — this proposition that

16
17

I proffered to the Court this afternoon is reflected by

18

a comparison of the facts of Doyle with the facts of

19

this case*
QUESTION;

20

Hay I Just Interrupt with one

21

question?

22

apply equally whether the challenge is made on direct

23

review or on collateral attack?

24

HR* ROTERT*

25

Does this argument that you're now making

appreciate that*

It does* Justice Stevens* and I

Hy first argument says that Doyle

violations have a prejudice requirement no aatter what

2

the context in which they're raised.
My second argument talks about the specific

3
4

application of Chapman v. California* in the context of

5

habeas review.
It's an assuming arguendo.

6

If the Court

7

doesn't believe ae when I say that there's a prejudice

8

coaponent to Doyle* if the Court agrees with the

9

aajority* in fact* the unanimous weight of the Federal

10

circuits* that Chapman applies to Doyle* then I think we

11

have to take a look at whether or not Chapman serves a

12

utilitarian function in habeas corpus* and we'd like to

QUESTIONS

14

Mr. Rotert* I didn't see that this

15

was the question presented for review* what you're

16

telling us this afternoon.
I think I'm understanding you to say* we

17
18

shouldn't treat a Doyle error as a determination in and

19

of itself that there has been any error of a

20

constitutional nature.

1

Doyle was a case in which this Court had an opportunity

2

to discuss both what elements constitute a violation and

3

what remedial steps are required if there's been a

4

violation.

5

I think that the case Is one that was decided

6

on its own facts* and including In those facts* I would

7

remind the Court* the State of Ohio expressly declined

8

to ask the Court for a remedial determination* a

9

determination of what remedy should obtain if there is a

10

deprivation of constitutional rights.
So in that sense* we're not asking for a

11
12

reanalysis of Doyle.

We're not asking — or attacking

13

the fundamental premise of Doyle.
We're saying that Doyle is subject to

14
15

misconstruction because of the facts and circumstances

16

it raised.

17

complete deprivation of due process.

Those facts and circumstances made a

What happened In Doyle was that the defendant

Jumble of answers.

22

because of his post warning silence.

23

And as Justice Stevens once noted* he gave a
He got hurt on cross-examination

In the context of that case* it should also be

24

noted* that the prosecutor argued that issue frequently

25

on closing arguments.

He directed to the Jury the

Now« one of the things that*s noteworthy about

3

the Chapman standard Is» according to this Court and

4

according to the lower courts* is* that if a state in

this case wants to show that error was harmless beyond a

6

reasonable doubt* we have to show Mr. Miller's guilt by

7

virtue of overwhelming evidence* a quotation taken

8

directly from any number of decisions by this Court.
If we're going to apply that overwhelming

9
10

evidence standard on collateral review* it should be

11

because the need to enforce Chapman on collateral review

12

outweighs the costs that are associated with that

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. PETERSONS

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice» nay it

The state has suggested that this Court adopt

6

a broad presumption in favor of harmless error in Doyle

7

cases.
In so doing» the state has not mentioned what

8
9

occurred at trial in this case.

I believe an

10

examination of what occurred at trial will reveal why

11

such a broad presumption should not be Imposed.
At trial In this case the prosecutor

12
13

characterized the evidence as a credibility contest

14

between the state's accomplice witness» Randy Williams»

15

and the defendant» Charles Miller.
During his closing arguaent to the jury» the

16
17

prosecutor stated* what it really boils down to here is»

18

who told you the story and who told you the truth.

19

either believe Randy Williams or you believe Charles

20

Milter.

You

It's as simple as that.

21

Recognizing that the outcome of this case was

22

And I would cite this Court the cases that

41

deal with coerced confessions* the Santobello cases*

5

that fundamental fairness is no different in this case*

6

In coerced confessions* the prosecutor tricks

7

or the state and the authorities trick or deceive

8

9

of due process* because trickery and deception are

10
11

That's a violation

fundamentally unfair*
In tne Santobello v* New York situation* where

12

the prosecutor enters into a plea bargain with the

13

defendant* and he promises him he'll recommend a

14

specific sentence* and when the defendant is then

15

induced into giving a certain plea* the prosecutor comes

16

back and recommends a greater sentence to the judge.

That is fundamentally unfair*

18

And 1 would submit in that case the error

could also be harmless.

prosecutor agrees to recommend the minimum two-year

sentence In exchange for the defendant's guilty plea*

The trial Judge

15

Under those circumstances» where the trial
