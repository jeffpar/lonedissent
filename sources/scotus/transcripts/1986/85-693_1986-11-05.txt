Do you pronounce

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

Narrowly viewed, this case

25

I therefore do not address the case with the

narrowest of grounds,

neglect that broader issue, but instead would propose to

2

address it on

3

that issue, rather than the narrower one.

Both parties here start with World-Wide

4

Volkswagen.

5

interstate case rather than a case involving an

6

international relationship or a foreign defendant.

7

think that members of this Court have not been

8

completely at ease with the emphasis upon the concept

9

and term "sovereignty" in the analysis of the problem in

10
11

That case, as you well know, is an

I

.World-Wide Volkswagen.
That analysis can probably be validly taken as

12

a reverse view of the individual rights which are

13

intended to be preserved by the due process clause, and

14

indeed I have seen that view taken.

15

Here in this case, however, by contrast with

16

World-Wide Volkswagen, we have an attemnted projection

17

of state power internationally.

18

therefore an authentic case for analysis in the

19

traditional terms of sovereignty, as we are dealing not

20

only with an express clause of the Constitution, albeit

21

a terse one, but with the problem of considering

22

standards of international law and comity.

23

We have, I think,

Perhaps the conclusion that we urge here could

24

be reached on the basis of such international standards

25

and without reference to the due process clause.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

We

1

don't urge that.

2

it’s desirable.

3

Ke see no need to, and we don't think

Questions which arise domestically and

4

questions of personal jurisdiction which arise

5

internationally should, if possible, be resolved with

6

similar analyses.

7

inconsistent only in respect of the element of this

8

Court's power to control reception and enforcement

9

within the United States and

These analyses in our view would be

this Court's function of

10

distributing to some extent the judicial business within

11

an interstate federal system.

12

And of course, therefore, in the international

13

case it would be necessary, we think, to take account of

14

the lack of that power and the lack of that function in

15

the international sphere, and in that sphere to give

16

some heed to the views of others abroad in connection

17

with our international powers.

Mr. Staring, straighten cut a

MR. STARING;

QUESTION

5

MR. STARING:

6

QUESTION;

i

I see.
Yes.

Is there a choice of law clause in

the contracts between your client and Cheng Shin?

8

MR. STARING;

9

QUESTION;

10
11

they arise from this

accident.

4

7

Yes,

We have no knowledge of that.

Thank you.

MR. STARING:

The record shows nothing as to

it.
We are not suggesting, by the way, that this

12
13

Court in this case should announce a rule of

14

international law or a standard of international

15

conduct.

16

a proposal of that nature which the Respondent suggests

17

in urging the affirmance below at one point in its

18

brief.

19

That would be uncalled for.

It is, I suppose,

What we do say is that international

20

considerations call for a heightened scrutiny of the

21

necessary contacts , ties, or relations to establish

22

personal jurisdiction, and we do urge that a case of

23

this character is not one in which the scope of the

24

jurisdiction of our state courts over manufacturers

25

abroad should be extended.
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

We would not even urge that there should be

2

such an extension if our client were a domestic

3

manufacturer of components, but that is not the

4

situation here.

5

and we think this is not -- such a case is not a case

6

for an extension such as the Supreme Court of California

7

has given to World-Wide Volkswagen.

8
9

It is a foreign, an alien manufacturer,

QUESTION;

Would you be making the same

argument if the original Plaintiff had not settled?

10

MR. STARING;

Yes.

Yes, I don't see why not.

11

May I add, Justice Blackmunn, that the original

12

Plaintiff did

not sue my client Asahi here.

13

QUESTIONS

14

MR. STARING:

Yes, that's correct.
But had it done so, we would be

15

making the same argument.

16

did not wish to take refuge solely in the narrow view,

in the narrow

I do not waive that issue, but I think the
broader issue has to be seen by the Court.

this case has been on the stream of

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

But

1

we assume for cur purposes here that Asahi delivered

2

products into that stream or some tributary of it.

3

We don't accept, however, the Respondent’s

4

further suggestion , that a component maker in the

5

position of Asahi here is somehow or other especially

6

responsible for that stream, as though it were the

7

original spring.

8
9

That is an unrealistic view, we suggest, both
commercially and legally.

This Court in referring to

10

the significance of delivering products into the stream

11

of commerce in World-Wide Volkswagen added, however, the

12

important qualification that

13

with the expectation that they would be sold to

14

consumers in the forum state.

15

that foreseeability or mere foreseeability of their

reaching the fcrum state was

17

The Court went on to say

not enough.

The Supreme Court of California chose to deal

18

with the case not in terms of foreseeability, the term

19

"foreseeability" which this Court had used, but rather

20

in terms of awareness, and there has been some argument

21

in the briefs about the difference between the two.

22

would not bandy words here about foreseeability and

23

awareness, but would suggest instead that at this point

24

we look at the evidence, the very brief, the very simple

25

evidence in the record, which was found sufficient below

Supreme Court has adopted.

Mr. Staring, do you concede that it

The evidence on it --

QUESTION;

You argue that foreseeability alone

10

is not enough, anyway.

11

MR. STARING;

12

13

No, I do not concede that it was

Yes,

we argue that

foreseeability alone is not enough.
And

let me retract that.

I think that we're

14

prepared to argue this case and present this case to the

15

Court in terms of foreseeability, mere foreseeability.

16

QUESTION;

17

should be the test?

18

MR.

By that

STARING;

what do you mean, that that

No, but that that should not be

19

the test and that that is the very most, the very most

20

which could be shown by the record here.

21

QUESTION;

You may as well give that away,

22

because the California court found foreseeability.

23

don't expect us to reverse that on this record, do you?

24

MR. STARING;

I don't ask this Ccurt to review

the facts as found by the California court.

MR. STARING:

Right.
I don’t know whether they found

They found something that I think was at least

that.

And as I say, I don’t

want to bandy words about
They went pretty

I want to go into that record, though, for a
special reason .

11

QUESTION:

Do you think there has to be a

12

different test for a component manufacturer than the

13

primary manufacturer?

14

MR. STARING:

I do not think that there’s any

15

different principle which applies.

16

principles which this Court has laid down apply to

17

both.

18

I think the

We think, however, that the situation of

19

component manufacturers is likely in most instances tc

20

be very different, and that it is possible therefore to

21

frame a test with respect to component manufacturers

22

which is consistent with the same principles applying to

23

everyone else, and we have tried to do that in our

24

brief.
The record here was very short so far as

1

knowledge or awareness or foreseeability was concerned

2

There is an affidavit which shows some conversations,

3

unspecified.

4

information was given to Asahi that Cheng Shin sold

5

tubes worldwide and that some unspecified number or type

6

were sold in the United States.

7

Some time in those conversations,

That's it.

Now, Asahi*s knowledge of those meager facts

8

is absolutely undated in reference to contract,

9

production, delivery, or even the accident in this case,

10

which occurred in 1978, the first year of six years in

11

which the Plaintiff Cheng Shin collected statistics to

12

use against Asahi in this case.

13

Now, that shows, we think, what kind of murk,

14

what kind of fog,

16

California Suprema Court.

We could have had several foggy affidavits.

20

And if you think about the distinction between

21

the component manufacturer’s situation and the situation

22

of the ultimate manufacturer and exporter, you will see

23

how likely this area is to be foggy all the time.

24

say, I manufacture washing machines, the totality of

4

them, including all of the components, and I sell the

5

washing machine to -- let's say in Japan, to a company

which I know exports them, and I know they export them

to the United

Suppose I am the

STARING;

I wouldn't draw the distinction

10

just on the basis of whether it was an ultimate

11

manufacturer or an exporter.

12

is that, whichever one it is, it seek to serve the

13

California market, as was said in World-Wide Volkswagen,

14

that there be some act, some act by which it positively

15

seeks to serve that market and direct its products into

16

that market.

17

I think the critical thing

And so it will depend upon the facts in every

18

case.

19

nothing more to go on than a bit of conversation, of

20

undocumented conversation, that an exporter sent

21

products to the United States as well as other places,

22

that is not the kind of activity of direction toward the

23

California market which we think this Court intended in

24

World-Wide Volkswagen and which is consistent at least

25

with other decisions of the Court.

But I would say that if a manufacturer had

that sends it?

I have to be the one

It’s not enough that I know I am delivering it

to someone who will send it there?

7

there has to be my doing?

Is that

contend that.

The sending of it

No, Justice Scalia , I do not

I do say, though, that you must at least

10

do some act by which you encourage the sending of it

11

there, by which you seek to serve that market.

12

do something mere than respond to an order which is

13

unspecific as to where the product is going to go.

equipment knowing that once I deliver it it’s going to

If we had a law of accessory applicable to

this, I’d certainly be an accessory to the sending of it

Is that improper material in the

MR. STARING;

Yes,

we think so.

We think this

is really to be disregarded.

upon that.

I'm not sure about great reliance,

about contemporaneous knowledge when we seek to impose

jurisdiction upon someone for --

3

QUESTION:

Well, if you find the registered

4

agent today you could serve him today, couldn't you?

5

mean, for personal jurisdiction isn't it ycur presence

6

at the time you're sued?

7

MR. STARING:

Well, that is not, however, at

8

the heart of the stream of commerce doctrine as we

9

understand it.

We don't deal here with any question cf

10

general jurisdiction over Asahi in California, and I

11

don't think there's any contention that anyone even

12

would dare to contend that the presence of some Asahi

13

valves in California would constitute Asahi's presence

14

there.

15

So it's necessary here for Cheng Shin to

16

prevail, if it does at all, on the stream cf commerce

17

doctrine, and

18

that involves --

QUESTION i

Well, your client at least knew

19

that Cheng Shin's tires were being sold in the United

20

States?

I

MR. STARING:

told that at some time.

And the statistics gathered afterward show

We have no more than that.

Unlikely?

I thought the evidence

12

was there were 500,000 of your valves that were sold by

13

Asahi to Cheng Shin in one year.

MR.

HAVEN:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, members of

the Court:
I'd like to point out first of all, getting

19

right into the factual background of this case, that the

20

record is totally devoid of there being any contract

21

whatsoever between the parties.

22

of anything more than the fact of a sale, the terms of

He had ample opportunity to make that

denial if he chose to do so, and it was never done.

11

Therefore, up until the point of the reply

12

brief in this case it has always been taken by the court

13

as a given, if you will, that Asahi was well aware of

14

the distribution system of Cheng Shin, which included

15

the United States and California.

16

It was also taken by the court as a given that

No, there's a lot more than that,

Nevertheless, in terms of whether

6

Asahi should have anticipated that its products were

7

regularly going to arrive in California, that's a

8

different question.

9

MR.

If Asahi knows that Cheng Shin and

California, and Asahi continues year after year after

year to sell --

systematic method of distribution that they know covers

17

the United States and California, and I think that rises

18

to the level of an expectation.

You’ll see the cross-complaint is

It is not

But in terms of fair play and substantial

2

justice, I think in balancing the interest of the state

3

versus balancing the interest of Asahi weighs favorably

4

in that of the state, because again I come back to the

5

same notion, that Asahi regularly over the course of ten

6

years and over the course of

7

one and a quarter million valves to Cheng Shin with

8

knowledge of its distribution system, made money off of

9

Californians, subjected Californians to the potential of

10

five years sold well over

harm .

11

It's the legal system in California that

12

allows Asahi to do the business that it does there

13

indirectly, and I don’t see why Asahi can’t come to

14

California and defend its case.
