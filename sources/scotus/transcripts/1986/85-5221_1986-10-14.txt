from vcu

MR.

APRTLE;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

The case of Griffith versus Kentucky presents

12

a single issue, and that is in cases rending cn direct

13

appeal should the holding in Batson versus Kentucky be

14

given retroactive effect.

15

As a result of this Court's holding in Allen

16

versus Hardy, there is no question before this Court

17

that Batson will

So it is in this context that Griffith versus

22

23

States, present you the opportunity to take one step

24

further than ycu did in Shea

25

embrace the rule that you had prior tc Linkletter versus

the following case. Brown versus United

Walker, and that is that you would return to decision

2

that holds that all constitutional rules that are

3

announced will be applied retroactively to all cases cn

4

direct appea1 .

5

You have had 21 years of experimentation since

6

Linkletter versus Walker and, as many of you have

7

expressed in

8

Court have indicated, the difficulty with retroactivity

9

that has been generated by the attempt to draw bright

various opinions and past members of the

10

lines, particularly in the area of the question of

11

direct review.

12

We

viculd submit that the easiest solution and

13

perhaps one that

14

utilized in other contexts would be to go back to the

15

pre-Linkletter versus Walker situation and,

16

not constitutionally mandated, embrace the concept that

17

those cases that have raised the same issue that

18

final would be entitled tc the benefit of the new

19

constitutional principle announced.

20

would accommodate factors you have

even though

are not

Well, Mr. .Aprile, does your

21

submission embrace what is referred tc as Justice

22

Harlan's view on the subject, where T believe he said

23

that all cases on direct review not final should get the

24

benefit of the new rule, but none on habeas corpus

25

should get the benefit?

MR. APBILEj

Well, Your Honor, it is obvious

2

from the context of the situation we are cut in by the

3

ruling in Allen versus Hardy that takes away the

4

question of collateral relief in the Batson case, I am

5

obviously not in a position to strongly advocate, as

6

someone who has a client who's involved in that

7

situation, for the adoption

8

Justice Harlan's approach.

9

cf the second part of

But I do feel that you have ideally set the

10

situation and the table here to embrace it in the

11

context of Batson.

12

if we lock at what you decided in Shea versus louisiana,

13

in the footnote you pointed

14

versus the United States and Griffith versus Kentucky

15

were not even decided cn the basis of Shea versus

16

Louisiana .

it's very interesting that

a good strong rationale for applying the different

2

doctrines of retroactivity in cases on direct appeal.

3

If I could perhaps subvert for a second,

4

the two

concepts that you've often used in the context of

5

retroactivity, reliance and effect on the administration

6

of criminal justice.

7

I submit to you that as you decide a case and

8

announce a new constitutional rule and allow the

9

question of retroactivity on direct appeal tc swing and

10

sway in the breeze, the lower courts then go on and make

11

MR.

T may be wrong

in this, but

6

it was my basic understanding that in that regard, in

7

that mode, that they oftentimes were granted complete

QUESTIO";

If you're getting into kind of the

5

weighing of factors and so forth, certainly the reliance

6

element militates against you here, it seems to me.

7

Obviously, there were people who did rely on the

8

validity of the Swain decision at the time cases were

9

tried, even though they hadn't become final.

10

MR. APRILE:

Well, I think that we can .lock at

11

that in two wavs.

12

you have before you today is different from many of the

13

cases that you have decided retroactivity on.

14

one, the relief that you gave in Batson was net to

15

reverse and grant a new trial, but it was remanded for a

16

simple inquiry, an inquiry that involves, first of all,

17

determining whether or not, usually from official court

18

records, blacks were struck

19

number; secondly, if that were true, the defendant

20

showing he was a member of a cognizable racial group;

21

and then putting the prosecutor to the test of stating

22

trial-related reasons why he made those strikes as

23

opposed to racially biased reasons; and the court then

24

deciding whether or not the prosecutor had overcome a

25

prima facie shewing of discrimination made, as you

I think that the particular case that

What reliance was there in the past?

other minorities, on the basis of race with no

Well, I think that confusion is

17

acceptable for the purpose that other people, Justices

on this Court, have spoken tc that issue in various

have pointed

without question that Batson was a clear break case and

15

for whatever reason, this Court does not feel that
