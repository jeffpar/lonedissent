QUESTIONS

Sure» you can get further review.

The state can refuse on remand to turn over these

records as the Supreme Court has said it must do»

12

whereupon either the conviction will be set aside and we

This Court last term in Delaware versus Van

16

ArsdalI indicated that defendant shows a violation of

17

his right of confrontation by showing that he has been

18

prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross

19

examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias

20

on the part of a witness and thereby to expose to the

21

jury facts from which the jury could appropriately draw

22

inferences relating to the reliability of the witness#

23

We are asking the Court that we have been

In Van Arsdall questions

Your

Well* what I am complaining

11

about is the fact that as in Davis the jury may very

12

well have thought that defense counsel's cross

13

examination of the victim concerning this investigation

14

in September of 1978 may have been a baseless ground of

15

attack.

16

Here we have a situation where the principal

17

issue at trial was the credibility of two parties* the

18

complainant and the defendant* and it may very well have

19

tipped the scale for the Jury to have heard a different

20

version of the facts that the complainant gave on prior

21

occas Ions.

And in that respect I am saying that there
