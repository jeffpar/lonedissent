COHEN;

Well, I think the answer —
You can have a freelance private

stinger if he wants to go out and set it up.
MR. COHEN:

Well, except that it was

6

apparently Mr. Bainton's intention to supervise that.

7

And ethical prohibitions would prohibit him from taping

meetings without the consent of all the parties.

7

QUESTION;

Why does his status as a special

prosecutor exempt him from California State lav?
MR. COHEN;

Because — I don’t -- I don’t know

8

that it -- I think that the answer is that the

9

California authorities treated Mr. Bainton as an

10

The State law of California prohibiting taping
things would not apply to a Federal prosecutor.

KR.

13

COHEN;

Well, that happened in this case

too.
QUESTION;

And is that -- you think all of

those activities are ethically improper for a lawyer to

in?

MR.

COHEN;

For a lawyer who’s representing

22

the interests of the United States and at the same time

represents a private party; I think that’s improper.

Yes.
— who had the conflicting

Because you can’t tell how those

The decisions of this Court and other courts

3

which permit stings and other investigative techniques,

which have at times been said to create problems or

5

concerns about defendants’ rights, and the integrity of

I think, as a matter of original

11

inquiry, that perhaps the standards would be higher for

12

a public prosecutor than for a private attorney?

13

MR. COHEN:

Well, you might.

Except that we

14

are not concerned, I think, rightfully, that as a

15

general matter public prosecutors will misuse their

16

office in defense of some other client; because there is

17

no other client.

In this case, when

you have the attorney

Prior to that —

-- he had just one client?

You say

the sting began before he became a special prosecutor?
MR.

11

COHEN;

Yes, the sting did begin.

The

12

evidence that was introduced

13

was created under the special prosecutor’s mandate.
And that all

14

at trial, though, didn’t --

(La ughter. )

23

MR. COHEN;

That has caused some confusion,

24

Your Honor.

As you obviously know, the government has

submitted amicus briefs supporting the notion that the
15

I don't think that

the mere labelling someone

as a special prosecutor, as a United States Attorney,

ought to dispose of this case.

It's just — and this case really illustrates,
I think, why not.

COHEN;

MR. COHEN;
that's a fact.

(Inaudible.)
I understand that, Your Honor.
Well, I have problems with that.
Well, I meant that I understand

I have some problems with it as well.

Speaking of the U.S. Attorney, Judge 3rieant,

13

who I think was initially sensitive to the possibility

14

that some problems would exist, and also to the alleged

15

magnitude of the case, as it

16

directed Mr. Brieant -- Mr. Brieant; Mr. 3ainton, on

17

April 6th to -- which is about five days into the —

18

into the taped portion of the sting, and about five days

19

after he was appointed special prosecutor — to, quote,

20

fully debrief the United States Attorney.

21

was explained to him,

Well, he -- he -- I think, Your Honor, and I

22

have to go back to the transcript to be sure, he

23

directed Mr. Bainton to fully debrief the U.S. Attorney,

24

and said that he wasn't requiring the United States

25

Attorney to come in; that it was simply a suggestion.

1

In any event, I don't think it’s important to

2

quarrel over whether he was directed or whether it was

3

suggested.

4

Bainton sent a short, two paragraph letter, which is in

5

the appendix, to Mr. Pedowitz, who was at that point,

6

was chief of the criminal division.

7

never receiving a reply, contacted him sometime later,

and the reply was apparently

The U.S. Attorney was never fully offered this

case.

The matter was never referred to the United

11

States Attorney by the District Court.
In short, the procedure suggested by the

12
13

government, that is, the Solicitor Seneral’s Office, in

14

their brief, were never complied with in this case.
The tapes and the conversations that occurred

15

during the investigation covered a wide variety of

topics.

21

22

assets of Sol Klayminc.

in Haiti.

25

It also discussed, in fact --

Also discussed in the tapes, or stated on the

1

tapes, were suggestions by Weinberg in response to

2

inquiries from one or more of the defendants in this

3

case that in fact the proposed plan to manufacture bags

4

in Haiti and distribute them elsewhere was not illegal.
And

5

I just would wish to emphasize that

those

6

kinds of lulling statements occur, not in the context of

7

a heroin conspiracy or a cocaine conspiracy, something

8

that it is beyond any doubt at all is wrong, and you

9

don*t need to be told that it is not, this occurs in the

10

context of an injunction which had very specific, proper

11

business purposes, to protect Vuitton’s trademark

12

rights.

13
14

In that context, suggesting to someone,

as

:Weinberg did time and time again, that the plan that

15

they were discussing, and the scheme, if you will, that

16

was afoot, would not violate the injunction is

17

particularly offensive.

18

The interests that

the special prosecutor

19

labored under here were not only the duty to Vuitton.

20

In fact, there was another client, Fendi, who was also

21

apparently a very expensive trademark, because Mr. —

22

Mr. Bainton also represented Fendi.

23

discharging Mr. Rochman, who was originally a defendant

24

in this case,

25

attorney for Fendi, Mr. Bainton discharged Mr. Rochman

And in fact, in

from his civil obligations for Vuitton as

And

3

that *s contained in a letter that is also

in the appendix.

4

There’s the $100,000 judgment against Sol

5

Klayminc and the family companies, including Barry

6

Klayminc.

7

that with about $81,000 left to pay.
There’s a $750,000 judgment against petitioner

8
9

That was — as I say, payment was stopped on

Young.

Petitioner Young was involved in a case in

10

California in

1981 , in which

he agreed to an injunction

11

prohibiting him from manufacturing, selling, offering to

12

sell, counterfeit Louis Vuitton bags.
As a part of that agreement, there was a

13
14

liquidated damages provision of $750,000 that would only

15

become due and owing if Young violated that injunction.
In addition to that, there’s a personal

16
17

interest the special prosecutor had, because he was a

18

defendant in a defamation action which was begun before

19

the sting.

20

QUESTIONi

Mr. Cohen, let me read you, if I

21

may, a sentence from the Second Circuit opinion, and ask

22

you if that describes -- Judge Lombard’s opinion says;

23

The fact that Sol Klayminc had brought suit against

24

Bainton and the New York Courts alleging harrassment and

25

other acts is entitled to no

weight as the suit was
1 9

clearly frivolous.

It was never pressed, and was

2

finally dismissed by consent.

3

Is that the suit you’re referring to?

4

MR. COHEN:

That is the suit. Your Honor.

And

5

the fact that it was frivolous -- and I’m not qualified

6

to say whether it was frivolous, and with all due

7

respect to Judge Lombard, I don’t think that he is

8

either — there is -- there is nothing -- there is

9

nothing that prevents or has been explored, Mr. Sainton

lO-

from being concerned about that.
The suit was for two a quarter million

ll
12

dollars.

13

matter was discontinued after a claim of prosecutorial

14

immunity.

15

Somebody hired a lawyer to represent him.

Now, whether or not it was frivolous is really

16

not the point.

an appearance of a conflict of interest.

Hell, if you appoint a private

10

attorney who's not representing one of the plaintiffs,

11

how does the attorney get paid?
MR. COHEN:

12

Well, Your Honor, the

13

administrative office of the United States court has a

14

fund which has been used to pay disinterested private

15

attorneys before on a few occasions.

16

QUESTION;

17

MR.

COHEN:

As a matter of course?
Apparently, yes, Your Honor.

18

There's the lodging that Mr.

Bainton put in, a letter

19

that he sent to the administrative office of the courts;

20

and there are conversations that the Solicitor General

21

office — Solicitor General's office has had with the

22

general counsel of that unit.
And apparently, there is a fund from which to

23
24

pay.

Now, the fund is not overwhelming in amount.

25

it hasn't been tapped that frequently.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON, ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS
MR. BRYSONi

is calling itself the government in this case.
For clarification, of course, Mr. Eainton is

Now, the government's position in this case is

21

a little different from the position taken by either of

22

the other two parties.

23
24
25

Basically, it can be summarized in four
propositions.
First, that ordinarily it is the United States
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Attorney who should prosecute serious contempts.
Second, that in some special cases — and we

2

3

think that for practical reasons, this is going to be a

4

very limited class -- but in some special cases, it is

5

appropriate for the court to appoint a private attorney

6

to prosecute a criminal contempt.

7

Third, that that should be done, if at all,

8

only after the United States Attorney has been given the

9

case for consideration and has declined the prosecution.
And

10

fourth -- excuse me — that the attorney

11

for the opposing party in a civil case should never be

12

the party who is appointed to prosecute a criminal -- a

13

serious criminal contempt.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, could I ask about

15

number two?

16

appoint a special prosecutor?

17

MR.

Where does the court get authority to

BRYSON:

Well,

I think there are two

18

answers to that. Your Honor.

19

contain a reference — it’s a very cryptic reference, to

20

be sure.

21

either the U.S. Attorney or an attorney appointed by the

22

court can handle criminal contempts.

23
24
25

-- show a constitutional disposition against -- this

kind of appointment.
Because if Congress had, for example, more

4

specifically designated the special prosecutor as being

5

someone who could be appointed, then we would be beyond

6

appointments clause problem.
So -- excuse me — it's not a constitutional

7

8

problem.

At most, it’s a question of the degree of the

9

specificity of the authorizing statute.
But beyond that, I think it's important to

10
11

point out some of the practical problems that this kind

12

of conflict of interest creates.

13

We point out in the brief that the statutes

14

and regulations which Congress has imposed on regular

15

Department of Justice employees establish a Federal

16

policy against just this kind of conflict of interest.
We think it's a general policy.

17

We think it's

18

a policy that this Court ought to apply to this kind of

19

conflicting representation where the United States and a

20

private party are both being represented by the same

21

attorney.

22

Section 203(a) was pointed out.

Section 528

23

of Title XXVIII states that conflicts of interest will

24

not be permitted in cases in

25

an Assistant United States Attorney is carrying forward

which the United States --

2

And

that statute directs the government to

3

pass particular regulations dealing with conflicts of

4

interest.

5

apply directly in this case, Section 735-4 , stating that

6

if an organization has a substantial interest in the

7

outcome of a case, and that organization is one with

8

which the attorney is allied in the personal -- in some

9

personal sense, that the attorney is disqualified from

10

And among those regulations is one that would

proceeding with the prosecution or investigation.

11

Now, the practical problems here are very real.

12

13

situation, Mr. Bryson?
MR. BRYSON:

14
15

(Inaudible) addressed to this

Well,

I think it would be

addressed, Your Honor, to a situation where,

for example

16

QUESTION;

17
18

He's in

the ABA, or the ABA has an

interest in the outcome; that's what that sounds like.
MR.

19

BRYSONi

Well,

I think it would clearly

20

apply# Your Honor, to a case where, for example, if I

21

continued to represent a private party, and that private

22

party had an interest in the outcome of a lawsuit in

23

which I was the prosecutor, that would clearly be

24

covered.

25

Now, there might be closer questions dealing
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

with organizations such as the ABA, but clearly, in a

2

case like this, that regulation would cover a

3

prosecutor, and the prosecutor would be disqualified

4

from proceeding with the investigation or prosecution.
Now, as a practical matter, there are special

5

6

problems in this kind of case, one of which is, for

7

example, mention was made of Hr. Young.
Mr. Young is one of the defendants who

8
9

apparently had some assets, and he had a $750,000

10

judgment which was subject to execution if he were

11

convicted.
Well, that is an enormous incentive to choose

12
13

Mr. Young as one of the defendants to prosecute, as

14

opposed to, for example, using Mr. Young as a witness

15

against some of the other defendants.
Similarly, in current times, when there is a

16
17

specific Federal statute prohibiting trademark

18

infringement,

19

comes into play, and that statute provides that a fine

20

can either go to the -- the victim or to the United

21

States.

the Section 402 of the contempt statutes

22

Obviously, the attorney for the victim is

23

going to have an interest to see to it, to urge the

24

court, to have the fine paid

25

the United States.

to the victim as opposed to

(202) 628-9300

3

QUESTION:

Well, Nr. Bryson, what you say I

don't doubt makes a good deal of sense in the abstract.
But if we adopt your position that people with

4

a conflict of interest can't be appointed special

5

prosecutors, that it first have to go to the United

6

States Attorney, the court is left without any realistic

7

way of enforcing an injunction or prosecuting a

8

contemner, unless the U.S. Attorney approves.

9
10
11

HR.

BRYSON:

Well,

Your Honor, I have a couple

of answers.
First of all, I think almost invariably the

12

United States Attorney will prosecute such cases.

13

That's the policy of the Justice Department as set cut

14

in the section of the U.S. Attorney's manual that we

15

have —we have quoted in the brief.

16
17
18

Second, there is a

fallback in the

availability of administrative office funds.
And third — and I think this is not an

19

insignificant factor -- there are law firms that are

20

willing to offer services on

22

cases in which, for example,

2

So --

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, what's the oldest case

4

you have that gives the courts authorities to cite for

5

criminal contempt without a statute and on -- with their

6

own appointment of a prosecutor for violation of one of

7

their orders, as opposed to for, you know, contempt that

8

occurs in front of them, an insult to their dignity, an

9

obstruction of their processes, but just disobeying one

10

of their judgments?
What 's the oldest case you have that allows

11
12

the court some inherent power to punish for this?
MB. BRYSON i

13

Well,

the McCann case would fall

14

into that category.

15

is, most of these cases have involved very small

16

contempts.

17

participating as a special prosecutor is on a very

18

limited basis .

19

Most of the cases — the problem

And the degree to which somebody is

In McCann, it may not have gone much beyond

20

simply the notice stage, which was authorized .— was

21

subsequently authorized by Rule 42(b).

22

McCann and some of the other cases of about that age

23

that are cited in Mr. Bainton*s brief would fall

24

generally into that category.

25

But certainly

And that's from the middle thirties.

Mr. Chief Justice, a nd may it

The Chief Justice's last question indicates to

10

me that the Court is focussing on the real i ssue

11

presented by this case, and that is, how are the Federal

12

courts going to enforce their orders?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

was not only allowable, but the preferred practice, in

2

cases such as this one, for the Court to specially

3

appoint the attorney for the civil litigant aggrieved by

4

the disobedience of the Federal court order.
Now Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Criminal

5

6

Procedure also comes into play to the extent that it

7

says, in substance, any -- that — excuse me, as it says

8

in substance that all prior practice is not excluded.
To the extent that the Court does not find

9
10

adequate authority to do what it did within Rule 42(b),

11

which is what the District Court found in both opinions

12

and the Second Circuit, we suggest that the power

13

question can be resolved ultimately by reference to the

14

All Writs Act.
So I don't think that there is a serious

15
16

question as to whether the court has the power to do

17

what it did in this and other cases.
Of course, it can't exercise this power in a

18
19

way that deprives a defendant of his due process

And that is the question that is really

What has — what this Court I think has to do

is balance the interests of an independent judiciary

against the risk that this process might somehow

1

In that balancing process, I think the most

2

important factor for the Court to take into account is

3

the very special role that the District Court judge

4

plays in these cases.
As Mr. Bryson pointed out, the decision to

5

6

prosecute, to continue the prosecution, is not reposed

7

with the District — excuse me, with the civil

8

litigant’s lawyer.
The decision in this case, and Musidor and

9
10

McCann and the others, confers no right on a civil

11

litigant.

12

no civil litigant can go to a District Court judge and

massive court decree, like the old AT&T decree, which

16

was essentially the structure for our telecommunications

I think you'd suggest that’s a gcod idea.

9

MR.

10
11

SAINTON;

The -- the -- there are two

parts to the answer to that question, sir.
The first part is,

the only person who could

12

make such an appointment is the Attorney General of the

13

United States.

14

Secondly, the conflict of interest statute

15

cited by the Solicitor General would make such an

16

appointment as a proposition of statutory law by the

17

Attorney General unlawful and therefore improper.

18

Now, the next question, I suppose, is, suppose

19

that statute didn’t exist, that statute was not a bar to

4

And I think, that practice should be followed

5

by this Court, if it*s so inclined, and it would be a

mistake to exercise its supervisory powers in the

context of this case.

8

I believe two other points and I’m done.

9

I believe Justice Blackmun asked Nr. Cohen

10

about the State law of California with respect to the

11

taping.

12

discusses a line of Ninth Circuit cases which say that

13

it would be unconstitutional for the State of California

14

to proscribe the manner in which Federal law enforcement

15

officers can conduct an investigation.

16

In the District Court’s opinion at 592-743, it

And therefore, it would be improper for

17

California to tell the FBI or any other Federal law

18

enforcement officer that it cannot engage in one-way

19

electronic eavesdropping.

20

In its opinion the

Ninth Circuit said that

21

that construction of the statute was ridiculous, and

22

therefore rejected it.

23

And finally, I’d like to emphasize that

24

Justice Scalia’s point about the investigation, the

25

remarks about

the largest red herring in this case.
Justice Scalia, I believe you're absolutely

right when you say that this is what happens in

investigations of trademark counterfeiting everyday of

6

the week.
The only thing that Judge Lasker 's order

changed from what would occur on a garden variety case

is, we have videotapes and audio tapes of what was said.

21

First of all, with all due respect, Justice

22

Rehnquist, the system in this country at the time of the

100, 150 years,

the system in England has been a system of public

In England, the police, not the victim, hire
