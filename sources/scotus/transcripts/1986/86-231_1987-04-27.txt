invitation to employers to lodge vague or nominal

challenges or general challenges just to put the plan

testimony* documentary evidence* and the like that would

12

sense to have the claim serve essentially as a target at

MR•

4

QUESTION;

5

ford;

Yes, it is.
Which one, and why is it phrased

that way, do you think?
MR. F0R0:

6

Justice O'Connor, let me state at

7

the outset my agreement that the language is at least

8

curious.

9

inconsistent, and not merely for the reason that you

It is ambiguous in our view and internally

10

refer to, but also because the language, and this is at

11

Page 65A of our jurisdictional statement, melds a trial

12

type standard, preponderance of the evidence, which is

13

generally understood to mean greater weight of the

14

evidence or more probable than not, with words which

15

appear in Rule 52, an appellate standard, clearly

16

erroneous, which is generally understood again to this

17

Court's decisions in Anderson against the City of

18

Bessemer and so on, to mean that the Appellate Court has

19

a firm and definite conviction that error has been

20

committed.

21

Now, we consider, first of all, the melding of

22

the trial type standard with the appellate standard to

23

be an inconsistency in itself, and second, the

24

preponderance standard, to show that something Is more

25

likely than not, is a somewhat lower standard in
