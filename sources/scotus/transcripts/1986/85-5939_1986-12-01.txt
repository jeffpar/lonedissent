MR. DSI^Si

Yes.

The state is seeking to raise

3

that point nov for the first time before this Court, and

4

in response we have two essential responses.

5

One is that in fact, looking at the evidence

that's available, they have not met their heavy burden

of showing that the presumptive -- the unreliable

co-defendant's confession is reliable.

place, this Court should not even consider that question

But in the first

10

because it was not presented in the petitions for

11

certiorari or the response to the petition.

12

It was not pressed or passed in the state

13

courts, and therefore petitioner was not aiven an

14

opportunity to make or contribute to the record on the

15

question of

16

reliable as evidence connecting petitioner to the crime.

17

whether this co-defendant’s confession is

The only question in the state trial courts

18

and in the state appellate courts was whether this

19

confession impacted upon the defendant, Eulogio Cruz.

20

QUESTION:

Don’t you think, counsel, that

21

there is a difference between arguing that it is

22

admissible under a hearsay exception, and making that

is trying to do here, and on the other hand arguing that

that/ renders the co-defend ant*s confession admissible?
MR. DEftN:

I understand the question, but I

think the crucial thing here is that they are pointing

record for reasons unrelated to this question.

8

We never got a chance, because it wasn't an

9

issue below, to help make the record to indicate that

10

this confession was unreliable evidence as to our

11

defendant.

12

QUESTION’:

What sort of a record would if

13

take, beyond

14

normal hearsay exception for admissions against

15

interest, against penal interest, would apply here?

16

What additional evidence would be necessary, or helpful?

21

We don't know what the relationship is

The state is assuming that there is some sort

22

of presumption of brotherly love between two brothers,

23

which I don't think in history or in practicality exist.

24
25

QUESTION:

Would you normally be able to

introduce that evidence if somebody tried to get it in

(202) 628-9300

2

under the hearsay exception?
MR. DEAN;

Oh, absolutely.

If a state is

3

trying to introduce the co-defendant's confession as

4

evidence of petitioner's guilt, surely we would have the

5

opportunity to introduce, before the judge or the jury,

6

evidence to indicate that he had a motive to falsify

7

against the petitioner.

8
9

QUESTION;

Well, you could certainly introduce

it to the jury on the basis that they shouldn't believe

10

it, therefore.

11

it for the purpose of saying that therefore the normal

12

exception to the hearsay rule should not be applied?

13

But do you have the right to introduce

MR. DEAN;

Oh, absolutely.

We have the right

14

to help — to litigate an issue of the admissibility of

15

evidence under a certain doctrine, but take the

16

declaration --

17

QUESTION:

Do you

know any cases that decline

18

to apply the admission against penal interest exception

19

to the hearsay rule on the basis that, even though it

20

was an admission against penal interest, there are other

21

indicia of --

22

MR. DEAN;

Yes, all the New York State cases.

23

First of all, as to declaration against penal interest,

24

this Court said in Lee versus Illinois that that was too

by introduction of evidence that they would have the

opportunity to show that the evidence was in fact

unreliable and that the standard indicia cf

admissibility as a declaration against penal interest

are illusory.
That's New York State law.

10

Had respondent

11

sought to introduce the co-defendant's confession as

12

substantive evidence against petitioner in this case, in

13

New York State courts, it would not have been admissible

under New York State law.
That argument is fully laid out in cur reply

brief.
QUESTIONS

Haven't we recognized that there is

18

a presumption against the reliability of co-defendants

19

post-arrest confessions, and whether they contain

20

admissions against penal interest or not?

21

MR. DEAN;

Right, as in Lee versus Illinois.

22

QUESTIONS

Yes, as contrasted with pre-arrest,

23
24
25

pre-custody statements against interest?
MR. DEANs

Actually, I don't read that

difference in Lee versus Illinois.

QUESTIONS

You mean, between the --

2

MR. DEAN;

Between the pre-arrest and the

3

post-arrest statement.
QUESTION:

4

If it's there, I don't see it.

Well, it may not be.

If there

5

isn't any difference, the business about the

6

admissibility of statements against penal interest is an

7

empty thing.
MR. DEAN:

8

9

Well, perhaps so.

But in any

event, the :o-dafendant's videotaped confession was made

10

after he was placed under arrest.

So, we're dealing

11

with a post-arrest videotaped confession.

12

The videotaped confession of the cc-defendant

13

in this case was a 22-minute videotape taken by a Bronx

14

County Assistant District Attorney.

15

confession that the state introduced against petitioner

16

was introduced through the testimony of a single

17

witness, Norberto -ruz whose testimony, we submit, was

18

generally unworthy of belief.

The alleged

And furthermore, he specifically had a motive

19
20

to frame petitioner for this crime -- excuse me, Your

21

Honor?

22

QUESTION:

In the confession that is sought to

23

be admitted against your client by the co-defend ant, he

24

didn't seek to frame your client.

25

pulled the trigger.

He admitted that he

MR. DEAN;

No, I'm talking about the --

QUESTION;

-- the other confession?

3

MR. DEAN;

Confession that was introduced

4

through Norberto Cruz.

5

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

6

MR. DEAN;

But in reference to that, the

7

co-defendant in his videotaped confession said that, "My

8

brother, he announced the robbery.

9

from the attendant.

He said, we will kill you if you

10

don't give it over.

He started fighting with him."

He demanded money

And only when he was unarmed did Benjamin then

14

versed in. the law of felony murder, which I think it is

15

safe to assume, ani

16

that a killing in self defense is not a defense to

17

felony murder, I think that one can safely assume that

18

the "against penal interest" quality of that confession

19

is certainly ambiguous.

20

So, assuming that Benjamin Cruz is not well

that therefore he would not know

QUESTION;

Maybe, but one would think that if

21

there was anything he was going to lie about, it would

22

be about the question of who pulled the trigger.

23

MR. DEAN;

Well, that might not be true if to

24

pull the trigger —

25

QUESTION:

And he said, "I pulled the

(202) 628-9300

trigger,” and not your client?
MR. DEAN;

2

Right, but he pulled the trigger in

3

self defense of his brother, and of course self defense

4

for a defendant with no prior involvement with the law

5

and the mentality of a five-year old child could very

6

well be a defense to murder.

7

guilty of is the mere robbery.

And then, all he would be

In fact, he was fully --

9

QUESTION*

If you're going to lie about it, it

10

seems to. me you'd tell a more intelligent lie to say,

11

"My brother pulled the trigger."
MR. DEAN:

12

Well, in fact there was testimony

13

in this case that Benjamin is not an intelligent

14

individual.

15

order to convince the police that he was not guilty of

16

the Jerry Cruz homicide.

Furthermore, he initially confessed in

Jerry Cruz is the brother of Norberto Cruz who

17
18

is the principal witness against my client in this

19

case.

20

investigating that particular homicide, and they

21

suspected Eulcgio Cruz and Benjamin Cruz of committing

22

the crime.

23

Jerry's brother was killed and the police were

So, they left word in the neighborhood that

24

they wanted to speak to these fellows about the crime.

25

Benjamin Cruz came to what turned out to be the wrong

I

So, what he was trying to do, as the
government points out in their amicus brief, is he was

10

trying to get himself off the hook for another homicide

11

when he made that, what, the District Attorney now calls

12

a spontaneous statement.

13

We don’t actually know what all the facts and

14

circumstances were, surrounding the making of that first

15

statement or what happened between the making of that

16

first statement, and the ultimate confession on

17

videotape, because as far as petitioner was concerned

18

that wasn't an issue in the case at that time, how much

19

of petitioner's involvement was suggested to the

20

co-defendant before he named petitioner in the

21

statement, what things might have been said to Benjamin

22

in order to suggest in his mind that it would be

23

worthwhile for him to frame petitioner.

24
25

None of these things were the subject of
inguiry in the trial court,

simply because they weren't
12

in issue in the trial court because counsel knew that
this statement was only going to be admitted aaainst the
co-defendant.

And the argument that he was going to be

making on appeal to the jury was, please, please obey
the judge’s instructions to ignore that evidence as to
my client.
QUESTION

Is it clear that there would have

been a procedural bar to this issue being raised in the
Slew York Court of Appeals?
MR. DEAN:

Yes, absolutely.

Under New York

procedural -QUESTION:

So, it couldn't have been raised

and decided in the highest court of the state?
MR. DEAN:

That’s right.

Absent it being

litigated in state court, since we had no opportunity to
put in evidence to counter that fact, and since it
cannot be said that there is nothing we could have done
to counter that fact, under the People versus Nieves
case which is cited in our reply brief, respondent would
have been barred as a state procedural matter from
raising that issue for the first time, either in the
Appellate Division or in the New York Court of Appeals.
In the trial court and in the appellate
courts, they both recognized the radical difference in
the level of reliability that the confessions in this

(202) 628-9300

case were actually uttered.

2

once you find factual interlocking -- interlocking is

3

the factual content -- that is the end of the analysis.
There is no more analysis that needs to be

But the court said that,

done.

6

QUESTION:

3y the court?

7

MR. DEAN;

By the court, but once —

8

QUESTION:

But that's a jury question, then.

9

MR. DEAN;

Of course.

A jury question, the

10

defendant can always argue that he never made the

11

confession, as he did in this case.

12

QUESTION:

Or that it is unbelievable?

13

MR. DEAN:

That is exactly what he argued.

14
15

That was his entire defense in this case.
However, we submit that the differino levels

16

of reliability, that the confessions were actually

17

uttered, makes Bruton fully applicable to this case

18

because the essential question in Bruton is, does the

19

state's case against the defendant, the petitioner in

20

this case, become much more persuasive against the

21

defendant when viewed in the light of

22

confession.

23

QUESTION;

Veil, Mr. Dean, you seem to be

24

arguing that

the more reliable the co-defendant's

25

confession is, the less the Court should be inclined to

allow it into evidence, and

2

the reverse would be true, that greater reliability

3

would lead one to think it should be admitted.
MB. DEANs

4

I would have thought that

The co-defendant's confession, we

5

concede, is reliable evidence of a certain sort.

definitely reliable as evidence against its declarant,

7

Benjamin Cruz.

Vhat we are arguing is that it’s not

But in another case, a case where the cruestion

is litigated in the state courts below and were the

11

co-defendant's confession is found to be reliable under

12

the Lee analysis, the confession is going to come in and

13

Bruton has nothing to do with that case,

14

15

doctrine.

just as if the

Our argument is that it's not admissible in

16
17

this case because, first, it's not reliable and

18

secondly, because of the procedural bar.

19

might have been different had it been litigated in state

20

court.

21

This case

We submit that the jury in this case would

22

naturally look to the co-defendant’s confession in order

23

to resolve its doubts about whether petitioner's

24

confession was ever uttered.

25

From a trial lawyer's standpoint, if I'm a

court, the only evidence against my client other than a

3

lot of forensic evidence which indicates that a crime

4

took place but none of it directly linking my client to

5

the crime, the only evidence is the testimony of

6

Korberto Cruz who didn't tell the police about this

7

alleged confession for six months and only told the

8

police after his brother had been shot and petitioner,

9

as the witness said, took him to the place where they

had killed his brother.

But, of course, later he admitted

that at the

22

first trial he had testified that he hadn't worked for

23

the past two years; he had been receiving welfare.

24

of course, the jury would naturally wonder, what is this

25

able-bodied man doing receiving welfare, and of course

But, all these factual matters were for the

this evidence was in itself unreliable.

MR. C3DDIN3TON;

I understand the rule to be

QUESTION;

You do?

MR. CODDINGTON;

Yes, I do.

Your Honor, in sum, Justice White
notwithstanding, I believe that the Court can reach this
case.

I believe it is substantively admissible under

Levy-Illinois.
For that reason, I think that any Parker v.
Randolph question has been clearly answered and I submit
that there was no error below.

But in the event that

this Court should find that there were error, I think
harmless error is the appropriate answer.
And were this Court to make the finding that
these cases, these confessions cannot interlock under
any set of facts, then I think this Court should remand
the case to the New York Court of Appeals to consider
these issues.

However, I think that relief would be

inappropriate here because I think, one, that it is
substantively admissible; two, that it's admissible with
limiting instructions under

Parker v. Randolph, and

accordingly I would ask this Court to affirm the

Mr. Chief Justice, and mar it

please the Court:
With the Court's permission I would like to

9

10

first begin by addressing the Parker versus Randolph

11

point and then more back to the Lee versus Illinois

12

point as a secondary point.
On the Parker versus Randolph issue, let me

13
14

say at the outset that the position of the United States

15

is that the plurality decision in Parker was correctly

16

decided and correctly reasoned.

17

Court to accept that rationale.

We would ask the full

This is not simply an issue of semantics or

18
19

focus.

It has enormous practical significance from the

20

standpoint of a trial judge, and what the trial judge

21

should be doing, because if the Court adopts a harmless

22

error approach, then the result is that even in an

23

interlocking confession case it's error and the trial

24

court is required either to sever the cases or to

25

exclude the confession.

rationale, on the contrary,

interlocking, and if there is, proceed to a joint

trial.

dramatizes the significance of the distinction.

And the Parker versus Randolph case itself

7

the Court would be able to

And how do you define

"interlocking"?
HR. KLONDFFs

9

We defined it, Justice Blackmun,

10

as the two confessions being substantially the same and

11

consistent on all the major elements of the offense.

12

It's the approach that's been taken by the Second

13

Circuit, and

we cite a number of cases in our brief.

The Parker case is a dramatization of this.

14
15

Justice Blackmun observed in his concurring opinion that

16

there was no substantial prejudice to any of the

17

defendants as a result of the admission at the joint

18

trial.

19

together in Parker versus Randolph.

20

And there were five defendants that were tried

Now, if there was no substantial prejudice to

21

any of the defendants, then the United States does not

22

understand a rule that would nonetheless require

23

severance, and in Parker ve submit that it may have

24

required five separate trials even though we agree that

25

none of the defendants was prejudiced.

1

So, ve think that the better approach to a

2

harmless error is a question of interlocking

3

confessions, and the definition we suggest to the Court

4

deals with many of the problems that were addressed by

5

Justice Blackmun and by the defendant Parker, because we

concede that there does have to be full interlocking.

WR. KLONOFFs

15

Because, for example, if one

There's been constant reference to a 22-minute

In

Let me, if I could, move to the Lee versus

6

Illinois point in the time remaining.

In terms of the

7

distinction between this case and Lee versus Illinois,

8

there are really three points that should be emphasized

9

because the Court in that case found that the

10

co-defendant *s confession was not sufficiently reliable

11

to come in as substantive evidence.

12

And by the way, the substantive evidence

13

argument, let me indicate, is not that it was actually

14

introduced as substantive evidence, but that since it

15

could have been introduced as substantive evidence, the

16

defendant is not in a position to complain where the

17

confession in fact was introduced only against the

18

co-defendant with limiting instructions.

20

So, it's an a

3ut there are three important distinctions

21

between this case and Lee, and the first case — and in

In the Nieves case which is cited on footnote 2 of page

Just to emp hasize a few more points,

one is, if the question is o ne that should be determined

prior — if the question of severance is one that should

19

be determined prior to trial by the trial judge, merely

20

subject to appellate review on harmless error analysis,

21

there’s no reason why the tr ial judge should not feel

free to consider all factors as to whether confessions

factors could be taken into account by a trial judge

before the trial.

5

I'd just like to emphasize that our point is

6

essentially this:

that in determining whether the

7

defendant's confession was actually uttered at all, they

8

are naturally going to look to the co-defendant's

9

confession in this case.

knd then even if they convince

10

the jury, notwithstanding that, that the confession was

never uttered, even then they have the same problem that

12

was outlined in Bruton versus the United States.

13

QUESTION:

I suppose whether you want to

14

consider all

those other factors for purposes of

15

determining whether they interlock, depends on what you

think the purpose of interlocking is, and perhaps if the

purpose is what the government suggests,
