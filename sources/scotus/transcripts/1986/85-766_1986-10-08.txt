ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOT F. GERSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - RESUMED
MR. GERSONi

Mr. Chief Justice, just to

further elaborate on Justice Scalla's point about minor
parties, as I stated, a party qualifies as a minor party
by receiving 1 percent of the vote for an office, but
remains a minor party generally until that party
receives 20 percent of the vote In a gubernatorial
election.

The state in no way regulates the nominating

process of those minor parties.
As I was Indicating before the recess, this
case does not involve the merely internal affairs of a
private association but the public electoral functions
of major political parties.

When a major party Is

participating in a state primary election it is
performing a function that the state has delegated to
it, and the state then adopts that party's choice by
automatically and preferentially placing the nominee of
that party on the general election ballot.
The duties assigned to major parties do not
become matters of private law simply because they are
