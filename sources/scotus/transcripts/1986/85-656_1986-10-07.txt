to remain on the ballot a second time that is challenged

experience and the election with Its crowded ballot In

definitions of substantial support and argue under this

Court's decision the Washington requirement Is neither

16

unconstitutional per se and is less than the numerical

test that this Court has approved» such as the Jenness

v* Fortson» a 5 percent of voters test» arguing that It

19

is less burdensome on minor parties and serves to

improve the political debate which Is the constitutional
