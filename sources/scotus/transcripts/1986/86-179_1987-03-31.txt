ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE,

8
9

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS IN NO. 86-179
NR. LEE:

10
11

ESQ.,

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves the constitutionality of

12
13

Congress*

14

It is an amendment which restored to religious employers

15

a right that they nad enjoyed for 175 years before there

16

was a Title VII:

17

for their own employment without running afoul of Title

18

VII's prohibition against employment discrimination

19

based on religion.

20

1972 Amendment to Section 702 of Title VII.

the right to prefer their own members

When originally enacted in

1964, Section 702

21

permitted religious preference hiring, but restricted it

22

to the church's religious activities.

23

purpose of the 1972 amendment was to free the courts and

24

the EEOC from entangling themselves in deciding which of

25

a church's activities are and which are not sufficiently

Section 7D2 has none of the traditional

3

indicia of an establishment of religion.

4

endorsement,

5

another.

It involves no

no subsidy, no preference for one “sect over

The statute simply does not promote religion.

6
7

All that it does is to permit churches to promote

8

religion in the same way that they have done for all but

9

eight years of our national existence.
There is nothing in the establishment clause

10
11

that prohibits churches from promoting religion.

12

Indeed, that is the vary reason for their existence.
And neither does the establishment clause

13
14

prohibit government from permitting churches to promote

15

religi on.

16

Neither the Appellees nor the District Court

17

has ever really faced up to the nature of the problem

18

that Congress faced, and the limited range of available

19

solutions to Congress, given the other decisions that

20

Congress made.

21

Congress could have simply made Title VII

22

applicable only to race, sax and national orioin.

23

once it decided to include religion as one of its

24

criteria, it had to provide some kind of exemption from

25

that criterion for religious employers, lest, in
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

But

1

violation of the free exercise clause, they be prevented

2

from hiring their own members for purely ecclesiastical

3

positions.

4

Once it is recognized then, as I gather it is

5

by everyone in tnis courtroom, that the Constitution

6

required Congress to pick some exemption, the only real

7

issue is whether the Constitution precluded the choice

8

that Congress made.
In other words, Congress having opted for an

9
10

anti-employment discrimination package that is not quite

11

as large as the one the Appellees would have chosen, is

12

Congress constitutionally obligated to make it larger?
The answer to that question has to be no.

13
14

Surely the establishment clause is not violated every

15

time government regulates churches to a lesser degree

16

than it might have, or every time that it lifts a

17

governmental burden that voald otherwise be imposed.

18

That means that the real objection to this

19

statute finds its roots not in constitutional law, but

20

in public policy.

21

Appellees wish that Congress had gone further and

22

prohibited more than Congress chose to prohibit.

It boils down to the fact that the

23

The only serious --

24

OUESTIDN;

25

matter.

Hr. Lee, if I may inquire about one

I guess this case involves nonprofit entities

operated by the LDS Church?

2

MR. LEE;

That is correct.

3

QUESTION:

Now, what about the application of

4

the statute to profit-making businesses of churches?

5

you think that there is a legitimate secular reason for

6

the government to allow religious entities to operate

7

profit-making businesses and be exempted from Title VII?
BR . LEE:

8
9
10

reason.

I do, Justice O’Connor,

I stress that it is not this case,

for this
as you

indica ted .

11

The first reason that I give that answer is

12

that as is stressed by most of the amicus briefs that

13

have been filed in this case, the distinction between

14

what is secular and

15

difficult one to draw.

what is sectarian is a very

And, indeed, that intrudes.

16
17

Do

And that’s why

Congress drew the line where it did.

18

And as a consequence, we think that at any

19

point along the employment spectrum, you’re going to

20

have some line-drawing problems.

21

place to draw the line is the place where Congress drew

22

it.

23

Moreover,

Therefore, the best

this Court has said many times --

24

beginning at least as early

as Walz versus the Tax

25

Commission -- that Congress does have a certain degree
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of line-drawing capacity in this area; that there is a

2

channel between what the establishment clause prohibits

3

on the one hand ani the free exercise requires on the

4

other, and that within that channel Congress ma'y safely

5

legislate.
If that means anything at all, we think it

6
7

gives Congress the right to draw the kind of distinction

8

that it drew in this case,
QUESTION;

9
10

difficult choice, if applied to a profit-making business.
MR. LEE;

11
12

Hell, I think it*s a much more

There is no question; there is no

question that it is a more difficult choice.
But two points;

13

One, I think that at the end

14

of the day you’re going to be better off observing the

15

dividing line that Congress drew and giving that

16

deference that the Court has said since Walz that we

17

give to Congress in the area.

18

does not apply to this case.

But,

in any event, it

So the oily serious First Amendment issue in

19

20

this case is presented not by what Congress did in 1972,

21

but by the District Court’s own test, which by its terms

22

requires federal courts to decide what a church really

23

believes and whether its practices are true to its

24

beliefs.

25

The Court's opinion, for example, quotes the
8
ALDERSON ^PORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Book of Mormon, the Doctrine Covenants, a theological

2

treatise entitle! "Mormon Doctrine," and then draws its

3

own conclusions as to what the church’s tenets really

4

are and whether there is an adequate fit between what

5

the church believes and what it does.
We submit that the First Amendment reserves

6
7

those kinds of issues;

what are a church*s beliefs, and

8

are its practices the best way to achieve them to the

9

churches themselves.
But the Court need not reach that issue,

10
11

because if the principle that has been so often stated

12

that there is some room between the floor and the

13

ceiling, between the free exercise and the establishment

14

clause, then it must mean at a very minimum that

15

Congress can constitutionally choose between two

16

exemptions where those were its only options, where

17

either one is going to have a differential effect on

18

religion.
But the one that Congress chooses is the one

19
20

that does not put the courts and the EEOC into the

21

business of deciding what are religious beliefs and how

22

they can best be achieved.
Finally, the Appellees have never really faced

23
24

up to the fact that this is not a religious benefit

25

case.

This is not a case in which Congress, starting
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

from ground zero, gave to religious organizations

2

something that the/ would not have had absent any action

3

by Congress at all.

4

It is a religious exemption case, and' the

5

religious exemption cases make very clear that the rule

6

has to be different for those cases.
The Appellees and the District Court’s

7

8

position is very simple.

It is that the statute is

9

unconstitutional because its effect is to give religious

10

employers something that non-religious employers do not

11

enjoy and that it, therefore, fails the effects prong of

12

Lemon.

13

But if that’s the rule, then it’s hard to see

14

how any religious exemption can ever survive, because by

15

their very definition, religious exemptions always

16

affect religious groups and always affect them

17

differently than other groups.

18

If that were enough to invalidate it, then

19

Walz and Gillette would have to be overruled* Bob Jones

20

would have been decided differently.

21

And in United States versus Lee, the Amish

22

social security exemption case, Congress could not

23

constitutionally have exempted the Amish from social

24

security taxes, even if it had wanted to* and the

25

exemption that it lid give,

which is an exemption that

unconstitutional.
The analysis is really no different, if it is

expressed in

6

the analysis is basically the same.

terms of the traditional Lemon test,

You look first to see whether there was a

7
8

proper purpose, and the District Court held that there

9

was.
But Lemon’s second prong inquires into primary

10
11

effect.

In an exemption case, in determining

12

primaryness, you have to consider not just the effect if

13

Congress had done -- if Congress acted, but you have to

14

make a comparison between the effect of Congress doing

15

nothing and Congress doing what it did.
The Appellees* case could not survive a

17

comparative analysis, as even they appear to concede on

page 22 of their brief.

ON BEHALF 3F THE APPELLANT IS CASE NO. 86-401
MR. REISOLDSs

Me. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
This is, it seems to me, a case that ‘brings to

5

the Court a First Amendment religious clause challenge

6

to legislative action in perhaps its cleanest and

7

simplest form.

8
9

Congress has barred religious discrimination
in employment decisions under Title VII, but in so doing

10

it has elected in Section 702 to exempt from that

11

prohibition religious organizations, associations,

12

institutions and corporations.

13

Rather tnan imposing certain obligations on

14

employers in order to accommodate a particular religious

15

view which was the case with the Connecticut statutes

16

struck, down in Thornton and Caldor, what Congress here

17

has done is imposed no obligation on religious employers

18

in the interest of religious accommodation.

19

In essence, it has adopted a hands-off policy

20

with regard to religious-based employment decisions of

21

religious organizations.

22

As stated, and indeed the uniformly recognized

23

purpose for leaving religious institutions alone, was

24

Congress* desire to avoid governmental control over and

25

entanglement with the affairs and activities of
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

religious organizations.
As the court below correctly found, this

3

satisfies the secular purpose requirement of Walz and

4

Gillette and the like cases of this Court.

5

Section 702 exemption removes the prospect of

6

intrusive and likely constitutionally-offensive inquiry,

7

investigation and probing by government into the

8

religious or the secular nature of church-related

9

activities.

10

On another level,

the exemption eliminates the

11

prospect of secular control over and entanglement with

12

the church’s ability to fulfill its religious mission.

13

There is thus no tension here between the

14

religious accommodation requirement that's incorporated

15

in the free exercise clause and the establishment

16

clause’s prohibition against state endorsement or

17

advancement of religion.

18

Rather, Congress*

hands-off approach brings

19

the values of both tne free exercise clause and the

20

establishment clause into perfect harmony .

21

The exemption from an intrusive government

22

regulation furthers the free exercise interest by

23

preserving the liberty of religious organizations to

24

create and exert authority over self-defining religious

25

communities, and for much the same reason, it furthers
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the establishment clause's interest in avoiding undue

2

secular control ani antanglement.

3

It cannot be, as Appellants- argue, that

4

disharmonization fails in First Amendment terms-, because

5

Congress* accommodation of religion is broader in this

6

instance than might ba required or compelled by the free

7

exercise clause.

8

Any narrower exemption, whether defined along

9

the lines suggested by the court balow or in some other

10

fashion, would of necessity bring into play the kind of

11

line drawing on secular terms that would exacerbate the

12

very tension between the two religious clauses that

13

Congress effectively avoided in Section 702.

14

Indeed, it's precisely for this reason that

15

this Court in Walz and other decisions has acknowledged

16

that there is considerable room between the floor set by

17

the free exercise clause and the ceiling that*s erected

18

by the establishment clause in which legislatures may

19

chart their own coarse of benevolent neutrality.

20

That Congress safely navigated a neutral

21

course in Section 702 is quite clear.

22

applies to all religions even handedly, not to a

23

particular sect or to select religions.

Now, Appellees have argued that the statute

5

effectively grants religious employers a benefit, that

6

is, to discriminate on account of religion, which is

7

unavailable to non-religious employers but this is the

8

inevitable conseguence of a hands-off policy by the

9

Governemnt in First

10

Amendment matters.

It allows religious institutions to advance

11

their own religious mission on their own terms and

12

through their own membership.

13

autonomy is regarded as a beneficial effect of religious

14

exemption, it is precisely-the sort of benefit that is

15

protected, not condemned, by the religious liberty

16

interest in the Free Exercise clause.

17

To the extent such

Nor is there any reason to fault the exemption

18

because it might well open the door to uneven treatment

19

of employees, either as between or among various

20

religions or as between religious organizations and

21

those that are non-religious.

22

Whatever the particular employment decisions

23

and the religious reasons on which they are based are

24

from one religion to another.

25

that determines different individual treatment but

sort constitutionally protected by the Free Exercise

clause .

4

Here, Congress acted to preserve the «autonomy

5

of religious institutions to manage their own affairs

6

with respect to matters of religious employment.

7

In fashioning a broad exemption, Congress

8

emphatically removed from the judicial agenda precisely

9

this sort of intrusive secular probing of the

10

operations, activities and beliefs of religious

11

institutions that preoccupied the Court below.

QUESTION;

4

I understand that but what' I'm

5

saying is, as I understand the argument you 're making,

HR. REYNOLDS;

it would have been a

17

I think that the legislative judgment that

19

non-interference interests implicated in the

20

establishment clause, while fully serving the religious

21

liberty interests of religious institutions that are

22

protected by the Free Exercise clause.

23

Perhaps it is a case that Congress could have

24

drawn the exemption line elsewhere, indeed even in a

25

manner that produced more secular entanglement and

intrusion by

the Courts but nothing suggests that it

must do so and whereas here Congress believes that
religious freedom concerns outweight its own interests
in imposing the regulations at issue, it should* be free
to strike the balance in favor of religious freedom.
Far from raising any First Amendment problems, such
enlightened self-restraint serves to further the
religious pluralism and peaceful coexistence between
church and state tnat lies at the heart of the religion
clauses.
Accordingly, Section 702,

Religious Exemption

in Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of *64, suffers no
constitutional infirmity, in our view, and the United
States, therefore, urges reversal of the District
Court*s judgment.

Let's look at why the statute is

14

unconstitutional as applied

to Mr. Mayson .

This statute

15

grants absolute and unyielding accommodation to the

16

interests of religious emoloyars by imposing a direct

17

and a substantial burden, both secular and religious, on

18

third partias, principally the employees.

Mow in the Thornton v. Calder case, decided in

20

1985, this Court hall that the state may not accommodate

21

the religious interests of some by imposing substantial

22

secular burdens on others.

23

Hare, it seems to me, we have a much stronger

24

case of unconstitutionality.

Because not only are

25

serious secular burdens being imposed, but serious

MR. WATKISS;

Well, Justice O'Connor, people

21

and particularly in your Wallace v. Jaffree and Wallace

22

v. Jaffree concurrence, you were considering a type of

23

accommodation that is very, very different than what

24

we've got here.

MR. WATKI33;

I think that’s probably* right.

5

And we’re not arguing that every accommodation is just

lack of neutrality, unconstitutional.

The lack of neutrality is very important,

though, as an indicia for suspicion.

2

3

won’t interfere.

4

There’s a very important passage frorrf Watson

5

v. Jones that gats repeated in variably by the Court’s

6

later opinions.

7

think it focuses on the problem with 702.

8

/lad I’d like to read it, because I

In Watson, this Court wrote:

The right to

9

organize voluntary religious organizations to assist in

10

the expression and dissemination of religious doctrine,

11

and to create tribunals for controverted questions of

12

faith within the association — and I’ll skip some of it

13

— is unquestioned.

14

All who unite themeselves to such a body do so

15

with an implied consent to this government, and are

16

bound to submit by it.

17

Now the emphasis on religious voluntarism in

18

that passage, and in all those cases, is very clear.

19

Because individuals voluntary join churches, we give

20

churches some deference.

21

This statute makes Mayson join a church to

22

keep his job, his secular job.

It subverts the very

23

notion of voluntariness wich is fundamental -- which is

24

a fundamental peg of the reasons that we give churches

I think that the best answer — the best

some minimum threshold, in order to cross what Thomas v.

2

the Unemployment Commission said, you have to get past a

3

practice that is just bizarre, that is just purely not

4

religious, this is -- that has clearly been satisfied in

5

this case, and there are no findings in the district

6

court to the contrary.

7

The district court did not make what we would

8

call findings of fact.

9

what it said

It drew conclusions of law.

And

was, that there is nothing in the Mormon

10

faith that requires employment discrimination; and there

11

is nothing that requires exercise in a gym that — that

12

practices discrim in ation.

13

But that takes entirely too narrow a view, and

14

gets the courts far too deeply into what Mormonism is

15

really all about, and the amount of leeway,

16

administrative, implementing leeway that the church

17

really has to have in order to carry out its objectives.

18

Because the fact of the matter is that the

19

court — the church has concluded that its purposes can

20

be furthered by providing a place where physical health,

21

which according to Mormon belief is intimately linked to

22

spiritual health, can be pursued in an environment where

church standards are understood, respected and

flow, finally, there has been nothing said,

either in the briefs or in this courtroom this morning,

about the fact that if you rule against my clients in

this case, that all exemptions are unconstitutional,

11

including, I submit, the 1964 version, if you really

12
