1

Today, we are before the Court with a

2

substantial body of evidence indicating that during the

3

last decade Georgia prosecutors and juries, in their

4

administration of Georgia's post-Furman capital

5

statutes, have continued to act as if seme of those old

6

statutes were still on the books.

7

A black defendant convicted in the State of

8

Georgia of the murder cf a white person goes to his

9

sentencing hearing with as serious a handicap against

10

him on racial grounds alone as if the prosecutor had

11

hard evidence that he had been tried and convicted

12

previously of another murder.

13

The color of a defendant’s skin, in other

14

words, or that of his victim, is often as grave an

15

aggravating circumstance, in fact, in Georgia, as those

16

expressly designated by Georgia’s legislature.

17

We’ve documented below the role that’s been'

18

played by racial considerations in Georgia’s capital

sentencing system.

20

Georgia sentences the killers of its white citizens at a

21

rate nearly eleven times that to which it sentences to

22

death the killers of its black citizens.

The judge accepted that test.

run under his model.

And indeed, the racial effects, as

8

Judge Forester saw the system in Georgia, actually

increased.
It's because Professor Baldus was wedded to no

10
11

prior assumptions; it's because he subjected his

12

statistical analysis to sc many varieties of review;

13

that his studies provide, I believe, such a powerful

14

indictment of the Georgia system.
Now, one would suppose that the State of

16

Georgia, faced with this serious challenge to the

17

administration of its capital statutes, would have come

18

forth with some explanation for these racial

disparities.

MR. BOGER;

They were taken under the

direction of a coding supervisor -QUESTION!

I didn't ask you that.

I asked you

who did it.
MR. BOGER;

Oh, I*m sorry.

The second study

that Professor Baldus drew on primarily for his analysis
came from the Georgia Pardons and Parole Board.

And the

Fardons and Parole Board has officers, who are college
trained, who go out and talk with the police officers
and the prosecutors who get files from the police and
the prosecutors.
QUESTION;
MR. BOGER;

Who went out and talked?
We had one witness who testified,

a Mr. Ware, who was one of these officers.

These are

us that based on his

Indeed,

Out of 17 people

Mr. Boger, I assume that this kind

of statistical evidence, if valid, with regard to

9

imposition of the death penalty, would also be valid

10

with regard to conviction; sc that if you shewed that

11

there is a disproportionate pattern of convictions of

12

those who are accused of killing white victims, or of

13

black defendants, the same problem would arise?
MR. EOGER:

14

I don’t believe we saw a pattern

15

of evidence like that, but I suppose that if one could

16

show that prosecutors were deliberately seeking lesser

charges, that the logic under the Equal Protection

Clause would extend that far.

And therefore when we see these interracial
kllings, blacks who kill whites, and we see prosecutors
disposing of these cases, and juries deciding on death
sentences, particularly when we’re asking the juries to
do that most difficult of tasks, which is to judge who
is worthy of

and who is not, it shouldn’t

be any surprise to us that some of this kind of
discrimination comes through, where it wouldn’t

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Boger, at bottom the

claim being made here is a curious one, in the sense
that in many death penalty cases, what the defendant
comes forward asking for is more opportunities for the
exercise of mercy, and to allow juries, for whatever
reason, not to impose a death penalty.
And yet you come forward with a claim that
says, in effect, not enough people -- the death penalty
is not being imposed on enough people.

Mr. Chief Ju stice, and may

it please the Court:

issues regarding the Georgia death penalt y scheme.
Initially, we're concerned with the question

18

of the application of the statistical ana lysis, both in

19

this case in particular, and in the death penalty

context as a whole.

and whether that claim has also

2

been substantiated by the facts of the case.
To begin with, I would like to point out to

3
4

the Court 'a few facts that I think are pertinent for

5

consideration .
In this case, we have a situation in which Mr.

6
7

McCleskey’s case was characterized by this study as a

8

mid-range case.
These are the facts which constitute a

9
10

mid-range case under the study in question; a police

11

officer killing, involved during an armed robbery, with

12

co-perpetrators, in bread daylight, in a store in which

13

approximately seven people were hostage, all of whom.

14
15

:;were forced to lie on the flcor, many of whom were tied
up during the commission of this crime.

16

officer.

18

The second shot fired happened to bounce cff a cigarette

19

lighter which was in his pocket.

20

indicated that would have been directly over his heart.

21

The first hit him in the eye; the fatal shet.

And there was also some indication, and the

that could be drawn, that the police officer was already

circumstance.

cases, that you would agree are comparable to this in

receive a death penalty.
There's some indication that some police

2
3

officer killings did net receive a death penalty, or

4

even some police officer killings with an armed robbery

5

did not receive a death penalty.
Those two facts alone don't make these cases

6
7

factually similar.

As I've noted, all of the previous

8

other facts which serve tc make this case that much mere

9

aggravated.
The mid-range case, and the mid-range analysis

10
11

done in this case, does not compare factually similar

12

cases.

13

is simply an aggravation level, using regression

14

analyses, that comes up with a weight to be attached to

15

this case.

And a reading cf the testimony indicates, this

There is no way of knowing whether the cases

16
17

in this so-called mid-range are factually similar at

18

all.

19

that they were factually similar.

20

As a matter of fact, it was never even asserted

It was simply asserted that once the

21

regression analysis was conducted, based on one

22

particular regression, that the aggravation level, if

23

you will, that was derived from that regression

24

similar for these cases; no indication as to whether

25

they had similar aggravating circumstances; similar

Why is this different from Title VII?

under employment situation, you’re going to have an

2

employer focussing on a -- a few specific things that

3

are the main points being utilized in evaluating whether

4

or not to hire a given employee.

5

Certain they’re going to be, in any given

6

case, some subjective factors.

But it’s not the same

7

type of focus that is being utilized when we’ve got a

8

jury looking at a unique case, a unique individual, in

9

which the jury can consider as mitigating, and determine

10

to essential afford mercy to a defendant based on

11

anything that it chooses that is present in the record

12

before the jury.

13

QUESTION;

But certainly on the theoretical

14

point of whether statistical evidence can properly be

15

used, assuming it’s reliable, as evidence of — prima

16

facie evidence of descrimination in the particular case,

17

there’s no basis for distinguishing this from the Title

18

VII situation, is there?

19

MS. WESTMORELAND;

Your Honor, I think that

20

our point is that the difference is, the number of

21

subjective factors that necessarily come into play in

22

the jury's decision-making process.

23

QUESTION;

That goes to the reliability of the

24

statistical evidence.

But as to the principal of

25

whether statistical evidence is a valid indication of —

assuming it's valid statistical evidence — is a valid

2

indication

3

there's no difference between the two.

4

of

discrimination ina particular case,

MS. WESTMORELAND;

Well, to that extent, Your

5

Honor is probably correct.

6

this type of case, it is going to be such that even if a

7

statistical analysis is dene, it is going to be

8

virtually probative of nothing, due to the fact that

9

it's simply going to be unreliable.
QUESTION;

10

But -the point being that in

General Westmoreland, one

11

difference certainly between Title VII analysis and this

12

kind of case is that under Titl*= VII you can gain relief

13

in some situations by simply proving disparate impact.

14

MS. WESTMORELAND;

This is true. Your Honor,

15

of course.

And in this case, we're simply far from

16

simply disparate impact, as the Court has already

17

noted.

The question is intention discrimination.
And we would submit, the question is intention

18
19

discrimination by this jury and by this prosecutor, and

20

that it simply has not been shown under the facts in

21

this case.

22

It has been asserted that we are attempting to

23

change the equal protection

24

different in a death penalty context.
*•

25

standard somehow, to make it

i

The point simply is that in this case, based
54
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

on what has been presented,

there is insufficient

evidence to draw the inference of discrimination that
this Court has drawn in other contexts.
We’re not seeking to change the standard;
simply to apply to the given facts and circumstances
presented before the Court.

To require the petitioner

to simply carry the burden of proof that the petitioner
always has in an equal protection context.
And our assertion has simply been that there
simply has not been that establishment of a prima facie
case; or, even if that case was met, certainly the
ultimate burden of proof was not met by the petitioner.
QUESTIONS

And that’s a factual matter mostly,

you say?
MS. WESTMOBELANDs
QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor.

We should go with the District

Court?
MS. WESTMORELAND*

Yes, Your Honor, that's cur

submission, certainly.
QUESTION*

So if the District Ccurt had found

the other way and accepted the statistical evidence, in
the next case, then we would likewise go with the
District Court.
MS. WESTMORELAND*

Your Honor, if the District

Court had accepted the statistical evidence, accepted

(202) 628-9300

the validity of it, certainly that would te a factual
finding of intentional discrimination, which under 42(a)
dees apply in this type of circumstance, yes.
We finally submit tc the Court that the
petitioners have attempted essentially to indict the
entire Georgia criminal justice system by the
presentation to the District Court and the presentation
to this Court.
That simply has not been done.

The evidence

in the case does not show either intentional
discrimination; not does it show any type of
arbitrariness cr capriciousness in the death sentencing
scheme in the State of Georgia.
Georgia has a valid statutory scheme that has
been upheld by this Court on numerous occasions.

It was

validly applied in this case, under the facts of this
case, to Mr. McCleskey.
If anything, the evidence presented in this
case shows that the system works; not that it does not
work .
Both experts for the petitioner testified the
system was not random.
QUESTION;

It certainly sorted cases --

But wouldn’t you agree, Ms.

Westmoreland, that the Georgia system does allow a
greater room for discretion than some of the other

states do?
MS. WESTMORELAND.*

2

Yes, Your Honor, it dees

allow more discretion, which also works tc the benefit

4

of the defendant in any given case.

QUESTION:

Georgia allows mercy tc be

extended more often than many states would allow.
QUESTION*

Right.

Arguably, it allows the jury to

take into consideration, as a mitigating circumstance,
that the victim was black.
MS. WESTMORELAND:

11

Arguably it would, Your

12

Honor.

13

consider any number of other thing in mitigation.

14

to extend mercy in any given case.

15

Sut what it also does it allow the jury to
And

And as this Court has held, there is no

16

constitutional prohibition against a jury extending in

17

any given case.

18

Thus we submit to the Court that, as noted

19

previously, the Georgia death penalty system is working

20

as it should workv is working as this Court anticipated

21

it would in Gregg v. Georgia; and the petitioner has

22

failed tc meet his burden of proof.
