ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MRS. BARTHOLD:

85-2D99, Pennsylvania against

Mrs. Barthold, you may proceed

We will hear

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Twenty years ago this Court imposed strict and

11

12

unique briefing requirements on appointed attorneys

13

seeking to withdraw because they concluded that a

14

client's first appeal was frivolous.
In addition, reviewing courts, charged with

15
16

hearing such

17

responsibility of conducting an independent review of

18

the record to determine whether the appeal was in fact

19

frivolous.

were charged with the

This issue presented by this case is whether

21

those procedures,

22

articulated by this Court in Anders v. California,

23

should be held applicable on collateral review.

below rests on an adequate and independent state basis.

9

I would like rather briefly to address

to decide that

The opinion is, of course,

a Pennsylvania

10

Superior Court opinion; although that is an intermediate

11

appellate court, it

12

decision could be had in this case.

13

The respondent is a state prisoner having been

related offenses.

She was represented by appointed counsel

17

during his trial, and during her unsuccessful direct

18

appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

19

She next sought collateral review under the

20

State Post Conviction Hearing Act statute, and counsel

21

was not appointed for her because the claims that she

22

raised were finally litigated under Pennsylvania law.

23

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, held

24

that under its supervisory rules, its rules of criminal

25

procedure, that any

defendant is entitled to counsel on

(202) 628-9300

1

a first PCHA petition, or on a subsequent petition

2

raising new issues.
When counsel was appointed for Mrs. Finley, he

3
4

reviewed the record

and concluded that he had no

5

arguable issues to raise.
He, as a result, after consulting with his

6
7

client, filed a no merit letter with the Post Conviction

8

Hearing Act court, and detailed in that letter the

9

additional claims which Mrs.

10

Finley wanted raised on her

behalf.
Based on that letter and his own independent

11
12

review of the record, the Post Conviction Hearing Act

13

judge dismissed the petition and allowed

14

they said,

And in addition, they noted that the

9
10

Pennsylvania

law with respect, to the withdrawal of

11

counsel is dervied from -- and those were their exact

12

words -- Anders v. California.
I think those two statements by the Superior

13
14

Court make it very clear that there is not an

15

independent state basis for this opinion.
That conclusion is underscored by the fact

16
17

that there is no clear statement in

it is of course very important that

16

there is no general constitutional right to counsel on

17

collateral review.

18

h

Nonetheless, the respondent claims that since

19

counsel was given, although only under a supervisory

20

rule, not under a constitutional basis, and so far as we

21

can determine, there is no state in the country that

22

gives counsel on collateral review based on a state

23

constitutional basis,

24

the right to counsel is there,

2

Anders should be applied even though we are only talking

3

about a supervisory right to counsel.
And I think respondent has really three

4
5

misconceptions.

First, respondent assumes that an

6

Anders brief is in fact an advocate's brief .
And of course, an Anders brief is not that.

7
8

What it is is a device to determine, to monitor, whether

9

counsel has in fact conducted the sort of conscientious

and thorough

appeal is in fact -- or the petition is in fact --

frivolous.

T think counsel does not take account of the

14

fact that when you get to collateral review, you are

15

getting to a procedure that

16

simply are cases without arguable issues by the time you

17

get to collateral review.

18

is so far removed that there

And I think finally the respondent assumes

19

that Anders is the only way of being sure that attorneys

20

do their job.

21

And I think that is just not so.

Attorneys do their job.

Attorneys are

22

presumed to be competent.

not to clog the coarts with frivolous arguments.

Attorneys have an obligation

Mrs. Barthold,

22

whether the respondent was sent a copy of the attorney's

24
25

may I inquire whether the record reflects

The no merit letter indicates

a carbon copy to the respondent.

14

this Court has articulated in Matthews v. Eldridge,

15

16

is the individual interest,

17

of the criminal proceeding itself; the governmental

18

interest, which would be the cost to the criminal

20

value is to be derived from

The chances of it. resulting in the

2
3

identification of cases on collateral review that truly

4

have even arguable issues, I think, is just

not likely.

I think that the Court should look at the

5

6

strains on the criminal justice system, if you conclude

7

that Anders should be applied on collateral review.

8

Because we are talking about post conviction hearing

petitions which are burgeoning out of all

1
2

states, as nearly as we can determine, that have very

3

liberal policies with respect to the appointment of

counse ; far more liberal than the federal system.
And the strain of requiring all 23 of these

5

states to superimpose Anders on top of what they're

7

giving, above and beyond what they must, will, I submit,

8

put a very great strain on the criminal justice system.

NRS. BARTHOLD;

It can simply stop affording

is something

17

that might well occur, if not in

And I would submit, Kr. Chief Justice, that it

would be unfortunate if that should happen.

reason or another to give indigents counsel when it's

21

not necessary for them to do so constitutionally.

22

Because

And I think we should encourage that, but not

23

superimpose other procedures which will make that

24

burdensome on the states.

25

Now turning to this defendant's, this

(202) 628-9300

respondent's case, she undoubtedly will argue to you

2

that there was no notice, therefore, she must

necessarily win the case; and secondly, that her

5

not raise certain arguably meritorious issues.
We have addressed both of those in our reply

With

respect to the so-called issues, I have

dealt with them in a footnote, and I truly believe that

they are in fact frivolous issues.

Thank you,

Rehnquist, and nay it please the Court.
First,

9

let me address Ms. Barthold — some of

10

the issues that she had raised, before getting into my

argument.
In

12

response to Justice O'Connor's question, in

13

this case my client told me that she never received that

14

letter.

15

Superior Court had awarded to us, that's a question of

16

evidence that is still open.

Since we didn't get the hearing that the

17

I would argue that she didn't receive the

18

notice that was required under Anders in this case.
Secondly,

19

the district attorney repeatedly

20

characterized collateral review as three or four steps

21

removed from

22

accura te .

In

the actual trial.

That's not exactly

Pennsylvania, as I would imagine in

most

24

jurisdictions, the only issues which can be raised in

which were raised in post

there might be a constitutional issue raised if counsel
