JUSTICE REHNQUISTS

Mr. Chief Justice* thank you and

nay it please the Courts

9

When we decided that we did not have John

10

Adamson as a witness* we moved to dismiss the cases

11

against Dunlap and Robison* and Dunlap's was dismissed

12

on that Monday* the day set for trial.
Adamson then was tried and convicted •

13

His

14

conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Arizona Supreme

15

Court.

16

for Writ of Habeas Corpus.

He then went into federal court with a Petition

The Ninth Circuit held that we coula not

17

prosecute Mr. Adamson on the original charge because of

19

the

20

and secondly* that Adamson did not waive his double

jeopardy r i ghts •

22

We believe that the circuit court was wrong on

23

both of those counts.

First* the circuit court drew

24

own conclusions as to the meaning of the plea agreement

25

and Adamson's letter to us.

It should not have done

that* as that was a question for the Arizona courts*
That was* we contend* a matter of Arizona law

and it was composed of determinations on factual

If* then* the finding of the Arizona court
that Adamson breached his plea agreement Is accepted*

10

the next question is whether anything prevented

11

prosecution on that original charge.

12

said that Brown versus Ohio prevented the prosecution

13

but we do not believe that that is correct.

14

The Ninth Circuit

As this Court noted in Jeffers versus United

15

States* there are exceptions to the Brown lesser

16

included offense rule.

17

the defendant asks for two trials* or where his

18

deliberate actions result in two trials.

19

One of those exceptions is where

In this case* Adamson's, deliberate breach

20

resulted in two trials and he knew that would be the

21

result of his breach for he had agreed to that.

22

QUESTION.

Mr. Schafer* let me just ask one

23

procedural question* If I may.

I guess the respondent

In this case Adamson's breach resulted in
those two trials and he knew what he was doing.
QUESTION;

Nr. Schafer* if the Supreme Court

of Arizona had come out the other way in construing
Adamson's plea bargain* you would concede* I suppose*
that what he said was correct?
MR. SCHAFER.

I think I would have to* Your

QUESTIONS

If he hadn't breached his

plea then he was entitled to have the government perform
too?
MR. SCHAFER.
QUESTIONS

Yes* if they had ruled that way.

And as I understand* what he says

is that as soon as he got the final word from the
Supreme Court of Arizona on their construction of it* he
offered to restore matters to the status quo ante as
best he could.

Oo you disagree with that.

did.

I don't disagree with what he

I think I would phrase it a tittle differently

than you did.
It wasn't as best he could.

What he said was*

we'll go back to the original plea agreement and there
is not much question.

We said no* we cannot do that.

Me cannot go back to the agreement that you just
breached.

We tried to cone up with an agreenent that

construct such an agreement.

4

QUESTICN.

And so* you say he construed — and

5

I am not saying you are wrong* but you say he construed

6

the agreement at his peril* so to speak* like most other

7

contracting parties do.

the court* there is the final say* you have breached?

Perhaps my question* the

10

word “construe1* — I think he just took a position*

11

“This is It.

12

We are not going to testify.“

QUESTION:

Isn’t It rather hair-splitting to

13

say that the state court has the ultimate word on what

14

the contract means?

15

have to have the ultimate word on whether indeed there

16

was a voluntary waiver of the double jeopardy

17

protection* isn't that right?

18

You agree that the federal courts

MR. SCHAFER:

I think we have to concede* Your

19

Honor* that that would be a federal question as to

20

whether double Jeopardy was waived.

21

QUESTION;

Well* there could hardly be a

22

voluntary waiver if the meaning of the contract was

23

unclear* could there?

24
25

MR. SCHAFER;

Your Honor* I see that quite

clearly and that's a factual determination* as to what

15

and I liken it to this where there is a retrial after

18

should not apply in this situation.

23

NR. SCHAFERS

Hence* I am asking you whether you are

I believe I would be* Your

24

Honor* and my argument is that Johnson versus Zerbst

25

really should not apply here because there are other
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

considerations that this Court has to have in mind and

2

they could not be fulfilled* I think in roost of the

3

cases* if we were to apply a Johnson versus Zerbst

4

theory to this and require that there be a knowing and

5

voluntary waiver by the defendant*
However* if this Court is to say that Johnson

6
7

versus Zerbst applies* it seeros to me that this record

8

is quite clear that Mr. Adamson knew exactly what he was

9

doing.

There is a very lengthy plea taking by Judge

10

Birdsall* which as I recall is about 35 pages* where

11

this is discussed with Hr. Adamson* the plea agreement.
In fact* every one of the paragraphs in the

12
13

plea agreement is discussed and at the end of that* ana

14

all through it* he indicates that he knew exactly what

15

he was doing.
I believe this case is more like Ohio versus

16
17

Johnson in that hr. Johnson pleaded to two of four

18

counts.

19

included offense rule came into play and double jeopardy

20

barred it* and this Court said no* that that is not true.

21

The argument was raised that the lesser

Underlying the double jeopardy principle

is a

22

realization that there are few hard rules that can be

23

drawn* and that the solution in each case lies more in

24

an analysis of the respective interests involved.

25

Adamson had an interest in seeing to it that the state
