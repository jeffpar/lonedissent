ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. DERSHOWITZ

i

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

The State of Arizona seeks to execute two

11

young men who it acknowledges lacked the specific intent

12

to kill, and did not, in fact, kill.

13

It also acknowledges the categorical rule, as

14

this Court categorized it in Cabana, precluding any

15

state from executing, quote, a person who has not in

16

fact killed,

that there was no

What do you mean by that?

Well, whatever the state says, what

2

about the Supreme -- what did the Supreme Court of

3

Arizona find?

4
5

MR. DERSHOWITZ;

It also found, in its first

appeal, that there was no specific intent --

6

QUESTION;

Well, what about the second?

They

7

recited the facts and said that the evidence

8

demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner

9

intended to kill.

10
11

MR. DERSHOWITZ.*

But they made a

distinction between specific or individualized intent --

I’m talking about the Supreme Court

of Arizona.

18

MR. DERSHOWITZ;

20

matter.

QUESTION;

I know.

But we have to look --

we're reviewing that judgment.

The second opinion said

There's a difference between intent

The first opinion said

HR. DERSHOWITZ;

It was the very difference

that was raised in this Court in Enmund,

and the

10

argument that was made in Lockett:

11

presumed intent, or actual intent versus legal intent.

And what the Court.was saying --

QUESTION;

Well, I thought the — I thought,

14

facts, and they found intent, based on those facts,

They found beycnd reasonable

QUESTION:

What are we supposed tc do about

that ?

21

MR. DERSHOWITZ;

Well, you're supposed to ask

22

the question, how did they construe the word "intent".

23

The issue before this Court is the legal interpretation

24

of intent.

25

Put another way, can the Arizona Supreme Court

2

stated in the Enrnund case, in specific response,

way, to an argument made by

the very argument it makes here was made by the Arizona

Attorney General —

MR. DERSHOWITZi

by the

the Arizona Supreme Court,

Florida.
-- as amicus, as amicus --

8

they filed an amicus brief in the Enrnund case -- and

9

they argued, quote, it is just as proper to say that one

10

who felony murdered through a risk creation

11

for the death as it is to say that one who

12

premeditatedly murdered was at fault for this death.

13

And they should be treated similarly.

The same argument was made by the Florida

15

Attorney General, and

16

Court in Enrnund, as it was, Your Honor, rejected by you

17

in the Lockett case, when in Lockett -- remember that in

18

Lockett the Florida court had found -- had found that

the defendant had acted purposefully.

Can foreseeability be interpreted to mean
constructive intent?
QUESTION;

This Court?
What degree of foreseeability under

our test do you think is permissible?
MR. DESSHOWITZ;

Yes, yes.

What about -There is a degree

of foreseeability, and that's the degree of

10

foreseeability this Court set out in the Enmund case,

11

and I quote its language;

12

It would be very different if the likelihood

13

of a killing in the course of a robbery was so

substantial that one should

That was the plan that was used.

And it

There was not a shot fired.
There had been a promise made by the boys*

Not a shot was fired until two cr three days
later, when the father took

And the boys at that point certainly were

Beth the trial

court and the Court of Appeals found, the killing in
this case was not necessary to the carrying out of the
felony, almost as if to answer the Enmund point, saying,
if it was so essential to the felony, that would be
different.
But they found, as part of the aggravating
factors, ironically, that it was not necessary.

QUESTION:

When you say the Court cf Appeals,

were also not predictable.

I mean the killings of the

Lyons family.
Obviously, there were two situations here, the
breakout at the prison, carefully planned after a
promise.

Not a shot was fired.

Had a shot been fired,

the prosecutor said the plan would have failed.

That's

why no shots were fired.
Three days later, the father takes the young
boys when he’s holding a family hostage and says, in

Hr. Dershowitz, suppose we read the

10

Supreme Court opinion as saying specific intent or any

other kind of intent that satisifes Enmund we found to

14

Then we must go and say, what?

15

What would

HR. DERSHOWITZ-:

There is no way,

Your Honors,

with all due respect, of reading the Arizona Supreme

QUESTION:

They

Just accept my assumption for the

moment, that that’s the way we read it.
Now, what would be our standard, then, of
reviewing that finding?
HR. DERSHOWITZ:

You’re arguing the facts.
Oh, no, no, no.

We're

arguing that this Court has made a legal, constitutional

(202) 628-9300

conclusion as to what kind of intent must be found.
QUESTION;

Yes, yes.

HR. DERSHOWITZ;

Your Honor in Lockett

characterized it as purposefulness.

The Supreme Court

in this case -- in Enmund, found it as intent in fact.
What this Court has done is, it's taken a
different concept, foreseeability, a concept that was
rejected in Enmund, and it said, magically, we now
redefine foreseeability to mean intent.
If that were allowed to stand, any state could
now circumvent this Court’s decision in Enmund and say,
well, recklessness means intent.

Well, carelessness

means intent .
When this Court said intent -QUESTION;

Well, again, just suppose we don’t

understand the Supreme Court of Arizona tc have applied
a legal standard —

It did.

Well, I know but —

General acknowledges it did.

You say it, but I’m not all that

So if I’m net convinced, what am I

supposed to do with this case?

should ask the Attorney General of Arizona, and he will

tell you that's he convinced, because it's clear.

3

QUESTION:

Well, nc, but give me seme advice.

4

What should I do if I think that the Supreme Court of

5

Arizona purported to apply the right standard of

6

intent?

7

they just made a mistake?

8

MR. DERSHOWITZ:

Then do I go through these facts and say, well,

No, no.

Because if you can't

finding.

QUESTION;

That is clear.

There is no

Well, if that's true, of course,

that’s the end of the case.
MR. DERSHOWITZ:

That's the end of the case.

Your Honor, we think that's the end of the case.

19

But we think not only can there be no finding

20

-- and that's, by the way, what distinguishes this case

from Cabana v. Bullock.

Mr. Dershowitz, I'm still not clear

on what you mean by specific intent.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I believe this case raises three issues that
stem from Enmund.
The first, I believe, is whether Arizona
courts adequately addressed

the Enmund issue at all.

The second, I believe, is whether Enmund

22

prohibits a death sentence fer someone who did not do

23

the atual act of killing.

24
25

And the third is,

what should this Court do

with a state court finding of fact that Enmund has been

2
3

I will address those three issues, in that
order.

4

First, did Arizona adequately address the

5

Enmund issue to begin with?

6

A defendant’s participation, relative to the

7

participation of the others, has, since 1974, always

8

been a concern in death penalty cases in Arizona.

9

And I believe that it did.

One of the statutory factors that may mitigate

10

a sentence is a defendant’s

11

crime, again

12

crime.

13

minor participation in the

compared to other participants in the

Whether or not the defendant raises that point

14

in the trial court, which is the sentencer in the State

15

of Arizona, the sentencer must determine what the extent

16

of the defendant's participation was; and if it was

17

minor, according to the statute, that may -- but it does

18

not necessarily -- mean that the sentence may be

19

mitigated.

20

Now prior to about 1978, the consideration

21

that was given to that particular factor, the minor

22

participation, was rather perfunctory.

23

however, with the Lockett opinion, and the questions it

24

posed as to whether a death

25

Lockett
This case, I believe, is an example of that

3

change. Here the trial court had before it the two

4

statements of each of the petitioners, that each of them

5

gave prior to their trials.

6

The reports the trial court also had of the

7

probation department, one of which contained a very

9

and the trial court also had the evaluation

He was the one who also said that he believed

18

that the boys were at the Mazda when the actual

19

shootings took place.

20

Ricky, however, tells a different story.

21

Also, each petitioner -- and the state, as a

22

matter of fact — submitted written memos to the trial

23

court, prior to the sentencing, arguing the aggravation

24

and the mitigation, specifically addressing themselves

25

to Lockett, and the question it raised of intent and
30

limited participation.

2

The state, in those memos, argued that a death

3

penalty could be imposed for murder felony; and the

4

petitioners argued, among other things — they had a

5

rather lengthy memo -- that

6

and that under Lockett, their participation was so

7

minor, their participation was so limited, that a death

8

sentence would be disproportionate to their involvement

9

in the crime.

they had no intent to kill,

10

After a joint sentencing -- and the sentencing

11

was joint as to both petitioners here and also as to all

12

the crimes committed; and that, by the way, involved

13

actual live evidence other than the statements I've

14

mentioned, concerning not only this case, but the other

15

crimes that were committed -- after that hearing, the

16

trial court said that he disagreed with the petitioners’

17

arguments.

18

He said that their involvement was not minor;

19

that they were active and equal participants right up to

20

the moment of the shooting;

21

equal blame with everyone else.

22

and that they had to share

Then that point, the extent of their

23

participation, was specifically argued in briefs and

petitioners on a direct appeal.

And the Arizona Supreme Court, after its ovn

independent review of the record which it dees in every

came to the same conclusion

as the trial court.

they said, was not minor.

that of the actual killers.

It was substantial, said the

Then the Arizona Supreme Court, citing both

10

Lockett and the Eighth Amendment, said, and I quote;

assent to the retributive principle of justice, which

12

demands that persons be punished in proportion to their

13

personal involvement in the crime, focussing the inquiry

14

on the harm which may fairly be attributed to the

15

participants’ conduct.

17
18

Now that ended the direct appeal on those
murder convictions.
A few years later, this Court announced its

decision in Enmund v. Florida.

Again, along with

Now, from that decision of the Arizona Supreme
Court, both Tisons petitioned this Court.
Through all of this, the trial court, twice in

They came out after the car was stopped with
the guns drawn.

The first little side trip that was

made was then made, I think the record indicates, of the
trial testimony, about seven-tenths of a mile off of
that highway.
From there, once the cars were stepped and the
exchange of goods between the Lincoln and the Nazda was
going on, another little drive of the Lincoln was taken,
50 or 75 yards away from that spot.
Now, Raymond did that driving.

.Again, he

says, at the request of my father, I drove the Lincoln
over to that spot 50, 75 yards away.
After that,

this family, who was standing tack

and forth in various places, were escorted to the

fact, I think at one spot in the statement, Ricky says,
we always had those guns.

MR. SCHAFER;
very well can be.

Yes, Your Honor, I believe it

And here

I believe the Arizona

Supreme Court was saying — although they did not use
any language from the Model Penal Code as I have; but to
me, that's what they were saying.
And they do have a reference on a page that’s
been quoted from already, page 346 in the Joint
Appendix, that these people may not have seen that these
particular people were going to be killed, but they
knew, contemplated, that there would be harm resulting
from what they had done and
QUESTION;

what they participated in.

Whether they intended these

particular people to die or not?
MR. SCHAFER;

These particular ones.

And I

believe that gets back to the initial question that Mr.
Dershowitz was asked about specific intent.
If you go back to the first Arizona Supreme
Court opinion, where they use the word, specifically, I
believe as I read that opinion, that is what Justice

Struckmeyer said, a different justice than wrote the

2

second opinion.

3

He was saying that although the record may not

4

show that they had a specific intent to kill these

5

specific persons, that does not make any difference.

6

Although he doesn't go as far as to talk about intent.

7

QUESTION;

May I ask a question about that,

8

though?

Referring again to that critical page from the

9

Enmund opinion, the next sentence refers to cases in

10

which death sc frequently occurs in the course of a

11

felony for which killing is not an essential ingredient.

12

MR. SCHAFER i

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

Do you

think the killing was an

14

essential ingredient in this case of either the escape

15

cr the kidnapping?

16
17

MR. SCHAFER;

I don't believe it was an

essential ingredient of either of those.

18

I believe it is much more arguable that it was

19

practical, an essential agreement to effect a safe

20

escape.

21

And there is one statement that -- I believe

22

it is Raymond now -- says that with his father, it was a

23

matter of no survivals.

24

everything that went on out there by saying, and this is

25

almost a direct quote;

And he says, he summarizes most

We all knew the odds that we

And I believe that summarizes a gccd deal of
what happened.

They knew the odds.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. SCHAFER:

What were the odds?
The odds were that they would

conceivably end up with a death sentence because someone

7

could easily have killed, as is what happened.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ, ESQ.,

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

14

MR. DERSHOWITZ:

15

First, there is a specific finding on page 336

Thank you.

16

that it was not essential to the defendants’ continued

17

evasion of arrest that these persons be murdered.

18

Second, I must correct the record, because

19

this Court has been badly misinformed about the status

20

of Ricky Tison’s statements.

21

General that Ricky Tison consistently said he was not

22

sent away to get water.

23

We heard from the Attorney

I categorically dispute that.

There is not a

24

single statement in this record by Ricky in which he

25

does not consistently say that the boys,

all three of

55
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

them, were sent away to get

water

There is only a dispute as to whether they
remained there at the time the shooting began, whether
they were on

the way back or at the scene of the crime.

In fact, Ricky's first statement when he was
arrested at gunpoint at the shootout is -- and here's
the testimony at the trial -- at this point Gary told
the boys to go back and get the water
Everybody agrees with that.
At about the time they got back to the Mazda
-- the Mazda

-- they heard the shotguns gc off.

Due to

the darkness, all they could see were flashes from the
shotguns.
There is a disagreement, we acknowledge that.
The state concedes that it is essential to this case
that they be present at the scene of the crime.

Why is

presence essential?
Generally, presence is essential because it is
evidentially relevant to the intent of the defendants.
Buy here we have presence if -- at best,
presence coming back -- after any doubts had been
resolved in their minds about whether the father would
kill, when the father says,

no, go get the water.

And in fact, if you look at the record of this
case, you will see on page 21 that the young boy's

struggling with this case, is followed by, that’s what I
think now about it.
In other words, at the time of the ccnfessicn,
it occurred to him that the father was struggling.
There is a lot of chronological confusion in this case.
When the young boys’ statements are read as such, they
always come out saying, in effect, at the time we didn’t
know what was going on.
Then they're in jail, or they’re arrested, and
they’re asked about their state of mind, and they
reconstruct their state of mind as of that point in
time.
The state categorizes the Enmund finding as a
finding of fact.

It is anything but a finding of fact.

It is a construction of law.

It deserves no weight by

It is an attempt to reinterpret Enmund*s

intent.
Statements of fact have been found, and they
were found in our favor.

— during the second — the first appeal,

one of the issues raised by the defendants was whether
or not they were entitled to a second degree murder
instruction.
Under Arizona law, if there was any evidence

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

to support second degree murder, they would be entitled

2

to it.

3

The Arizona Supreme Court said they were not

4

entitled to a second degree instruction, because there

5

was no evidence of second degree murder; only evidence

6

of felony murder.

7

Second degree murder would include

8

foreseeability, recklessness, all of the things we're

9

talking about.

Yet the Arizona Supreme Court rejected

10

an instruction on second degree murder, saying,

11

therefore, that this was an

12

all or nothing case.

This was felony murder, that is, accidental

13

murder carried out in the course of a felony, or it was

14

not murder at all.
And if that's net the case, then they're

15
16

entitled to a new trial.

17

there was any evidence of recklessness, of second degree

18

murder, in this case, they would be entitled to a new

19

trial.

20

Because in Arizona law, if

The jury should not have had an

21

23

issue, and that was not the case under Arizona law.

That should not have been the

Nothing could be further from the truth.

The trial court's findings about these two
