The Alaska -- the Alaska

25

But there were also indications of interest on

But these particular victims and

their fathers are no longer there?

11

MR. BRUCE;

12

The criteria that are relevant to the

13

balancing test have been limited so that the infinite

14

permutations cf possibly relevant factors will not cause

15

confusion about the proper limits of court martial

16

jurisdiction.

17
18
19

And the outcome of the balancing tests depends
on the facts in each case.
In

this case there's no military interest that

20

outweichs the petitioner's interest in the greater

21

protections of a civilian trial.

22

Now the limits on

court martial jurisdiction

23

are not based solely on the facts, the fact that court

24

martials do net give service members all of the

25

protections they would receive in a civilian trial.

the O'Callahan decision

basically goes through the history, especially at the

time of the founding of this country, and also the

MR. BRUCE:

Well,

even after the fcundinc of

2

this country, O'Callahan seems to indicate that there

was a period of time when in this country most ordinary

offenses were not tried by court martial.

QUESTION:

Well, do you think then the early

cases from this Court didn't properly reflect this view

17

of the founding fathers?

20

MR. BRUCE:

I don't think the early decisions

of this Court directly addressed this particular issue.
QUESTION:

I think your statement, there's a

21

historic disapproval in this country, simply isn't

22

supported by those early cases.

23
24
25

I mean, O'Callahan was a sharp departure from
the precedents of this Court, I think.
MR. BRUCE;

case.
It totally ignored, or unjustifiable minimized

petitioner’s interest in the greater protections of a

10

result from the effect of these offenses on the victims

12

Factually, however, the government was unable

13

to prove any significant or direct impact on the Coast

Guard at trial.

When make-weight arguments concerning

20

nondispositive factors are stripped away from the Court

21

of Military Appeals’ decision, it’s clear that it’s

22

based entirely on the dependent status of the victims.

23

The Court of Military Appeals did discuss two

24

other factors that are unrelated

25

of the victims, that is, the pendency of other court

to the dependent status

Alaska

might face in prosecuting the petitioner.

3

These are simply make-weight arguments,

however.

these offenses on the Coast Guard.

6

They have nothing to do with the impact of

And factors such as these are too easily

7

manipulated and too far removed from the real interests

8

that should be balanced to be helpful in setting clear

limits on court martial jurisdiction.

Because of the dependent status of the

victims, the Court of Military Appeals also discussed

found that these offenses made the fathers

14

less effective and unwilling to serve with the

15

petitioner in the future.

16

From this it inferred that their units would

suffer some less of morale.

unlikely loss of morale is really the only direct --

of Military Appeals discussed.

Mow, admittedly, that’s just a summarization.

The service connection analysis applied by the

2

Court of Military Appeals is not bound by the result

that this Court’s service connection -- this Court’s

sufficient to outweight the petitioner’s interest in a

The Court of Military Appeals seems to have
embraced the position of one writer who suggested that

the imagination of the prosecutor was the only

jurisdiction now.

The Court of Military Appeals service

13

Thank you Mr. Bruce.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE R. FIDELI,

ESQ.,

AMICUS CURIAE ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FIDELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
First,

if

I may respond briefly to a question

8

that Justice Blackmun raised during Commander Bruce's

9

presen tation.

10

On page 57 of the Joint Appendix there is a

11

stipulation that indicates that if the Coast Guard were

12

to determine that the court martial were without

13

jurisdiction to prosecute the Alaska offenses, the

14

district attorney's office would reconsider its decision

15

not to prosecute.

16

So that there's no sense in this case that the

17

state has washed its hands of the matter.

18

waiting to see the outcome.

19
20

It's simply

There are, we submit, no reasons to reconsider
the O'Callahan and Relford cases.

21

There are three possibilities that might lead

22

the Court, as a conceptual matter, to reconsider one of

23

its prior decisions.

24
25

One would be, for example, if it proved that
the historic data on which an earlier decision had been
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

predicated were incorrect or incomplete.

2

has pointed tc nothing in this case that cast doubts on

3

the historical materials that were presented earlier.

4

6

The government

And we know of nothing we can add to what was
before the Court when O’Callahan was decided.
A second factor that might lead the Court to

7

reconsider a

8

had proved to be unworkable.

9

case with respect to the O’Callahan and Relfcrd

10

prior determination would be if the test
But that also is not the

decisions .k

11

The O’Callahan and Relford decisions, though

12

they’ve generated some decisions, some decisional law,

13

in the military,

14

presented a substantial problem.

15

and in the Article III courts, have not

QUESTION;

Well, one reason to reconsider

16

O’Callahan would be if we simply felt it was wrong as a

17

matter of constitutional law.

18

And of course those questions are always open.

19

MR. FIDSLL;

20

That question obviously is always

I would like to, if I have a moment, comment

that Solorio was deprived of two things of value by the

11

Number one, he was deprived of a complete

12

defense to the court martial, because the Court of

13

Military Appeals changed the rules on him.

14

Number two, because the U.S. and Alaska are

15

separate sovereigns, the punishment is additive;

cumulative.

it was announced in such landmark decisions as Reid v.

announced in cases like Reid and Toth and Kinsella,

18

which were, after all, greatly concerned with the civil

However, the -- what O’Callahan did indeed depend

It may be, Justice Scalia, that if the rule we

11

propose, which is the pre-0’Callahan rule, of status

12

only, were to be reinstated, aspects of the military

13

justice system would be subject to review, not on

14

jurisdictional grounds, but on due process grounds.

15

Indeed, the question of command influence,

which has been very significantly address by both

17

Congress and regulation since O'Callahan has been tried,

18

are issues which have been brought to this Court, and

19

which as recently as yesterday, the Court denied

certiorari in cases raising that issue.

So it's not as if

been the defense of this case in the courts below and in

this Court, both in the oral and written presentations.
It

Douglass’ mysterious term, as responding to the age-old

the congressional determination of what the jurisdiction

the ex post facto argument

to be properly here.

dependency status.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. BRUCE, JR., ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER?

18

MR. BRUCE;

First of all, I’d like to address

19

the suggestion that there should be a per se rule, that

20

any offense against a dependent should be service

21

connected.

22

I believe it was in the case of Toth v.

23

Quarles that this Court pointed out that the purpose of

24

the military is to fight wars, and that other things

25

that it does

tend to detract from that.

And I would say that if all of the offenses

2

against dependents are held to be service connected,

3

that's going to seriously detract from the military's

4

primary purpose of fighting wars.

5

I mean, you can obviously think of cases that

are even further removed from military interest and

discipline, or its military

We wouldn't be saying, you know, that it must

be done this way; we'd just be saying that it can be, as

12

a constitutional matter, it's permissible.

13

Now if Congress agrees with you that the

14

military should expend its energies on something else,

15

it takes a stroke of the pen.

MR. BRUCE:

Well,
