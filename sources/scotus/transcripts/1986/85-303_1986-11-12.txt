RIEDERER:

Mr.

Chief Justice,

and may

it

please the Court;
This case is here

11

on a petition for certiorari

12

to the Missouri Supreme Court.

The State submits that

13

the court below erred

Amendment when it required the suppression of the

15

respondent’s

16

and

17

confession,

in its construction of the Fourth

palm print taken while in police custody;

that it erred

in the suppression of the respondent’s

as the fruit of

the poisonous tree.

This case raises the issue of whether an

18
19

arrest

on a warrant

can be invalidated because of the

20

subjective state of mind of

21

arrest.
The facts of this

When they discovered that a warrant, a parking

warrant, had been issued by the Municipal Division of

4

the Circuit Court of Jakcson County some two weeks

5

before she had become a suspect -- two weeks after --

6

two weeks after she had become a suspect, they arrested

~r

the respondent on the parking warrant and asked her to

8

accompany them on a pick-up order on the homicide.

/

They took her to the main police station where

9
10

they left her in the custody of the detention unit

11

officers, with directions to hold her for the crimes

12

against persons unit and the warrant service unit.
After that, she was then taken by the homicide

13
14

detectives involved in the homicide investigation;

15

explained her rights under the Miranda case, which she

16

then waived.

17

and denied any knowledge of it.

And she was questioned about the homicide

The next morning she was again taken by the

18
19

homicide detectives and explained her rights under the

20

Miranda case, which she waived again.

21

questioned her, and she denied any knowledge of the

homicide.

And again, they

She was then booked on the parking warrant,

made a bond, and was released; later appeared on the

parking violation and pled guilty and paid a $15 fine.

parking warrant charge, would her palm print have been

6

taken or not?

7

MR. RIEDERER:

The testimony in the case is

8

that on a parking warrant arrest, the usual procedure is

9

to take simply a right index finger, although the

10

detention facility officer testified that when told to

11

do so by the ID department of the police department,

12

they sometimes take a full set of prints, including a

13

palm print.

14

were told to do so by someone else in the department.

15

But it would depend on whether or not they

QUESTION;

And I suppose there’s no claim in

16

this case, is there, that it would have been

17

unconstitutional to take the palm print just on a

18

parking warrant arrest?

19

MR. RIEDERER;

20

I don’t think there’s any claim

in this case to that effect.

21

The —

QUESTION:

Mr. Piederer, a parking warrant

issued in this case, is that a situation where a person

24

gets a parking ticket and fails to pay it?

you, that the reason that the full print was taken was

in order to obtain -- in order to investigate the murder?
MR. RIEDERER;

8

9

No, not at all, Your Honor.

It's clear that the substantial part of the motivation

10

for the arrest and the incident fingerprint was, in

11

fact, the murder investigation that was onaoing.
QUESTION;

12

Does the record show how long the

13

arrest warrant for the traffic offense had been in the

14

possession of the police?
MR. RIEDERER;

15

The record shows that the

16

arrest warrant was issued on the 8th of January.

And

17

apparently, it came to the attention of the police on

18

the 5th of February, which was the day she was

19

arrested.

I think that's a fair reading of the record.
They did not go into detail as to when it came

I*m talking about the traffic arrest.
HR. RIEDERER;

The traffic warrant, as a piece

of paper, was never in the possession of the police.

QUESTION:

In the possession of the department.

MR. RIEDERER;

What is the policy -- what was the

policy with respect to the disposition of these warrants?
HR. RIEDERER;

13

There is some testimony in the

14

record that arrest warrants on parking tickets are

15

sometimes cleaned up, so to speak, where the officers go

16

out to the homes of the people involved;

17

is not necessarily the case done in all parking

18

warrants .

although that

So sometimes they are executed in and of

of the arrest of the respondent, the arresting officers
had been ignorant of the existence of a traffic warrant,
but nonetheless, it had been outstanding?

Would your

position in this case be the same?
MR. RTEDERER:

Well, I don’t knew that our

position would be the same in this case, Your Honor.

We

-- but we have contended all along, what the State’s
position has been all along was that the officers did in
fact have knowledge of the parking warrant when they
made the arrest, and that that was -QUESTION;

And if they did not have any

knowledge of it, you wouldn't be here making this
argument ?
MR. RIEDERER:
QUESTION;

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Is it enough for the arresting

officers to merely know of the warrant, or must they
rely on it in making the arrest?
MR. RIEDERER:

I think that to sustain our

position, the officers would have to at least know of
the arrest warrant.
QUESTION:

It’s enough to know about it and

not rely on it, in your view?
MR. RIEDERER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

The --

What if the respondent had made a

full confession following her arrest?

would have -QUESTIDNi

3

4

Then I think that confession

Would that have been admissible in

your view?
MR. RIEDERER;

5

I think then the court would

6

have been called upon to examine whether or not that

7

confession, independently of the arrest, was voluntarily

8

given.

9

Under the circumstances of this case, I would

10

say that, although it's not this case, I would say that

11

confession would have been admissible.

12

But as it turned out, she denied any knowledge

13

of it, and in fact did not talk to them about the

14

homicide that evening.

15

QUESTION!

But had she done so, in your view,

16

even though technically an arrest for homicide was

17

without probable cause at that time, in your view, the

18

confession would be admissible as well?

19

MR. RIEDERER;

In my view, the confession

20

would have been admissible, because I don't think

21

there's anything that prevents the police from talking

22

to the respondent about another crime, once she's

23

lawfully in custody on the parking warrant.

24
25

And having explained her rights under the
Miranda case, she was free then not to talk

to them or

QUESTION;

2

And you think she was lawfully in

3

custody on the warrant not because they relied on it,

4

the traffic warrant, but because they knew about it?
HR. RIEDERER:

5

Well, in this particular case,

6

I think that she was lawfully in custody cn the warrant

7

because they knew about it and relied upon it.
And I think that's clear not only from the

13

Officer Stewart, who repeatedly testified

below,

Was that the finding of the courts

do you think?

MR. RIEDERER;

The -- it's my belief that

14

although there were no findings of fact or opinion in

15

the court below, the respondent's position, according to

16

her pleadings and her argument at that time was that

17

there was an arrest on the parking warrant, but that it

18

was pretextual and therefore illegal.

19

Since the trial court made no findings of

20

fact, I think it's fair to assume that the trial court,

21

in agreeing with the respondent, agreed that there was

22

an arrest on the parking warrant, but that it was in

23

fact illegal as a pretext.

24
25

And it seems that that is a fair reading of
the court below in the Missouri Supreme Court.

5

QUESTION;

Mr. Riederer, may I go back to one

6

of the questions that I guess Justice Powell may have

7

asked a similar question but, I think you said the

8

warrant -- I *m talking about the traffic warrant -- that

9

the warrant was in the computerized records.

10

Does that mean that there was not a physical

11

piece of paper that had been issued, but just the

12

information in the computer that could be — could

13

generate a warrant?

14

Or was there actually a warrant?

MR. RIEDERERi

There was a physical piece of

15

paper, which is the actual court copy of the parking

16

ticket originally issue.

17

QUESTION;

The ticket.

18

MR. RIEDERER:

Which appears on pages 5 and 6

19

of the supplemental legal file in this record, and

20

which, the face of it, the front of it is the ticket,

21

and the back of it is the court record.

22

And on that it indicates that on January 8th

23

of *82, Judge Carl issued a bench warrant for her

24

arrest, for failure to appear.

25

QUESTION;

And is there a separate piece of
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

paper that is the bench warrant, or is it just the

2

notation on the back of the ticket?
MR. RIEDERER:

3

The way I understand is how it

4

works is, that when the judge makes that notation, then

5

that is put into the computer, which is operated

6

jointly, or at least they have access jointly, between

7

the city and the police department.
QUESTIDN;

8
9
10

And then if an arrest is made

pursuant to such a warrant, does the officer take that
ticket with him, or does he take another piece of paper?
MR. RIEDERER:

11

He generally -- well, he might

12

take a piece of paper that indicates simply that there

13

is an arrest

14

also might not take any paper at all, but simply take

15

with him the knowledge that

And, of course, it’s your view as a

18

matter of Missouri law it's a proper arrest on a

19

misdemeanor like this, even without actually having the

20

warrant in the officer's possession?

21

MR. RIEDERER;

Yes, Your Honor.

I think the

22

Rustici case originally cited by the petitioner -- or

23

the respondent in this case actually stands for the

24

proposition that a municipal parking warrant may be

25

issued without its being in the possession of the

arrest is

7

justified by lawful authority, then it's a valid arrest,

8

and it cannot be transformed into a Fourth Amendment

9

violation because of the subjective motivation of the

10
11

officers.
The Fourth Amendment generally prescribes

12

seizures and searches which are unreasonable.

13

Court has uniformly held that to be reasonable, a

14

seizure must be done pursuant to a warrant or pursuant

15

to a recoanized exception to the warrant requirement.

MR. RIEDERER:

I think that in —

Is that what we should look at?
In determining what was

22

reasonable for the officer to do in this arrest, it

seems to me that the Court has already indicated that it

is not a proper inquiry to look at the subjective state

25

of mind or motivation of the officer at the time.

Should we look at what is

objectively standard and reasonable for the officers to

have done in connection with executing a traffic warrant

on the assumption that the homicide was not involved?

Let's just drop the homicide out of the case and look at

what the reasonable standard practice would have been?

In the absence of probable

The — I don’t think there’s any question here
-- once the police have her — let me back up.
The arrest here was pursuant to a warrant.

19

And once she was in custody under a valid warrant, the

20

police had the right to take her fingerprint, including

21

her palm print if they wanted to.

22

And it seems to the State that that ought to

23

end the inquiry, except that the opinion of the court

look behind the warrant, not to examine the validity of

does it indicate to you, when the officers book her for

homicide?

19

What did they arrest her for, then?
MR. RIEDERER:

I think it indicates that the

20

officers, just like Officer Stewart testified, they were

21

in fact not only interested in her because of the

22

parking warrant, they were interested in talking to her

23

about this homicide.

because she was already within the lawful custody of the

what the respondent was arguing at that time.

this was not a valid

went over to respondent's house to take her into custody

5

for a pick-up on homicide.

6
7

8
9

The State has conceded there was no probable
cause for that arrest.
Coincilentally, when he got to her home, he
ran her address through the police department computer,

10

and was told

11

existed authorizing that she be taken into custody on a

12

park -- a failure to pay a parking fine.

by that computer that a parking warrant

But that's not what happened here.

The

QUESTION;

(Inaudible.)

As I read their

ME. LOCASCIO;

MR. LDCASCIO;

QUESTION:

5

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, it seems to me that what the

Supreme Court was saying was the latter.
MS. LOCASCIO:

6

Yes, Your Honor.

As Justice

7

White pointed out earlier, the Supreme Court of

8

Missouri’s opinion said that there was a conflict in the

9

evidence on whether she was arrested on the parking

10

warrant.
The trial court resolved those conflicts in

11
12

favor of the defendant.
QUESTION:

13

Implicit --

But it isn’t clear on which basis.

14

On the basis that there was no arrest on the parking

15

ticket?

16

on the parking ticket, but that that arrest was

17

pretextual, that that wasn’t the real reason for

18

bringing the woman in?

Or rather on the basis that there was an arrest

MR. LOCASCIO:

19

I think at the point in the

20

Supreme Court of Missouri’s opinion, when they’re

21

talking about the evidence, they’re not talking about

22

pretext.

23

woman was legitimately arrested on a parking ticket.

They’re talking 3bout whether or not this

24

Now, they then say --

25

QUESTION;

You can’t put it that way, whether
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

she was legitimately arrested.

2

MR. LOCASCIO:

3

QUESTIONS

Well, whether she was arrested.

She's not legitimately arrested,

4

under their opinion, if -- if -- although she's arrested

5

on the parking ticket, it was pretextual for something

6

else.

7

MR. LOCASCIO:

8

QUESTION:

9

that I read?

The first --

Hqw do you explain that sentence

Assuming an arrest for the parking

10

violation, the arrest in the circumstances of this case

11

was at best a pretext?

12

MR. LOCASCIO;

I explain that by the fact that

13

they reach — they give an opinion about the pretextual

14

nature of this arrest only secondary to the fact that

15

this was an illegal arrest from the beginning, and there

16

was no arrest on a parking ticket.

17

So actually, the finding that this arrest was

18

pretextual is not even necessary.

19

this Court is that it doesn't even have to reach the

20

pretext argument, or the pretext issue, precisely

21

because there was no arrest on a parking ticket.

22
23

QUESTION:

And my argument to

MR. LOCASCIO:

There opinion states —

Could you turn to a page?
Yes, Your Honor, A5 and 6 of

5

states that -- the Supreme Court of Missouri starts, out

6

saying that there was a conflict in evidence —

7

QUESTION;

Where are you?

8

QUESTION;

Bottom of A5.

9

conflicts on

The evidence

whether the officers arrested the defendant

10

on the outstanding parking violation warrant blah-blah,

11

and then they say -- they show what the conflict was,

12

okay?
MR. LOCASCIO;

13

At that point, they analyzed

14

the evidence.

And the next paragraph is that the

15

conflicts raised by the evidence were for the trial

16

court to resolve.
The trial court resolved them in favor of the

17
18

defendant.

Now,

the defendant at the trial court level

19

had two arguments.
Number one, this was an illegal arrest for

20
21

homicide, and that this parking ticket did not even come

22

into play.

23

1

a parking warrant, that detention was the product -- was

2

for the sole reason of investigating a homicie, and not

3

for a parking warrant.

4

And the Supreme Court of Missouri found that

5

any — that any arrest, if you want to assume that an

6

arrest occurred for a parking ticket, was not pursued.

7

And that is — and the reason they say that is

8

precisely because it was not pursued.

9

booked on the parking ticket.

She was not

10

So the detention was solely for homicide.

11

QUESTION:

But is it clear that when the Court

12

says, the conflicts thus raised were for the trial court

13

to resolve, is it clear that they're talking only there

14

about the conflict as to whether the arrest was on the

15

parking ticket or not?

16

Or rather, is the conflict that they're

17

talking about the conflict as to whether it was, or if

18

it wasn't, whether it was pretextual?

19

It seems to me that it was both , because if

20

you read further on in that paragraph, it discusses

21

other Missouri cases that deal with pretext.

22

And it. concludes the paragraph by saying;

23

Such pretextual use to justify an arrest or search has

24

been clearly recognized as violative.

25

And that all is in the same paragraph whose
34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

topic sentence is;

The conflicts thus raised by the

2

evidence were for the trial court to resolve.

I read that as saying, we don’t know whether

4

the arrest was on the parking warrant or not, but even

5

if it was, it was pretextual.

defendant wins.

7

MR. LOS ASCIOi

So either way, this

Well, I think you’re not -- I

8

think, Your Honor, you have to look at what the Supreme

10

they say, specifically, the evidence conflicts on this

arrested the defendant on the outstanding parking

14

The beginning of the next paragraph, the

conflict was raised -- the conflicts thus raised by the

resolved them in favor of defendant.

But let’s assume that I disagree with you on

8

that, and that I think the Supreme Court was saying --

9

the Supreme Court of Missouri was saying that he was

10

arrested on -- she was arrested on the parking warrant,

11

but that was pretextual.

12

Now here’s the kind of -- your next argument

13

is, that’s sufficient reason for invalidating it, even

14

if the arrest was technically on the parking warrant, if

15

the real reason they arrested her was to get this other

evidence on the homicide, that makes the whole thing

HR. LOCASCIO;

MR. LOCASCIO;

That's exactly what this Court

Palm prints are certainly covered by the

20

Fourth Amendment.

MR. LOCASCIO:

Well, see, but that's not the

MR. L0CASCI0;

we’re saying

is that she was subjected to more than just

In fact, she was brought directly to the

commander of the homicide unit.

And what we're saying

8

is that when you try to justify that on the basis that

she failed to pay a parking ticket, and therefore a

municipal judge issued a bench warrant, that that is

11

unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

You

MR. RIEDERER;

Yes, Your Honor, thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice.
Kith respect to the second submission of the

23

respondent, he’s indicated that it would be wrong to

24

take someone into custody for the wrong reason, even if

25

you had a perfectly valid reason to arrest and

And his reason, as stated, is that you do it
for the wrong reason.
The State submits here that what that means is

5

that part of the — that the warrant requirement of the

6

Fourth Amendment is no longer met by having a warrant.

7

You’ve got to have a warrant plus proper and pure

8

motivation .

And it seems to me that that flies in the face

10

of the basic fundamental — the fundamental

11

jurisprudence of the Fourth Amendment.

12

valid warrant, you ouaht to be able to execute the

13

warrant without looking at the reason behind the

14

execution of the warrant.

15

If you have a

Furthermore, all of the things that the

16

respondent has complained about here happened after the

17

respondent was in custody, and after the fingerprints

18

had already been taken.

19

Those fingerprints were not the fruit of an

20

overnight detention, and they were not the fruit of any

21

questioning on the homicide.

22

QUESTION:

Can you tell us quickly why — what

23

you have to support the proposition that the arrest was

24

at least facially on the parking violation?

25

MR. RIEDERER:

Yes, Your Honor.

The arrest

59
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

was at least partially, or facially, on the arrest

2

warrant is borne out by Officer Stewart's testimony

3

where he tstifiei at the hearing, seven different times,

4

both on direct and cross-examination, that he had

5

arrested her on the outstanding parking warrant.

6

In addition to which, the booking record that

7

we have referred to also refers to the warrant as being

8

a reason foe her detention,

9

report, written the same day, also refers to that same

and Officer Thomas' police

10

parking warrant, denominating it by number, as to one of

11

the reasons why she was arrested.

12

So I think the reference if replete with

13

references to this parking warrant at the time of the

14

arrest; not later.

15

QUESTION;

It's not clear that the Supreme

Court of Missouri agreed with that, though, is it?
MR. RIEDERER;

The Supreme Court of Missouri

18

apparently did not agree with that.

19

that a fair reading of that opinion is --

20

QUESTION;

But it seems to me

So that even if we agree with you

21

on the pretextual point, the most we could do is remand

to the Supreme Court of Missouri to have them make clear

how they come out on the other part.
