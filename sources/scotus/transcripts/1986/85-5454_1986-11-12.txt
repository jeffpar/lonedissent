BEHALF OF PETITIONER

VOLINSKY:

and may it please the

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice,

Court:

The Court’s decision in this case, whether it

10

be based on a legal error, a narrow constitutional

11

holding, or a very broad constitutional holding, must be

12

based on an understanding of the sequence of events of

Volinsky,

on your first sentence, if I may.

16

MR. VOLINSKY:

17

QUESTION:

ask you one question, Mr.

Right out of the box.

You say the Court's holding

could

18

be based on a legal error, on a narrow constitutional

19

ground, or on a broad

some non-constitutional ground on which we could reverse

constitutional ground.

Is there

Mississippi here?

VOLINSKY:

That’s in essence what I meant

23

with the legal error.

That ground -- if the Court will

24

recall, the basis that the Mississippi Supreme Court had

25

for finding this error harmless was that the Mississippi

Supreme Court said the trial judge had erred in previous

2

rulings.
The Mississippi Supreme Court also went on to

3
4

find that the trial judge had made his previous

5

Witherspoon rulings based on the trial judge's belief

6

that the jurors weren’t being sincere with him when they

7

said that they had scruples that would prevent their

8

being seated

in the case.

9

In finding that the trial judge didn't believe

10

them and then going on to say, well, they shouldn’t have

11

been excused, the Mississippi Supreme Court

12

misunderstood Witt.

13

be read to mean that jurors should only be excused if

14

they honestly maintain scruples that prevent or

15

substantially impair them.
QUESTION:

16

I think to make sense Witt has to

Well, then if that is your example

17

of legal error, which I believe was one of the things,

18

that itself would be a constitutional ground, wouldn't

it?

20

MR. VOLINSKY;

I don’t want to argue with the

21

Court about whether it should be legal or

22

constitutional.

23

misunderstand Witt in that one respect, and I think

24

without going into a very broad analysis of Davis this

25

Court can say;

I think what Mississippi did is

its conclusion, the clear distinction between the jury

QUESTION;

"Yes."
Well, Mr. Volinsky, I suppose the

trial judge messed up the whole thing, didn’t he?

MR. VOLINSKY:

QUESTION;

I certainly --

What do you think he should have

done at the time this long exchange, which we're all

familiar with, I might say,

concluded?

10

with Mrs. Bounds was

Should he have started all over again,

dismissed the panel and started all over again?

11

That would have been a certain

12

way out of this quagmire.

erred five times previously.

MR. VOLINSKY;

That he had indeed erred

18

previously with respect to the five early jurors.

19

not so sure that that's the case.

20

that way, he could have reversed his earlier rulings and

21

given this defense lawyer a chance to rehabilitate the

22

jurors, which because of the nature of the way this voir

23

dire happened, the defense lawyer never asked the

24

excused jurors any questions.

out of this would have been to throw the whole panel out

2

-- they were all infected with the questioning and

3

attempts to get off the jury — and start anew.

4

QUESTION;

Were you of counsel below?

5

HR. VOLINSKY;

6

All nine members of the Kississippi Supreme

No, I was not.

7

Court found that it was error to excuse Mrs. Bounds for

8

cause.

9

record that Mrs. Bounds was so irrevocably opposed to

To paraphrase Adams, it does not appear in the

10

capital punishment as to frustrate the state's

11

legitimate effort to administer the death penalty.

12
13
14

She at the end very clearly said, I could
reach a verdict ani I could impose the death penalty.
One other thing I

would point out, we do not

15

have in this case the ping-pong effect that Mr. Justice

16

Powell described in Patton.

17

gets up and asks a bunch of leading questions of an

18

unprepared lay juror and smacks her in one direction,

19

and then the defense lawyer does the same thing and

20

smacks her back, and then the judge has to decide which

21

set of leading responses is true.

22

That’s where the prosecutor

Mr. Stegall, the defense lawyer at trial,

23

never asked Mrs. Bounds any questions at all.

24

have the prosecutor asking confusing and sometimes

25

leading questions on the one hand, and then we have the
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

So we

1

trial judge asking open-ended questions that get

2

responses that qualify her to sit.
And at the very end, it's even the prosecutor

3
4

who asks’.

"Can you reach a verdict?"

5

vote for the death penalty?"

"Yes."

"Can you

"Yes."

I think it's pretty clear that Mrs. Bounds was

6
7

erroneously excused.

Having found that, the majority of

8

the Mississippi Supreme Court then went on to its

9

rationale about why the error was harmless.

The

10

rationale used this offsetting penalties approach.

11

is, you erred against the state by denying their

12

motions, therefore it's okay to err against the

13

defense.

That

14

Jurors are certainly not fungible commodities

15

where this kind of tit for tat approach is appropriate.

16

Each juror brings something with him or with her.

17

QUESTION:

Well, that isn't the theory.

It

18

isn't just a tit for tat.

19

prosecution had had another peremptory challenge, the

20

prosecution would have exercised it as to this

21

particular juror, and therefore the excusing of this

22

juror is harmless.

23

MR. VOLINSKYi

The theory was that if the

Number one, I'm not clear that

24

the Mississippi Supreme Court quite spelled it out, but

25

that was my impression, as is yours.

But when I saw the

(202) 628-9300

1

Respondent’s brief, what you’re describing is basically

2

an unused peremptory’s rendering an error harmless.

3

QUESTION!

Right.

4

MR. VOLINSKY;

The Respondent in this case in

5

their brief at 25 seems to distinguish the instant

6

matter from an unused peremptories issue by saying that

7

they would have, if they could.

8
9

QUESTION;

Of course, how do we know that they

would have?

10

MR. VOLINSKY:

11

the unused peremptories argument.

12

consider how voir dire is conducted, you have a trial

13

lawyer who’s focused on a juror, getting at Questions

14

and answers,

15

determine how this juror will fit in with those, as well

16

as individually, trying to figure out what the other

17

side’s going

18

calculate what’s going to happen behind him.

19

I think that’s the problem with
I think when you

trying to determine demeanor , trying to

to do with this juror, and then trying to

I think that, even not doubting a prosecutor’s

20

sincerity, the nature of the situation changes from

21

moment to moment to moment.

22

QUESTION:

You can’t be 100 percent certain,

23

but there can be no doctrine of harmless error, Mr.

24

Volinsky, if you require 100 percent certainty.

25

hard to imagine an error you can say was 100 percent

certain to have been harmless
MR . VOLINSKY:
QUESTION;

I agree.

All you’re saying here is that you

can’t say for sure that the prosecution would have
challenged this juror had the prosecution had one more
left, but gee, doesn’t it seem very, very likely
indeed.

The prosecution is saying this juror is so bad

that she should be excused automatically, and to think
that if he had a peremptory left he wouldn’t have used
it, I find it difficult to believe that that could have
happened on the facts of this case.
QUESTION;
believe otherwise.

Well, I find it difficult to
It seems to me that she was fairly

well rehabilitated, and that there is an element of
distinct speculation as to whether that peremptory, if
it existed, would have been exercised.
MR. VOLINSKY;

I think the nature of her

responses changed dramatically from the very front to
the very end.
QUESTION;

Why was the prosecutor asking to

have some of his peremptories back, then, if he didn’t
intend to use them?

Do you think if the judge had said,

okay, you can have them back, the prosecution would say,
thank you, Your Honor, I don’t intend to use them, I
want to use them on later witnesses -- on later people?

It's inconceivable, isn't it?

that he would have used them there,

MR. VOLINSKY:

You bet, you bet.

The other issue, the other way to look at this

QUESTION:

10

What are you assuming, that he gets

one peremptory back or all five, when you're in this

I don't know how we tell.

refused to excuse these people.

quite believes that.

Mr. Volinsky, if we had a case

MR. VOLINSKY:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF

13

Thank you.

you, Mr. White.

9

12

Thank you, Hr.

MR. WRITE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In this case the Mississippi Supreme Court

15

held that the force and effect of the trial court’s

16

ruling in this case was to correct an error that he had

17

committed in

18

after they had unequivocally stated that they could not

19

vote to impose the death penalty in any circumstance.

20

The court further held —

21

22
23

refusing to dismiss other jurors for cause

QUESTION:

Of course, the trial court never

made a finding to that effect, did he?
MR. WHITE:

I think the trial court said that,

24

in the paragraph where the trial court is talking about

25

that, he said:

I have cheated the state out of this.
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

And I think that is a finding.

It says the court is of

the opinion -- and that’s on page 26 of the joint
appendixi
"The court is of the opinion that it cheated
the state by making him use

— by making the district

attorney use his peremptory

challenges in at least five

instances, and I’m going to allow them in this
particular case."
So I think the trial court is clearly
recognizing his error there, that he has made a mess, as
he said himself, and created this situation that we have
a juror who, he says in his findings of fact, also that
she can’t make up her mind.

He has a totally indecisive

juror.
QUESTION:
opposing counsel:

Then I’ll ask you what I asked your
What should the trial judge have done

in order to clean up this mess that he created?
MR. WHITE:

I think he probably should have

used the word "peremptory" instead of "cause" there, and

I think that's probably what he meant to say.

But he

used the term "cause" and, if you read prior to that, in
a couple of paragraphs prior to that, he got the terms
"peremptory" and "cause" confused there.

And I think

the judge fully meant to use the word "peremptory"
instead of "cause."

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

Well now, it's not just

6

he knew what he was doing, that he knew he was

7

dismissing this juror for cause, rather than giving the

8

prosecutor another peremptory.

MR. WHITE:

10

because he says later;

"I’m not going to

He says, I'm not going to give you

It would have been smarter,

12

perhaps, to give the prosecutor another peremptory, but

he didn't.

14

what he was doing.

15

He excused this juror for cause, and he knew

MR. WHITE:

And I think he was backing off and

excusing her

17

and he was not satisfied that she was in fact

18

rehabilitated and everything else, and was saying there

19

that he was going to excuse for cause.

20

because she was indecisive in her answers

The Mississippi Supreme Court, of course,

21

looking at this situation, decided that this was a case

22

in which they had to step in and define what the trial

23

judge meant or decide what the trial judge meant.

QUESTION;

Mr. White, let me ask you, too,

3

about Mississippi procedures .

4

the jury selection procedure in Mississippi?
MR. WHITE:

5

Is this case typical of

Pretty much typical.

What we do

6

in Mississippi, we put twelve people in the box and then

7

10

can voir dire them and then remove them.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

So in looking at this, there are five jurors

2

in this case that do not equivocate in the least in

3

their opposition to the death penalty.

4

something the defense counsel has skipped over here is

5

when the judge talks about, and he says:

6

And

the judge -

"We’re in a precarious position by making the

7

state use its challenges when we clearly have met the

8

law in about six cases.

9

that just used this to get off the jury, at least one

10
11

Well, I think I had one or two

person that I’m positive of.”
That’s on page 20 of the joint appendix.

So

12

the judge is not saying that all of these people were

13

using this to just get off the jury.

14

one or two, and one that I’m positive of.

15

conclusive that he was removing these jurors just

16

because he was thinkina that they were just using it to

17

get off the jury.

18

He said, I've got
So it is not

What he was doing was trying to insulate this

19

case from Witherspoon error.

20

that if you use a peremptory that there is no question

21

there is no Witherspoon problem.

22

So, because it is clear

And by forcing the state -- when he uses the

23

first one, when he requires the state to use the

24

peremptory on the first challenge, to Mr. Ruiz:

25

would like to use one of our challenges at this time.”
26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

"We

The judge says;

2

cause.

"Well, I’m not going to excuse him for

You’ll have to use one of your challenges."
In one of the others, he just -- "I guess,"

3
4

the judge says, "you’re going to use one cf your

5

peremptories."

6

for cause.

7

He just tells the state when they move

He says no, use a peremptory.
So the state was forced to use peremptories in

8

those five cases.

There are three jurors there that

9

they used peremptories on that are in the joint

10

appendix, and of course those are clearly jurors that

11

that was the proper use of a peremptory, for the use of

12

a peremptory .

13

So we have a trial record, of course, that is

14

very confusing, and this confusion, we submit, is

15

cleared up by the Mississippi Supreme Court in holding

16

the trial court was correct in correcting the errors

17

there from forcing them to use peremptory challenges.

18

QUESTION;

General White, I was just reading

19

over again the colloquy.

It’s really puzzling.

20

when the judge says "Oh, I think there are one or two

21

that just used this to get off of the jury, at least one

22

person that I’m positive of," do you think that's the

23

equivalent of a finding of fact, that there was one of

24

these that was excused that the state had to use a

25

peremptory on that was guilty of perjury?

MR. WHITE:

did have some —
QUESTION:

might have been very happy to get off the jury because

of this, and

8
9

they may have perhaps just emphasized,

MR. WHITE:

And I

don't either.

I don *t know

I mean, I

think that that is one of those situations where you

10

have -- and it happens in every jury — somebody comes

11

in, they've got someone sick in the family, and they

12

just don’t want to serve.

13

And the Mississippi Supreme Court addresses

14

that in its opinion, saying that, you know,

15

busy society and people don't want to take the time out

16

to do this, this duty of serving on a jury, and they

17

think up every excuse in the world to get out.
