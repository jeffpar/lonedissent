1

Turning directly to the legal question at issue* I will

2

first address the characteristics of the navigational

3

servitude and then explain why the servitude is fully

4

applicable in this case.

5

It has been well settled since this Court's

6

historic decision in Gibbons v. Ogden that the commerce

7

clause gives Congress broad power to regulate and

8

improve navigable water for the public benefit.

9

This

10

the needs of interstate commerce* has developed the

11

concept of the navigational servitude.

12

This concept has played a vital role in the

13

commercial unification of the country.

14

servitude expresses a general understanding that the

15

determination whether federal navigation improvements

16

have taken property within the meaning of the Fifth

17

Amendment must take Into account the overarching public

18

interest in free navigation.

19

The navigational

It recognizes the historic fact that navigable

20

waters are especially valuable as a conduit for trade*

21

and that for this purpose they should be treated as

22

public property of the nation* to be used for the common

23

benefit of all of the nation's constituents* and of

24

particular relevance in the present case* the

25

navigational servitude lays down a firm rule that the

12

When the treaties and patent granting the

that the equal footing doctrine would not apply as a

So why shouldn't

Because I think it was clearly

intended as this country grew westward that those

navigable lands be and remain public highways» and I

think that the intent in the grant» the patent to the

Cherokee Nation was that it be a private domain for the
