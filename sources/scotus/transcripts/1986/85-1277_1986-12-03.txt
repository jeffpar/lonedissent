She was removed with

woman poses an unacceptable risk.
She was again suspended with pay.

2

And in the

3

spring, late spring of 1979, the school beard conducted

4

the administrative procedure to commence her dismissal.

5

This procedure was eventually affirmed by the

6

state court, the First District Court of Appeals in

7

Florida .
In

8

1982 she filed her complaint in the

9

District Court in Jacksonville, and a trial was set,

10

alleging for the first time, of course, that she was

11

discriminated against because of her handicap.

12

There was actually two counts in the

13

complaint, but the only count we’re concerned with is

count one.

consider whether she's otherwise qualified.
This goes into our second point.

If she's not

The

burden is clear in a handicap discrimination case, or in

a case under the rehabilitation act.

of all, they’re highly susceptible, and number two, it’s

an enclosed, confined room.
And TB, as

4

First

we know — TB may be unique.

I'm

5

not a medical expert, but we know it's communicated by

breathing, by sneezing, by coughing.
So it's our position on point two that how can

7

8

she be qualified as an elementary school teacher when

9

she can't get down over Johnny's desk and help him with

10

his penmanship and arithmetic without breathing, and

11

thus creating a risk.
But this isn’t our opinion.

12
13

This is an

opinion of a state health professional.
So as a matter of

14

law, we suggest, the record

15

amply supports the trial judge's finding that if it's

16

not a handicap, then she's net otherwise qualified.
QUESTION;

17

Did the school board consider

18

whether she would be qualified to teach in the high

19

school?

20

MR. HAYES;

Yes.

As the testimony of

21

Superintendent Marsh says in this case, that she did not

22

have a certificate.

23

that, Justice Powell.

We

there have been some lower court cases -- but in

referring to the duty to accommodate, the regulations

specifically refer, and I’m

of Federal regulations, 84.4 KL.

And it says;

talking about 45, the code

handicapped person, who with reasonable accommodation

can perform the essential functions of the job in

question.
Now the job in question, we suggest, is an

10
11

elementary school teacher, in an elementary school

12

setting.

13
14

So it’s our position, therefore, that she is
not otherwise qualified for the position.

QUESTION;

16

MR. HftYES:

17

QUESTION;

Mr. Hayes?
Yes, sir, Justice Scalia.
On your point that she is not a

18

handicapped individual, you're not merely arguing that

19

she was discriminated against by reason of her handicap,

20

but you’re also asserting that she is not a handicapped

21

individual.

22

MR. HAYES:

23

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
Yet you say that she has been, by

24

reason of a disability produced by the tuberculosis,

25

hospitalized on several occasions.

MR . HAYES;

MR. KAYES;

22

MR. HAYES;

question there would be whether or not the impairment

related to the contagiousness, or to the disease of

We think that’s a difference.

We — we — as the trial judge -Or else you tell me what else that

impaired.

She was teaching, she was doing fine.

16

MR. HAYES:

17

QUESTION:

That’s correct.
But she had a record of being so

18

debilitated by tuberculosis that she had to be

19

hospitalized .

20

MR. HAYES:

Correct.
Now, what does that language mean

if it doesn’t cover that?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED, ESC.,

12

13
14
15

AS AMICUS CURIA ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FRIED:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The United States is concerned that

16

handicapped persons get the full measure of protection

17

intended for them by Congress in enacting and amending

18

Section 504.

19

There is also concern that Section 504 be kept

20

within manageable bounds.

21

invoked to deal with all manner of social problems which

22

were no in Congress* mind when it enacted that statute.

23

And that means that it not be

In particular, we think it is important that

24

Congress had no intention to displace the web of local,

25

state, and Federal responses to the very different and

(202) 628-9300

the very difficult problem of contagiousness and

2

epidemic.

3

That problem, and

that difficulty, is well

4

illustrated by this case.

5

board, acting at the instance, indeed, at the

6

insistence, of county, state — county and state health

7

authorities, removed from a third grade classroom the

8

respondent, Ms. Arline.

9

In this case, the school

Having complied with these state directives,

10

the school board now faces a suit under Section 504 for

11

handicapped discrimination.

12
13

We maintain that this cannot be what Congress
had in mind when it passed Section 504 and amended it.

14

When Congress amended Section 504 in 1974, it

15

extended the coverage to cover not only persons who are

16

presently handicapped, but persons who have a record of

17

handicap, and also persons who are believed to be

18

handicapped.

19

Further, Congress expanded the definition of

20

handicapped to include any, quotes, impairment which

21

substantially limits one or more major life activities.

22

But in the original enactment,

as well as in

23

the amendment, one feature remained constant: that to

24

come within the statute at all, to count as handicapped'

25

discrimination or exclusion at all, the exclusion must
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

be, quotes, solely by reason of handicap.
And this phrase is what keeps the statute

2
3

within manageable bounds.

This phrase is what keeps it

4

from covering exclusion on all manner of other kinds of

5

grounds, good or bad.

6

And it’s this phrase which demonstrates why

7

respondent’s suit was properly dismissed in the trial

8

court.
QUESTION;

9

Hr.

Fried, what is the handicap of

10

someone who’s diseased?

11

manifestations of the disease, or what?
MR. FRIED;

12

Is it the disease, or is it the

impairment which substantially limits one or more major

15

life activities.
QUESTION;

16
17
18

The handicap is defined as any

activity?

Is employment a major life

Or association with other people?
MR. FRIED;

Those are all major life

19

activities.

20

that if one is excluded, for instance, by reason of

21

contagiousness, from associating with others, then that

22

exclusion constitutes an impairment, when the question

23

you’re asking is, whether the exclusion itself is by

24

reason of handicap.

25

Put it would be to argue in a circle to say

That’s a totally circular argument which lifts

occupation; poverty;

For instance, age;

lifestyle.

Exclusion on the basis of any of these was not

14

intended by Congress to count as exclusion solely by

15

reason of handicap.

16

In this case, nothing could be clearer than

17

that the exclusion which took, place was solely on the

18

basis of contagion.

19

there was any impairment in Ms. Arline whatsoever.

20

The school board did not know that

They had no reason to think that she had --

21

absenteeism; there was no deficiency in her work.

If you had -- if you had removed

there had been no history of tuberculosis , she would

have still had her job, wouldn’t she?

MR. FRIED;

If

Indeed not.

Because, so long as she was contagious — and it's quite

19

clear that it's possible —

QUESTION;

She wouldn't be contagious if she

didn't have tuberculosis.
MR. FRIED;

Ch, yes.

But you can have a

tuberculosis, and if net tuberculosis, with a number of

other diseases, without being in the least bit impaired.

What they're arguing is simply that dismissing

MR. RAHDERT:

Justice Scalia, if I can

presented in the cert petition of the school board;

16

Whether the contagious, infectious disease of

tuberculosis constitutes a handicap within the meaning

18

of Section 504.

contagious diseases were not specifically included, they

are excluded

here.

5

MR. RAHDERT:

6

presented was a per se question.

7

receding at the per se question, and ve are looking at

8

contagiousness, it is our contention that contagiousness

9

goes to the second question presented, which is whether

10
11

The question as originally
If the petitioners are

Mrs. Arline was qualified.
Essentially, the questions framed in this --

12

in this appeal pose first the question of coverage, and

13

second, the question of whether there is a remedy,

14

whether Mrs.

15

Arline is qualified.

We would argue that the contagiousness goes to

16

the second question, is very properly part of the

17

analysis of whether Mrs. Arline is qualified to remain

18

as a teacher in the Nassau County School System, but it

19

doesn’t go to the question of coverage and whether she

20

is excluded.

21

If that first issue has been conceded in oral

22

argument, I think the focus should be on whether she is

23

otherwise qualified.

Arline, can be covered because that --

clarified .

of the second issue, whether she’s also qualified.
Whether her contagion prevents her from being

3
4

qualified, and as the -QUESTION;

5

6

Mr. Rahdert, maybe there's not as

much agreement on the first question as I thought.
The question reads, whether the contagious,

7

8

infectious disease of tuberculosis constitutes a

9

handicap .

10

Now, does that ask whether it always

11

constitutes a handicap, or whether it can ever

12

constitute a handicap?

13

MR. RAHDERT;

I interpret it -- and if you

14

will read the petitioners’ initial brief, the petitioner

15

initially argues that it can never constitute a

16

handicap, because Congress meant to exclude all

17

contagious diseases from the coverage of 504.

18

What has happened is that I think the Justice

19

Department position, their gloss on the rehabilitation

20

act, takes an effect from the cause, contagion caused by

21

tuberculosis; analyzes that in a vacuum, somehow

22

segregated, separated from the underlying impairment,

23

and argues that contagion alone, discrimination against

24

contagion alone, and in their words, whether reasonable

25

or not, constitutes discrimination that is not covered

Federal monies requires seme accommodation of the

decision based on contagion

is not going to be made

abstractly, or isolated from the underlying impairment.

19

As in this case, with any medical analysis of

contagion, assuming that decisions will be made on

21

medical facts, there will be an evaluation of the

medical history of the particular person, part two of

I would draw a distinction between those

Incidentally, pulmonary dysfunction is defined

elsewhere in the Act, for other purposes, as a severe

here.

HR. RAHDERT:

3

The point — I agree with you

4

that impairment has consequences.

In fact, under part

one of the definition, under the statute, the

6

consequences are looked to to define whether it is a

7

covered impairment, whether it substantially affects

major life activities.

thing in the real world as discrimination, whether

reasonable or not, based solely on contagion.

going to be based on -- if it's based on any kind cf a

Justice Marshall,

would be to completely

in your opinion in Choate,

11

you talked -- you analyzed the Tennessee Medicare rules

12

in that case in terms of whether they were facially

13

neutral, or whether they had an exclusionary effect on

14

the handicapped.

15

And you looked to whether they were based on

16

criteria that were a test, judgment or trait — and the

17

Court used the word trait -- of handicapped to determine

18

the propriety of the rules and whether they were

19

violative of the Act.

20

Contagion is exactly the same question.

21

Contagion is a trait of the underlying impairment.

22

we contend that there is no reality in the real world of

someone acting irrationally but parsing it down so

24

finely that it is directed tc contagion in the abstract.

At that time, there was no specific evaluation

of her current condition.

this very sparse record concerning Nrs. Arline and her

contagiousness was that at the time of trial she had

5

been free of contagion for quite some time.

15

The trial was in 1983.

And when was Mrs. Arline discharged

or suspended?
MR. RAHDERT;

At the end of the school year,

1979, I believe.
QUESTION;

Well, dc you think that's terribly

16

relevant that she was found not contagious in 1983 when

the question is whether it was a discriminatory

that in this case, on this record, it appears there was

no consideration of accommodation during the termination

Or doesn’t

I think accommodation primarily

essentially the same question -- refers tc medical

With respect to other jobs, we’re not

18

like a nonhandicapped person would be, for the usual and

routine policies of the school board.

But our point on whether she is otherwise

qualified is that if you look at the standards of this

Court, in fact, which suggest, for example, in Choate, a

We're suggesting that tuberculosis is a
condition that medical science has made great progress

in, and as the AMR has pointed out, 95 percent of the

11

cases of active contagion, pulmonary tuberculosis, can

be rendered ncncontagious within two weeks of proper

That possibility certainly should be explored

(202) 628-9300

methods, those testings, would be established by disease

2

control standards.

The Center for Disease Control, cited in the

them back into work as quickly as possible.

8

That's

That’s Arizona law.

So I would suggest as a practical matter, if

9

the public health standards were followed, and followed

10

consistently, there just simply wouldn't be a floodgate

11

of litigation; that that would be an appropriate means

12

of accommodating an impaired person.

13

We very much endorse a medical determination

14

of Mrs. Arline; a medical determination of all

15

tuberculosis patients.

16

And by extending coverage, and by allowing a

17

remedy under this broad remedial Federal legislation, we

18

would encourage exactly this process of net reacting to

19

public sentiment; not reaction to parents; net reacting

20

to members of the school system personnel, which

21

occurred in this case and is part of the record;

22

evaluating specifically on medical considerations.

Justice O’Connor, it’s not clear

That simply -- that analysis which should be

Moreover, and more importantly, the District

10

Congressional intent,

11

citations were given -- that there was a per se

12

exclusion .

13

which is really not -- to which no

And I think if the Court reads the District

14

Court’s opinion, it will read it to be a very broad

15

exclusion of contagious people from the Act;

16

further assumption that contagious people can never be
