2

materials
The plain language we think is well chosen.

3

The prohibition of disclosure to new people is what is

4

needed tc serve the repeatedly stated traditional

5

purposes of grand jury secrecy:

6

the grand jurors themselves from tampering, to prevent

7

flight, to protect the innocent.

8
9

to shield witnesses and

That’s a list of grand jury purposes that the
Court has stated repeatedly, and none of them, we think,

10

suggests any reason why, when Department attorneys who

11

conducted a attorney investigation are available to

12

bring a civil case, to collect money owed to the United

13

States on account of the same conduct, and they can do

14

so without disclosing matters occurring before the grand

15

jury to any other person, why in that situation the

16

government should nevertheless have to start a civil

17

investigation from scratch.

18

One comment the Court of Appeals made on this

19

was to echo,

20

made in Sells, the concern that civil use of grand jury

21

materials might inhibit witnesses appearing before the

22

grand jury from testifying fully and candidly.

23

want to comment on that.

24
25

but really extend, a point that this Court

And I

It seems to me that that can’t be right in
this context.

In the first place, I find it hard to
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

imagine a grand jury witness who is not inhibited by the

2

threat of criminal prosecution and is not inhibited by

3

the other possibilities for disclosure of his testimony

4

being inhibited by the fact that he may be sued

5

civilly.

6

But if he is, it seems to me that it cannot be

7

the purpose of Rule 6(e) to give such a witness the

8

false impression that if he testifies in a way that

9

suggests he may have some liability, to the United States

10

that won't be followed up and the United States won't

11

attempt to collect.
For example, in this case the Assistant

12

13

Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division

14

received at the end of the grand jury investigation

15

extensive memoranda summarizing the investigation and

16

making recommendations about the future prosecution of

17

the case.

18

He decided on the basis of that memorandum

19

that a criminal prosecution should not be brought, but

20

that the possibility of a civil case should be further

21

explored, and that civil case was ultimately

22

authorized.

23

Unless we are to have -- and I don't think the

24

Respondents are asking for and I see no possible warrant

25

in Rule 6(e)

for — a rule that the grand jury
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

proceedings are to be entirely sealed off and no

2

information from them is ever, even in this sense, to

3

reach anyone who might consider a civil case, in other

4

words unless we're to have a rule that says the

5

Assistant Attorney General who decides whether or not to

6

bring a criminal prosecution may not thereafter decide

7

whether to bring a civil case, there simply- is no

8

realistic possibility of assuring grand jury witnesses

9

that what they say may not be used against them

I

10

civilly.
Now, the Respondents we think would like to go

11
12

beyond the traditional purposes of grand

jury secrecy

13

and to make of Rule 6(e) an exclusionary rule.

14

of the problem, it seems to me, is right there.

15

fide grand jury investigation is not an unconstitutional

16

search, and Rule 6(e) is not an exclusionary rule.

The nub
A bona

Respondents of course object that the grand

17
18

jury investigation may not be bona fide, that allowing

19

grand jury attorneys to review civil — to review grand

20

jury materials during the civil phase may lead to the

21

misuse of the grand jury to gather evidence for civil

22

cases.

23

The Court of Appeals rejected that argument

24

here, finding no reason to think that the attorneys had

25

misused the grand jury in this case and no incentive for
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

misuse in any antitrust case, in view of the division's

2

civil discovery powers.

3

And I can add that I think such misuse is rare

4

or nonexistent.

5

order, a threshold 6(e) proceeding to determine whether

6

the same attorneys can participate at all and can review

7

materials properly in their own possession, is not, I

8

suggest, the way to deal with any such misuse.

9

But in any

event, a threshold 6(e)

Where the attorneys who conducted the grand

10

jury are also conducting civil discovery and trial, the

11

proper moment to deal with a claim that the grand jury

12

gathered evidence that had no bona fide criminal

13

investigative purpose is when the defendant makes such a

14

claim in the civil proceedings.

15

Defense counsel, who frequently will have

16

lived through the grand jury investigation too, will not

17

be slow to claim that the grand jury gathered evidence

18

that was not relevant to a proper criminal charge, and

19

the court, having the same attorneys before it, can

20

immediately inquire into such a claim and, if it proves

21

well founded, impose an appropriate remedy.

22

The alternative implicitly suggested by the

23

Respondents is that the grand jury attorneys should be

24

required to go to court for a threshold 6(e) hearing,

25

which would presumably be ex parte, and seek to
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

demonstrate that the grand jury proceedings were

2

conducted in good faith and did not gather any evidence

3

that was not properly part of a criminal investigation.

4

After demonstrating that, presumably they could review

5

the materials in their own possession.
But that approach, a sort of presumption of

6
7

irregularity, is not called

for by 5(e), is not, we

8

suggest, an efficient way to get at the truth — ex

9

parte hearings to prove a negative rarely are — and

10

will not dispose of the matter, because the defendant

11

will still have the right to make his claim of misuse.

12

Respondents also object --

2

obviously that isn't prohibited from disclosure.

3

MR. COHEN;

Yet

No, and that is not what I meant.

4

Thank you for giving me an opportunity to clarify that.

5

By the workings of the grand jury, I mean the particular

6

activities of the particular grand jury# including what

7

witnesses it heard, what those witnesses testified to,

8

when it met/ what documents it reviewed.

9

3ut the activities of the grand jury as such

10

-- to take an example, a pre-existing document which is

11

subpoenaed by the grand jury does not become immune from

later disclosure merely because it was subpoenaed by the

13

grand jury, unless its later disclosure would disclose

14

something about what the grand jury's activities were.

I'm not sure what you mean by "go

QUESTION;

1

disclosure is not authorized .

2

MR. COHEN;

I don’t think that the fact that a

3

particular contract was subpoenaed by the grand jury

4

makes that contract privileged from future disclosure in

5

circumstances where the disclosure would not reveal what

6

the grand jury's activities were.

7

QUESTION:

Well, what if a witness is

8

subpoenaed before the grand

jury and the witness says;

9

On February 5th I met with Joe Jones.

Can the attorney

10

then go out, the government attorney, and disclose to

11

another person that witness X said on February 5th he

12

met with Joe Jones?
MR. COHEN:

13

No.

On the other hand, the same

14

testimony can be elicited in discovery or in trial in a

15

context in which it does not reveal the workings of a

16

grand jury.

MR. COHEN:

concluded that it did not, the theory being that when

no litigating responsibility but reviewing

The Antitrust Division considered whether it

MR. COHEN:

I think that it raises a special

After the grand jury

investigation was terminated in this case, the Antitrust

11

Division issued proper civil investigative demands under

12

the Antitrust Civil Process Act.

reserved all their rights, but told us, one formally and

two informally, that we already had the documents under

the civil investigative demands.

The Respondents

We believe that we now hold all of the

the Civil Division about

The Court of Appeals vacated that order on the

8

ground that we could not possibly show particularized

9

need because we had the Antitrust Civil Process Act and,

10

although it might be hard to do so, we could duplicate

11

all that testimony.
It said that may be expensive and it may take

12
13

some time, but the Supreme Court has told us in Sells

14

that time and expense can play no part in our analysis.

15

17

iWe think that was just a straightforward and obvious
error .
We accept the proposition that we may not have

18

a 6(e) order solely in order to save time and expense.

19

But that’s quite a different proposition from saying

20

that time and expense drop entirely out of the equation,

21

so that, even in a situation where, as here, the time

and expense are prohibitive in relation to the use that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF

PAUL R . GRAND, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

8

MR. GRAND:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

10

The government has today argued to the Court,

11

as they did in their reply brief, an issue which is not

12

presented in this case.

13

Court granted certiorari is not whether a prosecutor may

14

simply sit in his office and review grand jury materials

15

in the abstract.

16

The question on which this

At issue before this Court is whether the

17

prosecutor who conducted the grand jury investigation

18

may use the grand jury's secret materials to prepare and

19

litigate a civil case without first obtaining a Rule

20

6(e) order.

21

Every time the civil use of grand

jury

22

materials has come before this Court, from Procter 6

23

Gamble through Douglas Oil,

24

Court has limited disclosure in order to preserve grand

25

jury secrecy.

Baggett, and

Sells, this

It has done so because the grand jury's

purposes and functions can only be carried out if the

2

grand jury is,protected by secrecy.
There are affirmative mischiefs, three

3
4

particular affirmative mischiefs, that this Court noted

5

in United States versus Sells, which mischiefs have been

6

previously noted in prior cases, all of which will come

7

to pass in this case, some of which have already come to

8

pass.
For example, unauthorized disclosure of grand

9
10

jury material we say will necessarily occur if a

11

prosecutor is permitted tc use the grand jury’s

12

materials wholesale to bring a civil case.

13

we learned last Friday with

14

Solicitor General to Your Honors, such disclosures have

15

already taken place.

In fact, as

the letter from the

Well after the conclusion of the grand jury

16
17

investigation, grand jury materials were improperly

18

disclosed to attorneys in the Justice Department who had

19

nothing to do with the criminal investigation.

20

kind of improper disclosure, we submit, is inevitable if

21

the determinative question is going to be who you are,

22

rather than the use you are making of the materials.

MR. GRAND;

They are

And if you don’t have a copy, Your

Honor, I’ll be happy to hand you.
Indeed, it was the risk of just this kind of

15

improper disclosure that led the Second Circuit when it

16

ruled in this case to rule that grand jury materials

17

should not be automatically available to a prosecutor

18

for use in civil litigation.

19

The Second Circuit noted that there were

20

additional risks, risks to disclosure to paralegals and

21

to secretaries, to new co-counsel who may come onto the

22

case to assist the prosecutor in the civil phase.

23

And finally, it seems to me no one could

24

seriously argue that the prosecutor’s study of each

But that is not the issue in this

Those are not the facts of this case.
In this case, from the district court through

2

anyone would argue with the

proposition that a complaint that follows a grand jury

Secondly, if what

the rule was only intended

12

to guard against was the disclosure that the grand jury

The matter occurring before the grand

conspiracy took place on a certain date.

MR. GRAND:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

That is correct.
Well, if that’s correct then your

answer to the Chief Justice
MR. GRAND:

was wrong.

I don’t think so.

The only source

8

of that information in the hands of the government is

9

the grand jury.

There could be other sources of that

10

information to the government.

The government had other

11

sources available to it here, for example the ACPA.

12

But — and so that the record should be clear

13

in this court, there has been no attempt on the part of

14

my clients in any way to suppress the facts.

as you like, so long as you don’t disclose that those

facts were presented to the grand jury, isn’t that

correct?

MR. GRAND;

5

I didn't think it was a jump.

6

QUESTION;

It’s a

It’s a question of

who’s making the jump.
MR. GRAND;

8
9

I think it’s that last jump --

Nell, if it is not disclosing

matters occurring before the grand jury to paint with a

10

broad brush, to summarize the facts learned by the grand

11

jury, then it will be equally permissible for the

12

government midway through a grand jury investigation to

13

issue a press release that simply says there was a

14

conspiracy going on, to use your words. Justice Scalia.
Or it would be permissible for a grand juror

15
16

to lean over the fence and tell his neighbor, look what

17

I know .

18

QUESTION;

The only reason that would not be

19

permissible is that, given that manner of disclosure, it

20

is evident that -- it is evident that what is being

21

disclosed is not merely the fact of the conspiracy, but

22

that the grand jury was told about the fact of that

23

conspiracy.

24

It is in essence the disclosure of the fact

25

that it was given to the grand jury that’s the nub of

MR. GRAND:

I suggest to Your Hon or that when

the prosecutor is the person who is disclcs ing the

inference that flows, particularly when all of the

So

I agree with you that the Antitrust

When they're preparing a

11

QUESTION;

Mr. Grand, can I interrupt with,

13

of what is a matter, disclosing a matter occurring

Is the indictment a disclosure within the

However, that is a

2

permitted disclosure because it is part of the attorney

3

for the government’s performance of his duties to

use and disclosure.
I think your question raises another

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

15

MR. COHEN;

16

18

You

Yes, a couple of points, Mr. Chief

Justice.
First, it would, we believe, have been

19

possible to bring and try a civil case in this matter

20

without public disclosure that there had ever been a

21

grand jury investigation of this conduct.

22

notwithstanding the proceedings on the issues that are

23

now before us .

24
25

That's true

There was no disclosure of the subject matter
considered by the grand jury , and it is very possible

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

that no reference to the grand jury need ever have been

2

made .

3

The Respondents made that a little more

4

difficult, because they filed a brief in the Second

5

Circuit which identified the industry and the foreign

6

country involved, but that was the first and only public

7

disclosure of those two facts.

8

would have been possible to avoid any connection between

9

this case and the grand jury at all.

10

And without that, it

Second, the problem -- substantially all of

11

the problems to which Mr. Grand refers are, as was

12

suggested, problems that would arise whenever a

13

prosecutor who has memory of a grand jury is allowed to

14

participate in a civil case.

15

We don’t think the problems are real, but in

16

any event they go to. a point that he neither makes nor

17

could find support for in Rule 6(e), which is the

18

question of disqualification.

19

Conversely, as I said before, they are

20

problems that would not be solved by the kind of

21

threshold 6(e) order that is at issue here, which would

22

not in any event permit such disclosure.

Mr. Cohen, what about disclosure to

secretaries and such?

31 years when the rule referred only to disclosure to

2

attorneys for the government, I think it was assumed

3

that the attorneys for the government would occasionally

4

have to get their memoranda summarizing a grand jury

5

typed, and that the secretary operating under the

6

supervision of the lawyer was an extension of the

3(a)(1) says "an attorney for

13

the government," but 3(a)(2) says "such government

14

personnel as are deemed necesary to assist an attorney

15

for the government in the performance."

16

The rule seems to envision attorneys being

different from those who are necessary to assist the

attorney.

attorney to a secretary.
