MR. COLEMAN;

THE PETITIONERS

Good afternoon, Mr.

Chief

please the Court;

10

The issue here is

would Congress have enacted

11

the remaining provisions of

the Section 43 Employment --

12

Employee Protection Program

in the broad language it did

13

if it had known that the one-house legislative veto

14

provision, exclusively applicable thereto, set forth in

15

the same section, was unconstitutional.

16

First,

the relevant facts.

17

Having made new entry and

18

service possible by

19

competition,

Congress recognized

20

Deregulation

Act of

21

employment.

22

additional air

replacing economic regulation

1978

with

that the Airline

would expand airline

The CAB and now the Department

of

23

Transportation already have

authority to impose labor

24

protective provisions as a condition of government

25

approved private transactions.
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Nevertheless, late in the legislative process.

2

Congress added Section 43 to provide a single integrated

3

employee protection program.

4

The House and Senate had each passed bills

5

providing for government assistance, money paid by the

6

government to airline employees who lost their job

7

because of deregulation.
The House bill, in the traditional form of

8
9

employee protection, conditioned the exercise of

10

authority under the Deregulation Act, for example merger

11

authority, on certification by the Secretary of Labor of

12

protective arrangements similar to those set forth in

13

Section 5(2)(f) of the Interstate Commerce Act.

14

Benefits paid by the airline would be

15

reimbursed by the Government.
The Senate bill involved a completely new

16
17

concept of employee protection.

If an airline went

18

bankrupt or had a 15 percent workforce reduction caused

19

by deregulation, its employees would be entitled to

20

Government financial assistance, and, solely to offset

21

the Government's cost, the right of first hire by other

22

pre-1978 certificated carriers; the same Section

23

authorized the Secretary of

24

to effectuate the existence program and the duty-to-hire

25

progra m.

Labor to issue regulations

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

All regulations were subject to one-house

1

2

veto.

In reaching a compromise, the conference

3

committee deferred several important basic policy-

4

decisions relating to benefit levels and eligibility for

5

assistance in hiring preference.

6

Instead, it directed the Secretary of Labor to

7

adopt, vithin six months of October 24, 1978 — and that

8

date appears in the statute, Your Honor -- all

9

regulations necessary to provide financial benefits and

10
11

hiring preferences.
That delegation was subject to a unigue set of

12

procedural and time restraints that ensured Congress'

13

active involvement in the program's development.

14

Congress reserved ultimate regulatory

15

authority through the right of either House to exercise

16

the legislative veto.

17

Section 43,

nor anywhere else in the

18

Deregulation Act, is there a severability clause.

19

1979, the Secretary of Labor proposed regulations to

20

implement both the financial

21

preference aspects of the program.

In

assistance and the hiring

Final regulations were submitted to Congress

23

on January 18th,

1981, but withdrawn

14 days later,

they were to lay before the Congress.

For several years thereafter, there were no
regulations? there was no employment protection program.
Then on June 23rd,

1983, this Court held

legislative veto provisions unconstitutional.

And they

Fourteen covered airlines challenged the
regulations -QUESTION;

Mr. Coleman, could I interrupt you

10

right there, because it's something I*m not clear about

11

in the statute.

12

During this four or five year period between

13

the enactment of the statute and the finaly — 1983,

14

when they did promulgate regulations, did the statute

15

have any effect at all?

16

MR. COLEMAN;

We don't think it had any effect

17

at all, Your Honor.

But to answer you completely, there

18

is one case in the Southern District of New York where a

19

plaintiff has claimed that the statute does have effect

20

with respect to the right of first hire.

21

QUESTION;

The first hire provision?

22

MR. COLEMAN;

It's not spelled out in the

23

statute, and this raises a question that you get from

24

time to time, where there's a statutory provision which

25

doesn’t say you have a private cause of action? do you?
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And that's on litigation.

2

But other than that, I know of no instances.

3

It's the position of the airlines that the statute has

4

no effect.

5

that the regulations completely change whatever effect

6

the statute --

7

Certainly it's the position of the airlines

QUESTION:

Well, I understand that.

I mean,

8

they spell out — they give lists of employees and

9

things like that, too.

10

MR. COLEMAN:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

But your position is that until the

12

regulations were promulgated, the statute was basically

13

a nullity?

14

MR. COLEMAN:

15

And also, in that connection, I'd like to call

That's our position, Your Honor.

16

your attention in the petition, in the appendix to the

17

petition for cert, which is — which is the record in

18

this case, on page 49, with respect to the regulations,

19

it’s stated that the regulations would issue to

20

effectuate the section which deals with the right of

21

first hire.

22

In other words, that certainly the

23

Administrator thought that he needed these regulations

24

to effectuate the purpose of the statute.

25

QUESTION:

Well, at least to completely
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

effectuate it.

At least it would be arguable.

2

MR. COLEMAN:

3

QUESTION:

It says, effectuate it.

It might be arguable that even

4

without the regulations, there were some employee rights

5

that were —

6

MR. COLEMAN:

7

regulations.

8

to upset.

9

It’s these regulations that we're trying

QUESTION:

10

But not clearly these

Right.

MR. COLEMAN:

And also, since you also have

11

before you the record, I'd like you to look at page 46A,

12

where you see — where the Administrator says, his

13

authority that he’s acting under is Section 43(f), and

14

that’s the section that has the one-house veto in it.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Coleman, do you disagree with

16

the argument that the — that what the legislative veto

17

was mainly directed at, what consisted of the main

18

degree of discretion here, was not the issuance of

19

regulations dealing with the right of first hire, but

20

rather, the regulations dealing with the obtaining of

21

Federal assistance, that that’s what the Congress was

22

worried that the Secretary was going to do something --

23

MR. COLEMAN:

We disagree 100 percent, Your

24

Honor.

25

cites in this book here, you will find that what is

When you read every page that the Government

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1
2
3
4

being described is the employee protection program.
There is one program.

And that program

consisted of both parts.
Another evidence of that fact,

and the

5

Government calls your attention to the Zorinsky

6

amendment, where ha said that he wanted to exclude the

7

financial payment part, but he wanted to have the right

8

to hire part.

9

They don’t tell you that when you look at the

10

amendment you will find that with respect to the right

11

to hire part, ha still had the veto provision.

12

And so we say, it goes to both.

Because when

13

you read tha statuta, when you reread the statute, you

14

will find that it’s impossible to work out the program

15

that's in the regulation without having the regulation.

16

When this was before Judge Gesell, he

17

determined that the legislative veto provision of

18

Section 483 was inextricably bound with the remainder of

19

that Section, ani that Congress would not have enacted

20

the remainder of the Section 43 in its absence.

21

22
23

He therefore declared tha entire Section 43
unconstitutional.

The Court of Appeals reversed.

The language and structure of Section 43, as

24

it emerged from the conference. House conference, Senate

25

conference, showed that the legislative veto was
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

essential in the unigue legislative-executive

2

partnership established in Section 43 to develop a

3

single integrated employment program for protection.

4

Respondents ignore the veto’s importance in

5

the structure of Section 43, relying mainly on the lack

6

of a big floor debate, espousing the virtues of

7

legislative vetoes.
But this Court has said, on many occasions,

8
9

the statute itself is the most important aspect of

10

Congressional intent.

And as Dean Griswold said in that

11

wonderful casebook on tax, don’t think great thoughts

12

about the Internal Revenue Code; read the statute.
And so therefore,

13
14

look at the statute.

15

in the appendix.

I would ask the Court to

It appears beginning on page 38A

The heart is Section 43(f), which provides

16
17

elaborate and detaled constraints on whatever regulatory

18

authority was granted the Secretary, who incidentally,

19

was the head of an agency not otherwise involved in air

20

deregulation or subject to the aviation committee of

21

Congress.

22
23

Look at Section 43.

It contains four

interrelated provisions.

24

QUESTION:

Section 43(f).

25

MR. COLEMAN;

43(f), yes, sir, which is on

page 42A
The regulations to be issued are those, quote,

2
3

necessary for the administration of, and, quote, to

4

carry out Section 43.
All regulations must be promulgated within six

5

6

months after October 24, 1978.

All proposed regulations

7

must be submitted to the aviation committee for 30

8

legislative days.
All final regulations must be submitted to

9
10

Congress for 60 legislative days, during which period

11

either House may disapprove them.
These four interrelated constraints on the

12
13

Secretary’s authority was exclusively applied to Section

14

43 to ensure active Congressional participation in

15

adopting and EPP program by many of the same committee

16

members who drafted the Act.
It is quite significant in establishing the

17
18

tight time restraints, Congress reserved to itself a

19

substantial amount of time for this

20

legislative-executive collaboration.
And that, I call your attention to Section

21

43(f)(4).

23

interrelated constraints, two were added by the

conference committee.

It is also significant that of the four

the controversial Senate EPP proposal.

the compromise, Congress decided to defer certain basic

3

policy questions dealing with the scope of the program.

4

It therefore made the veto substantially more

But in reaching

effective by strengthening the collaborative process; by

retaining ultimate authority over the Secretary’s

regulations,

incidentally, had different viewpoints with respect to

labor protection —

10

QUESTION;

both Houses of Congress, who each had --

Mr. Coleman, I presume all of this

11

goes to formulating the answer which you think we should

12

come to to the proper question.

13

MR. COLEMAN;

14

QUESTION;

15
16

Yes.

Now what is the question we should

ask?
MR. COLEMAN;

The question you should ask is,

17

whether, when you read this statute, would Congress have

18

enacted the statute in the form it did if it did not

19

have the legislative veto?

20

If you conclude that they would not have, then

21

you at that point, you determine that the Section is

22

unconstitutional.

23
24
25

QUESTION;

What if we are in equipoise?

We

can't really figure out either way?
MR. COLEMAN;

Judge -- Mr. Justice, that would
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

be very unfamiliar to almost anybody on this Court to be

2

in equipoise.

3

other.

You all do some down one way or the

But leaving that aside —

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. COLEMAN;

6

QUESTION;

Just imagine.
Pardon?

If we really -- you know, we're

7

very honest, and we say, I really can’t tell what

8

Congress would have done.
MR. COLEMAN;

9
10

And suppose we say that.

Well, you then should say, the

one thing —

11

QUESTION;

Then who wins?

12

MR. COLEMAN;

Does it stay or go?

-- the one thing that's clear,

13

you should say at that point, how can I let them issue

14

regulations which clearly were subject to be rewritten

15

by the Congress, and let those regulations stand.
QUESTION:

16

So you’re saying, unless we can

17

find that they would have adopted it in this form

18

without this provision, we should strike down the whole

19

thing?

20

MR. COLEMAN;

21

QUESTION;

You strike down the whole thing.

And the burden is on those who want

22

to retain the provision without the legislative veto to

23

show that that is --

24
25

MR. COLEMAN;

Yes, that one ought not to be

able to come in and say, I have authority to do
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

something, but tne person who gave me authority also put

2

a restriction on it.

3

still have the authority.

4

5

6

The restriction is bad, but I

And that’s, it seems to me, is the issue that
you have before you.
QUESTIO*?:

Put another way, perhaps, the

7

question is,

8

that authority knowing that he could not restrict it?

9
10

would the principal have given the agent

MR. COLEMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s right, yes, sir.

Of course, this principal could

11

have restricted it any time after the Chadha decision by

12

simply repealing this Section of the Act, couldn’t it?

13
14
15
16

MR. COLEMAN:

It could have restricted it --

well, but that’s a whole new legislative process.
QUESTION:

It requires two Houses of Congress

instead of one.

17

MR. COLEMAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. COLEMAN:

Oh, not only that.

And the President has to —
It also requires the action by

20

the President.

21

to be a two-House overrule.

22

And even if he vetoes it, then there has

And this is completely different here, because

23

it’s clear here that what happened -- and this is very

24

dramatic; I’ve asked you to examine the evidence as to

25

what happened as long as the legislative veto was out
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

there
QUESTION;

2

No,

but my question is directed to

3

the period after the legislative veto was clearly no

4

longer out there.
Did anybody in Congress say, hey, we better

5

6

repeal this provision, because otherwise somebody might

7

go ahead and issue some regulations?
MR. COLEMAN;

8
9

No, nobody -- nobody — nobody

said that, because, frankly, we had a legislative

10

situation which has existed, that on the one hand, the

11

unions wanted much more money.
On the other hand, the airlines felt that the

12
13

program should be limited only to the airline that was

14

the cause of the loss, or at most, only in those

15

instances where the Act caused the unemployment.
When this was before President Carter, and he

16
17

finally submitted a program

18

never moved through the Congress, either way, because

19

the unions thought there should be more money, and the

20

airlines thought the coverage of the regulation was too

21

broad.

22

which had both parts, it

And so nothing happened until after the

23

election, and one day before the change of

24

administration, final regulations were published.

25

Fourteen days later they were withdrawn.
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Thereafter, the new administration published

2

proposed regulations.

3

effect; I mean, at least you haven't declared it

4

unconstitutional yet.

Thlegislative veto is still in

5

The new administration would not send those

6

regulations up to the Hill for the 30-day legislative

7

period.

8

unconstitutional that the legislation — I mean, the

9

regulations were sent up.

10

It was only after the Court declared the veto

And then, because one who wanted to change the

11

situation either way, no longer had the effective power

12

over the executive to bring about those changes.

13

that's the reason why you -- the majority of your in

14

Chadha said that you can't have that separation of

15

power.

16

How,

I'm not going to stand here and agree whether

17

you were right or wrong, because that's already been

18

decided.

19

But once you decide that, I just ask you that

20

if there's been a legislative process, and on the tough

21

issues both sides stood down and said, let's wait for

22

the regulation and we will have this additional activity

23

before they become effective, and then that is

24

destroyed, can you in good concience say that that's

25

what Congress intended.
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Now, this legislative veto is different from

2

those in a lot of other statutes.

This is not a case

3

where you have a broad, big statute, and you have a lot

4

of different provisions for issuing regulations, and

5

then someplace in the statute, there’s a veto provision.

6

In fact, in the Deregulation Act, there are 25

7

regulatory delegations, but only one is subject to the

8

one-house veto, and that’s the one in Section 43, and it

9

applies exclusively to the employee protection program.

10

In fact the conference committee rejected the

11

only other legislative veto provision from the Senate

12

passed bill at the same time it was strengthening this

13

particular provision.

14

Now, as I read the respondents' brief, they

15

concede that the veto was an important Congressional

16

constraint on the financial assistance part of the EPP.

17

But they then search the legislative history in vain to

18

support their argument that the legislative veto was

19

only essential to a check on the financial guidelines.

20

And that’s where they point to Senator -- or

21

Zorinsky, and as I indicated, when he made the

22

amendment, he kept the one-house veto.

23

But I’d like, more to the point, to take you

24

to the language in the structure of Section

43.

25

nothing in there where Congress limits the veto to
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

There’s

1

regulations implementing Section 43(a)(1), which is the

2

financial assistance subsection.

3

Section 43 expressly applies the elaborate

4

legislative oversight provisions to all peculations

5

issued pursuant to Section 43.

6
7

In fact, as I said, the Secretary here claims
that any authority he has comes from Section 43(f).
When you look at the structure of Section 43,

8
9

you realize that the Congress was talking about one

10

program.

11

Section 22 of the Senate bill, from which Section 43

12

emerged.

13

If you have any doubt about that, look at

In that bill, both the hiring preference and

14

the financial payments were triggered by the same 15

15

percent reduction in workforce, or bankruptcy, and in

16

both cases, there was a legislative veto.

17

Then look at Section 43 itself.

On page 38A,

18

the title, Employee Protection Program.

19

definition section.

20

is on page 44A, which is (j), the termination.

21

And look at the

And then look at the section which

section" — and that's both the financial payments and

23

the duty to hire — "terminate on th last day the

24

So it seems to us, Your Honor, that once you

say that the legislative veto is bad, that certainly

they would be.

It is no longer possible to have a committee

those circumstances —
QUESTION:

8

And under

Mr. Coleman, can I ask you one

other question?
MR. COLEMAN;

9

QUESTION;

10

Yes.

How do you respond to Judge Starr's

11

argument that one thing is fairly clear, and that is,

12

that after the Congress compromised — he didn't use

13

these words -- between the union position and the

14

employer position, they at least decided this much, that

15

there should be some form of employee protection.
And if you sustain your position here,

16
17

there'll be no employee protection, which would really

18

give the airlines even greater relief than if they'd won

19

the legislative battle about how much the benefit should

20

be?

21

MR. COLEMAN;

Well, number one, I think when

22

you reread the battle that went on, you realize that

23

most of the certificated airline did not want the

24

deregulation.

25

So you start with a false premise.

No, but -19

MR. COLEMAN;

Now

I really think — I really

19

think it’s unfair for the Government to be here saying

20

that even though Section

22

look at the provision

that they say

that this changed the public should pay for,
going to pay for a penny.

But yet, they have passed

regulations which

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

are far beyond the statute.

But if you just say the

regulations are bad, 1*11 take my chances on the
statute.

Because they cannot get out of the statute

what they got out of the regulation.
Now it just seems to me that under those
circumstances, if -- until -- and as long as that
happened, the process worked.

As long as the Government

was willing to come up and take care of its financial
contribution, the Congressional process was working.
It was only when they split the program -- and
I think we’ve demonstrated that you can't split the
program; it's supposed to be one program.
I think I’ll reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST :

Thank you, Hr.

We’ll hear now from you, Mr. Cohen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS R. COHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
I propose to argue two propositions.

First,

the Court of Appeals chose the proper rule for
determining whether an otherwise valid part of a statute
must be invalidated along with an unconstitutional part.
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And second, in this case, the evidence against

2

throwing the employee protection baby out with the

3

legislative veto bathwater was, as the Court of Appeals

4

said, overwhelming.
The Court of Appeals said it was following the

5
6

rule articulated in Chadha,

7

statute are to be severed, and the balance sustained,

8

unless it is evident that the legislature would not have

9

enacted those provisions which are in its power

10

independently of that which is not.

11

QUESTIONi

12

MR . COHEN i

13

QUESTION;

14

The invalid portions of a

(Inaudible.)
Yes.
That makes a big difference, don’t

you think?
MR. COHEN;

15

But what the Court said in Chadha

16

QUESTION;

17

I mean, there Congress told us what

18

to do; that basically, it wants us to salvage as much as

19

we can .

20

MR. COHEN:

That's correct.

And after stating

21

the test, which the Court had stated in prevous cases,

22

the Court said in Chadha, we need not make that — I

23

think the words were -- elusive inguiry here, because

24

Congress has told us the answer.

25

It is correct that in this case the inguiry

(202) 628-9300

must be made, as the Court of Appeals made it.

But the

2

test, as stated in Chadha, is -- and I believe the

3

parties are in agreement on this — whether it is

4

evident that Congress would

not have enacted the

QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that the

8

task is the same regardless of whether or not there’s a

9

severability clause, Nr. Cohen?

10

M3. COHENj

Yes, I’m suggesting that it is

11

perhaps easier to satisfy the test when there is a

12

severability clause in which Congress has told you what

13

its intent is.

14

whether, based on an assessment of Congressional intent,

15

you conclude that Congress -- that it is evident that

16

Congress would not have enacted the --

17

But the question, in each case, is

QUESTION:

You would factor in the existence

18

of a severability clause, then, as simply -- as weighing

19

evidence of what Congress wanted?

20

MR. COHEN:

21

its intention, yes.

22

QUESTION:

As Congress* direct statement of

Mr. Cohen, do you think there’s a

23

presumption of severability in the absence of a

24

severability clause?

25

MR. COHEN:

Well,

I think that when the Court
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

stated the test as being whether it is evident that

2

Congrss would not have enacted the otherwise valid

3

portion in the absence of the unconstitutional part, it

4

was certainly suggesting a presumption or suggesting

5

that the burden of proof must be on those who would

6

strike down more of the legislation than Congress --

7

than the Constitution requires.

12

QUESTION;

Mr. Cohen, while you 're

interrupted, what is the present status of the monthly
assistance clause?
MR. COHEN;

First, it is dormant, and will

remain dormant unless and until Congress —

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. COHEN;

15

Its status in this case, I think, is this;

Appropriates —
— appropriates funds.
It

16

was not challenged by petitioners in their complaint.

17

The District Court, nevertheless, said that the -- that

18

all of the remaining provisions of Section 43 would have

19

to be invalidated along with the legislative veto.

20

The Court of Appeals reversed, saying the

21

financial assistance provisions are not before us; but

22

saying later in the opinion that all of the remaining

23

provisions are severable.

24
25

So I think the financial assistance provisions
are not — are not before you.

3

5

Do you

MR. COHEN:

think it ever will be made
a word?

I have no reason to believe that

it will.
QUESTION:

Do you also — well, 1*11 ask you:

6

Could we come out with one answer about severability

7

with respect

8

another answer with respect to the hire provision?

9

to the monthly assistance provision and

MR. COHEN:

I think there would be no occasion

10

to reach the first of those questions in this case.

11

I think that it would theoretically be possible for the

12

Court, were both questions before it, to conclude that

13

the financial assistance provision must be invalidated

14

along with the legislative veto.

15
16
17

And that would not invalidate the duty-to-hire
provisions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cohen, I'd like to come back to

18

the difference between statutes that contain a

19

severability clause and those that don't.

20

But

I mean, Congress thinks these things mean

21

something, because they have a regular practice of

22

putting them in sometimes, and not putting them in other

23

times, and they think there's a difference.

24
25

Now, what do you assert that difference is?
thought you said at first that there's no difference at
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I

1

all, but then in response to Justice O'Connor, I thought

2

you said there was a difference.

3

MR. COHEN;

I think that the presence of a

4

severability clause does not change the test; it changes

5

the task of the Court, which is applying the test.

6

It means that the Court has to look at the

7

structure of the statute, and the legislative history,

8

to determine Congressional intent without the guide that

9

the severability clause may provide.

10

QUESTION;

What guide is the — I don't -- you

11

say it, but I don't understand it.

12

severability clause provide?

13

MR. COHEN:

What the Court

What guide does the

said in Chadha

14

was, that the severability clause told the Court that it

15

was Congress* intention that one of the -- that the

16

substantive provision in that case should survive not

17

withstanding

18

the demise of the veto.

QUESTION;

Well, then, that's a different

19

test, I would say.

20

the things can mechanically work without the legislative

22

veto. Congress is telling us, apply it.

from whether — whether Congress would

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I mean, I'm very reluctant to come to a

1

2

decision in this case that's going to, you know, make no

3

difference between this and cases in which there is a

4

severability clause.

5

MR. C3REN;

I think that you can come to a

6

conclusion in this case based on the evidence derived

7

from the structure and the legislative history of this

8

statut e.
I think that even in a case where there is a

9
10

severability clause, there can be an open question as to

11

whether the effect of the invalidation of one provision

12

is to change the rest of the statute into something

13

other than Congress intended and enacted.
And — but I think that if the effect of

14
15

invalidation of one provision is to leave an operative

16

balance of the statute, then the existence of a

17

severability clause, as the Court thought it did in

18

Chadha, pretty much ends the inquiry.
QUESTION;

19

20
21

Hell, may I just pursue that a

moment?
In this case, the question isn't whether there

22

shall be any severability.

23

much you sever.

24

from the rest of the statute.

25

It's — the question is how

Because even Judge Gesell severed 43

And you're saying we should only sever the
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

veto from the rest of the statute.

2

MR. COHEN:

Yes.

It seems to me that one of

3

the reasons why there should be -- I think there are two

4

reasons why there ought to be a presumption in favor of

5

severability, and in favor of saving what the

6

Constitution does not itself invalidate.

7

One of those reasons is that courts have no

8

power to invalidate statutes except the command of the

9

Constitution or the state or inferred intent of

10

Congress .

11

And the best evidence of what Congress wanted

12

is what it wrote.

And the court should not, I suggest,

13

infer a contrary intent unless the evidence supporting

14

the inference is clear.
But second, if a court doesn’t demand a

15

16

convincing shewing before it invalidates a statute --

17

before it invalidates more of a statute than the

18

Constitution requires — there’s no stopping place.

19

some very large horses will be lost over some very small

20

nails.

21

And

In this case, for example, the parties agree

22

that the legislative veto must go.

23

How much more must go with it?

The question is;

24

Petitioners would cut all of Section 43, but

25

that would leave airline deregulation with no employee
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

protection.

And as we and others, particularly the

2

Airlines Pilots Association and the AFL-CIO, demonstrate

3

in the briefs, there is a good deal of evidence that

4

Congress might not have enacted airline deregulation

5

without employee protection.
I think, to get a stopping place, one must

6
7

apply the test as it was formulated in Chadha, and ask,

8

is it evident that Congress would not have enacted a

9

part of the statute that is not in and of itself

10

unconstitutional if it had known —
QUESTION;

11

Mr. Cohen, how does Congress know

12

how we're going to come out on this thing?

I mean, the

13

people in one House don't know what the people in the

14

other House are saying, or will say, if the other House

15

is going to act later.

16

It seems to me there's going to be a constant

17

game of legislative chicken with some lawmakers putting

18

in provisions that are arguably unconstitutional; some

19

legislators may vote for them, thinking they'll be

20

stricken and the rest will stand; and others may vote

21

for them thinking they'll be stricken and the rest will

22

fall.

23

It creates chaos.

Wouldn't be better off to

24

adopt a clear — a clear line that the members of

25

Congress, when they vote on provisions

of dubious

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Constitutiona lity, will know what the result will be if

2

it falls down?

3

And what you're proposing is not a clear line

4

at all.

5

there's a severability clause, the matter will stand, so

6

long as you can mechanically implement, it.

7

there's no severability clause, the entire provision to

8

which the legislative veto,

9

will fall.

10

Now, you could adopt a line that says if

MR. COHEN:

When

for example, is attached,

I don't think that works.

And I

11

don't think it works for two reasons.

12

Congress doesn't always know when it is adopting

13

something that will create Constitutional trouble later

14

on.

15

One, obviously,

But second, the guestion of severability does

16

not and cannot disappear merely because there is a

17

severability clause, as the

18

you the answer to the question which is in fact the

19

question presented in this case, where do you cut?

20

— because it doesn't tell

If you — the debate between the -- between

21

the plurality and Justice Brennan on the question of

22

severability in Regan v. Time, Inc., was a debate about

23

whether the effect of a -- the excision of some words in

24

a statute changed the meaning of the statute.

25

I don't think a severability clause would have

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

resolved that issue.
I think the Court was right when it said in

3

the Jackson case that the presence or absence of a

4

severability clause will rarely determine the issue, and

5

the question is, is the Court going to seek to preserve

6

the balance of what Congress enacted whenever it can.

7

QUESTION;

I have some doubt as to the

8

correctness -- perhaps the Court did say this in Jackson

9

— that the presence or absence of a severability clause

10
11

should never — should seldom make any difference.
That's the best expression we have from

12

Congress addressing to the situation where some part of

13

the statute is held unconstitutional.

14

MB. COHEN:

I think that you have in this

15

case, also from Congress, the adoption of the remaining

16

portion of the statute as an indication of what it

17

wanted done.

18

And, again, the problem of where do you cut is

19

the hard — is the hard problem.

20

doctrine were that in the absence of a severability

21

clause, everything that might be thought to have been

22

part of a package in any Congressman's mind, with the

23

unconstitutinal provision might go, I don't know how you

24

stop short of the work of an entire session of Congress.

25

QUESTION;

9
10
11

MR. CDHEN:

And this Court, of course, has

affirmed the severance of several.
QUESTION:

But at least as to the legislative

12

veto provision, you could say that the entire regulation

13

provision to which the veto is attached falls if there

14

is no severability clause, and it doesn't fall, so long

15

as it can mechanically work, if there is one.

16
17
18

That's guick and easy and clear.

And it

eliminates a lot of litigation.
MR. COHEN;

First of all, even if that were

19

said in this case, the duty-to-hire program would not, I

20

suggest, fall with the legislative veto.

21

And let me turn to that.

The Court of

22

Appeals, I think, was correct when it said that there's

23

ample evidence that the employee protection program was

24

deemed by Congress to be an important aspect of the Act,

25

and not a shred of evidence that the legislative veto
32

5

there were also expectations that deregulation would

beside that,

And

as the Senate report makes clear, the

Yes, and that, by the way, to

answer something that Mr. Coleman said, is also the

12

Secretary’s view of the regulations, say, at page 47A,

nothing in these regulations shall preclude the exercise

And if we are to apply the test of whether it

14

likelihood at all that Congress would have been

15

unwilling to give the Secretary of Labor those

16

assignments if it had known it could not have a

17

legislative veto, the answer is that there is not.

18

Mr. Coleman implies that the statute leaves

gaps to be filled in by regulation.

20

is that there is some question, he says, whether an

21

employee was meant to be protected if his unemployment

Now, while there's nothing in the Secretary's

2

assignment in connection with the duty to hire that

3

there's any reason to think

4

might have wanted to veto, there is an evident reason

5

for the legislative veto, and that is, that the

6

committees did want to have a second look at the levels

7

of assistance that were to be set by the Secretary under

8

the now inoperative financial assistance program.

9

that any Member of Congress

That was the hot issue, and indeed, the only

10

mention of the legislative veto in the committee

11

reports, and one of the two mentions of it in the entire

12

legislative history, appears in the Senate report where

would be determined by regulations promulgated by the

These regulations will be subject

Petitioners response to this is that the duty

18

to hire and the financial assistance were supposed to

19

operate in tandem.

20

that the duty to hire was the primary remedy expected to

21

reduce the financial burden on the Government from the

22

fallback — from the Government's fallback remedy of

23

financial assistance.

24
25

But that is true only in the sense

The statute itself provided for financial
assistance only until the recipient obtains other

There isn’t any reason to assume that someone

3

who wanted to veto the financial assistance would have

4

wanted to veto requiring an airline that was otherwise

5

hiring to give first preference, on whatever conditions

6

the airline prescribes, to displaced employees.

7

And the -- there’s nothing whatever to support

8

petitioners’ suggestion that the continuation of their

9

duty to hire, notwithstanding the dormancy of the

10

financial assistance program, is either unfair to them

11

or contrary to the intent of Congress.

12

Their argument that the Congress would not

13

have enacted the duty to hire if it could not have a

14

legislative veto is based on what the Court of Appeals

15

called circumstantial evidence.

16

They point out that this is the only section

17

in the statute that contains a veto.

18

a veto provision in other sections tells us nothing

19

whatever about whether this veto is an important

20

provision or an unimportant provision.

21

But the absence of

And in this particular case, the presence of

22

the veto is explained by the financial assistance

23

program, which is not before the Court; and the absence

24

of the veto in other sections is explained by the fact

25

that this is primarily a deregulatory statute.

Petitioners argue that two other legislative

oversight features — the six-month provision and the

8

report and wait provision -- show the special importance

9

of this legislative veto.

10

But apart from the fact that these provisions,

11

too, relate primarily to financial assistance — indeed,

12

the six-month requirement for the promulgation of

13

regulations is directly linked to that in the statute —

14

both provisions make it less likely; both the six-month

15

provision and the duty-to-hire provision make it less

likely that Congress,

program.

The six-month provision shows that Congress

20

was sufficiently concerned about labor protection to

21

want to be sure regulations were in place promptly.

22

The report and wait provision gave Congress a

23

valid method of oversight; that is,

24

in Chadha, made the veto even less important.

25

the Court observed

Petitioners suggestion that the legislative

veto was part of a deliberate trade at conference is* I

2

have to say, a figment of their imagination.

3

The statute itself, the conference report, and

4

the postconference debate, contain no evidence that

5

there was any bargaining that related in anyway to the

6

veto .

7

Certainly there is no suggestion that the

8

House, which had a bill providing more protection and

9

much more discretion,

which did not contain a

10

legislative veto, demanded a legislative veto as the

11

price of accepting the Senate bill.

12

In sum, if, as I think you should, you assume

13

that even in the absence of a severability clause, which

14

the Court told Congress would rarely make a difference,

15

if you assume that even in the absence of a severability

16

clause, the Court's job is to see whether there is

17

evidence in the structure and history of the statute

18

that Congress would not have enacted a particular

19

provision if it had known it could not have another

20

provision, the answer as to both the statutory duty

21

under Section 43(d)(1), and the authorization to write

22

regulations that were incidental that duty, would

23

clearly, I think in this case, have been enacted in any

event.

10

that the Secretary's own assignments, the assignments to

I think it’s correct that

didn't expect to veto any regulations with respect to
