THE PETITIONER

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

would invite the Court’s attention to page 51a in the

Appendix to the Supplement to the petition for

certiorari, which depicts the relevant part of that

ranch property in Texas.
The area searched was the area shown at the

top of this chart, where the large barn is.

the house; there’s a fence around the house; there’s a

11

On the night of November 5th, 1580, two law

12

enforcement officers entered the ranch property and

approached this barn.

they did not enter it.

In plain view, within this barn, the officers
saw an amphetamine laboratory in operation.
Without entering any of the buildings on the

4

ranch property, they left and secured a warrant for the

5

seizure of this illegal drug laboratory.

6

In

1932 the Fifth Circuit held that the

7

officers had violated the Fourth Amendment by

8

approaching this barn, because it was within the

9

protected curtilage of the Dunn ranch house.

10

The government petition for certiorari to

11

review that decision.

12

decision was vacated and remanded for further

13

consideration in light of Oliver.

14

Certiorari was granted.

The

On remand, in 1985 , the Court of Appeals found

15

it clear in the Oliver case that this barn was not

Fourth Amendment by peering into it.

The government again petitioned for

20

certiorari# and while our petition was pending# several

21

judges of the Court of Appeals entered dissents from the

22

denial of rehearing en banc.

23

The panel then vacated its 1985 opinion and

24

reinstated its 1982 opinion, holding that the barn was

25

within the protected curtilage.

and

1

immediately adjacent to the home may be protected as

2

curtilage without the necessity for its own use for

3

intimate family activity, because its immediate

4

adjacency to the home makes it part of the area that is

5

protec ted .
Of course, the concept of curtilage came out

6
7

of the English common law of burglary, in which it was a

8

capital offense to enter the curtilage at nighttime with

9

felonious intent.
It

10
11

was not a capital offense to do the same

thing outside the curtilage.
QUESTION:

12

I agree with all of that.

But that

13

makes the test to be distance and not, as you’re

14

asserting it is, whether intimate family activities

15

occur.

16

Because it was acknowledged that a

17

close-to-the-home stable was part of the curtilage.

And

18

there’s no more intimate family activities performed in

19

a stable in Blackstone’s time than there are today.

20

MR. ENGLERT:

That’s true, Your Honor.

21

However, in looking at buildings that are not

22

immediately adjacent to the home, the Courts of Appeals

23

have looked to the use given to a buiding or to an area,

24

and this Court has stated in Oliver, in Dow, in Ciraolo,

25

that the purpose of curtilage is to protect the area of

QUESTION;

Can there be any area around a

building in which there is an expectation of privacy

2

which is also protected?

3
4

5

MR. ENGLERT:

Your Honor, that is precisely

what the curtilage doctrine is designed to do.
QUESTION:

Well, for a commercial structure,

6

for instance, a factory that is constructed cut in a

7

field, and it has security fences all around it.

8
9
10
11

Is there any area within the fence that is an
area in which there would be a reasonable expectation of
privacy, perhaps?
MR. ENGLERT;

Well, Your Honor, there are

12

suggestions in the Dow case, that with the extraordinary

13

security measures that were taken to protect the ground

14

around the buildings in that case, that there would be a

15

legitimate expectation of privacy against ground level

16

inspection.

17
18
19

QUESTION;

Is that a kind of curtilage around

a commercial property, or what is it?
MR. EN3LERT;

Your Honor, I don’t think it

20

would be appropriate to call that a curtilage, because

21

that is not what the curtilage concept is about.

22

The curtilage concept is about home life.

23

QUESTION;

Well, do you acknowledge that there

24

can be an area around a commercial structure which is

25

protected by the Fourth Amendment, by fences?

MR.

Your Honor,

I think -- if

sufficient measures are taken to protect it , I think the

Dow case indicates that there is such an area.

controlling animal movements .

QUESTION:

Mr. Englert, before you go any

15

further, what is

this we have before us?

Is it a

16

question of fact?

17

as’Blackstone would say, or not a distant barn; whether

18

it's within the curtilage or not within the curtilage;

19

isn’t that a question of fact, and wouldn’t we just have

20

to go along with the lower courts, unless what they said

21

was clearly erroneous?

22

MR. ENGLERT:

I mean, whether it’s a distant barn,

Your Honor, if the Court were to

23

hold that it were a question of fact, it should go along

24

with the District Court’s ruling, which did not suppress

25

this evidence, and held that there was not an invasion

of the curtilage
QUESTION;

Well, what do you think, it is?

A

question of fact or not?
MR. ENGLERT;

Your Honor, I think it could

5

properly be termed a mixed question of fact involved,

6

because the question of what is curtilage, of course, is

7

a question of law.

8

there has been some confusion in the lower courts

It's a question of law on which

9

The question of whether a particular property

10

meets that definition would appropriately be treated as

11

a question of fact.

12

3ut in these circumstances —

13

QUESTION;

The question whether a particular

14

structure is a house or not a house,

15

that to be a question of law, when it’s contested

16

whether there were people living in that place, and

17

therefore, whether it was entitled to Fourth Amendment

18

protection, would you consider that a question of --

19

mixed question of law and fact?

20
21

MR. ENGLERT;

would you consider

I think it very well might be,

Your Honor.

22

QUESTION;

Really?

23

MR. ENGLERT;

Yes, it depends on what legal

24

standards ace to be applied to determine whether

25

something is a house, as well as depending on whether
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

those legal standards were met.
We think it would be appropriate for the Court

2
3

in this case to carry on what I may call the unfinished

4

business of Oliver, and to begin to set bright line

5

rules for what is and what is not curtilage.

6

Both the majority and the dissenting opinion

7

in Oliver suggested that-there was a need for bright

8

line rules in this area.

MR. ENGLERT:

QUESTION;

21

Well, would there be a difference

of what’s a curtilage in Maine and what is a curtilage

23

24

MR. ENGLERT;

25

QUESTION;

There could be, Ycur Honor.

I’m thinking of the King Ranch.
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

I

MR. ENGLERT:

3

Ranch, Your Honor.

I’m not familiar with the Xing

But --

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. ENGLERT;

(Inaudible) from Texas?
No.

There may be a difference.

6

And I think it's not so much a difference from state to

7

state, as a difference between urban property and rural

8

property.
The curtilage around a surburban home in

9
10

Springfield, Virginia, where I grew up, and a curtilage

11

around a ranch in Texas may differ.
QUESTION;

12
13

Well, wouldn't your idea of a

curtilage be different from

14

MR. ENGLERT;

15

QUESTION;

me in Harlem, New York?

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, what I’m driving at, this is

16

a local court that has twice said just what they thought

17

a curtilage was.

And you want us to say they're wrong.

MR. ENGLERT:

18

Well, Your Honor, this Court has

19

said three times what it thought a curtilage was, once

20

saying this Court's decision made it clear that this

21

wasn't a curtilage, and then reversing course, and

22

saying without explanation, that it was.
Furthrmore, the District Court, which was more

23
24

local than the Court of Appeals, said this wasn't a

25

curtilage.
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

So I would submit that that's really not

1

2

dispositive of the question.
In addition, the fence rule that we have

3
4

proposed in our brief gives some recognition to the

5

varying nature of a curtilage on different kinds of

6

property.

7

In an area where the homeowner carries on

8

family life in a wider part cf his land, he may be

9

expected to erect a larger fence to set off a larger

10
11

area around his home as the special area.
This fence rule that we propose, cf course,

12

comes straight out of the common law.

13

has referred to Blackstone's commentaries, which

14

distinguish a barn within a common enclosure with the

15

house from a distant barn or stable.

16

Justice Scalia

The common enclosure was critical at the

17

common law, and indeed, the English courts probably went

18

too far even

19

absence of an enclosure meant the absence of a

20

curtilage; holding that a building as few as three or

21

four feet away would not be within the curtilage if it

22

was not within a common enclosure.

23

for our purposes in holding that the

There must be different rules for unfenced

24

property, because our fence rule doesn't dispose of it.

25

But the fence rule, which is the rule at common law, we
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

think is the kind of bright line that could

2

appropriately, consistently with Fourth Amendment

3

values, and consistent with

4

QUESTION;

the common law, be applied.

Well, Mr. Englert, I'm not really

5

sure that your proposed bright line fence rule is one

6

that would serve necessarily our purposes in rural

7

areas, where it's typical, isn't it, that you might have

8

a little fence around your immediate yard to keep the

9

animals out of the flowers and the grass, but still have

10

an outhouse or outbuilding that would be considered a

11

part of the curtilage.
At least in the area where I grew up, that was

12

13

rather typical.

14

is a wise one.

And I'm not sure that your fence rule

ME. ENGLEST:

15

Your Honor, I'm net sure why

16

that outbuilding should be considered a part of the

17

curtilage.

18

allowed to graze, I wonder if that’s an area that is

19

really protected against the kind of trespass, but legal

20

trespass —

21

If it’s the area over which the animals are

QUESTION;

Well, it is to the extent that the

22

outbuildings are, for example, outhouses used for

23

personal purposes or for cooking; the very things you

24

suggest normally are in the curtilage.

25

And there are rural areas where that's still

(202) 628-9300

the case.

So I'm not sure your fence rule would

2

necessarily serve us well in all cases.
HR. ENGLERT ;

3

Well, Your Honor, if the

4

outbuilding is, in fact, used as an adjunct to the

5

domestic economy, we would not urge the fence rule; that

6

is not this case.
This case involves a barn far away from the

7

8

house; not used for domestic purposes —
QUESTION;

9

Well, you're proposing a rule that

10

covers much more than this case.

Justice Q'Ccnnor was

11

asking you about the suggestion in your brief that this

12

case ought to be governed by a

13

first-fence-from-the-hoose rule.

14

HR. ENGLERT;

15

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

And that does cover more than this

16

case.

17

what if you have some outbuildings, including an

18

outhouse, that might well be outside the first fence

19

around the house?
You wouldn't consider that part of the

20

And what Justice O'Connor is asking is, you know,

HR. ENGLERT;

In the exceptional case, where

3

an outbuilding is truly used as an adjunct to the

4

domestic economy, it may be deemed within the

5

curtilage.

6

it may have its own curtilage.

It may, if it’s the equivalent of a house,

MR. DUGAS;

9

There is a sanctity of the home.

But I think that business ventures, business people, and

10

I think in Dow it was stated, that they had a right to

11

privacy within the buildings —
QUESTION:

12

Yes, the cases certainly establish

13

that.

But what you're asking the Court to say is that

14

there's a curtilage doctrine that applies to a business

15

premise the same way it applies to the home premises.
And I'm suggesting to you that I don't think

16
17

that argument is really made out, at least on what

18

you've said so far.
MR. DUGAS:

19

Well,

sir, a business has a right

20

to protect -- they have a right to put a fence up, as

21

counsel for the government has said, to protect their

22

grounds, to provide security .
And perhaps this is a new approach, but a

24

business should be entitled to a curtilage as well as a

home .

revised question, not whether it’s in the curtilage, but

12

whether you can look in the hole in the barn?

MR. DUGAS:

Yes, sir.

But historically fences have served as

privacy, regardless of Oliver.

And this is true,

The fences have served

even in the 1830s, for

travellers who would walk -- there’s an art show on at

that’s critical to your case, to have to overrule Oliver?

MR. DUGAS;

No, sir, I do not.

I do not.

11

Interestingly enough, the government not only

12

looked into the barn, but they looked in the carport,

13

which was adjacent to the house.

Now, if Mr. Dunn had been home, there may have

been a confrontation with them crossing the fence at

night, and there could have been problems.

MR. DUGAS;

There’s one case dealing with the

similarity.

That was a chicken coop that was 125 feet

25

away, which translates into 40 yards.
