It was in this case that they said that there was

And I think that, looking at the lav of

13

Florida at the time,

there can he very little question

15

that the statute was interpreted to restrict the

16

consideration cf mitigating factors to the statute in

17

the same manner as Ohio, for the same reason.
And the restriction of mitigating factors

18
19

violates the most basic Eighth Amendment principle

applicable to capital sentencing enforced by this Court,

First, legally,

the fact that there are

MR. BARNARD;

13

It has to do, Mr. Chief Justice,

14

with what could be considered by the sentencer under the

15

statutory framework.

16

that all evidence of mitigation could be introduced, but

17

it wasn't clear whether it was considered.
In

In Eddinqs, the statute provided

Chio , the Ohio legislature had

liberally

19

interpreted its statute to indicate that evidence not

20

falling within the statute could be considered by the

21

sentencer, but only as it bore upon statutory mitigating

22

factors.

23

So the prevailing

plurality there spoke very

24

clearly that the concern was whether it could be given

25

Isn't that your contention?

5

MR. BARNARD;

QUESTION;

Yes.

Aren't you relying on the statement

7

of the judge that they could only consider the

8

identified mitigating factors?

9

MR. EAR HARD;

10

QUESTION;

That is correct.

So in effect, everything the lawyer

11

had said was washed out by the judge,

had given the jury an instruction to disregard it.

13

your contention is that it didn't get in for any

14

effective purpose?

Yes, because the relevancy under

MR. BARNARD:

to address the issue, because it is

20

central, concerning the non-statutory mitigating facts

21

in this record, because if we address it as a factual

22

matter, as opposed to a legal matter, if a careful

23

reading cf the record actually supports the claim we

24

have made, the lawyer did not present new non-statutory

25

mitigating facts.

his instruction to the jury would be very relevant.
MR. BARNARD:

2
3

Well, of course,

that's net the

situation we have here.

4

QUESTION:

Well, I know it certainly isn't.

5

You do have to get around -- and I think your habeas

6

corpus petition did allege very clearly that the judge

7

himself did not consider any but the statutory

8

mitigating circumstances.
MR. EARNARD;

9
10
11

Yes, under the statutory scheme,

y es .
I think the importance of the jury’s role,

12

however, in Florida

13

the Court didn't decide, tut in dicta in Faldwin

14

Alabama observed that that might be the case, that where

15

deference is given to a jury the constitutional

16

principle --

17

QUESTION:

I think might distinguish that, and
versus

Yes, but in this case is it not

18

clear that we have both the erroneous jury instruction

19

and we also have the judge in his own sentencing order

20

saying that he based bis decision on the statutory

21

circumstance s and that’s it?

22

So whichever approach you take, don’t you have

23

to find that it’s harmless error cr you're get a plain
