We will hear

HR. NURSEY:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

At the time of the offense Chris Burger and

11

his older co-indictee were privates in the United States

12

Army stationed at Ft.

Stewart, Georgia.

13

They were drinking heavily at a club on base,

14

and when they ran out of money, the co-indictee devised

15

a plan where they would rob a cab driver to obtain some

16

more money.

17

The cab was called out to the base, and after

18

riding with the cab driver for awhile, on a prearranged

19

signal, the robbery was accomplished.

20

After the robbery was accomplished, the

21

co-indictee forced the cab driver into the back seat of

22

the cab where he sexually assaulted him,

23

driver was forced by the co-indictee into the trunk of

24

the cab.

and the cab

11

some of the statements that the co-indictee was making.
When the co-indictee during the drive

12

13

suggested that they should kill the cab driver, Chris

14

argued against this and said that they should just

15

release the cab driver and get rid of the cab.
After the -- after the fellow soldier was

16
17

dropped off at the base, they continued riding in the

18

cab for a period of time, and then the co-indictee

19

directed Chris to drive the cab to an area in the woods

20

in rural Wayne Coupnty, Georgia, that both he and Chris

21

were familiar with.
The cab was parked at a pond at -- in the

then the pervasive conflict of interest that existed in

2

this case; and then the burden-shifting jury instruction

3

on malice and intait that was given at the

4

guilt-innocence phase of the trial.

5

The most important consideration in the death

6

sentence which Chris received in this case is that this

7

death sentence is not reliable as society’s reasoned

8

moral response to Chris* individualized background.
Chris was twice tried in Wayne County,

9
10

Georgia.

After the first trial, the Supreme Court of

11

Georgia affirmed the conviction but reversed the death

12

sentence, sending the case back for retrial solely on

13

the issue of sentencing, and he was again sentenced to

14

death.
At both of these trials, the jury had

15
16

absolutely no knowledge of the individualized

17

characteristics of Chris or his background other than

18

the state’s version of the crime for which he was

19

convicted.

20
21

22

They knew only the crime that was committeed;
they did not know the person they were sentencing.
In making what this Court has referred to as

23

the unique, difficult, individualized, subjective

24

decision which the jury must make at sentencing, this

25

difficult decision was rendered impossible by the fact

that they had absolutely no knowledge of the background

2

of the person they were sentencing.

3

There's a wealth of information that a

4

reasonably informed attorney would want to have

5

presented before the jury.

6

information that a reasonably informed attorney would

There's a wealth of

Some of these potential mitigating

10
11

circumstances, which a reasonably informed attorney

12

Chris had absolutely no prior record.

(202) 628-9300

HR . NURSEYi

1

Yes.

He was the offspring of a

2

teenage marriage, and his family — and his parents were

3

divorced when he was very young.

4

Ha spent the rest of his youth being kicked

5

back and forth between two parents who wanted to have

6

nothing to do with him.
His father would not want him to live with

7

8

him.

He'd throw him out of the house, send him to live

9

with his mother, who also wanted to have nothing to do

10

with him.

And as soon as the opportunity arose, she'd

11

kick him out of the house and send him back to live with

12

his natural father.

13

He was physically and psychologically abused

14

by his natural fatner, and when he came back to living

15

with his mother and with a stepfather, this stepfather

16

introduced him to drug abuse and alcohol abuse at the

17

age of 11.

18

He was physically beaten by this stepfather,

19

and his mother was also physically beaten by the

20

stepfa ther.

21

When ha tried to intervene in the beatings

22

that his mother was receiving at the hands of his

23

stepfather, he would be beaten for trying to intervene.

24
25

Chris was then sent back to live with his
natural father.

And because of the physical abuse he

was suffering there, he ran away from home, trying to

2

hitchhike to Florida to li/e with his mother who had

3

moved to Florida.

4

After hitchhiking from Indiana to Florida and

5

arriving in Florida broke at his mother’s home, she told

6

him he wasn’t wanted and threw him out of the house and

7

sent him back again to live with his natural father, who

8

also locked him out of the house.
So for the last few months before his

9
10

enlistment in the \rmy, he was forced to live with a

11

neighbor who took him in because ha had nowhere else to

12

go.

13

Not one word of this individualized background

14

of Chris was heard by either one of the juries that

15

sentenced him to death.

16

Under the — the death penalty scheme in

17

Georgia, only one juror is reguirei to impose a sentence

18

of life imprisonment.

19

by the mitigating evidence in this case, Chris would

20

have received — if one reasonable fact-finder on that

21

jury had been persuaded -- Chris would have received a

22

sentence of life imprisonment.

If one juror had been persuaded

QUESTION;

5

Counsel — counsel, may I ask this

question?

6

MR. NURSEY;

7

QUESTION;

Yes.
How did your client, Sr. Burger,

8

get into the United States Army if his mental capacity

9

was that of a 12-year-old chill?
MR. NURSEY;

10

Justice Powell, at the time that

11

he was enlisted into the Army, this was in the early

12

years of the all-volunteer Army.

13

pretty well known that they were fudging a lot on their

14

enlistment quotas, because of the -- the enlistment

15

quotas they had, they were fudging a lot on the

16

qualifications of the people they ware accepting.

And I think it’s

He was a 10th grade dropout with an IQ of 82.

17
18

I don’t understand how he could have been allowed into

19

the Army.

20
21

22

QUESTION;

Did the jury at the sentencing

hearing know the age of the defendant?
MR. NURSEY;

They knew that he was 17.

They

23

did not know anything about his mental impairment, and

24

they didn’t know that he had an IQ of only 82.

25

QUESTION;

Did counsel argue at that time, or
10

1

has it been argued at anytime since, that it's

2

unconstitutional to impose a death sentence on a minor?
SR. NURSEYi

3

The counsel at trial never made

4

that argument, either at trial or on appeal.

5

post-conviction in this case — the state

6

post-conviction in this case was handled by an attorney

7

who was recruited by a lay person from the ACLU in

8

Georgia.

9

The

This attorney -- the State of Georgia provides

10

absolutely no provision for the appointment of counsel

11

in state post-conviction.

12

This attorney had just passed the Georgia bar

13

exam, and had not even established an office; was

14

basically operating out of his home, and knew nothing of

15

the constitutional jurisprudence before this Court, and

16

did not raise it in state habeas corpus, so it's never

17

been exhausted in this case.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. NURSEYi

20

So it’s never been raised?
No.

It was not exhausted in the

state courts and was not raised.

Now, how would he gotten it on?

He would have

put the mother on?
MR. NURSEY:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

8

I think that's what I can only best refer to as the

9

monster in the closet theory that the attorney used in

10
11

trying this case.
He kept at the Federal evidentiary hearing

12

making vague references to trouble that Christopher

13

Burger had been in, that there was some sort of trouble

14

in his background that would come out before the jury if

15

he attempted to put in this evidence of his background.

16

The only trouble Chris has ever been in is

17

that he was adjudicated a delinquent for the status

18

offense of being a runaway and for being truant at

19

school, which certainly under the facts of his

20

background, is more mitigating than aggravating in the

21

case; far more mitigating.

22

There is nothing in terms of criminal

23

convictions or anything else like that in his background

24

that would have been presented had this evidence put on.

25

QUESTION;

Are we sure about that?
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I mean, is

1

that the only thin? that the lawyer had in mind?

2

mean, might there have been some other testimony that he

3

expected from the mother that we don't know about?

4

MR. NORSEY:

I

There's nothing to indicate

5

that.

And he — tie lawyer testified about the

6

investigation he did for the sentencing phase of trial.

7

And to begin with, he never even contacted

8

Chris' mother.

She had to contact him.

And the only

9

way she found out that her son was charged with murder

10

and was about to face trial in Georgia was that she got

11

a phone call from a relative in Indiana who read about

12

it in an Indianapolis newspaper.
And sie went to Wayne County, Georgia.

13

And

14

this was just three days before the trial was

15

scheduled.

16

trial at that time without ever even spoken to anyone

17

about Chris'

18

The lawyer was perfectly willing to go to

background.

And then when he finally did get around to

19

speaking with her, he testified that he never explained

20

the penalty phase of trial to her, and never told her

21

what type of evidence could be presented in mitigation.

22
23
24
25

He had no way of drawing from her this
information about the background —
QUESTION:

Well, he had talked to Chris about

it for, what, about six hours in all?

volunteered by your client?

5

to know?
MB. NURSEY;

6

Did the lawyer have reason

This is very significant.

He

7

testified that ha spoke with Chris about the penalty

8

phase of trial.
But when he was asked, what did you tell Chris

9
10

about the penalty phase of trial, he said, I told him

11

that we could present evidence of, quote, something good

12

about you.
Now, a lay person

13

would not understand

14

something good about you means that you have an IQ of

15

82, that you’re brain damaged, that you came from this

16

horrible background of child abuse and neglect.
Certainly the average lay person wouldn't

17
18

understand that to mean, something good.

19

of very low mentality coulin’t be expected to understand

20

when he was asked, tell me something good about you,

21

that that meant all of this terrible information that's

22

in Chris' background.

13

background of child abuse and mental defi ciency from

15

But we’ce talking about this ter rible

An important factor of this is that after the

16

original death sentence was reversed by t he Supreme

17

Court of Georgia, the case was remanded f or retrial,

18

solely on the issue of sentencing.

19

And it was remanded in Septembe r, and the case

20

was not retried until July of the followi ng year .

21

the attorney, knowing that all considerat ions of

22

guilt-innocence were gone now, the Suprem e Court of

23

Georgia had affirmed the conviction, and knowing the

24

case was coming back solely on the issue of sentencing,

25

and having nine months to prepare for it, he testified
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

So

1

that during that nine months he conducted no

2

investigation for the sentencing phase of trial; that

3

during that nine months he interviewed no witnesses for

4

the sentencing phase of trial; he testified that he

5

simply opened up his file, reviewed the file, and

6

decided to try the case the same way he had before,

7

which he knew had failed the first time he'd tried it.

8

Exacerbating this problem of the failure of

9

the counsel to conduct any sort of reasonable inquiry

10

for sentencing in this case is the pervasive conflict of

11

interest that existed in this case.

\

The law firm of -- the two-partner law firm,

12
13

the law partner Leaphart and the law partner Smith, were

14

appointed to represent the two co-indictees in the

They were reversed on appeal, and

QUESTION:

8
9

So both for the guilt phase and the

penalty phase, your client came first?

10

HR. NURSEY:

That’s correct.

I think — I

11

think something's very significant about that is that

12

these cases were tried in a

13

rural community in southeast Georgia, Wayne County, a

14

community of slightly over 17,000 persons.

very small tightly-knit

And the attorney testified at the evidentiary

15
16

17

else is doing.

19

there’s no way you could keep a secret.

20

He testified that these cases were well

QUESTION:

Well, you have to rely on that,

21

don’t you?

Because there’s nothing that could have been

22

said, so long as they’re not being tried together,

23

there's no reason why one lawyer wouldn’t put on

24

everything in your client's defense that he had

25

available .
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Because it couldn’t possibly

1

it couldn’t

2

possibly hurt the other defendant; he's not being tried

3

at the same time.

4

Be a totally different jury.

ER . NURSEY:

Theca are two different -- two

5

important factors about that.

The first is that in this

6

small community, an attorney’s integrity and credibility

7

in a small community is extremely important, much more

8

important than, say, an attorney in a large community

9

who can be anonymous before a jury.
Especially by the time of the second set of

10
11

trials, there’s no way that this community wouldn't --

12

couldn’t know that the law partners were representing

13

the two co-indictees, and representing them on exactly

The essence of the defense being lesser

culpability, and that Chris was under the direction and

5

domination of his co-indictee.

6

The important thing that the jury had to

7

decide in making a decision whether the requisite malice

8

and intent existed was not determining whether the

9

intent was formulated by some 30-year-old adult, but

10

whether or not the intent -- the — the requisite intent

11

was formulated by a 17-year-old operating at the thought

12

processes of a 12-year-old.
And this decision about Chris’

13

formulation of

14

intent was taken away from the jury by an instruction

15

that told them that they ace to presume that malice and

intent exists from the natural and probable consequences

of any life-threatening acts which Chris may have

1

First 1*11 address myself to petitioner's

2

claims of a violation of the Sixth Amendment rights, and

3

then I'll address myself to the correctness of the trial

4

court's charge.
In this case petitioner claims that his trial

5

6

counsel labored under a conflict of interest, and that

7

this conflict manifested itself in two respects -- only

8

two respects identified by this petitioner from the

9

record .

10

And that is, the alleged shortcomings of trial

11

counsel in not offering this petitioner’s testimony

12

against his co-indictee in exchange for a sentence less

13

than death; and trial counsel's alleged failure, because

14

of this conflict of interest, not arguing alleged lesser

15

culpability on direct appeal.

16

Dne thing I'd like to make clear to this Court

17

before I proceed further is the respondent's position

18

with reference to this conflict of interest claim.

19

And tie respondent's position is, as found by

20

the District Court — and the District Court in this

21

case was the fact-Einder; the evidentiary development

22

was in that Federal court, not in a state court — the

23

District Court found, under the facts of this case, no

24

joint representation, no conflict of interest, and no

25

adverse affect on counsel's representation.

Now moving directly to those only two respects

1
2

in which this petitioner contends that this conflict

3

manifested itself in adverse effects on counsel’s

4

representation, though counsel here would have you to

5

believe that because of a conflict of interest, Mr.

6

Leaphart did not offer Christopher Burger’s testimony

7

against his co-indictee, the actual facts reveal that

Mr. Leaphart at all times, prior to trial, and in that

interim period of time between the decision on direct

10

appeal which reversed the first death sentence, and the

11

attempted to engage in plea negotiations.

And that trial judge

Leaphart attempted to engage in plea

8

negotiations with 31en Thomas, this district attorney.

9

But the unrefutei testimony in the record -- unrefuted

10

-- is that the district attorney flatly refused to open

11

any avenues for plea negotiations; thus plea

12

negotiations were never engaged in; and Mr. Leaphart

13

never had the opportunity to make any type of offer,

14

one of the things you consider is that in a small

3

death penalty cases cost money,

4

5

you can incline the district attorney to take a plea to

a life sentence.

7

Mr. Leapnart tried to do this in this case.

8

But the district attorney refused to even discuss it.
So the facts in this record reflect that there

was no offer of a plea not because of some conflict of

interest, but because the district attorney opened no

When?
MR. HILL;

5

One day?

That's one date.

Prior to trial,

Your Honor.

Mr.

6

Leaphart retained a psychologist to examine Christopher

7

Burger .

8

This psychologist retained by trial counsel

9

evaluated the defendant and

informed Mr. Leaphart that

10

Mr. Burger had an IQ of 32,

and that Mr. Burger could

11

distinguish right from wrong at the time of the offense;

12

that Mr. Burger was a sociopath; that Mr. Burger, to

13

quote the psychologist's language, was as compelled to

14

do evil as a minister was to do good, that Mr. Burger

15

was prone to hurt people.

16

Mr. Laapnart knew this to be the testimony of

17

the psychologist that he had retained, and this

18

testimony was previewed at the Jackson Denno hearing.

19

And Mr. Leaphart made the decision that that

20

type testimony, though favorable to his client with

21

reference to his 12, was too detrimintal in other

22

respects, especially if the psychologist was going to be

23

subjected to a thorough and

So prior to trial, Mr. Leaphart knew his

2

client’s IQ, as a result o£ his investigation in

3

preparing for trial.

QUESTION:

6

(Inaudible) seven months?

Six

How many months before the trial?
MR. HILL:

Your Honor, I’ll be honest with

7

you, I cannot remember that specifically from the

8

record.

9
10

But I’m sure the record will reflect it.
QUESTION:

That’s perfectly all right.

That's

the only answer I’ve been seeking.

11

MR. HILL:

12

The only other respect in which counsel

Yes, Your Honor.

13

contends, or petitioner contends, that trial counsel

14

representation was adversely affected by this conflict

15

of interest was counsel’s alleged failure, because of

16

the conflict, not to argue lesser culpability on appeal.

17

Now what the record evidence reflects is that

18

Mr. Leaphart testified — keeping in mind that Mr.

19

Leaphart was the attorney who got the original death

20

vacated — he testified at the conclusion of the retrial

21

on sentencing, he perused the transcript and the record,

22

and he raised every meritorious issue on appeal he could

23

identify .

24
25

He specifically testified that while in his
judgment an argument of less culpability under the facts

of this case was palatable when presented to a jury and

2

in the imaginative form in which he did, when the facts

3

actually reflected that his

4

5

lesser culpability to the Georgia Supreme Court.

client was the killer, the

He testified that was his reason for not

6
7

raising that allegation, which relieves this Court of

8

any necessity to speculate as to some conflict of

9

interest.
That testimony is unrefuted in the record.

10
11

What the facts in this case reveal is that this

12

petitioner was afforied an opportunity at the Federal

13

evidentiary hearing to present facts in support of his

14

claims of a conflict of interest.
He has not done that.

15

The facts in this

16

record, nor prevailing constitutional principles, would

17

afford him relief on this claim, and the District Court

18

and the Circuit Court so held.
Secondly, this petitioner contends that trial

19

20

counsel was ineffective for not presenting potentially

21

damaging character evidence on the sentencing phase of

22

trial.

23

Now this is not a case in which trial counsel

24

did not present mitigating evidence.

From the very

25

presentation of the first witness of any substance by
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the prosecution, Mr. Leaphart began developing

2

mitigating evidence on behalf of Christopher Burger.

3

On

cross-examining Mr. Botsford, he brought

4

out the fact that Mr. Burger was 17 years old at the

5

time of the crime, and his co-indictee was 20.

6

cross-examination of the officers who took the

7

confession, he brought out the fact that Christopher

8

Burger stated, in his confession, that Thomas Stevens

9

told him to drive the car in the pond.

On the

10

On cross-examination of Botsford, who was

11

present at all those acts preceding the murder, Mr.

12

Leaphart brought out the fact that Botsford

13

characterized this petitioner’s involvement as following

14

the directions of Thomas Stevens.
So it would be incorrect to characterize this

15
16

case as one in which no mitigating evidence was

17

presented.
What this Court is called upon to do, in this

18
19

situation, is to examine the totality of the

20

circumstances, all those facts as they existed and were

21

known to counsel at the time of trial, to determine

22

whether Mr. Leaphart’s decision not to present that

23

potentially damaging character evidence that was

24

available to him at the time of trial was a reasonable

decision.

Mr. Leaphart testified that after Mr. -- Dr.

past -- Mr. Leaphart discussed in great detail the

petitioner's testimony with

Dr. O'Hare.

Now what is curious, too, is that in his

consultations with Dr. O'Hare, this petitioner told Dr.

O'Hare, and it was the basis for his evaluation and

7

determinations of his IQ, that he had been struck in the

8

head some five times between the ages of nine and 16,

severe blows to the head, and this was the possible

source of his bcain damage;

which was not true because his mother was at trial and

think that opposing counsel’s characterization of the

record is not a fair characterization.

3

Mr. Leapiart testified that he consulted with

4

the mother and with Christopher Burger.

5

that he told Chris -- in response to a question from

counsel for the petitioner -- that mitigating evidence

7

was basically anything — you can put up anythinn in

mitigation under Georgia statute; anything at all.

11

QUESTION:

But did he use the words, "anything

MR. HILL:

He said, anything good about you.

12

But in addition, Mr. Leaphart also testified that he was

13

aware of Christopher Burger’s background, and obviously

14

he acquired this information from questioning of

15

Christopher Burger, the attorney in Indiana, his

16

psychologist, and the mother.

for petitioner makes here today is that he contends that

Mr. Leaphart did not make it clear to the mother what it

that information across to that jury was either to put

Counsel now only belatedly some six years

after trial has been able to find affidavits from seven

people; only seven people.

And while those seven individuals attest to

the troubled background of Christopher Burger, they also

carry with them in their affidavits, which I assume were

to the representations made by counsel here today.

Christopher Burger would be a nice, normal guy, and that

MR. HILL

Your Honor, it is not

it is not

impossible that a jury could conclude that.

3

QUESTION;

(Inaudible.)

4

MR. HILL;

But it is also reasonable for Mr.

5

Leaphart to have decided, if that testimony had been

6

made available to him, which his testimony, unrefuted,

7

was that he did not have it; but if it had been made

8

availble, it would not have been unreasonable for Mr.

9

Leapart to adhere to his original strategy.

10

But in using this belated affidavit testimony,

11

in this analysis, the proper guestion is, whether if you

12

inject this lukewarm but still extremely potentially

13

damaging character evidence, does it render the sentence

14

imposed — does it create a situation where it was

15

reasonably likely that a different sentence would have

16

been reached

17

by this sentencer.

In light of the overwhelming evidence of the

18

sadistic and heinous nature of this crime , then the only

reasonable answer Is now.

QUESTION;

May I ask one other just — did his

In my regaining time, I'd like to address the
trial court's charge on intent.

3

What this petitioner advocates before this

4

Court is that on reviewing a trial court’s charge, a

state trial court's charge for burden-shifting effect,

6

mere identification anywhere in that trial court’s

7

charge of the Franklin language constitutes

8

constitutional error without more.

10

consideration as to how a reasonable juror, hearing this

charge in this sequence, the words actually spoken, in

charge .

14

Now, this charge is different from and

15

constitutionally distinguishable from the charge

16

reviewed in Franklin, which, frankly, it is our

17

contention, is a case that should be limited to its

So this charge does not suffer from the

defects found to exist in the case of Raymond Lee

Franklin.

7

Your Honor, the position of the respondent in

8

this case is that this petitioner, who was afforded

9

ample opportunity in the District Court to make out

10

facts in support of his constitutional claims, never

11

carried his burden.
Under prevailing constitutional principles, he

12
13

is not entitled to Federal habeas corpus relief.
Those conclusions were reached by the District

Court and affirmed by the Circuit Court.

this charge, if burden-shifting, was harmless beyond a

QUESTION:

And you defend that?

5

MR. HILL:

Your Honor, I’ll agree, that these

6

facts -- if this is not a harmless error case. Your

7

Honor, there doesn’t exist one.

8

I agree with that.

But I have to also urge before this Court that

There’s no error at all?

11

MR. HILL:

Yes, that’s right, Your Honor.

And so we ask that this Court affirm the
