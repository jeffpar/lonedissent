ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10'

MR* PALMER*

Mr* Chief Justice» and may it

11

please the Court» this is a statutory habeas corpus case

12

brought by a Texas prisoner serving a 50-year sentence

13

for aggravated robbery*

14

whether the petitioner was required to plead prejudice

15

in order to avoid dismissal of the Sixth Amendment claim

16

by the District Court*

17

The first question presented is

I believe It Is clear under Strickland versus

18

Washington and Hill versus Lockhart that he was required

19

to do so» and I do not intend to dwell on this point*

20

believe the important question for the Court's decision

21

is the propriety of the Fifth Circuit's disposition of

22

the new issues which Petty raised on appeal*

23

I

Petty was tried on his pica of not guilty and

24

convicted in state court in 1979» and his conviction was

The end result is

Central Palmer» what it really

boils down to» isn't It* that you want to be able to
argue effectively that there is an abuse of the writ

10

because even if

they had Just not tahen this

11

disposition» he could still have filed a second habeas

12

petition* but you would have claimed it would be an

13

abuse of the writ if he had?

14

MR. PALMERS

15

QUESTIONS

That Is correct* Your Honor.
But why can't you still argue on

16

remand to the District Court that there is an abuse of

17

the writ here because he should have raised these things

the first tiae around?
MR. PALMERS

1

Me could argue that.

I believe

20

it would be futile.

I can't imagine the District Court

MR. PALMERS

The abuse doctrine goes to

that a claim like this* an insanity claim surely was

point* and perhaps we coutdy but once the Fifth Circuit

2

had sanctioned the amendment it is very difficult to

3

conceive that the District Court would sustain the

4

state's abuse argument*

5

Petty makes several arguments in this Court to

6

uphold the propriety of the Fifth Circuit's dlspositlony

7

the first of which is that the District Court's

dismissal was due to a defect In pleadings and therefore

9

was not on the merits*

that when a matter rises to significantly enough
