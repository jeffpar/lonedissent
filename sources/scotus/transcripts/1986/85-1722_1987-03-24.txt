JUSTICE REHNQUISTS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. HODIANt

Hr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court.
The issue presented here Is the standard of
review of a prison regulation which affects the ability
of some prisoners to participate In a religious practice.
The case is here on a writ of certiorari

to

the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
The regulation at Issue required prison

to remain outside.

any reason* save for medical emergencies.

The District Court upheld the regulation
against Respondent's First Amendment challenge» finding
that it was reasonably related to

legitimate goals of

security and rehabilitation» and that It was not an
exaggerated response to those objectives.
A panel from the Court of Appeals decided the

And* further* they must prove that there Is no

Petitioners submit that the proper analysis to

be applied here

Is the analysis that was applied by this

13

Court in Jones*

Pell versus Procunter and Bell versus

Wolfish! that is* a regulation must be reasonably

MS. HODIANi

We submit that this same analysis

that was applied by this Court In the controlling cases
should apply to free exercise claims as well.

The cases

that I mentioned were all brought pursuant to the First
Amendment* and we do not believe that there should be
any differentiation in terms of a ranking of
constitutional rights* and that the same analysis should
apply to free exercise claims.
