as follows.

were: failure to hold public hearings; failure to comply

2

with protection for park lands; failure to prepare an

3

appropriate environment impact statement.

4

On February 2Cth of 1973, the Court enjoined

construction on the expressway past those three segments

that were then in progress, in construction, until the

compliance was had in full with the statutes that were

alleged to have been violated.

No Title VI issues were raised in the ECCS

And this was in April of 1982.

Mow all the participants, at this time, from

And then in October, after our filing to

11

dissolve the injunction, the respondents, for the first

12

time then, filed a motion with the Middle tistrict Court

asking to be permitted to intervene.

14

And in their proposed complaint, they asked

15

for the same relief essentially that had been filed in

the administrative complaint filed with the federal --

with the United States Department of Transportation;

18

that being that no further construction be permitted,

One cf the things that happened during the

course of this series of meetings was, that we were

getting nowhere on the attorneys* fees matter, but were

able to get down to the crux of the issues, and that

was, what:was test for the Crest Street community.

facts points up the accuracy cf the District Court's

crucial findings of fact.

deference to what the District Court does.

9

And I would like to review

And in this case, the District Court held, in

10

its findings of fact, that the respondents never

11

intervened in ECOS; that only 37 of the 1,261 hours that

12

were spent in dispute resolution process involved

13

preparation of pleadings concerning ECOS, or

14

negotiations toward and review cf the final mitigation

15

plan; and included in the consent judgment that the ECOS

16

injunction prohibited construction pending compliance

17

with laws other than Title VI; that by motion to

18

intervene the respondents sought to enjoin extension cf

19

the highway; and a declaration that the petitioners'

20

practices violated Title VI;

that they obtained neither;

/

21

that the ECOS injunction only prohibited construction

22

pending compliance with laws ether than Title VI;

23

cn to hold that there was no showing that their ECOS fee

24

efforts contributed to the execution of the final

25

mitigation plan; that final settlement seemed imminent

respondents did not show that their efforts in ECOS, in

an action where they never parties, was a catalyst tc

the plan.
Now those are the things that the District

Court found in its crucial findings of fact.

7

those start on page 29 of the Joint Appendix.

Most cf

1988 provides that in any action or proceeding

As emphasized in -- by Congress in its

enactment of 2CC0d-1, and the U.S. Department of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS, ESQ.,

4

FOR TEE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
IN SUPPORT OF THE

5

7

MR. LAZARUS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
Respondent’s claim for attorney’s fees fails,

8
9

PETITIONERS

cn our view, fcr two principal reasons.
First, their claim misapprehends the role cf

10

11

private enforcement in Title VI.

Because cf Title Vi’s

12

inherently consensual basis, Congress fashioned an

13

administrative enforcement scheme for Title VI different

14

than that provided for in ether civil rights laws, such
»

15

as Title VII.
To best achieve the purposes of Title VI,

16
17

Congress chose not to confer upon persons claiming

18

discrimination the status as parties in the .

19

administrative enforcement scheme; and consequently.

20

Section 1988 does not apply to their activities in that

21

setting.

/

The second defect in respondent’s claim is

22
23

that it rests cn an unduly expansion construction of the

24

term "proceeding", as that word is used in Section

25

1988.
18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

They claim that agency investigations and

2

informal negotiations urged on by the federal agency

3

constitute proceedings to enforce Title VI within the

4

meaning of Section 1988.

5

6

We dc not believe that Congress intended such
an expansive meaning for the term.

7

Of the two defects in respondent’s claim, the

8

more troubling to the United States is the first.

9

that is, their misapprehension of the role of private

10

And

enforcement in Title VI.

11

Title Vi’s nondiscrimination mandate is

12

uncompromising , yet simultaneously, it's fragile.

13

depends, therefore, for its ultimate accomplishment, cn

14

the maintenance of a bilateral relationship between the

15

federal agency and the recipient of federal funds.

It

Unless that relationship remains intact, Title

16
17

Vi’s

nondiscrimination mandate is frustrated and

18

becomes meaningless.
(

We believe for this reason Congress

19

20

established an administrative enforcement scheme in

21

Title VI notable in two primary respects;

22

lack of party status for persons claiming

23

discrimination; and second, a heavy dependence on

24

voluntary means of resolving charges of discrimination

25

as reflected in the statutory language, 42 USC 2000d-1,

We think that application of Section 1988

would undermine the Congressional scheme.

Or, even if they were willing to participate,

opening themselves up to liability for attorneys' fees.

the threat of imposition of attorneys' fees might

promote settlement.

13

the chances that the recipient will circumvent, indeed,

14

frustrate Title Vi's mandate by decline of receipt of

But in Title VI, it also increases

Indeed, the absence of attorneys' fees in the

16
17

informal process encourages the recipient to

The balance, we agree, is a difficult one to

19

20

strike.

We believe the language and structure of Title

21

VI, in 602 and 603 of the statute, suggest that Congress

22

intended to err on the side of informality, at least in

23

the initial stages of agency enforcement.

i

24

Congress determined, we believe the language

25

reflects, in contrast to Title VII, tongress determined

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

that a more formal role for respondents, persons

2

claiming discrimination in an administrative setting,

3

would impeded and not further.

4

^

In effect. Congress erected a safe harbour

5

within Title VI to allow for the promotion of voluntary

6

settlement in informal negotiations.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Lazarus, if the parties had not

8

reached total agreement, and litigation had teen

10

available for any portion of the work done in the

11

administrative proceeding under Webb?

would change.

14

becase those activities would not have occurred in a

15

proceeding to enforce.

They might be.

make sure that they have that as a means of getting

2

attorneys' fees, rather than settling these things

3

informally?

4

MR.

lAZARUSi

We don't think so.

Eecause

5

there's no clear incentive to just file a preemptive

6

lawsuit at the outset.
For instance, in this case, if a lawsuit had

7

8

been filed at the outset, at the same time the

9

administrative complaint had teen filed, under our

10

analysis they still would not be entitled to attorneys'

11

fees.

12

Filing a lawsuit changes the analysis, but it

wouldn't change the result.

15

agreement reached.

16

You would still have to

In this case, the catalyst for the agreement

17

reached was the administrative process, and would net

18

have been a lawsuit.

19

So absent an incentive to just gc ahead and

20

file a preemptive lawsuit, because it wouldn't change

21

the result, we don't believe that people wculd

22

necessarily file those lawsuits.

23

would be going against, in certain respects, the best

24

interests of their client, which wculd be to participate

25

MR.

CALHOUN;

It’s the filing of a complaint.

8

Just as the threshold in litigation is, between

9

informally complaining to a party and filing a

10

11

The filing of that complaint triggered a

12

process, and it also triggered legal rights for the

complaint.

Yes.

And the proceeding was, tc

investigate, first of all, and determine whether there

18

19

This wasn't a case where we filed the

20

complaint, and the next day, they turned around and

changed their practices.

to provide attorney’s fees to victims of civil rights

16

Congress as this Court that there is a strong preference

17

for resolution or conciliation.

These points are clear:

The legislative history of 1988 specifically

states that Congress thought that a fee claimant should
