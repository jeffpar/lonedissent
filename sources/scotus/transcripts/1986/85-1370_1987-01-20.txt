BEHALF OF APPELLANT

WILSON;

Mr. Chief Justice and

the Court;

This case is on appeal from

a decision of the

Arkansas Supreme Court which

that the Arkansas sales tax exempts from taxation
There are two exemptions.

First of all, the

3

Arkansas sales tax is imposed generally on sales of

4

tangible personal property.

5

which are particularly apropos.

There are two exemptions

6

One is exemption (f), which exempts all gross

7

receipts or gross proceeds from the sale cf newspapers.

8

The other one is exemption (j), which exempts religious,

9

professional, trade, and sports journals, and/or

10

publications printed and published within the state when

11

sold through regular subscriptions.

12

Now, just from reading exemption ( j) one would

13

think that that might extent to cover all publications

14

printed and published within

15

in fact that's what the chancellor who first heard the

16

case found.

the state of Arkansas, and

17

But the Department of Revenue appealed the

18

case to the Arkansas Supreme Court, and the Arkansas

19

Supreme Court construed exemption (j) extremely

20

narrowly, finding that it only exempted sales of

21

religious, sports, professional, and trade journals.

22

QUESTION;

While we're on the subject of the

23

lower court's holding, I think that I understand the

24

lower courts here to have held that under Arkansas law

25

even the non-subscripticn sales of these sc-called
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

exempt magazines are exempt?

2

MS.

3

QUESTION;

4

WILSON:

That is correct. Your Honor.
It doesn’t turn on whether the sale

is by way of subscription or not?
MS.

5

WILSON;

That's right.

He found that the

6

words "when sold through regular subscriptions" were

7

words of description rather than limitation, and that

8

since Arkansas Times was a publication that was

9

regularly sold through subscriptions that all sales of

10

Arkansas Times Magazine were exempt from taxation.

11

It is our contention that, because newspapers

12

are exempt from taxation and because these other very

13

specific types of publications are exempt from

14

publication, that sales of Arkansas Times should also be

15

exempt from publications or that the other publications

16

should be taxed, that there should not be

17

discrimination .

18

QUESTION;

Well, Ms. Wilson, I guess we don’t

19

even have to look at the newspaper question if we focus

20

on just the particular types of magazines that are

21

exempt.

22

answering that question alone, quite apart from the

23

newspaper exemption question.

24
25

Presumably we could answer this case by

MS.

WILSON;

That is correct if the remedy

were necessarily to be to extend the exemption to sales

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

of Arkansas Times Magazine.

But if the case went back

2

to Arkansas courts and the court found that, rather than

3

extending that exemption, that it would simply delete it

4

and tax all sales of magazines regardless of content,

5

there would still be discrimination between magazines

6

and newspapers.
And it is our contention that any distinctions

7

8

that exist between newspapers and magazines are

9

constitutionally invalid and -QUESTIONi

10

Ms. Wilson, excuse me.

That same

11

thing could happen even if we rested our decision on

12

discrimination between magazines and newspapers.

13

same thing could happen.

14

prevent against that deprivation of relief by resting

15

our decision on the newspaper discrimination, rather

16

than on the magazine discrimination, do ve?
MS.

17
18
19

WILSON:

The

So it seems to me we don't

I'm not sure I understand your

question.
QUESTION;

Well, I’m not sure I understood

20

your answer to Justice O'Connor.

21

why couldn't -- why do we have to reach the newspaper

22

issue so long

23

magazine and other magazines, isn't that enough?

24
25

Justice O'Connor asked

as you're discriminating between this

And you said yes, it would be, sc long as when
it goes back what happens is that the exemption is
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

extended to your magazine, rather than the exemption for

2

other magazines being eliminated, right?

3

MS.

4

QUESTION;

WILSON;

That's right.

So long as —

But that same thing could happen

5

even if we rested our decision on the discrimination

6

between your magazine and newspapers.

7

goes back, likewise when it goes back, unless we say

8

something about it, the court could say, instead of

9

extending the newspaper exemption to your magazine,

10

Likewise, when it

we'll eliminate the newspaper exemption.

11

MS.

12

QUESTION;

WILSON;

That is correct.
Okay.

So that issue has nothing to

13

do with whether we base this decision on the magazine

14

exemption or on the newspaper exemption.

15

MS.

WILSON;

Well,

again, if this Court were

16

to find that the discrimination between newspapers and

17

magazines was unconstitutional and the Arkansas court

18

then found that the remedy was to delete the exemption,

19

the result would be that all publications would be

20

treated the same, whether they be newspapers or

21

magazines or sports journals or whatever, and that would

22

end the discrimination and we’d have a constitutional

23

result at that time.

24
25

QUESTION;

But that wouldn't defeat your right

to a refund, would it?
7

I don't know whether it would or

not.
QUESTION;

You couldn't go back and collect

the tax retroactively from all the others?
MS.

WILSON;

That — yes, I think to bring us

even we would have to get a refund of past taxes.
QUESTION;

So the case isn’t a moot case just

8

because the -- just because the exemption could be

9

eliminated.

10
11

MS. WILSON;

No, not as to the taxes collected

up through the time of the decision, that’s correct.

12

QUESTION;

13

MS.

Yes, all right.

WILSON;

The discrimination obviously in

14

the magazine exemption and also in the newspaper

15

exemption is based almost entirely on content.

16

based entirely on content when the state favors sports

17

journals, religious journals, and so forth.

18

primarily on content

19

QUESTION:

It’s

It’s based

Ms. Wilson, you know, when we think

20

of a discrimination based on content in the freedom of

21

speech area, we think of the

22

or disfavor certain kinds of content.

23

communist propaganda or something like that.

24
25

state as trying to suppress
You know, maybe

Here one would have to assume that the
legislature had it in for your kind of magazine and

1

wanted to somehow discourage its circulation.

2

that just doesn't seem to be a very rational

3

assumption.

4

out to kind of censor or suppress your magazine?

5

And yet,

I mean, do you think the legislature was

MS.

WILSON;

No.

On the contrary,

just the

6

timing of it shows that it's not, because the Arkansas

7

Times didn't even begin publication until seven years

8

after these exemptions were in effect.

9

Nevertheless, it is discriminated against,

10

regardless of the purpose of the legislature and

11

regardless of whether it was trying, deliberately

12

trying, to suppress this kind of speech.

13

the Arkansas Times Magazine where other types of

14

publications are not burdened .

15

QUESTION;

It does burden

Yes, I can understand that

16

argument.

17

content-based discrimination, usually the reason we talk

18

about a content-based discrimination is you infer from

19

that that there was a desire of the legislature to

20

suppress the content that it’s discriminating against.

21

But when you go on and say it’s a

And

I just don’t see that that is a

22

permissible inference here, and I gather you

23

me.

The same thing in Moseley versus City of

13

course, the intent was to suppress everything but the

14

labor picketing.

15

each case was to favor the labor picketing

QUESTION;

Here you think the intention of the

16

legislature is to consciously favor religious,

17

professional trade and sports journals, at the expense

18

of other kinds of journals?

19
20
21

MS. WILSON;

That's what the Arkansas Supreme

Court found when it decided the case, that's correct.
We don't have — I don't know why the

22

legislature wanted to favor those, and the state has not

23

given any reason why those particular types of

24

publications would be favored.

25

QUESTION;

Well, when you look into some of
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

these sales tax laws, I think you have a question in

2

your mind in almost every one of them as to how certain

3

exemptions came to be on the books.

4

there are amendments on the floor of the legislature.

5

You know, maybe

You know, if you subject them to any sort of a

6

strict scrutiny or even a fairly rough rational basis

7

approach, a lot of them probably wouldn't survive.

8

maybe they shouldn't.

9

tax opinions that the scrutiny on equal protection in

Now,

But we have said in seme of our

10

tax cases is the least demanding in any area of the law;

11

that if there's anything to uphold the thing it'll be

12

upheld.
MS. WILSON;

13

Well,

that's certainly true with

14

things which don't -- with taxing statutes which don't

15

involve First Amendment rights.

16

Amendment rights have been implicated, the strict

17

scrutiny standard has been applied, as in the case, the

18

Minneapolis Star case, being the most apropos recent

19

case.

20

But when First

But the Court has not applied the rational

21

basis standard to taxes which implicate fundamental

22

freedoms, such as the right to speech and the press.

23

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Wilson, you argue that

24

the legislature in its sales tax cannot distinguish

25

between magazines and newspapers.

Now, if that

1 1
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

proposition is correct, then

2

that books have to be exempt because magazines are, or

3

that videotapes have to be because magazines are?

4

Theater tickets?

5

How far do we go?

6

MS.

WILSON:

would it mean, for example,

It's possible that the state

7

could assert some interest that would justify a

8

discrimination between videotapes, for example, and

9

newspapers.

I don't know whether it could or not.

QUESTION;

10

11

state interest?

12

MS.

13

A state interest, a compelling

WILSON:

I don't know what kind of

interest the state could show in that type of

discrimination.

I have some doubts as to whether -Well, we’re asking about the legal

18

interest or just a rational basis for the distinction?

19

Does it have to be a compelling state

MS.

WILSON:

I think it depends on the nature

20

of the tax, how general the tax is, you know, the nature

21

of the exemptions, and many other factors.

22

think generally it's the compelling interest.

3

QUESTION:

Well, the Court has traditionally

4

given a great deal of leeway, has it not, to state

5

taxing schemes and to let the state distinguish among

6

objects of tax?

7

MS.

WILSON:

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct,

8

except in the area where it has burdened First Amendment

9

rights.

10

QUESTION:

Well, did Minneapolis Star indicate

11

that a general sales tax would be different, and that we

12

wouldn't have the same concerns?

13

MS.

WILSON:

Minneapolis Star did indicate

14

that a general sales tax could be generally applied to

15

publications,

16

not the case here.

17

items of commerce anyway, and it's certainly not applied

18

generally to publications.

21

as to all other items of commerce.

That's

The tax is not applied generally to

The state picks and chooses between

QUESTION;

Well, do you think that the price

that difference might justify the difference in the tax

from the general sales tax subscriptions tc publications

12

by charitable organizations -- boy scouts, churches,

13

museums, and sc forth?

14

MS.

WILSON;

Could it do that?
That type of publication, it

15

might be able to show that the state had an interest

16

which was strong enough to justify the discrimination.

17
18
19

QUESTION-;

Oh, it needs a compelling state

interest to do that?
MS. WILSON;

Well, yes, I think it does need

20

— either a compelling state interest or to have some

21

ether rights implicated, such as possibly religious, the

22

right to religious freedom or something of that sort?

23

It might be able to present a strong argument.

doesn't pay income taxes, its property isn’t subject to

Assuming that you can say sales of museum magazines or

magazine, you know, published by the Arkansas Museum of

2

Art, that that won't be allowed if you’re trying to

3

become a general purpose publication.

4

But since you think that you can *t even exempt

5

boy scout magazines and museum magazines at all, much

6

less dependent on their content, I guess the second

7

question has no relevance.

8

MS.

WILSON;

No, I really wouldn’t say that.

9

I would say that if you had a truly generally applicable

10

sales tax which exempted a very narrow classification of

11

publications that the state had identified as being

12

particularly in the public interest or of the type that

13

particularly should not be taxed, then I don’t think the

14

same constitutional arguments would apply.
But here we have a situation where nearly all

15
16

periodical publications in Arkansas are exempt from

17

publications, with at the time that this went to trial

18

possibly the single exemption of Arkansas Times

19

Magazin e.

20
21

It seemed to at that time be the only
publication subject to sales tax on any topic.

this Court’s decision in the Minneapolis Star case, I

submit to this Court that this case, Arkansas Writers

10

20

Justice Stevens* question could have been that would

21

seem to indicate that this is not one of those

22

publications that needs the kind of help that the narrow

23

categories do.

24
25

MR. CLARK;

Yes, Your Honor, that would be

correct .

QUESTION:

1

2

How much advertising?

Is that in

the record, how much?
MR.

3

CLARK;

No, Your Honor, it’s not.

General

4

interest magazines of the kind of the Washingtonian, the

5

Arkansas Times, rely in advertising, sale of advertising

6

space, for anywhere from 60 percent up to higher

7

percentages in terms of how they publish profitably.
As I indicated, the Arkansas Times has a

8
9

circulation of 25 to 30,000 in our state, principally

10

among all 75 counties.

11

issue would not sustain the publication as it is

12

presently published and distributed.
QUESTION:

13

But that alone at $1.75 per

Would you just clarify one thing,

14

because I didn't quite follow it.

15

the opposite position and say, well, we are one of these

16

exempt publications and therefore — and you agreed --

17

and therefore we're entitled

18

tax, would they lose the exemption from the advertising

19

tax ?

20

MR.

CLARK:

21

QUESTION;

If they were to take

to be exempt from the sales

No, Your Honor, they would not.
So really, it would be in their

22

interest just to get out of the four -- to get into that

23

category ?

24
25

MR.

CLARK;

Yes, Your Honor.

They would then

be exempt from sales tax on the sale, but they would not

(202) 628-9300

1

lose their exemption from sales tax on the sale of

2

advertising.

3

QUESTION;

So if we have a marginal sports

4

publication, it can get both the advertising exemption

5

and the sales tax exemption?

6

MR.

7

QUESTION;

8

CLARK;

A marginal publication?

Yes, it fits one of the four

categories, sports or religion for example.

9

MR. CLARK;

If it were sport, and determined

10

on these four generic categories, it would be exempt

11

from sales tax on the sale.

12

sales tax on the advertising. Your Honor -- well, excuse

13

me.

14

too, yes.

To get an exemption from

If they sold advertising space, it would get that,
I'm sorry.

15

QUESTION;

16

MR.

17

QUESTION:

CLARK;

It would get both.
The answer is yes.
So the advertising space, if there

18

is discrimination here, the advertising exemption really

19

doesn't have any effect on the discrimination in the

20

sales tax area, if it does exist, because everybody gets

21

the advertising exemption?

22

MR.

CLARK:

Everyone would get that, yes. Your

23

Honor.

24

General Assembly was attempting to make in 1948 was that

25

with these four generic types of classifications there

I think the distinction that the Arkansas

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

might not be advertising revenue that could be

2

generated.

3

QUESTION:

So that

what they should have dene

4

is describe the category they tried to protect as those

5

publications who don't have substantial advertising

6

revenues.

7

a neutral way.
MR.

8

9

That would have accomplished their purpose in

CLARK:

That certainly would have

clarified it some, Your Honor.

I think, the General

10

Assembly may have moved away

11

what is that standard and how do you apply it, what is

12

substantial advertising revenue.
QUESTION:

13

It seems to me that's easier to

14

apply than this four-pronged

15

with.

16

MR.

CLARK;

from that for fear that

standard they came up

If this Court were to decide that

17

the Arkansas statutory scheme of general taxation fails,

18

then 45 states like Arkansas, I submit, are at a loss to

19

impose a constitutionally approved taxing scheme on the

20

sale of any commercial commodities that have any ties to

21

any First Amendment outlet.

22

Therefore, I would

ask this Court to affirm

23

the decision of the Arkansas

24

the alternative, to remand this case back to the

25

Arkansas court, since by virtue of the Appellant's

Supreme Court below or, in

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

stipulation that they are not a newspaper and they’re

2

not one of the four generic types of publications

3

exempted, that they’ve precluded a state determination

4

or consideration as to whether they would fall into one

5

of these categories and they’ve actually precluded the

6

state courts from determining the parameters of those

7

exemptions.

8
9

This Court I believe should not be asked to
decide a major constitutional issue on an incomplete

10

record, and that the better position or decision would

11

be, if this decision cannot be affirmed, would be for

12

this Court to exercise restraint and remand this case

13

for development of the record fully.

14

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF

ANNE OWINGS WILSON, ESQ.,

20

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

21

MS.

22

Attorney General Clark did make reference to a

WILSON:

Yes, if it please the Court.

23

number of facts which are not in the record, and I did

24

want to bring them to your attention.

25

that there are two other publications in the state of

Arkansas that also have paid sales tax.

2

nothing in the record to indicate that and I don’t know

3

where that came from.

4

those could be.
QUESTION;

6

There was

I don’t know which publications

He didn’t volunteer that.

That was

in response to a question.
MS.

7

WILSON:

Yes.

I think, though, that -- I

8

mean, if there are two publications,

I think the

9

situation was that one of them was taxable, admittedly

10

taxable, but it hadn’t had any revenue, so it hadn’t

11

actually paid tax.
The ether I believe was a cockfighting

12

13

magazine, which would have fit under the sports

14

exemption.

15

paid were on sales of cocks and cockfighting

16

paraphernalia and not on the publications.

18

point.

And I really think that the taxes that it

QUESTION;

20

MB. CLARK:

21

But I don’t

Cockfighting?
Cockfighting, yes.

I think that’s

correct.

22

Another fact that he mentioned that's not of

23

the record and I don't know whether it's a fact or not

24

is that 60 percent or more of a publication’s revenue is

25

from advertising.

There certainly is nothing in the
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

record to that effect, and I don’t actually know what

2

the proportion of revenue from advertising versus

3

subscription sales is in this particular case or in the

4

industry generally.

5

QUESTION;

Ms. Wilson, could I ask you about

6

your thesis that the state cannot in its management of

7

its fisc, in either the imposition of taxes or, I

8

suppose it would follow, in its disbursement of state

9

funds, favor one subject over another, like sports or

10

what-not.

11

That's essentially your thesis.

What do you

12

do about, let’s say, the Kennedy Center, which receives

13

federal funds?

14

of speech, right, the dramatic arts?

15

also favoring only particular subjects, namely the

16

subjects of the particular plays and shows that are

17

presented at the Kennedy Center.

18

Now, that is solely subsidizing one form
Presumably it’s

Mow, is that as much a violation of the

19

Constitution as you say granting a tax exemption for

20

sports is?

21

MS. WILSON;

Well,

the Court has made a

22

distinction between subsidies of that sort versus

23

classifications which burden

24

probably the best example of each of those is Began

25

versus Taxation with Representation on the one hand and

types of speech.

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

And

1

on the other hand

2

Court found that the government could not discriminate

3

on the basis of the type of content in allowing

4

publications to publish pictures of dollar bills in that

5

case.

6

And

Regan versus Time, Inc., where the

in Regan versus Taxation with

7

Representation, where organizations which engaged in

8

lobbying were denied 501(c)(3) exemptions, the Court in

9

that case found that that type of benefit was not

10

subject to a compelling state interest, but rather to a

11

rational basis, and that the government could provide

12

subsidies for the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian

13

Institute, things of that sort.

14

QUESTION;

Well, why is this different?

Could

15

Arkansas provide a subsidy to have a sporting show in

16

Little Pock?

17

MS.

WILSON;

18

QUESTION;

Yes, I think it could, yes.
At which there would be, you know,

19

speeches and all the communication that goes with that.

20

It's essentially a communicative activity.

21

MS. WILSON;

22

QUESTION;

Certainly.
Well, why can't it foster the sales

23

of sporting magazines then, if it wants, so long as it's

24

not trying to stamp out your

25

MS.

WILSON;

magazine?

Well, it probably dees subsidize
42

(202) 628-9300

1

the Razorback magazine or something like that# in that

2

there is probably a sports publication at the University

3

of Arkansas which is subsidized by the state.

4

The state subsidizes student newspapers and

5

things of that sort.

6

that, and that's certainly very different from something

7

which burdens people, you know, that are similarly

8

situated, people in the same marketplace.

9

It’s a very common thing to do

QUESTION;

But they're not burdening anybody.

10

They're just granting them an exemption.

11

would be okay if they taxed all of them and then gave

12

money only to sports publications?

13

right ?

14

You mean it

That would be ail

But the vice here is, instead of collecting

15

the tax from anybody and then handing over some of it to

16

sports publications and the other ones that they

17

mention, they simply short-circuited it and they said,

18

instead of, you know, having it come back in and out,

19

just don't pay the tax?

That's what's wrong?

20

But they could have done the same thing had

21

they imposed the tax generally and then distributed a

22

subsidy?

23

MS.

WILSON;

Well,

I think a systematic

24

program of the government where it systematically

25

favored publications that espoused a particular point of
43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

view and then denied the same benefits

QUESTION:

9

Not a particular point of view, a
sports,

I don't know, politics.

Isn't that content

WILSON:

Well, again, it's an enhancement

rather than a burden on some elements of speech.

It’s

10

really just -- it's just a different classification of

11

-- you know, there's kind of two lines of cases, and one

12

is where the government is allowed to enhance, you know,

13

something like the Smithsonian or the veterans

14

organizations in Regan versus Taxation with

15

Representation: and on the other where it burdens one

16

element of the press versus another, as in Minneapolis,

17

as in the Minneapolis Star case.

18

This really falls clearly into the areas where

19

the government has sought to distinguish, to burden, one

20

speaker and allow another not to be burdened.

21

It's a general tax.

WILSON:

It’s a general tax.

What they

Well, of course, the benefits

(202) 628-9300

1

that they’ve granted are such that I still assert one

2

publication is singled out for taxation, where every

3

other publication is exempt from taxation.

4

One thing I wanted to mention that’s just an

5

example of how, well, really irrational these

6

classifications are is again, you know, who decides what

7

a trade publication is?

8

does, some official with the department of finance and

9

administration .

10

I guess the state of Arkansas

18

category, Arkansas Times publishes plenty of articles

19

about sports; it publishes religious articles.

20

it doesn’t publish enough religious articles, the state

21

wouldn’t classify it as a religious publication.

22

QUESTION;

Because

But you don’t really know that, do

23

you?

You don’t know whether, if you submitted those

24

arguments to the state, whether you might be able to get

25

an exemption?

Or did you make that argument to the

We stipulated with the state that it was not any­

And

7

I might add in that regard, the state now

wishes the case remanded for development of further

9

facts.

That was a joint stipulation that was agreed

10

to.

Both sides felt that all the facts that were

11

necessary for the court to decide the case were in the

12

record.
And

13

the facts as they are in the record do

14

clearly show that the state had no interest and no

15

justification in making the distinctions that it’s made

16

in taxing publications.

If there are no further questions.
