Now, before getting to the facts I’d like to

16

try and summarize the three

17

in this argument;

18

of the

First,

the

points that we hope

to make

state is not seeking to prohibit

19

all mining by Granite Rock,

nor does

the state claim the

20

authority to be able

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that given federally authorized use.

2

And while these environmental controls happen

3

to be included in the Coastal Act, they’re no different

4

than environmental and reclamation controls that many

5

other western states have been routinely applying to

6

private mining on federal lands over the years.

7

Secondly,

the test for preemption in this case

8

is not whether the state’s environmental regulation

9

duplicates that of the Forest Service.

There are many

10

areas where federal regulation is not intended to be

11

exclusive and where duplicative state regulation not

12

only doesn’t conflict with federal regulation, but

13

actually furthers federal regulatory objectives.

14

believe that this is one of

15

The Ninth Circuit

We

those cases.
we believe applied an

16

erroneous preemption rule because it essentially

17

concluded that the state’s regulation inherently

18

undermined the Forest Service’s authority simply because

19

the state’s regulation duplicated the Forest Service

20

r egulation.

21

Finally, the third point, to us it appears as

22

if the relevant guestion under the Coastal Zone

23

Management Act is not whether the lands Granite Rock is

24

mining fall within the definition of excluded federal

25

lands within the meaning of

16 U.S.C. Section 14531.
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Rather, to us the relevant question is in excluding

2

federal lands from the coastal zone for purposes of the

3

coastal zone management program did Congress intend to

4

preempt the police power authority that states otherwise

5

have over private activities on excluded federal lands,

6

and which states can enforce apart from the CZMA program

7

under their policy power.

8
9
10

QUESTION;

Is this being done apart from the

CZMA program?
MR. MASOUREDIS;

Yes, it is. The Coastal Act

11

is an independent police power statute.

12

Ninth Circuit found that.

13

and the state was enforcing

it long before the coastal

14

zone management program was

approved.

15

I think; the

The Act was enacted in 1976

And even if the state for some reason pulls

16

out of the coastal zone management program or if the

17

federal government terminates our authorization,

18

state will continue to enforce the Coastal Act.

19

QUESTION;

the

Well, it may not be the same

20

program, but it is certainly the same sort of coastal

21

zone management scheme, as opposed to a separate

22

environmental statute dealing with one or another type

23

of environmental damage.

24
25

HR. MASOUREDIS;

Well, I think again that

Public Resources Code 30,008 indicates that the state
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

will apply the environmental controls of the Coastal Act

2

to excluded federal lands.

3

is something that the state devises on its own.

4

include whatever statutes that it wants in the coastal

5

zone management program.

6

criteria, the federal government will approve it.

And a coastal zone program
It can

If those meet the federal

But the statutes themselves aren't enforced

7

8

solely through the coastal zone management program.

9

They had an independent existence to begin with.

That's

10

how they got included in the management program.

They

11

had to be enacted as police power statutes initially,

12

and those statutes can be enforced wholly independent of

13

the coastal zone management program.
It's a voluntary program.

14

States aren't

15

required to join up, and the statutes that they include

16

in the program don't have to be enforced solely through

17

the management program.
QUESTIONt

18

But if the states can do the same

19

thing by a coastal zone, a state coastal zone management

20

program that is not part of the federal proaram, what

21

possible purpose does the exclusion of the federal lands

22

from the federal coastal zone management program

23

achieve?

24
25

MB. «ASOUREDIS:

As we see it, the CZMA adds

to the state's police power.

It doesn't detract and
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

limit it.

And the purpose of 14531 was a Congressional

2

judgment not to delegate to states the authority to

3

define permissible and prohibited uses of federal

4

lands.
The CZMA itself tells a state that it must

5

6

include in its management Drogram a definition of

7

permissible land and water uses.

8

equivalent of zoning.

9

say;

10

Sow, that's the

That's the ability to go out and

This is a use that will occur here, this use won't

occur there.
That's what we call land use determination

11
12

power.

States don't have that under their police

13

power.

They can't ordinarily do that to federal lands.

14

And I think Congress by enacting the excluded lands

15

provision said, we're going to withhold that delegation

16

of authority and states can't define permissible land

17

and water uses on federal lands.

18

But that doesn't mean that everything that

19

happens to be included in the management program can't

20

be applied to federal lands, because for example the

21

CZMA says that a management program must include the air

22

and water quality requirements of the federal Clean Air

23

and Water Act.

24
25

And we don't understand Sranite Rock or the
Solicitor General to be arguing that those things which
7

are in the management program cannot he applied to

2

excluded federal lands.
QUESTION;

3

Well, this case really comes to us

4

in quite an abstract position.

5

it's possible to say from the record, what sort of

6

questions is California going to ask in this permit

7

proceeding?

What sort of restrictions or conditions

8

would it put

on the permit that was given to the

9

respondent ?
HR. KASOUREDIS;

10

Just what sort of, if

I think the things they would

11

be looking at are reclamation for the mining that's

12

occurred, measures to prevent pollution into the Little

13

Sur River.

There’s a danger of erosion, runoff from the

QUESTION;

Danger of runoff from the federal

19

land to the other lands not owned by the federal

20

government?

21

MR. MASOUREDIS;

Into the Little Sur River.

22

The mining is occurring on Mount Pico Blanco and there’s

23

an extreme slope of about 48 degrees, and the Little Sur

24

River is at the bottom of the canyon, about 2,000 feet

25

from where the overburden is stored.

So there is a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

potential hazard.
QUESTION;

2

In principle you, as I understand

3

your argument, in principle you would say that damage to

4

the federally owned land itself would justify the state

5

environmental regulation, even though no non-federally

6

owned land is affected by that damage?
MR. MASOUREDIS;

7

That's correct, that's

8

correct.

We believe that the state's citizens use,

9

visit, and enjoy federal lands, and that the state does

10

have an interest in environmental degradation on site on

11

federal lands, in addition to --

12

QUESTION:

3ut how many citizens of California

13

want to visit a mining operation that's mining limestone

14

or something?

15

MR. MASOUREDIS:

Well, this particular area,

16

the Big Sur coast of California, is very scenic and

17

attracts roughly three million visitors a year.

18

the visitors would not be coming to see the particular

19

mining operation, but again

20

the heart of the Big Sur coast of California, in close

21

proximity to Malara State Park, the Ventana Wilderness,

22

the Little Sur River that runs out to the coast.

23

QUESTION;

So that

the operation is located in

And so you think it's permissible

24

under this scheme that we're talking about here for the

25

state to say that, we want this federal piece of land to

(202) 628-9300

1

be kept up to snuff and appealing to visitors, in

2

keeping with

the Big Sur countryside?

MR. MAS0UREDIS:

3

We think that we’re

4

interested in having additional supplemental

5

environmental controls to complement the Forest

6

Service’s own surface use requirements.

7

Forest Service’s regulations incorporate a number of

8

state police power environmental rules, such as air and

9

water quality and public safety and public health

10

And indeed, the

requirements, fire laws.
And so to us it appears as if that the Forest

11
12

Service itself relies upon state environmental

13

regulation as a means to attain the Forest Service’s own

14

surface protection interests.

15

question of the state furthering its own interests, but

16

we think those two were very complementary.
QUESTION:

17

It’s not simply a

Well, of course, to the extent that

18

the Forest Service incorporates state regulations the

19

state doesn't have to worry about it, I suppose.
MR. MABOUREDISi

20

Well, under the Ninth

21

Circuit’s decision it doesn’t appear that that is the

22

case.

23

that it's now discretionary with the Forest Service to

24

pick and choose which particular environmental controls

25

it wants to apply.

We read the Ninth Circuit’s decision as saying

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The Ninth Circuit

thought that the state

2

enforcement was the problem.

3

what was prohibited, and therefore it said the Forest

4

Service is the only one that does the enforcement.

5

as a practical matter, there are very limited Forest

6

Service personnel, thousands of claims scattered on

7

millions of acres.

8
9

And the ranger in

Any permit enforcement vas

And

the field is unfamiliar with

state environmental and police power requirements.

He

10

doesn’t have the time, the familiarity, or the expertise

11

to apply them.

12

under the Ninth Circuit's decision we are not assured

13

that there will be any state environmental enforcement.

14

And so we think that as it stands now

QUESTION;

To avoid the preemption by the

15

Coastal Zone Management Act, you really have to rely

16

heavily on the distinction you were drawing earlier

17

between land use restrictions and environmental

18

restrictions.

19

Is that a realistic distinction?

I mean,

20

suppose — prohibition of strip minina, is that a land

21

use restriction or an environmental restriction?

22

MR. MASOUREDIS;

I think the difference

23

between a land use determination type of regulation and

24

an environmental one is in the land use context the

25

analysis is,

we’re going to define what are acceptable

But you make that

6

basis of environmental impact, don’t you?

8

Not really, not really.
—
•
First, land use determination is essentially a zoning

9

type decision, and that really is without regard,

MR. MASOUREDIS;

whereas —

MR. MASOUREDIS;

13
14

On what basis do you zone?
Certain amenities, decisions

about where the community should grow.
QUESTION;

"To-mae-to, tom-mat-to ."

You call

15

them amenities, I call them environmental impacts.

16

Aren’t they the same thing you’re talking about?

17

MR. MASOUREDIS;

I think an environmental

18

regulation is one that says, regardless of what the use

19

is -- and it can be any use

QUESTION;

12

It seems to be they’re both

directed to precisely the same thing.

15

and to try to sever environmental laws from land use

16

MR. MA30UREDIS;

17

You restrict the

I think the important thina

18

here is whether or not the state is going to absolutely

prohibit the particular use we’re concerned about, which

20

is mining.

21

of this lawsuit that the state cannot impose an absolute

22

prohibition on mining because that’s —

And we’ve conceded from the very beginning

Could it prohibit strip mining?

24

MR. MA30UREDIS;

That’s correct.

It could prohibit strip mining, but

Oh, no.

misunderstood your question.

QUESTION;

5

No, the state could not

I’m not saying -- it isn't

6

prohibiting all mining; it’s just prohibiting strip

mining.

8

by subterranean methods, the breaking of the surface.

9

Now, that’s not prohibiting mining.

10

MR. HASOUREDISi

You can mine so long as you do it by, you knew,

That’s right, but it’s

11

defining a particular type of mining.

12

we're arguing, that the state can impose certain kinds

13

of controls.
QUESTION;

14
15

So the state could prohibit strip

mining?
MR. MA30UREDIS;

16
17

Yes, that's what

Yes, a certain type of

mining, but not all mining per se.

That could substantially modify the

If the Forest Service says you can prospect or

MR. MASOrJREDIS;

We’re not intending to

(202) 628-9300

We're seeking to apply a regulation just to

2

control how the use is carried out.
QUESTION;

3

But do you really think there is

4

that air-tight compartment -- I think Justice Scalia

5

suggested to you this in his guestion — between

6

designating the use of the land on the one hand and

7

designating the environmental aspects of the use or

8

whatever you want to call it?
MR. MASOUREDIS:

9

Ho, I'd agree that at a

10

certain point there might be certain circumstances where

11

the state's environmental regulation could conceivably

12

be too onerous and could affect the actual mining use,

13

the ability to carry out the mining use on federal

14

lands.
We'd agree that at that point the regulation

15
16

has gone too far.

17

guestion that's presented here in this case.

18

no evidence at all that Granite Rock couldn't comply

19

with any reasonable Coastal Commission permit

20

requirements .
QUESTION;

21

But I don't think that that is the
There is

Well, we really have nothing before

right?

MR. MA30UREDIS;

That's correct, that's

QUESTIDN;

2

What do you think the purpose of

3

the consistency review provisions in CZMA are if the

4

state has this independent power to regulate that you

5

assert ?
SR. MASOUREDIS;

6

Again, the consistency review

7

provisions deal with the effects that activities cn

8

federal lands have offsite on non-federal lands.

9

consistency review is limited to those offsite effects,

10

and that is different that the kind of review the state

11

would have over affects on-site, on federal lands.

12

it's a different scope.

The

So

And in addition, I just point out that even as

13
14

to off-site effects there is some question whether the

15

state could adequately regulate those as well under

16

consistency, as it could under its direct police power,

17

because there's a particular legal test.
The state has to demonstrate for consistency

18
19

purposes that the activities on-site are likely to have

20

effects off-site.

21

oftentimes very indirect, multi-causal relationships, so

22

that activities on-site don't have these direct off-site

23

effects .

into what that permit requirement required, did they?

No, neither one.

So in a sense,

I suppose you're

The

And there is a difference, I believe, between

Your Honor, there is no purpose

QUESTION;

3

Excuse me.

Is this just as a

4

matter of grace or you think the Forest Service has to

apply state environmental regulations?
MS. BANKE;

The Forest Service regulations

state that the Forest Service is to apply state and

Must they state that?

I believe they —
Do those state laws apply ex

MS. BANKE;

14

I believe that the Forest Service

15

does have discretion to ascertain whether those

20

is quarreling about.

21

22
23

QUESTION;

That is not what Granite Rock

It's a very small dispute we have

before us, then, isn’t it?
MS. BANKE:

Well, it’s a major dispute to

24

Granite Rock.

Tne reason that we’re here is because

25

when we received the letter telling Granite Rock that it
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

had to apply for a coastal development permit, it was

2

already two years into its mining operation pursuant to

3

the federal plan of operations, and it had been

4

subjected to state and federal standards.
When it received the letter, it had a choice

5
6

of either shutting down the mining operation or

7

subjecting itself to possible coastal development

8

penalties, which are severe and can range as much as

9

$5,000 a day.

10
11

So this is a

live controversy in our

view.
QUESTION;

Well, why was it that stark?

12

read the last paragraph -- we're talking about the

13

letter of October 17th, 1983?

14

MS. BAMKE:

15

QUESTION;

As I

Yes, Your Honor.
"Granite Rock is hereby notified of

16

its obligation to submit for Coastal Commission review

17

and approval a certification of consistency with the

18

state's coastal management program and for any future

19

plan of operations."

20
21

22

Is it your view that you simply could not have
submitted any such certificate?
MS. BANKS;

Your Honor,

it is not the

23

consistency review aspect of that letter that we're

24

challenging.

25

preceding that which you read it states that Granite

I believe in the paragraph immediately

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Rock must apply for a permit.
So they are making two requirements in that

2
3

letter:

One is that Granite Rock seek consistency

4

review for any amendments to the plan of operation; and

5

the second is that Granite Rock seek a coastal

6

development permit.

7

Now, formerly at issue was whether Granite

8

Rock had to seek consistency review, but the Coastal

9

Commission admitted at an early stage that that was

10

waived, because they had had actual notice of the plan

11

of operations but did not act upon it within the time.

12

QUESTION;

So it's gust a permit, and we don't

13

know from this record what sort of conditions the

14

Commission might have imposed in exchange for a permit?

15

MS. BANKS;

That is correct, except insofar as

16

I believe they're disingenuous when they say they would

17

only apply water or air quality, because those were

18

already applied and would already be applied in a

19

consistency review of any future plan of operation.

20

What a coastal development permit is is a

21

permit for development, and development is defined by

22

the California Coastal Act as a change in use or the

23

intensity of use.

24

impermissible power given to the state of California to

control the use of these federal lands.

MS. BANKE;

It can administer its

20

environmental laws through standards which are applied

21

to these lands and to the mining on these lands through

consistency review.

23

In consistency review the Congress thought

24

that it was giving the states an incentive to enter into

25

a state's coastal planning process, because the state

would preempt the coastal development permit, because

But in that case, Congress has clearly spoken

8

g
10

to say that permit regulation over federal lands by a
state Coastal Commission is prohibited.

12

it is not just under the federal Coastal Zone Management

Act.

14

its regulations — in the original coastal management

was within the federal coastal zone exclusion and that

it would abide by that exclusion.

QUESTION;

4

NS. BANKE;

That was contained in the plan

In the plan.
And that, there are two reasons.

5

A necessary permit is a permit that is not preempted,

6

and the coastal zone permit in this case is preempted by

7

the Coastal Zone Management Act and the Forest Service

8

regulations.
QUESTION;

9

What permit wouldn't be preempted?

10

I mean, I thought your argument was that the states have

11

no power to require a permit, period, of mining; that

12

the federal government has authorized mining and you

13

don't need a state permit.
But here is a plan that says you have to have

14
15

all necessary permits, and I think it's conceded that

16

that includes state permits.
MS. BANKE;

17

I don't -- it is not conceded.

My

18

second point is that I do not believe that the Forest

19

Service operator has the right to bind the United States

20

in that plan, when it is clear from the Forest Service

21

regulations that there is to be a unified system of

22

approval, with the state requirements considered before

Minear.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY ?. MINEAR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEE
MR.

MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The United States submits that the CZMA
provides a direct and dispositive answer to the present
dispute.

The CZMA's federal lands exclusion exempts all

federally owned land from direct regulation under state
coastal management programs.

The federal lands

exclusion is fully applicable in this case and requires
affirmance of the judgment below.
Our analysis begins, of course, with the
CZMA.

The CZMA was enacted to encourage the states to

develop state land use management programs for the
coastal zone.

The California Coastal Act is

California's coastal zone management program, and as
such it is subject to the CZMA's federal lands exclusion
set forth in Section 304, which excludes from state
regulation lands the use of which is subject solely to
the discretion of the federal government.
QUESTION:

What if it weren't California

coastal zone management program?

Do you

agree with Mr.

Masouredis that this would be a different matter?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. MINEAR:

1

It depends on the source of the

2

law that California is seeking to impose.

3

this case deals directly with the coastal development

4

permit required under the Coastal Act of California*

Our view is that that is the same, the very same program

as the CZMA-appcoved program.

HR. MINEAR;

and we believe that there is a distinction between land

MR. MINEAR:

1

Well, this is something apart

2

from the consistency review requirements.

3

actual requirements of the California Coastal Act.

4

statute itself says that in order to obtain a

5

development permit you must show consistency with the

plan.
Now, that plan is a land use plan.

prescribes and prohibits particular land uses.

Now,

10

California says at this juncture that they would not

11

apply it in that manner, but I think we have to judge

12

the case on the basis of what the statute in fact says.
California really contends that the federal

13
14

lands exclusion in this case is inapplicable for two

15

reasons:

16

was that the statutory exclusion does not apply to

17

federal lands that are subject to a mining claim.

18

contention is the contention that was set forth in the

19

letter that was originally sent to Granite Rock, that is

20

contained in the joint appendix at page 22 to 23.

21

First, the original argument that they made

This

Now, this contention I think all agree now is

22

plainly wrong.

Federal lands that are subject to mining

23

claims remain in federal ownership and hence are

24

excluded lands within the meaning of the CZMA

25

regulations.
46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The Coastal Commission also argues that the

1

federal lands exclusion does not limit the Commission's

authority in

exercise of the state's inherent police power that

5

exists independently of the CZMA.

that's offered primarily by

But the CZMA clearly contemplates that once a

QUESTION!

11

There is no --

You do not confront the problem of

12

having inland states more restricted than coastal states

that is a permit within the meaning af Section 317 and

10

This appears at the joint appendix, page 106.
And although California later amended its

statute, that amendment, we were instructed, amounted

13

only to a technical change, did not amount to any
